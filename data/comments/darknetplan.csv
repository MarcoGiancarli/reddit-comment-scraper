If it was a ham band, encryption on the 900mhz link would have been illegal and the user would be legally required to license themselves or be shut down by the FCC.   From Wikipedia:    In the early 1990s, wireless computer networking was just becoming affordable. Several competing technologies emerged that made use of the 902-928 MHz Part 15 band, such as:   NCR/AT&T/DEC/Lucent WaveLAN. 915 MHz, 250 mW transmit power. Obsolete, but still in use in certain areas.      Aironet (now Cisco) ARLAN. 902-928 MHz with 12 channels, 450 mW transmit power. Obsolete, but still in use in certain areas.      Alvarion BreezeACCESS 900. 902-928 MHz, 200 mW transmit power. Still being sold and in use in certain areas as of 2008.      A now defunct commercial user of 900 MHz wireless networking was Ricochet. They used 900 MHz for the ""last mile"" connection to the user in an early wide area mobile wireless network.      Motorola Canopy is also used by WISPs depending on the Line-of-sight propagation     XG Technology, Inc. xMax. 902-928 MHz. Less than 1 W. A cognitive radio system still being sold and in use as of 2011."

darknetplan,3d2hk6,BostonEnginerd,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:31:35 2015 UTC,"Closed source software limits trust, security, acsess on new platforms.  It fosters unhealthy dependency on a single provider and has all the problems associated as such.  It limits clients and pushes a single UI that may not work to ones liking or have a separate work-flow or limit how it can be used.  Take IRC, there are closed source clients for those who are okay with that but since the standards are public others can host their own IRC servers and have a verity of clients to choose from.  They can even run clients remotely over the command line via SSH.  Slack is lacking independent implementations and clients in part because of it's proprietary nature.  You have no recourse if they change their TOS to something less than desirable there is no other Slack provider(due to it being proprietary).  This means they have a degree of control over their users which is not really the case with OSS where you can fork, self host or use alternative clients.  I hope this clarifies the problem of closed source software."

darknetplan,3c8wd9,Mises2Peaces,3,Mon Jul 6 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"The trouble there is that there's a difference between an internet utility like ISPs, and an internet participant. ISPs exist to allow people to access the internet without being a part of it, same as the phone company, and so they should be restricted in that practice. Community networks on the other hand can range from full participants in the internet, to completely disconnected networks, to access layers for a shared account at an ISP, so where they fall between regulations and entities that should be free of regulations is questionable, and might even need to fall under a case-by-case basis... but for the most part the individual people participating in such a network should be unregulated and not required to do any particular thing, which for a mesh network means no regulation on the whole entity."

In an ideal world where ISPs don't exist in a corporate form, we don't need government oversight on ISPs. In this world, right now, the consumer has no power over ISPs.

That could drop pretty low on a cluttered channel. Realistically 0.1 - 20 mb/s if using a wider band."
darknetplan,3bwb43,angryRake,5,Sun Jul 5 11:06:24 2015 UTC,"As for the device itself, it’s comprised of a Wi-Fi enabled Raspberry Pi computer along with a setup consisting of three antennas. One antenna, naturally, is tasked with connecting to a source Wi-Fi network. The other two antennas work to transmit the Wi-Fi signal at a 900 MHz frequency.  In order to pick up the long-range signal, users will need to plug a 900 MHz antenna into their computer, which will leave your setup looking a little something like this. Not exactly the epitome of mobility, but hey, it seems like a reasonable trade-off to us.   AFAIK, you set up a transmitter at a location which you have a internet access and then you connect to it using a portable antenna.  What I don't understand is, since (nearly all) ISPs stores your personal information, and you are basically connecting to your network from a distance, how can this provide anonymity? Should someone install the transmitter at a foreign location?"

These bands can go way further (144mhz can go across a whole town).  I was wrong, though: 900mhz is a ham band on a secondary basis in addition to being available for unlicensed use. An unlicensed user can put out something like 1 watt, while a user operating under a ham license and ham regulations can put out 150 watts or more, as long as they defer to the primary users of the band, which are the unlicensed phones and things."

darknetplan,3bwb43,autowikibot,1 point,Sun Jul 12 18:29:42 2015 UTC,"Metamaterial antenna:       Metamaterial antennas are a class of antennas which use metamaterials to increase performance of miniaturized (electrically small) antenna systems. Their purpose, as with any electromagnetic antenna, is to launch energy into free space. However, this class of antenna incorporates metamaterials, which are materials engineered with novel, often microscopic, structures to produce unusual physical properties. Antenna designs incorporating metamaterials can step-up the antenna's radiated power.  Conventional antennas that are very small compared to the wavelength reflect most of the signal back to the source. A metamaterial antenna behaves as if it were much larger than its actual size, because its novel structure stores and re-radiates energy. Established lithography techniques can be used to print metamaterial elements on a PC board.       These novel antennas aid applications such as portable interaction with satellites, wide angle beam steering, emergency communications devices, micro-sensors and portable ground-penetrating radars to search for geophysical features.  Some applications for metamaterial antennas are wireless communication, space communications, GPS, satellites, space vehicle navigation and airplanes.   Ost, Laura (January 26, 2010).

darknetplan,3bdx9e,innovator116,7,Sun Jun 28 08:29:43 2015 UTC,"So... it's an amplifier.

Considering that you can get cheap radio systems with near maximum legal power and EIRP antennas built-in (airgrid m5 HP, 21dbm + 23dbi, 44dbm eirp), this solves nothing.  I still don't really understand what the test / breakthrough is. Everyone already knew that standard wifi goes farther with more power."
darknetplan,3bdx9e,frothface,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:04:11 2015 UTC,I mostly agree. Transmission distance isn't out current problem. The server/client model needs to be replaced with dht/p2p.
darknetplan,3bdx9e,Headbite,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:18:26 2015 UTC,With the right software and hardware configuration this can be.  Put a couple of these on a tower and base units in people's homes. Only the base units are allowed to connect to these and everyone else logs into their base units.  Feed a fiber line to these transmitters and charge everyone a flat rate. It would still be a lower cost than previous efforts.
darknetplan,3bdx9e,Dark_Shroud,2,Sun Jun 28 14:01:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't work that way - the benefit of 2.4 ghz is that it DOESN'T travel far. Same thing with cellullar. With 2.4ghz wifi, you have at most 11 channels, and because of the way the AP uses them (channel bandwidth), you only have 3 non-overlapping channels. Which means, within the range of the transceivers, you have 3 pools of bandwidth - for 802.11g that's 54mpbs max. If you have 3 aps and 3 users in the same area, you have a max of 54mbps per second per user. If you throw on a high gain antenna or high power amp to cover a larger area, now you have more people sharing those 3 channels, but the same bandwidth. So if it now sees 6 people, you have at most 27mbps per person. Imagine how many users would be in a 50 mile radius?  One way to fix this is to have directional antennas, so that you have narrow beams of signal that only cover a small slice of the landscape, but then you have all of the receivers and transmitters on the same pole, so while one is trying to receive a weak signal from 25 miles away, you have another one broadcasting right next to it.  This is the reason why they use low powers and short links for wifi and cellular. You are in a small 'cell' of coverage, with enough frequencies and bandwidth to cover the users in that cell. The next cell in any direction uses frequencies that don't overlap, and the next cell over from that one can use the same frequencies as the first, since they are now approximately 3x the maximum range apart."
darknetplan,3bdx9e,frothface,0,Sun Jun 28 18:52:44 2015 UTC,802.11ac
darknetplan,3bdx9e,capsule_corp86,2,Sun Jun 28 22:13:17 2015 UTC,"AC uses more modulation depths (points on the constellation), but the majority of it's speed increase comes from using wider bandwidths - so, instead of using 1/3 of the 2.4ghz spectrum per user, it can use the whole thing. Same situation with 5.8, and the same problem. Now instead of sharing 3 channels with anyone within 50 miles, you're sharing one fast channel (that uses up all of the bandwidth) with anyone within 50 miles. Still doesn't work. The cell has to be sized to cover a reasonable number of users, and the bandwidth is always shared by everyone under that umbrella.  Adding 5.8ghz into the mix adds bandwidth, but it still doesn't fix the issue. Also, not many amplifiers are going to have the gain/bandwidth product to amplify both 2.4 and 5.8 at the same time, which means you would have to have either an ap with different antennas for 2.4 and 5.8 and two amplifiers, or two pairs of duplexers to split the signal and recombine it, plus two amplifiers."
darknetplan,3bdx9e,frothface,2,Mon Jun 29 02:45:41 2015 UTC,"Kinda like WUG? They'll probably need to move to a different band soon, wifi standards now include the 5 GHz band and are set to include the 45 and 60 Ghz bands within a couple of years. Which would probably be for the best, their habit of banning ""undesirables"" leaves a lot to be desired. Their bandwidth usage policy sucks balls, they have schedules for different kinds of traffic.  UMM. Wifi is built on and around low power transmitters. Which enables everyone to have wireless wifi at home etc. all the time without congestion. If you want to use higher strength signals you need to use a WUG, cellphone network bandwidth or another band. Seriously. This sounds like it'll probably break wifi.  No shit they beat satellite ping times. They don't have to send the signal to outer space and back again. Satellite networks beat cellular networks without fiber back bones and other short range umpteen hop networks.  They have little overhead compared to a home wifi network. How do they intend to handle the TRAFFIC which low power transmitters carry by not interfering with each other."
darknetplan,3bdx9e,Involution88,2,Sun Jun 28 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"What I find pretty dumb about this is they are presuming that this already congested frequency is going to just be OK with the FCC when they up the output power.   There is something out there that does this WAY better and its called LTE. 802.11ac with MIMO. Using spread spectrum OFDM. Using beam forming and 4x4 MIMO or higher. And the great thing about that is the infrastructure is already in place for that.  There are honestly alot of problems with telecom in Wisconsin, where this thing was made. maybe someone out there will get a clue. Who knows"
darknetplan,3bdx9e,capsule_corp86,2,Sun Jun 28 22:16:50 2015 UTC,"This seems very illegal. They make it clear they're still using the normal wifi spectrum (their test client picked up the signal with this), but the FCC has very clear limits on allowed unlicensed transmit power on those bands."

darknetplan,3b2kbh,HammyRe,14,Thu Jun 25 13:30:04 2015 UTC,It's also a problem with Freenet. How do you know you want to use the plugin if you can't visit it before you install some random person's code into your super secret anonymity system?
darknetplan,3b2kbh,interfect,5,Thu Jun 25 16:24:15 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the source code of the plugin is available so you could check that. However, even if it isn’t, how is that different from any website? You also have to trust a web server to not deliver any malicious code to you, and you have to trust them to take proper care of your private data, including authentication data. Contrary to most of the popular Freenet plugins and apps, you have no way to check their source code.  So, tell me again: which of these problems is Freenet-specifc?"
darknetplan,3b2kbh,QshelTier,9,Thu Jun 25 16:50:53 2015 UTC,"But that's not the same as a website.

darknetplan,3b2kbh,faustoc4,6,Thu Jun 25 19:49:48 2015 UTC,You're going to trust the JVM to sandbox for you?
darknetplan,3b2kbh,jus341,2,Thu Jun 25 21:05:44 2015 UTC,"JVM is the sandbox for that matter in freenet   Does Freenet run plugins in a different instance of the JVM? If so then I agree, but if plugins have full access to everything the main application does then it's very much different from the JS sandbox.   in traditional Websites not all js code comes from the same site you are visiting, many js code is injected for statistics, tracking, ads, etc   You're right about lots of JavaScript coming from third parties, but I still see two problems with this comparison:   First, I'm not convinced the threat model is the same; malicious JavaScript does not have the same level of access to your system that malicious code running in the JVM does.   Second, I have different expectations from my web browser than I do from an encrypted anonymous file storing network. If you're worried about security in a web browser then you use tools like NoScript to explicitly enable third party JavaScript on a case by case basis. I expect Freenet to have a larger focus on security by default.   On Freenet any node is a server and it hosts the code, just like cloud website/services.   But hosting the code is not the same as running the code. As the author pointed out, Freenet stores only static content - it's up to plugins to recognize that new content is available if you want to design a forum or email-like system. That's very different from a web-server running PHP to facilitate other users accessing content."

The amount of Javascript code running in the browser has grown a lot in the last years. The browser’s sandbox has the same problem that every other sandbox has: too many holes. There’s vulnerabilities in other software running in the browser, such as Flash, Adobe’s AIR, Silverlight, or the Java Plugin. Contrary to open source peer-to-peer software you can not check those for vulnerabilities yourself but you have to rely on a company telling you “yes, our software is perfectly safe.”  The only difference in security between peer-to-peer applications running on your machine and central web applications is that somehow people think the latter are more “secure” (for whatever values of “secure”) (which is simply bullshit)."
darknetplan,3b2kbh,QshelTier,1 point,Fri Jun 26 06:31:47 2015 UTC,"There's a different level of trust with web pages. A web page is not supposed to be able to run arbitrary code outside the sandboxed browser environment. Sometimes it can, but it has to exploit a hole in your browser, and there are measures you can take to haerden your environment to use any given web page without trusting its code. You can go to new eweb sites you have never heard of all day and not get malware.  I don't know what the freenet plugin environment is like, but it's almost certainly harder to secure."

The advertised distance on that one is 800 meters, just under half a mile, as you pointed out.  The second device on the first linked page, (SUB10 Liberator E Series) does 70GHz and 80GHz, max range is 4km with line of site according to a site that's actually selling it (the linked site does claim 5km, and either way it's pretty short). Price from them is £6,000 + tax ($9523 according to Google).  The BridgeWave 60GHz device you linked (AR60) is $11,598.99 and claims to go up to 5280 ft (~1.7km) according to the cdw.com page, which is actually selling them. I couldn't find any public pricing information on the BW64 or BW64E, and they won't even let me download the data sheet.  The FL4G-UHA (80GHz) is $19,900.00, and advertises 1 Gbps up to 3 miles.  The morale of the story is that 60GHz, 70GHz, and 80GHz are, as I predicted without searching, significantly more expensive than lower frequencies. At least the stuff you linked. I was surprised to find it had lower speeds than 24Ghz stuff, like the Ubiquiti AirFiber 24 HD, which is pretty new (so the price can be expected to come down over time) but currently costs $3,000, claims to have a range of 20km and a throughput of 2Gbps."

They are literally a tech blog that literally didn't talk a lot about the tech here. Shoot the messenger.  Yeah, the equipment is expensive. As I said already, prices can drop like a rock through homebrewing and ingenuity. Here's one 24GHz transciever you can build right now. It only goes single side band and CW, but it's something. It's a start. It has a use. Here's a 60GHz 802.11ad USB device that you could potentially amplify. It's a start. It has a use.  Congratulations on higher frequencies being more expensive. Guess what? Lower frequencies (shortwave) are more expensive too.

It has become very popular for new high rises. They run ethernet to every unit. And then we have MULTIPLE ISPs who throw point to point 60Ghz links to a datacenter on the top of our building.  It works great. We have very little to no downtime. Maybe 5-10 minutes per year for when it really really rains. Other than that, they are able to offer great speeds at very low prices.  I am paying $18 for 300mbit symmetric, for instance.  And my latency to the datacenter is roughly 800 microseconds. When I ping Google DNS, the total round trip is about 1.5 milliseconds.

The article says they only deal with building sizes with at least 10 customers. Let's say 50 apartment complexes with 20 customers each. There is your 1000 customer limit that drops the bandwidth down to 1mbps per customer. Wouldn't a ring topology only make the problem worse as now you're piggybacking all that traffic?

How hard is it to queue up the shows you plan to watch and have them trickle download. Even better would be to let you p2p with your neighbors who are going to be watching the same show at almost the exact same time.  Overall, the way I use the internet it's probably a time sink.

Given how many (presumably licensed ham) radio operators have suggested using ham radio to backhaul a meshnet, I suspect being a ham radio operator also doesn't require remembering finicky little things like the contents of the test.  For the most part, a ""serious"" wireless setup requires understanding wireless bands, a general understanding of attenuation and SNR, and the basic geometry knowledge needed to align sector antennas. There are more complexities (polarization, Fresnel zones, cable and fiber runs with their quirks, licensing for non-ISM bands, CDMA, TDMA, LTE, GPS, etc.), but for the most part those can be learned when needed in this kind of community project at this stage, especially when using commercial long-range wifi equipment. I do agree that an off-the-shelf home gateway product and a pringles can is a poor substitute for good equipment though. ;)  Citizens Broadband is potentially exciting, but we won't be using that with a ham TNC... rather a commercial product already designed to use that band, like a nanostation M3, requiring only the same basic knowledge from above to configure and install."

darknetplan,397bwq,pseudo_mccoy,2,Mon Jun 15 15:50:48 2015 UTC,"The ""branding"" is the problem. The redirect start page has a skull and crossbones on it. I was also running the forum add-on thing and made a post describing that this device was not connected to the internet and no logs were kept, feel free to download or upload whatever you want.  I guess in theory it could of been getting a boat load of traffic, I mean I never had any statistics. I'm just going off the fact that nobody even made any requests or anything like that. I'm assuming that after someone had taken the ""risk"" of downloading from an untrusted source and not had anything go horribly wrong their trust would quickly grow and they would feel a little more comfortable asking for things to be added to the box.  I wasn't pumping out a lot of power but still I live on a street full of apartments and had the router in the window. easily 50 units could get a good signal. The time when those random people connected was during a holiday when there were lots more people in the area. It was pretty clear it was some phones that auto connected.  I guess if there was a ""how to"" on the start page that might better explain what the project is all about it would have a better chance of catching random new users. You would be surprised how many times I've tried to send people links on steam(gaming) and had them respond ""I downloaded it, where is it?"". Some people really don't even understand the idea of what files and folders are or what downloading is. They have some vague notion of a bar going from 0 to 100 and something to do with data getting to their computer. I don't think it's a stretch to say these users suffer from ""windows next button syndrome"". If there isn't a next button to click on then it's to much work for them.  Don't let my failure stop you. I'm tempted to redo the start page and give it a second go with some stronger gear. I guess I should mention there is also a small risk that some random person uploads some material that could land you in jail so be sure to do some audits. In theory piratebox operators probably have the same protections webhosts have but the time between getting arrested and getting to court could be a while. Not having any logs doesn't exactly help us either. Just keep your ass covered."
darknetplan,397bwq,Headbite,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:20:21 2015 UTC,"I agree the stock look and feel of the piratebox is going to put some people off. But many of them aren't going to be early adopters no matter how you present it. I'm thinking someone with his or her own apartment and paid internet connection is going to be less interested in some random wifi signal than say, more mobile segments of a population.  I've also not used any statistics but look forward to trying in the future. Since I travel frequently I plan to not only run a piratebox while on the go, but to also create and publish maps for gaining a better idea of which communities are interested in connecting and which ones aren't. Then I'd be able to adjust the box to fit particular social needs.  Increasing my broadcast power is something I need to figure out before I get serious with any of this for two reasons. First, I live in a solar equipped campervan and currently don't have a lot of extra power. Second, I need to push the signal as far out as possible because I don't want a lot of people hanging around my immediate area.  I'm not a fan of systems that require trust, even if it can be built over time. The first time I left my piratebox on overnight at a walmart parking lot I kept thinking who would want to make trouble for me? Sure, I can see a future where some law passes that says pirateboxes are illegal but that'll take time and effort to enforce. In the meantime, who would care? I don't think your average cop gives a damn. Maybe some lawyer who specializes in intellectual property? Roving MPAA goons? I'll look into webhosts' legal protections but won't hold my breath. No sense in expecting the law to protect me. What can I do to cover my ass and still run an effective piratebox?  A how-to on the start page is a great idea! I've been working on a simplified set of build instructions. Once I finish, I'll broadcast the guides so my piratebox will hopefully become self-replicating if enough traffic passes through."

I've heard from a few of my suburban friends that their teen kids are into shock videos. That's the group I would be worried about.   If I had a directional antenna with a little bit of power I could aim downtown and probably pick up a lot more people. We (not me personally) have a few usb dead drops that are in frequent use. There is an active cruiser bicycle group that goes out once or twice a month and their photos end up on the dead drops all the time. We have some live music and I could see photos/videos from those events working great on a piratebox.  Next setup I go with I'll also try and run a few syncthing folders. There are some other projects that are still in beta that are p2p based that look very interesting.

It's also nice to see it's both open source and Steve Gibson approved. I'm a little lost when it comes to technical details though. Could selective permissions be a good way to stop things like shock videos? Are there any automatic/trustless ways to filter abuse? I'm thinking not only about syncthing and pirateboxes, but also for dead drops.  Usb dead drops look cool and I'm glad to hear they're being used out in the wild. This is the kind of project I'm more comfortable with skill-wise. I may be somewhat limited technically but am more than willing to get my hands dirty installing meshy infrastructure. The only problem is that I'm having a hard time reconciling how easy it'd be to wreck one either physically or with malicious code (or shock videos). Also, users would have to use a device they don't mind being compromised by the usb drive, right? Like, the only way I'd plug into one of those is with an old, expendable, factory wiped mobile device (via an otg usb cable. Not sure I'd be down for holding something heavy like a laptop against a brick wall. Sounds like a good way to damage a usb port). Will NFC tags ever have enough storage to be useful in this capacity?  Good luck with rebooting your setup. I look forward to reading about that right combination of things someday."

You can also leave that box unchecked and anyone can make edits to the folder.   Ideally I think it would be best to just have empty networks and let people use whatever tools they want to transfer data around. Also at the same time the public doesn't know what to do with an empty network so we need to give them some training wheels like a piratebox.  For unwanted content I would write a script that compares the difference between today's files and the last time the script was run. From there a human would have to review the new files. If an unwanted file is found I would hash the file and put that into a blacklist that runs once an hour. This method isn't perfect as just changing a single bit would change the hash of the file and get around the blacklist. There might be a more sophisticated way to find partial matches of files but that's beyond my current knowledge. I think you would need to keep the unwanted file to do any kind of partial matching so that might not be an option.  Anyways, I ran for a very long time with zero activity. I think you're probably right that most people won't want to mess with your box. I would feel comfortable doing audits as needed based on activity. Normally I would email the logs but since the box isn't online maybe you could put the logs in a syncthing folder. You just connect to the box and the logs auto sync to your laptop, you check them really quick and call it a day. I don't think this violates the spirit (no logs) of the piratebox as the file list is already public. Anyone could collect that same data.   I think we all take risks everyday with things like driving. Really this isn't all that different."

From the web page:  The InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) is a peer-to-peer distributed file system that seeks to connect all computing devices with the same system of files. In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with content-addressed hyperlinks. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other."

darknetplan,37jiz9,eleitl,3,Thu May 28 09:51:01 2015 UTC,"This is a production camera network but I have a lot of flexibility to make changes.  All the routers are TL-WDR3500 routers running openwrt and cjdns protocol 16.  The routers then run periodic scripts to upload snapshots to one of several backend servers also running openwrt with cjdns and protocol 16 over udp.  The routers talk to each other using cjdns over wifi ad-hoc in autopeering.  About half of the routers are also connected to a switch which the openwrt servers are also connected to.  The goal is for all the routers to upload their snapshots to the backend servers.  Routers that are not connected to ethernet via UDP have to rely on the cjdns wifi mesh to route their snapshots back to the backend openwrt servers.  If one server is down the scripts are intelligent enough to move to the next openwrt server inline.   There are currently about 50 routers and 3 openwrt servers.  The routers that are connected to ethernet are set up to peer with the 3 openwrt servers over UDP on the WAN port and also autopeer on wifi.  The routers are also configured to autopeer over eth0.1 and eth0.2 to each other in some cases where WIFI will not transmit through a wall but an ethernet cable can be punched through a wall and connected to a router on the other side.  http://imgur.com/Ycez6pU      ""UDPInterface"":     [         {             // Bind to this port.

darknetplan,352jou,tshark87,9,Wed May 6 23:54:04 2015 UTC,"Yes. All of my 'this'. This is where the net needs to head. Net is not something that needs to be, or has any business being managed by central institutions, bureaucracies, middlemen, or the like. It is a commoditized, fully solved problem, built upon information signal processing. The system is quite simple when you strip away rent-seekers. It requires a few inputs to the system:   1.) The physical infrastructure (any modern cellphone will do, see point ""a."" below). 2.) The media of communication (the 'wire' for the bits to travel over; point ""b.""). 3.) Electricity needed to power the network of connected devices (point ""c."")   Nowhere in here do we require any greedy corporations (nor 'Cities' for that matter), thwarting and sabotaging the technology at every step, just to pad their pockets. It is a completely decentralized, distributed, peer to peer, free and unlimited framework, if done correctly.  Corollaries:  a. Modern smartphones, if stripped of the hampering / big-brother / malicious code1 installed by colluding, profit-seeking, predatory institutions parasitically leeching off of the supply chain (e.g. T-Mobile + Google) (1 code which deliberately hamstrings the device from operating as it should), will serve as a proper node within HTTP / TCP/IP data transfer. This function can be fulfilled completely autonomously and hands-free with modern softwares if they're properly implemented (and btw, the whole system will work much better than the current mess of convoluted 'tiers' of providers, aka bogged-down central nodes we have in place).  b. You need some type of physical media to transmit upon. We have collectively agreed to give Ma Bell, and subsequently, ATT, Tmobile, Cox, Time Warner and other carriers some limited permissions to utilize these frequencies and bandwidths to mediate our exchange of some internet protocols. In my opinion, they are increasingly proving themselves to be inept at doing the job. The next step is strip them of the state-granted power to be sitting in these positions, and reclaim the airwaves ourselves to erect a proper mesh network as described in this comment, the article, etc.  c. Power is obviously the last bit needed, and the most within our control/already taken care of factor. If you have 'power-on' (which is now trivially cheap and prevalent these days, at least in 1st world), then you should be able to fully erect the rest of the mesh network, via a recursive approach, by iteratively implementing the other principles described herein, and nowhere along the way are external agents, lawmakers, government bodies, institutions or anything of the sort required to make comment, interfere or at all be involved. It is a natural, organic, self-regulating process that must begin sooner than later, before the monopolists claws are too deep and this info is forgotten."

If we manage to incentivize participation in mesh networks, there's no reason owners of backbone links couldn't participate and get paid market prices for their service. The differences would be a lack of an oligopoly and greater competition."
darknetplan,34jf3v,ebek,6,Sat May 2 11:24:51 2015 UTC,This. Never know when a link could be the equivalent of Ethernet between two houses or a mile of previously dark fiber that a like-minded business owner lit for the greater good or a tax write-off.

I really don't know how a mesh network would work with backbone links. How would routing work? Also, I doubt you get to keep the advantages of a mesh network even if it does work."
darknetplan,34jf3v,ebek,5,Sat May 2 16:12:01 2015 UTC,"What is a mesh network? It is basically numerous nodes which are connected to each other in various ways, with owners that allow people to send information through their nodes, either for free or not.  Now, what is a backbone link? It is a link with long reach and high capacity, coupled with several nodes that serve as gateways between other nodes and the link.  What I'm trying to say is that there is no principal difference between the links running through the Atlantic ocean and the link connecting you to your ISP's closest router, or indeed the WLAN connecting you to your neighbors. Routing is done using routing tables, just as in centralized networking and as in CJDNS. All network links can be included in a mesh network, the question is how to incentivize node owners to let others send traffic through their nodes. This goes both for owners of backbones and for regular users; while I certainly don't think that AT&T are interested in doing it for free, neither is the average Joe."
darknetplan,34jf3v,ebek,1 point,Sat May 2 17:42:20 2015 UTC,I don't feel like I'm getting the whole story here. It sounds really great but I get the sense that there are some important caveats here.   I'd love to see what your talking about in action with two large mesh networks connecting to each other via a super node. I somehow doubt that would solve the latency issues and think VOIP and P2P applications would still have a problem running over it.
darknetplan,34jf3v,Headbite,2,Sat May 2 18:25:53 2015 UTC,"Obviously what I'm talking about has not been solved yet. There is no decentralized market for Internet connectivity, only oligopolies, because AFAIK participation in meshnets has not yet been incentivized properly. But when/if we get there, there can be many different factors at play when a package gets routed. For latency-sensitive applications, low-latency links and few hops are obviously of top priority, but the same is not necessarily true for privacy-, speed- or price-sensitive applications.  Link owners compete using speed, reach, latency, price and so on, and different links will be preferred by different applications at different times, depending on the application's priorities as well as the current state of the network. Backbone links can run alongside numerous small links and don't have to act exclusively as bridges between meshnets. They can also be parts of the meshnet, just with different features than ""regular"" links (most likely higher prices, but also higher capacity, reach and lower latency).  Regarding routing in such a setting, we should note that at its core, routing is basically an unweighted shortest path-problem, and these additional factors just make it weighted instead. There's no great difference in the underlying problem. As for specific algorithms that could be used, I think someone more familiar with networking in general and routing in particular should answer."
darknetplan,34jf3v,m_bishop,2,Sat May 2 19:51:41 2015 UTC,I don't think it would take me that long to get voip working with tox on a mesh network.

darknetplan,34jf3v,thefinn93,3,Fri May 1 18:35:02 2015 UTC,"The issue would be reliability. At some point you have to make a choice, either you have a lot of systems, and you're selecting routes through any of them, or you have a small set of super nodes that you're routing through for efficiency.   As you route through fewer nodes, the system becomes more prone to failure if one of those nodes goes down.   Now, that said, if you can trust a route for the duration of a session, you're golden."

darknetplan,34jf3v,lloydsmart,2,Fri May 1 18:29:38 2015 UTC,I'm not exactly sure but I believe it would be extremely slow.  Mesh networks are connecting you to your site through several intervening hops back and forth through all the computers it takes to reach it. So already you have that latency concern to deal with. Add to that a p2p app like bittorent and you multiply those hops by each seed that you are getting and each computer your seeding to on the network.  I'd love to be proven wrong of course.
darknetplan,34jf3v,willmartindotcom,4,Fri May 1 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"It's not so simple. Your usual DSL line takes you to your target via a couple of hops too. Try this:  mtr 8.8.8.8 # or mtr hyperboria.net   An advantage you get with wifi compared to fiber, is actually better latency, at least theoretically. Light is slower in fiber.  For anecdotal reference, the latency from my Laptop to my VPS is ~ 32 ms via DSL, and ~ 15 ms via the local community network Freifunk."
darknetplan,34aate,Desdinova_42,2,Wed Apr 29 15:35:13 2015 UTC,"Well. A free-for-all wireless network with a few file exchange boxes and an internet connection is a start. To expand, connect your local network and fileboxes with another's, over wireless mesh, with an ethernet cable, whatever. Then they'll connect to others and so on and so forth and before you know it, you have thousands of users on your private network. If you're unable to connect directly to another such network, consider setting up a site to site VPN.

darknetplan,345l9d,OmegawOw,3,Tue Apr 28 14:10:20 2015 UTC,"The problem with nodes ""messing each other up"" is mostly just a lack of local radio bandwidth available, and the fact that ""meshing"" requires at least two radios to be tuned to the same channel, making either mesh bandwidth limited (because many radios are sharing the same channel), or mesh nodes expensive (because they'd need one radio for each channel they're participating in).  The whole thing boils down to handshakes really. Chances are you've shaken hands with someone, who has shaken hands with someone, so on so forth, out to someone who shook hands with any random celebrity you could name. The number of ""hops"" to get from you to any random person is notable because of its relation to hops needed to get from you to another node on a large-scale meshnet.  Assuming use of long-range wired links and internet tunnels by high-bandwidth nodes, a ""backbone"" naturally forms, not in the sense that the network forms a single point of failure, but in that traffic typically doesn't need more than a handful of hops (perhaps 7 or 8?) to get where it's going because of a number of nodes that happen to cross long distances and connect physically distant nodes. Current routing protocols are perfectly capable of dealing with that topology. Even BGP, a protocol that's run the internet as we know it for decades, is capable of handling hundreds of thousands of nodes with massive geographical distribution.  Essentially the answer boils down to ""yes, it scales""."
darknetplan,345l9d,jercos,1 point,Thu Apr 30 15:55:22 2015 UTC,"However how does it scale into the large global scale ?   I don't know, and I'm not sure if someone can answer too. But there are networks like guifi.net, which has ~22.000 nodes and freifunk with ~12.000 nodes. If we could link the guifi in Spain with the freifunk in Germany, than it becomes a little global. :)  I know that guifi requires a backbone, but I don't know if it's same for freifunk. Probably a backbone would be needed for a global meshnet too, but I think we will have more political issues/problems than technical ones if things become that big..."
darknetplan,345l9d,boraalper4,1 point,Wed Apr 29 06:11:58 2015 UTC,So once it scales it needs a backbone to have good latencies but can work even without one albeit at much higher latency. And the backbone itself is a mesh so it works that way I guess.

Some howto's might be nice, but then do we just end up linking to a bunch of other projects sites (turning this place into a linkfarm) or do we duplicate work and make our own instructions? There is also this problem of ""cheerleading"", where just because I happen to use a set of tools I think they are the best, even if I've never tried other tools. Anyways here is a skeleton off the top of my head that could be put in a wiki type document.  (1)Assumptions: The concept of reliability and unreliability in the network layout and data storage often goes unnoticed. In the following examples it's assumed that the localnet is reliable and the local storage is reliable.   (2)LocalNet: Any centralized empty network. Can be wired or wireless. Typically an ipv4 wifi routers not connected to the internet.  (3)Data storage and transmission over LocalNets: (a)What are the goals? That's easy if you assume the current internet is broken beyond repair. The goal is to find a method of transferring data that's better then handing someone a thumbdrive. Handing someone a thumbdrive has the upside of being very fast but if you have friends like me you probably won't get your drive back for a very long time. In theory that thumbdrive could keep getting passed around from person to person, picking up viruses along the way and having it's original data altered or even deleted.  (b)A step up from there would be a dead drop. This is basically just a thumbdrive cemented somewhere in public. The upside here is more people can use it. The downside is basically everyone has read/write and can delete, alter, infect, etc the drive.  (c)Then you have your wifi NAS type devices. The default configuration would be everyone has read/write. Same problems as above. In theory it's possible to automate issuing group permissions but I don't know of any existing projects that already do this. Guess I should go take a closer look at freeNAS. (don't hate me, someone with more info can fill this part in)  (d)Next up is your wifi dead drop (aka piratebox). You get a chatbox, forum, and data drop. For the most part once data is uploaded it's read only. It would still be possible to trick people by posting a similar filename with either dummy data or infected data. At least in theory the original data should be sitting on the box somewhere for some period of time.  (e)Last up in this category would be your ownCloud servers paired with a forum. The only thing you gain with this setup over a piratebox is the ability to private message people (via the forum) and have private file storage.  (f)P2P on a localnet. This doesn't seem that interesting to me because peers would have to be in the same area at the same time. I could be missing something here.   (4)MeshNet: See sidebar. Any decentralized network.  So in all the above examples you have to walk to drop off your data and pick it up. ""How do you get your data while sitting on the couch?"" That's basically where meshnets come in.  Anyways I'm just trying to add to the goal of ""organizing some information"" in the style of a wiki. I think localnets are sort of the introduction to meshnets and show why meshnets are needed. I know a lot of people won't agree and just want ""free internet"" out of their meshnet. That's fine, that can be another section of the wiki. Yeah, we're not supposed to be talking about side projects (per the sidebar) but as this is more a wiki style discussion I think briefly mentioning them would help. At a minimum it would help the people who are in the wrong place.  LOL. Who doesn't need a meshnet seems like a good thing to be in a FAQ."

darknetplan,32qch3,-updn-,11,Wed Apr 15 21:30:03 2015 UTC,"It's not like there's a naming authority or anything, but I see it like this:  Darknet = any communication system meant to conceal who is communicating with whom and what they're doing. The more it emphasizes privacy and attack resistance, over other concerns, the ""darker"" it is. Obviously it's nice to have a decentralized network if you don't want any central points of attack on it, thus a really hardcore darknet might want to have a mesh net as its physical infrastructure.  Mesh net = A decentralized network without a ""trunk"" structure, often but not always created by ad-hoc, opportunistic negotiation among wireless nodes.  Dark Web = HTTP and maybe HTTP-like protocols over darknets.  Deep Web = The parts of the ""regular"" cleartext Web that aren't easily found, because they're not indexed by search engines or whatever. But not deliberately ""dark"".

I was thinking of how to even remove the ISP as middle man, let alone the client-server paradigm. Many cool solutions to connect over mesh but they all seemed to stick with this idea that there has to be a server, and an addressing scheme to allow for distance/hops.

darknetplan,32kx75,happygore,9,Tue Apr 14 16:50:30 2015 UTC,"If you're just sharing a connection to the internet, you're basically just becoming your own very smaill ISP.   If you share an internet connection behind your router, the ISP has no way of knowing that you're doing it.  A darknet is the opposite of this.   A darknet is a network that does NOT have a route to the internet.    If you and 5 of your friends set up wireless links to each other's houses, and hosted files for each other, brought up a chat room, or email server for just that network.  That is a darknet."

darknetplan,32kx75,Headbite,3,Wed May 6 21:13:33 2015 UTC,"In my area there are two real backbone providers and I'm not interested in fund raising every month to keep the connection open. If an empty meshnet was already blanketing the city, small groups of people could come together and setup their own vpns to a friends house and all leech/pay off their connection. In the long run I think this is just going to end up pissing off the ISP's and hurting everyone.  I really think the bulk of the traffic on the mesh should be DHT based. I guess rule 4 in the side bar is kind of there to keep us from getting into a pissing competition over which DHT based programs are the best. I'm really just saying, since the mesh is distributed the data should also be distributed.  I think one thing to add to the mesh discussion is this idea of low priority ports. For example say anything in the 9000-9999 range has a QOS policy that makes it idle bandwidth only. If I know my data isn't all that important I'll just send it over those ports. I'm fine with those ports even being blocked in times of extreme traffic. Since I would be transferring that data using some p2p based method, resuming later wouldn't be a problem.  Besides, we already have ""free internet"" at coffee shops and nobody cares."

darknetplan,328nzb,ThatSneakyJew,2,Sun Apr 12 13:28:46 2015 UTC,"Nobody knows how to make something go viral. Even if you manage to make a video that is capable of going viral there is no way to know when it will actually go viral.  Forgetting the layout of the meshnet, meshnets server two main functions. Connecting people to the internet or replacing the internet. Category one is never going to happen in the US without a boat load of cash. (granted the original poster says he lives in a village which would be an uncommon thing to say in the US) We just don't have access to correctly priced bandwidth. This is basically trying to go head to head with the giants. If you want to fight that battle, have fun.  Category two (which I fall in) is for people who already have content. My data source and destination can be said to be internet independent. Any network will work for my needs. My data is of no interest to the public. I know what I need my network to do, I'm just trying to decided if I should go with something cjdns based or broadband-hamnet based with a little consideration to leaving the network open for other people to use. I've got plenty of p2p based methods of pushing my data around and the information I'm moving isn't all that time sensitive. If someone started running a bunch of live video feeds which sucked up all the bandwidth all the time then I would probably have to close the network, but I'll leave it open until it's a problem.  I'll focus the original posters question even further. They are asking ""how do I know what other people need out of a mesh network"" and in the same breath they are answering that with ""access to the current internet"". The answers to those question are obvious. If you live in a place where access to the internet is cheap and you have more bandwidth then you need, then you don't need a mesh network.  Look, the problem with opening up a mesh to the internet is everyone is going to want to start streaming netflix over it. In my opinion that's going to make it useless to the average consumer of content. If they can't stream their shows then they have to shell out money for their own internet and at that point they don't need a mesh. Access to facebook might be enough to interest some content consumers but at the end of the day those people are consumers. They'll never be interested in contributing to the health of the network.  I'm setting up a mesh for my needs and will let other people leech off it until it becomes a problem. I ran a piratebox for a year covering about 100 apartments and only ever saw 2 confused people connect to it by accident. As my mesh will not be connected to the internet I don't expect anyone else connecting to it to have any idea what to do with a bare network. Maybe I'll leave a copy of the piratebox software open or redirect to an IPFS gateway to help the randoms connecting. Again this idea that after my needs are met it's not much more work to tac something on at the end to try and help other people out.  Nerd things have a way of becoming trendy. In the process of entering mainstream they normally get watered down. I think to some degree this happened with ""the cloud"". In my opinion cloud was originally a term that should of stayed with people on the back end. It never made any sense to turn it into a marketing term. It watered down the original meaning as it transitioned to mainstream use. If meshnets end up becoming trendy with the public you can be sure their understanding and use of the word are not going to be the same as how we are using it right now. There will always be a divide between us and them. This divide is central to how I talk about meshnetworks. If you want to give the mainstream access to the internet over a meshnetwork then you're just turning a technical term into a marketing term. Congratulations you just passed capitalism 101.  He guess what, you can run your nodes however you want. Awesome right? How do you get rich setting up a mesh in your neighbourhood? I don't know, I don't care, that's got nothing to do with what I need. I'm not interested in paying you or anyone else to move my data round. I'm not interested in trying to make a few bucks off people in the process. Have you heard the phrase ""the race to zero""? It a term to describe how storage is so dirt cheap it's basically free. I think meshnetworks can do the same thing for bandwidth."

Ideally there would be  a global network of resources specifically for doing this. I think a key factor is that you should be building commons, this means common infrastructure neither public nor private but common to all. Perhaps it could take the form of a meshnet collective which might have certain expenses or incentives for mesh nodes to participate, but the underlying premise would be that access has to be open. People who have nothing to do with it should be able to get online with this mesh net. In this way it becomes an open system meeting human needs, even if some of the underlying structure or deployment incentives is capitalized. Sounds like a great way to get exposure.. if you can cooperate to saturate a city with access points, people will naturally use them and perhaps be drawn to the community spirit of participation and get involved in it, or other such meeting of human needs which have no profit motive to be viable under pure competition."

This is why I mentioned switches. They'd provide a way to connect everyone's fibre together in an effective way, but someone would have to own them.

If there's no current mesh-based solution for them, that's an acceptable answer.  IMO having a fibre connection to one or two neighbours, even in a ""chain"" topology, is preferable to the current practise of connecting to an ISP through a DSLAM or similar technology, especially if the connection is fully encrypted, as it would be with CJDNS.

Besides the lack of critical mass to start the Lisbon MeshLocal plan, there are also limitations on the hardware required by CJDNS. It needs at least 32 MB of RAM, which rules out several OpenWrt capable routers.  Thus, from all the hardware people were willing to donate, we can only use the 2x USB Wi-Fi adapters + 2x Bifferboards and the 1x TP-LINK TL-MR3020 (only 3 nodes total ...).  If you are willing to put in some of your spare time and get some friends to join in we can give this a second try. Our plan can be something like:   Build a small community of people willing to set up stray nodes and connect them between each other through Internet tunnels. Get them to convince neighbours and slowly build the mesh.   We can bootstrap this with a Meetup where people would bring in their hardware and install CJDNS while helping each other. Later they could get back home, connect to Hyperboria and to everyone they met.  We should focus our attention on those who have single-board computers (SBC) lying around (Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard, Bifferboard, ...).

The incentive is a successful mesh network could eliminate your monthly internet bill or at least significantly lower it's cost.  What's a fair ammount of compensation for someone running a 10 watt router? Really the operating costs on such a device are less then 1 dollar per month. There is no real labor involved in plugging in a device and sticking it in your window and forgetting about it. Sorry buddy but you're not going to get rich running a mesh node.  Tor is unusable? You got issues man.
darknetplan,31hqun,Headbite,2,Mon Apr 6 17:03:18 2015 UTC,Have you tried using Tor? It's dog slow to the point of being unusable. Because the good is free there is too much demand and not enough supply.   Money is not the only incentive but it is one that scales. Reputation works but only when the community is small.  The issue here is economics -- supply and demand. Wishing that this fundamental law of economics didn't exist won't make it so.

Your model has all the overhead of upper management, advertising, sales and support, billing and most important shareholder profits diverting cash away from the actual network performance.  Claiming fundamental laws doesn't answer my question, ""How much should someone be compensated for running a 10 watt router?"". Let's not forget customers already pay for the electricity to run their isp's gear.  Let's be honest, what's actually stopping mesh networks from taking off is convenience. People would rather shell out 30 bucks a month for something they are used to then try something new."
darknetplan,31hqun,Headbite,2,Mon Apr 6 21:50:01 2015 UTC,"1.5mpbs on Tor is amazing. The speeds I was getting were comparable to a modem, and that's if the page loaded at all. I get 60mpbs on my home connection. Why can't I get that on Tor? Hint: Because it's free.  Asking ""How much should someone be compensated for running a 10 watt router?"" belies your complete economic illiteracy. The only possible answer is ""The market rate."" Anything else presupposes a labor theory of value.   Let's be honest, what's actually stopping mesh networks from taking off is convenience. People would rather shell out 30 bucks a month for something they are used to then try something new.   If you think people are willing to pay for convenience then we're in agreement. Provide them a great product that brings value to their lives and charge them for that convenience. That's the way for a mesh network to scale."
darknetplan,31hqun,MaunaLoona,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"Your ""fundamental laws of economics"" are better described as learned behaviors. So you're getting 60mbps on your home connection when your rented hardware is probably capable of 100mbps or even 1gbps. That's the example you're going to use of scalability?    When humans interact with others they see as being their equals economics generally doesn't apply. I think most people are willing to help their neighbors and friends on the assumption that favors will average out over time. I personally consider mesh networks to fall in this category. I think most people would find it insulting to try and monetize their friends and neighbors, but that's just my opinion. I personally have no interest in trying to turn a mesh network into a job.  Here are 6 speed tests done over tor this morning from my 18mbps home connection. The average download speed is 0.9mbps. High of 1.84, low of 0.32. If you don't like tor, don't use it. If you're not able to get around 1mbps there might be something wrong with your setup.  http://gateway.headbite.com/ipfs/QmbLR5CicmgeTTBgNj7q8G8C7KSA7kANdZ9Cso5AqKFqh6"

darknetplan,31hqun,Headbite,9,Sun Apr 5 05:14:07 2015 UTC,LTE Direct is device-to-device technology like Bluetooth or Wi-Fi Direct. So it's probably not going to be just for cellphones.  As for drones and balloons I imagine they could operate the same way as the rest of the mesh network (device-to-device) and they wouldn't need to be owned by one organization.

I get the impression that anyone could launch a high altitude craft and that it would be needed to bridge the continents. I also thought that LTE Direct could be used in any device that had the necessary chipset in it which in addition doesn't rely on tower or satilite to work and that it would be needed for a scalable and acceptably fast network.

There are more recent talks at defcon and CCC that seem to suggest that simcards might not be all that great to have as part of your network. The carrier IQ video basically show keystrokes being recorded even while connected over SSL.  I understand that the current stated goal of this sub is to first get a viable clearnet up and running and then transition to a true darknet but I think that transition would be impossible with cellphones as the backbone of the network. On their surface they look like a sexy option but when you get into the details they don't look so hot. Another thing to keep in mind is most cell phones are subsidized by locking customers into a contract. What's to stop the carrier from blocking our mesh ports when their lucrative overage charge profits start drying up?   I could be totally off, I just mention it so we can have a better discussion. Someone else can be the voice of reason, I'll be the voice of doom."

B.A.T.M.A.N.'s crucial point is the decentralization of the knowledge about the best route through the network — no single node has all the data. This technique eliminates the need to spread information concerning network changes to every node in the network. The individual node only saves information about the ""direction"" it received data from and sends its data accordingly. Hereby the data gets passed on from node to node and packets get individual, dynamically created routes. A network of collective intelligence is created.  In early 2007 the B.A.T.M.A.N. developers started experimenting with the idea of routing on layer 2 (Ethernet layer) instead of layer 3. To differentiate from the layer 3 routing daemon the suffix ""adv"" (spoken: advanced) was chosen. Instead of sending UDP packets and manipulating routing tables, it provides a virtual network interface and transparently transports packets on its own. The batman-adv kernel module has been part of the official Linux kernel since 2.6.38.       Interesting: B.A.T.M.A.N. | Linux range of use | Freifunk   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

darknetplan,30vzl5,ManMalekula,6,Tue Mar 31 03:43:05 2015 UTC,"Reposting because I'm an idiot and I messed up the networks the first time.... I'm the mod of /r/radiomobile. I took your coordinates and did a coverage map.   http://imgur.com/a/FgzJ0  The first two images show the reception from each end of the link, the bottom one shows potential repeater locations. It looks like you are going to need some antenna gain to get this to work. This coverage assumes 20dbm radios and a 24 dbi antenna mounted 10m above the ground at every point.  It looks like the repeater location (marked midpoint) won't have reception from the left AP, but there are two other locations that should work fine if you have access to them. The highlighted link is the worst - about 9db at the recevier. I would avoid that one if possible. You'd probably get a link, but it would fade when the weather is poor and it would be slow under ideal conditions. 9db is relative to the absolute minimum receive level, so if the manufacturer lied even a little bit it might not work at all.  The other location had at least 33db on the weakest link. You could go with 900 mhz, but the link will be slower and the equipment is more expensive. It seems that 900mhz doesn't get you any more signal since the antenna gain is going to be lower for the same cost/size, and you aren't passing through enough tree canopy for it to make a difference. There are better locations for the northwest (left) AP as well."

I wouldn't expect too much capacity through the links you're putting up because of the amount of rainfall. I would stick with 20 MHz channels as opposed to 40 and definitely go with directional antennas to get a nice robust signal, especially since it looks like about 4-6 miles on each leg."

Visual confirmation is probably good enough but if you want to have some fun a 50mW green laser should have the range to let you check visibility.  Check out this tool to see if that helps you figure out what kind of antenna you will need. You can use a Linksys WRT54g with DD-WRT to be your switch on the mountain since you will want something that can be managed and save you a few hikes hopefully. Your big issues to me are going to be power and weatherproofing.  Weatherproofing: with some sort of NEMA enclosure should do the trick.  Power: your going to need enough solar panels to generate enough to not only power the devices but also charge some batteries so you can have a few days of backup power. But I dont know anything about this so I cant help other than telling you to find out how much wattage an antenna takes to operate and extrapolate that out for the time span that you want to have on battery.  Also your going to need to build a platform for all of this to sit off the ground and keep everything secure and your antennas aligned correctly since even a small adjustment could cause your network to go down."

darknetplan,30r25h,Cagn,28,Mon Mar 30 23:05:03 2015 UTC,"First of all it's important to point out that alternatives to the internet don't necessarily mean free from corporations and governments. It's easy to imagine a mesh network taking off in your city and a corporation renting out routers for 50 bucks a month for naive users. Same logic with government spying.   I see this sub as a place to experiment with alternatives. I ran a piratebox for a year in my apartment complex and only ever had 2 people connect to it during the winter holidays. I had a 2TB drive hooked up with around 1TB of recent tv shows populating it. My little experiment didn't produce much.  There are a few ""usb dead drops"" around my city. Mostly different groups are putting photos of local events on them. I wouldn't consider that experiment as doing a whole lot either.  The problem with opening up a portion of your own internet bandwidth to the public is you take on some risk when you do that. I've thought of setting up a second router that routes everything through tor but honestly that's not all that exciting. You basically end up giving people the same thing they already know.  I think ipfs has a lot of promise. When I get some free time I'll try and pair up a pi running as a ipfs gateway with a router. Really that's going to confuse people even more then the piratebox did but that's fine. I play with these things because I have fun doing it. If nobody cares it's still worth my time. I also need to set some time aside to play with cjdns."

I haven't given up on playing with alternative networks. At some point I'll pick up some better hardware and try to blanket a larger area. I'm fine with the idea of paying a few cents an month to run a router that's transmitting 3-4 watts but trying to pay for bandwidth so people can stream netflix doesn't interest me at all. I really don't know anything about cjdns but I imagine once a meshnet is up people who want to share some of their internet bandwidth will be able to do that.  I want to do a little local testing before I shell out any money for some new routers. Once I get to that point I'll make a post with some details so people can comment/complain. :) I think meshnets will go viral at some point but it's hard to predict when that will happen.

darknetplan,2yw9cx,ProtocolBuilder,2,Fri Mar 13 10:01:25 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what went wrong with the official instructions. You put the IP, password, public key, and listening port from one where it says to add peers in the other, right? And the cjdns process is starting and staying up? What OSes are involved?  Cjdns runs over UDP, but can carry TCP and UDP as well as ICMP (pings), so any program that supports IPv6 ought to work.  Your intuition about dynamic IPs and port forwarding and such is right. If you want to run a node on a dynamic IP behind a home router, you need to manually forward the port and keep your peers up to date with your current IP address through other channels, if you want people to connect to you. Right now nodes at people's houses usually connect to the broader network by making outgoing connections to VPS servers with static IPs that people run specifically for cjdns. However, in the contrib/python directory there is a ""dynamicEndpoints.py"" script that lets you use a DNS name instead of an IP address as a peer, so if you forward your port and set up dynamic DNS, you could get people to connect in to you that way. I have a pull request in to get that script set up as part of the Debian/Ubuntu package, so that might happen soon. Apparently UPNP might be the next thing to implement?  The community generally doesn't want the use case where people connect to each other from their houses to work well. I don't really know why; I just conclude they hate fun.  To debug your cjdns setup you probably want the ""peerStats"" script in contrib/python, which can see who your peers are and whether you managed to connect to them. That would maybe shed light on why your nodes can't see each other. There are also some scripts for reading the cjdns logging stream.  I am not sure that cjdns is the right choice for an IM system: it requires a lot of manual configuration (unless you are using just Ethernet auto-peering on Linux), and doesn't have all that good support for discovering who exists (although you can walk the graph of peers) and who is using your IM system. You would practically need an entire other DHT system to register addresses to names and allow automatic addition of peers anyway."
darknetplan,2yw9cx,interfect,1 point,Fri Mar 13 15:10:02 2015 UTC,"Oh thanks you very much for your long answer!  Yes I put all those in both files both in inbound and outbound, I tested It with both Windows because I knew it was a native Linux application so I wanted to test if it works in Windows so everybody can use it regardless of their OS. But I think I will test it with Linux because it might be a Windows only error. The funny thing is that I don't really know if it is working or not because I don't know if not answering to ping or Zenmap nmap or ping -6 commands is normal or not. But since you tell me that ICMP traffic is supposed to work I think it should answer to pings.   Oh great! Thanks your for that pull request, that sounds awesome, I think I maybe try to compile the version of the software with that included so I can use that as usernames for the people in the application. Oh, I've heard about UPNP before but I don't understand it very well, can I using an UPNP application make cjdns to go out of NATS without forwarding ports? Or it HAS to be implemented in cjdns to work?    The community generally doesn't want the use case where people connect to each other from their houses to work well. I don't really know why; I just conclude they hate fun.    Yes I noticed that too, I don't know why that elitism, with that kind of behavior cjdns adoption won't probably grow very much.   Oh interesting that thing about peerStats I will search for it.   Hmm, the thing is that we are thinking about is to make the IM program to edit the config file when they add people in the IM network. So cjnds will be ""invisible"" to the non-tech person, but at the same time will be doing a lot of work.    You would practically need an entire other DHT system to register addresses to names and allow automatic addition of peers anyway.    Would you recommend me to use another protocol for a IM program?  Oh, and if I use the IM program to read everyone cjdns config files and edit them adding everyone else? (or at least a good amount of users) and also I use your script to use names instead of IPs?  For example, when you download the program it already comes with a good list of active peers in the lats minutes, so you can connect to the network.  Like everybody has the IPs and keys for a part of the Network (or all the Network) so when someone changes their IP they can connect again with everybody else and broadcast their new IP. The program would be parsing the JSON and adding the people so the user won't have to configure anything.  The thing is that everybody that is going to have direct text chat or VoIP/video chat connect directly instead of using friends of friends.   Is that a good idea, or is very hard and unlikely to work?  Here are the config files if you want to look at them, but I just followed the Github instructions:  PC http://paste.debian.net/hidden/d1d7e879/  Laptop: http://paste.debian.net/hidden/eae67b9a/"
darknetplan,2yw9cx,interfect,2,Fri Mar 13 17:53:41 2015 UTC,"OK, you have both of them listening on port 34380, but only one of them is trying to connect to the other's port 34380. The other is trying to connect to port 9147 on the first one. However, that should still work; you only need the one to connect to the other. They don't both need to connect to each other.  Did you use the Windows binary installer I put up? Or did you build it yourself on a Linux system and copy it over?  Did you manually open the appropriate ports in Windows Firewall?  I worked a bit on the Windows port and I don't remember actually testing inbound connections to a Windows system. If you try it on Linux and it suddenly starts working, that could indicate an issue there that needs to be fixed.  For debugging I would recommend setting the config file flag and passing the right command line option so you get logs on standard out, and seeing what the two nodes say about trying to communicate. It looks like the passwords are right, but maybe there's a typo in one I didn't catch or something.  You could also bust out Wireshark and look for UDP packets to/from port 34380, to see if either system is sending anything at all to the other.  The IM program, if it does use cjdns, would probably be best off using the cjdns admin API to control the cjdns node, instead of messing about with the JSON-with-comments config file. You would start up cjdns with whatever --genconf made on the first run, and then your code could tell cjdns on every boot what peers it should connect to and what passwords it should use on every startup. You could tell it what passwords to accept, too. Sort of like an expanded version of my script that, instead of just hitting against DNS for IPs and using a local file of known peers, maintains a distributed database of the Internet address/port/public key/peering password of everyone you can peer with. But that's what I mean about having to build your own DHT system: you still need this distributed database or other system for letting peers connect to each other automatically. It might be easier than it otherwise would be since you have a public-key-encrypted somewhat-reliable messaging system, though. Just phone up the IPv6 addresses of your friends over the mesh, through your existing peers, and ask them for their Internet IP addresses and listening ports, so you can set up a direct connection. You would have some sort of bootstrap list ship with the client or something, like you suggest.  The pull request with my script was actually accepted into the mainline a few days ago. See here.  Cjdns can connect out from behind a NAT to a peer on the Internet just fine, and packets will flow both ways. But if your computer starts listening for cjdns connections on a certain port, and you are behind NAT, nobody can connect to you because the inbound packets hit the router and aren't sent from there to your computer. To fix that, you can either make the user set up a port forward themselves, or you can use UPNP, a very large and often poorly implemented protocol for controlling all sorts of networked devices, to have your program instruct its local router to set up a temporary port forward without user intervention. This allows other people to connect in to you, even if you don't know that they want to talk to you yet. To actually set that up, I think you need libUPNP or its equivalent in your language of choice. It's perfectly possible to have cjdns be the listening application, and have a different program entirely set up the port forward to allow access to it. (This is why some people dislike UPNP, since it basically lets all sorts of random programs reconfigure your router and poke holes in your firewall.)"

Yes in fact I disabled it to avoid possible problems.

I changed the logging option to stdout, but I don't know what you were trying to say with ""passing the right command line option"". I tried to start the executables in the program folder with a command line and every possible argument and anything there showed me logs of traffic.   So it seems that there is a lot of traffic going on in that port according to Wireshark, the thing I don't understand is why when I put in Zenmap:    nmap -sS -sU -6 -T4 -A -v fc5b:5404:1725:d73b:90:b32c:4228:1d19   It tells me:   Nmap done: 1 IP address (0 hosts up) scanned in 2.09 seconds   Raw packets sent: 4 (245B) | Rcvd: 4 (389B)   It says it is not ""up"" but at the same time I recive the packets back, so maybe is just working at it should. I will try it with Linux this night and test things with cjdcmd, because it seems better for testing this.   Using the cjdns admin api instead of mensing with the JSON is a great idea. We will do that!    The pull request with my script was actually accepted into the mainline a few days ago. See here.    Wow, awesome this will probably be very useful for us.   Oh great thing UPNP is able to work with a separate executable. It seems like an ugly hack, so I think I will encourage people to forward ports if they know how and put a checkbox in the program UI to disable UPNP. The languaje of our choice is C, the are sure lots of UPNP libaries for it.  Thanks you very much for your help! You are very kind!

I don't think the nmap results indicate that the computers can talk to each other. But it could just be the remote end is set to not answer pings. Did you try -Pn?  The wireshark output looks like they are at least trying to send data (since the packets are coming pretty quick and not all the same length), but it may or may not actually be getting throigh.

Even the traceroute with those link local addresses is the same. This is what I get no matter if I put the cjdns IPv6 or any other invented IPv6:  http://paste.debian.net/plainh/3fdc6bec  So it seems that it is not working, maybe is because both computer are in the same LAN, and computers in the same LAN should use anther method to connect?  In ncat I just used the cjdns address. When I use the IPv4 (192.168.1.2 and 192.168.1. 3) both computers connect using ncat without any problem, but I I try to listen to the cjdns address it says  'The requested address is not valid in its context' and if I get it listening just to the port and try to connect with the other computer to the cjdns address of the other it just says:  Netcat: .  And it ends, but no result in the other computer.  I think I will try with Linux and then with one guy of the programmers team to see if it is a Windows only issue or a issue produced because the computers are in the same LAN.  Oh well now that I think cjdns creates a network interface, but in wireshark I see it as Disconected:  Desktop:  https://img.bi/#/WLOLfol!IQMfhAawRsG9X4BQpwajeLlrpdefRkTttYkupkPW  Laptop:  https://img.bi/#/HwZBJzf!v4mdVjytjhQA5Qm7oqirwr66X0QSNknjTwLiVlQd  Edit: In Linux it also doesn't work, I think is related issue, in both computers, both running Desbian Jessie KDE in one the tun0 adapter shows and in the other not:  https://img.bi/#/YePcSAF!OFu6bT9TFuAbXiG95Oikndct1iIYEvUsTjjNNwlU https://img.bi/#/OcBKC1q!ayrgHvev9OU6datDbM1B7Ma8AVDDIiO731Eg2P53  I'm starting to think that it is caused by a hardware issue in the desktop computer."

darknetplan,2yghit,xbtdev,1 point,Tue Mar 10 06:02:08 2015 UTC,"Good questions...  Ill splice them into the FAQ   You need ISP connectivity to connect to other peers around the globe, however if you have direct links (wireless/wired/etc) between the two enigmaboxes ISP connectivity is not necessary.  I am going to try and rewrite the ""If the services reside on a cjdns node, all security is off."" section, it is not very clear Good feedback, It is plug an play, and the current website aims to try and show this http://enigmabox.net .  however when most people were confronted with our site they couldn't see the difference between enigmabox and a hardware VPN device.  This one is tricky. Cool, will do some more diagrams.   We have some on the wiki but it is not that accessible.   The box connects between you and the internet, you can either connect between your cable model and your wireless AP or between your switch and desktop lan port.   Thanks for the feedback, Ill try and expand on this as I think about it more today."
darknetplan,2yghit,easy-way,2,Tue Mar 10 14:29:00 2015 UTC,"FAQ  1.General   I'd like to help on the project.. what's the best way to join/sign up?  Thanks for the interest!  The first place to check out would be the wiki, here you will find information on are some good places to start Enigmabox security, threat model.  You can even learn how to build your own.  Also studying the cjdns routing protocol will give you insight into the broader aims of the project. Will this anonymize my use of the internet?  Enigmabox does not handle anonymization, instead we provide privacy.  While the network keeps no logs, traffic correlation could still be possible.  Software like Tor does a better job at anonymization.  Enigmabox used in conjunction with Tails(Tor Operating System) can hide your tor traffic and offer you even greater privacy. I'd like to be a part of this, but given that I didn't understand one word in three.. how can I help?  You can always start off testing. Report bugs as you find them. Make suggestions for changes. With the recent NSA stories about attacks on hardware, what steps have  you taken to ensure these boxes are not compromised from the get-go?  We use the swiss based pcengines open hardware designed APU. The bios firmware runs tiny core linuxs, and it is possible to reflash the device yourself.  The  schematics are available for these boards and they are widely deployed in network infrastructure. What would a rollout of this technology on a local scale look like? Are there local community groups?  There are local community groups!  You can meet some today.  Check out the list of meshlocals here.  While many of the participants do not use the enigmabox hardware the core routing protocol(cjdns) is the same! Are there any back-doors to the Enigmaboxes?  Never!  However you do not have to take our word for it,  the source code is available here.   2.Subscription   What do I pay you per month & what does it get me? How can I do it anonymously?  First month is free!  I am not sure of our monthly prices offhand(but I  am sure we can do month to month) a year subscription is $132.  We  prefer bitcoin. I have to pay to your organization to allow me to communicate securely?   No!  The subscription service allows you to connect to the broader internet out of the box.   Any local services or ones built between you and your peers do not require the subscription service (telephony, email, status). After 30 days, how much will it cost to use your technology?  Free!  The aditional fee is that of a VISP service which provides you out of the box VPN secured web surfing.  The meshnet network will always be free.   3.Tech   Is this more secure, less hackable than my OpenVPN setup?  Communications between two cjdns source and destinations does not permit surveillance. Even if every cjdns node in the mesh was hacked, Alice and Bob can still safely maintain a secure communication channel. This is typically not the case with OpenVPN because not every friend, irc server, and web server is running OpenVPN with on-the-fly communication. If the services reside on a cjdns node, all security is off. If the services reside on clearnet but pass through the comprimised cjdns gateway -- all security is off. Additionally, if the OpenVPN Client has their keys comprimised, an adversary can use the stolen keypair to make a connection to the VPN server. Once on the subnet (usually IPv4) the attacker offers malicious IPv6 routing advertisments which redirect your traffic to their sniffing computer. In many cases Client-to-Client mode is used to gain legitimate access to resources over a secured channel. What platforms does enigmabox run on?  Enigmabox runs on Openwrt targets.  Currently images have successfully been tested on pcengines APU/ALIX, BananaPi, RaspberryPi 1, and RaspberryPi 2.  See information on building for your own target here. Is the firmware protected against NSA intrusion?  Firmware is checksummed by sha512 and signed by a 4096bit RSA key, instructions on how to check can be found here.  Information on flashing enigmabox firmware can be found here. Which key exchange algorithm are you using?  Take a look at the cjdns soure code: https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/crypto/CryptoAuth.c#L35-L40 What is the source of randomness for RNG that produces keys?  The functionality of the cjdns random generator are described in detail here: https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/crypto/random/Random.c#L27-L89 How do you prevent NSA from doing interdiction and switching the device while on transit?  Rerouting a postal package to implant bugs manually - this is an  effort that is taken when you are under targeted surveillance. This is a  whole other story. What about bugs in your living room? Dedicated  observation teams? There are always easier ways to find a way around  encrypted network traffic if and when you are a target.  Protecting against targeted surveillance is not our goal in the first  place, because then you would surely have to take some extra steps. We  just provide a simple and secure way for communication, protection  against untargeted mass surveillance, so that you don't become a target  for targeted surveillance because you leave no cleartext traces. Can this type of service be ""stopped"" in the sense of governments prohibiting the use of this sort of technology?  They can probably issue a ban. Nonetheless, cjdns is designed as a mesh.  Once every wifi router out there runs cjdns, they will have a really hard time in blocking this! One path goes down, another route is found."

darknetplan,2yada6,tribusdelumen,6,Sat Mar 7 23:44:01 2015 UTC,I see mesh networks as something individuals own a part of. You buy your node hardware once and don't get screwed over every month by a service provider. It also (in theory) should raise the NSA's costs to monitor mesh traffic. Also I think a mesh network has more potential to connect people locally. Most cities have a bunch of local bands that never get heard. I would like to see people take their cellphones and make some crappy tv shows. I get at least as much entertainment watching weirdos on youtube as I do watching a mainstream tv show. Just cut out youtube and the ISP and let me connect directly to the crazies in my neighbourhood.

You need to do more reading so you understand what each does and how they all differ. Each one solves a very different problem in a very different way. Mesh is not VPN is not CJDNS. VPN and CJDNS both operate over standard Internet. Mesh connects you to your neighbors so you build your own private internet that be connected to the Internet or not.

darknetplan,2xosvu,thefinn93,9,Mon Mar 2 18:33:53 2015 UTC,"The problem with most of them is they aren't practical. What does ""wireless"" mean in this context?  Most think WiFi which are on 2.4Ghz and recently 5Ghz. These are omni directional and have a limited range as they are hindered by obstruction, especially from things with water in them like cinder block.   To give a example, I had a phone growing up that was 900Mhz. the base was in the center of a house with aluminum siding and I was able to walk a good distance down the road to my grandmother's house a good distance away. Meanwhile our WiFi couldn't penetrate the siding and we had next to no signal right outside the house. The higher the hz the less the signal will penetrate and the distance is also lower.  Most of these tests use directional antennae and have line of sight, which is not an application you would have in regular settings.  What's worse, is if they use IR or some other ""light"" EM, then ANY obstruction would break the signal."

Speed is one of the big things people point to as a disadvantage of a mesh. Most current ""mesh networks"" (really homemade prototypes) are built with what may be able to handle average wifi speeds in good conditions. But research like this lets us get a glimpse at the possibilities of the future, and we need to jump on it.   This means a mesh network could (and should) really work. Combine this with things like IPFS and metamesh's efforts, and I'm quite excited.

darknetplan,2xosvu,rubygeek,3,Mon Mar 2 18:33:53 2015 UTC,I'm not the most up to date on mesh networks but I think understand the basic concepts. Wouldn't the biggest issue with a mesh network still be the latency of hopping between numerous machines and less about the actual bandwidth capability? This would if anything show that a mesh network can handle more users and thus more activity without seeing a decrease in the speeds but the true limiting factor would still be the time of the actual travel distance/# of hops of the actual packets across the network.   Please correct me if I misunderstand.
darknetplan,2xosvu,xzxzzx,3,Mon Mar 2 21:42:16 2015 UTC,"Latency is a big deal for some types of applications, like video conferencing, but very much not a big deal for things like streaming recorded media, where sustained transfer rate matters more.   But you also don't need a mesh net to cover huge distances in the ordinary case - you can ""exit"" to low latency networks as quickly as possible. There's no reason to rely exclusively on the mesh other than in the case of censorship.  Also note that with high throughput you can work around a lot of latency issues. E.g. you can increase window size for connections so you can just pump data through for longer before you need an ACK from the other side. You can also look at new protocols that speculatively transfer data (we're already seeing this with e.g. HTTP/2 where the servers can pro-actively push out resources they know you'll need), as well as aggressive pre-fetching.  It won't solve things that are inherently live (like the aforementioned video conferencing), but it can make the problem easier (the more traffic you can afford to shunt over higher latency links, the more capacity you'll have to let latency sensitive traffic exit over lower latency links after as few hops as possible."

The regular price is ~520$ (that includes the box, a voip telephone and one year subscription).   Again, more info on what you are actually doing. Why do we need to connect to your systems?   To be able to communicate with other Enigmabox users. You can place phone calls and send emails, all end-to-end encrypted, forward secret, and leaking no metadata. You will get a device that protects your communication. And this is all distributed - there are no central servers, the address book resides on each box. And of course, there's a firewall built in with full shielding to the outside world.  There will be additional services soon, like, websites inside the network. Because there is already a webserver running on the box, we can build a distributed and encrypted Geocities ;)   You mention you are a non-profit. Some more info on that would be good. Do you plan on going full 501 (c)?   Ok, you got me. I have no idea what 501 (c) is. Actually we are not a non-profit.

I've also got several spare towers. I have computer and coding experience but I know virtually nothing of meshnet technology, beyond the goals. Would I need some sort of antenna, or does this just connect into the regular internet like a VPN? How do I get into the testing if I want to do that?"

Cjdns does kind of act like a VPN,  I may be describing this wrong.. but it essential sets up a distributed switch between everyone you peer with and your node.  When you connect with anyone you are making an encrypted tunnel to their node.  You sound like your in a similar situation to me, testing is simple.   You can setup linux/cjdns on some of your towers to which you can peer your raspberrypi / enigmabox. From there test the interface and the network, we need you!   Also if you have a unique SBC type perhaps you can test building the openwrt for that target.

And then even if they did, they would have to look over their entire tool chain to verify no backdoor. And then the jtag device they are using to program the on board flash depending on how they flash it. Oh, and they would need to make their own flash, dram, etc."
darknetplan,2wvta0,FraGGod,5,Mon Feb 23 17:22:51 2015 UTC,"It's not quite that bad.  You can put the core and many other things (especially network interfaces!) in an FPGA. You can play games in that FPGA so that it's very hard for a flash or DRAM chip, or even the FPGA itself, to recognize what's being stored in it or what operations are being done (and therefore hard for it to know what to tamper with).  We've all read ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"", but nonetheless it's very difficult and unreliable to introduce a corrupted toolchain into the wild, especially as open source. Ken Thompson could rely on his compiler being recompiled using itself, on a system he understood, with a specific processor architecture, etc.  That's way different from arranging it so that a tool that may be rebuilt under uncontrolled conditions, possibly by compilers other than itself, to run on who-knows-what architectures, will reliably recognize or corrupt code aimed at an unknown target. Especially when people other than you are changing other parts of the same tool's code in unknown ways all the time, using it to compile an incredible variety of code that does all kinds of weird things and may falsely trigger your insertion code, and not infrequently running debuggers both on it and its output.  Could a huge, tightly targeted, high-budget effort still nail you if you were building a deliberately obfuscated FPGA? Yes, probably. But it's much harder than, say, fixing it so that every copy of a commodity Ethernet chip will give you DMA access, over the network, to any machine it's installed in, when you control the fab. There, you know the environment, you know what the rest of the firmware is doing, you know what the frames will look like, you're using a standard bus architecture, etc.  Furthermore, subverting, say, almost every machine using an E1000 chip, is a much more valuable prize than subverting a few thousand copies of some random mesh network appliance, so it's going to attract more effort."

darknetplan,2wvta0,BostonEnginerd,2,Fri Feb 27 00:36:26 2015 UTC,"Communications between two cjdns source and destinations does not permit surveillance. Even if every cjdns node in the mesh was hacked, Alice and Bob can still safely maintain a secure communication channel. This is typically not the case with OpenVPN because not every friend, irc server, and web server is running OpenVPN with on-the-fly communication. If the services reside on a cjdns node, all security is off. If the services reside on clearnet but pass through the comprimised cjdns gateway -- all security is off. Additionally, if the OpenVPN Client has their keys comprimised, an adversary can use the stolen keypair to make a connection to the VPN server. Once on the subnet (usually IPv4) the attacker offers malicious IPv6 routing advertisments which redirect your traffic to their sniffing computer. In many cases Client-to-Client mode is used to gain legitimate access to resources over a secured channel."

Also, we looked at Bitcoin's blockchain for metadata storage, but OP_RETURN was too small (now 40 bytes). Systems like Factom may help change that.  I don't see a problem with different projects trying different things (using Bitcoin in different ways or trying their own systems). People should just support the projects and systems they like and trust and the most useful ones will grow and evolve. I'm not saying this is your opinion, but I feel like a lot of the emotions and ""free advice"" swirling around coins come from idealism and people looking to protect their coin value rather than encouraging innovation everywhere.   We use Zapier to let us know when Storj is mentioned on Reddit so we can also jump in and offer our side of the story. This way, folks coming to a thread like this can see opinions from all sides and make up their own mind. It also helps us clarify questions people may have (e.g. such as /u/Night-man asking if we've released our source). I don't see anything creepy about it. Whenever I respond I always strive to remain contextual to the thread. It's not like we're auto-responding with ads :)  I'm not part of the MaidSafe team, but I think they are on their ""testnet 2"" right now and are looking to launch their third testnet next month.  I can answer any additional questions or inquiries you have about Storj, though.   [Am a Storj core developer -- Josh]"
darknetplan,2ws84n,Utropics,2,Tue Feb 24 07:20:02 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the blog link. I've read your blog before, looking for this perspective.   In addition, SJCX is a Counterparty token, so it technically sits on top of Bitcoin already   I know, which is why I said you don't use Bitcoin directly.   but OP_RETURN was too small (now 40 bytes)   Bitcoin Core 0.10 will relay OP_RETURN of 80 bytes. But I understand the point that things were different when you designed Storj.   This way, folks coming to a thread like this can see opinions from all sides and make up their own mind.   I understand that. But suddenly showing up in a subreddit you don't normally read is the creepy part. It's like I'm sitting with a friend in a coffee shop and we're talking about Storj, and suddenly a stranger comes running in, wiping sweat from his brow and catching his breath, before he explains that what I just said is not accurate and he would like us to see his side of the story. I understand the intention, but to me, it's bizarre. Just the fact that you think your project needs this unusual sort of continuous damage control makes me skeptical."

I don't think the analogy is quite apt. At a coffee shop, you're having a private conversation that isn't broadcast to thousands of people. In addition, I think I'm in good enough shape that I wouldn't be out of breath if I was trying to creep in on your private coffeeshop fare :)   Just the fact that you think your project needs this unusual sort of continuous damage control makes me skeptical.   It's more general proactive PR than ""damage control."" Damage control insinuates we've done something wrong and are trying to cover our butts. The fact of the matter is that in this space there are lots of people who spread FUD, especially about younger projects. Because a lot of people are already on edge about scams and other bologna--and may not do their own research--this FUD can snowball unless someone comes in with facts.

If someone starts a thread (and has) claiming that Storj is a scam, doesn't have any code, and folks pile on with concern, would it not make sense to be proactive and respond?   If someone was actually running a scam, it would make even more sense for them to do exactly the same. Few good and honest projects are constantly faced with scam allegations. If you guys hadn't shown up in this thread to correct things, others would have - most likely me. Instead, we're having this conversation.  It just seems like something the Church of Scientology would do, and not a cool open source project, you know? Good software should speak for itself, and not need continuous, concerted PR efforts.  It's also hard to know if you're using this ""proactive PR"" system for more than calmly explaining facts. I don't think you're using it for vote brigading, but I have no way of knowing.

So every ~100 seconds, more attempts are being done as grains of send exist on earth.  That is brute force though! There may be cleverer ways.

If I request cat.jpg how do I know I'm getting the correct cat.jpg if I've never seen it before. You could serve me dog.jpg and just call it cat.jpg. But if I refer to it by its hash f5436... I can mathematically prove that I have the correct file. Furthermore I don't have to go to a central domain. I just ask my peers who has file f5436(cat.jpg), and then retrieve from anyone.

At the start it uses ipv4/6 to initially connect to the network, but that's it--it has its own routing built-in. They intentionally made it as easy as possible to transition to a mesh network where the users provide their own routing hardware (thus bypassing ISPs).  In fact, there have been many discussions on how to incentivize setting up your own hardware routers as part of payments apportioned out by the network (such as here). This would greatly speed up the growth of mesh networking for all areas. I'm in a rural area myself and I'm sure that incentivizing would be it far more likely to see rural areas being included."

First and foremost I'd say the issue they'll be facing will be availability: the Internet relies on servers that are always on; This is not so much so with a decentralized participant scheme, where users come and go. Having users leaving and entering the scheme means you will be losing pieces of the keys for what seems to be a ""threshold crypto"" scheme that they're trying to put in place. Hence, some files might cease to be decryptable, at least for the time being.  There are other problems, especially performance wise. They probably forgot that Intrusion Tolerance hasn't been put in place yet, in the business sector, mainly because it's too costly, too impracticle and takes too big a hold over performance.

I've got close to nothing to show for it and I've been doing it for the past 5 months... It's all about perseverance, I guess.  Anyways, please do keep me informed if you get to write this paper or at least start putting something together. I find ad-hoc to be a fantastic (at least in theory) model for power distribution. And, of course, one can only speculate how awesome it would be having this idea put in place by a small community of sharing-prone individuals."
darknetplan,2ue7vp,bernardosgr,2,Tue Feb 3 13:18:37 2015 UTC,"First and foremost I'd say the issue they'll be facing will be availability: the Internet relies on servers that are always on; This is not so much so with a decentralized participant scheme, where users come and go. Having users leaving and entering the scheme means you will be losing pieces of the keys for what seems to be a ""threshold crypto"" scheme that they're trying to put in place. Hence, some files might cease to be decryptable, at least for the time being.   Afaik their plan is to have four copies of everything, and when you leave the network the holders of the other three copies of anything you were storing make another fourth copy. That way it would be extremely unlikely that all four holders of the same randomly assigned packet would exit the network before the packet could be redistributed."

But Distributed Systems are a bitch when it comes to sharing views and retaining information for long periods of time.

How many copies are stored is determined by the rating of the nodes closest to you in XOR distance. Rating of nodes is a combination of how much storage space and bandwidth it contributes along with its uptime on the network. Because various nodes are constantly performing various network maintenance tasks under various ""personas"", data redundancy is frequently reevaluated and replicated as needed."

I just point out the obvious, they have been going for 8 years, with $12 million in funds and have 0 but sales pitches to show for it. I mean, after 8 years, they surely needed that money from the presale just before they were gonna release the final product. That's how you really want to sell something. Give it away cheap just before the launch to make all investors rich instead of releasing a working product and get a real valuation out of it. These people are just so nice! I mean, even the patents the file are ""defensive"", as opposed to all the offensive patents out there. They are really just victims.  Look at David Irvines twitter. Re-tweeting truthers, memes and coming up with great lines such as: ""Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds."" Just wow. Surely no man like that would bother with scams. He was even on Max Keiser just before the launch of the sale and Max just doesn't associate with pump and dumpers!  But sure, I need more research. Surely they had nothing to do with the mastercoin pump during the presale either. It's all mistakes and true believers will be rewarded once the product hits the street. And appcoins are the future to, not another way to scam: http://nakamotoinstitute.org/mempool/appcoins-are-snake-oil/  Hey, even Paycoin delivered a final product, so I guess nothing is impossible.

darknetplan,2ue7vp,BitUSD_StableInstant,6,Sun Feb 1 23:09:48 2015 UTC,"There are a number of initiatives in the bitshares ecosystem that can be of aid to darknet users. Some off the top of my head:  1) relatively stable cryptocurrency assets without counterparty risk... the ""bitcoin"" of USD, gold, silver, and others. These will be useful for helping the merchant platform of darknet mature by reducing the need to exit to fiat for hedging purposes.  2) .p2p, a decentralized DNS project. One of the Namecoin devs, indolering, has submitted a delegate proposal to help fund an interoperability initiative with traditional DNS, so .bit and .p2p could be resolved without plugins.  3) Another company planning to use bitshares / maidsafe, DAWN, makes open source hardware and has a router design. Open source routers will be crucial to a decentralized internet."
darknetplan,2ue7vp,dewbiestep,1 point,Mon Feb 2 01:02:34 2015 UTC,"You asked about BitShares. This allows you to send money to anyone, at any time, anywhere in the world, instantly, for (present cost) 3 cents per transaction. The ""money"" is cryptocurrency and, if you wish, you can keep it in one of the market-pegged BitAssets they have available such as BitUSD or BitGOLD. Holding these yields a small rate of interest, by the way. Plus, with TITAN, you can send BitShares currency or BitAssets using just a name/nickname (e.g. ""Bytemaster"") rather than an account number. Traceability is a bitch, though every transaction is part of the public ledger. In this way, it is like Bitcoin, not entirely dark, except that BitShares is faster and solves Bitcoin's volatility issues.   So if your idea of Dark is 'ink-black' dark, then BitShares isn't for you. But it does have some advantageous features for those who want to stay off the proverbial grid and stick it to the government using a decentralized approach that was carefully designed to be legally compliant. And I think that's right in line with what Maidsafe could also bring, if they ever are able to make the Maidsafe technology work.

darknetplan,2ufjb0,krashmo,1 point,Mon Feb 2 04:55:53 2015 UTC,"I am not sure how you would go about doing this. The whole point of having a mesh network is that there is no backbone. Once you centralize any part of the network, you have to trust that whoever is running that piece of the pie isn't going to abuse their power. I suppose you could open up your AP's and let anyone connect to them, but that would pretty much kill your business plan of charging people for access.  You could use your towers to set up backhaul links to connect different parts of the city, but it would be best to keep that separate from your business. Trying to combine paid internet access with a mesh network is basically putting yourself out of business."
darknetplan,2ufjb0,tacticaltaco,2,Mon Feb 2 17:31:54 2015 UTC,"Install Commotion and play with it. It's almost perfect for what you want to do. It can have a bit of a learning curve but if you're at all familiar with networking and OpenWRT it won't be hard.  You're on the right path of using a different band (5GHz) for mesh/linking nodes and another for client access (2.4GHz). I would keep that sort of setup.  You will not have much luck with 50 wireless nodes on a single mesh. For each wireless node in a mesh your throughput drops by half. At most you might get away with 10 wireless nodes (on a single channel). You will have to do something to reduce node count.   I would do two things: Have condos share an access point/node (less hardware to buy, cheaper for you). I would also try and segment the mesh. Have each floor (or building) be it's own mesh, then link each of those meshes together through discrete links.  Whatever you do, documented it and post it online. Plenty of people would love to read about a practical mesh deployment."

The kind of IPv4 tunneling that's necessary is built in to the protocol.  The key question, most likely, is going to be whether you get sufficient performance running the OpenWRT port of CJDNS on Ubiquiti hardware. You may, but I am not comfortable enough with the experimentation that has been done yet to assure you. The reality is that CJDNS is not a mature protocol yet, and although it is an excellent choice in theory, you may be better off with a more mature and well supported configuration."

It's a neat thought that whitespace licensing could lead to whole 20MHz chunks of spectrum at relatively low frequencies being available for consumer use... but thanks to digital TV reusing the VHF area that mostly just leaves 698-806 MHz, which should perform relatively similarly to the 900MHz ISM band. The ability to fit 5 full-width WiFi channels in said space is neat, but this doesn't really give us the ability to reach ranges we couldn't before without still needing licenses, and expensive equipment."

darknetplan,2t6e1k,jercos,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:59:11 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply! Your points and questions are just what I was looking for. It is only a collection of protocols at this point because it has not been fully developed. At this point, I just wanted to get it out there to see what people make of it. I am really busy on other stuff right now but this seemed like a good time to just get it out there.  What has been missed is that this is not a mesh network, it is a web of trust based solely on peer links. All that this system cares about is connecting to a trusted peer, and exchanging application data. This system never goes over hops to get to something, peers only. This is why it sits on top of a mesh, or uses a ham radio link, simply as a means to connect to a peer and exchange data.  The idea between the Hashed Update Tree is that any similar application data structures can be compared with a peer quickly by seeing if their hashes match. The hash of all parents change when data is changed in one part of the application structure.  All data in the tabbase is strictly structured into a tree to allow this. As for specific applications like collaborative document, I have not had time to go too far into the details of the use cases.  An offline transport might be a set of application data which is signed to a specific recipient(s) and put onto a USB stick. This maintains the chain of signitures for the Broadcast Trace Protocol to continue to function after this ""hop."" The recipient would load the data into their database and could view the content, set to share to connected peers, etc.   I'd like to see a clear statement of limited initial goals, and a basic roadmap to some sort of working application rather than an impossibly broad set of definitions loosely tied to the scope of completely replacing the internet in one go.   The initial goals are to see if this is viable through exposure. I have only put a limited amount of time into the working of the actual implementation. It would augment the internet at first, but in time, I believe all application data could traverse the web of trust rather than the traditional client-service model.    I'd like to see a description of solutions that ""GeoTabs"" provide to existing problems, or new problems that it solves.   This system does not rely on infrastructure at all. There is no need for DNS or even an address space like IP (aside from crypto keys). It goes everywhere, any data link type should have a module for interface. This could be used as a vast layer on top of the internet to manage META DATA. For example, instead of trusting that reddit is keeping proper tabs of the voting on a controversial post, it could be tracked by GeoTabs where every vote can be traced to a point in the web of trust. It could also be used to provide any other kind of metadata about anything else found on the standard internet. I will keep thinking about this, thanks for the well put thoughts."

darknetplan,2t6e1k,otakugrey,3,Wed Jan 21 18:37:08 2015 UTC,"I have heard of these and they are awesome projects! Gilgamesh, like firechat, looks kinda like what I imagine untrusted/unsecured broadcasts to look like. If you were at a rally you would perhaps peer with people but classify them as a stranger, with restricted filtering perhaps only accepting stuff related directly to the rally.    The power of GeoTabs would be in that you aren't identified by the mac address which could be spoofed, but by your private key. Also you would be able to see a topography of trust to see how you might know anyone you bump in to. Content from such a rally like video or pictures could begin to flow outward through trusted peers to the greater internet, with the chain of trust built along each path.    Byzantium is totally awesome! but it is still based on the client-service model of data flow which gives a certain power to content providers, a certain expectation of centralized elements. At any rate, GeoTabs could flow over top of it, providing a smooth layer of trust and stability to the flow of data.  I2P I think is like Tor. Awesome system as well, but it supposes the client-service model where we don't know anyone ""out there"". GeoTabs is like a social media Internet. Your only forms of contact are with people who you know and who are interested in what you have to say. So content spreads often more locally, but can explode outwards if it is popular in a controlled broadcast (BTP)."

darknetplan,2svreh,dukejer,3,Mon Jan 19 15:30:09 2015 UTC,"Yep there's no reasonable chance for adhoc wifi on Android. You need root, cyanogenmod, and one of a very small handful of devices whose wifi drivers support it.  TL;DR adhoc on Android is a clusterfuck.  We still have infrastructure wifi though, and bluetooth, and wifi direct, and traditional 3g/4g. Mesh networking on phones isn't about building a mesh purely of phones, it's more about building a mesh, and getting the phones on it in a pragmatic way."
darknetplan,2svreh,schmars,2,Wed Jan 21 00:17:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, the primary focus of the cjdns app should be to build connectivity protocols that do not require root. I think both ""building a mesh, and getting the phones on it"" and ""building a mesh purely of phones"" are both desirable, although the latter seems much more restricted in terms of connectivity options. I am hoping their insecure socket BT and peer-to-peer WiFi APIs will allow for some ad-hoc phone networks to happen. In terms of ""getting the phones on it in a pragmatic way"", we have to come up with with a secure protocol that allows peering to take place in a systematic and automated way."

Especially if they are off the cell network and transmitting over Bluetooth instead using encryption.  Serval has a broadcast text which I thought was good.  I sent a broadcast which was handed phone to phone until the message reached everyone.  It even stored and transmitted to other phones that were off at the time.  Once the phones connected to someone that had the text they received it also.

(Freenet does heavily filter the pages to try to prevent those kinds of exploits.)  As for not hosting certain types of files, you're pretty much defeating the point of a distributed network. This is another thing Freenet does well, too: a file's ""URL"" is also a decryption key for its blocks. You can be hosting a bunch of random blocks, but they're all encrypted, and without also knowing their URLs, you can't read them. That gives you plausible deniability and ensures you (or some crummy web server) won't accidentally open them. Plus it means you can still benefit from the distributed hosting for ""secret"" files (as long as you can keep the URL private)."

Hyperboria is the name that's been adopted for the CJDNS meshnet that was established to facilitate development and testing of the protocol, it is not a generic term and would not apply to any other meshnet.  As for internet gateways on Hyperboria or any CJDNS based meshnet, there can be as many as there are people interested in providing the service, on any sized meshnet. The fact that you would ask that question, by the way, suggests that you have some misunderstandings still, as there is no actual causal connection between the size of a meshnet and whether or not there can be a gateway on it.  If you clarify what you had in mind when you asked that question, perhaps we can better help you understand.   Would that be legal and cause bandwidth constraint for the ISP?   If you are providing an internet gateway service on a meshnet, then you presumably are purchasing internet access from an ISP in order to do so, so I can't see why there would be such issues. You would probably be no different then any common proxy service, legally speaking. If your service agreement with your ISP doesn't allow that, though, they may choose to discontinue service.   Sorry for the questions. I'm just now doing research on this.    Not a problem at all, ask away.

It's completely open, and the CJDNS protocol even auto-peers with all available nodes when running on top of the MAC layer as intended.  What makes it hard for others to connect to it right now is merely the need to manually setup UDP tunnels when using it over the internet rather then connecting directly. Yes, an automatic system for establishing UDP tunnels could be set up, but it intentionally hasn't been, and for good reasons (that have been discussed many times in other posts). This seems to have been written by someone who doesn't actually understand how this all works and why. :(  What we should do, by the way, is improve how we configure CJDNS and add peers, make it much easier to exchange credentials and establish new UDP tunnels with others when we want to. Getting together a complete, easy to use web based GUI would make all the difference. Combine that with a searchable database that current users willing to peer can register on with an email address and location (nothing automatic, just a way for people to find and establish communication with potential new peers), and that should be all we need.  Side idea: Perhaps have a set of peers that are available for only a short, limited amount of time that anyone can request a ""temporary pass"" on. This will allow for new users to get on and try it out, communicate with the community, and establish more permanent links. Worth considering in my opinion."

The boxes will discover one another and will initiate (or rather join) a network where every box has a unique identifier, IP, MAC address, or something other.  The boxes will deliver information from one another similarly to how TOR network routes users packets, primarily focusing on path finding and optimization, and security, privacy and reliability. I love how the Bitcoin network is extremely resilient and secure, and I'd like this to be as resilient and as secure as Bitcoin.  If you connect the box to an internet connection, your box will become a gateway node that users from the inside of the network (the meshnet) can use to access the outside network (the internet), and vice versa.  To incentivize people to connect those boxes to the internet at the early stages of the project and overcome the network effect (or rather to create one for the project) users will be able to provide internet access to other users for a tiny fee - most people nowadays have ""plenty of internet"", utilizing only small portions of available (or in some unfortunate cases, allowed) bandwidth which can be essentially sold to other users who need internet.

Each box could communicate to other system devices as well as connect to a traditional internet connection to share encrypted bandwidth. Essentially a gateway to the new mesh network using the internet as a high bandwidth back door to transmit data over long distances and in quantity.   If this is organized properly (beyond my intellect to even describe!) It could even provide a basic income for anyone who would want to participate.  Financial transactions using the built in currency would be ""taxed"" to keep run-away inflation from breaking the value of the currency. Early on this will be out of balance but it should be able to be built to do this.  This part would be tricky but the total value of the currency should be linked directly to productivity of all the users.  If productivity goes down then the quantity of currency decreases through higher ""taxes"" if it goes up then quantity increases through bigger payouts to bandwidth providers.   I think blockchain should be able to keep people from faking this traffic but I could be wrong.    Edit:  The taxes could be used to decrease the price of hardware for new users of the system so if productivity goes down there will be an immediate drop in the price of new hardware increasing the availability of the system.  If productivity goes down, the taxes would drop the price of hardware to zero or negative so anyone can join the system, have money to buy real goods and services day one and do it all for free. This would inject new nodes and new people and new bandwidth into the system which would increase productivity.    I think my head is going to explode."

What sort of throughput do you expect going across the mesh (farthest node to farthest node, the greatest number of hops)?  What sort of use case do you envision for the box?

darknetplan,2r07hb,tacticaltaco,3,Thu Jan 1 16:35:05 2015 UTC,"That's a good overall model, not quite sure the average Joe will care about bitcoin (""don't people use that to buy drugs online?"")   I'd like to believe that Bitcoin is here to stay, it's evolving faster than ever and grabbing a lot of attention (for good and bad). I believe Bitcoin is as important as the TCP/IP and later the WWW - people may be scared or unfamiliar with it today, but that's just the nature of new things.   What sort of throughput do you expect going across the mesh (farthest node to farthest node, the greatest number of hops)?   Not sure exactly - If it is possible to create a database of existing nodes the same way that the DNS network provides a pretty large list of existing websites, regardless of where they're physically located, the distance between nodes is unlimited.  Think of the following situation; You want to transmit a message from London to New York. You know the address of the recipient, but now you need to actually transmit the message.  Even in today's terms you will not be able to do it with a single hop, I don't think it will be possible with the proposed network either, instead your message will travel from node to node, some nodes will be domestic boxes, others will be corporate boxes that profit from ferrying information across the oceans.  My ideal setup is that being a node in the system does not reflect your role or size in the system. Small nodes will be able to transfer that much information in a given minute, so that's what they'll do and they will profit accordingly, other nodes will be giant ISP and datacenters that will be able to provide large bandwidth and they will obviously profit far more than the domestic box.  That being said, I'm not sure if there are technical limitations to a number of hops - my understanding of computer networking is rather limited, so I'll be needing help on that front.   What sort of use case do you envision for the box?   Initially providing internet access to homes and mobile phones - anyone can put that box in their home or business and start providing internet and get paid for it.  A device the size and shape of a smartphone could provide the same functionality on the go - allowing you to bring such a device to a public areas letting anyone who needs it connect to it.   Does every household have one?    Probably, since you want to have a reliable connection of your own at all times.  That being said I think that eventually these ""Devices"" will simply become a function inside every device that needs internet connection, similarly to how WiFi is today, so your phone will probably have one, you computer and your TV.   Does a single box cover a neighborhood?    I think that it will be possible to utilize many different technologies, WiFI, Bluetooth, perhaps FM radio, etc'.  The early devices will probably be based on WiFi and provide a similar coverage.   Would users throw it on a shelf in the house? Installed on the roof? Installed on towers?   It's form factor today should take a larger footprint than a WiFi router, and there are cellular links that you can buy from your mobile carrier that connects to the cell tower and provides you with a wifi - and they're pretty damn small.  On the other-hand perhaps some areas will require building large tower capable of transmitting over large distances, specifically in rural areas. Perhaps Google will one day plug it's Loon project :)"
darknetplan,2r07hb,dukejer,2,Thu Jan 1 17:32:15 2015 UTC,"JFYI: You probably won't get any RF path (one hop or a million hops) across an ocean. There are ways but they're either wildly impractical (HF; a bunch of floating nodes) or way too expensive (satellites). Loon might provide a solution but it's taking engineers at Google a while to solve that.  The maximum number of hops in IPv4 (Time-To-Live) and IPv6 (Hop Limit) is represented by a single unsigned byte. So you can only do 255 hops. I can think of ways around that limit but any internet needing more hops than that is going to suck.  You will want to incentivize moving traffic but not necessarily setting up more nodes. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere but without wider adoption (can I buy my lunch with it?) it won't motivate people. It is too intangible and it's too hard to exchange for goods/services. I hope that changes but that's the real problem it faces today.  For each node in a mesh (sharing the same frequency) your throughput will drop by half. Two nodes might have 50Mb/s between them. Add a third and you get 25Mb/s and so on. The more nodes the slower things get. There's no way around that. You can spread things out to different channels/frequencies but then that segments the mesh and you'll need bridges between those segments (single points of failure). If you had a mesh that covered a city and it took 200 hops to get data from one side to the other you would be lucky to get anything but basic text through, maybe voice if the network weren't congested.  The idea I've always kicked around is that you setup a small mast/tower per neighborhood. Those towers form the mesh on 5.8GHz. The towers then provide service to small devices in peoples homes on 900MHz (or whitespace if thats ever possible). The small household device provides WiFi (2.4GHz) to end users. This isn't a perfect idea but it tries to spread out spectrum use and reduce nodes in the mesh.  You've got a lot to learn on RF and mesh networking. I recommend getting some hands on experience to get a feel for what is realistically possible. Get some gear and setup a small mesh. Deploy it. See how different frequencies propagate, what bands are crowded as hell, how you have to place nodes to maximize coverage.  I think for us to create our own internet we will have to borrow from the existing internet's playbook. We can't do this just over RF. We will have to run fiber. We will have to put down cables. The internet is built and setup the way it is for a reason (it works)."
darknetplan,2r07hb,benhylau,2,Thu Jan 1 18:37:02 2015 UTC,"Interesting - thanks for bringing this up.  I'm not sure if all of the tech needed to deploy a network like I'm proposing, but with proper research and development those obstacles you mention will be only that - obstacles.  Every technology has it's advantages but also its limitations, when there is viable technology that addresses your problems in a sufficient manner, you adopt that tech, when there isn't one, you either settle for something else and compensate with another piece of tech, or research and develop a new piece of tech that does answer your problems in a satisfactory manner.  Either way, looking at the technology we have today, and the technology we actually use, this seems absolutely feasible. And yes, integrating existing infrastructure is absolutely an option - I didn't suggest throwing away thousands of millions of miles of cables hidden away in our streets - they do serve a purpose and no reason to throw them away.  Even if a project such as this will only solve the problem of having a reliable internet WiFi that you can connect anywhere you travel on the planet using a simple payment mechanism that anyone can access and use to provide you with internet, that would be a revolution in itself."

darknetplan,2r07hb,smilesbot,2,Fri Jan 2 22:51:58 2015 UTC,"After thinking about this for a while the only thing I can come up with is still in the realm of academic study (some of it is just barely not science fiction).  If we are trying to stay wireless in order to avoid the cost and difficulty of laying our own infrastructure then here is my pie-in-the-sky version that could potentially do what you want.  There is a substance called a Bose Einstein Condensate (BEC), it is some of the coldest material known to man.  It has a property that physicists are finding quite a lot of fun, that property is it will become quantumly entangled with another BEC that is precisely the same temperature.  Quantum entanglement is a weird, WEIRD, phenomenon that seemingly breaks the laws of Newtonian/Einsteinian physics.  Basically, a disturbance that interacts with the first BEC will immediately be communicated to an entangled BEC without regard to the distance between them which allows for faster than light travel, also called Quantum Teleportation.   Scientists are starting to get much better at teleporting larger and more complex items but they are pretty darn good at teleporting electrons and photons.  Theoretically one could set up a bank of BECs in closely guarded locations around the world.  Each BEC would be entangled with a specific BEC in another location effectively allowing information to pass between.  If one was able to make a system of stable and affordable BEC communication that person/company would very quickly make billions of dollars, but I digress.  This solves the problem of interconnecting geographically disperse regions.  But what about local?  Well, you would need two things: 1) Amazeballs compression technology and 2) Amazeballs2 error detection and correction technology  Both are necessary to reduce the amount of traffic transferred.    Also you would necessarily need to abandon the mesh topology and adopt a leaf and trunk structure. where, say one person on each block would have a connection to the BEC bank and every one on that block would connect to that person's network.  Here is the kicker, you ready?  Replace the fanciful BEC communication stuff with fiber optic cabling and you are looking at the exact model the cellular phone industry is running.  If the neighbors ran a cable to your house instead of giving you WiFi access ... BAM! Now you are looking at how all ISPs work.  All of this is a long way to say that it is impossible to re-create the internet's functionality without using the technology the internet is currently working on.  Trying to subvert politicians' and IPS' control over the internet is not possible by just building a decentralized mesh or a fancy magic box.  Your time and efforts would be much better spent in trying to affect change to a system that is progressively shifting to a system of control rather than a system of liberation and freedom.  There is still time left, we CAN affect positive change.  But it is going to take the masses rising up and stating unequivocally that we will not tolerate interference in our internet.  Individuals in power have known throughout all of human history that information is power, and he who controls the information the people see will control how those people act and think.   Also  If you really want to know who is screwing with your internet ... follow the money. I promise you; there will always be a story there, just waiting to be told..."

Your comments on compute power pushing data toward the user are correct, however I am not seeing how that affects the conversation.  WHERE the data is stored is not as important as who controls how it is moved and consumed.  If, as you suggest, you could have all your data easily/securely accessible (a situation which I am sad to say cannot happen) that would still not address the problem of accessing data that is NOT yours.  Streaming music, movies, etc.  Streaming your OS (this is coming BTW). And, getting back to the OPs statement, making sure you have access to the type of data that can be very important.  Case in point.  Recently some students in Iran took a stand against their government.  The government's reaction to this was to attempt to cut off all their access to the outside world.  They shut off all social media for the entire country.    The main way for the students to organize and exchange information was cut off.  The students were able to use services like ToR to get around the block, but it was dangerous and not easy.  This is the type of control OP is (very rightly I might add) campaigning against.    In short, it doesn't matter very much WHERE your data is.  What matters is who controls how it is moved and consumed.

A better, easier to use (preferably web based) configuration and management interface. It's way to much of a pain in the ass to use CJDNS right now, especially for those who are not entirely comfortable editing text configuration files full of JSON.

It is indeed some kind of time concept. However, If you want to capture the ""relativity of time"" in the network, a global blockchain won't do. I don't know of any case right now where this might be important, but I think that we might find it important at some point. Let me demonstrate. Assume that two nodes x,y are in the network, and also there are two other nodes a,b. Assume that node a,b both broadcasted messages. It might be that x saw a's message first, and y saw b's message first. That means x and y will have different subjective orderings of a and b's messages. Both of those ordering are correct.

In other words, I don't want the government coming in and closing all the roads down that lead to Target while allowing Walmart to control all of the products that can be delivered on those same roads.

That's the sort of thing that gets you arrested if you do it without the complete collapse of society, so probably not very practical.  If you just want to use a point to point coax run for a high speed connection though, ""MoCA to Ethernet"" or ""Ethernet over coax"" adapters do just that fairly affordably, and can often do so (by design) without disrupting cable TV signals travelling alongside on the same cable."
darknetplan,2qgbns,jercos,2,Sat Dec 27 02:34:28 2014 UTC,"It's not even remotely possible. The cable tv/Internet network infrastructure is not a passive piece of wire. For any cable segment out on the street, a loop consists of 10-20 bi-directional active amplifiers separated every 100 meters or so, each powered by 220/440VDC running through the backbone. If the power is out, then so is the cable.  Further more, cable modems are incapable of communicating directly with each other. There needs to be a 'master radio' (the head-end) that manages authentication, channel management, QoS, etc. The network hardware expects the head end to live at the feed point, which you're never going to get access to anyway."

In any case, the service area covered by a given CMTS is more like an entire town (or more), rather than a mere ""neighborhood block.""  The layer 1 network of the cable modems alone is a massive coaxial network centered at a ""cable ISP building"" (the local hubsite or headend building), where the CMTS can then verify MAC addresses and/or forward DHCP requests to the appropriate servers.  As I understand it, DSL worked/works in the same way, but with an analogous DSLAM (Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexer) device that connects a network of DSL modems to a telco exchange building that was often the same building handling the entire geographic exchange area for regular voice telephone calls.    The centralized nature of these systems is what gives ISPs control over the ""last mile"" internet connections, when they seek to violate network neutrality.    The argument can be made that this centralized topology is necessary due to the physical layout of our telecommunication network infrastructure, but as the majority of the companies responsible for this layout have since merged (or want to) into the regional monopolies we see today, then it is likely that any decisions made in the development of our public infrastructure that would encourage or even favor any sort of decentralization (devices and network topologies), would have been consistently and repeatedly avoided."

That address won't change on you, it's effectively static, but it's not issued by any central authority, it's derived from your public key, which in turn is derived from your private key, a completely random piece of data. You can brute-force keys to get a nice looking prefix (similar to brute-forcing .onion addresses), but it will always have some random-seeming properties.  If your question is inverted, and you're asking if a user can connect over the internet to hyperboria using an ISP that provides a dynamic address rather than a static address, yes. A static address gives you the ability to give that address out to others, allowing them to connect in to you, but once a connection is formed the direction in which it was started doesn't matter. If your router handles UDP pseudo-NAT (most do automatically), you can connect out to a hyperboria internet peer who has a static address, and if your ISP-given address changes, you'll just need to reconnect (which should happen automatically)."

darknetplan,2pvxss,RainbowPopsicle,8,Sat Dec 20 21:11:28 2014 UTC,"I hope we can in the future. There are a ton of hurdles to overcome.  To get a usable bandwidth it'll take a wide, powerful signal. That means regulatory problems and size/power issues. We can't use ISM for it (too noisy, not enough power legally allowed). Amateur radio is a logical step but then there's the issue of encryption (not allowed). Either things will have to be done illegally or a new ISM band with higher EIRP limits. If we're doing a big powerful satellite it's going to be heavy, that'll cost a lot to launch (even cubesats aren't cheap). It'll cost even more if we want it in a geostationary orbit (as good comms satellites often are). If we can't do geostationary each ground station must have a tracking antenna, that's a small expensive nightmare in and of itself.  On top of it all is the inherent latency of covering the distance from ground to a satellite. You'll never expect to see better than 2-3 seconds.  Satellites are totally cool and have a certain panache, but I'd look to undersea cables first. Less glamorous but they're the most sensible."

darknetplan,2pvxss,RainbowPopsicle,3,Sun Dec 21 02:55:59 2014 UTC,"I forgot about balloons. It's not easy and I would've called it too complicated up until I read about Google's experimental Project Loon. It is trying to provide internet access with a fleet of balloons. The gist of it is that zero pressure balloons can stay aloft for a very long time. Get enough of them circling the globe and you should be able to get general coverage. They don't cost a fortune to launch like satellites and because they're closer to the ground latency shouldn't be such a big issue.  That said I'm very interested in seeing how they tackle a few problems. Steering them is nearly impossible. The best you can do is maybe adjust altitude a bit to catch different wind. I'm also curious to know how many you have to put up to adequately cover the globe, or at least provide hops over oceans for traffic. How they're continuously powering the system. Solar? Wind turbine? It's gotta be lightweight and sturdy. How does the cold of upper atmo hurt battery performance/lifespan? What sort of radio equipment and antennas they're using (sectors? an omni?). I bet power is tight so it's probably low-ish power. Do the balloons mesh together or do they operate through some sort of land-earth-station the way satellites do?    It's not impossible but it's one helluva engineering project."

Here is a company that sells a helikite which is a hybrid balloon kite used to hoist atennas.  If they can hoist large atenna they should be able to hoist a small lite weight router and small antenna. http://www.allsopp.co.uk/index.php?mod=page&id_pag=40

The throughput isn't all that high, and a useful mesh network on a global scale would likely involve buying a LOT of spectrum, which is expensive. laser based communication is a proven technology, and would provide much higher bandwidth without the expense of buying so much spectrum, but would dramatically raise hardware costs and wouldn't work well when it was cloudy.  Launch prices for CubeSats are ~$100,000 each, and this will likely decrease dramatically in the near future, so I do think that your idea is valid on a small scale.

I saw a few ideas about how to deal with incentives: (Some kind of reputation like in EigenTrust / Sending messages to yourself from time to time through specific neighbour and making sure that you get them back), though I don't have a complete solution at this point. Please tell me if you find a good idea.  All That said, note that ""The Distributed Post Office"" in its raw form is broken from the security perspective, and should probably not be used in the wild.  If you put this kind of mesh network in the wild, you have the risk of adversarial nodes taking the position of ""highest"" node in the network for one hash function or more. (The adversary can invest some time to get a good enough hash value for his public key). In that case, a very large fraction of messages sent could be blocked by the adversary.  You could use this kind of network as a small private network (though we already have a few pretty good solutions to do that.)  Two things that probably need to be addressed are: (1) Choosing the landmarks in a different way, so that the adversary will have hard time controlling all of them. (2) Routing the messages in a way that does not put too much load over the landmarks.  I know of some ideas to solve (1) and (2).

The idea is to replace the clearnet with something better, not just to build something on top of it.  I'm not sure what you're looking for with ""free ipv6 blocks"". Most meshnets, including Hyperboria/cjdns, use the fc00::/8 block which is already set aside for unique local addresses (in this case, local to the meshnet) using an unspecified allocation scheme. cjdns specifies a scheme that makes allocation consistent and essentially random. The chance of a collision within this block is sufficiently small that it won't be a problem in the foreseeable future.  As for connecting cities with long-range wireless links, that is the eventual plan. Firstly, though, we need to get meshnets set up in more cities. After that, we can look at making wireless links between cities to replace bridged connections on the clearnet.  Edit: spelling"

darknetplan,2p9l61,15ykoh,2,Mon Dec 15 04:21:49 2014 UTC,"Well to be clear, when I say service, I'm talking about architecture. I'm saying that in the engineering of the ideal ""global mesh network"", access to non-mesh addresses (like the Internet) should not be built in to the design of the mesh network. Access to those addresses should occur through network bridges, or something similar to them, just like how your home modem is a bridge from your local network to the internet.  Personally, I believe that the ideal global mesh network would exist side-by-side with pay-for-speed internet services. I imagine a world where you buy a mesh network access device that looks like a wireless router, and you can also rent or buy a modem from a traditional ISP and plug it in to the mesh network access device. Access to the mesh would be unregulated and free - you just need the hardware - whereas you'd pay the ISP for their service as we all do today. That way you can still stream videos and get high speed access, but you can ALSO get censorship-free 100% neutral mesh network access. But yes, it would almost certainly be slower than traditional internet... or at the very least it would have a higher latency."

Okay, let's actually not focus on that right now. Let's just say that the drug cartels and the terrorists will lose access to TOR. Will that seriously hurt their ability to do nefarious things? No, not at all. They've done it before TOR and they'll do it after TOR.  Now let's say the ""regulation"" system ends up kicking the people in dictatorships and persecuted minorities out of TOR.

A ""corporation"" is a government fiction, the entire idea of a ""corporation"" is predicated on a strong, centralized government.  Now, you can think of ISIS as a stereotypical ""evil corporation.""  Hell, they even have shareholder and income reports.  They are rather like a government that hasn't farmed out the menial business stuff to corporations yet.    Next question: SO WHAT?  ISIS exists because the United States government armed bloodthirsty rebels in Syria in an attempt to topple the Assad regime.  ISIS is currently attracting recruits at a prodigious pace since the CIA is ceasing payments to ""friendly"" Syria fighters, and ISIS has significant cash reserves to pay their fighters.  This is a business.  However, Iran is currently running air strikes against ISIS.  ISIS has their hands full.  They are not and will not be a threat to America, nor will they be able to spread beyond the US-centered chaos in that relatively small area of the Middle East.  ISIS is an empty bogeyman, and they would never have existed in the first place if the US were not meddling in foreign civil wars.  For the sake of the discussion, let us pretend they were able to recruit operatives in the United States.  Let us say they were able to team up with, say, the Sinaloa cartel and mount hit-and-run attacks on banking and police infrastructure in the US.  What would we do, then?  After all, they could receive funding from the great ISIS reserves in the Middle East, and we'd be dealing with a very serious problem in our own back yard.  Do I have this right?  Is this the kind of scenario you hint at?  If anyone were to try this here, we'd just shoot them.  In America, firearms ownership is extremely widespread, and many people carry loaded firearms every day.  Unless you live in one of a very small number of highly-regulated areas (D.C., New York...) it is very likely that you pass many armed citizens just on your way to work.  There are noncriminal things we call ""unethical"" but no-one gets hurt.  (Things like the Anarchists' Cookbook come to mind).  These things may be ignored.  If someone takes action on these things, we kill or imprison them.  Seems pretty simple to me.  Am I missing something?"

darknetplan,2p6z04,MaunaLoona,2,Sun Dec 14 15:58:47 2014 UTC,"The counter argument here is that an ideal network empowers all users, not just the ones you approve of. On a small scale what you're proposing is very reasonable, but at the other extreme Comcast owns a whole bunch of nodes in the current network and doesn't ""give them any of [Comcast's] resources"" where 'them; includes anyone who doesn't pay them, uses above average speeds, pirates, etc.   If you can choose not to support child porn, what stops Comcast from not supporting the poor/politically opposed/whatever?  It's certainly problematic. The problem extends elsewhere, too. North Korea, like them or not, is a sovereign government that controls/supports all international connections. If the people owning the connections/nodes (NK) can choose what gets through and they are true believers that will choose to blacklist anything not North Korean, what recourse is there for the NK citizen who isn't a true believer?  I think the solution is encryption. Encrypt all traffic so that no one can know what traffic goes through a node. Hopefully that makes it clearer that what you support is an anonymous, world wide, trustworthy network that helps all users even if some may use child porn, be poor, or want to leave NK.    Especially considering that actions still require acting, it may (have to) be sufficient to stop unethical data production and disregard unethical data transmission/storage/consumption. Example: Experiments led by Nazis empirically concluded what kinds of torture would and would not kill victims e.g. how long could someone be drowned without causing long term damage. They used this data to punish undesirables for existing and later to kill more efficiently. These acts were unethical and a world war put an end to them, but the data still existed. It has since been used to better understand the human body and save lives.  It's not always an easy argument to support (for cases like child porn) but I believe data is neither ethical nor unethical, as is its storage/transmission/consumption. Maybe. Like I said, this whole thing is problematic."

darknetplan,2p6z04,MaunaLoona,1 point,Sun Dec 14 03:35:52 2014 UTC,"Meme:       A meme (/ˈmiːm/ meem)  is ""an idea, behavior, or style that spreads from person to person within a culture.""  A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.   The word meme is a shortening (modeled on gene) of mimeme (from Ancient Greek μίμημα Greek pronunciation: [míːmɛːma] mīmēma, ""imitated thing"", from μιμεῖσθαι mimeisthai, ""to imitate"", from μῖμος mimos ""mime"")  and it was coined by the British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in The Selfish Gene (1976)   as a concept for discussion of evolutionary principles in explaining the spread of ideas and cultural phenomena. Examples of memes given in the book included melodies, catch-phrases, fashion, and the technology of building arches.   Proponents theorize that memes may evolve by natural selection in a manner analogous to that of biological evolution. Memes do this through the processes of variation, mutation, competition, and inheritance, each of which influence a meme's reproductive success. Memes spread through the behavior that they generate in their hosts. Memes that propagate less prolifically may become extinct, while others may survive, spread, and (for better or for worse) mutate. Memes that replicate most effectively enjoy more success, and some may replicate effectively even when they prove to be detrimental to the welfare of their hosts.

Though I guess you can choose not to share known CP with peers and degrade the network's quality for that information.  There could be communities that create lists of bad addresses per category and one can choose lists to be locally blocked. This may be possible with crawlers too. A browser may have default settings to enable a couple of those lists so that the network doesn't grow strong by non tech-savy users. This assumes that a blocked address will remain the same and can't be easily changed.  But I'm sure that there's plenty of holes in this too.

Mining bitcoin costs more power, so even assuming the device is capable of doing so, that seems academic next to the point that the ePlug is specifically intended to reduce loads that may well be around 1 watt themselves. If I have 30 ePlugs (one for each light or switchable device in my house), am I now burning ~30 watts constantly? Seems self-defeating.   This is not the place to dispute any claims to ""The world's first"" of anything, but without more solid data, this seems to be PR-oriented vaporware sitting in the context of other PR-oriented vaporware. Giving us a list of actual technologies used wouldn't let us steal it out from under your feet any more than telling us your smart car ran on gasoline, and it would potentially garner something you'll need in order to sell to a technically literate market: trust."
darknetplan,2ov61x,jercos,6,Wed Dec 10 17:24:21 2014 UTC,"I just want to point out that in a connected ""smart home"" scenario, temperature can be just as telling as a light status in determining occupancy status.  Even basic programmable thermostats these days allow setting the temperature back during both the night and while occupants are away during the day, so a temperature drop or increase during the day that matches or is more drastic than a nighttime change would be a fairly certain indicator that nobody is home.  Some thermostats these days are going further and using things like motion sensors to determine occupancy, so those systems would be more accurate than even a scheduled temperature change."

My own heating is manually controlled, but one could certainly build up patterns from that, in particular regular absences where the heating is never on during a particular day of the week... that's more of a long-term issue though."
darknetplan,2ov61x,jercos,-4,Wed Dec 10 17:34:34 2014 UTC,I totally agree. We put two 90 degree motion sensors in there along with the temp and light sensor. Combine that with the rt clock and timer and I just couldn't find a way to make it any more customizable than that. We'll be uploading all of the code to gitchain too so it can be hacked and forked. I want the ePlugs to be as open as possible so if frign google or somebody comes in and tries to close them up and implement control structures again that we could just fork it and never have to use their closed systems again. Believe me I have thought long and hard about what they will try to do to me when this thing gets picked up by the mainstream. I have a family ya know so disrupting has its ugly side too.
darknetplan,2ov61x,f3lbane,8,Wed Dec 10 20:11:04 2014 UTC,"I... don't think you understand the point they are trying to make. If you're trying to suggest that your devices promote privacy, including environmental sensors completely destroys that claim.

darknetplan,2ov61x,jercos,1 point,Thu Dec 11 10:40:35 2014 UTC,"If ""everything can be hacked"" then your ePlug can be broken into, which would give a malicious individual access to those environmental sensors, which would then allow them to invade your privacy. Risk profile."

darknetplan,2ov61x,geoffreyhach,3,Wed Dec 10 17:52:49 2014 UTC,Yeah many parts seemed odd including the writing style/word choice. It would be nice if someone else knew the device because the inventor isn't very helpful at explaining it.
darknetplan,2ov61x,Khalila1,-5,Wed Dec 10 18:11:41 2014 UTC,"The faq that I put on startjoin will have to remain relatively generalized so that the masses can even understand what the ePlug can do, but here on the darknet and bitcoin reddits is a whole different story. Try to explain bitcoin to grandma, or cryptography for that matter.

darknetplan,2ov61x,Khalila1,9,Wed Dec 10 20:04:49 2014 UTC,"In that case, the Bitcoin thing is irrelevant as jercos originally stated. I mean it's only 1W of power and there isn't much of anything in my house that consumes less than that. At €40, I'm not going to be buying 100 of them.  My advice is to scrap the crypto-currency features especially if doing so reduces cost. It also makes the device simpler overall, you know, for grandma. Speaking of grandma, she isn't going to be an early adopter of this, so you shouldn't be writing your pitch like she is. You should be answering questions such as, ""Can an ePlug get Hacked?"" and ""Why does an ePlug use Blockchain tech?"" much more fully. We just need far more technical details."
darknetplan,2ov61x,Khalila1,-4,Wed Dec 10 20:30:22 2014 UTC,Think about the people in Africa with very little internet access at all. I also think about all the people in China who are forced into the heavily censored proxy servers. Over 75% of internet users worldwide are victims of censorship and I for one have had enough of it. As for the technical details you mentioned.. I have to keep it generalized in words that the masses can understand or else the mainstream media will never pick it up and then we'll never get crypto and meshnet to the masses. I just can't think of any other way to word it for them.

Once again, you aren't targeting the masses...yet. If you can't even convince tech-savy people who already have interest in these types of things, then you will not be able to convince people in Africa and China to spend €40 on it.

I don't want that to happen. There's wars and riots in like every country now and no end in sight. bushs 'mushroom cloud' comment still rings in my head, in my opinion, these guys are frign nuts. we have to do something. those that don't have the 40 euros when these are officially mass produced and sold thru the electrical vendors will hopefully at least have a little btc to buy one, hence my reason for pushing crypto so hard. this is like a quadruple edged sword."

Just a reminder, you haven't listed specs, you've listed concepts.

darknetplan,2ov61x,Yasea,-2,Sat Dec 13 15:08:15 2014 UTC,"Agreed, I think the mining side of the ePlug is probably it's weakest point right now because of the limitations that we have with cpu horsepower. It's a nice addon if the ePlug isn't doing anything else at the moment, but the real coin will come from farming out it's unused resources, I mean like how much hard drive space do you have available right now? I'd say I have like 40% of my hard drive space is totally free, so why not farm out the excess for it and get paid in crypto. I want to get crypto into the mainstream masses too, not just meshnet. If we all start using crypto currencies, what will happen to the euro, dollar, yen and such? Exactly. The people can rule once again. Man, I'm with ya. It's only vaporware if nobody wants something like this. I'm just a guy who works at home, loves his little girls and wants to change the world and with something like this I really think we can do it. Get both crypto and meshnet out there.

darknetplan,2ov61x,Yasea,10,Wed Dec 10 20:40:13 2014 UTC,"Fun fact, you could build a full rack compute cluster with the very latest and greatest high-end CPU technology and it wouldn't compete with even a consumer GPU mining rig. Storj and similar will have impressive bandwidth requirements, and burning flash memory repeatedly is expensive in the sense that the device will have a much shorter lifetime if it's ""farming"".  You also ignored point 2, 3, and 4, and most of 1.  To be completely honest you sound a little schizophrenic with that attitude... ""the banks and Google are out to get me! only I have the power to invent a device that will be better than them and free our minds! Can I have 40 euros, man?""  I'm sure you don't intend to sound that way, but if you want to stand up to a corrupt system you need to be able to grab the hearts of the common man, not just someone who already knows the system is corrupt, and answering all the questions not just the ones you want is helpful.  Your device will not cure cancer, your device will not live forever, if you successfully make your device it may well be obsolete in 9 months. It will have flaws, bugs, production issues, people won't like the UI, the device will break in some way you didn't expect in some oddly common scenario... not because of anything wrong with you, but because that's what happens to new devices and new technology. Accepting that, embracing it, and not selling what you can't deliver, being ready to tell people what your device can't do will help possibly even more than telling them the amazing things it can do."

darknetplan,2ov61x,durrandi,6,Wed Dec 10 17:39:00 2014 UTC,"7Gbps is around the range for the WiGig spec. I presume ken Code is looking to implement this device with future technology (which is to say, actual practical 802.11ad chips, or if he's as ambitious as it seems, might be planning to fab his own?), which would mean ""if you have WiGig at home, this'll connect to it"", or possibly even ""only WiGig supported"". Presumably WiGig wouldn't be used for actual meshing given 60GHz is about narrow enough to be stopped by a sheet of paper.  Alternately, the whole thing could just be a cloud of buzzwords, with WiGig as another tag to make the vaporware more tempting."

I had an interesting chat with a guy yesterday that said we don't need to go down to the 14nm size but I still disagree cuz the gang box in the wall is super slim in america but nice and wide here in europe. so, if we can just make one board that fits into all of them around the world and make them small enough so that the cost will be affordable for the consumer (the business plan calls for a sub 40 euro range) then our chances of getting the meshnet out to everyone is finally a real possibility. 7gig is lan side and lower frequencies take it outdoors. see my comments below on the isp's.. the technology didn't even totally exist for my plan until just about a year ago. crypto tech, farming out sys resources for coin, meshnet for the masses, etc.. this thing has been intense to say the least. see my updates on the startjoin page too, tryin to keep everybody in the loop on this.."

ISP and CDN providers have no choice, snoops like the nsa are finished if we can get isp's broken up.

darknetplan,2oo47q,en3r0,3,Tue Dec 16 18:46:10 2014 UTC,One thing that would be nice to see is an app that allows direct real time voip communication when latency and the hop count is low  but switch to a half duplex like push to talk with a higher hop count.  Maybe even have an encrypted store and forward over a rhizome like file system when the latency is extremely high.  The voice message could be signed with the user public key and be listened with the private key.  The encrypted file could then be passed from router to router until it reaches its destination.   In emergencies messages could be stored using the phone number of the recipient until they picked it up.  I am sure in situations like Haiti and Katrina it would have been nice to record a message for a loved one to let you know you are OK and how to get a hold of you once communication is back to semi normal.

You get many compiters connected on the same network using routers and range extenders/repeaters, you then wipe the routers of their shitty closed-source-crap firmware, install beautiful OpenSource OpenWRT and install cjdns ontop of that, then the people with computers will install cjdns on their computers (at their will, but for security sakes, they should, plus if you are on Windows, you can't get it, so wipe Windows as Windows itself is a virus.), theneveryone becomes a node, asd for Androids and iPhones and any other evices not mentioned, they cannot install cjdns, they are normal connectors/leeches, onec the nodes are setup your are ready to go.  But wait, how can I broadcast a signal very far, do I use an antenna, or just routers and repeaters.  Also having many routers on the network not configured correctly can mess the network up?

If you pay $10 a month extra, your calls are put through right away (Like today).  If you don't pay, people calling you (And your calls out), will have to wait for 5 rings before the call is actually put through to ring the other end.  Or, Verizon decided to charge every other telco a fee to ""speed their calls"", if they don't pay the fee to Verizon, all calls will ring back for 5 rings before being connected.  ""Net neutrality"" made that impossible, and not allowed.  Because phone companies are ""Common carriers"".

Or rather, one that is regulated by a free market.    This subreddit is dedicated to organizing a decentralized alternative to traditional ISP's.   For me, the biggest advantage of that, is the FCC keeping their nose out of other people's business. Perhaps the author of the article meant the opposite of what he actually wrote.  As far as I'm aware, the FCC has never threatened to 'overturn' net-neutrality laws, but rather, to enforce them."
darknetplan,2oh49o,xbtdev,6,Mon Dec 8 12:17:26 2014 UTC,"Or rather, one that is regulated by a free market.   That train left the station a generation ago. The current ISPs are already government sponsored monopolies. The free market, in this sector, is loooong dead.  The only way to restore it would be to take away all the free right-of-ways, special deals, and straight up monopolies that have already been given, and to extract back from them what value they gained as a result of that unfair government favoritism. Only then will a competitive free market return.  That's never going to happen, though, so real competition is no longer feasible. Regulating what is already a government monopoly is all that is left."

darknetplan,2oh49o,dicknuckle,4,Sun Dec 7 12:06:53 2014 UTC,In the US most people only have access to one or two high speed ISPs (4 - 10mb downstream).  There is no free market.  It is astounding how quickly the telecoms reconsolidated after the Bell breakup.  I remember what it was like when the 1996 Telecoms Act was still in effect.  In far north suburban Chicago I had the choice of a half dozen DSL providers.  Competition-enforcing regulations are needed to foster a free market where none currently exists.
darknetplan,2oh49o,ISeenEmFirst,3,Sun Dec 7 14:45:14 2014 UTC,"Courts have ruled that using current definitions, the FCC cannot enforce them, so they have effectively been overturned for the time being.  As long as the regional owner of the lines is the only one that can viably or in many cases even legally offer internet services, the protections of a free market do not apply here. In the meantime, while we're waiting for that nigh impossible goal to be achieved, victims of these monopolies are having the content they paid for filtered, throttled, and held ransom with no recourse."

Netflix actually has multiple strategies for mitigating their massive amount of traffic (including a Netflix cache server to install closer to the customers), but bigger ISPs with competing services would rather just slow Netflix traffic than to use a Netflix provided solution to provide better service to the customers."

darknetplan,2oczf2,dukejer,6,Fri Dec 5 13:07:11 2014 UTC,One thing to consider is that cjdns might not immediately pick the best (i.e. direct) route.  Another is that the CPU might be a bottleneck for the crypto operations. You can get a throughput estimation running the following on the router:  cjdroute --bench
darknetplan,2oczf2,schmars,1 point,Fri Dec 5 13:15:09 2014 UTC,I figured the crypto and CPU might be the problem.  Batman-Adv with Adhoc Encryption gives me about a 30% performance penality.  I turned off Adhoc Encryption for CJDNS and still get a 60% or more performance penality.  It does not appear to be the link speed affecting the router.  cjdroute --bench on a TL-WDR3500  results: Finished in 68402ms. 17543 Kb/s
darknetplan,2oczf2,schmars,2,Fri Dec 5 13:41:57 2014 UTC,"One more thing that I just noticed, is that you're using SCP there, which adds an additional layer of crypto. Try netcat instead, for the least possible overhead.  Example: http://www.lars.meshnet.berlin/netcat-via-ipv6-link-local.html  Still, throughput is obviously an area that could use some improvement."
darknetplan,2oczf2,PSkeptic,1 point,Sat Dec 6 18:08:27 2014 UTC,"Thank you schmars,  I will use netcat for testing.  I cannot use it for production at this time because I have a lot of processes tied to ssh, certs for auth, rsync and scp.  I will see if I can fold netcat into my firmware in the future."
darknetplan,2oczf2,PSkeptic,3,Sat Dec 6 19:27:42 2014 UTC,"I would not enable wireline ecryption (Ie, wifi encrypt) if using cjdns.  There's no point, as all traffic is already encrypted."
darknetplan,2oczf2,OmicronNine,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:56:12 2014 UTC,I use ad-hoc encryption with batman-adv.  Still what type of security is there with cjdns when using autopeering other then a firewall?
darknetplan,2oczf2,PSkeptic,3,Fri Dec 5 22:27:45 2014 UTC,"Wireline encryption doesn't protect the machine (Firewalls).  It prevents (Or, deters) snooping of traffic.  CJDNS is encrypted at the wireline level already."
darknetplan,2oczf2,PSkeptic,2,Sat Dec 6 01:23:02 2014 UTC,I understand that cjdns prevents snooping between end nodes but it does not stop an autopeer from using open ad-hoc from joining a private mesh.  Encrypted ad-hoc does help prevent outsiders from joining.  I have been using mesh networks to set up private security cameras.  It would be nice if autopeer had the ability to use a shared key before joining.

Then figure out how to go up and over or around obstacles.  If you're doing a basic point to point link you will want directional 5.8GHz. It'll have an easier time squeezing in narrow LOS situations.

darknetplan,2o9ha4,ToMetric,2,Thu Dec 4 23:39:46 2014 UTC,Covering a 10 mile radius means you need an omni directional antenna with very high gain and a very strong transmitter or many directional antennas and radios. There is a big difference between covering an entire circle (radius) and covering just a slice of it (directional) in equipment cost.
darknetplan,2o9ha4,angryRake,2,Fri Dec 5 02:29:23 2014 UTC,"I don't think I'd disagree with you.  To cover a circle large than 200 ft radius, you'd need more than one radio  with sector antennas (For many reasons, not just RF signal strength, but collision domains, etc etc).  And, because there's difference in cost doesn't mean it's not possible.  It just means it costs more."
darknetplan,2o9ha4,PSkeptic,2,Fri Dec 5 14:15:43 2014 UTC,"Yes but then it is not ""pretty easy"" as you claimed, which is why I clarified."

Meshnets are designed to be point to point, or peer to peer. In effect, you would connect to your neighbors Mesh node, they would connect to their nearest node, and so on. Each participant is basically their own mini-ISP.  There are several experimental protocols to do this, CJDNS being one of the more prominent ones driving a network called /r/hyperboria.  In order to guarantee net neutrality between all users, centralized points must be eliminated. It is a step to a fully decentralized Internet.  Other technologies, like Bitcoin (or more simply, blockchains), are also fast becoming an integral part of this decentralized future."

darknetplan,2o6o5z,Axiomiat,6,Thu Dec 4 02:54:27 2014 UTC,It is an independent network that doesn't need a centralized Internet provider. Each neighboring node acts as a provider instead for a connection. CJDNS automatically finds its peers and uses the most efficient path for traffic.   Hyperboria at the moment is basically an experimental next generation Internet.

Also, probably billions of dollars are invested in current infrastructure. There are cell towers everywhere, satellites, fiber optics, large datacenters etc.. And it's not just about politics or economy: Current design is hierarchical AFAIK, and this allows us to connect at better speeds and have a lower latency.

darknetplan,2n65qb,IWillNotBeBroken,7,Mon Nov 24 00:57:08 2014 UTC,"Thank you! I think I get it now.  To quote CJD:   The routing protocol works by routing a packet to the node that you know of who's IPv6 address is closest to the target, but their link state and their distance is closest to you.  That means that nobody needs to know the way to everything, and yet the packet will end up at a node who's IP address is close to the destination. All nodes need to do is keep track of other nodes in the network whose IP addresses are close to theirs. These are nodes that are not 1 hop away from them, these are nodes who are far away from them, whose IP address is close to theirs.   So here's how I'm beginning to understand this:  So when my node (A) wants to find out how to route to B, it will look at the peers it is connected to and see which one has an IP address that is numerically  closest to B, and ask that node for a next hop. That node will look at the nodes it's connected to, and contact the node that is numerically closest to B, and ask for a next hop, etc. This process means that each hop along the way, the IP gets closer to B until finally it is B.  That's fine, but I don't quite see where the DHT comes in to this. CJD says that nodes need to ""keep track"" of nodes that are numerically close to them. These will not be 1-hop away, but far away. Presumably this is done via the DHT, so I guess my next two questions are these:   What does it mean for a node to ""keep track"" of other nodes that are numerically close to them? Why is that necessary? If the route can be calculated by getting iteritively closer with each hop, why does anyone need to know anything besides their own IP address and those of their immediate peers?   Thanks for all your help guys - this stuff is really interesting!"
darknetplan,2n65qb,loptr,3,Mon Nov 24 10:08:19 2014 UTC,"With a DHT, your location in keyspace has nothing to do with geographical (or even  topological) location.  So you keep track of the other nodes' keys (IPs) which are close to your own.  They are very unlikely to be close to you in geography or topology.  You do this because that's how a DHT works -- when someone asks about a key which is similar to yours, you can answer and point them to someone even closer, or the actual owner of the key they're asking about.  You keep track of nodes farther away than your immediate peers in order to get away from flooding.  If all you knew were your peers, you have no idea which is closer to the destination, so you'd have to flood and be very bandwidth-inefficient.  There are plenty of papers on Kademlia and the Kad network, if you're interested in learning more about that type of DHT."
darknetplan,2n65qb,thomasbomb45,3,Mon Nov 24 13:25:20 2014 UTC,"The idea is that a packet is routed to a node that will most likely have the best knowledge of a route to the destination, to reduce the number of times the packet has to be routed. In theory, the nodes that know how best to reach you are the nodes with an address that is close to yours. However, in practice, these nodes are hardly ever close to yours geographically. This means that your node needs to periodically probe the network to find nodes that are far away that have similar addresses.  Then, when someone nearby those nodes wants to send a packet to your node, they will logically send it to one of the nodes nearby them that has a similar IPv6 address to you. If you are in contact with that particular node, then that node will know a path to you, and it will be able to route the packet. If it doesn't know the route to you, it will send it to another node that it knows of with an even closer address to you. If you are in contact with that node, it will be able to route the packet efficiently. And so on.  Eventually, if a packet cannot be routed to a node with a closer address to you, then it will just be dropped. This is to prevent routing loops."
darknetplan,2n65qb,henny_mac,1 point,Mon Nov 24 17:32:33 2014 UTC,"Ok, so let's see if I understand this correctly...   Each node keeps track of routes to other nodes that are numerically close but (probably) geographically far away. If I want to route a packet to someone who I don't have a route for, I'll send it to whichever of my local peers' address is closest to the destination's address. If they don't have a route, they'll forward it to whichever of their peers has the closest address, etc. Eventually the packet will end up with someone who knows a valid route to the destination.   So that makes sense. One last thing I'm not clear on - if my node needs to ""keep track"" of others whose addresses are close to mine, how do I do that? How does my node know the route to others who are numerically close, but probably several hops away? I could ask my peers, but how do they know? Ask their peers?  I guess maybe (answering my own question) the network would originally have started out with a flood of hello packets, to establish the initial routes, then gradually the flooding would subside as more routes are learned, and the routing gets more targeted. Is that right?"
darknetplan,2n65qb,IWillNotBeBroken,2,Tue Nov 25 10:28:37 2014 UTC,"The first part of what you said is exactly right. As for how the nodes originally get in contact, I'll let someone more knowledgeable answer that. I am under the impression that even from the start, there is minimal flooding happening."

darknetplan,2mgds5,PSkeptic,2,Sun Nov 16 20:42:21 2014 UTC,"Yeah, this is the biggest issue.  Meshnets are something between a LAN and an Internet in size, and being decentralized, local, and user-driven, but not meant to be used over an existing connection means it doesn't really share any use cases that would have previously driven development of such a thing. (That is, it's not like a LAN party, or a business WAN, or a VPN, or Bittorrent, etc...meaning there's not much to out there that could easily be repurposed.)   The market is also really small-- essentially single communities that decide to adopt-- so there's no wider market demand for it.   For better or for worse, there probably never will be unless the software and hardware stack becomes relatively standardized and installation + maintenance becomes easy enough that people in the general population could do it without too much fuss. (Like routers: most people will never open their router interface-- may not even know it has one-- but only the most grandma of users can fail to plug a few cables in and let DHCP do the rest.)   And until that happens, it remains a very small niche interest among the already niche group of advanced IT people. (Didn't quite know what to say there, since most terms don't cover all the jobs that might give expertise, and not all the people who have or could have the expertise are IT professionals.)   I think Torbrowser and VPNs are probably a good model for usability to follow. Both of them implement what is actually a complicated-ish kind of networking while offering mostly out-of-box usability.   Particularly, something like OpenVPN's configuration files/certs would be useful. Coupled with the ability to buy standardized hardware with pre-configured software, it'd be a huge step if you could buy whatever serves as your node, and then be able to obtain a configuration file from another member of the mesh network and just plug in a USB drive with it to join the mesh.   But then I'm no expert, maybe it's out there and I missed it.  I looked into mesh networks briefly but everything looked so fragmented and early stage, and the learning curve so high even for a technically adept user, I just marked it down as ""keep tabs on progress"".   If you ever decide you'd like to write the comprehensive ""ordinary user's guide"" from your experience learning everything, I'd be more than glad to help in writing it.

If you have any tourism attractions then all the better.  This approach however would need to include a plan for expansion.

(That's the part I left out.)  Because the hashes would all be one-way, if the person knew both my and another random person's email address, they would be able to validate whether we are contacts, but the block chain would not reveal any new addresses to spammers.  To your point about collisions, almost every hash algorithm has that potential. Increasing the digest size can significantly reduce the likelihood (to near zero), but the possibility theoretically exists.  My point was that even if a collision did occur, the result would only be approving emails sent to another intended recipient."
darknetplan,2mbc39,rlconkl,1 point,Tue Nov 18 02:31:29 2014 UTC,"Oh I see your point now.  It would probably work ok.  But what about the scheme proposed for bitcoin addresses a while back (sry no link atm):  The ""address"" you give out to the public is actually a seed which can be used to generate public keys to use to send messages to you.  iirc it's combined with a random seed.  This way, no two people are likely to have the same actual address, making it hard to confirm a relationship.  But if you combine that with publishing hashes, you're going to have a ton of hashes, so that probably doesn't work either."

darknetplan,2mbc39,dokumentamarble,1 point,Fri Nov 14 23:56:47 2014 UTC,"What's the benefit of the entire network participating in the filtering, instead of just your mail server?"
darknetplan,2mbc39,frankster,1 point,Sat Nov 15 00:03:01 2014 UTC,"Firstly, your enthusiasm is laudable; secondly, many have pursued the dream of elevated email but come away cynical, and I hope that doesn't happen.   Use some public ledger, perhaps a blockchain, to define a whitelist of which asymmetric keys are allowed to email you, and have the entire network ignore any message that isn't correctly signed by the sender and on the recipient's whitelist.   What this does is publicize your network of whitelisted contacts. That may be more dangerous than the spam was annoying because it publicizes the identities of people Grandma trusts, which is the holy grail for spammers.  Even if Nigerian princes are seeking your help for matters of financial import, consider that it's sometimes valuable to get mail from unknown addresses sometimes. Or at least leave this up to the local Mail Transfer Agent (your server).  Anyway, you may be interested in using the existing email system, with refinements on the MTA side. One tactic on the receiver's mail reader would be to automatically check any message that contains a GPG signature. Does the sig align with something from a keyserver? Good, then the sender spent computational resources, a proof-of-work. HashCash has advantages over this, though. Back in the 2000s, you may have sent an email only to immediately get an automated response from a spam filter. The response simply says, ""reply to this automated message from the same email to be added to Grandma's whitelist"". The proof-of-work there is that spammers won't have time to maintain their own email accounts and respond. Hashcash has advantages over this.  HashCash is a proof-of-work in the email header. This proof of work is actually a short text token, so it adds only a small amount of overhead. It's computationally expensive to generate, but cheap to check, so the sender should be a human willing to wait several hundred milliseconds in order to contact you. My understanding is that this can also be tuned on the receivers side, where you discriminate against proof-of-work that appears too easy. Mass messages cannot fulfill the proof-of-work, and are filtered by your mail client or possibly by the MTA. SpamAssassin may have rules for HashCash, or at least that was the plan 5-10 years ago. Interestingly, HashCash is nowadays used in bitcoin mining, whatever that is.  So, let's go through a version of HashCash where the receiver sets a bar for how long the proof-of-work needs to be. Remember that this is just part of an email header, so there are no modifications to rickety server-side daemons. Sender sets the priority of a message to High, her mail client runs for a few seconds as it generates a long proof of work. Your mail client sorts incoming messages, assigning any without a hash to priority zero. A penalty priority could be assigned to messages with fraudulent hash values, and a blacklist of fraudulent hash values is easier to maintain than a public whitelist of email address keys.   Obviously, if you start to receive what you consider spam or otherwise unwanted messages from an approved sender, all you have to do is revoke that permission. The network will then refuse to deliver the messages, so they won't even waste any bandwidth getting to you to be rejected.   So, this brings us to the situation where Grandma's account is hacked. You want to revoke permission, but only for enough time for her to fix the problem. That's currently cryptographically difficult. There isn't any demand for a system that allows you to revoke permissions for a specific address, until the end of time. For a spammer, setting up a new (free) email account is trivial, but for Grandma this is a big fucking deal.  Lastly, email hashcash is not widespread, so if you can implement some interesting new features, it could catch on. Fork to your heart's content"
darknetplan,2mbc39,jecxjo,1 point,Sat Nov 15 01:08:21 2014 UTC,The functionality already exists. If everyone signed their emails and generated webs of trust you could easily create your whitelist without having to do much work at all. When someone trusts a key from a spammed you remove them from your Web of Trust. As long as you toss all unsigned email then you will only receive email from real users.  The reason this doesn't work is because most people are lazy and do not practice safe computing. Will you ever get your grandparents to use PGP? No. Will they ever do any more work than type in your address and press send? No.

Most users might make a key but then when they go to a public machine to access their email and realize that anything encrypted is not accessible and they cannot send anything because they don't bring a copy of their key with them...they stop using it. Don't get me wrong, having a company like Google get behind PGP would be a great idea. The issue is that their whole interface is built around not needing local software beyond a web browser. Once you have local files that must be backed up and carried along to any other machine you use, you will lose most of your users."

If you wanted to transfer clear text to your phone to be encrypted then you run the risk of the clear text being viewed by others.

darknetplan,2lmpqg,schmars,5,Sat Nov 8 00:13:29 2014 UTC,How much space does cjdns take up on a router? Lots of cheap TP-Link ones only come with 4/8MB flash which is enough for OpenWRT and a few small packages. You usually have to pony up for one of the slightly nicer routers if you want more flash.

darknetplan,2lmpqg,GreyTheory,2,Sat Nov 8 00:20:50 2014 UTC,"Does cjdns take any account of link quality when routing?   If you mean Wifi link quality, no it doesn't yet. It might in the future, but there are no plans for the short term, at the moment.   Does it support dual radio? Backhaul meshed on 5Ghz. Client access at 2.4Ghz?   Yes, all of them. It doesn't care about the underlying Wifi mode (or type of link), as long as it can send Ethernet frames over it."
darknetplan,2lmpqg,jercos,2,Sat Nov 8 00:27:42 2014 UTC,WiFi link quality is unlikely to be implemented as cjdns physical layer agnostic.   Transport later link quality may be implemented in order to route more effectively (and reduce latency).
darknetplan,2lmpqg,GreyTheory,2,Sat Nov 8 01:05:08 2014 UTC,"Transport later link quality may be implemented in order to route more effectively (and reduce latency).   It already somewhat is implemented. Currently the best route is selected based on the route's reach, which is a combination of successful pings, and a few other metrics. I can't go into great detail here because it's an area of cjdns that I'm not yet very familiar with."
darknetplan,2lmpqg,IWillNotBeBroken,2,Sat Nov 8 01:10:24 2014 UTC,physical layer agnostic   This doesn't have to mean physical layer ignorant. Work is already in progress to notice when a WiFi card changes SSIDs/channels/etc. beyond simply disconnecting for example.

darknetplan,2lmpqg,keo604,2,Mon Nov 10 21:01:10 2014 UTC,"cjdns has no idea that it's using wifi (or ethernet, or a udp tunnel).  The only ""client"" and ""backhaul"" delineation is in your policy of how you connect nodes together. The way CJDNS is configured, the peering statements are not tied to an interface, so you can't say ""only connect to backhaul_node over this 5GHz interface"" (without jumping through hoops of multiple instances and routing tables) -- if you can also reach that backhaul_node on your 2.4GHz radio, cjdns will happily connect via that interface as well.  When there are multiple connections to the same node, cjdns will pick the best one at the time to send traffic over.  I see it periodically flipping between 2.4GHz and 5GHz when I have dual-wifi-connected nodes where both have good connections.  If you want the strict separation of a-client-cannot-connect-via-5GHz, either run two cjdns instances on the same node, or run two separate nodes and connect them via ethernet -- different configuration files means that you can have differing peering policy."
darknetplan,2lmpqg,keo604,2,Sat Nov 8 12:59:09 2014 UTC,"That's not entirely true, peerings are bound to an interface. If auto-peering is enabled on all interfaces, you lose this granularity, though."
darknetplan,2lmpqg,kpcyrd,2,Sat Nov 8 13:16:09 2014 UTC,"As in at the time cjdns started, my best route to peer-ip was out the intA interface, so if my routing changes so that a different interface is now preferred, I'm going to drop that peer and re-establish over the now-preferred interface?  That actually might explain the flipping I've seen."
darknetplan,2lmpqg,keo604,3,Sat Nov 8 13:44:41 2014 UTC,Thanks for posting this. I would be interested if it's worth running it on top of batman-adv in a city mesh scenario?  How do you automate having multiple gateways to the Old Internet and using the best outbound tunnel possible?  (And making it as automatic as possible so average users don't have to mess around with manual peering etc.)
darknetplan,2lmpqg,kpcyrd,5,Sat Nov 8 00:27:48 2014 UTC,"Running on top of batman-adv is one of the options. With batman-adv doing the routing work, it will still add the benefits of privacy and address authentication.   Each cjdns node would automatically peer with all other nodes in the mesh, over Ethernet, since a batman-adv mesh acts like one big switch. From cjdns' point of view, all nodes are one hop away, while batman-adv takes care of the underlying routing.  Please note that we haven't tested Ethernet peering on large batman-adv meshes, of say dozens or hundreds of nodes.  In my Berlin neighbourhood we're working on running cjdns both over batman-adv, and alongside batman-adv. This will offer cjdns peering to everyone in the mesh, over batman-adv as described above. As soon as they have a direct wifi neighbour running cjdns, it would start seeing the more performant direct peering  There are also a handful of auto-peered cjdns nodes on Freifunk Hamburg's city-wide mesh, which is about 500 nodes big I believe.  Regarding multiple gateways, it is not easily possible with cjdns alone. Although someone in the community built for their direct neighbourhood what you're asking. I believe they used one of the typical IP routing failover solutions. I'll try to get them into the thread, might take a couple of days though."

darknetplan,2lmpqg,anarKyLibre,4,Mon Nov 17 15:28:42 2014 UTC,"Freifunk Hamburg here, I'm responsible for the cjdns mesh in hamburg. Although our batman-adv network is 600 nodes strong, there're only, like, 4 devices that do cjdns, yet. 2 of them are well peered servers that run batman-adv themself. There's a bridge on top of bat0 and I've enabled autpeering on that bridge. The other devices are connected to batman-adv enabled routers and send/receive broadcast messages to/from other cjdns nodes. Since cjdns thinks all peers in the mesh are one hop away it can't do any routing magic. We don't run cjdns on our routers, yet. Mainly because our router images are already very tightly packed.  Like schmars said, it still adds the benefits of privacy and authentication. Running it on top of a batman-adv mesh is perfectly fine to get started and works like a charm.

How do you make it failsafe? what happens if someone starts a rogue DHCP server? what happens if someone takes someone else's IP address? (stuff that's usually easily solved within a small network) what happens if someone floods the network with broadcast packets? how do you route to the Old Internet? etc.   Are you running 4 or 8 meg images?

darknetplan,2lctak,PSkeptic,10,Wed Nov 5 14:41:14 2014 UTC,"The CJDNS protocol IS the reference design. The 'protocol' changes every commit.   No it doesn't. Newer versions of the software are usually compatible with older versions more or less. This is both good and bad. It's good, because mistakes made now will not be forced upon us at a later date, and it's bad because of obvious reasons.   The fact that CJDNS lacks a consistent protocol makes it essentially useless.   It's not useless, because there are people actually using it. People set up services and route traffic RIGHT NOW.   You can't prove or formalize anything about the protocol because of its fluidity   That could be good or bad. It is bad that you can't formalize anything, but it's good because it is fluid.   You therefore have no guarantees about performance of any part of the system   What do you mean exactly? This isn't true for almost all systems.   No hardware can be made that works with CJDNS because the standard changes so often.   Yes it can. CJDNS runs on x86 and ARM hardware just fine. The only things that need to be done to insure future compatibility are an automatic update mechanism, which is what such a device would need for any protocol of this nature.   No blackbox solution can exist, or ever exist until a protocol is chosen.   A protocol is chosen, it is both the protocol and the implementation. However, there is no reason why an automatic update mechanism can't make it work. Do you care if your router updates? Do you care that Windows updates? No, because it is automatic and doesn't matter to most users.   There are literally OPEN RESEARCH PROBLEMS associated with this   There are open research problems with nearly all systems, what do you mean exactly?   Routing on layer 2 is extremely difficult in a distributed system.   What? do you even know what you are talking about?   CJDNS uses an ad-hoc solution to this problem, which is prone to failure.   CJDNS is not ad-hoc by any means by default.   Establishing trust isn't easy, and is outright ignored by a number of successful implementations, such as OLPC  Any widespread system has to establish trust, or be fundamentally insecure   How do you propose a fix to this problem? I have a solution in mind, but what are your thoughts on this matter?   Each of these things needs to be mathematically verifiable for it to be scalable.   What? Please explain further.  Let me explain why I think CJDNS beats anything you will ever come up with:   It actually exists. It is an overlay network, and can therefore allow 2 nodes on incompatible networks to communicate. Nothing I have seen so far actually does this. Because it is an overlay network, we can make use of the billions, perhaps trillions of dollars of infrastructure already in place. For anything to have any success, it must be possible to use the existing infrastructure. It is encrypted at layer 3 and provides real assurance (barring flaws in implementation) that the owner of said IP/CJDNS address is the only one that can decrypt traffic for that address. You may not know that the one who claims to have that address is who they say they are, but that's better than what we currently have."

It's good, because mistakes made now will not be forced upon us at a later date, and it's bad because of obvious reasons.   Protocols are what make and break the system. Let's say I wanted to make a little wifi dongle that worked with CJDNS, sort of like OLPC's implementation. I can't just port the current CJDNS implementation to an embedded system-- it doesn't work, for basically every reason you can think of. I need to write a custom firmware. When I approached forums with this problem, I was told ""read the whitepaper."" That's not a technical document, it's closer to a marketing document.  I want something to hook into CJDNS. Without a standard, I don't know what CJDNS is. Am I writing it to work with commit xxxxxxxx? By the time I finish, nobody is using that version any more. I have no guarantee that my device works with any other CJDNS capable device. With a standard, I can assure that my device can work with anything using that standard.

Routing on layer 2 is extremely difficult in a distributed system.   I probably misunderstand Kademlia. Does it not do Layer 2 packet routing?   How do you propose a fix to this problem? I have a solution in mind, but what are your thoughts on this matter? (in reference to establishing trust)   Right now CJDNS establishes trust by assuming if you've got a friend in the network, you're a trusted source. That's not a good solution, because for something to be universal, it requires ANY person to be able to access it. You can't just slap trust onto an existing protocol. It has to be designed in from the ground up.   Let me explain why I think CJDNS beats anything you will ever come up with:   I'm not about to try to build my own.

""Dongle"" usually refers to a piece of equipment you plug into a computer, so something like a USB wifi adapter.  That doesn't make sense in your example because you're trying to make a layer2/3 protocol (CJDNS) run directly on top of a piece of hardware.  CJDNS has nothing to do with whether an OS supports your hardware or not.  When you get OS support so that your wifi adapter shows up as interface wifi0, then CJDNS can use it like any other network adapter.  Off the top of my head, OLPC's system is just a wifi adapter set up for adhoc connectivity.  I'm running cjdns on a pair of openwrt APs which are connected via adhoc wifi, and it just works: when they get within range of the other one, wifi connects, and cjdns establishes its EthInterface autopeering and I have connectivity over cjdns over wifi with zero per-peer configuration."

Another example:  Anonet 1. It actually exists. 2. It's an overlay network 3. See above. 4. It is encrypted at layer 3, as well.

darknetplan,2lctak,jercos,2,Thu Nov 6 15:33:17 2014 UTC,"I don't think you can actually connect to ip addresses directly, as that would break the anonymity part of I2P. For example, when you host a web server, the web server is bound to an address like 127.0.0.1, and all traffic as far as it is concerned comes from 127.0.0.1.  I think it works by your application connecting to the local router with SOCKS or something, then the address you specify is the b32, which gets translated by the router. Then it takes the data you give it and encapsulates for the network."
darknetplan,2lctak,mildred593,2,Thu Nov 6 16:25:19 2014 UTC,"This is as I understand it, correct, and on par with the similar process used by tor .onion domains.

Technically cjdns is somewhat similar to this in that the packet is encrypted and routed to the key, not to any key matching that IP address, but the traffic is IPv6-compatible and does not need a SOCKS proxy, or a gateway passing connections to 127.0.0.1"
darknetplan,2lctak,PSkeptic,1 point,Thu Nov 6 19:23:10 2014 UTC,"The thing you're missing is that cjdns is layer 3 while something like I2P is layer 5. cjdns is compatible with all IPv6 applications out there. Porting an application over I2P requires rewiting the network layer of your application.  To remind you, layer 3 is just above ethernet frames. cjdns implements a layer 3 protocol that is encrypted. I2P is implemented on top of TCP/UDP (layer 4) that is implemented on top of IP (layer 3).  This also means that cjdns does not require an underlying TCP/IP network to function. As such, it could replace the existing TCP/IP stack. Which I2P can't."

darknetplan,2lctak,noeatnosleep,2,Fri Nov 7 11:43:48 2014 UTC,"Cjdns stands out from other anonymous-without-anonymity-guarantees networks in my mind simply because it's an all-in-one package. Anonet and DN42 both use BGP and VPN links, and thus don't have end to end encryption, or verification of traffic's source. It also provides complex metric configuration equivalents (it's perfectly possible to combine a routing protocol like BGP with a latency-based metric, but that's extra work), and usually achieves its aim of finding a path very near to the fastest path over the network between two points.  Critically for the I2P/Tor comparison, cjdns does not provide real anonymity. That's not a part of cjdns' design or its goals. It provides a foundation for security that anonymity can be built on top of, but by itself it's only slightly ""more anonymous"" than wrapping every connection with SSL.  In any case the zeroconf is a pretty big line item for a ""shy of"" point like that. The difference between configuring an Anonet node and a cjdns node is black and white, not only because of IP addressing, but because you don't need to separately configure a VPN, and BGP, and the set of tweaks you'd need to make a BGP over VPN mesh network balance traffic where possible, not to mention the added complexity to get something like iptunnel (probably just another level of VPN), configure SSL on every service being provided, plus something that would be very difficult to provide, cjdns addresses are tied to keys out of the box, which provides a level of authentication that SSL can't (assuming you got the IP address in question securely).  The end product is perhaps similar, but setting up a cjdns node needs the ability to run simple commands, and edit one text file."

About 99% of the work in getting nodes in the air is smooth, and consistent configuration of the hardware.  If you can reduce that 99% down by any amount, it leaves more room to actually get nodes into the air, thereby increasing the rate of program roll-out."

darknetplan,2kw0fb,pushme2,6,Fri Oct 31 17:37:17 2014 UTC,"step 1: when the client/daemon first runs, it generates a private key. This private key is then used to generate a public key which is also an IPv6 address which follows a few specific rules special to CJDNS (otherwise, it is almost exactly the same as IPv6).  Why is this special? Because it is a built in guarantee that the address you are communicating with/send information to can only be read by the owner of that address. This is similar to DANE and namecoin, whereby given a namecoin name, you can absolutely without a doubt know for a fact you have the real TLS certificate for said name, no trust required (this essentially makes CA's dead weight).  So if you used CJDNS, namecoin and DANE, you would have like 2 layers of encryption for which there is no middle man to inject themselves.  step 2: How does routing work? Here is what wikipedia says:   Routing is designed such that each packet requires very little handling by an individual router, or node. Each node will respond to 'search queries' asking it for other nodes nearby to it. This allows the sending node to determine and add routes to its own routing table.[4] Once the sending node has determined a route, it sends its packet to the first node on said route. For each hop, the receiving node reads the packet's header to determine where to next send the packet. Before the packet is forwarded to the next hop, the node performs a bit shift on the packet's headers, making it ready for use by the next node.   step 3: What does this get you exactly? It gets you perfect node to node encryption, nothing more, nothing less. Depending on your threat model and other concerns, this may or may not be enough. The web we know today is a huge beast with tons of interconnectedness on many different levels. So if you are trying to remain as private as possible, you have many layers of the onion to deal with, which just encrypting layer 2 traffic wont solve.  step 4: is it worth it? I'd say yes. CJDNS is an amazing tool to create an overlay network on top of other networks of almost any type. Everyone on the hyperboria can communicate with anyone else on it, and very easily too. Hosts on ipv4 and ipv6 networks can communicate with each other as if there were no barriers. And to top it all off, the encryption part is just icing on the cake as far as I am concerned.  I am not too sure about how well it will scale, but I do think there is plenty of room to grow.  If you have any other specific questions, feel free to ask and I might answer"

darknetplan,2kffu6,Meshnet29,2,Mon Oct 27 02:43:50 2014 UTC,"1) If you are using wifi repeaters, that has nothing to do with CJDNS or the Meshnet. The CJDNS protocol runs on top of layer 2, the MAC layer, and is not involved in such things. It uses whatever links you give it, whatever their bandwidth may be.  2) If you mean that those 5-10 nodes are linked to other CJDNS nodes through UDP tunnels over the internet (so as to connect the local meshnet to the larger global meshnet), then yes, all nodes will be able to route through them automatically. As long as at least one remains connected, that will continue to be the case. If you mean the ability to route out to the commercial internet and browse the web through a proxy, like Tor exit nodes, then that is never the case at all unless you set up additional proxy services yourself. CJDNS is not a replacement for Tor, it is a replacement for traditional TCP/IP, for the internet itself.  2 a) Not clear what you're asking here. Whatever bandwidth the link has is what it has.  2 b) Traffic is encrypted end-to-end as part of the protocol, using the well regarded NaCl encryption libraries. CJDNS does not include integrated Tor style exit proxy functionality, as mentioned above, and is not intended to.  You seem to have some significant misconceptions about what CJDNS and Project Meshnet are. You might try this link to gain a better understanding:  https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Introduction"
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,1 point,Mon Oct 27 04:29:38 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the response.  1) I was thinking that the 50% bandwidth reduction was a limitation in the wifi itself, as in, you are using a specific frequency (say 2.4ghz) to communicate to device. I remember reading something that wifi can only propagate information serially (i.e. send then receive) and not parallel (send and receive) creating the 50% reduction in bandwidth when you repeat the signal to another node.  2) I meant to communicate to the commercial internet (clearnet). I understand your first example is hyperboria, correct?  2a) yes the link has a specific bandwidth say 300Mps, but if you link to another device with 300Mps (A -> B -> C), the effective link between A to C becomes 150Mps...I know this is an existing problem when bridging multiple routers or repeating signals.  2b) Yes, I am thinking of more of a TOR style network which is creating my confusion in the protocol so I appreciate you clearing that up. I am still confusing though about the bandwidth issues.  In the end, what I want to do is setup a local meshnet between as many people as possible in my community but still be able to access the clearnet. If I can share that connection to the clearnet with the people in my local meshnet, the better. I know if you try bridging routers (or using repeaters) and creating multiple access points to create your network to access the clearnet, the connection between the outlying nodes to the clearnet suffers due to signal propagation. This is what I am trying to understand with CJDNS.  Thanks again"
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,3,Mon Oct 27 04:40:52 2014 UTC,"1) In the case of repeaters, yes. It would not be the norm to use repeaters in this case, however, as they are generally going to be unnecessary. For omni-directional nodes that link to multiple other nodes over one channel (connecting to a local node provided by coffee shop, for example), you will get at least one ""level"" of that, of course, but separate fixed point-to-point links between CJDNS nodes, each of which acts as a router, will likely make up the majority of your routing and will not suffer from that affect.  2) So did I, and no, it is not. Hyperboria is the current popular name for the CJDNS meshnet (CJDNS uses global addressing, so there aren't ever really multiple separate meshnets, just portions of the global meshnet that aren't connected). It is possible to put proxy services up to allow access to the clearnet through Hyperboria, just like proxy services offered for privacy on the internet, and there was also a Tor bridge on Hyperboria for a while which allowed access to the Tor network (and exit nodes) through Hyperboria, but that is all. CJDNS is not for anonymous internet access, it is not a Tor replacement. It is an internet replacement, you're (eventually) not supposed to need to get to the internet at all.  2a) If AB and BC are simple fixed point-to-point wireless links, and A, B, and C are CJDNS nodes connected directly over those links (in other words, no other funny business), and those links are 300Mbits, and no other users are taking up bandwidth, then you will get the full 300Mbits from A to C. All CJDNS nodes are routers.  2b) Indeed, that is not what this is. Tor doesn't need a replacement, the internet does. The idea here is to create an alternative to ISPs and the commercial internet so that governments and corporations can't so easily block our ability to use whatever services we like, such as Tor. We're trying to make a new ""internet"" for stuff like Tor to run over, not just another Tor."
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,1 point,Mon Oct 27 05:04:50 2014 UTC,"For sure, I agree with you 100% that we need an alternate to ISPs and I love the idea of the meshnet - I just see it being very difficult for people to transition over without an incentive which is what I would like to provide. I've learned over my years that most people are not as excited of new technologies like this unless it impacts the bottom line.  So if I can provide people with a device that would allow for them to connect to meshnet nodes and the clearnet, this would be ideal. Of course, access to the clearnet would only come from a few nodes in the local meshnet as you would not be able to provide any financial incentive if everyone had a connection to the clearnet.  I live in a major city in NA and I have access to multiple buildings and condos. The problem is that I don't have line of sight to every unit so I need to connect the network to other buildings - which is why I need to give an incentive to people in the adjacent buildings to setup a node. The many incentive would be to provide them with cheaper internet."

You would like to be a Internet Gateway Provider it sounds like. Did you read the introduction I linked?   If I can provide people with a device that would allow for them to connect to meshnet nodes and the clearnet, this would be ideal.   No special device is necessary. Just provide a gateway to the internet on a node and connect that node to the meshnet. All nodes will then be able to connect through your gateway to the internet. CJDNS even has the necessary built in support for such a service already, if you can acquire a range of IP addresses to allocate to your users. You could offer it today and every node on Hyperboria would already be able to use it.   Of course, access to the clearnet would only come from a few nodes in the meshnet as you would not be able to provide any financial incentive if everyone had a connection to the clearnet.   This is true. More importantly, anyone running the gateway would face major liability issues. You would probably need to charge a small fee to cover the cost of the bandwidth and IP addresses, to establish an incentive for users to not do illegal things, and to be able to call yourself a service provider and get the legal protections that current ISPs and proxy services have."
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,1 point,Mon Oct 27 05:23:11 2014 UTC,"Yes, I just watched a video from the nycmeshnet and they mentioned that no special device is required. You are correct that I need to become a gateway.  Yes, I was thinking that I would get the necessary licences to protect myself and have users join the network based on subscription. If that user is caught doing something illegal, they can be identified and reported. Though if they are on the meshnet, then their traffic is encrypted and I wouldn't know what they are doing. I also need to figure out how to select which users can connect to the local meshnet and how I can deny them clearnet access if they are not a subscriber. I would love it if I could separate the two - allow anyone to access the local meshnet so it can continue to grow (to keep the spirit alive), but if you want clearnet access, then you need to subscribe to the coop.  Thank you for linking the article, I will start reading it.  Do you know if there is anyone doing something similar to this?"
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,2,Mon Oct 27 05:31:44 2014 UTC,"Yes, I was thinking that I would get the necessary licences to protect myself and have users join the network based on subscription.   I'm not aware of any licenses being needed, in the US at least. Falling under that category is as simple as providing the service. If you have paying users with accounts that you can disable in case of violations, and you respond properly to reported violations, then you should be legally ok. IANAL though. :P   Though if they are on the meshnet, then their information is encrypted and I wouldn't know what they are doing.   If you are providing a gateway to the clearnet, then you would, by necessity. I mean... it's the clearnet. It's cleartext. :)  Users could certainly be, and should be, using https connections and equivalent when possible, though.   Do you know if there is anyone doing something similar to this?   I am planning to once there are enough local meshnets with Hyperboria only nodes to warrant the service, but the fact is that there aren't yet. Nearly everyone currently on Hyperboria is accessing it via UDP tunnels, so needs to have internet access anyway to get on Hyperboria. Only a handful of direct local links have been establish so far. Quite simply, nobody is going to be interested right now."
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,2,Mon Oct 27 05:41:12 2014 UTC,"Do you know where I can learn more about setting up a IGP on a local meshnet? How I would be able to identify which node on the meshnet is a subscriber and which isn't? How to deny them access to the clearnet, routing clearnet traffic, etc."
darknetplan,2kffu6,thefinn93,2,Mon Oct 27 05:51:38 2014 UTC,"You will want to look at the information on the ""ipTunnel"" features of CJDNS:  https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org/Cjdroute.conf#IpTunnel  Nodes on CJDNS are simply identified by their IPv6 addresses, which due to the nature of the protocol cannot be spoofed. You allow your friend's IP to connect, and only he can connect."
darknetplan,2kffu6,OmicronNine,2,Mon Oct 27 06:02:47 2014 UTC,"Edit: I just read that CJDNS can handle both IPv4 and IPv6 which is great and answers my question partially.   Not exactly. What do you mean by ""handle""? If you mean you can use IPv4 over Hyperboria directly, then no. CJDNS provides an IPv6 only network. If your web browser, for example, does not support IPv6 then you cannot browse Hyperboria. Period. That's very rare these days, though, almost all OSes and network software support IPv6.  As for what you can run UDP tunnels on top of to create CJDNS links over the internet, that is true, you can connect to both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts.   I'm still wondering about the bandwidth issues (if there are) of the CJDNS on repeating the signal from node to node.   As I said in my other comment, there effectively aren't any, or at least if there are it's not because you are using CJDNS.  And again, access to the clearnet for a CJDNS node only serves the purpose of allowing it to connect to other nodes through UDP tunnels over the internet, not for provided clearnet access like Tor."
darknetplan,2kffu6,thefinn93,1 point,Mon Oct 27 05:14:21 2014 UTC,"Thanks for your reply, I really do appreciate it.  Ultimately I am trying to figure out a way to give people access to the clearnet while expanding the meshnet. I always wanted to share my internet connection (yes, I know you're not suppose to) with my friends so we can save money, but repeating the signal traditionally has performance issues. Then I came across the meshnet and these performance issues don't exist. I would love to do away with ISPs and use the meshnet, but that won't happen unless you can give an incentive for the majority of people to join which is why I want to create a coop."
darknetplan,2kffu6,IWillNotBeBroken,2,Mon Oct 27 05:38:44 2014 UTC,"For just a few of your friends, people you know and can trust, you could do it right now! I doubt your ISP would catch you. The rub would be IP addresses, you wouldn't have multiple IP addresses to hand out. The easiest solution for that would be to put your CJDNS node behind your existing NAT router and assign multiple internal IPs to the same node for handing out to your friends, making them effectively VPN clients inside your home network (with all that entails, but you trust them, right?). That way, your router will handle providing them internet access through it's NAT just like it does your own computer.  If you want to offer a service, you can charge enough to pay for a business connection that carries no restrictions on reselling access and comes with a range of IPs to allocate to users.  Neither of those is the best option, though: running your gateway on a VPS hosting service with unlimited bandwidth, and then acting only as a link in the chain. You can get a VPS with multiple IPs easily, and then simply setup your home node to connect to both them directly and the VPS over UDP tunnel on your connection. Your ISP won't be able to tell that you are sharing at all, or anything other then seeing your one connection to your VPS, yet your friends are able to browse the internet through your connection through the link they have with you, using their own IPs as though they had their own personal ISP connections."

The logo is not welcoming or friendly. It's way too technical. It needs to invoke the feelings you have listed: Safe, Secure, Scalable (I'm going to argue that Scalable is not a good point for this audience and you just used that because it started with ""S"", but also isn't Safe and Secure too similar?)  Instead of that literal logo, imagine it as allegorical. Use an animal or aspect of nature that mimics what Meshnet does. Or make it abstract in another way (like a simple shape or line work) but move beyond the 1:1 literal network honeycomb thing...  Humans don't respond well to honeycomb hex shapes.  Find a warm, safe, fun color palette and use it (this palette is so desolate, it says to me - why should I care about this project?)  While ""Be Independent, Again"" is great copy it doesn't fit with appealing to a larger audience. What is the call to action for those reading this ad? How do they contribute or feel useful? Is it an exclusive feeling, like part of a club or does it help those around them? The idea of independence is counter-intuitive to how a mesh works anyway...  Good work so far though!"

I realize the approach needs works and leaves the viewer guessing (in a bad way) about what the project is.  The listed adjectives are secure, simple, and scalable by the way, there is no ""safe"" listed. I chose those adjectives not because of alliteration, but because those were some of the main points on the cjdns github readme page.  As for the dislike in honeycomb shapes? Could you provide an example? I view it as a modern convention that has a place in design.  As for colors, I will look into some palettes because it could use some oomph.   The tagline, ""Be independent, again"" was one of the working subtitles and can definitely be subject to change and I encourage suggestions for substitutions.

Look at the Red Hook Wifi network.  Heck, I've done this on a smaller scale with some of my neighbors, and a handful of people in the community.  We made it happen.

I want to market this using tangible ideas that people can see themselves adopting. This strategy has shown great success (Apple's - ""Think differently"" and  Nike's - ""Just Do It"") when getting people on board because although product appeal may vary, the adoption of simple, yet perceptible ideas can fit a much greater demographic and product appeal will follow.  This is the reasoning behind the tagline - ""Be independent, again."" A common testimonial of the Meshnet is that it reveals an internet in a more true and independent form that users may not have seen in a while. And in the midst of several clear-net debacles (security outcries, ISP hate, etc), this tagline could carry the connotation of a breath of fresh air.

That is what the newest websites built by serious designers that I have seen generally look like.  And that makes a big difference because people (including myself) just can't help but make judgments based on appearance.  Its just the natural way the brain works.  If something looks new and trendy and just nice according to the current standards (which are always changing), then people will have a more positive attitude towards the actual information.

With regards to the generic ""stickmen"" of the crowd, if you want ""Independence"", that stickman become more distinct (color/shape alteration?) once freed by the mesh.   It's very cool that you're only in college and just starting to work on this. Big times ahead.  I agree with the comments on the palette. It's stark. But like you said, ""simple"" and ""scalable"" are your keywords. The design brings me back to a kid playing the original Dungeons & Dragons box set. Adventuring in hexland.  Interestingly enough, we both are working towards bringing meshnets to the community. Take a look at our campaign: http://igg.me/at/ivi We welcome comments, questions and critiques... well constructive critiques.

You do NOT want to leave the explanation to experts.  They have already tried, and they have produced very long-winded complicated essays.  The reality is that unless you have a very specific group of people viewing some information who are already predisposed to investigate it, the initial description needs to be short and sweet.  Otherwise you are going to lose a huge percentage of people who just don't have the time or energy.  It IS possible to come up with an accurate, short description that hits on a few of the major points.  I would say keep working with the experts on those simple short and sweet explanations.

If CJDNS had a proper GUI interface for setup and management, we'd be golden.  There's a start on a node interface in the repository, interested parties should look in to improving it. ;)"

I could not agree more about UI and that leads me to my next part of the plan: I want to make the process dead simple, void of any tedious hackery. Basically, I hope to develop a tor bundle-esque applet for the desktop to abstract the shit out of the process. This is a great project, the bottleneck needs to go."
darknetplan,2jtlah,l337fpc,1 point,Tue Oct 21 04:20:12 2014 UTC,"I'll be honest: that's not the best approach. Not unless you're going to be doing a full Windows port all by yourself, at least. Even then, you're still creating a bunch of transient nodes (people reboot and shutdown their desktops), which will be more of a burden on the meshnet then an asset.  The reason the nodejs interface is so important is that it will make it possible to produce dead simple images for routers and devices like the Raspberry Pi and Beaglebone Black. What people need is a simple to use, low power, always on little node with a web interface to plug in to their network for under $50.  The hardware exists, it's the simple interface that's the last piece of the puzzle."
darknetplan,2jtlah,cammyjee,1 point,Tue Oct 21 04:32:22 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the advice. Not having my always-on node near me makes me forget about the important aspect of uptime lol.   Hardware would solve that issue, however for a project this size, capital investment on the part of the user, though, can be tricky. Assessing the market audience is a contributing factor to that question because even though I think a large portion of meshnet users are enthusiasts who would pay for such hardware, there is also a considerable portion of people who are interested in free software that they can get running on their own hardware from day 0, which is still possible.   From that argument, though, stems the question of their potential to sufficiently contribute to the network (uptime), which may or may not hinge on such factors by that time in the future when more users are predictably supporting the network.  Basically, I still want to pursue this, I just need to do quite a bit more analysis and figure out what problems still exist, who is really using this, etc. From there, more appropriate solutions can be implemented, in my opinion."

We wanted to go with a solid platform (openwrt) and a solid routing protocol (olsr) since both are well documented and widely understood.

You can add power to ""yell"" your signal louder from the WAP but your reception is limited to the size and style of your antenna. that Engenius antenna will work for maybe a block reliably. You can extend your range by having equivalent antennas on both sides of the connection."
darknetplan,2jt1th,MetaMesh,1 point,Mon Oct 20 20:35:37 2014 UTC,Awesome I was thinking It'd be more like that. I guess it was more wishful thinking to have the antenna read that distance as well

Do the math yourself, calculate the link budget, loss/gain in each system, emitted power level, then calculate the SNR based on a noise floor taken on site and cross reference that with an MCS table to figure out what kind of speeds you could get. Don't forget fresnel zone calcs either!  People also commonly overlook the fact that antenna gain is bidirectional too!  At the end of the day, the power output on these devices is capped by the law, so you'll find that a laptop or cellphone puts out just as much power as a high end access point.  The biggest benefit of going ubiquiti to ubiquiti is being able to use their Airmax TDMA mode, it kicks ass at solving the hidden node problem, but is master/slave and not a layer 2 mesh protocol. That can be ok though, working beats out not working every time, and layer 3 meshing is honestly where it's at."

So, I won't repeat them here. I will provide a link to it once it's published.   Yes, SineOMine and I are both collaborators on the iVi project.

We're interested in shaking things up - maybe it sounds corny but sometimes the truth is.   Our mission is to imagine, act and build for positive, sustainable, changing future. iVi came out of an in-house project to create an off-grid communication grid and ""Internet of Things"" for use in the greater vision, The Starfield Centre.

darknetplan,2jw9s2,genedragon13,2,Wed Oct 22 19:35:13 2014 UTC,"Video frame interpolation? (Does the device have a video output? That doesn't seem to be stated, but interpolating frames seems like a technology for a video player matching the refresh rate of a device, not a media server.)   The first televisions, had a initial frame-rate of 15 fps. They did something interesting with that called frame interlace, or interlace video. In the case of the tv video stream example above, two 15 frame rate video streams are interlaced (ex. bits 1_3_5.. and 2_4_6...), essentially doubling the perceived video stream, to 30 fps, without losing additional bandwidth. ffMPEG is an open project that does this video frame interpolation. It does this among many things. Have a look at ffMMEG. So lets look at another example: video streamed from iVi, lets say from a microUSB drive plugged into iVi. The video steam will be interpolated or otherwise translated, if necessary, via ffMPG, then sent out via miniDLNA to interface with your devices (tv, tab, mobile... whatever your have that is UPnP/DLNA compliant) which is played by a media player on your device. The built-in media player for Android may be UPnP compliant (iPhone is not), but if not, there are many streaming video players that are UPnP/DLNA compliant such as XMBC, Kodi, VLC, Buzz... Watch the video to see real examples of iVi in use.   The cloud? (Does this mean a file host? Web-based applications hosted on the device? A syncing service?)   The ""cloud"" per se has two relative definitions when discussing networking, storage and computing. iVi deals with all of them. Lets go through these and the terms we use with iVi:   personal cloud: Media/files contained in portable storage units (USB thumb drives, SD cards, portable hard-drives...and more than one as iVi has 4 USB ports) can be plugged into iVi and shared to other devices. iVi can share by a direct wireless connection to devices, in order to download/upload files. iVi can support 6 direct wireless connections. iVi has 3 SSIDs for separate login accounts (ex. admin, home, guest). Furthermore, iVi can share via streaming using the miniDLNA media server to devices that are [UPnP]()/[DLNA]() compliant. So using iVi as a personal cloud to share or stream to devices, it can in one way be thought of as a home media server that can interact with multiple devices. However, a cool thing about UPnP/DLNA is that iVi can be used as a hub to use one device to wirelessly interact with another. For example, use your mobile phone to play a movie on your smart-tv via iVi. This example is example is shown on the iVi video. collaborative cloud: Assemble shared cloud space by linking to other iVi. iVi is dedicated to assembling meshnets. Running @ 400MHz on 24MIPS with off-loaded wireless to an Intel 7260 AC miniPC 2x2 dual-band wireless interface, which is feeding dual fractal antennas, produced by a state-of-the-art tech company. File sharing is done via BitTorrent. So, cloud space grows collectively with each iVi. On the collaborative cloud, files are easily and quickly accessed because iVi has a built-in torrent tracker/indexer. There are several options for how we will do this. For interest sake, here is how the tracker could work, but we haven't decided yet, so the exact process could change Thought-experiment: 1) A new file is dropped into the Public folder. A Linux-based automated file monitor recognizes this. A window pops up prompting the user to either manually tag the file from a check-box interface, or automatically tag the file from a community database, such as iMDb for video media. The micro tracker announces new files via a port-dedicated channel on iVi, much like a chat that indexes and reports new torrents. This is one way we could do this. active cloud: the iVi project is built from open source architecture. As thus, we will be offering a few apps that reach across the iViNet, but because it is open source we are encouraging the communities out there, like SourceForge and GitHub, see iVi as a platform for users to play with and hack. iVi runs on Layer 2 protocol so apps and programs could be built to utilize this. Suggestions from us for iVi: Chat apps, something akin FireChat and Mumble, would be nice (we will be making one, but variety is nice). Social networking; imagine each iVi having a built-in micro page for networking and such. A nice replacement to the monster called FB. But really, here the options are only limited by the imagination.    Internet connection sharing?   Answered extensively below.    Can you plug in a USB Ethernet device and share multiple wired connections?   Yes. iVi has 1 Ethernet port to connect to wired networks as a client. There are other things we can do with this port... but just haven't thought of them yet. As a wireless router, iVi can have up to 6 connections to it.   Is the connection shared with the supposed mesh, or only with local clients? Can the mesh extend onto a wired network as well? Can the device handle routing the ""shared"" traffic through a VPN, balancing between multiple uplinks?    Partially - ""shared"", yes, and we will be exploring ""balancing"" in the future. For now, iVi has VPN capabilities as a client. But, iVi has been designed as a personal device with the ability to connect to other iVi to grow a iVi-iVi meshnet. However, each iVi has the option to share a variable percentage of wired bandwidth through the iViNet allowing for connection to the traditional internet. iVi acts like a Guest account router in this way.   Furthermore, routing wired bandwidth through an iVi meshnet obfuscates the IP address. iVi-to-iVi link through Layer 2 protocol, so no IP address is shared in these connections. So connecting to the Net through an iViNet (2+ iVi) will not report the user's IP. Further explanation of the system is deep conversation, involving local-to-virtual IP address creation and routing that through a ""hidden"" network (iVi) that runs on Layer 2 protocol (absent IP addresses). Leave it to say here, an iViNet operates similarly to how a VPN operates. Also, because of Layer 2 protocol, if ever the stream of data was intercepted mid-transfer, only a physical address of the end device would be the identifier, nothing else.   Are game networks a feature, or is that merely stating that a wireless network can be used for video games?   Game console systems, such as XBN and PSN operate on Private Networks, for the reason to keep the good stuff in and bad stuff out. These run on DLNA. iVi operates on Layer 2 protocol and can connect to these Private Networks by translating the private IP address of your XBox or PS3. This is similar to how private socialVPNs function. This allows for the setup of game networks via iViNet.    It costs an extra $30 for the ""three devices"" level, is configuring multiple devices to work together difficult? (""File sharing between all units in range"" would imply it's not difficult)   There are two types of meshnets. Public and Private. File sharing via iVi meshnet, described above, implements the BitTorrent system. Setting up an iVi meshnet, either public or private, is not exactly hard but takes time and some level of expertise (there are extensive guides for operation), thus the $30 for servicing. However, if you feel you are technical enough to do it yourself, but (3) three $99 units and save on servicing. We'd rather this is done. Make iVi your own.   What is an ""internet connection mode"", and which in particular does this device support that would make such support better than an off-the-shelf router?   See above"
darknetplan,2jw9s2,jercos,1 point,Fri Oct 24 19:56:16 2014 UTC,"sent out via miniDLNA   So you have a transcoding media server running on a 400MHz chip? That chipset is plenty powerful for routing, but transcoding video in real time is very computationally expensive...   routing wired bandwidth through an iVi meshnet obfuscates the IP address   Does this refer to anything more complex than NAT? NAT would be absolutely mandatory for sharing a home connection, and double-NAT (plugging an iVi into a home gateway/router) can be downright harmful to some NAT-traversing applications. (VoIP in particular)   iVi operates on Layer 2 iVi runs on Layer 2 protocol translating the private IP address   That's repeated in various forms a couple of times. If you mean that iVi's mesh protocol sits inside a layer 2 frame, that's perfectly reasonable, but unrelated to whatever mechanism ""allows for the setup of game networks"". More detail here is mostly what I was looking for, as both the campaign and your responses indicate a working mesh protocol, but no details on that protocol are given. Interoperability is critical to any large-scale networks, and I certainly don't want to buy a device that would only ever mesh with other iVis.   there are extensive guides for operation   Is there a reason not to share these guides to non-owners? I've found that reading a user's manual for a product I intend to buy can be very helpful in deciding to buy a product or not.   See above   I don't see that my question about the nature of an ""internet connection mode"" was explicitly answered. As you may be aware, I am not involved with the development of this device, and as such cannot infer anything about the device's function. If you could be explicit as possible in your answers it would help me feel less like I'm talking to a scammer, and more like I'm talking to a representative of a legitimate business."

I'd be happy to try and answer any questions too, but I'm not actually licensed myself so I'm definitely no expert. I'm familiar-ish with the hobby though, as I used to work in the industry."

darknetplan,2jqgm6,interfect,2,Mon Oct 20 11:19:50 2014 UTC,The whole point of a mesh network for this purpose is to not rely on anything outside. Phone to phone direct communication.
darknetplan,2jqgm6,Ivebeenfurthereven,2,Tue Oct 21 02:05:34 2014 UTC,"You would have the devices radio each other directly, not over the ship's WiFi.

darknetplan,2jlmne,mofosyne,5,Sat Oct 18 11:37:59 2014 UTC,"I'm not sure what format NFC (bear field communication) uses, but they have programmable tags that can auto perform things like payment transactions, set up Wi-Fi automatically (instead of typing lengthy password), etc. I'm sure an nfc tag could just hold text data as well. No idea about BLE though"
darknetplan,2jlmne,SolarFlareWebDesign,3,Sat Oct 18 16:32:30 2014 UTC,"Was thinking about NFC tags. It doesn't really store much data though, but will give it a shot in the future.  Issue however with tags so far is, how do you make it act as a FIFO buffer? Right now its just a box that people can delete and add at will. E.g. modifying other people's post.  To use NFC as a guestbook at least, you need to somehow program the microcontroller to only 'append' new entries, and drop old post as the buffer becomes full. (Possible with custom microcontroller of course. But then it won't be that cheap, and if you are going though that trouble, then you might as well go BLE if possible)."
darknetplan,2jlmne,TheScriptKiddie,1 point,Sat Oct 18 16:41:17 2014 UTC,"If you built your own NFC tag, you could make it behave however you want. You might even be able to put a much larger amount of memory. But bluetooth is a much better fit for this kind of thing. However, as far as I am aware you do need to pair with a device in order to do file transfer. Perhaps the device could be set to always be discoverable, automatically accept any pairing requests, and automatically try to push a file after pairing. It could also automatically accept incoming transfers and concatenate them with the existing data."
darknetplan,2jlmne,GeorgeHahn,6,Sun Oct 19 05:16:33 2014 UTC,You could do this with BLE; the main concerns are power and bandwidth.  You can prototype using a Linux desktop (or Raspberry Pi) and a cheap BLE capable USB dongle.
darknetplan,2jlmne,150c_vapour,1 point,Sat Oct 18 18:12:28 2014 UTC,Not a bad idea.  You could build a demo with an android phone and a Nordic or TI chip.
darknetplan,2jlmne,slacknate,1 point,Sun Oct 19 11:13:13 2014 UTC,"BLE was designed for small micro-processor systems; think temperature sensors and things like that. Yes you COULD leverage BLE due to the fact that it treats pairing differently than BT Classic, but I HIGHLY suggest you do not. As one of the other posters mentioned, bandwidth is low, and meant to send small pieces of data. Trying to shoehorn generic data transfer into BLE is ugly, and I've seen it been done (and yes, it was ugly). I think the Bluetooth 4.1 spec (also I'd like to note I have no idea how ""official"" this spec is yet; I am fairly certain it is in drafting stage still) addresses this problem of BLE not having a more generic data transport, but waiting for Bluetooth 4.1 seems a little silly. That being said, WiFi can do P2P operations as far as I know, using AdHoc mode, but I'm no WiFi expert."

darknetplan,2j2v0n,JamieRCooley,3,Wed Oct 22 05:07:42 2014 UTC,So in 2011 twitter and Facebook were all the rage with the Arab Spring. Now it's Firechat. Has anyone here tried Firechat? And proved that it works?
darknetplan,2j2v0n,satisfyinghump,7,Mon Oct 13 11:00:52 2014 UTC,Whats going on in Hong Kong is largely voiced and communicated through the use of Firechat. I guess that's a pretty big example
darknetplan,2j2v0n,PSkeptic,2,Mon Oct 13 17:18:31 2014 UTC,"I appreciate your comment, but as far as Hong Kong (and Iraq too) are concerned:  1) there was no evidence that mobile telephone coverage was shut down or throttled and that Firechat used its alleged p2p facility to connect the masses. The whole time, the protesters in HK or the ordinary people in Iraq (who could not access WhatsApp) were using it on either ISP-ed internet over wifi or mobile data i.e their comms went to Firechat's servers before getting to the protester 20 meters away from them.   2) There seems to be an assumption that since FireChat is allegedly p2p, then it's by default safe. In fact, Firechat is designed to act as an open platform like Twitter, where all the messages are available in the open. In addition, the whole shebang is unencrypted and you can collect it using a colander with an attached wire to your Wireshark (OK I'm being silly here but you get it).   3) Good luck in getting any info on how FireChat works, what's its terms of service or its privacy policy from the people who built it.   Now having said that, I'm not being a hater. I really believe p2p is the way forward but as activists, we need to be careful when adopting any new platform before verifying a tool's veracity. Most important is that we don't get into the media hype about the use of new technology the way we bought into Twitter and Facebook during the Arab Spring."
darknetplan,2j2v0n,PSkeptic,2,Tue Oct 14 08:48:05 2014 UTC,"Burning man most assuredly did not use the mobile telephone network.  No bars on the playa.  As for a encryption, what's the need?

Firechat doesn't. and it isn't different from WhatsApp or any other texting app.   Again, I would love for Firechat to be working, but I'm yet to see evidence from trusted sources.   The only reference to Burning man and Firechat is a passage in an article on the Verge that again repeats the whole Hong Kong farce.   And as the experience with Ultrasurf showed, probably the only service Firechat is providing is giving the Chinese authorities a source of all those protesters' names, phone makes, and probably numbers."

It could also help students make better choices of majors, closing down certain majors, as they become too popular, to avoid employment stagnation in certain fields based on available positions that require those degrees. I don't like the fact that students may miss out on what they feel they were born to do and it is pretty totalitarian but the students will still have a choice. It just may not be a major that is their first choice if it is more popular than the workforce can employ. Then again, you run the risk of a real innovator blossoming, so this certainly isn't an amazing idea but it is food for thought.

Credit is a theoretical amount of money someone is willing to loan you based on your income so that you can pay it back.  In 2008 we faced a stagnation in credit because nobody trusted anyone to pay the money back. Loans stopped for businesses and people who run business on credit were not able to continue to run the business.  I don't see how ripple would have any effect on that. Is this just a shameless plug?

There's tons of trust in every community, every facebook user with more than a friend or two, every university, institution where people work and business which has customers.  There is simply no credit availability problem once you start thinking in terms of every person being a potential source of credit on par with a central bank.  if all of this trust was actually in use, things would not have seized up.  Maybe it'd eventually seize up in some distant time in the future, but it's not clear that would happen and even if it did, there is a contingency plan"
darknetplan,2j2v0n,PSkeptic,2,Fri Oct 17 02:32:50 2014 UTC,"Trust and confidence are two totally different concepts.  I trust many of my friends.  I do not have confidence that many of them would pay me back money I loaned them, due to various reasons.  I have confidence in my bank's ability to give me my money when I demand it.  I do not trust my bank.  Financial systems are built on confidence and trust.  Your credit score is a score of confidence.  Not of trust.  The trust is in the data supplied by the credit report to be accurate."

They measure nothing, fail to address systemic risk, and are arbitrarily centralized in entities who have no valid measures of trust or confidence.  The power of determining confidence is put in your hands.  The difference isn't whether or not they would pay you back but whether they would pay someone in the network back via your link.  This is a crucial intermediary between trust and confidence as you see it."

There's even a movement to try to make the providers enable the FM chips on all phones, but I'm pretty sure they never made it anywhere politically.  I've also heard talk about trying to get FCC licenses to transmit data over FM, but also have no idea where they are in that process.

darknetplan,2j300q,jercos,5,Mon Oct 13 05:16:02 2014 UTC,"A modern FM radio receiver might also support RDS, which can carry a steady stream of data, e.g., stock tickers, weather data, traffic data (some GPS units scan local FM radio stations looking for RDS traffic data). Of course the trouble is, this is receive-only. Not so much a meshnet as a centralized information dissemination system.  If you actually meant to equip everybody with an FM transmitter and receiver for that, well, regulatory issues are there for a reason. The entire FM broadcast spectrum sits in ~88-108 MHz. An FM radio station needs a fairly wide gap to sit in according to the FCC, thus why FM radio stations always end in an odd number after the decimal point, which leaves 5 stations/MHz × 20MHz = 100 total potential slots to license. If you and some people got together and formed a non-profit organization, you might be able to get a slot without shelling out a ton of money, and share it among your users. Now you have a half-duplex fairly long range channel over which to push text messages back and forth, that requires each member to buy an expensive FM transmitter, or be receive-only. A neat thought experiment, but all in all probably not practical."

If the gotenna can do that, then that's great. But it does seem a bit expensive. I think we can sacrifice range, if we implement local message stores.    Tl;Dr: The gotenna audience is the non tech savvy users, who just need a textual walkie talkie equiv. I would like a simple low fat wireless communication platform, that can be easily updated, and collaborated upon (software wise, and hopefully hardware wise) via the arduino platform. Maybe it might become a meshnet developed via the community, which is just a firmware update away."
darknetplan,2j3o56,kawfey,3,Mon Oct 13 14:27:21 2014 UTC,"One could make their own AFSK modulator using an ATMega and something like packet with FEC. This is involved but straight forward. Implementations of packet on Arduino are probably somewhere out there on github or something.   As a mesh, implementation would be difficult as userbase counts go up and up. Packet is only 1.2kbps so this sentence would take almost 500ms to transmit. You can see the issue when several people are on the same channel - collisions would occur.   I've been a part of sort of a packet mesh - stations would come and go in service and in and out of range, and had a designated broadcast timer, which would tell the connected nodes whose online and whom they can hear. A piece of traffic - runner numbers and their position in a race - would get broadcasted and repeated until it reached net control. This is modifible to allow the traffic to reach a certain destination, not just net control.   Now, the spectrum which this is usable is non trivial. Gotenna uses MURS but that band requires certification of each radio. Ham radio is open to using the cheap $25 chinese handhelds that would work on ham radio bands. This requires a license, and disallows the intentional obscuring of messages (typically understood as encryption).   But that's the legal route."
darknetplan,2j3o56,ZeoNet,2,Mon Oct 13 23:27:16 2014 UTC,"True about the Ham, or MURS licences.   I still think these are too restrictive for ordinary people to just jump in (the ham community is not too bad, but is still somewhat an exclusive community via licencing). Hence I would rather use ISM bands. 433mhz AFSK is an option, but do worry about speed/datarate/complexity/pcbsize of that route.  After a bit more research, I am leaning towards NRF24L01+. It's plentiful, and seems to be supported in the long term. Plus it looks quite compact.  Obviously it won't be as high performance as gotenna or an actual HAM rig. But it would be easy enough for people to construct in a classroom, and play around with it in a playground/workspace/etc... The reduced range compared to commercial version, is made up by creating message store devices. A message store device could be just the same device, but hooked to an sd card like a offline BBS and flashed with a custom firmware (which is why it should be based off the arduino platform)."

darknetplan,2j1i9k,FedoraPAC,19,Sun Oct 12 17:40:52 2014 UTC,"The Internet was meant to be a meshnet of sorts, and to a degree, it is. It's self-healing (a broken link will be routed around), it allows each node to reach each other node without having to explicitly configure each node, and it allows new nodes to form without needing more than a peering relationship.  The advantages of a meshnet over the Internet are more cases of doing it better, e.g., cryptographically authenticating each node, encrypting all traffic to avoid eavesdropping, using cryptographic keys instead of centrally administered ID numbers, routing around not just downed links, but also slow links to find the actual best path for your data rather than just the path with the smallest number of hops, allowing automatic or near-automatic peering in close physical proximity, distributing routing load rather than expecting each and every node to carry the entire routing table... the meshnet is for the same purpose as the Internet, it's a new Internet, done right.  For an individual, the main advantage here will likely be that instead of paying an ISP for access, each individual on the meshnet is expected to peer as an equal with people around them to get connectivity, reducing or eliminating the cost to get access to a global network, and then providing very low cost access through the meshnet to the traditional internet."

darknetplan,2iror3,michaelmclees,14,Thu Oct 9 16:01:51 2014 UTC,"A personal streaming site (à la twitch) would be a nice proof of concept for this, but there are two major problems with this. The first is obvious, shit's illegal, and gives large companies both incentive and legal means to start shutting down mesh nodes. That's not cool :p  The second is a more technical problem. When one person is the authoritative source for something, like a personal streaming site, they can prove they are themselves to validate the content. With TV-based content, what's to stop Joe Average from streaming... mostly legit illegal TV rebroadcasts, but then replacing ads with his own, or even just accidental stuff like advertising that he provides ESPN2 when he's actually providing ESPN3?  I'll probably look into the mesh streaming site concept eventually. I suspect you could keep a personal directory of people streaming easily enough, and your directory browser (or a central directory browser, but that's less cool) could serve up the applet/element for playback right in a web interface to keep things nice and cross platform.  To do either personal or television streaming really right in a way that wouldn't cause the bandwidth of anyone sharing a channel/stream to the world to be overloaded, you'd need multicast ability. I'm thinking a modified HLS with the hash of each chunk included in the m3u8, serving the m3u8 from the source, but then pulling in the content chunks from any node willing to advertise that they'll repeat the chunks from the source.  The source of a stream should probably be reasonably compatible with non-mesh streaming sites to allow tools like xsplit to be used unmodified. https://github.com/arut/nginx-rtmp-module as an example can allow an individual to serve up an HLS stream from an RTMP source with little to no trouble, and might make a good starting point.  Back on the topic of illegal content, you'd need a somewhat expensive HDMI capture card at every location serving a channel, and you'd need a video encoder running 24/7 (assuming anyone's watching), which can be a fair power load on lower-end machines. It might be impractical to do without rewarding individuals for sharing a TV channel somehow. (preferably without charging the viewers much if anything for content of course) whereas with personal streaming the ""cost"" of sharing a stream is offset by the reward of broadcasting your personal content.  TL;DR neat idea, poor choice of content to repeat :p"
darknetplan,2iror3,jercos,1 point,Thu Oct 9 16:38:35 2014 UTC,"What do you think the upper limit on channels being served could be? Let's say that there is an informal gentlemen's agreement that the max throughput of a broadcast is 10Mbps, which is good enough for HD on Vudu, Netflix, etc...  So let's say that you're a node and you're trying to serve up something like 100 channels. Could you do this with a consumer router, assuming the distance you're looking to cover is short, like 3 houses down the street or something, and you put your antennas on the outside of your house? Node A broadcasts 1 channel of his own, a live feed of ESPN2, plus 99 channels that he is getting from Node B. Node B is now getting an extra 1 channel and now anyone who connects to either Node A or B, get 100 channels. Nodes C, D, E, and F don't contribute anything of their own, all they do is repeat what they're provided. So everyone may either just receive, or receive and transmit either a duplicate, or a duplicate plus something of their own.  Over time, I think in geographical regions, a stasis would be reached where everyone is essentially having the same content.  It may be that the legal issues are simply too high a hurdle for me to justify even thinking about this anymore. I could foresee this being popular in other countries though, where such hurdles are not so relevant. Also, it would be a great way to disseminate news independently if the network was widespread."

darknetplan,2iror3,jercos,5,Thu Oct 9 20:38:49 2014 UTC,"Routers need to use IP and such because without IP there's nothing to route.  If you aren't routing, how do you know what to relay, and when to relay it? An important part of 802.11 is allowing multiple devices to share the same channel. If you take that way, now every TV channel needs its own wireless channel, much like traditional broadcast television. Presumably thanks to video compression and digital channels this wouldn't be quite the bandwidth hog that analog broadcast television was, but an ATSC digital broadcast TV channel for example is still ~1MHz wide, quite significant for a consumer system that can't share multiple devices on a single frequency, and complex to rebroadcast as well.  Now for a little added complexity, you're talking about receiving and rebroadcasting dozens of channels at once. That's not cheap, either in bandwidth or in radio equipment, and each rebroadcasting station is going to need a band for each channel they use that doesn't overlap with another transmitter in range. If this all happened in the hundreds of GHz, you might have enough metaphorical pasture for all these cows, but the whole thing is still a mess of unmanageable proportions.  On the other hand, streaming on demand would reduce the amount of data required massively (assuming each channel is coming from a geographically diverse location), and potentially allow the whole thing to happen on an existing wifi-based mesh network instead of using tens of thousands of dollars of custom radio equipment.  But to each their own."
darknetplan,2iror3,Infinitopolis,1 point,Thu Oct 9 21:01:41 2014 UTC,"Does it make a difference that when I use the word ""channel"", I'm only using it in the way a person watching TV would use it. Channel 1 is ABC, 2 is Fox, etc... Could a broadcaster not simply relay perhaps 5 seconds of content of all channels to all listening nodes. Then repeat. With enough throughput the receiver just ends up with a stream of all content and they pick the one they wish to actually use."
darknetplan,2iror3,m_bishop,3,Thu Oct 9 21:45:23 2014 UTC,"Well, at ATSC quality over an ATSC channel it takes 5 seconds to relay 5 seconds of broadcast, since it's designed to have one TV channel be one radio channel, so no. You could do it at a lower quality than ATSC and using oh say, WiFi physical layer channels, then maybe add a tag at each node to let it know that it's headed in that direction, and then have a higher level addressing scheme to tell the receiver who it's from, and tell routers along the way where it's going to... oh wait, that would be 802.11 and IP. :p  Assuming you're talking about doing this over WiFi and IP... that basically describes HLS, except that in HLS the client requests the 5 second chunks instead of having them broadcast everywhere, avoiding the need for the entire network to relay every second of every channel anyone is broadcasting.  In any case, the key to your puzzle is ""with enough throughput"". We don't have enough throughput to broadcast hundreds of channels with commodity hardware, with or without IP involved.

darknetplan,2igtt5,CompassBearing,6,Tue Oct 7 12:38:41 2014 UTC,"There are some pretty serious issues with taking a solution based on a centralized blockchain and scaling it to distributed infrastructure that can power something the scale of the internet.  Bitcoin has had approximately 50 million transactions over its history and a full copy of its blockchain is currently running at over 22 GB.  In comparison, there are currently 276 million registered domain names - and the amount of churn between them being bought, sold and expiring is fairly high.  (7.5% growth in total number of domain names per year - completely ignoring any form of ownership transfer.)  That's slower than network and disk space are growing, but it's still large enough that there's absolutely no hope of using blockchain techniques to build a fully decentralized solution to the problem.  (Particularly if you consider mobile devices!)  Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of blockchains as a central source-of-truth, but unless you expect every node to maintain a full copy, you still have a client/server (or peer-to-peer) trust problem that probably requires a key management solution.  (That said, it shouldn't require one with a single powerful central authority like DNSSEC - which would be nice.)"
darknetplan,2igtt5,CompassBearing,5,Tue Oct 7 03:28:20 2014 UTC,"That's not too worrying, because you can just have ""lite clients"" and anybody can be a server and run a full node if they want, but they don't have to.  That way, in the event of some failure or disruption in the system, some not insignificant group will decide to step up and start running a full node in order to help contribute when the system is in need."
darknetplan,2igtt5,CompassBearing,3,Tue Oct 7 05:17:46 2014 UTC,"Of course.  My point is just that if you do this, you still have a client/server or peer/peer trust problem that's going to require some sort of key authentication scheme to resolve - and that the two main non-centralized approaches to doing that (web-of-trust and trust-on-first-use) put a higher burden on users for managing security themselves."
darknetplan,2igtt5,LightShadow,3,Tue Oct 7 12:09:22 2014 UTC,"Oh yeah, no doubt if central authorities controlling trust are gone, then the burden of maintaining trust falls entirely on the users.  I just happen to think that's a good thing, as long as the burden is distributed among all users, so that at any given time users can go on- and off- line and the system will still remain intact and trustworthy.  Even though it's more hassle than central systems, I far prefer it specifically because it's both more resilient and censorship resistant.  One of my big gripes about cryptography is that few people focus on easy-to-use applications for the end-user rather than neat new crypto stuff.  And crypto is only ever used when it's easy for users.  Users love HTTPS, because it requires nothing on their part.  Everybody I talk to wants to use PGP but simply finds the process too difficult.  That combined with the fact that all non-centralized systems by necessity require more user interaction and maintenance mean systems like Namecoin and PGP's web of trust are only used by the techie elites.  There really needs to be a community wide push for user-friendly implementations and integrations of these types of things and there's just not.  To be fair of course, part of the problem is that they're just complicated technology and all the attempts at making user friendly things were still too difficult for most users.  It's just a tough problem.  How do you maintain security in a system that must be run by people who don't know how to run it!?"
darknetplan,2igtt5,CompassBearing,1 point,Tue Oct 7 12:33:14 2014 UTC,"[...] then the burden of maintaining trust falls entirely on the users [...]   I think this kind of approach is fundamentally non-viable.  Ease of use is a necessary feature if you want large scale adoption, and replacing an insecure and easily compromised centralized architecture with an (in practice) insecure and easily compromised distributed one isn't really a net win.  It's also even less viable if you want to consider fully autonomous nodes or the internet of things.  Particularly given that most key authentication schemes currently in practice rely on DNS as part of key verification - to deal with certificate and signing key revocation.  (Except OCSP stapling, which doesn't seem to actually be catching on and has it's own analogous denial of service issue.)  The reason people avoid using the 'neat new crypto' stuff is that in practice, if you can fuck cryptography up there's a good chance you will, even if you're an expert.  (And if you think you're one, you're probably not - I'm definitely not.)  You're right though, in particular some of the stuff coming out of lattice cryptography is really interesting and could give us some really cool new kinds of crypto building blocks."

darknetplan,2igtt5,aminok,3,Tue Oct 7 06:22:05 2014 UTC,"Yes, definitely - but it's still not going to be particularly viable here.  Namecoin allows you to store 500 bytes per key (domain registration).  If you stuck every domain registration into a single block, that would give a total size for the most recent state of over 138 GB.  If we assume typical domain name sizes (reddit's would be 10 bytes) and IPv6 addresses (another 16 bytes) that still gives us a total state of over 7 GB - and that's completely ignoring the overhead of storing cryptographic keys.  Everything's been shifting towards mobile devices over the past several years, and I expect this will continue towards an Internet of Things in the future.  (Which as a trend would be awesome for a darknet - you could imagine a world where all these devices could be nodes.)  I don't think it's likely they'll all be willing to maintain 7 GB of routing state, however - which means we'd still need an at least partially centralized naming system to deal with initial discovery."

There are three main viable foundations for verifying public/private key pairs:   Centralized key-signing approaches like TLS and SSL implement.  This is the approach where you'd need that kind of a key-management approach.  It's centralized, so you also have to worry about signing keys being compromised.  It also puts the smallest burden for security onto users. Web-of-trust approaches like GPG and PGP implement.  These tend to put too much burden on end-users to be viable in practice, and while they're more resistant to signing-key compromise, there are still more complex versions of that attack vector. Trust-on-first-use approaches like SSH implements, and like Moxie Marlinspike and others have been advocating recently.  (See tack.io for more info)   There isn't a clear 'best' solution between the three approaches - they all have tradeoffs.  I'm hoping things will move in a less-centralized direction, towards some sort of hybrid of the second two over time - but unless typical users end up taking much more responsibility for their own personal security online we'll never be able to get away from the first approach entirely."

What's the standard? what should it be?   That's the million dollar question(s) and I hope it's not rhetorical...  There are existing standards, but they all have their flaws:  Ad-Hoc WiFi + adv-batman or oslrd. Ad-Hoc is old, can't do WPA, but it's battle tested. 802.11s does hardware right but won't scale beyond ~30 nodes. However, it is a true IEEE standard which is nice. WDS is another ""mesh"" but it only seems good for clearly defined corporate networks. Then there are a handful of closed/proprietary standards.  If I were to create my own spec I'd spruce up 802.11s and figure out how to scale it up. I'd also make smaller channel widths possible (the regular 40MHz, 20, 10 and then add in 5, 2.5 and 1MHz). Then I'd throw cjdns on top of it.   We could change it later, but a standard makes moving forward easier.   Agreed. I'd say before publicly selling/deploying something I'd build it to an open, solid and robust standard."

They mostly have good OpenWRT support* which is as LTS as it gets in the router world. *some revisions have wonky support, so if you can buy one in person (ie.

Had a thought, too: Pis are nice, but we can go even lower. cjdns runs on rooted Android phones, and the price of a used, 3-yr-old model is well below that of a Pi (i.e. http://mobil.bazos.sk/inzerat/41288305/samsung-galaxy-mini.php a Samsung Galaxy Mini with a cracked display, for 10 euros). Phones have the advantage of batteries, and even if those need to be bought new to replace the worn-out ones that will come with most used phones, the full system cost might come in lower than an RPi + Wi-Fi adapter + battery."
darknetplan,2hzekf,syadasti,2,Wed Oct 1 21:21:36 2014 UTC,"This is actually quite accurate, as far as total system cost.  However, one does need to take into account time-in-service for the hardware as well.  A used phone, that is already 2 years old has a time-in-service of 2 years once provisioned for this role.  However, the power requirements between the Pi and a smart phone are about the same, regardless.  It's the Wifi radio that is killer here:  500mW of RF out requires about 1W of power to produce.  The rest of the electronics on board uses about 2W, variable.  1.5W average.  So, overall system costs, let's say, are break-even on the phone v RPi (Or any other dev-type board).  Your actual largest system costs are the solar panels and batteroes.  For 24 hour, non-stop operation, a 40W panel and a 12Ah battery would be needed, regardless of phone or Pi."
darknetplan,2hzekf,PSkeptic,1 point,Thu Oct 2 13:21:33 2014 UTC,"Hm. Thanks for those insights. The advantage I'd be looking for in terms of the phone is having the battery and charging hardware integrated already, as opposed to having to build the power system external to an RPi.  As for the battery, I'm looking here at ~14 euros locally, VAT included, for a lead-acid battery intended for UPS systems, 6V, 10Ah. Is that the sort of thing that would be appropriate?

darknetplan,2hzekf,syadasti,1 point,Thu Oct 2 13:51:42 2014 UTC,"Yep, there is an advantage to the used phone model...  One thing however, is reduced range versus an external antenna.  But, the tradeoff might be worth the cost?  Yeah, that 6V 10Ah battery should work, given the appropriate DC-DC step down converter/regulator (You need 5VDC for the pi).  There's even 6V solar panels.  They're harder to find, but not entirely difficult."

The typical response is go make your own if you want that. The closest thing that may allow this is Ethereum I think but I am not sure I completely understand that so maybe or maybe not.  I have been thinking that you could create your own crypto that created units randomly to people that transmit instead of useless ""work.""  The problem I see is how you set pricing for network access. The transactions will be too fast and numerous for the common person to want to worry about what the cost is to use the network. And setting a universal price will create a strange dynamic for providers that will make it hard to set up shop, some areas are more expensive to provide access than others. You could have a set amount, say one unit per packet or whatever and then have a market to replenish your supply if you get low. Then you can watch the prices and buy when you like the price and sell when you like the price. That hybrids the two, allows suppliers some market pricing signalling and users some price smoothing.

I occasionally look for board posts addressing the issue because if firechat requires routing via the net how is that peer to peer messaging? I haven't found any material why it doesn't work with Android but I'd say it has something to do with the radio hardware in Android phones being incapable of sending transmissions without headers.

darknetplan,2hhvxc,aminok,6,Fri Sep 26 03:35:25 2014 UTC,"Well, cjdns makes it nigh impossible to create a node pretending to be another node, via cryptographic hashes being the address.  Since we know (As best as we can tell), you cannot create a signed hash unless you have the private key, it's well protected there.  I2P has the same protection:  One cannot pretend to be another B32 node, unless the private key has been compromised.  Now, on the other side of the Sybil attack, a large adversary creating many nodes, in order to control and monitor traffic, no network is, nor can it be, protected from that.  CJDNS is, to some degree, due to the manual peering process.  However, depending on the resources of the adversary, it's not 100% protected (ie, large-scale intelligence agency using many agents to embed themselves in many groups, thereby building person-to-person trust).  Security is not a binary proposition.  So, when X is protected from Y, executed in Z manner; it does not mean X is protected from Y, executed in B manner."

darknetplan,2hhvxc,OmicronNine,2,Sun Sep 28 04:53:50 2014 UTC,"Wouldn't it be advantageous to allow automatic peering though?   It actually does, when used as intended.  CJDNS is not for creating meshnets over the internet. Currently, it's being used through VPN connections over the internet because there aren't all that many users yet, but it's intended to be used over actual physical wired and wireless connections directly. It's supposed to replace the internet, not be used on top of it. When used over direct, MAC layer connections, as intended, it auto-peers by default (and if you have enough money for all the hardware, a very expensive Sybil attack could theoretically be attempted in a particular local area). A feature to automatically establish VPN links over the internet would not make sense for the protocol."
darknetplan,2hhvxc,PSkeptic,1 point,Sun Sep 28 05:11:04 2014 UTC,"Ah I get it. A physical connection is required for auto-peering, which is exactly what you want in a meshnet, and what makes a Sybil attack impractical."

darknetplan,2h3l5a,gichiba,3,Tue Sep 23 02:32:03 2014 UTC,"As a person herding cats on this project, currently, OLSR is the underlying routing protocol at this time.  However, that is subject to change while the build out of the prototype network is completed.  I'm researching (ie, learning how to work with) batman-adv, as I like the fact that it works on the physical layer, and even handles autoconf for IP addresses (as far as I can tell), whereas OLSR requires manual maintenance of the IP addresses.  However, my knowledge of batman-adv is tiny compared to what I know of OLSR, so it'll slow down progress on the build-out should we go with batman-adv.  Both OLSR and batman-adv scale well from what I've read, up to a few hundred nodes (I can't fathom it being much more than that), as client access devices (ie, end user's laptop).  However, even should it expand past that, network segmentation is possible.  So, in reality, the choice of OLSR is ""It's what I know best"".  CJDNS was suggested for deployment, but AFAIK, CJDNS is not a routing protocol that can deal with dynamic routes and handle radio link state changes.  The docs for CJDNS also provide that it's not ready for a production network.  If people were to desire to run CJDNS on the network, I would not be opposed to it."

darknetplan,2gmznl,sapiophile,2,Wed Sep 17 12:17:56 2014 UTC,"Some answer in the IRC logs:   <_Vi> How does IPFS compare to Tahoe-LAFS? <jbenet> _Vi some similar ideas, but very different goals. IPFS is about a bittorrent style exchange, a git-like Merkle DAG datastructure, and exposing a web-like API (paths/urls).   And on issue #9   I hope to someday bring some unification between the shared goals of Calistore, Tahoe-LAFS, and IPFS. IPFS aims to be a more general layer (you can implement anything Merkle DAG based on top of IPFS), so if its performance guarantees support the others, it might be useful to add IPFS as an underlying layer. It's also possible to go the other way around (expose Camlistore of Tahoe-LAFS stored content via IPFS).   The main difference I see (although I don't know much about Tahoe-LAFS) is that with IPFS: you choose which content you distribute. The objects you share are eiher objects you've been looking at (and are in your cache) or the objects that you share because you care about them (you pinned them).  This is great for replacing the web (and is actually a goal: IPFS browser extensions to fetch ipfs:// or http://ipfs.io/ links smartly, see the planned demo list)"
darknetplan,2gmznl,lukeydukey,9,Thu Sep 18 07:19:19 2014 UTC,"The paper says §3.4 about bitswap, the data block exchange protocol :   In the base case, BitSwap nodes have to provide direct value to each other in the form of blocks. This works fine when the distribution of blocks across nodes is complementary, meaning they have what the other wants. Often, this will not be the case. In some cases, nodes must work for their blocks. In the case that a node has nothing that its peers want (or nothing at all), it seeks the pieces its peers want, with lower priority than what the node wants itself. This incentivizes nodes to cache and disseminate rare pieces, even if they are not interested in them directly.   This also provides plausible deniability : if your peer implementation downloaded a data block, it doesn't mean that you wanted it for yourself.

To me it seemed he was answering how to stop fraudulent access to secure sites like online banking (he suggested dividing up the web into trusted and non-trusted parts, and having an ID card which works on this trusted segment which would allow banks etc to ensure you are who you say you are). As his solution wouldn't stop ""illegal activity in the dark corners of the web"", yet the program suggested the solution he was offering would, it makes me feel he was answering a different question.

In light of that, I feel we need to brainstorm how we can develop useful applications (Like Reddit!) without privileged users behind the scenes.  This all assumes that our goal is to empower individuals on the internet against corporate interests, government censorship, and threats like internet kill switches.  If that is our goal then I believe developing a robust, administrator-free, peer to peer application layer is a pretty logical next step after creating a sound infrastructure."

darknetplan,2fptbg,ArloJamesBarnes,1 point,Thu Sep 11 11:29:40 2014 UTC,"I think it is hard to make a cross-community (in this case, cross-protocol) statement without comparisons and contrasts. There are certainly unique reasons why Usenet is widely spam-ridden and flamewar-torn (and eternally in September). Ideally the enforcers would be the servers and their subscriptions, but the ratio of situational (network) knowledge to number of users (legitimate and otherwise) and the motivation of the people with technological power is too low.  However, another point is that Usenet has a pretty low stack, technologically; it is mostly just pairs of computers swapping plaintext messages. If you have more layers of indirection, such as a message board consisting only of users that have been cryptographically verified (perhaps to have complied with posting guidelines, to prevent spam?*), then signal can be automated to emerge; but what gets lost where becomes more removed from human denizens.  *Or just web of trust of some sort."

darknetplan,2fhkpn,nomadiclit,1 point,Fri Sep 5 16:32:38 2014 UTC,"The point is that what you are describing - a basic internet, a bare bones e-mail/messaging - that infrastructure already exists on shortwave bands. How do you propose to do a satellite setup cheap? Iridium is not cheap. Setting up a new sat network is even worse. And the infrastructure amateurs can realistically setup will be a hassle for the user to use, since the sat is going to be low power and low orbit altitude - just look at the ham radio sats - I don't see a proper definition of the target audience for this setup either. Packet, PSK or SSTV can be done using a computer, with a sound card and a simple HF transceiver. Building dedicated devices is cheap and simple and there is loads of documentation and experience publicly available on circuits, antennas, propagation, protocols, etc, from ham radio operators. For line of sight use DMR and D-Star are some examples of widespread implementation already in use right now, which supports digital voice and data communication, and can operate completely independent of the internet.   And as people ( /u/recourse9  )  keep pointing out that traffic in ham radio bands cannot be encrypted: First of all, that is a grey area - you can encrypt your traffic but the protocol has to be open source, or so it is said, but the widely implemented D-star system uses a proprietary AMBE codec for encoding voice (the rest of the protocol is open source though). The signal sender also needs to be identifiable at all times.   But besides that how do you people propose doing any of the stuff you want on any frequencies? Yes you can do a lot on 2.4 GHz, 433 MHz and 5.8 GHz (at least those are the free for all frequencies in europe) but the legal PEP power limits on those frequencies are so low, that most of what you propose is going to be illegal anyway. So if it is illegal in the VHF/UHF area, what difference is there to be illegal in the HF area?"

In the same way you can't use it for business purposes, neither can you use it with ""secret codes"" I believe is the wording - encryption doesn't need to be broadcast if you're experimenting with it. Protocols or encodings are fine, provided the full spec and description is published and open, but using a form of encryption means you're no longer experimenting, you're broadcasting.  (Also, when the hobby was first founded you may have had German spies broadcasting in code, so there's that too.)"

So no WPA/2, WEP, HTTPS, TLS, etc...  This is in the FCC part 97 rules.  Furthermore amateur stations cannot broadcast to the general public.  Several licensed amateurs could create a cleartext mesh with an authentication protocol, but non licensed members of the community wouldn't be able to directly participate. They would have to originate through one of the amateur stations via unlicensed frequencies and matching power levels(ISM.)  The amateur station could then retransmit that message to another licensed amateur using their FCC license privileges who can then pass it on (we call this third party traffic.)  Amateur radio operators are responsible for the transmissions they originate, any station automatically forwarding 'illegal' messages is required to take reasonable means to stop forwarding the message upon discovery. (again all codified in FCC part 97 rules)  So while it wouldn't necessarily prevent mesh networking it would make participation by unlicensed individuals difficult/roundabout; privacy/anonymity are out the window entirely. Thus like OmicronNine said making a darknet ""effectively impossible""  You can learn a lot about radio electronics and operation by practicing amateur radio even if you can't build an encrypted dark net.

At the vertices of the triangle are three properties that are generally considered desirable for such names:    Human-meaningful: The quality of meaningfulness and memorability to the users of the naming system. Domain names and nicknaming are naming systems that are highly memorable. Decentralized: The lack of a centralized authority for determining the meaning of a name. Instead, measures such as a Web of trust are used. Secure: The quality that there is one, unique and specific entity to which the name maps. For instance, domain names are unique because there is just one party able to prove that they are the owner of each domain name.   Of these three properties, Zooko's conjecture states that no single kind of name can achieve more than two. So the edges of the triangles represent the three possible choices for a naming scheme:   Decentralized and human-meaningful: This is true of nicknames people choose for themselves. Secure and human-meaningful: This is the property that domain names and URLs aim for. Secure and decentralized: This is a property of OpenPGP public key fingerprints.   Zooko's conjecture was disproved through creating practical systems that exhibit all three properties.

I think Storj is pretty primed to move forward fairly quickly. We just raised about $500,000 via our crowdsale for our two flagship applications Metadisk and DriveShare.  You can take a look at http://metadisk.org/, and try out PR0 here. The underling API allows us to build more traditional things like a Dropbox like application, or content distribution. We are working on building solutions for a few people now.  I think the key is incentives and UI/UX. On our system users get paid to sell their extra drive space to the network. Two, it has to be simple and easy to use(which freenet was not). Take a look at http://storj.io and see the demo I posted above and decide for yourself."

I'm also studying Storj, Ethereum, Filecoin, Sia, Bitcloud, and many others.  MaidSafe is fundamentally different because of how it works, it isn't based on blockchain technology. I really like that it has anonymity built from the core. I think it has a real shot at replacing Tor and VPNs. Also, it's designed with performance and scalability in mind (farmers who provide resources to the network are paid automatically by the network in an anonymous token called safecoin. This is unlike Freenet, BitTorrent and many other p2p network where there is no incentive to provide resources to the network).  MaidSafe also lets you share private data through self-authentication which allows users to create an account and login to the network without transmitting their password to any third parties.  The most interesting part of MaidSafe is that it will provide an API layer for developers to build applications. If we can build a decentralized version of Facebook, Youtube, Twitter, Reddit, Skype and other popular centralized services, I would be pretty happy. They seem to have the ambition to enable that (the platform will only provide storage at first, but they want to add computation in a second phase). I would suggest watching their interview on the Keiser Report to better understand their vision.  So yeah, MaidSafe is the project that excites me the most. I'm actually going to Scotland next week to meet them and ask them lots of technical questions! They want to decentralize the development of MaidSafe by helping bootstrap Safe pods in other locations. Safe pods will help develop the core librairies and will also build their own applications on top of the SAFE network. It's very likely that I will start one in Montreal, Canada. I've already started a Meetup group.  I'm very excited that we are in the testnet phase right now (the first of three testnets is almost finish) and that the beta launch of the network should happen by the end of this year or early next year. They have a clear roadmap and they are publishing weekly updates. Most of the other projects are in very early stages of development. MaidSafe was started in 2006.  I highly recommend creating an account on the MaidSafe forum to talk with the other members of the community."

Nothing at all, save authoritative ordering in time. Freenet is perfectly successful in the sense that it provides functioning anonymous message boards, file sharing, static website hosting, and private messaging to a set of active users. It's also a haven for the scum of the earth, providing to pedophiles what Tor provides to drug users. This neatly proves that it accomplishes the goal it set out to do, it's censor-proof and anonymous in every way that matters.  So the question isn't really ""How will these boneheaded attempts at distributed storage get a better following than Freenet?"", it's ""Will these bitcoin-coattail-riders find a practical use for anyone not mentally ill?"""

darknetplan,2ej6i8,jercos,3,Mon Aug 25 17:53:48 2014 UTC,What's the incentive for someone to host a node on Freenet?
darknetplan,2ej6i8,mthompson362,1 point,Tue Aug 26 00:21:08 2014 UTC,"What's your incentive to seed a torrent (private trackers aside)? I think successful systems like BitTorrent, Freenet, and even cjdns demonstrate that a network is perfect capable of running without an incentive.  All that aside, if that's meant to be a pro-blockchain comment, you're being incredibly silly. Owning more FooCoin is not an incentive to run a FooCoin node, running a FooCoin node is a reason to acquire FooCoin. Bitcoin, Litecoin, and a hundred different altcoins have clearly demonstrated that mining, while potentially profitable, is not an incentive to continue running e.g., a Bitcoin node, and I would in fact venture that most Bitcoin nodes are not engaged in mining to the point of profit, given even ASIC mining essentially requires pooled mining for effective use.  Any 'profit' to be made from running a FooCoin(storage edition!) node would be drowned in a sea of miners, either making storage near-free (no incentive to run a node, when you can just trade 1USD for 1.21 jiggabytes of storage for 30 years), or making the rewards from 'mining' inequitable against the cost of storage on the blockchain in that same currency, leaving that network incredibly inflationary.     Now, if I've misread your question entirely, and you are in fact looking for an explanation of Freenet, and not of the infeasibility of storage blockchains, there actually is an incentive to run a Freenet node. Running a node is the only reasonable way to access Freenet, and the same resources you use to make your Freenet browsing experience less painful are used for storing both the content you viewed, and content others are viewing and posting. The incentive to run a Freenet node is that you get to use Freenet."
darknetplan,2ej6i8,jercos,1 point,Tue Aug 26 04:36:17 2014 UTC,"Disclaimer: I am on the Storj team.    I'm not trying to imply that there is no incentive for running a Freenet (or any other network) node, I'm just saying there is more incentive in running a, in this case, Storj node. Yeah, you will get paid in Storjcoin X (SJCX), but you can easily trade this in for other cryptocurrencies (and eventually fiat) or use it for another purpose as the Storj network expands in its use and application. At some point (when treechains or sidechains are implemented in Bitcoin), we will integrate back into Bitcoin as opposed to SJCX to make it that much easier for the ecosystem along with accepting BTC/altcoins and most likely USD/fiat through our frontend software.    The reason people don't run Bitcoin nodes is because there really is no incentive to. The only thing you get with running a Bitcoin node is a ~25 GB sized file on your computer and that's it - mining is the only way to make BTC on the network and a node has nothing to do with this. The network needs both nodes and miners, but there's a reason people hosting Bitcoin nodes have been becoming less common.    Our model is quite different from current 'mining' systems (we call ours farming because it really isn't mining). With Bitcoin, to even consider making a profit, you have to buy and set up rigs/ASICs that cost thousands of dollars. With Storj, we have been basing all of our information and research on the fact that most people have hundreds of GBs unused sitting on their home computer (I know I do). They can then dedicate this to the Storj network and in return make a completely passive income off of it.    Of course, that isn't to put Freenet/BitTorrent/etc down but Storj (and similar projects) actually gives a real incentive for users to dedicate their resources to the network. BitTorrent is popular in itself, but imagine being able to just get the key + hash of a file (regardless of what the file is) and going straight to it on the Storj network - no seeding, nothing - and having direct access to it. As for Freenet, I can honestly say I have never met someone who uses Freenet. That doesn't mean Freenet is a bad idea, but it just hasn't gained traction and I feel as though lack of a real incentive system is a part of the reason."
darknetplan,2ej6i8,en3r0,1 point,Tue Aug 26 07:19:14 2014 UTC,"If Storj actually takes off, I will almost certainly feel less incentive to run a node for profit than I would to trickle bitcoin/USD into the economy, and I would note that the plentiful availability of storage is precisely the problem.  A couple hundred dollars now buys a bitcoin ASIC that puts the finest cluster of graphics cards to shame, and a similar cost can net dozens of terabytes of storage.  If Storj develops serious interest, you can bet people will buy giant hard drives and run nodes for the incentive, and if Storjcoin has any mapping to GB/time (official or free market based), you can bet people with access to cheap bandwidth will run massive storage clusters, and flood the market, with the side-effect of centralizing a majority of data in warehouses with minimal incentive to maintain individual node redundancy.  Meanwhile metadata on the blockchain could easily scale to multiple gigabytes by itself, latency could grow sky-high (desktop hard drives are cheaper, as are low-power embedded systems, idle spin-down, and SATA port multipliers), driving storage even cheaper. Finally, just like early Bitcoin drove many VPS providers to restrict CPU usage, I suspect VPSes will begin heavily restricting IOPS on low-cost plans, making it less and less feasible to get a cheap VPS and share out its storage... or worse, leaving it completely feasible, just even slower as Storj users' data sits behind higher and higher artificial disk queues.  All the while this will naturally bring the bare cost of high latency storage down well below the point where a user at home with a mere 10mb/s uplink and a mostly empty 10TB hard drive (or whatever becomes common in the next 3-5 years) shared with their Steam library can make a profit outside of effectively free backups for their files. I see us reaching pennies per 100GB, not just pennies per GB.  In any case, the turmoil will be good for the economy, regardless of Storj's success. I can honestly say I've never met someone who uses Storj... but I look forward to the day when I do, and regardless of my predictions, wish the best of luck."

In any case, there is an issue when you tell everybody in the world ""this file you want, you can find it with me"". At least, if you can easily track the ""me"" to a physical person. But it's not easy to bypass this. if you want a full distributed system, some people will have to allow downloading the content.  What you can play on is how the ""me"", which is generally an IP address, can lead back to the physical you.   on the internet, this IP address is a privacy problem, in regard to your ISP, and other technical intermediates on cjdns, this is a privacy problem in ragard to your direct peers, and less a privacy problem to your indirect peers. That's already less of a problem I think. the ""me"" handle above could be a Tor .onion address, or an i2p address, and then you are anonymous   But other peers must know how to process the ""me"".

The protocols are bare bones and need much fleshing out.   I keep hoping someone will marry a blockchain (like Bitcoin and Namecoin) with CJDNS, creating an incentive network for node operators. This would rapidly accelerate the growth of meshnets like Hyperboria with a financial incentive to do so. But, we have a long way to go at the moment before this is really viable. Hyperboria itself is more a pilot project than anything at this point in time.   Though, the Internet itself started from such humble beginnings 40 years ago. This effort is to rebuild it from the ground up to address many problems in the current TCP/IP stack."
darknetplan,2e8jz0,jercos,2,Fri Aug 22 06:44:12 2014 UTC,"BATMAN doesn't do giant networks. Cover a city in a single batman-adv network? Sure. Cjdns scales globally though, and running it over batman-adv lets you easily build a mesh network over a city, and then expect your connectivity to the world without needing to alter batman-adv.  In that particular scenario, if everyone was running cjdns in open Ethernet peering mode, batman-adv wouldn't be strictly needed, but a batman-adv network can be used for multiple purposes within a local area, while cjdns is difficult to restrict in scope, and tends to feel like a global flat network in the same way the BGP internet does, not really giving many clues other than hopcount as to what's physically close.  Additionally, batman-adv can run on simple, slow hardware that would have trouble running cjdns during heavy network loads that it could handle quite easily if it didn't have to decrypt and re-encrypt each packet, making building a mesh network on cheap commodity hardware much more feasible.  And finally, as has been stated in other comments, batman-adv doesn't do encryption or authentication, and cjdns does. Every packet on a cjdns network, including Hyperboria, is effectively as potentially secure as SSL, but the ""certifying authority"" is whatever mechanism you used to get a cjdns IPv6 address to connect to (cjdns IP addresses are tied to cryptographic keys, only the matching key will be able to read your traffic), so while someone might attack DNS and swap another IP address for a site, if you get the correct IP address for a site, then your connection is secure against man in the middle attacks, and is completely unreadable to anyone save the endpoints.  TL;DR: batman-adv is medium-range, simple, and cheap, cjdns is everything else a global meshnet needs."

And convince all those owners around the world to move their funds (thus lose out on forging fees), so you can then steal their NXT?   An attacker doesnt need anyone to move their funds, they could just buy wallet files from people who no longer had a stake in NXT and forge an alternate history using their stake."

darknetplan,2e5n79,Buffalo__Buffalo,23,Thu Aug 21 06:29:22 2014 UTC,"To expand a little, a darknet is a decentralized network similar to the internet but one which (ideally) does not rely on a ""backbone"" of servers the way the internet currently does.  This is useful because it will mean the internet would become far more resilient (i.e. more resistant to hardware issues due to accident, attack, disaster, and against censorship amongst other benefits).  As my exceedingly limited understanding of it goes, it essentially will be like a hybrid of the internet and a torrent client - you connect to the network and request a page or files, the search is sent out through nearby darknetizens until your request can be fulfilled by someone else who has the info, which gets sent back to you to view/download.  As I understand it, the beauty is that some (all?) designs actually turn issues of congestion to its favor - the more people connected to the internet the slower it goes (like cars on a highway). But with a darknet ideally rather than everyone cramming up the same highway, each device is its own station with roads interconnecting between it and other nearby devices, which are then linked to other devices near that one, and so on. (Maybe think about the internet as a train line - you, your local network, and the backbone, where a darknet has each device connected to others like the spokes of a wheel: you are the hub, each spoke connects to another device which is another hub with its own spokes.) This means that in an ideal situation the more devices that are connected and nearby, the faster it works - perfect for when there's a disaster because everyone rushes to the scene and everyone has their devices switched on (why bother trying to send a signal to a station and back, and then to another phone and back when you could probably just link them directly - or by a small number of jumps - instead?)  This is my understanding of it. It may not reflect the reality of the topic, but it certainly will reflect my ignorance of it. Any corrections are welcomed."
darknetplan,2e5n79,fliphopanonymous,3,Thu Aug 21 10:42:23 2014 UTC,"The analogy of train lines and hub/spokes is a very good one that summarizes the differences between the internet as we know it and a meshnet as we theorize it. There are only a few distinctions that I would add to make it a bit more complete.  With a train line everything is scheduled and planned - much like how the internet is comprised of several companies that provide the big backbone and do peering agreements, etc. With a pure meshnet each hub is capable of making it's own decision about traffic control and shaping, much like how each company can do so to the current internet. The beauty, however, lies in the multiple routes one could take through a mesh to get from one hub to another - if I can travel through either A, B, or C and A is high throughput but highly loaded, B has a low throughput, and C is medium throughput, the meshnet (i.e. the routing protocol itself) might choose to go through both B and C rather than A to get my request sent and the response back to me. By providing more routes the traffic can be spread out and your performance can increase rather than decrease.  I'll further this expansion by going probably a bit too far with it. Say, for instance, we forget about the idea of servers - big powerful machines that are capable of serving up thousands of pages a second, and we talk purely about ""sites"" hosted on regular computers in the mesh we get into a bit of a bind. These regular computers can't necessarily handle a large amount of traffic all requesting the same page. What a meshnet could be capable of is caching - the idea of locally storing remote data for easier, quicker access - much like how your browser will cache websites for you for them to load faster. Then, the more hubs through which the popular site is being access the more opportunity for a request to hit on a cache, rather than having to travel all the way to the highly-loaded regular computer hosting the ""site"". This would drastically increase performance and latency in what would otherwise be a ""less strong"" network than our current option. Now this idea of caching is incredibly hard to do and not, from what I can tell, implemented in any of the current meshnet software options - but if there was a good, easy way to do it the possible performance benefit would be incredible.   Just my $0.02"

darknetplan,2e5n79,Symbiotaxiplasm,4,Thu Aug 21 11:39:28 2014 UTC,"Mesh networking:       A mesh network is a network topology in which each node (called a mesh node) relays data for the network. All nodes cooperate in the distribution of data in the network.  A mesh network can be designed using a flooding technique or a routing technique. When using a routing technique, the message is propagated along a path, by hopping from node to node until the destination is reached. To ensure all its paths' availability, a routing network must allow for continuous connections and reconfiguration around broken or blocked paths, using self-healing algorithms. A mesh network whose nodes are all connected to each other is a fully connected network. Fully connected wired networks have the advantages of security and reliability: problems in a cable affect only the two nodes attached to it. However, in such networks, the number of cables, and therefore the cost, goes up rapidly as the number of nodes increases.  Mesh networks can be seen as one type of ad hoc network. Mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) and mesh networks are therefore closely related, but a MANET also must deal with problems introduced by the mobility of the nodes.

An off-the-charts genius will go even a step further, creating a solution that collapses the whole problem domain."

The stock of aha-moments may be less than depleted in the case of entirely new domains, but for technologies based on old science, all the cost-effective shortcuts have already been uncovered by all the geniuses1 . What's left is the multi-million dollar R&D conducted by teams of hundreds of specialists.  What you're describing sounds more like what can be achieved by leveraging points  from the social sphere. Like changing the goals of the whole system, shifting paradigms... recasting problems as irrelevant or unsolvable within the culture. Huge savings down that path. And potentially highly cost effective. Just ridiculously hard to bring about.

What's stopping Safecoin farms - effectively, someone creating a huge number of MaidSafe nodes on a server farm to make money?   It would compromise the distributed nature of the network in addition to reducing the payment amount any personally-owned node would earn - making it less likely for people to put nodes online.  You'll also run into a lot of the same concerns Bitcoin has right now. There's the worry of a ""50%"" attack by the aforementioned Safecoin miners - and now it's not just Bitcoin/money on the line, but data integrity  - something far more dangerous.   And there has to be some regulation method for Safecoin prices - if I'm looking to buy resources on the MaidSafe network once it's been established and I see the price of Safecoin skyrocket, I'm going to be wary of the price volatility - AWS is predictable, if nothing else.   The article has it right - we pay, one way or another. But just because MaidSafe offers a different payment mechanism, doesn't mean that the Facebooks of MaidSafe would automatically prioritize privacy. The current privacy invading revenue models exist because they work. They'd just be imported into MaidSafe through the apps."

FreeNet is something a bit like that plus a lot of privacy stuff. (Warning: it's reputed by many sources to be full of kidporn and OMGWTFBBQporn. I've never looked but that's what I constantly hear and from more than one person and see mentioned in every forum where the name FreeNet comes up. So if you check it out be prepared for some NSFL and remember rule 30: what has been seen cannot be unseen. Also do it from a VM that you can run a DOD-compliant wipe on later.)  The problem is that to make it robust you have to replicate the data a lot. RAID can get away with being robust against loss of one or two drives because drives don't fail that often. But if you're doing RAID across a bunch of devices that pop up and go offline (e.g. to sleep) very often, now you have to handle the constant failure of N drives where N is often >50% of the total and where which drives are failed and which are online constantly changes. That's horrible, and is why the server is so compelling for always-on reliable things.  That's a massive waste of resources. It's also going to be slow. I'm not sure there's a way around this. The data you want is either available somewhere or it isn't, and finding that somewhere is going to be the sum of all the network latencies between you and all the places you have to look because math.  I think the MaidSafe guys are doing some interesting networking work, but ultimately I think they're solving some of the wrong problems and doing so in a way that's going to have a lot of limitations and performance problems.  The real problem is a lot more complex than ""servers are bad."" It's a multi-faceted problem comprising network topology, lack of good user-experience-focused crypto tools, as well as business, UI design, economic, political, and social issues, etc.  IMHO these guys have something closer to the right idea: DIY server platforms.  https://sandstorm.io  You can host them in your home or business, on a cloud provider, or on a managed provider, depending on what trade-off between privacy, speed, security, and ease of use you want."

Scholtz and others which may be used at a very low energy level for short-range, high-bandwidth communications using a large portion of the radio spectrum.  UWB has traditional applications in non-cooperative radar imaging. Most recent applications target sensor data collection, precision locating and tracking applications.   Similar to spread spectrum, UWB communications transmit in a manner which does not interfere with conventional narrowband and carrier wave used in the same frequency band.  Ultra-wideband is a technology for transmitting information spread over a large bandwidth (>500 MHz); this should, in theory and under the right circumstances, be able to share spectrum with other users. Regulatory settings by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States intend to provide an efficient use of radio bandwidth while enabling high-data-rate personal area network (PAN) wireless connectivity; longer-range, low-data-rate applications; and radar and imaging systems.

The website can have arbitrary files in there. You cant have that if you're still using a particular server somewhere.(but i think it should be able to do both)"

Because nobody ever thought that was a problem worth solving before blockchains.  What about public/private key pairs.  That solves a sort of problem of unified consensus, namely that a document is from somebody.

darknetplan,2cg1dq,autowikibot,3,Sun Aug 3 05:23:11 2014 UTC,"Zooko's triangle:       Zooko's triangle is a diagram named after Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn which sets out a conjecture for any system for giving names to participants in a network protocol. At the vertices of the triangle are three properties that are generally considered desirable for such names:    Human-meaningful: The quality of meaningfulness and memorability to the users of the naming system. Domain names and nicknaming are naming systems that are highly memorable. Decentralized: The lack of a centralized authority for determining the meaning of a name. Instead, measures such as a Web of trust are used. Secure: The quality that there is one, unique and specific entity to which the name maps. For instance, domain names are unique because there is just one party able to prove that they are the owner of each domain name.   Of these three properties, Zooko's conjecture states that no single kind of name can achieve more than two. So the edges of the triangles represent the three possible choices for a naming scheme:   Decentralized and human-meaningful: This is true of nicknames people choose for themselves. Secure and human-meaningful: This is the property that domain names and URLs aim for. Secure and decentralized: This is a property of OpenPGP public key fingerprints.   Zooko's conjecture was disproved through creating practical systems that exhibit all three properties.

We have a lot of listeners out there and we can observe the time it was received by different people if there is a real problem.  By the way google does it I'm referring to the fact that google gives preference to original authors over reposts and does it by establishing a timeline.

In principle no identifiable information should ever exist below the encryption level.  This has interesting implications. For example how do you preform routing if the IP address itself is encrypted? It naturally follows that routing and encryption should be on the same OSI level i.e. they should be one and the same.

That by itself wouldn't bother me; but what does bother me about everything you write, is that you always make things a hundred times more complex than they need to be, and then mistakenly tell yourselves that excessive complexity is somehow ""innovation.""  It isn't.  You don't need to re-invent email, or most of the other things that you think you do, for that matter.  The existing protocols are fine, and more importantly, they are a lot more transparent than the convoluted, object oriented nightmares which you always produce.  All that needs to happen is for people to start running mail servers on their own systems, as well as clients.  We used to do that.   Learn about FTP, IRC, NNTP, and the SMTP/IMAP protocols for email.  Most of you apparently know nothing about these, and you therefore assume that solutions to the problems that you are talking about, do not already exist.  They do.  You don't need p2p file transfer, as one example; if you have a scenario where everyone is running an ftpd as well as a client on their machine, you can end up with the functional equivalent of the same thing.  You won't need bit torrent for reducing bandwidth, either, because the increased number of copies of a given file, will still mean that people can get said file from sufficient multiple sources anyway.  Again, functional equivalency, with a protocol that you don't need to be a genius to understand. Even when new software actually is necessary, please stop writing all of it in object oriented programming languages.  As a paradigm, OOP desperately needs to die.  It's the entire reason for the technical debt crisis, and why programming in general is becoming more and more and more complex, because you just keep piling layers on top of each other.  Worse, you actually believe that what you are doing is good.  Learn C, (not C++) and use the non-OOP parts of Python.  Learn how to use include statements with procedural programming; don't keep using inheritance.  It just makes a mess that you can't keep track of. If you need encryption and are worried about security, then implement encryption for the existing (clear, transparent, simple to understand, discoverable, economically free, non-corporate, NOT written in horrible OOP garbage) protocols.   Apart from anything else, please try to understand one thing.  Please really take this in, and get it into your heads.  You are NOT ""innovating.""

Due to me being a noob on these protocol implementations I can't really debate this with you, since I will most likely be shooting blank arguments with no substance to back them. I imagined that the stronger type system, compile time calculation/checking and templates would make writing core components much more resilient to bugs and still retain performance, though it does limit portability to only architectures/platforms with C++ compilers, which is the biggest problem of all in my view.   The first compiler a platform/architecture usually gets it a C compiler. Having core components in C just makes sense until this holds true."

Good OOP is just as good if not better, especially security and maintainability wise, than good C.  The tools you choose for whatever job you do are completely independent of the code quality you put out.  Edit: Also, piling layers?

Also higher level languages tend to be much more amenable to things like static analysis as they are often better/more tightly defined than languages in which hardware plays a factor in design."

OP clearly has an axe to grind with his quips about ""millennials"" and his rejection of even C++ as unnecessary abstraction of his preference in writing procedural code.    His statements are patently incorrect on the matter and are likely biased by his personal experiences with bad developers, because I see no other reason to be embittered with a reasonable, easy-to-understand abstraction that overall has improved code quality across the board and allowed for large projects with many developers that would be unwieldy, overpriced, and/or unmanageable in a procedural paradigm."

Another is the rise of user experience as the most powerful force in computing. If it doesn't ""just work,"" nobody will use it.

All evils in the world, from war and famine to climate change, can safely be blamed on NAT. Firewalls are slightly less evil, but still lazy.

When you relay off a peer (right now always a supernode), the relaying peer sends VERB_RENDEZVOUS to the two peers using it in an attempt to teach them to fish.  If you had a multi-hop relay path, which might happen if I further decentralize or federate the supernode model, the multi-hop path would gradually flatten itself like this:  (1) A -> B -> C -> D  (2) B sends VERB_RENDEZVOUS to A and C, C sends it to B and D.  (3) next packet goes either A -> C -> D or A -> B -> D depending on which RENDEZVOUS happens sooner.  (4) C unites A and D, or B unites A and D.  (5) A -> D, done.  Right now RENDEZVOUS is only accepted from designated supernodes to avoid the potential for amplification DDOS attacks. In the future further decentralization would require some kind of trust mechanism.

Additionaly, if NAT is present further than 2 hops away, no hole is punched at all as the packet will never reach it.  Next question, the comments regarding DOS attack are confusing. There is overlay network spanning couple hundred millions of nodes which works exactly that way: Bittorrent uTP NAT hole punch extension keeps expiring bucket hash(puncher+punchee) so that no attempt is made more frequently than every few seconds.

darknetplan,2ccadx,NCmeshdude,3,Sun Aug 3 01:45:16 2014 UTC,"I attend the Freifunk meetings in Berlin semi-regularly, and am looking into setting up gear for contribution to the backbone soon. From what I can tell, all of the existing community networks in Europe use either OLSR or batman-adv, or a combination of both. And that makes sense, some of these communities exist for more than a decade, and it works reasonably well. Most of them share very specific problems though:   lack of encryption addressing configuration complexity   All of these are problems where cjdns can be of immediate use, even if only two people peer with each other. My idea is to start ""sneaking"" cjdns into the backbone and end-user firmwares, disabled by default, but ready to use. Right now there is absolutely no need to push for replacing OLSR or batman-adv, especially not if it works and the community has years and years of experience with it.  Just do it the same way as on the Internet: tell people of cjdns, which problems it is trying to solve, and how, and also about how it can run alongside existing infrastructure just fine. Turn one node after the other into a cjdns node.  About the meeting itself: meh. Keep going :) Also don't be afraid to raise your concerns in the meeting. New people often don't return if their first experience is about internal drama -- one sadly has to slap this fact to the drama kings_queens' faces every once in a while."
darknetplan,2ccadx,schmars,1 point,Sat Aug 2 20:21:16 2014 UTC,"First: Good to hear there is interest in CJDNS in Germany.   Freifunk is a good and mature project. It has other and in part very different goals. Which is OK. At some point in the future one has to think about merging or intersecting the scenes in some way or the other. But for now Hyperboria/CJDNS has to be established in this region at all. It would be a very good idea to follow and keep up with Freifunk people and learn from their experiences.   I have to say, though: The personalities drawn to the project and the way it is organised makes me rather want to keep the mesh-local low key. Freifunker who are sincerely interested will find the mesh-local anyway.    Unfortunately the DB is locked at https://wiki.projectmeshnet.org for a while now. Slowly starting /r/offenbachmeshnet/ here. I would like to hear from people loacated in Germany because of the regulatory and organisational challenges."

Maidsafe solves these problems for projects because all projects on the maidsafe network will use any accessible node for their application so part of the critical mass of users condition is met.

It sounds a lot like Freenet The problem is that in order to guarantee that your content is online, half or more of the nodes on the network need to sync a copy, which means that everyone essentially needs a copy of the whole network on their computer. Data ownership and multitenancy are also big problems. How do you securely alter something when you have zero control of which physical copy someone else accesses?"
darknetplan,2blacf,Doubleclit,4,Thu Jul 24 21:45:22 2014 UTC,"It says in the article that because it so quickly recognizes and makes a new copy of ""missing"" data (e.g. a computer is turned off for the night), that only 4 copies of a piece of data need to exist at any one time. That's much less than having the whole network on each computer. It is possible for all four computers being disconnected from the network within the second or so (20 milliseconds claimed) that the network needs to copy the data, but it's not very likely, and it would all come back when one of the computers reconnects. You could always add more copies out in the network, but as long as the network can react fast enough to copies going ""missing,"" it shouldn't be an issue.  As for the data ownership issue, I imagine that every ""website"" or ""app"" (as they seem to be calling it) needs to be public key encrypted. The owner is whoever has the private key. They can encrypt new changes with their key and upload it to the network, which verifies that it's been signed by the private key. Then, that encrypted data is spread throughout the network and is sent to anyone requesting the data, which is then unencrypted with the public key locally. They might do it a different way, but I can't imagine it would be too different. The owner of the data is the one with the private key. That comes with its own pros and cons compared to our current server-client setup."

CJDNS is not intended to be used over the internet, it's meant to supplant the internet, to be used directly as the inter-networking protocol. Auto-peering over the internet is problematic, as CJDNS is not at all designed for that task. There have been attempts to set up public peers in the past, but the effect on the network has always been too negative (it centralizes the network, effectively defeating the purpose of being a meshnet in the first place).  Note that Hyperboria is not ""invite-only"", or private, or any other such thing. You simply need to find your own peers to connect to, and that is only for technical reasons due to the nature of the protocol and it's intended purpose, as I mentioned above.  It can be a bit frustrating at first, I know. Most folks on the IRC channels are away all the time, busy with other things. Even those that are there are often hesitant to peer to openly. You have to understand that when you are asking someone to peer with you, you are asking them to share some of their peers resources with you and to take a certain amount of responsibility for your conduct (at least initially). Be patient, you'll find peers. Once you do, Hyperboria is a very open network!"

Absolutely! That is CJDNS right now! Just not over the internet.  It can be done over the internet, but the thing is, there would be little point. I mean, if everyone is already automatically connecting to each other via their internet IPs, directly over the internet... then why a mesh? Why not just directly connect over the internet without it? There is nothing to gain.  It might help if you explained what it is you're actually looking for."

darknetplan,2ba9cd,me-tan,1 point,Tue Jul 22 09:50:44 2014 UTC,"When you're transmitting passive information like that, a kilobit/s and a kilobit/frame are pretty close... and the FM broadcast radio teletext patent OP mentioned actually gives a rate of transfer, namely 22 bytes every 18ms, which comes to about 10 kilobits/s. (TV Teletext is around 6.5kilobits/s.)  Yes, RDS and teletext differ in their patterns of use, the linked patent even details exactly what makes RDS and radio teletext most different. It's not the bandwidth, it's not the encoding, it's merely that RDS is meant to be consumed immediately, and teletext is meant to be buffered. And yet, RDS can be used to sync your clock, transmit freeform text in sync with an audio program, and pass along traffic data. The only thing stopping a teletext-like system from working with RDS radiotext blocks is the lack of a receiver to concatenate them, and I'm sure, given the prevalence of RDS-capable receiver chips, that it would be far cheaper to construct a radiotext receiver system then it would to go after the slightly higher bandwidth of a patent-controlled system.

darknetplan,2ba9cd,draxenato,2,Sun Jul 27 18:04:22 2014 UTC,"I was a broadcast engineer at the BBC a few years ago, and maintaining their teletext service, CeeFax, was one of my responsibilities.  Our teletext services started in the 70s and remained popular with the general public until the mid 2000s, the analogue service was switched off a few years ago.    Teletext in the UK had severe bandwidth restrictions, our content was embedded in the signal that was already being transmitted for mainstream TV channels. A side effect of a series of upgrades to our transmission standards and the viewers sets in the 1960s had left us with about 4 unused lines of video being sent along with the 625 lines the viewers could see.  Being able to shovel data into those four used lines meant we could provide the service without all the hassle of setting new stations / frequencies etc. So that saved us a load of trouble but we had severe bandwidth limitations, hence the clunky V23 style graphics.  The viewers experience was very much like browsing through a large daily newspaper. We'd transmit several hundred pages per day on a continuous rolling cycle, it could take several minutes to loop thru the entire content.   But the viewing experience was actually pretty good. We, the BBC, had organised the pages logically and the receivers took advantage of that. The pages transmitted were numbered 100 - 999, the 100 range was used for pages of contents, indicies etc. The 200 range was used for news, 300 for sports/weather, 400 travel etc etc There were further subdivisions, so pages 250 onwards was regional news for example. The receivers would cache any pages in the range you were looking at, so in the time it takes you to read the news headlines (page 201) the receiver would also have stored the next few pages in the cycle along with any pages linked to the one you were reading by FasText.  We also used it to transmit computer code during the 80s 8-bit  home computer craze.  Obviously it was just a simplex transmission, there was no back channel or real interactivity for the user, it was very much an electronic newspaper. I could sing its praises for hours but I do think this technology has had it's day."

Possible candadate is the raspberry pi compute modules (http://www.raspberrypi.org/raspberry-pi-compute-module-new-product/) .  It is however easier to stick to mesh network modules (e.g. ZigBee) that exist out there already, and just modify it for your purpose. It may be lower power, but that can be compensated somewhat by better antenna design, and mesh networking. (refer to bottom e.g. flutter)  For me, the most important bit of every device like these, is a micro SD card slot, and a small OLED screen. Why? Because I see this operating mostly in 'listening mode', saving 'pastebin files' in the SD card. Which means when you want to find a text file that is often called in the area, you might have it already in your SD card just be listening. SD cards are pretty massive these days. Also the OLED screen allows for viewing (or sending small messages) latest received messages without having to open your smartphone, especially if its lost or broken.     Another argument for maybe switching to a small SoC (system on chip solution), is that any one of those device can act as an impromptu base station. E.g. relays, or BBSes.

I'm wondering how they're gonna get past the FCC with that...I'm guessing it's MURS based. Part 95 doesn't mention encryption, and limits output power to 2 watts, so it's pretty clear to connect the dots.   In any case, the only way they're going to get 50 miles on 2 watts is in space, basically. Or through repeaters, which is prohibited in MURS."

I further question if they've got a clue about the legal framework they must get the device licensed under.  They are touting full end-to-end encryption on the MURS band - (EDIT it turns out there is no explicit restriction for encryption on MURS, cool!)  They say in their FAQ that this device can be used anywhere in the world on trips.  That's an ignorant statement at best, as using this device in most places outside the US will be illegal.  I also think people will be pretty disappointed when they can't hit half of the 50 mile communication radius they're saying this thing gets.  There's no external antenna connector from what I can tell, so even if you wanted to put up an aerial for the maximum height/gain you're SOL.  Finally, they admit that they have yet to get FCC certification and won't ship until ""late fall"" (again in the FAQ).

darknetplan,2az9fm,faustoc4,3,Thu Jul 17 22:58:25 2014 UTC,bandwidth ?
darknetplan,2az9fm,frothface,7,Thu Jul 17 20:46:31 2014 UTC,"Yes, bandwidth. If it's MURS, it's 6.25khz, so datarate is going to be crap. No darknet on this guy.  Edit: Let me say that datarate is crap for darknet, as with most radio technologies, but it's not the hardware's fault. This thing looks pretty damn awesome for what it's designed for.  That's the problem that we're in. It's not the hardware that is the issue, it's (1) getting license free spectrum in a wide channel that will travel a reasonable distance, and (2), having clear channels in that spectrum. Once that's available, then we can work on (3) affordable hardware for said spectrum.  The problem with all of this is that 1 and 2 are almost mutually exclusive. Cellular and WIFI frequencies and power levels were chosen specifically to LIMIT range, therefore allowing smaller 'cells' of communication so that the frequencies can be reused over relatively small areas. If it travels farther, you will have more interference from other users, not because more people will want to use it (although, they will), but because you will cover a larger area."
darknetplan,2az9fm,ZeoNet,1 point,Fri Jul 18 02:00:39 2014 UTC,"First off, you almost certainly wouldn't be able to set up cjdns (or any non-goTenna-supported data system) over the goTenna itself in the first place. It looks like it's only compatible with their own app, and I'd bet that there's some hardware magicry to prevent tinkering.  Secondly, if you're on the upper two channels of MURS where it's legal to use up to 10kHz bandwidth, it would be trivial to add an IF tap to a standard MURS radio and transmit 9600 baud FSK over it. 9600bps probably isn't enough for cjdns, but it should be enough to provide a very limited text-only backbone of some sort, given enough effort."

In a variety of states, there are laws on the books to keep cities out of the telecoms business, generally pushed through by existing dominant telecoms companies.  Although they have clearly pushed these laws through for their own benefit, and city-run telecoms would help to fight the existing monopolies, I am not sure that city-run telecom is really a good idea overall. If someone governmental wants to shut down the Internet in a municipal telecom system, they already own it so they can just flip a switch.  The ideal situation for me would be lots of small telecom companies, none of which would be really happy competing against a municipal provider either. But I suppose in the short term, monopoly and government is probably better than monopoly alone."

This is an amendment about whether or not you think the FCC or your elected state government will make the best decisions about your internet.

A quarter wavelength in this frequency range is somewhere around 19 inches, and this device can't be more than about 7 inches long. Unless this thing ships with an adapter for an external antenna, or uses some sort of super-freaky fractal antenna system (hint: it probably doesn't), the advertised range almost certainly won't be applicable unless both parties are unusually high above mean local ground level, and angling the devices just right so that the device on the other end is within the main lobe of the antenna's radiation pattern.

darknetplan,2awy62,jercos,1 point,Fri Jul 18 01:45:46 2014 UTC,"Well, apparently netstat now defaults to showing both v6 and v4 tables when family isn't specified, so that's neat. Your routing tables look fine, however your VPN does set overriding routes for all hosts that would otherwise fall through to a default route. It's possible your VPN doesn't pass cjdns' traffic properly, for example they might only NAT TCP traffic. If that's the case, then turning on your VPN will always break hyperboria, unless you set specific routes for your peers not going through the VPN. Host routes would have to be remade whenever you change networks, so if this is a laptop moving from network to network, that would be something to redo every time you connect to a network. That's scriptable, but annoying.  It's also possible that your DNS would be reset by the VPN to a set of servers that don't return IPv6 AAAA records. If you can reach hyperboria sites by IPv6 address, but not by name, this would be the most likely case. This would mean cjdns can connect to its peers, but your browser never sees a domain like uppit.us as having a hyperboria address to reach, so the traffic never goes to cjdns. Since your traffic (including cjdns and DNS) is already going over your VPN, if this is the case it's safe to set a public DNS service (OpenDNS, google DNS, etc.) as your DNS server rather than your VPN's DNS server."

For each higher price point, you'll get more speed out of the link at that distance.  The locos have the smallest antenna, however can link up at that distance without issue, at 4 miles, they may be capable of 100Mb/s throughput.  Although I haven't tested them at this distance.  According to Ubiquiti, they're good for links up to 15Km.  With the Nanostations, they have a bit stronger antenna, so they can go a bit further, or offer more throughput at the same distance.   Physically, that's the only difference between the nano, and the loco... the antenna power, and the Nano's are a bit taller because of this.  They both sport a 45 degree horizontal plane.    The powerbridge would be the mother of point to point links in this scenario.  Not only the most powerful antenna of the trio, but also the most directional, meaning a connection that is less plagued with interference (if there is any), as well as a more focused shot."

The physical layout of Boulder probably makes it a little awkward to get wireless going. Obviously if there's anyone from Boulder that sees this they can chime in better.   I bet if we started doing it in more places along the front range - even only if there's a couple nodes - and we polish the images more and more, ""regular"" people will find the idea of a ""2nd internet"" is feasible. If there's three cities around that have meshnets going, it'll seem less like a tinfoil hat idea and more like an actual resilient network that even they can join.   It's good that there's more people in Colorado interested. It might take a bit of going back and forth between the three groups over the next year(s?) to figure out what convinces people to join and a good way to start from the ground up. Seattle didn't sprout up overnight so it'll take time for any of the three projects to reach critical mass but once one does, we should be able to get all of them to do the same.

darknetplan,2ankbb,recipriversexcluson,2,Mon Jul 14 10:01:18 2014 UTC,"This isn't exactly a conventional maser. It's a pretty new solid-state maser.  A hydrogen maser operates at one frequency because that's fundamentally how it works. Hydrogen releases a specific frequency when exited. But this is using a very very different technique to generate the signal.  So maybe not. The nature article certainly implied it didn't. I've found the research paper, hopefully it will shed some more light on the subject. They do mention it being used as a low-noise amplifier, which implies it covers a range. I don't really know the terminology though."
darknetplan,2ankbb,RoninK,1 point,Mon Jul 14 10:04:59 2014 UTC,"Lasers and masers are monochromatic.  Monochromaticity and unidirectionality are the properties that make them so energy efficient, which is why they're desirable in the first place.  There's really no new physical phenomena here - just the discovery that a certain material lases at a microwave frequency.  The Nature article says the new maser operates at about 1.42Ghz, whereas wifi carrier frequencies are 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz.  So, if you had this maser you couldn't use it to directly amplify the signal from your wifi transmitter.    What you could probably do instead forget the wifi transmitter and modulate the maser's own output with the signal you want to transmit.  However, the receiver antenna would have to be tuned to the 1.42Ghz frequency, so you couldn't use your existing wifi receivers either."
darknetplan,2ankbb,jercos,1 point,Mon Jul 14 23:45:55 2014 UTC,"The research paper says that it's tunable, in a few different ways, and can act as an amplifier. I'm not seeing any reason why it's stuck at exactly that frequency.  Looking at the research paper, it looks like they went to a lot of trouble to get it to 1.42Ghz, so they can use it as a clock source in place of hydrogen masers. It naturally hovers around ~1.45Ghz, with their setup.  You're not really saying anything, other then ""lasers are monochromatic because lasers are monochromatic"". You could very well be correct, but there's no new information for me to work off in all of that. I picture it more like a transistor or a vacuum tube, that happens to lase because the pump source is a laser.  It would work just as well with an LED pump source, but it wouldn't lase. The laser properties you're saying are always monochromatic come from a different component."
darknetplan,2ankbb,jercos,7,Tue Jul 15 08:44:17 2014 UTC,"802.11a/b/g/n all rely on PSK. Is the ""cascade"" fast enough to retain phase information in the resulting burst, and if so how much? I am no science guy, Bill or otherwise, but it seems like this could force one down into QPSK or BPSK... on the other hand, if those are feasible that still leaves a potential rate around a hundred megabits per second, since 40 MHz channels aren't any kind of problem on a tight beam.  Similarly, can the maser be returned to the metastable state between one PSK symbol and another? It sounds like a slow process compared to the sub-microsecond breaks between each symbol, but obviously no speed data given on those scales.  I'm cautiously optimistic, and am definitely going to take some time to learn more about lasers."

Similarly, can the maser be returned to the metastable state between one PSK symbol and another?   Think of it as more of a transistor or vacuum tube.  It's made up of a lot of parts. You're not discharging the ""maser"", you're discharging the energy of a bunch of pentacene molecules. The crystal is made up of a lot of pentacene molecules, and you shouldn't be discharging all of them at once.  So I don't think that's really a factor.

If this significantly widens an input pulse, then it means much less information can be transmitted using it in a given span of time.  Of course if the output is solely comprised of microwaves of the input wavelength, then I can only presume there is no widening of pulses, as that would create a mess of harmonics in the output. That might be putting too much weight on an offhand statement about the composition of the output of an experimental device though."

People are comparing this to a hydrogen maser, when it seems to behave more like a cascade tube from old night vision devices. All of the ""laser"" properties come from the fact that the pump source is a laser. Replace the pump source with a standard light and it would behave like an amplifier."
darknetplan,2ankbb,Senatorsmiles,2,Tue Jul 15 12:06:33 2014 UTC,"This is a very interesting development, but it's misleading to claim that a maser is somehow within reach of hobbyists.    The guy who built the thing not a layman.  He's an experimental physicist at the UK National Physical Laboratory.   The 'spare chemicals' are not the kind you might find in your bathroom cupboard.  They were laboratory supplies provided by Imperial College London. The 'old medical laser on ebay' is not spare parts like you might find in an old CD player.  It's an industrial-strength dye laser that produces a whopping 4J of pulse energy.  I found another one on ebay, and it's going for about $1500: http://www.ebay.com/itm/CANDELA-SPTL-1B-VASCULAR-LESION-/280930237507 BONUS: Dye lasers are also notoriously difficult to work with, in particular because the dye itself is rather hazardous: http://www.sciencelab.com/msds.php?msdsId=9927579 I don't even want get into the materials processing techniques they used to grow, cut, and polish the pentacene crystal.  That's all way outside my realm of expertise.     Point is, this is serious lab work, not a hobbyist's weekend project.

I promise, I'm not an idiot, but when I read the FAQ's and getting started's, my eyes glaze over. I don't want to learn all about the current version of cjdns and how to compile it and what the current bugs are, then have to repeat that frequently. My brain is full with my day job, my side job, my family schedule, my refinancing project, etc, etc. I need the zeroconf version of cjdns or hyperboria or whatever.  Show me the kit on Amazon that I order, show me the binaries (with convenient, web-based GUI for administration), show me how to find local nodes to join. I know this sounds whiny and needy, but I need this level of guidance in order to meaningfully contribute.  Now, if I've missed some super-simple, click-through wizardly version of cjdns or whatever I need, please point me in that direction. But I think a good test is to try to have one of your parents install cjdns on a supported router and bring it online. If they can do it, please share whatever instructions they followed. If they get stuck or confused, apply yourself to whatever step is holding them up.  That's my suggestion, fwiw."

Please try to be efficient with the channel and width selections. Since this is an unlicensed band you will chew a lot of the available spectrum for your backup links which is gonna be great until someone gets pissed off with you for ruining their shot and they get into competition mode with you. Putting up radios blasting at you for no reason other than to ruin your connections.  The 24GHz limitations are not so much based on distance as they are weather.

There is plenty of software and various ideas but nothing that is practical enough.  If you were to ask any network engineer to set up a network, this would be easy.  If you were to ask a bunch of random people in one area to set up a network, there is really nothing they can get on the market that would allow them to do this without at least some understanding of network protocols, etc.  There needs to be an easy to set up device that 'just works'.  It needs to support many routing protocols (to be compatible with other mesh networks).  It needs to advertise locally its existence (via wifi) and allow auto-peering.  Also, mesh networks need an immediate use to be attractive, so, Internet access sharing through the meshnet would be a good one.  This means this ""meshnet access device"" would need to have infrastructure for acting as an Internet gateway and also be able to search and connect to a nearby gateway and seamlessly route Internet traffic for user's lan.  You could help with development of such a device."

Is WiFi in residences in general not allowed on some level or is it more complicated than that? Is the email thing along the same lines, are people just not allowed to have it, or is it not readily accessible because of the Internet/infrastructure?  Thanks for sharing."
darknetplan,28z7ha,kraymo,2,Tue Jun 24 20:10:20 2014 UTC,"FYI - I'm working with asbruckman on this project.  As I understand it, local residences aren't usually allowed to have WiFi. Normally, only businesses have it and it's still rare to find a business that has WiFi (most have a cable connection or even dial-up).  People are allowed to have email but you have to get an email account from your place of employment. So if you don't require email to do your job it's difficult to get your own account.   As asbruckman said, the written and unwritten rules are different and they change. The people constantly find workarounds."

darknetplan,28z7ha,kraymo,2,Tue Jun 24 22:54:45 2014 UTC,"Heyyyyooooooo,  Junior Sysadmin here, went to Cuba for a week (just back in March actually) and got a good handle of the electronics situation there. I'm not at all an expert nor do I have any authority whatsoever on the matter, but I think I can get you thinking in the right mindset.  Anyways, you're completely right about the smartphone thing, which is an interesting platform to start on. I noticed that a ton while I was down there. The major questions are as follows   Do you want to do this legally? What will it be used for? Who's going to use it?   The answer to number 2 is a huge influence on #1.  If you want to do this legally, you have to be extremely careful but it is definitely possible. A little crazy but still possible.  Illegal is a strange boundary there. Anything that is perceived as illegal can be considered illegal, so honestly anything you ""plan"" to do will probably be considered illegal. I'm not saying you're suggesting this is even a thought but I just want to put it out there  Now I'm not saying that doing it would hurt the country in any way, but that's just not how the country is built  Now we move on to that glorious #2, wat. Wat is an important question. Particularly, you have to decide if the answer to wat is worth the risk. Communication? What kind of communication? Legal communication? Porn? It isn't going to be easy, even if it's legal, to wire and wifi an entire country. And on top of that, legal or not, someones going to find out about it and someones going to monitor whatever is going on.  Lastly, #3, who is going to use it? Everyone who has a phone? Who's going to provide it? Those people barely have enough money to get a decent set of clothes, they're not going to have enough to build a datacenter. Are you going to show up on Cuban soil and distribute servers? This one doesn't really change HOW you set it up, it just might change your mindset on it as a whole  The bottom line is, is it crazy? Yeah, it is. Can you do it? definitely, is it worth the risk? I'm not in the position to gauge that.  Now with all that being said, I think Cuba is in the perfect place to accept (and in all honesty, need) this kind of thing. With the country opening up a bit as far as businesses and exports go, they need an infrastructure to base that on, and to help communicate and share information. So I think its an important thing to implement, but it is going to be exceedingly difficult and potentially dangerous to everyone involved.  TL;DR: This is just crazy enough to work and could help a lot of people  Also, feel free to throw me a pm if you want to discuss it more, I'm not at all the most knowledgeable person here, but I could point you in the right direction, and lastly, this might be a terribly written piece of garbage but I'm tired and I'm not editing it right now."

darknetplan,28ugr0,phishfi,3,Mon Jun 23 14:10:30 2014 UTC,Exactly. I'm also pretty sure ISPs can't handle ~95% usage on every account 24/7. They rely on people using only a small part of their bandwidth.

darknetplan,28i22v,kschmidt62226,5,Thu Jun 19 04:15:02 2014 UTC,"Ideally, everyone should be using https, so all the exit node can monitor is that someone communicated x bytes of data with website y at time z.  Knowing that the site is getting at least that much traffic and the times might be significant, admittedly.   The main point here is the payment system to incentivize mesh network growth and bandwidth sharing.  The fact that a Tor-like darknet could use the same payment system is an afterthought, as is the idea that the mesh system and the darknet could be the same system, just by adding a configurable option to add superfluous hops to the path for privacy at the cost of latency and additional payment."
darknetplan,28i22v,ChaosMotor,-5,Thu Jun 19 04:34:37 2014 UTC,"Let's break it down.  To figure out who is passing what data, you need to track the data leaving exit nodes.  This has been a known vulnerability since at least '07.  The NSA, having spy operations in essentially (assumptively / presumably) all (or at least a reasonable portion of) the peering points in the USA (see William Binney '03, do you think SF is the only AT&T peering point to be bugged?), and having the budgets to support not only a large number of exit nodes but in diverse geographic locations (here's a partial list of AT&T's peering point locations), can determine with relatively good quality who is connected to TOR and what they're transmitting.  Oh, and the NSA uses your Google Ads to further pinpoint who's using TOR and what they're sending.   Oh and by the way, the USA can use ""National Security Letters"" to forge SSL certificates and the SSL Cert issuing body can't legally tell you if the USA has used an NSL to compel them to forge SSL certificates.   TOR? I got three letters: LOL."

For example I setup a nanostation as an uplink running olsrd, then used a pile of 802.11b routers to provide client access.  For ADHOC mesh you need to be very specific about the radio hardware used. They are very interesting, but I find all adhoc style mesh networking to be frustrating due to intrinsic performance problems vs a model where access and distribution are running on separate radio units.

By default, it should attempt to autopeer with with any other willing devices. It might also be good for them to be able to auto connect to any open wifi to peer on the Internet as well (should also work by providing credentials). Any unused radios should be turned off when not in use It would be a good idea for the antenna to be able to be replaced with parabolic dishes if people want some real range. Sell these too if that is possible. the devices should not be sold to run off of battery power. Instead, sell compatible battery packs that just hook up to the DC power jack. Maybe some way for the battery pack to attach to the device would be good (Hook and loop fastener or whatever). The software put on them must be 100% open source, except firmware if no other option is available. The software must autoupdate unless turned off. Updates should be properly signed, and other peers should offer newer versions of the software if they have them.

The code is touring Turing complete, so you could literally do anything with it.  Highly applicable to MeshNet. Even if it isn't useful for building an antenna or router, it could be useful for anything where 2 or more entities (people, routers, servers, or anything else) need to come to a consensus. A smart contract could be designed to pay nodes for supplying bandwidth without the risk of someone gaming the system. They could be designed to prevent DOS attacks by allowing all nodes to come to a consensus and agree to blacklist a malicious node.  If anyone is curious, check out /r/Ethereum/."

darknetplan,27cdvh,SirLordWombat,3,Thu Jun 5 12:41:02 2014 UTC,"Im sure it has something to do with the frequency. Not all are taken. The problem if i recall is the low band frequencies can go through solid objects easily with out losing packets, and the higher the frequencies the more trouble it has to go through objects. But higher frequencies has way better range, so people mount these strong antennas high above any objects that would block the signal. It has to have a clear view almost from each point this they are on poles and above houses because even branches mess it up. For example thats why 2.4hz is more reliable than 5.0hz. I think they had something on the sidebar some and sites that explains it. O i recall some kick starters also, but i never kept track to see what came of it. Side note, some one with out a hang over probably is more knowledgable.  Ps i think college radios use open frequencies/bands. The reason the fcc makes it illegal to use X or Y band/frequency is because diferent stations or companys buy them. I think. Damn you booze"
darknetplan,27cdvh,intensely_human,3,Thu Jun 5 13:11:31 2014 UTC,"What about lasers?  This would only work on a one-transmitter-per-connection basis, but that's how lots of WAN connections work already.    Something like a cluster with a hundred little laser transmitters and receivers which could rotate to focus in different directions.  Conceivably each of these could have firmware to detect other signal sources an negotiate connections.    We're talking about some pretty serious hardware here, and would still be limited by line of sight, but the range could probably be pretty good."
darknetplan,27cdvh,intensely_human,1 point,Thu Jun 5 16:41:31 2014 UTC,"the problem here is you have to know of a point to connect to it.  It isnt like wifi where you can just scan and join. Its also not very scaleable.  I see people using directional to get better range, but that defeats the purpose. It needs to be omniderectional, with a range of ~2-3 miles to be practical. Also all devices should be the same, not some point to multipoint, that is to reliant on the multipoint to function."
darknetplan,27cdvh,AutismHour,1 point,Thu Jun 5 17:48:57 2014 UTC,"Conceivably such an ""eyeball cluster"" could automatically detect other instances by sweeping the laser or something.    We're talking about some seriously technical shit here, like robotics from Star Trek.    Or the other thing would be to have the owners arrange a connection, which does introduce some centralization to the social aspect of building the network.    The basic pros would be anyone could set one up on their own property, and no new infrastructure (read: permission from government) would be necessary to establish a connection.    So while it may not fall under meshnet definitions (I'm not a regular so I'm not sure how project specs are defined), I do think this would address some of the concerns that exist for existing internet (reliance on government-owned property).    Ideally any system would be omnidirectional with broadcast, but I do want to remind that point-to-known-point dedicated connections are definitely part of the existing internet and can be a part of an essentially decentralized system as long as they're redundant and use packet switching."

Of course that could never be done but the powers sought to attempt it are not ones we want to exist.  The new version of net neutrality is just a sugarcoat for the original net neutrality.  Even its current premiss is weak.  As described it is preventative of a situation that would never exist.  We're essensially saying that Comcast is going to prevent content that is generally available on the internet (or more ridiculous slow it) because of a political bias and thus break the semantic web for all of its users.  No way.  They would loose customers so fast if random blogs weren't available.  Their benefit for doing such a thing would never pay out and be really ineffective if not counter productive at preventing opinions being expressed.  Just like I mentioned that it is supposedly preventative of a situation that would never exist.  Wouldn't it be silly to grant powers to the government to control the internet for a situation that may not come about but once given those powers could never be taken away.  We've had ISPs for a long time.  If it were ever in their interest to do something like that we would have examples of that.

darknetplan,26l6gl,kylestarkey1,15,Tue May 27 07:09:35 2014 UTC,"Amazing, another ham radio thread! I'm glad people are interested and all, but the concept of using pretty much anything but wifi has been hashed over and hashed over. Other ISM-band radio might work for some very specific links, but magical high-bandwidth backhauls won't spring forth from a 300kHz wide block around 27MHz, and low bandwidth links will be entirely unsuitable for a replacement internet.  This type of thing could be set up for emergency communication, I hear when the night's just so, a CB radio operator can hit Texas from California, but over long ranges like that bandwidth becomes less sharable and more an absolute reservation for a particular station (TDMA requires that either there is a central master station, or that each party can tell when another is transmitting. Add whole light-milliseconds to the relationship and it becomes clear that FDMA is the only way to go). Cut up that 300kHz of ISM spectrum for say, 10 operators of stations, 30kHz is not a lot to do anything with. Even in a perfectly ideal case, you're looking at 150kbit/s transmit per operator (5bits/s/Hz is a very generous spectral efficiency assumption). The assumption can be made that it's possible to receive from all the other individual stations at once, meaning your downlink is possibly 1.35Mbit/s. That's making some very powerful assumptions about how you're modulating data, about coordinating the setup of these stations, about reception quality... and that doesn't scale at all. 20 people get half that speed even in the same insanely idealistic conditions, and that downlink is in total, not a single stream. All together, at 20 stations, that's barely enough to have a decent quality digital conference call, let alone image-heavy web browsing as would naturally arise from an sort of mesh-based social networking, video hosting, or... anything really.  All those numbers however, are just thrown together theory, with assumptions made that are almost certainly impossible to replicate in reality, thanks to many many factors. For example, 5bits/s/Hz is better than the maximum potential of any wifi standard prior to 802.11ac, which caps out at a potential 5.42. Any encoding scheme designed to handle the problems of travelling for miles and miles through the air and still be receivable would in all probability not just be less efficient, but drastically less efficient. Additionally, that 1.35Mbit/s number above isn't the actual rate you'd pull down for any one stream, and unless all of your peers are coordinating and sending you different parts of the same data (meshtorrent?), any one stream or download would only have as much bandwidth as was allocated to the one station sending it to you.  Of course, these ten nodes would only be for a backhaul between nodes, right? Well, to make the expense of a radio backhaul actually worth it instead of linking over the internet to connect local mesh networks, you'd have to have tens if not hundreds of nodes attached to each backhaul node... all sharing the same probably-way-less-than 150kbit/s link. Dial-up starts to look temptingly fast.  If you were thinking that individual mesh users would participate in the HF portion, well, we're not talking about cheap radio equipment. This would have to be specially designed for long-range digital bidirectional communication, specifically set up to modulate digital data, not a modem connected to an audio transceiver. If you had something audio-coupled in mind, you can send any potential bandwidth there was to have down the drain right there, and just start mailing each other SD cards.  TL;DR if you want to stay legal, either everyone needs an expensive licence, or you get so little spectrum as to be useless for mesh backhaul."

(emphasis mine)  To stress one particular point, everyone hears everyone else without interference in a perfect world.  You get 1.35Mb/s and I get 1.35Mb/s, but it's the exact same data we're both hearing -- the system has 1.35Mb/s down total in this perfect theoretical world."

In that case the respective downlink would be the quoted figure.  In the context of the other rather insane assumptions I'm making, that this system is a perfect ideal multicast network isn't the largest.  You are however, also completely correct in tossing that concept to the ground, especially considering how much traffic is unicast these days... for the system in use, even for a multi-stream download, the actual bandwidth would be far lower, and probably significantly lower than 150kbit/s, even with the assumptions made to get a 150kbit/s stream."
darknetplan,26l6gl,jercos,5,Wed May 28 08:26:09 2014 UTC,"To be fair, very low bandwidth radio could still be quite useful for things like IRC and email. I believe there were a few systems networked together in this manner - over very low bandwidth radio, very good for communication in emergencies.  It's certainly no replacement internet, but it would be interesting, and somewhat useful until more proper mesh networks begin to spring up. I should also note that your hypothetical ideal of 1.35 Mbit/s is actually what many people - including me - living in rural areas can expect for internet connectivity.   I looked and saw that there were some amateur radio bands open in the VHF band but I don't know what the laws regarding those are. Those wouldn't be quite as low a frequency so there's still actual bandwidth, but still go up to 100 miles. It's still very easy to get a mesh network setup because of the distance allowance."
darknetplan,26l6gl,tiffany352,1 point,Tue May 27 11:43:56 2014 UTC,"The 1.35Mbit/s number was hyperbole stacked on hyperbole. The average speed would be well under 150kbit/s in that system, and the only potential case for ever reaching even close to a megabit would be if you were taking up the whole system's bandwidth into your downlink, which could occur if every single node was passing you unicast data, or if the network was a multicast network, fully saturated, and you were subscribed to every single packet.  Low bandwidth networks are neat, and being able to set a small one up for a communication platform is quite a practical skill, but a mesh network needs a lot of bandwidth for maintenance, be it passing routes around, or simply avoiding an accidental DoS from a couple people trying to download a photo.  Anything actually using amateur radio bands will have much more bandwidth, but becomes automatically useless for mesh networking use due to the heavy restrictions against cryptography and commercial use placed on a ham license. On the other hand if you don't care about legality, there are a gigahertz or so of bands that could be conquered by the metaphorical ship of a pirate radio station and used for extended digital hops, but at that point you're breaking all kinds of regulations, and the appropriate regulatory authorities will shut you and anyone else doing the same down. ""For your own good.""  There are niches in radio for legal long-distance digital communication, but those niches are not suitable for mesh network backhaul, nor really for anything more complex than a point to point link to carry a small amount of—likely textual—information from one individual to another. You can rationalize smaller and smaller allocations of bandwidth for people, after all, ""we got by fine with dial-up modems once, right?"" Now your network holds 40 people total. ""Well dial-up modems weren't always that fast, we dealt with much slower speeds!"" Okay, now your network holds 200 people, and takes a minute or more to send a page full of text from point A to point B.  And when you start something that spans hundreds of miles of occupied land, 200 people is microscopic."

darknetplan,26l6gl,jercos,1 point,Wed May 28 13:36:19 2014 UTC,"I haven't been in the previous HF threads (just found /r/darknetplan) but I see a few points worth taking up.  I don't believe that the only useful things to do on the Internet are have conference calls or stream YouTube cat videos.  These definitely are high-bandwidth applications of the Internet, but there's a lot more to what we do with the Net.  First, there's text based content.  Like reddit forms, email, Twitter, text messaging, etc.  This kind of content can definitely fit inside of narrow bandwidth modes.  The benefit of doing this stuff over HF is that short of jamming or broken equipment, these services will not go down.  There is extremely high availability.  The second important part of the Internet is the infrastructure, which includes things like address resolution and DNS.  With HF, we could share addresses across national boundaries and for instance prevent poisoned DNS caches.  This is just the most obvious idea, but there's a lot more exciting research to be done here.  Note that almost all of the examples I gave do not rely on encryption.  DNS, reddit, Twitter public messages, all do not use encryption for the content.  Using encryption to authenticate is absolutely legal on amateur bands - just not encrypted content.  Finally, here's an example for you as to why low bandwidth, high power HF (AKA Broadcast) is actually high bandwidth.  FM stations in my home city (LA) have 10+M listeners.  The RDS subcarrier is given at ~1kbps in ~15kHz of bandwith.  So, that's 10 million people getting 1kbps of data in 15kHz of bandwidth -- or 10 Gigabits per second.  That's a lot of bandwidth for just 15kHz of spectrum.  TL;DR don't write off HF just yet - we haven't even scratched the surface of what can be done."
darknetplan,26l6gl,KD2BMH,1 point,Sat May 31 16:26:31 2014 UTC,"The key to keep in mind is that 1kb/s of data is from one central location. No other users can send data, and without a return channel you just have broadcast radio. Additionally, no matter how much total bandwidth the channel carries, you're still only moving 1kbps of data.  Take Twitter feeds for example, each tweet has some simple metadata (the username the tweet belongs to, the ID, the ID of the tweet this tweet is a reply to if applicable, a timestamp), and then up to 140 characters of data. Characters don't map cleanly to bytes, but let's pretend they do... if you're pushing out more than 3-4 tweets per second, you've managed to overwhelm that ""10 gb/s"", and all the while this whole thing is completely unusable for posting tweets.  Any application designed around narrowband broadcast streams will need to be just that: not an existing platform of one-to-one communication, but completely designed for selective reception multicast. This'll work great for stock tickers, news services, perhaps even a broadcast of music (though not under a Ham license) or voice content... all the sorts of things broadcast radio is already used for.  In any of these cases, the central transmitter has complete control over these services, and as they're unencrypted, can selectively censor them, or even potentially alter them. (I similarly don't believe Ham licenses would prevent use of cryptographic signatures... but where would the PKI to verify a given key come from other than the same broadcast channel? If the broadcaster wants to block a claim of a given domain, what stops them from doing so, and simply replacing the broadcast of that signed name to IP mapping advertisement with their own signed advertisement?)  A Reddit concept would face similar bandwidth issues to the Twitter concept, as probably would a DNS concept eventually, especially if these all share the same channel, and all of this ignores that a return path isn't provided, and each local mesh would need a large, powerful, expensive transmitter and antenna arrangement to either reach every single other station, or to reach a central station, or even more precious bandwidth would need to be sacrificed towards routing protocols and relaying messages for other nodes... before you know it, even starting with hundreds of kb/s, the application bandwidth trickles down to an unreliable 1-2, and a huge network can be brought to its knees by a few hundred users posting tweets.  Ham radio is brilliant for small communities sharing information of one kind or another over long distances, but once you start growing the number of nodes involves, and more critically growing the number of users trying to move even a tiny amount of data through a single node, it quickly becomes impractical.  TL;DR ham and mesh both have amazing potential, but not together."
darknetplan,26l6gl,jercos,2,Sat May 31 23:34:44 2014 UTC,"First, if you send the tweet to every user over cables, it still uses a ton of bandwidth.  But sharing everyone's public broadcast messages via radio broadcast means that it only has to be sent once, and everyone receives it.  So the effect is the same as sending it to each user individually, and the benefit is that no cables were involved.  I bring up broadcast because it's the right mentality for what you are able to do with an Amateur License.  You are acting as an independent agent, as long as you follow the FCC rules (no cussing, encrypting, or commercial business.)  If this wouldn't work, and there's too little bandwidth, then APRS shouldn't exist and run on only one narrow channel per band.  This website shouldn't have all the data: http://aprs.fi/  With respect to requiring long range, expensive, powerful transmitters to reach other nodes... have you ever done any work on HF?  I agree that antennas can get quite long, though there are plenty of techniques for making smaller, efficient antennas.  Also, the crew of Amateurs that classify themselves as QRP are into sub 5W power amplifiers on transmitters, and can still communication around the world.  Are these 'powerful' radios more expensive than your 1990's car radio?  Sure.  Are they more expensive than your smartphone or what's in 2014 automobiles?  No.  Finally, the killer application of the Internet is that it connects ALL previous networks, so there's no silos.  So if you want the mesh net to be the Internet, then it's going to have to work harmoniously with Internet infrastructure from all sources -- including telecom and (the way I see it) Amateur.  2.4GHz + 5GHz WiFi won't be enough if you really want truly decentralized, global networks.  Amateur won't be enough.  And we know telecom isn't enough.  It's a mixture of it all that will take us across the finish line.  I see a bright future for all of these technologies, blanketing the world with Internet.  Heterogeneous communications with radio waves from DC to daylight.  This is the future of the Internet."
darknetplan,26l6gl,spkx,1 point,Sun Jun 1 16:19:33 2014 UTC,"The difference with tweets on the internet is active vs. passive. Sending each tweet costs the same low amount of bandwidth, and then viewing those tweets costs that amount of bandwidth again. It doesn't monopolize that amount of bandwidth for every single user, only once for the sender, and once for each viewer. Since most tweets are viewed by a limited audience, scaling to 1gb/s is plenty for a traditional service (a performance blog from 2013 gives 22MB/s, or 176Mb/s, and the comments justify that much bandwidth for sent tweets alone), but as a broadcast service every tweet has to factor into the unique bandwidth, not the total bandwidth.  APRS works at least in part because of the massive APRS-IS backbone, and in fact if I'm reading http://aprs.fi/ correctly, the vast majority of stations it sees actually provide their data directly to APRS-IS, and many of the exceptions seem to use VHF APRS on varying frequencies, not HF APRS. The remainder of APRS works simply because it's passing sparse, short messages over low-hopcount paths, which would not be the case for any single radio link needing to handle anything approaching the massive flurry of tweets that a platform near the scale of twitter would use.  APRS' store-and-forward techniques certainly provide a functional network without requiring high-cost receivers or transmitters, and offer the potential to do so without requiring separate frequencies for each transmitter so long as the actual throughput is sufficiently low (weather stations are a fine example of this), and my remarks with regards to expensive powerful transmitters were in reference to a hypothetical higher bandwidth system with dedicated frequencies per transmitter. In fact, I probably should have said transceiver instead, as picking up every station in range would be necessary to making such a FDMA system usable, and SDR isn't quite cheaper than most smartphones yet. (I don't own a cellular phone, so really any radio transmitter would be more powerful than my smartphone :p )  In any case I fully agree that the costs to get into APRS either by HF, VHF, or especially internet are significantly lower than the costs to set up a transmitter for a theoretical extremely wide-band digital modulation, and an even wider band SDR (all of which would at very least violate the spirit of a Ham license, and so would be relegated to commercial HF)  As to interoperability, that's partially the issue. Is any part of the internet BGP-linked over IP over AX.25 on amateur bands? I highly doubt it, given how many people use SSL/TLS for basic communications. Nothing about e.g., cjdns is in any way linked to 802.11, and in fact it can use any link that can provide an ethernet interface or can handle UDP/IP packets, which covers everything the current internet can run over and (potentially) more.  Using a Ham link to connect a meshnet to another meshnet is completely technically feasible (though slow compared to what the mesh is currently used for), but without the ability to trust ever single user not to violate your license in some way, this is not yet a solution to the mesh. Even within APRS, APRS-IS to RF gateways have to deal with these issues, and the problem would only become more and more extreme as a meshnet grew around such a link.  I like your vision of a bright future, but an internet-compatible meshnet needs high bandwidth connectivity, especially for backhaul links. The future may be as you describe, but the present isn't quite there yet."

I dont remember how or what but hawaii was providing us with the slowest connect I have ever seen. Made our satilite connection look fast lol. since I have become quite the conspiracy nut and thought that this might be a way that we could get the news out if the government continues to shut us down.
darknetplan,26l6gl,alwayswrongagain,3,Tue May 27 18:14:18 2014 UTC,"As ham radio guy myself it's great to see people in this community starting to understand that there is a whole history of other people trying to do a lot of the same stuff.   HF is awesome! And it's most certainly used for digital communication. Mostly this communication is in the form of relatively crude RTTY or a bit more complex PSK, but basically direct text-to-text or image-to-image, low bandwidth communication. Mostly the need for packet modems has been replaced by modern sound cards, plugged into the mic port of the radios. Of course there is a bandwidth limitation, but for HF that's not really a problem since the bands them self are limited.  The frequency areas dedicated for ham radio use are quite small, for instance 14.000 to 14.350 MHz and 7.000 to 7.200 MHz (know as respectively the 20m and 40m bands). And within those bands there are dedicated areas for voice, cw (morse) and digital communication.   HF has been and is to some extend still being used for email and similar simple digital communication via packets, useful for when living in a cabin out in the middle of nowhere. Winlink is one of the systems used.   Back in the day packet bbs´s were more common, while also on HF it was mostly on VHF they shined. Imagine putting up a local BBS in a tower or on top of a building and have people call in 150 km away with ease. Today APRS is alive and well (Automatic Position/Packet Reporting System) on VHF. It's a decentraliced system, consisting of repeaters, some are connected to the internet. When a user sends out a packet (typically consisting of the GPS location of the user) it has a header with information on how many times it should be repeated, and the repeaters then talk to each other and gives the low power user a wide coverage. All the users can see the other users and may send messages to each other - some stations are information stations with updates, bulletins or local weather information.   Anyway, I might have rambled on a bit. But my point is that the idea about having emergency or decentralized systems is far from new. And maybe the predisposed ideas some people have about how that system should work (that it should replace the internet) is a result of being ignorant of how it already can work. Maybe you need to concentrate the real needs you have - and that way you might find that existing solutions are easier or better suited, at least for some of the purposes (emergency solutions).  In any case ham radio is a great way to learn and to experiment with some of these tools and I encourage anyone to head over to /r/amateurradio - the community is very friendly and helpful to people interested in the hobby."

I am the VoCore developer, thank you for all your comments good or bad. :) I make this by myself but not a company, because I am a developer, I want to focus on tech but not business matters(maybe later I have to create one company for tax matter). I am a real man, not somebody behind a company. I just want to make something interesting and useful as my own toy at first beginning, and I public all my result to my blog, hoped to be helpful. Then things happens beyond my imagination, some people read my blog and that eager to have one... Unlucky, all my VoCore are soldered by myself so I can not provide many to them. So the indiegogo campaign comes. I never thought it will get so much concern, I just want to make about 300 pieces from factory so I will not have to cost that much time solder VoCore by myself. My VoCore is far from prefect, but I really think twice when I design it. Cost, size, performance, port, network speed... I want to make it prefectly but that is impossible. I have to try to get the best balance. If this fund on igg success, all hardware design will be public(v0.3 has already public, and it is stable and usable), anyone could easily learn from it whatever disadvantage or advantage.

I was kind of shooting in the dark, as the specs and price on the linked board leave a lot to be desired. My first question was what are your requirements, and now you have laid them out pretty well.   Regarding size, I'm not sure why a 1x1 board has appeal to people building mesh modes.  Would a 2x3 board, like RaspPi, really be prohibitive for a mesh node?  Regarding TCP/IP, do you understand that is a software stack that can run on almost any chip?   Regarding price, well lets wait and see. The guy running this project admits he's not going to get it to under $100 unless it goes into mass production. Which it wont, unless a rich VC sees something in this little college project which makes it marketable, which doesn't seem to exist. And even then it would take a couple years to really ramp up.  There's nothing remarkable about the size, price, or weight of this board. Any hobbyist could put together something similar.

darknetplan,267pct,Chairboy,6,Fri May 23 02:39:57 2014 UTC,"Review the campaign, $15 and $20 are available board targets.  1""2 is very desirable for mesh (and more) because it can be fit into tiny boxes that are hidden.  In question your experience with arduino if you think tcp/ip w Ethernet and or wifi is really feasible without expensive shields and they're just not powerful enough to be useful for mesh stuff.    Dude.  You hand waved away the $15-20 price with a $100 price, what's up?  Do you have inside info?"
darknetplan,267pct,hive_worker,2,Fri May 23 02:56:11 2014 UTC,20 pieces of PCB board cost is $250 (four layers PCB with impedance); SMT for one board cost is $100. VoCore will be useless due to that high price. Only mass production will lower its cost   BTW if you're going to hide your mesh node I'd be interested in how you're going to power it. If you plan on using a battery pack it's going to be a lot bigger than 1x1 if it's to last any period of time.
darknetplan,267pct,Chairboy,2,Fri May 23 03:04:01 2014 UTC,"Right, that's why he or she is doing the darn crowd funding!  :)  As for power, I like parasitic power or solar+battery, but solar really doesn't easily work with hidden.  Parasitic does, though!"

darknetplan,265cer,sailorbrendan,3,Thu May 22 00:25:04 2014 UTC,"I'm also in a similar situation, but I’m moving forward step by step. Here's how I’ve learned what I know so far, and my plan of attack for the future:   I learned a lot about computers while trying to unbrick my old laptop (all I got was a BIOS beep code), then removing the hard drive and pulling my data off of it. More knowledge came from researching what computer to buy next, and then opening a PC for the first time to install a 2nd SSD in it on it. I went from 0 hardware knowledge to passable by building my own 3D printer from scratch, and wound up making a bunch of edits to the Wiki in the process, thereby learning wiki markup. I learned a little about security systems and networking while rooting my phone, and I am in the process of unlocking the SIM, although there is currently no method for unlocking the bootloader. I discovered, researched, and installed TOR on my PC, and have been following and researching the Etherium and MaidSafe projects along with MeshNet. I intend on 3D printing all the parts for a quadrocopter, and learning more about electronics while assembling it. My next project will be installing Linux (I’ve already decided on Debian) alongside windows on my laptop. WiFi will not work out of the box, so I expect to have to learn a bit about wireless networks in order to get it up and running. After that I plan on turning an old PC (or a Raspberry Pi) into a personal server and set up my own website on it. Hopefully at this point I will have a broad enough background to be able to start a MeshNet in my city. This may involve working with the closest hackerspace/HAM radio club, or starting my own local hackerspace. I fully expect it to be just as large of a project, if not larger, than the 3D printer was. However, I am fed up enough with net neutrality issues and the Comcast/TWC monopoly in my area to do what it takes to free myself from them.   I highly recommend this method of learning. Never be afraid to take something apart and try to fix it, but expect to fail many times before you succeed. Most people are so used to having purchasable, can opener solutions to problems that they never learn to tinker through their issues. Ingenuity is a quality people develop, not something they are born with, so fixing your own car or building your own shed gives you far more than just the end product. Even rocket science can be broken down into simple bite sized chunks that are easy to learn, but some things contain a LOT more of these small chunks than others. Building a house is easy if you hammer one nail at a time, just plan ahead and learn everything you can."

No need to wring hands over how the competition will lay the cables, that's their job to figure it out.

If a new ISP forms in an existing ISP's territory, the existing ISP can just cut their rates until the new one goes bankrupt, then jack the prices back up. Plus, they can enter into exclusive agreements with backbone carriers, so a new ISP won't be able to plug the cable they lay into the internet anyway.  Monopoly laws used to protect us against this, but everything is being slowly deregulated.

For example, you could read and understand all the RFCs for all the protocols and be a super awesome hardware person, but if you don't know anything about Unix/Linux/BSD/whatever, then none of that actually helps you set up the software which is just as if not even more important for actually using the software.  On the topic of accessing I2P and Tor from the Hyperboria [1], it is possible, but requires some hackery because clients that exist on one network can not simply talk to servers on another network. And Tor and I2P exist only on the internet. Therefore, peers on either I2P or Tor can only connect to other peers on the same network.

But in any case, if you want to use a raspberry pi, for wireless meshing, you would need a minimum of 2 wireless NICs, which IIRC, would use up both available USB ports.  I don't think it is reasonable to expect an RPI to be able to use I2P because it uses Java (memory) and has a fairly high requirement for processing.  However, after reading your original question, an idea did come to mind as to how you could access I2P and Tor from the Hyperboria. You or someone else could run a I2P or Tor node that would allow you to connect from the Hyperboria. I haven't tried it, but the only problem I see off the top of my head is dealing with making the I2P or Tor software connect over the Internet rather than the Hyperboria (because IIRC, CJDNS tells the kernel to redirect all traffic to the tun device, which is not what you want). It is important to note that encryption shouldn't be needed because CJDNS does it at the IP layer. However, it would still be wise to set the password on the I2P router to prevent unauthorized access."

An addon for pfsense, ddwrt, openwrt, tomato, and other wrt style systems would allow for easy integration and adoption, and allow people to by cheap commodity hardware to build up a mesh.  I like the ideas I have seen here about allowing the tunneling of traffic to the web proper, but my worry is the same for why I no longer leave an open network around my house...I don't want DMCA (and possibly worse) type of stuff hitting me as the account holder.   Open wifi as a defense isn't universal and will likely be eroded due to the influence of money and power.

The beauty is because of how simple the code is and the fact that it's Linux based it probably would not be too hard to do this, just need to find a cheap hardware platform.

I suspect you'd need some kind of end-to-end encryption, which would have to be unwrapped at some point in the chain, and be able to be upgraded in the event the old encryption gets cracked. I'm also put in mind of Box A being able to generate any kind of packet stream which could trigger Box B into accepting a firmware upgrade from Box A.  Then there's rollback. What if the genuine firmware upgrade process is compromised, and an update rolls out across the mesh which does any of the following?:   puts a backdoor into the boxes bricks the boxes after a certain time alters where/how the boxes look for upgrades   On top of that, if the boxes can't change where or how they look for upgrades, is that fixed end-point able to be filtered at the ISP level or commandeered by a national government? Could a government demand root-level access to the boxes from the manufacturer, distributor, or an official contact for the upgrade process?"

The challenge will be for this to happen without the system becoming centralized and losing all of its benefits. I can't see this being feasible without devices supporting a vendor-neutral open standard, as a minimum. It will take a lot to motivate the vast majority of people who have only ever installed what their ISP have provided to them, to spend money on a new device that provides benefits they don't value or appreciate, using methods that they don't understand. Even having a model of commodity hardware and open-source software (a sensible suggestion, I think) would be incompatible with the zero-configuration approach that we're talking about.  If enough major vendors were to see a market gap for mesh-net compatible devices, it's highly unlikely that they'd be free of proprietary ""features"", like iMeshnet cloud synchronization of your unencrypted private keys (for the purposes of recovery for instance, if a router broke), or Facebook integration and support for Google Adwords and related location-aware services to make your life easier and providing you with relevant products of services, and I also think it very unlikely that we wouldn't have closed-source software and firmware, and undisclosed back-doors. And if consumer meshnet routers were to take off in any serious way, you can best that governments would lean of manufacturers to give them a listening capability in exchange for being spared increased regulation; they wouldn't allow a widespread form of communications that they couldn't monitor. So dissidents, journalists and other people in situations where meshnets are supposed to provide the greatest value would lose out on this entirely.  I think that having an approach where people buy a Black Box that they plug in and it just works is incompatible with having a secure system, because it involves delegating trust to people that we shouldn't, and most people would have to value their privacy and security a great deal more before they were willing to spend any money on such a device that did actually perform that function."

It sucks, I agree.

I'm not even worried about speed, I'm worried about the thing having enough peers to be a functional network.  In my opinion speed is a function of the 802.x protocol we end up using, ac looks promising, and yes I realize hops matter, but we'll deal with that later. What we need to focus on now is getting a solid user base over a large enough geographic area. At the end of the day, the only way this thing works is if there are enough users to create the chain needed for the network to exist, and the only way that will happen is a Walmart mesh router that is plug and play."

When it was released, it didn't have anything to offer over Facebook, so it didn't get adopted except by a small subset of users.  Before long, those users got bored with not having a large community to talk with and abandoned Google+.  The same would happen if a meshnet with significantly low performance was released for public use.  Early adopters would be ok with it, but need to continue being a part of the effort to better the technology.  So, I think you are right when it comes to a particular subset of users, but /u/complexisgood is right about the general population.

darknetplan,25r0ax,cuank,6,Fri May 16 23:12:21 2014 UTC,syncthing looks interesting. I'm going to try it out later tonight. How does it connect to sites outside your network. Do i need to do any port forwarding from my routers to desktops to get them to see each other outside my perimeter?
darknetplan,25r0ax,cuank,1 point,Sat May 17 01:28:05 2014 UTC,no idea. i only found it recently and i'm rebuilding my machine this weekend so i haven't got around to installing it yet

darknetplan,25r0ax,thefinn93,1 point,Sat May 17 14:58:18 2014 UTC,so i got around to testing out this syncthing. Actually i still have not been able to get two computers to sync but i see a few things about syncthing that probably would not work for this scenario.  1) synthing needs to restart every time a node is added. For MeshedSites  that would mean a restart for every new website you visit. 2) I didn't see a way to make a repository 'Read Only'. If the repo isn't read only then i a peer could modify your content. BitSync has features to facilitate syncing with untrusted peers.  I could be way off.. still trying to figure out why i'm getting errors trying to sync another destination. I might see it differently once i get it to work.
darknetplan,25r0ax,thefinn93,1 point,Sat May 17 15:07:02 2014 UTC,"There's a way to make it read only to others, and I assume they're going to add the ability to reload the config without restarting eventually, but really, what does this have over Freenet?"
darknetplan,25r0ax,thefinn93,1 point,Sun May 18 04:55:16 2014 UTC,I think they are both very similar in how they load sites. Freenet has more options like 'connect only with friends' but meshedsites is still in infancy.   The main advantages i can think of are that MeshedSites uses URLs that are human readable and easier to remember. You don't need to login first to the local server freenet spins up to access your pages.  Its easier for me to tell a friend.. hey got to xttp://my.new.site than some url with over 32 randomly generated characters in it.  You can interlink other meshedsite pages from regular internet pages. There is xttp://frameworks.meshedsites.com where common javascript like jQuery is saved. Any site can link to this jQuery instead of having to download it into their own packages. This may be some benefit in the future if it catches on.  IMHO meshedsites load alot faster since the browser plugin directly interacts with the downloaded web pages instead of going through something like freenet's local server.
darknetplan,25r0ax,thefinn93,1 point,Mon May 19 13:48:37 2014 UTC,How does it handle DNS then?

Few users demonstrate even near the technical know-how or insight to understand what's going on or what they are even trying to accomplish, and those who think they do fail to realize that the suggested solutions doesn't solve what they're trying to solve - and they ignore that there are current, far more reliable ways to achieve their goal (especially digital ham radio).

I would hazard that most of the subscribers are the same way. There just aren't any books or many tutorials that go in-depth regarding all the problems and headway being made. The closest thing is probably the blog posts by /r/nycmeshnet and even then, it isn't very informative.  and excuse me if this sounds really ignorant, but isn't ham radio for . . . . radio? like the audio communication?

darknetplan,25p4vz,pushme2,2,Mon May 19 05:50:28 2014 UTC,"Ham radio is for any type of radio experimentation and many different frequency areas are allocated for ham radio use all the way from very high frequency microwave frequencies, to low frequency long wave, which allows experimentation with both wide bandwith line of sight (or reflections on rain, meteors, planes, satellites or even the moon) as well as low bandwidth around the globe, reflected on different layers in the atmosphere.  Be it voice, cw (morse) or some of the many different digital modes. Some digital modes are much more effective even when the signal is extremely weak allowing for extremely long distances on low power (wspr, wsjt, psk). Some provide easy location or weather information transmitted in a decentralized node packet network (aprs). Some provide digital voice and data transmission and even actual network connectivity between computers, email connections and so on (dstar, dmr, winlink)  While the implementation might not be the solution on ham radio frequencies - it is a great platform for experimenting with different types of modes, transmitters, antennas on different kind of frequencies. Even if the final result is using citizen band ""free"" frequencies, commercially rented frequencies or pirate frequencies.   Even just basic tangible experience with concepts such as antenna design, swr, harmonics, interference, propagation and modulation are crucial for having a constructive discussion on anything related to wireless communication. It's not like its rocket science but having made your own antennas and experiences helps a lot - also when setting up wifi or phone solutions.

darknetplan,25p4vz,en3r0,7,Fri May 16 15:47:47 2014 UTC,"Indeed anyone posting or subscribing to this subreddit should be given a short 101 course on ham radio.  As I understand it there are several, different goals of these communities.   Providing a network, which works completely separately of ISP's, which democratizes the users from the big bad corporations. The easiest way is to make it decentralized since this will democratize supply costs as well.   The argument against using ham radio here is that ham radio must be unencrypted - and obviously the daily reddit use is far too valuable to be left decoded by anyone. But it is still obvious when reading these posts, that the poster would be much better prepared had he some basic knowledge of frequencies, antennas, propagation, etc. If ham radio is not the solution it can certainly get you some of the way.  or   Providing an emergency wifi or cellphone hookup for when the commercial systems break.    The argument against using ham radio here is that it's too cumbersome for the regular user to have messages relayed by a ham radio operator. In turn this makes the emergency nodes suggested in here look far too ambitious with a disregard for limitations of coverage and essentially ending up with solutions that are so expensive and specific that they turn out to be limitations rather than helpful solutions.   the third goal seems to be simply an encrypted, anonymous vpn - not sure why that would need much discussion but go ahead."

CJDNS is the underlying routing & addressing infrastructure, and you can run any IPv6 capable application atop it. Freenet works well atop CJDNS and multiple servers run both cjdns and Freenet on Hyperboria.  Tor has the beginnings of IPv6 support, but for your own safety do not use it in production, it will reveal your full IPv4 address and the IPv4 address of the person you connect to! I2P has yet to add IPv6 support, but both Tor & I2P can be run over an IPTunnel connection on CJDNS (its basically a VPN solution like OpenVPN for accesing other networks like the internet over cjdns).  What about Netsukuku?  Most of Project Meshnet's members have heard of it and CJDNS has similar principles & concepts, but Netsukuku is not heavily developed and has no encryption or security to protect your data in transit yet (it is planned though). Currently /u/MissValeska is the prime developer, PR & I'd say project manager for Netsukuku, and is (seemingly) the only active developer of it.

darknetplan,25dafv,swingafrique,3,Mon May 12 21:13:00 2014 UTC,"Sure.  About 12 years ago a private company put in 100mbs connections to every house in our city (25,000 residents). The city then decided to purchase the network from the private company and make it a public utility. Every resident could get 100/100 internet for $15 a month.  After 2-3 years the city got scared about the ongoing maintenance and costs, so they sold most of the network to another private company. They now charge $50 for 15/10 (even though it's capable of much faster, and will bump you up to 25/15 for $75/mo) -- their support is terrible, they don't fix problems, and there's a lot of downtime.  I recently learned that the city didn't sell off the fiber that connects to the city to the closest backbone (25 miles away), and they lease the bandwidth to help offset the deficit they created by buying and selling a network when they didn't know what they were doing.  I've dreamed of leasing bandwidth from the city and deploying the ISP that could exist based on existing architecture currently managed by a horrid company."

They act like their dovetail is completely different than a proxy, when in reality it's just a weaksauce, overpriced, very limited manner of proxy that won't ever exist."

They want to make sure you know that, despite having no network, and despite vague promises that it will somehow be useful someday, that you can still go buy safecoins from people who got in early.  Forget about everything else, go buy yourself some safecoins.  That's what they really want you to do.  FYI, decentralized networks like this already exist, and have existed for decades.  Furthermore, there is no need to arbitrarily associated such a network with a new cryptocurrency.  They just want a shinny new cryptocurrency, the maidsafe thing is secondary to that purpose."

darknetplan,24xabk,polysemous_entelechy,1 point,Sat May 10 01:11:00 2014 UTC,"I understand the skepticism, but I believe the fact that they have a cryptocurrency to monetize the network is a critical piece of how it operates.  This is how they incentivize infrastructure.  Without it the computers providing the storage and connections are doing it for free.  The independent coin representing ""participation"" on the network proves to be a very strong motivator as is seen with bitcoin's example.  It means that people get paid in a coin that is only as valuable as the network it's used on.    The value of the coin and the network create a growth loop.  The more people ""farm"" out their computers and hard drives in order to provide speed, security, and space on the network, then the more people will want to use it, then the more the coins will be worth, then the cheaper it is to run the network, then the more services and sites will move to it, and then the desirability of the coin rises, which brings more farmers to the network... and so on.  Look at what this has done for the Bitcoin transaction network.  It's the most powerful distributed network on the planet after just a few short years.  Imagine what that could do if the ""proof-of-work"" was actually a ""proof-of-storage.""  If the network functions as advertised, it could grow at an insane pace.     I totally get being weirded out by the ""coin"" side of it but honestly I think it's a big feature and largely the reason many of its alternatives haven't caught on.  If there is no economic incentive to create infrastructure then it just won't happen.  It will end up no different than the Tor network.  Where some people will voluntarily help, but it has no chance of ever reaching the speeds and scale of the popular internet services.  (However there is a project in development that will use Bitcoin to incentivize better Tor participation)  Now, there are a lot of scam coins out there.  But I've done a lot of reading about this project and I think that you should not dismiss it so easily.  I've heard a few interviews from these guys, I've done a lot of reading, I've studied (literally) hundreds of other crypto currencies, and I am an economics nerd.  This project has a LOT of promise.  Remember also that you don't have to buy Safecoin.  I'm not going to.  But I definitely am going to put 2TB of hard drive space onto the network in order to earn some when it goes live."

It's also possible to mix and match different zips that have different things in them; you might be able to add a new kernel on top of your stock ROM.

Kevin Ashton proposed the term Internet of things in 1999,  though people have discussed the concept since at least 1991.   The concept of the Internet of things first became popular through the Auto-ID Center at MIT and related market analysis publications.  Radio-frequency identification (RFID) was seen as a prerequisite for the Internet of things in the early days. If all objects and people in daily life were equipped with identifiers, they could be managed and inventoried by computers.   Besides using RFID, the tagging of things may be achieved through such technologies as near field communication, barcodes, QR codes and digital watermarking.    Equipping all objects in the world with minuscule identifying devices or machine-readable identifiers could transform daily life.   For instance, business may no longer run out of stock or generate waste products, as involved parties would know which products are required and consumed.  [need quotation to verify] A person's ability to interact with objects could be altered remotely based on immediate or present needs, in accordance with existing end-user agreements.  For example, such technology could enable much more powerful control of content creators and owners over their creations by better applying copyright restrictions and digital restrictions management, so a customer buying a Blu-ray disc containing a movie could choose to pay a high price and be able to watch the movie for a whole year, pay a moderate price and have the right to watch the movie for a week, or pay a low fee everytime she or he watches the movie.

darknetplan,243xhz,tacticaltaco,2,Sun Apr 27 17:22:53 2014 UTC,"I agree we need micro ISP hardware.  As a nerd I will need to know that it can be fully configurable so I can maximize the distance and number of people I can reach.  From an average Joe standpoint, it should cost about as much as a home router ($50 - $150), and be stupid easy to use.   I think it would be useful to develop a multi radio mesh node. Basically like a gateway that works on 26ghz, 2.4ghz, 5ghz, 900mhz, etc etc. Maybe it could be modular to add more radios when the government frees up spectrum? I'd like more antenna options and upgrade-ability.  For the average Joe, I'd like to see a box that you plugin and go. I think antenna setup should be limited to what's included in the box, but nothing more than something you stick on your roof like in the days of OTA TV."

Someone in a neighborhood sized area will bite the bullet and setup a small mast/tower that connects to other backhaul mesh nodes. People under the coverage of that tower will get access to the mesh through it.  I think it would be smart to try and use specific bands for specific uses. Keep 2.4GHz for regular device access, use 5.8 (and maybe 900) for backhaul between nodes."

darknetplan,23z2wl,Joeskyyy,5,Fri Apr 25 19:08:22 2014 UTC,This is anecdotal but for me I've had decent luck working with Routerboards with 900MHz MiniPCI cards inside of waterproof enclosures. Decent range and cheap if you buy used on eBay.  Best advice is get some altitude with whatever you put up. Put it in a tree or on the roof or get a mast. That will have the greatest effect on range.
darknetplan,23z2wl,tacticaltaco,3,Fri Apr 25 22:13:06 2014 UTC,Any links in particular to one of them you've used? I appreciate it man!
darknetplan,23z2wl,tacticaltaco,4,Fri Apr 25 22:30:19 2014 UTC,"Here are a few shitload of links/info:   RB411. It's basically a small router with one ethernet (PoE capable) and a MiniPCI slot. I've bought these on eBay for $20. Brand new they're around $40. CAOTS. A waterproof case for the RB411 (and many other boards). If you're doing stuff indoors there are cheaper metal cases (~$20 eBay) available. It comes with a waterproof ethernet jack and plugs for the holes. You will have to find your own antenna connectors (usually MMCX to N).   I've bought some of those things new before from Streakwave since they have a warehouse in my city and I can get stuff same-day if I pick it up.   Ubiquiti XR9. It's a 900MHz MiniPCI card. They are basically a 2.4GHz 802.11G chipset with a transverter and some filtering so they run at 900MHz. I've had alright luck with these. I've bought them used on eBay for pretty damn cheap (~$45/card?). These are pretty popular with WISPs so availability should be good. Xagyl XC900M. Another 900MHz MiniPCI card. The Xagyl brand isn't as popular as Ubiquiti but their product is superior. I don't have any of these cards but I do have the slightly older FLR9G30 and I think it works better than the XR9 cards. I think the XR9 will work with the FLR9G30. Xagyl XC420M. If you're a ham these should be of interest. They work in the 70cm band in the ATV part of the band. Legality is questionable because of symbol rates but these are the best cards I've played with. I've done a 1.2 mile mediocre-line-of-sight with omni antennas (with one being in a window behind a mesh screen) with these before. Only downer is they were ~$180/card.   I've got a handful of routerboards, cases and cards (but not enough antennas). I've not spent much time actually trying to mesh them (802.11s? adhoc with batman/OLSR?). I need to make more friends in my city to try and setup a mesh. Cincinnati is too damn hilly.  I've used a bunch of antennas for 900MHz. Big grid antennas, little magnetic omnis, panel antennas with varying amounts of success. The grids are hard to aim, the other stuff doesn't always have enough gain. Sometimes the noise in the 900MHz band is just too much. In the 70cm band I've mostly used a big pair of Diamond antennas that kick ass. I've been meaning to pick up their 900MHz equivalent (Diamond antennas rock my socks).    MFJ 1908-HD. It's a big telescoping fiberglass mast. I got mind from R&L since it was cheap and I could pick it up at their store (didn't have to pay for freight shipping). I use one of these for messing around. Toss a radio and an antenna on there and see how far you get. If you have a second story house I'd slap stuff up on the roof. Otherwise find a tall tree. Altitude (and LOS) with radio links is a deal breaker.   Another area I've been meaning to explore is 5.8GHz equipment, in particular the NanoBridge M5. If you have absolutely perfect LOS (can see your target, no obstructions) these things should kick ass (from what I've read). I just haven't had the time or a place with good LOS to play with these so I haven't bought/tried any yet.  If you end up picking up any gear and need help feel free to pm me. Also I'd recommend getting at least your Tech level Amateur Radio License (or your country's equivalent). It's not needed (except for that 70cm stuff) but you'll learn a lot in the hobby."
darknetplan,23z2wl,neilalexanderr,3,Sat Apr 26 03:00:29 2014 UTC,"In my experience, OpenWrt is a pretty great platform, and the community has got it working on a sizable number of ""normal"" home wireless routers if you are adventurous enough to tinker with it. From there you can maybe do some fairly simple hardware or antenna modifications to increase the wireless output and gain, and the platform is definitely suitable for a variety of routing/switching configurations. It just depends on the money that you want to spend on the hardware, or the time you want to invest in it.  Routerboards also look fairly interesting, and you are far more likely to get the kind of radio strength right out of the box that you want, but I don't know anything about what the software environment is like on them and they're probably a bit more expensive.  Do let us know what you come up with, I'll be interested to hear it. :-)"

Dislike the speculators all you want, but they also do a massive amount of PR work in the form of sharing information about BitCoin that helps spread its adoption. You can call that attraction of more speculators, or you can call it free publicity that benefits everyone. I'm clearly more in the realm of the latter.  I also fail to see what or how a currency could ""care"", or be built to care, about the cause of the Dark Net Plan.

Instead they just want to get rich and dump the coin.  If that shall happen, waste of time and effort spent during development will occur.  I trust the developers to release these coins gradually to attain value so that we can actually provide coins that will provide enough subsidiaries  that will remove the financial barrier towards deploring a mesh.  You can do external audits to verify the code, or read the whitepaper itself. I believe this is the best way of doing things.  An alt coin is absolutely necessary.

The coin is not launching until its done.  All the coins are created before the first block, so we cant help the premine. Its a post proof-of-work coin. It doesnt need mining.  Also, if the coin market cap goes to 60 billion, there is no way the founding developers can possibly ever spend that. Most of it will go to open source software or colonizing mars or something. If the price goes high enough, its monopoly money that wont be spent before they die.  We have experience with different coins and the worse thing you can have, is a coin that is not scarce. If you dont maintain scarcity, no one makes money. So giving away the coins too fast or for too little is always a mistake, because it hurts the people who already have coins.  If you make people buy a $200 or $300 mesh node and they get $200 in Skycoin, then its proof of burn and its fair. If you give people $200 in coins, it wont be worth $200 anymore. The price crashes. People are upset that other people received coins for free and they paid for them and the people receiving the coins for nothing just sell them off.  That 100% of the coins start off in one address is unfortunate, but its just the mathematics. If we do a good job distributing the coins by hand, then it will do better than if we tried to figure out some way to do distribution in the source code that is inferior. If we are greedy or poorly distribute or have a bad economic policy, then it will hurt the coin. That is what it comes down to."

The Bitcoin proof of work served a purpose. It's purpose was to prevent the coin from being a ponzi. That and the way Satoshi acted.

If the developers sell the coin, they are evil because they are receiving Bitcoin.  You cant win. Mining is not fair either.

Without both, this is pretty much useless for meshing. :|  Throw in any sort of mesh concept operating on the same frequencies, and you can also just hang up your coat on the idea of getting that range at all, or anywhere near that actual throughput from end to end, so that makes it even worse. Using short hops, this could probably make a great mesh sensor network for your rain gauge and such.  They do specify in the press page that they plan to use the 900MHz ISM band though."

darknetplan,23q8hl,tacticaltaco,5,Wed Apr 23 02:16:43 2014 UTC,"The problem with 802.11af is the FCC spectrum mask requirements. The FCC approved operating unlicensed transmitters on television whitespace between 60 MHz and 900 Mhz in 2010. However, to prevent anyone from using it, they put in place extremely restrictive spectrum mask requirements.  Since we are using open source hardware and software defined radio we can the use spectrum. For a mass produced device however, the spectrum mask requirements make it prohibitive to get through FCC certification.  He just ordered the HackRF. The antenna is fussy because of the large frequency range required. He was talking about using a ""fractal antenna"" so that we could operate on a larger range of frequencies."

We dont care about differences between GNU 2 and GNU 3 and MIT. It just does not matter at all for this project.  The only licensing concern we have is that hardware manufacturers doing ASICs from the FPGA implementation want a dual licensing agreement.

So we will probably do what large dual licensed open source projects such as MySql have done and have the standard GNU license with attribution clause.

Open transactions does not have to be complicated.   Even without receipts. Imagine you withdraw your balance every full coin. They steal 50 cents of coins from you. Its not like having your whole wallet stolen. A fraction of a coin being stolen is just annoying. If your neighbor's wifi node steals half a coin from you, you can go over there with a stick.

darknetplan,23cez4,GeneralTusk,2,Fri Apr 18 20:33:10 2014 UTC,For all intents and purposes cjdns is just IPv6. So any application that works with IPv6 will also work with cjdns.   There is also an API for communicating with cjdns.   https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/admin/README.md
darknetplan,23cez4,apotheon,4,Fri Apr 18 20:37:52 2014 UTC,"Well, no, that's not my point. I'm talking about communicating with a blackbox device. I can't imagine every single device that is cjdns capable would have to run this specific implementation of cjdns, which is pretty stupid."
darknetplan,23cez4,intensely_human,3,Sat Apr 19 01:39:36 2014 UTC,Agreed.  More implementations would be a Very Good Thing.
darknetplan,23cez4,apotheon,2,Wed Apr 23 21:50:16 2014 UTC,"And that depends on the publication of a protocol, which describes the communications coming across a barrier essentially at the edge of a device.    I'd love to see such a protocol and set out to implement it in ruby, just for fun."

darknetplan,23cez4,donttouchmyfries,3,Sat Apr 26 10:13:24 2014 UTC,"it is highly unlikely that an RFC-quality protocol specification will come out of this implementation.  that said, the community and project would be well served by the creation of a second implementation, preferably something in a higher level language where changes in routing logic could be more rapidly prototyped and iterated.  you'd have to reverse engineer cjdns to get there, but you'd only really have to do that once."
darknetplan,23cez4,apotheon,2,Wed Apr 23 12:10:36 2014 UTC,"What I'm worried about is that once I did, cjdns would change too quickly for me to keep up. Without a standardized protocol, we can't assume that it won't."

darknetplan,234c96,thouliha,17,Tue Apr 15 19:57:17 2014 UTC,"The first part of your problem is technical - it's ""trivial"" to do this on Linux. Not so easy to support other platforms.  The second part is philosophical - it's a conscious choice to let people choose who they will peer with. On one hand this is pragmatic: Most people would be afraid to take the risk of letting ""anyone"" peer for fear of being implicated in distribution of illegal material. On the other hand, there appears to be some degree of judgement there, and wanting to be able to exclude ""bad people"".  On the second point, while I can understand that people are concerned about risks, to me a mesh-net kind of misses the point to me if peers can cut you off, or even knows anything about you, as it means they can be leaned on. To me, the entire point of a darknet would be to help provide a channel that can't be effectively censored. If your peers may cut you off if they don't agree with the political views they see on sites you host, for example, then most people with something controversial to say will be better off just renting a VPS in a suitable jurisdiction and VPN to it.  I agree with you that it shouldn't be so difficult, but for it not to be difficult, people need to accept traffic to/from random strangers with no ability to limit it. And getting people to do that is a lot harder than getting people to be ok with approving peers and having the explicit ability to remove people.  But consider that people have wildly different reasons for wanting a mesh net, from wanting to not depend on commercial ISPs, to wanting to evade censorship, to just a general belief in decentralisation, and probably lots of other reasons, and many of those reasons will drive conflicting design trade-offs.  On high barriers to entry, though, see the current projects primarily as research/experimental efforts."
darknetplan,234c96,rubygeek,1 point,Tue Apr 15 23:16:40 2014 UTC,"We'd need someone well versed in cjdns security to chime in on the security concerns. To me though, I prefer ease of connectivity, and massive connectivity, over verifying and adding each individual peer to a connect list.   Other decentralized systems don't force you to do this(bittorrent/bitcoin) and neither should cjdns. It even says in the cjdns github readme that connectivity is done through a distributed hash table, but then you scroll down to the installation, and it requires you to add peers individually.   I agree, the current projects are primarily research/experimental efforts at this point, without any guis or install scripts. But right now, they're making it pretty hard for us to join in."
darknetplan,234c96,rubygeek,8,Tue Apr 15 23:57:43 2014 UTC,"The ""security concerns"" are not technical, but legal or moral. People hesitate to accept entirely anonymous connection out of concern for their connection being used to tunnel illegal material, or material they find offensive. This doesn't affect Bitcoin or Bittorrent so much because in the case of Bitcoin, no illegal data is passing your system, and in the case of Bittorrent, you're only passing on data you have donwloaded yourself, or decided to share yourself. A more fitting comparison would be Tor, and running Tor nodes is still a ""fringe"" activity."
darknetplan,234c96,tiffany352,3,Wed Apr 16 01:19:49 2014 UTC,"People can snoop on your connections to other peers, because the destination address can't be obscured or you wouldn't be able to route it.  You can't view the contents of the packets, because they are encrypted with asymmetric crypto.  In bittorrent, it doesn't matter when you share peers willy nilly, because you're all sharing the same data.  In bitcoin, everything is public to begin with, so it also doesn't matter.  However, cjdns is carrying your personal data, and is therefore more sensitive."

Incentive structures can seem illogical, but for some reason, people do like to share stuff, even if it means no benefit to them(bittorrent seeders, etc). If CJDNS states that one of its goals is a p2p distributed hash table, at the top of their readme, why do they completely disregard that in implementation?"

It uses source routing instead of BATMAN, so you dont know destination of packet, but only next hop. The packets are encrypted, so you cannot read the contents of packets in transit. Routing is pushed back to the client and the client has a choice of routing algorithms. The network uses its own address space and is multihome.

darknetplan,234c96,SumOfChemicals,12,Mon Apr 21 19:47:53 2014 UTC,"CJDNS is experimental software, with emphasis on a ""web of trust"", which is why you do not have P2P bittorrent style auto-peering. The idea is that you KNOW the person you are peering with, and you aren't blindly trusting a list of peers from the internet.  This is also why the ""public peers"" were removed from the network. While this raises the barrier to entry, it was done on purpose with the effect of making the entire network more trustworthy.  It is a highly underdeveloped field, with a high level of technical detail required which is why the process isn't quite as refined as we would have liked. The barrier to entry is simply in the implementation - we just haven't got there yet!"
darknetplan,234c96,wmcscrooge,-2,Wed Apr 16 00:39:37 2014 UTC,"Understood, I'm griping about things, like ease of use, or a GUI, that may come in time. I think these would greatly speed up adoption, because cjdns has been out for years and hasn't picked up near as much steam as other web decentralized projects.   I also think the p2p-style auto-peering is something that should be part of it. If I didn't work full time I would probably work on a fork for this feature. To me, just as in other decentralized web projects, the web of trust builds with time, contribution, and participation. Right now, I can't participate in building a network at all. I'd rather the peering be hands off, and just connect me to any and all peers available.  I wanted to see if there were any meshnets near me, but the official map is down:  http://map.projectmeshnet.org/  I went to the IRC, and no one responded to my questions for hours. It felt pretty abandoned."

darknetplan,234c96,tiffany352,22,Wed Apr 16 14:33:51 2014 UTC,"You need a linux machine to install it on. cjdns can work on openwrt routers, or if you have so much as a single linux machine connected to your network, you can use it as a gateway as well.  Windows support is probably more difficult to do than you put it out to be, with its horrible API. It could probably be done with a driver. You could probably install it to your router without installing cjdns - but this is unexplored territory, highly firmware dependant, and assumes that your router isn't extremely locked down to begin with. Complaining that cjdns doesn't work on your router without openwrt is like complaining that you can't run android apps on a dumbphone.  As for the reason cjdns is more difficult to configure, it is because it's of a different nature than bittorrent/bitcoin/git. There is no script you can find that will automatically sign you up for an Internet Service Provider, why should there be one that automatically signs you up for a peer list? Picking one particular node because a script said so increases centralisation of the network, which is bad for stability. If that one node that the script references goes down, then you could lose a large number of users in the process."

The atmosphere should be very collaborative and non-exclusive, but I'm running into walls pretty consistently.

The project is such a collaborative effort with many remote people without a central center that it is hard to keep a centralized webpage with information. A better solution than looking for the map (I've found) is just to ask on this subreddit if anyone is near your location (or on the respective subreddit if you live somewhere big like Austin or Seattle or New York). It's like trying to work on an open-source project except worse because not everyone is a coder but still wants to help out.  The IRC problem is just a new culture type of thing. I don't know how much you hang out on IRC, but in a lot of channels unless the channel is huge like #python or #reddit, then it's really hard to get a lot of responses. I've found the best way is just to ask a question and wait a day or two. And then ask again. or ask on reddit. There's been a lot of times where I've been working on a project and look in on a channel to see that someone asked a question, waited a couple of hours, and then left right before I checked.

One of them said it won't build on openwrt currently.   I don't want to pay for internet from a provider.    No, you read that wrong. By non-hierarchical, it means that addresses aren't assigned by range.  In the current internet infrastructure, you have huge ranges that are assigned regionally, and each region assigns thousands to millions of addresses to each ISP, and each ISP assigns you an address.  Under cjdns, each IP address is a hash of a public key, there is no ""region"" that you're in (a side effect of this is completely breaking geoip).  Mesh networking is unrelated, and is certainly something cjdns can do, but so can IPv4 and IPv6. Cjdns is an internet-layer protocol, which many people don't seem to get.

Mesh networks have potential for monetization just like ISPs do. Cjdns, however, is not limited in scope to mesh networks, nor does it contain any particular ties to mesh networking. It is a lower level protocol than you are giving it credit. You can built mesh networking using cjdns and with IPv6 the same exact way.   If you wish to get free internet, you'd better head somewhere else, because you can't get a connection from nowhere. You will, inevitably, have to spend money to buy hardware or connections for a mesh network. They require maintenance just like any other kind of network, they require nodes, they require uplinks to the rest of the internet.  Even if you were to make a global-scope mesh network, money would have to be paid on things like long-distance links between rural areas, and undersea cables, and large-scale routing hardware to serve as a backbone.

The antennas pushme2 is talking about have pretty high off-axis rejection - and the Ubiquiti hardware he's alluding to is pretty durable stuff. The main problem, then, becomes latency rather than throughput. 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz would both work - although you would need more fading margin at 5Ghz, the antennas are smaller for the same gain.... a slightly larger antenna would fix the small propagation difference pretty easily.   This kind of installation is much easier and cheaper than laying fiber. We're talking, realistically, a few fairly short towers. This is a considerably less complex network than you envision, and larger networks have already been built by amateur radio operators. In addition, the materials we would require are stocking items at many distributors, instead of an untried kickstarter.   I'd need to lay out a realistic path and do the path loss over terrain numbers, but over the distance you're listing it might be feasible as a single point to point link. If not, I seriously doubt you'd need more than 1 or 2 repeaters. When you factor in siting considerations, this network would be much cheaper, much faster, and far more reliable. In addition, it would have enormously lower latency - making it a far more usable link."

That's about 8 text messages per second each way not including any protocol/routing overhead.  You're going to need more throughput or fewer hops (or both).
darknetplan,235mhk,Dmelvin,1 point,Wed Apr 16 16:58:29 2014 UTC,"This is dependant on your equipment.  If you're using a 1x1 chain (single channel, single polarity) you're correct.    A lot of ubiquiti's equipment is 2x2, dual channel, dual polarity, meaning that it has 2 transmits and 2 receives on each radio.  This eliminates that pesky losing half of your bandwidth.  Not only that, but in the situation that they're talking about, You would have tower A, which has a link to tower B.   on the opposite sides of these towers, you have another radio that is a PtMP connection to the peers.   The PtP network between the two towers is just a transport link between the two PtMP connections."

darknetplan,230lew,jercos,5,Mon Apr 14 16:47:05 2014 UTC,"In either a case of a problem with implementation of a cryptographic primitive, or of a flaw in the algorithms used, the lynchpin here is not cjdns itself, but NaCl. A major bug in NaCl would hit a number of projects using it, and all of them would effectively be waiting on djb to provide a fix. If it was in fact a problem with the algorithms being used, and not the implementation of those algorithms, the result would be a complete renumbering, as while the new scheme might accept the same private keys, re-using them would be unwise, and also the resulting public keys would be different, meaning each and every node's address and public key would change. If the issue was with the hash used rather than with the public key crypto, that could potentially mean node addresses change, but public keys do not. If the issue was with the symmetric crypto, then older nodes would not be able to communicate with newer nodes, but public keys and addresses would remain the same, and peering details would thus not need to be re-done. In any of these cases, the work would effectively be out of the hands of cjdns developers, and entirely on djb. A new release of NaCl could be added to the cjdns build script and cjdns would simply compile with the fixed cryptographic primitive.  On the other hand if the bug was not in a cryptographic primative, but was part of the cjdns protocol implemention or design (much as the recent heartbleed bug was not a cryptographic primitive issue), then the speed of the patch and the nature of the patch would be unpredictable without knowledge of the specific type and nature of the bug, and it could be resolved anywhere from minutes after discovery, to months of intensive re-design efforts.  TL;DR: cryptographic primitives aren't a part of cjdns."

Let me punctuate that: every gpg key in the RS system created before (whatever date rs is patched successfully against heartbleed) absolutely must be considered completely compromised. As in,  Eve has both key and passphrase for not just Bob's key, but Alice's key too!  RS as a system might be fixable, but its network as of today is fully compromised. Every key, passphrase, web of trust in the system is fully fucked. Every key and/or password you used on a system which ran RS (or any SSL, but RS particularly) is fucked, too.   Imagine the worst case cryptographic scenario. Guess what? Heartbleed is worse than what you are imagining. If you use RS, you need to start revoking keys. And changing passwords.  I'm personally going to assume all gpg keys generated before now to be compromised, and all keysigs by keys older than now to be invalid.

We do not have that ability, obviously. If someone in a position to use jamming wanted to disable a node... they would simply march in and disable the node. No jamming necessary.

darknetplan,22qalr,autowikibot,1 point,Fri Apr 11 08:28:16 2014 UTC,"IP over Avian Carriers:       In computer networking, IP over Avian Carriers (IPoAC) is a humorously-intended proposal to carry Internet Protocol (IP) traffic by birds such as homing pigeons. IP over Avian Carriers was initially described in RFC 1149, a Request for Comments (RFC) issued by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) written by D. Waitzman and released on April 1, 1990. It is one of several April Fools' Day RFCs.  Waitzman described an improvement of his protocol in RFC 2549, IP over Avian Carriers with Quality of Service (1 April 1999). Later, in RFC 6214 released on 1 April 2011, and 13 years after the introduction of IPv6, Carpenter and Hinden published Adaptation of RFC 1149 for IPv6.   IPoAC has been successfully implemented, but for only nine packets of data, with a packet loss ratio of 55% (due to user error),  and a response time ranging from 3000 seconds (~54 minutes) to over 6000 seconds (~1.77 hours). Thus, this technology suffers from poor latency. Nevertheless, for large transfers, avian carriers are capable of high average throughput when carrying flash memory devices, effectively implementing a sneakernet. During the last 20 years, the information density of storage media and thus the bandwidth of an Avian Carrier has increased 3 times faster than the bandwidth of the Internet.  IPoAC may achieve bandwidth peaks of orders of magnitude more than the Internet when used with multiple Avian Carriers in rural areas. For example: If 16 homing pigeons are given eight 32 GB SD cards each, and take an hour to reach their destination, the throughput of the transfer would be 9102 Mbit/s, excluding transfer to and from the SD cards.

darknetplan,22lfpm,tomillo1235,5,Wed Apr 9 09:34:23 2014 UTC,cjdns does not force having an address numerically close to a physically nearby router.  When a router needs to send a message to a node for which it does not have a route it will send it to a node that is close by in address space. If that node doesn't have a route to the node it will forward it and so on and so forth. It can be shown mathematically that this rule of thumb for forwarding will eventually deliver the message. It is not necessary to have physical neighbors be also nearby in address space since the forwarding mechanism guarantees that a message is delivered not not that it took the best path to get there. It is fortunate that this forwarding mechanism is only used if a path to the node is not known. cjdns uses scalable source routing. Basically cjdns builds up a graph of the network to find the optimal routes. Not only that cjdns can also repair routes if a link goes down. All of this is possible because of the cjdns switch and reversible route labels which we are calling Reversible Stateless Label Switching (RSLS).

In essence, you have a higher chance of knowing about a node in the network whose address is the same as yours except for the last few bits than knowing about a totally different address with very few common bits. If you continue to pass the packet towards the most similar address to the destination then you will theoretically come across a host very quickly that knows about your destination directly (since with each step, the chances of that step knowing your destination are higher).  This does mean that packets may take a geographically indirect route to the destination (from the point of view of the carrier network, i.e. the Internet), but reduces the number of hops within the cjdns network itself."

Most of the time, session keys are established using two components which are never shared so as to create a shared secret that is never itself sent across the network  If you're curious, you should look into Diffie-Hellman, which is not vulnerable to eavesdroppers. It is, however, vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks, which means that in order for secure communications to be effective, the clients also need to sign messages in such a way that they can verify the identity of the client they are communicating securely with.  cjdns already addresses all of these concerns, and is already in use establishing a secure mesh network."
darknetplan,21mszm,kodemage,3,Sat Mar 29 21:38:03 2014 UTC,"Diffie–Hellman key exchange:       Diffie–Hellman key exchange (D–H)  is a specific method of exchanging cryptographic keys. It is one of the earliest practical examples of key exchange implemented within the field of cryptography. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange method allows two parties that have no prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure communications channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher.  The scheme was first published by Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman in 1976, although it had been separately invented a few years earlier within GCHQ, the British signals intelligence agency, by James H. Ellis, Clifford Cocks and Malcolm J. Williamson but was kept classified. In 2002, Hellman suggested the algorithm be called Diffie–Hellman–Merkle key exchange in recognition of Ralph Merkle's contribution to the invention of public-key cryptography (Hellman, 2002).  Although Diffie–Hellman key agreement itself is an anonymous (non-authenticated) key-agreement protocol, it provides the basis for a variety of authenticated protocols, and is used to provide perfect forward secrecy in Transport Layer Security's ephemeral modes (referred to as EDH or DHE depending on the cipher suite).

Many large ISPs connect to each other for free, nearly free, or at very low cost because it usually mutually benefits them and their customers to freely exchange traffic.  The current mentality for nodes is that they will each personally take a small hit for the team, which I think is perfectly sustainable, as initial costs are a few hundred dollars at most, with the running costs being a few cents to a few dollars at most per month (this would be for physical connections, not internet connections)."

The main goal here is to jumpstart getting people onto the mesh, as without enough nodes providing bandwidth to the internet meshes are a pretty poor substitute for connecting directly to an isp.

Adding lots of people to a few public internet nodes is ultimately something that we decided to break off, as it was causing massive centralization in the network and reducing reliability for peers of said nodes while adding little value. If you contact anyone on the network today (myself included) and say ""I want to join Hyperboria to test X/explore & extend the network/build a decentralized service/play with this janky bit of code i wrote that does Y."" then you'll normally get a set of peering details as a reply."

Guaranteed transport privacy (SSL everywhere, or quantum encryption, or whatever the future brings us at this level) also built into the protocols. Guaranteed message integrity checking. Not necessarily required, but there should be an option to digitally sign all of your packets to guarantee that things like (a) source, and (b) destination, and (c) payload are not modified in-flight.

Guaranteed robustness (DDoS attacks are way too prevalent, the protocols of the future should have a certain amount of ""push back"" so that a service that's being overwhelmed may broadcast to its nearest neighbors a kind of distress signal, which might redirect the traffic to a less busy server, limit the rate, or simply cut the traffic off). The protocols should guarantee that such a message can only originate from the overwhelmed server itself, and not an intermediate source like an ISP or a government. Also in the same vein of robustness, more robust connections. If your connection dies for a few minutes, or if your local address changes, or if the remote address changes, or if anything in-between has a hiccup, that should NOT impact the stability of the connection. Connections shouldn't be defined as ""source:port"" -> ""destination:port"", but rather have some unique session ID. Non-centralized DNS.

This will enable - among many other things - an anonymous digital marketplace for goods, services and reputation capital exchange (the ultimate meritocracy in which reputations quickly become more valuable than government-issues tokens of abstract worth, e.g. money).

A right is something that you are granted by being alive.  Your life, the choice of what to do with your time, the fruits of your labor, your body.  These things you have naturally and can only be taken, not given.  The internet takes work, it takes physical infrastructure that will deteriorate if not kept fresh and had regular maintenance.  It takes knowledge and initiative.  It takes the application and testing of new ideas to make it better and faster.  This cannot be a right.  If somehow a person is entitled to having an internet connection, then we would all necessarily have to be slaves.  Because someone else would have to be forced to build it, maintain it, repair it, and give access to it.  Meaning, while this one person has the ""right"" to the internet by doing nothing, others have lost their right to act freely, to work on other projects, to do with their body and labor what they choose rather than what is dictated to them.    I think you misunderstand the definition of a right.  Which is understandable with the perverted and manipulative political discourse that permeates society.   If you mean you wish to live in a world where everyone has to do very little to gain access to the internet and the knowledge of providing it is widespread and freely available, then I could not agree more.  But if you wish to live in a society where people are forced to build the internet so that others don't have to do or know anything, then I will be running from that society with every ounce of my being.  For one, the internet will be a patchy, inefficient, and spy ridden mess of controlled ideas. And second, everyone will be a slave.  TL;DR do not use the word ""right"" so cheaply."
darknetplan,1zv8yh,nuclearqtip,2,Mon Mar 10 14:25:31 2014 UTC,"Rights are always granted by ruling bodies. They are a recognition of a certain amount of ""bare minimum"" standards guaranteed to the ruled by the ruling class. A certain line that won't be crossed. It has nothing to do with ""being alive"" (because then the question comes down to ""who enforces that"").  I don't mean ""right to expect the internet to exist"", I mean ""right to access the internet presuming it exists"". If you want a close analog, take a look at the second amendment of the United States (the right to bear arms). Does it guarantee that firearms will be manufactured / maintained / distributed to all citizens? NO. Are people slaves because other people have a right to firearms? NO.  It does say the government won't try to stand in the way of you owning a firearm. Likewise the government should have no business in saying who may or may not access the internet, nor should it have any say in which parts you're allowed to see.   if you wish to live in a society where people are forced to build the internet   I don't even know why I'm arguing at this point, I really don't care, but that's kinda stupid. Look at public roads. Are they a right? No. Are they expected and maintained at this point? Yes. Did slaves build them? No. Do slaves maintain them? No. The government takes tax money from the citizens, hires paid laborers to do the work, and maintains this public infrastructure for the collective good.  The ""spy-ridden mess"" remark can largely be ignored if the protocols are implemented correctly (the ones in my original comment). The whole point of encryption is that you're comfortable sending your most precious data through the most hostile midpoints. I'm counting on that data being intercepted. I'm expecting instability and patchy connections. That's why a future internet needs to be more resilient and adaptive -- so that it doesn't take a billion-dollar infrastructure from a corporate monopoly to get packets from my house to yours in a timely and reliable fashion."

The problem that Bitcoin solved - the problem which needed to be solved to create a fully decentralised cryptocurrency, is how to maintain a fully decentralised ledger of ownership which does not require anyone putting their trust in any other single entity. See the Byzantine Generals problem.  Bitcoin solved this problem by inventing the blockchain ledger, which tracks ownership of ""stuff"", uses finding hashes as a proof-of-work to prevent the system being subverted, and creates an incentive in the form of rewards for those who find them, to get different groups of people to carry out the hash-search to prevent the 51% problem, and to give those doing the hashing an incentive to keep the system going. (If you cause people to lose trust in the system, you negate the rewards you received for doing the hashing.)  Bitcoin, with the bitcoin blockchain, keeps track of who owns bitcoins in a distributed fashion. But that's not all it can be used for. Namecoin, using the bitcoin protocol, but with its own blockchain ledger, keeps track of who owns namecoins, and namecoin domains, in a similarly distributed fashion.  There are many other possible uses for the bitcoin protocol, which will not involve the bitcoin currency. Keep a look out for a bunch of these over the next few years!

Network consensus is an okay measure, but you run into the issue of people creating fake nodes. Keeping the network closed to untrusted peers is also difficult, and not really a proper solution. It becomes especially difficult when you consider issues more unique to meshnets ie. networks merging together.  So you need some way to resolve conflicts between nodes who have conflicting entries. Do you want the oldest name to win? How do you know which is older? Should the person with more computing power win? The name registered on the greatest number of nodes?

Mike Hearn of Google and the Bitcoin Core development team had the idea of using zero-knowledge proof of the ownership of a Government-signed passport (proof of passport), but I don't think that idea is good, applicable, or popular.

darknetplan,1zifnb,crest_,1 point,Wed Mar 19 21:25:35 2014 UTC,"Well, there are two possibilities.  You only need a few links to the internet to keep the blockchain synced.  Or, you can just run a separate distributed DNS system on your meshnet.  The only problem then is what happens when two meshnets merge.  I'm not sure how you would handle that.  Perhaps you could have a TLD for all meshnets, then a second name per mesh.  Then, social.ny.bit. wouldn't conflict with social.vc.bit, if they merged.  I wonder if there's a way to make a blockchain system that could be safely merged into 1 blockchain?  Ideas?"

Also, there is the case of Hunter Moore's ""revenge porn"" site which involved the distribution of personal details (addresses, phone numbers, etc) of innocent women who had explicit photos shared without their consent.

Sex education and a culture of respect to human rights where there's no impunity or tolerance for sexual offenders will decrease the issue and make it more likely for victims to seek help.

If the democracy is not representative but direct, then we don't have the issues that we have in the real world with political parties pushing an agenda and corporations pushing another. We have more or less a social experiment where the majority rules and the minority are censored. Sure, it can turn out bad for you if you're in the minority, but as the rules evolve, the system could have notorious advantages over a convential democracy. The current rules of the clearnet are determined byan interacting system of powerful entities in the real world, many of whom are directed by people who are supposed to represent the interest of the population within their sovereign state. In practice, the people have no real control over the decisions that are made, it's just the legislations of the world interacting with each other. Sure, attempting to create an anarchich network is an endeavour worth pursuing, but isn't a direct democracy a very valuable ideal too? If a computer network acts like a direct democracy, then it could be possible to embedd into it an inconditional set of rules to act as a constitution (like the parameters of a cryptocurrency), and then a free market of democractic network with different constitutions would be set in motion where only the best consitutions will allow the network to thrive over the rest."

First flag could be geographically limited (as laws vary across countries). All adults could ignore the second flag (or any of those three flags for that matter).

By enabling another to have power over you ( in this case, the community) you have enabled infiltration an abuse of those powers.  You're taking about enabling the hive mind to have greater power.  We already see the effects on reddit.    I once considered myself a patriot, willing to die for the people of my nation, thinking they were overall decent people (there are always a few retards).  I was wrong.  Now I'm willing to fight (and if necessary kill) for my beliefs.  Those beliefs haven't changed much from the time I enlisted until now.    Why has changed is my understanding of how those beliefs have been abused by those in power.  The people in power are owned by corporations and all of them desperately want to keep power to ensure the future of their children as royalty in all but name.    Look at the Snowden documents just released or the way shill work here on reddit. There is no way to prevent the infiltration or manipulation of such a body.    Look at the system md debate concerning Debian.  Canocal employees did everything they could change the vote to a system that would financially benefit Canocal.    Do you think advertising wouldn't suddenly crop up because sponsorships of 300 USD to a popular member in a developing nation means his family eats for the next 6 months? Because he was part of the unacknowledged power structure that occurs wherever humans are?   Do you ostracize him or do you accept that his family was starving and accept his actions?   What about Sabu?  I'm not the biggest fan of Anon  or lulz (ddosing game servers doesn't have a real purpose in most cases) but the betrayals will happen.  Everyone has a price (it may not be money) but if everyone accepts responsibility for their own freedoms and power, there wouldn't be a Sabu to destroy the community.

No corporations, no governments, just democratic decisions on what content is permitted by the users of that same system, with checks and balances to guard against misuse of this process.  The effects on Reddit? Perhaps I'm not looking in the right places but I don't see where the Reddit model of content management has failed.  It seems to me that you're taking a no compromise stance, which you're entitled to do, but effectively you're saying if I want freedom of speech I must permit everyone else to share whatever they like, no matter how offensive, degrading or damaging that is. Is that fair to say?"
darknetplan,1zcsbr,nuclear_splines,4,Sun Mar 2 19:03:41 2014 UTC,"I have a no compromise stance. I do strongly suggest you look up the most recent documents out of the Snowden cache that was released.    Content management is done via circle jerk.  There are tons of private subs that are of much higher quality that are invite only.  Why so you think /r/politics and /r/atheism were reviled?  That circle jerk.  I don't downvote because I disagree with someone.  Try going to either one of those subs and seeing what posting a differing opinion results in and how fast your post is down voted into oblivion.   That is correct.  Any freedom must be completely free or it would not be a freedom. As I said, there are plenty of people that I would happily put a bullet into their heads with no remorse.  By the same token, to reduce the freedoms of the innocent because a small percentage of an ostracized community does using the same technology is no different than what the United States government is doing now.    This is my last post discussing this matter as I have a rather lengthy drive ahead of me.  In the end though, should something like what you suggest be implemented, people like me will simply move on to another format where we don't have to worry about regulation.  We don't abuse people, we don't abuse animals, we just want to be free from being oppressed by religion or politics. We were called crackpots and crazy before privacy was trendy.

Let me make this clear, I am not advocating content policing to be done by law enforcement officials. Furthermore, I am not advocating any policing that is directly tied to your personal identity, and the only punishment for illegal activity is exclusion from the network (if implemented properly).  Think about it like this, imagine all web content was shared with your Reddit name. Content people don't like is marked down, just like on Reddit. Cross the line enough and you're removed from Reddit. Now in this analogy, what happened that was so bad? You weren't thrown in jail, you don't even have any repercussions at all in your real world personal life, all that changed was your access to a site. What I'm proposing will be just like that, except you'll also have the opportunity to reinstate your access should you have been wrongly accused.  Like it or not, there is a large proportion of the population that won't want anything to do with networks that permit unrestricted movement of illegal/questionable content. What I'm proposing is a compromise that recognises the validity of that viewpoint, but doesn't have to result in repercussions outside the network (nor need it last forever, such restrictions could expire). What would you propose we do about this issue?"
darknetplan,1zcsbr,_HagbardCeline,6,Sun Mar 2 23:56:30 2014 UTC,"Like it or dislike it, there can be no compromise.  I know that sounds brutal, however, if you look at every time a citizen has been forced to compromise with any government, the citizen gets fucked.    The real name thing has been tried.  The NSA just discredits any individuals that they deem a idealistic threat (as we've seen from the recently released Snowden documents). It is not feasible because of the inevitable censor ship.   There can be no compromise with those who want power and control.  We are in the weak position, those who want freedom and are willing to accept the responsibilities that come along with having freedom.  (Imagine how many vegetarians there would suddenly be if you made them slaughter the animals for the meat.  People want shiny things without paying their dues).  The infiltration is bad enough.  The reality is such that there is nothing that can be done (technologically) without empowering the people we hope to take our power back from through all of these privacy practices.    The only thing that we can do is work to change the nature of society, one step at a time do that there aren't lawyers, politicians, lobbyists, pedophile, and people who abuse animals. Is that likely to happen, no.  Not while people bury their heads in the sand.   Even so, the pedos know that they will eventually be doxed by a friend or family member or victim.  They know the Western world hates them.    Either everything must be permissible or nothing is permissible.  If they censor one person (no matter how despised) they will censor everyone."

As for changing the nature of society, sure in an ideal world we wouldn't need to consider such measures, but I'd say we'd be 'burying our head in the sand' if we didn't discuss what could be done, which is all we're doing here.  As for doxing friends/family members/victims, how is that any different to what can happen now? If someone wants to frame you for something, they can, regardless of the security of the network.

Again, I'm on my mobile or I would find the link, I encourage you to look up the latest Snowden docs about online manipulation done by the NSA.    That's not even referring to the psychological aspects that people do every day (trolling, etc...)    People are aware of the issue, and have discussed it before.  The problem always comes back to who watches the watchers.   We can't claim that community actions will work, as we have seen, the government and those who own them (corporations) have the money to hide facts or the legal power to hide facts and imprison or execute those who disrupt their game.   Doxing is power.  With enough illusions, even someone as great as Turning was driven to suicide.  The actions of Edison and what he did to Tesla set society back by how many centuries?  Their names weren't cleared until long after they were dead.  With enough circumstantial evidence and good word play (how lawyers make their money and almost every political is a lawyer), you can clear the name of the guilty and condemn the innocent.    I'll make my own decisions, thanks though.  As for criminals who invade the community, lets look at a few examples where mistakes would be made   Should we refuse to let all Muslims participate because their culture allows 8 year old girls to be married off to 50 year old men?

darknetplan,1zcsbr,chakravanti93,6,Sun Mar 2 19:23:23 2014 UTC,So all data shared on the network must reveal the geographical location of its host? Seems like a pretty big privacy violation to me.

darknetplan,1z9d8c,blodyx,4,Sat Mar 1 12:05:26 2014 UTC,There are a lot of crypto-coin related P2P hosting projects working on this:  /r/ethereum (a platform for all sorts of P2P apps)  /r/maidsafe  /r/bitcloud  TPB's new browser will also host all the data in P2P format.  There's also GNU's MediaGoblin.
darknetplan,1z9d8c,pushme2,3,Sun Mar 2 00:31:03 2014 UTC,"The problem with decentralized systems like freenet is that it is read only. That means that any sites or data on there can not have any server-side logic (no PHP, Python, Ruby, nothing). For many kinds of sites, this is fine, but if you want to have content submitted to the site automatically, like comments or posts, then that is not possible directly (it could be possible to have users send an email or something out-of-band, then the receiver could update their site automatically with the new content).  You are correct in saying that these types of systems can be very resilient to DOS attacks because the content is decentralized and p2p.  You are also kind of right, in that the block chains implemented by the various cryptocurrencies can host content directly in the block chain. This, however, is not feasible because once content is put into the block chain, it can never be removed in a secure way. However, that does not mean that it is not feasible for a block chain to link to external content. Namecoin does just this. It is simply a system where you can register a name, like ""example"". Once that name is registered, you can then associate that name with anything, it could be an IP address for the normal internet, it could be a Hyperboria address, it could be a Tor onion address or even an I2P address.  Systems like Tor and I2P do offer some level of DOS protection if for no other reason than that they give such limited throughput."
darknetplan,1z9d8c,pushme2,2,Sat Mar 1 12:28:02 2014 UTC,"Great, lots of new stuff to dig into ;)  But for a short answer on my long question...  Is there a p2p solution working today where one can publish stuff for everybody to read even during ddos attacks?"
darknetplan,1z9d8c,Natanael_L,6,Sat Mar 1 12:41:37 2014 UTC,"Freenet. There is also a kind of clever way to do it with Namecoin. If you know about bt magnet links, they can be embedded into Namecoin. This is not a perfect solution, because how would people know to look for that link, you know? While sites hosted in I2P or Tor alone are not a 100% solution, they do offer some protection against DOS attacks.  In an ideal world, there would be a system similar to Freenet, except it would exist entirely inside I2P or Tor. And your ""Freesite"" would be a fairly complex page that pulls in other resources if they are available. So if everything was all fine and dandy, posts and comments would appear on the page, but if they were down or otherwise not available, the static content would still show up."

darknetplan,1z9d8c,Calabri,3,Sat Mar 1 14:26:12 2014 UTC,"DDOS resilience is definitely a pro if your application can be built with p2p webhosting. This kind of webhosting won't work for applications that have sensitive data (online banking). Through some clever rethinking of an application though, you can build most other apps with client-end communication only.  Sites that use p2p webhosting will be largely client-side code. This is where web applications are heading at the moment, as html5 and forward leaps in javascript are giving rise to the ability to create a web application that works very similar to a native application.  A site with content that rarely changes is slow and simple for a network. To start, you'd have to have a version on each code release you do. If your subscribers request the newest version of your site, they should know how to get to your node (whether it's some public DNS blockchain or just a raw address). This is how webhosting works currently.  If your audience is in a small geographical area, or you have a lot of traffic, you could say you have a high-density audience. If the density reaches some sort of critical point, you probably are getting popular, and this is where the p2p functionality of meshnets shines. You can set a timeout on each version of your site and have the client-side code of the site first ask its nearest neighbors whether they have an up-to-date-enough version of the blog. If they don't, then the client at least knows the originating node, and can ask for it there. This also makes the client another proud owner and sharer of your site content until the timeout is up.  For something like a social network, you have a lot of realtime data being fed to and from the client. P2P again shines here. On social networks, each person really only needs to feed data to his or her subscribers. There's no need to hop over to {app_name}'s Massive Data Farm, and then have their servers feed your data out to your friends. You just broadcast your update to anyone who's following you, and they'll have the newest info about who you are. The neighbor-asking logic works here too. If you have someone like Obama on a social network, you can't expect his personal computer to be able to send that many copies of a status update in an ample amount of time. So you add a timeout to his updates feed, and you send his updates to subscribers in different geographical locations. Now you have less traffic because those other nodes will spread and host Obama's updates for you. And no ddos!  Media streaming is where it gets fun. I imagine it would work much like Torrenting, but then it's not really streaming. There would probably be yet another round of copyright battles."

darknetplan,1z9d8c,Im_In_You,2,Sat Mar 1 20:11:44 2014 UTC,"Well the core issue here is that at some point for the majority of people to read this content, it needs to have a gateway to the real world. Content hosted on e.g., Freenet will appear anywhere it's accessed, and so perhaps anyone running a Freenet node can access the content even under a DDoS of the original host... But that doesn't help with someone DDoSing ""example.com"" to prevent it from serving a mirror of SSK@whatever,stuff/you/need/hosted.  If you do have a central repository of content, you could build out a CDN that pulled content from Freenet regularly to update its static cache, and the dynamic portions of the site (posting comments, making new blog posts, etc.) could be the only things served through a centralized point... but this helps no more than simply using the same number of servers that you used to build your CDN without Freenet.  On the other hand if a large organization started offering SSK mirroring for your content as a distribution mechanism, you could implement that system in such a way that posting comments would be stopped by DDoS, but the large CDN would then still be able to be updated with a new post made on say, your home computer and pushed to Freenet, and it would require DDoSing the entire CDN to take down the message at hand.  Of course that would be a large technical investment, so I certainly wouldn't expect this to come from Akamai or Cloudflare or the like, but if someone started selling it, someone else might eventually start buying."

The act basically states that other ISP's must sell us access to their current infrastructure and network ""at cost""(meaning they cannot over charge us and try to screw us) and then I would continue to try to gain more support from other neighboring neighborhoods to continue to grow our local internet capabilities. I sadly don't know enough at this time to formulate a more complex plan but that's at least an idea(it comes from many other stories about areas/towns lacking internet in which they just built it themselves and connected it to the rest of the internet).

They are using the collisions to actually boost your signal and bandwidth (instead of them battling each other, think of it as them ""stacking""). This is why I think this could be a major boon for meshnets, once we get longer range Wi-Fi standards.   The reason the Wi-Fi Alliance has been focusing lately on 5Ghz and 60 Ghz bands is because we're already seeing too many 2.4 Ghz routers intersecting and conflicting with each other. But pCells would not only make that a non-issue, but would actually increase your signal and bandwidth, because of that intersection."

darknetplan,1yqxja,sdoorex,1 point,Mon Feb 24 19:12:25 2014 UTC,There is a bit more than a checkbox involved which is the whole point of SSL - you will need to get your own CA signing certs into those clients for a start and generate your own fake site certs on the fly.  If this is proprietary technology then it just locks out OSS solutions which is bad for security.  It's good that there is a standard that can be used for interoperability and home brew solutions.  Edit - actually I think I misunderstood your point there - you are meaning that SonicWALL will simply block SSL and force the use of HTTP?  Try doing that with sites hosted on a CDN.

darknetplan,1ys7mv,benjyc,1 point,Thu Feb 27 19:20:19 2014 UTC,"the system works extremely well, and the cost is pretty low.   For every Bitcoin transaction that is processed, it costs $38. On a per transaction basis, the block reward subsidy is current around $38. There are $15,000 of new Bitcoin created every ten minutes. Mining subsidies dilute the equity of every Bitcoin holder. By that metric, Bitcoin transactions are more expensive than a $25 wire transfer, but it is everyone who pays for it, so people dont notice. As long as Bitcoin capital inflows are greater than capital outflows, the price keeps going up and people dont see the cost of running the network.  The security of the Bitcoin network is not that great either. Attacking the network only costs 40 million dollars in ASICs. So in reality, Bitcoin is only secure because no government has considered Bitcoin a large enough threat to commit 40 million dollars to attacking it. Bitcoin network hides the expense of running the network and hides its security weaknesses. As Bitcoin matures, these issues become exponentially worse, but wont be felt for decades.  Bitcoin is an experiment, but probably will not survive in the long term. Satoshi never intended Bitcoin as the final system, but only a proof of concept and inspiration. We dont need more catcoins and pump and dumps. We need new coins that address the existential threats Bitcoin is facing.   you're saying you don't need proof of work.    We have a new algorithm. It is based upon Paxos and randomized consensus models for the byzantine generals problem. There are proofs in academia that adversarial network consensus is trivial with randomization and a secured public broadcast channel. We can prove that all the ""honest"" nodes will arrive at same consensus and that block chain fork probability approaches 0% exponentially quickly.  The Skycoin consensus model is a game changer, because it allows coins to achieve extremely high levels of security, without the cost of mining. Your network could have ten nodes on it and it will be more secure than the Bitcoin blockchain.  See: * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_algorithm * http://cryptography.wikia.com/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance"
darknetplan,1ys7mv,benjyc,1 point,Thu Feb 27 20:51:20 2014 UTC,"interesting. I will be following this more closely. with regards to BTC some of the arguments are not accurate.    an attack is much harder than what you describe, or rather impossible. overhashing the network doesn't really buy you anything as the attack becomes quickly known and the chain forked, while the attacker lost money. I personally don't see any existential threat at all. look at the ghash issue and how quickly that was solved. also mtgox caused barely a blip in the price. fees are now reduced to 0.0001 = 0.005$. some argue that fees will be raised once the block reward is close to zero. how floating fees will work remains to be seen. I don't see how you arrive at the 38$ figure. if someone transfers 10k$ it can be done for basically zero fees (percentage wise). one can even do microtransactions with Mike's protocol in bitcoinj.   I agree with the overall sentiment though. more evolution of the concept will be a very good thing. but I think not necessarily for the reasons described. I agree that we might get rid of PoW."
darknetplan,1ys7mv,benjyc,1 point,Sun Mar 9 18:27:17 2014 UTC,"Each Bitcoin transaction ""costs"" $38 is because 25 Bitcoin are created each block as subsidies to miners. If bitcoin is at $1000, then each block ""cost"" $25,000. The mining reward will be approximately equal to cost to mine the block. If there are 100 transactions in the block, then each transaction cost $250 in terms of the new Bitcoin that were created.  These fees are given to miners as block rewards, but over time the fees will come from users instead of from the Block reward."
darknetplan,1ys7mv,colorcodebot,1 point,Sun Mar 9 20:00:09 2014 UTC,"For example the last block Block #_290513, had a block reward of  $15,936.50, with 256 transactions, which means a reward of 62.25$ per transaction, which is ""paid by"" all stakeholders in Bitcoin. However this is not a direct payment and inflation is perfectly known to everyone. It does not cost me 62$ to send 1mBTC. It costs everyone holding bitcoin in the sense of inflation, not of payment. Inflation is compensated by market price increase though. early bitcoin holders are pretty happy about the ""inflation"". It is conceivable that one can construct a system where later adopters receive more of the share of the market cap (10B$ as of today). This would require a scheme different than proof of work.  Miners calculate the costs and rewards very carefully. What is missing is a true market for fees (floating fees). This makes the system more complicated, which is why it's not implemented yet. It does not really matter how many bitcoin exist, only what the shape of the growth curve is, who gets to benefit from the money supply and transactions. This is  analogous to the gold market. Total tons of gold is finite and the more gold gets mined the costlier it becomes. Gold miners calculate cost of mining versus future demand. In the year 2020 reward will be still 6 BTC, but the price will be potentially much higher. The monetary reward for mining is still there. All of these effects are extremely carefully calibatrated in the Bitcoin system."

darknetplan,1ys7mv,jercos,1 point,Fri Mar 14 12:09:01 2014 UTC,"""It costs everyone holding bitcoin in the sense of inflation, not of payment.""  Right now, at $35/transaction in miner rewards, it only costs 50 million to attack network. In future, unless fees per transaction increase or number of transactions per block increase, the reward per block will not be sufficient to secure the network.  If Bitcoin has a 120 billion market cap and is secured by 10 million dollars worth of hardware, people will buy coins on an exchange with Bitcoin and then 51% attack to revert the Bitcoin transaction to the exchange. Bitcoin cannot survive in the long term because the cost running the network and security of the network are related, but only weakly influence the transaction costs.  What is happening, is the ""cost to attack network"" is hitting peak this year. It may continue to go up, but in long term will decline after 2018. Some people believe the ""cost to attack network"" will continue to increase exponentially, but that can only happen if the blocksize is uncapped and transactions per block increase dramaticly. We might have 500 MB blocks which, causing other issues. Or transaction fees have to increase to a level that most users are unlikely to accept.  The most likely scenario is that transaction fees will remain low and the price will go up. The cost to attack network will stay around 50 million dollars, until someone attacks the network and bankrupts a major exchange.  Wall street exchanges and banks are beginning to integrate Bitcoin, the magnitude of and profitability of a successful 51% attack is increasing.  Skycoin eliminates the 51% attack. It makes it very difficult to branch the blockchain chain at an earlier block."
darknetplan,1ys7mv,jercos,1 point,Fri Mar 14 12:09:10 2014 UTC,"current hardware investment for 51% hashingpower is >100M$. but still you can't destroy the network. it just means you can overpower it to do double spends. and if the source is known the other 49% can start a new network/chain. PoW is wasteful and alternative DNS might solve the problem. but that is at least 10 years away, as deploying an alternative internet costs say 100B$? it's good that people are working on these things."

How does discovery/autoconf work if public keys are only shared between existing connections? How are exit nodes discovered?

They all have backdoors in the key initialization scheme. RC4, A5/1, TLS and WEP all have backdoors. This project standardized on a set of cryptographic primitives which are secure, have minimum dependencies and difficult to implement poorly. All of the cryptography is implemented in less than 1200 lines of C in two files.    How does discovery/autoconf work if public keys are only shared between existing connections?    Ephemeral key exchange with elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman. Discovery and routing are separate issues and are outside of the protocol spec.   Fixed 32-bit routing labels will get pretty big if this is meant to mesh more than one neighborhood   There is method for making it fixed 32-bits per path, instead of 32-bits per hop.

Okay.   any of the commercial VPN solutions  RC4, A5/1, TLS and WEP all have backdoors   RC4 I don't recall any evidence that it was ever backdoored, only misused in WEP, and eventually weakened based on statistical biases, leading to both identifiable ciphertext, and possibly to breaking RC4 when used correctly. TLS itself as far as I know doesn't have any known backdoors or weaknesses (though attacks on the use of RC4, RSA, MD5 etc. in TLS have come up, those are not backdoors)  And of course if you're going to tell me that I simply don't know about the backdoors, I could say the same about Skycoin. Claiming in your spec to have no backdoors is simply not feasible. You have no way of proving without a doubt that the algorithms you have chosen are not vulnerable to some form of cryptanalysis that you are unaware of.

TLS is vulnerable to timing channel attacks and the most widely supported implementations are bugged and/or using ciphers and key schedules that are known to be weak. Timing channel attacks on TSL and SSL have been published since 1998.  We only use constant time cryptographic operations which are resilient to timing channel attack and only using cipher suites that have no known key-recovery attacks. In contrast, the majority of TLS, SSL, WEP, A5/1, RC4 implementations currently in use have known key recovery attacks.   All VPN standards and IPsec except OpenVPN have known security issues.

There was some really cool stuff done with optics + meshnet but even then it would be easy for govt to find and shut down nodes.   Mesh networking will become more viable eventually, but a ton of people have to be participating. I would say that in the event of an internet and cell phone blackout, the options would be a landline link like telecomix proposed/used during the Egyptian revolution and/or several amateur radios transmitting in a common amateur modulation such as Fax, SSTV, or JT65 to send text and pictures.

darknetplan,1ydx5g,jester8113,4,Wed Feb 19 23:00:33 2014 UTC,Looks like some firmware's based on OpenWRT that integrate MESH protocol (bmx6) for setting up meshes easily.  I found it when looking at the github commit history or one of the libre-mesh contributors. Could we get a curated sidebar list or promising mesh projects? libre-mesh looks like it had traction but now there is no update for months.
darknetplan,1ydf83,yerofeyev,9,Wed Feb 19 20:20:35 2014 UTC,"They've made contact (and also with MaidSafe). I agree, if possible, they should be integrated with each other.  Look at what happens right now in the crypto-coin market. There are now what - 200 different coins? All of them could be integrated with each other, and sold much more easily on P2P decentralized exchanges (also on top of Ethereum) without having to beg some centralized exchanges to adopt them. On an Ethereum-like platform every single app would be P2P and distributed.  Also those altcoins could actually be useful. Think a of a new start-up making its own coin as sort of ""shares"" that you can own early on in the company. I would love to buy such shares in a private company like Snapchat or SpaceX for example, before it gets an IPO (if IPOs are even relevant in an Ethereum future). There are a lot of synergies that could help create some awesome stuff.  Building this on a meshnet will make the network that much more resilient."
darknetplan,1ydf83,PhilipGlover,4,Wed Feb 19 22:47:18 2014 UTC,Exactly. Combine the two and you will get a decentralized Internet running on a secure distributed network on which all the apps are decentralized as well by default.

darknetplan,1ydf83,Jazzspasm,3,Thu Feb 20 05:30:49 2014 UTC,"Ethereum makes perfect sense for OpenLibernet, as bandwidth payments are a necessary part of the protocol. While accounting is done against the packet count in Layer 3, any higher layer can access this information, so it wouldn't be a problem for Ethereum.  For CJDNS, I'm not sure how a contract would be useful. The protocol is inherently simple. Just routing packets to the next node."
darknetplan,1ydf83,otakugrey,2,Thu Feb 20 00:08:51 2014 UTC,I saw them speak at a meetup a few weeks ago - lots of support from the community in London
darknetplan,1ydvg1,insecuritytheater,3,Wed Feb 19 22:45:05 2014 UTC,"Sounds like it's meant to be owned by a big telco company? Don't think it has any relevance to meshnets, although perhaps parts of the technology (like the bubble thing) could be used in a future Wi-Fi standard for longer ranges.   Lately the Wi-Fi Alliance has been moving away from long ranges, and more towards short ranges, with new standards, I think mainly because they don't want everyone's networks to intersect. But this technology could perhaps eliminate that problem, and maybe we'll get some sub-2Ghz Wi-Fi standard in the future if we push for it (we could make the argument that it's useful for rural areas, poor countries, etc).  So let's start asking the Wi-fi Alliance to do that for 802.11ad or 802.11ae, whichever is next. We'll also need some unlicensed spectrum at lower frequencies."
darknetplan,1ydvg1,cheshirelaugh,3,Wed Feb 19 23:00:35 2014 UTC,So I'm just an alarmist here but it sounds to me like a funny way of saying they've patented meshnets and will be saturating the unlicensed spectrum for commercial use. It's relevant here because it's effectively a dagger in our backs ... it means if we want to set up our own meshnets we will be impeding on their intellectual property and the FCC's regulations in doing so.  It never explicitly says any of these things in the article but to me it sounds like every corporate slime ball's wet dream which would be business as usual for them. What else could we expect from the guy who invented WebTV?

I think these two projects differ in the following areas:  From OpenLibernet white paper:     our protocol implements a LISP-like functionality, and assigns to each node two different addresses. One is the permanent Peer Address, the other a temporary IP address that is obtained automatically and organically changes as the shape of the mesh changes due to joining and parting nodes.   From CJDNS whitepaper:     cjdns is built on the idea that the ISPs and hosting providers which exist now will never upgrade, not to LISP, not to DNSSEC, not even to IPv6 in any meaningful way. Building new systems to be compatible with old systems is catering to the audience you will never have. Asking existing ISPs to upgrade for the common good is asking them to take a risk with no immediate benefit. cjdns is about throwing out the book and redefining the specifications in a way that will be fast, secure, and most importantly, easy for the next generation of ISPs to deploy and use.

Given how similar some of your design goals are, you may wish to consider using their codebase at least as a starting point. Other ideas:   Ant routing. The worst thing about CJDNS is that, even though it splits up identity (IP) from routing logic, it doesn't even attempt to leverage this to achieve full anonymity by default throughout the network. Ant routing is one of the most well-researched anonymity methods and it doesn't waste upload bandwidth the way onion routing does. A disruptive technology like this has the power to change the world forever. Making all data delivery and data consumption deniable-by-default would make it more useful (and get you a bigger audience). GNS. Just watch their video."

Look at it like this:  Let’s say that Alice runs an exchange, and Eve has bitcoins sitting in that exchange. Eve decides to withdraw her coins, and asks Alice to send the bitcoins to her address. When Alice sends them, this automatically creates a transaction, which is transmitted for mining so that it can be included in the bitcoin block chain.  But Eve pretends that Alice never sent them. She uses the transaction malleability flaw to reproduce Alice’s original transaction, tweaking the signature slightly to produce a different hash. She then retransmits that transaction, with the different ID.  There is a chance that Eve’s transaction will be confirmed on the block chain first. If that happens, the network will assume that transaction is valid, and won’t record Alice’s. Eve can then complain to Alice that she didn’t receive the coins. When Alice checks for her transaction ID in the block chain, she won’t find it, and she might try to send more bitcoins, meaning that she’ll be out of pocket.  So a dehashing is theft, this is very real chance"

darknetplan,1xibac,HAL-42b,9,Mon Feb 10 09:33:43 2014 UTC,Well If the demand is there then the next step is informing the general public of the solution. Most people simply aren't aware of meshnet technology and it's many benefits.
darknetplan,1xibac,soulreveille,6,Mon Feb 10 20:28:10 2014 UTC,"This is something that definitely needs taking care of. A few days back I asked for write-ups about meshnets aimed at the general public. I wanted to put those write-ups together and form a well rounded review of the whole thing, then get this translated in as much languages as possible, having graphics and presentation material created etc. The end result would have been something like a journalist pack.   Unfortunately nobody bothered to write anything yet and I do not trust my English to write a journalist pack."
darknetplan,1xibac,MrMaxPowers247,5,Mon Feb 10 20:53:04 2014 UTC,Start it as a charity. Set up nodes for free until you have something people want.
darknetplan,1xibac,MrMaxPowers247,2,Mon Feb 10 20:54:03 2014 UTC,"Hardware goes out of fashion very quickly and none of it is produced in the country. Everything is imported with price tags to reflect that. We get the same technology for twice the US price.   There is no way I (or any one else ) could sustain that.   If there is a charity this should be its source of revenue, not expense. The charity could then spend the money to promote, provide content for the community, fight the legal battles and finance the long hops between cities."
darknetplan,1xibac,MrMaxPowers247,3,Mon Feb 10 21:11:58 2014 UTC,"My thought was to use old routers, you could get those cheap if not free at garage sales. Maybe also start a donation drop off for routers. The idea is to get enough nodes out there so it is useful then you could start charging for people that want better performance."
darknetplan,1xibac,MrMaxPowers247,1 point,Mon Feb 10 21:20:07 2014 UTC,Personally I wouldn't take old modems from people. If somebody came with his own router I would just install the mesh firmware and tell them to deploy it where they think it would be most useful.  There are so many makes and models of old routers that I don't think it is possible to deploy them on large scale. It would be inefficient.
darknetplan,1xibac,MaunaLoona,1 point,Wed Feb 12 04:23:11 2014 UTC,I think you could find the models/brands that easily can be flashed with the software and only accept those. The old routers would only be used to get enough nodes in an area to actually be something of value. Once you have enough eggs you then can start selling omelets.
darknetplan,1xibac,MaunaLoona,1 point,Wed Feb 12 04:38:59 2014 UTC,If you are a non-profit you want to be inclusive of people and asking people for a specific make/model will go against that notion. You want people to come with their kids and their pets. On the other hand when people turn up to a router setup party with their old routers and some of them do not work there will be frustration and disappointment where we would normally want to see a sense of achievement and satisfaction.   It seems we have discovered one of those weird social situations that have to be handled with great tact and care. This should be planned in such a way that the sense of achievement for the participant is pretty much guaranteed.

darknetplan,1xci08,Serensius,1 point,Tue Feb 18 20:58:03 2014 UTC,"Alright!  First off, I'm really curious about your Istanbul-London bridge idea. I was hoping you could answer some questions about that (which should also apply to meshnets in general, so they should be useful for the thread I think):   Do you have any numbers of the minimum amount of routers it would take to establish the bridge? Is there a plan for the path it would take, such as what cities it would go through?   Would such a network be legal under current EU law? Are you worried about a potential crackdown when it gets going?   If signals are sent wirelessly, either through routers or larger radio antennas, isn't it likely that it can and will be intercepted (for example through the NSA's Tempest program*). Would it use perfect forward secrecy like cjdns, and would that mean that it doesn't matter if packets are intercepted?   Thanks!   http://dailycaller.com/2013/12/30/nsa-can-hack-wifi-networks-from-miles-away/)"
darknetplan,1xci08,Serensius,1 point,Wed Feb 19 02:05:11 2014 UTC,"The average distance between settlements across Europe seems to be in the order of 15 to 20km. Europe is really densely populated and neighboring settlements are mostly in view of each other. This still means an enormous number of hops but new technologies like distributed caching and storage (like MaidSafe) would ease the load tremendously. In total, no request should need to travel more than 50 hops. In time Istanbul to London should be traversable with something like 300 hops. This is an optimistic number and even that would present tremendous routing problems but I believe these can be overcome in time.  Another interesting problem that presents itself is the financing of the whole thing. Normal short range connections are possible for less than what your ISP charges you, and this is not recurring. On the other hand we need long range connections also. For example in order to connect Vlorë - Albania to Lecce - Italy we would need to establish a 80km link(s) across the sea. This is clearly outside the means of any single individual and we need to find a way to crowdsource it in order to encourage people living in such critical areas to participate. There should be some sort of reward mechanism for establishing and maintaining good links. This way of financing things will be valuable in its own right and once established could be very useful for other purposes like laying fiberoptics or extending the network to places like North Africa Syria Iran etc. - places in dire need of democracy.  I do not think there should be a definite single route for the bridge. Mesh networks are distributed by definition. Even Istanbul and London are just symbolic goal posts, once they are reached the mesh will just continue to expand beyond them. The route taken will be determined mostly by the terrain and by the people's willingness to have it pass from their location, so none of the routes excludes any other route.   I am not sure of the legislative standing of mesh networks, the equipment used is naturally compliant with the applicable regulations and this is how telcos can use them. Other than that, there should be no obstacles preventing people to communicate with each other freely. If there are any we should fight for their removal, for this we would need legal support, just like any other open source project. If there are some archaic laws preventing the existence of mesh networks those should be challenged and molded to accommodate the new developments.   Crackdowns against mesh networks are possible and quite likely in my country but as long as we have public support there is nothing to fear, mesh networks are robust.  NSA's capability to intercept microwave communication has been known even before Snowden. I have red about satellites that could intercept the leakage radiation of the antennas from space. This is cold war era technology and there is no doubt they have come a long long way since then. Tempest is only one among many programs designed to spy on everybody and they don't have any ethic limits nor any limits to their budget. Considering that, we should employ everything we can in order to preserve our privacy, including cjdns and a number of other things also.  P.S. I realize that some of these things are just my fantasies but I think they are realizable fantasies and this is the direction I'd like to steer the things If I can."

darknetplan,1x9kkz,dirvine,6,Fri Feb 7 20:56:43 2014 UTC,This feels a bit like bitcloud.
darknetplan,1x9kkz,GnarlinBrando,8,Fri Feb 7 18:50:05 2014 UTC,"Similar story really, we got surprised by bitCloud's claims and we want to allow them to use this to do their youtube system on. In terms of fixing all this, we went through a tremendous amount of work, it's not a simple thing and certainly just saying it would be good does not get it done. We do not want bitCloud to fail trying to solve what we have solved, it's too much work and wheel re-inventing to do that."
darknetplan,1x9kkz,dirvine,2,Fri Feb 7 19:20:22 2014 UTC,Good to hear. To many of the alternative internet projects cooperate too little.
darknetplan,1x9kkz,seekoon,3,Fri Feb 7 22:29:08 2014 UTC,"Agreed, we will use whatever we can and are speaking to other projects to enhance what we have / they have. It's crazy when you hear Engineers with a 'not invented here' mentality. We all need to work together if we really want change. Competition is vital and should never be resisted, but reworking is mental."
darknetplan,1x9kkz,remyroy,7,Sat Feb 8 01:16:20 2014 UTC,"Bitcloud was bullshit, it was basically a paper saying ""We're going to implement distributed internet by implementing distributed internet"". This actually has working code."
darknetplan,1x9kkz,maidansafe,7,Sat Feb 8 01:37:27 2014 UTC,I agree. Implementation is superior to no implementation.
darknetplan,1x9kkz,dirvine,4,Sat Feb 8 04:26:03 2014 UTC,"How is maidsafe actually related to this ominous website and enterprise called sigmoid ( http://www.sigmoidsolutions.com ), I came across this address and name mentioned in a blog or something in the year 2011 and both names maidsafe.net and sigmoid were given there. The sigmoid website is also still available and very much sounds exactly as a clone of the maidsafe or as if a somewhat business oriented implementation or aspect of it. They compare it to some enterprise cloud and storage systems in tables and more. The sigmoid contact addresses and business addresses are exactly the same in the same city in the same country, and nosing around a bit on the net and doing research reveals some weird accumulations of maidsafe workforce and directors names and company names and a photographers name who apparently also took pictures in that Troon city where maidsafe and sigmoid is located and if I am not completely paranoid who was also acting as a maidsafe and both sigmoid director. Don't mean to stalk or anything but my head is dizzy from all these names and weird coincidences or say crossovers and overlappings in names and places. What on earth is going on with this whole maidsafe enterprise? :)"
darknetplan,1x9kkz,dirvine,7,Sat Feb 8 01:56:40 2014 UTC,"Sigmoid is another project, it shares code but completely separate from maidsafe.  It has a different access mechanism. The Sigmoid access is such that the boss adds users and has complete control over them. It's for large enterprises and we spun it out years ago. The IP for Sigmoid is up for sale as it's not in line with the teams objectives. If it sells (and I think it will) then the funds from that will further maidsafe and the foundation.   So it's a legally separate entity with a completely different proposition and code base. MaidSafe cannot use the access mechanisms of Sigmoid and Vice Versa.   If you see MaidSafe as Privacy Security and Freedom for all then Sigmoid represents the exact opposite. This is how large enterprises want it and we are happy they can get the tech to do that. It is a very different proposition though. See the Sigmoid patents and you will realise how different it is and why we do not as Maidsafe work in that field.   It's not trolling BTW and it's not a secret either, I invented two very different systems for different purposes and Sigmoid should fuel the maidsafe network if we realise the value from it.   So it has zero to do with MaidSafe (it legally cannot, I set things up like that)  except I am a shareholder of that (as I am not at Maidsafe) and use it to fund my vision :-)"
darknetplan,1x9kkz,Travv,1 point,Sun Feb 9 00:50:34 2014 UTC,"Good luck contributing to Sigmoid code :-)  it's not available and will probably be closed source. It's an enterprise product and whoever owns it will unlikely Open Source it, I don't know. Enterprises are getting smarter so they might.  I do know it's not MaidSafe though and you can contribute to that.   The core tech, vaults rudp etc. is available to all and a Sigmoid buyer would be wise to keep contributing to that and improving it and getting improvements from the community. In that case they will have to make their code GPL, it's possible and this is exactly why licenses like GPL exist. If they do not want to do that they cannot use the vaults and contributions etc.    No difference from any other company, except Sigmoid have IP for access none of us have and many of us would not want.   Remember we are MaidSafe not sigmoid and the staff own Maidsafe shares not Sigmoid Shares, they would be way more more pissed than you if your accusation were true. I would not be in a good position if that were the case."

darknetplan,1x9kkz,yoshiK,4,Sat Feb 8 07:49:56 2014 UTC,"[employee] if you check the code in common (crypto.h) you will see some of the algorithms, also check rsa.h and then the self encryption library.  We do not and will not use TLS as it's flawed in implementation in the current internet. We may implement a method that uses TLS when there is no PKI that's under human control. For further validation check out the cryptopp mailing list, you will find us there a good bit. I hope you will find no snake oil there :-)"
darknetplan,1x9kkz,dirvine,3,Fri Feb 7 19:37:21 2014 UTC,"After looking a bit, you use SHA (which version), AES, RSA ( which key length?) as your cypher suite? ( May I ask, why you don't use EC crypto?)   Also you mention in your faq:   MaidSafe's technology has been peer reviewed with papers published and presented at the Wireless World Research Forum and the IEEE Computer Society.    I believe these papers have a overview section, so do you have a link?"
darknetplan,1x9kkz,yoshiK,2,Sat Feb 8 00:12:12 2014 UTC,"SHA512, AES256 (CFB) I think there are links on our site, but we will make sure they are if not. The wiki certainly will have all this info.  We chose not to go down the EC route simply due to being unsure of patent issues (no longer great concern though) and lack of widespread use relatively speaking. So we plumped for RSA. Changing the asymm ciphers is very easy in the system though.   I am sure when the dust settles we will see what's the most effective and a switch can be made if required. I think for bitcoin EC makes way more sense and provides advantages RSA would not.   It is a question on crypto lists that looks like vi/emacs in many way yet."
darknetplan,1x9kkz,dirvine,2,Sat Feb 8 02:30:25 2014 UTC,"It is a question on crypto lists that looks like vi/emacs in many way yet.    Yes. :)    Changing the asymm ciphers is very easy in the system though.    Is this a statement about the architecture of the MaidSafe code, or about the protocol? I am somewhat surprised, since it seems to imply that you don't use asymmetric cyphers for things on the network, where older versions client and thus of the protocol are probably used."
darknetplan,1x9kkz,HAL-42b,3,Sat Feb 8 13:32:03 2014 UTC,"Is this a statement about the architecture of the MaidSafe code, or about the protocol? I am somewhat surprised, since it seems to imply that you don't use asymmetric cyphers for things on the network, where older versions client and thus of the protocol are probably used.   Yes this is about the code. It would be possible to build clients that used a different asymm mechanism. The network will be RSA  for now, but it's versioned and could be altered at a later stage.   The network currently requires RSA of signature validation of key revocation etc. It's surprising how many signature checks we have been able to remove though due to the closeness protocols. I.e. we can accept requests based on the closeness to an address and depending on the request we can validate it by closeness rather than signature. This is why we needed a very accurate DHT, we got speed of networking and reduced signature checks substantially.   It is possible for a client to create an app with more keys or even EC keys and the network would be able to switch checking ciphers for revocation etc. That would not be simple, but entirely possible. The infrastructure is in place to do this.   Apart from that the network uses RSA encryption (well it's SafeEncrypt, so RSA key exchange with AES) at different levels for node to node messages and then upper layers also encrypt end to end. A client could use EC for end to end messages at higher levels though.   We have tried to make sure the tools are there for flexibility later on. Many things are protected by more than one cipher on purpose. This means if one breaks we can quickly re-engineer a fix. As I say not simple but good to have the mechanics there to make that job easier."

darknetplan,1x9kkz,autowikibot,4,Sun Feb 9 00:40:33 2014 UTC,"No elliptic curve cryptography still looks good. ( Do you think perhaps of Dual_EC_DRBG, a random number generator that was designed broken by the NSA. But this is due to construction, and could equally be used with for example RSA.)"
darknetplan,1x9kkz,api,1 point,Sat Feb 8 07:55:37 2014 UTC,"Dual EC DRBG: NSFW !      Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generator (Dual_EC_DRBG) is a claimed cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG) standardized by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), ANSI, and ISO. Dual_EC_DRBG is based on the elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) and is one of the four CSPRNGs standardized in NIST SP 800-90A.  In 2007 a possible backdoor was discovered with Dual_EC_DRBG's design, with the design of Dual_EC_DRBG having the unusual property that it was theoretically impossible for anyone but Dual_EC_DRBG's designers (NSA) to confirm the backdoor's existence. Doubts about Dual_EC_DRBG's security and performance had also been expressed even before it was standardized. Bruce Schneier concluded shortly after standardization that the ""rather obvious"" backdoor (along with other deficiencies) would mean that nobody would use Dual_EC_DRBG. In 2013, New York Times reported that documents ""appear to confirm"" that the backdoor was real, and had been deliberately inserted by the National Security Agency as part of the NSA's Bullrun decryption program. The alleged backdoor would allow NSA to decrypt for example SSL/TLS encryption which used Dual_EC_DRBG as a CSPRNG. In 2004, before NIST standardized Dual_EC_DRBG, NSA paid RSA Security $10 million in a secret deal to use Dual_EC_DRBG as the default in the RSA BSAFE cryptography library, which resulted in RSA Security becoming the most important distributor of the backdoored algorithm. In 2013 RSA responded to media reports to ""categorically deny"" any insinuation that RSA had ever knowingly colluded with the NSA to incorporate a flaw in Dual_EC_DRBG, saying ""we have never kept [our] relationship [with the NSA] a secret"".  Members of the ANSI standard group, to which Dual_EC_DRBG was first submitted, were aware of the exact mechanism of the potential backdoor and how to disable it, but did not take sufficient steps to unconditionally disable the backdoor. The general cryptographic community was initially not aware of the potential backdoor, until of Dan Shumow and Niels Ferguson 2007 rediscovery, or of Certicom's Daniel R. L. Brown and Scott Vanstone's 2005 patent application describing the backdoor mechanism.

darknetplan,1x9kkz,api,4,Sat Feb 8 01:18:19 2014 UTC,"[disclaimer : employee] Yes, storage capacity of a user is related to the resources he contributes to the network. So by storing garbage data, he will be paying from his own quota of storage space. As soon as his quota space fills up, he will not be allowed to store on the network, until he gets more space or clears up some old data.  The system has two parts, a client which stores/retrieves data and an application called Vault which contributes resources to the network. These 2 application can exist on different machines. Moreover one user can have multiple Vaults running on different machines contributing to network to claim more space."

So any unauthorised actions of user can only reach till their decentralised account only.   Along with that, their is a ranking mechanism, which will quickly down rank and kick nodes out of the network if they do unexpected action."

What if Irequire all the data right now, and one of the servers is down? How much redundancy do they implement? Will there be maidsafe servers that provide guaranteed uptime? That costs money. And don't forget about lag. A Globally distributed data center suffers from inherent lag problems, so it's no good for high availability requirements.  In short, I find little use for this kind of infrastructure. And if you want to keep it as a backup, then having an existing centralized infrastructure defeats the purpose of using this system at all."
darknetplan,1x9kkz,xzxzzx,19,Sun Feb 16 02:07:43 2014 UTC,"Employee alert:  There are no servers, it is a fully distributed P2P network. The network is made up by the resources (CPU, HDD and bandwidth) of all its users with the data (stored in encrypted fragments) spread throughout the network. 4 copies of each chunk of data are maintained at all times and the network is able to reconfigure globally in 20 milliseconds, ensuring that data is not lost as nodes become unavailable. This does not cost any money to run (other than the electricity of the users computer) as there is no server farms/data centres required. As the network reaches a certain size, the exponential impact of pulling users computing resources will actually allow it to become faster than a traditional centralised architecture as it is not prone to bottlenecks."

This will take msecs to get to the peer. Failing that if a peer misses 5 keep alive packets it's considered down. so the time is a  few milliseconds to 10 secs.  Unlike normal DHT networks (similar to D1HT) the nodes in the routing table are all connected. So a node down is isolated to the nodes connected to it, these nodes will either wait for another connection, or if they are in the closes proximity to the down node (within the close group) they will connect to a new close node.  You can think it's like islands of connected nodes in a huge venn diagram type configuration. It's very reliable and extremely fast at responding to churn.  You can download the code and run the big_routing_test to see these figures and alter churn rates and number of nodes as a test.

So I accept it will happen, look at Bohr (I think it was) and Einstein etc. there was a need for ferocious argument. I therefore wonder but see the measurements show me differently from my theory. I should accept this position and don't, it's a complex thing this world :-)"

Or is it still early in the development process and right now only hardcore devs with the ability to build their own versions are considered? When will there be any build ready to download/play with?
darknetplan,1x9kkz,the-ace,1 point,Fri Feb 7 17:17:08 2014 UTC,It is early in the development process and once the network is established and running you will be able to start working with it. There are quite a few developers looking to put apps on the network once it becomes available. It is hard to say when these early products will be available but I would think very soon as there seems to be a great deal of momentum right now. Sorry I can't be more exact with a time frame but there are quite a lot of variables here. Please stay in touch though.

Advantages:  They're able to push a reasonable amount of data in full duplex (300-400 Mb/s in each direction is not too hard to achieve). They're a hell of a lot cheaper than licensed PtP gear. The all-in-one housing, mounting and alignment tools means less gear to buy separately.    Disadvantages:  Pain in the ass to get installed ""just right"" which is required for best throughput. 24 GHz a lot more susceptible to rain fade and weather issues than their newer 5 GHz model of Airfiber. There are lower-cost solutions in the 2.4, 3.65 and 5 GHz ranges, but their speed is limited.    One side in a pair died to unknown causes.

BUT, they got them to work. I do not know the actual speed, because they didn't need the top speed.  But again, they are UBNT network partner (they sell their products) and the 2 buildings are the sales and management office and the warehouse.  They mainly deployed them as a proof of concept and as such, if you ask them if it works, they claim it is perfect (they are trying to sell them...)  But is it?  I know they claim to have a few clients with them, but who knows.  I know because I have a customer who is outside of the city where there is no high speed internet, and he was looking at using such a system to not only get internet access, but also to provide it to his neighbors, but his closest connection point was 20 KMs in bird eyes view with hills and forests between them (and nothing in the middle to rebroadcast)."

This process could be anywhere between fully automatic (based on RS trust level) or require enabling manually.  Hope I am being clear - RS forum post copied below    A  plugin to control your CJDNS peer list could be very handy.

If I have a perfectly good PC capable of running code fast locally, why the fuck would I want to rely on some Internet service that may or may not be there to charge me a tollbooth fee?  It's retarded.  Cloud services are not the future.  They are pushed by corporations as a way to maximize revenue models based on subscription service.  They are inferior to running local software and only make sense in the context of scalable processing power.  Furthermore the security implications of not being in control of your software or data are insanely bad.  Software as a service is pretty much inherently unethical in all of it's incarnations.

darknetplan,1x3dgr,ProtoDong,2,Wed Feb 5 21:48:52 2014 UTC,"That would be definitition be a shitload less efficient that finding the single fastest path and delivering it that way.  The bottlenecks in network communication are never along the backbone.  The first bottleneck comes from your ISP, where your service is delivered - choked to a certain speed.  The second bottleneck is in your home network.  These days most home networks are capable of 100Mb or 1Gb so the bottleneck is always at the ISP service level.  Routing protocols exist for the sole purpose of finding the most reliable and efficient path to deliver packets.  If speed is your goal, special cases aside, you won't do better than the current system.  tl,dr - in P2P communication, the bottleneck is always the upload speed of the person delivering the file.  Bittorent sidesteps this limitation by downloading from multiple sources.  But a single source is not going to avoid the upload limit this way."
darknetplan,1x3dgr,ProtoDong,2,Thu Feb 6 06:44:36 2014 UTC,"So couldn't you increase upload speed by sending packages across 6 parallel 100 Mbps connections as opposed to a single 100 Mbps connection?

darknetplan,1x3dgr,HAL-42b,0,Thu Feb 6 18:36:49 2014 UTC,Obviously... but nobody has multiple connections except for service hosts.  It's a lot cheaper to get a single 1Gb line than 6 100Mb lines.  Then you are back to where you started.... sending it over 1 600Mb line is more efficient than 6 100Mb lines although at this speed it's irrelevant because you will only have one route to your destination and the routing protocols on the backbones will coalesce your connections back together down the pipe.

With Bitmessage you're anonymous and there's also deniability when receiving messages.  If you combine Bitmessage with Tor, you also have deniability when sending messages.  Not only your message is encrypted, but nobody will know at all that you sent or received a message."
darknetplan,1wzuk0,gasull,2,Thu Feb 6 21:31:41 2014 UTC,"I have not checked deniability in BitMessage and Cables, but Hype has widely used and peer-reviewed deniability mechanism.  If you're after anonymity, run Tor or I2p and use http://dee.su/cables atop it - that thing has anonymity, perfect forward secrecy, and the encrypted message is very hard to intercept. The metadata is also obscured.  In Bitmessage, by contrast, all the metadata is in the clear and all the encrypted messages are public! Are those devs nuts? Do I have to explain that all interested parties just monitor the blockchain and record it for future decryption?  Moreover, bitmessage has no perfect forward secrecy! Combined with the previous point this means that once the private key is leaked, all your past bitmessages EVER are readable. ALL OF THEM. And breaking into somebody's computer with a zeroday and grabbing the key is not a problem for an intelligence agency - they can do that en masse.  By contrast, in Hype or Cables very few will know that the specified parties talked (cjdns takes deliberate steps to hide metadata from EVERYONE), so very few or nobody will know that the two handles have ever talked. And since those handles are public key fingerprints you can't just hot-swap them - in ANY of the protocols.  Finally, I don't want to download gigabytes to be able to read mail and then wait for another 10 minutes just to send somebody a message. That, combined with the vulnerabilities I described above, makes for a just ridiculous cryptosystem."

For handling non-static content, have each read-only access of a page create an empty sync folder to which the user has write-access. Read permissions to user shares can be peer-to-peer on a per-site basis. Unhosted has some really good ideas for how to deliver rich web content that is only processed client-side. Clearskies would make trustless cloud backup of user data dead simple compared to remotestore. Wishlist: If content is being found by fileshare instances rather than by IP, you might want to see if anonymity can be achieved by implementing ant routing.

With ant routing it would be, with no more latency than Tor. A key difference between this and Freenet is that with the former your store is a black box (the larger your store, the more of the network gets duplicated to your store), whereas with SyncNet more popular content would be more heavily duplicated and could be accessed much faster. If the background syncing program (currently BTSync unfortunately) can track seed/leech ratios, there could also be social incentives for mirroring content similar to regular bittorrent traffic."

Certain users (maybe all) have the part of the website that has the business logic and databases and they process the given data, generate a ""smart"" hash (to make sure that the executables haven't been tampered with) and the checked answer writes the result, which is then shared read-only to everybody else."

Inter-city links just aren't going to be worth the effort until there is enough users in those cities to make it worth doing. There is nothing wrong with tunneling over the internet in the mean time, though, you have to start somewhere.  As for how, same as any other links. I never understood why people think it's a different problem, I mean, it's not like the space between cities is barren wasteland. People live there too, and they might like the opportunity to be on the meshnet as well. Probably more so, in fact, as traditional connections tend to be even more expensive and slower outside of cities, making alternatives even more attractive."

Yes, there is nothing wrong with tunneling over the internet in the mean time. There was nothing wrong with using IP4 when it came out either, because there will never be enough computers connected to use all those IP's up. /s Let's build for the future a little bit here too.  If it's not a different problem, then why are their interstates between cities instead of small connector roads, and why is there an internet backbone instead of last mile runs of copper between everything?

Don't be a jerk (the comment about fun at parties wasn't polite).  As for linking between cities, most communities are still focused on building out local networks (neighborhood service). I've helped build a mesh network in Kansas City that spans both the Kansas and Missiouri side:  http://www.kcfreedom.net/  I'm also the cofounder/CTO of the Free Network Foundation  https://www.thefnf.org  and we worked with Connecting For Good and many other organizations in Kansas and Missouri to get the backbone deployed. Utilizing Ubiqiti (ubnt.com) gear to do the point to point links.   As more and more community networks get built, we'll see inter ""cluster/cloud"" links form. They are higher capacity , need to be ultra stable etc. As opposed to the access/distribution layers which have heavy redundancy due to node density.   So you don't want to start with inter city links. You grow to that organically."

These guys have nothing but vapor. Wifi lacks the power to work from satellite, and the round trip travel time will cause the TTL timer to expire, causing nearly every packet to be discarded unless both the satellite and the ground station have customizations in the radio firmware.  Also, EVERY participating ground station is going to need a BIG, high-gain directional antenna, with an accurate tracking system to follow the satellite as it passes over, just as EVERY other low earth orbit satellite does. The radio will require the facility to adjust for Doppler shift, which exactly ZERO wifi radios have.

The site does mention ""two-way Internet-access for a small set of users,"" but they didn't say that that portion would be Wifi.  I'm assuming they're getting hopes up and being sneaky rather than just uninformed.  You can also guarantee that ""as small set of users"" does not include you nor me.  The satellites would need one hell of a transmitter.  Take a GPS satellite's information for ballpark starting numbers:  500W over 2MHz with a 13dBi antenna, and receivers seeing -130dBm (and ignoring the fact that GPS satellites aren't microsatellites, so you still have to cram the same hardware into a smaller form factor).  Now spread that same 500W over a Wifi 20MHz channel....  802.11g needs around -50dBm for 54Mbps and around -86dBm to run at 6Mbps.  Good luck with that.  edit:  From their project lead's comment   At this time, we're shooting for receive sensitivity of about -90dBm.    And a couple down from it:   Correct, in all likelihood the noise floor in modern urban areas will be too dense. As much as we would like everyone to use Outernet, it's really meant for people who would otherwise not have access to information."
darknetplan,1wrf0p,IWillNotBeBroken,3,Sun Feb 2 14:03:01 2014 UTC,"TTL might be the wrong term, but a similar concept exists in 802.11 and would require custom firmware in order to overcome:  http://www.air-stream.org/ACK_Timeouts   Most implementations assume the IEEE recommended one-way Air Propagation Time of 1 µs, thus tune the ACK Timeout of their devices to 300 meters.   Also, Wi-Fi multicast is certainly not a proven technology. In my last job, I wrote an implementation of RFC 5740 and while it does work well, there are still many issues left to address. I would consider it to still be an experimental protocol when applied to wireless communication. In general, multicast is poorly supported, especially on mobile devices. Additionally, multicast can save lots of bandwidth at the cost of lowering all participants to the lowest common data rate.  Agreed that this is purely vaporware."
darknetplan,1wrf0p,friedfrank,3,Sun Feb 2 21:35:54 2014 UTC,"It's bizarre. There are plenty of proven satellite based communication systems, why peg it on something as blatantly unsuitable as wifi?  Satellite comms used to be uni-directional (you'd need a modem for the upstream leg) and latency has always been a problem. Time marches on though, we have suppliers in the UK who have worked on both of those and have a service which is comparable to consumer broadband now. As an example - http://www.avonlinebroadband.co.uk/  I assessed them for an outlying customer site but decided against it in the end, it was an interesting solution though."

darknetplan,1wrf0p,OABP,2,Thu Feb 20 16:58:28 2014 UTC,"All right, this is pretty cool, and it certainly proves the concept, but these guys think they're going to leverage WiFi hardware and broadcast via UDP. There are so many things wrong with their plan.  Your work on the other hand could possibly do what they're proposing, but the bandwidth is still going to suck, which means it will have to very light on the multimedia. WAP might be appropriate. They'll still have to handle satellite tracking using big antennas, and cope with doppler shift, not to mention there's virtually NO place for them to legally transmit."
darknetplan,1wrf0p,playaspec,2,Fri Feb 28 20:37:22 2014 UTC,"The point of the UDP bit is that it doesn't require a reply from the receiving devices on Earth. I think if they can hack around the software ground-side (ad-hoc mode with a pre-set SSID and BSSID?) they could manage to get commodity wifi radios to accept their one-way transmissions, should they be received.  The real question is whether those transmissions would be received. WiFi is not designed for this, so they'd need really, really high power to send anything from space, when ordinary wifi signals struggle with a couple hundred feet.  The other question is how they will justify taking up a huge chunk of the wifi spectrum, everywhere, to the FCC and its international friends."
darknetplan,1wrf0p,interfect,0,Sun Feb 2 12:38:42 2014 UTC,"They'd be better off going with LTE, or similar.

Although Outernet's near-term goal is to provide the entire world with broadcast data, the long-term vision includes the addition of two-way Internet access for everyone. For free.   I guess you are right, they do want to include the full internet, but not at first. Unless two-way Internet means something else.  I hope these cubesats will have enough speed and generate enough power to handle all of the connections. They are smaller than a normal desktop, they will have to generate power to transmit 60 miles or so(as the signal gets close to earth, it will lose more energy), and there will only be 150 of them."

If it was due to darknets, it would be Роскомнадзор (telecom etc supervision service) instead. Also russian cjdns forum works just fine, they would have blocked it first of all.

This wouldn't steal it as it seems it would just use proper credentials, however using bonding and something like Backtrack, you could achieve that, but you'll need multiple adapters and need to do a fair amount of spectrum research (also with a little luck if you aren't a city dweller where the spectrum is super heavy with networks).  You could just slap any amount of networks together but depending on quite a few factors it could actually slow you down.  Now of course, this would either involve getting the credentials by asking for them if you wanted to remain legal.

darknetplan,1w3g6d,danry25,2,Sat Jan 25 06:41:24 2014 UTC,"You can flash whatever radio firmware you want onto most android phones. I know this because I managed to flash the wrong radio firmware onto my android phone. The biggest problem here is probably finding someone who knows enough about the radio to write a custom firmware for it. And even then, it may not be possible (or depending on jurisdiction, legal) to convince the radio to do direct phone to phone communication over the cell phone band. Some assumptions may be baked into the hardware.  You would probably get worse reception phone to phone than you would get phone to tower, since the towers can have more powerful radios and antennas than the individual phones. You might get longer range than with wi-fi, but you would probably have to contend with interference from the cell system operating on the band it thinks is reserved just for it.  The Bitcoin protocol is not the right flavor of crypto-decentralization to use for routing in a mesh network. All its messages are propagated by flooding: everyone knows everything and tells all their neighbors. There are more appropriate routing algorithms, though (maybe cjdns, or something based on one of the wi-fi mesh proposals. Anything that's actually a routing algorithm would do.)  As old mobile phones with nothing to do proliferate, people are going to be looking for something to do with them, so interest might pick up. But I'm not sure you'd get a global darknet even with an easy-to-use installer. You'd still need to have multiple people with compatible devices within radio range of each other (although the radio range is longer), and you'd need to convince people to wipe whatever software they had and install this new thing, and (most importantly) once people set it up you'd need to provide them something interesting to do with it that isn't ""send messages to other people who also set this up""."
darknetplan,1w3g6d,interfect,2,Sat Jan 25 06:24:22 2014 UTC,Cell radios are generally not similr enough in given devices to realistically write new firmware for even a handful of different devices. Plus they usually have a realtime microkernel and other subsystems built in to the radio that make them even more complicated than a wifi radio.  Wifi is what you want.
darknetplan,1w3g6d,dicknuckle,2,Sat Jan 25 09:53:58 2014 UTC,The frequencies that phones operate on are licensed exclusively to the phone company. It's not like wifi where it's open to anyone to use. So it would definitely be illegal. That's a shame because the cell radio is higher power and it can go much much farther.  The other issue is that the firmware and chip is of course totally proprietary. I'm surprised people are able to flash their own firmware on these chips to control them. Maybe they've got leaked documents and code?

darknetplan,1vq87d,mahalo1984,9,Tue Jan 21 05:14:43 2014 UTC,"Well, there are really two different answers to your question, depending on what you mean.  If you are referring to the node itself, pretty much anything that can run Linux or OpenWRT can run CJDNS. For particularly low performance devices, however (including most common consumer routers and inexpensive development boards like the Raspberry Pi), throughput can suffer. The cheapest device that I have managed to get throughput I find acceptable on is a $45 BeagleBone Black, and that's with some additional effort made to optimize NaCl (the cryptographic libraries used by CJDNS) for it's particular ARM chip. Others have been perfectly happy with a $35 Raspberry Pi or even their existing OpenWRT compatible wireless router.  If you are referring to the wireless part, i.e. a radio and antenna, then you have two basic options: one that is either built-in to your hardware of choice or connected as a peripheral (likely via USB), or a separate network device that connects to your node and acts as a ""wireless bridge"" (likely via ethernet). The first option can be more limiting then the second, but the second option will likely be a bit more expensive. I recommend that in either case you have a radio with an external antenna connector so that you can get the best antenna for whatever your particular situation is.  Personally, I already have a home server that is always on and is already on CJDNS, so I am planning to connect a Ubiquiti Bullet with a 9dbi omni antenna to it via ethernet and configure the Bullet to act as a simple wireless bridge and only pass CJDNS traffic on the wireless interface. That way, I can run just an ethernet cable (the Bullet is PoE powered) up to it and mount it up high (perhaps up on the roof). It will be configured for a simple ad-hoc wireless network called ""Hyperboria"". I don't expect anyone to connect to it right away... but hey, gotta start somewhere, right?  EDIT: Spelling correction."

darknetplan,1vq87d,IWillNotBeBroken,7,Tue Jan 21 22:23:07 2014 UTC,"We don't control where our words go in the USA. (And in many other places, so don't get too comfy there in Germany) It all goes through the NSA, right? Wherever it goes, you have no say in it. So instead of trusting the strange men in suits who show up at your door and call themselves an ISP, you can just connect your computer to your neighbors instead. That's what Project Meshnet is about. You connect to your neighbors, they connect to their neighbors, and eventually we can all computer w/ each other without needing a big telecom corporation to allow us to do so. Think of it like cell phones, except the phones talk with each other, instead of reporting to the cellular overlords and asking them to talk with your friends.  CJDNS is a fun protocol that can help these neighbor-to-neighbor meshnets work. It's a way for you to announce how to find your computer. You say ""hey, I'm over here!"" and then people can send their packets to you. Emails, images, movies, blueprints, whatever. Of course there's going to be someone out there shouting ""no, I'm over here!"" to try to steal your packets, but thanks to cryptographic signatures anyone can tell that your announcement is the real one. That's pretty much what cjdns does. It finds ways (routes) for people to talk with each other, even if they're separated by many neighbors, and it uses digital signatures and end-to-end encryption to ensure that those routes are accurate and secure.  CJDNS is a ""layer 3"" protocol and that means it's really low level. You can do CJDNS by contacting your peers using UDP, but that assumes you have UDP, and an IP address granted to you by big telecom. But since CJDNS is so low level, you can also use it perfectly fine over just a wire connecting two computers together. In fact some have pointed parabolic dishes at each other and used radio waves to do CJDNS! No ISP, no government, no Ma Bell involved.  Project Meshnet is about meshnets in general, but the current push is to use CJDNS to build robust networks of neighbors, and networks of communities, and cities, states, nations, and the whole world. There are other protocols to meshnet over with varying small scale uses, but CJDNS promises to be a universal solution even over great distances and many intermediary hops.  Ma Bell can still stick around if they like, providing large scale long distance communication routes. What those at Project Meshnet want to ensure is that there's always an option besides Ma Bell, when they fail, or when they get nasty, or when they try to steal your packets."

darknetplan,1vljv9,barefootsanders,5,Sun Jan 19 16:10:56 2014 UTC,"The problem you are going to have is the max power output allowable for WiFi. Even with high gain, an omni antenna is going to evenly distribute your energy, and you don't have much to distribute.  To make a network of that size you will really need to do a mesh with multiple repeater nodes."
darknetplan,1vljv9,jecxjo,4,Sun Jan 19 16:38:24 2014 UTC,"Right, good point.  Would it be possible to give the illusion of am omni through the use of a few of these, http://www.ubnt.com/airmax#bulletm, and a few sector antennas?  I'm thinking we'd have some interference to deal with.  Also, I'm not sure how a given client would be able to seamlessly transition from one AP to another."
darknetplan,1vljv9,waaghals,2,Sun Jan 19 16:56:29 2014 UTC,"This transitioning is called roaming, as long as the SSID is the same the client will chose the strongest signal. Have each AP on a different channel. (As long as the same channel doesn't overlap you're fine)."
darknetplan,1vljv9,panjadotme,6,Sun Jan 19 17:59:39 2014 UTC,It's called handoff or handover :p roaming would indicate switching between a different mobile carrier or network altogether. Sorry for being pedantic. :)
darknetplan,1vljv9,jecxjo,1 point,Sun Jan 19 20:11:28 2014 UTC,"I'm sure something like that would work. What you'd be doing is setting up a set of directional antennas to set up the grid and at each node setup a local omni. 802.11 is set up for roaming, switching from AP to AP so there shouldn't be an issue.  Think of this like a Mobil phone network. You'll create a set of cells with backhauls linking them all. As the user roams to another cell the internal routing control of the radio system will handle everything.  My suggestion is calling up their sales number and go through the layout of your town, any type of oddities you can think of, requirements you have, etc. They will be able to tell you exactly what you need to be buying."

darknetplan,1vljv9,Dmelvin,1 point,Sun Jan 19 23:44:48 2014 UTC,"How did Google say they do it with the Loons? Isn't that just regular Wi-Fi they are extending?  Found a little something on Wikipedia:   Currently, the balloons communicate using unlicensed 2.4 and 5.8 GHz ISM bands,[9] and Google claims that the setup allows it to deliver ""speeds comparable to 3G"" to users.  Each balloon provides Internet service in a 20 km (12 mi) radius covering an area of about 1,256 km2 (485 sq mi).   I guess the transmission can work better if you do it from the air, rather than from the ground? The longest-range on-the-ground Wi-Fi I've heard of is Flutter(1 km)."
darknetplan,1vljv9,jecxjo,2,Mon Jan 20 03:52:02 2014 UTC,"Wi-Fi is a broad term.  Technically anything that uses air as the media of transport is ""Wi-Fi""    More than likely.   Google is using 5.8 as their backhaul that connects back to a central tower, and then transmitting/receiving in 2.4 for the end user's device.   This is the same design I have for my remote AP's.   I connect back to my house with a 5.8 connection, and then have a 2.4 radio that my devices connect to.   I have a 5.8 sector on my house that the backhaul radios connect to.  Yes, transmitting from the air to the ground is better than ground to ground.   Much less can get in the way in the way of trees, buildings, and other obstructions.    In reality, if you have line of site, you can build a 5.8 connection at 10km + that will give you good throughput, and can be done fairly cheaply (couple hundred bucks).   Once you have the radio and sector pointing that direction, you can connect other radios to that sector as long as they're within the spread of the antenna.    This is the entire premise of WISP.    900Mhz, 2.4Ghz, and 5.8Ghz can be used without any licensing.   I like 5.8 if there is line of site, because there isn't much for noise, and it offers the highest link speeds."

darknetplan,1vljv9,ModernRonin,1 point,Mon Jan 20 17:27:00 2014 UTC,"It depends on how large of an area.   You can also daisy chain remote sites if needed.     I.E.  I have a 5km shot from my house to a remote AP (remote AP 1), but I have another remote AP that does not have line of site from my house (remote AP 2).  I can then use another 5.8 (or 2.4, or 900Mhz) radio, and shoot the signal down range from remote AP 1, to remote AP 2.   The thing that you have to be mindful of here is interfering with yourself, however there are different channels you can use to combat this issue.    Assuming that you're using MIMO radios (I really like ubiquiti radios, they are dual polarity and allow duplex traffic.)  You don't need to worry about losing speed along your link like you would if you were just using standard access points as repeaters."
darknetplan,1vljv9,tacticaltaco,1 point,Mon Jan 20 20:07:47 2014 UTC,"I guess the transmission can work better if you do it from the air, rather than from the ground?   There is a saying in radio: ""Height makes might."" Sure you can cover a broad area by transmitting from high up, but that's not the only parameter that matters. No wireless hardware in production is going to be able to handle thousands or tens of thousands of connections coming from a 12 mile area. Not only that, it's highly unlikely that any station on the ground is going to have the power or proper antenna to reach the balloon.  The FCC would certainly have something to say about such an operation as well. 802.11a interferes with the weather radar deployed around the nations airports, which is why 802.11h (DFS) was created. The FCC regularly warn (and occasionally cite) 5GHz users for causing interference."
darknetplan,1vljv9,eviltwinkie,2,Fri Jan 24 09:33:59 2014 UTC,"The closest thing you'll find is a collinear type antenna. This squashes the gain outward, radially. E.g. Z2400EL here.  Great if your remote station is far away from, and at the same elevation as, the antenna. Crap otherwise. There's also probably some other engineering tradeoff that makes collinears suck, I just don't know what it is off the top of my head.  Cell towers divide the circle surrounding them into sectors, usually three or four, and then use three or four 120 or 90 degree antennas to cover the entire area. There is almost certainly a reason they do this. If a collinear was the best way, cell towers would use collinears."
darknetplan,1vljv9,tacticaltaco,2,Sun Jan 19 16:54:36 2014 UTC,"Everyone has solid suggestions so far. Another thing to check out are sector antennas (what cell towers use). You'll want to check out what gear WISPs like to use, they have this exact sort of setup down pat."

darknetplan,1vljv9,tacticaltaco,2,Sun Jan 19 23:51:04 2014 UTC,"Most I've seen operate in the ISM bands. 900, 2.4 and 5.8. Things are usually done on a shoestring budget and licenses aren't a part of that."
darknetplan,1vljv9,eviltwinkie,2,Mon Jan 20 02:44:17 2014 UTC,Don't think that's a real wisp. Maybe a mom and pop shop sure I could see that. Problem is that those bands are so congested with noise its very difficult to get decent range. Also the cost of tower leasing or erecting your own is pretty high.  So I could see this maybe in rural merica...but def not happening in any medium density areas.
darknetplan,1vljv9,tacticaltaco,2,Mon Jan 20 05:34:29 2014 UTC,"Tower costs and bandwidth is where most of the cost is. They generally get creative in rural areas and can rent space on a silo or if its hilly buddy up with whoever owns the tallest plot.  Again, research how these WISPs operate and setup links. Customer links are often over a mile or two (sometimes 5 or more). Backhaul links can easily go over 10 miles. Don't discount what they do because its mom and pop or ISM. It's the exact sort of thing that should (and could) be emulated by a meshnet.  Populated areas might have more trouble but that just means pick the cleanest band and turn down the power. I live in a fairly populated area and the 900MHz and 5.8GHz bands are empty. Noise floor around -100 on 900 and 5.8 is even better.  Edit: small towers aren't as hard as you think. You can easily get a 50' mast and some guy wires for under $300. Easily enough to hold a few data radios and the appropriate antennas."
darknetplan,1vljv9,eviltwinkie,2,Mon Jan 20 14:35:33 2014 UTC,"I'm not completely discounting the theory. I am discounting the practice.   I totally agree with everything you said in theory. What I am saying is when you actually go and deploy it...the reality of the situation is rarely as easy as the theory predicted.   I have practical real world experience doing just that type of thing and I can tell you firsthand it simply is never that easy. I would even go as far as to say this is why no practical examples of it exists. If it did we could easily reference an example install. But outside of hobby meshnets, and educational type deployments, it does not exist. The prior two do because its funded and not for profit with community supported repeater locations.   The second you get a wisp model of for profit...its just not gonna happen. And the equipment costs are generally too high for most small community supported installations. Even finding patches of land to erect a tower not big enough to piss off the local zoning people with enough proximity to each other is hard. And I would argue its much more expensive still because you need lightning suppression and liability coverage.   Rural federal grants even exist for this type of thing...but its so impractical with off the shelf hardware that no one has done it...else we would see it all over the place.  Edit: Mas words."
darknetplan,1vljv9,tacticaltaco,1 point,Mon Jan 20 14:48:05 2014 UTC,"I agree, mesh WISPs don't exist. A lot of a the routing (and radio) tech isn't there yet. It takes a lot of careful orchestration to get a mesh setup.  That said, there are tons of for-profit WISPs out there (see here). They're typically in areas where no real (DSL or Cable) broadband options exist. They are not cost effective enough to edge out actual DSL/Cable offerings which is why we don't see them in the city. Yes, this doesn't help my arguments but it's the truth. The fact WISPs can make any economic sense in the first place gives me hope though.  I see half baked and well meaning (but ineffective) ideas come along all the damn time. People then come along and shoot the idea down. Nothing gets accomplished. Rinse, repeat. It's a rut everyone is stuck in.  What I'm suggesting isn't the holy grail of meshnet. It's not going to service every single person in a city (nothing can; there just isn't enough spectrum). What it can do is connect a handful of people together and show an example of what can be done."
darknetplan,1vljv9,eviltwinkie,2,Mon Jan 20 15:46:06 2014 UTC,"But again the problem is backhaul, node density, costs of hardware, and costs of land.  The OP started with...I want to use a single omni and radio for 10 miles...which is ridiculous.   At least in this thread of ours we are covering a practical argument. Those wisps listed also more than likely have a licensed backhaul before the last mile which would go into the ISM band. Lots of reasons exist for this one of which again at long ranges the ISM band is impractical due to noise.   Also just because you don't see the noise via 802.11 does not mean it isnt there. You use a spectrum analyzer to see it. Tons of junk is already there, most people simply do not know it is because they dont tune into the actual band and listen to all the analog noise."
darknetplan,1vljv9,trylleklovn,1 point,Mon Jan 20 15:55:34 2014 UTC,"But again the problem is backhaul, node density, costs of hardware, and costs of land.   There's the meat and potatoes of it all. I've always imagined the mesh serving as the medium range backhaul. Someone in a neighborhood sets up a small mast with whatever backhaul radio there is (to link up with masts in other neighborhoods). From there you use some last mile equipment to serve individual houses in the neighborhood. I think you can manage that without dipping in to licensed bands. Cost is still an issue but I think any well organized friendly neighborhood that can put on a block party could pull off funding a mesh (if they want it). Thinking about it, the evil as hell HOAs might be just the right organization to set those up.  The long range back haul between cities is the toughest problem. I can see where licensed spectrum might be the solution. It would take multiple hops/nodes to go over 100 miles. However I don't think any free (libre) mesh can exist in licensed bands. The whole point is to avoid the influence and censorship of the government (or corporations).  Good point on the noise. I've been able to check out 900 with my cheap rtl-sdr but I'm still waiting on my HackRF to check out 2.4 and 5.8. Unfortunately, I can't afford a FieldFox."

darknetplan,1vj7fu,ZenoArrow,5,Sat Jan 18 17:34:57 2014 UTC,What are the power and bandwidth limits of those unlicensed bands? Is there enough room for data? I know the 433 one is probably smack in the middle of one of the amateur radio bands.
darknetplan,1vj7fu,tacticaltaco,6,Sat Jan 18 19:05:58 2014 UTC,"There's always enough room for data, the question is how much."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,freefm,2,Sat Jan 18 19:16:42 2014 UTC,"It's a good question, and I'm not sure, but it's worth pointing out that bands around 800mhz have been approved for wireless Internet use by the European Union (similar to the 900mhz bands in the US). These bands are licensed, and are undoubtedly broadcasting on higher power and larger frequency ranges than the unlicensed bands, but it does show it's possible to get decent throughput on such frequencies. I am not expecting fast speeds, dial up Internet speeds would be fine considering the equipment cost is practically nothing."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,cambaio,2,Sat Jan 18 21:20:39 2014 UTC,"800MHz is reserved for LTE. Check LTE bands at http://www.radio-electronics.com/info/cellulartelecomms/lte-long-term-evolution/lte-frequency-spectrum.php  Also, usually licensing a link can be cost prohibitive, and it's a annual fee."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,autowikibot,4,Sat Jan 18 22:31:59 2014 UTC,"I know it's licensed for LTE, my point was that similar bands are used for mobile Internet (LTE being one example). The 868mhz band (a.k.a. Channel 70) is still unlicensed in the UK."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,tacticaltaco,2,Sat Jan 18 23:01:56 2014 UTC,"Okay, have found some more information on this. Usage of the 868 MHz bands for data is covered by IEEE 802.15.4. Maximum data throughput with the imposed limitations is 250kbit/s over range of 10m, which is fine for terraced housing. Can read more here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_802.15.4"
darknetplan,1vj7fu,tacticaltaco,2,Sun Jan 19 11:17:24 2014 UTC,"Here's a bit from linked Wikipedia article about IEEE 802.15.4 :      IEEE 802.15.4 is a standard which specifies the physical layer and media access control for low-rate wireless personal area networks (LR-WPANs). It is maintained by the IEEE 802.15 working group. It is the basis for the ZigBee, ISA100.11a, WirelessHART, and MiWi specifications, each of which further extends the standard by developing the upper layers which are not defined in IEEE 802.15.4. Alternatively, it can be used with 6LoWPAN and standard Internet protocols to build a wireless embedded Internet.     Picture  image source | about | /u/ZenoArrow can reply with 'delete'.

darknetplan,1vj7fu,cambaio,1 point,Sun Jan 19 15:20:12 2014 UTC,"It is too slow for modern browsing habits, but perhaps could be used for communicating between communities (uncensored public discussion, knowledge sharing, etc...). In some ways the lack of bandwidth becomes a bonus in the sense that it'll avoid needing as much policing of questionable pornographic content. Plus, the cost is very low, antennas already installed, Zigbee module around £15 (works on appropriate frequency, has built-in encryption), wouldn't cost much more to hook into existing home wireless infrastructure. Perhaps this project will make more sense once the majority get their TV content from the web."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,cambaio,1 point,Sun Jan 19 15:59:04 2014 UTC,"I think you're right in that any near term meshnet will have to be text only (or at least fewer pictures) but 250Kbps is still pretty slow even for text, especially when you have to handle other users traffic. There are higher bandwidth radios out there that operate in license free bands (like the 900MHz band available in the US). They will just cost more.  You also need to consider power output. I know nicer XBEE units can do 100mW but that will only get you so far."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,GratefulTony,1 point,Sun Jan 19 17:07:00 2014 UTC,"True, it would be a stretch even with text.  Regarding power output, 100mW is fine, could be run off solar with battery backup, plus the sleep modes on Zigbee units are pretty good (can go to sleep in < 30ms, 800nA possible in deep sleep, e.g.  http://www.telegesis.com/product_range_overview/etrx3_zigbee_module.htm ).  If you were specifying a radio mesh without restriction on existing antennas, personally I'd skip the 900MHz band and go straight for the 60GHz band, that has the most potential so long as you can maintain line of sight between the antennas (mostly straightforward on rooftops). Dreaming out loud, you could couple this with fibre installed on rooftops too, the cost of fibre isn't the major expense, it's the installation cost, which it's possible to dramatically reduce. The ideas I was putting forward were focused around reusing existing infrastructure purely for cost and ease of rollout, just testing the water to see what's possible."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,na85,1 point,Sun Jan 19 18:22:53 2014 UTC,"Good points. I will say, any mesh is better than no mesh. I've been toying around with a lot of 900 MHz gear lately for not quite LOS links. I'd really like to be using 5.8GHz gear but proper LOS is hard to do when your aren't allowed on the roof of an apartment."

darknetplan,1vj7fu,jricher42,1 point,Sat Jan 18 22:24:45 2014 UTC,"This shouldn't be an issue... the feed impedance difference between 50 and 75 Ohm will be small compared to the feed impedance difference due to operating the aerial out of its designed frequency band. Also, using a matching transformer can work around this. The result of an impedance mismatch is something called SWR-- where essentially a percentage of the signal gets reflected back down the feedline, pingponging between the tx amp and the antenna, incurring line losses until the ""remainder"" dies out... So to speak..."
darknetplan,1vj7fu,jricher42,1 point,Sat Jan 18 22:25:38 2014 UTC,"Just done some digging around, found out there are TV aerials on the UK market that cover the needed bands, such as this one (price is cheap too)... http://www.conrad-electronic.co.uk/ce/en/product/940893/Wittenberg-Antennen-P3235-101361-DVB-T-Digital-TV-Aerial-Frequency-range174-890-MHz-AmplificationPassive  Further questions now emerge... 1. Is there an easy way to test the frequency range of an external antenna through the aerial cable? 2. How directional are standard TV aerials designed to be (this is too hard to answer quantitatively, qualitatively is fine for now)? 3. Assuming the answer to question 2 is ""very directional"" or similar, is it possible to use these antennas in a less directional way (assuming this will also imply a decrease in signal strength)?"

darknetplan,1vj7fu,jricher42,3,Sat Jan 18 19:31:59 2014 UTC,You'll need a VSWR meter and an antenna analyzer. Check out what amateur radio enthusiasts use since it will be inexpensive. There's professional engineering gear out there but it can cost as much as a house.
darknetplan,1vj7fu,jricher42,1 point,Sat Jan 18 19:22:02 2014 UTC,"Thanks for the tips tacticaltaco. Looks like roughly £20 for a low end VSWR meter and about £200 for the antenna analyser, not too bad."

At any rate the bitcoin protocol is terrible at being a darknet base since by definition it records every single transaction as part of a public record. Call me paranoid but giving an adversary a full record of every network transaction ever completely defeats the point of anonymity even if the conversation is encrypted.
darknetplan,1vdbco,monochr,6,Thu Jan 16 20:39:13 2014 UTC,"Bandwidth routing would be on the mining side of the coin. That part is 100% anonymous.  Only if you want spend the coins on public goods and services does it enter the public ledger in an identifiable way.  The standard doesn't exist yet, but likely it would be something like this: You could share your home bandwidth to get a few anonymous coins. Then you could use those anonymous coins to use the bandwidth of the network. Only if you wanted to convert your coins to US dollars or something from Overstock.com would your identity actually be attached to anything."
darknetplan,1vdbco,vacuu,9,Thu Jan 16 21:28:38 2014 UTC,"Lets say user Z mines coin x. So far so anonymous. They then use coin x to buy bandwidth from users A, B and C. That is logged forever as part of the public record. Now suppose C gets compromised and the adversary finds out Z is a target of interest. They now know to go after A and B too because it's in the public record and everything Z did can now be traced back to them.  This is a terrible idea for a darknet that promises anonymity. The only people who would be safe in such a case are those who don't need the anonymity anyway. Might be great for a cheating husband, not so great if you happen to live in China or Syria."
darknetplan,1vdbco,monochr,2,Thu Jan 16 21:47:47 2014 UTC,"While I agree that this should be fine in theory, I suspect it wouldn't be too hard to correlate other activity and link a wallet to an identity (or list of potential identities). If you had a big supercomputer crunching data (like the NSA does) you could probably eliminate suspected owners of various wallets over time and also coordinate which wallets are likely owned by the same person.  I seem to recall hearing that the NSA can perform similar correlations with burner phones. Never underestimate meta-data and other factors. Just because the transaction has no address or name attached doesn't mean they can't figure out who you are if they cross-reference it with other sources."

As soon as I can directly ping a known IP (or equivalent) to let them know my current IP (or equivalent) without forwarding or servers or middlemen, the problem absolutely solves itself. The 'market' works out the rest.   Mark my words. Once someone works out how to directly send messages p2p from any device, the whole problem vanishes.

darknetplan,1vdbco,therealxris,2,Fri Jan 17 09:31:14 2014 UTC,"Yes, though those tools could be used to enhance the signal range.  I think a good baseline is: Out of the box a user can share his or her hash/IP/QR code with another phone, and those phones can then directly communicate.  From there you can certainly employ routing, peer chains and distributed address tables etc in order for peers to find one another in a complex network.  But before any of the other goals can be achieved, you should be able to send a signal directly between two phones or two computers without configuration, and regardless of what network you happen to be connected to that particular day.  As soon as there's any router config required the whole system falls down and centralisation re-emerges."

Even if you could use an entire bands worth of bandwidth, the deterioration over that distance would make decoding a pain.  If you want long range, take a page from satellite communications. Pick a high-ish frequency (UHF or higher), give yourself LOS (towers, high altitude balloons, actual satellites, maybe UAVs) and a few watts of power. Using that you can get yourself a really long link with some usable bandwidth.  edit: I am being serious. Toss some 1 watt 900MHz radios in a UAV 400' in the air and you might be able to do a reasonable mesh. Perhaps use a tethered quadcopter (powered from the ground) and you'll have semi-portable towers that can be setup fairly easily.  double edit: For those not interested in quadcopters, check out MFJ's fiberglass masts. They can do ~33 feet without guy wires while supporting a decent sized panel antenna. You won't go 100km but with the right gear (and terrain) you might go 10km which is still useful."

darknetplan,1uvsxj,tacticaltaco,2,Sat Jan 11 02:21:21 2014 UTC,I don't know of any multicopters that can carry more than a few kilograms of payload. You're going to need a pretty light wire.

The hard part is they drift pretty far pretty quick and payload recovery. You could have the payload be a small glider but that's a small feat and might be frowned upon by the FAA (although it has been done).

There's a few companies out there doing research on long duration UAV/Balloon flights to act as cheap satellites of sorts.  Titan Aerospace has some interesting designs.  Long range field communications is one of my interest areas.  I did some stuff in the Navy and enjoyed it a lot so I keep up to date with things.
darknetplan,1uvsxj,wavecross,2,Fri Jan 10 21:08:43 2014 UTC,What about a tethered aerostat/weather balloon/blimp?
darknetplan,1uvsxj,tacticaltaco,2,Sat Jan 11 03:46:31 2014 UTC,"Mentioned it in another reply. They're an alright short term solution (maybe for an event or emergency use) but they eventually leak and need more lifting gas (which isn't cheap or easy to get). Vinyl balloons (you see them at car dealerships) are the most durable. In general though they don't handle wind very well and will move around a lot (more wind and they just get closer to the ground). Their unpredictability makes pointing directional antennas at them difficult.  I mentioned a lot of ""off the wall"" ideas but I think simple (and boring) masts on top of hills will be the backbone of any future meshnet. They're simple, low maintenance and let you focus on the network and radio link, not keeping a balloon/UAV/quadcopter in the air. I've been tinkering with balloons and UAVs (and a friend has a tethered quad) but my big fiberglass mast is the best for tossing radios up in the air and experimenting."
darknetplan,1uvsxj,wavecross,2,Sat Jan 11 04:07:57 2014 UTC,Would it be practical to hijack existing cell towers with bootleg equipment?
darknetplan,1uvsxj,tacticaltaco,2,Sat Jan 11 12:09:50 2014 UTC,Probably not. If the tower were abandoned and not in use it might be worth a shot (but good luck climbing an unmaintained tower). A tower in active use will notice bootleg equipment relatively quickly. Even if they don't a tower has a certain amount of spectrum management going on to keep people from trampling over each other. There's a decent chance the standard low power gear most of us can get our hands on (and afford) would simply get desensed to hell and back with all the power from other equipment.  On the other hand putting your own tower up isn't too hard. All you need is the zoning for the location to be proper. Towers under 200 feet tall don't need to be registered and don't require safety lights (although many still do). You'll see most cell towers are 198 feet tall for that reason.

If you can get line of sight and are high enough to get reasonably clear fresnel zones you can generally make a link.  Outside of horrendously slow ham gear Harris makes the best HF data radio.  It can do 120kbps on wideband modes that violate most regulations outside of military use.  It can be yours for the low price of $30,000 each.   If you try it with an amateur radio license then you're limited to 300 baud.  The good news is you can put out 1kw of power so it'll go quite  ways. You also can't encrypt anything outside of very specific circumstances which is basically only satellite control signals.  You also need to understand that the any HF link won't be reliable as propagation conditions change all the time no matter what gear you use.    The only unlicensed HF spectrum is CB.

darknetplan,1uvsxj,epSos-DE,4,Fri Jan 10 20:37:19 2014 UTC,"Probably 2.4Ghz and/or 5Ghz.  Generally, above HF, lower frequencies mean longer range, and higher mean shorter. On the other hand, the unlicensed bands below 2.4Ghz (900Mhz and below) generally do not support sufficient throughput for that sort of thing. The bands are too narrow and too noisy.  2.4Ghz is probably the lowest and longest range band you can get reasonably sufficient throughput on, with 5Ghz offering even better throughput at the cost of a reasonable amount of range if you can get away with it.

darknetplan,1uhnde,sonicSkis,5,Mon Jan 6 00:43:20 2014 UTC,"That's correct, although shorter wavelength does not necessarily translate to shorter range.

Take something like fiber, where there are windows of low dispersion and attenuation that are used to maximize range... using a longer wavelength will not result in a longer range than what you'd get in one of the windows.  Or look at gamma rays as an example of something that can sometimes penetrate better than RF signals of longer wavelength.

X-band also had the best communications gear at the time (http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/PerformMetrics/stairstep.pdf)  The data rate leaves much to be desired (160/1400bps).

Friss free space pathloss formula assumes antennas of fixed gain and not fixed size, which has lead to the widespread confusion that free space has a ""pathloss"". It's directly related to people not taking into account that the antennas have to be bigger at lower frequencies and therefore they have a larger aperture."
darknetplan,1uhnde,j1ggy,1 point,Mon Jan 6 04:01:20 2014 UTC,antennas of the same size generally have higher gains at higher frequencies   Do you mean aperture efficiency?
darknetplan,1uhnde,vacuu,0,Mon Jan 6 06:17:49 2014 UTC,"They chose those frequencies at the time because they were out of range of anything in use. To go higher, they would have needed a higher powered transmitter on the spacecraft itself, which while unnecessary was not feasible.   The primary advantage of lower frequencies, however, is that lower-frequency radio signals propagate farther in the environment. At the lowest end are systems to communicate with submarines operating in the extremely low frequency (ELF) band which ranges from 3 Hz to 300 Hz. Wavelengths at those frequencies are thousands of kilometers long, so antennas, which have to be huge, are a slight challenge.  In contrast, mobile communications systems used globally have frequencies much higher than this, ranging from 450 MHz to 2500 GHz, with most systems in the U.S. operating at either 850 MHz (cellular band) or 1900 MHz (Personal Communications Systems – PCS) band. In trying to cover an area with the minimum number of sites, using 1900 MHz takes somewhere between 2 to 4 times as many sites as 850 MHz.   http://www.hightechforum.org/low-versus-high-radio-spectrum/"

Before you get too excited about the potential of 60GHz networks, you should be aware of their Achilles' heel: range. A 60GHz signal can’t easily penetrate walls. Also, oxygen molecules begin to absorb electromagnetic energy at this frequency; that’s why existing WirelessHD devices, as well as Dell’s WiGig dock, are designed to operate in the same room.   http://www.pcworld.com/article/2030041/meet-60ghz-wi-fi-the-insanely-fast-future-of-wireless-networking.html"

We will migrate away for comforts' sake as weather allows, but we will mostly remain within +/- 10 degrees of latitude for safety.  The substrate, however, couples buoyancy with active pneumatic stabilization: it uses compressed air in order to maintain a level surface despite wave action and can even harvest wave energy.  Moreover, we will be fostering artificial coral reef pylons in concentric circles around the platform.  These will absorb wave energy before it reaches the platform, providing a safe harbor even in adverse weather."

This will be the outer haul of the ship. Place the lattice in sea water and run a current through it. This will start pulling minerals out of the sea water and collecting them on the lattice, the build up will grow and hopefully create a strong outer haul that can be repaired using sea water instead of being worn down by it.  This is a basic explanation, there might be an additive one might need to put in the water near the lattice to get the desired material, and I'm not fully clear on how strong the material would be."

Either way its privcy-by-policy, as opposed to privacy-by-design, which is what mesh-networking technologies like cjdns could provide.

IANAL, but the Fourth Amendment appears to only restrict what the government can do.   The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.   Under the Fourth Amendment, you need a warrant or probable cause before search or seizure.  Judge Freisler Pauley ruled that the Fourth Amendment doesn't apply to third parties, who can conduct all the search and seizure they want.  As for the legality of meshnets, a big factor of their legality would be why they're built as they're built.  In the early 2000s, a major part of the downfall of Napster and the like was because the defendants couldn't show that the software had any real use besides piracy.  They could show some small use of sharing public domain material like free software.  But because the overwhelming use was related to piracy, and because they couldn't show that the software wasn't designed with piracy as its primary purpose, it looked to the judges like Napster existed to disobey copyright and could be outlawed.  However, a meshnet does have a variety of uses.  Anonymity is a feature, and isn't technically illegal yet (though it could be).  But (it seems to me) that a more interesting feature of a meshnet is its cost --- you can host content on (for example) FreeNet for nothing, without having to buy a web server.  Here are these destitute children making web pages for free, sharing their life stories with the world.  Do you want to rule against the meshnet, and crush their dreams?"

darknetplan,1tu2pv,kodemage,5,Sat Dec 28 04:34:45 2013 UTC,"ECC in itself is not known to be compromised. Certain widely used variations (promoted by the NIST standards) had certain parameters set that made them more easily cracked by the NSA.   This article from '07 by Bruce Schneier explains the gist of the vulnerability quite well:   This is how it works: There are a bunch of constants -- fixed numbers -- in the standard used to define the algorithm's elliptic curve. These constants are listed in Appendix A of the NIST publication, but nowhere is it explained where they came from.  What Shumow and Ferguson showed is that these numbers have a relationship with a second, secret set of numbers that can act as a kind of skeleton key. If you know the secret numbers, you can predict the output of the random-number generator after collecting just 32 bytes of its output. To put that in real terms, you only need to monitor one TLS internet encryption connection in order to crack the security of that protocol. If you know the secret numbers, you can completely break any instantiation of Dual_EC_DRBG.  The researchers don't know what the secret numbers are. But because of the way the algorithm works, the person who produced the constants might know; he had the mathematical opportunity to produce the constants and the secret numbers in tandem.   The rest of the article is a bit outdated. Now it's become rather clear that the NSA does have the skeleton key."

darknetplan,1t307y,rubygeek,7,Tue Dec 17 12:48:30 2013 UTC,I didn't mean using consumer grade wifi but rather some infrastructure grade microwave links (like those you see attached to GSM towers) Since these are point-to-point only they do not need to adhere to the wifi specification and usually operate at much higher frequencies (Ku band 12 to 18 GHz) This sort of hardware is used for backhaul  networking and is available commercially.

That way you create manageable sub-goals that people can try to get interest for locally.

A major part of setting a goal like this would be to demonstrate that long distance links ""outside"" of the regular net are possible. Then you can worry about fast/efficient/resilient.  Consider that the first international links for the ARPAnet were slower than a typical dialup modem these days (links to NORSAR - a seismic array in Norway important for NATO detection of Soviet nuclear tests - and to the UK).  EDIT: The first NORSAR link was a 2400kbps link via cable to a satellite uplink in Sweden; it was upgraded in 1973 with 9600kbps links to Virginia and London, creating the first ""proper"" international ARPAnet links."

Communication is encrypted by default and there is no central authority validating those encryption keys (validation if they are who they say they are), which could be compromised.  So for experts to read into your data the would have to crack it 'manually', which takes ages.   Or is there some reason to believe that the very foundation of the current internet is insecure and therefore unable to ever attain the security ideals of DarkNet.     This! SSL as your example need a handful of trusted systems to verify the authenticity of the response. These are hard coded in your browser. If one of them gets compromised keys could be forged and makes it possible to steal a servers 'identity'. (Google DigiNotar)    No the hosts themselves are just as vulnerable as the where before.   DarkNetPlan aka ProjectMeshnet which uses Cjdns doesn't provide anonymity. It provides real pseudonymity. The difference is that you are still identifiable with your IP as you are the only one who can use that IP. However there isn't any way to connect that to you personal info.

Assume one company decided to invest a few hundred million dollars to deploy enough mesh networks all across the country, eventually linking all existing MeshNetworks together. If it turned out that this one firm spent enough money to own (and control) 95% of the Mesh hardware, would that compromise the integrity of the network?  Hypothetically, if given full compliance from every relevant player, could the current internet be converted to a super mesh-net through just software. Or is the existing hardware fundamentally incompatible for this effort.    Thanks again."

This creates a single point of failure. If someone brings the company down it takes the Internet with it. 3. The current internet is already a mesh network. On hardware level things are good. It is the protocols which we need to replace/improve.  ProjectMeshnet would like to see users providing the hardware levels of it as well, cheapest/fastest and easiest way now is wireless. But is isn't required and anything cables would be better."

Also, as a developing nation, we are seeing a rapid growth in tech industry with planned obsolescence and created so much e-waste. In a few weeks of volunteering at the local recycling center , ive collected 7 routers which i had flashed dd-wrt and 3-5 workable pc's that i'm yet to put together as a simple terminal or server. At the same time, i am convinced that a doing techno-diy-hardware hacks are way better then going to the shopping gallery with no idea (or cash) what to buy. The abundant of resources in terms of hardware plus the sea of knowledge available online on top of direct communication with people with experiences such as redditors seems like an opportunity to do something about shit thats going around. My effort to reach out to the local ngo and youth collectives started to feel like selling an answer to a question that are not being asked, yet.

But if you use the existing network to establish a leased circuit network carrying your own protocol and the traffic encrypted, all they could do is shut it off, they couldn't intercept the traffic in a meaningful way. And shutting it off means you quit paying, which they will not willingly allow."

darknetplan,1shmn5,bobroberts7441,2,Wed Dec 11 00:10:01 2013 UTC,Packet is very slow compared to mostly anything on the consumer level. It'll result in a huge bottleneck.
darknetplan,1shmn5,Gorehog,8,Wed Dec 11 04:59:07 2013 UTC,Of course local rules apply. It could be that you are allowed to place cables in the ground as long as you mention it to you local municipality? Others demand that you are utility company.  However everybody can rent a darkfiber (a unlit fiber dedicated to you) or a single color (wave-length) on a shared fiber. These can run building to building without being connect to the internet.   When ISP or fiber companies place the fiber in the ground the actually put in special tubes which have smaller tubes in them like straws. They blow the fiber through those holes. If these tubes are already in the ground getting a fiber blown through might actually be feasible.   It won't cost million.
darknetplan,1shmn5,waaghals,1 point,Wed Dec 11 12:38:21 2013 UTC,"Depending on where, the cost of laying new cable varies from 20K (like Nevada) to several million dollars per mile (cities)."

He may have chosen to answer in a different fashion then me, in comical form.  It sounds like you have a big idea but lack most of the information to ask to correct questions or understand how networks work.   I’ll try to answer your question.  If it’s your land you can lay fiber anywhere.  There are many small towns that are laying their own fiber and creating a municipality “ISP” but then are getting sued by telecom giants for non-compete.  Even these local ISPs must work with telecom giants to gain access to the internet as we known it.  Someone owns the land, the poles, the lines and the hardware.  To be an ISP you have to bring all these elements together by legal or finical agreements then gain access to the “internet” using telecom giants.  Nobody knows how much that would cost unless working in a very small, local environment.  That’s kind of the whole idea behind CJDNS.  That nobody has to own any of those things.  These same small local ISPs could have a completely disconnected network and create their own, local interent.

Project Meshnet, which many of the people in this subreddit are a part of is aimed at building long term meshnets that will be around for years to come and act as secure, stable networks.  This is done primarily by using an encrypted networking suite called CJDNS ( CJD's Networking Suite) and wireless/wired nodes that many people link into. CJDNS ensures that anything between you and the other computer your connecting to is encrypted so that no one in between can eavesdrop or do Deep Packet Inspection on your connection, and the meshnet nodes transport your traffic so that you can browse the network, download torrents or whatever else you want to do over the network."

I think that’s what you guy are really talking about when it comes to security and ease of setup.  I’m not 100% sure on the difference between the two but I THINK OLSR works with in the common networking protocol, kind of like an add-on.

Also kind of pointless, as the performance you would get would be so poor as to be practically useless for computer networking (Remember the 56k dialup modem days?

You will get vastly better performance, over a longer distance, with far less time and effort and technical expertise required, and completely legally, simply by using the cheap and common equipment that is already designed specifically for what you want to do: 802.11 wifi gear.  You basically just walked past a car lot full of perfectly good cars to a food cart on the corner, and then asked if the food cart could somehow be fitted with a motor and seat and made to transport you along roads to your desired destinations.

darknetplan,1rlrnl,Dmelvin,2,Wed Nov 27 23:15:54 2013 UTC,"Yeah, the Unifi access points are really nice looking and are suppose to have really high transfer rates. But again, it falls onto the ISPs because people cannot connect to the internet with high transfer rates. My knowledge of all this stuff isn't the best. But I was able to get them running nice for a little while. Then everything started to slow down to a crawl just from a bunch of other people.  It also is kinda rough at first to set the Access points up. I had to start over several times. One: I needed software to actually access them that was only on my Laptop, and two: if you have one IP conflict, which somehow we got one from someone's iPad (Apple devices seem to be the problem device on our network.) had duplicated itself on an access point, it had caused the whole wireless network to just go down and no one could get online."

I've had two lines set up with failover, with one entirely dedicated to VoIP, and one for users' traffic, and that worked pretty well. It's also possible to do hash-based or just even-odd load balancing of clients, based on their assigned IP address.  If you have a narrow uplink like those cable connections, and your provider allows ""spoofed"" traffic, you can do some kind of split on the downlink to choose which clients use which outward facing IPs, or just only use the downlink from a single connection, and then round-robin outgoing traffic between the two uplinks, but even then there are still problems, and you still have a 10/1 downlink/uplink ratio (or 5/1 if you're just ignoring the other 50mbit downlink)"

darknetplan,1qv8o8,danry25,2,Mon Nov 18 04:04:55 2013 UTC,"Ahh!  If I knew then, what I know now...    Yes, I would have probably gone with a different Ubiquiti device.  Maybe a RocketM with a grid antenna.  The Bullet M2s don't come in a 900MHz flavour, and I was (perhaps wrongly) betting that I would get better penetration through the trees with that band.  Do you think the 2.4GHz band would have cut through the foliage as well?  Or would the sheer power of the grid antenna have simply made the higher band's lower penetration meaningless?"

darknetplan,1qv8o8,krashmo,4,Mon Nov 18 03:41:38 2013 UTC,"All-in it was probably about $700.00 (US).    I'm an IT guy, so I have a good understanding of servers, networks, and regular WiFi setup.  I've never messed with RF amps, antennas, or the 900MHz band before this project.  I did a lot of reading.  Learned a bunch of stuff about antennas, cable loss, effective radiated power, line-of-site requirements, and everything that goes with a radio link.    I still probably only know 2% of what I would need to design something like this and have it work the fist time though.  I really just blundered my way through, making halfway educated guesses based on what my Google-Fu was able to dredge up.    I got lucky with the amplifier.  I took a chance and bought one, to see if it was even compatible with the Ubiquiti hardware.  Once I was able to confirm that it was transmitting and receiving properly, I bought a 2nd one.    It's entirely possible that some of the less-than-legal high-power 2.4GHz equipment out there would have done the trick for cheaper, but I didn't even know it existed until I'd already committed to the 900MHz parts.  Although I still think (given my research) that the 900MHz band got me through the trees."
darknetplan,1qv8o8,AceyJuan,4,Mon Nov 18 04:06:54 2013 UTC,"I just don't understand.  If you have line of sight, two can-tennas would easily have worked if you limit to one band like 2.4 or 5.8 and have proper length for the chosen channel."

darknetplan,1q9q6g,Vlinux,2,Sat Nov 9 22:12:39 2013 UTC,"Raspberry Pis with wifi antennas is a great idea for mesh networks. I've thought about trying to do something like that at uni. The 1km wireless devices however, have (from what I've read) very low bandwidth. Not enough to send a decent network connection through. You might get dial-up speeds, but nothing really usable. It's a consequence of the (low?) frequency the devices use to be able to reach 1km. They're mostly designed for remote-sensing applications where you'd have lots of little sensors scattered around an area transmitting back only small amounts of data."
darknetplan,1q9q6g,iamtheLINAX,1 point,Sun Nov 10 05:29:16 2013 UTC,Hey - Yeah after reading up a little more on that project it looks like you are correct.. The antenna's are low bandwidth.  Thats a bit of a shame because having cheap antennas with a 1km range would mean you could cover a city like manhattan reasonably easily (at least in theory).  I guess such a network would be fine for messaging. I wonder what other options there are for producing something with decent range & higher bandwidth.

There's different approaches to the problem, and that's definitely one of them.   In cities like NY where population is very dense are there already problems due to there being too many networks in close proximity?   Absolutely. WiFi is divided into several channels, but they overlap so only a few can be used in one space at the same time. 2.4GHz is overwhelmed in many places. The 5GHz band it fairly wide open, just tightly regulated in the US.  Ideally, a mesh network would have shared nodes direct traffic (for instance, nodes A and C are connected to B, but not each other, so B will tell them to reduce power to minimize overlap, or post a schedule they can follow to take turns). But the total amount of bandwidth/range that is being shared stays constant."

The setup will have really low bandwidth, but if I can run an IRC server on the mesh network, that would make me happy.  Anybody have any tips for success?"
darknetplan,1pl1yz,jercos,4,Thu Oct 31 05:37:59 2013 UTC,"It looks like those chips don't have any provision for collision avoidance, as the datasheet recommends for example, buffering low-rate data and sending it in short bursts of a much higher data rate. It is not clear from skimming the datasheet how if at all this system would lend itself to anything but a single point-to-point link.  With that in mind, the chip does appear to support preamble, FEC, and a sync word, and data whitening. It seems wise to take advantage of all of the above. As the packet length is almost certainly over 256 bytes each and every time, and it seems that a CRC is not computed by the chip in ""infinite packet"" mode, it may be wise to add a CRC of your own to each packet in the Pi before transmission, checking it and discarding mangled packets in software.  As to which protocol to use, it's almost certainly simpler to make a small-scope IP link using a TUN device, much as cjdns itself does, and then peer between the two Pis using static private addresses. It would also be possible to use a TAP device and use the ethernet connectivity built into cjdns, and both approaches are relatively direct and lightweight, but in the case of an ethernet device, if an address were assigned to the interface, ARP requests may be sent from that side, clogging the tubes as it were. A similar issue can arise of network management software attempts to automatically configure the interface, only with DHCP rather than ARP. An IP-only TUN link eliminates this possibility, and will only pass IP traffic, and avoids the issue of potentially accidentally assigning an address by simply assigning an address :)  I presume if you're attempting something of this level you already understand the pros and cons of cooking up your own solution to an already solved problem instead of simply purchasing a few USB wifi dongles and antennas, and are already capable of using an SPI device from a Pi, so I won't bother telling you to, e.g., unblacklist the SPI module in modprobe.d, or that you can in fact use wifi and wifi-like protocols on 900MHz at full speed.  Hope that's relevant to any issues you may have, ""any tips"" is sorta ambiguous on the level of help you're looking for. :p"

Why not implement Ethernet and use Ethernet peering instead?"
darknetplan,1pl1yz,jercos,2,Thu Oct 31 08:48:46 2013 UTC,"Reasons already given in the comment you replied to, immediately after the part you quoted. Assuming one doesn't mind the occasional broadcast traffic, and the slightly awkward case of an active interface with no configured IP address, there isn't any major issue with doing so, but the overhead should be very close.  Ethernet actually might have a slight advantage as it does have its own CRC, so one might not need to be added by the daemon handling communicating with the cc1101, but using IP also allows for convenient unencrypted traffic between the Pis, such as directly SSHing between them without going through cjdns, a useful property if one of the Pis is remote and otherwise inaccessible for such things as restarting cjdns after an upgrade.  Not to say you can't do that just as easily with an Ethernet interface, but the extra ARP traffic and broadcasts can make a fair difference in idle noise once the IP stack is brought up on both interfaces, whereas for a pure IP link no ARP traffic is needed, and the IP configuration required for such is implied by the use of an IP link. The Ethernet peering mechanism poses the largest advantage in a case where an Ethernet network already exists, such as a wifi network."
darknetplan,1pl1yz,jercos,1 point,Thu Oct 31 10:15:36 2013 UTC,"Do you have a transceiver that you can recommend?    I'm looking for something with at least a 1500 meter range without line of site, on which I can use as many open sourced software libraries as possible.    Bandwidth and cost are important factors, but my biggest concern is the range."
darknetplan,1pl1yz,interfect,2,Thu Oct 31 18:08:52 2013 UTC,"If you're looking for maximum open source compatibility there's really only one way this can go, and that's a wifi dongle and a directional antenna.  These might not be your solution of choice, but if you have line of sight including the first Fresnel zone (which you probably have if your radios are in a building's second floor or above) then any reasonably powerful wifi adapter and a directional antenna should give you 1500 meters easily.  If this is to be a point to point link, and not a 1500 meter omnidirectional network, the main focus can be on antenna design, and you can start to involve all sorts of directional antenna projects, the cantenna, the ole' parabolic barbecue grill, even a narrow sector antenna. With any of these you shouldn't need more than 100mW of power, which any usb dongle or router should put out.  Beyond those options, if you actually are looking to make something that can later be expanded to point to multipoint, Ubiquiti's NanoStation loco M5 advertises 15km range out of the box, can run by itself without a raspi behind each node, and running a simple link calculator tells me that if your link is in fact line of sight, you should get -57 dBm signal at 1.5km, and you'd still get -65 if you were transmitting at a mere 100mW, while a properly configured M5 loco can have a sensitivity down to below -90 dBm, leaving your signal as quite reliable. Of course that sensitivity could mean sacrificing some speed, so your link might be a mere 36mbit/s ;)"

As for the integration into the init system, that's another question. If you're using systemd, there is a setting the configuration file to disable forking at startup. (noBackground: 1)  For installation, I recommend installing in /usr/local using stow"
darknetplan,1p3x13,thefinn93,1 point,Thu Oct 24 09:40:11 2013 UTC,"There is an init script in the ""scripts"" directory which you can copy over to the /etc/init.d directory.  upstart and systemd files are located under contrib."

It's recommended you get it out of git for easy updating, as cjdns updates frequently, often breaking backwards compatibility (it's alpha software, this is not the plan forever). However if you really have a hardon for tarballs, GitHub offers downloads of the master branch in .tar.gz and .zip form."
darknetplan,1p3x13,voltx,1 point,Thu Oct 24 16:38:43 2013 UTC,"Oh so is git basically like apt-get / yum?  I guess I can set that up, and schedule it to run every now and then.  Is that typically the preferred way?"
darknetplan,1p17sq,mobu,17,Wed Oct 23 05:50:13 2013 UTC,"Let my try to give it a shot -- for the benefit of the both of us; I want to see if I can give a decent explanation off-top. There is admittedly a bit of a gap between the ""metaphor"" of the project-meshnet video and actually installing it on your system and posting on uppit. As someone who's also still starting out (and who has spent a lot of time going back and forth on the 'beginner' level stuff), it'll be good practice for me to write it up.   So let's start where you started. You say you've got a pretty good knowledge of how the internet works. Simply put, that can't be possible if you're not a tech-savy person. The internet is  the most complicated system ever put into motion by humans because, now that every other complicated system (banking, trade, insurance, etc.) is tied into it. There's a lot going on here. As someone who thought they had a pretty good idea of how the internet works until I tried to start understanding cjdns, it's a lot more complicated than you think.   But there are some general principles that I'm sure you understand. You buy your internet from an ISP, who handles all the big engineering problems for you. They lay fiber-optic cables, have huge and powerful switching hardware to get all your packets to their destinations, and, unfortunately, also have the capability to share your information with other entities (such as the NSA). You run your own software on your computer. Windows or Mac or Linux, you have some say over what's on there and who has access to it. Finally, you have stuff out in the cloud. Facebook, reddit, gmail, Amazon, whatever -- part of your personal data is out there on servers that you can't even point to. You trust the companies that host your data, and you have some say over what they do with it (based on the agreement that you clicked on without reading), but much less than what's on your computer. Your internet self is, by design, out in the cloud. Trouble is that the cloud is waaaay up there and under the control of other people. When you interact with your digital self, you send signals out to the cloud to change/update things, and those changes rain down on your actual physical friends out here in the world.   So CJDNS is an attempt (the most successful thus-far, IMO) to build a system that's secure, scalable, and that brings the cloud down to your level. To be part of it, you'll have to get your hands a little wet.   CJDNS is a piece of software that you can download and install (if you're on OS X or Linux), that will handle routing and switching for you. Instead of your data packets flying out to the cloud and back down to their destinations, CJDNS sends your packets to another computer (or router/switch) running CJDNS, which passes it to the next computer/router that is closer to the destination, and that one passes it on to the next one, and so on. By design it is secure and distributed, so that no central authority has any control over your data.   To install CJDNS you'll need to have a basic familiarity with a command line interface. You'll need to download it from github and run a few commands in your terminal to configure it. But then you're not there yet, because you still are lacking the most important part of the equation: Trust.   In order to get onto Hyperboria (the CJDNS internet), you need to find a person who owns a device running CJDNS and 'peer' with them. This might seem a bit daunting, but remember you 'trusted' facebook and flickr and google and countless other folks you don't even know for cloud access -- and they are out there trying to make money off of you. Anyways, once you get a 'key' from an existing member of Hyperboria you can join up and check it out.   The 'community' element of CJDNS is simultaneously the greatest strength and the greatest barrier to entry. But Hyperboria is an internet that remembers that the internet is just a very large community. Contribute and learn from the community, and you're part of it :)"
darknetplan,1p17sq,gichiba,3,Wed Oct 23 10:52:10 2013 UTC,Thanks for this neat writeup! So is there a way you can connect to other CJDNS users using your existing Internet connection (encrypted)? Or does it completely defy the purpose of a mesh?
darknetplan,1p17sq,gichiba,4,Wed Oct 23 14:16:57 2013 UTC,"Yes, that's one of the great things about CJDNS; it can tunnel through your existing connection to make a 'virtual' link with another node.  Eventually, however, the goal is to have all the nodes physically connected through user-owned hardware."
darknetplan,1p17sq,happycadaver,4,Thu Oct 24 02:27:34 2013 UTC,My goal is to setup a mesh around the University campus area so that only students are allowed to access it.

darknetplan,1p17sq,pushme2,2,Thu Oct 24 03:32:37 2013 UTC,"Great explanation. This mirrors a lot of how my co worker was explaining it to me. Once you are inside the circle of trust, hahaa couldn't help myself, the new Internet is yours"
darknetplan,1p17sq,gichiba,2,Wed Oct 23 13:38:11 2013 UTC,"So let's start where you started. You say you've got a pretty good knowledge of how the internet works. Simply put, that can't be possible if you're not a tech-savy person.   Maybe   The internet is the most complicated system ever put into motion by humans because, now that every other complicated system (banking, trade, insurance, etc.) is tied into it.   I would not say it is the most complicated thing ever, as it is logically broken up into sections (layers is what they are actually called), and each section is almost completely independent of the other sections.   There's a lot going on here. As someone who thought they had a pretty good idea of how the internet works until I tried to start understanding cjdns, it's a lot more complicated than you think.   There is a lot going on, and really, unless you can read C, you can't really understand or find out how CJDNS works because there isn't much documentation besides the white paper.   So CJDNS is an attempt (the most successful thus-far, IMO) to build a system that's secure, scalable, and that brings the cloud down to your level. To be part of it, you'll have to get your hands a little wet.   CJDNS is not a complete solution to the problem you stated in the previously. Servers and clients you connect to will still see everything you sent them. Let's use the example of Google on the hyperboria. You search for ""[insert thing you don't want others to know here]"" and Google can still see that, even though your traffic is encrypted at the link level, and possibly the application layer too. The advantage however is that only the entities your client connects to can see what you are doing. But do also keep in mind that if Google references an external asset or something on their pages, your client will also connect to them too, thus opening up the same possibilities for tracking as are on the Internet today.   So CJDNS is an attempt (the most successful thus-far, IMO) to build a system that's secure, scalable, and that brings the cloud down to your level. To be part of it, you'll have to get your hands a little wet.   Let's form a proper definition of ""the cloud"" in context with networking. An older definition of this would be any networking equipment outside one particular entity's direct influence and control. This definition would define the cloud as hardware and any hardware outside a user's network (usually a LAN home network) as the cloud. Another definition which actually fits inside the previous definition would be defining the cloud as any software and storage services not under the direct influence and control of a user (AWS, Reddit, Google etc...). Or a slight modification to that would be any external service not hosted by the client (OwnCloud on local network).   CJDNS is a piece of software ... that will handle routing and switching for you. Instead of your data packets flying out to the cloud and back down to their destinations, CJDNS sends your packets to another computer ... running CJDNS, which passes it to the next computer/router that is closer to the destination, and that one passes it on to the next one, and so on. By design it is secure and distributed, so that no central authority has any control over your data.   That is how the internet works already. The internet is decentralized for the most part.  CJDNS is simply software which is kind of a slightly different implementation of IPv6 that can run over other networks (IPv6 could in theory)."
darknetplan,1p17sq,OmicronNine,2,Wed Oct 23 13:47:25 2013 UTC,"I would not say it is the most complicated thing ever, as it is logically broken up into sections (layers is what they are actually called), and each section is almost completely independent of the other sections.   The OSI layers are pretty hard to understand without being 'tech savy'. And even once you get that, there's still all the business about RSA encryption, DNS, CDMA, etc. To get all that you need to have at least a cursory knowledge of some pretty high level math and information theory.    That is how the internet works already. The internet is decentralized for the most part. CJDNS is simply software which is kind of a slightly different implementation of IPv6 that can run over other networks (IPv6 could in theory).   I really don't think that's the case. CJDNS is a dramatic departure from traditional routing algorithms because it doesn't need to depend on centralized network design. The way the internet works now, my packets need to be forwarded through many hierarchies of organization/design by many different corporate entities (corporate as in a large body, not an 'evil corporation' -- although Comcast definitely qualifies as an evil corporation). Each of these entities must organize and standardize their routing in order for intranetwork packets to get where they're going. This takes time, expertise, and lots of money. If the internet were decentralized, ""Enterprise Networking"" wouldn't be a thing.   CJDNS takes a little time, and if you want to get into it and build a physical node, a little money. No central design required.   EDIT: some grammar."
darknetplan,1p17sq,Caminsky,6,Thu Oct 24 02:52:56 2013 UTC,"I hate to seem like a jerk, but this has been asked here many times and in many forms, both in reference to specific details and in general.

I wish I could have a talk with the authors and tell them in their fucking face, dude, not everyone is a fucking hacker!"
darknetplan,1p17sq,Caminsky,4,Wed Oct 23 17:37:26 2013 UTC,"While it's true there is a bit of a learning curve for Hyperboria, it's also true that you don't have to be a 'hacker' to connect.   That you even have heard of CJDNS is testament to that fact. There have been hundreds of hours of development spent by very dedicated folks to make CJDNS more accessible and user-friendly. If it were really some 'hacker' thing it would be floating around e-mail lists and  cryptography forums not even close to the mainstream.   No, this is a nascent technology. A potentially disruptive one, at that. You can't install it with one click because it's not at that level of development yet, and it shouldn't be. But every time a new person actually decides to invest some time and learn a little outside their consumer comfort zone, the mainstream becomes a little bit more of a possibility.   So go learn some basic command line; figure out what github is, and if you've never done so, install a distro of linux on your computer. If you can muster that minimum amount of effort, you'll see that connecting to Hyperboria is a lot easier than it initially looked. And you'll know a little bit about linux! You may not be a hacker, but when you fire up the command line in front of friends you can feel like a hacker."
darknetplan,1p17sq,MrMaxPowers247,2,Thu Oct 24 03:43:13 2013 UTC,"Ok, but the best way to attract users and the interest is by at least making it easy to understand. Yes, I know what github is and I know what a repository is I even push and pull stuff to my own server, who cares? I am just a one person, if there is ever to be a true alternative to the current internet (which is being turned into what cable is) then CJDNS needs more people in it. Not everyone has to know the details but at least the entry barriers should be reduced."
darknetplan,1p17sq,Ironfist,1 point,Thu Oct 24 05:58:22 2013 UTC,Get a raspberry pi or a old old laptop and go for it. Its amazing how much you learn from messing around with Linux. The first time I used the terminal I was scared as hell that I was going to mess things up. Seriously checked the first line of code for mistakes at least 10 times before pressing enter. It was so cool to see my screen scrolling line after line of code. The more you do the more you start to actually understand what you're doing and why.
darknetplan,1p17sq,ListenHereStupid,2,Thu Oct 24 04:40:38 2013 UTC,Considering the amount of spam and zombie PCs on the regular Internet perhaps requiring a little bit of knowledge to use the network is a good thing.  They are working on an installer for Windows so that regular users can get online but for now it's still mostly a project by and for hackers.
darknetplan,1p17sq,neilalexanderr,-2,Wed Oct 23 19:37:39 2013 UTC,"Consider that the education necessary to use the network is a barrier of entry, and if you can't or won't educate yourself enough to use the network, perhaps it's not a huge loss to the CJDNS community.  I've never seen a network made stronger by adopting the most clueless amongst us. Figure it out, ask for help, but to whine and cry about it being too difficult only indicates that you're probably not bright or dedicated enough to learn about the technology that you're using (or in your case, trying to use)."

darknetplan,1oof14,panjadotme,3,Fri Oct 18 16:19:56 2013 UTC,100km is definitely a long shot.. But what I think most people are missing is that this is for a back haul... You probably wouldn't be putting anything else on that spectrum.
darknetplan,1oof14,ImOlGregg,1 point,Fri Oct 18 16:42:22 2013 UTC,Heaven forbid anyone wants to do pmp off the same tower or utilize spectrum efficiently. This might be fine in scarcely populated areas but it's extremely wasteful use of the spectrum.
darknetplan,1oof14,vacuu,1 point,Fri Oct 18 16:44:33 2013 UTC,802.11ac uses up to a 160 MHz channel in the 5 GHz band. Minimum channel size is 80 MHz. This is the next generation of wifi beyond 802.11n.
darknetplan,1oof14,ImOlGregg,2,Fri Oct 18 20:04:35 2013 UTC,"I'm going to post what a very smart man said and I agree 100%  The problems I have with the product are as follows:  1)    Huge channels in a small band.  And a band that is really needed for other, more profitable things.  The orthogon was somewhat useful in that environment because of the piano key approach to spectrum usage.  This thing is appears to be like a giant eraser instead of a comb.   2)    Short range.  20.25 miles at full throughput with zero fade margin.  With any kind of reasonable fade margin you are in the low teens.  Most of my 5.8 high cap backhaul is rural long distance.  Short distances will be airfiber or 18 Ghz systems.  I use 5.8 to augment 6 GHz licensed over some routes.  I cannot seem to think of an application where I can use this device.  It is sure to not get along with a tower site full of access points.   3)    Not a narrow beam.  Antenna beamwidth aka directivity is equal to gain (with a constant efficiency factor applied.  Gain = Directivity = 1/beamwidth  There is no getting away from that.  While it isn’t spewing like a sector, it certainly is going to blanket a good portion of real estate with a signal that will preclude other PMP operations in that portion of the band.  External antenna option would help this considerably.   If I understand this correctly 50 MHz gets you 1 Gbps aggregate TDD.  So for a balanced system it is really 500 Mbps in a 50 MHz channel.  That is somewhat contrary to what the video leads one to believe.  I understand sales puffery but how is Roberts presentation not technically in error on this point?"
darknetplan,1oof14,SoCo_cpp,-1,Fri Oct 18 20:31:48 2013 UTC,That's cheap!   Not sure if sarcastic or sales department...  I guess every industrial level product is insainly expensive though.
darknetplan,1oof14,DRUTLOL,5,Fri Oct 18 13:42:15 2013 UTC,Last month we were pricing ligo/dragonwave/exalt gear for licensed backhauls. We were expecting to spend $7k PER SIDE until this announcement. $1k is very nice.
darknetplan,1oof14,SoCo_cpp,0,Fri Oct 18 15:20:11 2013 UTC,Seems a bit crazy from your standard consumer perspective.
darknetplan,1oof14,DRUTLOL,1 point,Fri Oct 18 15:29:25 2013 UTC,"It is crazy. But you typically need sub 1ms speeds on backhauls, which the lower end gear just cannot do."
darknetplan,1oof14,brodie7838,7,Fri Oct 18 16:19:24 2013 UTC,"No, it very much is cheap. For comparison, one of the only other gigabit backhauls on the market is around $12,000, used. I'm not a UBNT fanboy by any means, but saying this gives you a ""little"" more than a Dlink is the understatement of the year. As for LOS, yes, that's completely logical, most point to point equipment is designed, marketed, and sold with that expectation. You don't get a full Gigabit of throughput by shooting through a tree. And yeah, you can achieve a 60 mile shot if you are using a tall structure on both sides. As for a leaf blocking the signal, hardly. A tree, yes, but 5Ghz is not that sensitive. 23Ghz, absolutely, but not 5Ghz.  Source: I used to design, install, and troubleshoot many of the larger enterprise-grade brands. I designed a statewide gigabit wireless network that had multiple 50+ mile shots at 800Mbps-1Gbps links using Dragonwave.  Learn your topic before you start discounting things you don't understand."
darknetplan,1oof14,panjadotme,3,Fri Oct 18 15:54:28 2013 UTC,I wish! No that's very well priced.. Their last model was pushing $1500 per side.

darknetplan,1oof14,SoCo_cpp,-3,Fri Oct 18 14:03:17 2013 UTC,"It is 5 Ghz. If you get a leaf in the way you've lost signal. All radio equipment claims 20 miles, with the asterisk restricting that to 'with line of sight'. The curvature of the earth makes anything over 20 miles pretty useless for ground consumers, in my understanding.  But, I guess you are right. This may have some technical advances a little above your average 5 Ghz Wifi AP/Bridge, right? The video seemed to be all about design and if it mentioned the specs I probably missed that part."
darknetplan,1oof14,panjadotme,2,Fri Oct 18 14:12:54 2013 UTC,"Its not as bad as you may think... Since these are essentially made for large point-to-point back hauls, they are usually placed higher up either on towers or tall buildings to accommodate for line-of-sight and to avoid bad morphology. They are literally made for direct line-of-sight! Haha. The biggest issue I see with these is always going to be free space path loss and weather conditions, but they work relatively well in the scenarios that they're made for. I can't speak to the 100km+ claim but with a promise like that it will be more than useful for a shorter more realistic link. Still, I think it's a step up from their 24GHz model."

darknetplan,1oof79,danry25,4,Thu Oct 17 23:44:57 2013 UTC,"Eh, Open Garden is misleading. It is a closed source app that seems to form a quasi-mesh like network, although it falls flat on its face with more than a handful of devices.

Meshes are bad for mobile network operators - they make insane profits, mostly on local calls which could be totally replaced by local meshes.

You don't need a powerful system to run as a server unless you expect a ton of traffic.  Don't worry, if you live in the US, chances are your shitty residential internet connection will choke before your hardware will.  If you expect to generate any meaningful amount of traffic (i.e. run a public service,) investing in server space elsewhere is necessary. Running a server can be very simple, but there are a lot of options.  Be sure to read the relevant documentation for whichever software you're using. It's usually a good idea to keep your Internet-facing server activity off of your personal desktop.  If your server is ever compromised, you do not want your personal desktop compromised, too.  It also helps keep things clearly organized. Yes, you should leave your server up all the time."

They think that there's a lot of tinfoil hattery going around, and in typical internet bravery fashion, they downvote it and tell people not to be so stupid and naive.

The replies were all along the lines of ""This is stupid, if you have that much to hide, you probably shouldn't be on the internet,"" and ""Not worth the trouble/these probably don't even work.""  Due to their lack of understanding or willingness to differentiate technologies, they liken Meshnet to services that have been proven to be untrustworthy or just not worth the effort one has to have to maintain it.

darknetplan,1ocl81,enigmabox_net,0,Sun Oct 13 11:31:10 2013 UTC,"I think the price you're (assuming this is you since the username is /u/enigmabox_net) charging for one of these things is a bit ridiculous. I see what you're doing with it, and it does have extra features that come along with it (not just Hyperboria access), but the price you're charging is extremely high.   I'm curious if you actually care about creating meshnets or if you're just doing this for some fast cash. These boxes you're selling don't create meshnets at all, they create another overlay network that isn't very helpful for creating meshnets at all.  I'm not bashing you completely; if you succeed that's good for you, but I think 1) they're way too expensive (even if people pay for them) and 2) in my opinion you're only doing this for the money, not for the meshnets."
darknetplan,1ocl81,lukevers,5,Sun Oct 13 11:55:06 2013 UTC,"First, the price wasn't my idea. Everyone can build its own box and peer with any hyperboria node, since we made our code free software. You can build your own: http://wiki.enigmabox.net/build-your-own  For the rest of the people who are not willing to spend time and energy in building a box for themselves, they can buy one preconfigured one. And of course, pay for it :> laziness has its price. But everyone is free to choose. And we have to keep our infrastructure (and people) running. Doing fast cash with it is the last thing we want.  We are heavily interested in building mesh networks. The problem we actually have is: People may build meshnets and use them. But there aren't that many services in hyperboria, yet. Too less to use them as a complete replacement of the internet. Also, people building meshnets are in the minority. We need to roll out much more cjdns nodes. To everyone. And we do this by offering such a VPN box, so that people have at least some benefit with it.  When the internet goes dark, there will be enough cjdns nodes out there, and all they have to do is set up peerings with existing nodes.  You may have read our Masterplan, haven't you? http://wiki.enigmabox.net/masterplan  People still rely too much on the existing internet. Hyperboria is not so popular yet. This is why we ship these boxes to as many people as possible. When the net is ready, then they will all have access, because the technology is already there. What we must do is bring cjdns to as many people as possible.  And please, we hope that others will come up and do something similar. We don't want to be the only ones doing this, since that would build a central structure, and we don't like central structures."

darknetplan,1o2i57,BostonTentacleParty,2,Wed Oct 9 16:42:39 2013 UTC,"Yes and no-  Diaspora, to my knowledge, doesn't have a revenue generating model.  My idea is to create a marketplace between users advertisers with a layer of anonymity where advertisers pay you directly for the right to advertise to you.  The user would get some money, and a percentage would go to a collective that would then use the funds to maintain a legal department to comply with legit investigations so governments couldn't shut the site down.  Money would also go to maintaining the network and hopefully creating ISPs along the same model."
darknetplan,1o2i57,shitasspetfuckers,2,Wed Oct 9 16:46:15 2013 UTC,"I think you'll have a hard time getting advertisers to agree to that. It would take an exodus from Facebook large enough to seriously impact their profits. Because paying Facebook for access to all their users is way, way easier and cheaper than paying users individually."
darknetplan,1o2i57,Veteran4Peace,2,Wed Oct 9 21:07:06 2013 UTC,The software could be designed such that those buying the advertisements pay a single lump sum (e.g. yearly) and the money would automatically be distributed among the users.
darknetplan,1o2i57,watchout5,2,Thu Oct 10 00:46:00 2013 UTC,"Advertisers will go wherever the eyeballs are. The beauty of this plan is that the user's actually get paid to use the social network. There's no logical reason to continue using facebook if there was a widely available platform like this. If you can offer income, anonymnity, Privacy and the legal team t o back it up, you will beat fb in the market. The problem is scale, but I think the idea itself will lead to scale if executed correctly. Crucial part is in the execution, ie structuring a collective ownership model that works and a participatory governance model that works as well. No small feat, but completely possible with the technology we have at our disposal.  The biggest challenge is achieving legitimacy in the eyes of the users."

It wouldn't prevent someone with some kind of insider knowledge of how a device could be made (hardware backdoor) from gaining full access however even if they did the point would be to give them encrypted information if only to make their time decrypting it that much harder. I like referencing how I ""fixed"" my car after it was stolen as an analogy for this kind of issue. I didn't make my car impossible to break into and steal, because such a task would require redoing almost the entire car to achieve such a goal. I bought a giant bar that sits on the clutch and it's easier to remove the clutch pedal than to remove this device. This won't prevent someone with a giant flatbed from stealing me car, but that's now what it takes to remove that car (or melting off the pedal), and not everyone will have access to a flatbed and even if they did it'll be really obvious to the whole area that someone's moving that car with a ton of force.  Further to the point you're making though, we will one day gain the ability to print computers. We could design our own chips, install them in weather proof hardware we manufacture and then have room for tons of modifications. Eventually, for security reasons, we could limit what's allowed on the mesh network to that specific kind of hardware profile. There's so many possibilities, so much to talk about. It's something I want to start putting a bunch of force behind though. I trust Joe Bob from down the street more than I trust large multinational conglomerate that's colluding with their competition to provide shit service that outsources everything they do except profits. I'd love to add Joe Bob as some kind of a ""friend"" in a social network of the people around me. There's absolutely no need to have a multinational corporation involved in me and Joe Bob's social circle. It's definitely part of the problem."

The FCC disagreed, finding that the ""signal"" was commercial because it carried commercial Internet services, regardless of whether the ""service"" was free.

So in the case of cjdns, you can be certain that the address you are communicating with is in fact the owner of the key in question (provided a truncated double-sha512sum is secure).

I have given up all hope that the masses will jump onto crypto technology just because somebody might be listening on their network communication.

If it can't do this, it won't catch on. BitTorrent got quick uptake because of its obvious usecases for distributing entertainment (more often than not, in the case of piracy, at near-zero cost to the user).  There are decentralised forms of social networks out there. But they haven't really grown because they are just that tiny little bit more difficult to understand than the centralised ones.

Additionally, Tor can't be run atop an independent meshnet or on a purely local network without a significant amount of work.  If you want secure anonymity look to Freenet and i2p, both are very secure and Freenet is fully capable of being run over local meshnets with minimal effort."

darknetplan,1ng0e9,raggymanky,2,Wed Oct 2 05:20:45 2013 UTC,What's the difference between cjdns and TOR's name spacing/routing? Can they work together/on top of each other?
darknetplan,1ng0e9,danry25,2,Mon Sep 30 18:22:06 2013 UTC,"No, cjdns and Tor are completely diffrent animals, comparing the two is comparing apples and kiwis. Cjdns works both as a low level networking protocol and a VPN seamlessly, including some features that ensure security and some anonymity, while still being extremely fast, while Tor seems to prioritize anonymity above everything else.  Additionally, I highly recommend people avoid Tor and use more secure darknets like Freenet & i2p if your trying to stay anonymous, as Tor has undersized key sizes that the NSA (and most large organizations) can likely crack, and it is a highly centralized system with just a handful of root directory servers that can screw over the entire network at any given moment."
darknetplan,1ng0e9,kodemage,-1,Tue Oct 1 02:41:17 2013 UTC,I'm not able to answer that question because I'm not as familiar with CJDNS as I am with Tor. As I understand it they exist side by side.

darknetplan,1ne0od,-error37,12,Sun Sep 29 18:46:28 2013 UTC,Bam. Requires an amateur radio license. I'd stick with 900mhz since it's ISM and more likely to be legal. Used Ubiquiti SR9 and XR9 units are cheaper on ebay anyway.

Slightly lower power output than the Xagyl card but some testing has suggested it might have better receiver sensitivity. I'm not sure they're in production anymore. That or they need imported from Asia which can be more hassle than it's worth. I don't remember exactly.   Aslo with these cards what should I use them in, an alix board?   I'm a fan of Routerboards. They're inexpensive and Streakwave should also sell outdoor (and indoor) cases for them. I've used them with my Xagyl cards."

darknetplan,1ne0od,tacticaltaco,4,Sun Sep 29 21:34:04 2013 UTC,No problem. I'd really take a good look at the Ubiquiti SR9 gear. It's a bit older but they can be found for $50 a pop on eBay. Good 900mhz antennas are easier to come by as well.  What kind of terrain are you dealing with? Going 20km can be done easily in one shot if the terrain is in your favor.
darknetplan,1ne0od,brodie7838,2,Sun Sep 29 23:15:35 2013 UTC,Rough terrain lots of mountains and trees hence my desire for 400mhz. It doesn't need to be a super highspeed link the WAN will only be 5mbit-ish anyway. There are quite a few wireless providers out here already using 900mhz/2.4ghz/5ghz also so I want to use a clearer frequency. xr7 might be an option too. Thanks again for all your input.
darknetplan,1ne0od,dicknuckle,6,Sun Sep 29 23:27:08 2013 UTC,Good luck. Do check the regulations for your country. They might be lax for you but here in the US trying to use the 700mhz band without the right license will get you a very big fine very quickly.
darknetplan,1ne0od,DRUTLOL,2,Sun Sep 29 23:41:11 2013 UTC,"I too would recommend sticking with 900Mhz for a few reasons. First, the lower the frequency, the less available throughput you'll have available. Second, unless you're penetrating a lot of foliage or other obstructions, 900Mhz will benefit you more than 400Mhz. As someone else said, you can pick up Mikrotik Routerboard or Ubiquity for much cheaper, and greater availability in terms of ability to purchase. Just my 2 cents."
darknetplan,1ne0od,BobHogan,2,Sun Sep 29 21:28:09 2013 UTC,900mhz is jam packed here and it wont make it over the terrain.

Ubiquiti M series radios alos have a built in spectrum analyzer. Not sure about older non-m radios. This is of course disregarding individual cards. The spectrum analyzer is part of ubiquiti firmware for the radios. Should be able to get a hold of pico and nanostation m900s. That could be your best bet."

darknetplan,1n6mik,danry25,4,Thu Sep 26 16:27:48 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I don't see why not. That's effectively what we're doing by bootstrapping it locally with VPN.  The goal, after all, is to build networks of networks."
darknetplan,1n6mik,DZCreeper,2,Thu Sep 26 18:07:33 2013 UTC,"Sure, most local meshnets use cjdns vpn tunnels to connect with other meshnets over the internet."

Is there any wireless solutions that could be used to span distances that large without needing to lay thousands of miles of cables? To start out with we would only need a small amount of bandwidth, just add more connections later."
darknetplan,1n6mik,AdenSB,2,Fri Sep 27 07:27:45 2013 UTC,"AFAIK, this is a little like a ""cheat"".   If I were to use a VPN, my node would appear to anyone connecting to the node I had VPN'd into, as if there was a physical cable.   It is not an ideal solution, as it uses the old Internet paths, and I could be taken offline at any second with no backup if the network in my area failed.   I'm hoping though, if I can get mine online, I can get a few more people around my are interested, so we'd have a local network, remoted into a wider one.   One day, we will definitely run our own cables. There was a TIL yesterday about a uk-us fat pipe being put down for a financial institution for 300m USD, with enough people on each continent, interconnects could be feasible. The only other way, besides satellite, could be data over Ham, but this is REALLY slow."

However, they both lack support for tagging messages using hashtags and subscribing to messages on certain topics (the publish/subscribe paradigm). This is the key facet I want to bring with BitWeav.  As for open standards like OStatus and ActivityStreams, I think federation is very important. I'm focusing on implementing the protocol right now, which is a huge task, but once this is done it will be a simple matter to interface with other protocols.  EDIT  Thanks for your comment, I'm now planning something better for BitWeav. I'm definitely going to integrate with OStatus now you have mentioned it and I have thought more. The key feature of BitWeav is that it offers the ability to follow/subscribe to hashtags in a P2P manner."

Just like cjdns might not be compatible with ipv4, if your implementation has to go out of its way to implement Ostatus or Activitystreams then focus on your core and see if it works.   The trouble with Tent wasn't that it wasn't compatible with everything. It's that it doesn't work at all when distributed."

darknetplan,1n747b,dicarlobrotha2,8,Thu Sep 26 19:39:12 2013 UTC,"I wouldn't worry too much, and here's why.   If it's illegal on the internet, it's going to be illegal on mesh. Selling weapons, human trafficking, selling illegal drugs - it's illegal regardless of the network you're doing it on. So, stay clear of that and you should be fine. So, in that sense, mesh has nothing to do with it. The spectrum used by 2.4 Ghz devices, being ""crushed"" by people because they want mesh networks to stop would be like using a tank to kill a fly. You have to remember that here are millions of wireless networking consumer devices out there, and if 2.4 Ghz was taken away it would break all of those devices. Corporations that sell those items wouldn't be happy. Whether the NSA wants this or not is sort of beside the point. If they want to monitor it then they'll have to find a way in. Mesh or not, I wouldn't assume privacy on any network regardless because even in the most secure networks humans can always be coerced to give up secrets, passwords, connection points, and encryption keys. The humans are still the weakest point in the network, and law enforcement are going to press on those points if they can't get in via other means. DarkNet / Hyperboria is independent of the spectrum it runs over, so I don't see how FCC regulations have anything to do with the ability for it to exist. Worst possible case, it's not convenient to get to and only runs over wired networks. No big deal. Why would ISPs care to block a nationwide meshnet? If you're connecting via cjdns you're probably doing it over your ISP connection anyway. If you're talking about a wireless mesh that doesn't use ISP connections...yeah well good luck building that. If you really think wireless mesh will ever compete with 10Gb fibre in the ground for sheer transfer speed you're just kidding yourself, and these are the kinds of backbone links necessary to run the commercial internet as it exists today. Mesh nets are, by comparison, a tiny little spec of a threat at this point. Granted, they're a very cool hobby for a small number of interested people, but it's pure ego for anyone on this thread to think that DarkNet is some kind of serious threat to ISPs, governments, or the FCC at this point.   And if anyone thinks meshnets and hyperboria/darknet is free of law enforcement you've got to be kidding. After all, we're organizing this openly, in public. It's not a secret, and there's been plenty of press around it.  To say this all another way, let's worry about reality, not what might happen."

darknetplan,1n5ypy,rlcncrndctzn,1 point,Thu Sep 26 08:41:48 2013 UTC,"The shared, read-only, public hosts file is definitely the simplest approach. One major challenge to DNS is that in order for it to be an authoritative source of mappings between addresses and host names, someone needs to agree that there's a body that issues host names, and everyone needs to agree that body should be empowered to do so.  Once you have that you have some logical equivalent of ICANN.  I was just thinking about this problem today for the ChicagoMeshNet project. We have the advantage (I think) that there are two primary people driving it, and like Linux in the early days where there was one person and a singular focus, decisions can be made quickly. That's basically the model that we're informally using at this point - the two of us talk through issues, setup a solution, and try to gather people around that solution.  Whether we'll have an authoritative DNS server from which all other servers should replicate, or any kind of ICANN equivalent that assigns host names is something that's come to mind, but as rhapso says, it's really one of those, ""Gee, I'd love for CMN to be to big that we actually need to solve this problem,"" kinds of problems - and probably not a priority. I mean, even just running a DNS server that no one is using is a bit of work for a potentially very small number of users."

It would need to be a more complicated scheme than the given example to allow more names, but if doable it would at least give SOME method of naming sites, if not allowing all possible names.  Probably still not important at this point, but it might be a useful idea in the future."
darknetplan,1n5ypy,mister_zd,0,Fri Sep 27 05:56:04 2013 UTC,"If you're using IPv4 that particular scheme would severely limit your possible host names, and it doesn't deal with the problem of subdomains, but again if the list of hosts is short enough, a public, shared hosts file will do it, and might be less work than establishing and enforcing a strict IP-to-hostname mapping."

As a user of meshnet I what to resolve address of that company, and it should be address that is close to me, to get it local services.  This can be possible if MeshNet is Ok with having several nodes with same address. In that case user need to know only one MeshNet address, and it will be routed to the local node, once closes path would be found."

darknetplan,1mh3tq,qazzxswedcvfrtgbnhyu,9,Mon Sep 16 02:44:15 2013 UTC,"Meshnets can be very good at distributing bandwidth between many clients without any loss in throughput; The meshnets that operate as ISP make use of the fact that they can much more efficiently divvy up a large connection than similar technologies (such as WiMax).   As for the affordability of access, there are of course a few tradeoffs when it comes to speed, but as far as I understand many of the meshnet ISPs like Guifi started from a lack of existing infrastructure; meaning that users weren't really competing with a big-time ISP so much as building their own network because the ISP didn't want to sell to them anyways. Fiber is very expensive to put down, and many companies are not willing to take it the last mile to outskirt towns. This is aptly named the last mile problem.   So if you have a rural town with 20-30 potential users, all the users can throw down the relatively cheap (compared to real fiber) hardware costs, then form a sort of co-op to lease a 30 Mbit line from the nearest cell tower. The company running the cell tower gets to sell business-sized access to people it wouldn't serve in the first place, and the people get to buy it and distribute it with a fairly robust and fault-tolerant makeshift infrastructure.   This model actually seems to work fairly well in the developing world, where, again, infrastructure is lacking. Have a look at this paper by Kieth Berkoben to see how it worked in a Kenya pilot project.   As other users have pointed out, though, the appeal of a meshnet in developed countries that already have cheap, competitive internet access is more ideological. These are people who, although they could just buy their broadband from comcast, choose to built and promote the mesh network as an alternative to the internet. They are less concerned with providing affordable connection to the clearnet (or providing it at all) so much as building something new and secure from scratch.   EDIT: There are, of course, notable exceptions to the last part: /u/Rainfly_X is working on an ISP committed to both affordable/competitive clearnet access and immaculate privacy. See the roaming initiative"
darknetplan,1mh3tq,gichiba,1 point,Mon Sep 16 08:54:30 2013 UTC,"Showing up because I have reddit Gold and I get notified of username mentions :)  My business model is based on making Hyperboria access free and ubiquitous, and then charging money for the gateway back to the Clearnet. But it's going to be awhile before people even want such a service, so in order to have a useful service and income flow in the meantime, I'm working on Goldilocks as a simple, self-contained implementation of the Community Gateway model. This basically functions as a formalized version of the co-op model you described:   So if you have a rural town with 20-30 potential users, all the users can throw down the relatively cheap (compared to real fiber) hardware costs, then form a sort of co-op to lease a 30 Mbit line from the nearest cell tower. The company running the cell tower gets to sell business-sized access to people it wouldn't serve in the first place, and the people get to buy it and distribute it with a fairly robust and fault-tolerant makeshift infrastructure.   Where you can have multiple uplink providers in an area pretty seamlessly. It's also simpler from a legal standpoint, because you don't need a real co-op. Some guy decides to lease the line from the cell tower, opens up a gateway machine that bridges the local mesh to the outside world through the 30 Mbit line, and then keep it open as long as the tip jar can support the costs (bringing availability up or down based on contents of the bitcoin wallet). So the only formal relationship is one guy leasing from a cell company, and anyone can set up their own thing along the same model.  I'm going to be developing and testing this over the next few days on my desktop computer, which I hope to host an internet radio station on, and keep it conditionally available based on Bitcoin revenue. Nothing important, just something fun to test with, so that Goldilocks will have some field-testing before people use it on important things."

darknetplan,1mh3tq,oelsen,0,Wed Sep 18 22:40:25 2013 UTC,"It took me a few passes to figure out what your argument was, but I think I've got it. You're worried about administrator liability - the legal system holding the gateway admin liable for traffic coming through the gateway.  Community gateways occupy a new and strange middle ground between Tor and ISPs - a middle ground that they share with (probably) all upstream access options. In most countries, including the US, ISPs have zero liability for content, but may be subject to demands for wiretapping or censorship. This doesn't really incur any liability for small-time gateway operators, especially since government agencies are more likely to silently partner in nefarious dealings with the operator's upstream, since it will probably have an existing relationship with any large telecoms companies.  So let's cover the Tor analog side. Luckily, this is not a totally untrod legal wilderness! Tor's own legal FAQ offers some important guidance, experience, and frame of reference that applies just as well to gateway operators. Probably the most useful context I can quote concisely are these two Q/As:   Has anyone ever been sued or prosecuted for running Tor?  No, we aren’t aware of anyone being sued or prosecuted in the United States for running a Tor relay. Further, we believe that running a Tor relay — including an exit relay that allows people to anonymously send and receive traffic — is lawful under U.S. law.  Should I run an exit relay from my home?  No. If law enforcement becomes interested in traffic from your exit relay, it's possible that officers will seize your computer. For that reason, it's best not to run your exit relay in your home or using your home Internet connection.  Instead, consider running your exit relay in a commercial facility that is supportive of Tor. Have a separate IP address for your exit relay, and don't route your own traffic through it.  Of course, you should avoid keeping any sensitive or personal information on the computer hosting your exit relay, and you never should use that machine for any illegal purpose.     The CG model, if set up as a formal business, should have standard liability protections analogous to those of an ISP. The only legally ""bulletproof"" defense, of course, is to hire a good lawyer to get your shit protected from Day 1, but not everyone can afford that - we may be able to find a more efficient use of resources by collectively hiring lawyers to assemble a LegalZoom-esque contract template, or some other such solution, so that the cost is amortized among a larger group, and a non-issue for newcomers to the industry.  On the other hand, the state has a monopoly on force. You can, legally, have all the liability protections of a traditional ISP, and burn months in jail while your totalitarian overlords decide whether your business is a legitimate one - which they do by disabling, confiscating, searching, and gratuitously damaging your hardware, as they did to Kim Dotcom. I am not saying that this is an impossibility.  However, it's also not unique to this upstream access model - in fact, the CG model is probably the best-defended model, in terms of keeping individuals out of prison. The state will, for the forseeable future, be able to crush any of these systems, if it wants to bad enough. The CG model's business legitimacy gives you more ground to sue the shit out of them afterwards, though, which acts as a deterrent both before (and possibly after) they try it. No, it's not perfect, but probably good as it gets, so shut up and learn you some ""perfect is the enemy of good.""  Furthermore, there's a lot of evidence that it simply won't go that far. This is very analogous to how large, established non-alternet meshes like guifi.net get their upstream access. It works very well for them, and nobody's had legal trouble for it yet - in fact, the companies that provide the upstream access are very successful and respected. Likewise, I'd like to reiterate that nobody's had to deal with any serious grief for running a Tor relay, in all the time that Tor has been a thing (belligerent phone calls/emails notwithstanding). The whole reason that Tor is in untested legal ground is because there has never been an occasion to test it.  Maybe someday things will get worse, and your scenario will be realistic. But that's definitely not the case today, and establishing such businesses now, will give us more traction to prevent exactly that kind of dystopia later. If you are truly worried about getting disappeared by the police, your best way to prevent that is to help legitimize mesh tech now, so that it can't be used as a new and scary bogeyman later."
darknetplan,1mh3tq,Rainfly_X,1 point,Thu Sep 19 00:19:08 2013 UTC,"there are incidents and even in my country, but alas no coverage of them.   I suppose the law is different and much more convoluted in the common wealth. I know a little bit about German/Swiss Law and there is almost nothing to protect you. Our laws assumed a sane executive branch, now that changed. If you set up a cloudy meshnet over a major swiss city and even if you do not reach the minimal number of users to have logging enabled, they just can ""assume that for you"" and you have to install gear and comply with god-knows-what else.  It is one thing if the ähem hillbillies on the mountains organize and get a formal license and/or permit to build a network, it is a completely different if some urbanites want to opt out of the common infrastructure. The state has a threat model and The Whites aren't on that map."
darknetplan,1mh3tq,oelsen,8,Sun Sep 22 20:40:44 2013 UTC,"Many business accounts can be used in this capacity.  So you connect your mesh network like you would any other network, have a single gateway where all traffic must be routed to for internet access.  On that gateway you setup hotspot software or captive portals that people must pay to go through."
darknetplan,1mh3tq,firedrow,3,Mon Sep 16 03:58:32 2013 UTC,"A meshnet based on cjdns doesn't give other nodes access to the internet, it gives them access to the meshnet. The internet and meshnet can be thought of as two separate networks. While it is possible to run either over each other, they speak two different languages and can not be combined like that (nor is it meant to be combined like that)."
darknetplan,1mh3tq,werecat,4,Mon Sep 16 02:51:47 2013 UTC,"Yes, I understand how cjdns works, I'm asking more about general mesh networks utilized as a way to provide free internet access.  The reason I ask, is because it seems very cost-prohibitive, as most ISPs terms of service says you cannot share your internet access outside your household."
darknetplan,1mh3tq,werecat,2,Mon Sep 16 02:54:16 2013 UTC,"The idea is to move away from the internet in general. While that isn't conceivable in what will likely be a long time, it is possible to be connected to both simultaneously, although I digress.  The main issue with what you are suggesting is that internet isn't free. The way it has been built up, you'll end up having to pay someone for internet access, no matter what. Additionally, if you give out free internet, someone is going to abuse it in some way. That is simply the nature of things these days.  There is a solution to giving internet access over a meshnet however. While it wouldn't be free, it would be possible to get some sort of datacenter access with a bunch of IP's and implement the ipTunnel feature of cjdns to sell internet to meshnet users. I would see that as a profitable business model and a good way to transition from the internet to the meshnet."
darknetplan,1mh3tq,werecat,3,Mon Sep 16 03:06:17 2013 UTC,"Eh, I think I'm mistating the questions then. People have already done what I'm asking about, they just haven't shared how it's done.  Certain municipalities have had meshnets pop up that offered metered/reduced quality free, and full paid access to the internet.  I'm wondering how these meshnets were capable of maintaining upstream access without going bankrupt, seeing how you have to make deals with behemoth ISPs, I cannot fathom how a tiny meshnet organization can have any sort of footing."

As long as the person isn't getting charged per gigabyte/doesn't have a limit, they would likely not notice much difference. They could even set a bandwidth limit for people using it.  The problem is, as I pointed out in my previous comment, that if the service is free, it will be abused."

If allowing someone else to dictate my ability to access the internet to me is not a problem, why would I bother with a meshnet at all instead of just using traditional internet access options?  Incidentally, there is a solution, and it's even been implemented on Hyperboria: a TOR bridge. By giving people access to TOR, you can give them access to the internet (though not perhaps particularly fast access) without having to concern yourself with abuse issues."

The first couple of links are going to be our learning experiences, so we might as well start planning a bit.  My hope is to eventually put together a small organization made up of interested locals, gather together some financing (I have some ideas for that), and then approach the owners of some of the taller buildings about placing small, independent (solar powered, wireless connected, no need to connect to the buildings infrastructure) nodes with good size omni-directional antennas in strategic locations (i.e. support our community project, it'll be a feather in your public relations cap). This would make for a nice ""bootstrap"" mesh that others around Sacramento could easily connect to.  I've already been evaluating hardware options for such nodes, and I believe they could be built for under $300 a piece."
darknetplan,1memnm,HyperGrundy,1 point,Sun Sep 15 20:05:02 2013 UTC,"Im out in Rancho, so a direct network may not be possible until more people get involved. I am still learning this stuff but I woukd like to look into bringing the costs down a bit more. I think more people woukd be willing to join if we get the costs down more. What all is involved in creating a node? I know you need a computer running linux with some software, a router with some other software, and antenae, and so routing hardware. Im just not sure on the specifics as I just came across this a few days ago"
darknetplan,1memnm,HyperGrundy,1 point,Mon Sep 16 21:07:11 2013 UTC,"Lincoln??? Shit, yeah, it's going to be a while before there's a link up there. More likely you'll be on a separate local net linked by VPN.   I am still learning this stuff but I woukd like to look into bringing the costs down a bit more.   That under $300 quote was not the cost of getting someone connected, I think you misunderstood. In fact, I'm beginning to suspect that you are even newer to this then I realized, so it may be best for you to just forget that for a moment.  In reality, nothing is needed except a computer with a WiFi radio and CJDNS running. That's going to have poor range, though (being close to the ground, inside your house, and using a small antenna), and every time you reboot you will be disconnected.  A better, if more expensive, option is to have an externally mountable WiFi device with a better antenna and a small always on computer (a mini home server basically) to act as a separate node, then when you boot your computer it just has to connect to your local node. That way, others nearby who connect through you will not be constantly thrown offline every time you have to reboot. :)  Still, how expensive it is will vary significantly based on how dense the mesh is. If you are right in the middle of a bunch of nodes, it hardly matters if you're just using the internal WiFi in your laptop and nothing more, but if you are many miles away from the nearest other node, you may need to spend hundreds of dollars on a powerful radio, large high gain beam antenna, and mast to mount on your roof, just to get connected at all.  And that's why I was talking about independent solar powered nodes on roofs of tall buildings (what I suggested could be as cheap as under $300). We can set up a skeleton of a meshnet ahead of time that way to act as a ""bootstrap"" to make connecting to the mesh easier (and cheaper) for people nearby."

However not nearly enough.  One way is to rely on a web of trust, in various ways. if you think someone is a conduit for false votes, you get them to follow it up the chain, and/or block them.  Another method is to require liquid representation to be an equal swap( of sorts) reducing the usefullness and desire of extra accounts."
darknetplan,1mcv4r,_78_,1 point,Sat Sep 14 03:29:01 2013 UTC,It seems like the only way to really prevent false voting is to give every verified member of a group (like a citizen) some unique ID. It has to be tied to a real identity.
darknetplan,1mcv4r,bitcloud,2,Sat Sep 14 06:27:46 2013 UTC,"Well, everyone would need to have a keypair. I'm reluctant to rely  on a central authority handing them out though. Id rather go to enforced annual meetings and verify a few random people are really people, along with doing the same for my friends on a more regular basis.  I'm not even sure a  ""perfect"" system of anti-duplication is necessary, as long as it is made really difficult, with a good chance of getting caught. I'm up for helping reprimand anyone who is helping maintain dupeIDs.  Sure is an open problem though!"
darknetplan,1mcv4r,bitcloud,2,Sat Sep 14 07:56:51 2013 UTC,This is interesting -- can you elaborate/speculate on this a bit more? Can you point to any existing models of this sort of web of trust implementation?
darknetplan,1mcv4r,dragon_fiesta,3,Sat Sep 14 16:32:21 2013 UTC,"In a little more detail, you could rate your contacts list by how much you trust them. Or perhaps put them into groups with various permissions/automated reactions (such as auto sharing their posts, or giving you a notification to see if you want to share, perhaps just to ignore unless you manually check).  Having a a trust rating would let you check how much you trust a distant member of the network by several methods. Masking, where you are shown the lowest link. Multiplying, (so, if someone two hops away the links being at 0.6 and 0.9 their trust is 0.54. Just multiply each hops ranking)  If a F2F network, there could be a number of public social awards you can display about contacts, such as a vouch saying they would not not game the system, or even they would not vouch for anyone to game the system.  Off the top of my head - The vouching system on couch-surfing is something of an example.  I must admit, I'm not really aware of existing models, answers I give would only be from googling or wikipedia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_of_trust  I will keep on working on it. I'm hopeing as often happens when I get going on a great idea for a game, someone else releases a fully formed version of the idea I'm only getting going with.  Just about all the Ideas I'm after already exist in practice just not in the same/compatable system."
darknetplan,1mcv4r,OmicronNine,3,Sat Sep 14 19:09:19 2013 UTC,"I've been thinking along these lines too and it seems the closest model to look knot isn't social networking, but rather the bitcoin model.

darknetplan,1mcv4r,dragon_fiesta,1 point,Sat Sep 14 13:30:47 2013 UTC,"Indeed - in many ways, it is. I hardly touched upon that, except mentioning DHTs and saying distributed when I mean decentralised.  The main reasion that is not the route I am following, is I have less confidence of getting a system along those lines working any time soon, by myself at least!  Also, from some (hopefully flawed) thinking, the ""blockchain"" for a system like this would require too many terabytes of data to implement the exact bitcoin model (a complete global blockchain). There are several possible solutions to this issue  However that is not to say that being closer to bitcoin than frendica is wrong!  I posted about maidsafe the other day, it is a distrubited network, not just decentralised. It came from maidsafe-dht, a dht network originally for punching holes in NAT (I think) but has grown into a private/public file storage system, hopefully to replace many systems from dropbox to facebook!  There are a few other areas a social network is closer, such as discouragement from having ""puppet"" accounts, where as on bitcoin, it just makes sense. Also having bi-directional categorised data links with friends."

Or you need that stuff for not dying, the stuff you can't make yourself if you are constantly traveling and that can therefore only be obtained in ways that are tracked, monitored and taxed by the government... what was it? Oh yeah. Food.  Oh, and then there is the fact that your rights as a land owner are just that. Rights. Your rights as a traveler on public roads, on the other hand, are practically non-existent, as use of said roads is considered a privilege and not a right. Taking someone's land is possible, yes, but far harder then taking someone's vehicle and/or the belongings in that vehicle."

And the mesh network would become a replacement for the internet. also that topology would be much harder to police. the result would be a ""wild west"" of sorts. some type of DNS would be needed to help non-geeks to use it with ease and that would help prevent easy access to bad things. you would at least need to know the address to go to them.

America is massive, part of the reason these telecoms succeed and meshnets will be difficult to spread across the entire country is the sheer distance between some people. Expanding to meet everyone would require a lot of long distance physical infrastructure, and with that distance comes rising cost."
darknetplan,1m9ema,kivan117,1 point,Thu Sep 12 21:13:51 2013 UTC,"If the cost is distributed in a communist sort of way, where each person needs a little bit of capital, the cost does not seem so high. businesses could be set up which sell their expert services (and recommended equipment) for getting hooked up to the Hyperboria.  It is not really too much to ask for a person to spend maybe $200-400 on a parabolic dish and a few other things to get hooked up. Or maybe some cat 6/fiber if the run is not too long. And the software could have node preferences, that way users could set physical nodes to be preferred over the Internet, and use only the Internet nodes as a backup.

Compared to unending subscription service fees a few hundred in hardware cost would actually save you money in the long run. Connecting all the local meshes in each town and the rural individuals will be the challenge."

There is not really any good ways for companies and corporations to make investments and expect some kind of return, whereas the Internet already exists and is known to make a return (then don't forget the issues that might arise from random corporations owning huge swaths of the network.).  It's so close, all the right things are falling into place (the software is getting good enough to start, the political climate is right, people are scared...), everything except capital."
darknetplan,1m9ema,pushme2,4,Fri Sep 13 07:01:48 2013 UTC,"So your question is, how can a meshnet work in a suburban, hilly, area?  I would think this actually helps. You put the wireless tower on top of the hill, and the surrounding homes can all connect to it. That wireless tower can then have a high-bandwidth link to other wireless towers on other hills which it can see."
darknetplan,1m9ema,vacuu,3,Thu Sep 12 20:10:03 2013 UTC,"This would ideally be the concept.  There are a couple of concerns...   Funding (obviously).  However I think projects like this could easily be crowdsourced, especially if people are pissed off at their lack of internet freedom. If these companies can (potentially) manipulate the government to get rid of net neutrality to begin with, what's to stop them from coming up with some bullshit FCC law that says meshnet hub towers are now illegal for no valid reason? Maintenance.  This one would be fairly easy.  With recent advances in solar panels, especially the flexible ones, I imaging powering and maintaining large hub towers would be relatively simple compared to the other hurdles.   The biggest worry, however, with a centralized hub like a tower is that some entity could eventually gain control over it financially/legally.  Hubs create the problem of needing a ""trusted party"" of sorts to mesh the mesh network.  That opens up a whole world of concerns that the new, fully established high bandwidth mesh network would suddenly become privatized.  If this ""tower hub"" model became a reality, it would have to be explicitly defined from the ground up as the property of some kind of trust, so it couldn't be abused long term."
darknetplan,1m9ema,mappum,2,Thu Sep 12 20:24:42 2013 UTC,"Tower hubs would be cheapest/most efficient, but point-to-point peering with neighbors can also be done, it just takes more hardware per space."
darknetplan,1m9ema,mappum,3,Thu Sep 12 21:58:23 2013 UTC,I could see it working on a small scale.  But then you have the vast expanses of land.  I think it's important for a long term mesh network to have the capability to reach people in remote locations.  I know the tech isn't here quite yet but I think it will be within the next 20 years or so.
darknetplan,1m9ema,dicknuckle,2,Fri Sep 13 00:16:01 2013 UTC,"That will actually be pretty easy, Ubiquiti makes dishes that can do a 50km 150Mbps MIMO link for less than $200 (counting both sides)."
darknetplan,1m9ema,fyoory,2,Fri Sep 13 00:49:43 2013 UTC,"Holy shit batman. You just made me realize how cheap their midrange stuff is. Totally doable! I also think wired mesh routers would be extremely benefical to the mesh projects using off-the-shelf semi-pro grade radios for long point to point links. That would move the brains of the operation off the radios, and down on the ground. Would work wonders for mesh hubs, which will be needed in the beginning of any mesh project like this."
darknetplan,1m9ema,interfect,3,Fri Sep 13 04:51:05 2013 UTC,Don't neglect good antennas.  Use directionals for long range and an omni for the short.
darknetplan,1m9ema,dicknuckle,3,Fri Sep 13 02:28:41 2013 UTC,"Ubiquity sells some long-range wireless gear that actually is fairly similar to cell technology. The point of meshnet isn't necessarily to do everything with consumer-grade equipment. It's about networking actual people, many of whom seem to have absurd equipment budgets. And Internet privilege.  You also can just go out and lay fiber, which is much cheaper when you don't need to disassemble and rebuild roads in order to bury it. The meshnet doesn't have to be wireless everywhere if it doesn't make engineering sense."
darknetplan,1m9ema,dirtydave71,2,Fri Sep 13 06:30:06 2013 UTC,"I'm also in a rural/semi-rural area. A couple of us plan to use point-to-point links to get small towns connected, and branch off from there. We are starting with a WISP model to fund the project and so we can put more energy toward it, graduate to mesh as an expansion of our free option of service. We plan on having a low-bandwidth free tier of service in the beginning (200kbit or so) and as we grow, expand that bandwidth and encourage use of mesh tech. The plan is offer support and such for paying customers and a push in the right direction for new meshers. The free service has senior citizens in mind so they aren't being gouged by verizon DSL for $60 a month, many of whom are on fixed income."

darknetplan,1lu4qq,SoCo_cpp,10,Fri Sep 6 18:57:06 2013 UTC,"These are just a brand of 900 MHz radios. This frequency is very slow, but has high ranges and penetration. Despite the article, most 900 Mhz advertise up to 20 miles with line of sight. With an antenna on a 15 foot pole, you can realistically expect more than a mile with line of sight. They also penetrate foliage and other non-metallic structures a bit, much better than Wifi. The problem is the low data rate. Many support 115200 baud as a max. Also, a rush of traffic related and smart meters have flooded the unregulated 900MHz band in many urban areas. Interference may be troublesome in many areas. Especially in Canada where they try to keep infrastructure from interfering with Wifi, by pushing more to use 900 Mhz. This pushes lots of traffic cameras to transmit video over 900 as well traffic synchronization and monitoring data. Pair that with industrial factories, railroad, and smart meters, and you have a largely flooded frequency in many areas.  -- I work in a traffic related industry using 900 MHz radios in many locations in the US and Canada."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,tlalexander,5,Fri Sep 6 15:06:19 2013 UTC,"Actually, a big reason everyone has been pushing to 900-928MHz is due to how crowded the 2.4GHz spectrum is. 2.4GHz was given to consumers because normal microwave ovens already radiate so much noise at 2.4GHz that they didn't want to use that spectrum for critical stuff. And then WiFi happened (2.4GHz) and everyone's homes is loaded with even more noise there. There's also bluetooth and a lot of other home products that operate at 2.4GHz, because it's the lowest frequency that operates worldwide (the committees developing standards developed faster than the technology to cheaply communicate at 2.4GHz).  Our data rate is low, but not as low as you suggest. We need to add more information to our Kickstarter page (it's on our website), but we have a max data rate of 1.2Mbps, though we're still determining the range for that. Calculations show that we should be able to do 30kbps at 2km, we've just been conservative until we can find the time to hit a bigger chunk of free space (we have to use Google earth to find testing locations, and we found one in Santa Cruz 30 minutes away we'd like to hit).  These days, every radio band has a lot going on, but 2.4GHz is incredibly crowded with all the consumer products that have been sold at that frequency for over 10 years. Significantly fewer consumer products operate at 900-928 MHz, and smart meters, i would hope, aren't transmitting all the time or that would be a weird design. Even if they were though, Flutter has quite a few provisions for noise resistance, just like all the other products that already operate in crowded bands.  Also range isn't related to just frequency, it's frequency, output power, input sensitivity, and the noise rejection characteristics of the chip. This isn't a high power system so we can't do 20 miles, but remember, this is primarily for Arduino users.  if you guys like it though, we have an option to design a high power output version that would transmit at the maximum legally allowed power output for that band (1w), which would increase the max range to over 10km and allow much higher data rates at ranges like 1km."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,IWillNotBeBroken,2,Fri Sep 6 17:32:05 2013 UTC,"2.4GHz was given to consumers because normal microwave ovens already radiate so much noise at 2.4GHz that they didn't want to use that spectrum for critical stuff.   Yes and no.  Yes, interference from Industrial, Scientific, and Medical uses is why the ISM bands were allocated; but no, your timing of microwaves already being commonplace and splattering all over 2.4GHz doesn't fit.  From a US proposal of the Dec 1947 International Radio Conference: (page 464 of the pdf, any typos are mine since I had to transcribe it)    INDUSTRIAL, SCIENTIFIC, MEDICAL   This service involves the radio transmission of energy and therefore represents a potential source of harmful interference to radio communication services.  The apparatus for which frequencies are proposed permits the achievement of many unique accomplishments.  The industrial apparatus is used, among other things, for the rapid drying of glued joints and plywood, controlled surface hardening of metals and curing of rubber, plastics and wood in important industries.  A recent important development of industrial apparatus is an electronic cooker which not only cooks foods evenly from the inside out, but completes the cooking process in a matter of seconds as compared to minutes with older methods.  Scientific apparatus is used for laboratory testing of materials and equipments.  Medical apparatus provides a new instrument for surgical operations and also permits careful regulation of induced artificial fever or local heating in patients.  The plan is recommended by the United States provides for certain discrete frequencies, with appropriate guard bands, for those industrial scientific and medical devices which cannot be shielded effectively.  This assures a minimum disruption of vital communication services.  The allocation of frequencies for this purpose is justified because of the tremendous investments in equipment and the public demand for the various services performed, together with the harmful interference to radio communications which would result if such devices were scattered indiscriminately throughout the spectrum.  The frequencies proposed are:  [ 13.66MHz, 27.32MHz, 40.98MHz, 2.45GHz ] (fuck typesetting and kilocycles)   2.4GHz was allocated in 1947, which is right around when someone had the bright idea of applying microwave technology to food preparation (a chocolate bar melting in Percy Spencer's pocket while he was working on an active radar set).  As for the microwave oven,    An early commercial model introduced in 1954 consumed 1.6 kilowatts and sold for US$2,000 to US$3,000 ($17,000 to $26,000 in today's dollars). Raytheon licensed its technology to the Tappan Stove company of Mansfield, Ohio in 1952.[7] They tried to market a large, 220 volt, wall unit as a home microwave oven in 1955 for a price of US$1,295 ($11,098 in today's dollars), but it did not sell well. In 1965, Raytheon acquired Amana. In 1967, they introduced the first popular home model, the countertop Radarange, at a price of US$495 ($3,408 in today's dollars).   So it took 20 years for their prediction of the public's demand of microwave ovens (among the other ISM uses) to turn out to be true, but it was allocated back in the ""That's neat... but nowhere near commercially viable"" days."

darknetplan,1lu4qq,k8mnstr,2,Tue Sep 10 13:09:21 2013 UTC,"Sorry, it's early and my coffee hasn't entirely caught up with me yet.  Your concern is that in urban areas where an influx of smart meters is overcrowding the ISM band? At least here in the US the 915Mhz is relatively vacant; it's partly why we chose to step away from the overcrowded 2.4/5.2GHz bands (in addition to the added range). We have plans in the works to do caravan and other urban field testing but our initial tests haven't uncovered an issue using consumer 915Mhz as of yet."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,SoCo_cpp,3,Fri Sep 6 15:19:38 2013 UTC,"My main concern is the slow data rate. I did bring up that in areas such as Canada, where they discourage use of Wifi bands, that 900 MHz saturation appears like it is starting to be a problem already.  You could expect a smaller but comparable effect in urban US areas, eventually. Traffic and street cameras are becoming extremely common in the traffic industry. Of course, if you had to go wireless, you definitely wouldn't want the low data rate of 900 MHz for your video stream; Wifi bands would be more ideal. In Canada, they are transmitting traffic camera streams over 900 MHz due to pressure to avoid interrupting Wifi bands. You can imagine the encoding and frame rate throttling fun it takes to stream video at around 115200 and more commonly 9600 baud."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,k8mnstr,3,Fri Sep 6 15:46:48 2013 UTC,"Absolutely. We know that even at our best range Flutter's application isn't for high data rate projects. This is a hobbyist product meant for applications where you'd want to use an Arduino but need the benefit of wireless communications. We support mesh because mesh is really important: devices should be able to communication with each other.  Everyone has always talked about ""Internet of Things"" but honestly your toaster doesn't need to be connected to the cloud. It would be cool, however, if your toaster could talk to your coffee pot and report/coordinate data so food prep is easier.  Most Arduino projects only need to communicate at a rate of 30Kbps which our device can do at very long distances. One of our initial tests was in excess of 800 meters, and we ran out of physical road before we ran out of range.  This project is for makers and hobbyists who need wireless without having to be tethered to a router. Anything from measuring moisture/light/humidity levels in a greenhouse to monitoring your microbrew setup in the back barn to building a wireless torque wrench is possible with our product, and you needn't more than a few kbps to do it.  For projects that DO need slightly higher throughput (first person POV, quadcopters, etc) the 1.2Mbps should be more than sufficient for those needs, too."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,tlalexander,3,Fri Sep 6 16:10:04 2013 UTC,"You correlate 900MHz to ""low data rate"", but radio frequency and data rate are generally not related (there are some side effects to using a given frequency, like 2.4GHz is slowed more by water in tree's leaves, etc), but in general, frequency doesn't determine data rate. http://forums.anandtech.com/showthread.php?t=2051027  That said, we do have a 915MHz system, and this one offers lower data rates than many 2.4GHz systems, but that was due to the radio chip designer's motivations, not ours (and we chose it because it meets the needs of our product). For the chip family we are using, you actually get higher data rates with the 915Mhz chip than you do with their 2.4GHz chip, since that's how they designed it.  Just wanting to make sure people don't confuse frequency with data rate!  And you say ""pressure to avoid wifi"", which was probably true - I wouldn't want to build a system where every consumer's home was throwing out noise in the bands I was using. That's a huge reason we're using 915Mhz."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,SoCo_cpp,2,Fri Sep 6 17:39:04 2013 UTC,"I was under the understanding that frequency does limit potential throughput, but I may be wrong about that. Obviously that would be impacted on modulation techniques.  I do know that ZigBee has a defined rate of 250 kbit/s and most 900 MHz radios are designed for about half that or less from my experience. This is very slow compared to typical Wifi throughputs.  Typical Wifi throughputs:  802.11a on 5 GHz 27Mbits/s 802.11b on 2.4 GHz 5Mbits/s 802.11g on 2.4 GHz 22Mbits/s (better type of modulation)"
darknetplan,1lu4qq,tlalexander,2,Fri Sep 6 18:30:05 2013 UTC,"4G cellular radios operate in the 700MHz band on some carriers and get tens of Mb per second, it just depends on modulation, output power, and sensitivity. Mostly wifi has more complex modulation and I think usually more power."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,gordallott,5,Tue Sep 17 19:16:40 2013 UTC,"potentially silly idea, but you could run key exchanges over a network like this, to avoid ISP level MITM attacks, then have the bandwidth of your regular internet connection/whatever else handle the bulk of the data, encypted with the keys you get over this kind of network.  kind of like the concept behind quantum cryptography. you exchange keys on a different platform to your main line."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,MidwestJackalope,4,Fri Sep 6 10:41:11 2013 UTC,"Properly implemented asymmetric encryption methods can safely negotiate a handshake over a hostile network. TLS/SSL is one example that still hypothetically works, but the NSA has made an effort to capture the private keys (which never travel over the network) allowing them to sniff the symmetric key handled in the handshake.   Any broadcast (wifi, Zigbee, etc.) can be listened to. The question is can it be decrypted. The only advantage to this versus the public internet is that it's geographically limited in scope."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,gordallott,2,Fri Sep 6 15:02:13 2013 UTC,"My idea is more akin to trying to avoid man in the middle attacks by avoiding the man in the middle.   It would still be vulnerable to a highly co-ordinated attack, but in the classical Alice, Bob and Mallory sense, Mallory never has chance to get at the keys exchanged because they were sent via Carol. of course Carol could change they keys, but she doesn't see the data."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,MidwestJackalope,2,Fri Sep 6 15:21:13 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately you're trading one semi-private transport layer (routed Internet traffic) for another (wireless broadcast). I'm not sure there are any known attacks (specifically by the intel agencies) that this avoids, but I'll keep an open mind as more becomes known about the specific attack vectors."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,SkyPL,2,Fri Sep 6 15:41:36 2013 UTC,"I'd say that wimax is much more feasible right now. Not only it's a proven technology, but also quite widely adopted. (though obviously it doesn't have such a long range)"
darknetplan,1lu4qq,shadowed_stranger,3,Fri Sep 6 20:47:41 2013 UTC,WiMax has a much longer range and data rate than this.
darknetplan,1lu4qq,dokumentamarble,2,Fri Sep 6 22:25:07 2013 UTC,For the same power usage?
darknetplan,1lu4qq,SkyPL,2,Fri Sep 6 23:10:41 2013 UTC,"is power usage really a concern? I thought it was about having long range and decent connection speed. WiMAX offers both - this ""new thing"" got only a decent range. Also it's not really a ""darknet enabler"" when there's no available hardware to support it.   Look how old WiMAX is and how it's adopted - not nearly as well as it could have been considering all of the advantages it brings. So even if that guy would release any working hardware - we'll still be MILES before we'd be able to build any useful network infrastructure with that.  Now consider the speed limitation - with each year we need more and more of that, so with each year a value of Flutter goes down and down.  IMHO it will be useless before enough hardware is manufactured to fully support it."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,dokumentamarble,2,Sat Sep 7 07:36:04 2013 UTC,"But that is true of any new hardware.  You could have said the same thing about wimax when it first came out.  And yes power usage is a concern.  If your 5watt can out perform my 1 watt radio... then it's not really a fair comparison is it.  Also depending on the frequencies being used,  there are different power transmit limits (legally). Also if I wanted to setup a solar node,  the power efficient choice would be better."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,SkyPL,1 point,Sat Sep 7 15:47:33 2013 UTC,"Ok, agreed - with solar nodes it might be important. But anything else than that? I think there are many, many more important factors. Most of which Flutter fails.  And - no, not every new hardware is slow by default."

Absolutely.  Also, our tests have been performed with omni directional antennae. We're planning on doing testing with unidirectional antennae in the near future."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,shadowed_stranger,2,Fri Sep 6 08:02:07 2013 UTC,"Perhaps sub dialup speeds (600kbits = 75kbps) can work well enough to enable basic html services for a start? After all, the darknet has aims additional to merely providing huge amounts of bandwidth for the downloading of stuff."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,tlalexander,3,Fri Sep 6 14:23:54 2013 UTC,"Some problems with this:   600kbits is 10 times the fastest dialup speeds, 20 times the typical speeds.  Not sub dialup. That is the MAXIMUM data rate.  That means at a few feet with no line of sight interference. The maximum advertised range of this device is half a mile, not a mile.  Semantics, but whatever. Considering that this is a MESH network, the speed isn't just YOUR internet speed, it's the speed of everyone else using you for transit as well.   Now, this device currently uses a Texas Instruments CC1101* for the radio chip.  This chip's rx sensitivity is -116 dBm at 0.6 kBaud, 433 MHz with a 1% packet error rate.  It gets worse though.  The flutter device is tuned for 915mhz, at which the chip's rx sensitivity is at least -112dBm if not worse.  That means you need twice the 'signal strength' at the higher frequency.  Not disappointed yet?  That data rate is BEST CASE, and you will have much much lower at your end after everything else is taken into account.  Depending on modulation it could even be MUCH lower.  Now let's put these numbers in perspective for you.  0.6kbit/s a 1% PER is about 1% of dialup speeds.  You would need 100 of these to equal a single dialup modem.  Sure, they get faster when you get closer, but what's the point then?  Even at best this device is much slower than even 802.11b wifi, and at closer ranges.  'But what about for long ranges?'  This is the problem with 'mesh solutions'.  The long range backbones will also need to be the high speed backbones, since more people will be funneling data through a fewer number of channels.  Remember that 1/100th dialup speed I mentioned?  That's not just YOUR internet speed, it would be the combined total speed of everyone using that portion of the mesh.  This is NOT going to happen with cheap omni radios, no matter how much you people want it to.  Period.  *They are trying to remake the board for the newer TI CC1200, which will improve these numbers across the board a bit, but the overall picture stays the same."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,2cats2hats,3,Fri Sep 6 08:57:58 2013 UTC,"So, I need to respond inline, as this is just too many incorrect assumptions that add up to some weird terrible story.  first, for everyone (up thread), 1kbps = 1 kilobit per second. 1kBps = 1 kilobyte per second (8x as much, a byte is 8 bits)  The only difference is a capital B. Lower case b means bits, upper case B means bytes. That's been the standard for a while, but it seems to trip a lot of people up.  Flutter's max data rate is 600kbps now. Dial-up was 56kbps max. We are also planning on shipping boards with a new radio with higher sensitivity and higher max data rate of 1250kbps, or 1.2Mbps.  This product wasn't designed for mesh-based internet users, but we do think that it would be useful for building fully encrypted mesh nets in emergency situations. To get decent range, you need to operate the mesh at lower data rates, like 30-100kbps. That's not streaming Netflix, but it can do Email, twitter, a quick facebook update - in an emergency, you don't need lots of data, you just need a reliable connection. We also have an option for a long range amplifier add on that would improve data rates at any range and increase max range to 10km! That's probably something we're going to eventually offer, but the more support we have now, the more likely that possibility is!  Anyway, your notes:   Some problems with this: 600kbits is 10 times the fastest dialup speeds, 20 times the typical speeds. Not sub dialup. That is the MAXIMUM data rate. That means at a few feet with no line of sight interference.   Wait, a few feet? We did a super quick test over the weekend and got 300Kbps at 160m. A directional antenna can improve that even more, though I'm being told by our testing house that unless the antenna is approved, we're not allowed to tell you you can use one (so I think we'll try to certify a directional antenna too).   The maximum advertised range of this device is half a mile, not a mile. Semantics, but whatever. Considering that this is a MESH network, the speed isn't just YOUR internet speed, it's the speed of everyone else using you for transit as well.   If doing community internet. You can still operate your own personal network and have the bandwidth to yourself (though if everyone at burning man tried that in a 1km area, eventually you can saturate the band). And a note on interference - the interfering signal has to be somewhat close to or more powerful than the signal you're trying to receive or it won't bother you. If someone has a Flutter mesh net a couple hundred meters away, they probably aren't going to bother your meshnet. And even if they're on top of eachother, flutter can operate on different channels, and eventually we will add Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, which drastically reduces problems with interference.   Now, this device currently uses a Texas Instruments CC1101* for the radio chip. This chip's rx sensitivity is -116 dBm at 0.6 kBaud, 433 MHz with a 1% packet error rate. It gets worse though. The flutter device is tuned for 915mhz, at which the chip's rx sensitivity is at least -112dBm if not worse. That means you need twice the 'signal strength' at the higher frequency.   What gets worse? You listed off one banal statistic about the device and then said ""it gets worse"". What is wrong with -116dBm sensitivity at 600bps? That's just one listing, there's an entire table of operational characteristics. Sure, the chip has higher sensitvity at 433MHz, but we can't legally use that band in the US and the antennas would be twice as long. You say at 915 MHz the sensitivity is -112dBm ""if not worse"", but what's bad about that number? You literally can't tell a single thing about the operation of the system from that data point.   Not disappointed yet?    I mean, no, not really.   That data rate is BEST CASE, and you will have much much lower at your end after everything else is taken into account. Depending on modulation it could even be MUCH lower.   Which data rate? 600kbps is best case on our prototypes, 1250kbps on our new boards. And depending on modulation it could be lower? Could you expand on that? I'm not really sure what specifically you're getting at with that.   Now let's put these numbers in perspective for you. 0.6kbit/s a 1% PER is about 1% of dialup speeds. You would need 100 of these to equal a single dialup modem.   ...only if you operate at the lowest possible data rate. Radio chips have better sensitivity at lower data rates (that's how radio works) so you must have been reading the part of the datasheet where they just list off the best case sensitivity levels, which would all be at a low data rate. Have you read the rest of the datasheet? It's got sensitivity values for every data rate. I've read it through several times and would be happy to answer any questions you have, but it really sounds like you need to read past the first page.   Sure, they get faster when you get closer, but what's the point then? Even at best this device is much slower than even 802.11b wifi, and at closer ranges.   I think ""slower than wifi"" was actually part of our main pitch - you don't need to stream HD video for your arduino. Mesh internet is just a possible use of the product, but we fully admit that until we get the high power transmit modules, you're going to have a somewhat slow network. But again, sending a tweet that says ""the syrian leadership has taken over our headquarters"" doesn't take much bandwidth. We should go range test tonight at 60kbps and see what we get. You can probably do a km line of sight at that data rate but we need to test first.   'But what about for long ranges?' This is the problem with 'mesh solutions'. The long range backbones will also need to be the high speed backbones, since more people will be funneling data through a fewer number of channels. Remember that 1/100th dialup speed I mentioned?   I do remember it, but it was a weirdly incorrect interpretation of the datasheet. Also, remember the part where these are $20? Buying a lot isn't necessarily a problem.   That's not just YOUR internet speed, it would be the combined total speed of everyone using that portion of the mesh. This is NOT going to happen with cheap omni radios, no matter how much you people want it to. Period.   I mean, if it's me in the woods with some friends and we want some kind of data connection while playing paintball, these may work great for that. But no, they're not going to be the end all solution for consumer wireless mesh networking. Trust me, I want to displace Verizon, but this it not a 4G competitor. I designed the product and I'm telling you, whoever suggested we could use this as a community backbone would be incorrect, but your assessment has also been woefully incorrect in many areas, so don't lambast them so much for jumping to conclusions, you did the same.   *They are trying to remake the board for the newer TI CC1200, which will improve these numbers across the board a bit, but the overall picture stays the same.   Why do you say ""trying""? The radio chip just came out, but we've got samples and are designing new boards. The prototypes you see in the video were designed in about a week, so I'm not sure if ""trying"" is a fair choice of words.  We're just trying to make an awesome open source product. My original goal for this was to dispel the air of inaccessibility for wireless in open source. If there's any confusion or questions, lets work together to dispel the confusion and answer the questions, not create misinformation."

darknetplan,1lu4qq,tlalexander,1 point,Fri Sep 6 21:56:39 2013 UTC,"Hi there.  First off, (Not only to you, but to everyone reading this) I am a HUGE fan of Flutter.  If you look at the backers email addresses for your largest (skynet) package I was the first person to back it on day one.  Second, none of my issues are with flutter, but as flutter's use as creating 'the meshnet'.  I'm not trying to be an ass, but I don't think you understand what this subreddit is about.  The whole point of this subreddit is to create the exact thing that you said flutter is not.  Many of the people reading this subreddit are like OP in that they see the word 'mesh' and assume it would work for one giant nationwide shared mesh network.   This product wasn't designed for mesh-based internet users   That's the whole purpose of this sub.   Wait, a few feet? We did a super quick test over the weekend and got 300Kbps at 160m. A directional antenna can improve that even more, though I'm being told by our testing house that unless the antenna is approved, we're not allowed to tell you you can use one (so I think we'll try to certify a directional antenna too).   Admittedly, my 'a few feet' claim was exaggerated a bit to help illustrate to OP the contrast between data rate and range.  Most people see 'max range' and 'max data rate' and assume that you can have both.  Remember when you kept hearing about how WiMax was 70 miles and 700mbps?  And directional antennas (for the most part) go against the idea of this sub, creating a mesh network between users that don't know each other.  That is a great point, and one that I repeatedly bring up here though (and even brought up in my last post!), that we won't get real range without one.   If doing community internet.   That's the whole purpose of this sub.  Again, I wasn't trying to paint a horrible picture of flutter, but of it's use as a citywide router.   You can still operate your own personal network and have the bandwidth to yourself (though if everyone at burning man tried that in a 1km area, eventually you can saturate the band).   Now make this city-wide or country-wide, and you see the point I'm getting at.   And a note on interference - the interfering signal has to be somewhat close to or more powerful than the signal you're trying to receive or it won't bother you. If someone has a Flutter mesh net a couple hundred meters away, they probably aren't going to bother your meshnet. And even if they're on top of eachother, flutter can operate on different channels, and eventually we will add Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum, which drastically reduces problems with interference.   I was going to ask on kickstarter about contention, but didn't bother since you don't seem to be answering many questions there.  Since you're responding here, does flutter have any plans for dealing with interference, or is it simply 'hope it's not strong enough on our channel to bother us'?   What gets worse? You listed off one banal statistic about the device and then said ""it gets worse"". What is wrong with -116dBm sensitivity at 600bps? That's just one listing, there's an entire table of operational characteristics. Sure, the chip has higher sensitvity at 433MHz, but we can't legally use that band in the US and the antennas would be twice as long. You say at 915 MHz the sensitivity is -112dBm ""if not worse"", but what's bad about that number? You literally can't tell a single thing about the operation of the system from that data point.   The data rate is what's worse.  I poorly worded my response in that I didn't mention that that would be the data rate at max range.  Again for a city-wide meshnet, 600 baud isn't going to cut it.  For flutter's purposes that's fine, and I even plan on using my flutter devices at that data rate, but that isn't going to cut it for any medium-large scale internet usage.  You created an awesome project, I understand that you want to get defensive over it, but please understand that I am not ripping on flutter.   I mean, no, not really.   Because you know what it's used for.  Again, I'm not disappointed with it either.  But anyone buying this thinking it will be a replacement for their cable/cell provider will be sorely disappointed.   Which data rate? 600kbps is best case on our prototypes, 1250kbps on our new boards.    Either data rate.  My point to him was that the 'best data rate' isn't the data rate he will get at 1 mile.   And depending on modulation it could be lower? Could you expand on that? I'm not really sure what specifically you're getting at with that.   The TI chip supports several different modulation types.  I've attempted to find out from your team if the flutter device will support changing modulation type via software, but have gotten no response.   ...only if you operate at the lowest possible data rate. Radio chips have better sensitivity at lower data rates (that's how radio works)   Yes, that was the point I was trying to make to OP.  Slowed data == more range.  He listed in the title that it was one mile, and in the comment that I replied to that he thought he would get 600kbps.   so you must have been reading the part of the datasheet where they just list off the best case sensitivity levels, which would all be at a low data rate. Have you read the rest of the datasheet? It's got sensitivity values for every data rate. I've read it through several times and would be happy to answer any questions you have, but it really sounds like you need to read past the first page.   See my last reply.  I understand completely how it works, and I was simply illustrating to OP that he won't get the max bandwidth at the max range, as he seemed to believe.   I think ""slower than wifi"" was actually part of our main pitch - you don't need to stream HD video for your arduino. Mesh internet is just a possible use of the product, but we fully admit that until we get the high power transmit modules, you're going to have a somewhat slow network.

You can probably do a km line of sight at that data rate but we need to test first.   Yet again, you're missing out on the context of this subreddit.  If an entire nationwide mesh network was made of these things, you wouldn't have enough bandwidth to send a ping.   I do remember it, but it was a weirdly incorrect interpretation of the datasheet. Also, remember the part where these are $20? Buying a lot isn't necessarily a problem.   So you're saying you could bond thousands of flutters together as a high speed backbone?  Again, even if they are only $20, it would be more cost (and spectrum) effective to just get a directional microwave.  Even if they are thousands of dollars, it's still cheaper than getting 1000 flutters, more spectrum efficient, WAY more bandwidth, longer range, simply all around better for long range transit purposes.   But no, they're not going to be the end all solution for consumer wireless mesh networking.    That is the whole purpose of this subreddit, and that was exactly what my last post said.  I understand that it's easy to get defensive when you make an awesome product, but take a breath and see exactly what I was saying.   I designed the product and I'm telling you, whoever suggested we could use this as a community backbone would be incorrect, but your assessment has also been woefully incorrect in many areas, so don't lambast them so much for jumping to conclusions, you did the same.   Not to be a dick, but where exactly have I been wrong (other than my exaggeration about data rates)?  I also noticed that in your reply, you didn't mention tested range at 1250kbps (or 600 on the old boards, your choice).  My only jump to conclusions is that I'm assuming that it won't support max data rate from one side of a house to the other.  Again, not a problem for WHAT FLUTTER IS, but a problem if you want to displace 4G and Verizon.   Why do you say ""trying""? The radio chip just came out, but we've got samples and are designing new boards. The prototypes you see in the video were designed in about a week, so I'm not sure if ""trying"" is a fair choice of words.   I say trying because you are.  If you already had succeeded, you would not have mentioned the old chip on your kickstarter.  I did try to make 'trying' sound less bad though, by saying it 'will improve' stats across the board, instead of 'should' or some other wishy washy word.   We're just trying to make an awesome open source product. My original goal for this was to dispel the air of inaccessibility for wireless in open source.    And you succeeded.  I'll say again that I was one of the first to back you at your highest funding level, and I did it on day one.  Flutter is a badass device.   If there's any confusion or questions, lets work together to dispel the confusion and answer the questions, not create misinformation.   I thought that was what I was doing.  I'll repeat myself yet again, that this subreddit is for creating a community/city/country-wide mesh internet network.  Flutter is not the device for that.  In my other posts on this sub I'm equally as critical of people thinking that Linksys Routers are the solution to giant meshnets.  It's not a flutter thing, it's a 'you're going to need to buy real gear' thing.  I'm worried that people will see your post and just see the top part 'He created the device, he says that guy shadowed_stranger is wrong, and posted a really long post so it must be true, I'm going to buy 10 of these and my whole town will have internet at 1200kbit/s, then be disappointed that it doesn't work like that."
darknetplan,1lu4qq,shadowed_stranger,1 point,Fri Sep 6 22:03:15 2013 UTC,"Hey, I appreciate your comments (really). I'm sorry if my tone wasn't really appropriate, I was referred to this subreddit by my partner (who is a long time redditor) and as you very quickly realized, I did not fully understand the context. I came into a thread on the internet with someone saying my product may not be able to get more than a few feet of range at the max data rate, and to be fair, your first non-bulleted line is a simple listing of one technical specification followed by ""it gets worse"" with no explanation as to why you see that specification as a problem. I'd had a lot of non-technical people harping on Flutter without qualifying what they were saying, and when you list TX power and RX sensitivity of a chip at one of its many data rates, say that those numbers are bad, and then don't say why, it feels like an uninformed attack.  I see now that you have a good understanding of these things and given the context of this subreddit, it's clear to me that perhaps those specifications are not over the head of the readers here, it just wasn't clear to me at the time. I understand now that what you meant to say was that no matter what the range and data rate options are, they're not going to be useful for public internet (which I helped clarify by outright saying it), but I did not know your intent at the time. The situation was exacerbated by the QZ article being overly optimistic about Flutter's capabilities versus what I told them (they heard half mile radius and made it ""Mile wide range"" but you and I both know why that not a great way to represent that information). To their credit, they tried to reach out to me to proof it, but with the deluge of mail I got in those first days, I failed to see it until they had posted the article.  Still, thanks for contributing and being such a great early backer. Those first few backer emails that came in were a huge deal to us, and I remember seeing the first skynet pledge right as it came in - we were stoked! Sorry for the delays in communication, I'm the only person on the team that can answer technical questions about the radio capabilities, so there's a lot for me to do.  But the product is completely open, and modulation options will be in there. We'll likely switch up modulation based on data rate (that's what TI does with their pre-canned chip profiles currently), but you'll be able to operate the physical layer any way that you want.  Also, generally I admit that we could have made it clearer how the range works, but we've got users asking how an Arduino works or if this works with WiFi - it can be hard to clearly craft the message in a way people will understand, but I've finally had some time to sit down and start working on an infographic. Communicating the data rate situation is extremely important and I have no interest in misrepresenting the product, it's just been a question of how best to convey the information.  My hope is that customers installing the system at their home can use high data rates indoors, and use a few devices listening at low data rates to receive sensor data from down the property. We're still nailing down exactly how that will work, but I really intend to design this product to take full advantage of how radio works by giving customers the best of the data rate and range situation. I know that's complex, but I don't like simple things.  Thanks for backing us. Throw me some tough questions if you'd like. :)"

I don't feel like re-reading my long-ass post, but I'm pretty sure I said somewhere that I understand how it's easy to get defensive about your product when you make something as awesome as flutter.  Admittedly, I should have probably clarified the context of my post a bit anyway, as even the readers of this sub may take it as saying the device itself is bad.  And no tough questions from me, the modulation question was my only one.  My knowledge of EE/RF is fairly limited.  Okay, maybe one other question.

darknetplan,1lmya4,Rhythmic,42,Tue Sep 3 11:25:42 2013 UTC,"Oh boy.  Ok, you're being led astray by a lot of incomplete and incorrect understandings. First, though, as mentioned elsewhere, if you are looking at a list of the wireless networks that your computer sees, you are almost certainly seeing your neighbors wireless routers, not their wireless cards in their computers. That said, if you are in range of that many wireless routers, you likely are indeed in range of many wireless cards in computers as well.  The answer to your question is that it is possible, and in fact, that's the whole idea.  All you would need is to configure all of them to connect to an open ad-hoc network and make sure they all have the same settings. Next, you install a mesh networking protocol on them such as batman, batman-adv, CJDNS, etc. Any of those would do, though CJDNS is probably your best bet for several reasons, including that you can connect your mesh net to the wider Hyperboria network.  Bam! You now have a working meshnet. Any computers set up this way that are in range of any others will connect to each other via the ad-hoc network, and then their mesh protocol software (CJDNS) will establish meshnet connections over that ad-hoc network. If you are in range of two other computers, but they are not in range of each other, they will not be able to connect directly via the ad-hoc network, but the meshnet software on your computer will pass data back and forth for them according to your protocol of choice, so they can communicate. The result is that everyone who is in range of at least one other member of the mesh can communicate with everyone else on the mesh.  So why all the focus on additional hardware you ask?  Well... that meshnet will, quite frankly, suck. How often do you close your laptop lid and put it to sleep? Do you shut down your computer at night? Also, do you bring your laptop with you to other locations? Every time a member of the meshnet does any of those things, the network is going to suffer. Your meshnet is going to be unstable and unreliable, maybe you'll get online when you need to... maybe not. Depends on whether your neighbor happens to have their laptop on at this moment... and their neighbor as well.  So that's why the focus is on the wireless routers and similar. Small, low power network devices that stay on all the time and act as the ""permanent"" part of the meshnet so that there is always something stable there for your laptop to connect to when you wake it up or turn it on. Yes, the computers will be nodes on the meshnet too, so what you describe will still be the case, but among those wireless nodes will be everyone's wireless routers as well, not just their computers.  Now, for some clarifications and myth busting:   802.11s is a neat and useful protocol... that is not designed for decentralized meshnets like the ones we are discussing, and is supported by almost no hardware currently available anyway. It is a mesh networking extension to the 802.11 protocols, but aimed at commercial users of centrally managed mesh networks. The ""decentralized"" part of decentralized meshnet is the critical part that makes us different, really, not the ""mesh"" part. It's what makes the networks we are working on able to free us from corporate/government control and censorship. That's not to say that 802.11s doesn't have features that would make it a better choice anyway, it does, but as I said it's supported by almost no consumer wireless devices, and it's features, while nice, are not necessary. Ad-hoc wireless networks can connect more then two computers. Any 802.11 wireless devices that are configured with the same settings for a wireless ad-hoc network will, when in range of other similarly configured devices, communicate and establish the ad-hoc network. It is technically point-to-point, however, in that all communications are directly from one computer to another that is in range (i.e. if you are not in range of the computer you want to communicate with, you just can't, even if you are both connected to other members of the network). The devices can be networked and communicate directly with multiple other devices simultaneously. It's purpose is simply to allow direct, MAC level communications with devices in range, like a wireless equivalent to an ethernet switch. The rest has to be handled by additional software (the meshnet protocol software in this case, e.g. CJDNS)."
darknetplan,1lmya4,HyperGrundy,6,Tue Sep 3 18:22:05 2013 UTC,"Well... that meshnet will, quite frankly, suck.   To add to the excellent post above and maybe give a little more insight:  The wifi cards out there are half-duplex. What does that mean? It means that although they can transmit or receive, they can't do both at the exact same time. They alternate between transmitting and receiving rapidly, but they only ever do one or the other at a given time.  Ok, fine. So what does that mean?  It means that every hop in the mesh network cuts the bandwidth in half. Whoa. Think about that. Exponential degradation of the bandwidth for each hop, and for each active node at each hop. Buzzkill.  Now, that additional hardware is full-duplex. That is, it transmits and receives simultaneously, using two separate frequencies/radios. These will form a backbone for the mesh network; half-duplex nodes would connect to full-duplex nodes (or nodes connected to the backbone, at any rate,) so there would be no exponential loss of bandwidth except on the half-duplex edges of the mesh. This means an acceptably performing mesh network.   There's more to it than just that, but that's a practical look at why current hardware is not sufficient."

darknetplan,1lmya4,Douglas77,4,Tue Sep 3 19:58:11 2013 UTC,But this is not de-centralized -- you have a central router.
darknetplan,1lmya4,zArtLaffer,-2,Tue Sep 3 12:51:06 2013 UTC,"An ad hoc network by itself is not enough - even though maybe it could be used as a way for nodes to communicate with each other.  Basically, I'm talking of a software which could use the wifi card to sense other nodes around, open and close connections as they come and go, and then use the connections to forward IP packets.  Thus, each node will act as a router.  In a busy urban area, there will be lots of nodes, many of which will be moving around. The mesh will have to constantly adapt.

There are a lot of hacker-types working on the 802.11s, SDR and even GPRS or Zigbee thingie.  It is easy enough to write software on-top of those drivers to pull off the trick in a number of ways. The legacy issue that you may run into is that various clients and servers assume in their implementations (not that this can't be worked around) that IP addresses, URLs, route-tables and the like are more-or-less fixed (for long-ish periods of time).   For example, your browser doesn't assume that google is moving around every 5 seconds (or more). In fact, for a number of performance reasons, it assumes the opposite. Net-net: you aren't going to have much trouble creating a dynamic/flexible/adaptable store-and-forward packet network. You will have problems with assumptions about fixety that everything else in the stack has."
darknetplan,1lmcsu,LetItBeFree,19,Tue Sep 3 03:14:27 2013 UTC,"Well, lets work backwards from the power requirement of the radios to the sizing of the photovoltaic array.  We can find the power requirements for a common radio, the ubiquiti nanostation loco, see page 5 of this PDF http://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/nanostationm/nsm_ds_web.pdf  So for two radios, we use between 3 watts and 5.5 watts, so:  2 x 3w x 24h = 144wh/day  2 x 5.5w x 24h = 264wh/day   or between 144wh and 264wh per day  Assuming that we don't want to discharge our battery more than 50%, we find that we need a 12v lead acid battery with a capacity of between 24ah and 44ah using a conservative average voltage of 12v.  To fill those batteries with a charge efficiency of 75%, you'd need a panel ranging from a bare minimum of 30w (lowest power figure, in the tropics) to a maximum of 350w (highest power number, december, in seattle). The minimum insolation of the installed area is very important, as you can see in Hawaii we have it much easier than seattle with 4x the power at minimum:  http://stalix.com/isolation.pdf  Most solar design guides suggest 3x to 4x what I've outlined here. It's true that it will maximize the life of your system and guarantee year round reliability. But this is an experiment, not a safety of life system. 80% of the benefit for 20% of the price aligns with what we are trying to accomplish here.  Based on those number ranges, I feel an ""average"" system might be as follows:  60w solar panel $115: http://www.amazon.com/ALEKO%C2%AE-60W-60-Watt-Monocrystalline-Solar/dp/B007YT9222  50ah 12v lead acid $103: http://www.amazon.com/Universal-Power-Group-45979-Battery/dp/B0058PM19K/ref=sr_1_3?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1378199542&sr=1-3&keywords=50ah+lead+acid  10a charge controller $25: http://www.amazon.com/GSM-CYC-SOLC10A-Solar-Charge-Controller/dp/B007798FR2/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1378199590&sr=1-1&keywords=10amp+charge+controller  Two Ubiquiti Nanostation M5 Loco $71: http://www.amazon.com/Ubiquiti-Nanostation-LOCO-Outdoor-802-11n/dp/B004EHSV4W/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&ie=UTF8&qid=1378199634&sr=1-1-catcorr&keywords=nanostation+loco+m5  Total $385, call it $400 with wire, fuse, and hardware."

darknetplan,1lmcsu,gusgizmo,1 point,Wed Sep 18 21:28:06 2013 UTC,Any ideas about radios that use less power? Would a USB wifi dongle work in this kind of system?
darknetplan,1lmcsu,johnny2k,1 point,Fri Sep 13 21:39:52 2013 UTC,"Unfortunately, a USB dongle has no logic driving it. So it's useless without a computer to drive it.  The nanostation radios listed here have an ethernet interface, cpu, memory, and flash storage and run linux. They are ideal for mesh networking because they can run software to keep track of the network state and forward data down the appropriate path.  I really don't see going lower power than 3w per, that's already a very impressive figure. Most of that ends up in the air as radio waves as well, so the actual consumption by the CPU is probably around 1 watt.  It's possible that reducing the clock rate of the CPU, and using larger antennas to allow a reduction in transmit power would facilitate lower power usage out of the same hardware. But this is likely at the cost of performance."
darknetplan,1lmcsu,gusgizmo,2,Sat Sep 14 01:22:07 2013 UTC,"Yes it is possible. I would not recommend repeaters and it is a little expensive but I have done some testing with running the Dusknet units on solar before.   Here is a picture of some of the units. The main Dusknet unit is the one with the long fiberglass antennas on it. Dusknet Pic  The other units pictured include an ""internet in the box"" (black pelican case) and a Cellular network in a box (yellow pelican case). They are all have the ability to run off a portable solar panel system that you can fit in your back pack.   If you want 24 hour running, you will need a battery pack as well. The size of the battery pack and solar panel will depend on what type of gear you are running as well as what power levels do you want to assume as a baseline.   If you have more questions about running gear off of solar just ask."

The board is Laguna GW2388 from Gateworks. The case is a minibox case. The firmware is custom, and will be released soon-ish. We were not happy with the throughput of meshing tech and the fact that we could not use different channels for each radio in the boar that is connected to the backbone also hurt our performance to levels we where not happy with.  The radio configs that you can have it depend on what area you want to deploy this in. We have 8 different Freq we can on each radio, depending on what our spectrum mapping of the area shows us.   We did not go with a Alix board because the Proc is EoL at 2014, so there will not be much demand for them. Also we have talked to others who have deployed setups downrange that have used the Alix boards and they did not have anything nice to say about them.   The setups in the pelican cases are different and use SDRs."
darknetplan,1lmcsu,rapiddarknet,3,Tue Sep 3 18:56:40 2013 UTC,"This is being done and has been done.  Take some time to look on WISP oriented forums and you'll find photos of a lot of remote relay tower setups.  There's WISP equipment you can buy that will manage charging and provide PoE to radios.  This is all going to be with WISP equipment in mind.  If you're thinking something like powering a single openmesh node then it gets quite a bit cheaper and simpler.  If you're two directional radios with an AP you're probably talking about 25W of power required.  So take 25 Watts x 24 hours and you'll need roughly 600Wh a day.  If you're using lead acid batteries then you don't want to drop them below 75% if you can help it so they'll last a couple of years.  You can go to 50% but you'll have to replace them more often.  So we need 600Wh a day x 4 to keep it above the 75% number.  Thats 2400Wh in battery capacity needed.  That's pretty decent for a rough number but what if there is a cloudy day and you don't get a charge.  Well there's your 50% number.  If you have more than one cloudy day you're killing the battery.  That's why you double that capacity.  We're at 4800Wh now which will give us 4 days before the 50% level.  That's good so now to figure out how many Amp hours that translates to.  4800Wh / 12v = 400Ah.  400Ah is a big heavy battery.  We'll run 4 100Ah in parallel to provide that.   A quick search on Amazon for deep cycle solar batteries and we find these  They're $250 each so we're at $1000 just for batteries to make a reliable relay.  Now you've got to keep those batteries charged in a few hours of opportune sunlight.  What do we need to charge the bank in 8 hours?  2400Wh/8 Hours = 300 Watts  300W of solar panels isn't going to be cheap or small then you'll need a charge controller larger than 25 amps to keep the bank charged.  MPPT is more expensive but more efficient with charging though then you'll go to 24v panels and allow the charger to regulate it down to 14v for battery charging.  So a quick search with a reputable vendor and I get these for the panels.  There's another $1053 dollars added to the project for 3 of them.  Now for a charge controller.  I picked an Outback power unit that I've used before.  There's another $515 dollars.  So $2568 just for a decent solar power setup for only the radios in a relay.  This doesn't include any other hardware for mounting, routers, switches, weather proof enclosures, etc.  An actual setup will require a much larger power system to support the networking gear.  WISPs do it all the time, it's nothing special.  If you want a setup that's not a toy and is actually somewhat reliable it will get expensive.  I use to build and deploy mobile data relays for the military.  We used LiFePO4 batteries that were lighter but a lot more expensive.  It's was all COTS equipment and we managed to get 75 to 100mbps through links and sometimes more depending on the environment we set up in.  With the right equipment and a good line of sight It's possible to create a 100km wifi links to pass usable data.  50km is the norm though for decent data rates, if you can get the line of sight.  Here's an example of a remote installation on a mountain top in Ireland though they use a mini wind turbine power it.  Here's another remote installation in Ireland.  A WISP is technically a darknet anyway.  They just use it to carry an Internet connection to customers."
darknetplan,1lmcsu,modzer0,5,Tue Sep 3 05:08:56 2013 UTC,"Ugh, your calculations are correct but the units are all wrong.  Look, it's really simple.   So take 25W/h x 24hours and you'll need roughly 600W/h a day.   25 Watts * 24 hours = 600 Watt hours  Do you see how you multiply the units as well as the numbers?  Now look at this: 25 Watts in Watt hours per day  You can divide the units as well: 25 Watts = (600 Watt hours / 24 hours)   So we need 600W/h a day x 4 to keep it above the 75% number. Thats 2400W/h in battery capacity needed.   Watt-hours (Wh), not Watts per hour (W/h).   We're at 4800W/h now 4800 / 12v = 400Ah.   Watts = Volts * Amps 4800 Wh / 12 V = 400 Ah"
darknetplan,1lmcsu,benjamindees,1 point,Tue Sep 3 05:57:19 2013 UTC,Thanks this is why I shouldn't be writing out a bunch of math when I'm drinking.  I don't even really use units when I'm doing back of the napkin math to get estimates anymore.
darknetplan,1lmcsu,modzer0,3,Tue Sep 3 06:16:27 2013 UTC,"I think you are overestimating the draw of the AP's, I see usage closer to 5w from the single radio units I've worked with from the G to wireless N era. I imagine gigabit ethernet and/or dual radios would increase that number.  For example, if you look at the spec sheet for the ubiquiti loco M2 and M5 models, you'll see a listed max draw of 5.5w, on page 5:  http://dl.ubnt.com/datasheets/nanostationm/nsm_ds_web.pdf  Average use should be even lower, around 3w. So two radios on a single 100ah or less battery should be feasible, though you are right that it would drop after many days in a row of no sun. Thankfully I live in a very sunny climate so we don't have to be so pessimistic about our calculations. You could also plan to build a booster pack of around 25% of the capacity with a DC-DC charge circuit that you could carry out to the site as a contingency plan."
darknetplan,1lmcsu,gusgizmo,2,Tue Sep 3 08:37:43 2013 UTC,"The 7w figure is the rated max for some of the radios I've worked with in the past.  You always base calculations off the max theoretical draw of the unit to give an extra margin of reserve.  If it's easily accessible then you obviously don't need as much of a power reserve as you can take a portable generator to it.  I'm just accustomed to thinking of remote units that take significant time and effort to reach.  You would of course design for the environment, situation, and equipment you are using."

Updates are a bit of a problem; I don't know of a way to update cjdns without rebuilding the whole appliance, since it's a tiny system without git or a compiler. If someone starts publishing cjdns binary opkgs for x86 (can we get cjdns into the OpenWRT mainline package repositories?), you could install those.

We do hope to get vaults complete and the network up in the next 6-8 weeks or sooner if we get some help, which we are always happy to get. The belief is this network is not ours and should never be, so the libs are all Open Source and we will always make sure people have no obsticle to using them. Let us know if anyone has any projects in mind and we will see what we can do to help, there is already somebody looking to do secure skype type product and that would be amazing. So fork away and all the best with it :-)"
darknetplan,1lb3w7,sapiophile,4,Fri Aug 30 15:09:59 2013 UTC,It looks like a variant of Freenet. Would be interesting to see how it performs and how secure it is.
darknetplan,1lb3w7,dirvine,2,Thu Aug 29 11:08:52 2013 UTC,"Looks pretty awesome. Doesn't seem to provide any kind of onion-type anonymization, though - could this system be implemented in a way that provides strong anonymity?"
darknetplan,1lb3w7,sapiophile,3,Thu Aug 29 13:24:50 2013 UTC,"The anonymity is handled in a very different approach to onion routing in that our destinations are never servers. The destination is data shared at the posix file api level, therefore websites, blogs, data sharing, email, video etc. is all possible. It's our opinion that servers will always leak security so we designed a fully distributed network that users control themselves (not web of trust, but a mathematically secured network), so we do not know who is using it or for what, as that's not our business. We hope to speak to people about secure communications and email very soon (we really want others to provide the apps, we can but feel we should not), but we are completing the development of the vault API which this needs. Very hard to explain but if you check out the wiki in github there are plenty of papers that attempt to do that. https://github.com/maidsafe/MaidSafe/wiki I hope that helps a little. (PS this is private and public data that is handled so you have to log into your data, wherever that may be, not a server)."
darknetplan,1lb3w7,dirvine,1 point,Fri Aug 30 14:44:26 2013 UTC,"I thought that might be the case. Very interesting! I don't have time to read the papers just yet (though I intend to), but it seems to me that the crucial factor for anonymity, then, would be lots of dummy traffic, or just somewhat continuous traffic flow. I imagine there's a fair bit from the overhead of the network itself (after all, it's entirely distributd!), but I would be concerned in the case of a large, single data transfer that might be glaringly obvious to an observer of both the source(s) and the destination."
darknetplan,1lb3w7,sapiophile,3,Fri Aug 30 15:53:22 2013 UTC,"No worries, the papers are not great, I authored some so can speak from experince there :-). The anonymity comes from basically no servers at all, the data moves around the network and is accessed by the owners through a process of determination. The whole thing is encrypted so no node knows what it holds, but is penalised for losing or corrupting it (by it's closest nodes and the closest nodes to the data name). Another Kademlia difference is this uses recursion, so no notion of endpoints per se' (the intermediate nodes decrypt to get the destination address) and as the nodes get keys from the dht there is no man in the middle attack, this is important as any key exchange via diffee hellman type approach is succeptible to snooping, albeit more difficult as algorithms improve. Our approach is to know who you are and who you want to speak to. It's like a PKI but completely distributed and ownerless. The key is a simple process, the node to speak to is known by the hash of the public key, the key is retrieved and encryption happens :-) it goes on like that, but gets a bit hairy fast. I hope it's intresting anyway. Give me a shout if you have some further ideas."
darknetplan,1lb3w7,dirvine,1 point,Fri Aug 30 17:26:52 2013 UTC,"Very cool. I still feel concerned, though, that a practical attack would be coordinating heavy trafffic between two points, unless there's significant ""dummy"" traffic, or the transfers are made higher-latency, or the source of each piece of data is massively distributed (so that the traffic from each source node of a particular piece of data is no greater than it would transmit in normal, ongoing network traffic, which might be deliberately dropped while commencing an upload).  Also, since it's a serverless model, then doesn't that mean that every data request is interpreted by a large portion of the DHT, along with which client made that request? What strategies exist to protect users from the nodes around them knowing which data they're accessing?  I hope I'm not coming off as pooh-poohing the project - I'm very excited about it and think it's wonderful, and I'm unbelievably grateful that you're contributing to it. I just want to understand more, and possibly, offer some constructive questions and/or conversation about (potentially) improving its security."
darknetplan,1lb3w7,sapiophile,2,Fri Aug 30 19:27:13 2013 UTC,"No worries at all, questions are great. for point one the data is massivly distributed, the intent is it will be across continents and should be (given SHA distribution). Mass traffic between two points would be very difficult I think as the points would get ignored by the network very quickly. I hope this makes sense. Perhaps the mailing list is better for extended discussion, but I am more than happy here if it's better.    We are adjusting RUDP at the moment to handle much huigher rates of traffic and Michael Caisse and Joel de Guzman (author of Boost.Spirit, Phoenix, and Fusion) are helping us there. These guys with Anothony Williams (of BOOST threads and Just threads libs and author of c++ concurrency in action)  and Christopher Kohlhoff (author of Boost ASIO) have all helped and humbled us with their expertise. I think we can go much further with rUDP given c++14 features such as polymorphic lambdas and some of the boost fusion capabilitites of run time and compile time stiching up. I hope Joel and Michael help us out there, I am sure they will.   The nodes around a piece of data are random and extremely difficult to mock (i.e. it's very hard to become a node in the routing chain and even harder to create an address that is not random as it's based on a hash of a key pair).  This is an area where we see great strides to be made via the rank mechanism that's only partly in place, so even when a node does generate the appropriate key then it's still maintained in the non routing component (i.e. will accept data and give it but no routing requests). It will stay there until validated as a good node. This is like the pagerank part and will always get better.  Each node must behave properly as it will have thousands of surrouding nodes confirming actions continuously, This means that bad nodes are removed fast, but still may leave room for a node to monitor and behave, we have many options there, but for now the network basically splits users into three seperate parts, login, public name and data handling, these all use different key sets, making it not possible to tie a public name with data or a login with chunks etc. That part was difficult but when you see it, then it makes a lot of sense, your username is not part of your session and cannot identifiy itself with any data. Geez I hope that reads back OK :-)   Again please any critique etc. is great (and this is not, it's only inquisitive and valid questions). As we develop the system most of our time assumes bad people have all the source and can understand it, so we tend to edge cases very quickly to find holes, we are used to that and I think OK at covering them up and making them mathematically difficult to create, impossible in many cases, but as with all security stuff we think the more eyes and thoughts the better. So please don't aplologise, cause if we miss something it would be very poor. This is a huge reason for Open Source, we trust nobody and expect nobody to trust us, either our morals or coding ability :-) so unless we can make maths fix things and search continually for holes then we would fail. As I said to another poster, it's not our network and never should belong to anyone, so please feel free to be as pernickity (I think thats a Scottish word so if it is sorry) as possible."

Very informative, too, and quite exciting. It seems like the serverless model might be the sort of ""duh"" paradigm shift that can make these systems so much more resilient. This is more-or-less the logical conclusion of DHTs, and I love it. The idea of anonymity without onion routing (the primary tack taken by essentially every privacy-enhancing network around thus far) is a promising evolutionary development, and rUDP is a phenomenal solution to an increasingly widespread problem.

darknetplan,1lb3w7,dirvine,2,Fri Aug 30 22:43:24 2013 UTC,"Am I to understand that this system provides decentralized cloud storage, or some such? How on earth would that work with clients connecting and disconnecting left and right?"
darknetplan,1lb3w7,VikingFjorden,2,Thu Aug 29 23:14:32 2013 UTC,"Hi, in terms of the routing layer, disconnects etc. are handled via the managed connection part of RUDP, think kademlia with connected routing node neighbors, we can spot disconnects in 20ms or so up to 10 seconds. This gives the ability to reconfigure the kademlia like network very quickly. There are tests in the routing library you can use to measure accuracy, it's pretty good. We had a normal kademlia implementation with some improvements, such as down list notification and beta refresh etc. but could not get the performance needed for accuracy.  The clients connecting and disconnecting actually provide more security in a warped manner of thinking as they syncronise close node data and each sync clears out any invalid information that any single node may hold. There is loads to do but we are happy to have anyone help."
darknetplan,1lb3w7,dirvine,2,Fri Aug 30 14:37:44 2013 UTC,"I'm not savvy enough with meshnets (or whatever this would be categorized as) to understand what any of that means. :/  If client A has some chunk of my data, how can I retrieve that particular chunk if client A abruptly disconnects?"
darknetplan,1lb3w7,VikingFjorden,4,Fri Aug 30 18:09:49 2013 UTC,"Yes I don't know what category this falls into really myself.   There is more than one copy of data and they are all looked after by nodes with authority based on their (random) address (the network maintains the copies, as nodes go off another is created, if the node is off too long it's not considered a good store and reduces it's rank) . So the minimum copies is currently 4, the system uses opportunistic caching, so for popular data (chunks of files) there may be several thousand. The network dynamically allocates space for this, where it is available."
darknetplan,1lb3w7,dirvine,2,Fri Aug 30 18:44:13 2013 UTC,"I figured that was the only robust solution, but didn't know whether the possible bandwidth usage would merit such a thing.

darknetplan,1lb3w7,my_dog_rapes_puppies,4,Fri Aug 30 19:14:33 2013 UTC,"Thanks, the network will calculate the space needed. We expect this to be significanly smaller (we do real time deduplication) than the space used by any client as time goes on, but higher (max 4X and this is the extreme worst case) at the network start."

You would need an Internet trunk line if you plan to offer Internet service: http://computer.howstuffworks.com/internet/basics/internet-infrastructure4.htm    Is there anyone else in Sydney with experience in this who could help (or maybe access to a good location to put the antenna?).

darknetplan,1l2pss,superkuh,2,Mon Aug 26 04:06:41 2013 UTC,It isn't quite so easy at 12 GHz. You have to take into account vertical intrusions into the fresnel zone as well as atmospheric scattering. These are not issues satellites have due to their signal path being normal to the atmosphere and Earth surface.
darknetplan,1l2pss,tacticaltaco,1 point,Mon Aug 26 11:26:11 2013 UTC,If they're only pumping out 1 watt just go for some WiFi gear that can do that. It's easily <$150 for a 24 dBi grid and a radio. Avoids the hassle of spectrum licensing.  I do like where you're going with the towers and lots of directional links. Any frequency that can give throughput will suffer from LOS constraints. Nutting up and going with towers from the get-go would make things easier in the long run.  I guess another pro is that towers <200 ft AGL do not need to be registered (with FAA/FCC?) and don't need lights. You'll find a TON of cell towers are all 198 ft tall.

The compatibility is due to ""peering"" them together by intentional connections, not just open auto-config like a commercial product might do.  Wireless connections act the same between nodes as would a wired connection.  And sure, they could be solar powered.  But there are a lot of ways it could be set up.  All nodes need to run the protocol and act as routers that form the mesh.    But its not just a ""free internet"" for whoever necessarily.  There has to be an intentional opt-in by connecting via cjdns, which requires being granted access by a peer (ideally a real person/persons that you communicate with).  This keeps it somewhat human and within community conscience.    So total anonymity isn't the point so much, as privacy.  A good meshnet will be a community - and a community of participants that are totally anonymous kinda ceases to be a community.   But privacy?  Autonomy?  Freedom from censorship or being silenced?  Not letting anyone take your network and ability to communicate away from you?   That's more like it.  And yes, for links between nodes that are physically distant we need to rely on the gov/corp ""clearnet"" infrastructure. For now.   The ideal that we are working toward is to expand the people's mesh locally on private/community infrastructure as much as possible, while relying on commercial links between our groups in different cities.  Ultimately, I foresee enough community involvement and investment to begin working toward establishing  links between the cities.  These might be crowd-sourced or charity/private granted.  But the point is to have an infrastructure that no-one controls.  You can contribute what you've got and you ""own"" your part of that freedom.    I hope this helps a little."

If you have an amateur radio license, you can follow FCC's Part 97 and experiment with power amplifiers and high-gain antennae.  Without a license, you must abide by Part 15 rules; but you may be surprised what a simple thing like raising your antenna to above your roof can do.  Here's a quick map of the SDR pool ($ shallow end to waist-deep end $$):   A ~$35 wireless router.  Won't do SDR, but OpenWRT will let you experiment with 802.11 meshing and neighborhood networks. A $20 USB device + a decent antenna will let you receive a broad range of frequencies, but not transmit.  Here is one of many places that talks about what you can do with these cheap SDRs. A $200-400 SDR (such as the ones you mentioned) + a PC will get you firmly into the SDR camp where you can receive and transmit.  Furthermore, you can start processing the signals.  Applications are wide: beyond 802.11 there are other data transmission standards like 802.16 (wimax); or create our own wireless format for increased privacy.  SDR can be used to set up a personal cell phone station (OpenBTS).  Radio waves can be used to triangulate a position.  There's plenty of things to do, but it's pretty deep technical stuff; just google for SDR and read what everybody is doing with it.   EDIT: OpenBRT --> OpenBTS"

A decent Yagi in a point to point with another and maybe 500mW to 1000mW could easily scale that distance.  While light could likely do it (more likely visible though) your accuracy for point to point is required to be much more precise which means more height, more tuning, and a much more stable base.  While when using the Yagi, it requires decent accuracy but there is definitely some space to play around in.  This is because of the beam width: example.  Think about a beam of light and how much tighter that is, ever use a high powered green laser?  Ever see how big the dot is when one is pointed at you from far away?  Although bigger, not nearly as wide as the beam of some of your radio alternatives are.  I have a few big stretches done by Yagi's and buffalo routers, well beyond the distance you're talking about.

darknetplan,1kvz2l,Jalaska13,18,Thu Aug 22 17:53:31 2013 UTC,"I posted more succinctly in a reply, but let me elaborate more fully on why 1) CJDNS does not work the way OP thinks it does, and 2) this is a non-issue as a result.  Cache is not used for routing. It is used for route planning.  I know that sounds like a distinction without a difference, but bear with me, because there is a difference in CJDNS.  In a regular internet environment, each router has to make a decision where to forward each packet, based on its information. This will usually be in the form of a routing table, a set of rules or metadata that lets the kernel choose where to route packets.  In CJDNS, the route is planned beforehand by the machine initiating the connection. All the routing reasoning is performed by that ""client"" machine. The route, once planned, is encoded as a series of relative hops, where each hop is expressed as a router-local tiny address.  A CJDNS router does no routing reasoning. It just consumes its part of the path data, and forwards the packet along the interface with the same ID. For example, ""Interface #4"". These interface IDs are unique to each router, not the global network, so there will be a lot of #4s out there (kinda like process IDs). This ID information is simply encoded as part of the direct-route metadata in the DHT.  Because the router is just consuming a few bytes and making a quick judgement call, it doesn't need to know any cache stuff at all.  Cache is not used by the intermediate hops in any way. They will participate in the DHT storage, of course, but get no personal benefit out of it. Cache is only used when planning a route between you and another machine.  This is highly efficient, and by design. It allows for very stripped-down, ""dumb but fast"" routers.  OP's misunderstanding is that intermediate hops use cache data.  If they did, then yeah, this would be a problem, but that's not how routing works.  If this was really repetitive, sorry. I typed the whole thing while fairly dehydrated."
darknetplan,1kvz2l,Rainfly_X,1 point,Thu Aug 22 21:27:51 2013 UTC,"OP might not be completely correct, but effectively every node will have to know the route to every other node if the switching system is to work. Otherwise the node will have to forward to another node (with a ""closer"" location) and that node will need to perform routing. Note that ""closer"" has absolutely no guarantee to being closer to the destination in number of hops or any other metric. It's effectively random. That's the part that will not scale."
darknetplan,1kvz2l,gerard-,9,Thu Aug 22 22:03:01 2013 UTC,"This isn't how routing works. Maybe if I repeat it a couple more times, and add a nice ""read the fucking whitepaper""...   effectively every node will have to know the route to every other node if the switching system is to work.   No. Switches make no routing decisions. Packets are encoded with paths, not destinations, and each intermediate switch simply forwards along its section of that path.  All the routing decisions are made up front, by the connection initiator. If I want to talk to my friend at fc::some:addr, then I have to query the DHT and build up the route entirely on my computer. Then, once I have the path completely planned out from fc::my:addr to fc::some:addr, as a series of predefined relative hops, I send the packet, including that path data. None of the nodes in between have to have any DHT information about my address, or his address, or any part of the network. Even the immediate peers don't technically have to be in cache.   Otherwise the node will have to forward to another node (with a ""closer"" location) and that node will need to perform routing. Note that ""closer"" has absolutely no guarantee to being closer to the destination in number of hops or any other metric. It's effectively random.   I'm not sure it's worth the effort to deconstruct the wrongness of this, considering I've already corrected the faulty premise it's all imagined on top of.  If for whatever reason, a switch cannot route a packet according to the explicit hop list encoded in the path, it can do a bit of fancy bit twiddling to reverse the path, so it can send a routing error message back, indicating what went wrong (for example, if a peer connection died, and the original packet sender didn't know about that during route calculation). This allows the sender to recalculate a route around the problem.  There is no silly random hopping involved, even when things go to hell in a handbasket. There's just paths, path reversal, and packets.  For more info, see here and here."

After reading the code for a bit I couldn't find any ""let's forward it to this node then"" stuff, maybe I've remembered wrongly or it was removed.

So how does the DHT build the route? This is the important part. If the DHT always manages to efficiently build a route that fits into the switching label there is no problem at all.   The DHT doesn't build routes, per say, it stores records of all direct peerings. And then a different part of CJDNS asks the DHT specific questions to build the route. I don't have any experience in the algorithm involved in constructing routes. But if a route can be found at all, it is mathematically very likely to fit into a switching label.

It sounds like the big issue is mixing up Kademlia with packet routing. Which is an easy mistake to make, since CJDNS does both. So while the packets themselves don't do some weird xor-based dance, Kademlia does use xor distance to determine who is responsible for storing what. Rather than retyping it all myself, I'll link to Wikipedia's explanation of how Kademlia data lookup works.  So yeah, those memories weren't bullshit, just scrambled. And Kademlia doesn't seem to be subject to the 250-node breakdown, especially considering that's what BitTorrent uses for trackerless torrents, but even that's probably based on some miscategorized truth.   There is a real lack of clear documentation so excuse me if I get things wrong. I'd be really happy if Cjdns would turn out to scale after all.   Indeed. The whitepaper is the best in terms of documentation, but there's still a lot of dark corners in CJDNS. I don't think CJDNS has any fundamental scaling problems, although there are surely some spots that need rethinking or optimizing for a ""prime time,"" just nothing inherent to the design."

There is quite a lot of ""should never return a node with a distance further away"" in the code that makes me very suspicious.   I agree that it's fundamental, and that there's almost certainly a lot of ""never return a node with a distance further away"" in the code. That's the way the DHT works - if you need to find an answer, you need to figure out who to ask, which involves XOR distance comparison.  What I'm saying is that it's not how packet switching works. It's how the research phase works when designing a route, and all that research is an up-front cost for the connecting machine.   Yes, but Kademlia carefully chooses what nodes it connects to so it is close to it's peers. Quite a bit of research has been done and it works well in practice. CJDNS does no such thing, it only has fixed connections. I don't see why a DHT will work in this case. Cjdns might also be doing an overlay network on top of the overlay network, but that will not scale either.   From some admittedly overview-y research, this doesn't look like the case for Kademlia. It will make some initial bootstrap connections, but everyone who wants to talk to it, must talk to it directly. For example, let's say I want to find the value for hash 1287DEADBEEF5555.   Ask N nodes closest to the result Each will provide a list of the closest nodes it knows about If a node has that key stored, it will respond with the value instead Keep asking around until you find what you're looking for   Step 4 is the important one. Other nodes aren't carrying on your search for you recursively. You have to take the results, find the closest nodes among those results, and create connections to those ""closer"" nodes to ask them things. You are constantly creating and destroying connections left and right!  It seems to me that CJDNS must do the same thing in order to make use of Kademlia at all. That is, it's not restricted to communicating with its direct peers. The DHT addresses nodes by IP, like normal. When you need to ask a DHT node something, you need to plot a route to them, which can incur its own DHT traversal needs, and so on, like Inception. This would certainly explain why it takes so long to access things when you first get on the network - you're having to do lookups to do lookups to do lookups!  As for whether that will scale, I honestly don't know. It does seem pretty iffy, especially as the network grows. You'll be having to connect with DHT nodes all over the globe to find the route information you need, and to talk to those nodes, you have to connect with DHT nodes all over the globe to build those routes, and so on. Yes, it can work, but if it takes days for the cache to warm up to a useful level, that's kind of a problem ;)   Interesting discussion by the way, thanks. I'll try to do a writeup about it so it doesn't need to be repeated if we reach any conclusions.   Oh yeah, definitely. This is important stuff, the kind of underbelly thing I normally don't have to think about with CJDNS."

darknetplan,1kvz2l,OmicronNine,2,Fri Aug 23 03:49:03 2013 UTC,"The problem is that route planning requires knowledge of basically the entire network, or at least a very large chunk of it (enough to perform some path-finding algorithm), so while relay nodes may not need to know anything, a node that initiates even a single connection has a large knowledge requirement."

Not even close.   ...or at least a very large chunk of it (enough to perform some path-finding algorithm)...   Nope, you don't even need to know a ""very large chunk of it"". Not with CJDNS. A node only searches for and keeps track of routes that it needs:  https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns/blob/master/doc/Whitepaper.md#the-router  There is no overall ""master"" routing table that you need to know a significant portion of in order to plan out a route, instead you simply send out a search looking for a destination, get responses, then figure out the best route (with a bit of trial and error). It can take a little more time, but not as much as you might think, and the trade off for overall network performance, scalability, and flexibility is more then worth it."

I don't know if you have a lot of experience in creating new wireless technologies, but it is not as simple as writing some lines of code in VIM and then compiling it (before someone brings up SDRs, you are still paying $450+ for any ok SDR and $10K+ for the good ones). Making creating custom silicon is expensive and not something everyone can do. Then if you want to sell it, let's say just in the US, you have to get it certified by FCC at least.

darknetplan,1kt58k,forlasanto,8,Thu Aug 22 12:34:50 2013 UTC,"Ham radio operator here, who did this professionally in the past. Satellites are really not a good option for high speed network links. It has it's purpose, but internet/darknet is not among them. The latency involved is an intractable problem. Network links really hate latency. Try remoting in to somewhere using a IP tunnel through your neighbor's satellite internet service: prepare for a rude awakening, and some sub-dialup speeds. That's because most of your bandwidth is being spent by each side furiously fighting to try and establish a better connection. An enormous number of bits will be wasted in this effort. It's really ridiculous to watch. Satellite internet is a toy. It's not even a toy. It's a joke.  Ever watch TV, and see the delay while the reporter listens for his/her queue to start talking? That's because those poor suckers are using satellite links to communicate. And that delay is a pretty good example of exactly what latency is. Let me tell you: if the TV network guys can't fix the problem, (and believe me they would if they could!) then some darknet hobbyists are not going to throw enough money at the problem to fix it. (Not that it's actually physically possible to fix. It's not. I'm just pointing out that this problem is so seriously beyond /r/darknetplan's wildest, freakiest, most LSD induced trippy hallucinations of grandeur.)  TL;DR Darknet on satellites ain't happenin'. It's not. There's no point in trying, no point in talking about it. It's a bad idea, with no ROI of even mentioning it as a possibility. Please move on from this notion."
darknetplan,1kt58k,rapiddarknet,12,Wed Aug 21 21:23:04 2013 UTC,"Ok here is my commnent for why I down voted you.  Satellites... Satcomm is pretty expensive to use (good price is about $6/MB of transfer) and WAY more expensive to deploy. You said you would not need as many, which is correct but you would need to get through a lot of red tape before you could get a few up in the sky.   If you use commercial satcomm, you still have the problems of the large ISPs of today (read as: good friends with the Feds). The Feds could shut your comms down when ever they wanted too.   If you where to deploy your own satellites you are talking  about $200 million to $900 million for the satelite itself and then another $50 million to $500 million to get it in the air. So you are out about $250 million to $1.4 billion per satellite that you want. If you want world coverage (-82 to 82 lat) we are talking about 4 Geo stationary satellites, not including any spares. This is not including the cost of a control center for these satellites, nor the cost of someone building you units that can communicate with the satellites. This is a hefty amount of money, with almost zero return for any investor (unless you charge people to use them, but then why not just start your own Satcomm business, since that is what you would be if you charged).   Reliability is the last reason. Inmarsat (BGAN) is pretty reliable when it comes to reliability, much more then VSAT, but even it has it problems. Again, its a lot of money for what can be a flaky network.   NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE will donate that type of money so people can have their own network that people can use for free.   The idea that satellites would be plausible, is why I down voted you."

Besides, considering the permissions that CJDNS would need that the Android APIs don't cover, going the ""official"" route is most likely not an option, regardless of the language.  The three best solutions would be A) compile and run CJDNS on a rooted Android environment.  Optimally, this shouldn't be any harder than compiling and running on Linux, but I'm not aware of how much Android pushes its hands into the networking setup, or how much would need to be rolled back for CJDNS to run without issues.  Option B) would be to just drop the code into the NDK with a simple GUI, and request root permissions, but you would still run into the above (possible) issues regarding Android control over network.  Or, option C) package CJDNS into a sort of library, and drop the source of Chrome ontop of that.  This would mean less finicking around with the networking backend in Android, and could be a one click install for rooted users, or maybe even unrooted if done right, but it would obviously require tons of work."

darknetplan,1kqkvp,Rainfly_X,3,Tue Aug 20 15:59:56 2013 UTC,"The FCC already has rules in place on how to use each of the frequency bands in the spectrum.  The FCC uses Part 15 to describe how anyone (unlicensed users) is allowed to use the frequencies used by WiFi (around 2.4 GHz).  The rule with the biggest impact is the one that limits how much electrical power can be used to transmit the signal.  That effectively limits the range of Wifi. The FCC also has Part 97 to describe how licensed amateur radio operators (""hams"") may use the frequencies.  Ham radio operators are allowed to use more power for their signal, but are not allowed to transmit/receive regular internet traffic."

The map, located at http://map.projectmeshnet.org, has an option to have a potential node, which just means you'd set up a node if there was interest.

I would like to suggest a tech informational awareness campaign.  It doesn't have to be hard. Flyers, posters, emails, etc... that point back to the great online resources we have.  Like an awareness-raising recruitment of sorts. I work in a network department of a university with guys who have a lot of know-how and are doing amazing things all the time with wireless and networking topologies and understand basic mesh tech, but they don't know about this movement, cjdns, Hyperboria or any of that.   I work with brilliant network engineers and consultants regularly who would be very valuable to us, but really don't know anything about what is going on here.  ""Darknet"" is still relatively in the dark.  And I agree with thefinn93 that we need more technical people to help build first, otherwise we risk dealing with a hype bubble that pops too early and hinders the broader viability in the long run. The recent Mother Jones article was a great awareness boost that is likely to result in a surge of eyeballs taking a look.  But more needs to be done to pull more technical locals into action and get our support no matter where they are at.  It's obvious to get this going in the larger cities, but capable people in smaller cities and towns are going to be key in hopping the metro areas together.  (And you can be sure there are gov't-hating preppers in the rural areas that will get behind an effort to keep 'the man' at bay.  Just sayin.)"
darknetplan,1kpu4r,Grizmoblust,2,Tue Aug 20 18:25:48 2013 UTC,Tor is just the unindexed part of the web.
darknetplan,1kpu4r,peeonyou,2,Tue Aug 20 17:06:55 2013 UTC,"Hyperboria is a hybrid network. It works just as easily as a Tor-like overlay network, and as a BATMAN-like physical network. There are no central servers, you just need to find some peers to hook up to.  It uses onion-routing encryption, like Tor, but does not bounce your packets around to protect your anonymity. So you know who is talking to you, and the nodes along those routes might be able to piece together who is talking to you, but the content of your communication is secure from prying eyes."
darknetplan,1kpu4r,gerard-,2,Tue Aug 20 17:12:57 2013 UTC,"Does it still use IP kind of identification?   You can, just like like you can try to identify people by IP in the current clearnet. It's a lot more accurate, but still subject to a lot of the same caveats as ever, so I don't recommend ever relying on it.   And does it need ISPs?   Only if you connect overlay-style (AKA Tor-style). You can connect two computers up with an ethernet cable and have a little CJDNS network. And if you physically connect to someone in Hyperboria, you will become part of that larger network. So while most long-distance traffic will require ISPs for the foreseeable future, you don't personally have to have an ISP to be part of the network.   Without centralized servers where is general shared software stored ( example Wikipedia) ?   CJDNS doesn't ""happen"" at that level. You can still have centralized services on Hyperboria, in fact, most services are. Your computer just sees it as a regular old IPv6 network, so any software that supports IPv6 will work seamlessly on Hyperboria. That includes HTTP servers, browsers, IRC, BitTorrent - the very same software you use on the clearnet.  The work to promote decentralized services is totally separate from CJDNS. CJDNS doesn't care what software you run on top of it. A lot of the people involved in Hyperboria are also working on distributed services, but these services would run just as well on the clearnet as Hyperboria, and vice-versa."
darknetplan,1kpu4r,Thadster,2,Tue Aug 20 17:45:44 2013 UTC,"Meshnets have some similarities to I2P, but fit fairly different needs. I2P is not suited for the things CJDNS is designed for.   I2P cannot be used by directly connecting one computer to another. It has zero capability or value as a mesh technology. As I understand it, I2P uses a few centralized servers to join the network (a process called ""bootstrapping""). With CJDNS, this is manual. Anonymity is ""expensive."" For most applications, bouncing the signal around to obscure your identity is pointless, especially for the speed and latency costs involved with crazy forwarding. Therefor, it's better to start with a zero-anonymity base, and support an optional anonymity layer on top of that, so you're using it when you need it, and not using it when you don't. I2P does not support non-anon use, and that's fine, because its entire purpose is anonymity.   Meshnets are about 3 things:   People owning their own physical infrastructure Being your primary source of internet (like a free ISP) Finding a good middle ground between speed and security   I2P fits none of these criteria. That's because it's aimed at a completely different set of goals, with different priorities and intentions.  Likewise, we've had people come in here and trash-talk CJDNS for not having all the same features and design decisions as I2P. Which is silly. CJDNS is not trying to be I2P, and vice versa. Scoring CJDNS according to its resemblance to I2P, is like judging the net worth of Tiger Woods by his skill at gardening. Yes, they both involve lawns, but....  tl;dr: meshnets are not anonymizing overlay networks, nor should they be, nor should they be tacked onto anonymizing overlay networks."

Should they later decide you're a target of interest they'll crack your encryption.  Before anyone says ""they can't crack the encryption"", just stop and think about the kind of computing power these guys have available for just this purpose.  They're building a $1 billion data center just told shit out in Utah.  They've got plenty of resources and with the encryption offered on home equipment you can never be sure there isn't a backdoor, that they cannot just pull the key from a backdoor in someone's Windows machine that is also connected to the Internet, or that they couldn't just brute-force any WPA/WPA2 key in a short amount of time and then decrypt everything that ever passed on that meshnet."

The technology exists, but how long until regular consumers could see something like this, I don't know.

The best analogy I can give for this (that I posted on r/science) is imagine a 1,000,000 mile long magnet. If you know one end is the north pole, you will instantaneously know the other end of the magnet is south because that's how magnets work. There is no ""information"" being transferred from the south end to you. The guy on the south pole will still have to take a minimum of 1,000,000/186,000 seconds to tell you, hey, this is the south end. Quantum entanglement is similar because that's how these pairs of particles work - if one is some certain spin or charge, the other one is another spin or charge because that's just how they work.  May it be possible one day to send information faster than the speed of light? Maybe through some god-knows-what science. Will it be quantum entanglement? No."
darknetplan,1knyku,sailorbrendan,3,Tue Aug 20 02:12:05 2013 UTC,"I actually really like the billiard ball explanation.   Here's another example of macroscopic 'quantum entanglement'.

Then, I hand you the first bag, and walk across the room with the second bag, and open it. Once I look at the color of the billiard ball in my bag, the color of the ball in your bag 'magically' changes color and assumes a defined state. These billiard balls are entangled, very much like subatomic particles are."
darknetplan,1knyku,milksie,1 point,Tue Aug 20 12:34:37 2013 UTC,"I think I can see what Onederfoo1 imagined in using quantum entanglement for ""transmitting"" because of illustrations used to demonstrate it.   I think transmitting was in quotes, because, like Stupid_Otaku said, physical transmission is not something that can happen.  But, based on the simple illustrations of entanglement, perhaps if a particle can be spun or manipulated in a an interpreted, patterned way... then the particle elsewhere that it is entangled with would exhibit the same patterned manipulation that could be interpreted by an observer on that end, thus achieving a kind of ""transmission"" in an interpreted sense, but not in a physical sense like packets being received. There simply is no medium between the two.  Where all this breaks down is in the role of observation of the entangled particles that seems to push all this over the mystic cliff.    Just my thoughts.  Not that is has anything to do with mesh, but certainly an fun thought bubble.  Pops too easy though."
darknetplan,1knyku,DFX2KX,1 point,Tue Aug 20 03:22:52 2013 UTC,"yeah, that. Now, you couldn't use it for transmission, but you might be able to use it to verify the integrity of the transmission.

We need the technic know how people and the people who really have a mind set on wanting this project. It's like how the Internet was in the 1980's. Very few websites and very few people connected to it. But as more people saw the potential and more people who could work on creating it Niger and faster and better came along it created the Internet you use today. The only difference that we have from the 1980's Internet is that we already have one in place to communicate with people all over the world. It's awesome! So until there are lots of servers and computers an people who care and want this project to be the new tit can be are working on it, we won't be able to look at it as a product but only as a step."
darknetplan,1kpjlb,Unkn0wnn,7,Tue Aug 20 04:15:33 2013 UTC,"The mindset seems wrong. Think less about cell phones, more about text messaging.  I think we need a guerrilla hardware project to design and build a low-cost, waterproof, solar-powered wireless transceiver node for $50.  Deploy a bunch of them in an area, they automatically figure out which nodes are their neighbors, which neighbors need help forwarding messages from one to the next. Clients can just roam around among the mesh and the mesh will figure out how to get a message from a source to destination with the minimal number of hops. Some node pairs can be wired directly together, some mesh nodes might even have internet 1 access to forward messages between node clusters.  Security, encryption and authentication should be built into the software layers - but it should not be a general purpose internet replacement. The internet today is built around TCP streams and web browsers - but there's an opportunity for something different, something better, based around the way mesh networks are likely to operate at a larger scale.  The existing internet is fine for persistent, reliable connections and transferring large files, there's a lot of time and effort that's gone into building it. I don't see a mesh network fulfilling the need for that type of networking without slowly becoming what it is trying to change. The mesh needs to reach the ubiquity of public WiFi coverage in coffee shops, hotels and airport lounges - but with a mindset that considers it archaic that anyone ever had a closed or paid WiFi network in those places.  So I would argue that the mesh should be designed for quick drop-in, drop-out, always available for new clients, based around sending very short messages, high availability but with high latency, low bandwidth and possibly low reliability (UDP-style) with optional message confirmation. This is also the most likely type of network that is possible given the movement's decentralized nature and lack of funding. There's potential for abuse that would have to be mitigated, but clients should also be able to dynamically generate new routing identities for themselves: it should be impossible to DDOS someone, or to trace a message back to the source if the source does not want to be found.  I could see the most important initial applications as encrypted private text messaging; a public but cryptographically authenticated version of Twitter - and completely public unauthenticated local chat as the equivalent of IRC (constrained within N mesh network hops.) All could work nicely with small packets for their messaging protocols - and all three are the types of services that are most at threat from heavy-handed government attempts at censorship.  It's probably not even a hard sell to consumers: unlimited private text messaging, uncensored Twitter and local area chat could easily be good enough to get people to buy into the system.  Eventually it could scale to support more TCP-like applications that have traditionally relied more on streams, but in a very different way. For example: I could see mesh nodes automatically caching portions of data responses to automatically distribute the load as much as possible."
darknetplan,1kpjlb,Chroko,3,Tue Aug 20 11:14:10 2013 UTC,"We can almost do this now. We have CJDNS with link-layer auto-peering, which works just fine over wifi. If you have two computers with wifi radios set to the same channel, they can connect up and route IPv6. The current problem seems to be complicated hardware setup. Instead of a single box, you're supposed to have two fancy routers and an old PC. Hopefully the recent OpenWRT CJDNS port should help with this, but there's still the need to run power and do updates.  There are also a couple design problems; it's not a delay-tolerant parcel-post sort of system, and it can't effectively proxy for devices that don't themselves run the CJDNS software due to the addressing model."
darknetplan,1kpjlb,interfect,2,Wed Aug 21 05:12:31 2013 UTC,"That's exactly what I envision when thinking about a meshnet and the possibility of it actually becoming relevant. What I think of is an old DIY project called 'the pirate box' that created local, secure and anonymous irc and file sharing for anyone connected to it. They were left in coffee shops and parks and the little black lunchpail let those 'in the know' that they could chat here. The only difference would be that it would be a network of nodes based on that idea. I'll link when I get to a PC.  Edit: Here is the Pirate Box I mentioned"

Not only that, but they'll be perfectly fine doing all that in China, Iran or whatever cyber-opressive-regime, no worries at all.  My point is that here is the - I think fairly common - case where people are totally right to be lazy about it wrt to their goals.

I know this undermines the friend to friend aspect of CJDNS, but the options here are limited when you have to depend on people who are not competent at networking. Maybe when it gets set up, it gives the options of:   ""manual"" key exchange, which would involve the user writing down or printing out a shortish string which would allow the boxes to do a real negotiation with some level of protection and with assurance that there is some level of trust between the two people. ""manual"" + automatic. Same as #1, except it will auto connect and exchange with other boxes who support it. Non manual peers would be lower priority and get banned (just that node) if abuse is suspected. Proof of work (maybe an hour?) could be required in order to autopeer.

Anyone with the software or hardware option can DIRECTLY and SIMPLY host and share their own content using existing techniques (eg. html, php, irc, pop, XMPP etc)   In short, it's not a product until grandma can DIRECTLY route, message and share with grandpa.

Why not just use the Internet?  The reason to use it should also be obvious: it doesn't cost anything, and it's forever uncensored. That kind of stuff.  Bitcoin is currently suffering both of these problems. How the fuck do I use it, why is it so hard to use, and why should I even use it? Plenty of us are willing to figure that out, but it's making things really difficult for anyone who hasn't been doing this their whole life.

darknetplan,1kl8tc,bitcloud,17,Sun Aug 18 05:35:48 2013 UTC,"Bitcoin is suffering from only one problem: Usability.   At present it's very difficult to get bitcoins, complicated to trade them and unreliable to store them. I guarantee that when people can buy from vending machines and trade at garage sales with BTC as simply as they can with paypal or cash money, bitcoin will flourish.  Similarly, the meshnet offers something other services don't. When you're camping, when you're out of town, when you come together for a business meeting, a natural meshnet emerges. You can safely discuss intellectual property, you can flick your aunty some photos from your holiday, you can discuss with your friend that you have certain political views, or sexual orientation that is different to the norm, all completely privately and over your own naturally emerging network, free of any hotel internet payments or ISPs.  The benefits of a meshnet to the average user is the same as the benefits of ANY decentralised system. How we SELL those benefits to the end user is another matter, but it's very simple to make a more secure, faster, more direct network look favourable. Just look at bittorrent... decentralisation simply kicks the client -> server model's ass."

darknetplan,1kl8tc,psycrypto,4,Mon Aug 19 07:51:11 2013 UTC,There are a finite number of Bitcoins by design. The currency is based on a deflationary model in which the money in relation to goods gets more valuable over time. Our modern world-economic system is based upon inflation where money always looses value.  Bitcoins are fragile! In the sense that you can delete them or forget your password... its just data. The best thing to do is:   write down the password somewhere safe and make a backup of your wallet  wait for someone to invent a bitcoin bank with all the safe guards and regulations that come with the banks we are used to today.

When Bitcoins leave circulation, everyone else's Bitcoins are worth more. Bitcoins can in theory be divided down infinitely many times (the smallest valid peice of Bitcoin currency today is called the Satoshi, named after Satashi Nakamoto and is equal to 0.00000001 Bitcoins). So in theory, it is perfectly possible to have a functioning world economy with only 1 Bitcoin total in circulation, but is divided up into trillions of pieces.

Maybe even allow users to set their system to mine bitcoins in idle and help subsidies the product for the manufacturer. Many feemium games use some type of in game token/gem system, so why not BTC that have value outside of the game? I like to dream there would be a mobile component where people's smartphones/tablets could be the controller interfaces and even perhaps wifi extenders to increase network coverage. I'm imagining battery life would be an issue there, but it seems (with my limited knowledge) the other technical issues could be resolved.   I think meshnet + bitcoin + great video game platform that has a mobile component could be a huge win from a popularity standpoint. When you say we need to be Apple about it, that's what i think of.

I envision some kind of portable p2p file sharing device that does things like StreetPass or Near on handheld game systems: That is, it continually polls the area with small, low-power queries, and automatically connects to compatible devices, opportunistically trading queued data packets. When only a few people have them, you may get home and notice you have a new song or video clip on your device. When lots of people have them, data flows through the network as it can, making best efforts to route possibly private packets to the appropriate node."

Though if it's not in something I can put in my pocket and walk around with, I would never encounter another node as long as I live. Also, I've worked with over a half dozen OSes not counting distroes and other versions, and studied IT in college for 3 years, but I look at this and think ""that's too complicated. Something would go wrong for sure in setup. If it didn't, I'd still never find anyone in the same approximate geographic area to complete setup step 2...""  But... it does sound like it's based on some good principles. I can imagine I might get a bit of use out of it if I lived in San Fransisco, or another place with (tens of?) thousands of very active geeks. As it is, I might run into 2 people a year on StreetPass with a 3DS. :/"
darknetplan,1kl8tc,danry25,0,Sun Aug 18 21:58:53 2013 UTC,"Dude, starting a local meshnet isn't a walk in the park, it is going to to take a time commitment, and require a bit of salesmenship, but as Guifi.net has shown even non-technical people can run local nodes.  On another note, mobile nodes aren't as great as you seem to think they are, as range and available bandwith is a few orders of magnitude worse than any fixed node with an Omnitik."
darknetplan,1kl8tc,DenjinJ,2,Sun Aug 18 22:15:06 2013 UTC,"I understand that quite well. For all their shortcomings, mobile nodes are the only way I'd ever have a connection to another device. I can set up a thousand different kinds of static nodes where I am, and they'd never see a connection, so it's moot. Range of a mobile node would then be infinitely better, as at least once or twice a year, I might drive through a large city, and swap a packet or two with another node.  You see, I'm not saying there's no way I could set the existing methods up, and it's not that they're not doing good work... but until we have a system that's of interest to more than computer scientists, we have next to nothing. It's harsh criticism, but also realistic. When someone with dozens of years in IT looks at it and goes ""that's too difficult,"" it's already dead. I think to make a difference, it has to be very non-technical, and very popular. I don't have the magic bullet to make that happen, but I've seen many other niche radio systems come and go that were far easier to use, advertised, carried in stores, etc. I think at the least, it needs to either be just an Android app, or a cheap kit people can throw together, flash/install, turn on, and start using without asking for introductions or initial nodes, running configuration processes, etc."

darknetplan,1k8tom,Drew0054,9,Tue Aug 13 12:31:05 2013 UTC,"The problem with relying on crypto at higher levels is it's extremely hard to get people to use it. Look at the current state of SSL - relatively few websites offer across-the-board crypto by default. Reddit doesn't. (I know about pay.reddit.com, but that's definitely not default.)  Look at email. From a security standpoint, it's an absolute joke. I use PGP, personally, and host my own email server, but that doesn't prevent the majority of people I email from not using PGP. Most email servers don't relay to each other with TLS.  Is everyone sure it's actually 2013? because we should really be using a lot more crypto than we are.  That's why it's important to build the crypto in at a low level, particularly in a system in which the infrastructure is even less trustworthy than that of our current Internet.  If you build strong crypto into the protocol, you reduce the need for more crypto, like SSL. It doesn't replace the need for higher-level crypto, of course, and I'll still be signing all my email, but it requires that everyone use it in order to be on the network.  Just as importantly, it's transparent - even if they don't care about security at all, they're still able to use it because it requires no extra effort."
darknetplan,1k8tom,DuoNoxSol,1 point,Tue Aug 13 14:42:16 2013 UTC,"I think another important detractor from using crypto is ease and features.

It's like re-engineering a car, with the same known defect, then recalling it, all to fix the original defect. That coupled with the fact it's off the current internet, services would need to be rebuilt. Okay, so now Meshnet-Facebook is just as vulnerable as Facebook, because BB is gathering information at the server level, not networking.  Hyperboria sounds like it's riding some coattails. Not saying it's not a good idea, but it's a good idea for different reasons. Hell, tor (with hidden services) would solve the issue neatly that this article claims to be solving. Granted, it wouldn't be so bandwidth efficient for a meshnet."
darknetplan,1k8tom,Drew0054,3,Tue Aug 13 12:29:37 2013 UTC,"I figure you deserve to understand why you're being downvoted. I will try to explain it without getting on your case too much, but first of all, you have to understand that your I-dismiss-it-because-I-don't-understand-it attitude is a large part of why your karma is being tanked.   We need a new physical architecture, because it is politically and socially dangerous to have all telecoms infrastructure centralized to just a few providers. With decentralization at the hardware level, an internet kill switch stays a bogeyman - impossible to implement without an EMP attack on electronics in general. A physical infrastructure owned by the people, in a concrete sense rather than a stock-market-y one, is incredibly valuable on its own. However, you can't have that without encryption, which you should have anyways. Each of these things is good, but they only paint the future when you blend them together. VPN access to the clearnet, such as Facebook, could be a valuable and profitable service. In fact, this is my model for replacing ISPs. We cannot enforce security on other people's servers. If you want to drive an armored truck to a sketchy neighborhood and unlock all the doors, nothing we do to armor the truck will make any difference, except successfully getting it to that sketchy neighborhood intact. But don't reject this armoring just because it doesn't solve the whole problem - that's like not taking your antibiotics because they don't also cure cancer. The cancer cure is also in the pipeline. We are working very hard on distributed services that respect user freedom. It's not like this side of things is being neglected. It's just outside the scope of the network engineering. Hyperboria is standing on the shoulders of many giants. That's not the same as riding on coattails, and CJDNS is actually a fantastic example of the difference. It accomplishes a pragmatic middle point between BATMAN and Tor that nobody else is really able to service right now. Nobody gives the Opus codec shit about riding on the coattails of SILK and CELT, because what it brings to the table is an amazing blend of each's benefits. CJDNS is the same way, but for networking.   tl;dr: We have actual reasons for doing what we're doing, how we're doing it. Just because you aren't familiar with those reasons, doesn't mean our planning is based on a lack of ""thinking it through"" - in fact, it's the opposite."

Theres a bunch of code and junk like that in there that which kind of explains what each little piece does.  CPUs are just ""chunks"" that flip switches on and off. there isnt any built in mechanism (at assembly/binary level) that can feasibly figure out what the CPU is doign to data.

You still need a seperate layer of hardware to tell the CPU to execute those instruction cycles that copy/decode all of the data that it is processing, and on top of that you need further support (usually OS/application level) to be able to do anything productive with that data.  Cheapest feasible option i could think of would be to raw stream all network bound traffic to seperate destination, and this could be done in hardware. But you'd notice pretty quickly because you'd be getting something like half the upload speed you usually get (one packet to web server, one packet automatically to man in the middle, no OS level support to avoid man in the middle detection). So your 300kbps upload would get halved to 150kbps and that is generally a pretty quick find nowadays, given that a simple facebook upload manages to tell you the speed of the file transfer next to it.  EDIT: on phones, anything is fair game, if you really think about it. no guarenteed speeds, no real way to tell where your packets are going apart from raw data extraction and decode of the chip;s output."

After a break from meshnets and other privacy/freedom enhancing tools I've started thinking about a global meshnet again. After taking another look at the routing code in CJDNS I'm fairly confident that it will not scale. I've spent the better part of two days (and an evening) designing a better meshnet: Wanderlust. Please let me know what you think before I go on and implement something that is broken or in other ways undesirable.  edit: grammar"
darknetplan,1k5qdg,danry25,6,Sun Aug 11 19:33:54 2013 UTC,"Hey /u/gerard-, large chunks of the cjdns routing code are in the process of being rewritten so that cjdns can scale well past its current size. We currently have about 30 BTC or thereabouts set aside for cjdns development, which includes adding Windows 7 support and fixing the route finder to resolve the stale route bug that occasionally crops up and causes sites to become needlessly inaccessible.  What all do you think won't scale by the way? We have about 300 nodes in the current network, and we've tested cjdns based networks up to a few thousand nodes using VMs and ethernet interface autopeering."
darknetplan,1k5qdg,danry25,9,Sun Aug 11 20:13:37 2013 UTC,"I guess I should include a more detailed critique of the CJDNS routing algorithm. As described in the paper by Oskar Sandberg the greedy routing algorithm used by CJDNS (and Kademlia etc.) will only work if nodes that are closely connected also have close locations used for routing. Kademlia manages this by making and dropping connections, Freenet in darknet mode does this by swapping locations. CJDNS does neither and expect greedy routing to work. I expect that because the network is relatively small and everyone is connected through a small number of hops that every node has a route to every other node. In that case the switching code can take care of everything. Only after the switching label becomes full (the switching horizon) will packets need to be forwarded to another host. If this currently is a random host (not guaranteed to be closer to the target) it doesn't matter as much due to the small network size. Chances are that it will have a route, or it can forward to another random host. Eventually packets will get there, and because CJDNS is so quick that happens quickly. This will not scale to a worldwide network though, as the random routing will not find the target."
darknetplan,1k5qdg,danry25,1 point,Sun Aug 11 20:23:12 2013 UTC,"Hmm, I've had chains of cjdns nodes up to 20+ nodes long that have routed fine with an end to end latency of 5 seconds, so I don't think we'll run into that until we scale to a few thousand nodes or so.  I'd definitely expect the CJDNS routing algorithm to break down at that point, but we can modify or replace the current switching and routing code in cjdns to scale better at that point (we will likely make cjdns's routing implementation more like VRR) and we are on schedule to have this work done before the cjdns network grows past 1000 nodes."

Retrofitting another routing algorithm on CJDNS does not look like an easy task to me, but I'd love if I would not have to reimplement all the stuff that CJDNS already does."
darknetplan,1k5qdg,whitefangs,6,Sun Aug 11 21:19:48 2013 UTC,"VRR is the closest thing to what CJDNS uses, right now we're looking at what to transition cjdns to and we've speced out about 40 paid hours worth of work to get cjdns on to a more scalable routing protocol. I'd really appreciate any suggestions and help in this arena, as while the routing engine is slightly more robust than VRR, Hyperboria is likely going to start having many more routing issues once we hit over 1000 nodes, which is likely to happen in the next year based of the growth rate of the network currently."

darknetplan,1jxziq,zizzzzzzzzzz,4,Thu Aug 8 11:50:21 2013 UTC,It appears they have removed the paywall. You can find more information about the project here and here
darknetplan,1jxziq,kaysersoze,4,Thu Aug 8 17:47:57 2013 UTC,"disclaimer: I wrote the story.  for starters, there's a difference between the web and the internet. nothing about a magazine with a paywall has anything to do with the internet. even if the whole world ran a meshnet, content providers would still need to pay their people the write/shoot/edit the stuff.  I balk a bit at reddit's reaction to paying for content, but I can understand not wanting to subscribe to a whole magazine to read one story. Do you think you/redditors would pay something like 50c to read the story, if it was an easy transaction?"
darknetplan,1jxziq,zizzzzzzzzzz,7,Thu Aug 8 19:36:38 2013 UTC,"To answer your last question: I, for one, would not mind paying if it was an easy transaction. I understand that people like getting paid for their efforts.  That being said, would it be $0.50 (I'm assuming USD), for the one article, or for some level of access (8 hours, 1 day, etc.). I mention the price point, as traditional newspapers cost about that much daily, and provide way more content for the price. I would definitely consider the $0.50 charge for a day of access, but not for a single article, unless it was a short story, or a nicely laid out how-to guide - essentially delivering more value."
darknetplan,1jxziq,BlueOak777,1 point,Thu Aug 8 22:32:09 2013 UTC,thanks. good points. there's not much point in charging for every single article anyway. much better to get someone to come back another time than to piss them off with nickel and diming on every story.

darknetplan,1jxziq,BlueOak777,1 point,Thu Aug 8 23:08:41 2013 UTC,"So this was just spam? I see. I'm not going to debate morals here, but self promoting spam is still pretty douchy even when it doesn't cost a tank of gas to read.   I've been at this game for nearly 15 years now. I currently operate eight websites, most are much like the one you linked. Almost all have thousands of members contributing and they draw in hundreds of thousands of visits per month (total my network pulls close to 2mil visits monthly). Everything I operate works on a free basis, not because I'm some glorious euphoric web dev, but because I have learned it benefits everyone the most.   When I can benefit my authors and make my viewers happy, I am happy. The author gets exposure, the viewers get sweet content, and I get paid through ad space and premium services. In my opinion this is by far the best revenue model for the web, but to each his own of course and we all have to make money somewhere, but paywalls are pretty shitty.   I balk a bit at reddit's reaction to paying for content,    I would say that's reddit for you but in reality that's all of the social web for you. Hell, most people hate Quora and all it required is a bloody sign up to read. I don't blame them one bit, the web should be open and free IMO.   Do you think you/redditors would pay something like 50c to read the story, if it was an easy transaction?   Not if I can find it elsewhere for free. I would have to be YOUR fan and care about YOUR point of view.... and that is exactly what premium content is for. Twitter or your own website/blog linking to your paid articles would work best for this. If I wanted to go this route I would build up a true fan base and advertise directly to them, you may make a living on it. Randomly posting articles on social sites isn't going to get you far, people expect it to be free.  TL;DR: the magazine subscription model doesn't work very well on the web, no matter how much they want it to. It's archaic and old school thinking applied to a new and constantly evolving outlet. It will never be the ""best way to do it"". Paywalls are rude and dickish to your readers. Look at the biggest and most successful informational websites for examples, it's all free content with premium options and some ad space for good luck."
darknetplan,1jxziq,zizzzzzzzzzz,2,Thu Aug 8 20:47:26 2013 UTC,"Your obnoxiousness and arrogance makes me want to pay the $25 for a subscription.  This isn't spam, it's real content.  If you don't like it, go elsewhere."

darknetplan,1jxziq,CDRCRDS,-1,Thu Aug 8 23:45:15 2013 UTC,"I'm not sure how this counts as link spam, seeing as I was not the one to post the link.   I'd like to see these eight websites. It's jumping to conclusions, and I'm sorry for that, but I'd be very surprised if there is much original, first hand reported content on there. It's very doable to get millions of views online. you say you get paid through ads, but do your eight websites employ 40 journalists and editors, all working their arses off? I doubt.  I disagree that premium content is for opinions you agree with. I think people should pay for information that they cannot get elsewhere, not for opinions that they like. Opinions are like arseholes, etc. Not everyone has a story though.  Give me one good reason why the web should be free and open. I would say that the standards and protocols that underpin it should be free and open (or paid for in the same way we pay for other important infrastructure), but the content, not necessarily."
darknetplan,1jxziq,amda88,0,Fri Aug 9 16:00:30 2013 UTC,"I'd be very surprised if there is much original, first hand reported content on there....   Oh but it is, the vast majority (95%+) comes directly from the news creators themselves. For example, one site is for game developers who write articles about their latest projects. Except for basic moderation (which is handled by dedicated volunteers and site-wide by every member) the entire site is completely automated.   ....but do your eight websites employ 40 journalists and editors, all working their arses off? I doubt.   You're thinking about this all wrong. Why do I need journalists? Why do I need editors? They are simply wasteful middle men on an open platform such as the web. An archaic process brought from newspaper and magazines. I have breaking news first hand from the people creating the news themselves. They make sure it looks great because it's THEIR names on the line if they produce a shitty article. I have no need to pay someone to go ""find"" news or play ""editor"". News comes to me because the people who make news want and need exposure.   Every one of my sites cover a different niche and every one operates the same. You can easily apply this model to any subject.    I'm not sure how this counts as link spam   If you wrote a blog post and shared it for the sole purpose of getting views on reddit, for example, it would be called blog spam and removed by moderators, would it not? This is no different, it falls into the general ""spam"" category. of course I'm assuming the other account is you...or wait...did you just magically find this post only a few hours after it was made so you could defend your own article? Come now zizzzzzzzzzz.   I disagree that premium content is for opinions you agree with.    no no, not opinions you agree with...more like premium content sells much much better to a pre-built fan base who want to hear what you have to say. Not so much to random people on the internet.   If they can find it for free elsewhere why would they pay for it if not to support your efforts? You would have to be the exclusive (which is rare) or have fans who want your side of the story (which makes it exclusive).     Give me one good reason why the web should be free and open.   Do you seriously need convincing that the majority of the web should be free and open?"

One way to access it is through the anonymising routing service Tor, which lets a user find hidden web pages that have .onion addresses, rather than IP addresses. But anonymisation like this can facilitate otherwise unacceptable activities. Illegal drug market, Silk Road can only be accessed using its .onion address. But Alexander Bauer, who works on a meshnet in Maryland thinks meshnets are less likely to carry this content. Any website that can successfully run on a meshnet must be socially acceptable to every peer they connect with, making it less attractive for child pornographers or websites like Silk Road.

The speeds, the prices, the way they dick you around, the monopolies. At this point I didn't really know much about mesh networking but I talked to friends and tried to get something set up. That went no where, but a little later /r/darknetplan came around, so i subscribed and ignored, waiting for some smart people to figure it out for me. One day, being bored, i started actually poking around, and it really resonated with me. Setting up our own network, for secure, decentralized communications. Where you didn't have to pay for a connection, just had to keep your hardware up. etc. What's more, what really made me say ""I'm doing this now"", was there were ways I could help. One of the objections was that why would i want to join a network with nothing on it, so I started setting up services on the network. From there I've morphed into tech support/social media/meshlocal expert/other random things for Project Meshnet as a whole, and a leader of the physical mesh in my area, Seattle Meshnet.  anyway, hope that answers your question.

He looked at me blankly and said ""what's that""), etc. Oh and the lies. all the damn lies.

Cloudhosting, IMO, makes little to no sense, since it's about the neighborhood, so why the hell not keep it local.

As a way to explore the workings of such a system I've been building a CCNx port of a federated wiki I found on github, using IndexedDB to store data in a distributed manner accross clients, and having the servers be little more than websocket entry points into the CCN Network (http://github.com/rynomad/Smallest-Federated-Wiki) I'm just starting to deploy some servers at local hackerspaces here in Colorado, and I should have beta-testable code for the CCN wiki within a week.  A full platform is in the design stages (sorry no code to speak of but there are piles of notes, sketches, data structures strewn about my room)  Nei.ghbor.net has kindof taken a back burner this summer due to the Wiki getting accepted for presentation at PARC in Sept, so I've been working on getting it as robust as possible, but PM me and I'll see if I can get a decent whitepaper/manifesto Repo up on the platform, I'd love to have some help with this:  Last thing: I saw your post about the captive portal free Wifi: this platform would hopefully be the perfect thing for that."

I haven't looked into nextdoor.com more than just a glance, but I'm not so sure if you'd want to have every single meshlocal (or ""neighborhood"") host their own instance. Sure, they could, but it'd be a bit pointless because it'd be geared towards that particular meshlocal, and not others. The fact of the matter is that nextdoor.com wants everyone to use their site, not create their own instance of it for every single neighborhood.   It'd be a bit pointless for it to be centralized, also, due to the fact that decentralization is the whole point. If you're looking for a map of people to find friends/peers/neighbors, the decentralized map that myself, /u/duonoxsol, /u/dylwhich, and /u/meshnet_derp have been working on is a better idea. Check out NodeAtlas when you get a chance.  If you were going to host a site like this, I don't think that cloud hosting would make any sense on Hyperboria, or any meshnet. That defeats the purpose of the meshnet because you're relying on a cloud hosting service that is not on Hyperboria, or whatever meshnet you are on.   I'm not sure if I answered your question to the fullest of what you were asking, but those are just my thoughts."

A central site that operated like nextdoor.com would also be a single target for attackers (though perhaps it could defend better than some local sites).  I'm not suggesting that each meshlocal, or physical neighborhood (as the two may not directly correlate) host their own full instance of the service, but rather only their portion. A cloud based portion of the site would be where these local sites are categorized, monitored for up/down, and linked to. Though you'd probably want that data hosted somewhat locally. For example, the meshlocals in Georgia have their own neighborhood sites, and a webserver in Atlanta hosts a site that keeps track of them.  Meh, maybe facebook groups are good enough."

But they have to have a reason to inspect your line. Excessive usage could be more a reason to cut the line. I recommend to mask any traffic. Another option would be to use a VPN for the others and have them pay 10 buck/year for this connection. This additionally gives them more privacy.  You can't really filter. Except if you just reroute any traffic into tor... Or you go the telco-route and just whitelist, but that is not nice. You can't do it without a business connection. Then you pay (I only know the situation in Switzerland) 20 times more and have some obligations as you are an ISP (logging etc.).  Depending on where you live, you could involve social services and have them pay the Internet access. Argue with the money they can slash if they don't have to pay 50 times Internet access but only one fat line (50 to 100Mbit/s can sometimes be enough for a housing complex.)"

A common theme across these proposals has been the use of wireless mesh networks. We argue that such networks are poorly equipped to serve as a meaningful countermeasure against large-scale blackouts due to their intrinsically poor scaling properties. We further argue that projects in this space must consider user safety as first design priority and thus far have failed to preserve user anonymity and to rely only on innocuous hardware. From these two insights, we frame a definition of dissent networks to capture the essential requirements for blackout circumvention solutions."

darknetplan,1ibbqb,Dmelvin,1 point,Tue Jul 16 02:36:45 2013 UTC,"And yet that is exactly how it works. The output voltage for the received signal is higher vs a lower gain antenna because it is more efficient for certain frequencies, polarization, and angles.  Think about cell phone towers, they use many highly directional, high gain antennas to pull in an extremely weak signal from a cellphone, or satellite dishes to receive the weak satellite signals from geostationary orbit."
darknetplan,1ibbqb,gusgizmo,1 point,Tue Jul 16 08:20:43 2013 UTC,"The antenna's on a nanostation are dual polarity, 16dbi antennas with a roughly 60* horizontal beam spread, with nearly no vertical spread.   The radio itself can be cranked up to 600mw, way more than the power of your laptop network card.  Also way more gain."

PD is ""security through obscurity"" so to speak now. This does not mean that PD is inherently insecure (it has the encryption and anonymity that it claims to have) but it's not perfect.  The main problem with PD is similar to that of Tor but worse.

darknetplan,1hy3tv,miguelos,-5,Wed Jul 10 17:21:37 2013 UTC,I am aware that we need privacy even if we have nothing to hide.   You can't simply assume that. Do you have arguments to support it?
darknetplan,1hy3tv,miguelos,2,Wed Jul 10 01:55:39 2013 UTC,"I've been spreading the idea of transparency for a while now. In all this time, I never used the following arguments:   ""You don't need privacy if you have nothing to hide."" ""What does NSA does is necessary because of national security.""   I actually have things to hide. I'm hiding them not because they're intrinsically ""bad"" things, but because society is not used to see these things. Showing them to an unprepared and intolerant world would be a mistake. Does that mean that I want to hide stuff forever? Not at all. My goal here is to make society more tolerant, and this is done with transparency. There's nothing to hide in a completely transparent society. But people don't want to surrender their ""privacy habit"".  I don't really support what the NSA is doing. Not because I believe in a right to privacy (which I don't), but because this is an unequal relationship (they know everything and we don't), and because they use our money to do it. But I would have no problem in a society where 100% of the population would have access to these tools, and where privacy doesn't exist. I also don't believe that the end justifies the means, which is why I wouldn't support what they do for ""national security"".  Privacy is not unlike fossil fuels. They're readily available options that solve our problems in the short term, and getting rid of both today would be problematic. However, they're not sustainable. Privacy has its limits, and it creates more problem (stopping information from flowing freely, as well as causing social stigmas) in the long term.  Transparency is more similar to renewable resources. It requires some initial sacrifices, and personal investments, but in the end it's worth it. A transparent society is what I want to live in. Living in a society where the focus is put on hiding (privacy) and fear of the government is the last thing I want (and it's what we have today). Let's focus on the future, and do what's necessary to create a brighter and cleaner future.  You can either hide all your life, or get out there, be proud of who you are, and make the world realize that there's no reason to hide what you used to hide. Homosexuality probably wouldn't be accepted today if we had the technology to hide (keep private) homosexual relationships in the past. At first people were not open to it, but when they realized that it was a common occurence, and started to see more and more homosexuality publicly, they got used to it and started to accept it. Transparency made this taboo something which is considered totally normal today. Why not apply the same thing to everything else, starting with drugs?"
darknetplan,1hy3tv,miguelos,1 point,Wed Jul 10 05:57:22 2013 UTC,"You seem to treat transparency and privacy as the same thing, but is ""transparency"" in the sense that you use the word not more applicable to vertical relationships of power (citizens vs government) to enable to ensure there are checks and balances when people in power make decisions, where general privacy applies in horizontal relationships between peers as well?   I don't see why both terms should be treated differently. I'm for horizontal transparency.   I would personally not like to live in a world with zero privacy ""where privacy doesn't exist"". People hide things which are not intrinsically bad but which they don't want their neighbors to know either.   Explain this to me. This is what everybody is telling me, but nobody can justify why it's the case. ""Because I feel like it"" or ""because I'm used to it"" are not reasonable arguments. It's subjective at best, and we can't debate on subjectivity.   If I wanted to visit an adult store, watch porn on the internet, or learn how to do needlework I could, there isn't anything intrinsically wrong with it, but I might think twice if I knew that my boss, mother or neighbor would automatically know that I did. Yes, people should be proud of themselves, but a lack of privacy could discourage exploration and stunt self growth.   That's the problem. We live in a society where we fear the judgement of others. That's a problem. In an open society, you would know what kind of porn everybody look at, and letting people know what you watch won't be some problematic anymore. When you think about it, there's no clear difference between publicly letting people know what sport team you support and publicly letting people know what kind of porn you like. Am I ashamed to let others know that I like pizza? No. The whole taboo around porn (and tons of other things) is not reasonable. Instead of improving privacy and being good at hiding what I like and do, why don't we focus on trying to make society more open and tolerant?  The more we hide things, the less accepted they will be. This creates a huge inequality between those who can hide everything and those you fail to hide some things.  Take for example marijuana. Something like 25% of the population consumes it. But because they hide when they do, it looks like almost nobody consumes it, and it's seen as worse than it actually is. Because everybody hide when smoking marijuana, only those who are too stupid to hide and those who get searched for no reason (minorities) get caught and sent to jail. If there was no privacy, we would know 100% of those who consume marijuana, and we would realize that the law supposed to arrest 100% of those caught smoking it is retarded and makes no sense. My point is that these stupid laws only exists because a minority of people get caught for it while everybody else is hiding. The solution is not to hide, but to change the law.  The same thing applies to every social issue. Making things public is the only way to let people accept it.  Most people don't seem to have a problem being quite open online. They share their location, interests, activities, etc. with the world. 50 years ago, you would ask people if they would do it and most of them probably wouldn't, because ""privacy is so important"".  Privacy simply is a byproduct of communication limitations we had in the past. The easier communication gets, the less privacy we will have. Slowing down communication to protect privacy is like shutting down the internet to prevent ""illegal"" downloads.  Let's accept that privacy is slowly disappearing. Let's accept that technology will soon make privacy something of the past (technically impossible, or very expensive). Let's realize that communication is good and is necessary for the society to grow. Let's get rid of fear, and let's start being more open. Let's not be ashamed of what we are and what we do. Let's fight the real problem, which is those who want to abuse their power (the government).  Most socialists want more government, but they keep whining and protesting when that government use the power they were given to decide what's good for people. Let's give people more power, and reduce the government to a minimum, so that individuals can themselves decide what's good for them, and create their own success.  TL;DR: Privacy is a band-aid."

darknetplan,1hx4ct,jedunnigan,3,Tue Jul 9 06:10:52 2013 UTC,"Abstract: A challenging problem in dissent networking is that of circumventing large-scale communication blackouts imposed by oppressive governments. Although prior work has not focused on the need for user anonymity, we contend that it is essential. Without anonymity, governments can use communication networks to track and persecute users. A key challenge for decentralized networks is that of resource allocation and control. Network resources must be shared in a manner that deprioritizes unwanted traffic and abusive users. This task is typically addressed through reputation systems that conflict with anonymity. Our work addresses this paradox: We prioritize resources in a privacy-preserving manner to create an attack-resilient, anonymity-preserving, mobile ad-hoc network. Our prioritization mechanism exploits the properties of a social trust graph to promote messages relayed via trusted nodes. We present Rangzen, a microblogging solution that uses smartphones to opportunistically relay messages among citizens in a delay-tolerant network (DTN) that is independent of government or corporate-controlled infrastructure."

I wrote it in Python because it's great for rapid prototyping, and this is still in many ways a prototype. Python will be more than good enough for the traffic load for the next few years, especially since there are multiple parts of the stack that would be relatively easy to port to Cython. The low-hanging fruit in optimization, right now, is all in the silly naive stuff going on in my code, not the language itself. I'd be happy to start in on ports in languages like Go, Rust, C, etc. after the original Python version achieves some sort of stability. Ideally Rust if it's mature at the time, but Go is a strong second. I have a love-hate relationship with C. Even after DJDNS evolves out of using Python, it will leave behind a lot of valuable, modular code. Most particularly pymads, a DNS library that makes it really trivial to play around and experiment with procedural DNS resolution. Python is a much friendlier language to play with that way than C is.   tl;dr: Python probably isn't the forever solution, but it's what I needed to develop a proof-of-concept, and there's plenty of time before the overhead actually matters in the slightest."

The high gain omnis aren't that great in my experience, you can only flatten a beam so much. . ."
darknetplan,1htapg,Dmelvin,4,Mon Jul 8 18:30:10 2013 UTC,"This looks consistent with what my own investigation in preforming the same project led me. I have a similar plan, but need a more suitable antenna. This lead me to looking for an omnidirectional. I looked at several comparable antennas to the one you found. I found them slightly cheaper on Amazon (crap, there was a 15dBi somewhere, this is a 12). When expanding again, you should note that you can get a 8dBi outdoor omni for less than half the price. Don't forget you likely need a pigtail to convert to SMA   This nice connector chart should be helpful.   My project is intended to provide an offline Wikipedia mirror, TeamSpeak (chat and VIOP), Friendica (Facebook clone), Gallery3 (image host), and anything else I can think of."

darknetplan,1hsjty,ramotsky,8,Sun Jul 7 07:12:05 2013 UTC,"Building a meshnet in a rural area would actually be easier in a couple key ways:   It would be easier to get the best locations.  You would have a much less difficult time getting on the top of hills and tall buildings since there are less people wanting to use that space. Less interference: with fewer phones, GPSs, wifi routers, etc in an area, you will have less trouble with interference.   Of course, a rural area might not have enough people to set up a mesh.  In a city, you only need one house every few blocks.  In a rural area, you might need one or more radio on each person's property, greatly increasing the cost per person."
darknetplan,1hsjty,matteotom,4,Sun Jul 7 07:27:07 2013 UTC,"As someone who lives in a rural area, I agree, it seems much easier.  Not everyone needs to be connected is the saving grace. I'm not familiar with MeshNet (researching as I type) but I read farther down of a ""point-to-point"" system using line of site, I don't see this being too helpful around here. There are too many treelines, if they don't block the signal then it isn't a problem."

Since they rotate the fields with different crops, every structure would have to be set up higher than the corn that would eventually be in every field.

Currently the meshbox is about 2 weeks away from shipping or so, and we already have the webgui and cjdns + nat66 pulled together, its just a matter of spit and polish to get the MeshBox v1 out the door and into our donors hands at this point, then once we've delivered Meshboxes to everyone who donated we can start on v2."

Anyway, it's been a busy 24 hours wrapping my head around everything, and I thouht this article was really interesting. You may have noticed that he talks a lot about deploying node.js? I'm thunking this might be something for the Meshnet.  Ever since I heard about the freedombox, I have been wanting something where every device was kind of equal, a computer as well as a smartphone.   Now, I'm still fuzzy on the details exactly how to use the Meshnet. Is it like with websites or something. Chat? Email? How do you guys use it?  But I thought of a situation where a device can have ""services' or 'extentions"" or ""apps"" if you will, based on node.js, that other devices on the meshnet can interact with. Van portman here uses node.js to set up his webpage, but node.js could just as easily be used to build a chat service, mail service, phone, file sharing, p2p etc And apparently it's light weight, so even an android device could probably handle a few services (phone and messaging comes naturally there). Node apps could be distributed with some kind of app store or repository or similar, easily ported to different devices. The same node script could be run both on my computer and my phone without modification as I understand it. For android, maybe the app that gets you connected to Meshnet can also help you keep track of different 'apps' and provide a GUI for them, or even better, the GUI for a node app could just be web based. On a computer it is easy enouh to keep track of your different apps as well.  Another thing I've been thinking about is what happens if you need to access a resource at or send a message to a certain node and that node is disconnected? Will your message get lost or be cached until the node appears, or what happens? If, say there are a ""website"" (dunno howbthis works in practice) and the ""server"" goes down, is there any kind of redundancy or caching? Because I don't have my own servers and I shut down my desktop computer or smartphone when I'm not using it. So would a message get through anyway when I reconnect?  How is it with DNS? I think the current system with domain sharking is awful. All the good names are taken and not put to good use. I've been thinking hat it would be good if you had to earn a name by providing something valuable or at least use it. Like, if someone is just sharking a domain, wasting oeoples time, they ciuld somehow ""outvote"" him. Or that it requires some kind of popularity or consent to exist  Sorry for the brain diarrhea, but I'm so excited by this idea. This is what I've been wishing for for years. :-)"

Fiber is generally the best available option, though its expensiveness gives other solutions a fighting chance.  Right now, we are primarily focused on creating local community meshes that seamlessly communicate using existing infrastructure for long-distance bridging. An example would be a community with one or two high-bandwidth links into the traditional internet, relaying CJDNS packets between meshlocals. This allows us to build at a scale that makes sense, until we have the momentum and finances to reconsider the long-range link situation."

darknetplan,1hldhm,matteotom,2,Fri Jul 5 01:47:35 2013 UTC,"some things can be done by long-range wireless links and wires/fiber, but especially the continent part will probably rely a lot on transporting traffic as hidden as possible trough ""normal"" infrastructure. Alternatives/slower backups might be ham radio or ""sneakernet"". ham radio has the complication that is HAS to be clear text, because it is intended for emergency communications and experimentation (not sure if this is true everywhere, for most of Europe and the US it is). Very slow wireless links can stay undetected, but if they have to transmit between continents their speed becomes unusable (the lower the power with that you arrive at the receiver is, the slower your transmission speed has to be or your signal is lost in noise)  ""Sneakernet"" is the idea of a guy in running shoes carrying hard drives being the fastest way to transfer big amounts of data in a city or a building with slow networks. The ""latency"" is very high, but the data ""transfer rate"" is still decent just because of the giantic size of the ""data packet"".  (carrying a 2 TB disk in one day still works out to 23 MByte/second)  One could link lokal meshnets by using traveling people, e.g. someone commutes between two towns, at home his laptop connects to one network, buffers data, then he goes to work and the data is synced to a local node there.   There were a few prototypes already of tools for smartphones that broadcast to everyone nearby and so flooded messages to everybody in the network eventually. Link meshnets in there and you can have intercontinental messaging (nodes near airports and hotels give fastest possible access to travellers). Or this could at least augment slower links, so metadata is exchanged over those. If someone requests a big file from somewhere else this is communicated and it is put on the next possible candidates to carry it over.  EDIT: for between cities: just remembered the story of the company that uses carrier pidgeons to transport backups in africa. Or the high-tech version, small drones carrying disks every few hours?"

darknetplan,1h9g3e,nunyabuizness,12,Fri Jun 28 18:06:05 2013 UTC,"The Internet has several layers of protocols:   application layer (for example DHCP, FTP, HTTP, SPDY, now QUIC) transport layer (for example TCP, UDP) Internet layer (for example IPv4/6, ICMP, IPsec) Link layer (for example PPP, Ethernet)   Each layer (except the link layer) is essentially running on top of some protocol from the layer below it (that's why sometimes you'll see mention of ""TCP/IP"" - that's ""TCP protocol running on top of the IP protocol""). When you go to Google, your browser uses HTTP or HTTPS - but you aren't just using HTTP, you're using HTTP on top of TCP, on top of IPv4 or v6, on top of Ethernet (or PPP, or whatever your modem/network equipment uses).  Admittedly I haven't done much with regard to the Meshnet except read some stuff on this subreddit - but to my understanding CJDNS and the hardware it runs on essentially provides the link and Internet layers. Then you still can use all the other protocols on top of that, just like on the Internet.  So to answer the question - this probably doesn't have any particular implications with regard to the project. It's an application layer protocol that runs on top of UDP - to any equipment between the two endpoints (gateways, routers, nodes in the Meshnet, whatever) it's just a bunch of UDP packets, they don't necessarily even know or care that the packets contain QUIC data."

Sure, it's good that it exists and we all like fast connections, and it will be entirely agnostic towards the protocol underneath it. Saying that QUIC will be beneficial to the meshnet is similar to saying that your new, revolutionary banking application will be beneficial to the meshnet.

darknetplan,1h9g3e,netraven5000,2,Fri Jun 28 20:56:05 2013 UTC,"You don't think google knows a thing or two about the web?   Google knows a lot about the Web, for example they know that UDP doesn't require a handshake... But Google is trying to get you to use their service and make their service faster, not necessarily trying to build a new network.   Alternate protocols can be used between proxies to speed up TCP between remote locations   I think maybe you meant to say ""alternate protocols can be used between proxies to speed up HTTP requests between remote locations""?  TCP and UDP are both transport-layer protocols, and you can only use one transport-layer protocol (and it said QUIC uses UDP). If you have two proxies they might use something other than TCP to communicate - but they cannot speed up TCP, they either use it or they use something else.   To do it properly requires a priori knowledge of conditions on the WAN, which is not something TCP does per se.   Not sure where this comes from... UDP makes no attempt to figure out the conditions on the WAN, and TCP and QUIC are both using essentially the same means to figure it out (guess and check).   may be necessary for SSL since what proxies can do with an encrypted stream is limited   TLS is an application-layer protocol. It must be supported by the application."

darknetplan,1h9g3e,Rainfly_X,1 point,Fri Jun 28 23:09:58 2013 UTC,"For a second there, I thought you were talking about the kind of attack where you trigger as much recursive resolution as possible, and couldn't figure out how TCP could prevent it. Then I realized what you meant.  For the kids in the audience, a DNS amplification attack happens when you forge your UDP packets to have the wrong return address. Instead of your own IP, you use the one you want to attack. Then the DNS servers send the responses to your target, because they think they're responding to you. It's very effective when you use small requests that trigger large responses, and when you use multiple consumer-grade machines to attack from. This allows you to cheaply use high-bandwidth DNS servers as a weapon, shielding your identity and achieving a higher bandwidth flow than you otherwise could.  TCP prevents this, or at least discourages it, because of the handshake required to establish a connection. The DNS server will still send some sort of ACK packet to the target, but it will be tiny, probably smaller than the packet you sent to start the handshake. So it's pointlessly ineficcient to try to use this attack with TCP. Instead of magnifying the payload, you're diminishing it."

darknetplan,1h7eey,danry25,2,Fri Jun 28 00:06:15 2013 UTC,"yes I have but due to a number of reasons (one of which my extremely limited programming skills) I struggle to understand how exactly a cjdns node works and don't fully see the systems design.  TDMA for me personally is far easier since I don't have any big limitations to prevent me from getting into the architecture.  On a sidenote: OP's idea doesn't seem very viable to me because it's relocating far to much of the core networks responsibility's to the Base station subsystem. It would need a MSC, HLR ,etc... in every basestation and I think it goes without saying there's allot of good reason's why they didn't do that in the first place."
darknetplan,1h7eey,tris4992,1 point,Fri Jun 28 00:33:48 2013 UTC,"Mmm, I assume you dove in to the whitepaper and ended up losing what grip you had on how cjdns works? I've read the whitepaper a few times now, but I ended up reading the code comments (and occasionally the actual code) since the codebase is well commented.  For actually using cjdns day to day, you really don't need to understand it in depth, just a broad overview of how it works is generally good enough since it integrates with most (if not all) of your applications without you doing much of anything.  TDMA is funstuff too, but I think the OP needs to focus more on what is cheap and works well for setting up meshnets, namely all these high powered radios like Omnitiks and Nanostations that are fairly inexpensive right now.  As time goes on we can use TDMA schemes like AirMax and Nv2, but right now we need to get nodes up."

darknetplan,1h1riq,lukevers,7,Tue Jun 25 21:15:03 2013 UTC,"If you have zero programming experience, this is not a project to learn on. The learning curve is way too steep.  If you still want the skills that will get you here some day, I highly recommend the O'Reilly Physical Computing book (with the bunny on the cover) for beginners. I've read them all and this one is the best of the bunch.   Also get the K&R C programming book. It is the bible of C programming, and every other C book ever published is based on it. It's short, terse, and pretty dry, but there is none better. Do the exercises.  Once you have some hardware and programming knowledge under your belt, get 'Writing Great Code, Vol I.' Anyone programming small systems (or large) can learn from this book.  Finally, you're going to want to learn Linux. I can't recommend a book for this, as I learned it by installing it and messing with it for 20 years.  Good luck!"
darknetplan,1h1riq,playaspec,3,Wed Jun 26 00:04:44 2013 UTC,"As someone with zero programming experience, thank you for the reading list. I was just planning on trying to learn python but I don't know if that's the best language to start with. Would you recommend just reading those books and starting with C?  Also, since I have no experience a technical answer would probably go right over my head but could you briefly explain how someone would go about messing around with an OS? I've always wondered what people meant by this. I have Linux installed on a VM but I have no idea what I could do to start experimenting and learning about programming with it.  Edit: Are these the books you're talking about? Physical Computing, C programming, and Writing Great Code?"
darknetplan,1h1riq,DevilsWeed,3,Wed Jun 26 04:57:19 2013 UTC,"Speaking from personal experience, I'd just start using it as your main OS, and find the little things in it that annoy you. By finding out how to fix the little annoyances, you'll be messing with the system, and learning how to change things. You'll be able to completely mould it the way you want it, and you'll pick up a good knowledge of Linux. Google will be a good friend here to learn how to fix things, but as your knowledge grows you'll find less of a reliance on it."
darknetplan,1h1riq,pwnurface999,1 point,Wed Jun 26 06:04:40 2013 UTC,"True, so basically going through the code and changing it to try to fix things once you find stuff you don't like about it? Makes sense, thanks for the reply. I'll have to start using my VM a lot more. I've also been thinking about getting one of the Raspberry Pi computers to mess around with."
darknetplan,1h1riq,DevilsWeed,2,Wed Jun 26 06:14:00 2013 UTC,"Yup anytime, I personally would dual boot, so you're fully immersed within the OS, when I use VMs, I find myself using the host OS much more that the guest OS."
darknetplan,1h1riq,pwnurface999,2,Wed Jun 26 06:30:47 2013 UTC,That's a good idea. I set up the VM thinking I would use it all the time but I've pretty much gone back to exclusively using my host OS.
darknetplan,1h1riq,DevilsWeed,2,Wed Jun 26 06:34:37 2013 UTC,"If you're new to Linux I recommend a dual boot set up with Ubuntu, if you feel comfortable with Linux and using a CLI I would try arch Linux, it's very command line oriented, a bit more advanced."
darknetplan,1h1riq,pwnurface999,2,Wed Jun 26 06:40:25 2013 UTC,"Yeah I'm new to Linux too, I'm running Lubuntu on my VM right now. Dual booting seems like a good way to go though, is there any recommended reading before I attempt it?"
darknetplan,1h1riq,DevilsWeed,2,Wed Jun 26 06:49:14 2013 UTC,"Not really other than a guide if you get stuck along the way. However, it's a bit more difficult and complicated if you're on a system with UEFI, I just upgraded to a new laptop, and I'm going to set up a dual boot with Kali Linux, but it's a longer process than a non UEFI system"
darknetplan,1h1riq,pwnurface999,1 point,Wed Jun 26 06:59:22 2013 UTC,Alright cool. I...honestly have no idea about UEFI. I'll have to try and figure this out. Kali Linux looks very interesting though. Once I learn more about all this I think I'll have to play around with it.
darknetplan,1h1riq,DevilsWeed,2,Wed Jun 26 07:11:50 2013 UTC,"I can only contribute from my own experience but this may still help.  I would suggest reading Kernighan and Ritchie first and as playaspec advises, make sure you do the exercises!  Don't worry about fully understanding everything right away, everybody has a lot of questions about why things are a certain way when they start programming.  After you've gotten through that book, give yourself a break and play with Python for a bit.  The official tutorial here and doc pages are extensive, well organized, and easily searched.  For every Python book I've picked up I've always found myself returning to the documentation for elaboration and examples.  Python will give you the freedom to play around with some of the ideas that will undoubtedly be bouncing around in your head after your first exposure to C and is wonderful to use while you're still working out the kinks in your understanding of programming methodologies.  The best thing about using this pair of languages together is that Python is easily extended by C and at the same time can provide a scripting interface to your C projects.  Knowledge of C will allow you to tackle the low level hardware interfaces you may encounter while Python provides a quick and powerful way to rapidly develop more abstract programs."

darknetplan,1h1riq,DevilsWeed,1 point,Wed Jun 26 19:48:02 2013 UTC,"I haven't watched many of the Khan Academy videos but that's more to do with my learning style, I prefer written material over audio or video, but if you prefer video then by all means give it a try."

darknetplan,1h1riq,Rainfly_X,1 point,Wed Jun 26 22:34:05 2013 UTC,"Mesh network technology is is a broad field.   I would suggest looking at existing open source software tools that you want to port to be better supported on mesh networks. Support, in this case, means optimizing the tool to work on a network that may lose connections, is highly decentralized, and that has limited speed,.    Adding subscribe/publish methods of connectivity will allow the user to gather the data as they gain connectivity instead of having to pull all of the data at once over the network. This will also allow you to port the application to a delay tolerant network later.   Decentralization is a big perk for mesh applications, as it will allow for a user to access the closest instance of the application to gather the data instead of having every user on a network access a centralized instance, causing congestion. This is also good for ensuring that if instances of a tool get shut down or disconnected from the mesh that users will still be able to access their data.  Taking an existing open source project, in a language you know, and trying to optimize it for a mesh environment will give you an opportunity to explore the limitations and perks of mesh networking, without having to build a project from scratch."

It uses Bittorrent's DHT, so if you want to start your own, that's cool. You may want to write a new UI (since it's not amazing, but decent) if you want more work for yourself."
darknetplan,1h0aok,anti-thought,13,Tue Jun 25 04:49:24 2013 UTC,"I do think that improving Retroshare might be a better option. Then we get all of the file transfer functionality already present.

I know it's nice to start and run a project from scratch but  Do we really need another piece of undeveloped software?"
darknetplan,1h0aok,AFineTapestry,2,Tue Jun 25 14:18:15 2013 UTC,What we need is someone to really get it right. Jitsi is the closest to Skype I have seen and I don't see all that many good reviews for whatever reason. I also think competition is an amazing and welcomed thing.

As far as I can see, the problem is not only unsolved but entirely unmentioned.   asymmetric encryption(RSA?)  is used to encrypt the session keys for the symmetric(AES?)   I don't want to sound negative, but if you get the encryption wrong then the entire exercise is pointless. Be on the lookout for an expert here. Lacking an expert, you will have security holes in your encryption."
darknetplan,1h0aok,AceyJuan,3,Tue Jun 25 05:43:28 2013 UTC,"Public key distribution is something I'm curious about too. Right now with RetroShare I've been treating it like Friend-to-Friend rather than p2p, in that I use a flash drive to transfer my key to them. My friend and I on other sides of the country also used CryptoCat to transfer keys (I just didn't sign it). But you are right, it's not an easy problem."
darknetplan,1h0aok,anti-thought,4,Tue Jun 25 06:01:13 2013 UTC,Am I missing something? Why are you hiding your public key? Isn't the whole point of a public key to be public and not suffer security wise?   And if you are encrypting with your friends public key and your friend is encrypting with your public key and you are both decrypting with your private keys how does someone trying to eavesdrop in the middle gain anything but the encrypted messages?
darknetplan,1h0aok,TheMorphling,2,Tue Jun 25 06:53:46 2013 UTC,"The initial distribution of the key must be done securely and authenticatably, otherwise an attacker could MiTM your public key.  Hence, distributing your key in person. Another good choice is sending the same key through a multitude of communications channels such that an attacker would have to intercept and change every key imperceptibly (for example, post the full key publicly online, then call up your friend and read them the fingerprint of the key)."
darknetplan,1h0aok,nonsense_factory,6,Tue Jun 25 11:19:33 2013 UTC,"Typically, you distribute the public key on a public server, and distribute only the hash of the key by hand.  It's verifying the hash that makes the public distribution secure."

But yeah, instead of adding your friends email address just add their publickey."
darknetplan,1h0aok,TheMorphling,2,Tue Jun 25 15:17:52 2013 UTC,"Yes, exactly that. Also, an attacker with sufficient computing power needn't worry too much about the lag.  I was just explaining why they were communicating their key as they did."

It doesn't have what I want, so I'm going to abandon it and hope everyone comes over to my new program which doesn't have what they want. If we keep this up we will never have what anyone wants.  We don't necessarily need to choose a common client but we do need to choose common protocols because there's a good chance I might not like the client you chose. Jingle, XMPP and some of the others have made strong headway.

They start trying to build their own and find the hard way that it's easier said than done, and then it gets stuck in the same state as the project they abandoned it for.  If people want to do this, I see two good options: latch on to Ekiga, Empathy, Jitsi, or another client that is already out there, somewhat well-known, included in major Linux distributions maybe; or go 100% WebRTC to create something that doesn't even require an installer."

The thing about Jitsi is that it's based on Java, which means you have to keep the JVM open to use it, and we all know how many security issues that has. If the NSA wanted to get you, they wouldn't need to ""break Jitsi"". They'd just have to break your buggy JVM to have access to your PC, and therefore to whatever you're typing.  So I'd prefer if there was an alternative, maybe based on Qt 5.1 (it's in beta now, and should be released soon with better support for Android and iOS), that can be easily ported to Windows/OSX/Linux/Android/iOS and others. Plus, if it's written in C++, it could be more easily ported to Chrome's Native Client later, too, or something, and could be used as a ""web app"", too.  For people to use it, it needs to be everywhere not just on one or two platforms, so this is a very important aspect, too, as is the design and user interface/ease of use. Most people won't touch an ugly app (sorry Retroshare). The good news is that if open source devs suck at design (as they usually do), they can now use a lot of Android/iOS/Ubuntu Touch default design resources, to at least make it decent looking, even on a PC.  It also wouldn't be bad if it came with novel encrypted communications ideas. I'd suggest looking more into how Bitmessage and Restroshare's P2P and authentication models work."

As far as privacy - this is obtaining privacy by encrypting the packets, which is something many other protocols do. Including Skype itself. There is no reason this couldn't be added to some other protocol, if it's not already there.

Maybe some are more about the security and redundancies and locking things down, and others are more about usability and functionality. People need and want different things. A single company and a single app is not going to help that. You can't just ""fix."" the app without losing other people who actually liked that part of it.  I'm not saying that forking the development and starting other versions of redphone is a bad option, I don't care how it's done, I just think everyone saying ""Well we have this."" is not even remotely a good way of thinking."

I am talking about the theoretical possibility of decentralized VOIP having the same number of steps as centralized VOIP.  I am making a theoretical point: that decentralized does not, in principle, require more steps.  If actual software requires more steps, it's because its UI was not done well -- not because it's impossible.  Now in fact, often, if you want to make a VOIP client connect to a particular server, you have to do something much more complicated than what you have to do to make a web browser connect to a particular server.

KN has several dealbreaker deficiencies that prevent it from ever being more than a simple toy.   A DNS system needs conflict resolution when multiple people try to grab the same domain. KN's conflict resolution is... nonexistent. Any number of people can call dibs on a domain and point it in all different directions. Which IP you see it resolve to depends on which nodes you're peered with, and a hell of a lot of random chance. With no cost or verification for registration, you also get the side effect that it's unfathomably easy to poison the network with bad data. Hell, point #1 is just well-meaning people doing this by accident. If you actually want to fuck things up on purpose, vandalism is trivial and there is no defense. The entire system is like ""DNS registry by a wiki page that any anonymous person can edit.""   KadNode, by design, cannot be used in any serious capacity. This is not something that can be fixed with a pull request, or really any number of pull requests, it's a fundamental incompatibility between the core model and the inherent demands of domain registration. Just because I can kind of almost golf with a crazy straw, does not make it a suitable club to bring to the course, it's simply the wrong tool for the job.  I don't want to shit all over KN for what it is - an interesting toy project. I just don't want anyone to get their hopes up that this will solve DNS issues in Hyperboria. It won't, it'll just make your name resolution very, very gullible.  There are other projects that actually account for these problems, in different ways. Namecoin is a good example that isn't too self-serving. They've put a ton of thought into information security, and it shows, even if their solution isn't universally agreed upon. And I myself have poured long hours into the same problem, which is why DJDNS is so close to having a working server available across the hype/clearnet border (I hope to have it set up by the end of the week, depending on work in cooperation with the developer of Lupa, one of DJDNS's dependencies).  Solutions are coming. Solutions that are actually appropriate for Hyperboria. They're just on the edge of availability. Have a tiny bit more patience."

That task is not verification but giving addresses for resource identifiers. DNS is a common way to resolve those resource identifiers into addresses. Verification should be done by the endpoint, e.g. the browser, not KadNode. This can be done by certificates in the browser or comparing the hash of the received file from the address in the realm of some Bittorrent application.  What is still missing is an automated feedback mechanism for when the result is not what was expected. At the moment it is only possible to explicitly block addresses but not via DNS (yet).  Thanks for the feedback. :-)"

Not that we shouldn't have additional security layers in place, but we shouldn't be relying on them full-weight either.  It isn't really a fixable problem, unfortunately. DHT is too poison-able, and there's no concept of canonical correctness/collision resolution, so it's all Node A's word against Node B. Error detection afterwards isn't a fix, it's a band-aid.  Sorry to be all harsh about this, but DHTs are just the wrong tool for the job when it comes to DNS registration.

KadNode should not try to be classical DNS. Imho, to fight over a specific domain is useless as it hurts both sides. I think the problem can be sidestepped by changing the way identfiers are generated and used (outside of KadNode). A DHT can be part of a solution. I think we have a common ground here.  What you seem to attack is that it looks like KadNode is trying to be classical DNS and satisfy classical DNS use/expectations.

You're right in the sense that KadNode only fulfills one small part of what classical DNS does, and does not work as a complete replacement. However, there's a lot to be gained from tricking people with bad resolutions, phishing is just the most boringly obvious.  So you have to have those concerns handled somewhere, and in many cases they will be more ""expensive"" than the original lookup (which itself is not inherently all that fast), so in the end you come out with slower, less reliable resolutions that you need extra software to verify, and no authority or algorithm to handle resolution tug-of-war like the ffmpeg coup.  Until these problems are sorted out, my opinion on KadNode will remain as it is now: interesting proof-of-concept, but just useful enough to be very, very dangerous. If/when validation is available, you should either embed it into your project directly, or recommend its installation in your README in a really big font."

They are WiFi based but they should offer enough control you can set the ACK timing (which is what will artificially limit your range with WiFi).  I'm on my phone so I can't dig up a link but the Xagyl 70cm band cards were tested in an LOS situation and gave a few Mbps over a distance of 34 miles. Might not be adequate enough for balloons but it gives an idea of what is possible.  Also, since you're all hams check out /r/amateurradio. They might have better advice.  edit: Antenna side though: I've seen interesting things done with circular polarized cloverleaf antennas (roof mount, 900mhz, handled telemetry rather well.

The tl;dr is Doodle Labs might have slightly better throughput but Xagyl can put out a bit more power (600mW vs 1000mW). Xagyl cards are also available without the hassle of importing from SE Asia.  If you've got any questions feel free to ask. If you have any specific questions about the Xagyl XC420M I do have a pair of those I can mess with.

The architects of the Internet and the people running the world's DNS servers aren't some dark cabal.   The Internet's design, architecture, and protocols are open and available for everyone to learn. They set up their own Linux computers and their own DNS servers, which shows that they aren't bound to some highly proprietary technology. They traced the path that their Internet traffic took, which means that there is a degree of inherent openness in the system. They could set up an entire network spanning a huge geographic area where all information over public channels is encrypted just like top secret gov't information, using open technology and well-known best practices, and no one would think twice about it.  People have the freedom to set up their own DNS servers, their own routers, their own VPNs that use the same crypto that the gov't uses - the algorithms are even open to public scrutiny and research. No one forces another person to sign up for a social media service, or use a particular search engine, or even use Windows or the Internet at all.

My thinking is that a CJDNS p2p cache of sites on the internet, if set up correctly, could ultimately BE the primary internet. People accessing ICANN domains and CJDNS distributed addresses from the same browser with zero switching, and gradually relying more upon the p2p cache than the unreliable, DDOS prone centralised copies."

As to a p2p cache of the internet, a squid proxy at your local friendly internet exit or on your local IPv4 internet connection is the closest your going to have for the moment, but maybe a p2p version of the squid cache could be made to cache popular content from the internet.

Asto the trust network i as thinking we could just use DEJE for that, it already forms a trust network for DNS, and your trust network for cacheing would likely be identical if you were to spin up a seperate DEJE network from the main DJDNS centric DEJE network.

Unless you're suggesting this local cache should pull content from the p2p caches, which is a very dangerous idea. There's also not much point in using TLS from your machine to your machine.  I hadn't heard of the deje or djdns projects, they look interesting, but it is very early days for them. I'm not sure how their trust model works. If it was me I'd throw my time into helping them out first, rather than trying to build a system on top of them. Also check out monkeysphere for how the pgp web of trust can be used to validate TLS certs. It could be extended to work for dns as well.   also, I was planning to utilize a good number of checksums so that you can't give out altered pages or shit like that   Where do you fetch the checksum/hash from? Your new system built using DEJE? Also keep in mind that much of the content you'll be pulling will be dynamic, and that cache misses will be extremely common - where do you get the hash for them? How do you check that it hasn't been tampered with? How do you check that your cache hit wasn't really a fraudulent cache miss? How do you avoid false positives when content is dynamic or when static content is updated?"
darknetplan,1gfugb,danry25,1 point,Wed Jul 3 04:02:55 2013 UTC,"There are a slew of potential pitfalls with a system like this, and at best the cache hit rate will be around 10%, but that is worth it. As to  working on DEJE, its already at a usable point, but I do plan to work on it a bit more and contribute my patches to the main DEJE repository.  Overall, there is still a fair bit of logic to build, but I do think DEJE + Squid is something that can be rolled into a nice little package that'll act as a distributed web cache."

There are several models of a ""darknet"" but the most likely will not be meshnets for a myriad of reasons the most significant of which is speed.  Another significant problem is the limitation of wifi.  a.)  Operating a wifi meshnet causes tons of radio pollution.  If everyone started interconnecting their routers, the WiFi band would quickly reach saturation and become unusable.  b.) in places like the U.S. there are large spans where WiFi cannot traverse (without illegal signal boosting).  If you want any sort of usable speed in a darknet you are going to have to use the existing infrastructure and use layers and protocols to maintain persistent secure connections.  CJDNS is a great idea if we can ever get it off the ground.  The problem that you describe is really no problem at all.  If you make a persistent secure connection you are already tunneling through the firewall as you would with a VPN, SSH etc.  From there the OS handles ports virtually.   Edit:  To make the concept more clear, think of torrenting.  It's generally not necessary to forward ports when torrenting if you use UPnP.  Almost all routers have this enabled by default.  If we wrote a program that launched a vpn and CJDNS, we'd use UPnP to tunnel out, and a DHT of other clients.  From there traffic would be virtually routed through any connected client's connection."

Light speed through glass is 2/3 the speed of light through air.    Operating a wifi meshnet causes tons of radio pollution   There's no such thing as radio pollution unless you have a central regulator requiring specific transmission types within a specific band, such as the FCC, and even so the worst you can do is raise the local noise floor. Any given transmission falls off in power/m2 by 1/r2, which becomes prohibitively expensive fast - to broadcast a 31 mile radius at FM strengths takes 100kW but can be easily overpowered over shorter distances at much lower strengths by other senders.    If everyone started interconnecting their routers, the WiFi band would quickly reach saturation and become unusable. b.) in places like the U.S. there are large spans where WiFi cannot traverse (without illegal signal boosting).   We don't have proper protocols designed for meshnets currently. Using wifi as comparison just doesn't make sense, its protocols weren't designed with the needs of a mesh in mind. And you'd only use mesh to connect to your local wireless network, there would still be fiber available for long-distance data transmissions. Without a local provider owning your ""last mile"" it'll be much cheaper to just rent capacity on an as-needed basis from a fiber owner. Businesses & many people will still have wired network access. Wireless is local, it is always local.   What a mesh net needs is a cognitive software ultrawideband radio. Cognitive means it listens for transmissions and only tries to transmit when no one else is currently on the channel. Software means that it can decode any protocol, Wi Fi, WiMax,  802.11ac, AM/FM, UHF/VHF*, and so on, all on the fly. Ultrawideband means it can transmit the frequencies from a very broad spectrum, including all the most common ones and lots of uncommon ones.

If I personally want to host data, there is nothing technically preventing me except the interface. I can do it - that's not the point.   The point is, unless my grandmother can save a file and tell people the direct address to that file, we do not have a viable distributed internet. This is the absolute baseline. End user sharing of files/pinging directly.  You mention hurdles we will find along the way, and they are legitimate concerns. Maybe once my grandmother encounters those concerns instead of the ones presented by centralised infrastructure, we can begin to address those also. (bandwidth is infinite ultimately, even though our technology gives us limited access)  There are solutions there, but the goal has to be clear: My grandmother saves a file and shares the direct location with anyone in the world.

The reason we don't use this today is because it is not WAN friendly.  Use Bitmessage.    But again, if you are using a persistent tunnel that is independently routing traffic from node to node, using a DHT to discover nodes - the real question is ""Are we running a traditional VPN?  Or are we just routing traffic in a Bittorent fashion?  If you have a p2p internetworked and routed system, ip address in the traditional sense has no meaning because you are operating in the application layer.  I'm not going to address Internet routing and exit nodes here but that code can literally be ripped directly from the Tor project.  Each node would have an identifier of some kind or they wouldn't be discoverable for DHT.  However if you want to keep everything encrypted and Anonymous you cannot assume that this identifier is going to stay the same and you cannot send traffic directly to it. They literally have to be virtual identifiers that have no meaning outside of the network.  I'm picturing it as a cross between tor and bittorent (and a meshnet)  Your ISP will only see that you have persistent encrypted connections to peers.  Which incidentally is a lot like SSL and if it were done on port 443, would probably be indistinguishable (at a glance) from normal encrypted web streaming.  You need a service like bitmessage that uses a set of protocols to facilitate the communication.  This can't be TCP/IP due to operating in an abstraction however it could make further use of the DHT discovery I was talking about.  Most of the groundwork has already been done with Tor and i2p - the trick is combining them in a way that supports all network traffic in a ""one click"" solution.  I'll keep chewing over this.  I certainly have the network administration experience to understand the network aspect of it but the programming end is not my strength.  Sure I can rip code from the tor project and probably have something that works on Linux to prototype.  But I am a relative beginner when it comes to C++ and am sure to make all kinds of mistakes."

darknetplan,1g6zbm,danry25,7,Wed Jun 12 16:07:53 2013 UTC,it is in discussion and todo list to fix this issue.   maybe make a thread in one of the devel-forums to put some pressure on the to-do list for ipv6  update: it is the next thing on the todo list after redesign and recoding of the new cache-GXS System
darknetplan,1g6zbm,danry25,3,Wed Jun 12 17:24:02 2013 UTC,Why would we use Retroshare over vanilla Freenet that is locked to Hyperboria only? The point of overlay networks on Hyperboria should be anonymity and or stable data storage imo.

darknetplan,1g6zbm,magicmuscle,1 point,Tue Jun 18 12:25:27 2013 UTC,"if freenet is P2P, there is a huge problem with ""störerhaftung""   Ah, but störerhaftung (aka liability of those storing stuff for someone else) is usually very limited since your storing encrypted data without knowing the key used to decrypt that data, and you are storing that data in good faith that it is legal content. IANAL, but I can get one of the Freenet people in here to talk on that subject if you want.   Freenet is done in JAVA ... nuff said   Lets be honest here, Java isn't that bad. While we all would prefer a C implementation of Freenet, there isn't one quite yet, but Frenet in Java is a first class, high quality application from my testing, unlike so many other applications that were written in Java.   all is stored everywhere... vs. F2F Turtle Routing and distributed forums/channels   Well, this way your friends can be lazy and you don't put them at risk to move your data.   i don't think both programs are compareable. But i think RetroShare has a few parts which makes it better, or makes it more convincing to try it. thats only my opinion.   They both seem to be functional internet overlays that store data in a distributed fashion, although RetroShare is much more immature and has no strong anonymity support baked in.   Maybe there are people which use both programms successfully.   Your looking at one :)   Anonymity is not the goal, it is privacy.

Hmm, I've seen this with torrents, but Tor, I2P and Freenet nodes rarely have that issue, since the lawyer would need to have the decryption key (or other proof of what is contained in the encrypted datastream) to ask that they cease and desist.   If the network is running with P2P i will need something like PeerGuardian to filter all known lawyer IP's ... If a file is stored in the freenet network, and a lawyer is connected to Freenet and loads this file, he can prosecute the last node, the last connected freenet-user, which is delivering the file. --> Störerhaftung.   Not really, Freenet has strong anonymity, you don't know where that data you requested originally came from, and additionally relay nodes are protected under common carrier laws just like you ISP is.   all is stored everywhere... vs. F2F Turtle Routing and distributed forums/channels Well, this way your friends can be lazy and you don't put them at risk to move your data. I dont understand...   Basically, F2F networks put your friends at risk, and make them do work to move your data. Freenet is faster if you list a few nodes you trust, even minimally, but it isn't inherently a F2F network that forces you to needlessly put your friends at risk.   Sometimes Anonymity is necessary. Thats True. RetroShare can only offer Pseudonymity. Or if it is used in strict-Darknet Mode and using ANON as nickname everytime.   Yea, just from an architecture standpoint Freenet has me won over, plus the IRC support community is solid.   Why do you think its immature? Which parts. The core Parts and technology is rock solid. And it is under steady development. the GXS things will bring a boost in performance and cache management.   Primarily the lack of IPv6 support is why I think its immature, same goes for i2p and Tor, the latter of which leaks your IPv4 address when attempting to make an IPv6 only Tor bridge."

Most of them become free man after the trial, but they face big Trial costs and seizure of all of their equipment for more than 6 months.

darknetplan,1g4bsu,ReyTheRed,2,Tue Jun 11 19:52:58 2013 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure of how the technology works, but my understanding is that the decentralized nature of meshnets and encryption are separate, the internet as it is can be encrypted or unencrypted, and a meshnet can be encrypted or unencrypted.  Having a meshnet lets us keep communicating if an ISP or the government tries to shut down the connection, and it lets us set how the network works (for example, an ISP could prevent certain types of encryption in some situations, on a meshnet we can avoid that), but it is the encryption that keeps our information private."
darknetplan,1g4bsu,OmicronNine,4,Tue Jun 11 20:03:25 2013 UTC,"One of the distinctive qualities of CJDNS is that strong end-to-end encryption is seamlessly built in to the protocol, and it fact the protocol relies on encryption to even function. This is quite different from the internet where end-to-end encryption requires users to do the work and put in the effort to learn and use it.   Having a meshnet lets us keep communicating if an ISP or the government tries to shut down the connection, and it lets us set how the network works (for example, an ISP could prevent certain types of encryption in some situations, on a meshnet we can avoid that), but it is the encryption that keeps our information private.   Both are critical. Even if you encrypt 100% of your communications end-to-end, ISPs and governments can still use their control over your connection to do things like block communications that they cannot monitor (i.e. ""unapproved"" encryption) or even cut you off. Without both pieces of the puzzle (the darknet to keep you safe from surveillance, and the meshnet to keep you safe from censorship/blocking), you effectively have neither.  EDIT: Incidentally, that's why the biggest thing to come out of /r/darknetplan is project meshnet. The lack of an alternative to the centrally controlled internet turned out to be the biggest vulnerability to current darknets."

I'm planning to do a bit of media outreach this upcoming weekend, so next week we'll hopefully have a few articles to add to that list."

darknetplan,1g264n,RainAndWind,18,Mon Jun 10 18:22:18 2013 UTC,"Implementing lossy compression like h.265 and similar as some sort of mandatory thing, and really trying to do any built-in re-encoding of media in general, is a bad idea. Data should always be received as sent, and media should be properly compressed in the first place anyway.  That said, a fast, simple, lossless compression built in to the protocol wouldn't be such a bad idea, though perhaps mostly unnecessary. Such things are more commonly handled by higher level protocols, and there really isn't as much room for improvement as you imply. Modern browsers and web servers, for instance, already support compression. Chances are, you are already receiving your HTML (and most everything else) in compressed form and you just don't know it."
darknetplan,1g264n,OmicronNine,1 point,Mon Jun 10 19:41:20 2013 UTC,"That said, a fast, simple, lossless compression built in to the protocol wouldn't be such a bad idea, though perhaps mostly unnecessary.   The better text compressions works best when a lot of information is compressed at once. So emails, wikipedia, entire webpages (all css, javascript, html), chat logs, forums. But it's probably not worth the gain over gzip if people are still downloading JPEGs.   and really trying to do any built-in re-encoding of media in general, is a bad idea   I do agree, I think for it to work well it would have to come from the website owner's implementation. But this compression technology is useful for the regular internet as well.  Google have been trying to make a difference lately with WebP. They've also released a chrome 'on the go' booster which gzips everything and converts images to WebP and uses the new SPDY only (which is encryption mandatory I believe?). But yeah, having to relay it through google servers first is a bit of a privacy issue.  Would it be crazy to think we could create a 'new secure internet' that must require certain file types for webpages, intense modern compression, and encryption mandatory? or is that a pipe dream. Data would still go through, just as data."
darknetplan,1g264n,danry25,4,Tue Jun 11 07:47:06 2013 UTC,"Mmm, I have always been interested in adding compression to cjdns, along with connection bonding."

darknetplan,1g264n,Stupid_Otaku,0,Mon Jun 10 21:58:06 2013 UTC,"From what I've heard VP9 is hardly an improvement on H.264, provided that you use the x264 encoder. H.265 is a significant improvement on H.264, but it faces a few problems. It needs hardware support for it to take off like H.264 did, which will at least be 5 years or so, and its ""2x"" compression equals around 2-4x the processing power needed to decode H.264. Eventually H.265 will replace H.264, but calling H.264 ""outdated"" when half the problems of H.265 going mainstream are unresolved...not to mention an encoder that's as refined as x264 for H.265 is at least years out."
darknetplan,1g264n,matteotom,3,Sat Jul 6 21:51:19 2013 UTC,"While it would be great to integrate compression into cjdns, I'm not sure how much benefit it would have. While text does compress very well, it's also much smaller than other mediums, mostly pictures and videos.  And, unless the server admin is an idiot, those should already be compressed very well.  So basically, I don't know that the bandwidth saved by compressing the html, css, and other text would be worth the time it would take to build compression into cjdns."
darknetplan,1g264n,sli,2,Mon Jun 10 19:25:05 2013 UTC,Have you ever uncompressed something compressed with PAQ8? It would take longer than downloading the larger text file. I think LZMA is a good tradeoff between speed and efficiency.
darknetplan,1g264n,OppositeOfOxymoron,2,Tue Jun 11 04:02:29 2013 UTC,"In the long run though, even if it did take slightly longer due to decompression times, the overall strain on the bandwidth in the network would be much less.  I'm also thinking about for the future too, because cpu's are only going to get faster, and hardware is what we can control, it's the network between the computers that is delicate.  It could also increase the reach of a meshnet. If someone was far away from the access point and could only get 10KB/s or so, they wouldn't be totally isolated. Getting stuff to load even at 10KB/s is ridiculous on most websites nowadays as they seem to be almost pushing 2MB for a homepage."

In Seattle, we are working to become a 501c3 non-profit, with the purpose of building and supporting a mesh network in Seattle.  Other cities could follow our lead, and start non-profits providing free access, or create a for-profit ISP to build and sell the network.  Personally, I think the non-profit model will prove more successful, since it will get more people involved because of the cost (free) and be more trustworthy in the eyes of the community."
darknetplan,1g0suo,matteotom,2,Mon Jun 10 19:18:02 2013 UTC,"I agree that it would be easy   I have no idea if such an endeavour would be easy. I am merely speculating the benefits and advantages. One major advantage a pro-mesh ISP run by young people would have over legacy telecom (as I am referring to them now) is the cleverness to use open source stacks (OpenBSD etc) on redundant commodity hardware (heartbeat mechanisms, link aggregation) to dramatically cut costs.   more trustworthy in the eyes of the community.   As a business, I don't care if you are non-profit or for-profit, I want a strong SLA and as a CTO (I am not a CTO, but I have reported directly to CTOs and CEOs) I care that I can bridge with my neighbor and indirectly use my neighbor's pro-mesh ISP (that is in competition with mine).

darknetplan,1fxyvy,swax,5,Sun Jun 9 07:11:17 2013 UTC,"Network wise it's similar to RetroShare - a DHT where nodes are identified by their public key, and all traffic runs over random posts and is encrypted so that it cannot be fingerprinted as DeOps.  NATed and firewalled hosts are supported as there is proxying and UDP hole punching built into DeOps as well as swarming file transfers and replication of data around the network (signed by the sender and encrypted with the recipients public key.)  What makes it different is that there is another level of security built on top of the private network, the trust hierarchy. You can choose one person to trust, and everyone trusting one other person builds the hierarchy.  Trust can be changed at will, but it is always a bottom-up process, where you choose who you trust and they accept it.  All the services in DeOps are built with the hierarchy in mind - there's a distributed file system where you reflect your superiors, but they don't necessarily reflect your branch - think different departments with different files. Even so, all files are evenly distributed are persisted around the network for offline access.   There's also message boards, a scheduling/planning component, chat and voice chat. All built with a large scale hierarchical organization in mind so that even if the network scaled into 10,000 users for instance, any one user would not be bombarded with a lot of noise, just what is relevant to them in their own part of the organization."
darknetplan,1fxyvy,swax,2,Sun Jun 9 15:32:03 2013 UTC,"With hierarchy, how would this go for distributed file management? I imagine one user approving their subordinate's work, then it goes on up, and up and up. Every time it goes up a level, are all the files of the the subordinates of that level automatically updated?  Is it possible to only subscribe to specific files or sets of files and have those changes pushed to you? How do you minimize small changes on large files creating large histories, which is a problem with git? Why Windows?"
darknetplan,1fxyvy,varikonniemi,3,Sun Jun 9 07:53:03 2013 UTC,"Yes, as the file moves up it is replicated to the appropriate sub-ordinates. DeOps also supports 'projects' which are alternate hierarchies within the same organization which can use the same services provided by the primary functional hierarchy. Think cross functional teams from different departments working on a common project.   What I have is basically version 1 of a distributed file system. I have a list a mile long of things that would be cool to implement like compartmentalization of data to specific branches. To keep file history down I've limited it to 5 by default, but can be changed. The files themselves are kept distributed around the network.  I chose .Net because it's portable - windows, mac, linux, iPhone, android, winPhone - Xamarin provides pretty good support to every platform. The potential is there to write front-ends for anything. I have the core broken out and a small console client I use to host a DeOps persistent instance alongside my web server on EC2."

The console client can be used to create a persistent presence of yourself as well as providing a stable point on the network. For instance I created a DeOps profile for myself using the gui client, copied it over to the server and ran my profile with the console client on a linux machine on EC2.   There is potential for a linux client as Mono has most of Windows.Forms implemented which is what DeOps uses. Last I tried there were still a few bugs to fix, nothing serious."

There could be scores of them, thousands of them, with the client picking one at random and shifting around at random intervals.  This adds complexity, if Alice wants to connect to Bob she needs to know (one of) Bob's ICE server(s), then ask her ICE server to hook her up.  Her ICE server then needs to connect to Bob's - which might mean polling a few dozen until Bob is found.  This would slow things down, but I don't think it is impossible."

My plan is to teach civic technologists in 10 cities how to organize community mesh wireless networks, and leave them with the routers to seed their own networks. This train will travel through those 10 cities and stop one day at a time in August. I've helped organize these networks before, and have a familiarity with Commotion.

Also, what exactly is your ground plan, have you contacted anyone on the ground in the 8 cities in between San Francisco and D.C. & gotten the ball rolling on getting everything lined up to set up nodes? Most of the work in setting up local meshnets is generally contacting potential node locations to get a radio in a semi-decent place, and your likely not going to be able to hunt down 20+ node locations in each city in one day without contacting someone in each city first.

The actual content you can reach through each platform should be irrelevant, as what you access comes down to user choice for both platforms  The important thing should be the legitimacy of the security and anonymity it offers and how well that can aid people in their defense of freedom and free speech.  I am not saying that the users of said technologies cannot police themselves as it were and I DO think that a certain level of moral thought should be employed when one is using them, but these discussions should be made separately and labeled as philosophical. The discussion of the technology should be separate from this.   Let me make an analogy to illustrate my point. It would be seen as a completely unreasonable argument to debate whether trucks or smart-cars are a better technology by comparing how many people drive one vs the other, or by saying something like ""more kidnapping victims end up in trucks rather than smart cars"". Neither of those claims have anything to do with the technology or how it can be used or improved. They only deal with the user end implementation of the technology."

darknetplan,1fahfh,Rainfly_X,2,Thu May 30 21:57:16 2013 UTC,"Not OP but...    This is partially in response to rainfly-x’s post on the same topic.  I would recommend you go read this before reading what I’m writing.  When implementing paid bandwidth between nodes, the problem becomes: what do you do if a node accepts payment, but refuses to provide service?  After a short discussion with rainfly-x, we determined that it would not be to much of an issue if a node did this, because the payments would be small and an individual could simply blacklist the bad node.  However, we still want to limit the extent to which bad nodes receive payment as much as possible, to discourage people from making them.  Fortunately, nodes looking for payment would have to have verified speed tests from known sources, meaning not everyone with a wifi card could set up a bad node.  The most obvious solution to this issue is to have some sort of distributed black list, based off of some sort of web of trust (WOT).  How do we do this?  As the payer (client) and receiver of payment (server) continue to make payments and provide service, their mutual trust would go up.  When they first peer, trust would start at zero.  As time goes on, their trust would approach the maximum: 1.  Note that it would never actually reach 1, just continue to approach it.  At 1, the server and client would completely trust the black list of the other.  As it is, both the server and client would have to specify a value that would be considered “trustworthy,” above which they would accept black lists from the other, and below which they would not.  Now that we can establish trust, how do we determine the trust of a blacklist from a node that is not a direct peer?  It’s actually fairly simple: multiplication.  Each node will take the blacklist, with it’s trust values, from it’s peer, and then multiply each of those values by its own trust to that node.  For example: suppose we have nodes A, B, C, and D.  B and C have been peered for a while, and have a trust of 0.9.  B attempts to peer with A, and finds that A is a bad note.  That goes on B’s blacklist, with a trust of 1, because each node must trust itself 100%.  Then, B tells C about this.  C then multiplies B’s value by their mutual trust, giving C a value of 0.9 for the trust of the blacklist entry for A.  Assuming this is above the threshold that C has set for “trustworthy,” C will avoid peering with A in the future.  A couple days later, D peers with C.  Since their connection is new, their mutual trust will be low: let’s say 0.1.  When C passes its blacklist on to D, the value for A (0.9) gets multiplied by their trust, making D’s entry for A become 0.09.  This is likely much to low for D to trust, so D may attempt to peer with A in the future.  There are still a few things that need to be worked out before this idea would work properly:   First: how to deal with multiple peers giving me supporting or contradictory blacklist entries for a node?  Addition or subtraction would be first thing that comes to mind, but that cannot work because the trust must remain between 0 and 1 Second: How to ensure that a node doesn’t set arbitrary values for the trust of different entries?  The best answer I have at the moment is that each multiplication would have to be signed, but I’m not up to speed on how, exactly, that would work Third: What would prevent a node from generating a new cjdns ip address, and then re-doing speed tests, so it is no longer on anyone’s blacklist?  Well, speed test operator would have to be on the lookout for speed test requests coming from the same physical location, but with a different ip address and pubkey.   Thank you for reading, I know this was a bit long.

darknetplan,1fahfh,Rainfly_X,2,Sat Jun 1 00:51:53 2013 UTC,"I've been too busy to transcribe my thoughts (and the thoughts of others) from the Mumble meeting the other day, and forgot pretty much everything except my current opinion, so hopefully that's enough to still be a compelling comment.  I think the web of trust should be a distinct layer above the rating system. You have your trusted friends, and their trusted friends, etc., and you use those plus your own personal experience to periodically construct ratings data. You can then factor ratings into account as part of your route selection algorithm. You could even have these as part of the ""proof of quality"" data, much like the signed speed tests.  Ratings should start at 0 and increase with positive experience, or else bad actors may simply keep generating new CJDNS keys every time their rating drops below some threshold.  I'd just like to remind everyone that while no element of this system - blacklist design, fine-grained purchasing, and so on - is sufficient in isolation at preventing appreciable financial loss, the combination of these multiple heuristics should theoretically do a very nice job of keeping the network honest, and rewarding evil as little as possible.  Things I'm starting to remember from the convo:   Trust flowing from some nebulous ""network core."" IMHO, this really overpowers a tiny group of individuals. I'd much rather use a proper, multiplication-based web of trust (as in OP's article), which would be a truly decentralized trust graph even if it tends toward centralization through social texture. Bandwidth credits. An intriguing but ultimately wrong idea, simply because it's so easily gamed (or perhaps a better word is ""farmed""). It would be a lot of work to make such a thing reliable, and even then, for very little useful gain. Credits backed by trusted authorities. I believe this simply leads to balkanization of the monetary system, which is a serious problem when dealing with the chicken-and-egg issue of making your first cryptographic payment without internet access. It has the problem that the less authorities there are (i.e., the more centralized), the easier and more reliable it is to use, which is completely backwards in a distributed system. Possible payment mechanism within Bitcoin that acts in a really simple way: preload multiple offline wallets with small amounts of coinage, at common chunk prices. Paying for access to a route is as simple as handing over a private key! Very easy to get your head around, very easy to use."
darknetplan,1fahfh,Rainfly_X,2,Sat Jun 1 05:45:01 2013 UTC,"I like the preloading offline wallets idea. If there was a way to generate a wallet that only the receiver (and not the sender) could access (I think there is), that might also help lessen the problem of fees, as you could pay the minimum fee to transfer funds to the wallet a few days in advance, and then once the transaction is confirmed use that offline wallet, which the receiver could simply import.  Also, I made a nice, long blog post about what I remember of the conversation, here: http://blog.mtbentley.us/2013/05/more-on-paid-cjdns-and-network-trust  It's long, so take your time reading it."
darknetplan,1fahfh,Rainfly_X,2,Sat Jun 1 05:57:34 2013 UTC,"Really awesome! You did a much better job remembering and summarizing than I did, and expressed everything really clearly. I can't believe the downvotes you got for it, they weren't deserved.  As for wallets that only the receiver can access, that's a bit tricky. In order to guarantee that, you need a third party to know the private key, and the sender not to. So how can the sender tell the receiver something it doesn't know?  My answer: a trusted third-party wallet service (or protocol, more like, so anyone could provide this service in an automated way) where you can allocate and deposit into ""retrieve-once"" addresses, but never see the private or public key (BTC address = hash of public key). ""Retrieve-once"" means that you get a link, an HTTP URI, where you can retrieve the private key, but that URI is effectively one-time-use, with allowance for network errors. Within 5 minutes (or some other arbitrary timeout) of the first hit on that URI, the server will destroy its record of that URI, and it will 404 forevermore after that.  The workflow here is that you load up a bunch of retrieve-once addresses, where all you know is the URI that points to the key information, and you can hand over those URIs as payment instead of the private key. This gives the provider node an assurance that as long as she trusts the retrieve-once host, she can be sure that the private key information will be valid, and completely unknown to the sender.  Like any digital good, it would theoretically be pretty easy to sell preloaded and blank retrieve-once addresses via a NikNak server, so that would make sense with the rest of the infrastructure plans, and require as little reinvention of the wheel as possible."

The difficulty/cost of wiring up access to the clearnet is what empowers traditional ISPs to begin with. Hyperboria depends upon an active and empowered user base to spread and develop. In this regard a community wireless mesh could help to organize and simplify some of the problems with monetization.  Peninsulas in a meshnet still will still benefit from backhaul links to a clearnet gateway. If I understand how Hyperboria is supposed to work (and my understanding is still very shaky), all the peers are supposed to be 'trusted' connections anyways. A group of hyperboria users in a town or neighborhood could elect a 'supernode' of sorts to act as their gateway -- that is until another gateway becomes available through the adding of nodes -- I know that goes against the idea of a decentralized network since the gateway nodes would be elevated to sort of local ISPs, but that could change as the local market became more saturated. If organized this way, there would be no incentive to play Alice's game because all the members of the mesh are 'on the same side' so to speak. A communtiy wireless mesh as a legal entity would also be extremely useful to prevent anti-competitive measures by the ISPs that already exist in the local market."

Well, 'trusted' in the sense that 'I don't expect these people to try to run timing analysis on my packets'. Everything is encrypted in an onion-routing scheme, so your peers can't spy on your data or easily block specific types (or destinations) of traffic. The only thing you're trusting them not to do is to not use a concerted timing analysis to try to figure out who you're talking to, over which protocol, etc. For an example, researchers figured out that you can determine what people in a VOIP session are saying, even through encryption, because of the compression codec. When there's no interesting data, no interesting data will be transmitted, so you can use the size and shape of the packets to glue together a very basic waveform shape for the conversation, and use analysis software to turn that into text.   A group of hyperboria users in a town or neighborhood could elect a 'supernode' of sorts to act as their gateway   This is already handled via the natural price signals of the market. When a gateway node shows up, it will have speedtest stats to show off. If the price and link quality make sense to that node's neighbors, they will pay to peer with it, and their neighbors will use them for their primary upstream connection, etc. If a new gateway competitor shows up, the same sort of thing happens as people switch to whatever's best for them. In this way, you can foster natural price competition between gateway nodes. All completely decentralized, and with no voting necessary.   If organized this way, there would be no incentive to play Alice's game because all the members of the mesh are 'on the same side' so to speak. A communtiy wireless mesh as a legal entity would also be extremely useful to prevent anti-competitive measures by the ISPs that already exist in the local market.   Both are good points. However, the unfortunate 'other side' of the first point is that no one plays Alice's game because the topology is inflexible, centralized, and fragile. It cannot self-heal if the supernode goes down, even when other people start providing fallbacks. This defeats many of the core benefits of a mesh network.  A community mesh as a legal entity, though... that I can see. Something that works kinda like a credit union or something, allowing the mesh users in an area to act as a single democratic organization. That would be really important for credible pushback against ISP pressure in politics."

More helium and bigger balloons increases both the cost of the project and the likelihood of balloons being struck by birds, aircraft, etc. The balloons would have to be recharged regularly, requiring either a rotation system which would cost at least twice as much (every balloon would need at least one fully charged balloon on standby for when it needed a recharge) or a lot of downtime.   The most efficient thing to do would be to have two cables connected to each device, one for power and one for a network connection (just for the router; client devices on the ground still get wireless from the routers). The balloons will all still need maintenance, but only to repair the odd damaged balloon/cable and (rarely) to upgrade equipment."

darknetplan,1emjof,OmicronNine,3,Sun May 19 17:14:59 2013 UTC,"That is a complicated question... In a nut shell it's a protocol for a very wide mesh network with it's own address space running over tcp, self sustaining, autonomous and a few other buzz words.  The idea is that when you run a node, it looks around for other nodes and joins them, forming groups of up to 256 nodes in each group, each group is in turn forming a supergroup of up to  256 groups/nodes etc.  The network state is managed by sending different kinds of tracer packets, which keep a snapshot of the network, some of those tracers will bounce around the network indefinitely, others find cycles or routes etc.  It's a very very nice design concept, which you can read about in here and here and here.  It is also kind of all over the place, with documents describing it scattered across many websites, it has been maintained by 1 person for the past several years, and is still far away from being ready to roll over, hence this."

darknetplan,1emjof,OmicronNine,2,Mon May 20 02:27:50 2013 UTC,"There is absolutely no reason to work on ntk instead of other meshes. The opposite, in principle ntk will only flourish in an environment made up of loads of different mesh technologies.  As far as i know, there are no protocols quite similar to ntk, it can fill a different void sort of speak. I'll try and elaborate: if batman and OSLR are very good at creating static wireless meshes, with say commotion they are very good at building a dynamic fast changing wireless mesh.  On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have things like CJDNS and gnunet which work on a network of tunnels, or even I2P or TOR which in principle do a similar thing (Ignoring the finer details).  ntk abstract this and does something else, you can have a node with 1 neighbor physically close by on the wireless interface and another neighbor on the other side of the world using a tunnel or even a tunnel through cjdns/i2p/tor.  It's not as fast rebuilding routes as commotion, it's not as permanent building tunnels as cjdns, it's somewhere in the middle.  If the internet goes down cjdns goes down, i2p goes down, tor goes down but oslr and batman continue going, only on small local networks, ntk will only loose the tunnels, and so if 2 people in two towns running ntk can make a connection to each other, those two towns are connected (albeit on a separating set of size 1)."
darknetplan,1emjof,MissValeska,2,Mon May 20 09:55:20 2013 UTC,"Ah, I see. I was wondering why you seemed to be advancing a protocol that did little more then the CJDNS protocol that's already being worked on, and perhaps less. It's that you seem to have some significant misunderstandings about what CJDNS is.   On the opposite side of the spectrum, we have things like CJDNS and gnunet which work on a network of tunnels...   CJDNS is currently little more then a network of tunnels only because it is new and under development, and there are few actual meshnets for it to run over. A network of tunnels over the internet is not what CJDNS is intended for, and in fact the ultimate goal is to eliminate those tunnels entirely. CJDNS is really for what you claim ntk is for, establishing a self-sustaining, autonomous, very wide mesh network with it's own universal address space to run over and link together local meshnets (such as those created by batman-adv and OSLR), though in the case of CJDNS it runs under TCP/IP (or perhaps ""instead of"" depending on your point of view). What I didn't see was how ntk handles privacy and security, something that CJDNS handles very well. Does ntk offer anything that CJDNS does not already?  CJDNS is literally intended for when the internet goes down (or is censored), it is not at all like i2p or tor.  [EDIT] Wow... as I look in to Netsukuku in more detail, it looks more and more like nothing but a cruder and less developed version of CJDNS. Surely I must be missing something?"

darknetplan,1edna6,nomadic_now,11,Wed May 15 15:25:09 2013 UTC,"I just don't see it.  • Right off the bat there is no way you're going to get a solar panel the size of a tablet to power said tablet.  Even for more expensive photovoltaic cells the amperage just isn't there.  • GMRS, MURS, and FRS all require the device to be FCC certified.  • GMRS requires an $80 per person (when I got mine anyway) license, but also allows intrafamilial communication with a licensee.  • FRS radios are limited to 500mW and MURS radios are limited to 2 watts.  USB provides 2 watts max (400mA at 5v), so it's definitely possible to reach/exceed the legal limits without being powered off the battery directly.  GMRS allows for significantly higher power, and subsequently range.  A connector for an external high-gain antenna (backpack pole or tripod mount most likely) would also do wonders.  • FRS and GMRS can definitely share an antenna, they are both 462mhz to 467mhz, a very small UHF split.  MURS on the other hand is VHF.  Including all three for a dualband radio tablet will skyrocket the construction cost, weight, power draw, and size.  Having said that, a VHF receiver is necessary for FM anyway.  • CB? That's another radio for HF AM. (They didn't include this but this mention is for you OP.)  • WiFi+Bluetooth is another radio  • Mobile internet, which they decided not to include, would have been another radio.  There are many, many people around the world who use packet radio.  Even so, if you think a small underpowered device like this with an integral antenna is going to be able to do more than transmit text (like gps data) or IRC over a radio service you're dead wrong.  You will be lucky to pull off 1kbps standing next to the second party.  With all of this it would be more like a boombox with a touchscreen and a microphone.  I don't see it for $2500, let alone $250.  They claim 20 hours on 3000mAh.  If everything is disabled the phone is suspended, I can see that.  They don't give a direct power rating for the solar panel but they do give a charge time of 5h for 3000mAh, or 600mAh.  Assuming that's at at least 5v I can see the tablet run off of it given the monochrome display, though you would rarely get the full 600 mAh out of it and would at least partially use the battery.  Despite all of this I would really love to be proven wrong."

Even for more expensive photovoltaic cells the amperage just isn't there.   A panel that size will be in the 3-5W range.  More than sufficient to fully power this device.  I think the e-ink screen will be the primary differentiator with other tablets here-- most of the time, it will use no power at all, since it holds the last image displayed.   This device will be much more like a Nook or a Kindle in power-consumption terms because of the screen.  Those devices use very small batteries by tablet standards, but have battery life closer to a month.  The i.MX CPU line is actually used in the Kindle 3, with a nearly identical screen and a 1750mAh battery.  This will have roughly double the battery capacity.  It's hard to overstate how large the power-consumption advantage is with e-ink compared to a backlit LCD."
darknetplan,1edna6,raygundan,2,Tue May 28 18:20:47 2013 UTC,"It's hard to overstate how large the power-consumption advantage is with e-ink compared to a backlit LCD.   I thought I touched on this but it seems I removed that part before posting.  They do indeed consume a fraction of the power under normal use let alone when not in use, but unlike an ereader or other device with static information to display the information this device would display (outside of say a simple map) would require updates no less frequently than the hundred millisecond range.  This would drastically increase the power consumption - though still a fraction of a backlit LCD.  There's also the issue of LCD temperature sensitivity, but that is another matter entirely."
darknetplan,1edna6,Ipuvaepe,1 point,Tue May 28 19:51:36 2013 UTC,"would require updates no less frequently than the hundred millisecond range   Well, I suppose that's true for when it's doing realtime updates, like when you're scrolling around-- but much of the time a person is looking at the screen, the screen is static.  As soon as you take your finger away and stop scrolling, the screen is ""off.""  It's not all the time, certainly, but I would wager a substantial fraction of use will be just staring at a map after you've scrolled to what you want to see, which is something an e-ink device can do with everything shut down.  Still-- that panel would probably be sufficient to power even a backlit-LCD device the same size in normal use.  An iPad mini only draws like 2.5W during use, and this panel will most likely provide more than that."
darknetplan,1edna6,raygundan,1 point,Tue May 28 20:28:20 2013 UTC,"I think you misunderstand.  The information that would be displayed would be frequently changing.  GPS coordinates, compass on a map (or even rotating the map itself), weather information, et cetera.  Virtually all of the information the screen would be used for would require frequent updates to be useful.  Because of this the e-ink screen would rarely be in its off state for long."
darknetplan,1edna6,Ipuvaepe,1 point,Tue May 28 20:39:15 2013 UTC,"I suppose we'll have to wait for the implementation to see-- but I would never have laid the software out that way.  If it were my project, the first priority with the UI design would be to make sure nothing on-screen updates by default without user interaction.  I wouldn't poll the weather hardware more than once every 15-30 minutes without a user request, and I wouldn't bother redrawing the map or GPS position at all unless the user asked for it.  Trail GPS devices spend most of their time hanging on a backpack strap, and most of them already have UIs that expect this and shut screen updates down without the user."

darknetplan,1edna6,mikasjoman,1 point,Thu May 16 04:29:20 2013 UTC,"I'm assuming the two-way antennas can only be used one at a time for short bursts. Still you've pointed out some pretty important details that basically all shoot this product full of holes. It seems sort of feasible to charge in 5 hours in direct sun but then I'm thinking ""who the fuck has 5 hours of sunlight that wouldn't require you to babysit this thing and keep turning it and dusting off the panel every few minutes"".  I did read that GMRS doesn't legally allow for encryption but I'm not clear on whether that eliminates plaintext data from the frequencies or not.  Do you suppose replacing the three two-way option with a single option (either MURS or FRS) would be good or bad?  And of course this machine is essentially marketed as a narrow-niche GPS unit as well so the two-way communication doesn't seem necessary beyond marketing gimmick.   I guess this isn't intended to be a walkie replacement and really how could it?  I do still hope this thing can either inspire something great or at least function decently enough to be a portion of what it claims to be."
darknetplan,1edna6,Ipuvaepe,2,Thu May 16 09:35:56 2013 UTC,"Short but frequent burst would likely be the mode of operation I agree.  It operates on the same principle as car remotes: The battery is very low capacity but such short infrequent burst require so little power that it can last for years.  In this case we're looking at much longer bursts containing a hell of a lot of rapidly changing information in regular intervals, say 500ms.  Moreover it's being transmitted at significantly higher power, I don't think I need to explain this part.  GMRS definitely forbids data/packet transmission, which virtually eliminates any (relatively) long-range communication.  With this limitation this leaves only FRS usable on the UHF radio, and with a maximum power of 500mW it's really not worth the space, cost, weight, or power draw.  I definitively recall data transmissions being an intended feature on MURS.  MURS operates on five frequencies in the 150MHz range.  I'm not an electrical engineer so I couldn't tell you if it's feasible or practical for a single radio to cover from 80MHz to 155MHz.  Throw marine VHF (see below for my comment on fishing use) at up to 162MHz and you have over 80MHz to cover.  Then again marine VHF just seems like asking for trouble, a $250 touchscreen novelty doesn't quite address the seriousness of it.  There's always the upside of multiple radios for concurrent use.  I'll run through some hypothetical use scenarios.  There's really no scenario when even half of the components could be useful.  Hiking, climbing, jogging, camping, road trip, park ranger, GPS nav, all of these and more are better served by existing cheaper devices.  Outside of small boat fishing, which I admit this would excel at, it's really not going to serve anyone well.  Something like this, if it was even possible, would be a specialized niche market at best."
darknetplan,1edna6,ronoverdrive,2,Thu May 16 14:13:33 2013 UTC,"With SDR technology it is possible to have a single radio cover multiple bands, however, the problem is not the radio but the antennas. You can have size, efficiency, or bandwidth but not all 3. A small broad band antenna won't be efficient. A small efficient antenna won't have much bandwidth. An efficient broadband antenna won't be small.  Essentially its not a radio problem, but an antenna problem. You need antennas for the WiFi/Bluetooth, GPS, and VHF/UHF radios crammed into the case in such a way to minimize crosstalk interference between the different radios which is not easy."

A pair of FRS radios is only like $60 these days, and the chips themselves are almost certainly cheaper than that.  An AM/FM/shortwave receiver can be had for $20.  Keep in mind also that $250 is the ""30% off"" price for backers.  That's likely a low-profit price.  But it seems doable even at retail.  If you went and just bought separate devices to do this stuff from Amazon, you'd get:  Kindle ($130) + Solar panel ($60) + FRS/GPRS radio ($30) + $20 receiver = $240."

Garmin's midrange Oregon series starts at $480 with 100k topo maps.  Their low-end eTrex 20 is $250 with 100k topo maps.  This is a substantially better GPS unit than even Garmin's $600 high end, for as cheap as their low end.  And unlike a Nook, it isn't being sold at cost (or at a loss) as a mechanism to sell content like books.    But yes, it costs more than its Bill of Materials.  Like all products.  If you're sensitive to this sort of thing, I suggest you don't ever look at the price of ingredients at a restaurant.   Edit: Downvoted?  Look, we can disagree on how much we think the parts cost, and we both agree that whatever they cost, it's less than the price of the unit.  However, I don't think you can call it ""overpriced for what it is"" when it is substantially cheaper than other, less-capable devices in the niche it occupies."

Many arguments that are basically fearmongering, yes, but no actual logical ones. The fact that countries like ""China, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia — and their allies"" like to censor things, is hardly relevant. The UN isn't run by those countries alone, so what does it matter? The arguments become especially hollow considering how the US itself seems to take delight in attempting to do the exact same thing. Admittedly with a lot less murdering of political opposition involved, but censorship nonetheless. In any case, the US will still retain a hell of a lot of control...so basically the opposition is just crying wolf because they don't want to share.  Please, enlighten me of any good arguments for keeping it under U.S. control. And no, appeals to tradition like ""they've done a good job for over 20 years"" does not qualify.  edit: I'd rather that nobody have control, naturally.

Internet connectivity itself is.  The 3G/4G nature of this design means you have to be within range of a tower.  You might as well use a portable hotspot in a case with an external battery.  A BGAN unit is probably the best guarantee of connectivity in Africa once you get away from the sparse cellular coverage.  If you go into the jungles then you're pretty much screwed unless you can find an open spot or have access and license to use HF data radios.

Currently working as an IP overlay, but with designs to work w/o IP, directly over the link layer. I've got a few posts about it on http://nei.ghbor.net/ and just the other day I got it running on top of CJDNS. By the end of the month I hope to have ~10 nodes in Boulder/Denver running a websocketproxy->CCNx->CJDNS stack ready to develop in javascript."

I swear if Xerox had a decent intellectual property division, they'd own the patents on most of what we think of as computers today.  Thanks for the info.  I'm thinking the routing protocol can be implemented in layer-3 with as few as 4 messages (Query, Response, Download Request, Download Reply), then using some tricks with a few flags in the packets in-line and some adaptive intelligence ripped out of OSPF to do the localized caching and path-cost indexing.  I'll digest some of the docs for CCNX and see what PARC has turned up.  They probably have some really interesting techniques to make stuff happen."

darknetplan,1dwief,danry25,2,Wed May 8 01:45:28 2013 UTC,"Ah, but Tahoe-LAFS on cjdns would effectively create what your proposing. Btw, there is no centralized node addressing scheme in cjdns, your IPv6 address is based on your publickey."
darknetplan,1dwief,wormnut,0,Wed May 8 05:29:51 2013 UTC,"Now this I could've phrased this better, my fault.  Single address space is probably a better term for what I mean.  In this way its not all that different from traditional routing.  Pubkey IP addressing makes collisions unlikely but also has the (un)fortunate side effect of adding higher assurity to the originator of content.  Tahoe doesn't avoid this either albeit it does provide a functional similarity.  I'd also be interested to learn more implementation-specific details, such as if one would run per-node Tahoe instances, allow full-access to the entire structure, or have localized instances.  Another advantage my scheme has in excess of Tahoe+cjdns is the Web of Trust model built in.  You're not downloading just any file, but rather ones that someone you trust explicitly trusts themselves.  I guess you can force this model into Tahoe but its not intrinsic to the design.  For the record, I don't want to imply that cjdns is a bad solution.  I just had some different thoughts as to how it could work."

Freenet is a great project (I have to say, its developers are very easy to talk to and genuinely nice people), but it means that things like videogames or IRC applications won't work, and the content in the network will have to be custom made for it, adding another barrier of entry to adding content to the network."
darknetplan,1dwief,michib,2,Wed May 8 01:36:13 2013 UTC,"Yup, I have.  And yes you are correct about the live communication problem.  However, I have a potential fix in the term of a hash-stream where live data is streamed across the network via a ""subscription"".  Implementation will be complex but doable.  In this way it'll work more like multicast in traditional networks, as opposed to requiring unicast.  If implemented as a filter driver though, you can drop the hash in anywhere a network address would've gone in, say, an HTML anchor tag or an IRC hostname, and it'll get you on the right hash-stream or find the right content."

The German society was the leaders in science, art, and free thinking in a parliamentary democracy but the image that Jews were to blame for poverty, inequality, terror, and can physically make you sick (bad genetics) - lead a population in willful suspension of reason to passively allow the trusted authority to fix the problem.  Make everyone feel safer by marking them, and eventually begin detaining and sentencing them for the crime that never existed anywhere except in the spin.  I understand ""this isn't the same"" but I also fully understand that propaganda still works the same way, and even better with the mass amount of data used to figure out ""how"" to manipulate responses.  It is a real threat if the people, (who just like the Germans of the time) who ""can"" think for themselves, don't adopt or research and understand ""for"" themselves simply because a trusted authority (like TIME) already told them how to ""feel"".  The emotional reaction is all they want which controls behavior and turns off critical thinking.  I understand calling this mind control, manipulation, propaganda, or other ""negatively charged terms"" dismiss these ideas readily.  Today we call it Public Relations.  And powerful people are still at the game, investing billions to repeat narratives about how to feel about new ideas or emerging sub-cultures.  Even if race no longer is the defining link between members of the culture, the powers still spin messages to manufacture consent to lock up members of that culture.   tl;drTo say that this isn't harmful to our movement is to put head in sand.  Words with an agenda ARE harmful.  The whole reason meshnetwork was a better term then darknet was because ""how"" the idea is introduced evokes entirely different ""feelings"" about it."

Yes, the darknets make it easier to find the ""bad"" listed right next to the ""good"" because of the absolute nonexistence of censorship, but that really isn't the point. These systems were built to make free speech and free reading possible, and free commerce is just a byproduct of that.  In any case, the network that /r/darknetplan is building is a closed-shell system with access granted by the people in the network. If someone is running an unacceptable service, the people connected to that service will remove it from the network, which makes the system self-censoring based on its culture, not on a centralized body of any kind."

My apologies if I missed a project that you're working on that addresses these issues but the ones that I have seen won't scale well, don't address routing over multiple hops or naming conventions, or anything of the sort.   Are you referring to ServalMesh?   Basically, they aren't really a dark net.   Read the sidebar, our goal is to organize a decentralized alternative to traditional ISP's. /r/darknet can help you with darknets.   Ok, so I think we need to make an application that adapts both the MANET address assignment in the Thoppian & Prakash paper, and the DSHT architecture from the coral CDN.   Hmm   Rather than a request flood each time a node is added or dropped the connected nodes will update their hash tables and distribute that update to other nodes so that they can update their hash tables normally.   What application that you tried does that?   Since the network will automatically form a series of concentric rings and organize it based on ping it will be easy to create route tables from those rings which will then be used to facilitate point to point relay messaging with a minimum necessary latency.   Sounds foolproof on paper, but I'm unsure how foolproof it'd be overall.   If anyone has any other ideas to make this better or could help with development please speak up!  I want to make a meshnet that could actually scale up enough to functionally replace the current internet backbone if needed, and the core needs to be a software app that runs on as many platforms as possible and is both resilient and functional.   Look at Cjdns, its what I and many others are using to build meshnets, theres a link to it on the sidebar. It works on Linux, *BSD (including Mac OS X), Illuminos, and many other platforms. We are also going to be having a funding campaign for OpenWRT support soon, with Windows support being our stretch goal."

darknetplan,1dmhae,danry25,2,Fri May 3 18:33:43 2013 UTC,"The issue is that if I understand what I've read correctly Cjdns requires an active IP address in order to work so you have to have a connection for the CJDNS connection TUN device to be able to communicate with other CJDNS instances.  What if (for example) you're trying to set up a network comprised entirely of mobile devices between friends at a concert where the cellular networks are overloaded and they would otherwise be unable to locate each other?  Unless I've misunderstood the implementations that I've seen CJDNS requires some existing network infrastructure, the goal here is to make that infrastructure unnecessary."

You mean Cjdns requires an IPv4 address? It used to to connect to other nodes, but about 6 months ago a group of Telecomix members built an Ethernet interface, and cjd then added a local autopeering feature for the interface.   What if (for example) you're trying to set up a network comprised entirely of mobile devices between friends at a concert where the cellular networks are overloaded and they would otherwise be unable to locate each other?   I'd spin up an ad-hoc wifi network named ""<friends name> CONNECT TO ME!!!!> using one of the many android apps that'll do that, and cjdns would autopeer with them. Then they could navigate to my cjdns IPv6 address, which is static, or if they didn't know it they could use cjdns-caramel (which is a nice gui frontend for cjdns) or cjdcmd to see who all they are connecting with. On another note, cjdns on Android needs proper packaging and power management still, but it does work.   Unless I've misunderstood the implementations that I've seen CJDNS requires some existing network infrastructure, the goal here is to make that infrastructure unnecessary.   Ah, it used to require some IPv4 network running below it, but thanks to some outside help from the great people that form Telecomix, cjdns now has an ethernet interface, and it even automatically peers with other cjdns instances that are on the same network segment. It was a pretty major change for cjdns in terms of ease of use, but it does make setting up a cjdns network drop dead simple."

darknetplan,1daphl,d9e003,9,Sun Apr 28 22:16:36 2013 UTC,I don't think GSM or CDMA is capable of point to point. Even at that they're still relatively low power output. The greater range comes from the 200' towers and sector arrays.
darknetplan,1daphl,tacticaltaco,4,Sun Apr 28 22:32:33 2013 UTC,"Is that so? Perhaps I foolishly assumed that since cell phones could communicate to the towers, that they could communicate to cell phones at equal distances over the same radio.

darknetplan,1daphl,tacticaltaco,3,Sun Apr 28 22:35:35 2013 UTC,"Line of Sight plays a big role in microwave links. With two nodes on the ground a mile apart they probably won't be able to hear each other. In a ""typical"" urban environment you might get 500' with 1 or 2 watts.  When you add tall towers (and good antennas) you can go a few miles (as is the case with cell phones).  Other than the regular RF limitations the cellular radios are extremely locked down software wise. We simply can't exercise control over them well enough to do a project like this."
darknetplan,1daphl,tacticaltaco,1 point,Sun Apr 28 22:43:56 2013 UTC,"for sake of curiosity, could you provide any proofs (equations + specs)? even if not, I accept your fermi calculations :)"
darknetplan,1daphl,tacticaltaco,3,Sun Apr 28 22:52:50 2013 UTC,My numbers come from...experience? Sure we'll call it that. Work around with stuff long enough and you get an idea of what is plausible.  If you want to run through the numbers yourself calculate a Link budget. There are calculators online that you can plug numbers in to and get the results. The tough variables to cover are always environmental (terrain/humidity). If you're really interested I can run through one.
darknetplan,1daphl,tacticaltaco,2,Sun Apr 28 23:03:04 2013 UTC,"actually, yes.  where do you find your specs, also?"
darknetplan,1daphl,pcvcolin,6,Sun Apr 28 23:05:14 2013 UTC,"Specs for individual phones aren't easy to come by so I'll have to find numbers that sound plausible. I'm going to error on the ""best case scenario"" side (usually you want to go the other way).   Going to pick the 900Mhz band since that will give us the best chance at NLOS propagation. For power levels I'm going to use stuff from here. (I'll pick the highest level, 36 dBm) For antenna gain I'm going to say 3 dBi. I think that's generous for a phone. For Rx sensitivity I'll go with -103 dBm. That's probably unrealistic (expect something more like -70 to -50 for good throughput). I have no source for this but check out the specs on data radios in the 900Mhz range and you'll get an idea. For cable losses I'm going to just say 0 dB. I'm going to assume phones are built well enough that there isn't much loss between the radio and the antenna. A more real number might be 0.5 dB   I used this calculator and got 1.5 miles. That's 1.5 miles not factoring in terrain (over open water, no obstructions). I don't have time to expand on how terrain will kill the range but it does. I might have time later."
darknetplan,1daphl,mewrei,3,Sun Apr 28 23:34:26 2013 UTC,"Worth while read! Now, wifi usually travels at a top range of about 150 feet, if i'm not mistaken; however, there is the significant advantage of it being 2.4GHz instead of 900 MHz, lending to a greater data transfer rate.  So, call me stupid, but even 0.5 miles from terrain beats 150 feet clear, right? Or, is there some other option like an ISM band that could make a wider distributed node mesh?"
darknetplan,1daphl,playaspec,2,Sun Apr 28 23:45:22 2013 UTC,You are correct on all points. You still can get decent data rates on lower bands.  You'll want the XR9 or the DL915 or the XC900M. They're not compatible with each other but they're in the 900Mhz ISM band and offer good throughput.  There are other options in the 440Mhz amatuer radio bands (XC420M or DL435) but there are a few of legal/ethical reasons against it (ARRL Band Plan says Amatuer TV; Encryption; Non-Ham traffic going over the air) but I still think it merrits a look.  All of these cards are a WiFi chip with a down/up converter so you can mock up your mesh using WiFi cards and then drop these in and try to do the real thing.  EDIT: I should also suggest that antennas make or break a system. You can do everything on ISM WiFi with good antennas and LOS. If you're using those cards you'll have way more than 3 dBi antennas and can go much much farther with the same power/terrain.
darknetplan,1daphl,danry25,3,Mon Apr 29 00:16:42 2013 UTC,"When I think of mesh on a phone I tend to think of Android and Serval. http://www.servalproject.org/ Which can be downloaded here: http://developer.servalproject.org/site/?page_id=644 Here is the github... https://github.com/servalproject/batphone (Documentation / manual)  http://developer.servalproject.org/site/?page_id=685 I also tend to think of / remember this page, oslrd.. http://www.olsr.org/ which also has a linkto an instructional on how to do put this onto an older Nokia phone... http://wiki.funkfeuer.at/index.php/OLSR_am_Nokia_N900  As I wander through my ""mesh net phone"" memory, I am kind of wondering if anyone has put up a wiki or a web site with a list of recommended phones that any person with no knowledge of mesh networking techniques could consider buying - phones that have the capability (whether it's their internal stuffs, battery power, whatever) to be capable of doing this mesh network thing.  Any input is welcome"
darknetplan,1daphl,tacticaltaco,3,Mon Apr 29 05:55:16 2013 UTC,"Ham here.  No encryption on the ham bands (or ANY form of obfuscation, even esoteric remarks, there can be no attempt to hide the true content of the conversation, the only exception is satellite command and control), and the VHF/UHF ranges (like 440) are LOS limited.  Strictly non-commercial traffic.  Relays for 3rd parties have a lot of rules behind them as well.  Plus you have to have a licensed ham at every transmission point, present at the time of transmission.  Go into the HF bands and bandwidth goes way down, way quick.  To answer your question about using GSM/CDMA for mesh, the answer is no.  You can't just create meshes by enabling radios to transmit and receive on the same spectrum, you don't have any sort of addressing protocol at that point.  If your answer is to repeat everything it receives as it receives it, you're effectively creating a half-duplex, single-connection link over an area of miles.  Imagine having to use a shared coax internet connection line with 50,000 other people.  In ham radio with repeaters, we usually have a carrier frequency that ""keys up"" the repeater, and we also manually observe the repeater to make sure its not in use.  Look at IEEE 802.11s to see an up and coming mesh networking protocol standard for the 802.11 suite.  But again, the GSM/CDMA bands are LOS limited as well.  He's right when he says that the 200' tall towers are one of the key success factors.  The other thing you're neglecting in your argument is antenna sensitivity.  Just because a cell tower can receive my milliwatt transmission from a mile away, doesn't mean that somebody's iPhone will be able to.  Plus all of that high-powered, multi-million dollar radio gear in cell towers has a lot of capabilities in the sensitivity and signals processing arena.  I direct you to this AMA by a T-Mobile spectrum engineer for some more insight http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/xvuwn/iama_rf_engineer_ama/  Ultimately the big issue is that your bands capable of delivering bandwidth worth a crap are LOS limited, with a few exceptions (bouncing it off the moon, other satellites, etc).  There's no real getting around the basic need for some variety of infrastructure, even if its people placing high-gain omnis on top of their houses.  Regarding ISM, keep in mind that the individual is a secondary user on the ISM band.  This means if you cause interference with your neighbor's wifi setup, the FCC is gunna have your ass.  And unfortunately, these bands are kinda snug.  Fortunately though, most home wireless routers crowd channel 6 on 2.4Ghz (2.437Ghz).  And you are absolutely right, the FCC, and most communications oversight orgs, in addition to the mobile carriers, will have your ass for screwing with their multi-billion dollar spectrums.  Read the T-Mobile engineer's AMA.  The spectrums are very delicate and carefully organized by people who do know wtf they're doing."
darknetplan,1daphl,r0wla,1 point,Mon Apr 29 05:51:04 2013 UTC,"Now, wifi usually travels at a top range of about 150 feet   For devices with an integrated antenna, yes. But it's possible to get many miles without exceeding legal power limits.   there is the significant advantage of it being 2.4GHz instead of 900 MHz   As with everything, it's a compromise. Giving up one thing to get another.   lending to a greater data transfer rate.   This isn't a function of the frequency used. It's due to the amount of bandwidth allocated by the FCC.   So, call me stupid, but even 0.5 miles from terrain beats 150 feet clear, right?   Certainly.   is there some other option like an ISM band that could make a wider distributed node mesh?   I don't think there is a one size fits all band or protocol. There are alternate wifi protocols emerging that provide better throughput on congested networks. Several commercial vendors implement a proprietary TDMA on Wifi protocol. Mikrotik's Nv2 and Ubiquiti's Airmax are both TDMA over wifi.  BSD's kernel has a fairly advanced TDMA implementation, but it's still under development. Linux has the beginning of such functionality, but it's not ready for prime time."

As for Samsung and Apple, you're now talking about a company throwing around billions in advertising to usurp Apple. I'm sure the next currency will have that kind of money to throw at advertising itself, sure.

Facebook is slipping, Twitter don't have a sustainable business model, Youtube will fall like a rock in water once (proper) streaming capabilities reach Torrents or similar, Word and Office will shrink with more capable online apps.  All things comes to an end. We will always iterate and improve upon the things we have made. It might take many years, but there is no doubt we adapt and exchange old technology for new and superior.   Justifying my point really if you can't pick fields that were clearly solely dominated by one product.   Then give us some of yours. I don't think you have any, or will be able to find one, that hasn't lost it's position and is now either gone or simply competing with everyone else. Unless it's really young of course.   Fiverr is a great example, as is kickstarter.   Fiverr is a niche market, nothing more. Kickstarter is loosing users left and right to other alternatives. (Mainly Indiegogo.) Both have several other competitors, and neither will be able to keep the thrown for long.   People aren't going to use more than one online digital currency.   I don't see any problem with using more than one currency - after all I do that with my physical money. For me this is really just when I'm out traveling, but I'm gonna take a guess and say there are people using more than one currency on a daily basis too.  In the same way, there isn't anything stopping people from using multiple currencies online. (It wouldn't be much different from someone using Mastercard and others using Visa.)   Lotus 123 existed in a time when personal computer tech wasn't even embedded fully.   So? It's still a first-mover tech in a relatively uncontested field (at the time of course). The fact that the market is fast growing has nothing to do with it. Isn't Bitcoin fast growing?   As for Samsung and Apple, you're now talking about a company throwing around billions in advertising to usurp Apple.   We aren't discussing advertising strategies here. Sure they are probably relevant, but it isn't the posters we are buying, it's the technology. The bad technology will die, no matter how much money is put into advertisement."

I suspect that will be adjusted in the software over time to account for usage patterns.   ...and does it get everyones messages around me (even if I'm not looking at them/subscribed)?   It appears so. How else could your message be relayed through other phones?   I just don't understand why someone would have to fly across the Ocean to get messages to Europe...   How else would the messages get there? The entire point of it is that it works directly from phone to phone, without using any infrastructure.    ...and then would they be blasted with my hundreds of messages I've received?   Yep. I'd hardly call it ""blasted"" though. The messages are restricted to 128 characters, and text compresses very well. Hundreds, or even thousands of messages would take up so little space as to be unnoticeable on a modern smart phone."

Will the messages be relevant anymore?   Thinking about this now, there should be an option before pushing a message to expire after a set date/time.   Could you imagine if this existed in Boston last week and then a month from now, someone who was in the area travels across the country and now we have wide spread panic because everyone is now hearing talks about an explosion going off? But no one knows where or when because the messages aren't geotagged or expired? Probably extreme thinking but I'm just trying to wrap my head around this full concept."

Everything is designed with freedom in mind, from Mozilla Persona login to Bitcoin support to ""buying things over the command line"" friendliness.  Aside from my own store, one of the things I'm really hoping to push as a use case is ""purchased free software."" I'm always looking for ways to make free software more financially viable, and I think a great way is to have a standard mechanism for ""paying"" for a distro if you feel like it. Software can add a directory in /opt/purchase containing their Niknak store information, which the ""purchase"" script can then detect when run. Purchasing software puts a cryptographic receipt in the appropriate directory, as well as any other digital goodies the author wishes to put in there. This makes it easy to fund your installed software piece-by-piece after you decide you like it, or all at once for your entire distro.  I've gotten as far as the permissions model.

If I am a music company or whatever and want to find out who shares my files, I just go online, download a song and then sue everybody who send me a piece. It doesn't matter that the people who send me a piece where just routers, forwarding encrypted packages and had no clue what was in them and not the original uploader, they are still guilty. Everybody who participates in the network is.  One of the ideas of a proper Darknet (the description in the sidebar is kind of wrong) is that you only connect to trusted parties in a network, not just to everybody. So you connect to your friend, they connect to theirs and so on. The music company would now no longer have a point of attack, as nobody trusts them and sends them packets.

Here, allow me to be more specific:   How, exactly, would they tell the difference between meshnet (that's what you're really talking about) transmissions and the massive amount of other WiFi traffic out there? Assume that the node operators are aware that the network is considered illegal, and so take common sense steps to ensure that they don't stand out unnecessarily. Please provide specifics. How do you expect them to successfully locate low-power point-to-point unidirectional links, which would be the primary type used in such a scenario? Remember that such links could be made to be well below the noise floor unless the receiver is within a very narrow beam, and thus effectively invisible to someone driving around below searching for it. Once again, please provide specifics.

Throwing that assumption out for your super-secret managed meshnet with authentication and authorization done by very subtle unicorn horn dust, lets look at this straight-forward wikipedia article, as one example of attack. I expect they could follow an omnidirectional link to it's sibling point to point link, and follow that chain as they go. How illegal is this? Do they want to make examples of 1% or suppress the whole thing? I agree 100% enforcement would be impossible, but you could use your imagination. Study this case if your imagination fails you.

The most obvious would be to not use automated discovery. As for frequency analysis, I'm not sure how you expect that to help you with proper, modern encryption. The very fact that you mention it, actually, demonstrates a severe level of ignorance on the subject. They could follow an omni-directional signal, which is why omni-directional transmitters would not be used (or at least found and shut down quickly, in cases of operator ignorance). That would be another of those obvious common sense steps that node operators would take, and why I specifically asked about low-power point-to-point unidirectional links.   As for your claim that I am ""unwelcome"", I am a significantly contributing member of Hyperboria (under a different name), providing both services and software that others use.

But there is nothing stopping me and my neighbor from running a power line between us, grounding both our homes properly, and sharing an internet connection, with the right networking equipment.  The other problem is that because the data runs at high frequency and the power runs at low frequency on the same wire, there is a short distance range for the data connection (the higher the frequency, the lower the range before repeaters are necessary to boost the signal) implying if many nodes were to be connected this way it has to be a mesh formation rather than a spoke formation like most isps use.  You could run darknet over that pretty easily barring the grounding issues because you control who connects.

My problem with his post is not that it's not possible to embed bitcoin into a darknet. It's this:   All because we used our tremendous hashing power far more wisely!  Difficulty could still be adjusted accordingly, but not to solve a math problem, instead to power the darknet mesh network.   So how would you do this? How does computational power help to build a darknet if computational power is not the bottleneck? How do you verifiy the authenticity of the work? Bandwidth-heavy stuff instead of cpu-heavy stuff? Maybe it is possible to do this in a cryptographic secure way (i can't think of any, but that doesn't mean it's not possible), but it would need at least a complete rewrite of Bitcoin. What would your system look like that  transports ""communication of the network"" as work and can't be cheated?   The cool thing about a P2P darknet is that it can be transported over networks that aren't the Internet. Loss of Internet infrastructure could potentially be bridged over ad hoc wifi networks, short wave, custom frequencies, or about any other means of communication you can think of.

Computational power is not a bottleneck, it is a challenge for the proof of work system that Bitcoin is. When computational power becomes easier due to better hardware and software the value of an amount of work slides to keep everything even. Kind of like adjusting for inflation. So, this computational difficulty isn't a bottleneck, it is a feature, to require work, which equates to value for the bitcoins. It is arguably wasted effort for the sake of wasting effort. Sure some is required to hash the transactions and such, but for bitcoin generation, it would be cool if that effort was instead of wasted effort, something that was more useful, such as verified packet relaying/routing. The point from the thread is that the sliding difficulty for this arbitrary wasted hashing effort could also translate to packet routing to help keep an even playing field and scale the network benefits."

The reason we're planning to use OT is it supports having multiple currencies (for example bitcoins can already be securely checked in to OT), it offers truly anonymous digital cryptocash you could store on a flash drive, and it uses receipt totaling to avoid the need for a bigass blockchain that you must permanently retain. To top it all off, it will likely even scale and process payments in a timely fashion, unlike how the bitcoin network has slowed down to a crawl in terms of payment processing if you aren't willing to pay a fee.  Did I mention its still fully cryptographically secure and decentralized like bitcoin? The only difference is that it follows the idea of a federated network of servers, with lightweight clients available on platforms that can't host a server, so that ideally each user will either run a server (which is pretty easy to do) or use a friends server if they don't have a device that is on most of the time."

Asymmetric cryptography (i. e. signatures) can verify if something came from someone special. But how do you verify this in a global aspect, there is no central instance.

Darknets use Public Key Cryptography to securely communicate a private key between 2 computers, without a lurker being able to decipher that key. That key is subsequently used to encrypt all traffic and decrypt on the other sides. There is little hashing effort required, as you only have to calculate a single key and encrypt with that. It takes way more power to actually break the ciphertext as a lurker (ISP), which could take thousands of years if not more using all currently available computer power.   A darknet doesn't use or isn't even compatible with a blockchain algorith like Bitcoin uses, there would be no sense to complicate communication between peers whereas the transfers themselves would be made public - that's exactly the opposite of what a darknet is about."

darknetplan,1cdqot,bepraaa,-1,Mon Apr 15 15:34:03 2013 UTC,Both hashing power and bandwidth will be constraints.  Both can be addressed by the Bitcoin miners.  Miners need large pipes into the network to mine at peak efficiency.  They would act as the servers on the network exploiting there current pipes they are using.

Seriously, if you're too incompetent or out of the loop to realize what a silly idea this is, let me break it down:   Your headline is intentionally, entirely, and shamelessly false, misleading, and sensational. The bitcoin network provides and requires GPU cycles, not transport. Most bitcoin nodes are powerful boxen with crappy backhaul. This means that they would make horrible transport routers. Assuming you could magic transport into the protocol out of thin bits, how are you going to solve the addressing issue? The only thing that makes bitcoin special is the blockchain. Currency needs it, transport doesn't. You are trying to put transport into a currency-shaped box and it's not going to work out at all. What would this look like anyway? You don't even have the beginnings of any ideas which lead us to believe that you have a clue to tell us how to implement and ship it. This was already invented and it's called hocnet. CJDNS is very similar to bitcoin in its decentralized nature and it already exists, works, and has a stable test network.   But don't take my word for it, head on over to #bitcoin on freenode and let them tear it apart for you. They know more about the problems you'll have than I do.

Do note that Tor & I2P are Overlay Networks and can only function as such, while CJDNS functions as both an overlay network, but primarily as a normal Layer 2 network. As to the comment that cjdns isn't an opennet, while that is true, I (and most anyone who runs cjdns) will happily peer with anyone who contacts us.

Back in the day, before freenet had an opennet, I used to run a site called Ubernode.org, which had a little script on it which could be used to facilitate an exchange with my node, without any user involvement.

They provide an effective way to bypass firewalls, or in the case of CJDNS, work without any central infrastructure at all. What they don't do is provide any system for posting, saving, or sharing messages.

Is there some automated mixer method for finding peers, or publically known cjdns nodes that I could automatically link to?   There are some public nodes on the wiki, but last I checked none of them worked. Cjdns setup has been scripted before, look for the youtube walkthroughs on how to set up cjdns, iirc /u/thefinn93 cleaned up the cjdns setup scripts a while back too.  Tat particular script will pull peers from a website (I forget the name of that site tho). You could probably run your own version of the server side automated peering script, if you do, I'll throw my peering details in too :)  I'll look it up for ya if you want, we could even modify the script to even set up autopeering over LANs so that local cjdns nodes peer automatically."

I'm no expert, and I haven't done this myself because I'm poor, but if you could package all those protocols into one download and have the right hardware drivers run on the OS then you have your mass produced router.  This place has gotten so boring since everyone moved to CJDNS.  I learned this here about a year ago, and might still have links once I'm near my old computer.    The problem we run into with these are places like where I live, when you have a few hundred people separated by 20-30 miles.  Even with an actual robot or drone that moves between these areas we would have to consider that coverage would likely be spotty as the drones move on with their course.  Not to mention airspace, especially in cities, and the network interrupting other communications.  I remember some people here setting up some really cool long distance routers using satellite tv dishes, but they were buggy, laggy, and kind of unreliable.  Again, I can probably dig up some instructions.  The best option was supposed to be connecting the cities and towns with CJDNS.  Just never had the time and money myself.  Maybe this summer...

darknetplan,1bzgfn,oelsen,3,Wed Apr 10 08:26:05 2013 UTC,"Antennas made for older WiFi standards will still work with newer ones, but in this case you wouldn't have MIMO support or any of the reliability and bandwidth that adds. I haven't seen any DIY antenna guides that take MIMO into account, but ideally you would set up a 2x2 arrangement using pairs of antennas with matched polarization."
darknetplan,1bzgfn,TheScriptKiddie,3,Wed Apr 10 08:31:57 2013 UTC,"I see your point and I know well it's hard to solve these kind of issues. On the other hand I was speaking of spreading Hyperboria and the darknet project by reaching people that would like to buy something nice and useful, by using the meshnet stack. Sure a router OS it's enough, or even a *nix opportunely configured to act as a router. An additional storage can be used, as I said, to implement a distributed file system where to host Hyperboria web application. When you connect to Hyperboria you feel like you are alone (IMHO), because it's still at a early stage. If we want a Free (as in freedom) internet, we need the infrastructure and contents, so that normal people and not only hackers (as knowledge masters) and activists can enjoy a Free Internet.  Concerning long distance connection for cheap, there is not much you can do. Most reliable systems are the cable ones (again IMHO), but cannot be used for long distance except investing a fortune. You can also use HF frequencies but the bandwidth is really low (roughly 12 Kbps, max known 24 Kbps).   VHF, EHF, SHF, ... are normally expensive to put in place.  I know of a project that built it's own HF transmitter and reached 9 Mbps http://yutok.wordpress.com/2007/09/19/broadband-internet-via-hf-radio/ . I'm not sure if you can transmit and receive at the same time.  Using wifi for long distance, except investing a lot, it's not a good idea either, in fact wifi has not been developed for long distances. Wimax is an option but still not cheap...  RTLSDR seems a good option, but do you have transmitters? Doesn't use the TV frequencies? Don't you have restrictions in your country using this spectrum?  I'd like to help you, but I don't see how..."
darknetplan,1bzgfn,They_call_me_Jesus,4,Wed Apr 10 07:03:00 2013 UTC,"Although I haven't actively followed the progress in any of these fields in some time now (college freshman wat wat) I know that the RTLSDR operates on TV frequencies, as that is what the original intent of those particular dongles is.  They actually won't work for TV in the United states and certain other countries, just because the target frequency isn't used in that way, it tells you that on the page that you buy from.  IIRC though they have free and open source software that can alter the frequency though, and that is the point, people can use these to pick up radio frequencies as well as things like air traffic controllers and the like.  I've seen a couple posts talking about packet radio over these, but you run into the same issues as any packet radio, namely bandwidth.    Same with the dish relays, the speeds just aren't something the common consumer would be willing to go back to.  Even so if we had a city wide meshnet, I wonder if we could channel inter city traffic into one or two of these relays, allowing for the various nets to communicate and essentially leading to a [two city wide] meshnet.  In actuality we could allow the city network to access the clearnet by routing through a few people that are connected to both (somehow), but that's just a thought.    If we look at any darknet (say TOR) we have to realize the fact that most people don't care enough to leave the main internet for something else even when presented with a sincere plug and play situation, and I don't even really feel that we have gained that.  I think a good start would be a single download that people can install on their disused hardware, with a walk through setup and relatively immediate results, much like TOR.  The pieces are there to get a network up and running, but I haven't come across a single rar or iso that makes things easy.  Maybe a kickstarter is in order, or maybe I'll just torrent it when it's available ;)  quick disclaimer: I'm a sleep deprived redditor, not a 1337 hacker."

darknetplan,1bzgfn,idolbreaker,1 point,Thu Apr 11 02:50:49 2013 UTC,"I've been thinking about this for a while. A helium filled blimp UAV could easy carry something small, like a pirate box, or run Plan 9. The problem of course is the battery life of the robot. They all suck. Even if you put your meshnet box on something cheap like an iCreate, it would have to recharge itself after 2 hours. I have thought of building one myself. I'm definitely going to take the UAV route, though. It's not hard to do, the problem is simply battery life. You could even put 2 wifi antennas on it so they drift towards each other until they have a strong enough signal to mesh."

darknetplan,1bzgfn,Cybercommie,1 point,Tue Apr 9 23:43:10 2013 UTC,And what about charging stations?
darknetplan,1bzgfn,oelsen,2,Tue Apr 9 13:47:15 2013 UTC,"Those are always a possibility and fairly simple, but the robot would spend more time on it's charging station than away. But, you can set up good locations for charging stations so the robots still mesh, then move the mesh around for events, like parades and flashmobs."
darknetplan,1bzgfn,rolypolyeatingdude,1 point,Tue Apr 9 13:53:18 2013 UTC,"Just a clarification. I like the idea of building an UAV, beside the battery life issue and (vandals) snipers armed with slingshots. But I was thinking more about a commodity that normal people will buy or build.  This way we can reach normal people and explain why they need an alternative network, just showing to them how good and ""free"" (as in freedom) it is."
darknetplan,1bzgfn,mitravelus,3,Tue Apr 9 14:01:07 2013 UTC,"How about a ""blimp node""? Throw a solar panel on top and use a phone as a 3g modem/ GPS module... We could make a remotely powered self sustained node that could travel wherever cellphone towers exist."
darknetplan,1bzgfn,Natanael_L,1 point,Tue Apr 9 21:09:20 2013 UTC,"I think the solar panel won't be enough. Except for Solar Impulse (the swiss made solar powered airplane) and some few extremelly expensive drones, I'm not aware of any cheap solar powered UAV.  I'm still convinced that we should create something useful and funny for indoor leasure, or with some unique utility (i.e. a Roomba meshnet powered node)"
darknetplan,1bvwou,Protagonistics,13,Mon Apr 8 00:40:35 2013 UTC,"That's an Ubiquiti 30db RocketDish, probably with a 5ghz rocket M.  I've seen these on towers do 30+ mile links.  That isn't a mesh, that's a PtMP link using something that's meant to be used for PtP backhaul links.  That dish is overkill for short range use.  The high gain omni looks good on paper but the higher the gain the narrower the vertical transmit beamwidth.  The majority of the signal energy is in a very narrow horizontal beam at antenna level and reflections off buildings are going to raise the noise levels.  If the blog entry isn't clear and that RocketDish is for backhaul then a pair of NanoStations would have done the job, maybe NanoBridges in a high noise environment.  If that's regular network cable and not outdoor rated it's probably going to fail in a few months."
darknetplan,1bvwou,modzer0,7,Mon Apr 8 03:29:54 2013 UTC,"Everything in your comment is spot on. No, it isn't a mesh in itself. And yes, it is overpowered for a short range link. But we have not yet settled on a final PtP connection location and we have a view of about 5 miles from that spot. We wanted to keep our options open. It IS the first backhaul node on our network. And we need to see the limits of the omni from its current location. Still, it works impressively. We are looking forward to setting up other nodes soon and getting our network design and firmwares in order. Any recommendations are appreciated."
darknetplan,1bvwou,modzer0,5,Mon Apr 8 05:16:29 2013 UTC,Do you have anyone who knows something about microwave link planning?  With the right tools you can figure out the needed transmit power and gain for a particular link.  It would save you money.  I know the RocketDish/Rocket M combos are not cheap.  I have two sets of them in my garage.  At 5 miles NanoBridges are still a bit overkill but a better choice to cut through any noise.  They're also a lot cheaper.
darknetplan,1bvwou,colindean,2,Mon Apr 8 13:09:08 2013 UTC,"We have a couple of folks, but we welcome input."
darknetplan,1bvwou,modzer0,3,Mon Apr 8 17:40:14 2013 UTC,"No offense, but if they really knew what they were doing they'd have never used such an expensive 30db RocketDisk/Rocket 5M combo when a NanoBridge would have worked at a third of the cost.  I'm going to make a guess that the Rocket 5M is probably transmitting at max power.  Has anyone taken the time to research the FCC rules about what frequencies to use and the power levels allowed on those channels?  If that Rocket 5M is transmitting more than 53dbm EIRP (transmit power + antenna gain) above 5725, above 30dbm EIRP down to 5250 and 23dbm EIRP below that you're violating FCC rules.  You may not care, but no one usually does until they get fined."
darknetplan,1bvwou,colindean,2,Wed Apr 10 17:44:22 2013 UTC,It was transmitting at max power until last night when someone realized that it was. It's been adjusted now.

It makes the platform a single point of failure. When Reddit is down, how do you Reddit?  If Reddit was instead an app each user hosted on their own box, and each message, post, and comment went out to the wide world of ""subscriber"" nodes, it would be like every person having their own mirror at all times, without any central entity being able to track and trace everyone's activity.

How is that ""unhosted""?  Isn't having a third party run your website on their servers, pretty much the definition of ""hosted""?  I hope I'm just missing something obvious here."
darknetplan,1bo2or,sindikat,10,Thu Apr 4 17:20:29 2013 UTC,"Not exactly. ""Unhosted"" is an umbrella term for many different ideas and initiatives, but the main engine behind it is the remoteStorage. Its idea is simple - your app is a serverless Javascript app in your browser, which you use the same web app as, say, Gmail, but the data is stored on an arbitrary server you choose (your own VPS or some data center's)."
darknetplan,1bo2or,fizzl,2,Thu Apr 4 19:46:48 2013 UTC,Damn that sounds stupid.
darknetplan,1bo2or,sindikat,1 point,Fri Apr 5 12:24:48 2013 UTC,Please explain.
darknetplan,1bo2or,fizzl,2,Fri Apr 5 16:58:39 2013 UTC,"There's, you know, these ""offline apps"". Like office suites to replace google docs. Outlook/Thunderbird to replace gmail.  It just sounds incredibly backwards, weird and pretty much impossible to try and wrestle control of the ""web apps"". And rightly so. There's really no reason anyone should be demanding online services to relinquish their power. You have a choice. Choice that does not entail some insane scheme trying to unbolt web apps from their hosts, from technologies they (""Unhosted"") have no clue about.  Sounds like a kickstarter scam at best."
darknetplan,1bo2or,kresoo,2,Fri Apr 5 18:09:19 2013 UTC,"Exactly this. People are acting like they've never heard of good old offline desktop apps. Why does everything have to be browser-based? Why waste bandwidth?  And before anyone says ""thin clients"" and I punch them in the face: if you expect control over your data, that means you can allow only a small portion of work to be done server-side. That means most of it has to be done client-side. Like with a desktop app."
darknetplan,1bo2or,SieurQuestion,1 point,Sat Apr 6 12:55:09 2013 UTC,"Access from anywhere? This is the only advantage. And I guess, you could say, partly ease of use.  You can access the data and the app itself from anywhere, hopefully, that would be your smartphone, your laptop, your pc, your mac, your work computer, your school pc, your firend's pcs, etc.  Currently, that data is held by the app's maker, but it is your data. So it would be nice to be able to use the app, but simply choose where the data is stored, could pick the app's server if you trust them, or could choose your own server, may it be a machine you actually run in your home, or a VPS.  With unhosted, you can also choose no server at all, in which case, it behaves like an offline app.  The idea is not so much that the app would be a web app, though it applies mostly to that scenario, but that the data can be stored locally, or, remotely, but you can choose where the remote location is."
darknetplan,1bo2or,Herover,6,Fri May 17 20:19:27 2013 UTC,"I feel as confused as you do, but after reading some other articles, I have a feeling that he is advocating webapps (as opposed to native apps for Android/iOS etc.) running on a personal server (like hosted on a VPS).  Sorta interesting read, but instead of the typical articles found in this subreddit, he advocates for a decentralized web where you host your own server instead of letting the big guys rule it all.   I think."
darknetplan,1bo2or,merreborn,3,Thu Apr 4 17:57:30 2013 UTC,"So, ultimately, p2p versions of major web apps, much like diaspora aimed to build a p2p facebook.  That's a pretty big engineering challenge.  Making something as easy to install as Wordpress requires a lot of engineering effort, and limits the selection of technology you can use.  People build centralized services like gmail or facebook or reddit because it's cost effective, not necessarily out of some sort of megalomaniacal desire for control or ownership."

darknetplan,1bjeqc,thatstevelord,11,Wed Apr 3 00:32:29 2013 UTC,The Bluesniff paper cites this which shows that the trickiest bits of bluetooth monitoring are done in software. The author turned a $30 dongle into a $1000 commercial sniffer through vendor-supplied software and firmware; all he needs is custom software to read the packets captured by the dongle.
darknetplan,1bjeqc,Rascal_Mouses,7,Wed Apr 3 02:28:51 2013 UTC,"Here's a link to the ubertooth one that I use for Bluetooth sniffing.  Michael Ossmann's working on a cheap-ish universal SDR, Harald Welte's working on a cheap-ish SDR and with the right upconverters you should be able to pick up bluetooth with a $15 DVB-T USB stick.  FHSS - Frequency Hopping is only effective as an anti-jamming mechanism. It is not an effective counter-sniffing mechanism."
darknetplan,1bjeqc,danry25,2,Wed Apr 3 07:55:12 2013 UTC,"On mobile, otherwise I'd post a link to the video I'm about to refer to, but Bluetooth actually isnt all that secure. There was a ""hacker/security conference"" where people came to talk about all their exploits and what not. The guy then asked the crowd to make their Bluetooth Undiscoverable (but not OFF) and even in Undiscoverable mode, it didnt help. He could still see and access many of the Bluetooth devices. Pretty I retesting video but its about 50 min long. I think it's by ""ruxcon"" of you look for them on YouTube. If I remember later, I'll post the video.  Link  I could be wrong about what the video is actually about. It's been a while since I watched it but after watching it my thoughts were that Bluetooth was not all that secure. In terms of using Bluetooth to aid a meshnet, well, I can't help you with that one."
darknetplan,1bjeqc,OmicronNine,1 point,Wed Apr 3 18:22:27 2013 UTC,"Yeah, although for useage in a meshnet you'd need to bond together a few bluetooth channels. The channel hopping properties of bluetooth are appealing though."
darknetplan,1bjeqc,OmicronNine,2,Tue Apr 2 21:18:05 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like Bluetooth technology is far overlooked in a project like this... there's barely anything mentioned about it as far as I can tell."
darknetplan,1bjeqc,danry25,4,Wed Apr 3 00:37:32 2013 UTC,Bluetooth range is measured in the tens of meters at most. It's practically useless for the kind of meshnets we're talking about.
darknetplan,1bjeqc,OmicronNine,1 point,Wed Apr 3 02:56:02 2013 UTC,"Maybe not as a solution for the entirety of the meshnet, but in cities where people are within such short distances from each other all the time... there would be no need for long range connections that use more power."
darknetplan,1bjeqc,danry25,1 point,Wed Apr 3 22:32:06 2013 UTC,"Bluetooth wouldn't even get from one building to another, possibly not even to another apartment in the same building, not even in a dense city.  And besides, it has no advantages over Wifi for this use anyway. What would be the point?"
darknetplan,1bjeqc,OmicronNine,1 point,Wed Apr 3 22:49:54 2013 UTC,"Well, in comparison to technologies like WiFi direct, it is more abundant.  Almost every device is equipped with BT. More people will be able to use the product from the start without needing new hardware.  I'm new to r/darknetplan, so I'm not quite familiar with the technologies already intended to be used for this project.  All I know is that  on BT you can be linked to and be making use of multiple connections at once."
darknetplan,1bjeqc,danry25,3,Fri Apr 5 18:22:15 2013 UTC,"Well, bluetooth is primarily overlooked for building meshnets to move large quantities of data because bluetooth sacrafices range and speed so that it uses little power. When you try to use 238kbps or so to feed a few users mesh access, your going to have a bad time if any of them attempt to load anything beyond text.  That being said, bluetooth seems to be able to hide itself well, which should throw off officials who are looking to shut down a mesh."

But remember, signing a petition is a trivially small amount of your day - you can easily sign it, and then do other stuff.

darknetplan,1awn49,thefinn93,7,Sun Mar 24 18:01:27 2013 UTC,"One of the original intents of the first version of the Commotion project's embedded firmware, when I started writing it and before Commotion was even really a project, was to maintain backwards compatibility with the ROBIN mesh software. ROBIN uses (at the time ostensibly vacant) public IP space, and we inherited some of our default settings from them. I believe the intent was likely to avoid upstream addressing conflicts when you plugged a mesh node into a home router using a private network space. This is clearly no longer tenable, if it ever was, and since maintaining compatibility with ROBIN is no longer a focus of the project, we've been looking at a few different options of how to change it. Changing to all-IPv6 would likely be the most long-term solution, but we've had insufficient time to test all components on all supported devices to make sure everything works with IPv6. There are a couple of other possibilities as well that we're working on. A new set of defaults will likely make it into the nightlies within the next few weeks, and the current 'ROBIN compatibility' defaults will be relegated to an optional configuration profile."
darknetplan,1awn49,jheretic,3,Mon Mar 25 14:28:02 2013 UTC,"So what you're saying is that you do still use public address space, but you've worked out that that's a bad idea now and you're working on it?"

I've been trying to get a single 6 mile link going, but have run into an obstruction. Going to have to deploy an intermediate node, but haven't found a host for it yet.

Long links can be quite fun, although you need good LoS to really get them working right :)  Distro wise there is a ton to do, and just having a turnkey distro isn't sufficent, theres a bit of hardware that every node needs to have to get set up. There also still is a lot of software development that needs to happen for local meshnets too, but that is coming along at a faster clip than most other things.  Have you tried out cjdns ethif autopeering yet? It scales well, even when we induce significant latency and packetloss throught the network.

He does have forward plans to support other mesh protocols though.

By the very nature of WPA, just saving what you set the password to isn't enough to decrypt wpa encrypted packets, since you need a copy of the shared secret between each and every client and the access point if you wish to decrypt the packets again.   But I digress, back on topic, the FCC regs could use updates.   I've been looking at TDMA +802.11. Ubiquiti's AirMax is TDMA, and it looks like there's now some functional linux kernel and user space utilities for TDMA support. It supposedly really helps streaming protocols handle real time transport.   Yeah, TDMA can be a big help in some situations, but its a pretty mixed bag overall. The main issue that TDMA is supposed to work around is the hidden node issue in PtMP setups, and for that it does a good job, WA Freenet over in Australia has some good TDMA scripts that they use to fix the hidden node issue, /u/samburney could prolly chime in more about that though.  As for streaming, TDMA won't do much for it usually unless your running into hidden node issues, since CSMA/CA still operates below it, which stops you from transmitting if anyone else is, thus limiting your bandwidth in High RF areas."

darknetplan,1akfa0,joshthelegodude,6,Wed Mar 20 03:15:56 2013 UTC,"Hi Danny, I had the priviledge of getting a tour of AMI a while back - what a neat place! I hope all is well.  I haven't been actively involved in /r/darknetplan accept to read some of the posts, but I can tell you that the sidebar on the right side of the screen has all of the relevant information. It seems like the main piece of software is a modified IP stack called CJDNS. It can work as a transport layer on top of (or maybe along side of? not sure) anything that 'speaks' IP and has complete end-to-end SSL baked in.  It uses (maybe abuses?) the IPv6 addressing scheme to allow for decentralized routing and naming. Nodes have to cryptographically sign each of their links to create transport links. The last time I ran the software consistently, latency was in the 4-5 second range but overall bandwidth was not bad, good enough for basic HTTP/S work. There was at the time a serious lack of any sort of DNS system (despite the name) but the author claimed to have a plan in place for that. As a result, all naming was done by passing around hosts files or the like.  It actually felt very much like the internet of the early 80's as you described it in this linked video. Everyone hangs out in an IRC channel and you're encouraged to link only to people you know in real life if possible.  EDIT: I should add that the CJDNS software itself - at least when I was last using it about a year ago - was not itself a mesh network but rather a routing protocol that was well-suited for a mesh network. Nodes could be linked via HAM networks or directly laid line but in practice were just routed over normal internet lines, with SSL providing the (theoretical) abstraction and security."
darknetplan,1akfa0,HorrendousRex,2,Wed Mar 20 00:02:36 2013 UTC,"Latency inside cjdns is generally comperable to that of the normal IPv4 internet if your properly peered, if it takes 10ms to go from computer A to Computer B in the current Internet, it'll take an equal amount of time over a cjdns connection.  SSL is generally unnecesary, since cjdns encrypts everything with a few layers of Salsa20 to give you better than SSL level security, while still being speedy & low latency. DNS in cjdns is not likely to happen, although DJDNS from /u/Rainfly_x is coming along quite nicely, it should have a somewhat working demo by April from what I hear.  On the note of how to peer with other nodes via cjdns, there are multiple options you can use that are now baked in. You can autopeer with others on your local lan via the ethernet interface, which generates ethernet frames and sends the to the appropriate client using switch labels. Alternatively, you can peer over any IPv4 or IPv6 network using the UDP interface, and this is how a good chunk of hyperboria is connected.  Since you were last on Hyperboria a number of things have likely changed, sites like Socialno.de, Uppit.us, Hyperboria.name an others have sprung up, offering services on the network. Come check it out when ya get a chance, and pm me if you need a peer, cause I'm always down to peer :)"

Or maybe you just had a shit connection. I rarely get over 1000ms latency, and when I do it's usually something on my end.  as for the DNS that's a whole nuther issue. CJD along with several others have put forward suggestions, and there's a lot of discussion going on. Right now we use ICANN DNS pointing to CJDNS IPs"

darknetplan,1aj112,heavymetalengineer,6,Mon Mar 18 15:33:19 2013 UTC,Not a fan of batman or robin. Why not use 802.11s or OLSR?
darknetplan,1aj112,eviltwinkie,3,Mon Mar 18 17:28:38 2013 UTC,From my understanding batman is supposed to be an improvement upon OSLR. I haven't really looked into 802.11s. What reason would you give for using them over BATMAN?
darknetplan,1aj112,eviltwinkie,2,Mon Mar 18 20:33:22 2013 UTC,OSLR with extensions is far superior for L3 routing. 802.11s is the IEEE standard for doing L2 mesh networks and is designed with mobile applications in mind.
darknetplan,1aj112,eviltwinkie,3,Mon Mar 18 20:35:37 2013 UTC,"Being completely honest I didn't look into OSLR too much and I had not heard of 802.11s before. May have to look into them now but I think I'm too far down the BATMAN path to change - would be worth writing up though, especially if anyone asks me why I chose BATMAN over 802.11s again."
darknetplan,1aj112,PubliusPontifex,3,Mon Mar 18 20:50:06 2013 UTC,"Yeah, I don't understand why anyone is wasting any more time on something that the IEEE has already sorta chimed in on.   I've created mesh products which are deployed in the field and I can tell you from practical experience...the products which do L3 mesh routing ALL suck compared to a L2 solution. Additionally, the products which use BATMAN and ROBIN fail pretty miserably when it comes to keeping sessions as the mesh moves around.  802.11s is definitely the way to go...shame so many vendors keep pushing these older crappy solutions in the linux world primarily because they have products invested which use that older crappy tech."
darknetplan,1aj112,eviltwinkie,3,Mon Mar 18 20:54:32 2013 UTC,"Sadly, have delivered consumer products in the millions which do mesh routing, and 802.11s is the future. We used a prop stack over l2, but I wouldn't be surprised to see a decent l3 solution in the near future. Everything is tcp/ip now, doing frame level doesn't seem necessary in the long run (and just adds that more complexity to media independence)."
darknetplan,1aj112,PubliusPontifex,3,Mon Mar 18 21:34:39 2013 UTC,"""Sadly"" is right...I feel the same."
darknetplan,1aj112,Bzzt,2,Mon Mar 18 21:37:35 2013 UTC,"IEEE can't make a standard without either over or under-engineering it (ieee 802.11b is a great case where they did both). They've gotten better (case in point wifi works now, but that's as much vendor work as it is their compliance testing), so maybe 802.11s will be a winner. The hacked STP we used was ugly in every way, with the only redeeming feature being it actually worked back in 2006 (... for arguments sake).  I'd still prefer a clean L3 solution, because I want it to work stably across vendors, and preferably across transports, but getting 2 vendors to interop cleanly can be a fight with 802.11g, can't imagine how fun things get when routing enters the equation."
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,5,Mon Mar 18 21:47:56 2013 UTC,"If this is really an intro to BATMAN then you might want to explain what it is and what it is for.  Also what devices can use it and how they can use it.  Do you need Linux?  What about android?  Can it bridge to the internet?  Can you run a website over BATMAN?  How ready for prime time is it?  Can you enable and disable it with network manager?  Why should people care about BATMAN?  Good info here - just that it sort of reads like the first part of the article is missing, the part that gives you an overview of the motivation and use.  Having information about the niceties of routing in BATMAN is good, but maybe that should be paragraph 5 and not paragraph 1."
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,2,Mon Mar 18 18:41:13 2013 UTC,"Most definitely. I unfortunately lacked the perspective to look at it that way however will certainly try do a ""prequel"" to this post to give a bit more depth and background"
darknetplan,1aj112,PubliusPontifex,2,Mon Mar 18 20:20:19 2013 UTC,Why BATMAN?
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,2,Mon Mar 18 18:57:05 2013 UTC,I am not entirely sure. I have not compared it to many other protocols however one other protocol I may have a look at if I have time is babel.  The kernel implementation of BATMAN apparently makes it less processor intensive which is important since I am intending it to be used on small low power devices such as mobile phones and raspberry pis.  From other comments about it it seems to be perfect for my use which is uncoordinated set up with nodes joining and moving and leaving all the time. I am not sure about the scalability of it however it should suit my needs which is <100 nodes.
darknetplan,1aj112,PubliusPontifex,3,Mon Mar 18 20:31:31 2013 UTC,"Huh. I dislike both BATMAN and babel because they make no attempt to secure your data has it passes around the mesh, which is generally full of unscrupulous people like me who dig through all your shit."
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,3,Mon Mar 18 20:33:30 2013 UTC,... This looks like a job for! TLS!
darknetplan,1aj112,PubliusPontifex,2,Mon Mar 18 21:35:26 2013 UTC,Yes but then everyone has to put TLS on their apps and I can assure you that not everyone does that.
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,3,Mon Mar 18 21:38:06 2013 UTC,"You don't put TLS on your app if you're stupid and don't care. Nobody with sense trusts the transport/physical layer to give any security, how is this worse than ethernet/vlans?  I assume everything that goes out the port is already compromised, it's just safer."
darknetplan,1aj112,PubliusPontifex,1 point,Mon Mar 18 21:41:33 2013 UTC,You don't put TLS on your app if you're stupid and don't care.   Yes but people also don't put TLS on their app if they're lazy/don't know how/don't consider it importan/don't implement it correctly
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,2,Mon Mar 18 21:45:33 2013 UTC,"Again, that's changing, because most apps are going http transport, and many http stacks now allow https without too much trouble (MitM auth notwithstanding)."
darknetplan,1aj112,thefinn93,1 point,Mon Mar 18 22:07:45 2013 UTC,"Except people think that no one gives out free certificates and they'd rather not pay and have it be clear text. I'd much rather have end-to-end encryption for everything, not just the things that support it."
darknetplan,1aj112,JesterInChaosCourts,3,Mon Mar 18 22:08:55 2013 UTC,"What you said is impossible.  In the end you either have authoritative certs for the endpoints, or you are defacto vulnerable to MitM, there is no way to authenticate without a sharable secret ala Diffie-Hellman.  Encryption is meaningless if it is not authenticated, simply because I can say I'm the guy you're talking to, use my key, and the whole system is compromised.  I hate the CA's as much as anybody, so let's make a ""free"" CA chain, not destroy the whole system."
darknetplan,1aj112,JesterInChaosCourts,2,Tue Mar 19 00:05:59 2013 UTC,But BATMAN allows you to encrypt your packets however you like at level 3 and then routes them at level 2?   Perhaps I am completely missing the mark.

If it starts to feel spammy, we can always back down to Door #2, but this is a really interesting topic/project that I think a lot of people here would be interested in.  While we all love CJDNS, it's really only a great technology for ""stationary networks"", where link information changes slowly over time. While we may be able to improve this over time, BATMAN was designed for fast updating of link information, which makes it the perfect routing layer to use on a project like yours. It'll also hopefully push a bit more motivation into development of network-bridging projects - automated means to use CJDNS as glue between self-contained meshes, such as your robo-BATMAN mesh."

Although I seriously doubt anyone would notice it unless they're looking for it - it'd be visible (audible?) slightly further since it's just a crude carrier/no carrier but it would require someone sitting around listening for morse code on an extremely noisy and usually all-data band.  Broadcasting and SSID would probably be a better bet since it's something people might actually be looking for and they could see ""There's a signal, we just don't know what until we're closer"" at the same range as morse code."
darknetplan,1aee78,electricheat,5,Sat Mar 16 18:36:09 2013 UTC,"The wifi card won't be of much help.  2.4ghz is line of sight, so if you can't see them, they'll never hear you.

darknetplan,1aee78,SuperConductiveRabbi,5,Tue Apr 9 21:41:13 2013 UTC,"Power and frequency will mostly determine how far you can transmit. WiFi is not that great for Morse.   Most WiFi cards that I'm aware of transmit at 100mW. You can add amplifiers and directional antennas if your setup allows for these connections, however due to the frequency you're not going to get much beyond line of sight (roughly 12 miles at sea level). You could mount the antenna on a tower or hilltop to help with the range, but you get the idea. If you plan on just broadcasting (not associating with another WiFi device), someone could conceivably hear you in monitor mode further out, but there would be a lot of dropped packets."
