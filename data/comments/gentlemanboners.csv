I mean you posted two from it https://www.reddit.com/user/jackwhite6 and /u/Gaun posted the rest  https://www.reddit.com/r/gentlemanboners/comments/3e1yo9/alexandra_daddario/ .. https://www.reddit.com/r/gentlemanboners/comments/3e1yk3/alexandra_daddario/
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,yorkton,4,Tue Jul 21 13:02:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not a bad set. And uh, tits."
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,Allowiscous,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:01:23 2015 UTC,I recently finished season 1 of true detective and now when i see her all i can think about are how nice her boobs and butt are.
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,GTAdriver1988,-2,Tue Jul 21 23:46:55 2015 UTC,Can someone explain her popularity to me and why there are 4 shots of the same thing on the front page? Is it the tits? The vacant expression? Her PR team is working overtime this morning.
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,flakemasterflake,11,Tue Jul 21 16:43:16 2015 UTC,I can't speak for anyone else but I personally think she's hot as hell. She looks better without all the airbrushing
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,dacameron,2,Tue Jul 21 16:49:57 2015 UTC,It's the tits
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,Matter94,3,Tue Jul 21 21:08:00 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any from this shoot before today, so it's either new, or was forgotten and people are posting single shots to try and get karma.   As for her popularity, it's because she is really hot, and for some she is extremely hot (I'm in the latter group). The reason why she is hot varies depending on taste, but she definitely isn't ugly."
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,tempest_87,3,Tue Jul 21 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"I just think she's absolutely beautiful.  Her face, her eyes, her body, all of it.  She's seems pretty cool in the few things I've seen her in also.  Honestly I never get tired of seeing her.  Beauty is suggestive tho, so maybe she isn't your thing."
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,oxideseven,4,Tue Jul 21 17:29:10 2015 UTC,I saw her boobs in True Detective. I suppose that's enough to make you famous. Haven't seen her in anything else.
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,flakemasterflake,3,Tue Jul 21 17:50:34 2015 UTC,She's been in a bunch of shows usually for an episode or so. New Girl comes to mind as something somewhat recent.  She was famous before True Detective but her glorious boobs sure helped get her noticed more I'm sure.
gentlemanboners,3e1z9r,oxideseven,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:11:11 2015 UTC,I mean for me normally it's the eyes... In this one I have no idea.

She's an entitled little member of the gentry who throws olives at restaurant passerby.  Also, someone is not a powerful feminist worthy of UN recognition just because they earned gazillions continuously portraying a female teenage wizard second banana to a dorky male lead, oh and she barely even has onscreen conversations with other females about anything other than male characters.

gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,yasserkhan1,-12,Mon Jul 20 00:18:57 2015 UTC,"IMO, I think it's gonna stomp on the Marvel stuff so far. A lot of it has been entirely underwhelming, save for Winter Soldier   Edit: Cheers Marvel fanboys for downvoting me, shows how immature some of them are, hence why they won't like DC stuff. I didn't even say it was bad, I said it was underwhelming, shit me for having an opinion right?"
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,Chewyone,37,Sun Jul 19 20:46:06 2015 UTC,What?  Are you kidding me?  Marvel's been KILLING it with their movies man.
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,mwagner26,38,Sun Jul 19 20:49:25 2015 UTC,"There are lots of good ones, don't get me wrong. But i think people (myself) are getting really burnt out on the same story formula, weak villains, and uneven writing that comes with 80% of Marvel's movies."
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,Tehsoupman12,11,Sun Jul 19 20:52:01 2015 UTC,"Fair point.  I thought a whole ton of their movies have been awesome.  The only ones I didn't like were Thor 2: The Thorining, and Iron Man 2.  But I do think the weak villains is a fair enough critique."
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,mwagner26,4,Sun Jul 19 20:56:48 2015 UTC,Iron Man 2 is the one you didn't like? For me IM3 is Marvels weakest film. Winter soldier being their strongest. But I think they're getting better at the whole weak villain thing. But it's going to be interesting to see the Marvel and DC competing. DC are trying so hard.
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,RyanLionel01,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:42:23 2015 UTC,im3 was my favorite of the franchise.

gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,CharlestonChewbacca,2,Mon Jul 20 01:11:22 2015 UTC,you pretty much are describing Marvel comics from the 1960s-80s. That's just how it was.
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,letdown105,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:16:15 2015 UTC,And ALL DC comics across all generations...
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,lilrabbitfoofoo,4,Mon Jul 20 07:11:29 2015 UTC,"Guardians was great, and the first avengers was great, winter soldier was amazing, but some of the other ones fall short. I was not a fan of ultron because in the comics and the animated movies he actually felt like a real threat. He felt unstoppable. Not so much in live action. Weak villains and lack of depth within the film are marvels weakest points at the moment, despite them being good movies. With DC there's much more depth, and the villains feel better (although that's true even in comics: see batman for the greatest list of villains ever). Sure, man of steel had some directional issues and couldn't decide between being a Nolan or Snyder film, but bvs seems to solidify snyder's style, and suicide squad seems to have a totally different style. I like that about DC, but then again I prefer DC comics so i may be biased."
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,bonage045,3,Mon Jul 20 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"It's hard to think of a villain in the Marvel series which is actually terrifying recently. Loki was good, as was Obadiah in Iron Man. Ultron basically killed no-one and had no on screen power in my opinion. At least Loki made you dislike him because he killed Coulson. DC's greatest strength now is that they can make adult 18 movies which have more aggressive villains with more impact. For example, Man of Steel had far more damage in the film than most Marvel films to date. Marvel films need to have that Daredevil factor of action and a great villain.  PS: Oh and I forgot Guardians of the Galaxy, that was a great film. Yet to see Ant-Man yet though."

gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,Chewyone,5,Mon Jul 20 10:33:06 2015 UTC,Seriously I agree. The other day I read an article about how underdeveloped Marvel's villians are and I completely agreed. Their best villain is kingpin from the daredevil series because they took the time to give his character a reason to sympathize with him.  Also I like the darker approach DC is taking.
gentlemanboners,3dtuxp,Bananaguacamole,2,Sun Jul 19 21:52:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, this is exactly the main thing Marvel films are lacking; depth."

I don't find Johansson's face attractive in the least, even with plenty of makeup. Portman's face is one of the best, imo, and a great face is way more important than bigger ass and tits, especially since Portman's body is great the way it is. And if you look at both of them without makeup, Portman still looks real good while Johansson looks even worse. And even w/bigger t&a, there's something off about Johansson's body...maybe a lack of curves like no small waist or big hips. Her body doesn't have the shape of, say, a Sofia Vergara...a body shape where the bigger t&a really look good."

Her actual name is Markéta Štroblová, which would make the pronounciation [Mahrkeetah Schtroblovaah] And the ee in her first name is pronounced as a longer 'e' in 'help' (I can't think of an english word that uses that sort of a long e sound), not as in 'peel', for example.

Towards the end of Season 1 watch Captain America: Winter Soldier to get an idea of what was going on, but it's not really necessary, just helps fill in holes.  Then just watch through Season 2 and you can watch Age of Ultron, but that doesn't really change anything for AoS - at least not until the end of the season.  You'll know which episode you need to follow up with Age of Ultron."

That's the central storyline and how the show works throughout the seasons.  Greendale is a place that destroys then rebuild horible people into something better.  But it is a matter of taste. Community ends up a lot like srubs in their kind of escapades humor and with a format similar to parks and recs. If you liked either of those shows, then give it another shot.  Also, Alison Brie and Gillian Jacobs have fan service scenes further along, which should be relevant to your tastes seeing which subreddit we are on."

The redhead from american pie who's name I should remember is pretty.  This one's bothering me.  But that one actress from like the 40's 50's 60's era who was skinny and had black hair was very pretty.  Please give me a name on this one.  If we can get the name of this woman she's definitely my top answer.   Found it Audrey Hepburn.  One of the most beautiful women ever.  And I'm going to throw out my weird one here last that no one will agree with just to give you guys a bone to pick at me.  Kristen Schaal is hot in such a weird way.  I don't know what it is about her.  There's a lot more but I feel like I'm taking too long to remember them cause I hardly ever think about celebrities, and these women in the OP aren't undatably unattractive, but I'd kind of sort of put them in the Kristen Schaal category of hotness to wear even though I find her attractive I'd be really surprised if most people agreed with me."
