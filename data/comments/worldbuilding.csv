The Instrument immediately crowned Fatima the Sultanah of the newly established Maridic Empire, while formally abolishing the Republican constitution which Fatima's coup d'etat had suspended 24 years prior.  The Instrument provided for the foundation of the Empire as a co-operative regime in which the population would be divided into sectors representing different classes and groups within society, all of which would be guaranteed representation in the central government. It also provided these sectors with the power to make policy among themselves, except in certain matters reserved to the State or where the sectors can not reach a decision.  Simultaneously, the Instrument formalized the post-Depression social contract which had become to characterize Fatima's Emergency Regime. The population was divided into subjects and citizens. Citizens, the elite who received their title through state service, held political power. In exchange for abdicating democracy, the subjects received Constitutional guarantees of a minimal standard of living -- healthcare, housing, education, and employment are considered human rights in the Empire. There is an emphasis on negative freedoms throughout the document.  The Instrument also settled a number of social issues, generally in favour of social cohesion. A good example is the Instrument's treatment of Islam, Marid's majority religion. While religious freedom is set out as a human right and the ulema are explicitly forbidden from enforcing religious law, the second Article declares that ""the source of all law is the compassion of the shari'a"". Similarly, the Instrument affords individuals freedom of speech, but explicitly allows the government to curtail that speech in the name of ""peace and public order"".  Foreign governments also took note of the Instrument because it settled Marid's status in a number of international disputes. The Instrument recognized the independence of the newly-created Republic of Samara, marking Praxo-Samaric victory in that dispute. However, the Instrument was silent on the Ghraibund Caliphate, a state still not recognized by the Imperial government. To this day, the Empire maintains that the Graibund provinces are in rebellion against New Banha's legitimate authority.  Alien groups were disappointed by the Instrument because of its language. Everywhere in the document, the language is restricted to humans only, leaving the status of non-human sapients somewhat ambiguous. So far, the central government has interpreted the Instrument in accordance with the idea that aliens are ""legal humans"", but this view is not shared by some of the Duneflower provincial governments. In those parts of the country, anti-alien discrimination has reached fever pitch."
worldbuilding,3e2mbb,Grine_,2,Tue Jul 21 15:12:04 2015 UTC,"The 1027 Act of the Dissolution of Union Bonds by Arawn Ralina Tarakhal of Cadhala is pretty much the most important Act in (pre-Faenwar) Cadhala. In this Act, Ralina Tarakhal outlines why she cannot in good conscience remain part of the Rufaen Union (taking particular pains to underline the Voice of the People's lack of mandate, as there has been no election in 100 years). She delivers a radical platform of constitutional and democratic reform in Cadhala, reduces the power of her own monarchy, and expands the electorate and citizenship of Cadhala to basically include everyone born there (effectively ending slavery, too, since citizens can't be slaves).  She sets out specific timescales for re-elections to the Cadhalan Witchmoot (Parliament), reforms inheritance laws to be less sexist (to allow her firstborn child, Refan Tarakhal, to inherit the throne instead of his sister, who would have made a terrible Arawn, but this had repercussions throughout all of Cadhalan society).   Then, because of this, the Rufaen Union (imagine a country like China, but much more effectively administrated) declares war on Cadhala. It's okay though because in addition to Cadhala, Ralina Tarakhal sowed seeds of rebellion in the districts of Fenryl, Attatur and Edylla, too. Edylla eventually merged with Cadhala to form the Greater Cadhalan Commonwealth, whilst Fenryl and Attatur revived the Blood-stained Friendship (an alliance sealed centuries ago during a vicious and brutal war against the Caraenic Empire, which was forced to move east after the Rufaen Invasion of Carenion).  This one document is probably the cause for significant social, political and any other kind of change you can think of in western Carenion. Even the Rufaen states which didn't revolt and secede got involved."

Both Leagues gathered the majority of Grevian city-states against each other in a trade war that was the culmination of 150 years of competition for hegemony in the Gulf region following the fall of the Cardish World-Clan.  The Gongawan League was led by the city of Gongawa and included the major cities of Dagon, Poton, Ocon, Ikidas, and Gelsoi (as well as all the cities of the Heart Waters and the Gate Waters).  The Western League was led by the city of Ictoi and included the major cities of Sostos, Bidika, and Sorida (as well as the all the cities of the Red Coast, the Dolphin Waters, and the Breast Waters).  Major Eastern cities such as Edikis, Mondin, or Otokon remained neutral, with Edikis supplying the Gongawan League with Cardish mercenaries at a decisive battle late in the war. The majority of Grevian settlements in Cardish Waters, Dagon's Waters, and the Foam Gulf were neutral as well.  The Treaty proposed as a condition upon the defeated that they join in a common political organization, modeled after the Gongawan League's own organization - The Archon Council. The Council, constituting 6 seats occupied by Archons from cities across the united cities, governed all aspects of state. Ictoi was guaranteed a seat, the only defeated power to be granted that privilege in the Treaty. In the year following the proclamation of Grevian unity, many of the neutral cities ratified the Treaty, and amendments were made to it guaranteeing sovereign rights of the cities, delineating the method by which Council members would be chosen in the future, defining their specific powers, and establishing borders within the body. In a manner of speaking, the Treaty extended temporally beyond the conclusion of the war, and became a document by which signatory cities could become part of the collective political organization.  Some decades later, another document known as ""The Primacy of Eyesat"" (""The Primacy of Meiest"") was ratified establishing the Cult of Meiest as the only legitimate worship by Grevians within the borders of the realm - banning devotion to the old pantheon of gods, to foreign gods, or to local gods. It also established one of the Council members as the official head of the Cult, intertwining what we would call ""state and church.""  The Primacy applied to all ratifying members of the original Treaty proclaiming Grevian unity - the Archon Sacrificiant, newly head of the state religion, proclaimed the treaty as ""the pillar upon which we stand,"" hearkening to Meiestine religious symbolism connected to the goddess's life."

In the name of Tol, may he guide us. As it is good and proper to set down in writing the points and prescriptions to be respected, the associated merchants of the city of Beraden, in the year 1189, assembled in the Merchants Hall in Beraden on the fifteenth day of Aergas, have decided, for the benefit of the associated merchants, to have and keep jointly a book in which shall be entered all the ordinances and regulations to be established and enacted, as well as the customs and usages that are to be observed.   Firstly, it is to be known that the above-mentioned community of merchants is divided into three groups as follows: those of Beraden, the northern towns, the city of Deltois and whatever is between those points along the Tenebrian coast. Furthermore, each year eight days after the coming of spring, two Elders are to be elected in each county among those listed. He who is elected must accept the office or pay a pound of crowns into the coffers of the said merchants, with the risk of being elected a second time and incurring the same fine. Furthermore, if one of the Elders left Beraden, the others must elect another, and he must accept under penalty of the said fine. Furthermore, the Elders shall have the power to assemble the community on the date they decide and at the place where they are, under penalty of a fine of three crowns. Should an important matter so require, the Elders may summons to appear whomsoever they wish and inflict a fine as heavy as they wish. Should it happen that an Elder fails to present himself, he is liable to a double fine. If the Elders cannot agree among themselves, the minority must follow the majority. Similarly, if two thirds are in agreeance, the third third must accept the decision of the other two. If a matter concerns the whole of the community, whether within the gates of Beraden or outside, it is the wisest and most competent of the Elders who must be its spokesman. If the matter concerns one city more than the others, the Elders of the city in question must be the spokesmen. The Elders, on the very day of their election, must choose six assessors in each city. The Elders and the assessors must meet whenever they are convened by the Elders, and they can settle all matters without the joint assembly of the others. When the Elders appoint delegates to local councilors, they must obey under penalty of two crowns in town or five crowns out of town, if they have to overlap. When the community of the Tenebrians assembles at the Merchant Hall, at the moment when the Elders go to the refectory they must order their man-servant to go through the church and invite those present to join them. If anyone arrives late after the Elders have begun their speeches, he must pay three crowns into the coffers. When the Elders are making their speeches standing at the desk, if some persons go and sit on the bench or commence to chat with one, two or more others, not listening to what the Elders are saying, they shall pay a crown into the coffers, as many as they are and as often as they do it. The same fine applies to meetings of the cities. He who opens the doors without the permission of the Elders shall pay five crowns into the coffers; he who goes away without permission, three crowns. The Elders can require whomsoever is under oath to tell the truth about any matter coming within Arges' law, under penalty of a fine of a pound of crowns. If a merchant undertakes an important or secondary deal, whether in Beraden or outside of Beraden, he must carry it through at his own expense. If he cannot or does not want to do so himself, let him ask another to be his spokesman. And the league must lend him assistance in his cause according to their power and goodwill.   So shall it be henceforth from this day, Aergas 15th, 1189."

One thing that jumped out at me was that people hate being told what to do, and I think some people would rage against their fate if they had a clear sign of it for all to see.   For example: Someone born a cleric may become a bitter and angry atheist that fights against what he sees as an unjust fate. This might be due to unfairness they perceive in life and proof that a god will intervene on behalf of humans, but only if they have enough MP  I could also picture people being marked a thief from birth, and the stigma that comes with that. People would be reasonable at first, when they see a baby with that mark they don't treat it any differently. However, as soon as the child acts out people start to attribute it to the mark, where a mage-marked child would just be thought of as a bratty child rather than an inherently bad person. This kind of stigma could push rogues to the fringes of society and become a self-fulfilling prophecy as thief-marked have trouble finding honest work (who wants to hire a thief?). A thief-marked may also be extremely law-abiding in an attempt to prove themselves as honest good people.  Of course anti-discrimination laws would be passed, but they would be largely ineffectual. Job hunters who arrive with their forearms covered would be quietly not hired. Even today we have trouble with employers asking for your facebook login to look for possible frowned-upon behavior (drinking, political rants, etc). Imagine if a prospective employee could turn invisible and rob you blind. And of course with government data-mining you would be put on a secret list with your name, SS number, and class. Rogues and necromancers may be put on watch-lists as well as particularly high leveled and dangerous classes.  Certain classes may choose to group together and pool their skills to watch out for each other and cover their weaknesses. A sort of adventuring party/guild system may pop up to offer protection and help to different groups of marked people.  I guess that the biggest question would be what everyone will do with their new abilities. Military usage is the obvious answer, but how many people not already signed up will really join the military? The enemy will have superpowers too. On the other hand, people will obviously use it for personal gain. A crime-wave of supercriminals is pretty likely even if all victims will have some powers. So we may end up with superheroes as well, or at least vigilantes.  I think that a comprehensive nation-wide neighborhood watch system may be created to organize patrols by average citizens to discourage superpowered crime.  It's all very interesting and I can't wait to see what comes of it. Keep us in the loop!"

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,Lysus,15,Mon Jul 20 06:01:27 2015 UTC,"The way I explained FTL travel for my Stars Without Number game was similar to this:  ""Gravity is really bad for transitioning between dimensions. Spike Space looks like shadowy waves while you're in it, the gravity wells of massive objects rippling out across the universe like rocks upsetting a still pond of water. You can ride these waves once you've punched through to the lower dimensions, surf them from one star to another, letting them propel your initial jaunt across the system, but once you crash into the gravity coming from the opposite direction, you get yanked back up into normal space. The chop is way too powerful to surf while in system, you'll get ripped apart if you try, but out past the Oort cloud and you have only the calm bellows that emanate from the tiny bright dot of a sun, and can safely drop to those lower dimensions."" This was to explain why the party had to fly in normal space for a day to get to the edge of the solar system every time they wanted to make a jump.  Stars Without Number has ship ""spike drives"" that are rated for traveling different distances in FTL. Your system could be very similar, but instead of FTL dependent on a drive's rating, it's dependent on the mass of the star.  Maybe the stars get categorized by Solar Masses into rough categories for how far they can propel ships. ""Category 1"" maybe like our sun, and it's just barely enough to get you to the closest system, but Category 10 is something huge that can get you really far."

One orbit at a certain distance (which is a variable that must be calculated based on the destination star) is required for the launch.  So the orbit can become something of a countdown, and could also act as the ""aiming"" mechanism, at least in part.  You end your orbit pointing straight toward the star.

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,imevul,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:26:35 2015 UTC,"The way I imagined it a while back works quite a bit like this one from ""The Outsider"", but with some important differences:   The ""jump point"" is actually a ""jump vector"" you have to go thru. Just being at a certain place and activating your jump drive is not enough: you need momentum in the right direction to get launched towards where you want to go. The ""jump"" isn't instantaneous, you still take time en-route via hyperspace. How much time depends on the engine you used, your speed when entering (below) and the distance to the destination. From my calculations, a standard civilian ship for 6 crew plus 10t cargo could travel about 10ly in some 6 hours, a heavy-cargo ship with 2000t plus a crew compliment of 8 would take about 12 hours, and a massive hauler would take close to 72 hours. A light passenger-only ship or advanced military cruiser, on the other hand, could probably manage it in about 2 hours, and a fast jumper in probably less than one hour, but only carrying 2 people plus luggage, and no fuel for the trip back. Spooling the jump coils is not instantaneous, and depends on the size of the coils. This means you can't jump on a moment's notice, and a civilian ship might manage it in less than a minute, but a hauler freighter might need a couple of hours to manage it. Newer jump coil generations are more efficient. Not only they need less energy to manage the same jumps, but can also complete them faster. Think aerodynamics thru hyperspace, with more efficient designs meaning less drag on the warp bubble. It also enables jumps from much shallower gravity wells. The evolution state of jump coils can also be the tuning for some of what's described below. Maximum jump distance depends on ship acceleration (which is actually not that hard to solve) and gravity well depth (as in your original description). Jumps of 100y are not rare, and scientific vessels can manage two to three orders of magnitude more with correct preparations (which may take upwards to a week between plotting, manoeuvring and accelerating, and not counting actual time travelled). Anything around 10 to 15 ly is considered usual, and pilot certification (for those who actually care about this) means planning and executing a 1ly jump ad-hoc. The travel time above doesn't take into account travel between the origin station and the jump point itself. This is usually inversely proportional to the ship's inertial mass and how efficient the inertial dampeners are (given you usually want to arrive on the other side pretty much alive), and the kind and amount of sublight engines present. Also, travel stations are usually NOT placed quite near to jump points, given the imprecise nature of jump arrivals. This also takes into account that the travel time between solar orbit and Earth orbit can be made in a less than a couple hours (between efficient engines and inertial dampeners), and pretty much the whole solar system can be reached with ease. The way I had it, you didn't jump when ""exiting"" the gravity well like the graphics from ""The Outsider"" show, but precisely at the bottom of it (your periapsis). Given the Oberth Effect, that's  also where you get a gravity assist (more below). Jumping isn't really limited to stars, either. Any gravity well will do, as long as you take into account the overall gravity of the vincinity and your jump isn't blocked (think eclipsed) by another gravity well (see below for misjumps). Of course, some jumps are just prohibitively expensive compared to sublight travel (you'd need some serious reason to jump between the moon and Earth instead of just flying there!). For example, travelling between Earth and Pluto via a quick jump is almost instantaneous, IF neither Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus or Neptune are closely aligned, but actually manoeuvring and getting the right momentum for the jump might take a while. Travelling back is way harder, since the gravity well of pluto is way too shallow. It would probably make much more sense to travel sublight to Neptune and jump from there. There is a single most-efficient jump trajectory between two wells (for a given jump coil), but many (almost infinite) not-so-efficient ones, that are actually the most efficient ones to take, given the laxing requisites in making each one. So, you could probably trade an extra couple minutes hyperspace travel time for not having to spend another hour finishing one more orbits around a star to align to the most optimised jump trajectory. The laxer the jumps, however, the higher the chances of a rough landing. This also means you can jump ""over"" midway gravity wells, trajectory and depth allowing. This is probably the case where a less capable ship would have to perform two jumps, while a more advanced ship (or with a better plotted course) can manage it in a single jump.  Inertia is mostly maintained, with some slight deceleration due to drag on hyperspace. This means two different things: one, you're probably going to need to fine tune your orbit (or manoeuvre) once you land, and two, you need to make sure your momentum is actually positive when you land (and not zero!), lest you might get sucked into whatever gravity well you landed on! The upside from this is, with a precisely coordinated set of jump manoeuvres and coil rechargers, chaining jumps is actually pretty viable, much to chagrin of those who suffer from jump-sickness-syndrom. Those will usually pay a premium for non-stop flights. As a reminder, two bodies still don't occupy the same space at the same time. Newtonian mechanics are treated as normal for these cases (aka: boom!). The effects of this happening while in hyperspace are not fully explored as of yet, but probably not less catastrophic, given the debris arriving at the other side. Activating a jump coil doesn't create a ""tunnel"" thru hyperspace that the ship travel inside, but rather creates a bubble of ""space"" around a ship while simultaneously propelling it thru the depths of hyperspace. The deceleration from hyperspace depends on a gravity well pulling you back into normal space (these are common in any kind of space). The trick is, it needs to be done slowly, hence you need to ""ease"" on the gravity well on the other side, so you can slowly get back into normal space. This differs from what ""The Outsider"" describes on the link above, where you won't just ""punch thru"" normal space and go thru ""negative hyperspace"". What will happen on a sudden return to normal space is more akin to ""splat!"".  On missing the jump, this actually depends a lot on your trajectory and how prepared is your ship for this to happen. Ever seen those videos of cars jumping ramps? if you're taking a sports car on a really vertical jump, missing the trajectory is rather catastrophic (""splat!""). If, on the other hand, you're driving a 'bigfoot' monster car on a shallow jump, you can land pretty much anywhere without any hassle and still get cheered on. My take on this is this also improves on each generation, to the point where a jump under 10ly is pretty commonplace now, and a civilian ship can probably mis-jump it and land halfway still unscathed. Problem, though, is travelling the rest of 5 ly on sublight engines, so you really don't want to land anywhere far from any gravity wells, since even your distress calls will take quite a while to land. Some kind of ""artificial"" jump well technology is in development, that can serve as a life-buoy for cases when a tripulated ship lands far away from a natural gravity well. Using this is a last-ditch effort to save life, though, since activating this kind of device alters the gravity vicinity of whatever is travelling nearby, and while it might be used to allow a re-jump for a ship that misjumped, it might also affect the trajectory of a vessel already on a successful course thru hyperspace.   As for your jump trajectory, jump manoeuvres can be made in two different ways:   you enter orbit around the origin gravity well, and using orbital manoeuvres you fine-tune your orbit and momentum, so that the jump point matches your periapsis (less energy spent) and your momentum at that time matches the destination route you want to take. you fly a single-pass trajectory that puts you in the right periapsis with the right momentum, the right speed and at the time of alignment with your destination. This is possible with some pretty descent window pre-calculation (""wanting"" to do this is probably not be enough, you might need to actually wait for the stars to align in order for this to be viable) or a WHOLE LOT of luck (which is pretty much how this method of travel was discovered).   Also, the central point in my story: What happens if the gravity well gets changed while the jump is in progress? Say, a star goes supernova, or collapses into a black hole?"

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,runetrantor,5,Mon Jul 20 12:04:32 2015 UTC,"One more element to this would be if you would have to take the target orbit into account to ""catch"" you when you arrive. That means that you can't travel too long distances to smaller stars either, because you would have to orbit too close to the star to stop at your destination.  Also, the information you would need to do this is:   Source stars mass, launch orbit, temperature at orbit, exit vector, (speed?) Target stars mass, catch orbit, temperature at orbit Your mass, and heat protection capabilities   The catch orbit would be different for each source star depending on the mass of the ship, and the velocity of the ship (that I assume depends on the mass of the souce star and the distance)  This also means that you have to travel between stars, or you would not be able to stop. Also, would it then be possible to travel by proxy? Say, slingshot around a star to get a slower velocity and make you able to stop at your intended destination?"

If there is, it proceeds to jump.  If not, it forbids you from doing so.  These mechanisms would be for the civilian and military ships, the scout ships that dared to map the galaxy disabled the safety (Was not made yet?) to go beyond known areas, many were lost.

To work, your drive has to access the correct 4th dimension in which the part of reality we call ""distance"" isn't a factor.  To access these dimensions requires a complicated ballet of calculation which are unique to each ship and star. First, the ship must resist the forces of star that cause it to orbit, and to be drawn in. This causes a ""build up"" of the 3rd dimension where a force of reality that is attempting to act is unable to perform its duty. This requires a massive amount of energy which is gathered from the sun via light & heat absorption at a rate that increases proportionally to the amount of force being resisted. And then, at some point the amount of energy being absorbed from the sun punches through the build-up and causes dimensional ""lift"", essentially allowing the build up to pass over the ship which pushes it into the fourth dimension.  The technique for aiming requires positioning the ship at an angle which allows for the correct proportions of force buildup and heat acquisition at the same point on the nose heat-shield of the ship, in a manner which is similar to the process of focusing a lens so that it magnifies the effects of incoming sun-rays. If the ship is pointed incorrectly, or suffers too much jostling due to resistance of orbital force, then when it jumps it might end up somewhere other than its destination. If the jump is short, then the ship can remain further away from the star to acquire the necessary momentum and make the jump with fewer risks. Of course, if a quick jump is needed then a ship can travel closer to the star to allow the build up to occur more quickly. Larger stars are possessed of greater gravitational momentum, and are thus capable of greater 4th-dim sling-shot distances.  When the ship enters 4th dimension, it does so at a speed which is proportional to the amount of force buildup that it was resisting before it experienced dimensional lift. However, since it transitioned into a dimension in which distance is not a factor, we perceive the time between entrance and exit as nearly instantaneous. In fact, the ship is propelled through this distance-less 4th dimension (4th-d) like a pebble out of an orbital sling-shot; just as the pebble gradually slows due to air resistance and begins to fall because of gravity, so too will the ship gradually slow in the 4th dimension. However, in 4th-d, the air resistance is gravity expressed by the stars between the origin and the destination."

It would be sort of like drawing a dot on both ends of a stretched elastic cord and measuring the distance between them, then letting the cord snap back into place and measuring the distance between the dots again. Maybe half the distance between those answers would be how far the ship travelled.  This method would repel the ship from the massive object, so the ship would have to be in position between the origin star and the target star. With something like the Inverse-square law, the distance the ship could travel would increase the closer it was to the origin star (better shielding against heat = greater potential distance). You'd likely want to free-fall towards the origin star before engaging device and over shoot the target star because the ship would maintain its free-fall velocity (towards the origin) when its kicked out the other side.  Even if mankind stumbled upon this today, it would be hard for us to harness. The fastest thing we have is the spacecraft Juno with speeds of around 165,000 mph (the earth is orbiting the sun at 67,000 mph). Getting in position and calculating all the spatial bends between origin and destination would take a long time. Stacking free-falls would mean that the ship's ""impulse"" would start slow but build up with each jump (as long as it doesn't need to drastically change directions), so sequential jumps could get progressively faster. Slingshotting around stars could be done to some extent, but the velocity would have to be altered gradually so the g-forces wouldn't kill the passengers.  You'd have to ask some physicists what the effects of ""free-falling"" towards massive objects would be. This device could theoretically get out of the event horizon of a black-hole and kick the ship out in another galaxy, but time dilation would mean that 10 seconds in the ship near the black hole might be 1000 years for anyone on earth. It would also be moving so fast that it would need to ""cushion"" itself with the gravity of the target black hole to slow down, but it would probably be torn to shreds by space particles long before then.  Good luck with all this. :)"

I too had been thinking of a similar idea in that hyperspace jumps are tied to gravity wells of stars, but you have developed the whole thing way further (i only got as far as general thoughts about it), nicely done and i think gives way more options storywise that stereotypical 'lets just jump to hyperspace or warp speed whenever we want'"
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,EOverM,8,Mon Jul 20 05:14:02 2015 UTC,That's pretty neat. I was thinking how you could use massive black hole like arport hubs.
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,furnavi,15,Mon Jul 20 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had the Idea that actually reaching black holes would sometimes cut travel time. They'd act as big launch hubs but would not receive from many stars, as mass does not affect other stars' reach of you."

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,AeonCOR,9,Mon Jul 20 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"You could potentially have some black holes large enough that they can act as a two way road between them, as the 'intercontinental' travel road, and once you reach the other black hole, or your destination proper if your systems are accurate enough (Jumping so far out may be hard to pinpoint a teeny tiny star? Since black holes would have huge ranges), and once you want to go back, you go to the closest giant star or at least the largest main sequence one around you, which is the regional hub, from there to the next regional hub until the Black Hole, then off you go.  Black holes would be fought over and systems near them would be the 'core worlds' since trade tends to pass by easily."
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,Valendr0s,5,Mon Jul 20 08:55:20 2015 UTC,"You might want to put a hazy number on the jump radius based on gravity, for worldbuilding purposes, but mainly just to see how far out the super massive black hole at the center of the galaxy reaches. If it goes far enough, you might have problems with the Fermi paradox, because such a large transport device should make us flooded with aliens. Though you could say the aliens were at a similar development stage as we were and we all flooded each other at the same time."
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,Alexoxela,3,Mon Jul 20 11:01:36 2015 UTC,"Just some quick napkin math...  Assuming that our Sun has enough mass in it to get us to Prosima Centauri using your drive (i.e., our system isn't a ""dead end"" system), that would mean we could get at least 4.24 light years out of a star with our sun's mass.  Assuming that the mass to distance ratio is a straight line, we could go pretty damn far from the black hole at the center of our galaxy.  With a mass somewhere around 4.31 million times the mass of our sun, that would mean we could travel  18.75 million light-years from there.  This would give us access to anywhere in the Milky Way, and a fairly large amount of the galaxies in the Local Group (exactly which ones/how many, I'll let someone else say).  td;dr: the black hole at the center of our galaxy would allow for inter-galactic transit, assuming we can travel from the Sun to our closest neighbor."
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,I_throw_socks_at_cat,2,Mon Jul 20 18:06:58 2015 UTC,"If mass doesn't affect receiving, then why does travel have to be star-to-star? Theoretically, you could arrive anywhere within the origin star's mass/distance range if the destination's mass isn't a factor. And if so, I don't think anyone would try and arrive right next to a star if they had any other options.  I'd suggest that destination mass is required, but not on a sliding scale like the range of departure. Rather, the drive requires a gravity of a certain minimum to stop/exit hyperspace/whatever mechanic you require. Stars would therefore be the obvious choice as they are also of sufficient mass to act as departure points, but black holes and even some significant gas giants could act as destination anchors. They'd have a smaller effective area to stop in, probably an even narrower margin of error than stopping with a star. But it could be done.  In fact, with precise enough frequencies, you could jump to otherwise hidden locations in the space between systems: a stealth space station orbiting a black hole, perhaps? The mechanic opens up options while also explaining why travel usually must be from star to star."

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,stealthmissionary,2,Mon Jul 20 09:12:06 2015 UTC,"Mass does affect receiving.  It was specified that it works by linking the space curvature of massive objects, and given the massive disparity between how massive a planet and even a small star is, I very much doubt a planet would be enough to be the other end.  So yes, there likely is a minimum mass required."
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,Alexandre_Dumbass,8,Mon Jul 20 11:18:48 2015 UTC,"I love this concept! I've been toying around with FTL travel so this is very relevent to my interests. In particular, I love the idea of a FTL drive that isn't over powered. I do have some questions, though.  How does the ship's altitude above a star effect the result of the jump? What about its velocity?  Is there only one frequency to safely jump to a star or are there multiple that correspond to different end positions and velocities? If so, how hard would it be to calculate a jump that would end in a different trajectory given a valid starting frequency? How far could your jump end from the star? How fast or slow could you end at?  Would ships carrying this drive be able to reenter the atmosphere of planets? If not, I think a better name for the heat shield would be a radiation shield IMHO. Also the ships would need some very effective heat radiating systems to cool down the heat / radiation shield.  How do the star drive's components scale with ship size / mass? Is there a sweet spot for efficiency?  How does the ship store energy to power the drive?  Also I made your ship in kerbal space program :) And here is what happened when I pointed the ship away from the sun for 2 seconds. The shield worked great though."
worldbuilding,3dwh8t,duncanmcconchie,2,Mon Jul 20 09:47:36 2015 UTC,"Thank you! And thanks for the kerbal ship! It's a good idea and it just helped me visualise a bit haha!  Altitude: One idea I had is the nearer you are to the star, the farther you'll be from the destination one. So, jumps from red dwarfs to blue giants are extremely tricky, if not impossible.  Frequency: I don't know yet if I want multiple frequencies possible, or maybe part of the frequency represents the velocity, so if you botch the calculations you can end up on a vector straight toward the star.  Heat shield: You are right, it should have another name. Heat shields are stuff for reentry.  Size: In my mind the drive is quite big and still requires a lot of energy. That is why jump drones exist for large ships of older design. For smaller ships, docking to a bigger one is mandatory.  Thanks for your questions, it helped shape the design more precisely, I'll update the album with some more images!"

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,Flightopath,5,Mon Jul 20 09:35:34 2015 UTC,"I assume the black hole at the center of the galaxy could be used to go to every star in the galaxy, and even other galaxies in a similar way?  So the center of the galaxy (a relatively safe area anyway - Say at a star/neutron star massive enough to be one jump away from the galactic black hole, and far enough away to be safe from the turbulence of the center) is a massive trade hub, the center of government, the galactic center of news and culture. Traders gather goods, jump to the outer reaches of the galaxy in one jump, then puddle jump star to star back to the center.    I REALLY like this idea. It adds so much to a story. Suddenly your travel system itself adds strategy into your universe.  From city planning. The bigger the gravity well, the more desirable the location for trade, culture, etc. Your New York City, your Tokyo. But smaller gravity wells might have to puddle jump a lot to leave their system (but invaders/traders would get there instantly). Here are your rural areas. People scraping to get by. Your rebels, your secret bases, your struggling heros.  To escaping a pursuer... Maybe you are puddle-jumping away, with few options for your next jump. Maybe even using gas giants as a fake-out jump... But your haven is a huge gravity well. Once you make it to a huge star or a black hole, you're as good as safe - your options are too numerous for your pursuer to figure out your destination even if they get a general idea, they can never know if they're right or not.  To getting stranded. You can jump to a system that doesn't have any systems in its vicinity. Maybe that's why nobody comes to Earth. Our star just isn't big enough to leave the system, so any visitors have to use traditional engines and relativistic propulsion to leave. And if you jump to the wrong coordinates, you're stranded...  Even exploring completely different galaxies. The one-way trip aspect adds stress, complexity, and drama that we don't have in other stories. Imagine being able to get from New York City to small-town-ville North Dakota in seconds, but it taking weeks or months to return. Why would people even make that trip? Why not just send goods directly rather than sending people?"

The example I've heard multiple times: if you replace the sun with a black hole of equal mass, the Earth's orbit would not be perturbed.   The difference is that you can come a lot closer to a black hole without being inside it, so the radius value in the gravitational force calculation can be a lot smaller.  Quick edit: oh, but the ""gravity well"" would reach a much greater depth near the black hole. Conceptually infinite. If you're just using the force of gravity for this system, I suppose you could use any black hole to go anywhere, as long as you don't get torn apart."

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,holomanga,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:45 2015 UTC,"This is pretty cool.  In my universe, most FTL travel is done through massive launchers built inside barren planets. They use the heat of the core to generate energy, and the gravity from the planet helps to keep the ships aligned properly while traveling through the tube. The ""launcher"" causes the ships to become out-of-phase, essentially moving them partially into an alternate universe where the speed of light is much higher. While they're in the other universe, they can't interact with anything in our universe (so they'll just slip right through any matter in our universe). The launch has to be calibrated properly so that they phase back in at the right time. They also must make sure that the launcher is facing the proper direction, so they must wait for the planet to rotate accordingly. Launch windows are usually very precise and scale with the size of the planet, but also with how fast it rotates.   Also this is basically a one-shot launch. If the targeted star system has no launcher, there's no return. However in most systems regulations prevent launching to undeveloped systems unless you hold the proper permits. More extreme regulations only allow for travel to these systems if you're part of a convoy to build a launcher. More lax systems may allow anyone to travel anywhere.   Because the energy in the launch systems comes from the planets, larger planets can typically launch further than smaller planets. Some civilizations have been known to build military launchers that are not bound to planets as well. They're usually powered by massive relays of solar and nuclear power. One civilization even contains a small singularity and generates energy from it. These launchers are used mainly for military purposes and are not restricted to any particular facing. However, these launchers are extremely expensive and few exist. Those that do exist are usually top secret."

worldbuilding,3dwh8t,cobalt_coyote,2,Mon Jul 20 18:34:24 2015 UTC,"Hey I think this is a really good idea and I was just trying to imagine how it would look (as a suggestion since you seemed to be taking them). I would think that the point of connection between the two stars would be at the center of mass where the gravity well accelerates you to (not quite the center of the star but basically right next to it). One could imagine that a ship equipped with this kind of drive would open a wormhole/bridge between the two stars, almost like a tunnel and then it would be accelerated at tremendous relative speed through that tunnel. For more added visual effect, mass from both stars could shoot out the opposite ends of the tunnel. So if you were jumping through a yellow star to a blue star, it would look like a swirl of bright blue stellar matter were jetting out of the yellow star, engulfing the ship. From the ships perspective, it would accelerate down into the vortex passing through streams of intense light and radiation (this part would be difficult to rationalize a ship doing for many obvious reasons). I think this would be really cool to see. From a writers perspective, the best part about this is that it has built in plot restraints. I could definitely see a situation in which a ship is forced to jump to a system that cannot be jumped out of again. All in all, I think you have a really cool idea here and I'm personally really tempted to borrow it for my story. Maybe call it the Olchose drive or something."

worldbuilding,3dzhkf,WaywardWordsmith,14,Mon Jul 20 20:05:42 2015 UTC,"Towns spring up everywhere in a standard rural situation - people who provide goods and services too specialized to make a living off of the customers in a single village end up clustering in larger settlements to serve a larger market from the surrounding countryside.  Towns will exist nearly everywhere, likely amidst a larger network of villages (especially in a pre-modern setting); most towns will never be anything much bigger or more important.  No slight to them, they have a very important economic role to play - it's just not a very interesting one.  Cities exist for specific reasons.    Very often, a city is present because it is a transportation hub - a place where two major navigable rivers meet, a place where major roads cross, where the river meets sea, any particularly good harbor that is also readily accessible by its hinterland - basically any situation where a lot of traffic needs to change transportation modes.    Cities also are created or promoted for political reasons - the government of a large province generally prefers to be centralized, and it needs to be put somewhere - wherever it ends up tends to become a city, just because government needs government workers and government workers need support goods and services.  (This is often completely arbitrary; see the process most US states have in choosing their capitals.)    Cities that are transportation hubs usually get bigger than cities that are administrative centers: compare New York to Washington DC.  Cities that are neither transportation hubs nor administrative centers have some unique factors in history that explain their prominence.  Las Vegas is a city instead of a town because it got into two unique (at the time) businesses - divorce and gambling - at the same time as it was buoyed by a huge number of construction jobs on a giant dam (which was paid for and ordered built by people far from Las Vegas itself).  There are many places in Florida that are cities rather than towns because people from New York City find the weather agreeable and choose to retire there; take away New York, or the dream of retiring to warm weather, and Florida's towns would be considerably less developed -- as swampy, sandy Florida is not an exceptionally good transportation hub."

Look first for good harbors - on the ocean, on navigable rivers, and on inland seas / great lakes.  It takes more to make a good harbor than just being on the shore, so not every settlement next to water will be a city, obviously.  Also look where trade (the flow of natural resources, manufactured goods, or even people) crosses your map on a large scale.  On any place where two or more different trade lines cross or meet, that's a good candidate for a town to become a city.  If you have a large area where neither applies - an inland area with no navigable waters and only one line of trade, if any - then pretty much any random town could get promoted to city status (probably just small city status) as the regional government arbitrarily sets up shop there.  And you can plop down cities just about anywhere that you could put a town, if the cities got big for specific reasons - historical instances of unexpectedly large numbers of people and/or wealth moving there.  Religious migrations (Salt Lake City), providing services that are for some reason extremely rare yet extremely desirable and remain so for a long time (Las Vegas), becoming fashionable among the elite of other cities (Miami, etc., for retirees in the 20th century; Denver for wealthy people with lung diseases in the 19th century), etc."

worldbuilding,3dzhkf,igncom1,4,Tue Jul 21 01:55:09 2015 UTC,"It's more because boat traffic is and always has been, for large volumes or sufficient distances, cheaper than land traffic, but yes, same idea.  You have the right idea with the layout of village/town/city on that map."
worldbuilding,3dzhkf,kfdirector,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"Personally, I see 2 problems with your map:  The 2 towns the further to the right of the city on the left, the one at the bottom and the one above.  In both cases, they are closer to the water than the city, and as such, I think that there would be a mid-city that could prop-up in the middle.  For the one at the top, it's especially problematic since it is closer to the top-left town of the city on the right and to its hub city.  Consider Québec, my province.  Most of the population lives on the shores of the St-Lawrence river.  Our metropole, Montréal, is on an island in the south-west. Let's say it's your left city. It was built because boats couldn't continue until locks were built.  Our provincial capital (much smaller than Montréal) is where the river widens so much you can't see the other shore. Let's says it's your right city.  Between them, there is Trois-Rivière (Three Rivers) where well, three rivers drop into the St-Lawrence river.  That city is smaller than Québec and Montréal, but towns North and South feel closer to Trois-Rivière than to either Québec or Montréal.  In your case, you would have a smaller red dot, perhaps where the river is almost vertical, with the 2 outside towns linked to that one instead of the othe 2. The top-left town of the right city might also be linked to it in ADDITION to being linked to the right city, kind of like Victoriaville (Montréal and Trois-Rivière) and Sherbrooke (Trois-Rivière and Québec city) are each linked to 2 cities.  Those towns then tend to be bigger than other towns. Sherbrooke for example, is as far as I know the only towns to have 2 Universities (yet, Montreal has 4, and Québec at least 2, and Trois-Rivière only 1)."

worldbuilding,3dzhkf,igncom1,2,Tue Jul 21 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"The short answer for you will be population, population, population.  The second answer is jobs. Cities, especially in pre-modern times, usually had one or more major industries that employed a significant sector of the population. Shipping was a major one, with few major cities anywhere in the world that wasn't a port prior to industrialization (and fairly few after, to be honest). Agriculture by its very nature is spread out, so cities are not going to be agricultural hubs. But manufacturing is very much a possibility, if you're in a post-industrial setting. Temple complexes, especially those in religions that feature pilgrimage as an important part of faith, are also good bets since pilgrims bring in a constant stream of money.  People + jobs + food/water/shelter is your basic formula for a city. Also bear in mind that cities and towns often serve a much greater population than just those within their borders; the surrounding countryside may flock to the city for cultural or legal needs, to to find specific good or services that aren't available out in the boonies."

After I got the hang of it, I cannot go back to the old way of random notes, now I can simply add a note line at the end of pages that are relevant to the note and go back later to enter it in correctly.

Though the current allies of the Iskarn figured out their language some time before they allied. The Iskarn aren't aware of this.  There is a exception here though, a Iskarn allied with a Maltran (seeded human) implanted a cybernetic component into his friend. The implant allowed for both of them to exchange data using the Iskarn language. It prevented anyone from listening in. The implant also allowed the Maltran to interface with Iskarn technology to operate their equipment and vehicles.  Note that any other Iskarn would normally never consider this, the level of trust between the two in the earlier example is somewhat unique."

During the Senullan occupation of Lesser Orita, the region was forced to replace Oritannes with the Tesenul language whenever possible, a fact that made many Oritans angry. The occupying Senullan troops could understand spoken Oritannes to an extent, and already had trouble reading written Oritannes, so a new system of writing the language was developed to sneak messages past the soldiers.  ""River Oritannes,"" or ras-jirole-oritan, links all symbols in a word together without lifting the stylus. The ink ""flows"" along the word, hence the name. One or more loops between a pair of symbols denotes prefixes or suffixes. (Think cursive script, but where normal English words were written with symbols outlining each letter for easy reading,   [L][I][K][E]--[S][O]).  After the occupation, River Oritannes became very popular, especially with the younger generation, and is now gradually supplanting ""Footstep Oritannes"" for being quicker to write with."

For premodern conditions, one unique approach is to think about what kind of crops the people grow, the kind of climate required, and the effects that would have on the social order.  For instance, swiddening societies, which grow a huge variety of primarily root crops in plots that are allowed to revert to nature when not in use, live at high elevations, tend to be relatively stateless, they don't usually partake in war and slavery, look to revelatory, millenarian religious leaders, and usually have stories about having once known how to write before losing the art.  These social orders can divide themselves into perpetually smaller units, especially as you get higher in elevation. Peoples that grow wet rice are in many ways the opposite.  They tend to live in river valleys, go to war and use captives as slaves, have permanent priestly classes, well developed states, well developed literary culture, and are very community focused; every one in the village has to work together for water management projects, like building canals, levees, and digging irrigation.  In China's rice growing south, the stereotype is that people there are more socially savvy, cunning, and even two faced compared to the wheat growing north."

worldbuilding,3dw2vg,Andyman117,9,Mon Jul 20 00:38:48 2015 UTC,"The Foundation for Human Interests classifies superpowers by the type of ability, and then within abilities by strength of the power, usually using mythological names to represent them.  For instance, They classify superstrength in 4 levels (from weakest to strongest): Samson, Hercules, Gilgamesh, and Thor. Or Pyrokinesis: Elijah, Hephaestus, and Surtr.  Sometimes, certain recurring combinations of powers get separate additional classifications, regardless of power level. Dwarf Class is super strength, increased durability, enhanced intelligence, and unofficially, most with the classification are shorter than 5'5"" and have a substance addiction (usually alcohol). Just like Dwarves. Cherubim class is the combo of flight, superstrength, a healing factor verging on immortality, or actual immortality. Fenris Class is a two-state shapeshifting power (guess what they turn into), a variable strength healing factor, and an immunity to damage not of a certain type (silver is the only thing that hurts them, and is poisonous to the touch for them).  And of course, some powers are completely unique, and thus unclassifiable.  Some character examples:  Roxanne Furst is Dwarf Class, Thor Class strength, Odin Class intelligence, Prometheus Class healing factor (the lowest grade above normal human healing; she can still regrow limbs, but it takes a long time), with a unique power of having her bones replace themselves with Adamantium, rendering them unbreakable (if she loses an arm and grows the arm back, her bones are normal calcium until the day or so it takes to re-adamantify (yes that is the technical term)).   Xena Noble is Surtr Class pyro, Merlin Class shapeshifter, and the unclassifiable power of being able to physically and mentally absorb another person into herself (she had only managed two victims before one of them managed to mentally sabotage the ability, and they were where she got the Pyro and Shapeshifting. She's three people with superpowers all stuffed into one body, and they all share powers now.  Karen Reis is Artemis class (ability to hit anything with a weapon 100% of the time), and only Artemis Class. She also has an inferiority complex, but that's not a superpower.  Ashley Scomparsa is Cherubim Class, Gilgamesh Class strength, Hydra Class healing factor, Hermes Class flight, and Surtr Class pyro."

As I stated before, the way the power is activated is just as important as what it does in terms of classification. As an example: two people have super strength of equal power, one is in the Physical Enhancement catagory, while the other is in the Transformation catagory. What causes the difference is that Hero A naturally has super strength all the time, while Hero B can grow enormous muscles on demand, but also change back into a normal person.

Underverse powers: The Underverse is a recently-discovered parallel dimension where the physics are slightly different to our own, though the physical makeup is also mostly slave to our dimension. That dark matter/energy scientists have been looking for? Right in there, manipulating our dimension at its densest points. The ability to disappear into this dimension, manipulate gravity in our own, and see types of radiation our dimension doesn't have are but a few of the feats made possible by tampering with the Underverse. Psychic power: Technically detectable in the Underverse, but distinguished for its uniqueness in origin and function. Alien in nature but passed quickly onto humans, it covers many abilities from hivemind linking, to auto-brain-failure (useful when a hivemind drone is captured for questioning), to individual psychic powers for higher-ranking soldiers. The hivemind calls itself the Collective, with the exception of one psychic whose power involves heightened empathy; he alone escapes the hivemind effect of his base psychic power. Magic: Granted to a portion of the first sapient humans by the Titan Prometheus. The refined fire of Mount Olympus. The ability to turn imagination into reality, be it by willing an object to levitate or for fire to rain down from the sky. Bypasses most physical powers offensively, and most physics by nature. Divine power: Beats out magic. Granted to angels by the big-G God. More effective against wicked mortals than against the innocent; very effective at demon-slaying. Accessed by humans by means of transfer from angels or demons (the latter of whom can steal this power from angels).

worldbuilding,3dw47k,Grine_,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:24:20 2015 UTC,"Deities are a very real presence. Though they technically exist outside of the universe, their influence in this one is strong enough that they may do as they please. The ambiguity of deities lies in their other aspects; what happens when you kill a god? Leading cosmologists theorize that deities perceive time in this universe as a physical dimension, along which they may move freely. This means that if a god is somehow slain, their existence does not end, but they are no longer able to enter the period of time in which they have been killed. This is unconfirmed, but asking the gods themselves will get one nowhere, as no living deity understands the function of the cosmos. Intelligent as they may seem, gods are neither omniscient nor omnipotent, but are so far beyond mortal capabilities that this distinction is usually meaningless.  Most religions are more akin to contracts, with the exception of worshipers of the dead gods. These dead gods cannot contact the mortal world directly (or possibly at all), and so the followers must more or less make it up as they go.  Gods interact with each other much the same way as humans do, forming grudges and friendships. Most deities have a particular region in which they remain most of the time, for reasons unknown. Depending on the deity's whim, they might treat all in this region as subjects, slaves, or wards. Or they might ignore them altogether. All races can communicate with all living gods, with the exception of the Qarqotep; the flawed nature of their souls (Otan the Giver was killed before completing them) prevents them from communicating directly with deities, forcing the gods to use mortal go-betweens, should they decide to communicate with them.  There are three known means by which deities are created;   A deity may split off a portion of themselves to form a new deity A deity may spontaneously form from an area highly saturated with magical energies, though this is rare A mortal may, by some means, absorb the power of a deity, or more likely hundreds or thousands of other mortals, ascending into godhood through the sacrifice"

Nearly every religion reveres the same core pantheon, albeit they interpret them differently.   Interactions with mortals started with huge, barely controlled attempts to answer prayers followed by silence as they attempted to figure out how to control their powers culminating in answering prayers through chosen prophets, oracles, and other blessed people."

She often interacts with the protagonist indirectly, through her prophet Theresa Landis and Clara the Reaper  I'm my fantasy setting, the gods are less real (as in, they stop being gods if no one knows about them) and powerful, but generally just as active in the world. Shii, Shal, and Shel, the most active and powerful, all actively travel the world and act as tricksters to people, and guide destined heroes towards their fates. Less powerful, Dracula (God/Father of the Vampires) is active among his people, but hasn't been amongst non-vampires since his first daughter was kidnapped by the Magi. Fenris (God/Father of Werewolves) likewise since his first son's death at the hands of the Alchemists. Piscia, goddess of the Scattered Isles, is active in the world via her avatar Meira. The various Forgotten Ones hide in the dark corners of the world, waiting in their temple for someone to discover them again. Some of the Forgotten Ones' invented Magic are still used unrelated to them, such as Necromancy and Soulbinding, but the Forgotten Ones gain very little power from the magic without worship.  In my scifi universe, people are religious, but the existence of gods is just as indeterminate as the real world."

In my own Pathfinder based setting though I'm going to go for the more subtle approach.  Gods are nearly Deistic, having very little direct influence over the world other than providing the power for divine magic.    They instead play the long con, planting ideas, applying small pressures at crucial moments.  I like the idea of gods being something very much evident through magic, but being almost entirely inscrutable.  I also imagine their real motives as being very different from what most people ascribe to them.  A god of light may be just as willing to kill as a god of darkness, they simply have different styles as to how they accomplish their goals."

worldbuilding,3dw47k,Frostyetiwizard,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:22:37 2015 UTC,"My world has gods and their assorted servants (angels, demons, spirits, formerly dragons) and they are active, but their roles in the lives of mortals are limited. Some of them (eight, to be precise), the ""Cardinal Gods"", are the eternal, completely immortal, effectively omnipotent and omniscient capital-G ""Gods"" that the term brings to mind, and then the rest of the ""true gods"" that were born with that level of power were created by the Cardinal Gods as assistants, since just because you have the power to do everything yourself doesn't mean you want to do it. The there are the Transcendent Gods, which are humans or other non-divine beings that have been empowered by the faith and prayer of others. For the most part, the transcendent gods are weaker than the true gods, but exceptions exist: not counting the cardinal eight, the most powerful god is Shalor, a transcended human. (There were a few transcended dragons high up there too, but Shalor killed them.)  The ability of the gods to interfere in the affairs of mortals is limited by the rules they follow (either willingly or by coercion) to avoid conflict with each other: they cannot jump between worlds uninvited. What this means is that spirits and angels and demons (and gods) need to be summoned before they can come to the material world. After they're here though, they have no particular incentive to obey property law, so none of that ""invited across the threshold"" nonsense, although some of the more clever ones might feign such a weakness as part of a greater scheme. The summoner also has no power to banish or command the summoned spirit unless he can get the spirit to make a binding pact to that effect; if no pact exists, or it was improperly made, the spirit is free to wander as it pleases, as long as it does not leave this world.  In practice, there are limitations to the rule: the celestial bureaucracy of gods and spirits that are charged with enforcing it have neither the time nor patience to track down every little imp that seeks to cause mischief or all of the minor angels that try to shoo the imps back to the darkness. This is most often exploited by a powerful spirit or demon that the gods would catch instead sending a far lesser subordinate that the gods would overlook to slip summoning notes into an apprentice's book or similar tricks to get a hapless mage to accidentally ""invite"" the powerful spirit to the material world.  The other major limitation to the rule is that some gods, the Cardinal Eight especially, are simply too powerful for the bureaucrats to enforce the rule upon, and so these powerful ones are restrained more by concern for the consequences, either reprisal by their peers, for the neutral or malevolent ones, or collateral damage, for the benevolent ones. In a sense, one of the few limits on their power is that they have a very hard time ""dialing it down"" far enough for a world filled with squishy mortals. For the cardinal gods, even the most minor of actions performed with the lowest power they can manage will usually leave craters in the vicinity.  Now, while the existence of gods is known, and people know there are afterlives, what is not known is how people will be sorted into them. So that is where most of the divergence regarding religious practices occurs. Different religions have differing ideas on what the ""best"" afterlife is, and what is the best way to get into the one of their choice. Some would say worship is the best (unless it's taken to the level of ""pals with Jesus"", then no, it isn't,) and other might say it is your actions or the stories people tell of you (depends on the individual taking your soul to the afterlife)."

While countless religions have existed in Aitherion with their own pantheons, the spread of the scientific method and empirical study have forced many to contend with the notion that not only do nobody's gods exist, the Aitherionians are alone in the universe.   This conclusion is only half-wrong, however."
worldbuilding,3dw47k,CrystalGlacia,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:05:36 2015 UTC,"On Taijian, the various religions have different degrees of ""involvement"" among their deities. The dominant religion on Shipato, Tane-kio or ""Stewardism,"" believes in a deity called the Hidden One responsible for creating the world. According to their beliefs, the Hidden One abandoned Taijian once They saw the world was stable, tasking humanity with caring for the world in Their absence. It is also believed that the Hidden One will someday return to Taijian when things are at their worst, stepping in to right the wrongs and to punish or reward those who neglected or assisted in the world's caretaking, respectively.  On Bazeerah to the north, there exists a religion called San iha Tere; in this belief system, there are a multitude of minor gods and spirits in charge of various aspects of the world. It is believed that these beings interact and intercede with humans when asked, and people often make petitions to varying deities for whatever they might need. If these petitions are not granted, it is assumed someone else is asking the same being for the opposite request. All of the various deities are also considered parts of a greater consciousness called San, but San only manifests when the entire pantheon comes together in agreement on something. In this state, San is said to be omnipotent.  Some religious scholars in Tane-kio lands believe San and the Hidden One to be the same being, given two vastly different interpretations as time, language, and culture separated the two religions. No concise proof of either the existence or the nonexistence of these beings has been found.  The truth? The Creator is very real, but neither of these two religions--both of which originated from the same predecessor belief system long ago--have it right."
worldbuilding,3dw47k,SceptileMasterr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:42:13 2015 UTC,"The gods are very much real, and definitely sentient. To the vast majority, that is self-evident. However, they don't act like mortals, at least not on the scale of mortals. The magic that they provide is not all that clear-cut. It is a pattern in the ley that streams down from the god's domain for mortals to do what they please with.   For example, a god of ""purity and strength,"" may lend out magic well-suited to that task, however, the precise interpretation comes down to the believer.   A healer may interpret this as, ""purity of body and strength of soul,"" using the god's magic to cure disease, cleanse wounds and do his utmost to be devout and holy.   An inquisitor may interpret this as ""purity of the populace and strength to do as needed."" he might end up using the same magic to scorn and smite those he believes to be wicked. He could use that magic to torture and extract confessions. Being holy himself is not as important as ensuring that the rest of the world is free from sin.   These two people, although they worship the same god have come to very different conclusions as to what the god expects. They might be complete rivals, even fighting or killing each other because these interpretations are mutually exclusive. It's unlikely that either of them are going to suddenly lose their powers unless the god takes a personal interest in the affairs of men. Which does happen from time to time, but usually the gods have larger concerns.   These larger concerns affect other gods. The gods do, in fact get in their own battles and wars, fighting over decisions or rivalries, and occasionally they do die. They do have many interactions. The largest of which was constructing a great framework that would hold the shifting magical streams known as ley together. If these streams grow too erratic, the world could be destroyed. Alas, that was not to be. The gods' rivalries, scheming and bids for power turned out to be greater than their will to save the world and themselves from a demise in the far future."

A lot about human-deity interaction, which supposedly stopped like a generation after the Trojan war.   There were three explanations I can recall.    All the heroes and demigods died in the Trojan war. We are now living in the rubbish final age, the gods have spurned us. We now have the tools survive and to govern ourselves without a need for the gods to interfere. Like, even if Athena has to tell you what to do constantly, eventually you know what to do. But this ignores the part where the gods would interfere for other reasons. The gods saw what a bummer their taking sides made the Trojan war and decided to lay off.   Some other stuff about the gods being part of the universe and about what being a god might be like.   They make some rules but they don't make The Rules, and they didn't create the universe (and sometimes the force they have mastery over is also a god from an previous generation???). The gods are still subject to Fate (which idk if the triple goddess in their myths had the will to dictate or just had to dictate but w/e).   Odysseus is mad Athena didn't help him. But she is like ""Well you know how Poseidon gets, and what's 10 years anyway?"" because 10 years is nothing to an immortal but to Odysseus it was everything.  And dudes Aphrodite was into, they just won't stop being slain or dying because  ¯\(ツ)/¯ mortals.  The third generation of Greek gods had lots of human qualities. It makes sense that they would get hurt. And maybe it makes sense that they would learn to keep their distance and avoid heartache and strife.  I think a lot of that stuff was good and worth thinking about in a more general context of a pantheon of anthropomorphic gods with human motivations (like the 3d gen Greek gods)."
