Lettering,3e2h92,twothumbswayup,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:23:59 2015 UTC,"any thoughts on improvements? Pumping out a few similarly themed pieces over the next month or so, and any advice is good advice."
Lettering,3e2h92,DetEndeloseSvart,2,Tue Jul 21 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"The GY!BE quote is a little tough to make out on the ribbon. I would suggest eschewing the ""this is a real ribbon flapping in the wind"" look, and go for the more decorative way, where there are words in places where they're visible, and the rest is more flowy. (Assuming full legibility is a concern or desire)  Cool drawing, though. The Sanborn text fits it well."
Lettering,3e2h92,skrism,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:57:20 2015 UTC,Thanks for taking the time to comment. I was torn on the ribbon thing. I wanted it to look real but also surreal in that it would be flowing the wrong direction compared to the travel of the motorcycle but definitely lost some of the legibility. I'll probably plan a little better on the next piece if a similar situation crops up. Thanks again.
Lettering,3e2h92,pinksquid,3,Tue Jul 21 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"I like the ribbon the way it is, for sure.  you can make out enough of it to understand it.  I enjoy the realism of it more."

You're more than welcome to give friendly advice and constructive criticism, but try changing the tone in which you write. Speaking of which, I have some feedback and tips for you to practice.  Try not using offensive or obscene words to make your point. Whilst I get that it makes you feel big and tough, it really just makes you sound like an angry meathead who can't manage his temper.  Instead of ""if ur not gon do dis da way I said lazt tiem..."" Try; ""Hi there, just a friendly reminder to try x and y. This will seriously help in completing the outcome"".   I'm seeing way too many internet bullies carrying on about how people don't listen to their feedback and how perfect it was. Try shifting tone and encourage them to do it. Even if you don't feel that way.  For example, I don't give a shit if you hate what I've written, but I've done it in a nice, non-threatening way.  Good day, Sir."

Lettering,3drpb4,thatseika,2,Sat Jul 18 20:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm not much of a letter,  but you're at a good start! My only concern is that your letters don't look free flowing. Are you going back over something after you've written it? Are you writing each stroke of the letter fully with out stopping? Stop that! I usually write each letter of the word I want individually and decide how I want it to look. Then connect them. And then correct it. You'll be writing one word 100 times. Still like lettering?? Good!"
Lettering,3drpb4,ajuju,2,Sat Jul 18 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"Welcome! That's a Pentel Brush Pen isn't it? I've had a lot of practice with those and they're probably the hardest one to learn with, but it's doable! They're hard because the brush is so long that it makes it difficult to get consistent line thicknesses.  Here's my takeaways from what you've got on insta already. It looks like you're really carefully trying to draw the letters and going back over them. With that sort of pen, the good stuff comes from the natural flow of the line and the thickness you give to each line, and the positioning. I've had a quick go at some of your words to give you an idea. I just do this for fun as well but hopefully you can get something from it.   http://imgur.com/zy2WthA http://imgur.com/ilKObOA (Canny! is my favourite one)"
Lettering,3do2ua,oxygenvoyage,10,Fri Jul 17 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"I did this about a year ago. Until then I never realized how much influence tracking had on the look of my handwriting. After making the typeface, I opened InDesign and started typing in my new personal font, but it looked nothing like my handwriting. then I slowly started adjusting the tracking, and after one specific click it instantly looked like my I wrote it myself. So this works really well for me since I write in all caps, but it would be pretty useless in a program where you can't adjust tracking. One thing it's missing, though, is ligatures. There are some unique letter combinations I combine into one motion. What would be incredibly cool is if this program would analyze the ligatures you write and determine the tracking based on that."

I'm pretty happy I have found some cheap brush pens cause they are way simpler to use. I have some Faber Castell PITT artist pens and a Copic Ciao. I feel copic markers are way more durable and refillable which is a huge plus, however I like the thickness of the Faber Castell (they are way thinner) but they can't be refilled and I also have the feeling the tip wears off pretty fast!

BUT, your main problem is not eraser type but the lead you're using. The pencil you used is either too soft or you were pressing down to hard. You really can't go wrong with a good (or cheap lol) mechanical pencil. But you can't bear down too hard with those either because no matter how good your eraser, the lead will score the paper.

Lettering,3c4ykm,xac1d,4,Sun Jul 5 00:24:43 2015 UTC,"honestly, I just got the pen yesterday.. I'm still trying to tame it. People tell you to move from your shoulder, and its really unnatural feeling at first.. but if you combine it with up and down finger movements, its actually kinda legit. be gentle with it, go slower than you think you should. Up strokes work better when I go faster with them though. and obviously like everyone says, write a fuck ton. just write nonsense for an hour, you'll get the feel for it."
Lettering,3c4ykm,xac1d,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:09:48 2015 UTC,"Is this generally the same as your normal handwriting? Because i've been playing with mine and it's so far just me writing with a marker. With he nibs on let's say the parallel, the finer strokes were done automatically much of the time, with this it seems much harder as you always have to control the pressure."
Lettering,3c4ykm,p44v9n,2,Sun Jul 5 19:56:39 2015 UTC,"my normal handwriting is much tighter than this is.. I filled up like 5 pages of nonsense before I got this kind of result. I read up on some brush lettering tips, learned a bit about how they work, watched a bunch of videos/gifs of people using these pens, etc.   Pressure control is the name on the game with brush lettering, harder on the down stroke, light on the up stroke. The Pentel Pocket Brush is what I used for this, and that tip is super soft, so theres greater variation between thicks and thins, and I think it lends itself to more loose fluid scripts.. but the softness also makes it harder to control, especially from the shoulder. I also bought some Tombow Fudenosuke pens the same day, both hard and soft tips, and I found those to be much easier to control. The tips are shorter and more firm, even the soft one.. so the thins are more normal pressure, and the thicks are made by really pushing it down. The tips don't fray even when I push hard, so thats pretty neat. They're better for small format stuff, the results tend to be tighter. but I'd recommend them to get your hand familiar with how brush lettering works. You can only get them online as far as I know, but they're relatively cheap on amazon.   **edit, all of that to say, I really dont know what Im doing yet, but thats what Ive discovered in the past 2 days  Hope that helps!"

(A few screenshots to go with this explanation below can be seen here)   I started with a layer that just laid out where I wanted the letter placement.  Then figured out how I could lay out a pattern of multiple colors without any of them touching or being directly next to each other in a way that was distracting. Finally, broke out the good old pen tool and went to town.  Once the design was complete I printed it at a local letterpress shop. I talked more about that process here."

To have a piece use this many different styles means that it would need to have a strong hierarchy, so when you're starting, it's best to try to focus on one style and keep the composition simple until you start to understand a bit more about what other styles might do, and how to structure the piece to suit different styles."

I'm trying to do some ""basics"" lettering for a photo album. I don't think I'll manage to do something really fancy but I'm trying to do some ""simple & clean"".  If you have some time, feel free to comment on this first try. (Thank you if you do)  For what I know now, it's probably unbalanced. I should emphase more on ""East Coast"" so maybe make a ""3 weeks"" less present.  The second try is a bit too bold and more heading to an old english alphabet I guess.  And the ""3"" is ugly."

Not much there yet, so can't give you the feedback you want. Do you plan on focusing on something particular, like interviews or lessons? I ask because there are blog posts on the main page, but I couldn't find a button to get to the blog itself. Also, the ""Styles"" really need some examples."

Lettering,38cso4,redkiwi100,3,Wed Jun 3 13:48:48 2015 UTC,Interesting project! I did something similar as part of my uni course a few years ago. we had to produce a 20 page book using just the words of the song/poem. here was my attempt. It shouldn't be too hard to re-work into a poster if you like the look of it.
Lettering,38cso4,redkiwi100,1 point,Wed Jun 3 13:54:27 2015 UTC,"Some great stuff there.  The New York / Northern Cali part is a stand-out page.  You have obviously understood well the poetic repetition within the text and found your own rhythm which doesn't precisely match the way it was read out in the recording.  I'm a fan.  I don't know about 're-work' though, as the impact of the individual spreads is going to be very different when they're all on one big sheet together.  The SCARES motif for example might be hard to pull off - where would the edge be?"
Lettering,38cso4,Jackbo,1 point,Wed Jun 3 14:41:12 2015 UTC,Thankyou! Yeah i think it would need quite a bit of tweaking to fit into a poster - maybe loose some of the features that only really work in a book format.
Lettering,38cso4,PulsatingRamen,2,Thu Jun 4 12:05:00 2015 UTC,"What an interesting project. It sounds like it's going to be a very nice gift for those who receive it.  I have a few concerns about it, however. The piece you linked is made of typography rather than hand lettering, and to do a whole piece in lettering of this size would be much harder than arranging some typed up words. The choice, then, must be between typography and lettering. Another option is calligraphy.  For the typographic route, you would need someone who is comfortable with Illustrator or Photoshop to put the pieces together, which is different from most of the work posted to this subreddit. For the lettering route, you would need someone who satisfies 3 criteria:   Be willing to work for 75c a word Be able to work fast enough to make 75c a word a worthwhile use of their time Be able to make something that is good while working at this speed   The problem here is that someone who can produce good work at this speed will most likely have great skill in lettering and wouldn't be willing to work for 75c a word. This situation is similar to the old design maxim that you can choose any two from the following, but not all three: good, fast, cheap.  The final option is to have the piece done in calligraphy. Calligraphy is much faster to produce than lettering, but I don't know if you would be happy having a piece done in calligraphy, or if you had your heart set on typography or lettering. When considering the cost of calligraphy, it depends a lot on the script you want and the skill of the calligrapher. Some scripts are much more difficult and time consuming than others, and, as with anything, skilled calligraphers will charge more than amateur ones. Depending on the specifics of the project, the cost could vary greatly. I won't speak for other calligraphers as to whether 75c a word matches their rates or not, but when it comes to lettering, I think that you might be hard pressed to find what your after.  Hopefully you will find someone who is well versed in the digital side of things who can take on the project from a typographical standpoint."
Lettering,38cso4,austincedwardsdesign,2,Wed Jun 3 14:06:44 2015 UTC,"Great points; perhaps I'm in the wrong subreddit.  However, /r/typography seems to be more interested in font forms and technical questions of ligature usage than creating complete pieces of typographical art. /r/calligraphy is flooded with amazingly steady-handed people who create beautiful short phrases but doesn't have the layout design work that I see here.  So I hear you, but it was a considered decision to ask here.  As I said in the original post, I'm absolutely not expecting 670 hand-drawn words but it does seem to me that the artistic skills on display in /r/lettering are a great match for what I'm looking to achieve.  I'd much rather have a trained chef plan my menu, even if he's not grating the cheese himself."

Lettering,384ram,MaBa37,7,Mon Jun 1 21:10:57 2015 UTC,"hey dude, I reckon your work is awesome and you have a lot of potential.  I think to improve you may want to focus a bit more on your straight letter work, just to improve the overall consistency and feel of the pieces.   I understand you're probably going for the hand drawn look, but more clean letters can certainly help to bring a piece together more.   For instance the word 'people' in the middle piece, and 'remember' & 'journey' on the left could all be improved upon in terms of their consistency, just to bring it all together a bit.   as an example of what i mean, this piece is hand drawn, but the letters all look very consistent, which leads to a very well put together piece.   I hope you don't mid the criticism, your pieces are very well done and your layouts are awesome.   keep up the good work dude."
Lettering,384ram,remsone,4,Tue Jun 2 05:52:54 2015 UTC,"Hey dude, thank you for that.  I totally understand why there's no real consistency in remember r journey.  How can I improve the consistency in people though?"
Lettering,384ram,remsone,2,Tue Jun 2 06:17:04 2015 UTC,"Maiinly just keeping the line weights and sizes of the letters really similar, keeping all angles at as close to 90 degrees as possible when applicable etc."
