seaporn,3dg5dd,im_Clueless_Its_True,2,Thu Jul 16 07:17:33 2015 UTC,"The previous wave washes back into the sea and runs into an incoming wave creating a backwash wave, I think."
seaporn,3dg5dd,aspiramedia,2,Thu Jul 16 09:56:05 2015 UTC,If the surf is running strong like this the bigger wave will run into the sea wall or sand berm and form an actual wave going back out to sea. Usually it's angled and this collision explosion will run down the beach as hits the incoming waves.

seaporn,3ajjhx,surfnaked,2,Sun Jun 21 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"This is cool.  I have two friends in real life that tell me the truth like this.  Didn't see the reef, thanks.  I'm from Utah, haven't got much ocean time, but want to ride a nice wave before I die.  With the knowledge you just have me, maybe I don't die on that wave..  :)"
seaporn,3ajjhx,yeomanpharmer,2,Tue Jun 23 06:24:48 2015 UTC,"Sure. Just kind of a rule of thumb, the steepest nicest waves generally are going to be breaking in pretty shallow water. That's what makes it work. The swell comes out of deeper water and hits the shallow water of the reef, rock, or sand bottom and jumps up and out and breaks in that beautiful wave shape. The shape is determined by the formation of the bottom. Ideally the bottom is going to be angled so the wave doesn't break all at once, but it peels down the reef like the wave in the picture. The better the shape of the bottom the better the wave. But that's the rule: the steeper and hollower the wave; the shallower and more sketchy the bottom.   Also before you go out anywhere new, please please check out the situation thoroughly. Us locals hate peeling your ass off the bottom because you didn't know what you were getting into."

seaporn,3770n7,joenottoast,3,Mon May 25 16:22:23 2015 UTC,"Even at it's worse, there was never a ""We may not survive this"" feeling. For the most part, everything was ops normal, but more vomit. And this wasn't even the worse that we saw that patrol. There were concerns for those out on the deck, but when those concerns arose, the CO secured the weather decks (basically no one goes out). But it was actually easier for those at the helm as they could see the horizon. That's the key. When you feel sea sick, put your eyes on the horizon as it gives you a sense of stability and  your body can acclimate."

It looks like it should be awash in surf instead of having a sharp, clean edge on the bottom because the perspective makes it look like it should descend into the water.

seaporn,31dw7q,anchorage1,5,Sat Apr 4 03:29:24 2015 UTC,"The Farallons are a group of small, rocky islands, a little over 20 miles off the closest point on the California coast.  Off limits to the general public, they are a sanctuary for birds and seals.  When you are on the mainland and close to sea level, the islands are below the horizon, but from higher elevations they are often visible in the distance.  This photo shows the view from Point Reyes on a particularly clear day.  One can even see the surf break on the rock island shores.  On the western end there is a big rock arch with an 70 foot high opening.  In order to make the picture even clearer than what one would have seen through a pair of binoculars, a polarizer was used to suppress some of the atmospheric haze, 10 separate exposures were averaged to increase the signal-to-noise ratio, and most of the remaining haze was removed digitally."

I'd say if you want anything from outside the islands you'll be paying through the ass for it, though, so let's say that $30,000 income will keep you alive and in decent shape but not much beyond that.  On the downside, you'll have to deal with 351,000 tourists every year and only 37% of the population having internet connectivity.

seaporn,2z59jk,8draco8,2,Sun Mar 15 23:34:22 2015 UTC,"That's just it.  Imagine you are out at sea, floating on a raft and suddenly the sky darkens and the water becomes black, violent and consuming. You are powerless to paddle back to shore as the waves overtake your raft and you are plunged into the depths of the ocean.  No matter how hard you swim, everytime you near the surface, another wave sucks you back under.  The ocean is full of boulders and rocks, and the waves around you are breaking over them, pulling and pushing you closer and closer to them as you helplessly try to swim away from them.  I've literally had nightmares about this type of oceanic death."

seaporn,2vfsdn,bmxkeeler,2,Wed Feb 11 14:04:43 2015 UTC,Dumb question here but once those rocks slowly degrade with the Atlantic and Caribbean just be the same ocean?
seaporn,2vfsdn,bmxkeeler,7,Wed Feb 11 14:27:54 2015 UTC,"Theoretically, yes.  But actually, the Bahamas are built up on a carbonate platform called the Great Bahama bank.  So this island, Eleuthera actually has quite a bit of elevation built up above sea level.  Even if the entire cliff above sea level is eroded away, the entire platform acts as a giant barrier.  The mean depth of the platform is about 10-20m whereas the atlantic side drops off super quick from ~100m to 1000s of meters.  It's this major difference in depths that causes the colors of the two water bodies to be vastly different."

seaporn,2vfsdn,notmyselftoday,5,Wed Feb 11 16:02:02 2015 UTC,"Well, the distinction between a ""sea"" and an ""ocean"" is quite fuzzy already. The Caribbean is directly connected to the Atlantic in quite a number of places as it is -- compare this to the Mediterranean Sea, which connects to the Atlantic at exactly one point, namely the Straits of Gibraltar.  The Caribbean is considered to be a distinct sea mainly because there are a good number of islands and island chains separating it from the Atlantic and creating local conditions (currents, etc.) that are sufficiently different from the rest of the North Atlantic to justify a unique designation. And also, I'm sure, quite a bit of nautical tradition.  So, basically, a lot more would have to change for the Caribbean to lose its oceanographic status as a sea than just these rocks wearing away.  On top of which, as far as I can tell, the Bahamas aren't technically considered to be a boundary of the Caribbean Sea in the first place. The official boundary is defined to be significantly further south, at Cuba.  Sources: Wikipedia, basically"
seaporn,2vfsdn,notmyselftoday,5,Wed Feb 11 14:58:07 2015 UTC,Correct.  Bahamas are basically the Northeastern Boundary of the Caribbean.  The Bahamas do act as a barrier island system however.  You can see the effect of that in this photo where the high energy waves of the Atlantic are dissapating on the island and keeping the sea west of there calm.  This is the reason why we don't have surfable waves where I'm at in Miami. I'm a Ph.D student studying the cave systems in the Bahamas so I'm happy to answer any geological questions.

I'm conflicted, because I love beachcombing so much that I made a subreddit about it (please join!). I often keep the things that I find, using the justification that they will likely otherwise just get buried or destroyed.  It's one thing to keep a solitary shell, piece of glass, or shard of pottery, but in this case the glass has actually become a substantial part of the local landscape, which makes it a shame to alter it IMO.  It feels strange to be arguing in favour of ""leave no trace"" ethics regarding something that is technically garbage, but that's my two-cents."

In the early 20th century, Fort Bragg residents threw their household garbage over cliffs owned by the Union Lumber Company onto what is now Glass Beach, discarding glass, appliances, and even vehicles. Locals referred to it as ""The Dumps."" Fires were lit to reduce the size of the trash pile.  The California State Water Resources Control Board and city leaders closed the area in 1967. Various cleanup programs were undertaken through the years to correct the damage. Over the next several decades the pounding waves cleaned the beach, by breaking down everything but glass and pottery and tumbling those into the small, smooth, colored pieces that cover Glass Beach."

seaporn,2kgjy6,lafferty__daniel,3,Tue Oct 28 01:15:55 2014 UTC,"Thanks :) It's hard to take bad photos when you are in a place like that. Not a stupid question, there is a sandbar on the right at low tide which you can walk/wade across. I think one can swim too, see the deeper blue shade in the water? There were lots of lots of fish in there, I don't know what kind but they scared me so I didn't snorkel too far - I was alone and have an irrational fear of something coming to bite me in the water (thanks Jaws!) even though I was told there is no sharks in the lagoon."

seaporn,2iltab,stanglee,6,Wed Oct 8 04:20:28 2014 UTC,How is the palm tree in the foreground standing still while the vortex has enough rotational energy to lift that much water?  Shouldn't there be a ton of wind?
seaporn,2iltab,lenaxia,6,Wed Oct 8 05:35:05 2014 UTC,"That's why Florida has so many palm trees.  They are naturally resilient to wind and will sometimes be the only thing left standing after a hurricane or tornado.  They have a giant rootball instead of long shallow branching roots that anchors them really well, plus they don't have a massive canopy like an oak tree or even pine tree, they just have that lil pineapple top.  The big giant canopies have strong branches that can catch the wind more and bring those big trees down, whereas the palm tree's branches are very very flexible and just blow around.  Even the trunk itself is considerably springy and flexible, instead of resisting and snapping."
seaporn,2iltab,gsav55,3,Wed Oct 8 13:57:05 2014 UTC,I have no clue. At my house which is about a quarter mile up the road it was incredibly windy.
seaporn,2iltab,stanglee,5,Wed Oct 8 06:14:51 2014 UTC,Can someone explain to me what's going on? If I were to swim out directly under a waterspout what would happen? Does the water go up? I assume if it went down you'd just get crushed by water pressure?
seaporn,2iltab,Verbind,6,Tue Oct 7 23:53:26 2014 UTC,Looks more like a tornado touching the the water. With that said you will most likely get sucked up and/or thrown.
seaporn,2iltab,SHoNGBC,3,Wed Oct 8 00:21:19 2014 UTC,"I doubt that you could even get directly under it yourself.  But if you were scuba diving you would probably be alright, as it is a wind phenomenon that mostly affects the surface."

seaporn,2d8t2b,TommBomBadil,1 point,Tue Aug 12 15:58:57 2014 UTC,"The Bunda Cliffs are part of a larger scarp of the Eucla Basin that spreads across the south eastern corner of Western Australia and the far western part of South Australia  The Bunda cliffs is an aboriginal name [1] which has been used in South Australia for the name of the Nullarbor coastal cliffs. The usage is not included in national geographic name databases - but the usage is general in South Australia [2] [3]  The Bunda cliffs extend for around 100 km along the Great Australian Bight near its northern extremity and are close to the Nullarbor Plain in a very sparsely settled area of Australia.  The cliffs, which are some 60 to 120 metres high and sheer, can be viewed from several viewing points along the Eyre Highway east of Eucla and west of Nullarbor roadhouse, although could be better appreciated from the air. A view of the cliffs can be had at 31°57′0″S 130°14′0″E.  Geologically the cliffs are of Tertiary age and are composed of fossiliferous limestone. The same formation can be seen from Eucla to Madura, where it forms a scarp separating the Roe Plain from the Hampton Tableland, but in this section the coastline has moved away from the cliffs. The scarp in this area runs parallel to, and within sight of, the Eyre Highway.  'Baxter Cliffs' is located at [4] while the name Bunda is not found at the Geosciences Australia website at all, however Bunda Plateau is found as an alternative name for the Nullarbor Plain on the South Australian side of the Nullarbor Plain [5]"

I took some other long exposures during that roadtrip (both Rialto and Ruby Beach) - you can check them out here: https://www.flickr.com/photos/lukemeup/sets/72157645481590875/. cheers. :)

It's an absolute blast of a dive, and a perfect playground for divers of all abilities.  The outer wall is what's called a ""drift dive"", where we just rode the current along the vertical cliff (it would be impossible to swim against, so once we were in it, we just had to literally go with the flow).  It's a totally different kind of experience, particularly because I couldn't help but to look out and down into nothingness and realize how exposed I was to the vastness of the ocean.  It was very fun, but equally terrifying.  TL;DR  I'm very happy to have done both, but if I had to choose one over the other, it would be the interior."

seaporn,1uawdq,TheGreatCthulhu,2,Fri Jan 3 09:46:08 2014 UTC,"Why two years? Ireland's Copper Coast faces south-south-east. The worst conditions on the coast are a big South-easterly that will blow for 24 hours or more, and also the rarest, as the prevailing wind is south-westerly. I needed the storm max to happen during light, on a high spring tide and then there was finding the right location to be directly into the wind. I took this shot 18 months ago, and similar conditions haven't happened yet.   This shot was taken from the same place at a different angle and gives a better idea of swell size, which was big, but wasn't huge, about 5/6 metres, but in the main picture the storm force winds were flattening the surface."

seaporn,1u8u9n,unknown_name,1 point,Thu Jan 2 19:08:19 2014 UTC,"I did, but was unclear which one was the first. There was an Imgur link among the results that was posted to /r/pics and the only one of its resolution, so I submitted that one."
seaporn,1u8u9n,unknown_name,1 point,Thu Jan 2 19:11:20 2014 UTC,"If you sort by oldest it pulls up an Amazon link. The pic is actually from a book sold on Amazon. In this case its a crappy resolution. So hosting on imgur is ok, just credit the source in a comment. In this case, the link takes you to his book."
