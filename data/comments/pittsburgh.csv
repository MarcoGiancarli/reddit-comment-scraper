pittsburgh,3e2k8z,sbb1993,4,Tue Jul 21 15:47:58 2015 UTC,Air Force 2 is based off a 757 and would have no issues.   Air Force 1 is based off a much bigger 747.
pittsburgh,3e2k8z,TheTraut88,3,Tue Jul 21 15:23:39 2015 UTC,"Also modified to hell, adding a lot more weight."
pittsburgh,3e2k8z,burritoace,2,Tue Jul 21 15:53:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm aware of that, just throwing out some marginally related information. It sounds like the President only flies AF2 on very limited occasions, but I thought it was interesting that they seemed to be practicing for flights into the County Airport.  Edit to add: Just out of curiosity, would it be possible to land or take off in 6500 feet under ideal conditions? I'd love to see footage of a 747 taking off from a tiny airport."
pittsburgh,3e2k8z,bobzach,7,Tue Jul 21 15:32:22 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is impossible for the President to fly in Air Force Two, because any Air Force plane the President is on has the call sign Air Force One by virtue of his/her presence.  If either of the two planes people usually refer to as ""Air Force One"" had the Vice President on it and not the President, it would be called Air Force Two, because that's the call sign of any Air Force vehicle whose highest ranking passenger is the Vice President."
pittsburgh,3e2k8z,burritoace,3,Tue Jul 21 15:55:45 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, I remember reading this. I was referring to the 757 rather than the 747, which typically has the call sign Air Force 2. I wonder if this name change ever causes problems with ATC."
pittsburgh,3e2k8z,bobzach,4,Tue Jul 21 16:29:25 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing it doesn't cause any problems, because probably every ATC who gets AF1 or AF2 talking to them was already expecting to be in contact with them days in advance.  There's an interesting tidbit that when Nixon was flying back home to California, he was midair over Missouri at the moment Ford actually assumed the office of the presidency back in D.C. The pilot of AF1 apparently requested a call sign change midair to a new one, SAM 27000 (SAM is Special Air Mission), to reflect that the President was no longer on board.

pittsburgh,3e2k8z,ChefGuru,0,Tue Jul 21 16:00:27 2015 UTC,"Technically ""Air Force 1"" is the call sign for the airplane that the president is currently riding on, not the name of a specific vehicle (although, it's become common to refer to those vehicles by the call sign they're most often used for.)

IIRC, burgers/sandwiches are around $10-12 and other entrees are $15-18, so I think it's pretty average.  It's not at the top of my list by any means but it's not a bad place, and sitting by the open windows is pretty nice IMO."

Obviously they have other drinks which is not the point, the point is that if one of the worst beers is $4 or so then that indicates the prices of the rest of their products and also means that's the minimum you're going to be spending per beer if you go. Perhaps some people, including maybe OP would rather pay less than that which seems like relevant information.  ""Similar to anything in the city"" would mean it is similar to places in Shadyside or Southside. I know that those prices are not similar to other Lawrenceville locations like Gus' or Remedy or Belvedere's(when it was open) who have much cheaper prices than Industry especially if you're drinking PBR or Yuengling or something of that sort.

And a lot of those people aren't very cultured.   Kind of why I like it here.

pittsburgh,3dz46e,techmattr,7,Tue Jul 21 00:57:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there are reviews and posts all over the internet from people who bought puppies there only to discover they had serious medical problems.

pittsburgh,3dz46e,foulmouthangel,6,Tue Jul 21 12:04:21 2015 UTC,"This gets me too. Why on earth would anyone buy a pet there when it's widely known that these type of stores often get animals from mills or other sub-standard places? There are three large animal shelters in Pittsburgh, there are breed rescue organizations, and there are reputable breeders that can easily be found online.   It is just too easy to get a dog or cat from reputable places. I cannot understand why anyone would pay thousands for an animal from these types of stores."
pittsburgh,3dz46e,5centgirl,4,Tue Jul 21 12:52:56 2015 UTC,My dad got our dog in the early 1990s from a private breeder. I don't think she was running an operation but I think he went because he was looking for a specific breed and this was before the Internet.  And my best friends family breed their dog twice because I guess they wanted to show their kids the experience of puppies being born or something. They sold the dogs too but I don't think they were trying to profit.   I agree everyone should check the shelters first before ever buying private in general. Breeders shouldn't be profiting when other dogs can't find homes.  And puppy mills should not be a thing today.
pittsburgh,3dz46e,Cainga,2,Tue Jul 21 13:22:18 2015 UTC,Because people don't do their homework. Usually people going to a pet store are doing it on impulse.

The way he carried himself and talked to me almost seemed as if he was trying to sell himself to me instead of the dog. Convenient to make this comment now, but it's the truth."

As soon as I showed any interest in the bird, they introduced me to the owner. Very creepy person and very pushy. I think the way you put it is perfect, he's selling himself, not the animals. Without me even prompting, he started to talk about a lot of the negative press they had gotten recently and how it's not true and that they take great care of their animals. Such bullshit. Just look at the poor fellows. I went home and started to read reviews then chose to never go back. I still wonder what happened with Arty."

Went in exactly once, because my dog was low on food and it was the closest place listed on the manufacturer's site (we were getting it online). I felt so bad for the puppies stuck in glass boxes, and some looked terribly sickly and the breeds I'm familiar with looked obviously puppy mill. The kittens didn't look much better. I ended up leaving in a hurry, without the food, and my dog got a new food that day. I wanted to spring all of the poor critters. I've never been back there since."

pittsburgh,3dztnv,megsbenny,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:42:10 2015 UTC,Ah! I did this same idea for Schenley Plaza during the spring semester at Pitt. It's so much fun! I'll definitely try this one out next chance I get.

pittsburgh,3dyrax,mankoge,6,Mon Jul 20 17:00:49 2015 UTC,"A 14 comment thread entirely collapsed, chalk another one up for the denizens of r/coontown.  Typically, residents love permit parking, and businesses and commuters hate it.   Should a business owner be responsible for providing parking for customers and employees, or should the residents of the neighborhood take the hit?  Does it matter whether the neighbors patronize the business or wish it would go away?   Should condo towers be permitted with fewer on-site spaces than units, where parking is tight?   To really liven it up, should parking be permitted where it makes car/bike co-existence especially problematic?   Should drivers be told eff off: we're making it 60 minutes to traverse 15 blocks in the east end, and you can't park within 10 blocks of any destination within that area?   Should a property three street-spaces wide be allowed to rent to 8 car owners?   Should a resident be able to leave a car in the same (street) spot for two months without moving?  Funny thing about Melwood from the garage to the end - there aren't a lot of houses, and most of the businesses don't have retail traffic. I'm guessing the businesses feel the same way a lot of residents do, but unlike the umpteen residents on the other side of Melwood, they've got the political pull and organization to get a permit zone.  Edit: scratch that last, it's only the very end of Melwood going permit."

pittsburgh,3dyrax,hooch,5,Tue Jul 21 13:09:41 2015 UTC,"The fuck?  It's not meant to keep riff raff away, it's meant to limit parking to non-residents so that people who live there can actually park."

pittsburgh,3dyrax,mod_juliet13,4,Mon Jul 20 21:28:27 2015 UTC,How are they parking illegally if the street used to be non permitted? This is a great way to put the Melwood screening room out if business and keep all future business away. Enjoy your island of isolation with no drive for other people to move to that area.

pittsburgh,3dz9km,cmc8290,6,Mon Jul 20 19:06:51 2015 UTC,"I went to Circolo twice for drinks.  I liked it.  I never had a pizza, but it looked good.  I wonder why they would give up after only 6 months."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,PierogiPowered,7,Mon Jul 20 19:30:38 2015 UTC,"Pizza was OK.  Inconsistent would be the best way to describe it.  Supposedly the chef spent 3 years perfecting the recipe... but it never seemed to come out of the wood oven the same way twice.  Prices were a bit high - $18 for a pizza that's barely shareable for 2, $12 for a glass of wine that's from a $14 bottle at the liquor store...   I've heard everything from poor bookkeeping to liquor license issues are to blame.  Nothing has come from the horse's mouth though so your guess is as good as mine."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,tonytroz,3,Mon Jul 20 20:30:45 2015 UTC,"I heard liquor license problems as well, but you really nailed it with the pricing. You can get away with that stuff if you run a small, exclusive restaurant like Dish. You can't afford to run three of them in the same place and ignore the crowd that show up for specials."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,primusperegrinus,3,Tue Jul 21 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"That's way too much for pizza. $12 glass of wine is New York prices, too!"
pittsburgh,3dz9km,slavicswimmer,3,Tue Jul 21 02:29:13 2015 UTC,"I'm curious if many Pittsburghers besides college students go to the Southside, or if lots of them are people from further outside town. The weird demographic environment might be part of the explanation, but the money issues seem to be pretty central as well."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,slavicswimmer,5,Tue Jul 21 00:14:23 2015 UTC,Definitely didn't help their case when they said they weren't catering to that kind of crowd... Resulting in very few specials to avoid attracting riff raff
pittsburgh,3dz9km,tonytroz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:12 2015 UTC,"That explains it. They should have just opened in any other city neighborhood then... well, stinks for their investors."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,AdamSocial,7,Tue Jul 21 00:34:10 2015 UTC,"It's not the neighborhood that's the problem. Plenty of fairly high-end restaurants exist in south side and don't cater to the drinking crowd like Stagioni, Dish, and Mallorca/Ibiza. There are also plenty of bars that could exist in Shadyside like Urban Tap, Local, and Steel Cactus (which already does).  The problem is they just tried to do too much. A $1M restaurant with a huge staff isn't the way to run an exclusive restaurant/bar."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,Nature_gang,4,Tue Jul 21 03:36:13 2015 UTC,"The college crowd is typically contained to a handful of bars:  Rowdy Buck, Diesel, Mario's, Carson City.  If it's particularly busy, they'll drift into The Flats or Local.    Unless they're underage.  Then they go to Charlie Murdoch's or Tad's.  Also, if you don't like that crowd, avoid Hofbrauhaus on Thursdays."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,slavicswimmer,4,Tue Jul 21 02:52:35 2015 UTC,There are actually quite a few upscale blocks in the south side.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,AdamSocial,2,Tue Jul 21 01:04:45 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. I love everything about the neighborhood, except the drunken scene that comes out of nowhere on the weekends."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,montani,5,Tue Jul 21 02:22:18 2015 UTC,It doesn't come out of nowhere.  It comes out of Oakland.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,AdamSocial,3,Tue Jul 21 02:50:53 2015 UTC,..and it's been doing that for 20 years.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,montani,2,Tue Jul 21 12:22:18 2015 UTC,"If I were a rich man, I'd open about 6 bars in Oakland, hire a competent staff, and then sit back and collect.  It'd clean up the South Side and clean up my bank account."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,bzungali,2,Tue Jul 21 14:50:50 2015 UTC,Once I hit about 28 I stopped going to the Southside unless it was a Sunday afternoon.  Just the parking situation is enough to keep me away.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,newguy1787,2,Tue Jul 21 14:38:42 2015 UTC,The pizza was pretty wonderful to be honest... This amazes me how fast this closed down.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,MootSuit,2,Mon Jul 20 20:53:59 2015 UTC,"I liked the one white pizza that was topped with like, 5 artisan cheeses. Except for when they started serving it with a hefty drizzle of balsamic glaze. That shit was on everything."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,montani,2,Mon Jul 20 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, it was a cash issue.  The plan never was to spend over a million, the original budget was just under 700k and they thought this was going to be a huge hit out of the gate.  There was talk of bringing in one or two other investors but the current couldn't agree on terms."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,burritoace,2,Mon Jul 20 23:48:28 2015 UTC,"Not surprised at all. Realistically, I don't think a Pizza joint is going to garner a huge crowd, even if its upscale. I mean there are so many other places with more complex foods that those would ""steal"" the crowd willing to pay for ""premium"" pizza."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,The_Year_of_Glad,2,Tue Jul 21 11:55:47 2015 UTC,Proper and Il Pizziolo disagree with you.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,burritoace,2,Tue Jul 21 12:23:06 2015 UTC,and Piccolo Forno. But maybe Pittsburgh only has the carrying capacity for 3 nicer pizza places.
pittsburgh,3dz9km,eightclicknine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:34:31 2015 UTC,"Piccolo Forno has a lot more than just pizza, though."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,Pool_of_gravy,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:00:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, all the places mentioned also serve pasta and stuff but their primary marketing is around pizza."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,Simmion,2,Tue Jul 21 15:06:00 2015 UTC,"I've never been here, but it just looked expensive from the outside.   Its not that I am cheap, I prefer to be frugal when I can. If I know that I can pay a similar price and get a better value elsewhere, I will do that. Judging by the comments here, it looks like I made a good call; especially since I don't even like pizza. I'm looking forward to see what will show up in the space next."
pittsburgh,3dz9km,alwayshigh08,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:55:09 2015 UTC,It never seemed particularly busy whenever I've been in it.  But it was also never empty either.  I would have bet on a lot of southside eateries closing before circolo.
