The mods there shut down their sub so they could figure out how to run it without Victoria's help from reddit HQ. This is a really popular sub that is run by people in their spare time and without getting paid. So they were understandably upset when reddit fired an employee, without notice, that makes one of the most popular pages run.   The mods are also ticked that the tools used to actually moderate pages on reddit suck (they do) and that reddit HQ doesn't seem to care or listen to their concerns.   Other subreddit mods then showed their support for IAmA and themselves by going ""dark"" as well, at least for a little while.   The mods of these big subreddits really play a big part in what content is shared and viewed on the biggest parts of reddit. And these page views are then shared all over, generating lots of ad mo eye and web traffic for tons of people, including CNN and HuffingtonPost and IFLS, etc. so they are upset that they do this for free, it earns lots of money for other people, and yet their requests and opinions go not only ignored, but not even acknowledged by reddit HQ."

I just fear that when people push back against a wrong, they always push in a polarized way. To fight over-sexualization people sometimes stigmatized sexual things.

Bergeron is one of my favorite players on the team because even when he didn't score (which unfortunately happened a lot during this season) he was still a huge factor on the ice because of his defensive skill.

This is probably just because it was moving in a circular path so fast that you saw the path it was taking or something to that effect. It reminds me of sparklers when you move them fast you see the lines of light instead of the one point
PhascinatingPhysics,3aif9g,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Sun Jun 21 03:35:47 2015 UTC,"This is because of how cameras work.  Essentially, it takes a finite amount of time for film to register the image.  The amount of time it takes depends on the type of film and how much light there is.  The more light, the less time it takes for the film to register the image.    So if something is going really fast, by the time the film registers the image of the moving object, the object has already moved.  So the film registers a picture of both where the object was and where the object is.  So the picture looks blurry.  This is also why if you look at super slow-motion cameras, they always have uber strong lights shining on the thing they are filming."

I need to figure out why our view of certain high speed things are distorted when the objects go in circles. Of course, speed is the cause, but why aren't our eyes able to keep up with the ball?"
PhascinatingPhysics,3aif9g,JCM_WHSPhysics,2,Sun Jun 21 15:49:48 2015 UTC,Our brains can only process things up to a certain speed so once things go over that speed (aka the ball) then their path of motion starts to blur as our brain is playing catchup with what our eyes are processing

Because as you said, a lot of it was prefabricated.  So I think technically it was just assembled in 15 days.  Which is still super impressive, but different. Is this a giant office building that was built by Chinese contractors that is now just going to sit empty and abandoned, like THIS city that the Chinese government built but can't convince people to go to. They made a big deal about the air filtration systems for the building.  Which makes sense, as Beijing has horrible air pollution, and you would want to be able to filter the air.  But it made me sad that the culture is to purify the inside air rather than just make it so there was less pollution outside to begin with.  For instance, to an extent it doesn't matter how ""green"" California is, because all of China's air pollution drifts across the Pacific Ocean into China.  It doesn't matter how much the US reduces its carbon emissions if China is still spewing out massive amounts of carbon dioxide.

PhascinatingPhysics,3a9xua,JCM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:43:34 2015 UTC,I would be interested to know why you (and your peers) think the score distributions for a class like APUSH is so different than the score distributions for AP Physics C or BC Calc where the majority of students got 4's and 5's.
PhascinatingPhysics,3a9xua,ECF_WHSPhysics,2,Fri Jun 19 13:32:29 2015 UTC,"I think that kids who take AP Calc or AP Physics really love the subject, because someone who hated math would not take them, so they are more likely to be motivated and good at it. Many kids take AP History sophomore year because they want to take an AP class(it's the only one available to sophomores), but they don't really like history. Also, the history curriculum was also messed up this year, which confused a lot of students, the math and science was more stable as far as I know."
PhascinatingPhysics,3a9xua,JCM_WHSPhysics,2,Sun Jun 21 14:48:51 2015 UTC,"Plus, a good chunk of kids are recommended for APUSH right from freshman year, basically as long as you had an A for the term you were sent to AP.  For AP Calculus there is more of a split because you get to your senior year math class and there are other options to complete your required math credits. If a student starts freshman year in algebra 1 then they usually take stats, trig/calc, or pre-calculus in their senior year. If they start their freshman year in geometry, they're in honors calc, AB calc, BC calc, or AP stats their senior year.   There's far more variation to fit a student's skill level/need than in history where there were only 3 options (cp, honors, AP) and many students taking AP for the challenge or skills promised, not a joy for the actual content."
PhascinatingPhysics,3a9xua,RP_APPhysics_6,2,Sun Jun 21 15:39:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree here. The thing is, APUSH gets all the students that get and A or B in generally easy freshmen year class. With courses like Physics C and Calc BC, it seems to be well established how difficult they are and so people to know what to expect. Only the capable people take it. If you look at how the scores are distributed for something like the subject tests for Math 1 and 2, Math 2 has a higher scoring percentile despite the fact it is harder, because only the kids that know they can handle it, take it."
PhascinatingPhysics,3a9xua,ECF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun Jun 21 21:36:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, that is so true! People take APUSH because they were good at history freshman year, but that doesn't always prepare them for AP. However, people understand the challenge of math. You brought up a good point about the Math 1 and 2 tests. I took both of those, and that's very interesting that the Math 2 scores were higher, and it makes perfect sense.

Psychopaths are people who are incapable of feeling guilt or remorse for their actions. Scans of the brain have shown that this inability is due to a unidentified difference in their frontal cortex. There is no way to 'cure' a psychopath either, especially when they are older. Treatments and therapy have luke-warm results at best. The best way to help a psychopath is to identify the many signs of one while they are still a child.

PhascinatingPhysics,3a5r66,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:17:40 2015 UTC,I knew you could be born a psychopath because it all has to do with genetics technically speaking. It's something that is wrong in your brain. On an episode of law and order:svu a child was killing and hurting his family members/ sisters dolls/friends and had absolutely no remorse for it. He felt they deserved it even though he grew up in a loving home
PhascinatingPhysics,3a5r66,JF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 22 03:14:03 2015 UTC,Psychopathy has many forms and there is obvious benefit from being one in a relentless business often involving high tisk movements or dealing with situations that may emotional damage others such as laying someone off.   Being someone who has scored high for psychopathic tendencies on several tests I find this stuff interesting particularly trying to find out why I scored so high. Did you know that in clinical psychopath is is rare for a psychopath to be smart or excel in academics naturally as media depicts them. The crazy intelligent psychopaths that the movies depict are rare. Another interesting thing. However the study on this is not relevant to the field I plan on going into but it would be beneficial to be one in said field.

The documentary I believe talked about the relation between psychopaths and using or doing violent things, causing them to be violent people holistically. The narrator said that the psychopaths are not affected by their surroundings, but they are mentally unstable when they are born. Essentially, psychopaths are ""crazy"" from day one."

PhascinatingPhysics,39v30v,WDR_WHSPhysics,2,Fri Jun 19 14:49:34 2015 UTC,Yeah I can imagine that playing football on turf must also give some nasty burns when you're tackled.

PhascinatingPhysics,39rwj2,JTB_WHS,2,Sun Jun 14 04:00:13 2015 UTC,"Cooking uses a lot of chemistry.  For example, the smell of foods come from aromatic compounds, and the list goes on and on.

You're looking at cooking through the lens of other sciences and applying those other sciences to cooking. Cooking is a science in and of itself, without analyzing the organic chemistry of it or the thermodynamics of it. Just cooking itself is a science all on its own."
PhascinatingPhysics,39rwj2,BRW_APPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:06:10 2015 UTC,"DJC raises a good point though: virtually everything can be viewed as ""science"" if you are looking at the mechanics of what something is made of, or why something is the way that it is.  If you define ""science"" as the pursuit of knowledge, then this certainly fits.  If you define ""science"" as the actual testing and experimentation and research to first obtain that knowledge, then the original experimenters who discovered those things is ""science.""  Personally, I think it's a blend of the two."
PhascinatingPhysics,39rwj2,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Wed Jun 17 12:32:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, but what I was getting at is that you don't have to look at what it is made of or the mechanics of it. Within any system you can create a science. For instance: you could make a hypothesis that the design on playing cards would affect peoples' gambling winnings and then test that, without thinking about the optical psychology of it or the mass change in the cards or whatever (not the best example, baking is a good example though b/c you can ignore chemistry and thermodynamics and all that and treat recipes and the baking process as the object of the scientific focus). What I was getting at was that the ""traditional sciences"" (chem, physics, bio, etc) aren't the only ways something can be a science."
PhascinatingPhysics,39rwj2,BRW_APPhysics,2,Sun Jun 21 13:46:38 2015 UTC,"I think that baking tends to be more of a science because in order for bread to rise or a cake to form right you need the exact amount of the right ingredients. But with cooking you can kind of do whatever. Every time you make a dish you can do it a little differently, add more tomatoes and less onions in your pasta sauce. But overall cooking and baking follow many types of procedures that an experiment would! You apply heat or take heat away, ix in different variables until you get the right solution etc..."

It is its own, perfectly valid, self-contained science. Like Josh said, there is experimentation, recording, practice, testing, hypothesis, etc. etc. etc.. Even when someone cooks from a recipe, it is no different from when we do physics labs. You don't have to produce something new to be doing science.

PhascinatingPhysics,39rtzw,atm_HAstronomy_7,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:35:33 2015 UTC,I feel like the social factors play the largest role in this because women are usually more accepted to cry because of the common (but not always true) stereotype that women are more emotional than men.

PhascinatingPhysics,39rtzw,AST_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 15 02:46:43 2015 UTC,I honestly agree. I think that crying in terms of gender is not so much of a biological thing as much as its a issue with constructions in society.

PhascinatingPhysics,39rtzw,BRW_APPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:20:54 2015 UTC,"Not even that. The amount of hormonal activity in infants, or even pre pubescent children, is very low. To attribute these perceived differences to anything other than treatment of the child or a false perception on the part of whoever made up that statistic is just ridiculous.

Thats why I dont watch basketball games, the whole first half has little to no affect on how the game turns out--well that and the fact that fouls and other rules simply are not called by referees anymore.  It happens with other sports to.  Just look at the Pats game against the ravens this latest playoff season.  I am a huge fan of the interactions between science and sports but as far as using it to predict when to leave a game, I would say just stay till the end.

My uncle is an EMS and told me stories about kids who have jumped off bridges and rocks into water and didn't resurface for a while.

PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,PhascinatingPhysics,13,Wed Jun 10 11:41:17 2015 UTC,"Damn, ok. Well I've seem to have been mislead. Organic does not equal good automatically. I can't say I can fully believe this yet without looking into it a bit more, but I Have to say, it was a compelling argument by the author, especially, as he was an organic and natural enthusiast now changed. Haven't heard of the Monsato corporation either but it seems just a quick google search produces its site followed by dozens of organization and resistance against it. But the actual effects of GMOs by Monsato seem to be really blurred. While some claims on illnesses and cancer are debunked, I feel like there are other problems it is creating. You can't wage an entire war waged against this company with absolutely no basis, can you? And yet the author here was also a ""hate Monsato"" follower, but from the links he provided debunking some of the claims, it seems you just might be able to.   The links that he provided back that the war just might be stemming from the corporation giants' propaganda from that ""USDA Approved Organic"" label that unwittingly transformed the mindsets of people about GMOs. So basically all this time, we've been played for fools I guess...  Watching the video in the link(few swears in it for those of you not using earphones), it seems the whole organic case is debunked. They conduc a test where people try to guess which food is organic and which is non organic, and the majority of times it seems people end up actually picking the non organic one.  Organic uses just as many pesticides that are just as dangerous if not more then the modified pesticides used on regular food. In addition, the American Cancer Scoiety conducted research that says the pesticides barely affect anything at all in the human body that would contribute to cancer. Perhaps the most powerful fact stems from the fact that organic farms take up a lot more space for the same amount of crops, and how at most, the world could produce enough to feed four billion people... leaving three billion to starve. The more I watched this video, the more convinced I became of, perhaps not that non organic was better or the right way to go, but more that organic food definitely wasn't the right way. More so, the ""organic"" fuel to grow these plants come from cows, which produce more harmful gases then a crap load of different types of vehicles. That being said, the video does seem to target organic foods as the bad thing, and I feel to be completely convincing, it needs to acknowledge its positive, attributes, unless it asserts organic farming absolutely has no positive effects over regular farming.Most organic farms are from huge corporations as well, not small farmers as some believe.20% of the organic food seems to be coming form China as well...Thats right, the place where no one seems to want to trust food from. Oh now its a shocker.   I realize in my epiphany-to-rant type response, I may have overlooked something or be biased from the few provided sources. But from what I've read, it seems the case is clear that the propaganda from these big companies is what's fueling the organic movement.   tl;dr  Organic food seems to be an illusion by money sucking corporations. Non organic is just as good and more abundant. People believe what they see on TV a lot. Question everything.  ...Wonder if anyone is actually going to read this entire thing."

I also went to a Startalk Live! with Bill Nye speaking about genetic modification. The author definitely has an interesting opinion, one that I have not often seen in the GMO debate. I found it interesting that the author was a passionate supporter of no GMO and organic only to find holes in claims. I would like to do my own research regarding this issue too. If I could back up the author's claims, like organic crops take up 33% more space, it might sway my thoughts. It's definitely a hot button topic to discuss."

Anything that has been genetically modified technically fits.    So any time farmers take two plants and cross breed them for desired characteristics, the result is a GMO.  Every single breed of dog, then, are all GMOs.  Dogs are bred for particular traits.  Certain dogs are mated with others specifically for desired physical traits.

PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,CPW_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:10:46 2015 UTC,"Agent Orange:       Agent Orange—or Herbicide Orange (HO)—is one of the herbicides and defoliants used by the U.S. military as part of its herbicidal warfare program, Operation Ranch Hand,  during the Vietnam War from 1961 to 1971.  It was a mixture of equal parts of two herbicides, 2,4,5-T and 2,4-D.  During the late 1940s and '50s, the US and British collaborated on development of herbicides with potential applications in warfare. Some of those products were brought to market as herbicides. The British were the first to employ herbicides and defoliants to destroy the crops, bushes, and trees of communist insurgents in Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. These operations laid the groundwork for the subsequent use of Agent Orange and other defoliant formulations by the US.   In mid-1961, President Ngo Dinh Diem of South Vietnam asked the United States to conduct aerial herbicide spraying in his country. In August of that year, the South Vietnamese Air Force initiated herbicide operations with American help. But Diem's request launched a policy debate in the White House and the State and Defense Departments.  However, U.S. officials considered using it, pointing out that the British had already used herbicides and defoliants during the Malayan Emergency in the 1950s. In November 1961, President John F. Kennedy authorized the start of Operation Ranch Hand, the codename for the U.S. Air Force's herbicide program in Vietnam.

Don't count for weekly participation points.  DISCUSSION STARTER: Threequotes particularly stood out to me as major pieces of the Iida's Ruishalme's article:  First (and this is a quote of a quote):   We assumed that “natural” chemicals were automatically better and safer than synthetic materials, and we were wrong. It’s important that we be more prudent in our acceptance of “natural” as being innocuous and harmless.   Second:   The picture I was beginning to piece together was that being ‘organic’ was based on the idea that modern farming – industrial agriculture – was bad, and the old ways of farming were better. That whatever natural was, that was better.   Each of these quotes cut to the heart of the thing: That ""natural"" is inherently ""better"" than ""engineered"", and ""natural"" can't even be bad because it's, you know, natural.  Finally:   I began to question if there even was a ‘natural way to farm’? If natural was defined by, say, the exclusion of human activities, then surely there was nothing natural to farming. On the other hand, if we accepted humans as a part of nature, and our continued innovations as part of our nature, then all farming was natural. Saying that more traditional farming practices would be inherently better than those using more advanced technology wasn’t a concept that could be settled by a romantic appeal to nature.    I especially liked this insight - any intentional farming that goes beyond gathering wild berries and plants is by its very definition ""unnatural"".  So what is ""natural"" farming?  What is ""organic"" if farming by its very nature is humanity imposing its will upon nature?  I have long argued that organic does not equate to healthy.  After all, uranium is natural and organic, yet I still wouldn't eat it.  Heck, there are plenty of plants native to North America that will kill you if you eat them.  Yet they are ""organic"" and ""natural.""  They grow on their own in the wild, after all.  So here's the actual questions:   How did the author's article change (or not) your opinion about organic/natural farming and foods vs. foods produced via industrial agriculture?  Check the comments on the original post HERE (And this one is perhaps more important to me, as a science teacher who wants to create young adults who are skeptical of all claims and think critically for themselves:) The author went in great detail describing all the research done to find the information quoted in the article.  There are even embedded links to the original research itself.  How does this impact the author's arguments?  Does it help or hurt it?  Did it have any impact on your opinion or reaction to the article?  Why/why not?"

A potato from a sketchy one-stop in Dublin is just as good as an organic potato from Whole Foods, and probably a lot cheaper (gasp! the vegan insulted WF!). People talk a big game about GMOs and how bad they are. Whenever I hear that, I remind them: ""there is nothing inherently bad about Genetically Modified crops""; to which they often reply something along the lines of ""Yeah, but...."" and go on to explain to me why they always are, and always will be, the bane of vegetables everywhere. I am, at this point, exasperated by all the, frankly, ludicrously stupid comments I've heard about how ""I don't want chemicals in my food"" or ""It's unnatural"".

Not only are they just as healthy as organic foods, they also use up less land than and the same chemicals as natural foods. Moreover, there are so many humans on Earth that organic farming wouldn't support and feed everyone. GMOs are pretty important, and this article highlighted this fact very well.

I think I've learned that more through the humanities courses I've taken though which seems ironic to me in some ways. I think it all goes back to the basis of human learning and language"
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,DES_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Jun 11 03:38:30 2015 UTC,"Reaction: I really can't believe how much this article has altered my opinion on Monsanto and aomewhat in organic food. I believe that Monsanto was also an ""evil"" company that had a monopoly against farmers and tried to extort money from them. Then, that article come along and changes my opinion completely. The movie food inc had me believing that Monsanto was evil too until I find a project on the claim by the farmer who was sued. It runs out that the whole issue was mostly the farmers fault and not monsantos. I am also shocked at the effects of organic food. I become that there was a clear health benefit to eating organic, yet there has be proven to be no such thing. I only wonder what would happen if all the organic shoppers read this article or the claims against organic farming."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,DES_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Jun 11 04:04:09 2015 UTC,"Questions: I believe that this article further confirmed my belief hat Monsanto was not completely evil and corrupt as most viewers of Food inc believe. If you read their website, they have a link to a whole page explaining the scene in that documentary and how it's all biased and distorted. This article provides more evidence against that claim and also how organic farming is not beneficial at all. This later claim was one that I didn't not know or recognize. I believed in organic farming because it sounded like a clear healthy choice, but in fact it's not at all.   I also am confident in her services claims due to the abundance of evidence and clear links to her direct points. If someone made these claims with no evidence, they would have a hard time convincing people. The author is much more persuasive with all these links and quotes from certified research papers."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,MrEldredge,2,Thu Jun 11 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"REACTION: This was a rather shocking article for me.  Yes I am not very interested in the idea of GMOs and organic food and what not, but at the same time, I consider it a somewhat civic duty to know where our food comes from and what troubles it is creating for the Earth.  My English class watched Food Inc. this year so I am ashamed to admit that I too fell into the trap that the author mentioned about half way through the article.  Looking back on the film, its sole appeal to the pathos of viewers, without any logical witnesses or testifiers was a huge gap in the movie's argument.  It was really interesting to see that a company that had been turned into a complete super villain in my mind is actually benefitting the food industry in many ways.  The whole idea of ""organic"" being just a useless tag was pretty thought provoking as well.  I had always just assumed that organic meant better but boy was I wrong."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,CPW_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Jun 11 04:43:47 2015 UTC,"DISCUSSION STARTER: This article totally changed my perspective on natural vs. industrial foods.  It logically made sense and was presented in a way that was incredibly easy to understand.  It reminds me of the ever so stupid ""smoke pot, it comes from the earth, so it can't be bad"" argument.  We as a society have been lulled into thinking that chemicals are always bad and that natural is always good, but this is far from the case.  As for the inclusion of the sites where she got her research from: I totally supported it.  It gave her argument factual backing and when the information contrasted her views, it strengthened he side by showing that she acknowledges the complexity of the topic.  With science, there is no such thing as too much research and including one's sources can only help by showing how they came to form their opinions."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,SKS_APPhysics_6,2,Thu Jun 11 04:50:23 2015 UTC,"I automatically assumed that organic food had many benefits compared to the other foods. After reading this it really opens my eyes. The article showed that there is no real evidence to prove that eating organic foods are better than any other food. It is really quite strange too because of the prices of organic food. The original research totally helps her argument too, they all show that there is no proof to back up the claim that organic food has any health benefits."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,MRD_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Jun 11 14:39:35 2015 UTC,"Reaction: Wow. I live incredibly close to a Whole Foods, which replced the grocery store I grew up going to. I was always suspicious of the magic of ""organic"" given that I never quite knew the difference. (I believe I actually asked my dad this question and the response recieved was ""it's better for you "") I never tasted a difference, and now I'm happy to know that there isn't any difference worth the ammount you pay for it.   Discussion: My opinion remains as stated above, all thr article did was reinforce it. There is no notable benefit besides getting to be that one snooty guy at a party that turns up their nose at anything that's not organic.  The guy having so many sources that he readily shared with jis readers definitely helps his credibility. It shows that he took the time to research and form an educated argument."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,CPW_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Jun 11 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"So I was actually in Boston about two weeks back, and there was a protest against Monsanto going on in Copley Square (pretty sure it was on a Saturday). Up until then I had no idea what Monsanto even was - my friend summed up the anti-Monsanto argument in a few sentences over text, and that was that. I didn't even question that Monsanto was a bad organization until I read the article.  I have to admit the pro-Monsanto articles in the links make a pretty good argument. But there was one issue that wasn't touched on - Monsanto is a giant corporation, and the article didn't address the whole giant company vs. local business argument. There have to be some people who are anti-Monsanto because it's one of the giants, who would rather put their money towards small businesses than towards the company that's already making billions of dollars. And yes, while the pro-Monsanto arguments are convincing, it's hard for me to believe that all the protests against Monsanto are based on empty facts. I mean, if dislike for Monsanto is so widespread, the people probably have some good points of their own. After reading the article, I'm not quite sure where I stand."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,ker_whsphysics,2,Fri Jun 12 01:48:26 2015 UTC,"Having done research on Food Inc. and the Monsanto company for both this year and last, I was not surprised when I found out that organic is any more nutritious than conventional. Many people are fooled by the organic label, thinking it is ""better"" but this is thinking could lead to a mistake as the author would say. It is awful that companies use this moment of the hype with organic foods just to make money. But the point that Ruishlame is trying to make is that there is no right or wrong way to grow food. In this day and age, if we have to feed so many people and rely on technology and science to meet these standards than conventional farming should also be considered as natural. Combining organic and conventional methods would be useful in the long run and might even make a difference. Ruishlame did something that not a lot of people could do, he realized that both ways could work and that for things to work you have to listen, and consider both sides of an argument.  Discussion starter: after reading, the author didn't change my mind if organic is better. I choose to eat organic to help the environment. But now because of this author I know that organic or conventional is neither right or wrong. The author made the realize that using both methods could lead farming to greater things.  When the author used the sources it made the argument more successful and reputable. However in his research he did not find all the answers. This reminds me of the 21st century skills or even life skills that you can't always find the answer by googling the question. He went through research and went back to his essential question/thought. He had a processed thinking."
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,CMD_WHSPhysics,2,Fri Jun 12 03:13:50 2015 UTC,"I find that the argument made has me skeptical, whether this is because of my cynicism or because it wasn't convincing is beyond me. Now I have know organic foods can be really good for you but alas almost every plant is genetically modified because of farming. We pick plans and breed them for desirable traits. I have no problem with with type of food. Although I probably eat more industrial grown food as I don't check whether or not it is or not.  This seemed not convincing to me. It may just be a typical cynical American or me being stuck in my ways.personally I see that the links should help make it more convincing but in a digital format I feel it make it less so.

This means rigorous testing and requirements to label GMOs so that people know what they are eating/using GMOs are not regulated at all by the US government. On the website, it says ""The United States does not have any federal legislation that is specific to genetically modified organisms"" The state of Vermont, however passed a law requiring all GMOs be labeled ""the State should require food produced with genetic engineering to be labeled as such in order to serve the interests of the State, notwithstanding limited exceptions, to prevent inadvertent consumer deception, prevent potential risks to human health, protect religious practices, and protect the environment."" This was passed in April 2014 According to FARE, (Food Allergy Research and Education) the number of allergies has increased 50% from 1997 to 2011 in developed countries. In the years 1995 and 96, GM soy beans resistant to the pesticide Roundup were introduced to the US. Also from FARE, soy are some of the most common food allergies, especially among children and babies.   I'll try to find more sources later, but this is what I found so far. The first three sources are government sources. I trust the FARE sources, because my family has relied on it for years for education about my brothers' anaphalaxis allergy."

I was just wondering if perhaps they are withholding any flaws that could stray consumers away from organic foods. Given that, I question that they are hiding some flaws and purposely labeling that organic foods are better, though the author argues against their benefits. So what I guess I am really theorizing is that, like the author explains, organic food is not beneficially better for us but marketing and advertising leads us to believe so because the common misconception is that anything natural is better despite the facts proving otherwise."

So, that was boring and exasperating. I think that's key for checking sources on the internet. I had to trace through a web of sources. Every link she had was usually to another article which, if I was lucky, listed out several studies and journals and such as sources. If I wasn't lucky, I found links to more articles, like she had. This could go on for several iterations sometimes. My point here is this: internet source checking is more tiresome, complicated, and ambiguous than most other forms of source checking. I think that is why so many people are willing to believe any article they read, especially one with that alluring blue text, without ever confirming what they're reading.

Yes this article gave insight into the cons about organic food, but it's similar to other stuff being said over and over again like ""This food is bad, don't eat it.  This food is good so you should eat it.""  I know that some foods are bad and it this article does bring to my attention that some ""good"" foods are actually bad, but I mainly don't think about what is good and what is bad when I eat.  If I'm hungry and there are bad foods such as hotdogs, I'll eat them.  If I'm hungry and there are good foods such as salad, I'll eat them.    The author's research and embedded links help her cause.  The links and research provide back-up support for her claims.  It's like English class where you can't say something you think without a piece of quoted evidence.  You need some quoted evidence to back-up what you said and show that others agree with you.  There are several pieces of quoted evidence that back-up her statements, making me believe her more than if she only had a few pieces of quoted evidence.  Also, most people think organic food is good for you.  If someone read this and there weren't a lot of support for her statements, the reader may not believe her.  However, she has a lot of evidence, which helps her argument.  I was a little hesitant at first to believe what she was saying, but then as I kept reading, I realized that she had a lot of evidence and that what she was arguing must be right.  So the amount of research that she put into the article did in fact change my reaction on the article."

PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,BMM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Jun 11 04:33:13 2015 UTC,This article was really eye opening to me. I too was under the impression that organic was better and that genetic engineered foods wasnt as good but still a viable source for food. Its really interesting to me how many reasons there are that prove organic to be actually worse than synthetic even though the general population is lead to believe it the other way around. Its really hard to believe that society says these claims about organic being better without any proof backing it up and everyone blindly believes it.

I have barely eaten organic food before except vegetables and fruits because it seems pretty expensive for me and I actually do not care about what I eat. I just concern if the food is delicious or not. This article is actually an interesting topic for me to look into and learn more about the healthiness of GMOs and industrial food.  The author puts in many evidence through the embedded links to other sources that she finds to back her claims up. By doing that, it makes me feel more convinced about her opinion that GMOs is not actually perfect for your health and not better than industrial food at all. Organic farms do use pesticides to clean off bugs which may also damage the crops or food as well. However, I believe that the scientists working at Monsanto will keep exploring and developing ways to actually help the GMOs better significantly than industrial food."

Being a vegetarian I typically try to eat as healthy as I can and I have always considered that to be naturally produced foods. I think the author does make some good points for not just refusing to eat genetically modified food, but until more research is done and more is known about both sides or the argument I have a hard time taking one side. I do however believe that by using other sources and showing that he did his research the author really improves his ethos. It shows that he did not quickly write this and throw it up online. Instead, he took the time to do research and make sure he was backing up his argument."

It was important to see the other side in oder to make sure I had all the information. Even still I am stuck in the middle. I still want more information about the two sides and the long term effects on your body of eating food with GMOs in it vs. not eating food with GMOs.

It is important for Americans and food consumers to be aware of this situation but GMO is not the only threat to our eating. You are what you eat they say!

Full of information and statistics that prove or defend the importance of organic vs. manufactured/processed food, it can effectively change the point of the view of the audience.

PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,JMK_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:53:49 2015 UTC,Discussion Starter Well it looked like I touched upon the discussion starter in my original reaction to the article but let me restate what I think… The author writes in defense of GMO's contrary to what we are fed to believe that you should never eat unnatural things and that natural/organic products are the standards we should follow. It has changed my opinion in terms of me not wanting to eat strictly organic products due to other reasons  than my manly personna. Now I understand that they aren't all what they are cracked up to be and man made foods/farming can sometimes be safer due to their interference by man.The authors direct links to research make this less of taking his word for it and instead convincing me. It was a positive touch in this article.
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,ATB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:58:12 2015 UTC,Reaction: This article kind of shocked me. I always thought organic food was the way to go to have the healthiest life-style but this article proved this wrong.  Another negative of organic food is that it is very expensive.  People think they are paying the high prices because the food is so healthy but now I know this is no longer true.  I found it interesting that GMOs are just as healthy as organic food.

After reading this article I will still eat foods from both categories. I believe the embedded information had both its positives and negatives.

It explains the reality behind such strongly defended and denounced subjects and takes it from a scientific stand point rather than as a debate. It explains how GMOs are not as bad a people make them out to be as well as how inefficient, ineffective, and uneconomical organic foods truly are. Definitely brought some light to the subject. I used to think organic was better but that has definitely changed!"
PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,BJB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:32:00 2015 UTC,"Reaction: This article was eye opening. Most people (me being included) think that organic foods are the best thing going when it comes to nutrition and Eco-friendliness. But the organic farming industry doesn't want us to know that they are not perfect. The fact that they want to hide their follies is not something that is uncommon in industry, it is understandable that they want us to see their ""good side""; but when the industry makes a profit of slandering non-organic farms and by twisting the truth, that is when they lose credibility and respect. I thought it was good to see that the author of this article looked into claims and admitted that he was wrong after so boldly opposing artificial pesticides. Discussions starter: Going into this article I thought that organic foods where a sort of ""cure all"" and where perfect foods. I thought that they where the top tier, healthiest choices. After reading it I realized that I too believed that natural was always better; more innocent and safe. That is not true and I also think that we should now continue with where we have been heading when it comes to Eco-friendly farming; we should do what is the healthiest and safest for our environment but which also yields a fair amount of good; be it using natural or artificial tactics and tools."

This author seems to take a side to the debate on organic consumtion that is not heard of really.

PhascinatingPhysics,39abtt,JF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:47:30 2015 UTC,"Reaction: While I do think that there are many things wrong with the industrial food system, I don't really think that GMOs deserve such backlash. Initially, I was aware of how fallacious organic farming could be. Maybe one could say that the critical analysis of organic farming within the article pertains more to industrial organic, as paradoxical as it may sound. Before reading this article, I was in support of local produce, and I believe that I still am. While ""natural farming"" is more of a concept than a concrete practice, there are aspects of farming such as seasonality, that should be approached with respect. Science makes the logical argument, but there are certain aspects of our interaction with the natural world that transcend the need for efficiency. I'll admit buying locally is a far cry from solving associated problems. Nonetheless I can understand why people instantly perceive foods that are organic as better and view advancements in agricultural technology with skepticism. Maybe marketing is to blame. Maybe it's just our biophilia kicking in, some argue it's ignorance. We're conditioned to believe it's natural and there are consequences to that. And on a different note, perhaps genetically modified food isn't as evil as everyone makes it out to be, but I view Monsanto as a company to be approached with distrust. Essentially, it appears to be a corporate power abusing agricultural technology for undisclosed purposes. But then again that's my take on it.  Discussion Starter: By using factual evidence and incorporating research, the author was able to assert his points more convincingly, than if they had relied solely on general claims.  I have to admit I'm too easily persuaded by the idea of ""natural"" and farming. It's a romanticized notion that is anything but tangible. After reading this article, I still feel like we should still be able to have a connection to our food deeper than what industrial agriculture churns out. You can poke holes in my argument or tear it up, I'm open to debate on this."

The data shows that type A should smoke because they have a higher stress level, and type B don't need to smoke because they are generally characterized by a lower stress level. It all just seems like a big marketing scheme by the tobacco industries, and not really science.  Jung got much closer in my opinion, but again, it is hard to fit each individual into one of 16 personalities, because they are... individuals. There is also a big discussion in the scientific community on whether or not psychology actually is a science. The consensus is, most classical psychology, like Jung and Freud, didn't follow the scientific method and most of it is ""mysticism"" and a pseudo science in general."

Moreover, the higher tier colleges are not only too expensive for the poor of America, but also for the middle class. Nobody wants to be paying 60,000 a year for education it is ridiculous.

Basically, while watching it today I had an internal freak out while wondering frantically why do we even exist. I had questions like if there are multiple universes, each called a membrane, what makes up the outside of the membrane? Is the space between the membranes also ""space""? How am I able to think? How did the universe work so that the Earth and everything to ever happen on it has ever happened? The chance that you or me could even have existed is so very small. And to think that all of this is made up of strings, and that there may be other parallel universes millimeters away from me blow my mind.

This my be my family dynamic where my older sibling was self sufficient and well rounded doing good in stuff placing a shadow on the middle child where they constantly have to strive o be better than or live up to the image of the older sibling. Now this is worse for the youngest because they have more older siblings to live up to. Being a middle child my parents pressure me more than my youngest sibling who shows signs of being spoiled, irresponsible and immature and more than my oldest who is already out of my parents view so they focus on me as the next person to do stuff. That leave my younger sister but not youngest as the ""forgotten child"" a former youngest turned middle child they struggle to attain the attention of the parents more than the responsible older, the other middle and the spoiled youngest. Now being a middle child I am relatively relaxed but however am not a social butterfly in any sense. I reject social media, I don't talk to people much and I don't go out often. I prefer being ignored by parents. Now this may be more environmental influence then birth order.

I'm the oldest of four (my sister and brother are in the middle, and my youngest sister is ten) and the middle sister definitely puts a ton of pressure on herself to do well in school, and she's often super competitive with me.

There is a way for both people to win this game. If both people continuously play the 'cooperate' card then they both walk away with more money, thus helping eachother.

On another front, the video game Fifa 16 has announced that 12 of the 24 women's world soccer teams are available to play. An interesting point I'd like to discuss is that in the past, some companies have made the excuse that it's too hard to animate women for whatever reason. Now Fifa has done it, with many recognizable female players such as Hope Solo from the US team. It has caused a lot of backlash, because apparently women have no place in football or video games.

PhascinatingPhysics,37uj4h,JHF_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Sun May 31 17:52:34 2015 UTC,I agree. I felt this way even when the first art watches came out because you needed the phone for the watch to work. Why would I want to spend extra money to get the watch when I can do every thing the watch does on a larger screen on my phone for less money?

A magnus force or a magnus effect, is a particular manifestation of Bernoulli's theorem: fluid pressure decreases at points where the speed of the fluid increases."
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Sat May 30 02:32:04 2015 UTC,This is exactly the kind of stuff I have imagined you guys making and posting on a hypothetical phascinatingphysics YouTube channel.
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,WDR_WHSPhysics,2,Sat May 30 11:50:36 2015 UTC,"Curve balls are definitely the hardest pitch to hit. I was pretty bad at hitting when i played and I especially hated curve balls. I wonder if a curve ball can go faster than a fastball. Also, does wind affect the drop of the ball at the last second?"
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,BAG_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun May 31 19:05:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, the wind over the top of the ball fight against the ball's wind going in the opposite direction. This ""fight"" causes a high pressure zone. The wind going under the ball joins the wind already under the ball going the same direction. These two forces combine to create a low pressure zone. The high pressure zone wants to equalize with the low, thus ""dropping"" the ball. Combine this with gravity and you have yourself a curveball."
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,JJB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:35:28 2015 UTC,"I watched this video in my Engineering class about the magnus effect and also bernoullis effect when pitchers throw a curve ball and how the air effects the direction that the ball goes when it is thrown, and also where it ends up. Very interesting"
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,ker_whsphysics,1 point,Sun May 31 16:17:10 2015 UTC,I wonder if this is similar to physics/effect of curving a soccer ball when you kick it. Clearly they weigh different masses and have purposes but a ball is a ball.
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,JMK_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun May 31 17:08:57 2015 UTC,"Actually, you're right - the same idea applies to a soccer ball because, like a baseball, it has seams. The air catches in the seams and makes the ball curve in the air. For example, it's possible to kick a knuckleball of sorts if you hit the ball directly in its center. This will start it off with no spin, then as the air catches at the seams it will begin to turn, making it curve off in another direction at the last second."
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,BAG_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:53:58 2015 UTC,I'm sure the Magnus effect and bernoullis principle are able to be produced on any ball like object with seams of some sort. Like a tennis ball or volleyball.
PhascinatingPhysics,37srw5,MEB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:33:00 2015 UTC,I always thought that for a picture the ball would only rotate in one direction for every pitch. That direction was the way a fast ball moves. Curve balls are really strange. Baseball is a really slow and kind of boring sport so I don't really watch it that much/

Many people have criticized FIFA for its corruption before; the officials are performing fraud, taking bribes from countries World Cup host  positions, racketeering, and evading income taxes. Scientists say that once people become involved in corruption, it is extremely difficult to fix. Moreover, organizations are very susceptible to corruption and, once involved in malpractices, encourage such actions in the workplace.

PhascinatingPhysics,371zx6,BRW_APPhysics,1 point,Sun May 24 18:30:29 2015 UTC,"This is actually about 50% right and 50% wrong.  Stars come in many different types.  Most stars are on what is called the ""main sequence.""  These are stars where at the core, hydrogen is being fused into helium.  For these stars, there is a correlation between mass and size and temperature: more massive stars are physically larger and their surfaces (and cores) are hotter. Hotter means bluer.  The sun is right in the middle (bottom middle, really) and is a plain-ol' boring yellow star.  It isn't particularly massive (in fact, on the small side) and so isn't particularly hot (on the cool side).  For main sequence stars, bigger is hotter and bluer.  Smaller is cooler and redder.  However, as stars age, what's happening in side their cores changes.  Hydrogen  builds up and eventually starts to fuse into carbon.  Insert hand-waving and complicated physics and astrophysics, and the result is more of what you described.  For these stars, the outer layers are indeed cooler, and so redder.  The inside is actually really, really, really, hot though (which is what makes the outside layers expand and cool off).  So for these stars, they get big and red.  Note, too, that the really massive stars never really do this.  They just stay big and hot and blue.  Also notice that you're not going to get small white stars.  The closest thing to a small, white star (if you are looking for an astronomical thing that is ""small"" and white) is a white dwarf, which technically speaking, isn't a star, as there is no nuclear fusion happening at the core.  A white dwarf is really the leftover core of a medium-sized main sequence star after it finished all the nuclear fusion it could.    Stars are phun."

PhascinatingPhysics,371zx6,JHF_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Sun May 24 16:43:44 2015 UTC,That's so weird to think about. We are so insignificant to the universe it hurts. It's stuff like this that just assures me that there is definitely life out there. I wonder if there is a huge earth to match that huge star out there with huge people. Unrealistic but can you imagine that
PhascinatingPhysics,371zx6,ker_whsphysics,1 point,Mon May 25 04:37:51 2015 UTC,"Haha, I suppose it's as likely as anything else. I mean, it's not like we could possibly know. It seems extremely unlikely to us but it's no more or less likely than anything. If anything a little more, because the Earth environment is the only one that we know can support life."

Well, it is how our eyes perceive light and particles and the way eyes are moving. There were many useful optical illusions in real life.

Even though the pictures weren't moving, when I focused on 1, the others seemed to be shifting.  This also happened when I blinked.  It was also cool how the ships used paint for optical allusions during the war to make the enemies unable to detect their speed and direction.  This also happened with the Russian bombers tricking the US into making almost 2000 bombers when in fact the Russians only had 150.  These allusions also help with safety as shown by the girl chasing the ball painted in the road so when drivers are a certain distance from it, it appears as if there actually is a child in the road."

It consists of 36 thirty-second long exposures that are all compiled together.  This shows how much the Earth is really moving since the stars are staying generally 'still' while the Earth itself is rotating quickly.  It would be much longer except my battery died.

PhascinatingPhysics,36y404,CPW_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun May 24 17:02:14 2015 UTC,"I used my Nikon D60.  It was on manual mode and the lens was manually focused (which is the hardest part).  I then used a program on my computer called Camera Control Pro 2, which is a program for Nikon cameras.  It basically hooks up to my computer, which acts as an intervalometer.  Since it is set for 30 second exposures, the computer is set to start an exposure every 35 seconds.  This results in a nice smooth flow of pictures that line up perfectly.  Pictures in Video Form.  I then used a program called Star Stax which layers all the photos on top of each other and essentially plays connect the dots."

Maybe, but I don't really mind if no one uses it. All the formatting does is add a little flair to your text posts. They can't do anything other than exemplifying something, making things easier to read, or quickly letting someone go to a link.

PhascinatingPhysics,36qkmp,PhascinatingPhysics,2,Thu May 21 09:45:19 2015 UTC,It's always good to make sure that you have facts to back up with what you are trying to say.  It makes people take you much more seriously since you have factual information.
PhascinatingPhysics,36qkmp,DJC_HPhysics_2,2,Thu May 21 17:41:02 2015 UTC,Saw this on the front page couple days ago and I was reluctant to post it haha. Hate to admit its true for the most part. You can make an argument we can use them for educational purposes times too during school... but lets be real
PhascinatingPhysics,36qkmp,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Thu May 21 19:40:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Phones are important to have, but it's obvious that using them in class will hurt performance.

PhascinatingPhysics,36qkmp,EMD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 22 00:30:08 2015 UTC,This article makes a lot of sense.  Our school says that we aren't supposed to have our phones out but not a lot of teachers enforce this rule and so most of the students are on their phones during the day.  The biggest problem I see with trying to have everyone put away their phone is that so many students are attached to them that it will take a long time for them to get used to not looking at their phones for an entire 6 hours! (Its the end of the world for them!)
PhascinatingPhysics,36qkmp,ncs_whsphysics,1 point,Sun May 24 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"Seriously I don't understand why people are so addicted to there phones during school! Maybe its just me, but my phone is off and in my bag all day until my study last period! And then if I need it during the day, say for physics class when we need the tilt app, I take my phone out turn it on use it and then turn it off! I understand that people like to have them and want to keep it on during the day but there is no need to be texting during class! Its crazy to me that people would expect a good grade in the class, but thinks its okay to use there phone during the actual class! Like school takes work! If you want to do well and are striving to do your best, then put the phone away to start!"
PhascinatingPhysics,36qkmp,EEF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue May 26 01:06:40 2015 UTC,"It's too bad that most students (myself included) are overly tempted to abuse cell phone use.

Also, when they do projects such as the Newton's Laws video they could upload it to that channel for easy access"
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,DMA_WHSPhysics,2,Mon May 25 20:53:52 2015 UTC,The channel would definitely help the students next year with their early understandings of physics topics. I think watching videos on the topics made by other students would have made a huge impact on my understanding.
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,BAG_WHSPhysics,2,Tue May 26 03:43:18 2015 UTC,I know /u/phascintatingphysics had talked about doing something like this in the past
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,DJC_HPhysics_2,1 point,Thu May 21 14:40:56 2015 UTC,"I've actually already signed up for a YouTube channel called PhascinatingPhysics, but I don't know what content to create and/or post. Proof  I had talked with /u/DJC_HPhysics_2 about maybe doing cool science/physics videos, preferably student-written, filmed, edited, etc.  You could do demos of cool physics stuff, explanations of cool physics stuff, etc. etc.  I had envisioned a ""Glee"" type scenario, where if the channel was started, the cast and crew could rotate as students went through the physics program.  It would certainly be something that I would support and help with, and starting it up might even make an awesome Capstone project for someone..."
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,PhascinatingPhysics,2,Thu May 21 18:08:06 2015 UTC,We should definitely upload some of the super projects. Or maybe..those awesome music videos we did...And it seems like everything makes a great Capstone project for someone lately. Either there's a lot of new good ideas or people are doing lame things they don't care for.
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Thu May 21 19:34:33 2015 UTC,"I'm for it. But again, I want it to be student led and driven. I want you guys to decide what to make and post and edit the videos and all that.   But I would definitely sponsor it, guide, and advise. Still maintain it could be turned into a pretty awesome Capstone project."
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,PhascinatingPhysics,2,Thu May 21 20:07:30 2015 UTC,"Maybe implement a system similar to that of the mods of this subreddit? Poll on who is interested in running it, rotate people if enough are interested. Everyone gives the group of people running it the videos to post."
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:23 2015 UTC,I would love to see students running the youtube channel! Taking a poll and having students send videos to this group would probably be the most efficient system while still allowing students to run it
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,JCM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu May 21 23:54:35 2015 UTC,"I think that if you gave each class in a rotating schedule one month to upload a ton of videos.  For example, this year could've been AP-C during September, H-Phys October, AP-1(5) November, AP-1(6) December, H-Astro January, and then have it repeat again.  Each person/group would need to make at least two or so videos as a grade to be uploaded.  That way, there is new content constantly being updated.  It would be an interesting and unique approach to a hands on education."
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,DJC_HPhysics_2,2,Fri May 22 02:01:25 2015 UTC,"The only problem with making it a grade is I feel some people will post just for the sake of the points, like some of the posts on the subreddit. Not sure how to fix it, but something along these lines would be good."
PhascinatingPhysics,36psn3,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Sat May 23 02:36:34 2015 UTC,If it was an extra credit opportunity instead and only the best 5 videos made got the extra credit than people would be more likely to create better videos

However the drilling on the moon could be an alternate. It is so massive that farming a metric ton a day would far outlast any need for it, taking 220mil years to deplete 1% of its mass. By that time, surely we would have found other energy/resources."

With 3d printers it takes days to print out small objects and they are thinking of printing out a station. Also the costs to do it at this time would not have a positive outcome meaning a lot of money lost and a lot of unhappy people but in the future this will probably be happening in full force.

I really liked this quote because I definetly see this happen everywhere. I know if I am doing a research paper I will only use sources that support me, because I only want my point to be proven further. I think, in science, this happens a lot. People will see evidence contrary to their beliefs and dismiss it. For example, if someone did not believe the moon landing happened they would most likely only look at conspiracy theories explaining why it couldn't have happened, instead of looking up information about how it happened. I think this sets us back because most people do not want to let go of what they believe"

Now that that's out of the way, I think ""complexity paragraphs"" in our english essays are meant to expose us to this idea that our side is not the only one with credible information. Except, that this idea isn't taught much beyond that. We're not taught, especially in English papers, to look at both sides of an argument and note each side's valid points. We're told to seek out points that will reinforce our opinions, because that will create the strongest argument.  While this is a valid paper writing technique, I don't think that overall we promote a healthy way of considering a multifaceted topic when it is presented.  Instead of exploring the different sides, we tend to pick one and stick to it like glue as long as there are others supporting us."
PhascinatingPhysics,36im5c,SRJ_WHSPhysics,2,Wed May 20 04:49:37 2015 UTC,I totally agree with the stuff you were saying about essay writing.

PhascinatingPhysics,36im5c,JCM_WHSPhysics,2,Wed May 20 14:41:48 2015 UTC,I agree. Like when we go to library and use the research database and search things under opposing viewpoints. We get to see other ideas about the subject that normally we wouldn't think about or use as evidence. Sometimes we learn more about something based in the properties it doesn't have than the properties it does have

And they will continue to trump science, especially when there is no clear downside to ignoring science.”  This is the quote that gets to me, without a doubt. It's a terrifying concept, to think that the need to fit in is SO strong, that it can overwhelm the scientific process and scientific discoveries. That we care less about being right, and being cautious, and being smart about our beliefs, and we care more about making sure that our beliefs are the same as our friends. That's absolutely terrifying to me! And the scariest part is that you see it happen to people you are close to, you see it happen to people who are incredibly intelligent and rationally minded and you get frustrated and want to go and punch every single one of their friends in the face for holding the same beliefs. If we could stop being so worried about how other people wanted us to think, and started caring simply about how we ourselves think, our lives would be so much better."

I know in our physics class, Mr. P talked about how Newton kept his discoveries in his basement for so long. I think the only positive thing about people trying to align themselves with others' beliefs is when belief of the majority is one that is positive and beneficial to society. For example, feminism is a rising idea in America, especially in our generation. I know a lot of pro-feminist organizations are trying to spread gender equality on a platform of painting it as the cool way to think. (Of course, me seeing feminism as positive is my opinion and there are people that will disagree with that, not trying to say it's fact, just what I think)."

I feel like a lot of the time people will agree with what is easiest to agree to and what will not stir the waters. People can be completely wrong but if they have followers that spread their beliefs, then they will be seen as right. I feel like it happens often in the classroom/ in life that someone knows something for sure but won't speak up because they're alone and don't have support. This is like science in the way that people can learn and grow but if nobody is listening or accepting the truth then it means nothing."

PhascinatingPhysics,36im5c,AST_WHSPhysics,2,Wed May 20 03:10:40 2015 UTC,"That's a very good point to bring up. Social issues such as homosexuality and transgender have become much more accepted over the past years which is a huge political leap. However, I feel like science is a different beast to have to deal with because it has become so much more personal. It doesn't personally affect someone if another person comes out (some may disagree) but it is more personally affected when the government is regulating water treatments and environment protocol. Science becomes a little complex there"

We are always told to keep an open mind, but when your best friend tells you that he doesn't like someone for a certain insignificant reason, do you stand in his way and challenge his views? Do you risk ruining your friendship with him because of one small argument that he had with someone else? Nah, you just accept it and are forced to dislike that person as well. I feel like many scenarios are like that. People are made to believe certain things even if they know they shouldn't and that the only reason they're doing it is to gain social acceptance."

Or is it because they just see it as a way to fit in? I do agree with you on the subject that many issues are not brought up or announced because the individuals fear repercussion, but in this case, is that really the matter? When half of your friends support equal rights and pay, will you really risk being the outcast and say that you don't believe the same things? I really doubt it. The problem is that you've only been exposed to one side of the issue. I'm not saying feminism is bad, nor that it is good. I'm just saying that very few people will actually try to see the logic behind it and make a contra-argument. These people, even if they see a flaw in a feminist's ideals, will not speak up, simply because they are afraid that they will be publicly humiliated by the outspoken feminists."

Although this jumps into more of a political debate, it really just goes again how people would rather conform than actually try to debate. Right now, the ""popular"" thing to be is pro-feminist. So, instead of speaking up on why they are against it, they'd just rather accept that and move on with their lives. It sucks because blindly following a popular trend doesn't get much accomplished in a society. It's an echo chamber for the people who are really adamant on the cause, and an annoyance to most others. Debate and analyzing the pros and cons of a movement is how real progress is done."

And while I agree that people should be able to think for themselves without having to worry about others, there is a clear purpose to that. People do that because they don't want to get into arguments with others over their beliefs. They aren't so much worried about how people think of them, they are more worried about loosing valuable friends who just happen to hold a contradictory belief. I know from example. I hold some pretty strong beliefs that very few of my friends share, but I never argue with them cause I'm worried that I'll be alone when all is said and done. Humans are a pack species. Since the dawn of time, we've lived in tight-knit communal groups that supported one another to survive. So being alone is one of the worst feelings to us.  That being said, I have to commend scientists like Darwin and Galileo even more for being so brave. They fought against the flow and were made outcasts by their society. Still, they held strong and were not recognized for it for years."

I think it's ridiculous that people don't agree with science because their peers don't. Whatever the decision, there is no right or wrong. Everyone is entitled to a decision and science is there to support what you don't and do believe.

There isn't a single person who doesn't look up to someone else for guidance, or at least hasn't at some point. It's only saddening that we as people have such a strong aversion to adversity that we feel the need to compromise our own thoughts for the sake of someone else's acceptance.

This stood out because it made a great point: that it's okay to question science if you use science to back it up. Asking questions is how science was created. Galileo was ridiculed for his beliefs about space, but he ended up being right. It's when people doubt science without having a reason to, like people who think vaccines cause autism after many studies have proven it doesn't, or people who think GMO's are unsafe when it's been proven that they are safe.

Don't count for weekly participation points.  DISCUSSION STARTER: What was the quote or bullet point that made the biggest impact?  Why was this point so impactful?  What impact did it have, and why?   To get you started... Quotes that stood out to me in particular were:   Scientific thinking has to be taught, and sometimes it’s not taught well, McNutt says. Students come away thinking of science as a collection of facts, not a method. Shtulman’s research has shown that even many college students don’t really understand what evidence is. The scientific method doesn’t come naturally—but if you think about it, neither does democracy. For most of human history neither existed. We went around killing each other to get on a throne, praying to a rain god, and for better and much worse, doing things pretty much as our ancestors did.   Another quote that follows the same vien, perhaps showing the point of the article as a whole...   “Science is not a body of facts,” says geophysicist Marcia McNutt, who once headed the U.S. Geological Survey and is now editor of Science, the prestigious journal. “Science is a method for deciding whether what we choose to believe has a basis in the laws of nature or not.” But that method doesn’t come naturally to most of us.  The idea that hundreds of scientists from all over the world would collaborate on such a vast hoax is laughable—scientists love to debunk one another.   It's true.  Scientists love proving each other wrong.  And Finally:    Shtulman’s research indicates that as we become scientifically literate, we repress our naive beliefs but never eliminate them entirely. They lurk in our brains, chirping at us as we try to make sense of the world.   That last one sparks the most questioning: Do you still hold beliefs, erroneous as they may be, even though we discussed and proved them otherwise in class?  For instance: Objects falling at the same rate regardless of mass, or gravity on the moon or in space, etc.?"
PhascinatingPhysics,36im5c,ATB_WHSPhysics,2,Tue May 19 18:10:42 2015 UTC,"I must agree that the quote: ""Shtulman’s research indicates that as we become scientifically literate, we repress our naive beliefs but never eliminate them entirely.

It started out with humanity shining science which is where I believe the whole mess starts, you believed in science and you get called a heretic and that had been a major factor in the acceptence and fear of science. People taking what you believe and proving it wrong plays a major part as well. Imagine being set in your ways and whole heartedly believing that they are true and a man or women comes along to prove it wrong and that everything you believed in might have been false. This major side of things give people a hesitant view of science. As for the fear well we can do so much with science, such as but not limited to create explosions that destroy cities, biological weapons that kill thousands we can create ways of causing such unnatural violence and destruction it scares people even though we know science can also help people."

But that method doesn't come naturally to most of us."" Science is not a thing humans are born to do. Our ancient ancestors back in 2015 BC never once thought about how our world works. It just did. To them, life was more about the struggle to survive rather than answering questions. So when someone finally did decide to do some research, its up to the reader, and partially the researcher themselves, to decide whether or not its true. It's impossible for the average man to see almost all of these groundbreaking processes like the Earth's shape or an animal evolving. So, if you want to believe it, you only have the word of some guy and some numbers you have no idea where they came from. Not a very convincing story... Luckily, we are at a point in society where it has become a lot easier for people to accept new ideas. It also helps that we have all sorts of machinery that makes things, both massive and microscopic, pretty easy to see.  One thing I still have trouble believing is the motion of planets while in elliptical orbits. I don't understand why planets move faster while close to the sun, but slow down when they get farther away. I get energy and gravity are involved, but in my mind it makes little to no sense. So it's just one of those things I accept as facts without understanding. Why? Well everyone else thinks that it works this way, so even if I don't, I'm gonna have to regurgitate it in order to get a good grade on the test. It goes back to older ways of thinking, I can't see the planets moving right in front of me or feel the forces acting on them so I cannot judge their motion for myself."

Science is a method because it works to explain things. I remember my 9th grade science teacher telling us that everything she is teaching us now could later be proven to be wrong. That blew my mind. I felt like she was lying to us. But now I realize that science is a way to explain things in the universe, and those explanations may or may not be entirely correct. I thought that was cool because it makes science seem like the answer to our questions, even though it is not a guaranteed correct answer.

When I mentioned to Kahan that I fully accept evolution, he said, “Believing in evolution is just a description about you. It’s not an account of how you reason.“""  YES YES YES! Now, I am not saying that I'm a religious fundamentalist, nor that I don't believe in 100% of what the scientific community has to say. However, I think about what the given information and evidence is before I make a decision of whether I want to believe it or not. What really angers me are people that do not do so. They accept anything and everything that scientists spit out, even if that information has very little support. As a matter of fact, many people believe controversial scientific news headlines EVEN after they have been proven wrong. Great example of this phenomenon occurred today: So, basically, a particle moving faster than the speed of light was ""discovered"" in the collider in Switzerland. Everyone who read this news article went on believing it, despite the fact that it wasn't actually true. Later on, a new article was written about how there was a calculations/measurement error and that the particle didn't really go as fast. However, people continued believing that and spreading misinformation. Thus, moral of the story is: have some common sense and think about what people are telling you. Make sure to check their evidence (and math, hah) before you go on believing it.   As for still holding on to wrong beliefs - yes, I still am. I simply cannot get over the fact that objects travelling further up in orbit move slower than objects travelling closer to the Earth. I mean... I know that it should make sense, but it just doesn't. The higher object must have a greater velocity in order to circle around more distance. But it somehow doesn't. I am perplexed and always will be."

For example, most people by now know that Pluto is no longer a planet, but since we all grew up learning that it was a planet, some people have not fully taken it to heart and changed their entire belief; deep down inside some people still want to believe that what they learned as a child is still correct."

The entire analogy really drew a picture for me that perhaps the teaching questions are true. That the only way to totally understand science is to implement it early, often, and correctly to ensure a general understanding and belief. But in contrast what this analogy doesn't mention is the idea that democracy came as the world changed and called for more order to control the freedoms and thoughts of the people. Likewise, maybe science has to change enormously to catch our attention. I believe that we are in the midst of that change and many can agree that our focus on research has boomed lately and will only lead to a truer understanding of the topic."

In contrast, people with a “hierarchical” and “individualistic” mind-set respect leaders of industry and don’t like government interfering in their affairs; they’re apt to reject warnings about climate change, because they know what accepting them could lead to—some kind of tax or regulation to limit emissions.""  This quote stood the most out to me because I sort of noticed this trend but lacked the ability to express or expand my idea. People choose to live either selfishly or unselfishly, with the extremes being pure communism and pure monarchical. They share everything or nothing. Those that share everything worry about everything, they care far too much cause guess what, their stuff is at stake too. Those that share, nothing care for nothing and see events that effect others and not themselves as unmeaningful. While most people don't operate on the extremes you can still see their reactions on which side they stand by using a toy. If you make three kids share a toy, they all have a stake and they all try to play with it and care for it. If you give each kid their own toy they'll play with their toy with disregard for the other kids' toys, if one's toy breaks the other two will feel bad but not likely share as it puts their toy in jeopardy.   This stays with you for life. Your gut reactions as a kid are your gut reactions as an adult, you know where you stand, to a degree, as a child.

PhascinatingPhysics,36cy92,RFD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue May 19 11:27:45 2015 UTC,"Ignaz Semmelweis:       Ignaz Philipp Semmelweis  (born Semmelweis Ignác Fülöp; 1 July 1818 – 13 August 1865) was a Hungarian physician of German extraction   now known as an early pioneer of antiseptic procedures. Described as the ""savior of mothers"", Semmelweis discovered that the incidence of puerperal fever (also known as ""childbed fever"") could be drastically cut by the use of hand disinfection in obstetrical clinics. Puerperal fever was common in mid-19th-century hospitals and often fatal, with mortality at 10%–35%. Semmelweis proposed the practice of washing hands with chlorinated lime solutions in 1847 while working in Vienna General Hospital's First Obstetrical Clinic, where doctors' wards had three times the mortality of midwives' wards.  He published a book of his findings in Etiology, Concept and Prophylaxis of Childbed Fever.

The idea of evolution was so radical during its time because it contradicted so heavily with many religious groups and their beliefs that God is the ultimate creator. The entire concept of divine life was tarnished to many people when Darwin asserted that humans were merely evolve dates, and were much closer to animals than people previously recognized. Debate still continues to wage on today as religions have trouble incorporating what is often seem as fact within the creation and evolution theories of Darwin."

The square root of two comes up so much more often than I thought. I always just thought of it when dealing with 45-45-90 triangles and the square root of two being the hypotenuse. Using this pythagora, people are able to understand the square root of two better when using the ratios of a piece of paper. The video alludes to multiple different paths on how to get to the ratio. However, there is only one reference to why you shouldn't pee towards the sun. Because they were obviously right about the square root of two, maybe not peeing toward the sun is a good idea."

Sure some points in the video were interesting, but overall i did not really enjoy it.

The math didn't seem all too fancy to me, it seemed pretty straightforward, although the second proof seemed a little bit like he was manipulating the proof willy nilly to serve his own purposes. When he made A = 2C I had to ask why and how he was able to do that, given the parameters of the equation. Maybe there's just something I'm missing regarding proof writing.

If we have been taught that something is true for ages and have a strong belief in it's proof, it's going to be nearly impossible to convince us that it is actually wrong. I feel like we see this on a smaller scale in Physics class. For example, we're taught that gravity on earth is equal to about 9.8 m/s2 , however if one studies gravitation it is clear that the number is simply an estimate based on an average radius of the earth and other factors. Because someone is taught this and it becomes so ingrained in their head, it's hard to tell them down the road that gravity is not exact. Heck, with the advances and theories bouncing around today we barely know if matter is a thing. Ever try to explain to someone with minimal knowledge of Physics and Chemistry that nothing really ever touches? They'll think you're insane. Go back a little further in time to when no one really understood science that well and it's perfectly reasonable to assume you would've been locked up in some asylum. I say that we should always keep our minds open and never shut out ideas that work, even if we originally don't understand what they are.

When a new family comes in, a new dynasty begins. Anyway, the first dynasty was the Xia dynasty, except it wasn't. Because it didn't exist. The Zhou dynasty basically made them up so they could say that the Xia lost the ""mandate of heaven"" for taking part in un-emperorly activities. The mandate of heaven is heaven's blessing for the emperor to be the emperor, and it is maintained as long as they act properly. Anyhow, the fact that the Xia dynasty was made up so that another dynasty could make up the ""mandate of heaven"" (which they did to justify why emperors are destined to lose their place and why uprisings/natural disasters often occur when there is a change in dynasty - it's all very cyclical), I think, is a good example of governments hiding knowledge from its people."

However, bragging tangles with the world of arrogance, which is no longer being self-confident, but reducing the confidence of others because yours is so large."

Like for the ""running a marathon"" reference for example, we all want to post about everything we do... personally I wouldn't have thought of it as a brag but I could see how some people could perceive it that way. We might post something when we are happy or excited, not necessarily looking for praise, but it can certainly come off that way."

As a matter of fact, most things I've bragged about have turned out to not happen. I have no idea why this happens, but my grandma theorizes that people's jealousy, anger, and negative energies, stemming from your apparent success, seem to be transferred to you and impede you from achieving further success. Bottom line: don't brag. Unless it's your mom, dad, grandmother, or grandfather, nobody else will care."

In 1992 we shared 100 gigabytes of data a day while in 2013 that number rose to 28,000 gigabytes per second so I can only imagine what it’s like in 2015. I never considered that all this information has to be stored somewhere, so it’s stored by massive data centers. In 2013, we used 91 billion kilowatt hours of energy for these centers which is a lot of energy. The fact that they must be running nonstop, causes them to waste up to 90% of the energy they consume which isn’t good for the environment."
PhascinatingPhysics,364ekc,KRT_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sat May 16 01:02:07 2015 UTC,"So after reading the article I did the math (shocking I know) but in 2013 we used 2.419 exabytes of data per day. For those who are not so storage savvy an exabyte is 1000 petabytes, a petabyte is 1000 terabytes, and a terabyte is 1000 gigabytes. Which means we use about 2.4 billion gigabytes a day. To top that, the storage devices used to house these (also known as servers) waste 90% of the energy they use. So to wrap it up we take up a ton space and use a ton of power just to be able to have internet 24/7."

Very few countries, none that I know, would ever be willing to give up taxable land without someone paying some ridiculously high price for it.

Recall that {PoP!}s are worth 15 points, awarded for this {PoP!} as follows:   4 points for your thoughtful reaction/response to the original video 4 points for your thoughtful answer to discussion starter 4 points for first meaningful and worthwhile comment that adds to the discussion at hand (Comments such as ""hey, yeah, I agree"" or ""yeah, this was cool"" will not count as meaningful nor worthwhile as they do not add to the discussion in a meaningful or worthwhile way.) 3 points for second meaningful and worthwhile comment   Remember that PoPs! Don't count for weekly participation points.  DISCUSSION STARTER: What do you think?  Do you think the award was given to the correct party?  If so, why?  If not, why not?  Better yet, can you think of a sci-fi version of artifical gravity that might be better than the winner given here?  Why is it better?"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,CJHB_HPhysics_5,1 point,Thu May 14 17:47:52 2015 UTC,"I think I agree with him that Halo got gravity the most correct. The realistic integrity of the Babylon  spacecraft was shot for me when he pointed out that the ships simply dropped out of the bottom of the ship in a straight line. Halo has no problems with its motion or gravity itself, just the mass, so it is the least flawed. I wish I knew of other artificial gravity systems in movies or entertainment but I don't!"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 02:27:44 2015 UTC,Halo indeed gets the award. Not because I have played every one of its games and am a huge fan. The concept behind the rings and the math having actually been done out makes it seem to be the most scientifically accurate model for an artificial gravity setup. Now about the composition as far as I know the halo games and books do not mention how thick the rings are which could get around the mass issues with it and could be man made.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JHF_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Fri May 15 03:53:33 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: From the information given in the video, I think Halo deserves the award. Everything was physically correct, and while the material required is not feasible, it is technically possible. This appears to be more accurate than the other alternatives. Halo also reassured me because they hired professional help."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JCM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 13:47:21 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree that Halo would get the award due to the fact that it was said that they hired people to do the math for them so that their concept was scientifically sound. As much as I like the idea of a cylinder with artificial gravity, it doesn't seem as practical"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,KJH_WHSphysics,1 point,Thu May 14 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"I agree, it seems that a movie/game that hires people to do the math for them should show artificial gravity the best.  Other movies may not realize that their measurements are unrealistic. Halo was smart in having people do the math. I wonder if more movies and games will do this now."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JHF_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Fri May 15 01:06:51 2015 UTC,"I would be surprised if they do- most Hollywood movie producers seem not to care too much about the science and care more about making money, but this definitely a possibility. However I was happy with the mostly scientific correctness in Interstellar."

PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,jmm_apphysics1,1 point,Fri May 15 01:33:43 2015 UTC,You see you are the type of person that would be into the game. But for some people the graphics are half the fun of playing. If it doesn't look like it's real when someone falls or when the planets orbit with rings it takes away from the image of the game
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,KSF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 12:17:46 2015 UTC,"Though i agree that it is the most plausible that halo got it right because they had professionals do the math (which is incredibly surprising considering how old the game is that they would put such effort into their production), it is still possible that they got it wrong. Im cynical about the whole thing"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,SAM_WHSPhysics,3,Fri May 15 16:03:37 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: As a former avid Halo player I must say I agree with the decision. Halo perfects what artificial gravity should be. Aesthetically, the characters bouncing looks exactly how Id imagine normal gravity to be. Especially with the precision in design of it."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,BAG_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu May 14 23:08:20 2015 UTC,I have to disagree with you slightly on this one. I think the game portrays the characters with less gravity due to the higher jumps in the game. Wouldn't earth's gravity of 9.81 only allow them to jump a couple feet tops?
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,15rd_WHS,1 point,Fri May 15 04:56:28 2015 UTC,I would have to agree with you because higher jumps would ultimately mean less gravity which isn't completely realistic. I agree that 9.81 m/s would only allow us to jump a little
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JHF_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Fri May 15 12:09:30 2015 UTC,"Im not familiar with Halo, so i don't know if it says that it uses Earth's gravity or not, however this doesn't really make the atrificial Gravity less realistic. It's possible that within the game they just use a different (smaller) gravity strength to make game play more interesting"

I think that of the list presented they came closest, however i highly doubt it was perfected. Though i cant really conceptiualize what it would be like in artifocial gravity, i would assume that even those who can conceptualize it can only do that; they wouldnt be able to get it perfect"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,MRD_WHSPhysics,2,Fri May 15 16:05:22 2015 UTC,"This video brings in a whole new insight about the artificial gravity debate. Agreeing with the man in the video, I think that Halo did the best job in constructing the most realistic anti-gravitational effect. Although I hate the Halo franchise (Im a PS3 household), I was shocked to see how much they had gotten correct when depicting this effect."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,2,Thu May 14 20:44:16 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: Yes, I believe that Halo deserved to in the ward for most accurately depicting the effects of gravity.Before watching this video, I would have originally given it to 2001, but after seeing that the physics in it was busted, I had to give it to Halo. I am curious... Do you think that the human race would ever be able to gather that much mass in order to create a Halo-like atmosphere? It astounds me."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JCM_WHSPhysics,2,Thu May 14 20:46:27 2015 UTC,The human race would in fact be able to gather enough mass to do such a thing particularly since the halo rings are not given a specific thickness which means they could be made of largest mass material humans know of and still fall within the required radius parameters for a viable floating station that could contain an atmosphere and produce artificial gravity.

PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 00:09:53 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point. Although Halo technically didn't have any scientific concepts incorrect, I think it was the most unrealistic. I don't see how it's possible to get a 5000km atmosphere and then have as much mass as the astroid belt, it just seems impossible. So for that reason I think Halo was a close 2nd, but I had Babylon 5 as the winner."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,SKS_APPhysics_6,1 point,Fri May 15 02:19:18 2015 UTC,The answer to your question is the thickness of the ring in a 3-dimensional view. You could use the materials with the largest masses then it is theoretically possible to do such a thing and keep within the requirements to sustain a viable field of artificial gravity and maintain an atmosphere.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 04:05:40 2015 UTC,You are thinking about as of present times. Halo is set in the future where all of this can be possible. The future is the future. Maybe they found the way to make a very large concentration of mass in the middle of the system?
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 14:04:49 2015 UTC,False!!! It is entirely realistic. While you look at the halo rings in a 2-dimensional way of spinning the thickness of the rings is not specified so we could create a ring and keep with in the requirements.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,med_whsphysics,1 point,Fri May 15 04:01:08 2015 UTC,Now fun fact about the game is that humans didn't create the rings but it stands to reason that yes it would be entirely possible. Scientific advancements are made every year and who knows a material that could have such a large mass that we could create a halo ring setup could happen soon or not at all.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,KGH_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 03:59:11 2015 UTC,"i felt the same way, i thought 2001 did a good job until i watched this video. 2001 did not do a great job with the physics. Halo definitely deserved the award."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JR_WHSPhysics,0,Fri May 15 00:57:24 2015 UTC,After re-watching part of the video I believe Halo also did a good job dealing with the artificial gravity. Halo was able to balance the correct ring size and the mechanical stresses. The only thing wrong with halo is that is it huge.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,2,Thu May 14 21:12:00 2015 UTC,This is why I disagree with the award. Why was the most realistic artificial gravity award given to something so large that humans could not build it. That does not seem realistic at all.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,BAG_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 00:10:11 2015 UTC,Humans could build it. That is the issue with your thought process here. It is entirely possible that humans could build a ring of the required parameters to generate a viable field of artificial gravity.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 04:07:59 2015 UTC,"I feel that the sheer size and magnitude of the ring is what makes it seem impossible to build currently. Obviously we don't have anywhere near the manpower to build a halo ring, but I'm just not sure we ever will have it or the design and ingenuity to make it. The ring would require such massive amounts of effort, work, materials and other supplies that I don't think it could ever be assembled."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,ker_whsphysics,1 point,Fri May 15 04:59:46 2015 UTC,Well if the planet ever needs a station that can hold an entire population and substitute as a planet until a future planet is found then it is a viable solution and if we had the time we might make one. But yes it is probably the shape and size that make it seem immopssible to us because we have never seen anything built on that scale before and as such believe it impossible to happen.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,JR_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 11:31:45 2015 UTC,I think it is important to give Halo credit from their experimentation with artificial gravity because of how precise they made it be. As not a huge gamer or movie addict I don't have the most credible opinion but it is important to consider accuracy and effectiveness to the audience.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,ncs_whsphysics,1 point,Fri May 15 01:25:56 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: The only problem with the Babylon 5 artificial gravity was the rotational speed of the space station, other than that it was completely correct as stated in the video. Halo got everything completely right but the structure was almost impossible to make. I don't think Halo should have gotten the award due to this factor.  Despite the award being given to the wrong franchise, I did enjoy this video. The animations were done well and the math wasn't overwhelming. The guy did talk kind of fast though, but I guess it was fine because the video was already 11 minutes long."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,SmL_APPhysics1_6,2,Fri May 15 00:03:55 2015 UTC,"If you don't think Halo should have won because it is basically impossible (as of now) to make an atmosphere like Halo, do you think Babylon 5 should have won?  Although it is impossible to build a Halo-like atmosphere now, Halo did get everything right and for that reason I disagree with you and think Halo should still be given the award.  I agree that the math wasn't overwhelming but it was hard to follow because he talked pretty fast."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,jmm_apphysics1,1 point,Fri May 15 03:29:18 2015 UTC,"believe that Halo still should have gotten the award (not saying thatbecause im a fanboy, i didn't even play halo as a kid) because the award was for how realistic the gravity was not the structure which the gravity acted on."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 02:47:54 2015 UTC,This is a very valid point. People have to realize what the actually award was about. If we wanted to see if the satellite was most realistic there would be an award for that. Gravity is a tricky subject to work with in cases like this where it's technically not real. If people are thinking of building this structure from halo it'll take a lot.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,med_whsphysics,1 point,Fri May 15 12:21:47 2015 UTC,What says the ring couldn't be made by humans? It has a scientifically viable build. Now it may not be identical to the one there but it is possible.

The idea that most movies and shows do artificial gravity wrong was surprising to say the least. My guess was that they tried to make it look plausible but at the same time keep the movie / show appeal. Prior to this video I have never heard of Ringworld, 2001, or Babylon 5. I do however know about Halo. As a note to the video creator: There are no flaws in Halo."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,CJHB_HPhysics_5,1 point,Fri May 15 00:27:17 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: I think Halo receiving the award is great. I have a critique with the video in the fact that jumping on the ring gets you to a much higher altitude than on Earth, but I think the suit might explain that a bit. Though I had an issue with the fact that the video creator only tested the artificial gravity from Halo's ring from the first game. He seemed to of neglected the ships and other structures that appear throughout the Halo series that have artificial gravity. I personally cannot think of anything that has better realistic artificial gravity."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 00:31:40 2015 UTC,"That's a great point, hadn't thought of that! I think it would be interesting to see a time line and break down of all the different ships throughout the generations of the game. I imagine that it strays further away from realistic physics principles as the generations go on."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,med_whsphysics,1 point,Fri May 15 02:36:20 2015 UTC,That would in fact be very cool however issue is that the halo rings may be scientifically accurate the ships most likely are not. The regular build of the rings is viable as proven by the video but in the game they were not created by the human race. The actual ships do not have the proper movements to actually generate artificial gravity (from my understanding) this is leaving out ones like the shield worlds and high charity both of which are massive planet like object that would most likely be viable for this kind of breakdown. However the human ships would not. The covenant ships also would not.

I did like how the video explained why we stay stuck to the wall on rides that go around quickly in circles. We learned about the forces acting on people on those rides in class today, so this reinforced what we learned. I like how this video applies to what we are learning. I wish I've seen some sci-fi/artificial gravity movies so I could judge these movies.  Discussion Starter: I do not know much about artificial gravity movies so I don't really know which of these movies/games is the best, but from watching this video I would have to say Halo did the best job portraying artificial gravity.  The game had a good ring size and the halo would stay in tact with such a large radius. At .015 RPM the coriolis effect would be undetectable. I do not know a sci-fi version of artificial gravity that might be better than the winner given here."
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,SKS_APPhysics_6,1 point,Fri May 15 01:04:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I can see how one who is not as submerged in anything involving artificial gravity would find this video confusing. I wish that they had drawn from a larger source, rather than only 3 (however I knew they narrowed down the list to films that focused on rotation). I wish they had gone into greater detail explaining why exactly the other method was so flawed"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,BNB_HPhysics_4,1 point,Fri May 15 01:45:07 2015 UTC,I have a similar feeling with my little experience with the movies and games but halo does have a lot of aspects of the artificial gravity correct.

As I was watching the video, I kept thinking about interstellar and how their spaceship had used circular motion for their artificial gravity. Why didn't PBS Space Time mention interstellar? since the video was published 4/29/15?  Discussion starter: The award given to Halo was deserving, the halo installation made sense but I can see why people would not think it was deserving because it's difficultly to be made.

Furthermore, the clarification on circles and gravity's function within them was very clear to understand. And not trying to be mean or anything, but the speaker's lisp got to me a little bit.

I also agree with mass and construction not being that big of a deal.  What significance would building a Halo-like structure serve to the community?"
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,DES_WHSPhysics,1 point,Fri May 15 03:37:27 2015 UTC,The halo rings were created by an alien race called forerunners to be the ark. You know a giant ship to save entire species from global or gloating disaster as happened in the books and games where entire species were being wiped out by war and a parasitic creature called the flood. They also functioned as galactic weapons of mass destruction.  Now in real life an ark would be a plausible reason. An artificial home also be plausible. A place to move over populating countries or people to. The halo rings are a concept that could be used in the situation where we don't find any planets to move to.
PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,SmL_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Fri May 15 04:25:22 2015 UTC,The mass is not that far off Thinking in 3-dimensional ways you could create a ring on this size layered up to the point where such a mass was possible.

DISCUSSION STARTER: I think that the award was gien to the right franchise. seeing that a Halo could be mader out of a material as commomn and obtainable as steel makes it very practicle, the only problem would be constructing the structure. due to  the lack of sci-fi in my life i can not think of another frenchise which simulated graity better than halo."

I remember watching a documentary on military sniping from a helicopter and how the motion from the helicopter effects where the bullet goes.  If the helicopter is moving forwards, aiming at the target won't actually cause you to hit it but shoot in front of it.  This means in order to hit the target you need to shoot behind it so the bullet is traveled forwards by the helicopters motion.  The effects on gravity are also very interesting.  It made a lot of sense when he described how getting up too fast would cause you to fall over and how moving your head side to side very fast would cause you to get dizzy due to the rotation of the object you are in."

These include falling over when standing up and getting dizzy when turning your head.  Babylon was also wrong in which it was a little too fake.  When the space craft was rotating and released smaller crafts, the smaller ones fell straight down instead of being shot out due to the rotation.  Halo was a well rounded game that gave the most realistic artificial gravity because of it's rotational speed and the help of Kevin Grazier.

Although I have experienced this theory and know what it is, I never really thought about how it worked. Nor did I think it to be related in any way to artificial gravity.   Discussion starter:  Nevertheless, after all the descriptions and flaws pointed out in each movie/game, I do agree that halo is the most correct.

Furthermore, the other ones seemed too flawed, for example, in 2001, when the guy runs around and they say he should tip over i agree with that.

PhascinatingPhysics,35yvfn,RP_APPhysics_6,0,Fri May 15 00:16:07 2015 UTC,I agree that portal had a pretty good idea of gravity and momentum. I also analyze science in games but I focus on whether or not there are any and what are their limits.

But this video was interesting enough in its explanation of artificial gravity.  I remember going on rides like the one mentioned in the video. I felt pressed down and unable to move. It makes more sense now thinking back on it. Your body tends to fly straight off, but the wall exerts a force on you to keep turning. Halo is also a great game.

I won't go near Interstellar as I've heard there are quite a few instances where it just isn't realistic. It's pretty mind blowing to think how much goes into designing a game or movie. I had no idea how much thought designers put into accuracy of the script. I wonder how off/on Star Wars is on the subject of artificial gravity. I would think somewhat more inaccurate due to the requirements of a movie to appeal to an audience rather then get all the facts straight.

The star ships (discounting fighters) usually have some sort of gravity generator. When in games these can be broken, once this occurs all occupants start drifting unless they have some sort of propulsion. As for planetary gravity in Star Wars I am unsure but most planets that you see in movies and can explore in games seem to have gravity on par with Earth's."

When the guy goes into the fifth parallel he kind of just floats there and flys from one place to another and it gets all jumbled up. As for Star Wars I feel as if they don't use much artificial gravity. The characters always seem to be on a flat surface and never float around (from what I recall at least). None the less I agree that Halo is the best choice. From my experience playing the game, it definitely uses artificial gravity very well."

So some technological feat of science is able to somehow ""create"" gravity on the ships.  Interstellar works well talking about the relativistic effects of time dilation due to incredibly high speeds when orbiting massive objects (and time compression when high in a gravitational field).    However, this is talking about artificial gravity, which in Interstellar was when they were in their ship.  Interstellar's artificial gravity worked similarly to 2001, and I think would be subject to the same effects described in the video.  (Small enough ships that while rotating to produce artificial gravity Coriolis forces would make moving around awkward)."

After all it’s science fiction, so it’s meant to be fake so by saying all how unlikely each scenario is, it takes away from people’s imagination that this could one day become reality. For example, for the Halo scenario to work, it would need the mass of the asteroid belt which is probably impossible.

Being honest I may have given up attempting to understand it after about page 4. While it's disgusting, I find it interesting that some day I may be able to do that. I feel as though being shown this math is akin to walking into math class with derivatives, integrals and odds and ends of letters scribbled on the board. When I was a freshman, that looked super scary. Now it looks super simple. I can only imagine that after a period of time, that will look... not super simple but at the very least manageable. On the nature of physics: students need to be taught to crawl before they can walk, walk before they can run. This paper is a version of sprinting, where we're still in the walking stages. There are so many outside forces that need to be accounted for in anything that gets done that we hardly ever take into account. The ""friction-less plane"" where we ""neglect air resistance"" does not exist. There are bumps on the plane that make things difficult.

At first I thought they would both hit the ground at the same time, since g = 9.8 m/s2 for everything on Earth and this makes sense. Then I considered that since F=ma, the mass of the chained weight would be changing as it falls, and that would slow the descent of the chained weight.

The weight is constantly increasing because of the weight of the chain that is going over the edge and joining the ""fall"". It is also almost as if there is a sort of tension between the weight landing on the ground and the weight in the glass so that at some point, the force and acceleration reaches a max.

My only concern is if we have to take into account the weighted rod or if the tension applied changes over time. Baby steps, I guess."

I wonder why exactly this is that it has to be only a certain length in between the links. This is one of the parts of this that I understand the least. I feel like the length between the links is what makes it more rigid and thus the motion of it falling is more drastic  but I can't really wrap my head around it too much. I can only really think of it as the fact that if the length between links was too large, it would just be like a flimsy string but besides that I can't understand how this comes into play in the physics/ math."

I find it great that something as complex as chain whipping with physics and calculus can be explained in a simple 3 minute video.

Even the best physicists are always learning and the reason why I feel like it is so complex is because it is so real and present in everything so there are always novel situations that people have to explain. Although we practically recite ""9.8 m/s2 downwards"" ever since Ms. Whitner told us last year, I never have actually thought about why this is true or how it was proved."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,NMS_HAstronomy_7,1 point,Thu May 14 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Response: I thought, like a lot of people, that the objects would fall at the same time. I was thinking about an example from last year when the two objects did fall at the same time when I was trying to decide what was going to happen. I didn't originally take into consideration that the chain would pull down on the weight and make the object fall faster. But now that I think back about the physics concepts from last year this situation does make a lot of sense."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,BAJ_7Hastro,1 point,Thu May 14 02:40:20 2015 UTC,"I thought this video was simple yet really interesting! I had predicted that the chain and the weight would fall faster but I was not exactly sure why. I thought it might fall faster at first because the excess chain below it would pull it down, and it would slow down at some point because the chain would be extended and pulling back up on this, but according to the answer video it is the opposite. It's really cool to see how the tension going upwards actually pulls it down!"
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,BAJ_7Hastro,1 point,Thu May 14 02:40:56 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: That math looks so difficult, I can barely understand statistics so this math goes completely over my head. The basic concepts that are applied to typical high school physics problems seem to cancel out a lot of factors that heavily impact real life scenarios. Physics can become so complex, you need to take every condition into consideration when doing the math to figure out a problem. I find it amazing that there are people out there that are able to figure out really hard problems and use initial basic knowledge of physics to find solutions."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,DDI_APPhysicsC,1 point,Thu May 14 02:50:48 2015 UTC,"I got it right but for the wrong reason. I said the chain because it was heavier. I n hindsight, the actual explanation makes more sense than mine, seeing as I made the stupid mistake of forgetting that weight doesn't matter. I though it was pretty funny how he went bungee jumping, but I'm kind of confused on that one. Do bungee cords have a similar shape/build to chains?"
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,HTM_APPhysics,1 point,Thu May 14 02:52:09 2015 UTC,"Discussion starter. What this tells me about physics is that I made the right decision dropping it before my first class last year. This is far too confusing for me to handle. It's absolutely gross. I am not very good at fathoming such complexities in my head. I just cannot keep track of it all. What this tells me is that physics makes everything harder than it has to be... But in order to solve it. If that makes any sense. It reminds me of that quote from pirates of the carribean. ""You have to be truly lost to find something that can't be found, else wise everybody would know where it is."" You have to be truly out there to solve a problem that has no answer otherwise there'd already be an answer."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,HTM_APPhysics,1 point,Thu May 14 03:29:22 2015 UTC,"Reaction/response: Omg that was so cool very interesting video, never knew that. Jk. When he first asked us the question of which weight we think would fall to the ground first, I immediately thought that it would be the tethered weight. However, it was another reason that made me think that: I thought that the mass of the chain would actually add on to the total mass of the system and thus cause that weight to fall faster. In other words, I assumed that since the chain was underneath the weight, it would somehow pull down on it. I suppose my prediction was not that far from the actual explanation.   Discussion Starter: Throughout the course of this year, I realized one very important thing: physics gets harder the more you know. Although all these Greek characters and Cyrillic symbols and Armenian scribbles are probably intended to denote different constants (instead of using say, C0 - C10) and to prevent confusion,  they still make me sick. I have always wondered (and will continue to do so) about this: Who is gonna read all of this? I know it's written for scientific purposes, but... why can't they make it understandable to the general population? We have essentially taken the 1st year of college physics, and yet here we are, sitting here and scratching our heads over something that is probably not even that hard to understand. At any rate, as I mentioned earlier, physics can get tricky. This is demonstrated well with the chain example. The deeper we endeavor into the physics world, the more complex problems and solutions become. I have a feeling that physics will soon reach a level that will require new calculus or math to be invented. It's always one step ahead of the game."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,jas_hastro_7,1 point,Thu May 14 03:36:25 2015 UTC,Reaction/Response: I predict that the weights will hit the ground at the same time. I think this because everything should accelerate at -9.8 m/s/s. I feel like the mass of the chain may be an added force(?) rather than just added mass which will pull the chained weight down quicker (because the net acceleration will be greater than 9.8).
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,jas_hastro_7,1 point,Thu May 14 05:13:30 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: AHHHHH that math!! I want to cry! That being said, the Gibney article was totally helpful. I loved how this was explained by momentum rather than force. My mind is blown that the chain ""jumps"" before gravity can catch it. How does that happen!?!? That totally goes against what we've learned, that gravity works on everything all the time."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,jas_hastro_7,1 point,Thu May 14 11:54:20 2015 UTC,The catch is that it doesn't go against everything you've learned.  It's just that the application of lots of little tidbits of physics add up to crazy end results.

Whether its theory or law, there is always an explanation for anything hidden out there. Except ghosts. Ghosts are spoopy."
PhascinatingPhysics,35ttji,ATP_APPhysics,1 point,Thu May 14 15:42:06 2015 UTC,"I thought the chain drop experiment was neat. I liked how it made you choose an answer before redirecting you to the actual result, I thought that it was trying to trick people that a more massive object would fall faster and he was teaching simple physics foundations. To my surprise he demonstrated in the experiment how the tension on the chain is pulling up on the object, causing the end with the mass to fall down... I never would have considered that a simple application of Newton's Laws would have to be considered. This just shows how many applications can be applied to a simple falling weight, with gravity, tension, possibly even air resistance. It's simply phascinating... and sometimes annoying..."

A lot of people seem to have this idea that they were predestined to do what they do. They often times throw contingency out the window and claim some social darwinist mumbo jumbo about personality and that some people are ""just better at this than others"". It's not true. People don't pop out of the womb with good fashion sense, or knowing calculus; instead there are some very small differences in genetic traits that account for early cognitive development, but the differences in these extrapolated into adulthood are very little. When you see someone who is a ""math genius"", they aren't actually a genius. In fact, if I am to be so bold, there really isn't any such thing as a genius. People immerse themselves in something, and those that immerse themselves extremely deeply in something are labelled geniuses and assumed ""different"" in such a way as to render a replication of their efforts impossible. In truth, we are all a product of a series of circumstances and choices that we and our peers have made. When you look at anyone, even yourself, it is an important perspective to have to be able to see this contingency. To look at a drug dealer and see a college professor, or to look at a soccer player and see an accountant, is to understand just how much of a blank slate we are at birth.

PhascinatingPhysics,35fp2m,HTM_APPhysics,1 point,Sat May 9 22:21:57 2015 UTC,"To do this problem, you first need the equation for the period of a pendulum, T=2(pi)sqrt(I/(mgh)). Plug in ""0.5L-x"" for h in this equation. Then square both sides of the equation and then derive. The left side of the equation will be 2T(dt/dx) and we know that T is at its minimum value here, so (dt/dx)=0, making this whole side of the equation equal to 0. From here just solving for x should get you the answer to the first part. The second part is simply a matter of plugging your answer for the first part into the modified equation for T (that is, T=2(pi)sqrt((1/12)+(0.5L-x)2 )/(g(0.5L-x))) )."

This on the other hand is very cheap and works as god as a microscope.  I feel that by introducing this to primary schools, it will engage students in science and give them an early start on learning science.  Also, because it is cheap, if a student breaks it, it's not that big of a deal because it is easy to buy another one.  I think that over time, these will start replacing microscopes in schools, making it easier to share photos about what you are looking at with your  friends and even your teacher.

PhascinatingPhysics,34vrd7,JCM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue May 5 10:31:47 2015 UTC,"Material of a pick usually doesn't change the tone of a guitar much, it's more the strumming pattern and how hard you pick the string. But as a guitarist myself I can say that picks can make an impact on the way you play, a thicker guitar pick will result in a powder sound, while a thinner pick allows for a softer tone. One problem I hope this pick solves, swing that it is $20, is the fact that most guitar picks will slip from your fingers as you play, I hate when this happens while I'm rocking out."

What's down the other end of a pitch black hallway? video games have taken this idea and ran with it, creating some of the most terrifying horror series ever like Silent Hill, Resident Evil, and Amnesia. This video analyzes common tropes used in these landmark series and why they have such a profound effect on the player. Most of the time, it goes down to how our brains have evolved over millions of years. Unknowingly, the developers of these games have actually been taking advantage of how our brains work, as the video explains. This was a really awesome insight and makes me appreciate horror games even more than I used to."
PhascinatingPhysics,34oqcq,JF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun May 3 03:37:01 2015 UTC,"That was a really cool video. I personally have only played one horror game: Silent Hill. I quit playing after 1 day because it was kind of boring and I didn't really know what I was doing, but it was still pretty scary. The ambiance it put forth was like one in a horror movie, which you would think would be so much more frightening. The game was dark, foggy, confusing, and it made me not know where was where. Great video!"
PhascinatingPhysics,34oqcq,16JAS_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun May 3 20:45:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah the problem with a lot of old horror games is that some of their design elements are pretty archaic. The original Silent Hill and Resident Evil were plagued by bad tank controls and unclear objectives. But, even though it wasn't intended to be this way, you can almost consider these problems to better help the experience.  Imagine, you are in a foggy, lifeless town, like Silent Hill, with monsters running the streets. You have no idea where to go, and let's say you have a hard time fighting/running because of a bad leg. Wouldn't that absolutely terrify you? It's that feeling of helplessness that I think make horror games the scariest. You can't do anything, which taps into our survival instincts and tells us to take the ""flight"" option to keep you alive."
PhascinatingPhysics,34oqcq,SRJ_WHSPhysics,2,Sun May 3 22:17:02 2015 UTC,"Silent Hill 1? For sure. But for Silent Hill 2 they kept the tank controls on purpose. They kept it because it made the game a lot scarier. If you can turn on a dime you can run easily. But if it takes your character a few seconds to you start to freak out. The game even plays on this mechanic when in the basement of the Hospital you have to run away from Pyramid Head in a small maze, the camera facing towards the front of you, letting you see your coming death and not allow you to see the upcoming turns. It's horrifying and amazing."

Psychologically speaking (and yes mr p psych is a real science), game developers need to rely on what makes humans tick and what terrifies us to make a good game that will sell on the market.

PhascinatingPhysics,34oqcq,DDI_APPhysicsC,1 point,Mon May 4 02:15:37 2015 UTC,The key to making things so scary in both video games and movies is darkness. Darkness encourages the human brain and imagination to think of images could possibly feel the emptiness provided. We often think of the worst things possible and the anticipation is what drives us to think such horrible possibilities in horror settings.

To do so, the researchers looked at the squirts' velocities, arcs and initial directions, as well as the movements of the scorpions' bodies, metasomas and telsons (end of the tail before the stinger)."""

PhascinatingPhysics,34c4zi,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Thu Apr 30 12:02:20 2015 UTC,I agree that that it isn't the ultimate education tool. Technically that honor belongs to teachers (Not implying that teachers are tools) since one of the best ways to learn is from someone whom already knows how the subject works as well as knows ways to make it easier for people. Minecraft would be good as a creativity tool though.

But can it be also educational? In some schools, minecraft is used an educational tool that is able to teach variety of things such as physics, architecture and probability. Also, mods can be imported onto the pc version, and Some mods are educational as well. For example the computer crafting mod is a mod that is able you to help coding and able to write code inside the game."

PhascinatingPhysics,34c4zi,KRT_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:35:32 2015 UTC,Minecraft is the not ultimate educational tool (unfortunately). There are games based around learning that work for little kids. I can vouch for that since I was one of those kids that played them and then excelled in subjects that were in the games. As for older children (beyond elementary) going to school or learning for someone who knows a subject (that is not just a school teacher) would be better for learning.

Then we look at our Sun, unimaginably big compared to Earth. If that alone isn't enough to blow your mind, we then reside in this large solar system, and still larger galaxy we call the Milky Way. But where does the Milky Way lie? It belongs to what is known as a supercluster, named Laniakea, the Hawaiian word for immense heaven. The Milky Way is but a speck in this body.

I found it interesting how the robot moved forward and then stuck to the ground and pulled the weight behind it.  It reminded me of a suction cup where it sticks to the wall and holds up something up that is heavier than itself.

Thought it was normal that the little robot could pull a mug and some small weights but it's abilities really hit me with the 45lb. plate.

PhascinatingPhysics,346ze7,CMD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon May 4 01:39:07 2015 UTC,"This is obviously unexpected. However, when they make the comparison to an ant, it makes more sense. The way it is built is somewhat complex in order to move so much weight. It is very impressive."

I love how the more weight it's required to lift, the higher pitch the robot ""squeals"" at, which might be representative of the work it's doing. It will be interesting to see how the limits to this adhesive concept are approached, and how big of a scale this model can really approach."

I suppose we'd like to believe that we are always in control of our emotions, or at the very least the power to change them if we want to. Depression is all chemical imbalances in the brain due to environmental factors, which naturally conflicts with this idea that we can change our mood on command. It's a bit difficult to fight brain chemistry, just like its hard to fight an explosion when certain elements get acquainted. Fortunately at least, there's medication to help correct this and bring our brains back to balance."

With faster fall speeds, it allows other characters to easily get combo'd, such as Fox and Falco being suspect to chaingrabs from plenty of characters, and others like Jigglypuff floating when they get hit, making it harder to follow up with certain attacks. This faster mechanic, along with others such as carrying momentum from a dash and being able to crouch out of a slide make the metagame in Melee much quicker and arguably much more enjoyable to watch, with plenty more combos compared to Brawl and in Smash 4, while remaining more technical compared to 64."

First, understanding the flavor of the language, what 'sounds right' so that you can naturally churn out correct sentences. Then, learning about 7000 words gives you a good-functioning vocabulary to work with. That, and knowing the proper pronunciations and inflections, and you could probably be considered fluent."

Doing some math: 1 rat clears out 200 square feet, or 0.00000717401 square miles. With 10 million dollars, you could get about 1333 rats. A country like Angola (the second most land-mined country in the world, with over 10 million land mines still buried on its territory) is 481,400 square miles. So, it would take these 1333 rats 50,340,086 hours or 11,500 years (if you work 12 hours per day) to clear out the country. Lol that's a pretty long time, but 10 million dollars is literally nothing compared to the thousands of lives lost due to mine accidents or tuberculosis (a serious problem in Africa). If I'm not wrong, with 8 billion dollars, it would take 14 years. Do you see the difference? It might seem like a lot of money, but this is societal problem. 8 billion dollars could be collected rather easily for such purpose. Besides, not all of the country has land mines.

For the most part when electronics don't work there is a loose wire or bad solder. By giving it a good hit you have knocked it back into place and it will function just fine for a time, the problem will come back. Taking something apart, cleaning it, and putting back or replacing anything that is loose is more time consuming but has better results. For those who play older gaming consoles like NES and N64, blowing on the cartridge in an attempt to fix it is doing the opposite. When you blew air on the copper pins the copper tarnishes do to the oxygen and moisture in your breath. As the pins tarnish it becomes harder for the console to read the cartridge. Though it may work for a time in the long run you are doing more damage than good. I ironically now feel ashamed of myself for doing the above with my N64 games.

Jet streams interact with slower moving air similar to a river hitting the river bank. The mixing of air traveling at two different speeds causes Clear Air Turbulence. This turbulence is troublesome because it cannot be seen. Smaller planes following in the wake of larger planes with experience turbulence. Going through a storm with winds blowing in many directions also causes turbulence. Due to how the frames of planes are built they will redirect their heading in order to go to the original course. In severe turbulence those inside whom are not wearing seat belts could be thrown hard enough to get hurt. The kind of turbulence in which can dislodge an engine or snap a wing is something in which rarely happens, most travelers and pilots won't experience it in their lifetimes.

You would need superconducting lines, which would have to be cooled way below -180 °C, in order to transport electricity 100% efficiently with no loses.

PhascinatingPhysics,336wx0,imtoooldforreddit,1 point,Sun Apr 26 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"to touch on the topic of number of dimensions a little more.  there is strong evidence that the reason that gravity is an inverse square relationship to distance is because of the fact that the gravity field is expanding out in the 3d spacial dimensions in our universe. This would imply that in a universe with 2 or 4 spacial dimensions, gravity would follow an inverse and inverse cube law respectively. let's talk about each of those.  with an inverse cube law, a perfectly circular orbit is the only orbit that makes any sense. any extra force in any direction will actually cause it to spiral out and escape (a little counter intuitive, but a change in direction in would make an object gain too much speed, and then spiral out). 2 axis of rotation like the video says would make coalescing take longer, but a lack of stable orbits would make it simply not happen at all. the universe would be a large sparse cloud of hydrogen.  now let's talk about if gravity was simply an inverse relationship. a perfectly circular orbit is still the only orbit that makes any sense, and it is still unstable, but in the other extreme - absolutely everything will collapse into black holes - everywhere. since the integral of k/x to infinity never converges to a finite number, there will be no finite escape velocity in this universe. every piece of matter will be bound gravitationally to every other piece of matter, and escape will be impossible. the universe will fairly quickly collapse into giant black holes - all of which are inescapably bound to each other. these black holes will keep spiraling towards each other, colliding and merging. The longer the universe is around, the bigger and fewer these black holes will be.  3 spacial dimensions is pretty important for a universe to be able to spawn life."

To make a computer capable of emotions, the format, design, and technology would have to be so drastically different that it wouldn't be a ""computer"" any more. It's not that we couldn't do it, it's just that it isn't possible with the simple electromechanical methods by which computers work.

As advanced as computers are nowadays, they still rely on programming of various sorts to make any decisions they have to make on their own, be it through probability, situational analysis, etc. They simply don't have to structure to conjure up original thoughts or emotions because they are basically still reactionary systems with a purpose. Now, for technology to be able to have genuine emotion and though it would need to be based on a system much like the brain: flexible, ever-changing, having the ability to learn and adapt. I think we're still pretty far away from developing something like this but I also don't think it's impossible. In fact, I think it's pretty likely that we'll develop new forms of technology that more closely resemble our thought process and brain structure as we try to understand more about how the brain works and how technology can replicate, or even improve upon, its functions."

I know this probably isn't relevant to life on Mars, but this post reminded me of how people assume life relies on the same things we rely on, while it may not."

So what I would do is pick some random ""test"" charge, and put it in the middle between the two charges given.  Then find the net force from both charges at that point.  Then to find the strength of the field, take the net force and divide it by the charge that you used.    Note that using a test charge of 1 C makes some math a lot easier..."

Fnet/ your new charge (2) is the strength of the field  multipy this by 10-6 to get it from uC to C"

Instead of thinking solely about which college I'd fit into best and which would offer me the ideal environment, I'm thinking about how much debt I really want to have in the future and if it's worth it...definitely not what I wanted to be going through.

MIT for instance, has put virtually all of its course ware online for free, and many other colleges do the same. From talking with admissions people there, as well as some people in their physics department, I know that they will let students who can show sufficient aptitude skip courses. If you can get a ""college education"" on your own with MIT course ware on the internet than they want you to go for it, even though they could make more money by forcing you to take it there. They don't care where you're from, what your demographic is, or how much money you can make them; they care about how hard you have worked and how hard you're going to work, and that's what this ""college game"" is really about."

I think that there should be free tuition in general (we all do) but I don't think it's going to be a reality any time soon. However, in Germany, all universities let all their students go for free.

PhascinatingPhysics,32aayd,KJH_WHSphysics,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:02:20 2015 UTC,This video talks about what happens when you burn your tongue. If a first degree burn which can be incurred by eating hot or spicy food; you have burned off the top layer of your taste receptors (AKA Taste buds). The bumps on your tongue are not taste bubs but are actually lingual papillae. If you burn your tongue you damage the fungi-form papillae (named for their similar look to fungi). Each of these contains six taste buds. Every 10 days your taste buds regenerate (replaced by cells below). Unfortunately there is nothing you can do but wait until the burn heals if you get one. Fun Fact: The Mozzarella Cheese of pizza was tested to see why you almost always get burned from pizza. The physical molecules of the cheese can hold 2.7 kilojoules per kilogram of heat. This is more than rubber but slightly less than balsa wood.
PhascinatingPhysics,32aayd,KMA_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:42:05 2015 UTC,I wonder what other types of food like mozzarella cheese can hold that much heat. My tongue always gets burned when I drink hot chocolate. Maybe the chocolate in it holds a lot of heat.

It loses traction and slides, the all of a sudden ""friction!"" And your car grips the road and oversteers."

PhascinatingPhysics,32acd2,KRT_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun Apr 12 00:54:39 2015 UTC,"This video talks about how learning can be hard for people. Cognitive control from the frontal cortex(region that controls problem solving, planning, and execution) can have a depressing effect on our ability to learn new tasks. Children learn faster because they cannot over-think due to the lack of development in this brain area. When you attempt a new task nearly your entire brain is active and trying to make sense and associations from the new input. As you get better this activity is cut down to only what we need specifically for task performance. A test was conducted by researchers at several universities by having people try to memorize a simple musical computer game. The subject data was organized into two groups; slow learners and fast learners. Fast learners had a rapid drop off of global brain activation. Slow learners maintained more global brain activity over the six week trail, they also showed prolonged involvement of associative regions of the cortex. Researchers came to conclude that ""over thinking""- by maintaining vigilance, monitoring errors, and frequently making associative judgements- makes it more difficult for individuals to ""transform a task from slow and challenging to fast and automatic"". Analyzing your thinking about thinking about what you are trying to learn actually makes it harder to learn and be successful."

Not to mention that some exponential functions gain values when the power of it is greater than 1. The fact that integration doesn't do anything either is incredibly annoying and makes test into a stalemate pf exponentials against exponentials. While you can deal with sine and cosine using pi, there's almost nothing in the meta that can bring it down to something simple.

These include souvenirs, trinkets, or utensils. However, I believe that, if they are efficient enough, 3D printers will be able to make large objects such as chairs, tables, guitars, and other things quickly and effectively. One could also debate the idea that things such as skis could be made quickly by 3D printers. But, these things usually include designs and other distinct attributes to them, and 3D printers most likely won't be able to include those in the future. Otherwise, all in all, I believe that small, simple objects, as well as large, simple objects, could be made more efficiently with 3D printers than the method with which they are currently being produced.  This would be advantageous because it is more efficient. Therefore, companies could produce many more products with 3D printers than with manual labor or other machines; if a company had a hundred 3D printers, they could be making thousands of products a day (using a small object as an example in this case). Also, 3D printers would be able to make things that are more complex than conventional products, as DeSimone said. In essence, the devices can make better quality products than are currently being made. For example, legos could be made a lot better or more complex with 3D printers."

If a problem arose on the ISS, then the radically fast printer could print out a part or a tool to fix the problem. Our current 3D printers would never be fast enough to help.

The skull has fully modern features while the jaw is a mix of modern and archaic traits.

Scientists predict that these glaciers will melt by the year 2100, and as global warming persists to pose a huge global problem, this seems like an accurate prediction.

So I set up a timer and I'll do like physics homework for 40 minutes, then when that rings I give myself a break that is half the amount of time that I was doing homework (in this case 20 minutes).

I remember the words of a famous ancient poet who lived in my land. He spoke something on the lines of ""Seeing the reality of the world, I have realized that I am smaller than an atom in the grand scheme of things, and now I feel more expansive than the sky (because of the freedom which came with the realization)."" It's worth thinking about....all our emotions, pains, pleasures, greeds, perversions, life and death, is literally nothing in the larger picture. It kind of helps me shake of these momentary twitches in emotions and enjoy the larger picture while life is with me. The 'larger picture' has often helped me in my times of depression, to help me realize that I am not the center of the world, that there is no center to the world."

PhascinatingPhysics,31xysj,ATP_APPhysics,2,Thu Apr 9 00:57:20 2015 UTC,"This article looks at the amazing benefits of a coffee nap (I first heard about these from a buzzfeed video!). Basically a coffee nap is where you drink a cup of coffee and then immeadiately nap for 20 minutes. The way it works is that as you sleep, your body naturally gets rid of adenosine (which makes you tired, sleep is the only natural way to get rid of it). As a result, when you wake up the coffee is competing with less adenosine and makes you feel more energized. The article even sites various experiments where people that took coffee naps performed better on memory, cognition, and driving tests than those who didn't."
PhascinatingPhysics,31xysj,CMN_APPhysics,2,Thu Apr 9 00:59:02 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm gonna try this right now to see if it's able to get me through the rest of the day. I have to go to work in about 45 min so I should have enough time. Let's hope it works!"
PhascinatingPhysics,31xysj,LRG_APPhysics,2,Thu Apr 9 20:07:40 2015 UTC,"This is actually really cool! People always think of coffee and naps as two opposite solutions to being tired, but in this explanation, I definitely see how both can be helpful. Since the coffee takes a little while to have an effect, the person can rest and because they are at rest, their body can better deal with the adenosine and absorb the coffee! My only issue with this is that I feel like some people just have the belief that coffee makes them hyper/ energized right away and because of this predisposition they might not be able to nap thinking that they are energized when they really have not been affected by the caffeine yet. Also, I don't know if it's just me but it takes me probably longer than 20 minutes to even fall asleep so I feel like this wouldn't work for me."

These intelligent ""gadgets"" are very helpful and have so many advantages to them such as allowing us to look things up, check the time, text, call, play games, and so much more. However, are these things bad? Many people claim that teens are becoming too attached to their phones. Teens use cell-phones in many unfavorable ways, mostly regarding school, such as texting in school or playing games during class; therefore, should there be stricter restrictions on cell phone use in school?"

As they mentioned, parents do this so their kids will be safer.  But it's not the parents using the kid's phone, it's the kid.  The child may use their phone once in a while to talk to their parents, but whenever I go out, I see young kids with smartphones and all they are doing are playing games on them.  In my opinion, you should get a phone at age 15+ because getting one before age 15 is basically pointless (your parents are just paying a lot of money for the child to play Angry Birds)."

By turning the statistics into images, people can look at it and ""feel"" the numbers. The image that impress me the most is the statistic about how many plastic cups we use everyday is viewed as the millions of cups that stack up. And then Jordan puts the Statue of Liberty in there to show the enormity of the statistics. The image makes the statistic more powerful than just the numbers themselves. The art of conveying statistics into images of Chris Jordan is creative and successful. Through those images, I can see that the reason people are so unconcerned with the numbers of statistic because the numbers are too big that the brain cannot handle. The images really help me to realize the issues that we are facing which with the numbers only no way I can imagine. I'm pretty sure many people will see the problems different in this way than with the numbers only. Good way to present an idea!"

I'd like to know why, considering it isn't very hard to toss a few recycling bins for waste to be emptied into, especially since the clean up is coordinated by the flight attendants, whose jobs are partially just this. Would it be that hard to separate a few items? Cost can't really be a factor because hiring a couple recycling trucks isn't an outrageous budget increase in a billion dollar industry."

PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,EMF_WHSPhysics,2,Wed Apr 8 23:38:27 2015 UTC,"I actually really disagree with all this stigma surrounding plastic surgery, particularly elective plastic surgery. There is a SIGNIFICANT DEAL WRONG with the plastic surgery industry, but it is with the INDUSTRY and the MEDIA themselves, not with the people who get the plastic surgery, that the problem lies. See, people get plastic surgery because they are told day in and day out that they are not good enough. From the media, from their loved ones, from their parents, from their peers; there is always some way in which somebody is being told that they are not good enough. So society's bank on that with plastic surgery. I think people should be attacking the corporations that thrive and make BILLIONS of dollars off of the corruption of women's self esteem, rather than attacking the people who have elected to undergo plastic surgery regardless of what their motives are for doing so."
PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,16JAS_WHSPhysics,3,Thu Apr 9 01:08:05 2015 UTC,"18 year old girls (the demographic the artist was referring to in the video) who are just graduating high school are not paying for their own plastic surgery. That stuff is expensive. Their parents are paying for it. Regardless of what society makes the girls feel, it should be up to the parents to not allow their daughter to get breast implants at such a young age. Parents should teach their daughters that they do not need augmented breasts. Period. Women are not sex objects, so they should not give the image that they are sex objects by literally putting objects in their bodies to enhance their sexual areas. The artist is saying that it is up to the parents to stop this from happening.  Also, I think the problem you describe is with society as a whole, which can cause a lowering of self-esteem (for both men and women). The issue is not with the plastic surgeons, who are simply doing their job. I have never seen an advertisement paid for by plastic surgeons which encourages people to get plastic surgery. Therefore, it is not their fault, even though they are the ones providing the service. The fault is that of the society that causes the lowering of self-esteem and the parents who cave and let their daughters get breast augmentation at too young of an age.  I think breast augmentation is a decision that women can make once they at least have the money to pay for it themselves. I think girls in high school, who are spending their parent's money, are not old enough or mature enough to decide if that is something they want to do to their bodies."

If I was a parent, I would never want my children changing who they are so they could ""fit in"" better. In the end, all it serves to do is just demoralize the girl even more.

PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,RFD_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Apr 9 13:24:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah that was ridiculous.  I had no clue that most of the breast augmentation surgeries in the US were performed on newly adult women.  It's rather discerning to think that our society has become so shallow that women think they must change their bodies, to ""meet the needs of men"", just before they are about to embark into the real world (college and the world of employment).  I think this illustrates perfectly how he said that our cultural goals and ideals have changed.  Just look at the women's rights movements of the early 1900s.  To think that as a society, women have gone (in majority) from seeking to gain rights, to changing their bodies to impress men is frightful.  If such a trend continues, who knows what America will look like in twenty years even.

Yes, the Barbie doll is an iconic figure that is usually condemned for evoking a negative body image and a deprecation of self, but on the other hand I don't think it's a universal sign of evil. As a kid, I played with Barbie dolls immensely but I think I understood to a point that it was just plastic (Jordan built up nice connotations there with plastic surgery and good imagery that parallels a broader subject) and I noticed that the people I saw didn't actually look like that. It's difficult, and kind of painful to imagine people criticizing themselves to such an extent because of media propagated body image."

DISCUSSION STARTER:   Chris Jordan says that his motivating force is the fear that we are losing our outrage, anger, and grief about the atrocities in the world.  That our sense of national joy is being lost, and that as we move through the world, we build out perception of the world using statistics and numbers and information and data.  But these numbers are so fantastically huge that our brains simply cannot process them.  Jordan then attempts to convert these statistics and numbers into a visual language that is understandable.  A language that makes us think about ourselves and reflect on the information we are seeing in a few real way.  So here's the food for thought:    Did the way Jordan presented this information have a more profound impact than if the same numbers were simply written out, or shown with a bar chart or line graph? Which image gave you the biggest ""Whoa."" moment?  (See website below for more!) Does his art succeed?  Does it have a strong enough impact to drive you to think about the world we live in and to instigate change?  Why or why not?   Also, check out his website, where there are more ultra-large, zoomable images: CLICK HERE  **Chris Jordan WikiPedia Page: CLICK HERE88  And who knows, just in case, I will tag him from his AMA about his film ""Midway"" /u/ChrisandSabine"
PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,AKL_WHSPhysics,3,Wed Apr 8 18:09:10 2015 UTC,"The way Chris Jordan presents his information is way more effective than a chart or it simply being written out. The art he makes really puts it in perspective for it is the item at hand in the image itself. The image that had the biggest ""whoa"" factor I would have to say was the one representing breast augumentation surgery. I think his use of the barbie dolls was almost a key factor in the image for girls try to live up to the unrealistic expectations of a barbie doll. It was surprising to me that so many girls get that surgery after graduating high school, I would have never thought the number was that high. The art of Chris Jordan definitely succeeds and has a strong impact on the viewers. The strong impact comes from the new way of seeing the statistics, not just as numbers and charts, but as objects put together to highlight the enormous amount of it."
PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,JF_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Apr 9 03:05:10 2015 UTC,"Jordan's tactics are marginally more effective than if he were to simply throw out statistics that typical just pass people by without the reaction. With people, seeing is believing, and his powerful images truly to convey the loss of human life or the waste we produce as living quantities, not as a mathematical statistic. The image that had the most profound effect on me was the one were the cigarette brands represented the amount of kids under 18 that start smoking each year. We often equate smoking to a generational problem that is being phased out but the reality is that new smokers continue to join the cigarette regime and the problem is only getting worse. His art does succeed because it makes people think, which I think is ultimately the goal. People find it easier to ignore and let things be the way they are if they don't haver to think about them. However, when forced to think, people form more educated opinions on topics and tend to be more proactive."

I do not understand why some people are inclined to smoke cigarettes when we have so many educational programs in place which illustrate the dangers of smoking. I also don't see any upsides to it. I will share that 1,100 deaths per day due to cigarette smoking with smokers I know to help get them to quit.   Also, as the cousin of several heroin/prescription pill abusers, I was glad to see him point out the dangers of prescription pill abuse. I feel like since they are legal drugs (when you have a prescription for them), they do not have as much of a negative stigma as class A illegal drugs such as heroin or cocaine.   His comment about how Americans need to find their outrage about these subjects was a good one. Although some might take it as offensive to be critiqued in this way, I think his intentions were in the right place. We need the American people to feel angry enough about these topics to want to try and change them, because they are truly a problem."

Information about the damages they cause has grown over the years and there are really no upsides to it. Also, I agree with the prescription drugs piece as well.

Almost no drugs are good for you even if prescription pills.

The mere scale is what gets me. The more he zooms out, the more my jaw drops at just how immense these numbers are. The one that had me in the most awe was the paper cups that were larger than the Empire State Building, wider, and larger, that could possibly blanket a large portion of New York City. That's terrifying. We don't see that, and maybe we need to see it as more than just a number in order to understand it. That definitely hit it out of the park for me. His presentation was solid, and I definitely think that this has made me reconsider the way we so carelessly handle ourselves and our world. While the cartons of cigarettes that formed an actual painting was really impressive, the paper cups example was the one that had me the most infuriated at our behavior as human beings."

Teenagers are naturally rebellious, so when we have to make decisions, we want to make them ourselves. Getting any input in from a third party that we have no connection to just annoys us. So we try to avoid the choice they want to make for us. Of course, as seen with the effects of teenage smoking and drinking, that mentality can back fire. Hard. I partially blame those campaigns as the cause of smoking because of this.

The way he uses art/models to represent the magnitude of a certain problem is similar to the post showing the Earth and our Sun in comparison to other stars. If someone told you a star was a bajillion times bigger, your reaction would most likely be a small surprise and then forget about this random fact pretty quickly. But when we visually saw how massive some stars were in comparison to our Sun, which itself is bigger then we may be able to comprehend, its suddenly a detail that doesn't fade away so quickly.The paper and plastic cups were probably the most striking representations of how much we consume. Normally,such a minor detail as disposal cups would not come to mind when we think about our enormous waste that we produce. The problem here is though, it just isn't directly relevant enough to each one of our lives in the immediate present. So no one is really driven to do much about it to fix this problem.

The image that had the largest impact on me personally was without a doubt the paper cups picture.  If someone were to tell me that the US uses as many paper cups as is does, a day, I would know that it is a lot but would not truly be able to process just how many.  By stacking them up next to two people and the Statue of Liberty, I was fully able to understand the magnitude of such a statistic in a new way.  That being said, I totally think that his art succeeds in achieving its purpose (well with me it did at least).  After visually seeing the quantities of waste that Americans are producing with paper cups alone, I began to wonder: Where does one put all that?  Like seriously.  Where do enough cups to cover up the Statue of Liberty go?  And that's just in one day.  Imagine a week.  A Year.  Crazy.  It made me actually want to stop using paper and plastic cups, something that the statistic alone would probably never be able to achieve.

Having that clarification in such a fantastically articulated fashion was incredible. Part of the reason that these statistics boggle our minds is the sheer size: which Jordan uses in his more universal visual landscape. His creations are far more impressive than the numbers. Overall, I think the breast augmentation surgery stat got me the most. I was baffled as to how many women are getting it and the fact that they're given as grad gifts. This certainly is a new generation of parents. Some of his pieces moved me more than others-skull with cigarette being the most. All of his pieces definitely achieved his purpose, but the ones which filled out to be more, to be more symbolic, to create something moved me far more than 5 sheets of 10*25 Orange paper."
PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,GBM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Apr 9 01:21:40 2015 UTC,"Discussion starter: Jordan's information has a more significant impact than the average stat sheet because it's different. It is presented in an unorthodox way, and that attracts the eye. And because of that artistic presentation, Jordan ensures that the average viewer will be stopped for a moment to take in what's being depicted. For me the biggest 'wow' piece was the first one with the plastic cups. It caught my attention because I didn't know what it was at first; I could see the picture changing as he described and zoomed in closer and closer. Realizing what the picture was made up of after seeing the bigger image actually had a bigger impact on me than the way Jordan showed his other pieces, when he started with the small pieces and zoomed out.  Jordan's art is successful, it does send the message it was meant to, because it's different enough that it will be remembered by the people who see it - and that's the whole point, to get the issues to the public's attention."
PhascinatingPhysics,31wcy2,jmm_apphysics1,1 point,Thu Apr 9 02:05:02 2015 UTC,"I always like to see art in some form being used for something other than just display. I think it's really cool that Jordan was able to use his art and apply it to issues that matter to him, and present it in a way that grabs people's attention. For me one of the most important parts of the speech was when he mentioned that the issues he talked about weren't what he believed to be the most pressing in America, and there were other topics that he hadn't covered. Not only does that leave room to expand upon his project, it was decent of him to acknowledge that there are other problems out there, and that the ones he discussed weren't the only ones that are important."

PhascinatingPhysics,31r6l3,PhascinatingPhysics,7,Tue Apr 7 15:05:33 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: I agree with John Bohannan's assertion about PowerPoint and communication. Many people often do misuse PowerPoint and may not realize that it actually hurts their presentation instead of improving it. PowerPoint can be overwhelming if not used correctly and that's where presenters can go wrong. I also agree with him when he said people better understand explanations with simple/basic words or demonstrations. Dancing to communicate allows the audience to understand the specific and important details of an explanation. Bohannan's use of the dancers to explain the cooling of atoms was helpful. At first I was confused but then the dancing helped me understand the explanation on a basic level. A PowerPoint wouldn't be as effective because it is not as interactive as a dance. The dance correlated with his simple words. When he used the word ""scattered"" or ""moving fast"" the dancers would run around fast and act as moving atoms. Using dancers to perform a presentation/explanation is clever and innovative. Dancers are versatile and its fascinating how the dancer use their body to create the helpful images.  I also watched the Dance Your Ph.D, it was cool! I understood it which was awesome!"

It makes it much easier for someone without a Ph.D in the topic to understand, which I believe is the point of a contest like this!"
PhascinatingPhysics,31r6l3,EEF_WHSPhysics,2,Tue Apr 7 21:12:11 2015 UTC,I agree.

I watched many of the ""Dance Your Ph.D"" videos and really understood them! My favorite was https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqvqdSDY-iY These videos make it really easy to understand difficult and complicated topics, for example cancer as shown in the link.  In Bohannon's video I thought the dances helped, but I think he should have given more of a description about what was going on! In the other videos the lyrics talk about what is going on or there is a script at the bottom.

I agree with John Bohannon's assertion that powerpoint is sometimes misused and that there are better ways that could get across the ideas in a more effective way. I think while power points often hold a great deal of information, there is something memorable about visuals. This is why for me i thought this way of dancing out the concepts was extremely affective. The dancers in this video portrayed the way cells move in a unique and understandable way and these types of visuals help me. I think in some cases, power points would be better fit.

PhascinatingPhysics,31r6l3,DES_WHSPhysics,2,Wed Apr 8 01:00:38 2015 UTC,i completely agree with you. power point are needed for small groups but for large group dancers will be better. for small groups instead of having dancers you can put a video of cells moving around in your power point.

I feel that his assertion regarding misuse of powerpoints is accurate. I often find myself sitting in classrooms scribbling down the notes quickly to keep up, not maintaining the information as much as I should. I feel that communication is often confused and wordy, especially in classrooms. Appealing to the student's, it is essential to remain simple and straight to the point.

PhascinatingPhysics,31r6l3,ker_whsphysics,2,Tue Apr 7 23:27:51 2015 UTC,I felt the same way. Sometimes when the John Bohannon was talking I got distracted by the four people who kept moving with him. I started to focus too much on what they were doing then what the John Bohannon was actually saying. This could be a problem when trying to learn a new concept in class because the student may miss some of the information.
PhascinatingPhysics,31r6l3,KGH_WHSPhysics,0,Wed Apr 8 00:20:16 2015 UTC,I also found I was too busy watching the dancers than to listen to what Bohannon had to say.

A lot of my teachers use Powerpoint and I find it easy to learn that way. Sometimes it can be misused but for the most part I find it helpful. Powerpoint allows for quick notes and pictures. I think the same goes for dancing. Dancing allows for a visual and this will help to learn something easily. However, if there are too many dancers doing crazy things it could get a little confusing and hard to follow just like a Powerpoint with too much information. I did find the dancer's actions during Bohannon's explanation of how laser cool atoms helpful.  Once I was shown how it happened, I better understood it. I do not think a Powerpoint would have been as effective unless it contained a video explaining the concept."
PhascinatingPhysics,31r6l3,KGH_WHSPhysics,2,Wed Apr 8 00:09:08 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: I somewhat agree with John Bohannon's assertions about PowerPoint and communication. PowerPoint can be misused, but for the most part I like PowerPoints and believe they enhance learning. PowerPoints are most effective when there are few words on each slide, rather than the whole side filled with a long paragraph. PowerPoints make it easy to take notes and if there are pictures it makes it easier to understand the topic. Dancing to teach a concept can be helpful too because it shows what is being taught in a less complicated manner. Dancing to teach is good for visual learners. PowerPoints and dancing are both helpful in learning in their own ways. I did find that the dancers' actions during Bohannon's explanation of how lasers can cool atoms, and the resulting behavior of the super-cooled fluid helped my understanding of the concepts he was explaining because the dancers made it easy to follow what was happening."

You don't need dancers to be moving like a cell when you can put a video of cell moving. it will be easier to show this. especially when you are presenting to a small group. when you are presenting to a much larger group dancers will keep the people interested. i found that the dancers' actions during Bohannon's explanation of how lasers can cool atoms, and the resulting behavior of the super-cooled fluid helped my understanding of the concepts he was explaining. the dancers made it easy to follow what he was saying"

Many teachers do just put up PowerPoints and have kids copy notes which is not very effective for the student and is also tedious. But if a teacher is engaged in the material and isn't just making a student copy down notes but also adding their own insight in an engaging discussion than PowerPoints can be helpful.

The audience is not involved in any way.  I felt that the dancers were not the best idea for communicating difficult subjects.

A PowerPoint wouldn't allow for you to visually see how this process happened and the dance allowed for a basic understanding of the concept. It's amazing how dancers can use their body to allow the audience to understand a concept many try to convey through power points or other demonstrations that wouldn't work as well.

PowerPoint has just become a way of presenting notes instead of really explaining in depth what those notes mean. Yes, teachers discuss the notes as they are being taken down, however, students definitely learn better when they are more involved with the learning. Sitting down for a long period of time watching someone click from slide to slide can get boring and cause a lack of interest.

But, when presenting complex topics, it is not always easy to streamline these things so the Powerpoints get dragged out over a billion slides and eventually you get put to sleep by them. Since the human attention span is roughly 8 seconds, so if you do not catch their attention in those first 8 seconds, your audience is lost for good. With unconventional approaches like dance, you surprise your audience and give them something new to focus on. With that said, it gets to a point where dancers could be too distracting, causing the audience to tune out the boring narration and focus in on what the dancers will do next. Overall there needs to be a balance between streamlined information and eye catching methods, and Power points usually will not provide that on their own. If multiple techniques are blended, then you can give the information clearly while still making the information entertaining enough to hold the short human attention span."

DISCUSSION STARTER: I think that the history of the ""Left vs. Right Brain Debate"" is a really good example how how a well-done scientific study can be published, written, and reviewed, and then incorrectly summarized, distorted, or interpreted.  Then this misinformation becomes more popular and accepted than the results of the actual original study.    This is especially frustrating as no one ever bothers to check, or even to think to check the original research.  This is also the case when people take one study and take the results of that one study to be the new ""truth,"" even though that ""one"" study contradicts 10,000 other studies.  (The anti-vaccination movement is another really good example of how a single study -later shown to be fabricated by a now-discredited doctor on massive scales- can completely change our perception of scientific progress.  The gluten-free movement is another example of this effect: The researchers who published the original study showing gluten can cause gastronomical distress actually published a second study disproving their own original study!!!)  What do you think about how these examples help or hurt scientific progress?  Why?  What would you propose to combat the spread of misinformation?  Or can we?  Or is the back-and-forth good vs. bad, right vs. wrong process an inherent part of forward progress?

PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,BRW_APPhysics,2,Mon Apr 6 13:14:46 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter:  This is actually an idea I have been mulling around over for my capstone: ""Misinformation through Simplification."" Simplifications are powerful tools. They help to disseminate complicated information quickly to massive amounts of people. They can also be used as a stepping stone into more complicated analyses: like an analogy at the beginning of a lecture. Just think how hard learning about anything would be without simplifications. BUT: These wonderful tools have a terrible down side. In every single case, a simplification will neglect full comprehension of what it simplifies. Yes, the force of gravity is ""like a pull"", but it isn't a 'pull', it's a warping of spacetime. Now spacetime warping is a lot more complicated than just saying ""pull"", and we aren't going to teach high schoolers general relativity, but the meaning is lost there. It is in these hiatuses of specificity that misinformation and misconception grow. In order to avoid the fervent and damaging perpetuation of misinformation, the complexity - and importance thereof - of information must be embraced fully. People must learn simplifications while remaining entirely cognizant of how things are being simplified, and what meanings are lost therein. Only then, with a rigorous awareness of our own ignorance on a subject, can we avoid perpetuating misinformation."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,CPF_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:46:05 2015 UTC,"What you mentioned about the simplification of topics in school is extremely accurate.  Classes articulate certain topics in a way that can be easily understood by its audience, like in elementary school when we learn that you can't subtract 5 from 3.  This allowed teachers to gradually pull back the curtain over time as we realize that what we knew before wasn't the whole story.  This is similar to the gravity thing...teachers tell us that gravity is a ""pulling"" force so we can initially conceptualize it and once we understand this they pull back another layer and explain how it is actually a warping of spacetime."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,BRW_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 01:56:43 2015 UTC,"But this process only works if it is maintained over that long period of time: that gradual 'drawing back of the covers.' It is rendered defunct in the realm of mass information, where sound bytes and video clips are all people (justifiably) have time for. In these cases, a different method of communicating complexity demands to be employed."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,CJF_APCPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:14:34 2015 UTC,I have personally always thought of this as one of the worst things about our education system and the media is that they don't necessarily mention the fact that it is a simplification and simplify things in an incorrect manner.
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,CMN_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:02:59 2015 UTC,"Not only a different method, but a whole different cultural approach to how we treat information is needed.

I think it'd be an interesting experiment to actually go around and label all of the ""facts"" given to us so we can see which ones are actually true and  which ones are not."

""You can't subtract 5 from 3"", then ""you can't have negative numbers"", etc. etc. In a way, it's good practice for the teachers to say that, as kids will not go about asking university-level questions in a 3rd grade classroom, where the math teacher would not be capable of answering them. But I also feel like it's ethically not right, as they just cover information that we'll be exposed to later on anyways. Weird how the school system works."

Obviously the information gained from a scientific study is much more important and ore eland, but people do not always see it that way, so people like reporters look for a quick and simple way to spread the word that will interest people. This is usually not the best way to present information because it turns out to be incorrect, and people usually don't look up more information on it. This is harmful all the way down to what we learning school. In Ap Psych we learn about the different brain hemispheres and spilt brain patients, but it was never said that people are not dominant on either side, so I think if we are not told otherwise, many assume it is. Also, it can be harmful to people's health. If someone is afraid and does not get a vaccine because they think it will cause autism, they could end up becoming sick because they did not get it. This misinformation is harmful everywhere in our society"
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,BJC_CPPhysics_6,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:22:13 2015 UTC,"Well the only reason why we have so much misinformation is for attention. Sites everywhere will prop op any studies, leaks, or gossip that they found lying outside on the curb and spread it around like frosting on a cake. More views means more shares which means more views leading to more advertisements leading to, uh, cash. I feel like it also comes down to a degree where everyone wants to seem like they know what they're talking about, so they'll take this info and use it in an argument with their friends to make them sound smart. Remeber Ebola? Remember how many people it killed and yet America treated it like the next big disease? It's like we want to be afraid because we want to tell people about it."

It reminds me of all of the racial stereotypes in the past that now seem to be ridiculous.

PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,BJC_CPPhysics_6,0,Tue Apr 7 10:49:42 2015 UTC,"Your comment about Psych class brings up an interesting insight: we often take for granted that what we are learning in school is correct. Yet not all subjects have the easily verifiable nature of Physics or the impenetrable logical foundation of mathematics with which to instantaneously confirm the validity of the information presented. What if the things your Psych teacher tells you turn out to be wrong? What if your History teacher perpetuates a misconception to you? It falls upon each individual to reject the ""easy way"" of passively receiving information and instead to remain vigilant and tirelessly confirm or refute information presented to them regardless of its source."

Whether it be about a scientific study or a piece of hot gossip information is bound to be construed in some form while it is passed along. This sort of reminds me of a game I used to play as a child called telephone; except on a much larger scale. The results of an experiment are passed on, and on, and on, and on, and on, until somewhere along the line they has been altered to be completely different and even in some cases contradictory to what the original information had proposed. I think the only way to combat this is to be sure the information you share is from a reliable source, and you share it accurately."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,CMN_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 03:39:54 2015 UTC,lol I find this funny because it uses something that is so familiar & relatable to all such as a childhood game to relate to an abstract concept presented in the video such as the spread of information.

PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,DJC_HPhysics_2,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:12:26 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: I've always been intrigued by the fact that most people will just believe whatever they see and take it as being fact. I feel like this has much to do with the age we're living in now. We strive for immediacy, and in our pursuit for it we end up leaving behind many things. If we want an answer, we'll google and find it and just assume that because google took us to it, it's right. The risk of misinformation is even higher now due to the fact that anybody can post something they think is true and say it is so. Then other people will see this ""version"" of the truth and decide that, because it fits them best, that's the one they're going to follow. We've come to the point where we can chose which ""truths"" we want to believe because as long as there is support for an answer, it must be true. But this is all done so blindly that in the end of the day, things that are based in truth become so distorted that the truth is no longer there. I think that, due to how far this has gone, there's no practical way of fixing this issue. The only possible way would be to somehow revert our desire to find the quickest, most satisfying answer but that would involve changing our very humanity. The reason we choose to believe in one ""truth"" over the other is because the truth we believe in just happens to be more convenient to our particular situation. For example, if someone is not a good painter, they don't want the fault to be theirs, so what they may say is that they're left brained as an excuse for the inabilities and as a way to divert the blame from themselves. That's just how humans are, and I don't think there's much we can do to change it. (Kinda pessimistic, I know.)"

Saying things like ""that's just the way it is"" and ""it's always been that way"" is a horrible way for people to think about science.  That would be like me only using my lab data to make formulas for physics.  Most of the time, it's completely different than everyone elses, but I would be really persistent about its 'truth'.

While we usually focus on just science, I find this metascience to be wicked cool. I believe that these flaws in scientific accountability stem from modern 24 hour news. With the commercialization of the news (the transition from public broadcasting to the current corporations who control the news), I think that consumers of the news have grown to accept if not faulty, at least unreliable information. I believe that the news has made us susceptible so accepting fact without proper citation by giving everyone access to information that would have only been shared with academics in the past. From my experience researching, academic work is usually peer-reviewed and much less sensationalistic than the current media.  By no measure do I intend to imply that people should not have access to academic information (through my criticism of the media for ""dumbing down"" complex issues to allow the Everyman/Everywoman to digest them). I think that people should not be so willing to accept information from the news without proper citation. Modern-day news would lose viewership if charismatic and the occasionally condescending anchors were forced to present their material in MLA format (imagine Keith Olberman, Nancy Grace, or even Papa Bear himself Bill O'Reilly losing the sass and just presenting facts).  I know this response does not address the misconception of Sperry's findings in the scientific community, but it certainly does speak to what Hank said about the articles featured in Time Magazine and The New York Times.

It's kind of crazy how they choose who to watch based on personality rather than the content they're providing. And not once have they ever watched a News report and said, ""Hmm...I'm a bit skeptical about this. I'm gonna do some further research on the topic"". I'm sure other people here can relate."

I also agree with your point about how we care too much about the anchors. I think the issue is that it's supply and demand. Like it or not, the anchors are making money and so as a result a lot of them are willing to humor our need for a young anchorwoman or a clever anchorman. Consequently, this competition led the integrity of the business to be lost somewhere along the way."

Say if someone was bad at math, they could claim to be right brained and more creative than others, therefore  shifting the blame away from them. Many people also don't care for the validity of facts, but more for the appeal the fact has towards them. People are just weird. Hahaha!"

FORGET it if there's some statistics in a fact or something. People go nuts believing what they read.

I know that the news is really simplistic often and doesn't often depict all of what is going on but it can allow people to atleast have knowledge about what is going on without putting too much effortful processing into finding it out. Since it is easily accessible with the tv, it can be good and I agree Henry that as long as they are not so susceptible to it and don't rely too much on it being absolutely accurate, it can be  a way for people to atleast have a basis for knowing what's going on around them for if these sensationalized versions weren't available, I can't imagine everyone spending the time to find the actual sources on their own."

This simplification is necessary if the general populace (not having any academic background sufficient enough to read a scientific paper) is to understand current developments in the scientific community. This happens in literally every aspect of mass information: an entire person is simplified into a series of stories, a legislative bill - hundreds of pages long - is summarized in a paragraph, the list goes on. Should we stop simplifying information? That would surely drop attention rates as you said, and hurt the information industry. Should we save complex information for those who have the background to understand it? No, for the blunt of all information is inherently complex. By that measure, only those who have studied law and government should be able to understand a piece of legislation, and only a luminary's close friends and family should be able to understand who they are. The problems of misconception and misinformation arise not out of simplification itself, but in how information is simplified. It is the responsibility of those who simplify information to do so in such a way as to preserve as much meaning as possible."

PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,LRG_APPhysics,4,Tue Apr 7 10:54:52 2015 UTC,"This video was a good review for the AP Psych exam! In response to the issue of whether or not these scientific discrepancies and careless published works help or hurt scientific process, I see it as both. Obviously, it hurts scientific progress because if someone publishes something and everyone gets stuck on the oversimplified version, it will be hard to later convince them to believe the actual more complex truth because for the general population, it is easier to just believe what is easier. To prevent this I think that scientists need to be more involved in the publishing of their work. They do all of the research and hard work and then it falls into someone else's hands and it is misinterpreted and re- organized to mean something totally different. If the scientist's themselves are more private and keep their research to themselves until they can publish it rather than telling people part of the story, it will be better for scientific process. On the other hand, this can be okay for society because it forces the ones that actually do care and actually do recognize discrepancies to go back and re- do the research. This is great for scientific research because there can never be too much research done to prove something so if it forces someone else to repeat the same study and get results over again then it can really confirm. In the gluten free study, if there was never controversy about the discrepancies then they might have gotten away with their original claim and not have redone it to prove the opposite. Scientific progress can be stalled by people simplifying research and findings but as long as a portion of the population is still keeping an eye out for discrepancies and actively testing and retesting, it can just lead to more confirmation and definitive answers."

I feel like many people just leak details about their research or just let other people write about it, for instance, I know a long time ago some of these scientists were the guys that would not be able to publish their own works because they were shunned from society, etc. They should definitely share their research but I think that they need to be able to communicate it to others and make sure it says all they want it to say rather than letting other people take over and mess with the details."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,ATP_APPhysics,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:21:19 2015 UTC,"I agree with your point here. I think it is very important that the results of scientific studies are released to the public, otherwise we would see a dramatic drop in scientific literacy. But the way in which lab reports are published and consumed by the media should be changed. I think the issue is mainly in how a media/news site interprets and shares a study. However I am not sure if there is a way to fix this, as most media/news sites would rather have higher ratings and traffic than be 100% credible and accurate."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,MPF_HAstro,1 point,Mon Apr 6 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"You're right, now that I am thinking about it, I feel like even though it would be ideal for the scientists and researchers themselves to take care of publishing and writing their reports in a way that the general population can consume it, it isn't really that realistic. Ironically this kind of has to do with right brain vs. left brain specialties but many scientists and researchers who have specialties in the side of the brain dedicated to the maths and logical computing are unlikely to have a huge affinity for the fields of writing and language and this may be why they would rather pass on their research than write it themselves and they may not be very adept at writing the information in a reader- friendly, digestible way."

PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,jas_hastro_7,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:13:34 2015 UTC,I was reading a book a few months ago and part of it focused on how Carl Sagan tried to make science a more popular and accessible topic for the general public.  A lot of scientists were mad at him for trying to oversimplify everything and make it available to everyone.  They essentially thought that science was only for scientists and no one else.
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,ATP_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 10:17:05 2015 UTC,"True story.  But Carl Sagan was definitely one of the first and most influential [roponents of science and critical thinking.  Without him we wouldn't have Bill Nye (/u/sundialbill), Neil DeGrasse Tyson (/u/neiltyson), Richard Dawkins (/u/_RichardDawkins)...  etc.  Carl Sagan made science ""cool"" for people, and entered it into pop culture and mainstream media.  And for that, we should all be grateful, even if he did ""oversimplify"" some complex science.    I would rather have a generation of kids (and adults) be excited about science and learning and curiosity than content in their ignorance, even if that excitement is based on an oversimplification of a complex topic."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,ZDP_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Apr 7 11:56:05 2015 UTC,"You've hit the nail on the head with this reconfirmation idea (and, frankly, revealed an unexpected benefit of this misconception dilemma). Scientific empiricism demands a constant barrage of attacks on any proposition, tirelessly and implacably attempting to refute any and all claims made. It is only those claims that can perpetually withstand this barrage that become accepted as 'fact', and even these are to be immediately thrown away if they are refuted at some future date. Science is, as you point out, tentative: the discoveries and studies of the past are not inherently true, and science has never 'finished' proving something."

I always find it annoying how people talk about a subject, like brain lateralization, as if they're an expert, when they really just read an overly-simplified, watered-down version of the original report. Sort of like the game Telephone.  I find that these types of ""science made simple"" reports are a necessary part of scientific progress. The pros of these examples are that people are becoming more aware of scientific theories as they're established. The cons of this is that the information is usually generalized so much that it's wrong. In my opinion, the only real way to combat this is to just be smarter on the internet. So much information is given to us on a daily basis, it's hard to tell what's true and what is not. Contrary to popular belief, a source is not reliable just because it's on the internet. I believe that scientific progress will ensue once the world figures out how to determine the reliability of a source."

If you're appealing to the audience of the general public, then try to make it understandable at least a little. But don't sugarcoat it with details about ""what this means for the future"" or ""how its already being used in society"" because then you're making people take the possibly misinterpreted information and telling everyone they know about it.

I don't think it's either really bad or good, I think it's just kind of inevitable. Since this is a big topic in psychology, it reminded me of how Freud classified homosexuality as an illness in his research from decades ago. Yet, this has created a ripple effect and to this day there are still resources that classify homosexuality or gender role reversal as types of disorders. This is a particularly negative effect, but in Freud's time, such ideas were kind of a mystery. Therefore, I think the best way to combat this type of misconceptions of research is to always be skeptical. I think that as a society we have become a little better at doing so, but not the best at it. We need to question more and be willing to criticize people's ideas. I think this will help us not only in scientific research but also historical research and many more subjects."

It is strange how most people will just believe something they hear that sounds good without following it up with research. Personally, the first time I heard about the left/right brain split, I thought that it sounded ridiculously silly and did personal research and found that it was false. This reminds me a lot of the ""you only use 10% of your brain"" rumor. Many people have argued for this rumor to me, even after I have presented actual evidence from real scientific studies to them. About progress, I think that things like this can be good for scientific progress, as we sometimes think we can prove something scientifically but something else ends up being true. Misconceptions such as these can help people to see things in a different way, although the magnitude at which they usually occur can be very detrimental for progress."

There just doesn't seem to be a plausible explanation for it. And I agree with your stance on this being beneficial for scientific progress. The way I see it, researchers are always trying to find new, different ideas, apart from what has already been established. When masses of people believe that, say, eating gluten causes digestive problems, it gives researchers all the more incentive to prove the masses wrong."

The 2014 movie Lucy (starring Scarlett Johansson) is an example of this. In the movie, Lucy is accidentally given a rare, experimental drug that ""unlocks"" more parts of her brain to use. The underlying theory is that humans can only use 10% of their brains by default, which is obviously not true. I was kind of annoyed when I saw this movie not because this theory is false, but because I know people who watched the movie probably believed it. Just a little pet peeve of mine."

Some scifi movies are based on actual science, and probably change it a little, which is cool, but some movies like Lucy just use complete false ideas in the first place. For movies about vampires I don't think this is an issue because most people do not believe they are real anyway, but making a movie about something believable that is actually not true, can just reinforce the false information."
PhascinatingPhysics,31mdj4,kef_hasto,1 point,Tue Apr 7 00:37:55 2015 UTC,I was the complete opposite! I think that because children are told these false scientific rumors by adults that we tend to believe them. I always thought that things like left minded people/ right minded people and only using 10% of the brain were all true. It wasn't until I got older and really thought about those rumors that I became skeptical. Humans are so easily influenced by other humans that we sometimes can be told anything and we will believe it.

Also, with this particular subject, I don't think that there is any chance for real harm to be done through this misinterpretation. However, if there was issues with diagnosis of a disease or mental disorder or something then there would be issues because you could potentially administer the wrong treatment to someone because you diagnosed them incorrectly. With right/left brain though, there really is no diagnosis (unless you're like those patients where one hemisphere of the brain was causing seizures)."

This starts with the publisher of the study cautioning their results saying gluten MAY be correlated with gastrointestinal distress and naturally people run with that idea and draw a direct cause-effect relationship that gluten consumption causes gastrointestinal problems.  And soon enough this gets spread by word of mouth to the point that no one even knows who or where the actual study came from.  Especially with the rise of social media I feel like there really isn't a way to stop this way of spreading incorrect information.  There will always be people who will be quick to believe anything they hear via word of mouth and accept it as fact because it is naturally easier that way.  As sad as it may sound, the effort it would take to verify everything people hear is simply too much to validate when you can formulate an opinion based on what you were told and be done with it."

I guess in some cases, like when you have people that are anti-vaccine, the impact of scientific discoveries are discredited but technically the knowledge is still available and there is still ways for newer research to derive from it. People have the choice of whether or not they want to believe information being presented to them. The downfall is people believe concepts that lack reliable evidence and they provide no effort to try and do their own individual research of other studies to justify their beliefs, often causing some type of hysteria. I personally don't believe that there is a way to prevent research from being misconstrued because of the outside influence of media.

A few months ago I didn't know what it was and now it's my home page that I spend hours on all the time. What I like best is how Reddit seems to be ahead of the news cycle, everything I see on here, my friends see days later on other social media. The flow of ideas and the diversity it contains in topics is just plain awesome!"
PhascinatingPhysics,31kdyc,JTB_WHS,2,Tue Apr 7 00:07:45 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  I've definitely seen a change and improvement over the year.  Kids are figuring out that reddit is a big place and that it has all sorts of awesome stuff, if you just go look for it a little.  More and more of them are having fun with it, and figuring out that ""Hey, learning can be fun!"" and having an open forum to talk about stuff is good.  I am hoping that as it runs for a while longer, I will have more and more kids buy in and realize how useful and fun and entertaining it can be."

I did see in a Nova documentary a while ago that spider silk was the strongest thing on Earth (or something like that) and they tested spider silk in stopping bullets. It worked with layers of silk and other products, but not with single strands. This new body armor will be great in combat with its ability to stop bullets and other objects.

PhascinatingPhysics,31h8dm,CJF_APCPhysics,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:45:52 2015 UTC,I don't think it would help with falling because falling would be different in that you still would be stopped by hitting the ground.

Most countries that say they practice communism actually have a socialistic system. Anyways, Sweden is a democracy but could just as easily be seen as a partially socialist country... does that make it a bad place to live? No. In fact, it has a much higher standard of life than America. I understand that a lot of the socialist countries have failed over the years, but this is simply due to corruption and bad management of resources/finances/matters. I just am really bothered when the word ""socialist"" is immediately associated with ""evil"", ""failure"", or ""brainwashing""."
PhascinatingPhysics,31dp3i,CMN_APPhysics,1 point,Mon Apr 6 05:02:33 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of the anti-socialist and anti-communist drive is still the effect of Cold War propaganda that played such a big role in uniting the US and other countries. Actual communism, like you said, can never exist because it requires that humans actually work equally together (which as we've come to know in life, working together equally isn't really our thing). I think that the way people identify communism now kinda brings up a need to redefine somethings so we all know what we're talking about and pointing fingers at. In a society such as ours where people don't like being told that what they grew up knowing to be true isn't actually right, I think it'd just be better to expand or redefine some terms so we're all on some type of equal footing when it comes to discussing these things. I also think that we value ""democracy"" way too much. I remember when we studied about the uprising of the minority 49% in US History and it really led me to think about how the whole system actually works. Also, the reason I put democracy in quotations is because all we can do is trust that the government is actually showing equal representation and not falling into corruption and other similar issues. Again, being human, we know that corruption is present in every single gov't, regardless of what anyone says, so we really have to think about which of them provides an optimal system to organize and govern a country even with the occasional corruption scandal. Democracy seems to be working for now, but who knows, that might change later on down the road. I find this question of different political systems to be really interesting. After all, if working with one other person is already tough enough, finding a system to govern a country of a few hundred million properly may just be impossible (especially without the will to compromise)."
PhascinatingPhysics,31dp3i,DDI_APPhysicsC,1 point,Mon Apr 6 06:04:06 2015 UTC,"I have wondered about this same thing many times. What could be ""better"" (or rather, less flawed) than democracy at the moment? You're right, corruption is present everywhere, it's just much greater in the places that try to establish a socialist system. I feel like the American government has such strict control over the media and the population as a whole, that very little potentially harmful corruption information is exposed. We'd like to think that our government and political system are perfect, but the truth of the matter is - they're not. Money, and the potential of having it, seems to doom all political systems. I believe that the only successful socialist society was that of the Native American population prior to Columbus's arrival. Once you remove money from a community, it doesn't take long for people to fall down on the same social level."
PhascinatingPhysics,31dp3i,CMN_APPhysics,2,Tue Apr 7 04:09:44 2015 UTC,"I say a lot of it has to do with our individualist nature, which comes with being human, where we want to see ourselves succeed over others. Never had this been more true than it is right now where competition is so high people will do everything in hopes that they'll have a higher salary than the person next to them. That's why capitalism works so much better in our societies, it's cruel and competitive and at the end of the day, more human. Socialist and communist societies can only work once everyone stops looking at what can benefit them and begins to look at what can benefit the group, even if they must compromise. Given the fact that most people can't show compromise in a societal system as simple as marriage, as shown by rising divorce rates (most on account of the fact that the couple's interests didn't match...meaning they didn't want the same thing, meaning they don't know how to compromise), it's easy to,see how impossible it would be for a whole nation to give up personal interest for the benefit of the whole. Oh, humanity! Hahaha!"

You're basically saying that our human nature will not allow us to establish a successful system other than a capitalistic one. You said that capitalism works much better in our society, as it is competitive. Yes, it's like Darwin's ""survival of the fittest"" theory applied to the market - the laissez-faire approach. Government lifts its hands and decides to cease its interference in the market, encouraging massive competition. However, by no means is this system a ""more human one"". Letting the large portion of the population live as lower class citizens while funneling most of the money into the top 1% or even 0.1% is not right. So, I suppose in the grand scheme of things, capitalism is more successful, but it is not more humane."
PhascinatingPhysics,31dp3i,CMN_APPhysics,2,Mon Apr 13 01:31:17 2015 UTC,"I think the difference lies in distinguishing the difference between what is ""human"" and what is ""humane"". Being ""humane"" is defined as showing compassion or benevolence, but we know that, regardless of how we want to be, humans aren't like that. Being human consists of some compassion, but mostly cruelty and competitiveness given the fact that we naturally want to see our selves in a better position than those beside us. I guess that the point is that humans suck and we can never really get along because that's just who we are. Hahaha!"

Research from the American Psychological Association has determined that homework is in the middle. The benefits of homework are real unless over assigned. Researchers determine that anything over 70 minutes per day of homework was inefficient in improving scholastic ability (The HOW is more important than how MUCH). Homework in Elementary school does not have evidence of any benefit. Junior High and High schools saw and increased amount of gains but it was determined that autonomy was better. A 2012 study of 18,000 10-grade students found (quote) ""homework should be purposeful, and that purpose must be understood by both the teachers and the students... more is not better.

For the record, this is why I don't assign a bunch of problems for homework. Contrary to what you might think, I do purposefully pick which problems to assign and which ones I don't.   My biggest question is the 70 minutes they quote. Is that for a single class, or for a single night?  Because that's a big difference.   I would make the argument that the benefit to taking too many heavy work-load classes doesn't always outweigh the fact that you're taking lots of classes that have a high workload. Sometimes classes are hard and require a time and energy commitment. And this is often overlooked when booking schedules.   Would you try and run track and play football and work a job and be in the drama club and play in a band and take four heavy classes?  Sometimes stuff is just hard and takes time. That's just how it is. Fact of life: sometimes you can't get everything done or learn everything you need to know in the 45-minutes during class. Sometimes it takes hard work, dedication, and persistence. And that applies to academics as much as it does sports or games or juggling or card tricks or whatever else you try and do."

My earlier point is that I think many students don't leave themselves enough time to do the rest part. And for no good reason. So they get burned out and overloaded and stressed out and cranky."

But there is a point where homework becomes useless and frustrating more than helpful. When its midnight and I am still doing homework and projects that has to be too much. There needs to be a limit to how much homework students can get in each class. This could be dependent on the grade or the type of class, CP, H, AP, but there needs to be structure to the homework system. Its impossible to plan activities when you don't know if you're going to have an hour of homework all together for 4 hours."

They feel that each night we need homework.  But, let's say math as an example, when we learn a new topic, not everyone understands it enough to do any problems.  We need to do a couple examples in order to understand it better.  When we learn a new topic, we should get a day or 2 of no homework so we can use our class time to do practice problems, not go over the questions people have on the homework.  The point I'm making is that yes, some homework is beneficial, but too much or giving homework after you learned a new subject that day isn't going to help us learn."

A thousand year old Anglo-Saxon remedy to cure an eye stye (which is an annoying painful bump on your eyelid from and infected hair follicle) was recreated and tested by Scientists from the University of Nottingham. They used ingredients as close to the medhieval as possible. The researchers tested the ""potion"" on scraps of mouse skin that had been infected with a super bug version of MRSA. It worked and killed 90% of the bacteria, which is closely equivalent to the modern day antibiotics used to treat MRSA. Scientists think ancient cultures like Egyptians, Chinese, Greeks, Nubians, and many more, were purposefully making antibiotics to use in medicine thousands of years before the discovery of penicillin. Egyptians used honey to treat wounds. Honey which has high sugar concentrations draws out water from bacteria, which kills the bacteria through dehydration. Honey's acidity also hamper bacteria.

PhascinatingPhysics,315omz,ATB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, how do pendulum clock work? Well, here's the answer. Pendulum clocks (Also called grandfather clocks) work by two sets of gears: ""timekeeper gears"" and ""power gears"". Timekeeper gears automatically change the hour hand every 60 minutes, and likewise, the minute hand every 60 seconds. In order to move the second hand automatically, however, the power gears are needed to convert the motion of a falling mass into movement of the seconds hand. That falling mass is the pendulum at the bottom of the clock, which maintains a constant period of 1 second thanks to another component called an escapement. I thought this was pretty interesting, and is a really good example of how simple harmonic motion is used in real life. It also might help visualize a certain question on the online homework a little better... ;D"
PhascinatingPhysics,315omz,LRG_APPhysics,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:49:40 2015 UTC,"This is actually really cool and now that we have reviewed SHM, its cool to think that those who design grandfather clocks have to keep in mind proportions and calculate the period just like we did in our labs and in the online homework to make sure that the period is 1 second. This is why you can't just have a grandfather clock of any random height and hanging mass because they have to be the right dimensions for the specific period."

But if the equation for a period only takes into account length and gravity, doesn't the length for all clocks have to be the same? Or is there some proportion with inertia that needs to be taken into account? (SHM isn't my favorite chapter)  I honestly don't see a reason why someone would rely on these things nowadays, considering that digital clocks are so much more reliable. That may even be the reason why anyone would use it, if they don't have electricity. We have a pendulum clock just chilling in our house, but we're not using it because you have to rewind it every day. Honestly they're more of an antique at this point."

It is a substance that can stop a bleed in under ten seconds even with twice the pressure an artery has. He explains how many ways it would be helpful on the war front and in the medical field. Before, the best blood clotting substances could take 10 minutes to stop a bleed, so his new invention would be taking a big step"

From adding top hats to everyone's icon to the infamous ""mishapocalypse"", everyone gets in on it. This year's prank was the most cringe-worthy 90's add on that I have ever seen. Included in this is Coppy the copier, who is this little pop up animated copy machine that appears on the window and generally acts annoying. I have to say, that it's fun when everyone gets into the april fools fun, even big companies like Google and Tumblr"

PhascinatingPhysics,3141jk,KEW_APPhysicsC,1 point,Fri Apr 3 01:52:36 2015 UTC,"This one stumped me for a while but it became clearer when I realized that the degree measure they give you is actually the amplitude of the pendulum.  And I also realized that the angular velocity, w, is equal to the distance (2pi) over the time it takes to make one oscillation (T).   And T, the period, is equal to 2pi(sqrt(L/g)).   Thus w = 2pi/2pi(sqrt(L/g)).  So with this knowledge you can use x(t) = Acos(wt) and plug in for the times they give you. Also, for some reason your calculator must be in radians mode for this to work, even though you're working with degrees. Not sure why, but it worked."

So then when you go to part b, you have the wrong value for k.    This is what seems to be happening for most people who have come and asked me about this problem.  Things to consider: I would do this problem using energy conservation. The catch is, as you stretch the trampoline, there is a little bit of extra potential energy that is released as you fall that extra distance...  Hint 2: if you didn't solve a quadratic equation, you didn't do it right."
PhascinatingPhysics,30zyt7,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Wed Apr 1 02:56:26 2015 UTC,Doing the quadratic equation gets you two answers(obviously). But how do you determine which number to use? Would it be the negative because that it is being stretched down? Or are you supposed to plug the number(s) from the quadratic into something else?
PhascinatingPhysics,30zyt7,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Thu Apr 2 00:06:42 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you set up your equations at the start, and where you placed the ""zero"" displacement."

I went back, did the quadratic, and preceded to get an answer for part (a) that was even farther away from the right answer than what I originally got. I am thoroughly lost with this one. I just hope we don't have to do any quadratics on the quiz."

Although it looks like a weak version of surfing, it is so much more. SUPping requires balance and strength in your arms, core, and legs. I started to SUP two years ago, and I love doing it every summer on a lake up in New Hampshire. Although almost anyone can do it, SUP requires a lot of work to master. There are many people who take SUP to the next level by doing advanced yoga on their boards. If you've never tried it, I highly recommend!"

Well, turns out Mythbusters did a show on this. Slow-moving bullets will go into the water for several feet.  Fast moving bullets like those shot from a rifle or a machine gun will simply shatter when they hit the water. Pretty neat."

PhascinatingPhysics,30nu9d,KSF_WHSPhysics,2,Sun Mar 29 15:11:41 2015 UTC,I think a big thing about it is that you eventually weigh if it's worth your time (even if its not busy work or should you just cheat your way through it and take nothing from it.

It's extremely hard to go through a day after have 3 weeks of 5-6 hours of sleep, especially if  your classes are all honors and AP where paying attention in class is actually important.

The american school system/culture is very different and I find it difficult to understand why anyone would put extracurricular activities such as sports or work before education. However, that's just my personal opinion. It's just a cultural difference I guess. lol  Also, I find that especially with math and science classes, a lot of practice is what makes the difference between a B+ and a 100. Although this research may have proved otherwise, my personal experience tells me more practice definitely can't hurt.

When you get scared, embarrassed or anxious- your face flushes you get hot and sweaty, you are have a psychogenic fever. Your body temperature actually increases when you're stressed, its warming up the muscles in order to go through fight or flight. This was meant to help deal with threats, but now a days we aren't threatened by bears, but instead school, work, and family matters. Cortisol (called the stress hormone) affects blood pressure, metabolism, and immune reactions such as inflammation. When dealing with chronic stress your body continually releases cortisol. Your body then burns out on cortisol and no longer reacts to it. The excessive inflammation can lead to heart disease, obesity, and it can cause some mental health disorders. This inflammation can also damage your DNA."

This video answers the question: Will the ocean run out of fish? Over the past few decades fishing returns have been going down each year. This means we have been overfishing our seas. Overfishing is when more fish are caught than can be naturally reproduced in a year. Most human history fishing fleets were made of local boats. With the technology that came in the 1900s fishing became an enterprise. For a time all was good, but in the 1990s fish species were nearing extinction. The Atlantic Cod was dropped down to 1% of its previous levels off the coast of Canada in 1992. More fish include pacific tuna, sardines, Chilean Sea Bass, and even whales."

This article looks at how the amygdala - a brain region - results in our own implicit racist biases. To test for these biases, a lot of experiments were conducted, such as free association ones. During these tests, it was found that people were far more likely to associate negative words with black faces than white faces. Even more disturbing was the level of implicit racism in medical doctors. It was found that white doctors were less likely to administer potentially life saving drugs to black, Hispanic, and Asian patients. Furthermore, they were more likely to recommend unnecessary surgeries on these minorities as well. This experiment could very well explain why certain diseases are more widespread in certain races than others. For example, in my capstone I found that white people were far less likely to get kidney disease while black people were most likely (which fits along with the fact that black people are also more likely to get diabetes since diabetes is a huge risk factor for kidney disease).

PhascinatingPhysics,301fsj,ECF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:15:34 2015 UTC,"For number 8, it doesn't really matter 4 or two. What matters is that the translational energy is twice the rotational energy at the start, and the potential energy at the end is the total of the two and the end. So you could do 6 & 3, then 9, if you wanted.   For #3, essentially the vector can be moved, so long as it remains in the se relation ship with the center of mass. Pulling up from above is the same as pushing up from below. If you drew a free-body diagram, the two would be equivalent.   So when you move that second vector we had so much trouble with in class to the upper corner, it makes the math a lot easier, particularly the relationship between the angle and the force/radial vectors.   Try it with actual numbers and see.   In all fairness, I remember this exact problem giving lots of headaches even to a class of physics teachers, and understandably so. We debated and debated for a long time. What really matters here is less the actual answer and more that your process of thinking about the relationships is correct. That the total torque is the net torque, CW vs CCW, the dependence of torque on the radial distance from the pivot, the magnitude of the force, and the angle between the two. If you understand the concepts driving this problem (even if the particulars are snaggly) then I think you will be in good shape."

It allows us to take a glimpse into how the world really is and question whether our existence on this planet really even makes a difference. All that we construct and modify on our planet is in our favor, but when we're not around, the world seems to work out just perfect the way it is.

PhascinatingPhysics,2zyt3s,CMN_APPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 23 03:25:00 2015 UTC,Just an idea: Could these sinkholes be somehow converted into homes in a low-cost or same-cost way in comparison to building a house? I think underground construction in places like Florida (where there is little danger of getting snowed in or something similar) could offer an alternative to building homes above such an unstable foundation such as a sinkhole. Just a thought...

These ""mini black holes"" (actually quantum mechanical black holes) are a hypothetical component of the universe, whose required creation energies would be low enough for the LHC to create if the eleventh dimensional spacetime postulate was correct. These black holes, on top of having a literally quantum-scale event horizon, would almost instantaneously evaporate. There is really, REALLY, no conceivable danger to creating them. If you were to create one in a room, next to a wine glass placed precariously at the edge of a table, the wine glass would not fall over, let alone end the world. And as to why the research at the LHC is more important than going to the moon again for no discernable or useful reason because ""space"", I implore you to take into consideration just how much the greatest scientific experiment in human history has accomplished thus far.  CERN on the LHC  Prof. Hawking on why the LHC is important  In the end, the concerns raised, as well as this article, are completely baseless and stem from a total lack of understanding of any of the developments they are raised over. It is just about as sensible as worrying that wearing sunglasses indoors will blow up your house. It isn't based off fact, it isn't based of logic, it's based off of ignorance and an unwillingness to develop an understanding of developments rather than a fear of developments one doesn't understand."

There exists a power series of 't' that converges for all real 't' that can detail any system of 'n' greater than or equal to three. But this solution, given by Quidong Wang, has a depressing catch. Although it gives a convergent solution, the solution converges slowly. So slowly, in fact, that to calculate the motion over the course of a few moments would require the numerical values of millions of terms. The solution is a valid solution, but it is effectively useless for actually analyzing the motion of an 'n-body' system.

PhascinatingPhysics,2z36ew,BJB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:01:37 2015 UTC,It's great that if something like this ever became a reality it could be so cheap because traveling by plane over any distance is very expensive.
PhascinatingPhysics,2z36ew,MAD_WHSPhysics,0,Mon Mar 16 03:02:34 2015 UTC,"This sounds amazing even if it is really expensive to build... I mean if it is solar powered and used pulses of air to move the train (at like 700mph?!?? I didnt even know air could do that much lol) then i guess the investment is worth it if lots of people use it. I think investing in broadly used hyperloops is like investing in a hybrid/electirc car. The initial cost is much much more expensive then others but when used alot, it actually saves money and its better for the enviorment too~ win-win!"

Social jet lag, the idea that we have to wake up before our natural rhythms want us to wake up affects 70 percent of the population. Difficulty waking up is called Sleep Inertia. Sleep Inertia is described as ""A temporary period of reduced alertness and impaired performance"". Symptoms include poor memory and reaction time, inability to perform basic math and suffering of alertness or attention. These symptoms last for hour. The best way to deal with these is to turn on the light (not your phone) preferably sunlight and get going."

I am going to start using this term when I explain to people why its so hard to get up because it sounds a lot more intelligable than the explanation that I was too tired. This does make sense though because like Newton's law says that an object in motion tends to stay in motion and an object at rest tends to stay at rest, it is a hard transition from sleeping to being awake. Also, I would like to see a study done on math grades between students that have math in the morning and those who have it in the afternoon because all of the AP Calc classes are first block and I feel as though this isn't very  logical."

The ideal thing would be to move the whole school day later on to work with our sleep cycles but it's pretty obvious that's not gonna happen. I remember reading somewhere that Art/Creative classes (English, Music, Art, etc.) are best to have in the morning because our brain actually absorbs that type of information better earlier in the day.

Each sleep cycle is roughly an hour and a half, and it is the easiest to wake up between sleep cycles. Working back from when I wake up (6 am), the best times for me to fall asleep are 10:30 or 12:00."

PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,GBM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:27:47 2015 UTC,I have always been curious of this. I have always thought was just because you had been asleep for a long period of time. This was a very interesting thing to learn.
PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,BNB_HPhysics_4,1 point,Mon Mar 16 01:53:06 2015 UTC,Maybe the reason that so many people have sleep inertia is because we are forced to wake up before our brains start to function normally which is around 9 or 10am. School should start later so everyone can be as mentally prepared as possible

PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,DMA_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"waking up after not enough sleep is the hardest thing to do. It made sense that when you are in the deepest stage of sleep, waking up abruptly hits the hardest. I think this happens often when it comes to students because many do not get a full 8 hours of sleep, and are woken up in the middle of the sleep cycle. I am totally one of those people who hits snooze 10 times and sets a bunch of different alarms and I can see that it does not help at all"

I guarantee I am in stage three when I wake up cause I usually have a brutal time getting up.

PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,MAD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 16 02:48:07 2015 UTC,This explains why it is so difficult for people to get out of their bed early for school and why everyone is so out of it in the beginning of the day. Maybe if school started later students would get more out of their education.
PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,AKL_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:00:01 2015 UTC,This really addresses the topic of school times starting later. A students need a sufficient amount of sleep in order to get the most out of school. Waking up so early disrupts a sleep cycle and makes students feel exhausted throughout the day.
PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,kef_hasto,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:06:10 2015 UTC,I use to have an app that I used and it would record your sleep cycle and wake you up at the best possible time and I loved it and thought it really worked.

PhascinatingPhysics,2z1lqg,DDI_APPhysicsC,1 point,Mon Mar 16 03:47:44 2015 UTC,"For one, it's the fact that we're getting so little sleep. We're supposed to get 7-8 hours of sleep per night (for me, it feels like 15 hours is not enough to feel good after a week of school :D), yet we teens get 4-5 on average. We're also going to bed at different times, so our sleeping cycles are often broken by the alarm, which makes waking up exceptionally hard (especially if you're in REM/deep sleeping phase). A third factor that plays a role is the extreme stress and mental exhaustion that we are exposed to at school. To me, it would seem that the brain would ""want"" to alleviate this stress by sleeping more. I think these three reasons make it so hard to wake up."

I found it interesting than quartz forms when magma cools and is one of the last minerals to solidify, making it stronger than the other minerals being formed.  It was also interesting that when a stream flows into the ocean, all the rocks stay in the stream and the sand and other little pieces of sediment such as clay flow into the ocean.  But because the sand is heavier than the clay, only the clay will continue to go into the ocean where as the sand ""drops off"" and forms beaches."

Let's give an example: Let's say you have a dream and in this dream you see your father as a Lizard-Man. Now you and dear old Lizard-Dad have a regular conversation about life or what have you. When I first mentioned Lizard what was your first idea of the Lizard, were you creeped out or inspired or nervous or whatever. This small case exemplified why there are soft sciences, they change from case to case and using this basic ideology of what a soft science is than saying Geology is a soft science can hold water.

The speed of the spacecraft has to exceed the gravitational pull of Earth's orbit, it has to continue at a speed that will resist gravity so that it can orbit the Earth without crashing back down. The difficulty of space travel stems from the challenge of making objects that have the ability to move at a continuous and unimaginable speed that we can't experience on Earth."

Another awesome video from another one of my favorite YouTube channels: CGP Grey. Here, Grey talks about ""thought germs"" and how thoughts spread through people, gain traction, and gain opposition.  Recall that {PoP!}s are worth 15 points, awarded for this {PoP!} as follows:   4 points for your thoughtful reaction/response to the original video 4 points for your thoughtful answer to discussion starter. 4 points for first meaningful and worthwhile comment that adds to the discussion at hand (Comments such as ""hey, yeah, I agree"" or ""yeah, this was cool"" will not count as meaningful nor worthwhile as they do not add to the discussion in a meaningful or worthwhile way.) 3 points for second meaningful and worthwhile comment   Remember that PoPs! Don't count for weekly participation points.  DISCUSSION STARTER: An example that immediately come to my mind about differing viewpoints causing an idea or thought to spread faster is the ""Gold & White vs. Black & Blue Dress"" debate that was all the rage last week.  Do you think that this debate would have entered the American zeitgeist so quickly, had everyone seen the same color?  Or if people hadn't gotten so upset about what others saw?  It may be helpful to reinforce your idea with a different example...  I am also going to tag the man himself: CGP Grey in the off-chance that he decides to drop in and share is own thoughts and theories and feedback about the video.

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,JHF_APPhysics1_6,5,Wed Mar 11 14:00:26 2015 UTC,"I think the dress is a perfect analogy, particularly since it was so recent and took the Internet by storm. However, it was more like the plague that burnt itself out too quickly, rather than continuing. I think this is because it lacked the means to continue controversy, and for example, the ""black and blue camp"" was not really compelled enough to create hateful thought germs about the ""gold and white"" camp. Also, this didn't last as long because the dress was definitively known to be black and blue. The perfect thought germ would be on something abstract, and probably unconfirmable. That way, no one can figure out the ""right"" answer, and there will always be argument."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RP_APPhysics_6,3,Wed Mar 11 21:30:26 2015 UTC,"I agree. Something that really invokes debate will  likely make a very good germ. Otherwise it becomes a passing thought among millions that we have. It takes a special kind to make it memorable, and what better way to do this then to make us angry over a topic and make it controversial?"
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,ncs_whsphysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:40:08 2015 UTC,"I was thinking the same thing when I watched this video! However, I disagree when you said it didn't cause hate germs.  For example, some people took the topic too seriously and got angry when someone didn't agree that the dress was black and blue, even after they released it was actually black and blue. This anger would carry over to someone else who takes the topic too seriously and they would have the same emotions. I do agree however that it didn't last long (about a week), even though it made it onto the news."

People want things settled and without a definitive answer to the debate on the spot it caused global chaos on the Internet, even some girls were adding a whole new debate on whether they would or wouldn't wear the dress in public."

I felt myself getting so angry over the color of a dress and I didn't even know why. The germ analogy is the perfect way to describe my reaction
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RFD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:46:13 2015 UTC,"I think this is a great idea. When the dress went viral, everyone at WHS (and the entire country) was obsessed about it, as if it was the most important thing in the world. Although the dress came out at first as a cool remark- ""Hey, this dress changes colors""- it turned out to be a huge debate. I agree with RP as well. Something that makes people debate is a great germ, because it makes people think, formulate an opinion, and defend that opinion, rather than blurt something out aimlessly. I think the two camps of ""Gold and White"" and ""Blue and Black"" really shows how a simple comment can turn into a huge hate argument, with angry germs spreading amongst everyone; the mentality was ""if you don't agree with me you're stupid and I'm angry with your opinion"". The dress dilemma really attests to the fact that angry germs spread the most."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RPS_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:49:39 2015 UTC,"i agree with you. i think the dress debate got burnt out so quickly because there was not much to argue about, it was the color of a dress and thats it. Another reason why it may have died out so quickly is that our generation is so short minded, by this i mean that not many people in our generation have a very long attention span and the just want to keep hopping from one thing, to the next, to the next, we as a society now-a-days dont get enjoyment from something for a very long period of time we are alwyas looking for the latest and the greatst."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,SBB_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Mar 12 03:50:58 2015 UTC,"Well, first of all, I think if everyone saw the same color, then no argument would've happened in the first place. Not much evidence I can use to support that, but that's more common sense. People typically don't argue over things they think the same about, like the video said, if it does happen, it'll be about how stupid the other people are that have a different opinion. If people didn't get so upset about it, I'd think it would actually take longer for the whole dress thing to go away. Psychologically, we would probably see that no one else is getting as fiery as we would want and conversations would die down a lot quicker because we loose interest. For example, I've seen a lot of arguments started about two games from the same franchise, Persona 3 and Persona 4, and which is better. Every fan of the franchise, however consider them both amazing games, and can never get angry enough to keep the argument going for too long. So the arguments only last 4-5 posts, ending with someone saying ""Well who cares?"", and that's why anger is so important for a healthy (Not necessarily good) argument."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,SmL_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:33:45 2015 UTC,"Exactly - the reason the dress spread so quickly is because of people always want to believe they're in the right. With two video games, the argument usually comes down to a matter of opinion. With the dress, both sides were completely convinced of the colors they saw, and neither side could fathom why the other were seeing different colors."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,EDS_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:35:57 2015 UTC,that pretty much sums up the whole dress issue tbh haha I couldn't get why people were seeing the dress as black and blue until it legit changed colours infront of me lol People seem to be very passionate about the coulour of that dress for some reason haha. I guess everyone likes being right lol
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,ncs_whsphysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:15:22 2015 UTC,"I agree because disagreement is the spark to all of these arguments starting. If everyone agreed, these angry thought germs would never have spread so quickly. Another effect of everyone agreeing would have meant significantly less people knowing about the dress. Everyone knows about it because its color is in question."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,GBM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:51:59 2015 UTC,The spark was definitely the disagreement among each other. Nobody would have really heard or seen the dress if it wasn't for the way different people viewed the dress. The debate was all about the color.
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,ATB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"I totally agree.  Long strings of posts happen because like you said, anger and passion for a given subject are so intimately intertwined.  If someone firmly believes in one thing, they will argue until at least someone agrees with them.  In our day and age, the stubborn nature of people contributes largely to the length and longevity of arguments.  Neither side believes anything but their own opinion and are absolutely not open to any opposition.  Also, i think people really just enjoy arguing too."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,EDS_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:45:07 2015 UTC,I like how you said you think it would have taken longer for the whole dress debate to die down had everyone not been so routy about is because then we as the internt could have had a civilized discussion about it not a random discombobulated debate about it.
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,ncs_whsphysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:59:08 2015 UTC,"You are 100% right about the ""who cares"" part. The video was a little confusing at first, but then I began to understand it. It interested me that sad thought germs don't get passed on as much. But thinking about it, that is pretty true. People usually keep sadness to themselves. And they spread the other thought germs, like the videos said. And the part about people arguing within their own group about the other group was spot on. Similarly, when the dress picture came out, I was at a pasta fest. The people who saw blue and black (like myself) talked about how the other people who saw gold and white were wrong. Its crazy how some people get so worked up about silly things, but yes anger is very important"
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RFD_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Mar 12 20:37:05 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: I don't think this debate would have entered the American zeitgeist at all.  If everyone saw the same color, there would be no debate. Everyone would see the dress as a normal dress in a store. I feel that if people didn't get so upset and express their emotions about the dress it wouldn't have spread so fast. When people defend their side intensely, it creates more and more emotion that will be let out during the debate. When thousands of people see the comments of emotions, they will choose their side and defend it with their emotions as well. If people didn't argue it so intensely, the debate would be very slow and probably wouldn't have gotten popular. A similar debate that happened on reddit was with the Doritos debate: which color tasted the best. People expressed their opinion very intensely on this, causing it to become popular over this reddit page and we even talked about it a little during class the next day. But if people didn't care about what others said and only thought ""Doritos are food and you eat them as long as they taste good"", the debate probably wouldn't have gotten so many comments and emotional opinions."

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,JLB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:13:26 2015 UTC,"Really good example of the Doritos poll. For that, the only flavor I could eat was Blue, the rest were just... meh to me, but people were very vehemently asserting that their flavor was the best. It comes with the territory of human nature. You wouldn't want your way of thinking to be changing every 2 seconds, so you internalize that your outlook is the only correct one. Problem is, everybody is doing that, which is why we have such debates in the first place. Another great example is how I speak. In Mr. P's original post, he said ""all the rage"", but, growing up, I was taught that the phrase was ""on the rage"". So immediately I went, ""Oh, he's wrong"", but then I realized that, if anything, I'm the one saying wrong. So it's a balancing act of trying to keep your reality stable, while also accepting new ideas into it."

I think the fact that the dress looking different to people was really cool, but it gave people the chance to argue with each other.

It definitely is entertaining however some people take it very seriously and don't realize that it is just a dress."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RPS_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 20:42:19 2015 UTC,"This is a great video that captures how thought germs spread over different situations.  When a picture goes out on the internet that causes a lot of emotions from several people, they comment on their thoughts of the picture. Their thoughts are distributed to others that may have different opinions and emotions. This will cause controversy over the topic and cause each side to back themselves up with their emotions, mostly anger. This is put out over the internet and everyone who sees it picks the side that is the most similar to their emotions and opinions. If the picture is has a lot of arguing where a conclusion is hard to meet, it will go world-wide and last for a long time."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,KSF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:12:15 2015 UTC,"The dress debate fits perfectly in with the logic described in this video. Its popularity was created simply out of the fact that there were so many people disagreeing with each other that it encouraged others to jump in the debate and fight for their opinion. However, as described in the video, the two distinct sides did splinter off and argue with their own. For example, some black and  blue people  claimed they could see gold but no white, creating their own internal debate."

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,ncs_whsphysics,2,Thu Mar 12 01:36:40 2015 UTC,"Eh, I think the dress got so much publicity because basically everyone on social media was arguing between each other. For example, there were posts of the dress that said ""rt for white and gold, fav for black and blue,"" and I saw a lot of conversations that were arguing about the dress. I don't think it would have gotten very far if the first few people to see it just saw the dress and argued in their own head about its color. Furthermore, they probably only saw one color, and would have no reason to argue amongst themselves. Disagreeing opinions from different people make the idea spread."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,AMC_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:30:49 2015 UTC,"I found this video really interesting for many reasons. First of all, it described an idea that I had never thought of before, but that is clear to understand and that makes sense. The idea that thoughts are like germs spreading from one person to another is brilliant, and is a perfect comparison. I don't often use social media, but when I do (Dos Equis reference), the thoughts expressed by others online catch on and make me formulate my own idea, taking on an opinion supporting one side of an argument.  Moreover, I agree that thoughts are germs because they in fact do spread to others. These thoughts are essentially like emotions: emotions usually spread to others. For example, if you are sad or angry, people around you are surrounded by a sad or angry environment (you), and thus can begin to take on these negative attitudes. This works with positive attitudes as well. Nonetheless, I digress. Peoples' thoughts online are mainly based on emotions, and these emotions hop from one person to another. In essence, the ""thoughts"" talked about in the video are mainly emotions, and I found it interesting that emotions hop from one person to another both online and in real life.  Lastly, I think the most interesting part of the video was the fact that angry thoughts spread the most. I thought, rather, that comical ideas or thoughts would spread the most or the quickest. Based on personal experience, I have rarely ever seen any truly angry thoughts online that go viral or spread, although I have seen some angry comments; usually, these negative thoughts are just shut down though, because nobody (me, for example) cares about ragers. However, according to Grey, anger ""escapes bypasses your mental immune system and compels you to share it like nothing else"". Of course, differing viewpoints will cause people to fight, but why it spreads so much. Nevertheless, this video by Grey and the ideas it addresses are great; but the video did not make me angry."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,JLB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:42:33 2015 UTC,"Discussion starter:  I believe that, with the dress situation, if people had seen the same thing, it would not have gone viral and not have taken the internet by storm. However, this is not the case. People fought over which color the dress was, and in a matter of a day, the two camps of ""Black and Blue"" and ""White and Gold"" were squaring off in an internet war, which eventually turned into real-life fights. Also, if people had contained their rage with the opposing viewpoint, I think the dress would not have gone AS viral, but it would still have been very popular, because even without getting angry, it is an interesting topic of debate with different viewpoints, so people want to share their ideas. This dress situation relates to the Twilight series fights over ""Team Edward"" and ""Team Jacob"". If people had agreed or not gotten angry over the argument, it would not have been so important or popular."

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,ECF_WHSPhysics,2,Thu Mar 12 03:22:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say that the dress wouldn't have been popular were it not so controversial. I'm sure there are plenty of pictures of nice dresses on the internet, however, the fact that people saw different things made people want to share it to confirm their opinion. Of course, if you share your opinion with someone so they will confirm it, and they say you're wrong, that's going to make the topic more controversial, you're both going to be doubtful, and you'll show it to someone else to get them to support it, and then it spreads like the plague."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,CMD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.

By showing someone a picture of the dress and they both see different colors, it will start a debate to see who is right and who is wrong.

The one thing I don't understand is the purpose of the argument. Was it incited by the creators of the dress to get the dress some publicity? This is possible, because the photo of the dress only made the dress look like two different sets of colors to different people because of a blue light that was shined on the dress, which is literally blue and black. However, I don't see the point in getting attention in the dress in this way. No one knew where they could buy the dress; the name of the store that it was sold in was not mentioned once as far as I could see. And even if it was, I don't imagine any girl would want to wear a dress that was infamous for this reason; it would be seen as kind of a joke. All the argument will do is inspire a bunch of ""it's white and gold"" captions on prom dress Instagtram posts. So, who really benefited from this argument? I can't figure it out."

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,MEB_WHSPhysics,2,Wed Mar 11 18:49:43 2015 UTC,"Exactly, everywhere I go, I hear ""What color is the dress?"" because everyone wants the person they ask to take their side, and they want as many ""allies"" as possible."

My dad and my grandma once debated over the color of my dad's shirt (whether it was blue or purple) so I imagine things like that happen all the time.

If something's sad, you're not going to try to share it, in fact, you'll probably wish you never saw it to begin with. Also, something that came to me while watching it. CGP Grey said at some point that anger is able to bypass your mental immune system and compels you to share it.

The whole dress debacle was kinda of silly looking back at it, but it was for fun so it shouldn't matter anyways what color it was."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,MRD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"First off, CGP Grey is one of my favorite Youtube channels out there. He always explains things in such a clear and concise manner, and the animations are always great. I especially like the Family Tree video. This video does the same thing, it explains a pretty unique phenomenon in an equally unique way. With ""mind germs"".  This video was interesting, I liked the concept of mind germs. It explains why something, like the color of the dress, can be spread so quickly through a community. The dress was only interesting, however, because each person saw different colors. If the dress was one color for everyone it wouldn't even be comparable to commotion caused by the multi-coloured dress. It would just be an ordinary picture of a dress."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,BMM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"As for the discussion starter, I think it is almost certain to claim that had people seen the same color the ""dress"" would not reach its controversial popularity, nor had it even been posted in the first place. If people hadn't got so upset over the colors of the dress, it may have calmed the debate, however, I do not think it would take away from its global popularity. I feel that this whole fiasco reminds me a lot of the ""Alex From Target"" picture from earlier in the year that led to an Internet explosion and debate over whether this random teen named Alex was attractive or not. Since both were aired on the Ellen show, I think that should be our wake-up call to show how influential the Internet, social media, and these thought germs are to our daily lives."

Also how when we share things on social media its like a sneeze spreading germs to everyone. Angry germs are more likely to be shared. They tend to fight with other angry germs that think differently. This Video explains the more angry germs involve they fight with ones that are similarly to them than opposites. About the opposite angry germ and how they make them angry."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,EMF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:38:35 2015 UTC,"Thoughts and Ideas being compared to germs doesn't sit right with me. Ideas and thoughts exists perpetually in the recesses of our minds, much like kindling for a fire, placed deep within a cluster of branches. Then when certain images evoke the correct emotion that is more like a match added, and then these all come to ignite the fire of the brain. Then your passion towards whatever causes others to feel the same passion or maybe not, causing opposition to the fire. And the rest of this follows the video just with certain words changed, I dunno about y'all but when I hear germs I don't instantly go to passion."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,EMF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:44:10 2015 UTC,I agree in the sense that germs have negative connotations but I think the comparison is accurate.

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,GBM_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:46:00 2015 UTC,I think the reason is that people generally don't want to become depressed.

I definitely think that this debate of which dress it was would not have been at all as much of a big deal if everybody saw the same color. People got so furious that others saw different colors because it made no sense how someone could see something so different. for example, i saw gold and white and i couldn't comprehend at all how my friends and family saw blue and black.. so that led me to sharing it and getting so fired up about it. Overall, i think that this dress would have gotten nowhere if it wasn't such an extreme controversy."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,EMD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Mar 11 22:52:37 2015 UTC,Response: I thought this video was pretty interesting but at the same time a bit weird. The weird part for me at least was that thoughts were compared to germs which to me seems a bit odd. Though it was interesting how a thought travels similar to a virus/plague and develop as it gains more hosts eventually becoming entirely different. The bit where two opposing sides went against one another and the thought survived due to that broke the whole comparison for me. When it comes to germs when two different germs enter the body they don't usually provide a way for the other to remain.
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RMD_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Wed Mar 11 23:59:31 2015 UTC,"The video gives a great explanation as to why and how the thought germs are spread. It is an event or post that we had an opinion on, then it will become more and more popular by people sharing their opinion on the post. I think that one of the only reasons that it spreads so quickly is because people always pick a side. After people pick sides they just continue to argue and voice their opinion on the topic. Discusion: The dress debate wouldn't have been so popular if there wasn't two opposing sides. I know I said blue and black first, then i say white and gold so I saw both sides of the argument. Everybody argued about its color because they saw different colors.  I didn't know why people saw certain colors and I didn't know why I was able to see both. Our thoughts control all of our actions, and some people get really defensive about their opinions. So basically what I am saying is a lot of people enjoy arguing and this is one example of the dumb things people argue about. If everybody saw the same thing then there would have been nothing to argue about."

The fact that memes and pictures are all basically germs that are targeted at our weak points in emotion does sound kind of crazy. However, it definitely does make some sense and could explain the reasons why specific pictures and gifs get so popular within hours of exposure. It also makes sense that these ""germs"" are spread by anger the most because the controversy really fuels the discussion."

With the dress debate I did not think it would get as big as it did, to me it seemed to be another minor social media fad. The colors I saw when watching the news (which happened to be the only time I saw the dress) was white and gold. Not everyone saw this same color scheme and a fair amount of arguments about the colors erupted during some of my classes keeping the topic in everyone's minds. If everyone had seen the some color scheme the whole ""Gold & White vs. Black & Blue Dress"" debate would have ended fairly quickly."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,RMD_APPhysics1_6,1 point,Thu Mar 12 00:06:59 2015 UTC,"Discussion: The only reason that the dress fiasco became popular was because of the disagreement over the color. If everyone saw it as the same color, there would have been no controversy and therefore no popularity over the topic. Disagreement fuels the fire of these germs because people get sucked into the discussion when someone they know asks them their opinion. Like in the case of Coca-Cola vs Pepsi, if everyone agreed that Coke was better (which it is) than that wouldn't have become a popular discussion because no one would have to have argued over it."

The idea that we can spread thoughts isn't  exactly eye opening however it was interesting to view the process on a smaller level. However the more troubling and almost maddening part of this analysis of thought is how people arguing on the same side of the debate often differ in how strong their feelings are for their respective side, therefore creating and individual argument amongst people who supposedly feel the same way. Im considering throwing angry thought germs at the maker of this video."

The entire drive behind Semantics was to change our thinking to become more conscious of the way we think (if that makes sense).

I loved that he explained how emotions are a major factor of how successful a ""thought germ"" is. My favourite part of the whole video though has to be the end where he asks us to share/give this thought germ some help since he isn't appealing to our emotions (since appealing to emotions make a thought germ much more effective. Except for sad/depressing thoughts lol)  That stupid dress would never have gotten so much attention if everyone saw the same colour. The extremely heated debates over the colour of a dress also added fuel to the fire. though I must say I never really understood why everyone was so angry over the colour of a dress instead of being confused haha I don't really have a good/well known example to relate this situation to, but its kind of similar to the shipwars on tumblr when a new episode of a certain anime/cartoon is released. Everyone gets all angry trying to prove they are right and arguing how the other ships (pairings of characters?? idk urban dictionary it lol) are stupid etc. and it all ends up with the shipwars drowning out all the other stuff on my dash ;-; but yeah they're similar since both situations are ""thought germs"" being super successful for a short period of time (kinda like how a firework explodes everywhere but dies out super quick) by appealing to the audience's emotions (in this case anger)"
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,kam_WHSphysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:00:10 2015 UTC,"This idea is something that we learned a lot about in semantics. Thoughts, or ""memes"" (no, not that kind of meme) spread very similarly to germs. I found this to be one of the most interesting concepts in the course, because people study the spreading of memes to find successful trends which a company of some sort can market their products to in order to make money. I believe in this theory completely, but in this video, I heard very little evidence of his theory being true, besides that one bar graph which he did not explain, which annoys me. Regardless, I like the theory overall. But the weird thing is, I don't understand why thoughts function in this way. I mean, no thought ever ""wins."" They all eventually go away. I suppose they work that way because if the people who would benefit from the thought's widespread existence can get the thought to spread, then that would make them quite powerful."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,KMA_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 02:21:37 2015 UTC,"Reaction to discussion starter: Ideas that invoke anger - especially those that people disagree on - cause that idea to spread far more quickly. For example, the gold and white vs. black and blue dress got such a perfect division of opinion that everyone argued about it until everyone with any kind of social media saw it. Even those that did not have social media were shown the picture. Another example of such a thought would be just about any topic in American politics. There are at least two big dogs (Democrats and Republicans) arguing over just about every political idea there could be. This is the essence of democracy. With the voting system, essentially, one side of the thought germ just has to win over the other side of the thought germ, and it may eventually be supported by the government."

I had never really thought of links/ posts are viruses, seeking to infect as many people as possible, but it totally makes sense.  After realizing what the video was trying to say and applying it to things such as reddit and other social media, it amazed me how, (A) I had never noticed and (B) totally right they were.  What interested me the most was the part that talked about knowing your brain.  The video ultimately shows us that argumentation over the internet and other useless forms of sharing is, in its essence, useless.  As a result, allowing yourself to get caught up in the madness and at times, actually become enraged by what people are saying is not worth it at all. In the end it adds very little to the argument and in turn, causes more hopeless feuding.  I can really apply this to my real life because as my family so eagerly points out, I allow my self to get too mad and snap too easily.

It would have been some boring old, basic picture of someone asking for others opinions.  In fact, when my brother showed it to me, thats all that i thought that it was, and that he was trying to pull some dumb joke on me.  It was only when i realized that others had a different opinion from what i clearly saw as the right option, that i entered into the hopeless debate.  Another great example of such an event can be seen with the story of the young woman in the middle east who was physically beaten for expressing herself.  As Americans, many saw it as totally wrong, but when looked at from other male-dominated cultures, it was completely acceptable.  This in turn made the story so large and is a huge factor as to why she probably won the nobel peace prize."

People not only argued about what colors they saw, but they also argued about how you see what you saw and what was right. The picture sparked people to research about the actual dress. People who saw the same color turned to each other when they needed support but also competed with each other over the reason why.

People spread thoughts in conversation but now with al, the options for social media, it is a thousand times easier to retweet, reblog, or share a thought. Not only does social media make it quicker, but it makes it accessible to even more people, making the thought germ so much more contagious.

This guy made his point really well with a witty and entertaining dialogue along with simple and easy to follow visuals. I got the message, and I was laughing ridiculously hard the entire time. Content-wise, I think the whole construct and spread of ideas has definitely become a sort of germ breeding ground for thought, especially when new thoughts are so much more easily accessible now via technology. It seems slightly ironic how arguments will inevitably evolve into one side talking about the other, once agreement has been reached. I'm glad he touched on that point as well; that once we agree there isn't much else to say. A great deal of speech is trying to reach some kind of agreement. Discussion starter: The dress debate wouldn't have even become such a divisive argument had everyone seen the same color. There'd be nothing to discuss in the first place, since we'd all be in agreement. The fact that everyone got so fired up over it just enforces the fact that it spread so quickly.

While this video says thoughts that provoke anger spread more I totally agree and see it in myself. If a thought angers me, the more I think about it the more I want to say it outloud. This video does a really good job of putting thoughts into perspective and allows the viewer to relate and learn."

First, it's pretty obvious that the most controversial topics spread like wildfire. For example, when the Boston marathon bomber was on the cover of time, people were outraged but that magazine sold the most amount of copies ever. The video also said that thinking will never end in an argumentative discussion, basically that a discussion will go on forever. I disagree with that point as well. You mentioned the black and blue dress, and that was quite a heated debate and it fizzled out just like every other argument eventually does, people get tired of fighting, or ""thinking"" as the video calls it. While some arguments will always be relevant like racism and gay marriage, we will eventually grow out of them. One thing the video said is that funny ideas get improved and made funnier and thus become more popular over time, and I immediately thought of the game telephone. Where you start with a boring sentence and by word of mouth it transforms into something utterly hilarious."

PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,BJB_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:31:35 2015 UTC,"I think an obvious answer to you question is why would the dress need to be discussed if everyone saw it the same? If everyone saw things or thought the same way there would just be no need for debate because it would be known how everyone feels and there would be nothing more to say. Clearly something that has 2 obvious opposing viewpoints, will have a debate and more and more people will want to join in, especially on a silly controversy such as the color of a dress. But, I dont think an idea simply being controversial is what makes it spread. It's more how many people are knowledgable enough on an issue to get involved."
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,TML_HAstronomy,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:33:31 2015 UTC,Discussion: the problem with the dress debate is that one side is actually correct. With an argument there is no correct answer. That is what fuels the fire for the dramatics of the argument. People want answers so they make up their own and want others to agree. An example of this is who will be the best president of the United states. Politics is all based upon argument
PhascinatingPhysics,2yo4s3,AA_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 12 03:38:41 2015 UTC,I don't think the dress would have been a big deal if everyone saw the same color because the first people to see it wouldn't have started the argument over what color it was.

I like how Grey used the analogy of germs to thoughts because they are quit similar when you think about it, they both spred from one person to another, can spread rather quickly and contagiously, and they can get stuck in peoples minds, infect them. Discussion Starter: I do not think that the dress debate would have entered our minds and media so quickly if people had seen the same color or if people hadn't gotten so riled up about it. First off , if people saw the same color than there would have not been anything to debate over. Also if they did not get so upset then they may have heard the other sides argument out and seen their reasoning and thought process. The biggest example of differing veiw points that comes to my mind is the debate over gay marriage. I know this may be a touchy subject and im not trying to start any debates on this subreddit, all I am saying is I think that if people took a second and stepped back to see it how how the victims of this debate have it, they might change their mind a bit and things may be a bit better for everyone."

It is just one event that we had an impression on, then we shared it via internet and the other people picked up and found it interesting, then they kept on sharing it. But I think the reason why such an event can spread out so fast is because it is controversial. Different people have different thoughts about a same event so they argue against back and forth, then other people jump in and support either sides, the arguments grow bigger and bigger, with the convenient of the internet, the event soon become a global controversy.   For the DISCUSSION STARTER: The dress debate wouldn't have entered the global zeitgeist so quickly had everyone seen the same color. Everybody talked and argued about its color because they saw it differently. Personally, I saw it as white&gold, but others said it was black&blue. I didn't know why they saw it that way and probably they didn't know why I saw it white&gold either. But thoughts control the brain, people keep claiming that they are right about the color of the dress and call the opposite side insane, colorblind,etc. And we like arguing so there we go, the debate was spread all over America and worldwide."

Tomorrow we are doing a lab that is strikingly similar to the worksheet you guys were supposed to do today in class...  Which is essentially applying Newton's Second Law for Rotation to a ""real-world"" situation.  It is also very similar to quite a few of the homework problems. Hopefully the combination of the lab and the ability to ask me questions tomorrow either before/after school will help everyone get a better handle on the homework. REMEMBER This is just a ""new"" version of old concepts.  All you are doing is summing any and all torques trying to rotate something and setting that equal to Iα  Then you can add in regular plain old F=ma to get any additional terms you need.  Rotation as a whole is much easier if you can get your head around the fact that it really is the same things as we did September through February, but with different variables.   Hope that helps!"

Remember that the net torque = dL/dt, and since you have velocity, you simply plug in a where you have v. Solve for a and you should get your answer!"
PhascinatingPhysics,2ykz64,ECF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue Mar 10 18:04:35 2015 UTC,"This problem is actually a lot easier than you think...  You have to use F=ma and τ=Iα in combination with each other to get the answer...  But, since you are given a, it's a little easier than some of the others.  You can do F=ma for each of the blocks.  Knowing that the forces perpendicular to the ramps cancel each other out, you can get an expression for the net force acting on each block.  For instance, on the right-hand block, there would be a component of the weight acting down the ramp (mgsinθ) and the tension pulling up the ramp.  Pick a direction to be negative, and add them together to get ma.  The same is true for the left-hand block, but you have to make sure you are consistent with your directions and negative signs...  Then you find the tensions in the string.  Once you know the tensions, you can find the net torque, because each tension will apply a torque to the pulley.  Then you just add the torques (again, paying attention to direction and negative signs) to get net torque.  Hope that helps."

It is revealed here that by pressing snooze, drifting away again causes you to go back into the first sleep stage of the cycle which can be hard to wake up from. When you do wake up from it again suddenly, you can feel groggy and this makes it even harder for you to get up. Furthermore, when it feels hard to get up in the morning, your brain registers this as you not having a good night of sleep. Another negative effect is sleep inertia. This is where waking up suddenly and feeling groggy causes your cognition skills to be delayed despite the fact that you are awake. It can take up to two or three hours for these skills to normalize.

PhascinatingPhysics,2yaqcr,SRJ_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun Mar 8 19:50:01 2015 UTC,"That depends on the reason it went extinct. If it was eliminated along with its natural habitat then other similar organisms wouldn't be likely to evolve in the same way. Aside from that, evolution happens over hundreds and thousands of years, with very slight genetic mutation determining who survives over generations. It's not really an ideal replacement for any species lost. The likelihood that another species of perhaps the same Genus even would evolve genetically in the exact same way as the one gone extinct isn't likely. It's more so that it could get relatively close genetically but it would be likely classified as a different species of that extinct organism."

There is an arbitrary assignment of human cognitive abilities as the basis of the measure of intelligence in all organisms. When an animal displays cognitive abilities similar to our own, we dub it more intelligent than those whose brains work differently. In reality, we are not the basis of intelligence, and our conceptualization of it is relevant only within the bounds of our own evolutionary niche. When comparing the 'intelligence' of organisms that have developed through different selective pressures, and assigning an arbitrary base of intelligence with which to compare them, one is bound to find an artificial means to claim the inferiority of such organisms."

PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,BAG_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:35:11 2015 UTC,I think all those interviewed thought in the short term mindset. No one will take the bets because they value the $10 in their pocket as highly important. Long term viewpoint would suggest that that $10 is not significant and the chance to make profit on a fair coin is worth the risk.

When you think of the immediate effects of maybe loosing ten dollars you would not take the risk as you feel the negative outweighs the positive. However, if you think long term effect loosing ten dollars is really not that big of a deal. Thinking long term would make me more likely to take the risk than if I only thought about the immediate effect if I lost. I agree with Derek's example of having more chances to flip the coin that this will pay off in the end. I think people have to at least take some risks. I think taking no risks at all will not get someone ahead. I feel that if I was in this situation I would say no to Derek's first offer. I think I would be more likely to take the risk of having 100 tries to flip the coin because statistics would be on my side."

They need to see the long term and how $10 is worth taking a reasonable risk for great reward.

PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,ker_whsphysics,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:16:33 2015 UTC,"Dicussion starter: Risk vs. reward is about taking a chance and feeling unsure, if you were to think about this concept over a period of time your behavior would vary. Taking risks is based on your level of comfort and self confidence, however it can result in a lot of anxiety and second guessing. But as you take more and more risks over time, progress can be made. For example, I used to be really nervous skiing down a double black diamond (the hardest trail). Often when I was younger I would opt out for the easier cut through, opposed to the steep and challenging slope. As some days I would choose to step outside my comfort zone and take a risk skiing down the trail: overtime it became easier and enjoyable."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,KJH_WHSphysics,1 point,Wed Mar 4 23:00:01 2015 UTC,"This video was interesting. At first I was surprised that no one was taking the risk to win $10-20 even though they may loose $10. However, when I thought about it I realized there is no way I would take that risk because I would not want to lose $10. I feel like I would be more mad at myself if I took the risk and ended up loosing ten of my own dollars than I would be happy if I won $10. The only way I would take that bet is if Derek was offering me at least $50 is I won. I would however take the risk if the coin was flipped 100 times because I would have a better chance of winning money than loosing.  Discussion Starter: I agree with Derek's ""Theorem Statement"" that the idea presented can be applied to risk vs. reward decisions on a day-to-day basis. If you think about the immediate effects of risk vs. reward, you will probably be more apt not to take the risk in fear of losing money, but if you think about it over the long-term, I would take the risk because you have a much better chance of winning money than losing. I agree that by taking risks over time you will come out ahead because if you don't take risks you will just stay the same and a lot of times it requires risks to get ahead in life. Although it may be scary to take a risk, you have to think about the long term effects, not just the immediate effects."

I never think about long term bets, i only think of the one. the outcome scares me. I don't buy scratch tickets because i don't want to lose money. i feel like the odds are against me.

I think it would take the difference to be at least $50 to $10 to get me to take the bet.

I think that thinking about the long term would change my behavior by letting me see that more risks are worth taking and the outcomes can be really beneficial.

PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,MAD_WHSPhysics,1 point,Mon Mar 9 22:37:55 2015 UTC,I thought this video was interesting and gave me a point of view on risk taking that I probably never would have considered. It's easy to say no to one chance at a 50/50 bet but over time there is a greater chance of gaining. The way he examined everything also made the video more interesting to watch. I think based on the Theorem Statement looking at risks long term rather than short would make me more likely to take them. When there is only one chance to win something 50/50 it's easier to say no but with more chances there is a better chance of gaining something. Most people don't want to risk loosing any money so they would say no to the first offer in the video but as the offers increase it makes sense that more would say yes because they have a better chance of winning something.

That's why things like the stock market and investing freak me out! If I had the chance to gain maybe $100 and only lose $10 I would probably take the bet because if i lost it would only be $10 compared to me losing $100."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,BNB_HPhysics_4,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:10:41 2015 UTC,"Discussion starter: I think it's easier to think of risk taking as a more broad term than it is to actually take risks when you're in the situation. I think taking risks could benefit people by stepping out of their comfort zone, because in the end you could like the outcome and you'd be glad that you took the risk. Yet, if the risk had a negative outcome you would have regret about ever taking the risk. It's a really complicated issue but I think it depends on your personality and the way you approach life and risk taking."

I also would not have gone for it but it was just interesting to see that the majority of other people also went with this decision. The guaranteed money aspect of the numerous bets was also very intriguing. However, many people continued to hesitate even though it was basically a guaranteed win in their favor."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,WDR_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:10:51 2015 UTC,"Derek's ""Theorem Statement"" was interesting. I believe, if given time ti think about it, people would go for the bet. It could also come down to other multiple factors such as what kind of day the person is having, good or bad, and so on. Taking risks over time will usually put the person ahead. There are greater chances of winning the more one risks as seen in the video. Behavior would change in a sense of becoming more comfortable with chances.  Bonus: I was the JV football captain for the past two years. Every away game I had to call the coin toss just like in the video. Every single time, I called tails. It was my go to call. This definitely paid off because I won the majority of the coin tosses. And of course, I absolutely took the ball first."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xxt1b,BAG_WHSPhysics,1 point,Thu Mar 5 04:20:51 2015 UTC,"As soon as the video began, I knew what the trick was going to be. As I am taking AP statistics currently, we have already discussed how flipping a coin with wagers on each one is in the favor of the better. When averaged, the person betting is ""guaranteed"" a small amount of win on each toss. This is why Veritasium says you are guaranteed nearly $500. I was also taken back by how many people didn't take the 50-10 bet. They must have edited out certain interviews where people accepted their bet. Not every person should say no to these reasonable offers.  Discussion Starter: I am unsure where I stand on Vertisium's theorem that concentrating on the long term gains rather than the risks is safer. This theorem seems like it can sway for the greater good or go horribly wrong. Focusing long term can be very helpful like doing a S.U.P.E.R. project in advance and not on a Sunday night. You ""risk"" not having an enjoyable afternoon, but in the long term you don't have to worry about it any longer. The negatives to this theorem could be that you don't weight the risks heavy enough and simply focus too much on the long term benefits. The risk could turn out significantly worse than previous imagined if pushed as a secondary thought behind the long term."

You see the bet as a sure thing, but probably only because of your background and knowledge of statistics.  Using that, you see that over time, on average, you are guaranteed to win money.  Most people, however, just see the individual game: I could lose $10.  They don't look at the long-term plan.  I mean, if you win a $50-10 bet even once, that pays for five games.  And out of those remaining four, are you likely to lose all four?  Not very.  I do wonder if anyone asked how many times they get to play.  As in, maybe I wouldn't take the $50-10 bet if I only got one shot.  But if I knew going into it that I could play ten times, I would be more likely to risk the cash."

DISCUSSION STARTER ANSWER:  I think that the risk vs. reward theorem is interesting and that over long periods of time it could change your behavior a lot instead of immediately.

Also in the second video, the object appears to be rolling up the ramp but if you look closer the center of mass is actually rolling down. In the third video, it seems at one point wheels are actually rolling up hill but it is most likely due to elastic collisions that conserve kinetic energy to continue the wheels climb."

For the first one, I had a fair idea of why cars and bikes seemed to roll uphill. It's easy to imagine the concept behind the mysterious road on a small scale, but when it applies to an entire hill, it seems like borderline witchcraft. It's all a matter of perspective.  For the second video, I felt kind of annoyed because the camera only shows the rail from a side view at first, and does not show the increasing width until later. But after that was cleared up, it was a pretty neat illusion. Are we going to be studying magic tricks in the next chapter?  I really liked the third video--anything Rube Goldberg-related is automatically cool in my book. It was all masterfully done, and I liked the use of all the shiny metal cogs and car parts. However, I can't seem to understand how the tires at this part move up the ramp. Part of me believes there's weights near the top-right part of the inside of the tires, but the tires are propped up in a state of equilibrium, until the first tire knocks them all down. Part of me also believes it's witchcraft again."

Knowing the object's shape, I concluded that the track must get wider, allowing more of the object to 'slide in' and in turn causing it to rotate.

Second video: I liked this video, too, but not as much as the first one.

I then suspected that the two rods would diverge in order for the 2-sided cone to remain at constant height.  Third video: This seemed computer-generated, but even if it was I appreciate the creativity and imagination involved. I think that it's an interesting idea to consider the tires rolling uphill a conservation of energy/momentum, but it doesn't seem like there was a large impulse to give it enough kinetic energy to get the tires up the hill. Given the other two videos' reliance on visual tricks, something must be rotten in the state of Denmark (way-ho, that's a Hamlet joke and a joke on the commercial because the steering wheel was on the wrong side of the car #MURICA). Please excuse me.  Discussion starter: I'm going out on a limb and saying that these videos do not defy fundamental physical principles.

The second video did a good job at showing what happened in the first video on a smaller scale model. I like how they showed the ramp both with an object going down hill and then the other one going up hill. I also liked how they made use of the onscreen ruler to show clearer how the center of mass doesn't move so the object technically is only moving in a straight line, not up hill. The final video was really interesting because it was such an intricate contraption. In this video, the three wheels that roll up the ramp seemed out of the ordinary.

For the first video, as they explained, it was a matter of optical illusion due to a poor reference frame. A similar exploit of frames of reference would be the relativity of velocity and rest without a reference frame (if you are moving at a constant speed, it's indistinguishable from being at rest and your reference frame moving). The second video is a matter of geometry. From the first shot of rolling up the cone, it can be observed that more and more of the cone 'falls' through the ramp. Thus, it can be concluded without the hints at the end that the ramp gets wider at the top, and this geometry is responsible for the upward rolling. The tire scene in the last video is the result of a careful placement of weights in the tires. Without an outside force, they are in perfect-enough equilibrium so as not to rotate. Once they receive a knock, the weight causes an angular acceleration that momentarily overcomes gravity, rolling up the hill. Once the weight hits its lowest point in the tire, it cannot make it back up again and gravity takes hold once more. This can be observed by following the top of the tire with your eyes during its climb."

Even though they can be very true, sight is probably the easiest sense to distort. This really made me think about how mystical this must have seemed to the people who first noticed this and one can easily see how this hill got its fame.  The second video would be really great if he had explained the physics behind it better. Once I saw him pick up the cone and saw how it acted on the track it was pretty obvious that he was using its shape to the advantage of the illusion. The fact that the CM went down really only means that gravity was doing what it does best...and he's just using that to make it seem like it's going up due to the shape of the track. There's also something about this guy that makes him pretty awk, but that may just be a bad first impression on my part.  The third video was by FAR the best. The amount of energy transfers going on and the different ways they were accomplishing that made it all the better. I just didn't understand the wheel going up the ramp so that made it a little bit iffy. It seemed pretty fake when I first watched it but then again, so many things are edited in video production that it could by possible that something has been done either to enhance or correct the image to make it look like that. As a commercial, it was pretty cool but I'm not sure I'd be dead set on buying that car after watching. However, if it came with the Rube Goldberg-machine, that's a whole different story!"
PhascinatingPhysics,2xs8hc,DJC_HPhysics_2,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:56:17 2015 UTC,"Of course these objects don't defy gravity. In fact, all of them depend on gravity and just go to show how cool it can really be when used by people who know how to take advantage of it. The first video was very clearly just a huge optical illusion that still depended on gravity to take the object ""uphill"" (downhill). That just good old Cons. of E. The second video depended on gravity (as shown by the falling CM) and the shape of the object and the track to provide the illusion. The third video was just a masterful demonstration of Cons. of E and Cons of Momentum spread across all of the different moving parts. Ironically, even though these video may seem to defy gravity, they are actually wholly dependent on it!"
PhascinatingPhysics,2xs8hc,DJC_HPhysics_2,1 point,Wed Mar 4 05:12:29 2015 UTC,"First Video - I thought the whole optical illusion thing was pretty cool.  It reminded me of an exhibit that had mind tricks on display at the Museum of Science.  The fact that someone's perspective can change the slope of a hill is just amazing.  Second Video - Again, the whole illusion that something is rolling uphill when it is going down is interesting.  In this case, the fact that the track forks apart being hidden hides the fact that it is not actually rolling uphill, is pretty ingenious.  I was shocked to see when the CoM going down.  Third Video - I think I saw this video last year when we made the Rube Goldberg machines last year.  These machines are so difficult to actually get to work correctly, and the fact that they got this complex machine to work properly is just amazing.  Respect to the people who make cool commercials like this."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xs8hc,DDI_APPhysicsC,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:07:35 2015 UTC,"Discussion Starter: These videos don't defy physics, they just trick us.  In the first one, they proved using surveying equipment and photographs of the horizon to show it is really going downhill because of perspective.  In the second one, the guy shows that the object's CoM is moving down, so there is nothing wrong with that.  The third one just has clever balancing of all the parts so they move in a precise manner.  There is no breaking the law here; there is just clever mind games which make people think.  Also for some tricks, when driving down the highway at speed, the view from the right side of the car appears to move faster than the left side.  Not sure on how that works though."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xs8hc,jas_hastro_7,1 point,Thu Mar 5 03:29:48 2015 UTC,"Reaction to first video: The sight of my car speeding uphill would amaze me too if I were there. I initially thought that it might be some sort of illusion, that the hills in the background are tilted in an opposite angle which messes with our eyes. It turns out that this is indeed the case. Definitely a place to live in my lifetime.   Reaction to second video: As others mentioned, it was the shape of the divergence of the two ramps that was behind the whole illusion. My brain still had trouble making sense of this phenomenon though, even after the guy showed the two rails. Great illusion.  Reaction to third video: Oh boy does this bring bad memories from last year. It took Cian and me about 2 weeks to figure out how to do this with a couple of dominoes... let alone this many parts. Most likely a computer model of some sort. At any rate, once again, the tires surprised me. Although the first tire had some momentum from being pushed, it did not appear like it would move so far up such a steep ramp. Unless of course, there was yet another optical illusion (or it might have merely been the result of the computer simulation).   Discussion Starter: For one, the first video reminds me not only of the ""blue-black/gold-white"" dress, but also of the ""light brown, dark brown"" squares. They are all mere optical illusions that rely on the surrounding areas to appear different. Our brains attempt to create an image based on the details of the background, but ultimately ends up providing us with the wrong information. As a result, these objects seem to really defy physics. It is one of the downsides of being human, an shortcoming of our brains that might have resulted, from an evolutionary point of view, because of our surroundings. We no longer really need to rely on our other senses for survival. We have grown so dependent our vision that other senses can contribute relatively little information in such situations. Consequently, we are misled into believing something else."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xs8hc,CPF_APPhysics,0,Thu Mar 5 04:39:02 2015 UTC,"Good thing I'm able to do this PoP, things would've went downhill if I forgot ._.  The first video was strange, but it made sense of it being an optical illusion. Wouldn't that make the landscape around it pretty steep as well? I mean if it was filmed at an angle to make it seem like the cars were rolling uphill then wouldn't that mean it's so step that it made the street seem downhill? Maybe I'm still a tad bit confused.  As for the second video, I wasn't a real big fan of it. It was really repetitive and really bland. As for the illusion itself, I could tell that it had to do with the rails expanding (you could clearly see it before) and you could see how it stayed mostly level and moved down slightly. The whole center of mass moving down thing wasn't really surprising either, not to mention the unnecessary amount of times he pointed it out.  The third video was actually pretty cool. It demonstrated a really long, thematic Rube Goldberg machine that even demonstrated tires rolling uphill, though in this case it may have been the momentum transfer that caused this. The only thing that was kinda disappointing was how clearly computer generated it was. It would've been incredible if they could do that in real life, but it sadly that doesn't seem the case here."
PhascinatingPhysics,2xs8hc,DJC_HPhysics_2,0,Wed Mar 4 03:20:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't really like the second video because of the way it deliberately tries to deceive you by not allowing you to see the cone roll from the correct angle to see what is actually going on.  Also, I didn't like the way the guy sort of explained the trick but never really went all that in-depth about it.  However, it is a pretty cool trick for what it's worth."

PhascinatingPhysics,2xmxzm,CMN_APPhysics,0,Mon Mar 2 04:46:56 2015 UTC,"That would be how far light travels in one second. So take the speed of light, which is about 2.998 x 108 m/s, and multiply it by the amount of time traveled. So if the moon is around 1.3 light seconds from Earth, it'd be the speed of light (2.998 x 108 m/s) multiplied by the time traveled (1.3 s) giving us around 3.897 x 108 meters or 389,700 km away. Now if you Google the distance from the moon to the Earth it's 384,400 km. Given the fact that we rounded in the beginning (and that the time value given wasn't exact either), we can say we're right.

So many diets are based on calories, but while people are paying so much attention to how high the number is on what they're eating, they seem to forget what it is that they're actually ingesting. Yes, that cupcake has 300+ calories just like that meal of fish and vegetables does, but it doesn't give you anything besides sugar and fat.

With all of these complications, I think it'd be a better idea to find a way to colonize the moon first since it's closer to home and we can run trials there without having much fear of failure due to distance.

However it seems that is the nature of art, as a medium becomes more popular, the easy it is to produce content on said medium.

These children were also less allergic to dust and ragweed. The hygiene hypothesis may b able to explain these variations.

I tried to do the 2nd equation over the first so I'd have sin/cos and I could use them for inverse tangent to find the angle but it's not working.

An important (to say the least) aspect of general relativity is the equivalence principle, which states that - similar to how velocity is indistinguishable from rest without the right reference frame - gravity and acceleration become indistinguishable under certain conditions. This means that gravitational mass is the same as inertial mass, which leads us to conclusions about everything from why black holes ""trap"" light to the motion of astronomical objects."

PhascinatingPhysics,2vxpc7,LRG_APPhysics,3,Sun Feb 15 02:44:46 2015 UTC,This article talks about how red lights are not only annoying but bad for you. It says that 25% of our exposure to bad particles from vehicle's running is received by us during the time we are stopped at red lights due to the way these particles are released at red lights compared to when we're driving. This is just as bad for drivers as for pedestrians in cross walks. There doesn't seem to be a solution for this but I thought it was an interesting article to share.

PhascinatingPhysics,2vxjt0,BRW_APPhysics,1 point,Sun Feb 15 16:49:48 2015 UTC,"Okay so there wasn't really a consensus on the moon formation, but it would not have been a planetary collision. The most likely (and general) answer is that the debris from which this planet was formed also formed other, smaller packages of debris that remained in orbit; these were attracted to one another while in orbit and conglomerated into one big satellite that we call a moon."
PhascinatingPhysics,2vxjt0,16JAS_WHSPhysics,1 point,Sun Feb 15 23:21:09 2015 UTC,"Well, since we have confirmed that the moon had the same chemical composition of the Earth it is highly likely that it is formed by the debris from a large impact upon the Earth. Probably early in its life due to the amount of rock released making the Earths life at this time probably before we even even had an atmosphere to speak of. And also the fact there's no visible scar on the Earth also supports this theory that the impact happened early in the Earth`s life."

PhascinatingPhysics,2vu7ei,AKL_WHSPhysics,0,Sun Feb 15 21:26:49 2015 UTC,I realy like this video because it's a very objective view of women's bodies over time.

It has to be less of what you look like and more of if you have a beautiful soul! Jesse Mccarthy's song is so true!

The former is the result of fat buildup in your breasts and buttocks. The latter is the result of a lack of fat in these parts of the body. One cannot naturally control where his/her fat goes... otherwise we'd all be the paradigm of beauty in today's world. This look is preposterous, as it is almost impossible to achieve it without some form of body modification (aka plastic surgery). The media is subliminally controlling our views and beliefs."

PhascinatingPhysics,2vhwv7,PhascinatingPhysics,3,Wed Feb 11 03:31:07 2015 UTC,"I feel like getting the Webassign's questions right is using additional items like Reddit and YouTube, utilities that we will not have during the test. So using them as a level of how we are doing with the subjects, in my opinion is not a true estimate of our understanding of the concepts. I feel like we haven't truly reviewed the problems with an understanding of the concepts. Thus rushing to get the test out before Feb. break, will directly affect our understanding of the concepts, which might not be up to the level that Webassign says. Perhaps if it was a group test?"
PhascinatingPhysics,2vhwv7,JMH_HPhysics_6,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:11:54 2015 UTC,"I think I understand what you are saying.    My response to that is that you are doing the homework in the wrong order.  From what you are describing, it seems as if you are doing the WebAssign first.  While attempting the homework, you then look up answers, and ask questions, and search Google and YouTube.  Then you feel you didn't learn anything because you don't have a way to measure what you just learned because you just did the thing that was supposed to measure that.  What you should be doing is the worksheets and ""class notes"" that I sent out first.  Watch the YouTube videos then.  Google search then.  Hack through those sample problems.  Check your answers with the solutions I posted online.  Ask questions then.  Ask for clarification or additional resources then.  Then do the WebAssign homework.  The homework should be like a little mini-quiz that assesses whether or not you understand all those concepts and ideas that you hacked through first.  Then do the practice test.  Then go look at the answers and see how you did.  See what you missed.  Ask more questions.  Go back again.  And review and re-do the problems you got wrong.  So much of what you said feels like you want to skip to the end, to the spot where you know everything, but you haven't done the work to get there yet.  Of course the homework is confusing if you haven't thought about any of the concepts or tried to understand it before starting the assignment.  There is so much more that I have given you to do than just the WebAssign that I feel that if you really did all the work, the WebAssign shouldn't be that far of a reach.  [EDIT] For instance as of right this instant, the solutions I posted for the ""Gravity & Orbits* worksheet I sent out on Sunday night only has 28 views.  28.  That means that not only has only half the class looked at it once, I would guess the number is even less than that.   So over half the class hasn't even looked at the solutions to the work that I posted, to be completed before the homework.  No wonder the homework is causing some issues."
PhascinatingPhysics,2vhwv7,kam_WHSphysics,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:22:01 2015 UTC,"I can't do the woksheet problems because I don't even know where to begin... and then you post solutions for things and it's too hard to follow your work because I don't know why or how you did steps, I need someone in person explaining it so I can understand. I know I am not the only one who feels this way, it seems that everyone does."
PhascinatingPhysics,2vhwv7,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Wed Feb 11 14:40:29 2015 UTC,"Well, where to begin is hopefully easier than you think.  Start with F=ma.  Every circular motion problem should start here, including questions about gravity and things orbits in a circular orbit.  If something has an elliptical orbit, don't use F=ma because the force causing the object to orbit will change as a function of the distance.  This makes the math outside of what you need to be able to do for Physics 1.  Instead, use the conservation of energy, where U + K = constant.  So if you have established that there is a circular motion happening, start with F=ma.  Then...   Draw a FBD for the object that is orbiting.  Because the objects are all going in uniform circular motion, there will always be a net force acting towards the center of the circle.  This will either be tension, or friction, or a normal force, or gravity or some other force pulling or pushing the object in a circle. Now that you know which forces are acting on the object, you can add them up to find the net For stuff in space, that's easy, because there is only one force to add: gravity.   Set that net force equal to ma.  But you know a is a centripetal acceleration (because of the uniform circular motion the only acceleration is the acceleration towards the circle's center).  Centripetal acceleration is v2 /r   You should then look at the equation for gravity, and the relationship between v and ω if the question asks about time, because the other variables are independent of time.   The rest is algebra and plugging in numbers.  Numbers for masses and sizes of planets and their orbits is stuff I looked up in the back of the book, and would always be given (if needed) on a test.  You are not expected to know the mass of Earth/moon/Sun and their sizes and orbital distances by memory.  And while the algebra isn't a trivial step, it isn't all that advanced either and is well within the scope of math you should be able to do. It is also important to remember that when plugging in numbers, make sure your units agree with each other.  The value for G depends on kilograms, meters, and seconds,  so any numbers you plug in or get out of your equations need to be in terms of those units."

I got an answer from my research, but I feel like I would not be ready for such a problem on a test. How would you recommend going about answering such a problem?   For reference, here is the question: ""During an Apollo lunar landing mission, the command module continued to orbit the Moon at an altitude of about 90 km. How long did it take to go around the Moon once?"""
PhascinatingPhysics,2vhwv7,KEW_APPhysicsC,1 point,Wed Feb 11 04:50:48 2015 UTC,"Did you look at This?  Because this question is essentially like the question here...  F=ma  F = Force of gravity  m = mass of Apollo CM  a = centripetal acceleration = v2 /r  if you find v, you can find angular speed.  If you find that, you can find the time to go around once.

Is it because there's no atmosphere? Because otherwise I don't understand because that would mean 2 objects should fall at the same right on the moon and Earth but clearly they dont. And for 4 I agree that the higher speed needs a greater net force. I also agree that Fg is constant so therefore shouldn't the new FN increase to balance?"
PhascinatingPhysics,2vfs4c,KSF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue Feb 10 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"For number 3: The objects fall at the same rate and is independent of the object's mass, not the planet's mass.  The planet exerts a force on each of the objects, but that force is greater on the bigger object.  So a bigger object, while having more inertia and is harder to accelerate, is pulled downwards by a proportionally bigger force.  This means that both objects accelerate at the same rate when on the same planet. For number 4: The higher speed needs a higher centripetal force to keep moving in a circle, which is the net force.  So...  - Fg + Fn = ma.  To make the net force bigger, Fn must get smaller, not bigger, as Fg is constant."
PhascinatingPhysics,2vfs4c,JTB_WHS,1 point,Tue Feb 10 21:07:29 2015 UTC,Can you also give a more clear explanation for the 1st frq. Its difficult to follow your work
PhascinatingPhysics,2vfs4c,JTB_WHS,1 point,Wed Feb 11 00:52:09 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a shot:  There are two masses, acting together in a system.  The first mass is connected to a string that makes it move in a circle at a constant speed while on a horizontal surface without friction.  The second mass is hanging freely on the same string.    If you look at the hanging mass, the tension in the string must be equal to the weight of the hanging mass.    If you look at the mass on the table, there are three forces.  The normal and weight you don't have to worry about - it's on a horizontal surface so they are balanced.  The only other force is then tension, which is a centripetal force (it makes the mass move in a circle).  Then you can set that tension acting on the table mass equal to table mass x centripetal acceleration.    Remember that the tension is equal to the weight of the hanging mass?  Plug that in, and plug v2 /r for centripetal acceleration.  Then...  algebra.  This is a little tricky because ultimately the question asks for period  which is hidden behind a few variables.  Namely, the linear velocity.  So...  v=rω and ω=θ/t, and boom! there's your period.  Set θ = 2π for one revolution and t is the time for one revolution, or ""P"".  I did the algebra out for you above, and you get the expression they wanted you to.  For the graph, you want to get a straight line.  So the easiest thing to do is graph P2 and 1/hanging mass.  Then the slope of that line will be a big nasty thing that is essentially a bunch of constants.  Initially, I thought about graphing P and 1/sqrt(m), but I figured that was grosser than it needed to be, which is why I went back to P2 and 1/m    So if you calculate those versions of P and m and graph it, you should get a graph that's a straight line.  It's not perfect because it's supposed to represent experimental data, but it's pretty darn close.  Then draw a best-fit line, and find the slope.  I got a slope of 0.0403.  Then you can set that slope equal to that nasty set of constants.  Do some more algebra to solve for g, which is ""unknown"" or at least the objective of the experiment.  When I got my slope, I got a value of g = 9.4 m/s2  Your slope might be a little different, depending on your exact best-fit line that you drew.  Hope that helps."

I didn't double check your answer for acceleration, but if it's right, the tension should also increase, no?

PhascinatingPhysics,2vb3ib,leofu,2,Wed Feb 11 13:44:54 2015 UTC,"Ah, yes, I forgot to respond to that question. I haven't done any thorough research on the topic, but I'll give it a shot:  Hardness  Note: H/B = Hardness/Blackness; 10H = extremely hard, 10B = extremely soft, HB = middle   Unlike the balls in pens, the weight of your writing style can break the tip due to the brittleness of the graphite. So, if you're a heavy-handed writer, you'll need to compensate by using lead that is a higher level H. The fastest writing can be done with B lead, as its softer, and requires less friction and pressure to write. However, like fountain pens, these are more expensive (they cost more and they don't last as long) and require greater skill to handle.    Quality   For non-mechanical pencils and lead: Buy quality pencils/lead, because cheap ones use low-grade graphite that break easily or already have fractures/breaks. For mechanical pencils, get a rotating lead model, like this: http://www.amazon.com/uni-ball-KuruToga-Mechanical-Starter-1751934/dp/B0026ICM1E/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1423665601&sr=8-1&keywords=rotating+lead+pencil   Diameter   If you're not a heavy-handed writer, consider switching to a 0.3 mm lead pencil. The finer tip requires less friction to write and allows for more detailed writing (e.g. writing tall and skinny).   In summary: Try a higher B lead with a 0.5mm rotating mechanical pencil. Work your way up the B scale, as your writing style adapts. Another route is to switch to a 0.3mm pencil. Invest in quality lead and pencils.  Note: My knowledge of this comes from being of Japanese-descent, and having architect and artist friends. Artists use #B lead for sketching and architects use 0.3mm for drafting. Japanese people are the masters of stationary. I realized how much I know about this topic just now, while writing this comment."

Something really weird the article mentions is how a man's level of hunger will affect what type of women he finds attractive.

I'm also not sure where you got that Krot = K.  That's not a good general rule to set those two equations equal to each other.  For instance, imagine a block sliding on the floor.  Is it's kinetic energy equal to its rotational kinetic energy?  If the equation doesn't work once, it can't be used all the time.  So be careful; that looks very much like a special-case scenario."

Nintendo took the anaglyph method and updated it, using a ""parallax barrier"" instead of red and blue pixel coding. The images are still on the left and right, but they ""occupy alternating vertical columns of pixels"" which are then filtered through the barrier. You can even see the images merge when you move the slider, as they move slightly together or apart when you switch it on or off. Pretty cool method, but no lasers are involved and the image isn't quite split like Nintendo has done. It's a different approach to the 3D effect, so it kind of makes sense that they didn't mention it as it's really just a derivation of the 1800s anaglyph method.  Source: abouttech.com"

Eventually you end up with a build up of photons, so that when you open a channel for them to exist through, they pour out in a single stream.   Mr. P, if I'm off on any of this correct me, I was just doing my best to interpret the video :)"

NOw, this video did leave me with a question. How is it that lasers have different intensities? A laser pointer can't really go through walls but other lasers can. Is it because of a higher density of photons, or maybe because those photons are more exited therefore having more energy?"

They set up a device that drops the toast the same way and from the same height every time to avoid sources of error. However, they dropped the toast from the roof of a 2-3 story building, very different from the height of, say, a table you'd eat breakfast off of. They concluded that the only reason the butter affected the toast was because it made the toast more concave, like a leaf or a parachute. This only happened when the butter was pushed into the toast with more pressure, and caused the toast to land butter-side-up more often.  But as we know from resistive forces, the force of drag from the air would have a much greater effect from a higher starting point, so it might not make a noticeable difference from table-height.  In conclusion, consider using some elbow grease the next time you butter your toast. It might just save your life (breakfast)."

Eero is a company that has aimed to fix this problem, by creating a sort of all in one wifi ""box"",your own network,  that they claim works much better.

So that's 200 on top of an average of 300 dollars a year for poor service and speed. Like the company is making a solution to a problem, but for 200 dollars it seems too much. Its like paying for gas and then having to pay to get into a state (cough..tolls...cough), Buying a DVD and having to pay for an extender to play it on a DVD player somewhere else in your house.

It's not their fault that your router is not strong enough. If you use a strong router, you'll probably have great internet connectivity throught your house. But good routers are also very expensive. Eero is designed to act as a router by itself and as a network when combined with a couple of more Eeros. So, it's like having multiple routers within your house, or a single very strong router.

Net force is also equal to ma.  a = centripetal acceleration.  So the normal force is equal to mv2 /r  The velocity is the velocity at which the normal force is big enough to make the force of friction equal to the weight.  i.e. μN = mg...  Notice here that you'll μmv2 /r = mg...  so mass cancels, and then...  math happens."

The information that I didn't know was the bubbles formed and these bubbles take time to ""air out"" which is why you can't pop a joint immediately after popping it."

The reason why this happens is because your joints have cartilage and synovial fluid, produced by the synovial membrane, between them. When you crack your joints, the synovial membrane stretches, causing there to be less room between the bones, thus lowering the pressure. As a result, the lowered pressure between the bones creates a bubble, and the pop you hear is the sound of the bubble forming."

This new keyboard is a self-cleaning, self-powered, smart keyboard. This keyboard is meant to make a password more secure by keeping track on how you type your password. This adds another layer of security for any accounts you make. For example if someone gets your password and tries logging in on a smart keyboard, the keyboard would recognize the difference in typing speed and the strength of keystrokes (how hard you press down on keys) and block the log in attempt."

The way people type varies person to person but also time to time. A tired person is likely to type slower. Depending on aggression or emotional level your keystrokes will change slower or faster and then how hard you push down on the keys also changes.   And while this would stop a hacker at a physical location to some degree, it wouldn't help as most hackers don't walk up to a computer to break in they do it remotely using vultabilities in networks and security.

Those reasons alone render this device ineffective but if you were to place it in a business senario where multiple people may need access to the computer over the course of the day each having their own unique typing style and possibly suffering emotional reactions or being tired.

You have to keep in mind that we are in high school, particularly studying this type of stuff, and are a part of a STEM-related subreddit. Of course we are going to know more about science then most of the general public. Do I think we should take steps to improve this? Yes, of course, but that would take a lot of uprooting in our country's educational system that I don't think we could afford right now.

The majority of Americans are statistically inevitable to have learned about DNA in some point in their lives. This result is probably part of a trick: people who do not use this knowledge daily are presented with the acronym in a setting where they are expecting big chemical names that they know nothing about, and subsequently assume that the DNA they are faced with is an added food chemical. If presented in a non-tricky context, they probably would've made the mark closer. I sincerely doubt the viability of this statistic."

The author is right about us forgetting about how horible rabies could be though. My favourite part was the paragraph explaining how the virus makes the host ""hydrophobic"" and disbaling the swallow relex, that part was cool~  (I though rabies only made you have white foam come from your nouth?? is that not a symptom of rabies? o.o)"
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv5ux,AR_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"According to one professor, it's ok to eat snow because it's just as clean as any drinking water. Although snow may cling to dust, we breathe in the same dust, so it's not harmful to us. However, once it hits the ground it may not be safe to eat. Once it hits the ground you should stay away from brown, yellow, and watermelon (red algae) snow."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv61k,AR_WHSPhysics,2,Tue Jan 27 18:21:34 2015 UTC,"It might be very interesting to note Bill Bye is a Seahawks fan... Sports Science also disproved how deflating the ball would make much, if any difference."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv61k,RP_APPhysics_6,1 point,Tue Jan 27 18:29:24 2015 UTC,I agree with that. Especially because deflating them would serve as an advantage to both teams so the colts wouldn't be at a disadvantage. Maybe that could be an issue if Brady got the single game passing record or something but that wasn't the case
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv61k,LRG_APPhysics,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"I agree with your first point. Whether they were intentionally deflated or not, it makes sense that it would only help both teams so it shouldn't matter. Also, it does make sense that the only way that they could actually deflate the balls would be with actually manually changing the air pressure. Although Belichick claims that it could be from them rubbing the leather, Nye's statement makes much more sense."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv61k,PhascinatingPhysics,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:47:22 2015 UTC,"I certainly haven't heard any evidence that the Colt's balls were also tested.  I still wonder if simple temperature difference between inside (where the balls were inflated) and outside (where it was colder and the balls sat before being used) was enough to account for the pressure difference.  I have seen some stuff, and it appears it might be."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv61k,AST_WHSPhysics,1 point,Wed Jan 28 20:10:44 2015 UTC,I agree. I don't think there is any right answer at this point but I think its unfair to just automatically rule out weather as a possibility for the low pressure in the balls. Only time will tell how this is going to end  I'm just looking forward to the super bowl. I don't care about deflategate I just want Russell Wilson to go down!
PhascinatingPhysics,2tv61k,SKS_APPhysics_6,1 point,Thu Jan 29 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"According to Bill Belichick, the reason why the footballs got deflated was because the players rubbed them during pregame to break in the leather. He thinks this would cause them to decrease in pressure, but according to Bill Nye, this is false. He believes that the only way to alter the pressure is to do it manually."

Obviously having the children read to by a robot would be better than if nobody was able to read to the children at all but I just don't think it would be good if the other option wasn't available.

Okay, but wouldn't this stress physically tear the proteins apart? After all, if it's able to separate clumps of proteins, then it could technically also separate the amino acids within the protein... which is bad..."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tsbc3,DDI_APPhysicsC,1 point,Tue Jan 27 20:36:20 2015 UTC,"If it is separating clumps of proteins, then it is most likely effecting the tertiary or quaternary structure of the protein, the same structures effected when you denature a protein.

During denaturation, these structures are lost (as you kind of mentioned above...?), which means that the protein's chemical properties are changed.   Still does not answer my question though; I was curious to know if the machine that tears the clumps of proteins packed together could also tear the individual proteins into single amino acids, which would essentially disintegrate the protein."

The ability to quickly and cheaply re-form common proteins from yeast or E. coli bacteria could potentially streamline protein manufacturing and make cancer treatments more affordable.""  You're basically reusing proteins, which is a lot cheaper than making proteins in hamster ovaries every single time they are needed for treatments. It's analogous to filling up your shampoo bottle after your shampoo has run out. You still get soapy water, which could be used with nearly the same efficiency as the original shampoo. Only in this case, the reused proteins are just like the ones before."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tryzn,PhascinatingPhysics,2,Mon Jan 26 23:21:12 2015 UTC,"I think that this problem stems from 2 major reasons: first one is the fact that many people are simply apathetic to the science world or find it to be too boring/nerdy/complex and thus decide to pay very little attention to it. Second reason is that a lot of the experiments or research that are talked about on the news are conducted by specialized individuals. In other words, a name will be associated with a science discovery and then forgotten by the general population as new individuals emerge with new ""things"". Very few people (Stephen Hawking, for example) are in the center of attention every day."

I don't know how somebody could not know at least one living scientist. I agree with Osmologist (I'm not sure what your real name is), people focus more on the ""things"" that are discovered, and the scientists become ""that guy"" who invented the (insert discovery here). If somebody said, ""Do you know a living athlete?"" (or singer, or actor), people would think it was obvious that they know one, and it makes me wonder why the same does not apply to science."
PhascinatingPhysics,2tryzn,ECF_WHSPhysics,1 point,Tue Jan 27 19:50:51 2015 UTC,"I think that the reason for this is because people only care if the scientist truly does something that is revolutionary or never- before- done. Obviously when science was first being born, there were many scientists that we all know by heart because they were the first of their kind. Nowadays, scientists are working hard to try to make new discoveries and improve things using science but it is harder. Ultimately, scientists today are working just as hard and are just as smart, maybe even smarter than those first scientists but nobody knows their names because they may not have completed their own project just yet or simply because they aren't the first. Media should focus on scientists just as much as they focus on musical artists or actors in televised award events."

Aside from a helpful example, I like how he used simple analogies to make the video more interesting and understandable. I had always just been told that our sky was blue because of the way the light reflects off the gases in the atmosphere. I'm glad I understand it more fully now."

With his fortune made by age 30, he decided to create SpaceX, a privately owned company with the ultimate goal of getting people to Mars. His goal is to allow humans to become a multiplanet  species. With a few run ins with NASA and the Air Force, he has turned SpaceX to a very bright future. He plans to bring people to Mars in the next 10 to 15 years, already having proposed a plan for colony on the red planet."
