lotro,3e6tjm,Louey7,1 point,Wed Jul 22 13:50:27 2015 UTC,"Ironically Firefoot is pretty active, especially lately, but by no means crowded, laggy, and fortunately pleasant crowd.  If you want to return and your old kin isn't active, feel free to message me.  Ours has been on Firefoot years, and we have had a fair number return recently.  Depending on class, the changes may not be that significant, although rerolling is fun too."

lotro,3e6tjm,RJFerret,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:12:33 2015 UTC,"There are guides in the class sections of the forums, but the significant change was adding trait trees for skills instead of automatically getting them all from trainers.  Bards for retraiting are obsolete.  The colors and class roles of traits still apply and there are better descriptions now.  So log in, it'll say ""specialization needed"", open your traits, you'll pick blue, red or yellow as before, then select the skills you want in that line.  Place them on your skill bars where you want then LOCK your bars!  Now you can pick an alternate setup if you desire without your skills wandering around when you switch."

I logged in to my capt and I don't remember at all how he was traited, and now I have to figure out what the best tree to trait is.  Someone needs to create a website/wicky where you can input around when you stopped playing, and it will just list all the major changes from then until now."

How long were you in active for? If the above is the case there isn’t much Turbine is going to be able to do I don’t think. Maybe contact your old kin mates in game see if someone is still leading it?

lotro,3dzn8m,Pixharm,3,Mon Jul 20 20:45:07 2015 UTC,Everything is ezmode to tank now. They gave even my beloved Warden a one-button force taunt. :/ Took a very long break from the game myself to get over that.  Just hoping the Gondor instances (when my newly returned kin gets there) will be at least somewhat challenging.
lotro,3dzn8m,jf9,2,Mon Jul 20 22:14:11 2015 UTC,But the warden force taunt isn't useful because it's a forced taunt... useful because it can bring mits to 90% for 12 seconds
lotro,3dzn8m,ObsessedWithHobbits,4,Mon Jul 20 23:01:01 2015 UTC,"Aye, my issue was more with the direction they took with tanking and the threat system so as to even put in a force taunt. Nowadays all we have to do to keep aggro is simply be traited a certain way. It's just about mits and dps.  Gone are the mechanics that made Lotro tanking so unique. Wardens especially. Used to be an intricate proactive tank that used to be a challenge and pleasure to play. Threat juggling, aggro leeching, morale surfing to keep blue, etc. Had to fight tooth and nail.  Most groups would be wary of even taking you on as a pug tank as it was a practised skill that'd often go horribly wrong.  Now both guard and waden are the same homogenous wow-style reactive tank. All in the name of accessibility. Call me a bitter vet but it is a bit of a joke.  Edit: Don't get me wrong I still love the game, but mostly for nostalgia rather than any sort of challenge."
lotro,3dzn8m,jf9,3,Tue Jul 21 00:20:06 2015 UTC,"I was just starting to learn the old system towards the end of Isengard. Was running the new (at the time) 3 and 6 mans attempting to not cause complete fails.

I haven't done it in years, I refuse.  Thadur is one of my favs, as the group has to work together and pay attention.  Players screw themselves if they don't listen.  I wish there was a t2 so cc would be useful like when this was run in our 20s to get that precious Barrows armour.  I agree about Fear wing of OD, but it balances out Wound, remember they were designed together.  Similarly the other two have a longer then shorter bit.  Turtle is useless IMO.  One of the RT MOBs in Angmar was more compelling, one shotting squishies if they didn't move at the right time.  The newer lair raid is ok, obviously was intended to have trash mobs leading up to it, which would have been better, at least there are mechanics to respond to and the adds are tricky (if you choose them).  I prefer the original versions of Swordhall and Lost Temple.  The former could be done by any classes rather than just aoe; the later was more than just a dps race.

Red is best for DPS, damages stacks and when you get that volcanic runestone, it makes life a lot easier. I really only use lightening (yellow) for deeding in lower-level areas, so I can kill on the fly. Blue is for healing, obvs.  My advice is to possibly get a stone of the tortoise (xp disabler) and spend some time playing around with the trait trees to see what fits you best. For healing, you could try posting in world chat for a partner to run around with or try some skirms. If you are on Landy, PM me and I can help :)"

lotro,3d7051,Zaraia,2,Tue Jul 14 16:55:15 2015 UTC,"In red you can do more damage but you can't kite as well. In yellow you're a lot more mobile but your damage output suffers very slightly. And blue for healing, of course.  Overall though, at 21 the best thing to do is read the tooltips for your skills and the traits and just dumping points down the line you choose. My rk is mid-20s. Since I plan on primarily healing on my mini and doing dps on my rk, I'm switching between fire and lighting every level to get the feel for both until I decide which dps line I want to specialize in."
lotro,3d7051,Arathaert,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:37:36 2015 UTC,"A bit long but here you go, after the first paragraph I explain how to actually use one.  Go yellow line (mostly single target, no induction) and learn to kite/backpedal. For most landscape mobs you don't even need to do that, and can safely use red line (AoE, induction based) if you wish, but red line honestly doesn't get fun until you get 20 trait points. At 21 you won't have 20 trait points.  Anyway the way Rune-keepers work is that you have an attunement bar, with 3 types of attunement. Battle Attunement, which is gained from using most of your damaging skills, Neutral attunement, which is your base state outside of combat, and healing attunement, which you obtain from using most heals.  As you gain higher levels of attunement you will either deal more damage or heal better. Your attunement resets to neutral after each combat event, usually a few seconds after you're no longer in combat. The amount of attunement each skill gives is listed on the tooltip when you hover over the skill icon.   An example of how it works is something like this: Start the engagement with Fiery Ridicule, and gain one Battle attunement. Next, use Distracting Flame for another 3 Battle attunement, for a total of 4. Next, use Prelude to Hope. Since it is a skill that gives healing attunement, it will subtract 1 Battle attunement for a total of 3 battle attunement. It also works the other way, where having 4 healing attunement and then using a skill that gives 1 battle attunement will subtract 1 healing attunement. There are also skills that require at least 1 attunement in either end of the spectrum that reset you to neutral attunement."

lotro,3d6xzh,_greymaster,9,Tue Jul 14 00:22:38 2015 UTC,"Do they serve subtly different roles in a group?    Not even about subtlety here, they are pretty different. A guard can fill an off-DPS role in a group, sure; and a champ can be a decent off-tank (even in an emergency, a first tank!), sure. But they are definitely different play styles. One still focuses on taking/soaking damage, and the other is about dishing it out.   Is one more offensive than defensive?    Now that the trait tree system exists, they can sort of both be pushed to the limits of their given role. Champions can crank through either the red or yellow line to dole out a LOT of damage, quickly, and to many enemies. Guardians are all about mitigations and soaking up damage, fully defensive. True, you have the ability to play them in the opposite way of their purpose (Champ's blue line and Guard's red line), but you're asking if either class is primarily defensive or offensive.    Does one ""go better"" with particular weapons?    This one is much more straight forward now that champs cannot use heavy shields anymore. I like running heavy shield on my guard, with a sword or spear as a main-hand weapon. Champs can use pretty much anything, but I see a lot of folks with two-hander swords lately. My own champ is dual-wield, but that is more up to personal preference than what ""works"" better for the class.    Does one employ different tactics between the two classes?    Here's the trickier answer: Yes, but only to a point. I have a champion on one server who is all built for blue line: mitigations, oh-shit skills, and lots of parry chance to trigger the Riposte attack. Can she be an off-tank? Certainly. Would I rather her just be a super beefy off-DPS role instead? Oh yeah. Same goes for guardian. I think unless you're completely solo (no kin or anything) or killing stuff in the 'Moors, you should probably be working the soak angle with your guardian. It'll take longer to kill stuff, but the class is designed to take damage.    How do they ""feel"" different?    Another easy one. I think when people see that both use a bow and wear heavy armor, it's easy to think they are pretty similar. In reality, they are pretty different. Champs have to keep track of fervour, and use it to crank up their DPS when the time calls for it. Guards don't have to worry about anything other than how much aggro they're keeping. As I mentioned above, one class is designed to take damage, and the other is designed to dish it out. Hope this helps! :)"
lotro,3d6xzh,msbq,3,Tue Jul 14 01:58:05 2015 UTC,"Wow, very detailed. Thanks, that really did clear a lot up."
lotro,3d6xzh,serow081reddit,5,Tue Jul 14 04:00:37 2015 UTC,"Do they serve subtly different roles in a group?   Both can tank/dps, but in terms of perception, Guardians are the tank while Champions are dps who can tank.    Is one more offensive than defensive?   Champions are seen as the offensive option.   Does one ""go better"" with particular weapons?   Guardians: 2hander for damage, sword&shield for tanking. Not much option here. You can use sword&shield for damage... but you'll probably fall asleep. Champions: 2hander, dualwield.   How do they ""feel"" different?   Guardians have a lot of random procs due to their parry/block mechanics. Champions feel slightly more methodical, using a build-spend-build-spend combo point system."
lotro,3d6xzh,jester17,3,Tue Jul 14 02:04:51 2015 UTC,"To add to what serow said, Guards are very reactive.  They can only really do damage when taking it.  When doing DPS in a group, they have an ability that is meant to be used on the main tank, and lets you get responses from their blocks and parries.  Champs are all about hitting everything as fast and hard as you can until it's dead.  They can do massive crits against one target in one trait tree, or high damage to a very large number of targets in the other damage tree.  Honestly, I like both.  i have a guard at 95 and a champ at 100.  The biggest deciding factor for me was the fact that I wanted to dish out damage in a group, so I went with a champ.  When you play as a guard, most people just sort of expect you to tank, and don't take you seriously if you want to do DPS.  Tanking is hard when you are doing instances for the first time, because you need an idea of how the fight will play out.  You will often get advice if you let people know it's your first time doing an instance, however."
lotro,3d6xzh,Pixharm,0,Tue Jul 14 09:16:18 2015 UTC,I main for guard but took a long break because with trait trees tanking became boring with spamming force attack taunts and being able to tank with casual healing. Is this still the case?

lotro,3d6xzh,RJFerret,3,Tue Jul 14 04:01:59 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late here, but wanted to add my two cents: Guards have a lot of skills designed to draw and hold aggro, and Champs don't, so in larger groups, they serve totally different purposes IMO. Completely ignoring other classes for the purpose of this comparison, Guards hold aggro and soak up damage, while champs dps everything to death.  When it comes to solo play, they have a lot more in common. I personally solo my Champ in yellow with two weapons, and my guard in red with a 2-handed weapon (no shield.)"
lotro,3d6xzh,Arathaert,2,Tue Jul 14 07:00:04 2015 UTC,"You've had a couple good answers, I'd point out that a guardian is a reactive class.  That suits my brain best.  Champs need to build fervor, totally different mentality.  Guards, sword and board survivability, champs dual wield (ok, both can two hand).  Champs are categorized with burgs and hunters as dps.  Guards are categorized with wardens and captains as tanks.  If you want to be a blender, go champ.  If you want to charge in first and survive being pounded on, go guard."
lotro,3d6xzh,diggergoodsong,2,Tue Jul 14 06:02:55 2015 UTC,"These are all great responses, and the difference is pretty clear between the classes: Guardians are primarily tanks (best in the game right now), Champs are primarily dps.   But I'd like to add something from a guardian perspective...  People often tend to underestimate Guardian dps capability. Granted, it's not to the same degree as a well-geared champ, but a well-geared, well-played Guardian can put out respectable single-target damage and very good AoE damage. You can expect 3000-5000 dps single target and upwards of 16000 dps AoE. Not elite warden or rk or champ numbers, of course, but it's more than most folks think. And it's enough to tank in some situations - I've tanked a few easier things in red line, just to see if I could, and things stuck to me pretty well (adds from bleeds spreading around, the main dps target through dps + a taunt when needed).  Guardian can be what you make of it - if you wanna build like an absolute fortress and just soak up the damage and sorta smack things on the face with your shield to keep 'em mad at you, go for it. If you wanna wade through dozens of mobs soloing fellowship and raid instances with relative ease, go for it. If you wanna go full ""glass cannon"" and get yourself 80k phys mastery (very much possible), go for it.  Guardians are mainly defensive in their group roles, yes. But they certainly can dish out the damage ... even more than ""off-DPS"" if you've got a good, well-geared one.  EDIT: Note about ""soak"" building - yes, Guardians in tank mode are designed to soak up damage. A Guardian in red line is designed to not just soak up damage but also out-heal it. I can do things in red line with a ""glassy"" build and 22k morale that a Guard friend of mine has trouble with in a tankier 30k morale build (she normally tanks t2 stuff). It's all how you build the class :)"
lotro,3d6xzh,Soarel2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:36:38 2015 UTC,"Just a side note on the difference from a healers perspective -- champs need a lot more attention from my mini if they are tanking or  off-tanking while the guardian only needs help when in deep combat or pulls several mobs.  For my mini, the guardian is the preferred tank and the champ needs to focus on taking out mobs with the hunters."
lotro,3d6xzh,oscarboom,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:40:33 2015 UTC,"Guardians are tanks, plain and simple. They are the most pure tank class. There's still variation--you can play a traditional sword and board damage absorption tank, or you can play a more aggressive, aggro oriented tank with a two-handed weapon. DPS guards aren't really a thing except in solo, and solo LOTRO is boring (aside from leveling ofc)  Champions on the other hand are an AoE DPS class which focuses on either dual-wielding or 2h weapons (your choice--it doesn't really matter). You can also do single target DPS with them, which is just as effective. Champions used to make good tanks but the tank champion line was nerfed to hell after the trait trees were added.  They feel different, serve different roles, and are more offensive or defensive because the guard is a tank and the champion is a DPS.  Hunters, Guardians, Minstrels, and Champions all pretty much have a set role in the MMO holy trinity. Burglars, Runekeepers, Loremasters, Captains, Wardens, and Beornings are more open with two (or three in the case of captains and loremasters) class paths they can go on and roles they can serve."

Once that is set, you can fill in holes with essences.  Handy also is the gold essence slot ring from Pelargir, which has more vit. than the teal.  With a few of those, you can have one set with morale, one phys. mastery for dps races, another w/mits or crit. defense depending what you are running and swap between rather than use essence reclamation scrolls all the time.  Got the cloak from Glinghant?  Offhand sword from Io's Peak iirc?  Using swords for the extra parry percentage?

I would not boost a burglar to 50, as their fun is sneaking around, getting into bosses without fighting an entire camp, and most of that happens at lower levels.  At higher levels (post Mirkwood) quests are designed to overlap so you need to kill things while going after the boss simultaneously.  Hunters are boring, so I could totally see jumping one of them to 50.  Minstrels are worth learning healing and survival skills through the fun levels so I probably wouldn't accelerate one of them either, but they would be my second choice behind hunter.  If you don't have Isengard, get that though, Rohan too, so double check ownership of those expansions first."

Some of these are tough to get in early levels, so I slot easier to get virtues early on, (and I'm at level 53, so they are still slotted): empathy, wisdom, and charity are the ones I use early on (wisdom and empathy are great for a mini, for will and fate respectively).  I generally avoid anything with a ""non-combat-regen"" bonus.  Since my play style is largely solo, survivability tends to be my goal."

lotro,3cm2t5,DYMongoose,5,Thu Jul 9 03:59:06 2015 UTC,"This is at least one source: Summer (May) Producer's Letter   New Servers and Datacenters: We spoke about this Turbine wide upgrade at the beginning of the year and had expected to have it done by now, but weather and other obstacles set us back. We finally have some progress and we can safely say that by the end of September of 2015 we should have the servers moved to our new datacenters with upgraded hardware and Operating Systems. The US servers will operate from our new datacenter in New Jersey while our EU servers will move back to Europe and reside in our new datacenter in Amsterdam.  Transfer Systems and Server Merge: To support the move to the upgraded server hardware we will be implementing an improved server transfer service that will run from the game launcher rather than a website. Once implemented, server transfers can be account or character based so that all your account level items including marks, Mithril coins, etc. can be transferred. We are also adding functionality that will allow Kin leaders to disband their Kin on one world and then recreate it on another maintaining status and achievements earned by that Kin over its lifetime. More details and breakdowns on all of this to coming in the next few weeks as we move into final phases of development and testing.  You will have 3 months past the date of the launch of the new service in which to continue playing on the smaller worlds while planning and or making your move to a larger server. After that point your characters will always be available to be transferred to one of the remaining worlds, however you will only be able to log in to the remaining servers. More details on all of this as well as detailed instructions on how to move will be provided in email, in-game mail as well as website and forums in the months to come.   From the post"

They are moving to different data centers, NJ and one in Europe again.  They are working on maintaining kin integrity.  There will be a three month leeway after the opening of the free transfer when you can play on old servers that will be closed.  Then you won't have a choice but have to select an active server.  It will be horrible.  None of our kin is looking forward to it.

Lotro isn't dead, it will never be (ok, in the next few years). There is a large community of VIP's and people with paid content, that play everyday. Also if there are 100 people playing on a server, 50 will be raiding, on instances or skirms, 25 will be at the starting areas, 15 will be in Gondor, and another 10 will be spread across the different regions questing or deeding.  Let me give you a good example: the other day I was questing in Moria with a friend in Arkenstone (low population), I needed to do an instance, called for it in /world, and quickly 4 more guys in the same level joined (not 100's). Keep playing, if you ever need help or want to play with others, you will never run out of people."

I restarted on Brandywine and can say the /world chat is pretty populated, but still feels like it's only 30 or so people. However, going into Bree, there are shit loads of people and the server has to use different Layers to compensate for it. I see people LFF in /world and they have a full group within minutes, so the population is there, just all spread out across the map. Take EVE for example, it's completely dead but you know that somewhere in space is a huge colony of people and in another part is a massive battle going on. Numbers weren't as they were but the population is still there."

It's not for everyone's taste of course, but good friendly people willing to help not to mention have a good time.  The world is large enough where I can travel a whole region (lower level) without running into anyone though at rare times come across another lone traveler here and there.  For myself, this is how it should be.  A journey by foot from Bree to Rivendale is NOT something that I except a small army of hobbits and dwarfs slaughtering trolls and orcs the entire way.  Passing lonely travelers or small groups going from here to there is great and offers great fun to rescue someone completely unexpectedly out of nowhere... or at least ""I am Waaddd"" it up and die in the attempt for a good lol.  I see regular groups being formed all the time with even requests for lowbie content being filled to help a fellow hobbit or even one of those man-things out.  Just be sure WC is fun here, so if the sight of a Hobbit eating Cake > Pie in the shire offends you... at the very least turn WC off the moment you step in.  Good Hunting"

lotro,3ckr4u,csgoaccountjh,3,Wed Jul 8 17:55:59 2015 UTC,If you can hold off until later this fall you may be able to get a free transfer when the server merges take place. If you're on a low population server you may be offered a token to transfer to a higher population server.
lotro,3ckr4u,ceeller,2,Wed Jul 8 18:55:10 2015 UTC,Is this confirmed? Also can you maybe link me to the statement? That would be awesome.

lotro,3ckr4u,majorlagg1,2,Thu Jul 9 08:25:45 2015 UTC,I've heard there will be server merges later this year and you may get free transfer tokens during that time.  And I also remember reading it won't apply for changing from an EU server to an NA one. Which is exactly what I wanted...so unless they change that at some point don't expect EU to NA or vice versa.

lotro,3ch7mt,SwordOfCheese,12,Tue Jul 7 21:56:04 2015 UTC,"Usually I play MMOs to reach end game content (raids, pvp, whatever). I skip by everything as fast as possible to get there. LOTRO is the only game I've ran around for hours exploring just because the world was so interesting. Sometimes I'll be in the middle of a quest and just have to stop because I found something really interesting. Weathertop is a great example of this. As soon as I saw it for the first time in the distance I had to run up to the top, even though I didn't have any quests for it yet. This is mostly due to loving the LotR series so much, so anyone that hasn't already read the books/watched the movies will probably not get as much out of it."
lotro,3ch7mt,BlameTheNargles,3,Tue Jul 7 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"did you know, that on Weathertop, there is one part of explorer deed called The Adventures of Floid and Dewitt (It looks closest to all starter areas so it can be considered a starter of this deed).  edit: And there is The Adventures of Floid and Dewitt: Part Deux as I just found out."

lotro,3ch7mt,Guitarchim,8,Wed Jul 8 10:47:45 2015 UTC,"I've played most of the games you have listed there, as well. I think the main thing that keeps me coming back to LotRO constantly is Middle-earth itself. It's expansive (seriously expansive; WoW is probably the only MMO that comes close in terms of sheer scale), beautiful despite the age of the game, and Turbine did an admirable job of translating Tolkien's vision. If there's a particular place you enjoyed in the books/films, it's probably in the game as-described by Tolkien."
lotro,3ch7mt,outbound_flight,4,Wed Jul 8 00:06:33 2015 UTC,"This was my thought as well, the lore in other MMO's is ok, but that moment when you first see Weathertop, or the first time you take the trail into a mysterious valley and Rivendell unfolds before you with that awesome score, moments like that are magical. These are the places you have read about, and they look and feel just like you imagined.    Edit: Forgot Moria. I love Moria."
lotro,3ch7mt,Malcolm_Y,9,Wed Jul 8 01:02:24 2015 UTC,"Lotro is like an old medallion, it has 2 faces on each side of the coin. On one side you have a great game til level 75, with tons of quests, zones, instances and what not to enjoy. Great classes to experiment with and a great game overall, among the best in my humble opinion.  The other side is a bit darker. Once you hit level 85 a dark cloud will appear above your head, indicating the beginning of a headache and a final warning for you if you keep on playing. If you care to complete every deed (like me, all done but the raids) you better have some aspirin pill ready at 85 and beyond.  Once you reach Hytbold (lvl85) you are forced to grind/gain lots of reputation with said region, of course you cant grind all in one day. Even if you use few reputation ""doubler"" giving you twice as much xp/rep with said faction, it will still take you at least a whole week (per character) ...   And once done, before Hytbold even, you´re introduced to mounted combat and sadly have to endure a painful experience ´til 100 with it. Mounted Combat simply does not work in Lotro and the constant ""rubberbanding"" while on your warsteed is just painful, there are not that many quests that require you to kill mounted enemies, but there are quite a few deeds that require you to kill 200 of´em, in each region that is, for ever character that you have.  At 85 til 100 the game offers nothing new, but waaaaay too big landscapes and boring and repetitive Big Battles; ... once 95/100 a new set of faction rep open up for you (like Hytbold, but this time like 10 more) and the grind starts from zero again (for every alt that you have), at 100 you can do some of the new 3/6man and 12? (is there a new raid?, im nto sure) and gear up your character.  My advice  Pick a main and level up the alts via a power leveler or by doing the ""Kill 20 Wolves and 8 Guard"" Optional Quests in the 3man Instance Warg-pens + use these and it wont take long to hit 100 with any of your alts, its boring ... (soloable).  And if you´re like me, ignore the alts completely and play with your main solely until they fix or grant more xp ... not going to level up all my alts on 3 different servers.   I feel this is a honest review of Lotro it has :   (+)great atmosphere (+)looks better than some of the moderns games out there, its in desperate need of some polygon-botox though (+)free to download (+)great music (+)great classes (+)many instances (+)group gameplay (+)solo gameplay (+)a lot of content (theoretically one could unlock everything for free > turbine points grinding) (+)many roleplay events on Laurelin and Landroval/Crickhollow (+)nice community overall, helpful most of the time ... (-)many trolls and $#!""@? people/kids/adults on pretty much every server doing their ""wrongful doings"" (-)some server are like a Ghosttown, nothing but dust ... (-)game is 8 years old, meaning that your 4x Titan investment won´t be fully utilized ever. Not even at 4K ... (-)PvP apparently is a lagfest (dunno, i don´t pvp) (-)less and less updates coming out, at least that´s my sensation of the past few months or so. (-)Terribad mounted action and Faction Grind at 85 and 100   Even with that argh! Grind at 85 and 100, i would still recommend this over any other mmorpg out there. For a small break in between and if you want to experience something new > Guild Wars 1 is a nice addition to your Lotro-addiction :)"

Been through that grind, not knowing that those tomes even existed. It took me about a whole month ... they might have updated these like they have with the level 100 Grind Dailies (Dol Amaroth).  GL and HF :P  €dit at college, for the Deed. You still have to do it at least once, if you care about that."
lotro,3ch7mt,hueresiech,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:14:28 2015 UTC,Why the fuck would anyone do hytbold anymore? For the 1 thane of hytbold quest ? I actually completed it when 85 was cap and i gotta say east and west rohan are dark fucking days in lotro history. East-central-western gondor were the light at the end of the tunnel. Get helms deep rep depening on your crafting and rush to gondor immediately. The story and quests in rohan are total shit but at least the game is trying to fix it now.

lotro,3ch7mt,Zaraia,6,Wed Jul 8 13:31:42 2015 UTC,"I've been coming back to this game year after year since 2008. As much as I hate to see the decline of this game in terms of quality of content (in recent years) there is still something magical about the atmosphere, the landscape, and the stories that are found within LOTRO.  If you are a fan of Tolkien's works you will likely find an authentic connection with Turbine's interpretation of Middle-Earth; this is your biggest ""sell"" on the game. I feel Turbine really 'got' the essence of Tolkien's Middle-Earth. From the peaceful and light-hearted atmosphere of the Shire to the deep, dark, and foreboding depths of Moria there is an immersion I've experienced that I can't say I've found in another game. The soundtrack to this game can be really amazing as well! Any of Chance Thomas' contributions to the soundtrack are gold. He really did his homework and tried to bring each zone to life with his music.  LOTRO, to me, is all about the journey not the destination. Don't rush to min/max your character and get to end-game... you will only leave disappointed. This is not a raiders game any more. Find a good kin (our version of guilds, preferable one thats into leveling). Levels 1 - 60 are the strongest in the game in my opinion. Its free-to-play so just jump in and give the game 15-20 levels (I highly recommend starting as a race of man character as the Bree zone is one of the strongest and most fleshed out areas of the game in my opinion)."
lotro,3ch7mt,Talmidim,3,Wed Jul 8 04:58:51 2015 UTC,Come back to gondor. Rohan is a dark memory but gondor is getting better by the zone.

lotro,3ch7mt,Collegenoob,5,Wed Jul 8 21:37:34 2015 UTC,"Gives you a chance to explore the world of Tolkien. That right there is one of the reasons I still play. As mentioned already, it is a medallion.. if I want to pvp then ill log eve or gw2, if I want to raid ill log FF. I find lotro to be the middle ground as I always end up playing it.   Do yourself a favor and don't power level on your first character. Take the time to explore and level at your own pace. Don't give up the joys of low levels for end game. If you have experience with MMOS then I'm assuming you have friends who might be interested as well. Having friends to explore, quest and run on level instances with is prob the most important thing if you are after fun.   People play this game expecting it to have next gen pvp and raiding with every update, as much as I love raiding and maxing out toons, I do look forward to epics and the other things I've only read about in the books and or seen in the films. Also the little things they add.. gotta love em.  The animated toys in Bree or reading all the fortunes. Knowing all the references.  People still give me crap for not wanting to raid or farm instances for hours ALL the time but idc.   I think one of the funniest moments I've had in the game is role playing as a horse. The thing is, you are not in a private instance as you do the quests. That means we were able to run through Bree faster than warsteeds and had people wondering what the hell it was. Not going to ruin it for you though; you'll just have to find out for yourself.  I'll try to remember adding a screenshot later. Mobile data is slow :( can't load the hundreds of screenshots   Oh and the community. There will always be trolls but of all the games I've played, Lotro seems to have the most mature community. Thank god /wd isn't like going to Edgeville in a pking world and having some 12 year old cuss you out on a daily basis and proceeding to call you a ""kid"" and a ""nerd""."
lotro,3ch7mt,Patriotp3a,3,Wed Jul 8 06:36:20 2015 UTC,"Little things really catch me sometimes. Runes left by Gandalf at important spots in the story. Bugs buzzing about a street lamp in Bree, an Elf ruin back-lit by the gloaming, a flock of birds startled from a tree in Duillond, the rain.  They did a ton of wonderful work."
lotro,3ch7mt,Chakra5,2,Wed Jul 8 08:00:23 2015 UTC,Couldn't have said it better myself - well done! :)
lotro,3ch7mt,Zaraia,3,Wed Jul 8 13:38:31 2015 UTC,"I will echo some sentiments already posted here, but for me what makes LOTRO fun is just being in Middle Earth. Exploring is a huge deal for me, something I do in similar games all the time (Fallout and Skyrim for example). I'm totally fine saying fuck the gameplay and just running to the top of Amon Sul or climbing to the top of the Colossus at Evendim just because. Love of exploration and love of Tolkein lore makes that the best part.  The only other MMO I have ever played is PlanetSide 2, and that's an obvious outlier being the one and only realy MMOFPSRPG in existence. Being an FPS is what truly sets it apart from any other MMO, so LOTRO is really the only traditional MMO style game I have ever played. That said, I honestly am not a huge fan of it gameplay wise. It is fun to a good degree, even without my love of the lore, but I don't think the gameplay alone is enough to get me into any other similar MMO. Right now it's just the lore that does most of it for me, and the gameplay is good enough to make it enjoyable long term."
lotro,3ch7mt,Hader102,3,Wed Jul 8 07:08:45 2015 UTC,"Unlike most other MMOs (with the notable exception of EVE), the player base is more mature here. I actually read most quests' text, as the setting is amazing. It takes a long time to reach cap, but that's actually a good thing because the content's good from lowbie to cap. The F2P mechanic is fair for both VIPs (sub payers) and F2P people. It's very playable without paying, but you'll likely end up paying for quest packs if if you don't want a severe TP (Turbine Points) grind. It's huge. It's Tolkien. And all the lore from the LOTR universe is there."
lotro,3ch7mt,jonaskid,2,Wed Jul 8 16:13:11 2015 UTC,"The texture art, terrain/scenery, and seamless maps are second to none.  The music system and housing (instanced neighborhoods).  Mounted combat.

They've definitely made some positive changes in terms of end-game compared to a year or two ago. The lack of challenging 12-man raid content however is disappointing.  Community is by far the best of any MMO I've played (GW2, SWTOR, ESO). This is probably the biggest factor that draws me back to LOTRO. Yes you'll have the range of trolls, elitists, etc, but toxic players are few are far between. The majority of the playerbase is just warm and friendly.  Graphics are aging, but the artists keep showing off their creativity and pushing the engine every update. About 2-3 major updates are released a year, about on par with other MMOs, and which I think is impressive for an MMO of this age. A new PvP map set in Osgiliath is coming out shortly, which I'm very excited for."
lotro,3chttf,dudebruh,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:48:32 2015 UTC,"One thing in your description that stuck out was the 10 minute delay, I've never seen this, even when my computer was blue screening every half hour, and the reset button on my computer was the only way to recover.   I would hit reset, reboot Win7, and everything was instantly good again.  There was never a 10m time delay.  That sounds like a piece of hardware gets too hot, and then takes a while to cool back down before the game will work properly.  Processors will automatically slow down when overheated, these modern protections are built in the chip.  When processors slow down too much, it might disrupt the network traffic.  One thing to do is check your hardware for basic health, especially including the cooling.  There are 3 main parts of this, all using free software.   Test your memory.  The easiest way to do this is to make a bootable USB stick that includes memtest86 on it.  Use the Easy2boot usb stick process.  This will give you a very handy USB stick for fixing computer stuff.  In this case, you boot from the stick, go to the utilities/memtest menu, and pick memtest86.  It will find if your ram is bad. Check your temperatures just after LOTRO crashes, using a tool called Speedfan.  It has a graphing feature so that you can see the last few minutes of temperatures.  You need to make sure your computer is cooling well. Run a hard stress test on your computer to make sure that you don't have over heating issues.  The easiest and best tool is Furmark.  It will stress both your CPU and GPU, so you can make sure the temperature is stable and not too high.   If you have a laptop with over heating problems, then you are quite likely to have the internal heat sink plugged up with lint, which means no cooling can flow.  The fix is to open the laptop and clean it out, replacing the fan while you ar e in."
lotro,3chttf,exploderator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:53:04 2015 UTC,"Thanks for replying! While solid advice, I can say with confidence this is not s hardware issue. I play on a desktop that I built myself that has plenty of cooling and airflow, nothing is overheating. I can play any other game, Diablo 3, gta 5, WoW etc. all on the highest graphics settings for extended periods of time without any issues. It is definitely connection related. When the disconnect does happen, lotro is literally the only thing running that is effected. My hardware remains running properly and my internet is still on. Really strange stuff. Wondering if maybe it has something to do with the dynamic layers when switching zones? Really at a loss here"
lotro,3chttf,exploderator,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:19:28 2015 UTC,"A fellow DIY builder :)  I think more people should build their own PC.  I do recommend exactly the same tests, just for shits and giggles, it's interesting to see what your machine can do.  And that USB stick really is indispensable for troubleshooting and recovery.  I plugged my machine through a Watt (power) meter.  It uses 75W at idle, about 250W in LOTRO, and about 510W with full CPU burn + GPU burn using Furmark.  I have very slow quite fans, and on low speed it keeps up with LOTRO no problem.  But not Furmark, that 510W draw is a bitch, and it's a good thing no real-life game will ever quite hit the system at full 100% hard.  I have an AMD hex core CPU with an AMD R9 280X GPU, a pretty average modern system.  As for your problem though... I'm struggling to think what that 10m delay could be caused by.  The LOTRO servers take under a minute to fully clear your prior session, so it can't be server side.  Since a computer reboot takes about a minute, you should be able to do a full reboot and log straight back in.  If the delay is anywhere in software in your computer, a reboot is a complete fresh start, so there should be no long delay.  If there is still a delay after a reboot, then the last remaining place is your router.  I wonder if some bug in the router's firewall could be hanging from an open session that got dropped when LOTRO crashed, and then won't resume until the router times out and clears that out.  It would make sense of your impression that it's a connection problem, but I'm really just guessing by elimination of where the problem is.  Good luck :)"

lotro,3cd5yg,kimbatheknome,8,Tue Jul 7 00:05:07 2015 UTC,"Don't quote me on this, but I sorta remember hearing that this is part of what was going to be Sierra's Middle Earth Online before Turbine purchased everything and eventually turned the game into Lord of the Rings Online.  I read/heard/imagined that some of the parts of MEO that had been developed were left in, either as certain existing structures (certain parts of Bree?) or areas in non accessible areas simply as decoration such as the one OP described."
lotro,3cd5yg,UDE785,5,Tue Jul 7 01:12:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're thinking of the Tower Hills, which would have lain in between Celondim and the Grey Havens. The Grey Havens would have been in MEO, but they were cut from LOTRO.  The ruins OP is talking about lay in between Kheledul and the Shire. They were most likely only ever intended as scenery."

lotro,3c7eka,gnoxy84,12,Sun Jul 5 16:11:29 2015 UTC,"The community in this game is one of the best and most friendly in an mmo, which is a shame because of how small it is. Group content depends on which zone you're in, but a lot of it is fun, though I suggest joining a kinship ASAP. Being in a large kinship can make the seemingly empty world feel more social, and its always nice to have people to run the group content with. That said, if you like raids, they're practically nonexistant now unless you join one of those kinships that limit their level to run old raids, which can be fun. Overall, the game is really fun, and with the packs and everything on sale, I say go for it."
lotro,3c7eka,Anarchanoid,3,Sun Jul 5 17:54:55 2015 UTC,There are plenty of raids that have been scled to 100 that people occasionally do. Just those people who were doing those runs have now devoted their time to running the 3 new osgilith instances for the new challenge and gear. Really A+ on the instances and I can't wait for this dev team to make a raid
lotro,3c7eka,Collegenoob,2,Mon Jul 6 01:28:44 2015 UTC,As I understood the devs had swore off on making raids. It's the main reason I quit some time ago since Big Battles just looked like crappier skirmishes to me . Has this changed?
lotro,3c7eka,Thybro,3,Mon Jul 6 11:21:46 2015 UTC,Honestly I never got really involved with that whole speile as I take break from lotro when i get bored. But supposedly there is a new director for the game and without infinite crisis wasting resoruces they have time to make lotro better. I don't know if this dev tea mwill make a new raid. But I damn sure hope they do because it would be amazing.   Current focus atm is working on the new osgilith pvp map which is a few bullroarer builds out. Then server mirgrations. Then server merges. Then minas tirith which sadly has to have BBs. I just hope they add BBs and actual instances.
lotro,3c7eka,Collegenoob,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:27:09 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I guess it's now all wait and see except now I'll actually be watching for it.
lotro,3c7eka,Thybro,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:07:53 2015 UTC,You might want to get a headstart. Currentlyy biggest gripe with the game is the gear grind. They added a new gearing system. The essence system this gear has some stats on it then slots which allow you to put a stat on it. Like 139 of your chosen stat then 17 vit. Or 875 morale. The issue is the only good place to get them is big battles dol amorth dailies or some book instances. This currently sucks and it takes a while to properly gear yourself
lotro,3c7eka,Collegenoob,1 point,Mon Jul 6 12:13:49 2015 UTC,"Gear is overrated.  If ya can't fight orcs naked, then yet not doing it right :)"
lotro,3c7eka,Gilamarth,2,Mon Jul 6 18:41:06 2015 UTC,"They never swore off anything.  They did communicate no new instances before end of 2014 so folks would not be expecting stuff and disappointed.  They did good, people perverted the message leaving out the timeframe.  Beginning of 2015 they released three new classic instances...that they obviously had been working on back when they said nothing before the end of the year.    Now on the test server is a brand new pvp area.  Something else ""people"" said never would happen.    What will they do in the future?  They said the appropriate venue to move the story forward, be they classic instance style, skirm or Battle.  The new Pelargir Battle has been well received and gets run frequently from what I see."
lotro,3c7eka,RJFerret,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:46:25 2015 UTC,"Good I'll check out the new pvp content once it's out.  Though I do have to disagree I was there, I read the forum posts. The mentioned something about only 10% of the player base being raiders and clearly stated that they were moving away from raids in favor of Big Battles and didn't have plans for any raids in the future. Instances are ok and all. But they don't have the same appeal as raids and that was the nail on the coffin for me and I decided to quit for a bit."

lotro,3c7eka,SneakySmeagolses,8,Tue Jul 7 02:39:24 2015 UTC,"The current executive producer blows away the previous two.  They've been releasing content players have asked for (group instances of smaller sizes) and folks have been returning from years ago.  Level cap is 100, which is a long way from what you remember.  Story/writing is still great, voice overs are better.  Their other game (Infinite Crisis) was a flop and is closing, it seems they are refocusing on Lotro a bit.    They are also streamlining, by end of year merging servers and moving Euro folk back across the pond which should improve ping times for them.  All in all things have been great recently, and fewer doomsdayers in the forums.  Two-three years ago there was a slump under previous management."
lotro,3c7eka,RJFerret,5,Mon Jul 6 00:45:02 2015 UTC,"For the casual player, the game has never been better.  They've recently started implementing tons of 'quality of life' improvements that generally make the day to day game-play more user friendly, intuitive, and quite frankly just plain easier.  Things like being able to use an entire stack of reputation items, or not needing travel rations any more, or having a whole 'processing' column of crafting that converts raw materials from A to B to A in perpetuity for those looking to level up their crafting tier, the ability to turn off inscriptions when crafting so that the process doesn't halt when you're afk, you no longer have to go to a bard to make character trait changes, Moria as a whole has been streamlined....the list goes on and on."
lotro,3c7eka,7h3C47,3,Mon Jul 6 11:07:29 2015 UTC,"A Founder/Lifetimer here -- LOTRO is still all about Middle-Earth and Tolkien's LOTR Trilogy. It is NOT, and never was, about PvP (or PvMP as it is called in LOTRO.  2007 style Raiding and Instances have similarly been ignored in favor of Big Battles. Update 16.2 -- currently in test on Bullroarer -- has a new PvMP area -- Sundering of Osgiliath. (Although the current criticism of this is that it is strictly a Zerg-fest! The Fields of Pelennor are another Big Battle expected with (probably) Update 17 this fall, but possibly not until 2016. Turbine has not made any statements about this. The other Big Battle addition was retaking Pelargir. All of that said, the various communities in LOTRO are still quite functional. True, kins dedicated to Raiding have basically died.  Since Warner Brothers terminated their MOBA, IC (Infinite Crisis), the question has been are any of those Devs coming BACK to LOTRO?"
lotro,3c7eka,Whmagill,2,Mon Jul 6 15:48:10 2015 UTC,I love the game. I've loved it for 7 years. It's the only MMO that I can pay attention to for any long period of time. I recently discovered monster play and I am totally hooked. Big servers (Brandywine) are alive and well.

If Turbine was smart they'd start steering all their resources back into LotRO, it's the best thing they've got and recent updates have proven that they can still push this engine.  I'm on Landroval.

lotro,3c53g6,cirion5,2,Tue Jul 7 14:25:08 2015 UTC,"That's a good price for Helm's Deep, but Helm's Deep is for players level 85 and up. If you're starting fresh, it will take a long time to level that high, and there will almost certainly be another sale for HD before you reach that point. The questpacks + quad pack will take you all the way from start to level 85 without needing to buy any other expansions."
lotro,3c53g6,RJFerret,2,Sun Jul 5 02:01:57 2015 UTC,"Actually with Helm's Deep you get Big Battles, which you can do down to level 10.  They offer the best jewelry in the game scaled to your level roughly (by every fifth level).  At cap, Battles are one of the best resources of much needed Essences and First Age legendary symbols.  So getting it would be useful, and an investment in the future."
lotro,3c53g6,Batfink16,2,Sun Jul 5 02:37:49 2015 UTC,"If you're absolutely sure you want to continue playing, I would recommend getting the quad pack for $10 and Helms Deep for $10. Helms Deep comes with 1,000 Turbine Points which is enough for Evendim. That will get you to about level 40, which you can then get Angmar with the extra TP and the TP you've earned from deeds along the way. You could also go for Eregion, but you might need to grind a couple levels if you do that.  If you're not completely sure you want to stick around, I would wait."
lotro,3c53g6,contom05,2,Sun Jul 5 13:40:42 2015 UTC,Why not the quest pack? Also I plan on it as me and a buddy are playing
lotro,3c4l3v,SirPeriwinkle33,3,Sat Jul 4 18:51:36 2015 UTC,"I think it's a great value, however it might be wise to wait until you're about level 30. No point spending money until you're sure you're into the game.  EDIT: To clarify, IIRC level 30 is about when the free quests run out, and after that you'd need to do a lot of grinding unless you buy new quest packs. The Mithril edition should take you to almost level 60. One thing to consider is that the Quad Pack (the Moria, Mirkwood, Isengard, and Riders of Rohan expansions) is on sale for $10 at the moment. I can't recall if the expansions come with Turbine points, but if they do, that would probably be a better deal at the moment.  EDIT 2: I did some looking and as far as I can tell, the quad pack doesn't come with extra Turbine points."
lotro,3c4l3v,ThePotatoReborn,2,Sat Jul 4 18:58:28 2015 UTC,"In the past, the Mithril Edition has occasionally gone on sale for 50% or 75% off. It's an incredibly good deal when on sale. At full price, it's still pretty good. It gives you 2000 TP, and quest packs worth another 3000. Buying that many Turbine Points would ordinarily cost ~US$50.  If you want to spend $20 on the game, a better deal is the current sale on all quest packs. This doesn't include the expansions like Moria, but those quests would usually cost 6300 TP to unlock, which would cost ~US$60 if you bought them by spending money on TPs."
lotro,3c4l3v,cirion5,1 point,Sat Jul 4 19:58:15 2015 UTC,"These are not all the quest packs, what about the gondor packs? Bit of false advertisement"

lotro,3c4l3v,Batfink16,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:01:12 2015 UTC,"Quad Pack is a fantastic deal. As is Helms Deep ($10 for 1000 TP + Helms Deep? Bargain). Mithril Edition is a great deal, too.   Steely Dawn Starter Pack from Steam is on sale currently $5, down from $20 which gives you 5 100% XP tomes on every character (fantastic), 500TP ($1 per 100 TP is the average rate unless you put down $50+), and Evendim.  Mithril Edition deal can be got any time, the Steely Dawn Starter Pack, Quad Pack, and Helms Deep deals probably won't be available again until Black Friday (late November), at which time Mithril Edition will likely go on sale.  Personally I'd go some combo of Quad Pack, Steely Dawn, and Helms Deep. All 3 would get you all expansions, Evendim, 1500 TP, and 5 100% EXP accelerators for $25. You can get Mithril Edition later, for a good amount cheaper most likely. Doubt Quad Pack will go much cheaper (Think it might have been $7.50 at one time? Mithril has been sold for $5 before on last Black Friday, if I recall correctly).  Edit: Note if that you're just starting out if you search 'LOTRO Starter Pack giveaway' you should be able to find a site which you can use a throwaway email account to get a starter pack which gives you Riding Skill, 100% Exp boost, a Skill and Slayer Deed Boost, for every character on your account. Very worthwhile for a minor inconvenience of starting a throwaway email."

The amount of damage I can soak now is amazing and I can pull in several on-level mobs and just work my way through them.

lotro,3c4guz,ceeller,3,Sun Jul 5 16:51:26 2015 UTC,"wb to warden! First of all, the main gambits I use for dps is Spear of Virtue, Piercing Strike, Surety of Death, and Brink of Victory. The gambits I use after those usually depends on what masteries I have available and whether I need heals or whatever.

If there's a lot of incoming damage, I might tier up the heal as well (shield spear, shield spear shield, shield spear shield spear shield).  We are really pretty tough to defeat.  Most of the time, I save other gambits for fellowing, but I shake it up once in awhile just to finish deeds or to do something different."

If you really learn how the gambits work with each other and try to fire off gambit chains, then the class is a mini Fellowship in itself. If you're a button masher, then it's a bit underpowered. This class is really effected by play style and good Wardens have several different rotations in play that mesh together for sticking it hard to the forces of the Shadow.  I think there is a gambit tracker plugin, but I don't use it so can't comment on it. Search through this subreddit for the various Warden threads and you'll find all sorts of tips."

I have pretty much every class level 100 but I just cannot seem to get off my Warden because I love the playstyle in which the class brings to the table. I really recommend playing it and learning the gambit system, it isn't as complex as others make it out to be and you will begin to build gambits just on muscle memory by the time you hit level cap :)"

lotro,3c2gw6,Erebdraug,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:13:28 2015 UTC,"Warden was my first level capped character, loved it all the way up, loved it until a couple months ago. Why? Because it's boring after a point. I really enjoyed the challenge that was learning all the gambits and all the different ways to build them, I enjoyed the ""OPness"" of it in the Ettenmoors (The PvP area of LOTRO) after I had drilled every way to build every gambit into my head.   Then it became boring. Kills came easy to me, there was no challenge. The best challenge for the Warden is learning the gambit system and levelling with it, but after developing muscle memory for gambits and having some experience with it in PvP, it's broken, and boring.  I still use my Warden for farming instances, daily quests and stuff, but that's about it.  Just my 2 cents"
lotro,3c2gw6,MacCollac,1 point,Sat Jul 4 21:25:12 2015 UTC,Any links guides for newbies warden?
lotro,3c2gw6,One_Actuation,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:37:35 2015 UTC,"Warden used to be so bad, you had to play it at the highest skill level just to be on par with everyone else. Then the devs got this idea that they should give wardens arguably the best survivability AND single target/aoe damage. if you are good enough at it, you can main tank a raid and still be one of the top dps in the group. If you are looking for a dot class to play, I would suggest LM, maybe rune keeper which is also OP but not as bad as wardens.  You may like warden and play it anyway but most of my friends (Dwarrowdelf) geared their wardens and switched classes because it became too overpowered.  Most people roll wardens with the idea they'll faceroll because the class is faceroll. Don't be that guy.  As far as dots and a challege, sounds like yellow hunters to me.  I don't like yellow hunters as much cuz I'm mostly running redline endgame and it's close to useless in grouping outside of PvP.  Best of luck to you!"

Can you please point me to a good, up-to-date guide?  So many of the guides are outdated with all the dramatic class changes in the last few years, and it is hard to tell which is which.  I am past ELI5 level but need good pointers."
lotro,3c2gw6,RJFerret,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:25:05 2015 UTC,"Yellow hunter is an easy solo, though.  CC and damage from traps is sweet.  Wardens and that kind of tanking are like most things at level 100 where people are talking about RC T2 and stuff like that -- if you have spent the time to do your virtues/deeds, maximized your class trait points, and geared using 4 slot essence armour and BB jewelry in a certain combo, plus you know the class inside out, then you can do what they are talking about.  If you're one of the many more casual players, don't expect to feel particularly OP as a warden.  Stronger, definitely, but don't think you'll be soloing 3-mans all the time."
lotro,3c2gw6,Gorelal,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"People don't think of wardens in terms of bleeds, that's more the territory of burgs (an entire traitline of dots), guardians (ditto), and lore-masters.  Wardens used to be best tanks, and too op for solo.  Currently, wardens are having a hard time tanking the end game content, guards and captains are preferred.  Another warden liability to watch out for is their large aoe range tends to break cc.  If you want a complex, challenging class, since you already have burg, I'd suggest LM.  I don't believe you'd find warden complex or challenging, they are more easy to run through stuff without feeling challenged.  Instead you have to seek out or major your own challenges by doing group content alone or stuff like that."
lotro,3c2gw6,RJFerret,2,Sat Jul 4 19:57:52 2015 UTC,Just thought I'd add that wardens don't have a hard time at all in the new instances tanking if you know what you are doing. In fact in sunken labrynth T2 they can tank with no healer and can do DPS at the same time. For ruined city t2 they can solo the whole instance up until the last boss and can pretty much dps the whole time at last boss with a healer and can be responsible for under 30 minute instances in Ruined city T2C with the correct group.  In Dome T2 they are the preferred tank as they can do heaps of DPS to help with DPS race with Mumakil and can grab adds with conviction. In lord of pinions they can DC every 20 seconds and spam EoB and fierce resolve to kill the devoted which have reflect which a guardian and captain can't because they would die. For last boss challenge they can grab all the extra adds and have DC MIT's up 60% of the time which is pretty much invincibility and can give themselves stun immunity if you lack an LM and not to mention that wardens self heal themselves with 4k HPS and also heal each member in your fellowship at 500-1000 HPS.
lotro,3c2gw6,Gorelal,2,Sun Jul 5 10:38:47 2015 UTC,"That hasn't been my experience with wardens in RC T2 finale boss (we skip the rest of the instance), while guards and captanks take little damage, wardens that tank other instances really well get hit harder and sometimes get one-shot, despite capped mits and some stacked morale.    Captank could be healed with lower level healer, while top geared 100 rk had troubles keeping a warden up.  That being said, the warden had only been in there a dozen times or so, while the captain hadn't tanked it, he knew the mechanics from healing it on alts.  However the guard had never seen the T2 fight before.  I have read the thread in the warden forums asking how to tank that boss, despite not having a warden myself, but the very existence of that thread kind of tells you something.  As dps/support, easiest for me was guard, I had more to do for captank, and most for warden and it took more retries."
lotro,3c2gw6,RJFerret,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:33:52 2015 UTC,"A warden getting one shot in Ruined City with Capped mits and stacked morale, did they have Crit defence as well? At the moment I have no problems with the final boss, I am pretty much dpsing and just putting stun immunity on before getting stunned.  Luckily I recorded a video yesterday which shows this to prove I am not going crazy: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70A1u2mfD0M As you can see from the video we were able to kill the boss in under 3 minutes with only a warden and Yellow mini dpsing and that I am able to put out nearly 5k DPS whilst easily taking the damage. I am just assuming the wardens you have been with haven't been well geared or don't know the right gambits to use. Also it is to my belief that it is actually possible to solo the last boss with a warden as I was able to get him down to 700k Solo before the bleed being to much for me to heal through, with the right RNG it is definitely possible to get this down solo.  I am sure I am not the only warden that thinks tanking the new instances with a Warden is more than possible and even preferred, I am just posting from my experience in tanking them also I think Lag maybe a problem on some of the bigger servers as I get major lag and I am on a less populated server and that could effect gambit building speed as it effects me nearly everytime I do Ruined City T2C."
lotro,3c1ds7,Hader102,2,Fri Jul 3 21:35:42 2015 UTC,"Brandywine is the biggest server. Probably the best for grouping if that's your jam. Gladden is 2nd biggest. I'm partial to Gladden, lots of nice folks there. :) Landroval is 3rd, it has a thriving RP and player music scene.  But server mergers are coming later this year, and there will be free transfers. Create a character on a couple different servers that interest you, check out the guild/kin situation, and then decide. :)"
lotro,3c1ds7,Moxiedoodle,2,Sun Jul 5 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard Landroval is more of a RP server in the first place (though I could just be an idiot and be confusing it with Laurelin, lol), so if you dont RP there probably arent many reasons to switch over there.  Normally I would recommend Brandywine because that is the server that I play on and its the most populated server so finding PUGs usually doesnt take too long. However, Brandywine has been plagued with occasional but terrible lag for a long time now, so if it weren't for my kin on Brandy I probably would have switched servers already.  Interestingly, from reading many comments on this same question, there seems to be somewhat of a concensus that the Gladden server is sort of a best of both worlds by having higher population while also having little lag and a friendly community (Brandy has a friendly community too, just need to stay away from world chat). So for now, my recommendation is the Gladden server. Good luck with the game and happy hunting!"

Raiding?  PvP?  Crafting?  Festivals?  Social?  Fourth, promote your kin.  If you spam /world, you'll get a bunch of disconnected people who don't initiate things but will join activities.  They also may be flighty and not stick around long.  If you respond to folks seeking kins, similar if you blind invite them, better if you chat with them first.  If you go to lower level areas seeking non-kin affiliated folk, IM them to see if they are interested/compatible.  Be prepared to describe what your group is like.

The persistent drama of one or two members not getting along will destroy it. If you want to chat about it, I'm totally game. It's half the reason I don't play anymore.  Activities: If you're the RP type, schedule RP events at your kinhall/personal house. My group used to have a monthly ""night of music"" where people could come play to an audience. It always ended with a special ""finale"" - a piece I'd pick to play for the theme of the month (October's was Saint-Saëns Danse Macabre, for example). I had a program that would convert MIDI files to ABC files that LOTRO uses (I honestly forget the name of it).  Other activities we used to do: Deed Runs (to fulfill slayer/exploration deeds), Book Quest Runs, Stable Tours (RP-ish, Hunter would port the Fellowship around to all the places he could so members could 'discover' the stables). We'd do most of these in RP-mode. We also had crafting fairs where we'd swap various crafting supplies and items.  If you're not the RP type, or your kin is RP-Lite, schedule raids/group fights."

lotro,3bkkag,7h3C47,1 point,Tue Jun 30 10:59:37 2015 UTC,"I really like Landy. While I have never played on another server, we get a LOT of people from other servers (looking at you, Brandywine) that are amazed at how helpful, friendly, and generally non-trollish Landy is. As for classes, as someone else pointed out, everyone's preferences are different. In the character creation screen it tells you a little about each class, by looking at that and lotro forums you can get a better idea about what you'd like. If you are looking for groups, healers (minstrels) seem to be the most sought-after. If you end up going with Landroval, feel free to PM me if you feel like fellowing :)"
lotro,3bexvq,Aytri,3,Sun Jun 28 16:41:15 2015 UTC,"Well all classes can work in groups (mostly), but if you don't want the    standard reply   I suggest a tank, healer, or support that may be able to do both. So Guardian, Warden, Captain, Minstrel, Rune Keeper would be a good place to start. From there it depends what you want to do. Some other classes like the Burglar and Lore Master are support options as well but can't tank or heal (LM can heal a bit from my experience with one, otherwise all have been DPS). Even DPS can get into full size fellowships easily. Actually, people want my Warden (hybrid tank/DPS) to go full DPS in them. My RK usually ends up having to heal though  Captain is always an all around good choice to get in groups. I don't have a high level Captain though to share any experiences."
lotro,3bexvq,Louey7,2,Sun Jun 28 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"My main is a captain. Very good for groups, because you can spec as a viable tank, support, or for easy stuff, healer. Later on, with the harder stuff, you're going to pretty much always be support, because there are so many other tank classes, but you shouldn't have much trouble finding anything.  Honestly, though, I'd say burglar is probably the class I see posted for most often."
lotro,3bexvq,aeisenst,3,Mon Jun 29 03:44:57 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if you play whatever you are really well, you'll get a group.

lotro,3bexvq,LilRach05,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:57:10 2015 UTC,"Guardian if you like to charge into the fray and hit stuff.  (Wardens are trickier so not as group friendly tanks.)  Minstrel if you like ranged and healing, RK is an option too.  The former if your brain is more reactive, the latter if more proactive.  Captain if you have ADHD and like support classes that can do a little of everything for smaller groups if geared for it."
lotro,3bexvq,RJFerret,0,Mon Jun 29 14:45:47 2015 UTC,"Been about a year since I played but at endgame just about every class had a place in raids, there's very good PvE balance in LotRO."
lotro,3bexvq,boldolio,1 point,Mon Jun 29 08:48:04 2015 UTC,"You haven't played nowadays than. The balance sucks. Fire Runekeepers are the DPS class and Hunters/Champions do atleast 1/3 less damage than fire rks (single target), champions have their use as an aoe classes still, but that is it.  Also tanks. Wardens cannot tank t2 raids as they will get one hit while a guardian can easily tank them. Allthough warden can tank t2 6/3man, they get considerably more damage than guardians and might even be a onehit if they get unlucky.  If you call that balance, i dont know.  EDIT: BTW a red warden with 2 osgiliath set pieces will out dps a fire runekeeper by a huge amount."
lotro,3bexvq,Tywien,0,Mon Jun 29 09:31:05 2015 UTC,"I have to agree with you on balance seen as though my warden is able to double my hunters DPS but as for tanking wardens for T2 raids I don't think the wardens you are running with are well geared with 40k+ morale, 60%+ crit defence, capped mits and a solid BPE when buffed as I have never been one shotted when doing T2 Raids with my new gear also tanking with a warden is nice because you can put out 10 times the DPS a tanking Guardian can do so it makes the raid quicker depending on what raid you are doing.  I understand you said wardens can tank T2 6 mans but I mean my warden is able to solo several T2C 6 mans such as Fornost Fire, Earth and Sammath Gul. (Trying to get Bells of Dale T2C but it's very hard to complete last boss in 15 minutes while keeping myself alive) so this just shows that Warden can take an unbelievable amount of damage whilst having no healer so say if you wanted to solo tank one of the trolls in BFE T2 you wouldn't need a healer for the warden (Even though a healer is recommended)  Any tank class (Guard, Cappy, Warden, Beorning and Champion) can tank T2 raids with the correct gear, grouping and having players knowing what they are doing. If you still find yourself getting one shotted on your tank try getting some debuffing in your group such as a yellow LM or yellow Burg and also try a Rune keeper healer as they have many -X% incoming damage buffs and their bubbles will protect you from one shots."

lotro,3bcqmm,oscarboom,3,Sat Jun 27 23:55:07 2015 UTC,"That thread is from the test server, before it went live. I don't know of any numerical values that are actually lower than pre-imbuement; however . . .  There is a problem with a lot of legacies for a lot of classes. Some legacies are replaced upon imbuing with worse legacies.  For me, a guardian, the best example I have is the Major Weapon Legacy, Guardian Area Affect Melee Targets. At max rank, this legacy provides 5 extra targets to all of our damaging (not challenge, basically) AoE's. The legacy is replaced with Area Affect Damage, increasing the damage we deal with our AoE's. At max rank, this is about a 30% increase. This does not compare to the target legacy, which doubles the amount of targets we can attack (which is essentially a 100% damage increase), and is especially weaker when tanking because it limits the amount of targets we can generate threat on.  I'm really hoping they will update the legacies in an update, and soon. I think that imbuement should be strictly better. I shouldn't have to keep two weapons around depending on the situation."
lotro,3bcqmm,Mortichar,2,Sun Jun 28 01:02:12 2015 UTC,"That thread is from the test server, before it went live.   Thanks for pointing this out.   I imbued a throwaway and it does say that Rally at level 35 does go to -300 cooldown.   So it is not actually worse.  But still its not woth having to take things to level 35, using lots of empowerments and tons of experience runes, just to get back what I already started with on my 2 main legacies.   The break even point should be level 20 or 25, not max level."
lotro,3bcqmm,Mortichar,3,Sun Jun 28 02:32:58 2015 UTC,"This is part of the reason why people recommend maxing out your LI and having IXP runes sitting around before you imbue. It's a lot of work for imbued LI's, but it's meant as an ever-expanding end-game goal. It's meant to take you most of your level 100 career to max it out.  The only issue I really have with them is the fact that they're actually downgrades for some classes/traitlines.  Edit: also, are you sure it's 35 for -300? In my experience, the legacies are usually equal by at least their t6 conversion point (31?)."

lotro,3bb1kd,legofreak11,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:50:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but west gondor has the slotted armor that makes the instances even doable on t2."
lotro,3bb1kd,RJFerret,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:33:56 2015 UTC,"Do you know there's slotted gear available from the epic (three slotted jewelry), Pelargir Battle (single slot ring), and skirmish camps (two or three slots, I don't recall)?  Those filled with morale essences give another 7,000 morale or so without any Western Gondor gear.  Also, others who have Western Gondor and have done the grinding for those pieces can give them, or sell them to you, without you having to own the region.    PS: The instances might be easier with more morale, but are doable with less once the mechanics are known."
lotro,3bb1kd,legofreak11,2,Sun Jun 28 05:13:21 2015 UTC,"I did know about all of the cheap substitutes for the gear however they aren't nearly as good of an option. I guess I did ignore the option of buying the gear from someone else since all of my toons are poor lol.  It's not even about having tons of morale to do the new instances though,  essence gear is just 100% superior to non-essence gear unless that gear had a good set bonus."
lotro,3bb1kd,RJFerret,2,Sun Jun 28 05:26:41 2015 UTC,"Actually that's not true, non essence gear has higher main stats, essences have lower main stats but higher secondary stats.  Non-essence gear distributes stats, essence gear lets people gimp themselves.  You used to see people put nothing but physical mastery in their slots, and dying easily.  Now they replaced all those with morale, and don't have enough resistance or finesse, so the wound at the first boss of RC takes them out..  So if you want more of an individual secondary stat, you want an essence.  But it's possible to get more of everything from standard gear.  Optimal is a mix of standard and some essence pieces."
lotro,3bb1kd,legofreak11,3,Sun Jun 28 05:39:55 2015 UTC,I definitely agree that stacking one stat only is stupid. The people that build essence gear in the way you say are complete morons. It is entirely possible to keep your stats extremely well rounded through essences.
lotro,3bb1kd,RJFerret,2,Sun Jun 28 06:00:51 2015 UTC,"They aren't necessarily ""morons"", never mind complete, they might have specific reason for doing so, most of us have multiple sets of gear for different purposes.  Some of it might be completely stacked.  You don't even need different gear since you can re-slot essences instantly and reclaimation scrolls are essentially free at DA since stars of merit have no other use once geared.    That's the whole point of essence gear, but it does offer the liability mentioned earlier, which may be avoided with some traditional gear."
lotro,3b9vmq,cirion5,2,Sat Jun 27 04:22:48 2015 UTC,"A lot bought them but didn't keep playing them.  They were all over when they first came out.  They seem less popular than the other pay for classes.  I only played one through Bree content and did not find it particularly challenging/fun.  If you want to tank, go guard or cappy, if you want to heal, go mini or rk, if you want a wanna-be-cappy without the pet or complexity, but better dps, go beorn."
lotro,3b9vmq,RJFerret,2,Sat Jun 27 04:55:42 2015 UTC,I have to agree. Beorning was fun as a novelty but it doesn't really excel above other classes in their respective roles. I ended up capping mine and tried a bit of PvMP and Instance raiding on it. As far as PvMP goes it does really well solo and in small groups but haven't had much personal success in Raid v Raids. For instance raids it wasn't very fun to use.

lotro,3b8uhu,SubjectsZero,6,Fri Jun 26 22:25:26 2015 UTC,"Spec matters, burgs are also not one of the easier classes, they have really high dps, but you have to know which skills to use when and have legacies to support them.  Most don't maximize their burg's capabilities.  There was a time they were weaker compared to the op they used to be, which was complained about as low dps despite having some of the highest in the game.  In regards to pvp, which isn't my focus, burgs also have a lot of survival skills."
lotro,3b8uhu,RJFerret,2,Sat Jun 27 05:00:01 2015 UTC,"When you're first starting off in the Ettenmoors you will feel really underpowered compared to the people you are fighting against and with, because you're first starting out. As you gain rank and earn more Audacity gear as well as figure out your rotations you will eventually learn the best rotations for your play style and become more proficient with the class.   To answer your question though burglars have great burst dps and pretty decent sustained dps. Burglar dps doesn't really`noticeably  pick up until you hit Moria (around level 50), but if you stick with it until cap you'll have a really fun time in the Ettenmoors."
lotro,3b8uhu,MotherlyBear,2,Sat Jun 27 05:32:09 2015 UTC,Burglars have no AoE and not really comparable single target damage. Their only use is unfortunatly as a stacking debuffer on top of a loremaster for certain bosses (e.g. balrog and ivar t2 cm)
lotro,3b8uhu,Tywien,2,Sat Jun 27 07:09:31 2015 UTC,"Hasn't that always been the case, though?  Though burgs had decent dps if spec'ed properly, they were always predominantly a debuff / control class - the melee version of an LM.  Think the difficulty with burgs in this game has always been one of incorrect expectation - people always came to the game expecting them to be WoW rogues, which they were just never designed to be.  As to the moors, unless this has changed recently, burgs have always been very strong, (once you've done what /u/MotherlyBear suggests).  Focus on good use of your control and debuff skills and you'll do very well. :)"
lotro,3b8uhu,Zaraia,1 point,Sat Jun 27 14:36:11 2015 UTC,Burgs used to do incredible damage 60-65 and werent half bad at 50. I missed 75 but 85 they were near useless and only with the trait points are they somewhat okay now. The big issue is they are squishy melee dps and can't stay near many bosses long enough to actually do enouvh damage.
lotro,3b8uhu,Collegenoob,2,Mon Jun 29 17:40:23 2015 UTC,"If it matters my level 30 burglar has very, very low DPS no matter what spec. I also know that most people I know dislike Burglar's damage"
lotro,3b8uhu,Louey7,4,Sat Jun 27 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"Burglars have high burst damage for about 3 seconds, but it falls off really fast and is probably the lowest dps of the main ""dps classes""."
lotro,3b8uhu,legofreak11,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:00:24 2015 UTC,My burglar while leveling is. Tried PvP but scaling seems underpowered in general so IDK if it was that I was scaled or that burgs are bad (worse experience than my LM still)
lotro,3b8uhu,32F0C237K,2,Sat Jun 27 11:35:44 2015 UTC,"Scaling is horrible. Known issue.  Your ratings will be much lower than an actual 100's, the dps/tact damage on your weapons will be about half of what it would be at 100, and you lack most of your traits."
lotro,3b90ws,Atomiccupqwake,4,Fri Jun 26 23:21:50 2015 UTC,Only if your game stop is really out of date on their inventory.
lotro,3b8lnx,phargle,4,Fri Jun 26 21:13:28 2015 UTC,"You could try:  Making new characters that you only play in fellowships (you'll want one of the busier servers for this). Making different races than you usually play and doing quests in out of the way places. Role play -- not seriously like everything you say, but pick and choose which quests would be acceptable based on your race/class/character. Be a completionist -- don't leave an area until you've finished its meta-deed; this is much easier at low levels, of course. Or don't leave an area until you've found and defeated every named mob."
lotro,3b8lnx,MillianaT,2,Sat Jun 27 13:15:55 2015 UTC,"^ All of this, plus shoot for titles.  Take a look here - https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Titles and start on the deeds to collect the ones that fit best for how each of you see your characters.  Can get fairly grindy, but I always found it a lot of fun. :)  Another thing - if the two of you haven't yet done much with the music system, would highly recommend.  Was always one of my favorite parts of the game.  Used to love finding songs that fit the feel of variant zones in the game and then playing them there, (used to take screenies / fraps them, etc). :)"
lotro,3b8lnx,Zaraia,2,Sat Jun 27 14:46:29 2015 UTC,"Go back to your levelled up characters and develop them so you can do the new t2 instances, then do them.  That said, I loved sneaking past things on my burg, but can't complete slayer deeds that way, or the new kill things while you are there style of quests."
lotro,3b7wcy,sgrams04,3,Fri Jun 26 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"I solved the problem. Instead of opening the game up in Steam, go to the steamapps\common folder and run TurbineLauncher.exe. You'll essentially run the game outside of Steam, and therefore access the LOTRO store minus Steam purchase."
lotro,3b7wcy,Assofdeath,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:53:19 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem.  I wanted to buy 600 TP, but got that same error.  Luckily the expansion packs were on sale for a couple dollars more which gave me 1000TP.  It worked out for me.  But last I heard, they're upgrading something on Turbines end and, of course, glitches have to be worked out.  Not sure how much longer but as far as I know it's been about a week now."
lotro,3b1x79,Prince-Cola,4,Thu Jun 25 08:37:55 2015 UTC,"One Con is that you may not be able to launch multiple clients, not big deal if you are not a multiple account holder like I am."
lotro,3b1x79,ThomasTyndan,3,Thu Jun 25 16:29:57 2015 UTC,Works fine downloading through Steam.   Only issue is the lotro shortcut you can add to the desktop through your steam library had no image so it shows up as the default windows white paper icon. But you can go into the steamapps folder for lotro and make a shortcut directly to the lotro launcher.
lotro,3b1x79,ajskuce,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:36:52 2015 UTC,"You can also change the icon to the one of the lotrolauncher instead of having to create a new shortcut, but honestly it doesn't really matter."
lotro,3b1x79,UrrimHS,2,Thu Jun 25 19:57:18 2015 UTC,"I have it via steam, had some difficulties buying points in the store, but the support team helped me out and I had what I needed within 3 days."
lotro,3b1x79,Emyks,2,Thu Jun 25 09:08:39 2015 UTC,"Can't think of too many pros.  Tracking your amount of game time by Steam.  That said, it works just fine for me."
lotro,3b1x79,nerdz0r,3,Thu Jun 25 14:37:21 2015 UTC,You also have a command in lotro that shows you how many hours/days/months you played.
lotro,3b1x79,Norgaldir,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:11:58 2015 UTC,"While in intrigued by this command, I shudder to think of the amount of time invested in the game."
lotro,3b1x79,ceeller,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:11:29 2015 UTC,"I have like 400 hours logged on Steam, and I started playing before LOTRO was even available there. XD  My /played is probably close to a month."
lotro,3b1x79,tobascodagama,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:57:48 2015 UTC,"Just type /played in the chat box.  Wear it proudly as a badge, it's an accomplishment not something to be ashamed of."
lotro,3b1x79,7h3C47,2,Fri Jun 26 11:18:00 2015 UTC,"The only problem I have with downloading via Steam is that you get the whole Steam Overlay as well. And as the keybind for that is the same as the standard ""Target Previous Mob"" from pretty much every other game out there, it sucks when you automatically hit SHIFT+TAB to switch mobs and wind up with a big face of Steam instead. But it's an easy thing to just set your link to go directly to the .exe file instead of the steamapp: command.   One benefit is that the download tends to go a bit faster through Steam rather than the Turbine installer. Plus you automatically get the HD textures as well."
lotro,3b1x79,porpoiseoflife,2,Thu Jun 25 21:38:51 2015 UTC,"You can disable the overlay on a game-by-game basis, actually. Right-click LOTRO in Steam, select Properties. It's somewhere in that dialog box.  I find the Steam download to be a little bit faster and more reliable than Turbine's launcher, as well. Though I originally switched to using Steam back when LOTRO still used Pando, so that situation might be different now."
lotro,3b1x79,tobascodagama,2,Fri Jun 26 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"I personally think all games that require a client to login, should always be just installed from the makers themselves. Too many problems may occur. For example, the game PoE, always downloads slower than the actual client for updates. FFXIV people were in a panic when they couldn't preorder the game days before early access was suppose to start. If you purchased ffxiv on steam, you were forced to get the expansion on steam."
lotro,3b1x79,pouou,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:35:07 2015 UTC,"I play through steam and I find it better because my friends can see me in-game and chat with me. It also tracks your playtime which I guess is kind of cool.  There's also the benefit that you can buy TP from your wallet, which is great if you trade on the market and get some free cash to spend."
lotro,3b1x79,wanderer06,1 point,Fri Jun 26 12:48:34 2015 UTC,I can't buy Turbine Points through the LOTRO store when playing with the Steam downloaded version.
lotro,3b1x79,sgrams04,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:21:25 2015 UTC,"The only benefit to playing LOTRO through Steam is the Steam Overlay.   The download itself is identical. When you download from Steam, the client is placed in a different location than when you download it from LOTRO.com  LOTRO is completely self contained. There is no independent DLC as Steam calls it. Expansions and Updates are acquired in the normal Patch Process -- for EVERY client. You then activate them via a ""product key"" which is applied at myaccount.turbine.com.  Depending upon where you are physically located in the world, using the Steam Network, or the Akamai Network (which is used by the lotro.com download) may prove to be different. However, when the download completes -- there is zero difference (except the Steam Overlay) between game-play between the two."
lotro,3b1x79,Whmagill,0,Fri Jun 26 14:43:13 2015 UTC,Just a guess that it will make getting to the file folders a little more tricky if you're poking around with plugins.
lotro,3b24d3,TheGirthyMan,3,Thu Jun 25 10:24:49 2015 UTC,"It depends where you are and what taxes your government institutes, I believe VAT was in play for some Euro folks years ago.    It is recurring, so be sure to cancel before the month is up, put it on your calendar so you won't forget."
lotro,3b24d3,RJFerret,2,Thu Jun 25 13:25:18 2015 UTC,"Sales tax collection is up to the individual jurisdiction. I don't believe that Turbine collects it for any, but I haven't purchased anything for quite a while  - Lifetime membership. :)"

lotro,3azrc4,imawin,2,Thu Jun 25 14:43:05 2015 UTC,"Pretty much guaranteed it will be late October early November (i.e. the end of Fall), it's how it's almost always been done in the past."
lotro,3azrc4,legofreak11,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:27:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they've been following the pattern of releasing two big updates per year (Spring and Fall) for as long as I can remember."
lotro,3azrc4,imawin,3,Thu Jun 25 17:35:49 2015 UTC,This will include the new PvMP zone   They needed to do this when PvP was still active. People have been wanting this since Moria release.
lotro,3azrc4,legofreak11,2,Wed Jun 24 21:59:22 2015 UTC,The zone that was always promised as the new PvMP zone has always been Osgiliath. We are just now getting to Osgiliath. Now is the right time to do it. Why make a PvMP map for a zone we wouldn't get to for 6 years?
lotro,3azrc4,imawin,6,Wed Jun 24 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"I've never seen anything about Osgiliath being promised for 6 years. Maybe they said something within the last 2-3 years and I missed it because I have been off/on playing. People have been asking since MoM expansion for a new pvp zone, the only official response Turbine gave was that a new zone is not in the plans and that pvp is not a priority in this game. PvP wouldn't be dead on majority of the servers if they released a new pvp zone 6 years ago (and maybe another one or two since)."
lotro,3azrc4,legofreak11,-1,Wed Jun 24 22:30:27 2015 UTC,"Everytime I saw anybody say anything about a possible new zone, osgiliath was always suggested by the players."

lotro,3azrc4,chalk46,-1,Wed Jun 24 23:21:33 2015 UTC,"No kidding. It's too little too late, and a new map won't be enough to bring me back at this point."
lotro,3azrc4,ThomasTyndan,3,Thu Jun 25 02:54:49 2015 UTC,As a runekeeper.....how the hell are we gonna have a cosmetic weapon? The only thing I can think of is some animation that floats around your arms. Or something like that.
lotro,3azrc4,Rom709,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:02:43 2015 UTC,"Well, since it's cosmetic, I think you'd be able to look like you're holding something other than a runestone.  Traditional rules for cosmetic items would probably still apply, though.  In other words no warden javelins or hunter bows etc.."

lotro,3azrc4,nerdz0r,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:28:54 2015 UTC,I would really like to just have a sword or hammer for my Runekeeper to carry. Maybe a big honking 2hander.

That's part of being on a large server. I went to Firefoot and rolled a toon to claim my old name. It's easier to deed there but it's a lot less people there."
lotro,3b0yo2,majorlagg1,2,Thu Jun 25 13:59:27 2015 UTC,"I'm on Firefoot, feels like playing a Singleplayer game at times. Kinda nice, but I miss it being more full."

lotro,3b0yo2,LonelyMountainBand,2,Thu Jun 25 08:03:22 2015 UTC,Pick one of the more populated servers and you won't have too many complaints about activity or opportunities to group. Last I heard there are 85k people who play the game as of March.

lotro,3b0yo2,hueresiech,5,Thu Jun 25 15:11:52 2015 UTC,"I think the honest answer is that on lots of lower population servers, the game is dead according to any reasonable standards we ever would have used before.  There are still people playing on those servers, just hardly any by comparison with what there used to be.  Once large thriving communities have faded away, leaving a few stragglers.  The salvation is to either play on a populated server, or wait for server consolidation and free transfers, which is coming fairly soon."

lotro,3awyn3,RJFerret,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:19:50 2015 UTC,"You don't mention what class you are but be aware some don't want to Imbue, as it's a detriment to those classes.  Some dps classes benefit, but check what legacies are lost beforehand."
lotro,3awyn3,FG28,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:03:27 2015 UTC,"Well that begs the question then, I'm a guardian, should I imbue?"
lotro,3awyn3,exploderator,2,Wed Jun 24 11:37:32 2015 UTC,"My main is a guard. Short answer: No. Now let me explain that answer. If you imbue your tanking weapon you loose the AOE targets legacy. They changed the base number to be higher, I don't believe you will have as many targets as pre-imbuement. Since DPS = aggro, I don't want to loose any targets. They may not come into play often, but go do a 12 man skirm, get a hunter to make a bad shot and you got a lot more than 5 targets on your hands fast. As for the belt, similar problem, you loose the challenge target legacy. Again they increased the targets, but from reading, I don't believe you will have as many as pre-imbuement. You may not need them often, but when you do it can be the difference between a wipe and saving the situation. There are some other changes as well so you would do well to check each legacy to see what the process of imbuement will give you. What does the legacy become and how high is the new cap for the legacies damage or other effect. Once you know it is worth it to you, go ahead. I just find a few legacies that I don't want to do without so right now, I don't feel it's worth it for me. Now as far as I can tell, the legacies I use on my DPS weapon should be just fine to imbue. I am going to look over my DPS weapon tonight and probably imbue it. The extra DPS will help and I don't care about targets when I am soloing."
lotro,3awyn3,exploderator,3,Wed Jun 24 20:01:19 2015 UTC,"tl;dr  buy compendiums from skirm camp to craft relics to refine into shards  You will notice that in the legendary items system, at the relic master's, you can meld various special relics.  Doing so requires shards, sometimes lots of shards.  You can get lots of shards by refining relics into shards, but you only want to do that with relics you don't need.  The best way is to craft all your crafted relics, especially the ones that need the compendiums to make, and especially the one that needs a compendium vol. 5.  The best way to get compendium 5 is buying them with marks and medallions, since there is no resource quest that rewards them directly (and they cost way too many Fangorn leaves to bother with).  So, you craft your fancy relics, and then refine them into shards.  The top relic gives you almost 1000 shards per relic, and you will get over 2000 shards a week from refining all the crafted relics in total.  And since shards are account wide, you can do that with all your crafting alts above level 50, and even if they aren't level 50, some of the relics are not bound, so you can give them to your main to refine."

There's also essence armor at the skirmish camp guys starting at level 95, but again, not worth it as gear drops from level 100 instances will be better stats (teal 100s blow away 95 essence purples).  Once 100, do tons of Battles to get FA symbols and essences as well as essence ring (two flavors).  I'd just vendor trash lower level essences.    Note the may expand the system to more lower levels in the future."

That set has a stat and 4 slots. There is a 5 slot, no stat version, but you need the barter tokens from the 3 new instances in Osgiliath. The tokens only drop in T2C version."
lotro,3as6qz,FG28,3,Tue Jun 23 02:22:04 2015 UTC,"Essence armour is not worth it until you get the 4-slot stuff from Dol Amroth.  You have to grind the daily quests there for almost a month to earn them, and then you have to struggle to get enough good essences that you need to make it worthwhile.  I waited a long time before I finally built a set, so that I could use decent quality essences.    The thing is, if you have good normal armour, you are good enough for a long time for most level 100 content, so it's not a panic.  The price for 4 slot essence armour is limited by gold Dol Amroth tokens, and you can only earn 3 each day.  You need a total of 80 gold Dol Amroth tokens for a full set of all 6 armour pieces (4 are 10 each, 2 are 20 each).  When you put essences in armour, you can't just upgrade each one as you get better essences.  You have to use an Essence Reclamation Scroll, and those are either rare or expensive.  So you really don't want to buy good essence armour and put in crappy minor essences, it would be a waste of the scroll needed to remove them, or else a waste of the armour piece, unless you grind those daily quests so much that you don't care any more.  BUT... you would be better to build your essence armour once, do it right, and then save your extra gold tokens for buying scrolls of empowerment for your legendary weapon, which need 10 gold DA tokens each.  Final thought, I have seen plenty of people building their armour set as they go.  I waited until I could do the whole thing at once, but that's in large part because I was being lazy, and I didn't want to learn much about what I needed until I was ready to do the whole thing all at once.  I also didn't want to upset the good balance of my conventional armour.  So I figured out that I wanted tons of physical mastery essences for hunter, and saved up, and then did all my research and calculations to build an entire set with exactly what I wanted.  I have had enough gold DA tokens to build a new piece since then, and I might build one more piece again, basically so I can swap from huge physical mastery, to having better morale and mitigations, because in raids, a dead hunter has ZERO damage, no matter how hot your stats are."
lotro,3as6qz,exploderator,2,Tue Jun 23 07:02:21 2015 UTC,"I've been out for a bit, but didn't someone say they enabled all 6 quests at each training instance? So now you can get 6 gold coins a day. Or did I misread that in the patch notes?"

lotro,3as6qz,walker2011,2,Tue Jun 23 20:02:57 2015 UTC,"Well... I gotta ask now, how do you get the gold coins form the dailies or is it just a chance to get all 7? After 3 days of the 6 dailies I haven't gotten any gold, but have other reputation tokens as well as silver."
lotro,3as6qz,Louey7,2,Wed Jun 24 00:46:14 2015 UTC,"The gold tokens definitely come from the training exercise retaking Dol Amroth instance.  The one where you blink in, then start by choosing which faction you want to help, and that gives you some quests fighting corsairs in the corresponding part of the city.  All the other DA dailies are open landscape stuff, that does not give the gold tokens, just lots of boxes that give lots of silver DA tokens or faction-specific tokens."
lotro,3as6qz,exploderator,2,Wed Jun 24 09:19:30 2015 UTC,By the fountain there's a guy name starts with a B I think. He has a training instance. You click travel and you wind up in a field outside dol amroth with representatives from each of the factions. Until you get enough rep for the other factions you'll have to talk to the library guy and accept his quests. Talk to the main guy in the field again to start. Run through the main entrance of DA and you'll start to find mobs in the city. There's 3 or 4 exterior quests and a few inside the library. Should be seven in total. As you complete the quests you get boxes and 1 gold coin.

Since it is hard to get armor at that level (unless you have guilded crafter) its worth creating a 3 slot piece or 2 when you are 95 if you can find 3 good essences.  In general teal essence at level 95 is better than the purple/yellow essence at level 100.  But the level 100 4 slot armor is the main essence armor."

lotro,3anye5,catalyst4evr,8,Mon Jun 22 01:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'll tell you what I would rather see than more higher levels: a way to scale back down.  The problem I have is that leveling up burns the bridge behind you.  LOTRO is a great game, with so many fantastic instances, and so many amazing quest lines.  But there is a once-through effect that is a real shame, until you start a whole new alt.  They got part of the way there when they implemented scalable instances, and it helped open back up some good content.  But with the trait tree system and level-dependent loot already working, they should have a way to set your level back down, so you can play lower level content on its level, all of the questing, epics and instances, and get level appropriate awards, even if they are not the best paying.  All it would take is a general multiplying-down of a player's DPS and stats, so that we would be approximately as potent as if we were still on level.  It wouldn't matter if we retain our higher level skills, we still wouldn't be god-mode style like we are now, and would have to work for our fun again.  The thing is that doing this would re-invigorate usage of large parts of the game that are now empty save for the few people who happen to be leveling at any given time.  So much content going mostly to waste.  It would also make it very worthwhile for higher level players to join lower level players and help them, which is something the game could desperately use.  Leveling up should not burn the bridge behind us."
lotro,3anye5,exploderator,3,Mon Jun 22 06:57:31 2015 UTC,I would kill for the Moria and Lothlorien content to be relevant at levels higher than 60.  I keep my toons in Caras Galadhon and the 21st hall rather than DA or Osgiliath so that I can run around and explore and relive the glory days in between instances or while I'm waiting around for something to start up--but it'd be nice if there was an actual reason to be back there.
lotro,3anye5,7h3C47,2,Tue Jun 23 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"Ahhhhh the sweet sweet golden light of Lothlorien, how I do miss thee.  I've found myself plenty of times off in the woods there to find mithril flakes, not because I need a second hundred stack of them, but because I can't help but go back to enjoy the sheer beauty of the place.  And while I park myself in Aldburg these days, because I can scholar craft with the vault and AH both open, and step across the room the weapons forge, I would rather that were so in Caras Galadhon too.  It strikes me that it would be a worthy rearrangement at this stage of the game, for Turbine to stop being stingy with good full service hubs.  I can see how it once worked during the growth of the earlier parts of the game, but it doesn't make sense any more, it doesn't make the game better, nor help them sell any extra turbine points, to not streamline and complete the services available in many different places, and let the players choose where they prefer to hang out for main hubs.  And it would be essential if we hoped to see the game incorporate level down scaling too.  I can imagine groups of players who choose to stay in all kinds of places, because they like the content there, and there's no reason not to call any region home, when there are full services on hand."

I kinda wish they would add new options of exploration, such as an alternative for Moria, new start zones (Iron Hills for dwarves, Northern Mirkwood for elves, Laketown for men, etc) while also offering incentive for us high-levels to go there without rolling new alts.  I have 3 max levels in Guild Wars 2 and I make an effort to level up in a unique path each time - it makes it a lot more fun."

lotro,3anye5,ashr_raccoon,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:41:47 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I haven't played any other MMOs, so I never knew that about GW2, but I can see how neat that would be.  In the case of LOTRO, I don't mind that they have a progress flow across the map, because it makes sense for the story to follow the books to some extent.  I'll admit I also hesitate to think too big about LOTRO, I try to keep my suggestions within reach of what might actually be feasible on their very slim budget.  I can't really see Turbine doing most of the amazing things the game really begs for, if I let my imagination run free.  EG, there is so incredibly much space in the game, there could be about 5 times as much stuff going on in the same size map, but they left huge expanses relatively desolate, you just pass through the beautiful scenery and wonder why they didn't put at least some little surprise quest in the corner here and there.  EG, there should be a treasure hunt system, with very well hidden secret places and/or NPC's, with nice little prizes, that open up at random anywhere on the entire map, maybe a new one every 3 days or so, and it keeps people crawling all over everywhere to find them.  In the case of the level down-scaling, I do think it's feasible.  I hope it could be implemented as something really simple, without having to adjust all the earlier content, so that it wouldn't require an end-to-end overhaul, which has got to be a huge nightmare job no matter what.  You mostly just want it to implement general over rides, so that when your toon is down-scaled all quests within a few levels of your toon are considered open, and completing them pops a little rewards window, or gives generic tokens, even just marks would be OK.  And to keep it simple, you could treat it like a session, so you would pick a level to scale down, take up to 10 quests, and only get rewards if you complete them during the session at level.  Final detail is for NPC's that give several quests in order, they would always just start at the default beginning of their sequence of quests; you don't want the game to have to remember anything special outside the single scaled-down session you're playing, no special rules, etc., because it's already a huge job they do remembering all your regular quest completions and progress without it getting tangled with re-visits."
lotro,3anye5,exploderator,4,Wed Jun 24 19:14:10 2015 UTC,"I'll try to answer your question and give you my opinion on the level cap, coming from a player completely opposite to you. I hit level 95 within 24h of release and level my alts within a week IRL.   Now I'm not so sure if the level cap staying at 100 for a year was a good thing. Sure, it allowed me to >catch up, even at the slow pace at which I play... But now I'm also facing issues of whether it's worth it >to buy West Gondor just for the epic story and quests, knowing that I'll stay at 100 and have to level up >without more content to help me once Minas Tirith comes out. It's not worth it. Others might like it, but not me. That said, I'm interested on hearing everyone else's thoughts on the level cap. Where is it going? Do you >see an ""end game"" as far as the level cap is concerned? Should I be concentrating on something else? >Does Turbine need to rework previous expansions/quest packs to align them with a certain range of levels?   When and if level 105 ever comes, the new content released with it will be sufficient to do level 100 - 105. Buying and completing west, central or eastern Gondor right now will not harm your ability to level later on. Both central and eastern Gondor are ment as extra end-game content for players like you, who enjoy the storylines and like to take their time.   Now to touch on the level cap. I believe that with U16, turbine have hit the sweet spot. By not increasing the level cap they can adjust older content to balance it, they've been able to make it easier to get the 4-slot essence gear (takes 12 days now). This way old content is not obsolete, like it would have been with a level cap raise. Instead it's now a stepping stone for more casual players into the newer content (osgiliath instances). You can perfectly clear T2C with the old gear.  If they had increased the level cap with eastern Gondor we would've had to throw away all our 4-slot gear, our BB jewelry, our essences, etc. and the only gear available to us wouldve been the level 105 osgiliath stuff. We wouldve been gearing for the same stuff, but we wouldn't have DA available to us. Instanced would've had to be scaled and half of them would probably be imbalanced. BBs would have to be grinded again. All of that just so we can get 5 magical levels.  The point I'm trying to make here that levels are just a number and that level caps make old content obsolete. If U17 brings a level cap raise, our osgiliath gear will be obsolete. If instead, it releases a raid and perhaps a new set of jewelry to go alongside our osgiliath armor, we can use our old gear to get the new gear and take on these challenges.  Instead of levels, progression through gear, class trait points, virtues (god I hate those), new tiers of essences and imbued LI, all provide a way to progress within LOTRO without making old content obsolete and I therefore hope that we never get a level cap increase again."
lotro,3anye5,Dod4r,2,Mon Jun 22 07:00:07 2015 UTC,"Since I'm about to get off for the night, I'll do the fun question   Does Turbine need to rework previous expansions/quest packs to align them with a certain range of levels?   I would love this. In particularly if zones were revamped enough so that mounted combat is completely skippable to quest and level up.  While riding a war steed and speeding through everywhere can be fun, I find mounted combat to be too slow to level (on melee classes very difficult to do those quests on foot) and would like more alternatives that involve main questing. Now, how to do this would be tricky. I think instead of reworking old zones, or on top of reworking old zones (preferred method), they could have future expansions add little zones as alternatives for leveling. Many zones 50 and below have a few alternatives. Your starting zones 1-15, 15-20 is mostly bree, but 20-30 can be through a couple ways, 30-40 again has more than one way, 40-45 has I think 4, 45-50 has a few again. While these usually have main ones for certain levels, if you don't like a zone there are usually alternatives. While I enjoyed Lone-lands the one time I did it back 4 or so years ago, I prefer North Downs to get me to the upper 20s or low 30s. Having these type of alternatives for 65-100 would be great IMO. 58-60-65 area actually has 4 - Mirkwood, Enedwaith, Lothlorien, even part Moria still.  Okay, longer than I wanted. But yeah, more alternative zones for leveling, especially 50/60/65+"
lotro,3anye5,Louey7,2,Mon Jun 22 02:25:20 2015 UTC,"The primary answer is -- LOTRO has no end-game. At best we will not see ""it"" until 2016 - where ""it"" is Aragorn arriving at the Black Gate. 16.2 now entering Beta (Thursday 6/25) on Bullroarer will open the new PvMP area of Osgilliath.   Guesses are that we will enter Minias Tirth with Update 17 in the Fall. The next Big Battle area will be Pellanor Fields -- maybe by 2015 year end, maybe not until 2016.  Yes, the player community objected loudly and long to the proposal to raise the Level-cap to 105 when it was announced last year.  VyVyanne has been doing a yeoman job of ""cleaning-up"" a huge number of outstanding issues, including bugs in the game. However, there is still a HUGE number to go, not the lease of which is MTBF for the Mac Client. East Rohan especially is still problematic. West Rohan, lest so and Gondor's regions seem to have started out much cleaner.  Now that the PvMP crowd has been thrown a few crumbs, possibly even pacified, and the servers are about to be moved to decent data-communication centers with new hardware to combat the lag problems we may see Update 17 contain some crumbs for the Raiders.  All of which is to say -- the earliest possible ""excuse"" for raising the level-cap would occur sometime in 2016. I say excuse simply because there is no rational need for a cap increase.  Current game play beyond Lothlorian is extremely sparse. Players like to ""fly through"" level 50 (which they get to by buying a one-shot) to level 100 as fast as possible. Doing as few quests as possible just to get to level-cap. Those of us who do enjoy leveling our toons through Rohan and Gondor find that by the time we even get to Rohan, we are in our 80s -- well beyond the levels original 70s planned level.  I have a total of 15 characters on two Lifetime accounts -- and only 4 of them are at Level Cap, so I'm in no rush to see the level-cap increased beyond 100.  But then I haven't done PvMP since the level cap was 50 and getting to the Moors was a major accomplishment. Today, any twit can pay to play in the Moors -- so why bother, it is neither an accomplishment nor an ego boost to do so.  Maybe Turbine should just bring back Radiance Gear :)"

That said, there are skill points to be had from purchased quests.  Eastern Gondor feature three group instances and essence armor if you do T2 content.

lotro,3aiop6,Louey7,6,Sat Jun 20 15:51:20 2015 UTC,"Instead of typing everything over, here is DADI's most excellent and complete guide.  Quick points:   An empty legacy slot after imbuement (left over from a remembrance) is free to assign to whatever you want.  Same if you add a legacy slot after imbuement, you get to choose for free.  Not sure if you choose a stat legacy post-imbue, will it still start at T4, or maybe only T2???.  If only T2, better to get stat legacies before imbuement, and save two empowerment scrolls. Any legacy scrolls you extracted from weapons will not work on an imbued weapon.  If you are like me and many others, and already have a big pile of them, it is BY FAR the cheapest way to set up your legacies properly.  Otherwise you have to use the expensive/rare post-imbuement legacy replacement scrolls, or else pay in MC. The wisdom is therefore to try to set up all your legacies and build up as usual: level up to 30 to get all 6 legacies unlocked, add the remembrance to get #7, switch any legacies you need to using the legacies you extracted (remember some change after imbuement so choose with that in mind), add a delving to unlock 70, level up to 70 so you can empower as many legacies as possible before imbuing. If you want stat legacies, those scrolls can be melded very cheaply using shards, or maybe bought from skirmish camp.  The scroll gives you a T4 legacy right away.  Apply any of those you want BEFORE imbuement, it is way cheaper than using a post-imbuement legacy replacement scroll. One time you want to change legacies after imbuement is if you have a crap legacy, or it will become a crap legacy after imbuement, but it's already at T5-T6.  If you change the legacy before imbuement, it will be set back to T2, which costs you 3-4 empowerment scrolls to recover.  That is more expensive than a single post-imbuement legacy replacement scroll, which would retain the T5-T6 level."
lotro,3aiop6,exploderator,2,Sat Jun 20 20:10:35 2015 UTC,"That was actually really useful. Thanks very much and pretty much exactly what I was looking for. I thought I maxed it out beforehand, and didn't realize there was no way (other than mithril) to replace legacies post-imbuement.  I may see with the Mithril coins being sale in store if I could replace any I want (if any) on my weapon. Javelin is still 2nd age so not too worried about it"
lotro,3aiop6,exploderator,2,Sat Jun 20 22:27:05 2015 UTC,"You must have missed it, but the last few weeks there were good store sales with 20%-30% off some key things.  I got a few legacy replacement scrolls, and 3 five-stacks of empowerment scrolls, which were the best deal I've ever seen so far.  Outside those sales, the best way is to wait and buy Mithril Coins when they are on sale, and then buy the legacy replacement service directly with them, because you can save around 25% that way too.  You can do that right from the LI control panel, and pay directly in MC.  Final tip that rocks: there is no more major vs. minor legacies, so you can pick effectively 7 major legacies, if that's what you like best.  Cheers, and happy building :)"
lotro,3aiop6,exploderator,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:56:39 2015 UTC,"Yep I missed it. Thanks for the major and minor legacies tip. But to be honest, I forgot there was a difference until you mentioned it"
lotro,3aiop6,uglyfool,2,Mon Jun 22 02:14:47 2015 UTC,"Hey, I just noticed that all the things are on sale right now.  35% off mithril coins, 30% off legacy replacement and legacy tier upgrade scrolls, etc...  Good deals.  You didn't miss it after all, or else they just put it all back up for sale.  At 35% off mithril coins, it is 1300 TP for 250 of them.  To upgrade a legacy, it costs 29MC, which equates to 151TP at the above sale price.  It costs 175 TP per legacy upgrade scroll, if you buy them in 5 packs at 30% sale.  So it is a lot cheaper to buy tons of Mithril Coins right now.  That way you also get the great deal on anything else you spend them on, including replacing legacies on imbued weapons, etc.."
lotro,3aiop6,oscarboom,2,Wed Jun 24 07:36:13 2015 UTC,"Just a few things to add to this, first a scroll of delving will work on an imbued LI, with a few caveats.  A scroll of delving, used on an imbued LI @ level 60, will upgrade the max tier of every legacy by one; so effectively a single scroll of delving is the same as seven empowerment scrolls. The big caveat though, is that you can only use a scroll of delving on an imbued LI if you didn't use one before you imbue. And again, you can only use one delving scroll per LI.  Second, there are no major/minor legacy distinctions on imbued LI's, every LI can effectively be a 7-major LI if you want, with all legacies maxed.  So my checklist:   identify and level to 30 add remembrance crystal change any legacies that I really want, that I know won't cost me more than 1-2 scrolls in the end level to 60 add three starlit crystals if I have them imbue LI use delving scroll cry myself to sleep at the thought of needing ~40+ starlit crystals and insane numbers of empowerment scrolls across my 4 level 100 characters."

lotro,3age2c,outbound_flight,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:40:52 2015 UTC,"You're definitely good for a while. The next time you'll have to spend money on expansions is when you hit level 95 (for the Gondor packs), which, if you just started playing, is a ways off.  You could buy some stuff through the LotRO Store in-game if you want to streamline some things. For instance the Premium Wallet Upgrade is awesome if you have some Turbine Points left over. Your inventory space will thank you. xD  Also, there are things like the Beorning class, inventory space upgrades, bank space, etc. available there. None of it is stuff that you need right now, but more as-you-need-it type of things. The Premium Wallet is the one thing that I would say is close to essential, though.  As for VIP, you should definitely consider it. The gap between the F2P content (which will carry you to level 30) and the expansion content from the Quad Pack (at level 50) can be bridged with VIP, since it unlocks the quest packs you'll need to get to keep leveling. However, if you have extra Turbine Points (I seem to remember one of the expansions gives an allotment) the quest packs you'll need to buy are Evendim, Forochel, and Eregion, if I remember correctly. There's also the Mithril Edition of the game, which is a great deal.  Hope that helps!"
lotro,3agkb8,Huttles,6,Fri Jun 19 23:50:15 2015 UTC,"There is twice as much story now.  Level cap is nearly twice as high (100).  There is tons more questing, instances, and many minigames like mounted combat and Big Battles.  The game has been around for years, server merges are planned in several months.  That said, they have the license for another two years and plan to renew like usual.  So it's not a new game but there are still people starting it all the time.  The leveling up process has been made solo, with some optional group things if you level with others.  If you continue with your prior characters, you have all of Isengard to go through, Rohan and mounted stuff, Helm's Deep, Gondor...  It's free, might as well check it out and see if it tickles your fancy."
lotro,3agkb8,RJFerret,2,Sat Jun 20 00:38:13 2015 UTC,"First of all, this subreddit is probably not a good representation of the playerbase of LotRO, as it is not very heavily trafficked.  But to answer your question, the game is still quite popular. It has obviously declined in population over the years, but the devs are still producing content and there are constantly new players. There are only a few servers where the population decline is really noticeable, and that is why they are doing some server merges when they upgrade the server hardware later this year. They haven't shared specifics yet, but everyone will get free transfers to the server of their choice on all existing characters.  As far as what you have missed out on/what is new, I think /u/RJFerret summed it up pretty well."

You will be very, very glad. Nothing for you at max except rep grinds and buggy instances. The market on all servers just got flooded with exploited items that Turbine took forever to fix. PvP imbalanced to kingdom come.   Levelling isn't even fun anymore. Mounted Combat & Big Battles are the absolute opposite of fun and engaging. It's thrown in your face too, you simply can't avoid doing Big Battles (rewards are too good, dont know if this has changed with U16) and getting past mounted combat is tough without instance grinding. MC is plagued with horrible rubberbanding & some classes simply can't kill anything on horseback. Big Battles are just a goddamn chore to go through.  And yes, the population on many servers is indicative of a dead game. Brandywine is the only US server that can hold over 1000+ players consistently, rest are 300 or under with some exceptions such as Landroval.

Then throw some masteries inside (for example, 1 +2/3 for Power attack, followed by 1/2 + 3/1 for Mighty throw for a quick elimination of opponent, or 3/2 + 3 + 2/3 for a quick desolation).

From a player perspective, there are two stages to this process:   Turbine upgrades their transfer tools so that formerly server-bound stuff can be moved when people move their characters. They also implement some tools that allow kinships to transfer between servers, which is currently impossible. Turbine announces a list of servers which will be shut down and the date they plan to turn out the lights on those servers.   Everybody will get free server transfer tokens that will allow them to move where they want to end up, rather than being forcibly merged. If you have a character on a server that gets shut down, you won't be able to log in to that character until you transfer them to one of the remaining servers."

lotro,39xfgh,MillianaT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:02:31 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure.  Not a hunter because i got my run of that in WoW.   Not the lore master because that requires a whole lot of combo work and whatnot so maybe in the future.  Either Warden or Beorning basically.
lotro,39xfgh,MillianaT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:07:12 2015 UTC,"They're both primarily dps melee, although the warden has the ability to do ranged as well.  The beorning has wrath, which is similar to focus, something that has to be built up in combat.  Wardens are a bit more complicated, especially as they level and the number of possible gambits (which change when you change stances) increases.  I have only played a beorning up to around 55, but I have a 100 warden so understand it a bit better."
lotro,39xfgh,MillianaT,1 point,Mon Jun 15 17:12:26 2015 UTC,"How complicated exactly?  Do I have to use all of the gambits or can I run with the same 3-4 or whatever for a good number of levels?  Also, is there a healer spec for Warden?"
lotro,39xfgh,MillianaT,2,Mon Jun 15 17:17:29 2015 UTC,"Once you get the longer gambits, they become more powerful if you can use them in series (the two length, then the three length, then the 4 or 5 length of the same gambit series).  You not only need to remember which gambits to use in which situations, but what the series is if you want the most powerful versions.  That said, if you have halfway decent gear (casual, even), you can do your landscape quests just fine with a handful of gambits memorized.  Where it gets complicated is when you do t2/t3 skirmishes or epic battles or stuff where they expect you to be able to draw aggro and use a bunch of skills and gambits you didn't have to when you were soloing in the landscape.  The blue line has lifetaps, a self heal series, and a fellowship heal series.  Not insanely powerful, but enough to help in a pinch, especially if you have time to do the series.    You do get ""shortcut"" gambits, skills that combine two of the base gambit skills in a row.  You can build gambits faster that way, but they have higher cooldowns then the normal skills, so to build longer gambits you have to figure out how to combine them.  For example, the self heal shield spear shield spear shield, you can't use the skill that combines shield spear twice in a row because it will be on cooldown.  You can use the combination shield spear, then the shield skill itself, then the spear shield combination skill.  So, three keystrokes instead of 5."

lotro,39xfgh,MillianaT,2,Mon Jun 15 17:32:36 2015 UTC,"You do get time to learn as you level, and if you don't plan to PvMP or do much of the fellowship-level, challenging content, it's not a big deal.

You could choose to go to Archet, but you won't be able to do the epic prologue there, so most people don't (unless they have played enough they have a significant preference for a particular area).

lotro,39wzia,StoleYourFood,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:26:02 2015 UTC,I'm guessing it would be a very limited version of the game -- I'm trying to remember just how much was lost when Everquest tried a Console version. My minstrel has over 30 spells and abilities I use on a regular basis. It would be crazy to try and map all that to the 8-12 buttons you've got available on a console controller.
lotro,39wzia,dclary,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:48:43 2015 UTC,"Only if your console has a full keyboard.  Assuming that skills could be trimmed back and simplified (a huge maybe), the biggest and critical problem is chat, which is a core component of the game.  Even though a voice chat system helps, it cannot possibly substitute for all that text chat does in LOTRO.  Remember this is supposed to be an MMO, so communication is central.  One of the key things is that many people from all over the world can read and write English well enough to communicate, but many non-English speakers would be very uncomfortable about their accents, and even hard to understand.  It also greatly reduces any likelihood of people being teased over their ethnicity, because other players often don't even know.  Text has no accent.  EG, my kin leader is a really awesome guy from India (professional engineer), with an excellent and subtle grasp of English.  When I finally convinced him to get a microphone, he definitely has a fairly strong accent, to the point where it was hard to understand him because the sound input on his PC had a lot of noise, and the combination of strong accent with very poor sound quality pushed it past clarity.  Which was frustrating as hell, he's a really great guy, and I was embarrassed as shit, I really hated, having to tell him in any way at all that his accent contributed to making it hard to understand what he was saying.  I begged him to find a USB based microphone instead, but since then we've mostly stuck to text chat."

I am couple of times played this game but stopped when free quests end and now I am trying to farm deed points and I would love to get more in to the game. I really don't yet grasp what expansion pack means so bear with me. So, 1) My level is currently less than 30 so if I buy Quad Pack which has quests for levels 50-85 do I have any reason to buy that pack if I cannot play it yet? 2) Does that pack unlock main quests? 3)They are not open for me always (not only for 1 month?) 4) Buying this pack doesn't give me turbine points and it is not same as buying 1 month's subscription? 5) Should I rather buy Helm's Deep pack?

Helms Deep basic gives 1000, premium gives 2000, subscribing gives 500 a month.  4) It's really up to you.

It got hot enough to fry an egg on but still ran fine and the laptop lasted me 5 years (was my college laptop so even more wear from that)  Now I would recommend that when you do play for long periods of time that you have plenty of ventilation/air circulation around the laptop to help it stay cooler. I kept mine on an angled laptop stand with a small 4"" tabletop fan blowing across the bottom side."

lotro,39gw0b,ggburner420,2,Thu Jun 11 18:17:37 2015 UTC,Buy them all if possible now that you can.  If not a combination of the starter pack and quad pack. With that you have Evendim (best 30-40 region) and 500 tp to buy another (40-50) region with a bit of grinding. Then the 4pack gives you lvls 50-85 which is awesome. Helms Deep is not priority as by the time u reach 85 there 'll be another sale.

lotro,39iao5,kingofthebiscuits,5,Thu Jun 11 22:22:17 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend warden, when I started I was absolutely terrified of gambits, and expected myself to be a trash warden. Really the key is repetition, you acquire gambits slowly too so it never should be overwhelming having to memorize them. The warden class forum I found as a good place to learn tips about the class, here's a link: https://www.lotro.com/forums/forumdisplay.php?311-Wardens&styleid=9."
lotro,39iao5,ObsessedWithHobbits,4,Thu Jun 11 23:33:37 2015 UTC,Why not play with a burg? They are a decent solo class and being able to stealth through content is hugly convenient.
lotro,39iao5,Collegenoob,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:46:06 2015 UTC,"I have tried one, but the stealthy thing just doesn't fit me. After playing a guard, and basically just throwing myself at the mobs everytime instead of trying to avoid them. When I tried to play a hunter I'd start melee without even realising it... it's no wonder it didn't work for me. Of couse burgs aren't a ranged class, not like hunter, but it still lacks that ""vanguard"" feel that guard, champ and warden have."
lotro,39iao5,legofreak11,3,Fri Jun 12 13:59:01 2015 UTC,"Just make a warden, gambits are not as scary as you think they are, and you already said yourself that you'd have fun as one."
lotro,39iao5,WelCZa,3,Fri Jun 12 03:31:32 2015 UTC,"First: Do not be terrified by warden gambits, because you will learn them doing your class deeds (IIRC all of warden class deeds (or at least most of 'em) are done by repeating gambits). Second: Most of gambits are ""chained"". That means, that gambits 12, 123, 1234 (please do some research about that numbers of you don't know what thay mean as i am after my night shift and getting ready to sleep) have similar effects, but the longer ones are stronger (this is very, very simplified, but works kinda like that).  Third: I think that wardens are quick enough to level up. I had fun playing my warden so much, that i didn't even realize, that it took me year to lvl him to level ~80 (played only hour or two a week).  P.S.: try site called ""tentonhammer"""

If you think you will play to max level I would save all the TP you can for lvl 100. Only things you may want to invest in are more bag space and more vault storage. they are pretty handy. Focus on learning your class and leveling your crafting skills.   Don't bother buying legendary items of the AH till you are max level, you will loot more than you can use and they will become obsolete every 5 levels or so.  Go with quest reward armor and jewelry unless you can get crafted for super cheap, you will out level most tings very fast just like the LIs. The reputation barter items are also good if you are in an area long enough to get the rep and the barter items."

Saving your TP for the lvl 100 LI imbueing system can save you a ton of grinding time/gold. Also for the essence armor system since one of the requirements for crafting essences is a store item (also a drops in world but super rare)  That said, if maxing ouit your character at lvl 100 is not a priority and you are more interested in RP/story/casual fun play you can spend your points on w/e you want from the store that enhances your play time."

lotro,39gswt,FlieGerFaUstMe262,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:58:31 2015 UTC,Is the Beorn class worth doing all that again within 3 days of doing it as a Captain..? I can't seem to find a real review of it.
lotro,39gswt,FlieGerFaUstMe262,2,Thu Jun 11 16:59:49 2015 UTC,"Wait no... no village battle... that is the intro for Men and Hobbits. The Beorning intro is what you will do. After that you will spawn in a burned Archet, after the battle, the Archet that is in the open game world.  I always have to recommend against making a Beorning. They don't belong in the game. If you have a problem with doing the same thing again, I also recommend against making any new characters until you are ready to repeat content."
lotro,39gswt,FlieGerFaUstMe262,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:03:16 2015 UTC,Why do you feel they don't belong? Is it just because Beorn was the last of them and they're basically extinct in some way or what?
lotro,39gswt,Eightlegged,2,Thu Jun 11 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"No Beorn had descendents and there were other men living among them called Beornings, but they don't leave the vale. This game has bear people running all around Middle-earth."

lotro,39f2ml,serow081reddit,4,Thu Jun 11 08:22:09 2015 UTC,"First off, congrats on getting into roleplay. I came to LOTRO to get a break from RP so I'm not on one of the RP servers, but I haven't really gotten the impression real roleplay happens on RP servers anyhow.  If you really get into the RP I can recommend other Tolkien-like games that might prove more fulfilling (not posting here since this is a LOTRO sub). To get the most out of roleplay, you need GMs that are actively participating in the stories you weave and game developers willing and able to shape the world around you based on the choices you take. LOTRO doesn't provide for either of these so the dimensionality of the characters you play and meet cannot be truly explored.  Please don't let that deter you though. If you love LOTR and are interested in exploring roleplay, that's great. I'm curious to hear from LOTRO RP'ers about their experiences. Anything that introduces people to RP is good in my book.  Good luck! :)"
lotro,39f2ml,Kamen_Winterwine,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:16:50 2015 UTC,"I guess lotro is pretty much the only game  possible for role playing tolkien- wise. But as you said, i will try it out with other games too! And i am playing in a rp server right now, and it is actually going better than i ever expected. Events are the coolest!"
lotro,39f2ml,naliao,3,Fri Jun 12 12:39:33 2015 UTC,"I play on one just because the experiance is better. Even if you dont rp youll like it. People are usually in charecter even out questing, so you never know when it may happen. Its great"
lotro,39f1ni,Leftys-Wheelchair,4,Thu Jun 11 07:57:22 2015 UTC,"Ered Luin is the elf/dwarf starter area, you probably overleveled it already. You can visit it if you want to explore/see the story/farm deeds, but other than that it doesn't offer anything to you at your level.    If you don't know where North Downs is (hint: to the north) that means you still have plenty of quests to do west of Bree, so don't worry. There is also the Lone Lands area to the east that is free and can easily take you to 30. The efficient think to do then would be to buy Evendim to level 30-40.    Also, there is no need to buy anything early, wait until you need it so you might get a sale."
lotro,39f1ni,mrmgl,2,Thu Jun 11 08:30:42 2015 UTC,"Bree could get you to 22-25 if you do all of it (more even with exp boosts, like the pocket items or Shield of Hammerhand). But after that, you get Lone Lands for free actually and definitely want to do before North Downs. That would get you to low 30s if you did it all. At that point, I'd skip North Downs as a whole (as F2P) and get Evendim instead.  Ered Luin is a low level place. If you need the turbine points/deeds and want to explore new areas, you could do it. It is the elf/Dwarf equivalent of your human starting areas (to 15+ usually)"
lotro,39f1ni,Louey7,2,Thu Jun 11 10:38:25 2015 UTC,"If you get the North Downs you don't need to do the Lonelands at all (except for story quests if you're doing those). I think the Trestlebridge quests are around level 20, and the area takes you to about 30. At 30 you can go to Evendim."
lotro,3996j5,legofreak11,3,Wed Jun 10 04:00:23 2015 UTC,"This is quite good. Especially the last line. I've seen wardens with near perfect gear being way too slow with their gambits. Speed and prediction is essential.  Also, if you want to really master the class, take every guide with a bit of salt. Figure out these things by yourself, so you understand the reasons and the alternatives."
lotro,3996j5,lench4991,1 point,Wed Jun 10 11:54:53 2015 UTC,"Definitely, thats why I tried to keep it as vague as possible so people would have room to work it to their own style."
lotro,3996j5,Fluffcake,2,Wed Jun 10 12:18:05 2015 UTC,"The only thing Im missing here, is brink in victory (313) which is an excellent skill to use when initiating aoe pulls due to big radius and high target count and faster than DC, it also generates a fair bit of threat which helps when you have triggerhappy aoe dps'ers. Otherwise I agreed to most of it, and even learned something new :)"
lotro,3996j5,Fluffcake,2,Wed Jun 10 12:07:34 2015 UTC,"The conviction I use as I pull usually gives me enough threat that I never have to worry about aggro. Plus since the heal is the main threat component, it has infinite targets as far as threat is concerned."
lotro,399qps,lostmyparachute,2,Wed Jun 10 07:20:59 2015 UTC,"I had a similar issue like this aswell.  When you open the launcher, go to the options screen and press the 'restore defaults' option. After you've done that, go to the repair tab and there you'll a button 'reset the game display setttings' press it and try to launch the game again. That's how I fixed it, hope it works for you aswell."

lotro,396zgl,Iluminatos13,8,Tue Jun 9 18:31:05 2015 UTC,"Personally, I like that the skills now come instantly. If I'm out questing in the middle of nowhere, I don't want to have to run all the way back to the city (or nearest town with a trainer) to learn a new skill. It takes so much unnecessary time to do so, especially if you are rather far from any cities and there aren't any direct swift travel options available."
lotro,396zgl,thatg33kgirl,1 point,Wed Jun 10 01:05:37 2015 UTC,But this (along with having less skills anyway) was one of the things that made this game more difficult.  And now it is a sandbox.  Anyhow this has been discussed before...

lotro,396zgl,legofreak11,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yes the excellent lore is the main reason I love this game.  As for the difficulty I want it for the challenge, also it seemed to me that it made Middle Earth more vivid, like as dangerous as it is described.  Anyway each to his own as you said :)"

lotro,394ppf,Seadevill,6,Tue Jun 9 06:19:58 2015 UTC,"I would definitely go with explorer. With Beorning it also gets another benefit.  First, Explorer is always a good choice so you can gather up materials (prospecting and foresting). If you needed something and knew a crafter, you could always ask them to craft something and you just give them the mats and maybe some money.  As a Beorning you wear medium armour. Explorer comes with Tailor which can make medium (and light) armour. Perfect for your Beorning again!"
lotro,394ppf,Louey7,5,Tue Jun 9 11:40:53 2015 UTC,"I would highly recommend Explorer for your first character, especially a light / medium armour class (such as a Beorning).  I find Tailor easier to level than Jeweller; you can craft decent armour for yourself and you can collect wood, ore and jewels to store up for any subsequent characters to use in different professions."
lotro,394ppf,Backahast,3,Tue Jun 9 08:43:15 2015 UTC,"For gathering materials: explorer is unmatched, which is quite useful for getting a headstart on crafting for eventual other toons you roll, also small bonus for crafting armor for leveling. Another Bear-option is Woodworker, as you can make clubs and class items, and eventually LIs. Tinker and historian are my favourites tho, but I mostly do endgame things and consumables are my favourite drug, and those are unmatched when it comes to making those. tinker has the added bonus of making jewlery for leveling."
lotro,394ppf,Fluffcake,2,Tue Jun 9 11:05:41 2015 UTC,"Beorning legendaries are crafted by weaponsmiths and woodworkers.  My primary is an explorer, and my second was an historian, so I can harvest anything, anywhere (yay).  It is most helpful if you plan to have alts for crafting to start with explorer, but if not, go with most useful.  I find scholar and cook what I use most often, the rest of the crafted stuff is period and non-consumable, so it's easier to find someone to make it as you're not asking for it all the time."
lotro,394ppf,MillianaT,0,Tue Jun 9 19:07:03 2015 UTC,"Which craft makes Beorn legendary items?  Explorer is only useful if you have lots of alts.  If you ask anyone to make something for you, they'll never need mats as we are all overloaded.  The game also gives decent armor, although lacking for Beorn initially, they've since resolved that, and end game armor drops are far better than crafted.  Armor also takes a ton of resources to craft, I don't know anyone who bothers."
lotro,3911m3,confusedThespian,14,Mon Jun 8 13:49:40 2015 UTC,"I am kind of amazed how many general tweaks are happening these days.  All kinds of little things nobody expected, nice polish on the game, and the kind of attention to detail the game seemed to be not getting for a long time.  It's like someone finally got out of the way of the programmers."
lotro,3911m3,exploderator,7,Mon Jun 8 15:04:39 2015 UTC,Yep. This is what the game has needed for years. Bug-fixes and polish. Now if we could just get dynamic levelling and loot it would open up hundreds of hours of gameplay.
lotro,3911m3,CaesarBritannicus,2,Mon Jun 8 16:39:40 2015 UTC,dynamic levelling and loot   Did we have that discussion before?  I've long been a passionate advocate for toons to be able to scale down levels and play lower level content.  It would also have significantly alleviated the issue of low population servers leaving new players all lonely.  Leveling up should not be burning the bridge behind us.
lotro,3911m3,exploderator,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:37:14 2015 UTC,"I've played on and off over the years and haven't really paid close attention to patch notes, dev diaries, etc. Is this something that has ever been discussed by the devs in the past? I plan on getting the annual VIP if they put it on sale this summer and would love it if this was a feature they were planning to add."
lotro,3911m3,b1k3r4ck,2,Mon Jun 8 21:39:14 2015 UTC,"It has never been discussed, as far as I know. The amount of work for it (with potential consequences for deeds) may be insurmountable."
lotro,3911m3,CaesarBritannicus,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:40:29 2015 UTC,"I think you're correct on all that.  I think it would be relatively easy now, because we have scaling mechanisms in place for the instances, and the principles could fairly easily be applied to down-scaling.  That has only fairly recently become the case though, with the trait tree mechanism, and if there was a right time to have made the change, it would have been years ago.  I think it never even got considered due to technical impossibility, back while it would have been relevant.  I think the real devil that remains is in details like working out and applying the logic of what quests and rewards might become available to scaled down players, and how to deal with a departure from the normal sequential nature of quest completion, which is a messy and pervasive kind of thing with so many quests behind us."
lotro,3911m3,exploderator,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's been discussed multiple times and is not on the drawing board.

Loremaster: Armour Debuff Potency should now properly display and increase the debuff of Ancient Craft. The Lore-master traits Enfeeble and Force of Will can now both affect Ancient Craft at the same time. Lore-masters with both the Enfeeble and Force of Will traits will now have the correct duration on their Ancient Craft skill. Burglar: Fixed issue with Dust in The Eye Miss Chance legacy not properly increasing the potency of the debuff. Minstrel: Minstrels with the Harmonious Anthems trait will now consume their anthems when using a coda. Minstrels can no longer use Harmonious Anthems to stack three anthems per Minstrel for the whole group. Non-Harmonious Anthems Minstrel anthems still stack with each other. Items: The Spring Festival vendors now have their new rewards for 2015. Items - Star-lit Crystals' max stack size has been increased to 50. Beornings can now get appropriate gear from the In Their Absence instance chests. Might-based agility armour has been added to a number of multi-output Tailor recipes. Beornings now have both Eastemnet and Westemnet guild crafted Mounted Combat class bridle insignias. The gear that drops from Hobbit Presents has been changed. Now, rather than getting a single piece of random gear from the 10-level band below you, you will get a box that lets you choose a specific piece of gear that is automatically set to your level, and is appropriate for your class. This box is bound to account, so you can send it to your other characters if you'd like. The stats of some Hobbit Present gear have been slightly altered, especially past level 70. The gear should still be roughly the same power, but may have slightly different stats. New level 50 Beorning gear is available at the Last Homely House. Level 95 Minor Essences have been added to the Curiosities vendor at each skirmish camp. This should serve as an easy way to get non-level cap essences if you're having trouble finding the ones that you want. The Gift of the Valar package can no longer be used above level 50, to prevent over-leveled players from accidentally opening the package. The Gift of the Valar package now has an induction bar, so it's a little less likely to use on accident. Legendary Items: Item XP now divides between only non-capped Legacies. Imbued Legendary Weapons should now show correct ""damage"" text in examination tooltips from chat links or inspect windows. The Advancement Trackers will now show the same XP bar and Level values as in the Legendary Items panel for Imbued items. You can now correctly see the main legacy for class items in the ""inspect"" legendary item displays Imbued Legendary Items no longer show the upgrade stars in their examination tooltip. IMBUED LI: the potency of passive effects on Imbued Legendary Items (e.g., the +Parry Rating on a Champion's Greatsword of the First Age) is now tied to the tier of the Default Legacy on those items. This conforms to pre-Imbuement behavior, where applying a Star-Lit Crystal to an item would increase both the DPS and Passives: now, when your DPS (or equivalent) Legacy tiers up, the passives will increase as well. IMBUED LI: Items ready for re-forge must be re-forged before they can be imbued. Burglar: Critical Chain Skills Critical Rating was not properly applying to a couple skills second attacks. Champion: Fixed an issue that was causing Fury of Blades Damage legacy to not affect the second or third attack of Fury of Blades. Ebbing Ire's Tactical Mitigation buff was not properly applying to the player, this has been fixed. Horn Damage legacy should properly affect Horn of Champions. Dire Needs Cooldown imbued legacy was not properly reaching its pre-imbuement levels and now should reach -60 seconds around rank 30. Guardian: Reactive Parry Damage should now properly apply to the Guardians Parry response skills. Light Damage Legacy should now affect Cataclysmic Shout. Simplified the cooldown legacy progression of Catch A Breath. Turn the Tables Cooldown legacy should now cap at rank 35 at 30 seconds. Upped the Damage Stamp gets per rank from its legacy. Guardian's Pledge should now reach -60 second cooldown reduction at rank 35. Shield Damage should properly cap at 25% damage at rank 35. Warden: Spear- Shield Gambit Power cost legacy should now properly decrease power costs instead of increasing them. Fixed an issue that was causing Hampering Javelin Reset Chance legacy to not properly apply to the skill reset.   Player Music:   You can now hear player music from 30 meters away (Used to be 15 for most instruments). Lute of Ages has been added to the game. This instrument can be purchased from any bard and plays the musical notes of the lute before Update 15.3. The Misty Mountain harp has been added to the game. It uses the appearance of Gléowine's Harp, but for player music uses its own unique notes. You can purchase this instrument from any bard. Gléowine's Harp has a new icon that matches its player music appearance. It continues to play the notes of the basic harp.   General Instrument changes:   Lowered the volume of the basic lute by about 12%. Increased the volume of the flute by about 15%. Tweaks were made to individual player music notes, including: Clarinet: F3 - Removed the buzzing noise at the start of the note. A3 - Increased the volume to be more in line with surrounding notes. A4 - Made note less metallic. Bb4 - Removed the slight squeak at the start of the note. Flute: Removed some of the breathiness on several notes (D2, B2, Db3, F3, A4, Ab4, and C5). Eb4 - Increased the volume to be more in line with surrounding notes. Horn: F3 - Increased the volume to be more in line with surrounding notes. D4 - Attempted to make the note less buzzy. Drum: Decreased volume on the shakers. Lute: Decreased volume on several lute notes (Eb2, Eb3, B3, F4, and B4). Removed metallic sounds from notes (Eb2, B3, B4)."

They'll now wait until you aren't looking to sneak away back to the culverts. Mablung now has a Healer among his men in the culverts of Osgiliath who is ready to sell you potions and repair your equipment. Osgiliath - Hunters can now make use of a camp site fire in the Osgiliath Culverts. Eastern Gondor - Upper Lebennin - Sworn to Secrecy - Corrected a typo in Angbor's story. Central Gondor - It is now easier to obtain reputation with the Men of Ringlo Vale, Dor-en-Ernil, and Lower Lebennin. The bounty quests found in Dor-en-Ernil and Ringlo Vale now award more reputation on each of their three possible completions, and all of the repeatable quests available after finishing the main storyline of each area now award substantially more reputation. The three soldiers you spar with in Imloth Melui now have fixed, unchanging appearances. Lossarnach: In The Smoke Lures, billboard text now pops up letting you know enemies are coming, and you should stick around to fight them (Also, in the nothernmost fire-site, should you happen to have missed enemies required by the quest, you can hang out and more enemies will spawn until the quest is complete). Text in opening of Madness of Vanyalos instance now matches the audio completely. Vanyalos should be far less likely to run back to the bluffs over the Anduin, after the first time she reaches them. In Madness of Vanyalos, non-instance enemies north and south of the area will no longer show up in the instance. Limlight Gorge - Limlight landscape monsters now drop Limlight Rep and daily repeatables can be reset. Angmar: A milestone has been added to Iorelen's Camp. A stable master has been added to Iorelen's Camp.   Instances and Epic Battles:   Deeds for the Ashes of Osgiliath instance cluster can now be found on a new tab on the ""Instances"" panel in your deed log. Osgiliath Instances - Monsters in scaled versions of the instances will no longer aggro from a huge range and will wait until you are close to begin attacking. Morgul Crest drops have been increased by 50%. Ruined City: Deeds for Ruined City now bestow and complete correctly. Text for Challenge quest is now worded more clearly. Fixed an issue where sometimes Lumithil's first drama line wouldn't play. Added a chest for defeating Jukotor. The door to exit the Palace of Eldacar is now locked until you have defeated Lumithil. Fixed an issue where the Mysterious Stranger would occasionally refuse to step forward and reveal himself. Fixed a potential issue where defeating Lumithil too soon after the second Harrowing Fell-Spirit appears could result in eternally spawning Fell-Spirits. Morgul Archers and other Orcs now are always using proper equipment. The Bleeding Gash DoT now does less damage overall. A number of small typos have been corrected. Harrowing Fell Spirits not in Palace of Eldacar respawn less frequently. Cargul's Mark and Bleeding Gash effects on players no longer persist after the symptoms vanish. Thrug boss fight: Respawning Orc adds now turn off and on correctly when the boss fight restarts. In Thrug boss fight: A cosmetic issue with the exit gate where it could get closed (but would then be ethereal) now fixed. If Thrug should happen to exit combat during his fight, he will no longer get stuck in a frozen state until reset. Dargnakh Unleashed - Dargnakh's Pounded attack does a more reasonable amount of damage. Carn Dum - Gurthul has practiced his fell magics and now knows how to stun Rune-keepers, Wardens, and Beornings. Sari-surma - Drugoth - Drugoth has learned to wield the power of Beornings. Hint: It involves bees. Raid - Tower of Orthanc - boss hitpoints have been adjusted. Epic Battles - Deeping Wall (Raid) - Legolas now always returns to the wall after Assault on the East Tower ends. Epic Battles - Secondary quests in all group sizes should now properly award Marks and Medallions. Epic Battles - Deeping Wall - Raid - The arrivals and locations of each of the three Shak-hai are now announced during the Epic Battle. Epic Battle, Instance, and Skirmish Mark and Medallion gains have been rebalanced. Epic Battles should give a little less, and Instances and Skirmishes should give significantly more. This should mean that Epic Battles no longer give so many more marks than other instances. The goal of this change is to give you more options for what content to run to get Marks. Some instances have had their Mark drop rates increased less. These instances include Sambrog, School at Tham Mírdain, Library at Tham Mírdain, Iorbar's Peak, Ost Elendil, and Stoneheight. These instances should still give more marks than before, but other instances should now give similar Marks per hour. Dome of Stars: Upal-Keng's adds will no longer continue to spawn endlessly if he is killed within 20 seconds of starting the fight. Deeds - Deeds for completing Tier 1 and Tier 2 will now properly complete at the end of the instance."

lotro,38wydy,aeisenst,12,Sun Jun 7 15:23:49 2015 UTC,You'll find less and less mounted combat quests from 86-95.  From 95-100 there really are not any other than warbands.
lotro,38wydy,UDE785,9,Sun Jun 7 15:43:01 2015 UTC,"You are not alone on this one. Thankfully, mounted combat becomes less a necessity and more of a novelty once you move through in Gondor."
lotro,38wydy,msbq,5,Sun Jun 7 16:23:45 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Mounted combat is my most hated 'feature' of Lotro by far. I'm one of those people that get the ridiculous lag/rubberbanding any time I'm on my warsteed. It took me 20 minutes to do the 'run around the ring' beginning quest because I was teleporting all over the place. Ended up crawling through it one step at a time.  All through Rohan I've been dismounting and taking out mounted targets on foot. That amazingly works since I play a hunter, I imagine most other classes are out of luck. Any quest that forces me to use my warsteed is just painful. Maybe it works as intended for some, but I'd be happy to see it disappear altogether."
lotro,38wydy,crossfire87,3,Mon Jun 8 01:37:43 2015 UTC,"For both a hunter and a champion, I found the most effective strategy was to put my horse points into maxing out the agility and speed related stats for the horse. Basically, you want it to be more responsive to your commands. Also boost the attack bonus from attacking at speed. I found navigating with the arrow keys very effective on horse back. (I very rarely touch the mouse during combat.)  Besides providing better, and IMHO faster, control, it frees your other hand to do simultaneous attacks. A keyboard with a + shaped arrow cluster is more effective than one with an upside down T cluster.  With the hunter, you can run circles around the foe, and never get hit as you wear the foe down with ranged attacks. When you are fast enough, the foe stands in place, turning to face you as you orbit it, and never gets a chance to attack you. In a confided space, follow the suggestions below.  For the champion, and other non-range types, charge past close enough to strike, and ride past a short ways, then turn 180° and repeat. It takes a lot of room, but the foe will rarely hit you, as it must either attack or move. Even in a confined space, keep moving and striking rather than standing still on the horse and striking.  With a mounted foe, also try to un-horse it, for an easier win."
lotro,38wydy,yaxriifgyn,3,Sun Jun 7 22:46:28 2015 UTC,"That is an excellent explanation, spot on, especially about steering with the keyboard.  WASD works fine for me.  As a hunter, I hold W and tap the D or A to turn as needed, in order to keep up the circling.  Two other points:   People say that putting yourself on follow to your enemy can help for mounted mele combat. ZOOM ALL THE WAY OUT.  Look down from above.  You will have far better control, and get far less dizzy that way."
lotro,38wydy,exploderator,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"Zooming all the way out definitely helps with game performance as well, if you find yourself having performance issues. It also helps you avoid triggering other nearby mobs accidentally.  Also, I use the X key to lock my view on the target, so that I always know where it is."
lotro,38wydy,notwhoithink,2,Tue Jun 9 10:38:10 2015 UTC,"As the others have said, almost strictly for warbands/roving threats, but I did find one very difficult epic quest that I had to 'cheat' my way through by hopping on the horse and kiting a baddie.  I use that as a last resort whenever possible."
lotro,38wydy,AudioPi,1 point,Sun Jun 7 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've done this to solo a mob that's supposed to be done as part of a group. Feels a bit hacky, but it works."
lotro,38wydy,guitarromantic,2,Mon Jun 8 07:40:35 2015 UTC,"You don't have to do mounted, you can take stuff down on foot, it just takes longer.  Cappy is one of the lucky classes with ranged aoe mounted skills, so you don't need to ride with precision to hit stuff (as compared to guard/burg, who need mêlée range).  On my cappy I would just aggro an entire landscape camp, then ride circles hitting the AoEs until everything was dead.  As others pointed out, a light steed with points in agility and yellow traits is most nimble/agile/steerable/less boatlike.  The good news?  Level 91 isn't far off, Gondor here you come (well, you do want to get those skill points out of HD)."
lotro,38wydy,RJFerret,2,Sun Jun 7 23:57:33 2015 UTC,"Gondor as very little mounted combat, so after 95 you'll only get a few mobs in central and east Gondor, but just a couple of quests. Either way you don't have to do all the quests. But listen even if you don't like it don't say the mounted combats are stupid. I happen to like it and lotro it's actually considered by many as having one of the best mounted combat mechanics in MMO's."
lotro,38wydy,PPontex,7,Sun Jun 7 18:12:36 2015 UTC,"I agree. It's actually a really good mechanic.. But it does stuck if you have lag issue, graphical issues, or are playing an mmo because you are good at more action based gameplay."
lotro,38wydy,ThomasTyndan,3,Sun Jun 7 18:53:15 2015 UTC,"Glad I'm not the only person who feels this way! Mounted Combat is actually quite well-designed, and most importantly it actually feels like something special instead of ""use ordinary skills while on a mount"".  It's just a shame that LOTRO's netcode can't really cope with the speed MC players travel at."

If the area is crowded with mobs use melody (goblins, spiders, wolves in Ered Luin) otherwise use Dissonance (flies in bree etc). I need cca 2,5h to finish most exploration and slayer deeds in starter areas. If you want some extra tp you could go to barrow downs and do some quests there and when you hit lvl 20 you can use rep items (cca 3,5h to finish all this). In 2,5h you usually get 300-350 tp, in 3,5h cca 400-450 tp. From the starter pack that i linked you get skill and deed boost (spam codas, cries etc to get extra 15 tp from skill deeds).

The license holders are happy with how the game is handled, and WB have the rights to make LOTR games, including one MMO. The only real reason to shut down LOTRO would be to start a new LOTR MMO, as the IP is so valuable. Doing that before we get to mordor in LOTRO would severely burn the best customers they would want on the new game.    So long as the game remains financially viable they will keep the lights on, and with the costs involved with the planned server changes I can't see them doing that if they weren't making money."

Without sounding like a dick Tolkien's son is somewhat ignorant to the world's love for the universe his father created. Didn't he say he hated LOTR or something and no further rights for any other work would be given out.  In saying that, can you blame WB for buying up an entire company for one section of rights?"
lotro,38mkrg,Crash665,6,Fri Jun 5 11:35:40 2015 UTC,"If he didn't say that after the LOTR films, he definitely said it after the Hobbit ones.  Tolkien's estate said they were done with allowing people to use the work and would never allow anyone else to have the rights.   I understand why, especially with the liberties taken in the Hobbit films.  However, LOTR online is nothing but a full on love affair with Middle Earth.  These guys and gals running it are complete Tolkien nerds.  That should account for something"
lotro,38mkrg,exploderator,-3,Fri Jun 5 14:31:04 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to tell, but if the fact that LOTRO still exists is because WB poured in the cash, then I'm not complaining.  Meanwhile, I fully agree that LOTR is an incredibly valuable property, I think far more important than most people recognize.  People think it's just fantasy, but so is the Bible, and LOTR is far better written, and has far better morals.  I think JR created a real masterpiece, that defined an entire class of fantasy, and did it so well that few can follow.  While I admit my general ignorance of the fantasy genre (I've stuck more with scifi because it's easier to find quality), Tolkien's Middle Earth is a truly epic place that is hard to match.  My only regret is that his kids didn't get to see the open source ethic come into fruition, where whole communities extend original works as a community project, instead of them being jealously locked down by an owner, or their commercial proxies.  In the long run, I hope one day we'll see a community created and driven Middle Earth, where the story is allowed to grow.  There's no doubt in my mind that people will love Middle Earth for generations to come, but nothing we've seen yet, no movies or games, can honestly claim to be the final word.  When I think back to Half Life and Left4Dead, the best maps I played were all free mods.  Something tells me that we players have the time, and we should be spending it building the game, instead of complaining that there's not enough to do.  Even if a parent company still sells that content back to us, by charging rent for running the servers, I don't mind."
lotro,38mkrg,Leftys-Wheelchair,1 point,Fri Jun 5 12:22:59 2015 UTC,"Expanding the world is a risky thing to do. Sure, I'm down for reading some fan fiction set in the world but when it comes to the set in stone lore and facts I'd rather it stay as Tolkien's word, or of course an adaptation of it like PJ did.  I too am incredibly ignorant of the fantasy genre but anyone who knows it, knows fantasy would be nothing without Tolkien's writing. Or at least not the writing we've come to know.   It's quite honestly offensive to say but Tolkien's son is up near the higher end of the age bracket. I don't know if he had kids or anything, he most likely did, but what I'm getting at is the fact that maybe when the rights pass along we can hopefully get an arrangement between the holder and another director, writer, who would be willing to tackle something from the universe. Although some of the stories are genuinely just made to read. I couldn't imagine the Fingolfin and Morgoth battle on screen. It just wouldn't make sense to look at. But then again people said that about LOTR right?   Heck, who knows really.   PS: Oh btw, that comparison between the bible and LOTR may be my favorite quote ever in regards to the bible."
lotro,38mkrg,exploderator,2,Fri Jun 5 12:40:34 2015 UTC,"Re Bible vs. Middle Earth, I'm glad I didn't offend you, but I took the risk because I couldn't help but speak what I see as true.  And the Silmarillion has a WAY better creation story too ;)  If you haven't read it, do yourself a treat :)  As for media other than writing, I actually think the MMO space is a rare new thing that holds its own, in ways that film/video never could.  I think LOTRO is pretty amazing, but it could be far better, and we shouldn't be blinded just because computers are brand new, and LOTRO was a first try.  Computers and LOTR will both exist for ever more, and the two will surely meet again in future MMO's.  But I just can't imagine any single company doing the kind of large scale justice to the content that it deserves.  I can see a company hosting the content, setting high standards for submission, effectively organizing and curating the community effort.  The fact is we players have more time than any company can ever afford, and that eventually needs to get tapped, just like it has in so many amazing ways in other modding communities.  I see no reason at all that something much more amazing couldn't be grown, and I think people would be proud to contribute top notch material that becomes part of a huge and thriving virtual Middle Earth."
lotro,38mkrg,Leftys-Wheelchair,2,Fri Jun 5 14:33:44 2015 UTC,I haven't read it but I know the basics. How Eru created other beings to sing a song and it created the world. The the villiain (I forget his angelic name but Morgoth) went to his own tune.   +I'm sort of anti-religion so that joke was well placed.  As for how we continue to build the world through time.. I'm happy with it ONCE it's from a true fan. I really can't stand when a company takes a brand/world and just uses it as a cash flow because people are willing to buy a bad game because of the name on it.
lotro,38mkrg,exploderator,3,Fri Jun 5 14:47:00 2015 UTC,"Sadly, I can't help but feel that cash cow is exactly how LOTRO has been treated, to a certain degree.  It has both good and bad, it's not a black and white situation.  And that's always the tension when you're talking about large corporate ventures, it's a fight between artistic integrity and profit taking.  The sad truth is that art never survives without some profit, but profit often happens with zero integrity."

They've reduced the staff down to bare bones and keeping the servers online i'm sure pays for itself with all the people who sponsor their gameplay with visa.   The content that's coming out is all just moving around old textures and designs so there isn't a lot of time spent on creation. You don't need a team of designers to make everything and arrange it, but rather just use existing things.   To answer the original question, I would say it is not worth it. Unless you're a nut about the lore, the game is just so far behind most newer games now. The best example I can give is that it is like going back and playing old Xbox or PS1 games. If you're really into it, sure, but otherwise yeah...just my opinion."

lotro,38b2yn,Taeyana,4,Wed Jun 3 01:42:50 2015 UTC,"My experience not getting past the RC boss yet is warden has it rougher than vids I've seen of guards.  As a burg, champ will have it tougher than any ranged.  Easiest seems to be guard, lm, mini.  Substitute any ranged dps for lm, just take more incoming damage without the debuffs.  Substitute any healer (well, rk, cappy, beorn) for mini as long as guard tank.  Other tank, more desire for earlier in that list healing.  Just be sure to get your morale way up, the T2 mechanics are nothing like T1.  Cap mitigations of course, and resistance is back as needed.  Also make wound resistance food for another couple percent.  Mini also has a resistance Anthem, and resist on higher level hope tokens.  These all lower the amount of healing required as the wound tiers up until resisted.  I haven't been in Sunken T2 yet but ranged dps again have it easy.  Melee gets hit hard.  Ditto the six man obviously.    G'luck!"

lotro,38b2yn,Collegenoob,3,Sat Jun 6 15:23:49 2015 UTC,"Imo, cappies are terrible as main healers. The strength of cappy heals comes from small, constant Hots for the entire group. These are great for raids where you typically have a mini/rk for main healing and use a cappy to supplement. But they just can't keep up with the high burst damage that mobs do in t2c instances these days.   As to whether that is a viable group... Meh, for t1 almost any group comp is viable. But for t2s, you'll need to find a true healer. Especially with how most of the mechanics in osgiliath involve spreading out, an all melee group will definitely struggle. The group comp that my friends use is cappy tanking, lm debuff/dps, and mini healing."

That being said, I also think cappies are the worst of the viable healing classes and probably wouldn't bring one in as a main healer to start with."
lotro,38b2yn,legofreak11,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:04:28 2015 UTC,"That's a fair complaint, actually. Stupid force attack AOE swing can ruin any tank's day!"
lotro,38b2yn,msbq,2,Wed Jun 3 22:31:47 2015 UTC,Please go into detail how and why you choose yellow line for healing. Thanks!
lotro,38b2yn,HannesStrohkopp,3,Wed Jun 3 13:39:05 2015 UTC,"Certainly! I tried running HoH on my captain for a while, since I wanted to set him up to be an off-heals role when he finally got to level cap. As I progressed through the tree, I was actually frustrated by the lack of buffs and DPS in blue line.   Here's the skinny on why yellow line is legit:    Strength in Numbers. Fellowship HoT with decent cooldown, between that and a Rallying Cry (lowered CD from LI legacies) I can spam heal the tank when I need to.  Yellow line's standard adds incoming healing buff (at max rank, it's a huge AOE too) as well as damage bonus Shield-Brother's call is an awesome skill that lets me heal my shield-brother whenever I take damage... and when you max yellow line, your whole fellowship gets shield-brother effects. Combine this with the Inspire attack and Exemplar effects, I'm healing everyone in my fellowship with every other hit I take/give.    Maybe it's a little off the wall, but it makes it really fun to actually deal some damage but still be a viable off-healer."
lotro,38b2yn,msbq,2,Wed Jun 3 22:39:16 2015 UTC,"Very interesting, thank you.  My biggest concern however would be that, given the combination of heal-aggro and yellow line's fighting style, it should be hard NOT to out-aggro the tank. How is you experience on that?  I guess the role of a self-healing Tank can not be played as Words of Courage does not apply to the Captain himself..."
lotro,38b2yn,HannesStrohkopp,2,Thu Jun 4 07:06:04 2015 UTC,"I like the idea.  Dont you get trouble with aggro in Yellow? Everything counts x3. My Heals Crit often so i see a Problem.  As you wrote Heal in yellow i think you speak about tanking and healing in yellow too. That we did at least on the T1 add groups. On the Final boss is was to less (Bard forgot to switch, as he didnt knows the ini) Was funny and not borring for the Healer."

It seems haphazard to have to make new toons across various random servers, hoping we can get lucky and find the one with people interested in the same things, and then hoping we haven't made a mistake when we spend our transfer.  It's not easy to tell.  I suppose you can shout ""Hi everyone, what's the point of this server?"" in world chat, but it still seems a little haphazard.  I guess my hope is that we can organize and announce that near the start, so that people can actually know  and choose what they are shooting for in a more deliberate way.  I also fear that without some clearly stated direction, we'll just end up semi-randomly picking new servers all over again, and miss a great chance to bring the right people together.

The idea is that you will get to simply choose for yourself, it isn't something they have to do for you any more.

""RP"" dedicated servers - for those into the lore and/or being their character Anything mixed together (PvP and PvE, RP and PvE, RP and PvP, etc., anything you'd like together)   Right now I am split between two servers (Arkenstone main and Landroval) so it would be really nice to know what to expect from what servers. I know it can't be enforced to be a ""dedicated"" server to one thing, but it would be really nice if they labeled servers a certain way to encourage players to go that way.

lotro,381hvn,GloriousMediaMakers,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"If the general servers had enough players the others wouldn't really be necessary, though.   Maybe, but that's a dangerous assumption, and it's actually the reason I made this post.  I think we need to discuss the alternative, because I worry that Turbine will make the assumption, do nothing, and it could be a failure (or at least a lost opportunity) that could have been averted with a little foresight.  I know you weren't really arguing that busy servers solve all problems (your post mostly says the opposite, and I agree), but I'll elaborate for the sake of discussion, because I think it's a point worth our attention.  Here's the assumption I'm challenging: in an ideal world, all servers would be high population and would fulfill all interests for all players by sheer bulk coincidence, because there will always be enough people wanting any one thing at the same time.  That works in some general cases, but the logic specifically fails in others.  RP is a good example, where the constant presence of too many non-RP players might tend to spoil the mood, because every other comment, and every other player you meet, will NOT be in role, and you might even get teased for trying to immerse yourself.  ""Hail and well met!""... ""LOL watever cya"".  It's unpleasant.  Likewise, a busy server is not a quiet one, and some people like low population servers, and some like soloing, and generally being alone, and they won't enjoy a server where you're always likely to find someone else in the same area as you.  Designating a new quiet and/or solo-focused server would be kind for those people.  Furthermore, according to Sapience (although hotly disputed), raiders and PvMP folks are said to be a minority, maybe 10% in total.  They might actually be much better served if they can congregate in servers with a more focused player base.  It makes sense to me, that they would be less frustrated when the average PUG is all serious players who are ready and wanting a T2 hard challenge, and not some casuals who don't even care about their toon's build.  Finally, I would fall somewhere in the causal spectrum, and I dream of a server full of people who share a mature positive causal attitude, and know it.  I've had quite a few unpleasant encounters with people who are hard core, and uptight about it.  People who will scream at other people for making an honest mistake, and can't see that it's just a game, never worth abusing anybody over.  I would gladly raid on T1, and laugh our asses off every time we wipe, no matter how stupid the mistakes, as long as everyone is giving it an honest try (staying awake) AND HAVING FUN.  It's about balance, and placing fun above goal accomplishment or ""winning"".  Most hardcore raiders and PvMP folks wouldn't be satisfied on my ideal server, nor I on theirs.  So even if having new high population servers will probably take care of 50% of the population, I have serious reservations about assuming we can count on it.  That's why we already have acknowledged RP servers, and I don't think the point should be ignored, it probably deserves to be expanded and made explicit, built into the process, so everyone can easily make clear choices."

I definitely wouldn't always want a busy server, too. I sometimes enjoy it in Arkenstone being the only in Evendim at times..."

Have to explain why you aren't equipping what they gave you.  Those that don't, aren't prepared for actual challenges, like some of the T2 content.  They haven't learned how their skills work.  They get easily frustrated.  They don't want to join stuff, or come to believe they are bad at grouping.  Before the director who changed everything to be too easy came in, there was good balance.  The challenges matched the rewards, so the game was more fun and engaging.  (See the psychological concept of Flow.)

My second toon on any server is usually a scholar, now that I understand crafting.  Explorer + Scholar = ability to get any mats I need for anything.  I would probably also add to pick an initial class based on what type of game play you enjoy (if you have an idea) -- that's probably really obvious, but if you're making a guide for beginners, maybe make a players' perspective description of the various classes, break them out a little bit by typical role and type of combat (melee/ranged/caster/pet)."

Play the contenders up to 20ish to get a better feel, then delete those you'll never play.  Many will tell you race doesn't matter, but man bonuses can help at higher levels.  Although swords are considered best for the parry bonus, Turbine is known for changing things (swords used to not have that).  Only at level cap is there now something costly to undo, which is Imbuing a legendary weapon.

Guards get shields and can block, as well as five times the morale per vitality instead of three.  Guards also have massive aoe attacks as well as ranged aoe at higher levels.  Burgs one-shot things from stealth/behind.  But you don't even need to when you can sneak past MOBs to get the quest objective.  They are the ultimate survivors, evading so many attacks, and then touch-and-go makes them almost invulnerable for thirty seconds, then another thirty after ready and able, that's if you didn't simply stun-lock your opponent so it can't hit you.  Multiple opponents?  Mez (Riddle) them or stun them, make one bleed while you take out another so they both drop simultaneously.  I actually suggest folks do burg earlier, as a later alt when they just want to rush through the starter areas hunter or champ is faster and more mindless.

Read the quest text first time through instead of just constantly clicking past it. Stop and slay for a bit instead of just running through each area, and if you find a dense amount of mobs somewhere, stay and slaughter them wholesale :)  Hovering over stats on your character sheet will give you much more detailed versions of said stats. Your character sheet has a second tab at the top called 'Cosmetics', playing with and learning how to look differently than you are really armored has been a fun aspect of the game.

Weaponsmith makes swords.  You need craft guild access to make legendaries and may only belong to one guild.

lotro,37v6ym,jacksinn,2,Mon Jun 1 09:38:06 2015 UTC,I too am rejoining and have an old lvl 52 minstrel. I reckon I should star back with that character. It's on silverlode though so I don't know if there is anyone left around there. Perhaps I should just roll a new one?
lotro,37v6ym,xKINGMOBx,3,Mon Jun 1 21:10:43 2015 UTC,"Depends on how well you can handle and enjoy the early content. Level 52 is Moria, which might be worth playing Silverlode, especially condiering the upcoming free server transfers, and I would gues Silverlode will be one of the servers coming down, but who really knows..."
lotro,37v6ym,dclary,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:43:58 2015 UTC,"Hm... Ok. I ended up rolling hunter. Just felt right. Perhaps I'll roll a minstrel alt in the future, haha.   Edit: As far as servers go... I wanted to play somewhere with a relatively high population so I could get a group together without any hassles. That's why I chose Brandywine. What's the status of the servers? Some are shutting down? Are they merging some?"
lotro,37t7ef,tck_chesnut,3,Sat May 30 04:54:17 2015 UTC,Just play the game through Steam and it will work.
lotro,37t7ef,lordquednau,3,Sat May 30 11:51:30 2015 UTC,I had this problem when I tried the game out a month ago also. What you need to do is go into the steam apps folder and open LOTRO from the .exe launcher instead. Then when you open the game you can easily purchase the points.

I don't use the Steam Wallet, but it should ""just work"" with the Mac Client (which I do use.) I think you just use the shift-tab business to activate the overlay (which I don't normally use either), and then you can access the Wallet.  That said, to buy points (last week, before the store changed) if you were running the Steam Mac Client, you simply went to the store, clicked, buy points and the store interface did the rest -- when it wasn't broken, which happened quite frequently."

Most of the fun of the game, IMO is the attention to detail, the stories, and the vast amount of really cool world-building that went into the game. Starting from scratch has given me an opportunity to experience it all again, and I highly recommend this path to anyone who's playing the game because it's a game  and not just a grinding challenge to be met.   http://hardhobbittobreak.com/2015/06/spamwisers-journal-level-twenty-one-the-great-barrow/"

But there is no rule saying which servers you can or can't play on, the whole internet is treated equally, and it's mostly pretty fast these days anyways.  I'm from Canada, and I play with people from India, the Philippines, Australia, Taiwan, etc., and we are all on Imladris, probably because that was the default new server years ago when we started playing, and we got established there."

The greatest difference is in their animations, you may find you like human, elf, or hobbit animations more or less than dwarves.  As for class, I've always seen dwarves as a heavy armor class, yet the dwarf alts I have are RK and Min!   TLDR: Race is pretty much cosmetic (animations, etc.)."

Elves go to Rivendell, Humans go to Bree, Hobbits to Michel Delving and Dwarves to Thorin's Hall. The start bonuses really don't add up to much, especially after the early levels. They do have weapon preferences/bonuses.  For example Dwarves get bonuses with axes, which means that despite picking up a 1st age spear from Filikul my Dwarven Champ still uses two axes."

lotro,37n1jm,RJFerret,2,Fri May 29 04:08:24 2015 UTC,"Your numbers are off regarding the damage bonus - it is 5% damage for 1h and 2h swords for humans, 5% for 1h and 2h axes for dwarves, and 5% for 1h swords for elves (elves get 5% bow damage to even it out).

lotro,37jiok,Ambassador_Buta,10,Thu May 28 02:35:20 2015 UTC,"Yup. The story was posted 2.5 months ago. The thread in question was pretty lively and interesting, and also a bit depressing as well. I actually stopped playing for awhile after reading all of his comments."
lotro,37jiok,notwhoithink,9,Thu May 28 03:37:31 2015 UTC,"I really find this game depressing at this point, I loved it so much for the world, the community and my kinship, but it is just outclassed by the other MMOs I play and everyone I know has quit....the last time I logged on it had been 6 days since anyone in my kin had logged on.  I hate to be 'that guy' but to me LOTRO died far before its time."
lotro,37jiok,CaidenTheGreat,8,Thu May 28 15:03:19 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem may be your kinship, or the server that you are logged into.  I'm on a less populated server but we have one of the largest kinships on the server, and there are always kinnies online and chatting and doing quests/runs together.  Once they let us move servers I suspect that we will probably all depart for a more populated server and transfer the kin with us.  I do still enjoy the game, but there's not doubt that in some ways it has fallen behind some of the other MMOs in the market.  But at the end of the day, it is the only one set in Middle Earth, and that accounts for a lot in my book."
lotro,37jiok,notwhoithink,2,Thu May 28 15:26:26 2015 UTC,"My server (Windfola) is definitely underpopulated which is a large part of it, but when all of my friends quit playing I realized that I'd quite frankly rather be playing WoW or GW2.  5-6 years ago I think LOTRO really did compete with WoW....but these days it has just gotten out of date in comparison, without the community it has lost most of its draw for me sadly.  What you said about middle earth is very true and why I stuck with it until about a year and a half ago, they have such a rich world and story to draw from, but it can only go so far when the combat is clunky and the current content is mediocre at best. (or at least was last time I played.)"

Also he really laments the F2P transition but I'd never have started playing if not for f2p. Subs are ideal but the sub-based MMO is long dead, only WoW can sustain it."
lotro,37jiok,CaesarBritannicus,2,Thu May 28 17:23:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I think free-to-play worked out fine overall. There were some problems, but from the perspective of a player, the game didn't hit the skids until a few years later."

lotro,37jiok,DuneBug,2,Thu May 28 18:51:52 2015 UTC,I thought the WB takeover was a bigger deal than f2p.  I also found his take on some of the developers interesting.  I always felt like the game was being mismanaged and a lot of potential not being fulfilled in late SoA and MoM.
lotro,37gdfe,malador888,16,Wed May 27 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"As a female and long time Lotro player, I gotta say ... I don't like that mug. A hunter is one of the classes in the game, and unless you know that she plays a hunter, it could be the wrong thing to pick. Even if she does play a hunter, a plain mug like that is kind of mundane.  I agree with the poster above. Turbine Points would be good, because she can use those to purchase any quest packs she doesn't have, or a horse, or more storage, etc. You could also buy her some game time, which would be paying for a couple of months of a VIP subscription, and the subscription would get her additional Turbine points.  Buying Turbine points now will get you bonus points with a purchase until June 1. You'll have to make an account to buy them, and you can get them here: Turbine Points  Or to buy game time, go here: Turbine Market  Once you make an account and place an order, they'll email you a code for the game time or the turbine points, which she can add to her account. Print the code out and place it in a birthday card and you're done!"
lotro,37gdfe,Narvinye,2,Wed May 27 16:10:18 2015 UTC,"Hey, I have followed your advice and so bought 1550 of these points from the shop after making an account, but the email they sent doesn't contain any code :/ The email reads:  Thanks for your purchase! Below is the information for Order #[7digits] on 5/27/2015 11:01:01 PM (GMT):  Recipient: LOTRO Free to Play Account Signup (2015-5-27) Item: 1,550 Turbine Points Price: $23.99 (USD)  If you have any questions, please don't hesistate to contact us via our Support Center.

lotro,37gdfe,Narvinye,3,Wed May 27 23:07:29 2015 UTC,"Ok, don't panic. Call account management and explain what happened. I know they can transfer the points to another account because I had a friend with two accounts who accidently added her points code to the wrong account and got the points transferred. However, do tell them that if possible, you'd prefer a points code that you can print out and put in a birthday card so that it'll be more of a surprise. In order to make a transfer, you'll need to have her character name and the name of the server she plays on, and if you don't already know, you'll have to ask her and that would kind of ruin the surprise.  If you do end up having to make a transfer of the points instead of getting a code, use your free account and make a character. Get to a mailbox and send her an in-game birthday wish and let her know you added some points to her account.  Thinking about it, probably the nicest gift you could give her would be to try the game out and see if you like it and play it with her for a bit. It's fun. Really!  I feel really bad that I wasn't clear with the info I gave you. I'm so sorry! If you know which server your girlfriend plays on, let me know the server and her character name. If she plays on my server, I'll send her some in-game stuff for her birthday."
lotro,37gdfe,loknaster,3,Thu May 28 02:16:00 2015 UTC,"Aww you are so very nice and helpful, I have been in contact with the guys at turbine and they have offered to transfer the points over. But I have now asked them if they can refund them, so I can just buy the points from a different place which does get a code which they directed me to.  The idea of sending an in game message is a great one, and one I will probably do.

lotro,37dumm,SapienChavez,5,Wed May 27 19:47:07 2015 UTC,"Orc loving pigswines, busting a hardworking grower of fine pipeweed.  My heart goes out to you fine sir/madam, you've paid an incredibly terrible price that nobody ever should have to pay.  Please accept my heartfelt apology on behalf of humanity.  Welcome back to Middle Earth, land of the Free People :)  Besides any expansion packs, as mentioned by others, I would highly recommend spending your loot on various handy perks that add up.  Here's a list of things that greatly grease the wheels:  Account wide stuff:   Shared storage, get up to 210 slots, applies account wide for all your toons.  Very handy. Extra storage bags, very handy.  (I'm pretty sure this is account wide) Wallet, holds all kinds of misc. tokens, account wide, very handy. Horse skill (sorry don't remember name), account wide, gives all toons an instant riding skill and +178% speed (you ride all horses very fast).  This takes away a lot of pain, because all your toons can get a fast horse (any horse will do) as soon as the intro session is done. Extra wardrobe space, lets you store cosmetic clothing and/or armour to wear for any toons in your account. Extra character slots.  The very cheapest extra storage is to have what I call ""vault alts"", that just live at the vault in Bree.  With logout only taking 9 seconds now, you can put a bunch of crap into shared storage, log into a vault alt, and put it in their bags and vault space.  With all toons having 6 bags (90 slots) and 120 vault slots that can be bought for in-game gold, it is a very efficient way to store your extra crafting supplies and whatever else.  I have 2 main toons, and 9 vault alts.  It's worth it.   Stuff you have to buy for every toon that wants it (spend wisely):   Extra milestone skills, at least a couple is handy. Hurried Traveler and Returning Traveler skills.  Combined together, these cut the cooldown time for milestone and return-to-{place} skills, all down to 5 minutes.  With a few extra milestone skills, you're almost as good as a hunter for fast traveling. Higher daily task limit, goes up to 15 tasks per day, good for getting reputation and legendary item experience (after level 50).   One final detail: One of the expansion packs, I think it's a Rohan pack, gave me a thing where all new toons get a special shield that gives a large boost on all XP.  It makes it really fast to level up toons, when that is my goal.  But as another player mentioned, you level up almost too easily now, so buying XP reducers might almost be as useful for some toons, because you don't want to skip the beginning of the game.  LOTRO is not really a great raiding and end-game game any more, the fun is in the journey, not the destination.  Don't rush it.  I think of it like this: if you buy that expensive thing that instantly puts your toon to level 50, you just payed a shitload of money to skip the first half of the game, which is arguably top notch stuff.  Why would you want to do that?  It's not a race.  It only means you run out of fun stuff to do, all the faster.  If you race to the end, you will race past the best stuff.  There's no competition, it's all about what you feel like playing."
lotro,37dumm,exploderator,5,Wed May 27 03:41:58 2015 UTC,"Thank you so much for this well thought out reply. I'm not a big fan of the XP boost stuff, I like the leveling and believe that's most of how you learn to play your class. I was looking at the account wide horse skill option before writing the post. Thanks for confirming.   I'm kind of happy to hear there isn't a huge end game here. I spent a LOT of time in a WoW raiding guild years ago, and damned near had a divorce because of it. I'm looking for more of a casual, social type thing.  I will definitely be investing in the account wide stuff (when the store comes back up... Grrr...)  Do you have any suggestions on servers? Again, looking for casual type stuff.  Thanks again for this reply. I really appreciate it."
lotro,37dumm,WelCZa,1 point,Wed May 27 14:14:41 2015 UTC,i couldn't agree with you more dear sir. this is one of the best advices i've read on this sub.
lotro,37dumm,UDE785,2,Wed May 27 05:33:54 2015 UTC,"As someone else mentioned, with the Lifetime you get the subscriber or VIP style account, for life, so any quests packs and non expansion areas are free.  Buy the expansions, and then use the rest on whatever you want.    Personally, after xpacs, I would save them to use on my level 100 legendary weapons.  It'll save you some of the grind getting tomes of empowerment, starlit crystals, etc through instances."
lotro,37dumm,Cortobras,2,Tue May 26 23:48:27 2015 UTC,"Open beta characters stayed around, so if you started within the last couple of weeks before launch your characters should have stayed around, I think.  If you haven't checked Brandywine you might want to look there - that was the beta server.  Rather than Gift of the Valar you might want to consider Stone of the Tortoise - you'll outlevel most of the fun quests if you advance normally."
lotro,37dumm,ChriosM,1 point,Wed May 27 01:57:45 2015 UTC,"I did check BW and I did have a character there, but it was level 1. I guess it got reset after beta."

Within a few short levels, you will have 2 shout skills that will 1-hit nearly every non elite, on level enemy you may encounter. Please enjoy slaughtering groups of enemies faster than any other class in the game."
lotro,37dumm,angbad,2,Wed May 27 06:31:24 2015 UTC,"Don't worry. If I pick a class & start to like & play it, it will get hit with a nerf hammer in a patch or two. I picked the class mainly because I enjoy healing & chastising DPS who steal aggro."
lotro,37dumm,majorlagg1,2,Wed May 27 14:16:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, all the classes are pretty op nowadays. Really makes the first 20 levels a blast regardless of what you pick."
lotro,37dumm,angbad,2,Wed May 27 14:35:00 2015 UTC,All characters are wiped after beta that's shy you don't have any.  And yeah you definitely have enough to buy all the expansions. You don't need to buy any areas because you're a subscriber.
lotro,37dumm,Cortobras,-1,Tue May 26 23:25:37 2015 UTC,Negative. If he bought a lifetime founder then he should keep his characters. Make a support ticket and ask for the names of all deleted toons on that server. They list them with the date of deletion. It's possible that he's on the wrong server or they got scrubbed from the database accidentally. It may not matter though you can have a toon maxed out in a week.
lotro,37dumm,majorlagg1,2,Thu May 28 14:09:30 2015 UTC,I thought he was talking about his toons from Beta
lotro,37dwmu,gans1mn,6,Tue May 26 22:33:33 2015 UTC,"Tough to say, as I've brought through my alts over the years I am still impressed by Moria's catacombs and passageways; in fact, it remains one of my favorite zones in the game.   Whether due to memory or skill Moria is easier to level through, but the path and quests remain the same, or similar.   TLDR: I think it is pretty close to ""old-school"" Moria."
lotro,37dwmu,TheWanderingSuperman,2,Tue May 26 22:47:39 2015 UTC,"I havent played for years, but i still rememeber Moria. I've played it through multiple times before and after the revamp.   I enjoyed the difficulty at release, but i have to admit.... I love how fluid ad smooth all the quests are in moria now. The zones feel more fleshed out, and there are a ton quests that are picked up in the field instead of from an npc. It makes the adventure feel so much more amazing.   ""You stumble into a goblin encampment encroaching near a town. Burn down the tents and kill X goblins""   Those kind of things that they changed in the field make Moria feel more alive."
lotro,37dwmu,Sp00nyBard,3,Wed May 27 18:18:21 2015 UTC,"I love the random 'Kill x, burn y, destroy z'  Kinda makes me feel like a guerrilla fighter"
lotro,37dwmu,DCSFoyle,3,Wed May 27 22:03:59 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, right?  It just fits really well in those sections of Moria and the other parts of Lotro that are wild."
lotro,37dwmu,Sp00nyBard,6,Wed May 27 22:49:30 2015 UTC,"My favorite one was in Rohan   'Kill and behead 8 uruk riders. Mow place their heads on pikes along the camp walls'  Oh...o..okay.   Making a man, dwarf or elf do that seems reasonable. But making a hobbit do that?"
lotro,37dwmu,DCSFoyle,2,Wed May 27 23:10:23 2015 UTC,"There is more light and in addition it gets more goats back to the next ""Town""/ Settlement. Also it gets some new quests, at the goatpoints. The ways are mostly the same, some shortway entrances has moved."
lotro,37dwmu,SirIBON,2,Tue May 26 22:57:32 2015 UTC,"There's much better flow now. You encounter a bunch of new camps of dwarves and you get sent from X to Y to Z in a logical manner. Gone are the days of wondering where you get your next quest. This also adds new quick travel spots so it's easier to jump around. Also, it's brighter, but still very much a cave. You see the architecture more, which is a good thing. I consider it a very nice revamp."
lotro,37dwmu,byzantinebobby,2,Wed May 27 02:07:27 2015 UTC,"Moria before the revamp almost made me quit LOTRO.  I fully admit it was my first toon and I pretty much sucked, but it was too dark, and everywhere you went was a battle to stay alive.  After revamp the place has less mobs in main corridors, so you can get from A to B without as much grief, and you also get a goat fairly early, so you don't have to run on foot for the first half.  All in all I would say they made it a fair bit better."

I'm not sure, and I'll have to play with that.  But I think maybe yes, it was partially the clutching darkness that made old Moria hard to enjoy, so maybe Alt+F10 would have helped :)"

lotro,37dwmu,txtsd,2,Tue Jun 9 17:57:35 2015 UTC,"Well the maps haven't changed and indeed still add some appreciated level of confusion/realism to navigation.  The biggest take-away I noticed regarding the before and after is that there are fewer mobs...or at least they're more consolidated to camps.  If you stay on the main roads, it's a bit safer than it used to be."
lotro,37dwmu,7h3C47,1 point,Tue May 26 23:25:54 2015 UTC,"I'm going through Moria again now, the first time since the last update. It is still as lovely and creepy and atmospheric as before, but the quest flow is better, and it includes some newer features like automatic quest bestowal (from Rohan). Trash mob density was cut down so it's easier to get around--assuming you don't get lost. Travel routes are better, and some static goats unlock as special travel routes when certain quests are active, so be sure to click/inspect them. I just stumbled on the Chamber of Mazarbul again and it made me just as queasy/excited as the first time. And those ghastly dwarf corpses outside The Fanged Pit. Ah, Moria, the dark pit that loves you back."
lotro,37dwmu,camenecium,-1,Thu May 28 01:15:48 2015 UTC,"Moria now is worse, it's harder to get from place to place as they changed the map and closed off routes so there are more dead ends.  Before it was also clear where the main passages were, as mobs discouraged you from going of path.  Now most the mobs are gone.  Before it felt like a cavern.  Now it's actually brighter than Mirkwood and East Gonder!  It's also clashing tacky bright carnival colours.  They also added their streamlined questing to negate exploration, adding more stables to negate travel to.  You can do it without having a clue where you are.  They also removed the only challenging corner that offered some group questing entirely.  Now nobody quests there at all.  They also increased the xp given, so you out-level Moria halfway through without rest xp."
lotro,37dwmu,RJFerret,2,Wed May 27 04:41:40 2015 UTC,"Ah, that sounds...disappointing, especially the lighting changes.  Maybe I just have remarkably good eyesight, but I never had any trouble seeing where I was going when Moria was first released.  Hearing that it's now brighter than some outdoor environments defeats the purpose of exploring a vast underground cavern!  Moria's lighting is such a massive part of the atmosphere -- it adds to the feeling of foreboding, that someone terrible might be lurking around the next corner.  I can understand adding more camps to cut down on travel times, but the original Moria had a few too many camps to begin with.  Making them pop up more often seems to remove much of the danger that makes Moria appealing.    It sounds like they tried to balance challenge with accessibility, which is always an unenviable task for game developers.  I'll give a report of my impressions after I've leveled through the content again."
lotro,37dl5b,Ldawg360,6,Tue May 26 21:14:53 2015 UTC,You won't spoil the second or third movie until pretty far into the game
lotro,37dl5b,ammar_io,6,Tue May 26 21:34:56 2015 UTC,"The movie and book can both be ""spoiled"" by the game, depending how far you go.  If you've only just watched the first movie, I recommend watching the 2nd before somewhere mirkwood."
lotro,37dl5b,A_Mouse_In_Da_House,4,Tue May 26 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"It can, as there are so called Big Battles (instanced group content) that can be done starting at level 10 and spoil the ending of the second movie. Other than that, you will not get spoilers about the second/third movie until you are about level 40 and you reach Rivendell.  And reaching that point will probably take you more than 30h of playtime if you are new to the game.  In general, the game follows the setting of the book very closely, instead of the shortcuts the movie has to take. Your characters story in the game is also more of a ""behind the scenes"" regarding the main storyline from the movies; your path will intersect with the one Frodo, Sam, Aragorn and all the others take but most of the time will be spent fighting the Free Peoples enemies all over Middleearth."
lotro,37dl5b,Hyoss,3,Tue May 26 21:34:40 2015 UTC,"The game follows the books more closely, so if anything, its going to flush out details the movie glossed over or left out completely.   Obviously if you don't plan on watching the rest movies for a very long time it's going to spoil the plot, but the end of the first movie is right around level 75 in game.   That going to take a long time to achieve, depending on your play style."

lotro,37dl5b,WelCZa,1 point,Wed May 27 06:08:08 2015 UTC,not really.  the game follows the books very closely.  the movies take some liberties on where some characters are and makes some changes for the sake of a movie.

But if you prefer leveling by action, you can always do skirmishes. They are a sub system starting at lvl 20. There are very few at first but more get unlocked with vip or by leveling. They have high density then a decent exp chunk for killing the boss"

I'm not too sure about tasks - but with the daily max and specific requirements I don't imagine that its very effective unless you played in short periods daily and kept up on which mobs dropped what."
lotro,37e86z,kembik,1 point,Wed May 27 07:04:37 2015 UTC,"The Quest will give you also the story :-) Sometimes nice loot, too. If you want to Level on Killing, then have a look on the BoD, so you can solve an addition feature. There is also a BoD for quests. 10-> 20->30[in sum] in Common If it is only for leveling fast then Skimishes may a good idea,  because they give you a lot exp and marks, that you can use in later game too. As you in the 65 area many players visit Swordhalls for leveling."
lotro,37e86z,SirIBON,1 point,Wed May 27 07:07:39 2015 UTC,"I've found the fastest way to level is skirmishes with a +100% exp token going. However not everyone can do that, and in the absence of the +100% exp token I think questing is faster. Although if you are looking to kill mobs running around vs. quests I'd say 100% do the quests its a great story line."

If you're looking mostly for lore and storyline, it's definitely worth a shot as those are probably the game's biggest strengths. You said you found the captain boring, I would try out warden or champion as they're kind of faster paced classes. Mini is also good if you want a ranged option that is pretty fun, as is the RK, but the RK and warden aren't free."
lotro,370iqz,canadarainfall2,1 point,Sat May 23 18:56:30 2015 UTC,"It can be tough to find people for instances unless at level cap (aside from GB, which is always popular). Some kins no doubt will be better for this, as the game's instance finder is totally useless. The instances are still pretty tough, but solo content is very easy now.  Gladden and Landroval are pretty busy. Brandywine too of course, but people complain about that a lot."
lotro,36zmmh,lmx1,5,Sat May 23 14:11:52 2015 UTC,"My kin mate and I have the 2 3-mans on farm mode and this is the setup we use.  The runs are not about ultra, über high dps, they are about surviving huge hits and slowly whittling down the mobs. So with that in mind:  The group setup we use for farming is cappy tanking (although a warden or guard could easily work too), lm hybrid support/dps, and a mini healing. Everybody needs completely capped mitigations and at bare minimum 25k morale (with more being better) while the tank should be around 40k+ morale. Once you get those two stats set, as a mini you should focus the rest of your slots on crit and tactical mastery.  Edit: I should note that having a cappy will make it significantly easier to hit 25k morale due to IDoME and motivated and they also have a pet that boosts mitigations to over cap."
lotro,36zmmh,legofreak11,3,Sat May 23 15:36:25 2015 UTC,"Thank you! My mitigations are capped but my morale atm is only 17k, I still need to fill up 3 pieces of gear again so probably fill with morale then? Getting the morale essences is a nightmare now but hoping I'll come across more soon. That's a good point about having a cappy in team actually, I'm just worried I might not hit the 25k morale so hopefully with a cappy helping I'll reach it. Thank you for the advice! Just need to find a cappy friend now to run it with me & my lm kinnie lol. Any advice for a better chance at coming across morale essences? The drop rate in pelargir is soooo low & I'm having no luck at all with it, only came across 3 people selling greaters in wc in past week & none on AH lol."
lotro,36zmmh,legofreak11,3,Sat May 23 16:04:16 2015 UTC,"Well, the essence market on Brandywine is flooded with basically every essence so finding them has never been a problem for me.

I prefer to get my kicks from things where each can be his own player, and it's the group dynamic/tenacity that wins out.  OD/BG....moors raids...skraids etc.  I wish more than anything that DN scaled, that, to me, is the perfect group instance."

You can have the huge morale pool, but the wound at the first boss of RC will keep ticking until it's bigger than you can handle unless you resist it.    Note, you can get resist pushed other ways than just gear, resist wound food (which also offers a hard percentage boost, which doesn't suffer from diminishing returns like ratings), mini resist anthem, and hope tokens with increased resistance."

lotro,36zmmh,Fluffcake,2,Mon May 25 14:29:53 2015 UTC,"For a mini? Cap mits, cap crit and stack 20-25k morale pretty much, bigger morale-buffers make the margin for error bigger, you would likely want some crit defence in there as well if you are doing dome (will likely take some hits from archers here and there, and it sucks to get back to back critted within a second) and there is no dps-races and stacking lots of tm for healing is pretty futile. The resistance you get from will, food, token and proper virtues should be enough to have to be really unlycky to get killed by the wound in RC."

If you are capable of handling solo play for a great deal of time (assuming you don't get into an active kinship) you can actually have a really good time. The story quest line is engaging from beginning to end, the areas are thoughtfully designed and well done, and as others have stated the game hosts a pretty decent attitude from other players.  I am an example of someone who has mostly solo'd for years in lotro, and I still love it to this day."
lotro,36oo9u,RJFerret,2,Thu May 21 02:52:34 2015 UTC,"Note, unlike what I've heard about WoW, Lotro is. about the story ""hile leveling up, endgame currently consists of three smaller instances that are brutally challenging, such that few have completed them yet.  Much of the game is so easy, players haven't learned how to really play, so don't short yourself leveling up, or regret the results of doing so."
lotro,36oo9u,Fluffcake,2,Thu May 21 03:55:46 2015 UTC,"Brutally challenging is an overstatement, they punish mistakes, lack of knowledge and poorly built characters (and to some degree what classes you bring, but that is another discussion). Most fun Ive had in the game since the last real raid-cluster (erebor). The bar had to be set somewhere to keep it interesting for people who played before the BB-minigames were introduced and knows what their class can and cant do."
lotro,36oo9u,RJFerret,1 point,Thu May 21 08:32:03 2015 UTC,"Actually they have simple mechanics (or no mechanics), hence the nature of the difficulty being ""brutal"" in nature.  A key aspect is lack of indicators for players to respond to.  The only defense isn't optional, it's to stack resistance (something previously insignificant), eat resist food, and grind for morale essences--brutal.  You can make mistakes, just run back.  You can lack knowledge, your big morale pool absorbs it, and you need to have a poorly built character with excessive morale."
lotro,36oo9u,Fluffcake,1 point,Thu May 21 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"Gear-checks are one of the most common mechanics in the history of MMOs, next to dont stand in the fire... Would you be happier if was a dps-check? In which case rks and wardens could do it with their eyes closed and quest-gear, while other classes would struggle even with capped mastery/crit? Since you mention the resistance, Im assuming you are referring to the first boss in RC, and there are plenty of counters to it that doesnt involve morale/resistance stacking, roughly half the classes have the tools to handle this (knives out, our fates entwind, SW, lm/burg/bear debuffs, cappy dmg-redirect) so there is just a few select combinations of classes that are left with morale stacking/resistance food and virtues as a last out."
lotro,36oo9u,RJFerret,1 point,Thu May 21 21:21:29 2015 UTC,"Hmm?  Not sure what you are replying to.  I was pointing out the new instances don't punish anything in the post I was replying to.  They don't require knowledge, have no mechanics, etc."
lotro,36oo9u,Fluffcake,2,Fri May 22 02:11:27 2015 UTC,"If you compare the game heads up to WoW, WoW would come out on top in most metrics.  However, the story, and in general nicer community (except for a certain high-pop server where people transfer to pvp, and the concentration of elitists may be higher than average) makes up for a lot of its flaws. So if you are into LotR, and can overlook a fairly weak end game ( from the perspective of someone who enjoy raids), you are likely to have a great time."

lotro,36nmf2,FG28,1 point,Wed May 20 20:10:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, the quest gives XP based on a formula between your level and the quest level. Mobs do this also. There is a color code. Reds are the highest and will give you a reasonable portion of XP, but it really hits the top for orange and yellow, going down thru white and into the blues and greens start to reduce your XP and when they hit gray, they no longer give any XP. That being said, you can still complete the quests or kill the mobs, which is often done for completion of areas/deed/quest lines. Just take a look at your quest log and you can see the color code at work, level and they can change color.  On a side note, don't worry to much about not getting enough XP. The game has plenty of extra area so you don't have to use all areas, complete all quests or use XP accelerators to hit cap. Needless to say, if you want to level fast, use XP accelerators and try to complete quests when they are orange or yellow."

(these numbers aren't even close to reality, just examples) let's say you're at 9,500/10,000 on level 12.  you spend the destiny and it gives you 3,000 accelerated xp.  you'll be blue to the end of level 12 then have 2,500 more accelerated xp when you roll over to level 13.  but if you used the destiny after you hit level 13, you'd get like 3,250 accelerated xp (it scales with level).  if it's your first toon, i wouldn't worry about accelerated xp.  enjoy the ride.  that being said, when i'm leveling alts, i use it 5x/day along with whatever other xp boosts i can get my hands on."
lotro,36nmf2,notwhoithink,1 point,Thu May 21 03:16:00 2015 UTC,"Destiny is an old system. I honestly have not looked at is quite a while. You still get some, but you no longer earn it in the quantities you used to. Feel free to spend it on whatever you see that interests you. I believe almost anything you can get with destiny can also be gotten at the store. As for the accelerated experience, I don't know the duration, but it is either a fixed amount (extra blue bar on your XP bar, double points for the next 20K) or timed (+25% for 60 min). There are so many XP accelerators out there and many of which can be used together (like a +XP% pocket items and a scroll of +100% XP for 60 min.) Honestly I am a bad one to ask on this, I almost never use XP accelerators as I like to do the content and have my deeds done before I hit cap."

lotro,36me7r,rachellsophiaa,2,Wed May 20 13:21:40 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for Snowbourne as I am on Arkenstone, but at least on Ark, the fellowship panel is rarely or never used and the best way to get a group is to start one and advertise in World chat.  As for the server mergers, as far as I know, Turbine is still working the details out. I have not seen anything saying this will not happen, but the best time table sounds like fall or winter before this starts. When it does, they are supposed to allow free transfers from low pop servers to higher pop servers. Which servers will be designated as destinations and which will be free to get off is yet to be announced. Mid population servers like Arkenstone believe they will be a destination, but we just don't know yet. There is a lot in the works and much promised, but until Turbine makes there plans known, everyone is running around like the sky is falling.   As for Snowbourne, I don't know were that server is pop wise. If it is a low population server then you may have more trouble finding groups. As far as I know you can transfer, but it will cost you and you will want to find out what size server your going to. Many love Brandywine, which is the highest pop server, but I have heard complaints of lag. I love Arkenstone and it is not that hard to find groups if you use world chat or, like me, have a good kin to ask who wants to run X.   Finally, as for changes, the trait trees work, you just have to get used to the difference. Some like them, others don't. Also look to your virtues as they de-coupled vitality from mitigation's and resistance. That means you need to emphasize these in your virtues to improve your survivability. There is also the new imbued weapons, but that would be a bit for you and I advise reading up on the changes to fully understand this and the legacy changes it makes for each class."

lotro,36hz3z,dclary,8,Tue May 19 15:02:05 2015 UTC,"While server mergers can be seen as the game winding down, overall it is not a sign of the end times or anything. Some would argue that we could have used those merges years ago. There are 29 servers for a game that is now 8 years old. If the game had 500,000 players (which is more than I believe it has active in any given month) split evenly over those servers it would only be 17,241 player per a server, which is not a lot.  That being said, the license will expire in 2017 and there will be negotiations to extend it then. I personally am of the belief that it will be extended, but either way I wouldn't imagine the game ending for a year and a half. Even taking it slowly and meandering a lot that is a lot of time to get through the game. These days all of the epic quests can be soloed so you can play through the story even if no one else is around your level. Although on Landroval I still see the occasional lv. 25 or 35 forming groups for doing old world content on level.  The new player inventory can be a pain. I end up throwing out all the cosmetic stuff. If I want it on a character I can always /reclaim or start a new character and throw it in my wardrobe.   Other's may disagree, but I feel the model treats subscribers fairly well. You still have to pay for expansions, but any other updates have been available to subscribers for no extra cost and you get a 500 point stipend a month to buy some extras. And Turbine hasn't updated its store with a new cosmetic every other week like some games so I've never felt like I need to spend a tong of money to get stuff.  Welcome back to the game and good luck."

Part of what I've seen is new hardware for the server mergers and free transfers over a several month period.  Those that don't transfer it sounds like they may just merge the server onto another one for all remaining toons.  Though solo, I'm going to be looking into the server forums and see which might be a good fit.  I do enjoy being sociable in games, and occasionally don't mind lending a hand here and there, but for the most part it'll be the community I'll be considering.  Think the only servers I actively avoid are the RP ones as it's a bit much even though I'm usually ½ in character anyways.  Though I may eventually try an alt on one to test one out."

BuffBars: Shows the duration of your buffs/debuffs & if you get low hp/power/feared/poisoned etc, you get to select it so a potion will display on your screen for easier usage. CombatAnalysis: I only use it for the DPS meter, mainly a competitive plugin to show off, or to improve your skill rotation to see what pulls of the most damage in a given time. Friend Alert: When a friend comes online it displays in big letters in the center of the screen. Epic Battle Plugin: Helm's Deep Epic Battles assign side quests based on what side you start on, to avoid having to memorise the side quests, this plugin displays it. Legendary Item Planer [LIP]: Displays a panel similar to your current legendary item panel, worth it to see how to spend your points, set up fake LIs and just see how it looks. [Outdated to when L95 was the cap, shouldn't matter too much] Songbook: If you play music via ABC files then this makes your life easier. StatCalc: Example, if I want to see how many Essences will get me to 25% Critical Rating i'll type +1000 into Agility.. etc. Waypoint: I only use this for deeds like Treasure Caches, copy the coords from the wiki type /way target paste [71S 85W] and it displays an arrow for where to go and how far away. Terrain Map: If you ever can't figure out how to get somewhere look at your Terrain Map for a minimap like quality in a fullscreen mode. Travel Window: Adds a button to your screen that when clicked opens a box displaying all your travel skills. IF you have bootstrap you can add the button to the dropdown menu instead of the button on your screen. Alerter: Create custom alerts that flash in the center of your screen for spesific events notated in chat. Examples[what I have]: When Sturdy Steel Key shows up in loot it displays 'Bob has acquired Sturdy Steel Key'. Another is for Pelargir when the winch guy says gate is raised, another is a notice for when my attacks are being reflected, and lootboxes.   Another good one [more so for clickers] is TonicBars, it lets your create more skill buttons on your interface, drop down menus for a list of mounts, or travel skills.  Oh and another thing is skins, depending on your monitor size you might want to get a skin that extends your UI, making mailbox, AH, and Vendors bigger. If you're a keyboard player you might want a skin that removes the buttons on the skill bar that open your bags, traits, etc."

Its like an organized combat-log, with some additional features.  Imo these are the only must-haves, arguments could be made for alerter too, but all the others are mostly nice-to-have fluff imo."

You are high enough level to be past much of the free content, but could get into the 80s freely.    There is no p2w, everything is available in the game.  Paying accelerates things if you want to skip the playing the game part of playing the game.  It is possible to get to cap freely, just a grind then instead of more variety of content.  There is not those old style raids, although Helegrod still exists in broken up pieces and is scalable to cap.  Rift retains it's classic form.    It's free to see, so might as well check it out.  Note pvp has never been huge and remains the orphan child of the game."

lotro,368d6y,Rikvidr,1 point,Sun May 17 13:39:21 2015 UTC,"A lot has changed, a smattering amount.  I'd recommend checking out the forums and release notes..even though you have about 3 years of research to do.   People still do stuff on each server though probably better if you can get into another kin or switch to a more populated server."

lotro,362vp6,wedontbuildL,9,Fri May 15 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"iirc, Guard and Champ are about tied.  Champ might be a bit better, as they would likely have higher ratings and higher agility.  both only have one attack.  Capns have an Archer Pet, but can not use any true ranged themselves (there are throwing knives and their craptastic dmg).  The dmg from the pet might even outclass a Champ, but im just speculating and would have to play with them to see.  but really, none are worth a crap compared to hunters.  fun question, but its really asking who is a 1 and who is a 2 on a scale on 1 to 10.  the class scorging a 2 is still gonna suck!  hope i helped; have fun!"
lotro,362vp6,SapienChavez,1 point,Fri May 15 17:27:31 2015 UTC,"Nowadays champs and guards will have the same amount of agility (base+0) due to the removal of +hit from agility  When I played a couple of years ago the ranged captain pet was at least equal to the DPS that a champ could put out ranged.    I thought only Burglars could use throwing knives.  Dwarves got throwing axes, but they were only useful until around level 30 when the ranged skill out dps'd them"
lotro,362vp6,jwwkB,1 point,Sat May 16 03:17:22 2015 UTC,"You can buy in Michelbinge throwing knives, but the crafted one are only for Burgler. In BG you use it to get Power on the Captain. Me had a look for for it, for my Captain, because a Warg fleed with 143 Moral in the Moors.  The Phyiscal Mastery depends on Might at Heavy Armour Claases, so there is no (true) need for Agility.  The Captains Archer damage is on low level well.  [ironic] So we can start to run after the the Archer. This is a good think, so we learn it how it will be in later game [/ironic] :-)"

lotro,362vp6,aratholie,2,Fri May 15 19:41:48 2015 UTC,my question is why would you go for anything else than a hunter? are you making an alt and you like the archery concept? or are you reluctant to pick hunter because they have fairly underpowered melee damage?
lotro,362vp6,RJFerret,1 point,Fri May 15 20:41:49 2015 UTC,Ah well I really like the idea of being a heavy armor like warrior and wielding a bow on the side ^

lotro,362dhf,Seadevill,2,Fri May 15 14:50:03 2015 UTC,"I would say you have it mostly right, it is relatively simple grinding for end game gear, though it typically involves doing so within a group for the best stuff, so joining an active kin/server tends to be key to success with that.

lotro,35uc21,Necrofobiax1992,0,Fri May 15 13:05:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah I get that. I am asking what the point is, specifically of this video, not just any video of a person playing.   So is this guy funny to you? Because he ain't good.  Starting from the beginning of the video there are issues. Doesn't understand why he got the title? Can't figure that out? Can't see the login reward alert? I bet he never loots once.  Watching an extremely below average player cannot be entertaining, can it?"

If the person who's playing the game is funny or just good at the game, it's in my opinion worth watching.   So... you either think he is good or funny, and the video has a point because it is entertaining, or at least you think more than one person out of 5,845 will think he is good or funny. If not, your point is moot.  Do you spend your time watching pigeons defecate? This is like a video of pigeons defecating."
lotro,35qfpm,ScreamOfDeath,4,Tue May 12 17:41:34 2015 UTC,when in doubt - check the WIKI : http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Legendary_Titles  they may not have ALL the titles yet.
lotro,35qfpm,Belhaven,3,Tue May 12 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter AT ALL when you put titles on a weapon, they are completely unaffected by imbuement.  Not 100% sure, but as a hunter, the Beleriand + physical mastery tier 3 is the best bang for the buck.  You might do the same but with tactical mastery instead, and the damage is probably more from the physical/tactical mastery than going with main stats.  At least that's true for hunters and other DPS physical classes.  There might be special class specific titles with other perks specifically for minstrels.  Hunters don't have any class specific titles, I just remember seeing a bunch in the vendor lists that are for some other classes."
lotro,35qfpm,exploderator,2,Wed May 13 05:37:23 2015 UTC,"You didn't say what titles you are considering, but this was what came up last time that we talked about it."
lotro,35qfpm,notwhoithink,1 point,Tue May 12 19:54:52 2015 UTC,"Awesome link, ty! I am assuming that a tier 3 title is the best? When you guys were speaking of the barter (Deagoth) in Ost Galadh, is it the stat legs he sells, ie will, vitality, etc.?   And do you think Beleriand is best for moors?"
lotro,35qfpm,notwhoithink,3,Tue May 12 21:12:52 2015 UTC,"No idea what is best for the Moors, I've never been.  Tier 3 is the highest tier so far, and will be better than the Tier 1 or Tier 2.  I have no idea about Deagoth, I haven't been to Ost Galadh in many months.  Sorry."
lotro,35qfpm,Hyoss,3,Tue May 12 21:24:58 2015 UTC,"As explained in another place in the thread, you want the tier III scroll from Fangorn that gives you 500 Physical Mastery + Beleriand. The other Tier III scrolls provide crit rating - and you will easily reach the crit cap of 16800 without the crit from a scroll, so PM is the only and best alternative. The benefit from damage types will not outweigh the loss in PM if you go with a slot that provides less raw damage but a different type.  Cannot answer what the Galadh barter is about, as I have not read the other topic. But in general the easiest source of stat legacies is any relic master NPC (melding tab)."

Furthermore they have an inherent agility increase. So with Elves you will get more bow damage. Your DPS will always be higher if you have chosen an Elf over a Man.  Men get the racial heal, which is substantial at mid level, also a +5% 1H sword damage bonus.  An Elf makes a better hunter."

lotro,35pysr,The_Mertan,5,Tue May 12 18:30:11 2015 UTC,"You are looking at a 5% + some change increase in bow damage plus a minor bump in agility if you are an elf hunter that likes the bow. My hunter, a hobbit, prefers crossbows so race was a much smaller factor in my decision.   So, my guess is that most of the men hunters are men because they care more for the cosmetics or the man heal than they do a 5% bump in damage."
lotro,35pysr,Kants_Pupil,5,Tue May 12 19:57:54 2015 UTC,"A Human get +5% incoming healing. This is one of the most superior Buffs someone can get.  The Damage increase are on the auto attacks. My Hunter is an Elf, but on min-maxing, with the view on Raids, i would take a Human.  In Endgame with more as 4000 Agility, no one cares about 20 Bonus Racial Points on Agility. Rotation and Knowledge about the Class will bring the Success."
lotro,35pysr,SirIBON,4,Wed May 13 18:03:55 2015 UTC,"Big difference, no.  If there was a big difference, that would be a bug they would change so folks could pick the perceived liability.  Many hunters go elf per Legolas."
lotro,35pysr,RJFerret,2,Tue May 12 16:16:21 2015 UTC,"The thing is ""big"" depends on the person. I for example think a 5% damage increase for elves using bows is HUGE for hunters. And Turbine is still keeping it that way since the start of U12."
lotro,35pysr,Hyoss,1 point,Wed May 13 13:59:26 2015 UTC,"Except there are few dps race mechanics in the game, but for those couple instances, yups."
lotro,35pysr,RJFerret,2,Wed May 13 14:08:58 2015 UTC,"True, the DPS races are few. I guess my advice would be - if you are a hardcore min-maxer go elf for hunter, but in reality any content will be doable with any hunter race."
lotro,35pysr,Hyoss,2,Wed May 13 14:24:27 2015 UTC,"Wow, I can honestly say that I didn't expect so many replies. I too think it mostly depends on person's choice.

Once you have found it right-click on it choosing rename and rename it to ""olduserpreferences"" and then reopen the game.  At this point before you complete the log on process first click the button that has the single down-arrow on it (in the row in the upper right-corner of the launcher) and choose options from the menu.  In there under the repair tab click to enable the ""Reset game display settings"" setting and click ok and then finish launching the game to test (choosing yes when prompted ""Are you sure you want to reset?"").  At this point if prompted to enable DirectX 10 or 11 graphics choose ""No"".

lotro,35phqs,Mastengwe,2,Tue May 12 14:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'd do tank and healer if you want easiest grouping later.  Guard/mini is awesome leveling and makes grabbing a third for low level instances and all those awesome Moria instances a breeze.    Captains can tank too, and bring appreciated buffs to groups with tanks.  They can also heal small group stuff.    Wardens solo better (a mini would kill everything before the warden gets fired up).  RK can heal too if you prefer anticipation rather than reactive mental playstyle.  The real question is what do you guys enjoy?

Every class can take on 2 or 3 roles (out of DPS, Tank, Healing, and Support) and leveling content is easy enough that any class can do it easily even if soloing.   The biggest thing is that each person should pick a class they really enjoy playing, keeping in mind which roles they want to be able to fill at endgame.

Everything is pretty much made to be done solo now, so it is better that you are the classes you enjoy and can then easily learn to maximize your effectiveness.   A lot of people just play what they think is cool and end up being really bad players, even though they think they are great. lol  The worst thing I would think though, is having two of the same class, as for example, having two Captains, their on defeat skills cancel each other out... you could manage to always use the opposite of your fellow captain, but it doesn't really work if your fellow doesn't have a care."

You can solo almost everything if you want, but having a little questing buddy is also fun.  There are some people who are only interested in end game, but for the majority of players that's not the case.  It's about enjoying all middle earth has to offer.  The crazy vistas, the towns we've read about, getting bad ass titles and weapons and shit from killin evil things.  Elves and Dwarves you start way out west in Ered Luin, if you roll a hobbit you start in the shire, and men you start just outside of Bree in a town called Archet.  After the first maybe 10-20 levels or so, you kinda all end up in the same place and begin to follow the same path the fellowship did (to a certain extent).

I just don't want to spend the majority of the game doing nothing but solo exclusively until end game. Solo I'd important, but ultimately I want group content. I just don't want to be an eq1 rogue who has next to no solo capacity."
lotro,35hk5p,lbcadden3,5,Sun May 10 15:41:24 2015 UTC,Healer or tank  Until level cap you will be solo unless you seek out people to group with and it will be hard. A well established large guild might have groups of people doing lower level content.  All classes can solo the quest and landscape mobs with no problem.

lotro,35hk5p,DrunkLastKnight,3,Sun May 10 17:40:10 2015 UTC,"Either Brandywine or Landroval if you're based on the US. For even a more immersive experience you could also try Laurelin.    Actually, personally I don't really recommend Brandywine if what you're expecting is a sense of friendly community rather than the... (I'll get a lot of hate for typing this) conglomeration of generic MMOG keyboard warriors but do try both servers first though. If you're really into PvP, Brandywine is very active about it."
lotro,35hk5p,7h3C47,1 point,Sun May 10 19:06:46 2015 UTC,Landroval is also good for the times you want to RP but not really all the time. I like playing on Landroval and have generally met very nice people.

lotro,35hk5p,Kants_Pupil,2,Mon May 11 06:20:08 2015 UTC,I haven't find much a difference in class difficulty actually. I didn't even realize my first one was advanced but the other easy (I can't remember exact difficulty name) ones were no different and just really felt like a different class with the same general stuff
lotro,35hk5p,Whmagill,1 point,Tue May 12 11:26:05 2015 UTC,"I think that distinction is important in noting classes with either very specific functions, like lore-masters and their need to both do damage and provide support, or in complexity of resources and actions, like rune-keepers having attunement or wardens having gambits. Champions, hunters, and guardians should really be the only basic classes, burglars, minstrels, rune-keepers, lore-masters, captains, and beorning are intermediate, and wardens are advanced."
lotro,35hk5p,Cogito96,8,Tue May 12 20:33:50 2015 UTC,"LOTRO is all about the books -- all about the story associated with the Lord of the Rings Trilogy.   Yes, there are those (especially on the ""heavily populated servers, like Brandywine) who are only interested in a WoW-like experience. They absolutely MUST reach level cap within a few hours of playing, and absolutely MUST have the highest possible gear with as little effort as possible and then do nothing but engage in PvMP, which is similar to PvP, but quite different.  If you enjoy Tolkien and are familiar with the LOTR Trilogy (not the Hobbit or the Movies) then LOTRO's Middle Earth is for you. You can explore a HUGE map and find many locations and experiences mentioned in the books. You are not part of the Fellowship, but your character is engaging in ""protecting"" Middle Earth as the Fellowship makes its way to the conclusion.  Currently the game is only about half-way through the third book of the Trilogy, so there is no ""end-game,"" just an on-going story. We can now see Minas Tirth in the distance, but cannot go there. (Probably will be able to in Update 17+ sometime this summer.)"

lotro,35gfjx,Hyoss,1 point,Tue May 12 07:32:22 2015 UTC,"The way ANY epic battle works is that the solo and duo version are absolutely exactly the same in any way. Same health/damage/number of enemies, but two players, making it so much easier to complete the instance and any side quests."
lotro,35gfjx,freedaemons,1 point,Tue May 12 07:38:39 2015 UTC,"Personally I run glittering caves for meds/marks, easiest BB to solo IMO, once you have 200+ points to trait."

Using the ballista you were able to solo the first sidequest on Platinum. this was patched and can no longer be exploited.  Once again Sambrog and/or Thorog are the best places for mark/medallion farming, the 12man Epic Battle is not bad either."

lotro,35dvcn,Hyoss,1 point,Mon May 11 15:13:20 2015 UTC,"So this only applies to Epic Battle rewards then, there was the possibility to farm those by only doing the first quests in GC over and over."

I assume everyone in the sort of kin I am referring to honors the current caps on: level, gear, books and skills.  A kin already at-cap like 50 is good, the best of all would be to happen upon a new leveling group from scratch so all the intermediate areas can be hit from Great Barrow onward. But I take what I can find.  But I see your point about relative ease that is now possible (for someone ignoring the rules I want to have). It is too bad you cannot recreate the old instance structure and such to do this sort of thing. No matter what you do, it is a lot easier than it originally was; but as long as I can at least do content that doesn't turn grey due to turtling I count that as a win."

lotro,358dlx,ScreamOfDeath,6,Thu May 7 23:26:35 2015 UTC,"You can get half-a-mil IXP runes in DA for 20 silver tokens.  Think skraids give the 900k ones ('peerless').  Can't comment on gear for that class unforch.  If you're soloing, you'll want survivability.  I can't imagine having less than 18k morale would be very survivable, unless your mits are A++.  The way the numbers usually shake out, you sacrifice 'ability to kill quickly' if you stack morale/vit and mits so don't expect to be able to nuke anything and also survive.  Of course, you can do your dummy testing and try to strike a balance if you're really patient.  Big self heals and mits will be more effective in the long run for soloing imo (than things like crit rating).  Lastly, finesse is kinda important for everyone who intends to inflict damage at any point in the moors.  Probably raid healers that are just healing fellows are the only people it's not crucial for."
lotro,358dlx,7h3C47,2,Fri May 8 01:45:50 2015 UTC,"Firstly, it depends on what you want to do in the moors. Do you want to do damage or heal others? I predominantly heal, so I can give you the most advice on that.  For healing: I got 2/2/2 (2 of one moors set, 2 of another moors set, 2 essence pieces). I wouldn't go more than 2 essence pieces for healing because the CC duration can completely destroy you and can be pretty brutal. The moors set is just for the crit defense, so feel free to mix and match any combination for the stats you want. For healing, it is extremely important to max out your defenses (FW/OC mits, tactical mits, resistance, crit D, etc...) Unfortunately, minstrels are lacking the block/parry/evade component so don't worry about that. Light classes mit caps at 40% so it's not too hard to cap. I capped mine with two supreme physical mitigation essences, virtues, and some mit gear (Sarchol and Central Gondor quest reward bracelet that gives phys/tact mit).  Next important thing to cap is crit rating. If you trait correctly in blue line, your cap is 30%. Anywhere from 25%+ is solid. Don't worry about tactical mastery. It doesn't really increase healing much. Crit is much more important. Crit defense should be at least 40%. Mines at 53% and at a certain point, it doesn't affect as much. Lastly, morale is super important. As a healer you want as much morale as you can. In my current build I have about 25.4k morale with capped mits at rank 11. I'm definitely striving for more morale with virtues and shifting in gear, but you definitely want as much morale as you can get while also maintaining high defense since the gist of healing is surviving yourself long enough to keep your friends alive.   For DPS: Crit, again, is super important, not only for increasing critical rating, but also your devastating magnitude. Cap is 30% traited. People have different dps builds. Some prefer to go complete glass cannon and have all 6 essence gear with tact mastery and crit for maximum dps. I've seen some people running around with 70-80k mastery ratings and they do insane damage. However, this, of course, comes with the price of low defense and morale. If you want a more solid dps build, I'd just try to trait for as much morale/tactmastery/crit as possible. In a dps build, it's more forgivable going more than 2 essence pieces and can be more various and you'll find that you have a higher array of choices regarding builds.   As for LI XP runes, I just run fast instances like school of tham mirdain or library of tham mirdain or even library. They drop LI XP and runes for your relics for your LI. If you don't want to do that, you can get them with marks/meds, or the silver Dol Amroth tokens.   Best of luck!"

Update 16 was just released, which is East Gondor, we've been through Dunland, both sides of Rohan, and gone from West through Central Gondor since Mirkwood/Enedwaith.  With mounted combat and higher levels, Moria, which used to be end game, is now about halfway.  They are also transitioning how legendary weapons work, testing it on level 100s (current cap) first.  The system removes some major functionality in favor of some dps at the cost of a large grind.

lotro,3508nm,Arathaert,2,Wed May 6 22:01:39 2015 UTC,"Based on my experience as a guard, the fastest way to level is going to be depending on how much of the game's content you're willing to skip.  First off, you definitely want to be in red line - you'll do much more damage and things will die faster. And you can certainly pull lots of mobs - I regularly solo Sambrog, which involves pulls of 10+. You can realistically pull close to 20 mobs without breaking a sweat in red line as you get closer to cap. That being said, be sure to max out Radiate and Insult to Injury (from yellow) if you're running in red.  As far as leveling, the most rounded-out and almost fastest way is to quest. Things progress quickly enough and you'll get decent gear, pick up some virtues and can work on rep, etc. as you go.  If you don't care about the actual game content and want to just rush to cap (or another level), I'd say find a friend to power you through some GB instances 'til you get to Moria. Then you can run through Library and those GB instances. When you hit Mirkwood, be sure to do the epic line to unlock the Strike Against Dannenglor skirm - you can speedrun the T1 solo version in 4 minutes (skipping counterattacks) or can get someone to power you up via doing the first quest in T2 Sword Halls. Boring, but effective, especially if you use xp increasers.  I'd highly recommend the questing route - you'll end up with a much better understanding of the limitations and capabilities of your guardian fighting that way. I'd check out the guardian forums on lotro.com - there's oodles of good info in there, too.  Enjoy and welcome to the awesomest class :D"

Dadi's guide was made during build 1 of beta. And during build 1 many of the items were not yet compatible with imbuement, and the patch notes even made note of it.  Also, swapping out a legacy postimbue will keep the same number of tiers you had unlocked on the legacy you replaced.

But I think the first age weapons might get those tiers available above what other weapons can ever get, IE it is the hard cap that gets raised by 3 more, not just the soft cap.  I don't know.  If they are the same, then the only extra value of a first age weapon is equivalent to 3 scrolls of empowerment / 87MC, and some XP (who cares in the long run).  If scrolls of empowerment cost 100 gold on the AH, and/or are not even for sale (my server), then a BSoEK for 250 gold, and build a first age, is a good deal that saves a little time.  Plus, who doesn't like gold things better than purple things?  I really hope the first agers get 3 tier higher hard cap on DPS, because in the long run, for anyone who has the time, that means there is a way to get 3 more damage tiers, and the cost doesn't matter in the long run."

Fixed a case where you could end up with a legendary item which isn't bound to you but is slotted in the legendary items panel. Instance Finder has been updated to have buttons to look for groups for Osgiliath The ""Revive Tomes"" link from the ""Enhance"" panel in the Character Panel has been replaced with a ""Virtues"" link. You can now alt-click to select, and double/right-click to equip items in the ""Legendary Items"" panel"

Once Imbued, it never needs to be re-forged or reconfigured again. That means an item that feels more, well, legendary. Read more about it here!  A new instance cluster has arrived!  It has been some time since we said those words, “new Instance Cluster.” Ask and ye shall receive. For some time now players have been asking for new instances, so based on that feedback we have added three new instances with Update 16: The Sunken Labyrinth, The Ruined City and The Dome of Stars. You can read more about these new instances here.  New Regions  Spanning the rolling fields that run between the rivers Sirith and Erui, Upper Lebennin is a lakennd still mostly unscarred by the wars that have ravaged the surrounding provinces. For this reason, many folk have traveled west from the great citadel of Minas Tirith to take refuge in the fortified mountain-vale of Tumladen. Meanwhile, dark rumors are spreading that something fell lurks at the Crossings of Erui, where long ago Castamir the Usurper met his end.  Among the fiefs of Gondor, Lossarnach is widely considered the most beautiful. A land whose people are proud of ancient traditions, it is ablaze with flowers and blossoming trees. Forlong the Fat, beloved by all, has ridden to war from his stronghold of Arnach, and most of its people have fled to the refuge of Imloth Melui, renowned across the kingdom for both its healers and its vast gardens of rosebushes. Here, too, lies the Harlond, the river-harbor that serves the city of Minas Tirith, where the Corsairs of Umbar once planned to make their landing … and where Aragorn now plans to sail with his captured fleet.  Long ago, South Ithilien was one of the realm’s mightiest and fairest regions, but now, though still lovely, it lies forlorn, abandoned by its people. Orcs and worse haunt its overgrown ruins, and the great refuge of Bâr Húrin -- ancestral home of the House of the Ruling Stewards -- crumbles among the hills of Emyn Arnen. Only the Rangers, commanded by Captain Faramir, remain to keep watch on the Enemy in the shadow of the Mountains of Mordor.  The grand city of Osgiliath, once Gondor’s capital, has seen many woes. Standing athwart the River Anduin, it is a shattered shell of its former glory, long forsaken and left in shambles. The orcs of the Morgul Vale now teem in the city’s eastern half, under the command of the Lord of the Nazgûl. At last word, the defenders of Gondor still hold the western shores, but how long they can endure the Witch-king’s hosts is a question whose answer will likely prove grim.  Epic Volume IV, Book 3: ‘Voices of the Past’  The Battle of Pelargir has ended in victory for Aragorn and the Grey Company, and now the Chieftain of the Dúnedain turns his eyes toward Minas Tirith. How can he come to the White City in time? He enlists your aid to keep secret the defeat of the Corsairs and to learn what has become of Faramir, son of the Steward, and the city he was charged to defend."

Mines of Moria (also gives you 2 more chars slots and Warden+Runekeeper classes), Siege of Mirkwood, Rise of Isengard, and Riders of Rohan (Warsteeds and Mounted combat).  The Quad Pack gets you from 50-85.  If you are 30 you will need a couple more packs from the Store.  I recommend the Evendim Quest Pack (gets you to 40) and then either Angmar or Forochel (Forochel is easier to solo, Angmar has more group content) to get you to 50.

If you want to feel 'needed', I'd try a minstrel which is the healing class.  It has decent solo damage as you level, and then at the cap I'd say it would be extremely rare to find a case where someone didn't want a mimi in their group for heals."
lotro,34rf7s,7h3C47,3,Sun May 3 22:38:51 2015 UTC,The easiest class to master is the Hunter but I think for free characters the Minstrell is best because you can heal yourself as you get used to playing.
lotro,34rf7s,EmmaClemson,2,Sun May 3 22:37:45 2015 UTC,"Guardian.  It's slow going but you won't die.  Make it a Armourer too and you'll be very self-reliant.  Tanks are always wanted in groups, so You'll have all the chances you want to join, you can just ignore them if you want to solo, and soloing is way easier with a guard ( my first and main i s a guard and I never died starting out), you deal less damage but you can survive so much longer.

LOTRO tends to warn you before throwing you into unskippable sections, and most of the non-raid instances can easily be done in under an hour. It's not as optimised around the drop-in-drop-out style of play as a game like Guild Wars 2, but I don't think it'll frustrate you either."

A helpful kin can answer questions and assist you if you get in over your head. There are helpful out there, you just need to find one that fits your play style and play time. In my kin we may not know the answer, but we welcome all questions and try to give guidance to new players.\  Next, download the Lotro Plugin Compendium and install it. http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html Once you have that, install the Daily Task Reference. This will will allow you to pop any task item into it and it returns where the item is used or tells you if it is not used (Turbine has a lot of mis-marked items)  Finally, if the tokens of salutation are what I am thinking, you get 3 of them early, you don't get more and they are not good for anything beyond the basic items that you can trade for in the starter areas, so use them early or trash them."

We inspect other characters, give advice, help get a player the gear to get to cap and then, when you hit cap, help where needed with advice and direct assistance with gear and stuff. I have never gone outside of kin for any easily crafted goods, they are almost always free or mats only. I see a lot of folks asking world chat this stuff, they often get bad answers, no answer, are only told go Google it or worse, they are made fun of for not knowing.

Another easy fix is that if you have any legacies on either of your LI items that isn't super critical--take a trip back to Moria or Mirkwood and grab a legacy of vitality, which will add some morale to your toon and help with survivability."
lotro,34gh7s,Olerhead,9,Thu Apr 30 23:10:48 2015 UTC,"Moria's been revamped recently. It used to be a deep dark hole that swallowed your sanity and your will to live for all eternity. Now it's a deep dark hole that is actually fairly simple to get through. My most recent run-through of Moria took about five days tops, and that was with a Burglar that even got all of the quest deeds done before level 58. My Minstrel made it through after only maybe 24 hours of gameplay before the clean grass of Lorien was tickling his toes. Conversely, my pre-revamp Guardian is still stuck in the 21st Hall, waiting for me to drag her out into the light.  Moria is much easier now. Every zone is streamlined (Except maybe the Water Works.), the mob density has been trimmed back considerably from all of the adventurers going through, and it is much more difficult to get lost these days.   With the exception of the instances, Moria is a breeze. And, if you are lucky enough to hook up with some random 100th level deed-completer, even the instances are a cakewalk."
lotro,34gh7s,porpoiseoflife,5,Fri May 1 12:49:58 2015 UTC,"And they turned up the lights quite a bit, so you can see enough to not lose your soul into the pits of doom :)  The place is far far easier than it ever used to be.  I almost quit LOTRO over pre-revamp Moria, and finally getting my hunter to Lothlorien was almost as good as it must have been for the fellowship.  But I don't suck at the game any more, and I wouldn't hesitate at all to level through Moria next time.  Hell, I won't even have to run through the first half on foot just to get a goat.  It also really helps to know your way around by exploring it on a high level toon, before you face the maze when it can kill you."
lotro,34gh7s,exploderator,5,Fri May 1 18:51:49 2015 UTC,"Well, ok, a lot to talk about.   Servers: It is generally regarded that the most-populated servers are the ""best"". For the US servers, those are Landroval (focusing more on Role-Playing) and Brandywine (largest population). That said, there will be a server consolidation in coming months that will likely merge two or more smaller servers together, so you do not have to abandon your old server if you don't want to. Classes: You've tried two medium-armor classes, one DPS, one Tank. Maybe a heavy armor class would be more your stream? A champ or guard? Moria: This one is a bit harder as I have never tried to avoid Moria (I am one of the few who enjoys that place!). If you really want to, though, it is doable. To start I would level as much as you can above 50 (using Angmar, the Misty Mountains, Forochel, and Eregion), you can probably get to 54 if you really squeeze each area for quests. With that I suggest going into Moria and doing the Epic quests as it gives Class Points for traits. It should be relatively easy to breeze through and leave Moria at 58, maybe even 57, and start with Lothlorien, Mirkwood and then on to Enedwaith.    TLDR: Servers: Biggest are Brandywine and Landroval. Classes: try a heavy armor DPS or Tank. Moria: level before, do the Epic in Moria, and head out into the Light of the Vale."
lotro,34gh7s,TheWanderingSuperman,2,Thu Apr 30 23:28:21 2015 UTC,"Luckily, I'm already on Landroval.  A heavy armor class has always been appealing in thought, though I have always found the gameplay of Champion or Guardian rather stilted and dull. The Warden was fun because of the gambits and the Hunter was fun because of the long-distance nuking (which I can't do anymore.)  Do you have any insight on what an RK is like? They look kind of interesting, although I'm heavy into the lore and it feels kinda silly to see someone smacking stones together and making lightning strike."
lotro,34gh7s,Darchseraph,3,Thu Apr 30 23:54:50 2015 UTC,"Hey send me a pm with your characters and I'll add you since I'm on Landy as well.  RK at lower levels is a discount Minstrel. (aka minstrel is better in almost every way. Red Line minstrels are scary scary nukers). RK itself isn't bad and has two very playable DPS trait lines.  Champion and Guardian are both rather fun imo but if you like neither give Captain a try, best jack of all trades class.  Beorning is like easymode for the solo game. Blue line has ridiculous self healing power and Redline does stupid stupid damage with Thrash and Execute. The downside is Beornings don't bring a lot to the table for group content. Also their AoE is kind of meh compared to other melee classes."
lotro,34gh7s,Ambassador_Buta,3,Fri May 1 06:20:27 2015 UTC,"I've always heard good things about minstrels, but I always felt kind of turned off by them. The idea at yelling at an orc until it dies is kind of weird ... but I suppose it's all part of embodying might and power. I might give it a go.  A Beorning is tempting, as I've never really gotten involved in end game stuff. I tend to just solo on and on and maybe join the occasional group here and there. But I also have a strong affinity for elves since I've got a bit of a roleplaying streak in me. I like to come up with Quenya names and act like a jerk-ass Noldor."
lotro,34gh7s,HB24,2,Fri May 1 06:36:53 2015 UTC,RK is very good fun but it's literally just a fantasy mage. If you're into the lore you won't like it

lotro,34gh7s,exploderator,5,Fri May 1 15:13:00 2015 UTC,"The company tried to avoid moria and look how that turned out :) For what it's worth, moria is awesome now, and is one of the most intricately and well designed maps in the game.  So lore-rich, massive, spooky. Absolutely no doubt that you can bypass it, and/or just run from one end to the other.  Is it going to be more fun/less of a grind/less soul-sucking?  Abosulutely not.  You're talking about getting your level up as high as possible in the trollshaws/eregion/forochel with XP doublers which have to be purchased, grinding skirmishes and instances in the mid level range, and then starting lorien at too low of a level.  If somehow that sounds more fun to you than exploring the deeps and appreciating the lore, then best of luck to you!"
lotro,34gh7s,notwhoithink,2,Fri May 1 11:14:10 2015 UTC,"But it all comes back to not wanting to disappear into the long dark for days or weeks again. I know I'm not the only one as I've heard a lot of grumbling about Moria, but has anyone found a way to generally avoid it? Or at least pass through it superficially without having to level up there?   Yeah, Moria is nowhere near as daunting as it used to be.  When it first came out I avoided it like the plague.  Since the revamp it is actually quite pleasant.  However, these days you can level up so fast that you really don't need to spend much time in Moria at all.  If you come into Eregion around level 45-50 you can complete all of Eregion, then make a quick trip through Moria to run the epics, and come out the other side in the Dimrill Dale without much issue and pretty close to on level.  You might need to re-run a few skirmishes or something to fill in a few gaps, but it's very doable.  My problem with Moria these days is that I actually outlevel it far too quickly.   I took a Hunter through there a long, long time ago and got all the way to Western Rohan before they became unplayable. I have no idea what happened, but even the simplest fights seem to end at a very narrow margin of victory. I've tried a lot but I don't think there is much to do.   Yeah, I ran into that on my Hunter as well.  I had a post about this awhile back, but I can't find it via Reddit's search function.  The gist of it was that there was a HUGE gap in armor and weapon capabilities between the L85 Hytbold gear and LIs versus what is available at 90 and above.  There are guild recipes for armor and melee weapons that you will want to get to gear up, and you'll want to trade in those L85 2nd age bows for L90+ 3rd agers.  Once I did that the  fights became much more manageable, though they still were more difficult than the on-level fights that I was having in the 80's."
lotro,34gh7s,krazymouse,1 point,Fri May 1 14:43:24 2015 UTC,"RE hunter in Western Rohan:  I only ever had trouble at one point, the rest was a cakewalk.  The thing that got me was some of the mounted mobs in instances did ranged damage, and would kill me too fast.  BUT... I never did Wildermore until well after Western Rohan came out.  So I was at L85 with a well built Hytbold set, then I leveled up a few levels to complete Wildermore, and only then did I head out into Western Rohan.  The extra few levels helped a lot.  I also had about the best jewelry, a top notch L85 First Age bow, all the deeds possible, traits, etc., and freely used pots, scrolls, hope tokens and good food, because you only quest once, so why not grease the wheels?  I did find that I was getting weak though, somewhere out around level 90, and I ended up using lots of quest reward armour and jewelry, when if finally got good enough to beat the top-end level 85 stuff.  You do have to watch your build carefully, but it's not too hard, and there are some good drops along the way."
lotro,34gh7s,RJFerret,2,Fri May 1 19:02:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it was definitely around 90-93 when it started getting much more difficult.  I had still been using Hytbold gear at that point, since it was almost always better than quest reward.  At least in pure armor numbers.  I'm beginning to think that perhaps some of that gear might have had a little less armor value but much better bonuses that could have made it easier.  Anyway, once my tailor crafted a couple of sets of guild-specific armor I found it a lot smoother."

The toon would just need a few more cosmetic slots, one for each possible weapon, so that the real weapon would be over-ridden by the cosmetic if in use.  A guardian would thus have four cosmetic weapon slots, left weapon, right weapon, dual weapon, and shield, and which ever were applicable would override the real weapon.  And as a hunter, it would take the cosmetic pain out of some of the huge ugly clubs I've had to pack at various times for the stats."

Crowd Control used to be a must in all instances, not so much now.  im VERY VERY glad when i see a good LM in my group!"

lotro,34f49s,Mrbobby90,3,Thu Apr 30 20:19:45 2015 UTC,"Huge utility.  Loved easy and fast questing solo to the cap.  It's funny, I'd say not an essential part of any fellow, but an absolute asset to any raid.  LM fire is a must in the moors, for example.  You get maaaaaasive AoE sustained DPS, and also heave some heals.  You'll hear them referred to as batteries because you can restore power to your fellows/raid members."
lotro,34f49s,7h3C47,2,Thu Apr 30 21:00:35 2015 UTC,"I've played at every cap except 75 as a LM. I can say LMs are one of the most fun and versatil classes in lotro. We can't have just one job. We got simplified a bit with the trait point system, and I think we do too much damage now, but it could have been worse. These are raid observations.   In red a LM can do the second most aoe damage only behind a champion. We do great moors damage and even with a nerfed SI its till pretty nice to throw it on the healer.   Blue is surprisingly really useful against big single targets, Durchest, durins bane, and Ivar are some examples. The massive survivability boost from the health and mit bonuses in blue are great. Then fellowship friend with the bear makes your 6 man take 5% less damage nearly constantly.   Yellow took some time for me to get used to but having wind lore be able to spread and refresh fire/frost lore really doesn't make it so bad. Mezes are still as good as ever and bane flare is about to get better in the next update.   In general LMs are also decent spot healers with beacon of hope and water lore. I stopped many a wipe with a properly timed beacon. Power isn't as important as it used to be, but with a aware LM, DPS chars can really just let loose with little worry. Also Its hilarious when you have 2 good LMs spam releaseing/resummoning bears to force taunt because your tank got tripled deved."
lotro,34f49s,Collegenoob,2,Fri May 1 03:30:57 2015 UTC,The only thing I absolutely hate about playing a LM is their inability to run and gun. You have to plant your feet to use 95% of your skills. Including your CC ones. No running away while stunning. No sir! Take it like a man and hope you can get the spell off before you become a puddle.

(b) it's maybe not always the easiest class to get a group with... e.g. even for 3 mans many people will view the healing & DPS as being a bit weak, and for bigger groups an issue is that the debuffs don't stack, so whilst one LM is near-essential for any raid, two makes less sense because the debuffs don't really 'stack'. so if say you are in a kin that already has a really competent LM who plays at the same time of day as you, levelling an LM with a view to getting involved in group play may not be the best idea."
lotro,34f49s,Batfink16,1 point,Wed May 6 16:19:40 2015 UTC,"Late reply here, but LM, along with Captain, were 2 of the best and most unique LOTRO classes in my opinion. They provided so much utility to groups, and were basically the jack of all trades. With current instance design and the addition of skill trees though, they have become fairly one dimensional, which is very unfortunate, and resulted in me not playing anymore.   I don't necessarily know if I would be ""glad"" having them in my group. They used to be very skill dependent, less so now. They do good dps if specced, decent heals if specced, and the best cc in the game if specced right. The problem is, cc isn't really needed anymore and other classes do better damage or better heals. If the player is a good player, I'd take him or her anytime though as good players seem to be at a premium now."
lotro,34f49s,ray_falkner,1 point,Thu May 7 14:49:45 2015 UTC,"After these 6 good comments, let me add one thing that will constantly hanging in your mind in your playtime as a LM:     ""God please don't make it resisted this time, don't re... GOD DARN IT it got resisted! Resist and resist and resist! WTF!""   Joking aside, I love Lore Master class. It's my personal favorite. In the younger days of LotRO the class is unique as in (AFAIK) no other MMO class at that time dedicates in CC and group support so much as a Lore Master that- even surviving solo against on-level landscape mobs are a feat in itself; on those days Lore Masters HAVE to know how to kite and CC for their own survival, no brute-forcing out of that..    Nowadays personally I see that as a LM it is less emphasis on the pure CC/support but more of a general DPS class with good CC capabilities and on-demand healing when the conditions call for it.    EDIT: Playing as a Warden and in a high latency connection too, I love to have LM in a group, definitely 10 out of 10. Simply because now I have a portable external battery for my power hungry gambits and also give me another layer of security for the group's healer (against healer's low power situation or accidentally peeling a mob off me, LM's CC is an excellent stop-gap measure -IF it is not resisted that is- until I regain control of the situation)."

lotro,34eycp,Ma-ki,2,Thu Apr 30 16:16:53 2015 UTC,Champ has much bigger dps in the endgame. Beorning has crazy survivability but the damage in human form is weak and even in bear you won't beat a champ.   Play champ if you want to be useful endgame. beorning is very nice for roleplay and its a nice playstyle too. great heals in yellow line. more versatile than champ thats for sure.

Champs can clear adds like no one's business, but even in the moors the bears in my group charge straight to the back of the craid and don't go down almost at all/ever.  Take that with a grain of salt; the bears I know who run in the moors on Landy are great players overall which undoubtedly helps."

They are typically aoe dps.  Have you considered burgs?

lotro,34cd8c,Riffine,3,Thu Apr 30 04:25:19 2015 UTC,"Threat was revamped to make it less of a mystery they said.  Basically any tank class gets a threat multiple to any dps skill, and threat skills were removed or replaced with force taunts.    So instead of coordinating with the group to build and manage threat, just open with aoe dps like the new ranged tactical skill guards can have.  DPS can unload as much as they want.  If they do manage to pull off you, a force taunt brings the mob back and gives you their threat amount plus.  For raids that require tank swapping, the two tanks just use force taunts instead of matching threat."

I level up 2 chars right now and go with Scholar (Weaponsmith Guild) / Tinker (Jeweler Guild).. Gives me consumables (food, pots), colors, metal weapons & jewelery (and runestones for your Keeper).  I guess the youngster Scholar/Collector team can make a tour though the lower level ruins, as monsters are all grey then. Also.. lowlevel metals / wood are all over the landscape.. use a horse (most annoying is to mount after each collecting).. or runspeed buff.  Buying them outright in Auction House can be in multiple G / stack of 100 if available, for lowlevel stuff... so i guess, a few rounds of furious collecting (the new mains have to level it anyway), for having a few stacks and then getting a crafting buff from the shop and go to town on the workbench."

Whether or not making the switch is worth it depends on how much you care for re-leveling your current professions. Tier1-4 shouldn't be all that bad but it's your call."

lotro,348nqh,HolyGigi,3,Wed Apr 29 06:02:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I began playing lotro not knowing what to expect. I've been F2P for a long time, but at a certain moment I knew I'd play this game for quite a while still. You can get the quad pack for not too much. I've had many breaks with lotro, but somehow, I always came back."
lotro,348nqh,Torwig,2,Wed Apr 29 08:47:20 2015 UTC,"If your plan is to play with the mindset of ""not going to spend real money"" or ""cannot spend real money"" then no, it's  unfortunately not worth it.   Turbine could do a lot to improve lotro into a real F2P game but I doubt they will do it.  It is possible to earn TP in game through various Deeds (basically achievements) and technically possible to buy a lot of the content in game with it. It's not really worth it though since the grind to do so is massive.  You can generally get away with spending something like $25-35 and be set for the most part though.  Step 1: Wait for the Quad Pack to go on sale for either $20 (happens several times a year) or $10 (happens like once a year, last time it was Black Friday 2014). This will get you the first 4 expansions and let you get  from 50-85 in levels.  Step 2: Obtain Steely Dawn pack. Can usually be found during Steam sales for like $5. This gets you 1000 TP and the Evendim Quest pack.  Step3: Use 1000 TP to buy Quest Packs of your choice. Angmar or Forochel are decent options. Either will take you to 50 and into Moria.  Step4: Obtain 1 month of VIP. Create all the characters you intend to create while that month is active. This will get you various unlocks such as trait slots and other things permanently.  If you are patient and want to enjoy the game it's definitely possible to do so on a relative budget. As an MMO it feels a little dated but the world of Middle Earth is a great place to explore, RP, and adventure in."

lotro,348nqh,Cardiumm,3,Wed Apr 29 08:23:07 2015 UTC,Imo it is totally worth it. I played on Brandywine and it is easy to find people/kins to play with.

If you do decide to give it a try I would recommend it Landroval server. It's not the most populated (that would be Brandywine) but it has a good community and is Roleplay friendly if you are into that kind of thing.

It's been very OP but I'm hearing from some players on Landroval that the Bear has a lot of trouble late/post game. Have you experienced the same?"
lotro,341hrl,WelCZa,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:10:06 2015 UTC,"Hey, lvl 50-something bear here. At higher lvl, when you have enough trait points, you can ivest them in mixed trait setup (mainly red with come blue) and can reach full wrath within ~10 seconds of fight (with some pre-fight preparation). If you are interested let me know and I can log-in to game to show you my main trait set-up. On that OPness, at higher lvls, beorns DPS is not increasing so rapidly as at lower imho.  edit: added some words"
lotro,341hrl,Darchseraph,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:22:49 2015 UTC,"Bear is an...interesting class. You've already encountered the main weakness: an inability to generate wrath very quickly when entering combat. Imo they need an ability like the other classes that has like a 2 minute cooldown but can instantly get them to Full Wrath or very high Wrath.   It does get better as you level since you will know your rotation a little better and Man Form damage actually isn't too shabby in Red-Line. Once you max out Red Line (Around Moria) you should invest 6 trait points into the ""Hardened Heart"" trait in Blue Line. This allows Hearten to restore quite a bit of Wrath over time and makes it a bit easier to sustain wrath through multiple enemies.  Also once you get your 20% free ""execute"" ability your DPS becomes a little more RNG but Execute hits very hard and becomes free after 20% of bear attacks."
lotro,341hrl,WelCZa,1 point,Mon Apr 27 18:47:37 2015 UTC,They do have class trait skill called Bracing Roar to gain 100% wrath and some health.  edit: did some changes to that link (original didn't work as intended)
lotro,341hrl,Darchseraph,1 point,Tue Apr 28 06:34:53 2015 UTC,Yeah but 30 minute one-offs don't really count since they can't be used with any sort of frequency; which counts for both PvE and PvP.  If they reduced it to 5-10 minutes it would be a lot more useful overall. Or if they introduced a skill that had 2-3 minute cooldown that was +50-75 Wrath.
lotro,341hrl,WelCZa,1 point,Tue Apr 28 07:24:55 2015 UTC,"I didn't realize that you know about that skill at all, so I am sorry and couldn't agree with you more, that CD realy sucks (as all race skill CDs)."
lotro,341hrl,baue8673,1 point,Wed Apr 29 05:13:22 2015 UTC,"I think Hardened Heart is a required trait for leveling beornings. No matter what specialization you pick, the first points go into that. After a few points, it turns hearten into a wrath gainer. Combine that with Ferocious Roar and I've been able to sustain wrath quite a bit easier. The beorning has been an alt I play occasionally, so I've not progressed into higher levels and seen the other wrath generation options. But it makes the 20s and 30s pleasant."
lotro,340hy9,tanstaafI,17,Mon Apr 27 09:41:24 2015 UTC,"Things have changed in the last couple years, so careful with old info.  Standards are now two different things: an item you slot on your paper-doll and a skill, depending on how you put points into the trait-trees.  they used to be one-in-the-same.  as others have said, you get the ITEM in the lower levels, around 20.  this goes in your ""ranged"" slot on your paperdoll, the same slot as a Herald Armament (we used to have to choose between herald or banner, but no longer do).  the item is just a passive buff, that is all.  you WANT one equipped at ALL times in combat.  these are made by tailors, yes, check the auction hall (or make your own!)  once you get ~21 points to spend in trait-trees, you can unlock a SKILL that will allow you to place a banner on the ground.  this is the group-buff/AOE-attack/debuff.  you can put up to 5 points in the banner skills.  the banner is placed on top of the monster you are targeting (looks like they get skewered!)  the fifth point allows you to choose where to place the banner.  hope i understood you and am clear!"

Using a standard (the banner thing you stick in the ground) is now a skill, like this: https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Standard_of_War_(Skill).  Standards that Tailors make just help boost stats and don't have to be ""used"" during battle.  There are 4 herald types (https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Captain#Heralds), but these are also skills (you don't have to do anything special), just summon the type you need.  I normally run with the Herald Archer - it does some decent damage.  Armaments are now passive and act like skins that you can swap in to change the appearance of your herald.  It is kind of weird how to get them now though.  You have to have a Tailor craft the armament (any tier), then take them to a captain trainer to barter whatever herald skin that you want."

Unless things have changed drastically, the herald (archer at least) is higher dps when soloing than using a banner.  I'd assume the normal heralds are too and they were very useful while I was leveling to off tank and heal and what not.  By all means try it but I think you'll find the herald better solo.  Leveling a captain was pretty slow, the other char I leveled at the same time was a champion, and the difference was amazing - Champion is so much faster.

Apparently, they're doing a server move and hardware upgrade before they start any of the transfers. The new hardware is a requirement for the server moves, and they want to monitor the results of the upgrade to figure out how much consolidation they can actually afford to do."

lotro,33wnh2,Wubbalicious,5,Sun Apr 26 09:43:52 2015 UTC,Well I dont play on Riddermark but concerning yout thought about server changing I'd recommend you to wait a bit because a server migration where characters form low pop servers can be trasfered to higher pop servers for free is planned after the next update and this would save you 25$.
lotro,33wnh2,finn2605,3,Sun Apr 26 11:48:50 2015 UTC,"Eh--kind of.  Riddermark is indeed a low population server, and many, myself included have already left in favor of Landy/Brandy etc.  One thing I just want to throw in here is that, and correct me if I'm wrong, they haven't actually officially confirmed how the transfer dynamic will work, unlike what you imply.  Specifically, they haven't confirmed that the free transfers would be from low-to-high population servers.  Think about it for a second.  A server like Brandywine would crumple under the weight of a big influx of people.  The server lag there is already terrible.  I'm on Landy now after leaving ridder and the lag got so much worse even just with the influx of people who were willing to dish in order to move.  The leading consensus that I've heard is rather that they might just be consolidating low population servers.  That way, the system load is more evenly distributed and they don't miss out on the cash cow that is people paying $25 to transfer where they want to go with their own free will.  If they gave people on low pop servers the choice to transfer anywhere for free, they're throwing money out the window.  Now, that being said, the advice being given to Wubba is still the same: wait.  The essential problem of you being on a low pop server is going to be solved.  All I'm saying, is that we have no confirmation that the way it will be solved is what you indicated."
lotro,33wnh2,7h3C47,4,Sun Apr 26 14:23:32 2015 UTC,well no it's not confirmed yet however the Vyvanne (community whatever from turbine) said it's planned. http://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Server_Moves_and_Migrations

Sword is probably the better choice (parry chance is a lot more beneficial than a small bleed) but I go spear because it looks better. Class deeds are super important to do asap because they help you memorize gambits and trait points which are always useful. And don't get demotivated if you don't seem to be able to do things other wardens can do! It's all about practice and skill, if you just take some time everyday to remember what every gambit (and gambit chain in general) you'll do so much better than just doing random orders of spear, shield, and fist."

lotro,33pnli,hueresiech,6,Fri Apr 24 14:04:41 2015 UTC,"I think once you get to L100, you just need to work hard and put together a full essence armour set and get the gold jewelry from the guys in Dol Amroth.  And if you really want to work hard, you need to have alternates for a couple of pieces of armour, so you can switch between maxing out your physical or tactical mastery, that's your maximum damage set, or else switch in pieces with high mitigations and morale for high survivability in some raids.  So far I only have the max physical mastery set built, and holy shit, it really is hard hitting.  As for how I chose what essences, I just added up totals.  There are 6 pieces with 4 slots each, for 24 total essence slots.  You don't want to change your pants and jacket because they cost twice as many gold tokens as the boots, gloves, shoulders and head.  So you put your best and always-will-keep essences on the pants and jacket.  Then fill up the other slots with whatever you need.  I have two pieces that are pure physical mastery, I can change for ones that add mitigations, when I get them built.  Aside from that, I got the first set of gold jewelry from DA, but I got two other gold rings from doing big battles, each one has an essence slot and really high stats, so I added essences to them, and they are as good as trying to get the second gold jewelry set that would use up the ring slots, and I don't care for the set bonus.  Good luck :)"

Some stats have a cap which makes things easy, but if you know the answers to the questions above, it will become apparent which stats you need to beef up in which categories for those that have no cap--or the equilibrium you want to strike if you're not putting all of your stat-eggs in one stat-basket, so to speak."

I can't remember the last time I saw them churn out stuff like this.  The good news is that they aren't selling it as complete and perfect, on BR at least.  We just have to hope they keep the same attitude when it goes live, and pray that first hotfix after launch addresses any key bugs."
lotro,33m7qu,7h3C47,1 point,Fri Apr 24 11:02:24 2015 UTC,"It depends on your definition of ""ready.""   There seem to be no obvious problems with ""normal stuff"" -- graphics, quest lines, towns, etc.   Itemization is (as has been for ages) less than good. Beornings still have no gear beyond level 50 (i.e. Might based Medium Armour) for example. However, that particular issue is promised for a patch following release."

I'm finishing my PhD this summer so I don't have a lot of time to play but I'm just running around the Shire doing hobbit deeds to blow off steam and it's excellent. I don't have the TP for the Beorning expansion but I like to get it eventually. Welcome back!
lotro,33hwst,koifishkid,3,Wed Apr 22 18:44:34 2015 UTC,Good luck finishing up!!
lotro,33hwst,SupremeMugwump_ICoW,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:43:40 2015 UTC,You wouldn't happen to know the best server for RP would you? I'm currently on Brandywine and I'm honestly not that big of a fan. Asked them about RP in /World and they thought I was LFF a Instance.
lotro,33hwst,Mastengwe,3,Thu Apr 23 04:36:51 2015 UTC,Landroval is the RP server.
lotro,33hwst,Kheldras,1 point,Thu Apr 23 05:32:39 2015 UTC,Is it pretty active? I had initially chosen Brandywine because all sources (including you fine people in this subreddit) had pointed to it as being a good and active server.
lotro,33hwst,freedaemons,1 point,Thu Apr 23 12:35:22 2015 UTC,"I second Landroval, its ""Rp Preferred"" but people tend do be slightly more easygoing, and you find RP easily.  I do have a Battleteddy at 32 and fun with him.. people say hes neither fish nor meat at high levels though."
lotro,33hwst,Mastengwe,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:03:02 2015 UTC,Yeah that's what I've been hearing. I'm still a pretty low level so I'm just starring aghast at all the things dying while I barely lose any health.  I also want to try to find a good Kin or someone to buddy up with. Schedule probably makes that more difficult though :/ EST and not able to play until 8pmish week days.
lotro,33hwst,legofreak11,1 point,Thu Apr 23 13:08:58 2015 UTC,"Landy is more international than Brandy because people come just to immerse in a more lore-friendly community environment, so you shouldn't have too bad a time here!"
lotro,33hwst,comicspolitics,1 point,Sun May 3 23:39:50 2015 UTC,"I was actually named a Lore Master by some in the chat despite being a Hobbit Hunter during a conversation this afternoon regarding Tom Bombadil, the nature of Eru/Ainur/Valar/Maiar, and the history of Melkor/Morgoth and his lieutenant Sauron. Fun times."
lotro,33j054,Chaos1172,12,Wed Apr 22 22:19:40 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend a Captain - they're tough enough to be tanky but provide healing and other benefits to encourage grouping if they already have a tank.   I've solo-ed everything one might expect to solo on level as a captain, and had no trouble finding groups when I wanted one."
lotro,33j054,Belhaven,5,Wed Apr 22 22:55:19 2015 UTC,"My only reservation is that Cappie is a very Jack of All trades skills. I've played every class a decent amount and Captain is just a little.. boring to play solo.  There's nothing wrong with its actual abilities but it doesn't have the tankiness of Guard, doesn't have the versatility and DoTs of Warden, doesn't have the AoE ability of Champion, doesn't have the stealth of Burglar, and doesn't have the OMG T3 Thrash just crit for wtfbbq amount fun of a rampaging Bear.  It's much more fun in Fellowships of course. I would only pick Cappie if you intend to be duoing a lot of content personally."
lotro,33j054,Darchseraph,5,Thu Apr 23 01:34:21 2015 UTC,But Cappie has fair amount of all of them (except burgs stealth). But could be a bit slow to lvl up.   But every group loves Captains.
lotro,33j054,WelCZa,3,Thu Apr 23 07:37:33 2015 UTC,Thanks guys i think i've narrowed it down between Hunter and Guardian. Will probably play about with both and see what feels right
lotro,33j054,WelCZa,2,Wed Apr 22 23:01:53 2015 UTC,"And I second Guard, he can kill mobs slower than Hunt, but doesn't have to fight every mob separately."
lotro,33j054,serow081reddit,1 point,Thu Apr 23 07:43:37 2015 UTC,"I second Hunter, because that's my main :D"
lotro,33j054,Mrbobby90,3,Thu Apr 23 01:28:06 2015 UTC,"It would cost you some Turbine points if you plan on playing free to play, but warden is my favorite class by far. They are tanks that deal far more damage than guardians and can survive nearly forever with their morale taps and self heals.   Edit: they also have teleportation skills like hunters, except they can't port entire fellowships."
lotro,33j054,WelCZa,5,Thu Apr 23 04:59:33 2015 UTC,I'd definitely choose Warden.
lotro,33j054,Rom709,3,Thu Apr 23 07:49:58 2015 UTC,"If you feel like spending some money the Beorning has been a lot of fun to solo play. Melee fighter with trees for tanking, dps, or healing depending on your poison of choice and can use Light or Medium armor so aesthetically you can have some different looks. Plus you turn into a bear and get some pretty awesome skills through that. I'm currently a level 10 fighting mobs 4-5 levels higher than me and having no difficulty in trashing them and surviving. I don't think my health has dropped more than 1/5th yet.   That being said, when I used to play actively about 4 years ago the Hunter was the best option for solo exploration and story. You've got to be a little more clever with your attacks and start positions since you can be a little squishy against some of the more powerful mobs, but you can rack up some massive damage and way back when you could switch pretty seamlessly between ranged and close fighting. The teleportation skills are almost necessary if you don't want to spend a ton of time backtracking."
lotro,33j054,RyanRomanov,2,Thu Apr 23 12:45:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I play as a hunter, and if you're just looking to do some story stuff and explore the landscapes, it's perfect. The ability to set jump-points and the teleportation skills you get (e.g., Travel to Michel Delving) are paramount to traveling around the vast landscapes without running for hours.  However, it will be hard to explore the areas where the enemies have extremely high health/damage unless your level is sufficiently higher. Your options are usually stay and die or run and live. I'm thinking of the Angmar / Agamaur ( the north-eastern areas)."
lotro,33j054,ray_falkner,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:41:39 2015 UTC,I should also note that I don't enjoy healing classes and i main both a rogue and a warrior tank in WoW
lotro,33j054,Kheldras,5,Wed Apr 22 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"Actually you'll be surprised of how terrifying is the degree of devastation a healing class in LotRO (RuneKeeper and Minstrel) could deliver when traited for DPS.    The Burglar class of LotRO is different from your average cookie cutter backstab happy MMO assassin class, well at least it's used to be but currently when traited in red line, the Burglar now finally switch job to a full time stabby-stab assassin. The other two specialization options available for the Burglar stay truer to the original, bringing utilities and clever tricks in group play instead of mindless DPS.    For warrior-like tanking, you got two solid options here: Guardian and Warden. Both could easily solo most contents in the game currently, but if what you're after is ""an easy time not a stressful time"" then a Guardian is a better choice because the Warden class' mechanics has a quite steep learning curve and definitely not a forgiving one at it either.    Champion class is a worthy and honorable mention too, a melee warrior with high resilience. (Much) more emphasis in melee AoE and DPS while soaking some hits rather than tanking like a fortress wall though. Well unless your definition of fortress wall is a wall made of blades and axes then... that's a Champ alright."
lotro,33j054,xKINGMOBx,3,Wed Apr 22 22:56:49 2015 UTC,Minstrel traited red is a monster... even more so if you learned to kite.
lotro,33j02c,th3eviltwin,7,Wed Apr 22 22:19:03 2015 UTC,"A key thing to remember is that to duo most of the landscape content (Normal mobs, occasional Signature or Elite) is that you don't want to pair a ranged class with a melee class since normal mobs can be burned down fast enough that the melee class is going to be chasing things everywhere and not getting many hits in.  With that in mind you have a few options:  RK + Assailment Warden. This gives you a solid ranged combo and the ability to have  Healer + Tank in any fellowship, making just finding DPS Much Much easier.  RK + Lore Master: LM is an incredibly good and flexible class. Bog Wardens and RKs will melt things at range. LMs can also trait Ancient Master and be great Debuffers. Bear pet can tank most small fellowship bosses just fine with RK Heals.  RK + Hunter: Lots of damage. Not a great amount of versatility though.  RK + RK: Same effect as Hunter + RK really; great damage but you lose out on versatility."
lotro,33j02c,Darchseraph,2,Thu Apr 23 01:30:31 2015 UTC,I duo with Warden (red line) and RK (fire). Great combo.
lotro,33j02c,posterchild,3,Thu Apr 23 12:46:43 2015 UTC,"I am a Hunter, and I partner up with a Rune-Keeper (I DPS, she heals. Invincibility is a nice thing to have :D), and that works really well for us. But as I am thinking about it, a Champion might work better, because Heavy Armour."
lotro,33j02c,SpookyScary401,3,Wed Apr 22 22:25:37 2015 UTC,"I played RK and Champion for a long time with my buddy, it worked great for us, when needed I could permaheal him so there's no possibility he could die, we could do group content alone without any problems that way but most of the time we would both just killing stuff, me the ranged mobs and he the others."
lotro,33j02c,finn2605,1 point,Thu Apr 23 08:32:58 2015 UTC,"I second the Rune-Keeper plus Lore-Master duo.  A kinmate and I leveled from 20-60 together and it worked out really well. I used the bear pet for the forced aggro in case we got overwhelmed, which really didn't happen often.  I tried RK and Champ, but the RK burned down most of the npcs at range before my Champ could usually get more than a hit in."

New zone without the pressure to get to a new cap before people are willing to let you in their group for the instances is great.  I think the only thing I'm secretly dreading is that I don't run essence gear now, and the new gear for U16 has 5 essence slots per piece for 6 pieces.

Someone else said it, but it really does have a calming effect. The developers didn't feel the need to saturate every square foot of the world in mobs, and what you get are some incredible vistas that are worth visiting for the sole purpose of seeing. Graphically, sure, it's dated, but I personally enjoy wandering for the sake of experiencing the world."
lotro,337pyn,AfterburnerX,10,Mon Apr 20 19:08:19 2015 UTC,"It's incredibly immersive. I always get the sense that I'm walking around and exploring Middle-earth, which isn't something I experience very often with MMOs. (For example: I enjoy SWTOR, but it doesn't really feel much like I'm in the Star Wars universe - it feels like WoW with a Star Wars skin.)"
lotro,337pyn,alcyonewinter,3,Mon Apr 20 18:13:13 2015 UTC,Agreed. SWTOR could have been so much more better than what it is.
lotro,337pyn,CoreBounty,9,Tue Apr 21 16:09:03 2015 UTC,"LOTRO has almost always been praised for its environments and music. Some areas might feel a little dated, but that's because some areas are 8 years old. Otherwise, just walking around Middle Earth has a very calming effect, something that many other MMOs cannot do."
lotro,337pyn,serow081reddit,4,Mon Apr 20 10:05:06 2015 UTC,the music is beautiful and awesome. My favourite is the music in Estenement Rohan; When no one is at home i turn the subwoofer on and put the music full blast when i charge into a band of orcs and engage in mounted combat. The mounted combat music just encourages you like king theoden's speech right before the rohirrin charged the orcs laying siege to minas tirith.

I don't have much of an MMO background - few hours of WoW and Runes of Magic - but I can tell you I'm very pleased with this game.  The setting and graphics are excellent, combat is fun, and the quests are satisfying.  It took me a little while to figure out the UI, but at a level 15 champion now and I'm comfortable with it.  I recommend it."
lotro,337pyn,paulkardos,2,Tue Apr 21 06:20:54 2015 UTC,"Ive played so many MMO's and none make me feel as submerged as LOTRO. The areas, the quests,its all a fantastic journey through Tolkiens wonderful world. I always end up coming back to LOTRO, this time around Im back till the end.  I hope you enjoy your experience."
lotro,337pyn,Xynotix,1 point,Tue Apr 21 08:35:23 2015 UTC,"Yes you'll enjoy LOTRO. The only downside is that you actually NEED to invest money in order to enjoy the game to its fullest. Many people say that you there is no need to spend money since you can farm TP (shop's currency). If you consider that you get 5-10 TP from each deed (objective which takes from 10 min to many hours) and you need more than 15k to unlock all areas, quests, expansions, mounts, the FUCKING wallet (you have 2g limit and then you need to ""remove"" that limit from your wallet) etc etc (as you can see I am talking about important parts of the gameplay and the whole experience that you get, and not for boosts, cosmetic shits etc) you most probably need to pay for it. Some people suggested me to create new characters on different servers and complete the deeds on the starting areas to farm TP ,since TP are account bind. But come on, I am not going to spend hours of greeding with chars that I am going to delete, so I buy 1 quest pack for my main character. I am playing LOTRO for less than a week, I am in love with that game. The community, the RP aspect, NPCs, areas, buildings, they're sooo brilliant but I can tell that the game is ""pay to enjoy more"" after a while.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4duJdeKTwHY"

lotro,333zh8,WelCZa,1 point,Sun Apr 19 08:44:13 2015 UTC,yes. Give it a try. You have nothing to lose. If you are a Tolkein fan you will definitely enjoy this mmo . I recommend a high population server such as Brandywine. On low population servers it is extremely difficult to find full groups for group content.
lotro,333zh8,spacevoyage,3,Tue Apr 21 16:02:58 2015 UTC,"If you don't start on your own, but with friend(s) it is definitely worthy whatever server you choose.

And you don't have to buy them all at once ;)"

lotro,333zh8,exploderator,1 point,Sun Apr 19 18:26:56 2015 UTC,"Ouch, that is too bad.  I will say this:  If you love the books, you will still enjoy the game, even if you can only play the first part of it easily.  It's too bad you can't download only the first part to save data, but at least with Steam you can pause the download and resume, so you can just let it run at night, and when it is finally done you will have many weeks or even months of fun playing.  You might want to grind some points to get an expansion pack, but it could be worth it, even if you don't want to bother playing it all the way through."
lotro,333zh8,Iluminatos13,1 point,Mon Apr 20 01:39:48 2015 UTC,In that case what you can do is have a main char in one slot and use the other as a tp farmer: the starting (and free) areas have very easy slayer deeds and you can easily gather about 200/weekend. Delete the character and repeat.  Your case is a damn pity. Unfair :(
lotro,333zh8,exploderator,1 point,Mon Apr 20 08:21:24 2015 UTC,"Your case is a damn pity. Unfair :(   I agree.  I've met so many really wonderful people in LOTRO from all over the world, and I always feel sad for the people who have to struggle through without ever being able to pay at all, especially people from other parts of the world like u/axillarypuma.  That's just a shitty bind to be stuck in.  It makes me wish there was a way for other players to donate TP, but I guess that would be terribly ripe for abuse, and we know Turbine just doesn't care enough to want that kind of risk exposure."
lotro,333zh8,TwinkleToes_321,3,Mon Apr 20 17:50:32 2015 UTC,"The game isn't dead but I strongly suggest choosing a more populated server such as Brandywine. I haven't played in a while but I doubt leveling without quest packs has changed much. It is possible to level without paying for anything but you would probably be very bored with the game by the time you were done. I had a friend who leveled without paying anything to level cap and it took him 3 years. And even if you do get to the current level cap you will be able to do very little, if any of the content without buying the expansion. Without paying levels 1~34 should be a breeze. Overall, if you can't pay I suggest not doing it. If you are dedicated enough, go for it. Going to http://mmohut.com might help you find a decent free to play mmo. Personally I have enjoyed Rift, Archeage, and Neverwinter quite a bit, Neverwinter the most."
lotro,333zh8,PPontex,3,Sun Apr 19 08:50:06 2015 UTC,"I'd add that without paying, while grinding some TP from deeds, you can get as far as level 50 easily."
lotro,333zh8,spacevoyage,1 point,Sun Apr 19 19:04:58 2015 UTC,Yes Brandywine is the best choice for a high population server. I paid more than $100 to transfer my characters from a low population server like Landroval to Brandywine.

The Madness of Vanyalos Minor polish to emotes and flower picking thinned enemies some, reduced health of Morgul captains The first time she sees the Anduin, Vanyalos stands still rather than runs when the orcs arrive Tentakrul and co should run to the player now removed some extra orcs off in the reeds and on the road who are no longer needed   The Ruined City Instance:   The challenge chest no longer appears in tier 1 Thrug has his own, proper, tier 1 and tier 2 reward chests Awakened Spirit red aura buff: Now takes a full 20 seconds before the spirit explodes, so it should go off somewhere useful now. No more purple eye. Instead, 3 seconds before explosion the fear head comes up over it Awakened Spirit blue aura buff: increased, tooltip text has more useful info General mobs now have more health Lumithil's random slash is now a ""Lunging Slash"" and does much less damage. Thrug starts at half health. He does have health regen so don't let it creep up! Thrug has a new three part attack (front, side, side) inspired by an adorable drawing on the feedback forums Jukotor no longer Fell Feints anyone but his current target Jukotor now uses an interruptible rally cry to buff his mobs Orcs and trolls are now decked out in their Morgul best   Imbuement:   In the Legendary Items panel, Imbued items and their legacies have shiny new tooltips. The maximum possible DPS (or class item main legacy stat) for an imbued legendary item should now actually match for first, second, and third age legendary items. If your legendary item DPS (or class item main legacy stat) has been ranked up, then that legacy will automatically receive some item experience upon imbuement.

lotro,32qn9l,ceeller,4,Thu Apr 16 02:18:19 2015 UTC,"as ceeller said, warden, if played well, is realy fun class to play. he is kind of selfish cappy (I have lots of buffs and lots of heals but only I can get them) but without tha pet :) With warden you have to thing few seconds ahead as he is only medium armour class and his survivability heavy relies on his heals.  On the other side, guardian is a fortress, he can soak up lots of damage (he has higher mitigations caps i guess), so you have lots of time to think of your next move.  Both are great solo, but guard seem to be a little bit slower to lvl to me.   Hope my post does make sense, because i just came home from night shift and can't think very clearly :)"
lotro,32qn9l,WelCZa,2,Thu Apr 16 05:56:12 2015 UTC,"There is so very much content past SoM that I recommend you do not start a new toon, just grab an old one. Rohan has multiple major regions with endless quest chains, then again in Western Rohan, 4 or 5 regions with 50+ quests in each in addition to the Epics. Then you get into Gondor and face even more regions overflowing with quests. All that is if you skip the fairly loaded Great River area. Why repeat early content when you have such an insurmountable wall of new material in front of you?"
lotro,32qn9l,xKINGMOBx,2,Thu Apr 16 09:47:50 2015 UTC,"I'd go with a Warden if I had to choose between the two. Guardian gets somewhat irritating because of the low dps, taking forever to kill mobs. However you do get to wear some of the coolest armor in the game. Imo the ranger is the best character because of the high dps and teleporting abilities. Have fun mate"
lotro,32qn9l,NoahTheGooner,2,Thu Apr 16 18:33:01 2015 UTC,"I'm totally biased here, but I absolutely love Guardian. It's solid and very much soloable, and the dps is actually comparatively respectable as you level. You're not gonna break any records or anything, but you can easily pull 15+ mobs and live without batting an eye. Tons of fun.  Also an important consideration: if you're gonna play sporadically, warden might not be the best choice. Memorizing gambits takes comparatively frequent play. It's easier to come back to a guard after a small break than to come back to a warden.  As far as great Landroval kins - Mythgard is a fun one, as is the Department of Holbyt Security. The first is based around the Tolkien Professor's stuff and the second is comprised largely of the lotro community on Twitch.tv. Solid, fun bunch of folks - if you ever wanna chat the DHS folks up, pop in to my twitch channel (some folks nearly live in there).  Welcome back to the game! It's as beautiful as ever :)"
lotro,32ogje,Debunkelizer,6,Wed Apr 15 12:49:57 2015 UTC,"Well I can comment on everything but the last one as I never really got into PvMp.  -in terms of levelling you can really blow through levels when you get to dunland, the whole layout is very smooth to allow quick levelling. Once you get to 85+ it slows down quite a bit. To get to 100 from 65 if you ftp it would take weeks playing like 6 hours a day.  -major change, probably the biggest 2 are the Big battles and trait trees. Big battles are just another grind for jewellery with potential to get drops for legendary weapons and other epic drops. Traits allow more freedom to flip back and forth; dealing damage, tank, and utility. Read a little up on them.   Well the game for me is less fun because of the steady drop in players from when I started six years ago.  It makes me sad looking back at all the people I spent so many hours with who no longer play. Yes, severely. I went from 0-100 in less than two days as a sub, but my first toon was ftp and it took me almost two months of 8 hours a day"
lotro,32ogje,bobthe155,4,Wed Apr 15 14:20:28 2015 UTC,"Levling can be done pretty fast, if that is what you want to do. around 85ish it does slow a bit.. but you can pop some xp scrolls and run skrim  The biggest changes are the Trait Trees. And EPIC Battles. I guess you could say the Beoring would be a big change for you as well.   I can't speak to anything PVMP sorry"
lotro,32ogje,UDE785,3,Wed Apr 15 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"For PvMP, balance is more geared toward RvR than it is 1v1s.  1v1s still happen, and can be fun, however some classes are way more OP than others when it comes to 1v1s.  With RvR, if both sides are organized and well led, you can have some very nice and drawn out fights.      Depending on which server you play on will determine how the overall pvmp experience you'll have.  Some are a ghost towns while others are lag monsters due to lots of folks.  Brandywine was the go to server for a long while, but it seems like folks are starting to migrate away from it due to various reasons.  Gladden has started to pick up with new transfers and a surge of new players (we were the recommended server for new players during a good part of 2014), though there are times it's lacking.  One of the possible upcoming changes, is a new PvMP zone in Osgiliath.  However, not much has been said and it doesn't appear to be in the next big update (U16)."
lotro,32ogje,Kants_Pupil,3,Wed Apr 15 16:36:16 2015 UTC,"I don't level super fast and I probably kept up a level every 2 hours after getting to 85, and that is where it slows down.  There have been some stat revisions, simplifying your stat priorities (ex. Wardens will only really need to build up agility and vit, not agility, might and vit, captains look for vit and might, no longer depending on will if you want to heal, etc.), traits now operate on a tree with points instead of plugging in 7 colored traits, and there are big battles. Questing has a lot of new content, but there are a lot fewer new skirmishes, raids, and instances than you would expect.  Changes in fun are primarily due in who I get to play with. Most of my kins that I ran with have moved on to other games, and my local friends who used to play together are mostly playing WoW or have left MMO's. I still play with some family and their friends, so I still have fun, but it is hard to get back out there and find a fun kin to run raids and bigger content with. That said, if you were a solo player or comfortable with searching for kins, most servers still have good populations for that.  VIP gives a few advantages for leveling speed, including access to all the non-expansion zones without paying TP, like the Great River, Enedwaith, and Wildermore zones. Also, each day your characters will each get 20% of their current level's XP requirement as enhanced XP, working just like if you applied an XP perk or enhanced XP supply item. Other fringe benefits would include occasional gear, buffs, and money from daily and weekly hobbit presents, swift travel at stables (I think you have that from having been VIP in the past though), and crafting guild access (I think that you have to buy that with TP or be VIP to have access). I've got a lifetime sub though, so I can't speak to what actually slows down if you stay premium though.   Welcome back!"
lotro,32ogje,Voloso,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:36:20 2015 UTC,"""Is the game more or less fun for you then a couple of years ago, and why?""  90% of my full friends list no longer plays the game. That now also mostly includes myself as I only log on to check mail every week or two. People moving on is the biggest issue, but it's just a symptom of the other problems. Lack of new content. The content that is released is buggy and boring. Class revamps that were largely uninspiring. The ""soul"" of the game is just not what it was and I think that's the biggest reason most people have moved on."

lotro,32nxgf,Cogito96,5,Wed Apr 15 08:28:47 2015 UTC,I'm not playing actively at the moment but as far as I know Evernight is the most populated EU server.  In general Brandywine and Landroval are the overall most active servers however both if them are US servers. Right now that doesn't make any difference because both EU and US servers are hosted in the US but EU servers will come back to Europe later this year and then the ping on a EU server will be remarkably lower for you.

Also, the LOTRO community as a whole is one of the most helpful and friendly in gaming, bar none. If you need help or have a question, don't be afraid to ask in chat."

lotro,32ngca,Whoajosh,9,Wed Apr 15 16:07:46 2015 UTC,"Lotro wiki is your friend, that comes first and foremost. That being said, don't get overwhelemed with side quests, if your level ten and there's a bunch of level six side quests killing boars, don't feel obligated to finish every one of them. Play it the way that makes your experience most enjoyable.   Check out the lotro forums, many high-level players sharing a true gold mine of info and experiences.  Finally, be outgoing and friendly, many people are glad to help you or chat but will not strike conversations up with you.   Check out the stuff I said above, look over this subreddit and you should be pretty well set. But over all, play the game the way that you enjoy it, explore, discover, and be rewarded.  Happy travels, may good luck escort whatever path you choose.  Edit: sorry for wall of text, I'm on mobile at the moment"
lotro,32ngca,displaced-desert-rat,8,Wed Apr 15 05:19:50 2015 UTC,"Don't be in a rush.  If you like the game, you could easily want to play it for years to come, and that should inform your approach to the game.  So when you start, take the extra time to read the tips about how to use the user interface, how to do combat, all the basic stuff, it all really helps and is necessary skill.  I wish I had paid more attention early on, but I didn't know it mattered, and I was a complete noob to MMO's so I really didn't know how to work the game well.  Take your time and enjoy the early levels.  The earlier parts of LOTRO are slightly lower graphic detail than later parts, but they are all truly stunning, amazing game play, and you really shouldn't get caught up in the rush to level up.  Spend the time to enjoy the Shire and other starter areas.  Explore everywhere.  Don't worry, you can take all the time you like, there are no time limited opportunities you have to race for, except for a few fun little timed quests where you only have so many minutes to complete.  But even those can ALWAYS be re-done if you fail.  The game very seldom closes options, except that completing most quests makes them unavailable.  The game is very good at making it sound like there is an emergency, and if you don't get there in time, all will be lost.  Let yourself feel it for the fun, but know that it's an illusion, you can always take as much time as you like, and the next thing will still be there whenever you get there.  Also, there is no better or worse, you either complete the quests or not, so you don't have to worry about getting bad marks on some secret score you didn't know about.  The only thing like that is deeds for killing a certain number of each kind of monster, and the deeds are not secret, they are goals with good rewards.  So don't worry about having to do everything, kill every monster, etc., unless you actually want to because you find it fun.  Ask for help.  The game is not a competition, full stop.  There is no way to ""beat"" anyone else except in monster play.  Everyone gets relatively rich by higher levels, and most people are delighted to help new players not have to struggle to get established.  It's not rude to ask people (nicely) if they can make you good armour, weapons, jewelry, food, potions, etc., or maybe even give you a little gold if you feel frustrated about being a dirt-poor absolute beginner.  I've often given new players a few gold, it's not a big deal when they are struggling to afford stuff, and I have thousands, and suddenly they can afford a basic horse or a house for 5 gold.  You're welcome to enjoy the challenge of going it alone from absolute scratch, but if you don't enjoy that aspect of the struggle, you're not asking too much to ask for help.  And about the community: in the long run, we aren't here because LOTRO is the best ever MMO.  We're here because we love Middle Earth, and love LOTRO.  And the best thing is when everyone is friendly and helpful, when we cooperate, when we are generous instead of greedy and selfish with our time and our stuff.  There is plenty of stuff to share, nobody is poor, it's a land of plenty.  There is plenty of time for most people, and taking the time to help others is just as fun as doggedly chasing your own progress.  We get to make the community into an ideal place, a real beautiful escape from an otherwise nasty world.  You will meet a few fools, but most of us are doing our best to be nice, because it's the only thing worth doing."

Make an effort to invest yourself in the story. This game holds my interest, in large part, because it is the Lord of the Rings. Seeing Bree, Rivendell, Moria, and Lothlorien, still astounds me, let yourself be overwhelmed by the setting. Find an active kin, it makes a world of difference to have people online with you. Carefully research and consider before spending real money (to buy Turbine Points or Mithril Coins), many of the items in the store can be found in-game or are not a great use of your hard-earned money. A list of ""best items to buy in the store"" can likely be found in this sub.   That's it for now, hope you like the game!"
lotro,32ngca,TheWanderingSuperman,4,Wed Apr 15 08:08:20 2015 UTC,"Lotro-wiki is quite good. Beware of potentially outdated information though.  Going full Free2Play is doable but can be frustrating. The cheapest way to play is probably create all your characters, buy 1 month of VIP (login with all characters), and also to buy the Expansion Quad pack when it goes on sale for $10-20 during the summer."
lotro,32ngca,Darchseraph,4,Wed Apr 15 07:17:42 2015 UTC,"Pick a good server - There are US and EU servers, each having preferred RP servers. Pick one that suits you best, and don't afraid to bail on a server if you can tell early on (before level 40) that it is not a good fit. Pick a class that you like - Make a few different characters with different classes to find the style you like. For example, you might like the simple melee mechanics of the Guardian initially, but get bored with the sometimes tedious combat after a few levels. Conversely, you might get a bit overwhelmed with the complex mechanics of the Warden or Runekeeper, or dislike the mobile combat style of the Hunter. Find what works for you.  Join a good kinship - LOTRO is so much more enjoyable when you've got others to help you out, to quest or raid with, or to just chit-chat with. In the grindy parts of the game, its nice to have company. Don't feel like you have to do everything - This game is now HUGE and is only getting bigger. You'll never be able to do all content on level, trying to level all of your crafting skills and have full armour sets below level cap are usually pointless exercises. Do what you need or like, come back to the other stuff with an alt. Spend your money wisely - Get the expansions when they are on sale, don't spend much money on things that only apply to one character rather than your full account. If you want to go VIP, buy multiple months or a full year instead of month by month. If you don't want to do an extended VIP account, buy one month to unlock some perks permanently."

My main is at level cap, but I can't quite seem to finish the quest line.  I have every class going, 2 even of some, but they are stranded at all sorts of levels.

lotro,32fgdd,GildorInglorion,5,Mon Apr 13 19:53:46 2015 UTC,"That's a really nice story, and illustrates perfectly the main problem with lotro: the really large amount of servers and the freemium aspect. I started playing it solo and I enjoyed the game solo, because I found a really good kinship (I'm mainly on Withywindle and my kinship is absolutely the best I've known in all the servers I played, we are the Dunedain of the North). Obviously playing with my kin is far better than playing alone.  The thing that keeps me motivated is building a character, give him a story, dress him accordingly to what you feel it's his past.  The problems I'll address are just a personal opinion. The fremium aspect gives the players a feeling that they should buy the content although they don't need to enjoy it as fast as they can because there is no monthly fee. That combined with a lot of servers creates large ghost servers with people like you that only return when they miss lotro. And when you return, you find no people and no will to play. Linking some servers together would definitely solve that problem (I don't understand technical aspects of that but that sounds hard to do).  I've been months without playing aswell and I recently reentered with a friend and we got to level 60 together. It has been quite fun!  TL;DR: If you want motivation find it in multiplayer or in building a really good char, because servers are full of people that only play so often."
lotro,32fgdd,PPontex,1 point,Mon Apr 13 12:38:39 2015 UTC,"Oh boy motivation seems to come back just by thinking, writing and your comments!

As I said being able to play my old character on a populated server would be awesome but maybe I will start new once more and try actively to hold up my motivation!"
lotro,32fgdd,Semlohwerd,1 point,Mon Apr 13 14:00:05 2015 UTC,"I'd like to piggyback on this thread if possible just to ask some questions. Hope that's ok.   How active IS this game? Is it worth starting up?  I played a bit maybe a year or so ago and saw around here and /r/mmorpg that Brandywine was there only server really still kicking.   I play a lot of other mmo's. WoW mainly, but I've got 5 maxed out toons and have been looking for somewhere else to spend my free time if I'm not raiding.   I started a dwarven minstrel last weekend, should I keep going or should I dive into something else?"
lotro,32fgdd,hibernatepaths,4,Mon Apr 13 14:03:24 2015 UTC,"Imo it's hard to say how active lotro is. There are servers with little population but an active playerbase, some like that kind of environment, some not and as you mentioned highly populated servers (I think atleast 3 of maybe more not only Brandywine), but since I never really played on one of those I can't say much about them.  The game itself is awesome! If you're in the lotr lore atleast a bit you will like it, however for me, as said in the post itself, there are often times in which I lose motivation but it always comes back. Having friends to play with and/or finding an active friendly kin is the key for most people to enjoy their time in middle earth but playing nearly everything solo is also possible as far as I know.  I would recommend you to play your  new char (Ministrel is an awesome class and dwarf imo the coolest race) up to the point where the f2p areas end (thats around lvl 30) and then decide if you want to spend money on the game or not.   I can only recommend the game because I love it despite my 'complicated relationship' with it!"
lotro,32fgdd,Semlohwerd,2,Mon Apr 13 16:01:31 2015 UTC,"I just started playing 4 days ago, as a brand new player.  I'd say it's worth it because   1) it's free :)      2) It's fun!  I used to play WoW a long time ago, and that game got just too cartoony and bizarre for my tastes.  The LOTR lore is great, and I'm loving the atmosphere  3) There are a lot of players.  I don't know how many, but when I try to search for players that are around my level, I get 100+ hits (100 is the max the list will display).  This is low level, so I know there are much much more high lv players on.  Some servers will have more or less players, so just search which are the most populous ones in your continent (NA or EU)  4) they just renewed their license for Tolkein material, so they will be sticking around for a while.  They are also still coming out with expansions/updates  So yeah, I say it's worth it."

If you just doubled it, $40 would give you 10,000 TP but Turbine usually runs double bonus points which means that $40-> 6000 TP (4000 + 2000 Bonus).  It's still a good deal if you can spend $60+ chunks of money during the sale but not great if you can only afford $10-15 a month."

There are unique pieces (sets, and instance drops, for example) but they are surprisingly few. So my suggestion, and what I do, is just hold on to what you know/think will be unique and not easily reobtained."

lotro,32cg3i,SimoneKaundur,5,Sun Apr 12 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"I would recommend finding and obtaining those extra trait points. The extra few point can get you some decent skills from the other trees, particularly if you find just 1 or 2 skills that you don't need to fully rank in your primary tree. I find this helpful on many of my characters. How useful depends on the class, but I have not found any class that I am going - those points are just not useful. On my burg I have a red line set, but I have added Dust in the Eyes for the stun and some ranks in Leaf Walkers to improve my stealth, don't remember what else I did."
lotro,32cg3i,FG28,5,Sun Apr 12 18:21:52 2015 UTC,"Here's what I found as a hunter:  I felt mostly complete by the time I hit L95, with all the points earned except the BB ones, ie. everything before Gondor came out.  I think that was 70 trait points?  We've earned a few more points since then thanks to Gondor, but they didn't matter quite as much in terms of getting a complete set of skills.  Now, what I decided about how to spend them, and why having as many points as possible is good, is that for hunter, running primarily red line, but still keeping a good compliment of of basic blue-line traits, gave me excellent perks.  But those blue-line traits, not being my main trait tree, cost dearly.  What they do though, is give me an extra 5 to 10% damage across the board.  I actually didn't bother getting a couple of the red-line skills, because they only give damage on the skill itself (hear seeker, powerful but has a long cooldown), where spending those points gave me basic blue-line perks that apply across the board, stuff like extra damage and reduced induction times.  I haven't explored it as much, but the same seemed to be true in reverse with blue-line, it was wise to compliment with a solid set of red basics for increased critical hit and damage perks.  To get a good balance, you really do want as many points as you can get, at least 70, and I suspect that 70 was the designer's intention for proper balance.  What you need to do is get some energy drinks, or strong coffee, and just hard ball the quests, which should only take a couple of days total if you're not a completionist, and especially if you spend a bit of mithril coin on that instant quest return travel, which can cut a lot of time for little expense if used strategically."
lotro,32cg3i,exploderator,1 point,Mon Apr 13 07:00:19 2015 UTC,"Well said, this ^"
lotro,32cg3i,xKINGMOBx,5,Tue Apr 14 10:43:19 2015 UTC,"Firstly, congrats on hitting level 100! Secondly, I highly recommend taking the time to quest into Gondor, if for no reason than other to follow the epic book quests. Not only is it exciting to watch the main story in Middle Earth unfold, but you also get some great rewards, e.g. the mats for a level 100 FA item. Lastly, I think at a certain point, the trait tree points are less useful.   Let me explain: once you have filled the tree completely of your chosen line, spending 2:1 on the other trees just seems sort of pointless. It's less of a focus on the grind for me, and more of a confusion on the part of the game devs to allow us to get 60+ points when it's so hard to diversify, even at level cap."
lotro,32cg3i,msbq,2,Sun Apr 12 17:01:29 2015 UTC,"Im a bloody casual, and I sought after trait points more than any other single thing. Coming by a 1st ager is pretty easy now that you are L100, obviously a 1st ager will make more direct impact on your improvement, but as a casual LOTRO player and die hard gamer since the eighties, I love trait points and feel strongly compelled to get every last one. Basically, you have to catch em all.  Also, don't spend all trait points you have in one color. I did the minimum red line on my mini to get the top color bonus unlocked then strategically used the rest to buy a few key yellow and blue - the first tier of all colors have something super useful that gives direct dps gains across all skills."
lotro,32cg3i,xKINGMOBx,1 point,Tue Apr 14 10:42:26 2015 UTC,"As others have said, the majority of people don't spilt their points evenly between two or three trait lines...so the remaining class points you have to spend after you complete the line you intend to are mostly menial. They're nice to have but not necessary to performing your role. In this game, there are so many other things that are more important in pushing you to become a step above the rest, and as a 6 year player I feel I can say this isn't really one of them. Don't let this comment dissuade you from thinking that every little bit helps, all I'm saying is that it's not make or break."

Recreating the whole experience would be a monumental task; and would have to be done before the official servers go down. Otherwise you have no reference what to reverse engineer.  The screenshots/videos might have as well been made on Bullroarer/Palantir and sold off as private server BTW."
lotro,326806,Hyoss,7,Tue Apr 14 10:03:21 2015 UTC,"WB owns Turbine. The contract is actually with Saul Zaentz Corporation, also known as Tolkien Enterprises. They own the rights and can license them out, though they are not affiliated with the Tolkien family. Not sure. They will probably have to shut down if they no longer have the IP licensed. No idea at all. I suspect that it's not doing great, but is doing well enough to pay the bills and make a little money besides. But at some point WB/Turbine will have to do the math and decide that there's more profit to be made of they move the LotRO team to another, newer project instead of making less money on LotRO. When the contract comes up again they may decide that it's not worth extending, especially if payments to SZC would go up. I personally think this is why we're seeing such a push into Gondor now after languishing in Rohan for so long. As others have noted, they're re-using a lot of the artwork from other areas in Gondor, which allows them to speed development. My guess is that in the next 18 months we'll see the push to the Pelennor Fields and Black Gate and they'll call it a wrap."

lotro,326806,Hinras,3,Fri Apr 10 23:06:54 2015 UTC,Pretty sure a former dev posted on a fan forum a while back saying that the main reason WB even bought turbine was to control the LOTR rights.  I doubt they will be letting go any time soon since they seem to have a monopoly on the IP.
lotro,326806,vita10gy,1 point,Sat Apr 11 05:31:14 2015 UTC,But they still could shut down if they thought it's not worth it D:
lotro,326806,notwhoithink,3,Sat Apr 11 06:04:47 2015 UTC,"True, but there could be a long period of time where it had some middle status where it was left up but not actively developed. I have no stats obviously but I'd wager the percentage of users who play all the content is low, and even those that do already replay it again and again to make more characters.  A skeleton crew and just keeping the servers on would be easier to cover and would be an imperceptible change for most.  Other than for a rights issue I see little reason it has to be all or nothing."
lotro,326806,fadhero,2,Sun Apr 12 13:43:16 2015 UTC,All in all I love this game and what they have done with the lore (for a game).  For a Tolkien and gaming fan this game is a miracle.

This could extend it to 2018 or 2019 without any new content and only minor bug fixes. At that point, the game will be 12 years old, and I'm sure WB may want to develop a new Middle Earth game to take advantage of new tech, though it probably won't be a MMORPG."

It's that good.   3) Helms Deep was the last expansion. We're now going through Gondor.   4) Turbine has a resident lore expert so it tries to use as much lore as it can. Some liberties were taken, but nothing completely jarring if you remember this is a game."
lotro,322k1l,byzantinebobby,4,Fri Apr 10 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"When a friend wanted to try lotro, I joined him since the beginning and almost all the quests can be done by a 2 person team. We've leveled together till level 60. Just 10% or less have to be completed solo.  About your question 4 I haven't seen a real story from Sil, just small in-dialog references. The Riders of Rohan expansion story incorporates a part of the lore from the Unfinished Stories book. I was reading it while I was doing that part and I remember it to be as epic as the book described."
lotro,322k1l,PPontex,2,Fri Apr 10 07:31:24 2015 UTC,"IIRC, the license for LotRO only allows them to use content from the three LotR books. Anything else is off-limits.  If something is mentioned in paying in the books or their appendices then they have been allowed to make use of it.  That being said, they are allowed to create new characters and monster types (even a major plotline or three in the epic quests) that fit within the lore."
lotro,322k1l,notwhoithink,2,Fri Apr 10 11:31:40 2015 UTC,"1) Epic Quests are made to be solo-able, but you can do most of them with a group. There are even some epic quest instances that are made for groups, but solo players get a ""inspiration"" bonus (huge stat increase) to get through it. Duo play should make it go quickly.  2 & 4) The story is good. It builds upon the massive lore created by JRRT and has some decently interesting story lines. There are things that are extrapolated or best guessed since areas some areas of Eriador never got much detail in Tolkien's writings. However, it does not incorporate The Silmarillion. WB does not have the rights to it. There is still tons of peripheral lore around to make it quite interesting. The story is one of the most liked things about the game. Cutscenes are really only built into the epic quest line, and aren't very spectacular.   3) We are pretty close to Mordor, probably getting to it late next year. We are currently in the Return of the King book content. Osgiliath is in beta, with Minas Tirith set for later this year. Since the epic quest story parallels the books, I wouldn't be surprised to see the Black Gate or Minas Morgul come along first as session or instance play, with some possible Big Battle play later. I don't know if Mordor will ever be a full open region, as it might not make sense."

lotro,31wobt,baue8673,3,Wed Apr 8 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"At the very least, build two LIs for that will improve your equipped trait trees. I generally don't pay as much attention to legendary weapons since you can outgrow those pretty quickly. Later on in the Epic Quest line, you get a Second Age LI as a quest reward, which will last you awhile, but I don't think that one comes in play until lvl 65. Otherwise, I keep a couple of legendary weapons to store IXP for when I get to level cap. You can usually find a few good regular weapons that will provide sufficient DPS to get around using a legendary weapon."
lotro,31wobt,fadhero,6,Wed Apr 8 22:30:32 2015 UTC,"Yeah, sorry, you're stuck with the legendary weapons.

And/or just only put points in the damage ranking and ignore the legacies?  And if you ignore IXP runes (the little tan circles that add xp to the item), the leveling of the item will go pretty slowly so it's not like reforging will actually be a drag.  Solo tier landscape quests aren't that hard so honestly it's not like you'll be dying left and right, it will just take longer to kill things."
lotro,31wobt,Trihorn,3,Wed Apr 8 21:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I've encouraged her to put her points mostly into damage and one or 2 legacies that refer to attacks/actions she uses all the time and is familiar with.

That's fine. :) Just learn the basics of the bleed mechanics and tanking and you'll be fine.  Guardians are very, very strong in pvp. Second only perhaps to wardens.   I like tanking in blue line personally, but play around with trait trees as you level and find what works for you. In red, though, you absolutely need to trait radiate and insult to injury.

From each travel point, you can only get to a limited number of other stops. I hate to compare it to WoW, but in that game you click on a travel 'vendor', for lack of a better word, and the map opens up and you click on your destination.  It figures out the hops along the way and off you go. LORTO could use this, in a big way.  Seems like a small change with the travel system in place.  They could aggregate the costs of the trip and save a tonne of headaches.  Oh, so the hunter, they have travel skills, like ports really, to instantly move to a bunch of locations around the game.

lotro,31u5cy,WelCZa,6,Wed Apr 8 06:35:05 2015 UTC,Definitely Quad Pack! The turbine points you get are almost worth the purchase itself. And get the month or three months of VIP to gain your bonuses and turbine points. Spend 'em on the missing zones first. Content >> Store Cosmetics ;)

lotro,31tdvw,7h3C47,2,Wed Apr 8 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"This isn't directed at anyone in particular...maybe just newer players or people who only recently hit the cap:  Keep in mind that there are numerous ways to get LI support, legacies, titles, IXP runes, etc.  Evaluate what resources you have before springing for these things; you'll likely find that going here for one thing and going there for something else is more appropriate than spending all of one currency all in once place.  I'll just throw it out there that Lothlorien has big IXP runes that are very easy to barter for if you think about the comparative cost of getting them at the skirm camp where your marks/meds would be better off getting SoEs or SoDs (for example).  If you're like many of us, you probably have a few landscape barter tokens left over from previous level caps...take a trip down memory lane and head back to Harwick to get your main and offhand LIs titles on the cheap.  You're likely not going to use those tokens for anything else at this point, if you haven't already!  These are just a couple of examples--just remember you have options!  Furthermore, if you're not planning on dishing out all of the resources mentioned in this article on day one and plan to level up your imbued item through questing and regular content, consider this.  If you have 'unused' LI weapon slots, grab random-ass 3rd age LIs and fill up those slots.  Level them as high as you want, and decon for a big IXP payout, and maybe some bonus shards/relics to boot.  I've adopted this approach since 75 and have tens of millions in IXP runes sitting in my vault, so day 1 of imbument will be fun."

That didn't stop him from adapting parts of it for the big screen, of course..."
lotro,31r83h,notwhoithink,3,Tue Apr 7 21:06:46 2015 UTC,"He had a real funny way of showing how 'well' he knew the work.  Elves trodding on the theme of the age of men, Sam becoming a bumbling idiot, gimli as comic relief, the entire end of the books being lopped off, Helm's Deep being more important than Pellenor, Aragorn and Arwen wankfest, the list goes on.  Anyway, not meant as a shot at you (or anyone else here). I just overflow with salt anytime I think about those movies."
lotro,31r83h,lelandachana,4,Tue Apr 7 22:19:09 2015 UTC,"To be somewhat fair, its pretty hard to represent the books in a movie. Too many characters, too many stories. I can somewhat forgive the elves showing up in Helm's Deep. It was his way of showing that the elves weren't giving up. In the books they were busy fighting in their own areas. Just not involved as much in the story of the ring.  However, I can't forgive the whole Hobbit trashing. Way too much super hero junk ... ugh. Beorn bombs, etc."
lotro,31r83h,baue8673,1 point,Tue Apr 7 22:34:04 2015 UTC,Except the elves were giving up. They were only fighting a delaying action while they literally fled the world because they had decided to move on.

The only movies that I can think of s being possible exceptions to this are the first two Harry Potter movies, which were basically scene by scene retellings that while accurate felt oddly boring and rote. People just have to accept that books and films are different media and will always be different enough to tell mostly the same story in a different way. Just count you're lucky stars that they didn't do something like was done with The Natural or Silver Linings Playbook where they changed the endings in a way that basically reversed the entire story."

lotro,31s0bd,MattShimmerjugs,7,Tue Apr 7 18:36:12 2015 UTC,"If you like group play, it can be fun. Many people get frustrated starting out, especially if they are not at level cap. Because of the dynamic (i.e. human) nature of the opponents, the gameplay can differ much more based on opponent, not a more scripted game like raids or instances. This means there is a learning curve that some don't care for. Also, starting out, it is very helpful to play with others instead of solo. Being solo, you are easy prey for enemy groups, or if there are no enemy groups, there is not a lot to do by yourself.   I recommend hanging out with some more experienced PvMPers for a few hours to start. If there is action in the Moors, you should start ranking up and get a decent taste of what it is like."
lotro,31s0bd,fadhero,3,Tue Apr 7 19:30:11 2015 UTC,"I find it fun, but others disagree.  It's kind of like a cult classic film; the bee's knees for some, but the anti-Eru for others."
lotro,31s0bd,legofreak11,3,Tue Apr 7 18:46:01 2015 UTC,"I find it to be tons of fun :) Part of the reason is that it's rewarding and never gets old. Even fighting the same person a few times in a row in an organized 1v1 setting doesn't get mundane, as you're always learning your class and trying new things.  Absolutely give it a shot! But just so you know - the lower ranks are realllly rough to get through. You basically are cannon fodder.  As a creep, spend those early ranks getting your maps and ranking up your audacity. I've seen rank 9+ creeps with lower audacity get wrecked and r7 creeps with full aud hang in there a lot longer than folks would expect. Part of it is skill, lots of it is audacity ... stuff keeps you alive!!  There was a player on Gladden - the first rank 14 player on the server, I believe. Ronnug, the blueberry reaver. He had a saying: ""I don't mind dying. I just mind when the rez is on the other side of the map."" It's a good approach to take. You're gonna die. A lot. But it's okay. Just keep having fun and you'll enjoy the living daylights out of it :)"
lotro,31s0bd,Arathaert,2,Wed Apr 8 19:22:26 2015 UTC,"I definitely think it's fun and worth the trouble!  I only have one character at level cap so I mostly play creepside.  I personally find it more fun to play in a group when I'm out there, whether it's a small group or a raid, but depending on the server population and action, solo play is viable.  I'd suggest getting out there with one or two friends, no matter which side you play on, and give it some time before giving up.  As long as you understand that when you're new, you're going to die, it isn't quite so rage-inducing.  :)"
lotro,31s0bd,Alyys,2,Tue Apr 7 21:40:38 2015 UTC,"The biggest problem, IMO, is that the stat gap between a new PvMP player and a veteran is just way too big. Newbies to the Moors just melt like butter, making it hard to rank up to earn the creep corruptions or freep Audacity gear that you need to actually be worth a damn in a fight.  If you can get past that awkward early phase, you might find something to enjoy. Personally, I prefer to get my PvP fix from League of Legends instead."
lotro,31s0bd,tobascodagama,2,Tue Apr 7 22:41:25 2015 UTC,You need the best gear and virtues. That usually is a turn off for the casual majority of players. I recommend the moors as it is the only hard core content left in the game

lotro,31ptx6,Name1ess_,5,Tue Apr 7 05:19:35 2015 UTC,"One weekend they offered Evendim at 75%, but that was an ad that went live with a typo, and they were forced to uphold the offer.  50% discounts appear sometimes for full expansions on the RL cash store, but they are very rare. Think one or two weekends a year. Maybe 50%s for QPs have happened sometime in the past, but if so it was a one time thing.  Sometimes, some particularly good weekend deals will have 30% discounts instead of the regular 20%. But nothing guarantees that the next one will coincide with QP discounts instead of wardrobe or anything else.  For most regions, 20% is the best deal you are going to get."
lotro,31ptx6,elrohir_ancalin,4,Tue Apr 7 09:46:39 2015 UTC,"Soon? Probably not. There might be a bit bigger discount during the summer, but when you get a sale you jump on it when it's there.

lotro,31oy3l,Skrotorius,6,Tue Apr 7 00:30:52 2015 UTC,"If you go redline warden and he goes blue line captain, you two will be set. Redline warden is dps, blue line captain is heals. But he doesn't have to actively heal for the most part, he can cast shield brother on you and so long as you guys don't get too far apart, some of his attack skills will automatically heal you. Also, Captains wear heavy armor and use swords/axes/halberds while Wardens wear medium armor and use shields, spears (or 1 handed swords), and javelins. So someone should do armourer which will allow the making of armors/shields, and someone should do armsman (I think that's the name) that has woodworking for javelins and spears and weaponsmithing for all the other types of weapons. Unfortunately you will both get prospector so will be fighting over ores both for collecting and crafting, and you will have to buy wood or something for the woodworker crafting as neither of you will have the forester profession. If you guys had a third, I would suggest Explorer vocation which has prospecting and forestry for picking up both ores and woods, and that person just collects the wood for the armsman. The other option would be to both roll Explorer for vocation and either ask for someone to take the materials and make gear for you (possibly for a fee, unless you get into a good kinship and your kinmates might do it for free,) or sell the materials you collect and just buy the gear on the auction house. You said you would be on Brandywine, correct? While I am not on a lot, I am more than willing to help with crafting questions or whatever else when I am on, so feel free to add Delanynder or Dwarriorr to your friends list in game.

lotro,31oy3l,ChriosM,2,Wed Apr 8 11:51:44 2015 UTC,"I really enjoy crafting in LotRO and am an advocate for it, but I'm sure there are people who never craft because it's boring. So I think it's a matter of preference. The best gear is generally crafted, at least at lower to mid game levels, but if you learn what your class can and can't do and stick to that then you will get by fine even with quest rewards. Even if you don't plan on making your own gear, I'd still suggest Explorer. You get some xp just for crafting ore into ingots or wood into planks, plus you can sell the mats a stack a time on the auction house. Don't sell crafting materials at a vendor, though, regardless of what you decide. The vendor gives you a few copper for each piece while the auction house will generally get you much more. You just might have to wait a few hours for it to sell."

What you will start to see is the base value of each legacy begin to creep closer to the current pre-imbued max. The intention in the end is that while you may lose a little bit of legacy potency upon imbuement, it will catch and surpass pre-imbued cap values at much earlier tiers than in your current build.

He is disconnected from the world more than the elves which leads me to believe he is probably a Valar or Maiar. I lean towards Valar though because of how powerful he seems to be.
lotro,31mzaq,godholdingagun,3,Tue Apr 7 17:54:53 2015 UTC,"W know he's not a valar though, because the valar were just the 15 most powerful of Eru's original homeboys, all of which were named."

A scavenger hunt in game might also be possible, first to send you a pic of all the items on the list in their inventory, or have them mail it to you in game on a server of you choosing, assuming the items are things low levels would be able to accumulate. Or you could make a char on each participating server so you wouldn't have to limit the items to low levels having to create on your server."

Note about these sets is that you can only barter for the ones of your own class, as it won't allow you to talk to the other class trainers.

You can make TP quite decently with in game deeds and unless you are an altoholic and a completionist with the goal of setting up a crafting empire for yourself or if you care a great deal about cosmetics, the game is quite playable on the cheap.

lotro,31bkci,tobascodagama,4,Fri Apr 3 16:00:35 2015 UTC,"Update 16 Beta 1 Release Notes – PRELIMINARY AND NON-FINAL - BULLROARER ONLY  The following release notes are for the Bullroarer public test server only and may not reflect the final list of changes or updates included at release.  These notes are not final and should be viewed as a work in progress and subject to change.  Due to the method of gathering information for the patch notes, there may be duplicate/similar entries or topics that are not included.  The Eyes and Guard Tavern is now open! Please note you will also not be able to advance class and race traits for Beornings at this time.  Important Note: Given the scope of this update please be aware that the build you are seeing here is a work in progress and is by no means the finished Update 16 product. There are many items that are not yet complete or added into what you are seeing. There may also be items missing from this initial list, this is not intentional and will be added as we progress.   You can use Character Copy to bring over an existing character from the Live servers.  With Update 16, the new Legendary Item Imbuement will be introduced. In its current form for this build, the system is nearly functionally complete, but there are some elements that are not yet finished when it comes to polish and the User Interface. Here is a brief overview of how the system will work.   PLEASE NOTE: The New Legendary Item Imbuement system is not yet 100% complete. We did however want players to get their hands on it and give feedback as soon as possible. Most of the work that still needs to be complete is User Interface and Cosmetic, and there still may some functionality that will be adjusted or changed based on feedback.   What Is Imbuement?  Imbuement is a new system we are introducing into Legendary Items that will provide players with a new form of advancement and allow them to grow an item with their character moving forward from update to update. This will make legendary items feel much more legendary.  How does it work?   Opting into Imbuement will convert your existing legacies (including DPS) into new, extendable legacies that will grow as you accrue IXP. You will no longer have to spend points on individual legacies. They will each have their own progress track that fills as you gain IXP. When a legacy ranks up to a higher tier it will become more powerful.   When an item gains IXP, this experience is distributed evenly among the current legacies you have unlocked on the weapon (including the DPS legacy). You cannot disable the leveling of a legacy.    Each legacy on a newly-imbued legendary item(as of Update 16) will have:   Roughly 15 available tiers that can be earned 10 additional tiers that can be unlocked via items found in-game or mithril coins The resulting maximum tiers would therefore be 25 The IXP, age, and enhancements already on the Legendary Item will translate into earned tiers and unlocked available tiers.   Are current legacies going to change?  While many legacies in-game can naturally extend with the imbuement system, some are just not extendable and will be replaced by new legacies.   This conversion will happen only when you imbue your legendary item and will not affect legacy functionality pre-imbuement. Upon imbuement, the UI will display what legacies will look like in Imbuement.   Legacies that cannot be extended fall under the following categories:   Cannot affect the maximum number of targets of a skill. Cannot affect the availability of the skill I.e. Cooldown reduction. Can only modify a property that has no potential cap.   For example, things like power cost modifiers will eventually reach 100% reduction, while properties like % damage increases in theory could extend forever.    Important to note that currently no legacy will just vanish from a player. If a legacy changes, it will have an equivalent legacy upon entering imbuement.  Once the work is finalized, we will be posting a list of what legacies are changing and what their new legacy will be.  What do I need to qualify?  All you need is a level 100 legendary item (mounted combat not included at the moment).   No age requirement to the item. Want to bring a third ager along for the ride? Go for it! Age will affect an item upon imbuement, granting not only additional tiers of DPS unlocked compared to other ages, but will start with the number of bonus unlocked tiers already accrued.   Example: First age items have a bonus of 3 (number TBD). Therefore while a Third Age item would start at 1/10 DPS tiers, a First Age item would start at 4/13.    How does a Reforged LI fit in?   A legendary item can have a maximum of 7 legacies on it at one time. A newly identified legendary item, when imbued will only have 3 class specific legacies on it. The four other slots will have to be unlocked by either mithril (The mithril unlocks on imbued legendary items are not yet functioning.) or by using a Crystal of Remembrance. Therefore, a reforged item will keep the legacy slots it has already unlocked, giving that player a leg up on leveling their weapon.   How do the old LI items fit into this new system?  Many of the items that players have familiarity with using on their Lis will continue to work within the new system, while some will have some additional functionality that they previously did not have:  Scroll of Empowerment   Unlocks an additional tier of a single legacy. This will also have a mithril option on the UI for those who want a quick option.   Star-lit Crystals   Starlit crystals will unlock and gain an additional tier of their DPS legacy.   Example: if the items DPS has progressed to 8/10 tiers, using a crystal will increase that progress to 9/11.  There will no longer be a restriction of 3 star-lit crystals that can be applied to an item. The only restriction in imbuement is that a star-lit crystal can only be applied if there is a tier to unlock for the item.   You cannot use these as a means to power level your weapon up to max.  Crystals that are applied pre-imbuement will be treated exactly how the Ages are treated in the qualified section above.   Scroll of Delving   Scroll of Delving will unlock an additional tier of all class specific legacies on the item. This will keep its limit to one per legendary item and can be used either pre or post-imbuement.   Title Scrolls   These items will not receive any change in their functionality and will continue to work as they currently do in the system.   IXP Runes   These items will not receive any change in their functionality and will continue to work as they currently do in the system.   Replacement Scrolls   Pre-imbuement replacement scrolls will no longer apply to an imbued item. However, legacies can be replaced on the Legendary Item UI.   Crystal of Remembrance   As mentioned above, this item will unlock an additional legacy slot (up to the cap of 7) on an item. The restriction of one per item is lifted. Added functionality to this item will be that upon using this feature, you the player is prompted with a UI to choose the legacy they would like to place in this newly unlocked slot. No more blank legacies, no more random legacies. You unlocked it, you choose what goes in it.   Can I deconstruct an imbued item?  Imbued items cannot be deconstructed. Imbued Legendary Items are meant to stick around, grow with you, become your friend. You wouldn’t deconstruct a good friend, would you?  You can however, destroy the item out of your inventory if you prefer to erase your friends from existence."

KNOWN ISSUES:   Imbued Legendary items still need quite a bit of polish. For Imbued Legendary items the following do not work properly: Disable Leveling, Crystals of Remembrance, and Rune-Keeper Smouldering Wrath Power Cost legacy conversion. Imbued Legendary legacies have mostly place holder numbers for now. Temporarily setting all Physical and Tactical DPS, Incoming healing, and Tactical HPS legacies to a maximum of 20 tiers for Imbuement testing. We intend to increase the number of ranks for launch, but wanted to start at 20 for Instance testing purposes. At various points in The Ruined City Instance, the mysterious figure is not yet visible to follow. Osgiliath - Quest: Made to Suffer - Clicking on the imprisoned rangers does nothing. Many rewards are not yet present. This is particularly true for the instance cluster and region barter vendors. In this build, the following stablemasters are temporarily missing: South Bree, Thorin’s Hall, Michel Delving, and Rivendell."
lotro,31bkci,baue8673,3,Fri Apr 3 16:01:22 2015 UTC,"At first glance, the Imbuement system looks awesome. Not gonna lie, I kind of love that Legacy Points are (apparently) going away forever on Imbued LIs. Would be nice if you could disable leveling to get your important legacies ranked up faster, but that's not a dealbreaker. (EDIT: Looks like the way to achieve this now is via Scrolls of Empowerment.)  The list of legacies that are replaced on Imbued LIs will need a thorough looking over by experienced players of each class, though. I understand why they're doing this (the items can't truly last and progress forever if your legacies cap out at some maximum value), but some of the most important legacies have always been the Maximum Target/Cooldown Reduction types."
lotro,31bkci,legofreak11,3,Fri Apr 3 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"The only thing I don't like ... a crystal of remembrance in order to unlock a new legacy? Aren't those expensive? So a default LI will go from having 6 legacies unlocked, to only three legacies unlocked. You want more, go to the lotro store or hope for good luck from boxes and presents. Kind of screws over any character that doesn't have a level 100 LI to convert. I'll hope this doesn't go live like this, but with Turbine, I've lost a bit of faith."
lotro,31bkci,baue8673,1 point,Fri Apr 3 17:29:04 2015 UTC,"So, this is a little unclear, but it seems that an Imbued LI will have the same number of Legacies unlocked as the LI you started with.  E.g.:   I identify a totally new level 100 LI, then Imbue it right away. Now I have an Imbued LI with 3 Legacy slots.   vs.   I take my fully-upgraded and reforged level 100 LI with 6 legacy slots and Imbue it. Now I have an Imbued LI with 6 Legacy slots.   That's how I read it, anyway, based on this:   A newly identified legendary item, when imbued will only have 3 class specific legacies on it. The four other slots will have to be unlocked by either mithril (The mithril unlocks on imbued legendary items are not yet functioning.) or by using a Crystal of Remembrance.  Therefore, a reforged item will keep the legacy slots it has already unlocked, giving that player a leg up on leveling their weapon.   So, if you don't want to waste MCs on unlocking legacy slots, and you haven't received any Crystals from boss drops, you need to upgrade and reforge your LI (with IXP) three times before Imbuing it."
lotro,31bkci,helldeskmonkey,3,Fri Apr 3 17:33:44 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, that LIs converted to the new system will be ok. You'll get all the legacies you had on it moved over, perhaps to the new legacies.  Its the new ones that get screwed. Any newly identified item should have 6 legacies on it, just like the originals did. Instead, all my alts and new LIs will have a nice expense tacked on just to return to the previous implementation. Once again, good idea Turbine, but from all appearances a dubious execution. I'm hoping its something as simple as they didn't want to change the code to LI identification for this early build, but not sure.  edit: Maybe I am missing what you are saying, but it looks like reforges will be a thing of the past. I'm not sure i am following you on how reforges will add new legacies. He specifically says that new items will come with 3 legacies, and need mithril or crystals to get more."
lotro,31bkci,exploderator,3,Fri Apr 3 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"Reforges are not a thing if the past. The legacies aren't locked until you click the imbue button. Lis don't come auto imbued, you still have the opportunity to level up and reforge your lis for more legacies before committing to an imbuement."
lotro,31bkci,msbq,2,Fri Apr 3 18:16:07 2015 UTC,"Ahh, that is the missing piece. Well then, nevermind, characters moving up will have the same capabilities as before."
lotro,31bkci,cazama1,4,Fri Apr 3 18:27:19 2015 UTC,"The downside is that once you've imbued, you can't change the legacies on your LI without spending mithril coins, at least as near as I can tell. Class update makes one or more of your legacies suboptimal? Either pay MC or scrap your LI and start over."
lotro,31bkci,Stever89,2,Fri Apr 3 21:17:42 2015 UTC,"One up side, depending on what the new legacies are, is that by using 4 crystals of remembrance instead of 3 reforges + 1 crystal, you would get a weapon with 7 major legacies, and by not having a limit of how many legacy points, you can get them all maxed out fully for sure."
lotro,31bkci,helldeskmonkey,2,Sat Apr 4 00:51:46 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree more with this. I like the sound of it, but I really hope they keep some of the more practical legacies around."
lotro,31bkci,helldeskmonkey,3,Fri Apr 3 16:31:05 2015 UTC,"Looking through some of the class/legacy changes, it seems that a lot of the removed legacies are being rolled into traits or the base skills. That's a pretty good approach, IMO."
lotro,31bkci,Voloso,2,Fri Apr 3 16:50:27 2015 UTC,It seems this will also be a good subtle change to classes to keep the gameplay interesting.
lotro,31bkci,Execrat0r,5,Mon Apr 6 16:06:32 2015 UTC,"Lots of legacy changes I see... For the three classes I mainly play (champ, LM, capt), I like the changes. Making a legacy just a natural part of the skill is nice because it reduces the need to actually have that legacy (obviously) but then usually reduces the need for multiple LIs since you need one for each build.  Imbued system looks interesting... though if the max tiers is 25 or so... won't that mean eventually they will cap out anyway? I'd have to see what a ""tier"" does and how character leveling up would affect that. But if each tier is a level give or take, I guess that means a level 100 LI could potentially last us until we reach level 125, which is probably a long ways away. Either way, I look forward to never having to build a LI again ever."
lotro,31bkci,Execrat0r,1 point,Fri Apr 3 16:26:31 2015 UTC,"Well, the point of Imbuement is that they can raise the legacy tier cap at any time to add new LI progression without requiring everybody to decon their existing stuff.  So, let's say the level cap goes up to 105 or 110 with the Minas Tirith or Pelennor update or something. Rather than giving us new level 110 LIs to rebuild, they just add 10 new tiers to the legacy caps.  Also, something I just noticed on a second read through: It sounds like everyone will have all Legacies unlocked for their Imbued LIs, and we'll be able to switch out Legacies at will as well. (I'm sure there's some additional wrinkle here, though, like tiers being tied to a specific Legacy rather than a legacy slot. So that still encourages you to level multiple Imbued LIs at once, to keep all of your Legacy tiers up to date.)"

lotro,31bbau,easy_eh,2,Fri Apr 3 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"Just about any class can solo. With the introduction of trait trees, each class has enough dps ability to make their own way.   Guardian can get a bit boring, Guardians are tanks through and through, probably the least versatile class.   Champions are great DPS, have enough durability to chop through mobs easily. Champs can go melee DPS or tank in group situations.   Minstrels are great group healers, but have strong enough single target DPS skills to help on group content.   Captains may be the most versatile. With the pet ability and different trait trees, they are always useful in group content.  Wardens are good for either DPS or tank and have significant ranged and melee attack abilities. I'm just getting into my warden, but I'm really enjoying it so far."

They will end up announcing them ahead of time and give free transfer opportunities to move (or they are going to merge servers). This is what I have heard in brief.  I can, however, speak on Silverlode (the server I have been on with my little brother since 08/09). It definitely used to be one of the biggest but recently has been seeing a great burst in activity that has been steadily increasing over the last few months. Very easy to throw together multiple raid groups, or just find some people to hop in and roll with some skirms. World chat is blowing up 80% of the time and it feels like the entire server is just one giant kin.  I am happy with the recovery Silverlode is going through and would happily welcome you across. We also, once a week, have a server wide lore-based trivia in world chat. Myself and a few other lore buffs offer up gold, or rare crafted items as rewards for those who can answer questions quickest and accurately. It usually sparks a lot of interest into the deeper lore and we have ended up enlightening/finally convincing many to actually read the books.  Either way I am sure the server Imladris is still great, and I have heard many others are slowly dying, or are coming back to life. I hope this trend continues. good luck with your choice, just vouching for my server!"

I use to be an officer in Freedom Fighters back then.  I apologize for being a bit off topic. :( For what I know, Brandywine, Gladden & Landroval are the highest pop servers.

Due to how much less time is spent looking at the toolbar  and more time spent looking at the world, enemies and your character, it lets you connect closer to the world. While using skills with the mouse via the ui increase the distance between you and your character, and makes it feel more like you command your chararcter to use a skill, instead of you yourself using a skill. These things are however subjective, and others might disagree with me."

lotro,30fqek,NRG_88,6,Fri Mar 27 07:40:38 2015 UTC,"https://lotro-wiki.com/index.php/Account_Types  Basically you get all you listed and some more. All the quest packs, you get as long as you are subbed. unsub and you can't access it anymore (you can always go to the zones, just can't quest there if you don't own it). Buying zones with TP unlocks it permanently even if unsubbed.  Biggest perks of VIP and why people recommend doing it for one month only is that all characters created/played during VIP have swift travel, and trait slots unlocked permanently. These help a lot and are expensive to unlock individually via TP. Additionally, you can play as a freep (free people, your PC) in the PvMP zone. Without VIP you can only play as Creeps (evil dudes). Also, skirmished and instances are all unlocked while subbed.  If you're on a budget, the best thing to buy is the Quad pack when it's on sale ($20). It gets you from levels 45-85. Moria,Mirkwood, Isengard, Half of Rohan. By the time you finish, you will have enough TP for the next expansion, I know I did from deeds, etc.  Prior to the quad pack content, you should unlock Evendim, then a QP (quest pack) for 40-50. Usually angmar/forochel/misty mountains/eregion.   That lets you enjoy pretty much all of the game.  VIP doesn't unlock other classes, those need to be bought with TP. Only classes unlocked are monster classes.  There will probably be a sale for the quad pack around lotro anniversary. That being said, welcome to the game!"
lotro,30fqek,Whitesymphonia,2,Fri Mar 27 02:22:02 2015 UTC,Quad pack comes with Mines of Moria expansion so it should come even with Warden and Rune-Keeper classes (reffering to this lotro-wiki site)
lotro,30fqek,WelCZa,2,Fri Mar 27 06:50:46 2015 UTC,So 500 tp poins a month for 15 euro and much more..  After what? 6-7 months you could own every expansion just by saving the TP they give you '-'
lotro,30fqek,Kants_Pupil,2,Fri Mar 27 07:08:29 2015 UTC,"You shouldn't need quite that long if you are playing somewhat actively. If you aren't familiar with them yet, there are deeds that you complete by killing x enemies of various types in certain zones, like 30 wolves in the shire or 120 brigands in Evendim. Each deed awards some TP, so naturally while you level and quest, you will earn a few points here and there. If you are willing to focus on completing as many of these deeds as you can, you can accumulate a fair bit of TP. For F2P players, each character can earn something like 1,800 TP without buying a single quest pack or expansion, but this would take an insane amount of time and requires you to grind your way up to level 100 using just monster kills and something like 8 skirmishes. Way boring. Instead, if you were to subscribe for one month and play 2 characters to get to Moria (level 45-50 is required to enter), you would get quite a bit of TP. Both of those characters and any others you create during that month will get a whole host of upgrades, including removing the gold cap, unlocking all trait slots, and granting permanent access to swift travel. Instead of subscribing for the next 5 or 6 months, a single purchase of the quad pack gives both of those characters the content needed to get to level 85 or so, and while you get up that high, you might be able to save enough TP to buy the Helm's Deep expansion, which gets you to at least 95 (I recently did the whole expansion starting at 85 and not leaving until finishing all the quests there to get additional trait points, and I didn't get out until about 98). Along the way, you will unlock a ton of instances from the quad pack, a ton of skirmishes through Moria and Mirkwood epic books, and epic battles with Helm's Deep."
lotro,30fqek,outbound_flight,4,Fri Mar 27 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Until you get to level 30, I wouldn't worry about spending money unless you really want to. For one, that's when the F2P quests end, so you'll want to subscribe at a point when you'll get the most out of it. VIP, in addition to the permanent unlocks you get for your account (provided you login with all the characters you want those bonuses to apply to) is a good way to help you bridge the gap to the expansions, since you get rest XP, and access to all of the base game zones up until Moria at lvl 50.

lotro,30e4xt,Crash665,2,Thu Mar 26 18:41:58 2015 UTC,What server?
lotro,30drs8,ResplendentOwl,8,Thu Mar 26 15:42:22 2015 UTC,"The base game provides four zones to start, Ered Luin, the Shire, Bree-Land, and the Lone Lands, and typically you will run through where ever your race starts you, Bree-Land, and Lone Lands and end up around level 30-32 with no strong hints on where to go next. The best quest pack to get you the furthest is definitely Evendim. You can start at level 29 or 30 and it should have plenty of content to get you at least to 40 or even 42. As you already have Angmar and plan to play with your proto-spouse, Angmar is a great way to get to at least 45 - 47. Moria opens up and you can enter at 45, but it can be a bit of a slog and lots of folks complain that by the time you get out the other side, it starts feeling a bit claustrophobic, but I really enjoy the zone and don't mind it. Moria will allow you to get to at least 60, but if you want to duck out early, you should probably get Mirkwood and head that way about 58, if I recall correctly. Mirkwood, while dreary in its own right, has a sky and has enough content and the epic book line running through it so you can get to at least 65 here. From there, Isengard, East Rohan, West Rohan and Gondor are all that stand between you and the level cap.   The quad pack is a pretty good deal as it gets you three of those last five zones (Mirk, Isen, and East Rohan) while including all their instances, leaving Helm's Deep expansion and Gondor quest pack to pick up. The Helm's Deep expansion gives epic battles, which are like skirmishes but with siege weaponry, friendly units to command, and differently structured objectives (in my opinion, a ton of fun).   Buying one month of VIP is a really strong way to unlock a ton of the per character perks, like gold cap unlock, 5 bag slots, traits, and swift travel priveledge permanently for each character you log into while VIP. $15 buys you that and adds a bunch of temporary benefits too, like access to all the quests in the pre-Moria zones, such as Evendim, Forochel, the Misty Mountains, etc, crafting guilds, several instances, 500 TP, and rest XP (daily 20% of current level). When it ends, the rest XP stops, the instances and quest zones are no longer accessible, and new characters made will have the same restrictions that your current characters have today.   As for storage, in game gold should buy you a lot of space. In my experience with about 5 level 100 characters, the vault storage purchased in game should mostly do it and supplementing it with a couple of unlocks for the shared vault space should suffice (to limit the need for constant mailing). A better bang for buck, in my opinion, is the purchase of the 6th bag slot (unlocks 1 bag on all characters on account) and the premium wallet (makes every barter token into a currency like gold, removing them from bags and vaults and putting them into a currency tab with your money). If that proves too small, then use TP to buy extra vault slots."

lotro,30drs8,TheElSoze,4,Fri Mar 27 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you already have Moria, but your best bet is probably the quad-pack for $20 when it's on sale. It still might be. That will take you a reasonable amount of time to get through and get reacquainted with the game to know what you might want to get post level 85 or so.  If that sale is gone just wait a few weeks... it's usually up for sale again around the anniversary which is coming soon.  Also, Helm's Deep expansion is really only worth it for $20, IMHO."
lotro,30drs8,Hyoss,2,Thu Mar 26 16:24:05 2015 UTC,"You could consider becoming a VIP for a month, as the many many unlocks this gives you are permanent as long as you log in the corresponding character during that time (trait slots, started deeds, gold cap etc).

lotro,30drs8,Fluffcake,2,Thu Mar 26 17:02:26 2015 UTC,"0-30 = starter areas -> bree -> lonelands.  30-40 = evendim is by far the best choice. there are some combinantions of North Downs - trollshaws - MM that covers these levels, but evendim is way more fluid.  40-50 this is where it start to get complicated. Trollshavs, MM, forochel, angmar and eregion covers this, but you only need 1-2 of them. Personal favourite is to do Forochel, because it gets you to 50 without having to move between zones, which can be a hazzle without swift-travels.  50-60 Moria should have you covered here. Lorien is 58-60 but not essential.  60-65 you have the option between mirkwood and enedwaith, It is possible to skip them entirely by overlvling in moria with instance-quests etc and going straight for dunland at 62-63, but this might be difficult, depending on class, but having one of them can be nice.  65-75 you have dunland (RoI expansion), as it covers you for 10 levels, Great river is 70-75 and optional/skippable.  75-85 you have Eastern Rohan(RoR expantion), wildermore is in the same boat as Great River, and can be skipped.  85-95, Western Rohan (HD expantion) only real option.  95-100, western gondor, would also recommend getting central gondor, as it has 4 class points gated inside the questlines and counts as endgame activities if you make it this far.  As long as you have one zone covering each level treshold, you should usually be fine, I have over the years gotten most of them (sans wildermore) just to give all my alts different paths to 100.  As for which ones to pick, and how to procure them the cheapest way: unless you really want the QoL instantly, I'd wait to hit lvl 30 before getting anything, then get a month of VIP, this unlocks all the content before moria for the time you remain VIP, and lvling 30-50 in a month should be doable. A portion of the VIP QoL-perks stay, even after it runs out, enough to make it a better deal than getting them from the store with TP. as for buying content (quest packs/expansion) you are almost always better off buying them for real money directly, than buying TP and getting it from the ingame store. TP-prices for content are fairly steep due to how characters can gain substential TP for playing (deeds)."
lotro,30drs8,fadhero,1 point,Fri Mar 27 13:17:46 2015 UTC,"As far as zone content after the lone-lands, what are my options and where do they come from?"
lotro,30drs8,shellwe,2,Thu Mar 26 17:18:13 2015 UTC,"Evendim is the general consensus favorite around here. It covers levels 30-40, has some instances, and the Annuminas flag objectives that can be fun to play around with. Some of the best visuals of Eriador as well. Since you have Angmar, this should enough to bridge the gap between Lone-Lands and Angmar. Angmar can get you to Moria and up to about level 60, at which point you will need to look into the Quad Pack or individual region quest packs.  Trollshaws can also get you from Lone-Lands to Angmar, and much of the epic content will take you through there anyway, so if you have the TP to spend, it may be a good choice.  Your other choices are Misty Mountains and Forochel, but those only cover between 40-50. Misty Mountains has the Helegrod raid dungeon and Goblin-Town, which is good for farming Rivendell rep and has some separate explorer deeds.   Bottom Line: Get Evendim, save your TP and real money for later content. Buy other Eriador regions if you want to have alts."
lotro,30bara,WardenMadness,3,Wed Mar 25 23:45:00 2015 UTC,"You will get the perks. I applied codes that covered the same expansion before and the account just merges all perks certain editions give you (Moria boxed edition bought in store in Germany and Mithril Edition bought in GameStop US webstore).  As to why the premium edition is not on sale, this question can only be answered by the LOTRO sales team."
lotro,30bara,Hyoss,3,Thu Mar 26 12:55:34 2015 UTC,"Umm, you'd only be out a title, 1000 TP, +10 quests to your log, a crystal of remembrance, and cosmetic armor. You can just buy the TP. The rest is really meh.   There use to be bonus items for prepurchasing it, but that has expired."
lotro,30bara,byzantinebobby,2,Thu Mar 26 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"Well, if you were to use all those perks to the fullest on at least three characters it is cheaper to buy the premium edition instead of purchasing the TP and the perks/items separately. Seeing as a crystal of remembrance goes for 800g on my server or is 995TP in the store each, it can be worth it to purchase it by way of the premium edition."
lotro,30bara,Hyoss,2,Thu Mar 26 13:02:07 2015 UTC,"If you're budget conscious, that's not necessarily worth it. You can easily live without any of that, especially considering that base is half off while premium isn't."
lotro,30bara,byzantinebobby,2,Thu Mar 26 13:05:34 2015 UTC,"True and I agree. But just a few days ago the same question came up in the reddit I calculated that as soon as you use the perks on three characters the price of ""reduced base edition""+ TP amount required for perks is MORE than price of ""not reduced premium edition"". So in case you wanted to purchase those perks at some point anyway for multiple characters you can save a few bucks, nothing wrong with buying at a discount even if you can spare the money."
lotro,30508p,Iluminatos13,6,Tue Mar 24 15:15:15 2015 UTC,"You have plenty of content to get you to level 85. If you want more lower-level content, I suggest Angmar. Angmar has the Urugarth and Carn Dum instance clusters along with the Rift of Nurz Ghashu raid dungeon. If you are past level 50, I would hold onto the TP and wait to get the Helm's Deep expansion.  I suggest getting rid of the gold cap. Once you get going, you will want to buy a house and expand your vault storage, both of which require a bit of gold."
lotro,30508p,fadhero,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:06:46 2015 UTC,Thanks a lot! I'm currently lvl 30 so I'll save for Angmar and go for Helms Deep next time it's on sale :)

lotro,30508p,shellwe,6,Tue Mar 24 18:38:27 2015 UTC,It is not necessary to progress with the Epic quest line. This is only needed if you want to do the side quests for faction rep and get access to Fornost instances.

lotro,30508p,Whitesymphonia,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:01:05 2015 UTC,"Helm's Deep, and I would recommend buying it when you have the TP for it. It unlocks the epic battles, which are 5 battles where you help command troops at Helm's Deep, play with siege weaponry, and assist the Rohirrim in surviving the enemy's onslaught. It is a pretty novel form of game play which can help bridge any gaps you'll have while leveling (you shouldn't have many, but just in case) and provides good jewelry upgrades. If you do enough of them, they also give you two trait points."

Apparently, Turbine are building out new datacenters in New Jersey and the Netherlands(?). They want to roll out the new datacenters and shake out issues on the new hardware before handing out the free transfers.  Basically, they're keeping the flood gates closed until they're relatively certain that they can handle the increased load on each of of the consolidated servers."

lotro,303v4o,MessyR,5,Wed Mar 25 12:32:53 2015 UTC,Yes. I've played on brandywine til I get injured my kin was pretty friendly and elite. They also extended copyright date as I know so it will get better imo.

lotro,303v4o,Mcwalleye,2,Wed Mar 25 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"1) It's FTP, at least to start.   2) There are still several well-populated servers and plenty of active kinships.   3) There will likely be new content released for the next two years. Turbine is under contract through 2017. They have announced plans for major releases for Osgiliath and Minas Tirith in 2015 along with a much overdue update to PvP. The general thinking is that development will follow the story into Mordor by the end, and that pace would mean Mordor probably hits late 2016-early 2017.   My general advice: if you are fan of LotR and want to try a MMORPG, give it a shot. Download, play through the FTP content and see if you like it. If you do, you can get a lot of content for not much money. If you don't like it, you haven't lost any money. The community is generally very helpful and friendly, and there's tons of content to support multiple alts without having to cover a lot of the same content."
lotro,303v4o,fadhero,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:36:04 2015 UTC,"I played over a year ago, mostly through the F2P content.

lotro,303v4o,MarathonManatee,-12,Sun Mar 29 01:21:22 2015 UTC,Nope not really. Fun for awhile but all the quests are really repetitive and boring.

In at- or above-level zones, you don't feel the need to kill every single mob that's in the way of your destination: you just sneak by them.   It gives you a chance to appreciate the scenery a little more. Maybe you want to sit at the top of Weathertop and watch the wildlife go by without killing them all to get there.   Or maybe you want to play hide-and-seek with a nearby warg! No one's stopping you, and you always have an out (Hide In Plain Sight) if it starts taking the game too seriously :)  And I don't care what other people think: ""Practical Joke"" is hilarious."

lotro,3037fg,porpoiseoflife,5,Tue Mar 24 04:26:58 2015 UTC,"There are two choices for Burglars: Men and Hobbits. Dwarves are too bulky to make burglars of sufficient quality, and elves are a bit too moral to wander off with someone's beer money... at least without first engaging them in a philosophical debate, which kinda defeats the purpose of making off with their beer money.  (And there are no Hobbit Champions at all. It's not an allowed combination. Don't ask me why.)"
lotro,3037fg,RyanRomanov,2,Tue Mar 24 04:52:07 2015 UTC,Well I wouldn't have to ask why.. Because it doesn't make sense in the world.  Would you trust a hobbit champion? I wouldn't.. I guess a debate could be made for Merry and Pippin but... Classing them as not only champions but then making the class available solely off them is a bit of a stretch.

lotro,3037fg,p0rt,7,Tue Mar 24 17:50:38 2015 UTC,"Burglars are jokers, not evil lone rogues. They are meant to play on a fellowship, throwing pocket sand and marbles at enemies. They're not designed as a lone broody character. They can be the heart of the fellowship. But they also sneak around, and are perfect for delivery/recovery/assasination quests ignoring patrols. I love burglars, they're pretty versatile."

lotro,303g9s,JamesFHJ,3,Tue Mar 24 03:47:40 2015 UTC,"Stats - Vitality & Might are important, with Fate and Agility less important, but still should not be neglected. Will is of least importance. Fate is the hardest to find boosts for with heavy armour, so look for good jewelry and virtues that will give you the boost there.  For my Deadly Storm Champ, I've added a few traits from blue line to get the Vitality boost, since yellow-line is somewhat squishy, and the Second Wind skill. Second Wind is a power regen that comes in handy in group instance content.  For attack skills, Fury of Blades, Raging Blades, and the improved Blade Wall are your best AoE attacks. Rend provides a nice AoE with bleed attack as well.  Edit: For rotations, I generally use Battle Frenzy, Rend and Swift Strike to build fervour for Fury of Blades and Raging Blades as much as possible. Use Exchange of Blades to reflect damage vs multiple mobs and Blade Wall as a filler attack when waiting for cooldowns. Lather, rinse, repeat."
lotro,303g9s,fadhero,5,Tue Mar 24 15:12:15 2015 UTC,"I support this in general, but I would elaborate on that a bit:   Fury of Blades does more damage depending on the amount of Fervour you have, use it with 5 points only until you get it Raging Blade is your best attack Bladestorm does to little damage for the 4 Fervour, do not bother with it unless everything else is on CD I would not go out of my way looking for agility and/or fate on gear, the five important stats while levelling are might+physical mastery+crit rating for damage and vitality and/or morale for survival Deadly Storm is the absolute best AoE class+spec combo in the game - that will affect your playstyle - what you want is usually pull four to five enemies and kill them before they kill you. If you are going from enemy to enemy or pulling max two at once you will be better off playing the red line spec."

lotro,2zy736,fadhero,2,Mon Mar 23 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"If you see yourself playing this game for several more months, then the Quad Pack is a great purchase. It permanently unlocks content for levels 50-85 along with lots of instances, skirmishes, war-steeds in East Rohan, etc. Depending on how quickly you go through the content, this might last you until the next sale, at which point you can buy Helm's Deep to unlock 85-95 quests, the Helm's Deep Battle, and Western Rohan.   If you don't see yourself playing much longer, then it might not be worth the money."

You need to be fully capped and rely heavily on your mit gambits, shield mastery etc. Skills like spear of destiny and defiant challenge need to be spammed to hold agro as well as running constanty through your dance of war and perserverance chain while using darkness before the dawn if you dont have a loremaster.

lotro,2zq33b,Kants_Pupil,2,Fri Mar 20 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"The short version: this so-called mouseover healing cannot be achieved with LOTROs plugin functionality. If you would like a technical explanation I can provide it, I am the current maintainer of the TravelWindow plugin, but I am in a hurry ATM."
lotro,2zq33b,Hyoss,1 point,Sat Mar 21 10:56:30 2015 UTC,"Perfect! Not the answer I really wanted, but it does let me know what I needed. Thank you for that. If you are so willing, I would enjoy learning more about it."
lotro,2zq33b,Hyoss,1 point,Sat Mar 21 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"The LOTRO UI does not allow (with one exception I can think of*) executing targeted skills without the entity you want the skill to affect being selected as the current target. There is no ""focus target"" and no self-cast modifier besides having nothing selected; you have to select a target and then execute a skill. Executing skills can be done via keybinds or clicking a quickslot with a skill in it, but even plugins cannot macro one mouseclick, however modified, into selecting a target and executing a particular skill. Additional hurdles are things like not being able to add keybinds to custom quickslots/quickslot bars, and that binding skills to the mouse can only be achieved (although limited) through very careful editing of the keymap config files.   In many years of healing without mouseovers in LOTRO and SWTOR I learned that you can be almost as effective at healing as with them; in context of those two MMOs I no longer wish for mouseovers because every reasonable healing task/challenge can be completed with the tools that you get. I would start using them for convenience if they were to become available though.  * There is a function called target forwarding. With it targeted you can target the boss and the heal will be cast on the bosses current target."
lotro,2zq33b,jwit83,1 point,Mon Mar 23 12:20:33 2015 UTC,"Neat. I had assumed that something to do with the available modified casting targets in WoW (like alt - self heal, ctrl - focus heal) might have something to do with it, but I didn't realize that it was also limited by the targeting system on that level.   I knew that the healing tasks were designed to be met within the system, but really enjoyed these click heal tools in other games and was hoping that I could use them to have a less jarring time trying to heal again in LOTRO. Thanks for your insights!"
lotro,2zq33b,Mencham,1 point,Mon Mar 23 21:07:38 2015 UTC,How do you typically switch to a new target to heal?  I found that moving the name list in the UI to close to the center of the screen works for me.  I have my UI changed up a good bit though.  When you move the fellowship list close to where the skills are simply clicking on the persons name is easy.  Obviously being in range is an issue any way you do it.
lotro,2zooz3,MattShimmerjugs,8,Fri Mar 20 10:19:08 2015 UTC,"I highly suggest you manage your plugin installations with the Plugin Compendium:  http://www.lotrointerface.com/downloads/info663-LOTROPluginCompendium.html  This tool will download and install them, and will also help keeping them up to date.  Most plugins will require some plugin library files from Turbine, those have to be installed separately, instructions can be found on lotrointerface.com somewhere.  After installation make sure you open the plugin manager ingame and set up the plugins - which plugins are loaded on which character is set ingame.

I use the first four regularly:   Daily tasks reference: checks your inventory and tells you which tasks you can currently finish, which items you can sell because you outlevelled them, which boards give reputation, and so on. Very useful, tasks are much less of a chore with this. Camp site reference: I use it to quickly see which camps have summoning horns. Legendary item planner: create a virtual legendary item, level it, upgrade it, see its statistics before spending time and money on real one. TitanBar: creates a toolbar at the top of the screen which presents some useful information. Such as gold, inventories and vaults of each character. Festival buddy: somewhat useful, provides festival quest lists, rewards, instructions, barter item lists.  Combat analysis: tracks combat statistics, but I haven't played enough to test it.  Hytbold assistant: I suppose it's useful for that quest line, but I haven't reached it yet, so no opinion. Item treasury: browse database of items, I never actually needed this. LOTRO compendium: lists items, deeds, quests, crafting. I wanted to plan what to craft for an alt, but it's difficult to browse. Terrain map: opened it once, it was fun, never actually needed it. VirtueView: lists deeds that provide virtues, up to level 85. I used wiki instead."

lotro,2zo5b2,Kungfuuu,3,Fri Mar 20 06:46:37 2015 UTC,"You are correct. When you kill an enemy, you get a ""Defeat Event"" which buffs two of your skills (not sure if more at higher levels, as I'm only 55 with my cap) and these are the skills you see in the box that pops up. One is a heal and one is an aoe damage+atk speed buff. It is a good idea to use one of them while you have Defeat Event active, as they will be more powerful. If the box is in an annoying spot, you can unlock the UI and move it around if you want."

Keep going up, you will cross three bridges and kill plenty of orcs before you reach him. After crossing the third bridge (the one in the distance in the picture), turn right, he should be hanging around the tents at the end of the path. You may have to wait until he respawns, but it shouldn't take long.   For the Rallying Cry pop-up, I don't know how to get rid of it, but you can move where it pops up so that it becomes less distracting. As you reach more difficult content, the heals and buffs that are triggered on enemy defeats are quite helpful, so put it somewhere convenient."

lotro,2zo5b2,majorlagg1,1 point,Sat Mar 21 04:24:04 2015 UTC,Not sure about this boss in general but some bosses have glitched respawn mechanics sometimes and you should just come back in a few hours.  The biggest offender is the troll in the south-eastern Lone Lanlands. Garzburg or something. He's supposed to respawn every few minutes after being killed but he's glitched out before and did not spawn again for over 30 minutes...
lotro,2znk83,WardenMadness,2,Fri Mar 20 01:44:29 2015 UTC,"As to why the premium edition is not on sale is a question only the LOTRO sales team can answer. They are free to put sales on their product however they want.  Regarding which edition to buy, it depends on the price and the list of bonuses you get. The titles and armor are cosmetic so for those it depends whether you really want those.  The rest of the bonuses are 1000 TP more than the base edition, an item worth 995 TP per character (but is best used only when you reach level 100 otherwise the bonus it gives will become useless in between) and additional quest log slots for convenience (40 Mithril Coins per Character = 320 TP per character). So for three characters that utilise those bonuses it becomes 1000 TP base, 995*3 TP = 2985 TP for the Crystals, 960 TP for the slots; so in total 4945 TP. 5000 TP is 50$ right now, so if you utilize those bonuses to the fullest on three characters you get the base edition + 50$ worth of store stuff plus additional cosmetics. Decide yourself."

Sometimes Buinen  Icy Crevasse, Barrows and Thievery and Mischief are nearly never played. Even when the Last one has a very good fight at the end.

lotro,2z3jgv,Cranyx,14,Sun Mar 15 05:30:00 2015 UTC,"I prefer the current aesthetic, as opposed to more photo-realism as you suggest. The style in the game is in line with the illustrations that Tolkien made like so. You could argue that I'm making an excuse for the dated texture resolution and low poly models. But I think the overall muddy-ness and glossy sheen the game has gives it a style.  just my two cents."
lotro,2z3jgv,Rockerpult_v2,3,Sun Mar 15 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"I would argue that Tolkien's drawing is much closer to the other picture I posted. I'm definitely not deluded enough to think that we can expect photo-realism, and I'm not even particularly calling for better graphics. What I'm saying is that, for instance, looking at the painting you see sharp high cliffs with white stone and bright green tops. LOTRO has much more angled and brown hills."

lotro,2z3jgv,BankaiSam,14,Sun Mar 15 05:50:04 2015 UTC,The environment textures are the least of Lotro's texture problems compartively. The character models are more outdated and more specifically their hair needs more attention than the environment.

lotro,2z0x86,fkitbaylife,1 point,Sun Mar 15 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"good for you. theres are reason turbine didnt mark the class as beginner friendly when you create the classes. i also tried playing warden, but stopped since the gambit system was very unusual and hard getting used to for me. i also know several guildmates who feel the same way, even tho most of them kept playing their warden. you cant say ""oh, it was easy for me, so it must be easy for everyone else""."
lotro,2z0x86,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Sun Mar 15 17:08:34 2015 UTC,"Turbine also marked Burglar as not beginner friendly, even though there's nothing hard about Burglars either. Especially after the class revamp. If you had any trouble with a class's difficulty after the class revamp, I don't even know what to say. It's a stupidly overpowered class too, use your fist/spear bleeds + Power attack line and you will win virtually all your fights even in PvMP.  This is true even on /world: everyone who doesn't play warden calls the class hard until they play it, you for some reason just decided to quit. There's nothing unusual about simple combinations."
lotro,2z0x86,fkitbaylife,2,Sun Mar 15 17:25:31 2015 UTC,"dude, im not even saying its the hardest thing ever, just that its unusual compared to the rest of the classes and that it takes some time getting used to. maybe turbine marked the classes not as beginner friendly, because they require a different playstyle than the other classes and you have to adjust around that. some classes are faceroll, others arent.  anyways, this is the last thing i have to say, since this whole ""discussion"" is rather stupid. difficulty isnt the same for everyone, even tho you try to deny that. have a nice day."

lotro,2z0x86,Arathaert,3,Sun Mar 15 00:50:44 2015 UTC,"Hm. Best in the moors is warden, hands down.  From experience as a creep, here's what I've seen of the three classes:   Warden: You can pretty easily take on most any creep solo, and you'll last a good respectable time vs 3-4. Go red line, but dip into blue for the heals and health, and you'll do just fine. #bleedspam Minstrel: You're the squishiest thing out there freepside, but you can heal yourself and your group. Healing in pvp is a whole new animal entirely, and a ton of fun, though, so you might enjoy it :) Loremaster: A good loremaster can last a long time vs multiple creeps - the CC is real and waterlore is nuts. Also, slightly snarky but entirely true, you have the power to lag out the creep raid whenever you like. :P   Each class has its strengths and weaknesses. Warden is the strongest out there. Minstrel is highly useful - you'll never find yourself without a group if you're any good at all. Loremaster is also incredibly potent solo and useful in group settings.  You've played them all to 40-50 and you prolly have a good idea of which you enjoy most. I'd pick that one and play it :)"

lotro,2yyac4,Rigero,5,Fri Mar 13 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"You will have to buy most expansions, and if you are unsure, remember that the lotro store will not offer you any expansions you already have. Also, you can log in on the Turbine account manager site to get a list of the expansions and other content you have access to. Any expansions you don't have are purchaseable with the turbine points in the store, but I have always bought them with cash in the marketplace website store, so I can't help you navigating to them in the store, but you could search for each expansion by name. For reference, use the quest pack access chart in the side bar to get a list of expansions.  Red line will be your best bet for leveling as you get higher damage output. Yellow also has decent DPS since it allows you to tank with a two handed weapon. Blue can be decent later when you have enough trait points and decent legacies on your items, but it is likely that Red and Yellow will be much stronger for you at this time.   If you get a chance to play with someone else, you might look into doing an epic battle. It is a new(er) content style where you assist the Rohirrim in defending Helm's Deep using siege weaponry, squads of soldiers, and by engaging the foe directly. It has its own advancement stuff, so the more you play the better you get, and it is currently the main way to get jewelry, especially at max level. If you have the Helm's Deep expansion, it is a lot of fun and breaks up the monotony of solo questing pretty well."

Make sure you dip into radiate and insult to injury in yellow line, though - those two traits will drastically increase your damage output in red line. Recently, I've been running red line sword and board because I like the feel of it.  For tanking, I went blue line straight up all the way through. I toyed with yellow when it came out, but find blue to be more sturdy/reliable. Granted, I never took the time to thoroughly learn yellow line, but at cap, every guard I know will run blue line for serious tanking and with good reason. And it works at lower levels perfectly fine :)  I did write a guardian guide a few months back you might find interesting reading. I've since hit cap, and it's all still true :P And the guardian forums as a whole are absolutely packed with great information and discussion about the class.   Welcome back to the game!

It's easiest to consider the Mines of Moria as a dividing line. Everything pre-Moria (the vanilla content) which takes you up to level 50ish, is free to VIP's. If you are not VIP, you'd need to buy the quest packs for North Downs, Trollshaws, Misty Mountains, Evendim, Forochel, Eregion (?) and Angmar in order to freely access this content. I might be missing one or two. So for everything up to Moria, the simple answer is to buy all the quest packs, in order to have it permanently unlocked.  Starting with Moria, everyone has to buy the content, even VIP's. The Helm's Deep expansion is still $39.99, the rest are $19.99 I believe. If you can, buying the expansion gets you everything, so just do that. You'd need Mines of Moria, Siege of Mirkwood, Riders of Rohan, and Helm's Deep. Moria includes two classes (the Warden and Rune-keeper) which you WON'T get if you buy only the cheaper Moria quest pack. For each expansion you can buy either the quest pack or the expansion, except Helm's Deep which is expansion only. So to answer your question: buy all of the pre-Moria quest packs, and then buy the four expansion packs, and you'll have it all without duplicating anything. Hope that helps."
lotro,2yx5jo,Vestus65,3,Fri Mar 13 19:16:30 2015 UTC,"TBH, Mirkwood is pretty skippable unless you want to do skraids or the instance cluster at endgame. It's the only expansion that doesn't directly gate your progression to 100.  At the same time, it's included in the Quad Pack, which is definitely a purchase I recommend over buying expansions individually."
lotro,2yx5jo,tobascodagama,2,Fri Mar 13 19:30:56 2015 UTC,"I already have Moria and Mirkwood. Is it possible to buy the other old expansions separately at a big discount, or is the quad pack still going to be cheaper when it's on sale?"
lotro,2yx5jo,BlameTheNargles,3,Fri Mar 13 23:06:09 2015 UTC,"Ahh, I see.  Looks like Isengard and Rohan are both $20 at the moment, with the Quad Pack priced at $40. So it's kind of a wash. I'd probably just grab whatever goes on sale next."
lotro,2yx5jo,tobascodagama,2,Sat Mar 14 02:07:17 2015 UTC,"Or just sub for a month and get to 50, buy the quad pack off the site and TP farm to buy HD"
lotro,2yx5jo,StevenTM,1 point,Sat Mar 14 21:58:58 2015 UTC,"Thanks that helps alot. I still have a question with the instances, skirmishes and raids, do they come with the expansions or do you have to buy them separately?"
lotro,2yx5jo,Vestus65,1 point,Sat Mar 14 09:24:10 2015 UTC,"I believe the expansions contain the raids/instances/skirmishes for their zones. That's what differentiates them from the less costly quest packs for each zone (and in the case of Moria, the two new classes as well). But I would like to have that confirmed. I personally have purchased all of the expansions just because, like you, I want that content unlocked on my account once and for all."
lotro,2yx5jo,MotherlyBear,2,Sat Mar 14 18:18:05 2015 UTC,"Moria and Mirkwood quest packs come with the raids/instances, any expansion quest pack after that does not. The Skirmishes are actually free to play, you get them from doing the Epic Book quests."
lotro,2yx5jo,tobascodagama,5,Sun Mar 15 06:30:28 2015 UTC,"There was a really good guide to this that I could swear was stickied, though I can't find it now.  There's this comment, though: https://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/2manqb/what_do_you_wish_you_had_known_when_you_started/cm2qrhy"
lotro,2yx5jo,shellwe,2,Fri Mar 13 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"I would recommend getting 2 characters as far as you can, you can get to 33 just from the lonelands. Then go vip for a month and log in with both characters, feel free to add other characters in other servers as well. I think this unlocks more character slots too so make more and just log in once. In that month get both of your characters to 45 wherever you want before your subscription runs out; evindem and north downs is a pretty easy place to do that.  From there try to enjoy any premium raids, skirmishes, or instances you can. Or level a 3rd room to 45. When your subscription expires buy mines of moria, go into Moria, you just have to be 45. Between your 2 (or 3) toons that will keep you busy for another 300 hours, at least. Isengard and others go on sale from time to time."
lotro,2yug5x,OJSTheJuice,9,Thu Mar 12 22:20:47 2015 UTC,"I spent my points so I had access to everything that VIP got that Premium doesn't have, with additional TP for upcoming areas. I probably spent about 11000 TP to get everything I wanted and still got 4-5000 to spare. For me that's the best solution as I have mostly stopped playing the game. There are of course other ways of spending a ton of TP, but if you want to have a mostly free MMO to go back to, this is a nice option."
lotro,2yug5x,Zzzlol94,1 point,Thu Mar 12 22:29:11 2015 UTC,"I think that's my plan too.  Too bad you can't actually see which areas you need to buy while you are still VIP, it makes it hard to know how much TP is needed to get everything."
lotro,2yug5x,exploderator,5,Fri Mar 13 12:48:01 2015 UTC,Do not buy Expansions with TP - they cost proportionally more than the $ value from buying them in the store.  Wait until the next time the quad (or maybe quint) pack goes on sale and buy the expansions heavily discounted then.  You could buy Quest Packs or nice QoL enhancements like Milestones and cooldowns.
lotro,2yug5x,Darchseraph,3,Fri Mar 13 09:54:21 2015 UTC,"This would be true for someone new to the game, but the OP has an excess of TP that they've already paid for.  Paying $s for the expacs is normally my advice as well, but for this case, I'd just buy all the content I'm interested in, waiting for a sale to do so of course."

lotro,2yug5x,mdtexeira,2,Fri Mar 13 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Like Darch says...not by a huge percentage, but you've already got the TP...no point spending RL money unless you've got some burning a hole in your pocket.  Just play the game, and buy new content as you want it.  If you're playing, you'll get more TP anyway.  Oh, and I second PurpleWorm in saying to get the advanced wallet.  So much nicer than having to use bank and bag slots for all that stuff."

lotro,2yug5x,Kants_Pupil,3,Fri Mar 13 09:43:08 2015 UTC,"Here are some of the stand out items that I remember from the store. I broke it down into account wide upgrades that would benefit you if you play a ton of characters and some per character upgrades that bring some quality of life if you can still afford them.  For your account:  6th bag - an additional 15 inventory spaces for every character.  Journeyman Riding - All mounts have 78% speed and each character gets riding and a mount after leaving the introduction zone (like Archette before it burns for men/hobbits/beorning).   Quest Packs and Expansions: If you don't have them already, Evendim, either Angmar or Forochel (your preference), Moria, Mirkwood, Isengard, Rohan, Helm's Deep. Also, if you skip any areas but want the instances, tack those on too.   Character Slots: Any you need to have all the characters you once had or want now.  Premium Wallet Upgrade: frees up a ton of space in inventories to keep things that should have always been currency out of your bags. This makes virtually everything that involves the barter system into a currency.  Guild Access: 300 TP per guild to access the best recipes and crafted relics. Opens it account wide if I understand correctly.  Specific Character Upgrades: If you only play one or two characters, opening some other features for individual characters can be nice too.  Travel Traits: Hurried and Returning Traveller + Milestones: -25 minutes on all travel skills and another -30 minutes on milestone skills means a 35 min cd for each return to x and 5 min shared cd for milestones. The second part is especially nice if you buy additional milestone skills.  Legendary slots: get up to 10 weapons/items leveling at once, especially nice for classes that have strong variation among trait lines that are represented in legacies (for instance, RKs have a lot of Yellow/Blue/Red specific legacies so it is usually better to have separate items for each trait line which means keeping around 6 items at all times, leaving no space or little space for items to level and deconstruct for relics and shards).  Stat Tomes: Save a ton of time or gold buying stat upgrades on a main character.  Mithril Coins: use them to buy additional trait lines and epic battle progression paths if you find yourself buying refunds often."
lotro,2yug5x,tjb490,2,Fri Mar 13 23:06:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was in the same boat. I bought all of the expansions, bought a +25% experience pocket item (which is account bound), character slots, enough to use each class (beorning has a bundle with slot). Inventory slots, I have over 100 slots now and I am in love with it, never worrying about bag space with auto loot on. I don't know what the situation with legendary slots is for you so maybe make sure you have at least three. (Weapon, Class Item, War-Horse)  Another thing is shared storage and wardrobe. Shared storage makes things really easy especially if you have a lot of characters."

lotro,2yvaru,lovemypony45,3,Fri Mar 13 02:37:11 2015 UTC,"For an LM, I'd recommend Red Line. It'll greatly increase your damage but at the cost of being very squishy and having a very average pet. I used Blue Line from 1-85 and my Bog Guardian and Saber Cat would killed everything before I had time to cast anything more than a Burning Ember.   Past 85 though, even with every trait improvement my pets would die to anything more than two enemies at a time, so I had to learn how to run a Red Line LM properly, which is why I recommend you just run one from the beginning.   Add points in Blue here and there (mainly for you and your pets Morale). Yellow is never worth it."
lotro,2yvaru,cantijustbeanonymous,3,Fri Mar 13 04:08:53 2015 UTC,"I can't speak for Beorning, as mine is only lvl 10, but I have a near max LM so I'm relatively experienced with the class.  You can probably solo most of the game in the red line. It's the DPS line and you'll be putting out a ton of AoE damage. It's definitely the fastest way through content, as long as you're not dying. I ran into problems near the higher levels, namely Rohan and Gondor, where I couldn't take on more than a couple mobs while playing in Red Line, but that might just have been my lack of skill.  If you are having trouble, then blue line is the answer. The blue seems designed to be a solo-friendly trait line, as it's a pet-focused build that allows your pet to tank and absorb a ton of damage. The capstone skill ""Sic 'Em"" unleashes all your pets on an enemy for a brief period of time, allowing you to take on even elite masters. The pets have good DPS, so you'll still get through content fast enough, but I'm not sure it reaches the same levels as red line.  Yellow line can mostly be forgotten until you get into group content (and even then, it's not necessary for most runs). It can be fun to play around with, but the debuffing skills aren't necessary for solo content and just take away from DPS."
lotro,2yvaru,Onistly,3,Fri Mar 13 03:45:05 2015 UTC,The interesting thing is that I found playing Blue Line to be the strongest at solo content for LM. Your pet becomes beastmode and out-DPSes most other classes all on its own (Specifically talking about the Bog Guardian...35m Range is nothing to sneeze at). You are free to contribute relatively poor DPS but more importantly to cast Utility skills - especially the ones that you need for your class trait deeds.  As for Beorning: Red Line = Monster single target DPS. Blue Line = Much better survivability and wrath generation due to Hearten - also generally better AoE DPS at until you unlock AoE Tier 3 Thrash in red.
lotro,2yvaru,Darchseraph,1 point,Fri Mar 13 09:31:55 2015 UTC,"For LM's, leveling in red is pretty solid. Lots of ways to improve your damage overall, large increases to your fire damage, and a few ways to access new, longer cool down but huge damage skills. Later, when soloing, blue can be pretty good too given the strength it pumps into your pet and yellow is great if you are dealing with really strong enemies that you need to keep in check, though that is more for group play than solo.  For Beorning, red will increase your damage substantially, and I would think it makes soloing the easiest while leveling. Blue mostly focuses on survivability and threat, so while you could do most everything with it, it may take longer than is fun like being a guardian. The yellow line is pretty focused on support and healing, so expect leveling/soloing with it to be slow and hard, but not impossible."

lotro,2yolhd,tjb490,9,Wed Mar 11 14:57:26 2015 UTC,I'm at 100 with my Warden and have recently discovered the bliss of gambit chains. These are 2+3+4 or 2+3+5 series of gambits that stack for insane effects. Here's a copy/paste from an earlier post with these:  Related to all of this and in support of general Warden badassery: don't forget gambit chains. Running the right series of three gambits can lead to very powerful stacking of effects:  Perseverance + Safeguard + Celebration of Skill (4-gambit build)  Perseverance + Safeguard + Restoration (5-gambit build)  Impressive Flourish + Maddening Strike + Dance of War (4-gambit build)  Impressive Flourish + Maddening Strike + Conviction (5-gambit build)  War-cry + Brink of Victory + Surety of Death (4-gambit build)  War-cry + Brink of Victory + Desolation (5-gambit build)  Working these gambit chains has helped me immensely.
lotro,2yolhd,ceeller,7,Wed Mar 11 20:03:40 2015 UTC,"To clarify:   The Shield+Spear gambits and chain are Heal over Time and will keep you alive in the messiest of fights The Shield+Fist gambits and chain are (sadly I can't remember the specific differences other than they aren't as much AOE) The Fist+Shield gambits and chain are AOE damage over time and great when fighting in a scrum   I usually kite in several mobs and start off with the Shield+Spear chain (Perseverance chain) to get the HoTs going, then I use the Fist+Shield chain (War-Cry chain) to deal out AOE damage over time. The nice thing is all of these gambits STACK. Chain one, then the other, then back again.  It can be slow going but you are pretty much un-defeatable and a one-Warden Fellowship with all the HoTs and DoTs happening.  Once in a while I pop Shield Mastery to get some extra protection: Shield+Spear+Fist+Shield"
lotro,2yolhd,ceeller,3,Wed Mar 11 20:35:04 2015 UTC,"How much of a boost are you getting doing the sequence? For example, am I just better off putting on Spear of Virtue and Unerring Strike? Seems like the full sequence isn't gaining you enough."
lotro,2yolhd,baue8673,5,Wed Mar 11 21:02:32 2015 UTC,"The chains are useful while leveling so that you learn the different gambits better. But at cap, the bonus effects of going through the full chains are fairly underpowered and just take too much time away from being able to react to the situation at hand."
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,5,Wed Mar 11 21:12:00 2015 UTC,"These numbers are for me with my LIs and Blue Line spec. I usually start the Persevere gambit chain:   Persevere: 1779-2807 damage, +1292 block, heal 510 morale initially, then heal 510 morale every 3 seconds for 15 seconds (healing 3060 morale over 15 seconds) Safeguard: 434 damage, +1940 block (stacks with the +1292 for a little bit), heal 1341 morale initially, heal 1341 morale every 3 seconds for 15 seconds (healing 8046 morale for 15 seconds (stacks for a little bit with the 3060 morale above)) Restoration (5-part gambit): 1779-2807 damage, +773 morale temporarily, heal 1848 morale initially, then heal 1848 morale every 3 seconds for 15 seconds (healing 11,088 morale for 15 seconds (partially stacking with earlier heals))   I then usually use the War-Cry chain for the AOE effect (10 meters and max 10 targets).   War-Cry: 747 light damage, 747 light damage every 4 seconds for 16 seconds (total 3735 light damage over 16 seconds), +1444 Evade Brink of Victory: 1865 light damage, 1865 light damage every 4 seconds for 16 seconds (total 9325 light damage over 16 seconds), + 1768 Evade Desolation (5-part gambit): 2770 light damage, 2770 light damage every 4 seconds for 16 seconds (total 13,850 light damage over 16 seconds), +7% Miss, every 4 seconds chance to cause Fear for 2 seconds   If I don't want AOE damage I go with the Impressive Flourish gambit chain. I don't have all of the buffs noted down:   Impressive Flourish: 1776 light damage, 747 light damage every 4 seconds for 16 seconds (total 4764 light damage over 16 seconds), several mitigations for me Maddening Strike: 2725-4255 damage, several mitigations for me Conviction (5-part gambit): heal 826 morale, heal 826 morale every 3 seconds for 15 seconds (total 4956 morale healed over 15 seconds), bonus to defense, + tactical mitigation, applies to Fellowship within 10 meters   Firing off these gambits within the chain allows for them to stack for the time that they overlap. My Warden has about 21,000 morale and middle of the road gear, I have so far soloed groups of 6 or 7 on level mobs (19,000 - 38,000 morale each) no problem. I could have pulled 6 more and been fine as long as I don't get stunned too often and let my Perseverance chain expire. While taking hits from all of those mobs I was over-healing and keeping my morale full.  This is full Blue line traited with some Red thrown in for bleeds. Your numbers will vary, but the idea will still the similar."
lotro,2yolhd,ceeller,3,Thu Mar 12 01:29:37 2015 UTC,If you're full blue specced and use the masteries you should be able to get all four gambits in the Persevere chain to stack.
lotro,2yolhd,dr_amy_bishop,3,Mon Mar 16 18:27:04 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Masteries would definitely speed things up. Sadly, I've not worked out my Masteries patterns for gambits other than ""Darkness Before the Dawn"" and ""Warden's Triumph""."
lotro,2yolhd,ceeller,3,Mon Mar 16 21:48:30 2015 UTC,"Lemme look at my numbers at 100 and reply. Chains do take longer to kill, the trade off is my Morale stays pegged at full while I tap the mobs for everything they have: morale, power, wallet, watch, and keys. I can then kite in the next game for a scrum.  I'll check on my numbers and post. The HoT and DoT numbers surprised me."
lotro,2yolhd,ceeller,5,Wed Mar 11 22:39:24 2015 UTC,I've had a warden since the first day Moria was released and to this day I've never been able to get the hang of it. This... this is something I can work with. Thank you!
lotro,2yolhd,msbq,6,Thu Mar 12 03:57:25 2015 UTC,"I don't think you need to use BLUE for leveling... I went to 100 in RED with a little BLUE thrown in later, when I had the points.  You need to learn your gambit masteries as you get them (the skills that execute two builders at the same time). That significantly increases the speed of putting down the hurt on mobs :-)  These two rotation will suffice for 95% of stuff you bump into on the way to 100.  Single target rotation:     Spear of Virtue   (fi-sp-fi-sp)     Piercing Strike   (fi-sp-fi)     Surety of Death   (fi-sh-fi-sh)     Desolation   (fi-sh-fi-sh-fi)     Restoration   (sh-sp-sh-sp-sh)   Multiple target rotation:     Surety of Death   (fi-sh-fi-sh)     Desolation   (fi-sh-fi-sh-fi)     Exultation of Battle   (fi-sp-sh-fi-sh)     Resolution   (fi-sp-sh-fi)     Brink of Victory   (fi-sh-fi)   Have fun. The above won't be enough for fellowship stuff, but you can grow into that. The rotation are based on using DoTs, and there is time to add other gambits .. but those are the damage/healing DoTs/HoTs you should rotate through."
lotro,2yolhd,PurpleWorm,3,Thu Mar 12 13:57:42 2015 UTC,"This is solid advice, just a few comments I'd make are:   move desolation and surety of death above piercing strike in the single target rotation, ive found they do more damage even to a single target. move exultation of battle to the first spot in the aoe rotation, getting your main sustain ability up early allows for the healing to start rolling in faster when you need it. in aoe fights, always use goad or one of the other potency gambits just before resolution to save it as an oh s*** button in battle memory.   And just a comment about the single target rotation, most mobs will die from Spear of Virtue and Desolation alone, so I tend to just throw those up and run to the next mob and let the 10% heal on defeat keep me topped up.  As I said at the beginning though, that's some solid advice, man"
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,3,Thu Mar 12 14:30:59 2015 UTC,"Those comments are very helpful. Thank you very much! I've just hit lvl. 40 and although I've read alot about howtoplay as a warden I feel like I'm playing it wrong sometimes. I pretty much always play in a group with rk,hunter and lm, so i go for the blue line because the others do obviously enough damage and I need to tank. IMy rotation goes something like this: Battleprep. Shield Mastery & Shield tactics Then run in the mobs use Defiant Challenge and Goad and start with a rotation pretty similar to your Multiple target rotation but with the skills available at my level.. Most of the time it works just fine, but when the rk is dead or can't heal I find myself unable to keep alive over longer time periods, because I'm almost always to late with the sh-sp gambits, do you guys have some good advice for tanking? Furthermore we duel alot for fun, but I tend to stande no chance against the rk and the hunter, I've read alot about ""warden aren't very strong until lategame"" so it that the case, or am I doing it wrong?^ thanks for your answers :)"
lotro,2yolhd,muestack,6,Thu Mar 12 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"For tanking, I would advise against using opening with Defiant Challenge if you want max threat. Since Defiant Challenge not only force taunts for 3 or so seconds (not sure about real duration), but it makes your threat equal to 130% of the highest threat at the time you pop DC. So opening with DC will just use the taunt, but will do nothing for your overall threat as 130% of 0 is still 0. But if you open with, for instance, Exultation of Battle, Brink of Victory, and Desolation, THEN you pop DC  you will get the threat from 3x the damage and healing the skills do because of the blue line threat bonus, and then multiply that by 1.3 so you would end up with a much easier time holding aggro.  If any of that was hard to follow, I apologize; typing on my phone while having been stuck in a car all day Is hell for me."
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,3,Thu Mar 12 18:22:53 2015 UTC,"Uh didn't know that. Tried it out and there is really quite a bit a difference. Although I need a little bit longer because i build up goad for battle memory, desolation and THEN dc, I can now pull most of the mobs to me. Thx!"
lotro,2yolhd,muestack,3,Tue Mar 17 10:19:38 2015 UTC,"You're lucky you have a consistent group going, as that'll really improve your fellowship-ing in the long run!  Something that hasnt come up yet: make sure to stand on the opposite side of the mobs than the rest of your fellowship. That has two major benefits. 1) you can see when you loose aggro easily as the mob will turn from you, and 2) the mobs can't block attacks of your fellows with their back turned to them.  I still group up in my red line, so I can't really give tips on playing in blue........  Regarding the question if it gets better later, I would say yes. You probably still have stuff to unlock (gambits etc) and once you have legendary items that improve the performance of your skills and attacks, things'll get even better :D"

The only way red line can get aggro is by trying to out-dps everyone, so you would have to tell everyone to give you 3 seconds or so to get your DoTs rolling before they unleash. Once you get higher level, you could dip into blue line for DC, but even then you would be more effective going blue line to tank."
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,3,Tue Mar 17 13:26:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I've just made it to my hotel for the night, and I've decided I'm far too tired to really do justice to a true Warden guide. I will have the opportunity to really sit down and dig into what a Warden guide needs after I return home and have had a good night's rest in my own bed. I don't expect to be finished until Friday or Saturday, but in the mean time; the advice of some of the other replies here are definitely good places to start your journey into the Badassery of the Warden."
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,1 point,Thu Mar 12 01:00:55 2015 UTC,"can't wait for your guide. i have lvl 81 warden and i think i can play him pretty well, but i always love to see other players play styles and compare it to mine. and also commenting to be noticed :D"
lotro,2yolhd,WelCZa,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:47:17 2015 UTC,Original estimation of when I'd be done was way optimistic and forgot to account for IRL commitments. No ETA as of now.
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,1 point,Fri Mar 13 22:39:41 2015 UTC,"Red or blue line, the difference is small while leveling imo. Spam Precise Blow (fist-spear) until you hit level 16, then spam Surety of Death (fist-shield-fist-shield) until level 100."
lotro,2yolhd,legofreak11,4,Wed Mar 11 15:36:47 2015 UTC,"I played the class to level 40 or so a few years back, and have tried a few times since.  I guess I never really got if you're supposed to memorize gambits, or supposed do the same rotation every time, or whatever.  Or if it's expected for you to be able to pull some random gambit out of your ass on the fly if a boss in grouped content calls for it.  I kinda just found a way to kill things while leveling, but without the meaning behind what I was doing, and thus every time I didn't play the toon for like 2 weeks, I'd forget my rotations and was too discouraged to try to start over again.  I hope more people comment like yours; I know the class has gone through innumerable revisions and, at least at one point in time, I remember reading that the devs' intentions were to make the gambit lines and traits etc more intuitive so it was less about mechanical repetition and more about ""I know I want to do X [heal myself, do damage over time, do high burst DPS], these are a few options I have to do it.""  I also never quite figured out the cost/benefit analysis of executing larger/longer gambits that delay the effect by the amount of time it takes for your character to carry out the actions, but are more potent/powerful than shorter gambits.  I imagine the CombatAnalysis testing required to compare hard numbers in that way would be quite tedious."
lotro,2yolhd,7h3C47,-5,Wed Mar 11 19:58:35 2015 UTC,Wow and people say hunters are just pew pew pew. Well... they are too :)
lotro,2yolhd,elrohir_ancalin,8,Wed Mar 11 16:13:26 2015 UTC,A lot more goes into wardens than that

lotro,2ykoh0,Ataniphor,10,Tue Mar 10 16:48:55 2015 UTC,I'd save up for MoM expansion. It's a better deal.
lotro,2ykoh0,JKtheSlacker,3,Tue Mar 10 17:11:22 2015 UTC,"What about the Quad-pack available on steam? it sorta feels like a better deal.  But hey, i completely understand if you don't feel like spending a lot of rl money on a game you very casually play.  If the question was more like, are they enjoyable classes then yes.  i atleast very much like the idea of how the runekeeper works..  But for me the beorning class is gold.  it gives you that berserkery man-ego boost, but it also let's you be a pretty decent buffer.  i liek it. >>This links to the quadpack<<"
lotro,2ykoh0,kelroth,3,Wed Mar 11 00:42:45 2015 UTC,"OP specifically said no more real money. That, and the Quad Pack is really only worth it if you can catch it on deep discount IMO."

Source: I did it successfully.  As it happened, I got moria QP through the mithril pack, and bought warden and RK on discount like it is now. I got HD, so my skirmish cap was raised already too. Altogether not a bad deal."

lotro,2ykoh0,Kungfuuu,1 point,Wed Mar 11 07:20:22 2015 UTC,"Wow does that really work? I also have Moria QP through mithril edition and I bought the RoR xpack, so I assume I have the soldier cap (haven't tried leveling her up that high yet though). Was thinking of getting warden now, but you're saying if I get RK as well, I can essentially get 2 char slots free?"
lotro,2ykoh0,freedaemons,2,Thu Mar 12 11:21:14 2015 UTC,"That is correct, I'm not the first one to do it either, read it on the forums and gave it a try. Just file a ticket and ask nicely, explain the situation, how you have everything from the moria expac and have heard you can unlock the expac's free slots. They got the slots unlocked for me really quickly."
lotro,2ykoh0,ceeller,2,Thu Mar 12 14:03:02 2015 UTC,"Personally speaking, I love my Warden. It's my main character and a complex mini Fellowship in a single character."

lotro,2yjv3o,object404,3,Tue Mar 10 12:29:33 2015 UTC,"I believe the old max was 22, so now it's 23 with the beorning slot. Not sure if that's including the two VIP slots."
lotro,2yjv3o,freedaemons,2,Wed Mar 11 03:48:01 2015 UTC,"if the old max was 22, there's a possibility that it might even be 24 with the Beorning: I've read that the new +1 max slot is separate from the Beorning + character slot bundle, so if one bought the Beorning + slot bundle, one could also buy the + 1 slot separately on top of that, increasing the new total by 2!"

lotro,2yjv3o,-Exquisite-,2,Tue Mar 10 15:31:04 2015 UTC,Honest question here. What do people use so many characters for? All I have is one character for each class. Not sure why I would need anymore.
lotro,2yjv3o,magnumthepi,2,Sun Mar 15 14:08:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is a very good question.  The answer is for storing loot. Turn them into mule storage, just like with Diablo. Do you have any idea how much space it takes to collect every single festival & rare cosmetic & decoration in the game?  Also to level up every single crafting profession to max level in the game (hoarding materials for that takes a lot of space), to store vegetables and ingredients for cooks too...  The hoarding of materials is important if you craft the daily, every other day & weekly recipes & the relics that you can break down for shards."
lotro,2yjv3o,other64,1 point,Sun Mar 15 14:57:56 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I don't know anyone who has that many, I only have 9 myself. I suppose the only way is to keep buying..."

lotro,2yjv3o,shellwe,1 point,Wed Mar 11 13:29:48 2015 UTC,If it is just for muling then you can make some alt accounts. I know people who leveled enough to buy a house and then shared all privileges with their main. But I would recommend consolidating your stuff.

That would also be me ;P but it's a hassle.  Multiboxing is a hassle. Mailing and re-logging into different accounts using a single instance, moreso.  Also, you cannot transfer account-bound items between different accounts, whereas you can do it via shared storage with a single account."
lotro,2yjv3o,shellwe,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:00:38 2015 UTC,"If you do the house you can get the double chest and then just share privileges to pay for housing and access with your other account. Then you won't have to log in to that toon again. The main hassle is getting him to lvl 15, but in the elven lands that's not hard.  But with this person I would really recommend not storing so much, they should talk to their kin about what they really need to keep and what they can give to others... that is just a lot of toons."
lotro,2yjv3o,shellwe,1 point,Tue Mar 17 13:41:22 2015 UTC,you can't share account-bound objects via chests of other players.  I have 3 alt account houses + our kin has 5 kin houses for hanging decors and storing stuff in.

lotro,2yi0vj,Lvl69DragonSlayer,3,Mon Mar 9 23:45:22 2015 UTC,"Don't let yourself get overwhelmed. Since you're new to MMOs, you may hit a spot where you are overwhelmed with all the detail, and you will likely make mistakes (this happened to me as I was in your shoes when I started this game). Crafting, traits, virtues, gear, cosmetics, etc. can be a bit much. Don't be afraid to step back and reassess from time-to-time. The Lotro Wiki is a great resource. Use the Class Deeds to teach and reteach yourself skills. If you find that there is a deed for using a skill you don't often use, add it to your tracker so that you can learn the skill better. Skills may also improve or have new buffs or features as you level. Once you master your skill set and trait trees, you can take on higher level mobs and quests that give more XP For me, there was a temptation to try to do every quest from every hub in a region. If you want to level quickly, this will slow you down. Try to group as many quests together as much as you can, but don't be afraid to cancel a quest if it will take too long for not much XP or swag.  IIRC Epic quests give more XP than regular side quests. However, you can usually skip ahead to the next book of the epic quest line as long as you are within 4-5 levels of the quest. Pushing yourself to the highest level content you can safely run will maximize XP. There is more than enough content for one player to do on-level, so you should be able to push to harder content whenever you want.  Gear - you don't have to worry as much about gear until you get near level cap. Quests usually provide sufficient gear to keep you on-level or a little above. Reputation vendors usually have good gear if you have the right currency and rep level. Skirmish vendors can be utilized to supplement your gear if you haven't come across a good piece of armor or jewelry in awhile and it has gone well below your level. Crafting can provide good gear as well, but if you are interested in leveling quickly, the crafting grind may slow you down."
lotro,2yi0vj,fadhero,1 point,Tue Mar 10 17:36:12 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info, I actually got pretty into the crafting grind as an armourer. The Lotro wiki helped me with that, I managed to get mastery in everything up to Artisan level now I'm working on the book 2 quests in the lone lands."

Also the wiki is godly for finding tips and tricks. Guard doesn't do as much dps as other classes so try to team with a champ or mini or.... Enjoy.
lotro,2yi0vj,ObsessedWithHobbits,3,Tue Mar 10 05:21:02 2015 UTC,"6 weeks and lvl 100, whattttt. I've been playing for more then a year and my highest is 61."

lotro,2yfle7,notwhoithink,6,Mon Mar 9 11:48:32 2015 UTC,"I've been through that entire dilemma too, and I just pick the Beleriand + physical mastery now, because even if it is only 1% more damage, that applies to everything, all the time, not just orcs.  I used to like Beleriand + straight stats too, but I think it's only +37 agility or vitality, and that just isn't very relevant compared to 400 physical mastery.  And that is a principle I try to go with in general: pick stuff that does damage everywhere / all the time, instead of stuff that only applies in limited cases.  That goes for legacies, traits, etc.."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,5,Mon Mar 9 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"I did some math after posting, and it looks like even on a pretty weak hit (1500 damage) the roughly 2% I'd get from 400 physical mastery is good for 13-14 points of damage. On an average hit that would be more than the 17 points I'm getting with Uruk Slayer anyways so I guess it's on to Hytbold to get the other title."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,2,Mon Mar 9 14:49:06 2015 UTC,"Combined reply: yes Beleriand is best (most broad damage kind), and thanks for doing the math, because the 400 physical mastery per title adds up better than I thought, and like I said, that helps with EVERY shot.  Later on, there might be titles on a higher level again (tier 3?), maybe from Helm's Deep, I can't remember for sure."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:23:41 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the titles in Hytbold are T2, the ones in Derndingle (Fangorn) bartered with Quickbeam are T3, which gives you 500 physical mastery.  Called Conflict of Eldar Days III."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,1 point,Tue Mar 10 15:17:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, I wondered if there was a T3. Never been to Derndingle though. Is that part of the Gondor zones?"

lotro,2yfle7,7h3C47,1 point,Tue Mar 10 16:43:25 2015 UTC,"Unless you do tons of Fangorn instances, you might prefer to save those titles for your L100 LI's, because each one costs 100 Fangorn tokens, which is 3 or 4 days worth of doing all the possible instances and quests, which is expensive.  When the T2 titles in Hytbold only cost a single run through a single instance, and still giving you 400 PM, they are a way better deal.  And in general, it's the L100 LI's that will be upgradeable, so the L95's are kind of a minor stepping stone now, not really worth spending a bunch of legacy tier upgrades and all that stuff."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:02:44 2015 UTC,Good to know.
lotro,2yfle7,7h3C47,1 point,Tue Mar 10 21:13:09 2015 UTC,"The dirt: there was a fairly angry outcry when L100 / Gondor was released, with an entire new set of LI's, but only a mere 5 levels past the L95 LI's we had all spent so much time, effort, and in many cases real money to build.  It was too much too soon.  In response, Turbine promised that L100 LI's will able to be upgraded by ""imbuing"" them with some special something, so that we won't have to build more LI's right away.  I don't know how far that will hold, but maybe if we're lucky, it will take us through to the end.  I know the promise has been made, and I think it might even have seen beta (not sure), but I know I saw something about it recently that reassured me that it was actually going to happen, not just a lie told to quell an uprising, and I sighed a big sigh of relief.  What that means for LI priorities though is a slightly awkward transition from L85 to L95 to L100, with L95 being not worth big energy outlay.  A L95 Second Age ""good enough"" main would probably be about right (cheap), given that a hunter's mele is all but irrelevant by that level, unless a First Age symbol drops in your lap and you really are compulsive."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,2,Tue Mar 10 21:56:38 2015 UTC,"I guess one other thought is that Beleriand damage also gives a damage bonus against Orcs (amongst other things), so between the damage type and the physical mastery you'll at least break even versus the straight + damage to Orcs."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,4,Mon Mar 9 15:11:55 2015 UTC,"It took me far too long to realize that i didn't have to keep legacies for skills I rarely ever used on my LIs.  As a hunter, I think I have 3 actual skill related legacies on my off-hand, and the rest of the 3 remaining I have finally switched to add +Vit/agi/fate legacies.  They're huge bonuses too, and easy to come by (bartered in moria/mirkwood)."
lotro,2yfle7,dead3ye,3,Mon Mar 9 17:12:59 2015 UTC,"easy to come by (bartered in moria/mirkwood)   I didn't know that.  Where are they?  Lately I have always just got those legacies using shards from the melding list, because I craft all my crafted relics, and they turn into a huge number of shards.  But if the full-strength legacies can be bartered in low level areas, that's even better."
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,2,Mon Mar 9 21:00:16 2015 UTC,"Yep!  They use the little moria medallions and mirkwood equivalent.  Chances are that you'll have fewer mirkwood ones, I'm guessing; i forget where that specific vendor is.  In moria, the dude is in the 21st hall in the same little square as the ale dude and the burg/hunter class trainers."

I'm not sure where the titles are, but there are only two places with higher level vendors, so it's not far to look.  Thanks for the tip :)"
lotro,2yfle7,exploderator,2,Tue Mar 10 00:05:30 2015 UTC,"In Moria, the vendor only has the lesser stat legacies for lower levels, traded for some kind of Moria tokens.  In Mirkwood, the vendor has full stat legacies, is in Ost Galadh, called Deagoth, Barter Exchange Trader.  The legacies cost 250 medallions.  (in the room with a table, a square pond, and about 7 traders)  Those stat legacies are not available in skirm camps that I could see, but seeing as they are traded for medallions, it makes me wonder where else they might be available."

lotro,2yeka8,Thurendeil,7,Mon Mar 9 03:11:23 2015 UTC,"That is about exactly right.  There haven't been any new genuine 12 person raids since Isengard. There have been some new instances and skirms, and the epic battles at Helm's Deep, and some of the old raids have been made into scaling content so they reward at whatever level is chosen.  But raids are officially history according to Turbine, there aren't enough players to bother making new ones, apparently.  And a claim many find ridiculous by Sapience (the prior official Turbine forums / community manager) that raiders were only ever less than 10%, so who gives a shit?  A lot of us didn't buy that, and a lot of us thought that was a self fulfilling prophecy."
lotro,2yeka8,exploderator,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:10:24 2015 UTC,"that's definitely bullshit on his part. I remember in the days of SoA there were constant spams for raid groups, even on-wards into mirkwood. I feel the same way as you about it being a self-fulfilling prophecy."
lotro,2yeka8,exploderator,2,Mon Mar 9 16:01:21 2015 UTC,"Even Isengard was busy as hell.  Maybe Draighoch lost some people for the bugs, I don't know, but I very distinctly watched the populations plummet on my server after Isengard wore out, the raiders went away and never came back, including huge raid kins that essentially faded away.  I was leveling up slowly and basically about 2 or 3 months behind the release of RoI.  The F2P wave had faded, losing the people who weren't in it for the long haul, but the game kept picking up lots of new players, and the big core groups were still all in place, and Rohan lost them.  There was a brief slight resurgence in Rohan when they released instances, and that was kind of the last gasp from what I can tell, so many players never came back."
lotro,2yeka8,notwhoithink,1 point,Mon Mar 9 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"Great, but how long ago was SoM? I could see a lot of things changing in that time..."
lotro,2yeka8,7h3C47,4,Tue Mar 10 16:48:42 2015 UTC,"It kind of depends on how you look at it.  The LSS is that there are still options for grouped content, they are just not new.  Meaning, with the exception of one new big battle, they are the same options just with updated loot as a reward.  If you always liked the old group stuff, then it's more of the same.  If not, you'll likely be disappointed.  More specifically: At the cap, the most often run group instances in terms of sheer volume would be 6-man big battles (Pelargir taking the cake for number one most visible in /wd), and then classic (old) instances like Sammy where people will run them repeatedly, many times in a row.  Regarding BBs, people are running these mainly to get gold jewelry and supreme essences; whereas the classic instances, it's more about marks/meds, and the occasional starlit crystal or teal armor if you haven't already filled out your DA barter armor sets or essence gear.    Regarding groups larger than 6, skirmish raids are basically a waste of time.  Then you have PUG classic raids--again, nothing new has been added here so we're still talking OD and BG.  These are offering first age symbols, starlit crystals--typical raid gear.  The last type of group content, 6 or larger, would be roving threats.  These are essentially single targets spread throughout the landscape with morale that ranges between 700k and 1.2(ish)million (iirc).  These aren't linked to an instance, and are just chilling throughout the landscape.  I've seen wardens solo them, but to make your use of time effectively, they're really designed to be tackled with a group--tank and spank style.  What doing these has to offer would be first age weapons (not symbols), and a teal essence pocket.  There's some housing stuff to barter for as well."

lotro,2yeka8,fadhero,1 point,Mon Mar 16 13:04:03 2015 UTC,"In addition to the other comments, Roving Threats are the newest type of raid-type content. They are not as involved as classic raids, but often generate large groups as they seek to hit all the RTs in a region. RTs are a bit simplistic, most that I have seen are not as difficult or complex than other raid bosses, but it is out there and generating some interest.  The other type of raid-ish content that could be out there is a new PvMP area. The last talk was that Osgiliath when released would have a new PvMP area. I just started getting into PvMP, and at lower ranks, it is most beneficial to have a group. I don't know if it will have a dungeon like the Delving of Fror, but it is something new."
lotro,2yeka8,Tywien,2,Mon Mar 9 17:29:27 2015 UTC,Every single RT can easily be done by 3 persons without even a healer and a decicated tank .. calling them Raid content is absurd.
lotro,2yeka8,fadhero,1 point,Tue Mar 10 00:01:33 2015 UTC,"I didn't say it was any good, but I do see 12 man groups forming and taking them out, which is about as close as it gets to raid content anymore in terms of group size."
lotro,2yeka8,SirIBON,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"At least it forms a group together.  The most Time you need to have all at the same Place. The killing is quiet fast. You can barter a first age Weapon (only) that is Character bound. This is has an other Skin. I think the 2 Handed Axe looks better. But this depends on taste. Alternative you can barter Housingitems or a Frog Pet.  Killing each once in each area (Misty Mountains, Angmar, Forochel and Dol Amroth) gives you a BoD entry. Then in Addition gives a BoD for killing x in Sum."

At one point I even got to rez him while the 100 RK ran around in circles with the help of my speed boost.  It was pretty fun for me, getting to play a valuable role in bringing down something that would have been impossible for me alone.  Of course, I didn't get anything from it except the thrill and satisfaction."
lotro,2yeka8,Taeyana,1 point,Tue Mar 10 20:38:39 2015 UTC,Haven't been on much this year so hearing about RT is making me curious - are Roving Threats similar to Warbands? And what are the rewards for killing them?
lotro,2yeka8,fadhero,1 point,Tue Mar 10 03:58:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, though they actually ""rove"" less than war bands. They are much higher power than war bands and can be found on parts of Eriador and Gondor. They drop Gift-givers Brands that can be accumulated and exchanged for First Age legendary weapons."

lotro,2y6gz2,posterchild,8,Fri Mar 6 21:51:12 2015 UTC,I would just go all-in on the red line. You get great single target bleeds and the morale leeches are plenty enough to keep you alive against large groups of mobs.

lotro,2y6gz2,WelCZa,1 point,Thu Mar 12 06:52:11 2015 UTC,"Just quickly ran to the training dummy in DA, respecced, and did a little test. All of the following numbers were acquired using combat analysis.  The tier 1 (power attack>onslaught) bleed removal effect hit for 1,218 Beleriand Damage and crit for 2,447 Beleriand Damage.  The tier 2 (mighty blow>wall of steel) bleed removal effect hit for 1,561 Beleriand Damage (my weapon type) and crit for 3,156 Beleriand Damage.  Comparing these numbers directly to the bleeds they remove, one tick of power attack deals 1,257 Beleriand Damage, and one tick of Mighty Blow does 2,834 Beleriand Damage. Clearly the bleeds themselves do MUCH more damage than the removal effect.  Now to analyze the AOE bleeds themselves for a more direct usefulness comparison.  Each tick of Desolation hit for 3,962 Light Damage (which is mitigated less than Beleriand). Each tick of Surety of Death hit for 3,548 Light Damage. Each tick of Brink of Victory hit for 2,521 Light Damage.  As you can see, the Warden's prime component for all of it's damage is in its insanely powerful bleeds and dots, and consciously choosing to remove them for sub-par aoe damage is madness to me.

Hearten is a fantastic heal, even in red-line I rarely have to worry about dying. If things get tough then both yellow-line and blue line are great for soloing. DPS in bear form is monstrous with most landscape mobs dying in 2-3 Thrashes.... It's a great class and if you have the TP/cash, I'd give it a shot."
lotro,2y2qfu,jwit83,2,Fri Mar 6 07:21:04 2015 UTC,Beorning is fantastic for soloing.  I didn't die for the first time until lvl 38 while in red-line.  I switched to yellow to complete the solo instance I died in.  Yellow line basically makes you unkillable.  The self heal often will crit for equivalent to 75% of your morale pool.  DPS is obviously lower in yellow but you can outlast any mob.  A combo of red and blue will make it insanely easy to solo.

But apparently the game was hemorrhaging subscribers in a big way before F2P. Regardless of what you think of the game's direction over the last few years, it seems to me that it was still preferable to turning the lights off, which was the only realistic alternative."
lotro,2xxqz1,tobascodagama,14,Wed Mar 4 20:30:10 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why is there so much f2p bashing. As a rule, I never enter subscription games. After going f2p they got about $100 from me in different purchases over the course of two years. I'd say there are many like me."
lotro,2xxqz1,elrohir_ancalin,7,Thu Mar 5 09:24:01 2015 UTC,Not sure if the people are really hating on f2p. It is more like remembering the good old times when lotro was doing well. Also keep in mind that generally in MMOs some groups of the player base are more vocal than others.
lotro,2xxqz1,Walting,2,Thu Mar 5 11:01:20 2015 UTC,"I agree, there is quite a bit of nostalgia there. I can be OK if people who pay more get their voices heard first, as long as they don't use these voices to bash on the other players. But what really bothers me specifically is the raging OMG F2P=P2W YOU FILTHY CHEATERS nonsense.   I understand certain gamer types often make quite irreflexive comments. And it is a fact that some f2p games have abused the system ridicullously (and succeeded to the disgrace of the entire genre). But I consider myself living proof that a reasonable, well thought out f2p system can bring me games of quality and get devs paid at the same time."
lotro,2xxqz1,elrohir_ancalin,5,Thu Mar 5 11:49:22 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately lotro store was set such way that it offered advantages not available in game, plus many new grinds were introduced in the game and at the same time rewards for those grinds introduced in store."
lotro,2xxqz1,Nolfator,2,Thu Mar 5 11:57:00 2015 UTC,"Can you clarify? Maybe we have a different definition of an advantage, for me exp and travel accelerators are just convenience plus services. Do you think otherwise, or is it that there was a time where people could buy sets in store?"
lotro,2xxqz1,elrohir_ancalin,3,Thu Mar 5 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"Stat tomes, in theory available in game , in practice it would take years of every day grinding to get them.   Special morale and power pots, not available in game, on extra cooldown.   Special attack, defense, resistance, morale, regeneration etc perk buffs that stack with ingame buffs.   Special debuff removal potions, able to remove multiple debuffs at once.   And that is just special stuff, there was also ton of items that cut time required for certain ingame rewards in very drastic way.   Example, virtues. When you saw someone with rank 9 virtues across the board, you knew it was dedicated player. It took weeks to get them. With store, you have them in couple of minutes.   Everything they did with LI was pure cashgrab. They even removed the option to get relics back, and put item that removes then in store!!!   Same with cosmetics, when you saw someone with rare or special outfit, you knew he she earned it. Later they sold in store cosmetics not available in game.   And many many more, I wonder what else since I left.   I have played for about 4 years, pvmp, solo, raids, pve, events, kin leading, helping new players, collecting cosmetics, writing guides etc.   But once f2p hit it took couple of months to make me leave. I was just disgusted by the store and how every new feature added into game was intentionally made too grindy so store would be the best choice."
lotro,2xxqz1,Nolfator,3,Thu Mar 5 15:34:33 2015 UTC,"I kind of see your point, I really do. Before, everyone with good equip would have earned it, so you look at the store and how much stuff can be purchased, and you assume everyone is going to buy that, and it was a disgusting perspective.  But I am not sure that your gut was right on that. A typical freemium developer mantra is ""one to twenty"", meaning that whatever you do, whatever you sell, only 5% of the users will pay the premium tier at best. I got in much later, about half a year after f2p started, and I never saw anyone purchase any of those from store. Really. No one.   I get the impression you see lotro today as some kind of P2W bizarre monstrosity, and in my experience it is not. Yes, the many things that you describe are available in the store, but the effective number of players who purchase them on a regular basis is ridicullously small. And many times zero equals zero.  And funny enough, we the f2ps save our precious points for expansions. If anybody, it is the VIPs and their ""man I have so many TP I can't even spend them from one month to the next"" who purchase those things."
lotro,2xxqz1,elrohir_ancalin,3,Thu Mar 5 16:12:23 2015 UTC,"""P2W bizarre monstrosity""  Not really.  I see it as a game that provided really great and unique experience if you are into lotr universe and mmorpgs.  The community was just fantastic.  I see it as a game that thanks to huge incompetence of developers shrunk its playerbase to minimum.   If f2p was move to make the game better, well it did not work."
lotro,2xxqz1,Nolfator,4,Thu Mar 5 16:31:33 2015 UTC,"If f2p was move to make the game better, well it did not work.   Sorry I was reading your comments as if you said that f2p per-se actually made the game worse. Which is going further than saying it did not make it better. That was the whole point of my first comment. The game has lots of poorly implemented features, some specially flagrant as they are poor constructions of great conceptual ideas. I agree f2p did not ""make it better"". My comments were intended to those who see f2p somehow as the root cause of the problems. For me it is more like one of the potentially good ideas that should have been done better."
lotro,2xxqz1,elrohir_ancalin,6,Thu Mar 5 17:29:21 2015 UTC,"I probably never would have gotten into LOTRO if it haden't been F2P. Honestly, trying to compete with WoW at WoWs price is nearly impossible. They're very good at the genre despite what some people will say, even now. Only MMO I can think of to really get so popular is Runescape when it was like $5 a month.  F2P works well for LOTRO though. People getting into the game always complain about the prices of expansions, but they're honestly right in line with, or lower than a WoW subscription."
lotro,2xxqz1,DarnLemons,2,Sat Mar 7 02:18:24 2015 UTC,"Wrath of the Lich King was a fatal body blow. It sucked up all the oxygen, and Mines of Moria -- despite the lore -- just couldn't get any traction.  At the time, I alternated between WoW due to the size of community and the raiding/pvp scene, and LOTRO for the more mature storyline and intricate questing and crafting.   MoM might have fared better, if it had been released a year later...but LOTRO needed new content to hold the eyeballs they had.  Stuck between a rock and a hard place."
lotro,2xxqz1,dbcanuck,21,Fri Mar 13 13:24:41 2015 UTC,"The most interesting comment in the article:   At its height, the Moors saw maybe 7% participation...as for those of us who were diehards, we're talking just a few percent of the LOTRO population. It was hard for me to accept the SQL metrics (I lived and breathed the place on and off the clock) but it was what it was.   For all the bitching about how many PvMP players are out there and how they think they're a huge chunk of the playerbase, this really drives it home."
lotro,2xxqz1,notwhoithink,11,Wed Mar 4 19:42:33 2015 UTC,"I remember people all but accused Sapience of lying when he would talk about how small the PvMP population is. Good times, good times."

As long as they can continue to make some amount of money they will keep it running.  If UO is still making enough money to be around after 18 years, I see no reason why LoTRO couldn't do the same.  Especially if they can get some economic benefit from shrinking the number of servers.  Still, if the plan is to no longer have expansions and they're pushing to Osgiliath this year, I have to wonder if the plan isn't a sudden rush to Minas Tirith and the Black Gate before they have to shut it down?"

I think they renew next in 2017, or maybe not, who knows."

lotro,2xxqz1,MagnifyingLens,6,Thu Mar 5 07:35:04 2015 UTC,I find it interesting that an experienced company such as Warner Bros. didn't recognize the huge potential of the game.

I imagine they keep the bills paid, keep a skeleton crew, but there's no way the big investment money will ever flow again.

lotro,2xxqz1,exploderator,7,Wed Mar 4 19:30:40 2015 UTC,"It's not about ""secret"", it's about realism and confirmation, which is something Turbine has been mostly awful about over the years.  Here's a quote I very much appreciated hearing:   And there's a very strong culture of secrecy there that becomes ingrained, especially amongst the rank and file. Forget that you're making video games that are often as not derivative rehashes of twenty other games; this is serious business! And forget that a year from now your game will probably be pushing up daisies in the GameStop budget bin anyway.  This same culture extends to marketing and community relations: never tell the truth, never admit a mistake, silence criticism, contort the facts even if it means blatantly insulting the intelligence of your customers.   I know that seems negative, and I'm sorry to have picked that one quote ahead of the pages of positive stuff Aylwen said, but dammit, that was good to hear from an insider.  It shows something of his realism, which is thick all the way through his posts.  He's a good guy who loves the game, and knows it from the inside, and it's nice to hear it told straight."

lotro,2xxqz1,Ambassador_Buta,7,Wed Mar 4 20:41:33 2015 UTC,"What are you even taking about?  You don't ""Save face"" by hemorrhaging money for 6 years. You maintain a product."
lotro,2xxqz1,Soylent_Hero,-2,Wed Mar 4 21:02:22 2015 UTC,"You maintain a product.   Here's one of the many examples of how you maintain a product, by the former employee himself:   Mersky in marketing was constantly sending out company wide emails highlighting the latest nice things Ten Ton Hammer had to say about us, this online award or that...even as we, the QA and Devs, knew very well we weren't putting out the best product we could have been.   This is just inter-company, Aylwyn posted a lot of eye-opening community interactions that explained just exactly why Turbine was so unwilling to do something."
lotro,2xxqz1,Ambassador_Buta,7,Wed Mar 4 21:08:31 2015 UTC,"That's great but my point is, they aren't operating at a loss to ""save face"". That's not how you operate a business.  If they are in operation is because they are still making money."
lotro,2xxqz1,MagnifyingLens,-1,Wed Mar 4 22:40:46 2015 UTC,"That's great but my point was that Turbine's ineptitude over the past couple of years peaked after being bought out by WB and going F2P. There's simply no creativity left there because they're all being laid off since many expansions ago. And even then when they had the team all their ideas were being stifled by a lack of resources.  As the former employee stated that WB was looking into shutting this game down many times, I'm pretty sure that the second LotrO stops making money it's gone. I'm also pretty sure that 100 million mark in 2013 was implausible (as speculated by the former employee as well).  85,000 subs at 2010. How much is the gap from that, at 15$ per player, to 100 million? I highly doubt that this game got more populated since then. I'm also pretty sure a lot of the income WB gets off of LotrO is supplemented by maintaining a skeleton crew for three mmos.  All that I could derive from this former employee was that Lotro's days are coming to an end. I'm very glad that I bought a lifetime sub and got my money's worth a long time ago."
lotro,2xxqz1,torayx,8,Wed Mar 4 23:32:07 2015 UTC,"The $100M 2013 figure cited from SuperData has always been comical.  Turbine trumpeted their revenue numbers shortly after the f2p conversion, but has been silent on revenue ever since.  If LotRO had actually brought in anywhere near $100M there would have been a wall of press releases instead of three rounds of layoffs."

lotro,2xy5fl,RyanRomanov,1 point,Thu Mar 5 14:47:30 2015 UTC,I play on Gladden and I still solo exclusively. The main reason I don't play on a less populated server is for the chat (I enjoy the inanity of it). But I don't craft or join kins or anything of the sort. Just the quests. It's relaxing. Like I'm exploring the world of Middle Earth as an actual ranger would. Nice to know there are others out there like me.
lotro,2xy5fl,catalyst4evr,2,Thu Mar 5 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry for the tangent...  But is Gladden really that populated? 😩 I've been questing at the upper mid range areas (mainly Wildermore and West Rohan) and its getting increasingly harder to find people in those areas who I can join temporary fellowships with.   I've often thought that it could be just that no one is on when I go on... But I don't think that's the case... It could also be that I just need to join a guild, but I don't know about that...  I don't mind soloing and exploring out on my own, in fact I do prefer it sometimes. But I would also like to run a raid or take on some of the high level monsters around Rohan with people I see on the road."
lotro,2xy5fl,RyanRomanov,3,Thu Mar 5 06:11:20 2015 UTC,"No problem, tangents are my second favorite trig function.   I think Gladden is decently populated in Eriador, but once you go to Eregion and beyond it seems to steadily decline in population. Perhaps newcomers join Gladden by default and most of them leave in a short while, so that the server almost stays constantly populated in Bree-land, &c. but is mostly empty everywhere else. I'm in the Trollshaws right now and I see less and less people as I move East.   I have hesitations about joining guilds/kins as well, so you're not the only one. And I know exactly what you mean about finding people for raids. Have you tried any other servers?"
lotro,2xy5fl,chensley,3,Thu Mar 5 06:27:47 2015 UTC,"Fellow gladden player here (Council of Gladden) and there's a decent amount of people in the starter areas, but it is true that as soon as you go into higher level areas you don't see ANYONE.  At least in my own experience"
lotro,2xy5fl,RyanRomanov,2,Thu Mar 5 19:42:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it really makes me wonder what happens to them. Is Gladden populated by mostly those who just try the game?"
lotro,2xy5fl,chensley,3,Thu Mar 5 21:39:30 2015 UTC,I'm not really sure. We do seem to have a really low retention rate. Either that or EVERYONE is in Bree. But I went through Angmar and Enedwaith and Moria with barely anyone around. Feel the same way with Mirkwood at the moment.
lotro,2xy5fl,Arathaert,2,Thu Mar 5 21:53:54 2015 UTC,"Gladden was a small server for several years, then became the recommend server. So now we have a lot of folks, but most of which are lower levels or cap... not oodles in between. The population is good again when you get to the level-cap areas: In Dol Amroth there's always lots of folks. :)"
lotro,2xy5fl,catalyst4evr,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:36:18 2015 UTC,"Well, that's true :)  I've been using my mithril coins to jump ahead and see how many people are in Dol Amroth.   But I wonder if there aren't that many players in the middle level areas isn't just a symptom of a game that's been going on as long as LOTRO. I mean, sure you have the flow of people joining and leaving the game, only to come flooding back when new updates and content are released. But in Gladden, it seems there's a combination of players that just started, and players who are active in the areas that just got released within the past 6 months or so.  For any game, especially LOTRO, it's easy to get people hooked or make them come back, but when you have the 60-65 levels in between content like the Lone Lands and Dol Amroth, it's hard to keep people constantly engaged with content that seems to repeat itself sometimes...  TLDR: I agree with what has been said about there only seems to be players in the low and high level areas. But I wonder if the low retention isn't just due to the length, time, and commitment it takes to play LOTRO."
lotro,2xy5fl,catalyst4evr,2,Fri Mar 6 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"I've tried Arkenstone and... I think Laurelin? Dwarrowdelf? Silverlode? one of them... But I only played up to level 30 or so, though it still seemed pretty busy.  Yes, the Northern Trollshaws were hard for me... not really many people there.  I was surprised that Angmar was practically empty, especially since there's a lot of group/fellowship quests in the area. Maybe it's because people are choosing to skip it and not pay the purchase the quest pack though...  The only mid level areas that I found a lot of people questing in were Annuminas (the city, not really the area surrounding it) and Moria (mostly in the Great Delving, Durin's Way (Chamber of the Crossroads), the Redhorn Lodes (near the Grodbog stuff), Silvertine Lodes, and Zelem Melek (near the 21st Hall). The rest of Moria was surprisingly empty, especially the Foundations of Stone."
lotro,2xy5fl,RyanRomanov,2,Fri Mar 6 21:44:46 2015 UTC,"So it looks like it's not restricted toGladden. It almost feels like Lotro lacks the ability to hold onto users. That sucks that Angmar was empty. When I played 4 years ago, it was full of people. But now it's empty. The price of the packs are really high for what you get though, yeah. It's a limiting factor for where I go with my characters.   EDIT it's"

lotro,2xuld5,reddownthere,7,Wed Mar 4 15:55:03 2015 UTC,"I find Warden to be most fun, not just because of the 1-man-army-ness (taking on 3-man quest/instances solo), but also because of the free no-cooldown teleport skill similar to the hunter's (has less teleports than hunter) which will allow you to zip all over middle earth no matter where you are, making questing way easier.  For the other classes, you usually need to earn Kindred level with a faction to gain a major area's town teleport, by which time you'll have probably finished or outlevelled the entire area of most quests, making the teleport a bit useless.  Captains are very popular and always welcome during endgame raids in groups due to the ability to buff groups + in-combat resurrection."

lotro,2xuld5,WelCZa,3,Thu Mar 5 14:03:15 2015 UTC,"Funny I actually was in this same predicament a few weeks ago. The only three characters I have are a Warden, Captain, and Beorning. None of them are at max so I've spent the last few weeks playing around with each trying to figure out their strengths/weaknesses and overall play style feel. Here are my general impressions:   Beorning: I'm only level 40, but man do I love this class. The aesthetics/feel of the class is great, I mean you are a honey-cake making, club swinging, bee-hive throwing, bear man. What's not to love? At first I thought the combat would get a little dry since we really only have 4 melee abilities in man form (and they aren't flashy by any means). But there is just enough diversity to make gameplay interesting with the ability to pop in and out of bear form for maximum damage. I usually start my fights out by spreading all of my bleeds with Slash and Biting Edge, if it's going to be a tough fight I'll also pop ferocious roar and hearten before jumping into bear form. Any non-signature mob so far is dead with in a few thrashes in bear form, the DPS is real. I also am a huge fan of executes and you have one as a Beorning. With the ability to heal, tank and DPS you are a pure-hybrid. The wrath system is also a breath of fresh air as I'm not a huge fan of Power. As long as you keep the heals rolling you are unstoppable and can move through groups of mobs really quickly. The combat feels quicker and more fluid than the other classes I've played (possible because it's the newest class?). At any rate, I am really enjoying the Beorning, although I can't speak for its end-game viability.  Captain: My first toon, the toon I thought I would make my main. All around a great class, love the lore and feel of the Captain. Heralds are an interesting take on a typical pet-class, you really are a leader of men (which is very present in how valuable they are in Fellowships). You are also another true hybrid with the ability to tank, heal, and DPS. I haven't tried much of the tanking line, but blue line heals is a ton of fun to play. I've always been a fan of healing in the thick of things--which Captains excel at. Halberds are also the coolest weapon in-game (which are Captain exclusive). Killing things can be a bit slow, even in red-line, but I've found that the Archer herald can demolish things if you give him the treated 40% damage. All around, as others have said, Captains are a great class, you wouldn't be wrong in picking them. Overall though I personally have found the combat to be a bit too slow for my liking as I'm not a fan of the defeat-events and battle-ready states.  Warden: Another great, well developed, and aesthetically pleasing class. You have spears and javelins? Awesome. The gambit system is one of the most original class ideas I've come across and props to Turbine for making it work out as well as it does. With that said, I have the same reservations to playing the Warden as I do Eve Online... If I wanted to look at spreadsheets and memorize charts, I would prefer to master a second language. Just my honest opinion. Others have a much easier time with the Warden but I sit there staring at my gambit panel trying to figure out what I should press next before I realize my health is quickly disappearing. But with that said, it is a fantastic class that is capable of incredible solo-feats. If you prefer a challenge and want a class that has a very high skill-ceiling then roll a Warden.    Hope this helps!"

lotro,2xuld5,MilesChristiSum,2,Wed Mar 4 15:32:09 2015 UTC,"Well I am just getting back into the game after a 2 year break, I am a Captain main. I have not played the current expansion but I have always been lead to believe that Captains are one of the most essential classes to have in a raid (this has been true since the launch of the game). Captains are also pretty easy to solo level with as they have self healing and can deal a lot of damage, depending on how you trait them."
lotro,2xuld5,Thurendeil,1 point,Wed Mar 4 01:30:52 2015 UTC,coming on 8 yrs and i only play a Captain.  every raid/instance needs or benefits-from a capn.  cant way the same for the other two.
lotro,2xuld5,SapienChavez,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:58:08 2015 UTC,"I don't know much about Beorning yet, but I'll pitch in two copper for Captain and Warden:  I love running a blue line captain. Heals can be insane, giving buffs is fun, and all around it is a really enjoyable experience. I have dipped into red from time to time to try dpsing, and it isn't bad. I have heard of some successful yellow line tanks, but haven't tried it myself. Bottom line, pick it if you like doing group content almost exclusively or are really into support classes.  Warden is hands down the best solo class. You strive to gather insane numbers of mobs around you and just leach them to death. The feeling of accomplishment from doing well as a warden is hard to beat. Add tons of porting skills, great tank survivability and decent dps, you have a great end-game toon. Bottom line, pick it if you want to feel like a demi-god and enjoy tanking and soloing more than support."
lotro,2xuld5,Kants_Pupil,1 point,Wed Mar 4 19:27:42 2015 UTC,Thanks very much for all the replies! Will be sticking to my Captain and Warden (for now) by the sounds of it. Will get them both to 40 then make my decision.   Cheers again for all the advice!
lotro,2xuld5,DarnLemons,1 point,Fri Mar 6 18:59:15 2015 UTC,"I love the internal RP of Captian. Its just so cool to me, the big two handed weapons, the yelling things to death, the helpful party benefits, Its a role I enjoy. (Though the male kid-like yelling doesn't really fit in when you try and make a grizzled war captain)  However, I think Warden is technically ""Better"" for soloing content, and Warden has more depth in its skills and using them.  Beorning's I can't say I have much any experience in, something about playing a Beorn just doesn't fit in for me."

Feels more lonesome out there, but the artic can be pretty nice scenary if you like the ice.  40-50 is just a scrappy place to be for f2p (I only paid money for quad pack, grinded rest.)

lotro,2xt8t6,FrancoBlanco,5,Tue Mar 3 18:25:48 2015 UTC,"The Champion - All about that DPS. Since it is largely a hack-and-slash class, the best way I have found to spice things up is 1) learn all three trait trees and 2) Push yourself to harder content.    Trait Trees - the basic overview   Blue - Tank - self-healing and protection skills, lowest DPS of the three Red - Single target DPS - Balance between durability and DPS Yellow - AoE DPS - best for DPS, but squishiest of the three   With a good command of the skills and a good build, on-level content will be simple. My Champ (currently lvl 82) has no trouble dealing with level 85-86 mobs on Yellow line. I only use blue line when serving as a tank in fellowship instances or raids, and with guards, wardens, and captains also able to serve as tanks, I don't often serve as tank. Red line is usually only for parts of instances where using AoE DPS is counter-productive (for example, Grand Stair daily challenge) or solo instances where there are fewer mobs and a greater need for durability."
lotro,2xt8t6,fadhero,5,Tue Mar 3 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"Well if you continue playing RK you will be expected to be competent at healing groups unless there are lots of RKs or Minstrels in your group. If you suck at healing, get better at it, or don't play RK. I'm not  a huge fan of RK Damage Dealers since they feel too much like Discount Minstrels to me.  Champions are probably the stronger solo class due to being generally more durable and able to do impressive amounts of AoE and actually tank those mobs without too much of an issue. They feel pretty clunky before they get their Attack Speed up because of their skill lag though."
lotro,2xt8t6,Darchseraph,3,Tue Mar 3 18:56:29 2015 UTC,"I play RK and very clearly tell people I don't heal. As long as your honest up front, most people don't care. If they do care, you lucked out not grouping with those jerks."
lotro,2xt8t6,byzantinebobby,2,Tue Mar 3 20:46:59 2015 UTC,At what point do I get more Attack Speed for my Champion? The delay or skill lag is one of the reasons he feels clunky.
lotro,2xt8t6,fadhero,3,Tue Mar 3 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"Once your Champ picks up more skills you will have more attacks available and your attack speed will improve. You will automatically unlock a new class skill every few levels until lvl 50. You gain additional skills through the trait lines by gaining trait points (Yellow line Raging Blades and Fury of Blades are great AoE attacks). Red trait line will always have a bit of a skill lag, but if you stack fervour and hit the big attacks (Brutal Strikes and Ferocious Strikes), it really shouldn't matter. It has its advantages too, as it is less tiring than the quicker but weaker melee attacks of the guardian."
lotro,2xt8t6,Kants_Pupil,2,Tue Mar 3 21:23:49 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Champion isn't doing it for you, you shouldn't struggle with it until yo get to higher levels just to see if it gets better. I love my champion, it does monstrous levels of damage with the yellow traits, but I also love other classes. Play to your strengths and pursue what you like and are having fun with. It may be worth it to start another rune keeper or try out the Minstrel class. Minstrels do a ton of damage at low levels and heal quite a bit differently than the Rune-Keeper, so you might hit a better groove healing there too. If you wanted to try another class that has a lot of heal over times, you might look into Captain as well. They dps can be painfully low, especially at lower levels, but they are capable of really cool support and heals too!"
lotro,2xt8t6,Whitesymphonia,2,Wed Mar 4 19:40:29 2015 UTC,"I run rune keeper hybrid red blue. I can deal lots of damage, much more than my mini due to DOTs, and heal semi decently. If it's hard content, then I'd run blue, but most content you can get away with red blue hybrid, so you can still deal lots of damage.   Of course you still need to be able to heal well so you might need to practice at healing first.  Also, you won't get enough points to double dip till much later, so you can't do hybrid till later.  RK can be decent in solo play if you pick LIs carefully for your self heal in red line. But champions are much better due to tankiness while still having good DPS.  Go champion if you're not willing to learn how to heal."
lotro,2xt8t6,notwhoithink,2,Tue Mar 3 19:42:00 2015 UTC,"Go champion if you're not willing to learn how to heal.    Bullshit.  Play the class that you enjoy and play it how you like to play it.  If someone else has an issue with how you play then screw them, it's their problem.  So long as you are clear when joining a group that you are not joining as a healer then you're fine.  If someone has a problem with that (and judging by this thread a few posters here do) then you don't need their frustration in your game."
lotro,2xt8t6,notwhoithink,2,Tue Mar 3 21:06:49 2015 UTC,"Also, my champion feels kind of boring at the moment, because I expected him to deal very high dps and I don't really feel the difference between him and my Runkeeper. Does that change with higher level?    The Champion's strength is in AoE/multi-target DPS.  You can wade into a group of 3-5 mobs on level and mow them down quicker than just about anyone.  You will not see huge single-target DPS numbers, and going one-on-one with a mob they seem a bit unimpressive.  But load them up with heavy armor, dual weilding and they'll mow through groups very nicely.   Additionally, I really miss being able to heal and deal damage at the same time. In general, the Runekeeper felt better in solo-play.   IMO the Rune-Keeper used to be more fun before the skills revamp.  It used to be a general-purpose DPS/healer depending on which way they were attuned at the moment.  Nowdays with skill trees, you tend to focus more on DPS or healing with a particular trait line, but not really both.  If you trait for DPS you still have some heals that you can use on yourself or group mates, but you are generally much less effective as a healer than they were under the old system when all you had to do was hit Steady Hands to go neutral and then spam heals to shift attunement to green.   The only problem is, that I suck at healing for a group.  But from what I have heard, people want you, as a Runekeeper, to focus on healing and not as a damage dealer, helping with healing whenever needed.   You are what you choose to be.  If you want to group and play a DPS Rune-Keeper then you certainly can do so.  If a group picks you up just make it clear that you're traited for DPS and that you do not normally play a healer, and that you are not good at it.  If they don't like it then too bad.  Just be sure that you are responding to requests for DPS for a group, not for a healer.  As long as you set the expectations then you should be OK."

You can easily use an attunement dump then start healing as red/yellow line. If you spec a little into blue for some heals/bonuses, you can become very versatile. Especially as Red/blue, leaning whichever way you need. You can get good DoT while healing.  Even solo, Epic for the Ages after the instant cast heal/HoT (can't think of name), then bubble is a really good rotation at low health"
lotro,2xq01m,Mrbobby90,4,Mon Mar 2 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"They are very unique sets from a cosmetic perspective, and a favorite of mine for elves (the Medium, and Light sets in particular).  Stats-wise, I am sure they are eclipsed at some point, but I would guess that it wouldn't be for a while (85 or so)."
lotro,2xq01m,TheWanderingSuperman,3,Tue Mar 3 01:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'll second this...in that I imagine the main stats on the armor are probably comparable to purple 85 armor. Vit/might/agi/fate/will etc. I mean. The noticeable difference will be armor value, which some people put more stock into than others. [I.e. depends on whether being able to survive getting hit is of greater importance to your play style/class than is your ability to quickly kill something before it can hit you period, or to a lesser extent the acceptable threshold of how many times you anticipate it hitting you before you anticipate being able to kill it]"
lotro,2xq01m,7h3C47,3,Tue Mar 3 14:15:36 2015 UTC,"The set is actually better than the level 85 Barad Guldur armor set, from the classic vendor, in some ways!"
lotro,2xq01m,Daddyloveshunt,4,Wed Mar 4 06:23:18 2015 UTC,"For end game no. For comsmetics, hells yeah! These were some of the best armor sets the game has produced"
lotro,2xq01m,exploderator,4,Tue Mar 3 01:33:09 2015 UTC,"Unless you use the pocket item to disable experience and freeze yourself forever more at level 75, you will fast out level 75, and only the cosmetic value will be relevant.  You won't actually be able to earn those sets before you level way past them.  You might have missed them, but there were also really awesome sets at level 65, back in Lothlorien and Mirkwood, if you did enough raids to get the right tokens.  But all those become largely irrelevant now, unless you're in some miracle kinship on a super high population server, where you actually pause to spend time at those levels.  The bottom line is that aside from cosmetics, all the hard to get stuff below current level cap (100), is basically now garbage left over from past times when those lower levels were the level cap for a few months, and people would do the hard grind to earn the best stuff at the time.  I wish Turbine would make that stuff more easily available now, so that it would be feasible for us to earn before it was so far below our level that it's just garbage.  So much great stuff is now lost because of this.  And right now, you're drooling over level 75 stuff, but eventually you will get the expansions, and be wishing you could get the level 85 Hytbold stuff, which again you would level past long before you could earn the tokens to buy it.  Sorry if this is discouraging."

It was hundreds of seals originally, and I was lucky that I was so late getting the seals, that I held off buying the armour and kept the seals instead, and then they converted seals to medallions at a really high rate.  I now have about 25000 meds, making that armour extremely cheap :)"
lotro,2xocrt,jwit83,5,Mon Mar 2 15:39:55 2015 UTC,"I have had two or three great experiences raiding warbands with my kin. So, not always.  But most of the solo time, yeah, it is pretty dull. Moving around too big an area increases chances of getting a bad lag spike, or whatever it is, and there aren't that many skills to activate to make the combat interesting.  Landing hits should be reasonably easy because mounted attacks are queued. You select a skill before approaching an enemy, charge at it, and the toon uses it when it becomes in range. That's what the tutorial says in theory, but I only have a Huner and have never tried melee mounted combat."
lotro,2xocrt,elrohir_ancalin,3,Mon Mar 2 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"That is indeed how mounted combat works for melee. The way attack queuing works for MC is actually quite nice, and I sometimes find myself wishing it could be backported to unmounted combat."
lotro,2xocrt,tobascodagama,2,Mon Mar 2 21:47:02 2015 UTC,You should be able to queue skills unmounted combat. I have always been able to since I started playing
lotro,2xocrt,Louey7,2,Tue Mar 3 12:06:27 2015 UTC,"Unmounted skill queuing exists, but it's very different. You need to be in range of your target while using the skill for it to be queued.  Mounted combat lets you queue a skill while out of range and have it automatically fire off when you get in range. It's the only thing making melee mounted combat remotely feasible. While it's not as much of a significant feel issue in unmounted gameplay, there are places where it'd be nice to have the same mechanic while not on a horse. Epic Battles are a pretty significant example for me, since you're running around and switching targets so often."
lotro,2xocrt,tobascodagama,4,Tue Mar 3 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it's dependent on class to some degree. It's also very vulnerable to lag and latency, due, in part, to the prediction model they've shoehorned into the game engine. (Ok that was pure opinion, but hey ;) . It's a lot better than it was at launch, at least)  There are some tricks, though:  Apart from levelling agility (of the steed) which helps maneuverability, try experimenting with the various ways to move steed and camera. Perhaps it works better for you to guide the steed with keyboard while turning the camera with the mouse, or perhaps turn both with the camera, and ""look"" towards the target when hitting.  That's again highly dependent on class as well as player.  If you're a melee class (for mounted), you could also try using the /follow command on a target. Let the game guide your mount. There's also a standard mounted combat skill that turns you towards your target, but from my experience, it's a lot more effective to simply add /follow as a shortcut command (/shortcut [keyslot number] /follow).  Look for skills or skill effects that will force the target to ride next to you.  Queue your skills. You don't have to hit the skill, the moment it should be activated. Hit it well before and it will automatically activate when possible."
lotro,2xocrt,Cyrilion,3,Mon Mar 2 18:58:27 2015 UTC,"Regarding camera tricks: When confronting many enemies in an open plain, try hitting 'X' (toggle fix camera on objective). This combined with keyboard steering gives a rather decent tactical perspective and allows you to organize your navigation around mobs.  On the other hand, when in close quarters with a solo mounted mob, I keep moving to the ""front"" of the camera and steer using the mouse right button to move the camera around. This gives a more dogfight-esque perspective.   In fact I have played warthunder recently and I believe mounted combat in lotro should try to mirror flight simulators more (or at least import how they manage lag)."
lotro,2xocrt,elrohir_ancalin,2,Mon Mar 2 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"I usually use the X key to keep the camera on the target. Then I scroll way out and from above so I'm looking down on the combat. It's much easier to see the whole battlefield this way, and because everything is scrolled out it is fairly non-GPU intensive."
lotro,2xocrt,notwhoithink,5,Mon Mar 2 21:50:20 2015 UTC,"Zooming way out is the single most important point here.  I remember being absolutely baffled at very first, I couldn't keep track of anything, and was getting almost dizzy.  Several friends were complaining likewise.  Then I realized to zoom all the way out and look down, and I spread it around, and it fixed all of our worst problems.  I've since been able to fight mounted when zoomed farther in, but it's still a little dizzy making."
lotro,2xocrt,exploderator,14,Mon Mar 2 22:51:07 2015 UTC,"I have a hunter and mounted combat is a joke.  I run in circles and shoot.  Every shot lands.

I'm at cappy now and deeding in Rohan. I wouldn't think of using my mount.  Edit: words, man. Words."
lotro,2xocrt,Crash665,2,Mon Mar 2 15:55:18 2015 UTC,"That's not always the case. There are quite a few war bands with either ranged attacks or faster mounts that you just cannot solo as a hunter. And honestly, I think that MC is probably best on the ranged classes."
lotro,2xocrt,notwhoithink,1 point,Mon Mar 2 21:48:13 2015 UTC,I didn't mean to imply all of them are that way.  I've gotten my butt kicked more than once.
lotro,2xocrt,Crash665,4,Mon Mar 2 22:19:36 2015 UTC,"Depending on your class, it gets much better or stays kinda meh. I never got the feeling that mounted combat as a burglar was great, but after getting to about level 90-95 and having a decent bridle, champion and lore-master mounted combat got more fun. I never think, however, that I should go out and do some mounted combat, but it started to feel less tedious and boring around those points.   Also, your server's population load can really affect how smooth riding is, so if you are rubber banding and lagging like crazy, that will influence how much fun it is too. I remember my times on Brandywine where I could run faster than ride due to rubber banding, but on Crickhollow I haven't had many issues.  Edit: Fixed some words."
lotro,2xocrt,Kants_Pupil,4,Mon Mar 2 17:55:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely convinced it's about server population.  I'm on Imladris, which is one of the lowest population servers in the game, and rubber banding still just happens.  I think it is a byproduct of the following mechanic:  The client lets the horse run predictively slightly ahead of what the the server has actually acknowledged, in order to attempt to not be held back by lag.  But sometimes the server doesn't agree with what your client thought, so it forces you to rubber band back.  Another player in game would have seen you stop, never moving ahead of where you rubber banded back to, it's only your client's prediction that was too far ahead.  So lets say you run along, and jump a fence, pressing space just a split second before the fence.  Your machine recognizes the move, jumps, and rides on.  Meanwhile, due to latency, the server doesn't get the jump signal from your computer, until too late, and your horse hits the fence.  The server decides the outcome, you didn't jump on time, you hit the fence, and the server is the absolute master.  The decision is final, and when it gets back to your machine a second or two later, your client must obey the decision.  Even though your own machine let you jump and run ahead, it now has to rewind you, because the server says you failed.  The constants here are lag, and the server needing to be the absolute master, in order to consistently tell everyone around what the official outcome was.  If LOTRO was a pure solo game, the server could let the client win, and you wouldn't have to rubber band back.  But the server has to decide quickly, and let everyone else know your motion, long before the lag allows it to tell your client that you didn't jump in time.  I don't know how much lag is affected by server load, but it is definitely affected by all kinds of other possible network congestion between your computer and the server, and we should also expect overall network congestion to coincide with server busy times in general, because there are busy times of day, and they impact everything.  There are a lot of hops involved, and even a half second lag here or there hurts bad."

lotro,2xocrt,majorlagg1,3,Mon Mar 2 21:55:09 2015 UTC,"Starting off, mounted combat is incredibly simplistic and a bit dull. As you level your steed, you get stronger to the point where you can two-hit on-level mobs and can take on very powerful mobs with relative ease. You get access to different skills that improve the mechanics of mounted combat.   Mounted combat is best used against mounted mobs. Against non-mounted mobs, you have to go in circles and just hit your attacks. Mounted melee attacks have a great enough range that you should be able to land attacks almost immediately if you are running tight circles while being able to avoid attacks from the mob. It gets tedious, but if you let your fury build, you should be able to defeat most mobs with only 2-3 attacks.    Edit: I suppose I should note that my main is a Champion, so I have some strong attacks. On a medium steed, I have sufficient speed and have traited a few healing skills so that my horse is very durable.   Also if they would allow mounted combat in all regions, I would be so happy."

lotro,2xocrt,tjb490,1 point,Wed Mar 4 16:37:43 2015 UTC,Some people like it.   I found the mounted combat quests to be boring and tedious on all 3 of my characters. But I had kind of assumed it would suck from the start.   Unfortunately the game forces you into it during the quest line  by putting other mounted enemies which are too fast to engage on foot.
lotro,2xocrt,DuneBug,-1,Tue Mar 3 01:00:08 2015 UTC,"I've never been able to get a feel for it. I did it with my LM which is arguably the easiest class to do MC with. And you are correct, it is ridiculous. It's all very forced. Like, ""We need new features for the next expansion. Well...they have horses."" shakes head Not to mention, the strain on system resorces. The words ""badly implemented"" come to mind everytime I have to reduce my graphical settings to low to avoid game-breaking lag and rubberbanding. Dear Turbine, I did not spend 1.5 grand building a gaming PC to play on low settings. Seriously, I adore LotRO and have very few complaints about it but this is a huge one."

I prefer it for any viable combat, and even stay on the war steed when in towns. It becomes second nature, is faster, but the real thing I dig is the great (for me!) mounted combat - zooming in, swiping, long turn, come back around with a nice melee hit as the enemy charges by, love it"
lotro,2xlwkx,chaostheoryXD,5,Sun Mar 1 23:02:34 2015 UTC,Pretty much just pew pew pew.
lotro,2xlwkx,bill_gonorrhea,3,Mon Mar 2 03:04:41 2015 UTC,This is the best summary of hunters.
lotro,2xlwkx,ObsessedWithHobbits,3,Mon Mar 2 08:53:44 2015 UTC,"Red hunter: Pew pew pew from afar  Blue hunter: Get closer and pew pew pew while backing.  Yellow hunter: Set all your traps in front of you and pew pew pew.  No, but seriously, a few non-obvious things  1 Induction skills have a post-attack animation, ""fast"" skills interrupt this animation and start immediately. So repeating induction-focus-induction-focus patterns reduces your average inter-skill times.  2 The devil is in the details. Learn the secondary effects of attacks, such as how much a bleeding last and how many can you stack, and time your cycles accordingly. Two things you must look for if you don't know what they are: remove corruptions and interrupt.  3 Learn the types of enemies and how to adapt to them with stances, oils etc... A boss with a big morale pool is different than one with a thick armor, or one with a swarm of support trash mobs."
lotro,2xlwkx,elrohir_ancalin,1 point,Mon Mar 2 10:55:54 2015 UTC,Post-attack animations are annoying. I have no idea why they would force you into a playstyle of Induction->Focus->Induction when sometimes Induction->Induction is the more efficient option.  Champions have something similar going on with several of their skills and make them feel very clunky to play (at least until they get their Attack Duration reduction from what I hear).
lotro,2xlwkx,Darchseraph,1 point,Tue Mar 3 11:20:09 2015 UTC,Wow! Thanks so much for the information :) I really hope I can put this to good use.
lotro,2xlwkx,exploderator,1 point,Tue Mar 3 21:46:19 2015 UTC,Agreed!
lotro,2xlwkx,exploderator,3,Tue Mar 3 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"Cheers, and welcome to LOTRO fellow hunter :)  Sadly, I think you will find a real lack of up to date guides, because many big changes happened after the population was already in steep decline, so fewer people have bothered to keep up with publishing such info.  I also can't promise a lot of help for the current state of play at lower levels as a hunter, because it's been years since I leveled up.  However, some of the basic principles remain, and I honestly think they are the most important things anyways, the details are not so important until higher levels, and hunter is simple to play.  Concerning traps.  I'm sorry to say, but I think Turbine completely screwed us.  Traps used to be a crafted supply, a weaponsmith would make you stacks of traps for your level, triple traps and bear traps being most noteworthy.  You could use them from very early on, and they helped a lot.  Now we can't use the better trapping skills until higher levels, when we have enough trait points to unlock them, and even then it is a huge sacrifice to our damage output in every other way.  Most hunters would never trait yellow except for very rare use in raids, where special crowd control could be helpful, which is still very rare because you normally just need damage, tank and healer, and seldom crowd control.  I think it's a real shame, because you don't need traps very much when you hit higher levels because your damage is so much higher, but I remember them being very very useful for soloing all the quests in the early levels, before we get better damage skills.  In short, we can't use traps well until we don't need them any more.  Concerning red vs. blue trait trees.  If you are skilled enough to kite around a lot during combat, the blue line is very good, and you will prefer the mobility.  But many of us hunters are not comfortable / skilled at combat in motion, so red gives us better damage and protection.  I think the biggest difference is how you trigger the combat skills.  Some people use keys for them, and seem to be good at hitting skill keys in between using WASD for moving.  Others, myself included, use the mouse to click on skills, and it's hard to juggle between looking and steering with the mouse, versus clicking on skills, so we tend to limit our movement a bit more.  In the early levels, it probably doesn't make very much difference, but red is probably a bit better damage.  About mele combat: you will use the odd blow, but mostly you do better damage for a given amount of time if you just stick with your bow.  I guess maybe that is a problem when you get swarmed at lower levels though, because your induction bow skills will keep getting interrupted.  Use a low cut, step back, and start firing again???  Damn not being allowed to have a stack of triple traps.  Aside from all that, you mostly just need to remember you start with focus, spend it on penetrating shot and other focus shots, pump it back up, spend it again, etc..  In a way, hunter is about as dead simple as it gets for combat.  Most of the important details won't be available to you until you hit higher levels, so don't worry too much.  As for armour and jewelry, agility and vitality are your two most important stats, in that order.  Might and will are a complete waste.  Fate helps, but is not critical.  At any step along the way, don't hesitate to ask higher level players if they can craft you good armour, jewelry and weapons, it is usually easy and costs practically nothing in materials for lower level stuff.  Anyone I've played with would always be delighted to make you that kind of stuff for free.  Use Lotro Wiki, and look up the tailor, jeweler and weapon crafting sections to see what they can make for you, if it will be better than what you have, etc..  And don't hesitate to ask for help :)"
lotro,2xlwkx,exploderator,2,Mon Mar 2 02:27:52 2015 UTC,"rereads 500000000x Okay, Okay....Thank you so much for all the information! You guys are all so helpful and I really appreciate it! I definitely won't hesitate to ask. I'm liking the red line...I think. I'm not sure haha I'm trying to get a feel for how to play in combat. So, these are very helpful! :)"
lotro,2xlwkx,7h3C47,2,Tue Mar 3 21:51:16 2015 UTC,"Just remember not to take it all too seriously, and not to rush.  As long as you aren't completely struggling to survive combat for on-level mobs (white color names), and can take on mobs above you (yellow) in a pinch, you are doing well enough to not go freaking out about how well your toon is built.  Hunters are always squishy, and will always take a real beating when swamped with mobs, so just do your best to use strategy to limit that from happening.  Take your time, keep as much distance as you can, lay a trap, etc..  And never be afraid to run away if you have to, that is a very real part of the game.  I totally sucked at the game until sometime in the mid 20's, I completely didn't understand combat properly, and was flailing badly.  Then I decided to go read, and found people discussing skill sequences, and it all came clear.  I organized my bow skills in a line, with my mele skills just above them, and made it so my normal firing sequence was a simple 1234 kind of thing.  Focus -> Swift Bow -> Penetrating Shot -> Quick Shot -> Quick Shot -> Penetrating Shot ... repeat.  Modify and spice up as needed.  But you have a basic starting framework to add skills as needed.  And eventually all those skills will become improved versions, and you will very much enjoy :)  Final tip: consumables.  There are a bunch of consumable foods, scrolls and potions that help you.  I like getting fully buffed up when I'm going questing in hard places.  All these last from 5m to 30m depending on the exact kind you have.  You need to find a friendly cook (foods) and a friendly scholar (scrolls potions and oils), and they should be glad to give you stacks for your level.  And I mean give for free.  Lower level stuff has almost no auction house market value at this time, people are usually just glad to help new / lower level players, it's one of the best things in the game, and the cost is trivial to us.  It really will make a nice difference if you are finding a certain line of quests just a little too hard, if you have all your buffs in place.  Three kinds of food: one boosts your healing rate, one boosts your agility or vitality (you need the right kind), and the last is a soup, that boosts your resistance to damage.  Then scrolls: battle lore and warding lore boost your damage output and resistance.  Hunter specific: bow chants for hunter (breach finder) reduces enemy's resistance to your damage, fire or light oil makes your bow do a little extra damage over time (it's also totally cool shooting fire or light).  And finally potions (pots): you have morale pots (athelas essence)  to heal in battle, focus pots (regains your focus in battle), and then a bunch of healing pots that remove corruptions of wound/fear/poison/disease in emergency.  OK, I'll shut up now ;)  Cheers, and happy playing :)"
lotro,2xlwkx,tboasis7,1 point,Tue Mar 3 22:57:22 2015 UTC,"Awesome! Thank you so much! Yeah I've that problem where I take it seriously because I have a very silent but very competitive side.

You guys are so supportive though and I super appreciate it!! I do have fun, I just need to remind myself to chill. :) you're not the first to tell me this either! Thanks so much :)"
lotro,2xlwkx,Crash665,1 point,Tue Mar 3 23:05:08 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know exactly what you mean about wanting a perfect build, and being competitive (actually with myself).  Here's what I've come to think about it:  We level too fast to worry about true perfection, it only matters as something to grind for when stuck at level cap (L100 for now).  Lots of the very top gear at lower levels of the game is effectively impossible to reach as a solo player.  Firstly, some of it is only rewarded by instances / raids, and you might not be able to get people to play them with you.  Then, by the time you can earn some stuff, you will have leveled past it.  You would have to disable leveling.  If you have many alts and/or a huge active kin, maybe someone can get you good stuff ahead of time, so you would have it ready to use the moment you reach that level.  This applies best to crafted armour/jewelry/weapons, and sometimes to reputation armour available from factions in different places.  You want someone to craft you reasonably good stuff ahead of time, so you can put it on right away and actually get the benefit.  Or else if you can get lots of reputation items from someone else (or a higher alt), you can get kindred reputation with the people in the area you are playing, and get their best equipment right away, while it is still on your level.  Otherwise you usually don't have the reputation to get the good stuff until you're leveled past, same problem all over.  Of all those options, getting crafted gear made ahead of time is the easiest, assuming there is reasonable stuff available.  That way you get to use it right away when you hit level, and don't have to worry about hard grinds for obscure gear.  Sometimes you will get something better from quest rewards, so you use it, but mostly the crafted stuff gets you through.  I learned to shoot for ""good enough"" and comfortable combat with mobs at or near my level.  There were times at first that I didn't know what I was doing, and I sucked, and it was a struggle to the point that it wasn't fun, and it detracted from enjoying the story.  But the best fun in the game is really the story, and you can spoil that fun by trying too hard too :)  I can't stress enough though, that all the crafted stuff you need for lower levels should be freely and gladly provided by friendly players.  Try to save up the crafting materials they would need, if you get them in combat, and try to get any special recipes they need, if you can.  It's polite to offer, and could be handy if they haven't kept lower level supplies in storage.  But it's really just a case of you trying to be as useful as you can, not a case of expectation that you have to provide everything and pay your whole way.  Most players are pretty rich by higher levels, and that includes having plenty of game gold.  I have given away thousands in gold to help people out, gladly, and all I can say is what better thing could I do with it?  Don't be ashamed to ask for and accept generosity, it is your good company having fun with us that is really worth something here :)"

West-Rohan: I would suggest skipping the previous 2 options and just going straight for the expansion content. Famous characters, iconic locations and some nice changes of scenery. Some parts are better than others (Broadacres, ugh). Ties directly into the progression towards Gondor.   NOTE: Doing just the epic book (10) in Wildermore is still worth it.

At first I started in Hyboldt and did the 5 quests for the day, or whatever it was, but decided pretty soon to just move on to the expansion content.  I only rode around Wildermore long enough to open up some stable points and find Nona's cave. The zone looks nice enough but I didn't really feel like doing a snow area. West Rohan started off with a bang, and the first few quest rewards were nice upgrades, so it's definitely where I want to be."

lotro,2xem08,MessyR,2,Sat Feb 28 12:39:08 2015 UTC,"No. Yellow line is terrible in 98% of situations when compared to the other 2 lines. The red line is the one that is overpowered, and can be used for everything except major tanking situations or when aggro is extra important. (If it weren't so overpowered, yellow wouldn't be almost completely worthless.)  When combined with two traits from the yellow line (Radiate and Insult to Injury), AoE'ing deals major bleed damage and heals you at the same time. In this picture he is using the blue line. (see Litany of Defiance and Shield Wall)  It works with the right build, but it takes at least 3 times as long to kill that many mobs, probably longer if you're comparing to red line + 2 hander."

lotro,2xdj7n,heyssunshine,5,Fri Feb 27 18:12:16 2015 UTC,"Getting back into the swing of things can be difficult, but I would advise that if you remember having fun on your character, then go back to the Lore-Master. If you think you were kind of tired or fed up with it when you quit, try something else.  As for playing the LM, there are 2-3 to know while leveling. First, use the red line to get much stronger attacks. While it might take a while to get there, before too long you will start to enjoy having an opening barrage that will kill almost anything. The burning embers, followed by the rooting ground slam spell, followed by wind, and then a stun will get most everything you come across to fall over. Next, use your pet's skills to defend yourself! The bear can taunt away monsters that threaten you, so use that when an enemy closes in on you and you can't use your stuns to keep you safe. Lastly, try finding groups from time to time to learn how to use the crowd control skills and less offensively powerful debuffing spells.  To answer your question concerning role, the LM is a capable DPS monster, a master controller using stuns, roots, and debuffs to damage/defences, and if traited right, it can provide quite a bit of healing support even if not designed to heal as well as the rune-keeper and minstrel.  As always, happy hunting and welcome back!  Edit: MMORSEL link removed since the site appears to be defunct."

lotro,2x9ofy,7h3C47,3,Fri Feb 27 04:49:57 2015 UTC,"I rolled a burglar recently, so I have little experience with the class. I imagine that the advent of trait lines gave enough versatility to other classes and made burglars obsolete. Burglar is a melee damage class with buffs with medium armor. If someone want to do melee damage, there is guardians, captains, and champions that are heavy armor classes that are more durable. Captains can also provide buffs, so I imagine Captains are preferred over Burglars.  That said, it seems like a challenge that I will be interested in mastering."
lotro,2x9ofy,fadhero,8,Thu Feb 26 20:20:46 2015 UTC,"Captain buffs and burglar buffs are very different. The captain will select one of a few stats to buff for all party members during combat and they have a buff that gives all party members better primary stats, and a few short term buffs for during combat. The burglar primarily works by giving themselves buffs that grow and shrink in power during the combat, and they apply tricks to enemies to give strong debuffs, like extra incoming damage, increased chances for the enemies to miss, they hit less hard, they critically hit less often, or slower attack speed. That said, the two classes really go at improving the group's performance in entirely different ways.   Additionally, the split between heavy and medium armor has always been there and burglars are still seen as DPS and debuff masters, so I don't think the options of guard, captain and champions are what the OP is observing."

lotro,2x9ofy,Tywien,1 point,Fri Feb 27 10:49:24 2015 UTC,"As a newer altoholic, at lower levels (Sub 40) Burglars, RKs, and Champions are kind of unattractive classes.  Burglars have their DPS matched by most other melee classes; all of which are much more survivable.  RKs are basically discount minstrels. Red Minstrels >>> Yellow RKs and Blue LMs>>> Red Line RKs for me in terms of overall feel.  And Champions are a pretty cool class, but I haven't invested enough time in attack duration reduction to avoid the very clippy and stuttery skill feeling which is why it's my one of my least favorite classes.  Basically Burglar is a pretty unattractive option unless you intend to PvP since Stealth is of limited use in most PvE encounters."

Once you got access to the Light of the Rising Dawn, you got 3 stuns (and the occasional stuns from your bear/bog lurker too) in your arsenal to exploit the Injury to the Insult- which is a highly damaging skill, enough to make short work of most of the landscape mobs."

Look for skills that let you control the pace of the fight. A build like this will allow you to reduce enemy damage, increase your mobility, and keep tighter control over your enemies through better roots and stuns. If you feel like you need to provide healing, swap out a couple of red traits for mending lore. If you feel like doing less direct damage and letting your pet take over your DPS while you do more support, drop the red traits and build the DPS.  http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2dB  Red - Enemies die in a fire. Really, just load up on fire damage increases, sling some embers, and follow up with wizard signs. Toss in all the AoE and mid-duration cooldowns (like ents, lightning strike, etc), and you can burst with the best of them and keep up a decent rotation of DoTs and direct damage to carry through longer fights. If soloing, you might feel squishy, but only on the rare occasion when something lives long enough to make it to you. A build like this will let your fire and lightning skills destroy most foes in short order and gives you some additional debuff skills for longer fights. http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2dC  Blue - Sic 'Em and general pet buffing make for a solid DPS base that you can add to or spend your time focusing on supporting your pals. Honestly, everything in blue is pretty much worth taking and then you should add points into red for greater fire damage and faster inductions if you want to continue to do more dps or concentrate on improving debuffs in yellow if you are looking to support. That decission should be made based on your groups' requirements. If going solo, I would say splash red like in this build since most things shouldn't live long enough to make debuffs necessary. If you do that, make sure to save big DPS cooldowns for when you have your pet critical buff. http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2dD"

Start out with placing volcanic runestone to draw aggro, use the threat reduction skill that has a chance to lower induction times, it also adds a bleed, use essay of fire to get no induction for next skill use scathin mockery to add another bleed and because this is the longest induction. Stack writ of fire and firey ridicule, this is easy because you get no indiction writ of fire after 5 fire skills and firey ridicule is a quick induction.

lotro,2x6799,notwhoithink,2,Thu Feb 26 15:50:27 2015 UTC,"One question remains, did they really remove all the bonus from the armor sets?    Yes and no.  The last armour with set bonuses was the level 85  Hytbold stuff, which was pretty good.  But by level 95, they moved set bonuses over to the fancy jewelry that you get from big battle rewards, and the armour is good enough that you don't worry about it.  That applies at level 100 as well, there is special high end jewelry with fancy set bonuses, that is the best stuff, earned with points from big battles.  When you get to level 100 and do a whole bunch of the Dol Amroth daily quests, is when the essence armour gets good.  There are also some armour sets with set bonuses, similar to the Hytbold, but I don't think they are worth the bother, and I see nobody ever use them.  You just keep your quest won armour until you can replace it with essence armour.  The full essence armour bought in Dol Amroth, with 4 essence slots on each piece, ends up being more powerful than any other armour, because the high quality essences have much higher stat numbers than anything before.  Example, you get about +850 morale from one essence, where you would normally see maybe +450 morale as one ""built in"" stat on normal armour.  +1250 physical/tactical mastery from essence, versus +800 built in.  +3500 finesse.  With numbers that big, a full set of 6 armour is 24 essence slots, the results don't really need set bonuses.  And finally, you can do crazy stuff, like build yourself extra armour pieces that have all physical/tactical mastery for crazy high damage, and others with high resistances for raids, and swap back and forth.  Just remember the pants and jacket are extra expensive, so you want to swap boots, helmet, shoulders and gloves if you are going to make multiple choices.  I hope that puts things in perspective.  Now you can look forward to having to grind out a lot of essences, and do a lot of head scratching to figure out what stats you really want for a perfect build for your preferences.  It's a huge chore building essence armour, but take heart that armour and jewelry from quest rewards and big battle rewards can still add up to very respectable sets, so you won't feel like a total gimp waiting to build the essence armour.  I put off building the essence gear for a long time, until I had a huge stockpile of good quality essences saved up.  When I finally made the change, I can tell the difference, my damage is punchier, but I am a little more fragile, so over all essence armour didn't really make me into superman, it feels just a little bit punchier on the DPS.  Cheers and good luck :)"

You just have to really watch your options, the quest reward gear is not great, but you can build a good enough set using the better pieces from epics and finishing up helping little towns and such.   I think I might still have had 3 of my Hytbold when I hit level 95 (most important set bonus), and I immediately switched to level 95 crafted teal armour and jewelry, which actually did very well for a long time.  There was also lots of level 95 big battle teal rewards armour and jewelry at that time, and I did use a few of those pieces to balance the build, and that lasted me to level 100, when I could upgrade with a few level 100 bits while I very slowly built my essence set.  One thing I always did that helps a lot is I've always tried to have very well built second or first age weapons, with top grade relics and legacies and title.  The extra stats can help make up for a slightly less than perfect armour and jewelry build.  I did build a level 95 first age bow, and it's actually still a good bow at level 100, the DPS is not as much lower as you would think.  I would not bother building a first age bow at level 95 now, unless you have the experience runes stored up and a free symbol to use, and I would not spend to max out all the legacies, because you will need to do all that again at level 100 anyways, and you get to keep your level 100 weapons going forwards."
lotro,2x6799,exploderator,0,Thu Feb 26 21:48:51 2015 UTC,"Well, after I found out about those dropped L90 armor recipes I went and got them, then whipped up a crit set. My armor rating went up by nearly 45% from the Hytbold set, and my crit chance and physical mastery (important for a hunter) went up by nearly 20%. I no longer had issues with being squishy to blue mobs.   One thing I always did that helps a lot is I've always tried to have very well built second or first age weapons, with top grade relics and legacies and title.   I have a fully decked out L85 second age bow and sword. I thought that I was doing well until I got a quest reward sword with a DPS rating of 181. My previous off-hand weapon was rated at 120-ish, my LI sword was 140-ish, and my bow around 160-ish. So I found an L90 3rd age bow and it's DPS was over 210. There's a huge gap between L85 gear and L90 gear, and I feel like the discrepancy is far more pronounced than at any other level I have found so far."
lotro,2x6799,notwhoithink,-1,Sat Feb 28 02:05:48 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I am a little surprised, I honestly didn't know that the L90 crafted armour existed, but checking lotro-wiki I see they are indeed a good in-between step up from the Hytbold gear.  Good catch, and nice that they don't cost a bunch of emerald shards to make (they aren't large guild recipes).  As for the bow, I had a L85 First Age, all topped out, and the DPS was maybe 195, so that's why I didn't sweat it trying to build a L90 Third Age bow, and just waited for the L95.  There's also issues not reflected in the base DPS rating, like if your legacies are all maxed out, so you can get full +25% damage from critical hits on both focus and induction shots.  If you end up with crappy luck, you might not be able to afford maxing out the legacies, and your bow might not do any more damage as a slightly lower level bow that is perfectly built.  That being said, 160 up to 210 DPS is a BIG step.  As for the sword, I don't change them up very often, because as hunters we barely do mele combat anyways, especially since the latest updates to trait trees.  I almost never use my mele skills any more, mostly just the  10s daze one.  I still have my L95 Second Age sword, because I've had like 3 L100 ones made, and they all sucked way too bad to bother actually building them out.  I suppose I'll have to try again, because the L100 weapons will be our long term keepers when the new imbue system happens."

If they are releasing new quest zones and not raising the level cap then you're going to get a ton of quests for that cap level (i.e., at 65, at 75, at 85, at 95, and 100).  That's how they give players at level cap something to do until the next time that the cap is raised."

lotro,2x4r3c,Kraekus,5,Wed Feb 25 17:32:52 2015 UTC,"The Wiki page has a break down of the skills and trait lines, so you can take a good look at our options.  My thoughts on the trait lines:   Blue spec - Off-tank - a viable tank if you have a healer and master the self-healing and buff skills. Really only for use in group play or especially tough solo instance mobs. Limited damage skills available. Horn of Champions available for building threat.  Red Spec - Single Target DPS - Striking a balance between the durability of blue and and the DPS ability of yellow specs, red spec gives morale boosts on kills and can stack fervour to unleash major damage. A few small AoE attacks are also available. This is a versatile spec line. I initially used red spec to do solo content until I got used to yellow spec. Enough damage to beat 1-2 mobs at a time with enough durability to easily survive against strong mobs. Yellow Spec - AoE DPS - Best damaging dealing spec, Lots of AoE damage skills, but the squishiest of the three. It's what you want to equip in group situations if there someone serving as tank and you have a healer. I now solo on yellow spec now that I have a better feel for delivering max damage and staying alive vs. 3 normal mobs. Especially handy for going back and finishing slayer deeds quickly.   Other advice   Main stats are Vitality and Might, but don't neglect Agility or Fate.  Always use heavy armour.  The data I've seen supports always going dual wield unless you have an awesome two-handed weapon and not-so-awesome one handed.  When you get to use LIs, build two Champion Runes, one with Tank legacies and one with Damage legacies (First or Second Age preferable). Or if you have the room, build one for each trait line. Third Age Champ weapons generally aren't as good for DPS as things you can earn from quests or buy from special vendors.   One of the best ways I've found to learn the skills is by tracking class deeds for using skills and forcing yourself to use those skills you don't normally use. It builds good habits."

lotro,2x2eil,WardenMadness,13,Wed Feb 25 02:31:17 2015 UTC,"It depends on how dedicated you feel to the lore on where you want to RP, and not only that, but your ability to adapt to other people's stories crossing the one you develop for toon.  Generally, if you're looking for light or medium RP you should try out Landroval. This server also holds regular music festivals and events (which I've seen is pleasantly entertaining), does not bound you to the world of Tolkien alone meaning if you want to expand beyond the limits of lore it is most times accepted by the community (or ignored by others), and has a very social and active American community.  However, if you're looking for something a little more dedicated to Tolkien's vision of Middle Earth, I'd suggest you try out Laurelin. This server is most active during European hours and is dominated by players from the UK. This is where I am currently active (I am American) and I find it preferable for me to be active during the day but have quiet hours in the evening to catch up on deeds and quests privately. The roleplay here is better in my opinion (but that is only a preference, I have played on both and they are both very good servers for different reasons) since most enjoy lore-friendly stories and events and players tend to be more willing to take on bigger scenarios that take scheduled days of meeting and planning.  The community is smaller, Landroval is most definitely the larger of the two, but it is it's population that helps stories to combine and meet more easily through collective RP.  It is also very important to note that if you are looking for a particular type of RP, you may want to seek it out beyond the Prancing Pony in Bree - that is where most begin their roleplaying and for some it remains their eternal hub of story telling - but if you are open minded and willing to experiment with broader stories and diverse visions of the world, go ahead and mingle.  I am uncertain of the most active and popular kinships on Landroval, but on Laurelin the kinships I am most familiar with and have personally come to know their friendly and welcome nature include:  Riders of the Riddermark  Vanimar  Loth-I-Lonnath  Durin's Folk  Warband of Imladris (my kinship!)  Children of Iluvatar  (There are plenty more, but I can't seem to think of them on the spot. Go ahead and find the right kin for you if you'd prefer not to play solo.)  TL;DR  Landroval = light/medium RP + Americans + lots of music  Laurelin = some light/medium/heavy RP + Europeans + lots of lore"
lotro,2x2eil,Faorie,5,Wed Feb 25 04:41:49 2015 UTC,"Very comprehensive. One thing to add is that both servers are a lot more international than the others, obviously since everyone comes for the RP regardless of nation. We say American or European, but the mix is really more diverse than most other servers."
lotro,2x2eil,freedaemons,1 point,Wed Feb 25 06:39:32 2015 UTC,"Definitely, I should have expanded on that, but I'm sure it goes without saying that all servers are not restricted to two countries. Both are super diverse and have lots of players from all over the world joining in on roleplay!"
lotro,2x2eil,Faorie,2,Wed Feb 25 17:30:05 2015 UTC,Thanks so much. My newest toon is on Laurelin and I've been slightly lost on how to get started RPing. That kin list will come in handy!
lotro,2x2eil,krysjez,1 point,Wed Feb 25 15:36:16 2015 UTC,Happy to hear that you're trying out roleplay! I hope you have a good time and get some good stories sorted for your character.
lotro,2x2eil,Faorie,1 point,Wed Feb 25 17:30:49 2015 UTC,I have stories! But I guess it's still a little hard for me to see the point of it sometimes - so far I've just had random conversations with people in the Pony that are just us rehashing our characters' backgrounds.
lotro,2x2eil,krysjez,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:10:06 2015 UTC,"Roleplaying is not really designed to suit everyone - some enjoy it far more than others. It's storytelling and, more than anything, it's improvising. You get what other players give you and you explore those ideas with some of your own, and vice versa. It's a story that you have a major influence on and it's that uncertainty of others' reactions in character to it that keeps things exciting and entertaining. When it comes to roleplay in the Pony, you'll have a fairly difficult time finding much variety (not to insult to a specific idea or character, but many stories are unintentionally recycled).   This is where I would say finding an RP kinship best suited to your interests will make the game significantly better because you'll have kinmates who are far more consistent with your character and his/her story while you still develop your own history.  But if you feel you're not enjoying roleplay in any form, then unfortunately it may not be for you and I wouldn't want to encourage you to keep trying if you're just not interested (assuming that may be a case - I'm aware it may not be this at all!)"
lotro,2x2eil,Faorie,2,Thu Feb 26 02:29:18 2015 UTC,"I learned alot from your comment, Thank You :D But can you please list the differences between RP and a regular server."
lotro,2x2eil,Faorie,3,Thu Feb 26 01:48:43 2015 UTC,"A regular server and an RP server are not different in many ways, but those few differences are rather major to how you tend to see this game and how others see this game. Some major notes I'd imagine are most important are that:   You will see a larger number of players ""walking"". In character (IC) the idea of running around in real life just doesn't suit well with stories by it's rushing nature. So people walk in-game as they would in their real lives. But do note that not everyone on the server is a roleplayer, so not everyone does this - and there is such a thing as being out of character (OOC); which leads me to my next point... IC and OOC labels. Names you see in white will technically be considered IC - though not everyone follows this rule to the dot. It simply states that this particular player is available and willing to roleplay. Normal yellowish names signal OOC status, so they will more than likely not be willing to RP at the moment. But again, some do not follow this rule and you'll definitely find a handful of players RPing while their names remain yellow. To access this, you simply type ""/rp on"" to change your name to white, and ""rp off"" to change it back to it's default yellow. From the moment you begin RP, it is encouraged to remain consistent, meaning if something happens to your toon or you say something to another toon then whatever had been done or said must remain in your history. An example would be if you had told my character, Faorie, that you are a traveler from the Shire looking for ingredients to bring home, it is suggested that you do not tell another player a moment later that you are a sellsword from Rohan in search of a long-lost companion. It does not add up! We're all about development and it's alright to change your background here and there, but know that once something is publicly noted it becomes difficult to update everyone on the changes you've made later on. You'll find a significant amount of people making great use of the emote function in chat. To properly access this, you'd have to use ""/e"". An example:   You type: /e waves hello to everyone. Chat will show: WardenMadness waves hello to everyone.  Along with these, you'll find an abundance of emotes in roleplay, so be sure you get to know your emotes well for RP effect!   Lastly, and most importantly, NEVER take anything personally when it comes to RP. It is all a story, and everything that is done IC is directed to your toon, and never to you as the player. That's where separation between toon and player comes into play. Your toon will become it's own identity and you as the player remain as yourself. So if another character, like me, comes up to you and hypothetically says IC ""What an unpleasant sight it is to see such a strange traveler of this sort in Rivendell"", it is of course not to you! It is simply something you can react to IC by responding ""I see the ego of you Elves has not changed a bit"" or perhaps not respond at all. Improvise with the new script material provided to you!   And remember to have fun!!"

lotro,2x29sw,Big_Daddy_Dingo,2,Wed Feb 25 04:22:27 2015 UTC,"I would suggest choosing a different class as a first main. Burglar isn't the most straight-forward easy class to begin with. And, Burglars (in my opinion, and people I know agree) are generally boring until higher levels (Moria/50+). As an alt character, burglar could be good to level up and see if you enjoy. The problem with starting out as burglar, too, is if you find the class boring, you may find the game boring and want to quit.  As a main, supplier, I suggest Hunter or Champion. If Wardens weren't difficult to get into, I'd suggest it... Wardens are really fun but a harder class to learn then master. Anyway, hunters have travel skills so you can travel easier than other classes. They are good for starting out solo to get used to some mechanics. Champion is sort of a melee version of hunter (without travel/port skills). They have more AoE and if you like melee over ranged it may be worth trying.  For a ""supply"" class, any could be. Hunters and Wardens may be best with travel skills. Otherwise, I suggest getting the explorer profession and possibly ignoring the tailoring part of it. You can use the woodworker to gather wood, and prospector to mine for all of your alts. You can also turn hides into craftable leathers."

Warden was one of my first classes and I thought it was simple at first, but by time I got to 5 gambits (different leveling/skills/trait system back then), it was hard to know what all did what and what else would change what something did. Most of it was still line-based, but you didn't have any other finishers get boosts for using previous gambits in the line back then.

My favorite skill by far is startling twist (8s stun, up to 3 close mobs). Having it down to a 20s cd means that I can use it almost every encounter sometimes twice or more in an instance.   The riddle skill (30s daze) is also helpful to take a mob out of the fight.  To top it off we dont do half bad dps! (but like people said no AoE)  Solo: the stuns, stealth, and self heals definitely make it a viable class if group play isnt your thing.

lotro,2x29sw,Ayustam,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:27:54 2015 UTC,"My first character was a burglar, thinking that I was getting into a class like WoW's rogue. The game play is pretty similar for a few levels, but burglars get to have varied play styles and neat mechanics that I never saw mirrored in WoW.   I would say that it is as good of a class to start with as just about any other, as long as you are willing to play to your strengths. Burglars can melt away single targets with strong critical hits, good control, and fast attacks, but you will find that taking on 3 or even 2 enemies can be a challenge since you don't have strong mitigations (armor/defense) and few ways to do damage to more than one at a time. That said, when you get access to the cooler abilities in the different trait lines, play becomes very fun, especially for the blue traits (best traits, in my opinion). Sure, red does some spectacular DPS and yellow is the king of control, but the gambler can place some really big DoTs, maintain good control, and feels very fluid.  As far as a starting or supply class goes, you will have to remember that any class can take and use any crafting/gathering profession (I recommend explorer for first toons, you can gather and process ore, wood, and skins, and use the skins for armor, and then either sell or reserve your excess materials for alts), and other, account wide resources and currencies (like marks) are just about the same to grind out on any character, regardless of class."

lotro,2x29sw,SirIBON,1 point,Sat Feb 28 10:23:34 2015 UTC,I reccomend a hunter as your main. And go explorer. With the ability to port everywhere in middle earth and farm fast it is a great class to assist you with future alts.

lotro,2x13a7,lookingatnothing,4,Tue Feb 24 21:25:27 2015 UTC,"I finished Lone-Lands and got to level 32, so that's probably the highest level you can squeeze out from a Free-to-Play account."
lotro,2x13a7,WardenMadness,3,Wed Feb 25 02:22:59 2015 UTC,"powerlevelling is real and very easy. I know a couple lvl 100 f2pers on laurelin, and I got from 0-40 in two days just powerlevelling gb and tuck"
lotro,2x13a7,Jeffplz,2,Wed Feb 25 12:57:12 2015 UTC,What is powerlevelling?
lotro,2x13a7,krysjez,2,Wed Feb 25 15:39:43 2015 UTC,going through instances and skirmishes at top tier difficulty 5 levels above yours with a level 100 to help you clear it
lotro,2x13a7,Jeffplz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 20:22:56 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this, though you probably earn enough Turbine Points playing through that to buy one quest pack (which should be Evendim)  It's also possible, if mind boggling dull, to farm points. Create an elf or dwarf, do the Ered Luin quests and deeds real quick and you get probably a 100 points. Repeat x whatever.  I did that when I wanted journeyman riding and was 1200 points short."
lotro,2x13a7,DiscoJer,5,Wed Feb 25 11:12:05 2015 UTC,"Level 30ish (3-4 zones) before you start having to pay for quests.  Technically you can grind to max level, but it's really boring. Also also technically you can grind for TP to buy quest packs, but it's really boring."
lotro,2x13a7,AlucardZero,4,Tue Feb 24 21:05:13 2015 UTC,"This. As FTP, you have access to the racial starter regions (Ered Luin, The Shire, Bree-Land) and the Lone Lands quests. These quests go to about level 32, though if you do everything in those regions you can hit lvl 35-36. After that, the only free quests are the epic quest line, which do not provide sufficient xp to keep you on level, and those quests will take you through regions that are not otherwise available for questing without purchase.   If you did through the internet, you may be able to find some coupons for free starter packs that give TP. The Steely Dawn pack even opens up the Evendim quest pack.   Bottom line - if you like the game enough to spend the time grinding TP, you are probably better off paying cash money for expansions, (the Quad Pack can go for $20 on sale)."
lotro,2x13a7,fadhero,4,Tue Feb 24 21:13:44 2015 UTC,"I got enough TP for evendim just getting through lone lands. Angmar I had the help of steely dawn starter from tremor games.  After that, I bought quad pack and I should have accumulated enough TP by the end to get helms deep.   Total cost is about $20 (on sale) and that gets me almost to level cap. Last few quest packs are low TP cost so whatever.  I'd say evendim is ""free"" since you should get enough by the time you're up to there.  As for grinding TP, just play through as another character with your friends to get some TP without it feeling grindy and boring."
lotro,2x13a7,Whitesymphonia,3,Tue Feb 24 21:46:33 2015 UTC,"Well, it depends. Generally it will get you into the low 30's with questing.  If you fully extend quests with an occasional skirmish (available to you), you should be able to get a bit higher, low-mid 30's.  If you do all those and finish out the deeds in zones, you can easily get mid 30's. With all the deeds you have done by then, you may have gotten enough TP to get another zone (like a 40-x zone, or the 30-40ish zone).  So, it depends how much you are willing to grind and how much you want to complete. Generally at least 30. Lone-lands is the last free zone and is 20-30. But with other factors you can get around 35 there."
lotro,2x13a7,Louey7,4,Tue Feb 24 22:39:03 2015 UTC,"you can access every single thing in the game without ever spending any real money.  you earn Turbine Points under the ""deed"" system (like, kill so many goblins in an area) and spend them to unlock content.  but that does take a bit of a grind.  level 20 is when this stuff starts to kick in"
lotro,2x13a7,SapienChavez,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:59:45 2015 UTC,"I got enough TP for Evendim and Forochel by questing and a small amount of grinding. I stayed in Forochel till just short of level 50, at which point I got bored of long distances and snow!   Based on my experience, I'd say that I took the free path as long as it's viable. Moria costs around 1500 TP if I remember correctly, and the time it would have taken to grind that out would have significantly detracted from the pleasure I got out of playing.  I have read some stories out people grinding their way through Moria all the way to max level, but I think those cases are very rare. I can certainly say that I'm not patient enough to do that, but each to their own."

lotro,2x13a7,charlie_echo,4,Tue Feb 24 20:55:51 2015 UTC,There is no level limit as free. It is just the content limit
lotro,2x13a7,Louey7,-6,Tue Feb 24 22:40:14 2015 UTC,"I think the highest available quest level is 20. You can go and grind anywhere you want, but you won't have any quests available after a certain point.   Edit: I don't remember if it is, but lone-lands might be open for f2p so maybe lvl 30ish quests."
lotro,2x13a7,raknor88,3,Tue Feb 24 21:02:54 2015 UTC,Not true.

If you don't know for sure the correct answer, then don't answer the question.  Is it really that difficult?  Lone Lands are F2P.  You can get to somewhere between level 32-35 by running the quests in the starter zones + Lone Lands + the epic quests that are available at those levels.  By then you should have accumulated enough TPs to pick up one more zone, which is usually Evendim."
lotro,2x0pt8,ColtoDex,3,Tue Feb 24 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"I would agree that it depends on what levels you need... Though I got Riders of Rohan and was able to get close to level 95 without any difficulty. I think once you get to 95, you're no longer playing as much for leveling though. I wish they would raise the level cap..."
lotro,2x0pt8,catalyst4evr,3,Tue Feb 24 20:05:23 2015 UTC,"My personal preference would be to entirely skip those 2. But... Riders of Rohan will get you to about 85 if you do the quests and all the mounted combat stuff. Helm's Deep gives big/epic battles. But I just personally find those boring. If you enjoy them or think you will, it may be worth getting. Otherwise Helm's Deep quests go to 95."
lotro,2x0pt8,Louey7,3,Tue Feb 24 19:39:57 2015 UTC,I think waiting for a steam sale for quad pack and regular helms deep would be much wiser.
lotro,2x0pt8,Cardiumm,2,Tue Feb 24 20:12:21 2015 UTC,"Quad pack doesnt have helms deep and apparently he's only missing riders of Rohan. Sale price is $20 usually which is the same as if he gets Riders of Rohan since that's all he would he out of it.  Waiting for a sale would be best though like you said. But I think he's looking to buy now, and is comparing"
lotro,2x0pt8,Whitesymphonia,3,Tue Feb 24 20:19:47 2015 UTC,Ah sorry I live in Turkey and we have different currencies on steam it would cost me 12.18 usd if it gets on 50% sale. Now I think I might even gain some cash by reselling codes.
lotro,2x0pt8,Cardiumm,1 point,Tue Feb 24 20:35:12 2015 UTC,"Haha. Could be, if they aren't region locked.   But yeah, $20 USD is normal sale price. Went to $5 once that I've seen so far. So even $15 for the packs is nice."
lotro,2x0pt8,Whitesymphonia,1 point,Tue Feb 24 21:48:32 2015 UTC,You get a key for turbine when you activate them on steam I can buy multiple activate on alts and sell them.
lotro,2x0pt8,Cardiumm,2,Wed Feb 25 06:22:31 2015 UTC,Depends on your level. I believe Rohan gets you to 85 and helms deep gets you to 95.  Helms deep has the epic battles system which is a hit or miss with people. Some love it some hate it.  It's mostly down to what levels you need.
lotro,2x0pt8,Whitesymphonia,2,Tue Feb 24 19:21:46 2015 UTC,"Riders of Rohan gets you from 75-85 and Helms Deep gets from 85-95, so like everyone said before it depends on your level and if your willing to spare alot of time to play that far into the game."
lotro,2wy445,krypy506,12,Tue Feb 24 03:00:05 2015 UTC,"Ok, this is going to be super vague, because it's been ages, but back in the vanilla version of the game, my friend and I were questing right in Angmar, north of north downs, where all the wyrms are. The game was pretty much brand new, and we ended up having to take on an elite dragon, just the two of us. I'm pretty sure it was actually a boss fight. On the fly, we came up with a tank and spank and took it down. It was the most ""I just killed a fucking dragon"" moment I've had in any video game. Good old days."
lotro,2wy445,aeisenst,13,Tue Feb 24 05:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's honestly a dishonor to name one ""best"" experience over at least a hundred other truly best experiences in the game.  Getting out of Moria, and into Lothlorien.  Finally earning enough reputation to get into Caras Galhadon, and exploring that amazing elf city for the first time, and wandering the Golden Forest.  It was heaven.  That they actually pulled off the magic of that whole place is an exceptional accomplishment."
lotro,2wy445,exploderator,2,Tue Feb 24 08:13:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely! I couldn't agree more. A lot of people say Lorien is rubbish but it's one of my favorite areas of the game. Due, in part, to the fact that Moria took me ages the first time through and I had grown beyond weary of the gloom. So stepping out of that damn cave and into the light of the land of the White Lady was euphoric!"
lotro,2wy445,CharmingJack,6,Tue Feb 24 16:15:40 2015 UTC,"I had the exact same experience you describe.  My only main was leveled before the Moria revamp, so the place was crawling with mobs, a fight to even move, dark, and hard, and I sucked.  I had loved LOTRO for the exploration and landscapes, but now I was trapped.  A couple of months later, I was barely playing, had almost quit, because it was just so unpleasant.  Then I finally mustered the inspiration to push, did a part day of questing to level up until I could just barely survive on the other side, and I ran for it.  Oh how it was sweet to see the light of day again.  They really did manage to capture something of the proper experience of passage through Moria, and although there was still a little grind to get reputation to be allowed into Lothlorien, it was all lovely, ending in a golden dream land.  I spent a good little while running loops around Lothlorien, carrying boxes, finding sticks, chaperoning drunks, and hunting mithril flakes.  It was good XP, good rewards, and largely a beauty.  Probably one of my favorite periods in the game, before I reluctantly set off to face Mirkwood."

Played Lore Master, and actually getting good at the class was an achievement, it was so easy to fail horribly  seeing the massive dragon (the one in the cave, can't remember it's name but it dropped the components for the dragon cloak) bounce Bobo (my bear!) all around the cavern in one of the phases.

I was so eager to get 50 to go to Moria on my Rune Keeper (this was months or so before the raid). I was up a long time finishing Eregion to try and just hit 50 to get there. I went there and it was the most boring experience I had so far in the game. I fell just about everywhere, and well I wanted to get out of there as fast as possible.

lotro,2wy9xw,holtemon,5,Tue Feb 24 04:09:16 2015 UTC,I have the quad pack and Lothlorien seems to be part of it. Not sure whether it's part of Mines of Moria or Siege of Mirkwood but I didn't need to buy anything extra.

lotro,2wy9xw,Dod4r,4,Tue Feb 24 10:18:17 2015 UTC,"Incorrect. It was originally part of the Moria expansion, but only to people who bought Moria when it first came out. It is now its own quest pack. It's usually part of quest bundles like the Quad pack."
lotro,2wy9xw,byzantinebobby,1 point,Tue Feb 24 14:27:19 2015 UTC,"youre kinda right.  it was the first free update after Moria came out, so it was not part of moria. (well, part of the map came with moria, the lake, but the major town was a seperate release)  the confusion come because at that time everyone had a sub and was ""vip"" so we ALL got it for ""free"" at the time.  after F2P and the need for quest pack, it all got wierd.  but to clarify, it was not part of the moria expansion  like how Wildermore was a free update after Rohan, but it is not part of the Rohan expansion."

lotro,2wwzsd,fyanriltz,7,Mon Feb 23 21:42:00 2015 UTC,"Join Landroval for RP and high pop server. Avoid Brandywine if you want RP.   To answer your first question. Yes you do get that feeling from the world. The zones are absolutely massive. They put zone size in wow to shame actually.  It really does feel like the ""frontier"" that you describe.  My suggestion is to give it a try to at least lvl 20 or so and judge for yourself.  I have only been playing 3 weeks. (long term wow player that got sick of the new xpack in one month) and I sub'd to lotro within the first week. This game gives me that mmo feeling that I have been missing from wow for years.   Quest packs are locked behind the ingame store, but if you sub you get access to them. Expansions have to be bought either with money, or ingame store. I have to say the reward system in LotRo its one of the best I've seen in a game.  You are rewarded with Turbine Points by doing achievements, completing questlines...etc etc.  Think of wow's achievement points, instead here they are an actual currency. So just by playing the game and completing deeds (achievements) you earn points to spend in the store.  It's a great system."

lotro,2wwzsd,theowlfromzelda,1 point,Mon Feb 23 23:32:14 2015 UTC,I'm going to start playing tonight. I wanted to try this out since I was interested in rp. Are you into the rp aspect on landroval? If so I'll message you when I get my character made :)
lotro,2wwzsd,fadhero,3,Tue Feb 24 00:38:50 2015 UTC,"Vastness - The game is huge, to the point where getting a horse is crucial to covering the distances needed to get to quest objectives. The game has enough content that a player could conceivably play two characters and have two completely different experiences until level 75. I especially love that you can see the distance between you and other members of your fellowship, and that it can be measured in kilometers.   Roleplay - the dedicated RP servers are very active. RP is not my cup of tea, but there are plenty of opportunities to do so if you like it.   The Store - The store is mainly for FTP players. The game is easily FTP up to about lvl 32-35. After that, one can technically do the epic quest line, but it does not give enough xp to say on level. You would have to grind instances and skirmishes to get XP and regional deeds to get TP to buy more content. My advice is to level a toon or two to about level 30 in order to find a class or two that you really like playing. If you think you will like the game and wish to continue, buy the expansion quad pack when it goes on sale, and spend some TP to open up some other starting areas. (If you can find a coupon for a free Steely Dawn starter pack, it comes with the Evendim quest pack, which covers lvl 30-40 and is the most popular of the <lvl 50 packs.). If you really love playing, the VIP membership is a good investment. If you go VIP, the store becomes largely useless. In-game currency (coin, skirmish marks, rep currency) can be used to acquire lots of good items, making the spending of actual money only necessary to buy content."
lotro,2wwzsd,AlucardZero,3,Mon Feb 23 23:07:02 2015 UTC,"Well, some of the zones have that feel (for example Angmar, Forochel, Isengard), but you have to get out of the newb zones first.  And on-level questing isn't very challenging."
lotro,2wwzsd,Fluffles123,2,Mon Feb 23 21:54:48 2015 UTC,I never really felt the danger of exploring in LOTRO. But there is greatly huge feeling of adventure in questing and exploring.
lotro,2wvdo1,Louey7,3,Mon Feb 23 14:10:06 2015 UTC,"Agility is the ""main"" stat for Wardens, but they never removed Phy Mastery from Might.  They've said they would at some point, but it's essentially been swept under the rug.  Warden's still need some Might to help boost block, but Agility is still the go to stat.  On my warden (level 100), I just added a couple of Might legacies to my two LIs and it boosted my block enough to make me happy with it.  However, prior to end game, it opens up a lot of options, which is nice."
lotro,2wvdo1,UDE785,3,Mon Feb 23 14:33:16 2015 UTC,"I rolled a warden recently, level 36 currently and I solo play.  I dont mean to highjack OP, but since you have a 100 warden, what are the best virtues to be taking?  I looked on the forums, but most posts are back from 2010-11."
lotro,2wvdo1,mapguy,5,Mon Feb 23 14:36:36 2015 UTC,"I'd suggest a slight deviation from the previous poster. Like he said, focus on getting your mitigations and on top of that resistances. However, virtues are an ineffective way to get morale, since the inflation of morale pools from RoI onward. I recommend using Zeal, Fidelity, Tolerance, Honour like he said. I'd advise using innocence instead of valour.  Valour grants 517 morale, 764 out of combat morale regen, 57 might.   Innocence grants 1539 physical mitigation, 1638 resistance rating and 513 tactical mitigation.  500 morale when you have 25k - 30k is a minimal difference, the out of combat regen is useless and 57 might is so minimal that it doesn't really matter.  While your common physical mitigation is capped by your armor, the uncommon ones (which are very important in the moors) only benefit from 20% of your armor, like your tactical mitigation. Resistance rating has a very high cap and is incredibly useful, giving you the ability to completely negate dots and debuffs. And tactical mitigation is great in general.   The reason people often do not use innocence is because it's a pain to level, but its one of the best virtues in the game, especially for pvp."
lotro,2wvdo1,Dod4r,3,Mon Feb 23 16:44:42 2015 UTC,"Just took a look at Innocence.  Can't even get started on most till I hit 50.  Also, Im assuming Im going down the right tree in Recklessness.  I should be focusing on the DoT increases as well?  Anything in there I should avoid?"
lotro,2wvdo1,mapguy,5,Mon Feb 23 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Aye, most of the innocence stuff is from quest deeds. Regarding trait points I've copy pasted a reply I made to a thread a week or two ago:  Part of your dps will certainly come as you level up. Masteries will allow you to build your gambits a lot  faster and you probally still need to unlock certain key gambits. Trait points will give you an extra 40%  light damage, amongst other things like DoT damage and crit chance. For your rotation, prepare Spear of Virtue with battle memory. Then use piercing strike > Brink of  Victory > Surety of Death > unerring strike. If you don't have all of these unlocked either skip them or use a lesser version (mighty blow instead of unerring strike, for example). This rotation puts 5 DoTs on your opponent, 6 or 7 if you're lucky (SoV and piercing can put 2 DoTs). For DPS there is really no reason to use any other gambits. This rotation works for both AoE and single target dps. The only thing you could change for AoE is starting with desolation in battle memory instead of spear of virtue when fighting 3+ targets. I've made a quick trait tree with 20 & 30 trait points: http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=286  http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=287  And to add to that post, here's a level 100 trait tree: http://www.lotrottp.lotrostatus.com/l.php?c=2c9  The key trait in the blue line is the +20% light damage with extra points to be put in to counter-attack and indefatigable. For red line its important to avoid the onslaught/wall of steel bleed trait shenanigans that is on the left side. Some people like to use the extra morale tap on the right side of the trait tree. I personally never find myself using it, if I need healing I'll use restoration or safeguard.  An alternative way to spend the extra points in the blue tree is to get defiant challenge and the trait that enhances it. This grants you mitigations for every target hit, so it can be useful in bigger fights. But do not under any circumstance drop the extra light damage!  For some more info you can check out the thread here:  http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/2vnain/warden_or_beorning_solodps/"

lotro,2wvdo1,UDE785,2,Mon Feb 23 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"Anything that adds Moral and either Physical Mitigation or Tactical Mitigation.  Virtues are one of a few areas my warden is lacking in (highest is level 7), but currently I use Zeal (Moral and Phy Mit + Armour value), Valour (Moral, Might), Fidelity (Tact Mit, Vitality, and power), Tollerance (Tact mit, agility) and Honour (Resistance, Tact Mit, and Vitality).  I've built my warden more around the Moors and dps than tanking.  However, it's still a solid build for tanking.  After finishing the virtue grind, I should have close to cap on both Mits."

lotro,2wu5lt,tboasis7,1 point,Mon Feb 23 09:33:00 2015 UTC,Reshade is the program I use to install sweetfx. Make sure you read the readme to change the .dll file from the dx9 version to the dx11 one called dxgi.dll  Basically sweetfx is a postprocessing set of files that add effect overlays to the game.   This site helped me learn how to configure it.

I could have just waited until I got to that point but I didn't want to wait. The higher level crafting stuff is expensive. So I started farming ore to sell.

If I were you I would start on another server. The free transfers could take a while and you sound like you need people to enjoy the game. If you continue with your main you might get lonely and quit again so I'd suggest starting on a server like landroval or brandywine.

In most circumstances, outside of raids with a specific lack of healers, yellow is really a better choice for keeping yourself and your fellowship alive. Place noble mark on the mob with the most morale, bleed it, and let the tank do their job from there. All you really need to be doing thereon is throwing out heals only when needed, and using targeted heals instead of fellowship heals if you only need to heal one fellowship member.   As a captain you really want to bring out the best in your fellowship, by buffing them and keeping them alive, but not by spamhealing.. use your melee heal skills, and defeat proc fellowship buffs on trash mobs around, and don't forget to use your shield brother skills, especially since after a point they apply to the whole fellowship, albiet with reduced effects. Shield brother skills give very substantial percentage based buffs that have pretty short cooldowns for how long they last, you can keep them up half the time, so don't underestimate them.  Finally, your best skills when you're not going red for the tonne of percentage based damage buffs there, are shield of the dunedain and last stand.

When your heals are not required in a group, the best approach would be to trait Red line and then invest your leftover points into either Blue or Yellow, depending on what your group lacks. If you already have a dedicated healer, then the best thing would be to go with Yellow line down to In Harm's Way and leave the rest in Red."
lotro,2wqx0x,tobascodagama,-2,Sun Feb 22 14:26:40 2015 UTC,"That's why you start your bleed before the tank uses their forced attack.   Traiting red is nice, but I'm assuming that this person is traiting blue, because he needed to heal. Red can barely keep itself alive, let alone a fellowship."

lotro,2wqx0x,SirIBON,2,Sun Feb 22 18:01:13 2015 UTC,"Halberds are for threat generation, well they were. The extra damage generates more threat. If you want to reduce your threat you should use a sword and shield. They have shields that reduce threat."
lotro,2wqx0x,majorlagg1,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:07:21 2015 UTC,"If you want to tank with you Captain, then go in Yellow. If this is not the case then stay away from Yellow in group play. There are people that believe that Yellow is well for soloplay. Let them their believe.  If you work in Groups skill like what the Group needs. Take Blue if there is no dedicated Healer. Take Red in two cases, the need of damage and the point of view, that everything that is dead, can not hurt your Fellowship. Have in Mind that you are not the true source of Damage, but you will support you dedicated Damagedealer(s) so much that they will perform 150%.  Atm me plays my second Captain, you can not ever have enough Captains. The Halberd did nomore create additional Aggro (this happen in the past). It gives you a ""2% Auto-attack Critical Hit Chance"" (Mirrored Gondorian Halberd of Combat, level 30 Guild Weapon)  Read the Threat generating information ""cazama1"" had linked, ""freedaemons"" you maybe too.  As Captain you generate Threat with Damage and Healing. In the past i healed and tanked 3-man in Red. This can become a lot. Ask the Champion if he is in Blue. He will not hold aggro against you, if he is not in the tanking stance. Have in mind, as a Captain, you can pick up the Role that is needed."
lotro,2wqx0x,tobascodagama,1 point,Fri Feb 27 11:50:32 2015 UTC,Is your tank generating enough threat? Is it the same person?
lotro,2wqx0x,cazama1,4,Sun Feb 22 14:16:31 2015 UTC,"That's my first thought here. Given that tanks should have access to at least a handful of Forced Attacks, they shouldn't ever be losing aggro outside of fights with a huge number of adds."
lotro,2wqx0x,tobascodagama,1 point,Sun Feb 22 14:28:44 2015 UTC,"I think thats the problem too. Hes a champion, rather than a guardian or warden. So in general I think I have more threat stealing abilities, with all my shouts and what not."
lotro,2wqx0x,Mencham,2,Sun Feb 22 18:02:56 2015 UTC,"I imagine low level champion as a tank would be kinda difficult.  You have very few traits to work with.  Champs solely rely on their damage for aggro, with only 1 single target forced aggro pull (which is very effective fwiw).  Try letting him just do damage and build aggro for awhile before you get in there.  Other than that there is really not much you can do.  Edit: I found this somewhat helpful, but it does not talk about threat from healing."
lotro,2wqx0x,freedaemons,1 point,Sun Feb 22 19:38:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for a Champion tank, you really want to let them build up some threat before going all out with heals. Actually, it's a good idea in general regardless of who's tanking.  My usual approach is to go the first ~10 seconds of the fight without any healing, unless the tank takes a really bad hit and drops below 50% morale or somebody other than the tank steals aggro. Then you can toss on your Words of Courage and use Valiant Strike just to keep HoTs up, which should frankly be all you need to sustain most decent tanks. WoC is pretty spammable, but you shouldn't actually be spamming it unless someone is in danger of dying."

I believe the quest ring is not displayed inside because you are not at the right place in a quest chain. The quest ring is displayed when some quest related condition is right. This condition gets checked when you are inside, but not checked, or not properly checked, when you are outside.  It looks like a bug. Submit a ticket.

lotro,2wkdo6,msbq,4,Sat Feb 21 00:16:27 2015 UTC,GF and I play the following:  Dual Minstrels. Nuke power is hilarious. AoE is decent enough to clear trash mobs quickly. Also we never need to look for a healer in larger fellowships.  Beorning + Captain. Dat DPS. Dem Heals. Neither are ranged so ranged aggro isn't a problem.  RK + LM: Pretty strong ranged combo. We are both squishies though.  The only combos that don't work too well are when one class is exclusively ranged and one is melee. Because in the landscape (not many signature and above mobs) the ranged person will keep all the aggro and the melee person is lucky to get only a few hits in.

lotro,2wkdo6,Ace0v,3,Fri Feb 20 22:44:53 2015 UTC,I liked playing champ/rk duo with my wife. Depending on traits you can be dps/dps or tank/dps. Although with beorn/beorn we now get the same options anyway.

lotro,2wkdo6,Ambassador_Buta,3,Sat Feb 21 01:03:30 2015 UTC,I've always enjoyed Warden and Rune Keeper together. The ranged ability of both can help with ranged fights. The Warden can tank if needed (for group content). The Rune Keeper can heal as well if needed. It just works out well. Both can also do a lot of damage to go through quests quickly.

lotro,2wkdo6,Vestus65,6,Sat Feb 21 02:10:06 2015 UTC,"Really...any two classes would be fine.  As for interesting synergies...  Guard/Burg - guard keeps the aggro and Burg does his thing Mini/Hunter - lots of ranged DPS, heals, and mobility Captain/Champ - lots of melee DPS, some heals and buffs  really though...any two characters can work if you find solutions.  most people solo the majority of this game, so, with a duo, you're just going twice as fast."
lotro,2wkdo6,mdtexeira,2,Fri Feb 20 18:15:28 2015 UTC,"Another vote for Guard/Burg.  That's how my wife and I are duoing in our latest playthru.  I gather 'em up and get their attention, she moves around the pile DPSing her ass off.  Groups of mixed melee and ranged can be a bit of a speed bump as they tend to pincushion me pretty liberally, but overall it's great fun."
lotro,2wkdo6,JesFineSaysBug,2,Sat Feb 21 16:57:38 2015 UTC,"Warden/Hunter do really well if you ask me.  Warden has a bunch of self heals, so they can stay in fights really well.

lotro,2wkdo6,Malorey,2,Sat Feb 21 08:24:51 2015 UTC,"My wife and I play together. The game is easy solo, and doing it duo makes it easy enough that you can pick whatever you want.  However, if you want synergies, we've done these and it has worked well:   Guardian and Hunter (up to 100). The hunter gets to murder with impunity and the tank almost never dies.  This is the most basic combination and works very nicely.  Can even do some fellowship quests. Warden and Runekeeper (up to 55).  A healer runekeeper is an interesting choice because the warden can draw aggro and never die, even if you go after harder adventures.  Very powerful.  Can do fellowship quests if necessary, even ones requiring a full fellowship, provided the warden keeps aggro. We also did Captain and Hunter (up to 75), which was a fun variant on the first option, but the captain loses aggro a lot.  Not that it matters... and the captain can heal the hunter in any case. Two champions for a few levels (up to the mid-30s or so).  That was hilarious and fun.  I switched to a loremaster and did crazy damage while the champion held aggro.   Two hunters.  Hilarious and fun.  I switched to a minstrel, and out-damaged the hunter.  That made me realize two minstrels could be amazing and amusing.   Oh.  Pick Landroval. Good luck!"
lotro,2wkdo6,phargle,1 point,Sat Feb 21 00:07:10 2015 UTC,"No question.  Champ/mini.You son and I played together duo from zero to 85 in a month of noob player. Most of the time mini us in red stance, but on rate occasion goto heals and let champ do dps. We comfortably played 5 levels above all the way through."
lotro,2wkdo6,observetheday,1 point,Sat Feb 21 06:07:19 2015 UTC,Guard/Burg is the classic. Guard is the tank and keeps the aggro while Burg dishes out positional DPS.

lotro,2wkdo6,Kants_Pupil,1 point,Mon Mar 2 20:19:59 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure Warden + Mini, RK or Captain can duo any content up to full FS with ease. Wardens are unkillable."
lotro,2wkdo6,StevenTM,1 point,Mon Feb 23 00:07:14 2015 UTC,"Any two is great, as the game really allows you to do everything but group content by yourself. As such, I would suggest that you keep one question in mind when deciding what to play: what sounds fun?  If you are doing free accounts, you will have the following options for classes available, and I will try to give a short account of what the strengths and play styles of each class are.  Burglar - Master controllers with good damage potential. Choices include mischief, where you focus on control by keeping enemies stunned for long durations, reducing their combat effectiveness, and still doing a bit of damage, gambler which uses a mix of buffing and debuffing (increasing your own and decreasing your enemies' combat effectiveness, respectively) with damage over time (dot) effects to do damage, or the quiet-knife which uses a lot of dots and direct damage attacks which are enhanced by standing behind the enemy. Stealth can also be used to sneak around enemies and steal stuff, but that is mostly secondary to combat. Restricted to men (basic humans) and hobbits.  Captain - A jack of all trades and master of none. They can support groups with great buffs and heals, go on the offensive with solid damage, or even take on a tanking role. The captain is mostly geared towards group play, so sometimes it can be frustrating playing alone, but it sounds like that wouldn't be an issue for you. Restricted to men.  Champion - Melee combat monsters with options to focus on one target, swing all out at anything within reach, or go defensive with self healing and shielding. They will always use either a two handed weapon or two one handed weapons, and can use a bow to let enemies know they are coming. Anyone but a hobbit can be a champion.  Guardian - Another martial class which can use a sword and shield to be a classic tank (damage taker, if you aren't familiar with MMOs), or they can pick a two handed weapon and either be a tank which uses debuffs to reduce enemy effectiveness or a simple damage dealer which focuses on big hits and dots. Anyone can be a guardian.  Hunter - Mostly focused on doing damage, hunters can sure bring the pain. Choices focus on shooting faster or shooting harder, or if you would like to help with battlefield control, traps can be used to keep enemies in place and increase the damage that others do. Anyone can be a hunter.  Lore-master - Using the powers of science and nature, they emulate wizards. They get to have a pet to work with them, and can either focus on making the pet do all the work, control using stuns and roots (keeping the enemy from moving) that rivals burglars, or simple damage dealing with fire and lightning skills. Only men and elves can be lore-masters.  Minstrel - They use the power of song to inspire fellows and destroy foes. You can either focus on doing a ton of damage, doing a ton of healing, or a hybrid that allows you to ebb and flow between the two. Anyone can be a minstrel.   There are three additional classes that require real money or a lot of grinding in game to unlock, but I feel like if you get to the point that you are considering shelling out for the classes, you will have already spent some time in LOTRO and will have a better understanding of them anyway. Let us know what you decide and how it goes."
lotro,2wjyaa,I_Give_Advice_,5,Fri Feb 20 15:22:10 2015 UTC,"It's still pretty active.  Honestly, there's a nice medium between very active and ghost town.  Especially in LOTRO where, unless you want to go VIP, you're probably going to want to do Turbine Point runs occasionally, and they're generally easier when you don't have a lot of competition for mobs.  There's rumors going about that there is going to be some low-population server shutdowns, complete with character transfers, so if you're not interested in having to go through with that, aim for one of the high population servers.  There's a bunch of threads in the reddit that deal with that question.  Lastly, if you're new and planning on being F2P, I've written a guide on steam targeted to you.  It's also linked here on reddit.  If you read it and have any questions, let me know."

I have a few friends and family who all play on different servers and I'm trying to convince them to migrate to one server so we can all play together, but none of them want to (which is understandable).

lotro,2wjyaa,Dufuss,2,Fri Feb 20 15:33:55 2015 UTC,"It is still active. Join Brandywine server. F2P is very good, but make sure you actually buy the game, the version is known as Premium. It is only a few dollars. It gets you so much more. Note that it is still F2P month-to-month."
lotro,2wjyaa,pakron,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:00:14 2015 UTC,don't plan on buying it now but maybe down the line
lotro,2wjyaa,arquebus_x,2,Fri Feb 20 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"The F2P is very forgiving. You don't need to buy anything to succeed, and you can go all the way up to level 30 before you need to acquire quest packs and areas. But, you buy things with Turbine Points (TP), which you can acquire over time in the game without paying a penny. You get TP by exploring the world and killing certain critters. And all of the TP you gain across different characters and servers is pooled together, so you can create multiple characters and run them around just to get TP. So if you're really dedicated, you could theoretically unlock every last piece of the game without spending a dime."
lotro,2wjyaa,Detective_Fallacy,1 point,Fri Feb 20 17:30:18 2015 UTC,"That's true, but the game stops being fun if you grind that much. OP, there are some good F2P/store guides out there that explain which quest packs are for which level bracket etc. I would suggest taking a look at them."
lotro,2wjyaa,mdtexeira,2,Fri Feb 20 18:00:27 2015 UTC,"I don't know what you mean by 'that much'.  I make about 240 TP (255 if everything goes really well) in 2.5 hours.  That's a quest pack on sale in 5 hours.  IMO, that seems pretty reasonable."
lotro,2wjyaa,Detective_Fallacy,2,Fri Feb 20 18:18:33 2015 UTC,"For some people, playing a game for 5 hours is a really long time. 600 TP is $8, so your approach would be 5 times less efficient than doing 1hr of a minimum wage job. There's nothing wrong with grinding TP, I do it myself as well, but the cost/benefit ratio isn't appealing for everyone."
lotro,2wjyaa,mdtexeira,1 point,Fri Feb 20 20:33:37 2015 UTC,"Fair enough...though, when grinding TP, you're also getting skirmish marks, and a shiny key for lootboxes.  I live in a country where I don't speak the language and most entry-level jobs are for apprentices, so right now even a minimum wage job is off the books...so I grind."
lotro,2wjyaa,Clearshot126,1 point,Fri Feb 20 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"Depends on how much you value your time. And also how much enjoyment you are getting for it. If it takes you 2 hours grinding in a game to get the same as 1h in a minimum wage job, you are probably still having much more fun with the 2h grinding."
lotro,2wjyaa,mdtexeira,1 point,Sun Feb 22 17:44:50 2015 UTC,how long does it take to farm a expansion?
lotro,2wjyaa,arquebus_x,3,Fri Feb 20 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"first of all, try and find a cheap/free way to get the Steely Dawn starter pack.  that will get you Evendim, which will get you to level 40.  if you are a completionist, by the time you run a toon through Evendim, you would have 915 TP from Evendim and the free zones, and whatever TP you'd gained from class deeds, reputation, racial deeds, etc.  you'd probably still be short on TP for Moria, but in the meantime, you need to pick a zone for levels 40-50 or so.  Angmar and Forochel are the main contenders.  Angmar is gloomy and has a lot of fellowship quests, and Forochel is snowy...sooo snowy.  Forochel is 200 TP cheaper than Angmar and only contains 25 fewer TP.  to make up the rest, you can run another character through the whole shebang again, but in my experience, doing deeds at level is excessively time consuming, and its much quicker and more efficient to just grind TP.  if you can find a free key for the Sam Gamgee starter pack, each new toon you start will get a slayer/skill boost which, if used wisely, can translate to very profitable TP runs through Ered Luin.  I've written a Steam guide which is about exactly this.    doing my normal TP grind, it would take 15 hours (more or less) to grind enough for Moria.  probably a little less if you can get really efficient with your grind.  that being said, the quad pack occasionally goes on sale, potentially allowing you to get all the expansions for 20 dollars or less, which is a great deal."
lotro,2wjyaa,Soarel2,2,Fri Feb 20 21:55:01 2015 UTC,Alright cool thanks for the reply
lotro,2wjyaa,nolins12,1 point,Fri Feb 20 22:05:58 2015 UTC,"Expansions are something like 2K to 4K TP. You can get around 500 TP by the time you hit level 20, if you explore most of the stuff and do most of the slayer deeds. If you're super anal about it, I think you can get around 900 TP. And perhaps another 400 TP between 20 and 30.  So you're looking at around 1K TP by the time you hit 30. So if you level up 3 or 4 characters to 30, that's an expansion. If you go balls to the wall, maybe a month...?"
lotro,2wjyaa,Soarel2,2,Fri Feb 20 18:49:08 2015 UTC,"Yes, there's a lot of activity but you need to pick an active server. The largest and most active is Brandywine, but the community there is very toxic. The second most active is Gladden, which I reccomend. After that you have Crickhollow which is just as toxic as Brandywine but not as active (lots of drama and trolling in crick /world chat), Landroval which is an active server for RP but severely lacking in endgame runs, and Laurelin which has both RP and endgame but is full of RP-nazis and other such assholes.   Those are just the servers I've played on. All my characters have been transferred to Gladden including my main Soarel at the moment. If you make a character there add Soarel to your friends list, when I'm online I'll make an alt and I can help you level."

They have them at several former level cap areas.  IMO the Helegrod rewards that you could get from them are the best, if you're at L50 at the time.  The sage that you barter with in the 21st Hall in Moria basically lets you trade them for either a couple of low relics or a different barter item that you can trade for a 3rd age LI.

Once your able to master the Gambit system the Warden is capable of the highest DPS. Great for tanking 10+ Mobs. And has the ability to effectively never die.  RUNEKEEPER - Heal/Dps Class. Another all rounder class. Highly recommended for healing in Raids/Fellowships.  HUNTER - Ranged DPS. Capable of very high burst damage. Also has the ability to teleport to various locations of middle earth and capable of taking friends with them. Good if you love to explore/farm.  This is a very brief view.

Minstrel - When solo, run around one or two shot kills on most mobs, learn mobile ranged combat. Healer in group play.

You can choose to either deal sustained DPS and debuff (blue line), straight burst DPS (red line), or debuff and crowd control (yellow line).  Captain: Skilled with everything, master of none. This jack of all trades class can fill any of the ""holy trinity"" roles, but not very well. Can heal (blue) DPS (red) or tank (yellow)  Champion: The heavy-armor DPS class. Think a warrior or barbarian. Can dual-wield or use two-handed weapons. Does tank (blue) single target DPS (red) and AoE DPS (yellow).  Guardian: The main tank class. Knight type class with great threat and aggro ability. Can be a straight tank (blue), a DPS (red), or an unusal hybrid of the two that focuses on two-handed weapons (yellow)  Hunter: Though called the Hunter this class is most similar to WoW's Mage, being a ranged DPS class with slow skills. Can also teleport players around the map with fast travel. Has mobile DPS (blue), stationary DPS (red), and debuffs (yellow).  Loremaster: The main support class. Has pets that it can use in combat alongside powerful magic abilities. Can focus on pets (blue), DPS (red), or debuffs (yellow).  Minstrel: Unlike most bards in MMORPGs which are usually support or buffing classes, the Minstrel is actually the main healer, though he has other roles too. You can heal (blue), DPS (red), or support (yellow).  There are 3 other classes introduced later, 2 being included with the Mines of Moria expansion and one being released separately at the end of last year. All three of them are fun, but you shouldn't try them until you're experienced with the game already, since they have unique mechanics (including an entirely different combat system used on the Warden).   Men can play all classes except two of the purchaseable classes. The Captain is Man-exclusive. Elves can play all classes except Burglar, Captain, and one of the purchaseable classes. Dwarves can play Champions, Guardians, Hunters, Minstrels, and one of the purchaseable classes. Hobbits can play Burglars, Guardians, Hunters, Minstrels, and one of the purchaseable classes. The Beorning is actually both a race and a class (really just a larger human with a special power).   I'd reccomend the Hunter, Guardian, or Champion for a fun first character. My favorite class is the Burglar but he's hard to get a hang of."

lotro,2wh5hc,StevenTM,1 point,Fri Feb 20 00:26:28 2015 UTC,The Warden is the hardest class to learn to play/play efficiently. I recommend you stay away from it for at least 2-3 months.
lotro,2wi0dy,Zombie_Spider,4,Fri Feb 20 01:44:23 2015 UTC,"Well build optimization isn't something you really worry about til higher levels when you can trait in more than one tree, the Trait Tree revamps make it pretty simple.  Go Red Line for melee DPS, the +20% Light Damage fairly low on the tree is very important. Yellow Line for Ranged/Hybrid DPS, and Blue Line for tanking.  In terms of DPS, stacking your DoTs are a pretty good practice. Spear gambits will give you good instant damage while Fist Gambits will give you more total damage over time against mobs with bigger health pools.  Brink of Victory (and its line) is one of the best AoE skills in the game as it is relatively spammable once you get masteries."
lotro,2wi0dy,Darchseraph,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:49:24 2015 UTC,"I normally tend to be a ""Mage"" class in mmo's, but I'm not really seeing one, is there some sort of summoning or mage based class?"
lotro,2wi0dy,Louey7,3,Fri Feb 20 01:55:35 2015 UTC,"I was the same way when making my first character way back. Although, I mistakenly thought Lore Masters were Mages of LOTRO. I'd consider Rune Keepers more mage-like, though.  Lore Masters and Captains may be considered summoning but not like summoning/raiding dead type class. They both have ""pets"" - Lore Masters being actual pets, Captains being Heralds.  Minstrels is another class that is ranged and cast spells, but isn't really mage-like. They scream and play instruments that can do high damage, as well as heal (like Rune Keeper).  Anyway, got a bit off-track there. Rune Keepers are most mage like. They can do high damage, and heal. They may a bit difficult to get into compared to other classes. Lore masters are mage-like with more CC and support, but also have pets."
lotro,2wi0dy,Darchseraph,3,Fri Feb 20 15:46:30 2015 UTC,"Well RuneKeeper would be your traditional ""mage"" class being very squishy ranged magic DPS. However especially at earlier levels (which is the experience that matters for new players), Minstrels have RKs beat hands down due to being more mobile while doing more damage. The description of the Minstrel as a healing class is a little outdated. It certainly is a primary healer along with RK but it has no problem keeping up with RK in the damage/nuke department.  Lore Masters are the ""pet"" magic class with a summonable companion and are generally quite strong (You get the ranged pet at level 20 and it becomes awesome afterwards) due to their powerful Daze (or Mez if you prefer) and stun abilities. Their personal damage isn't great so Blue line is good for pet damage.  I would recommend Minstrel > Lore Master > Runekeeper for a new player just for ease of use purposes. RK does get better but the early levels are crap."

Gambit chains are insane and coupled with use of masteries you'll be quite formidable in whatever role you choose in a group.
lotro,2wi0dy,amansgottado,5,Fri Feb 20 14:52:18 2015 UTC,Leaching gambits + avoidence = Full Fellowship

lotro,2wi0dy,Big_Daddy_Dingo,5,Fri Feb 20 22:50:48 2015 UTC,"If your just starting up, a Warden is one hard class to play off the bat. It arguably has the highest learning curve of any of the classes and its difficulty may just ruin your first impressions of LOTRO. Which I would not want you to experience. If starting out I would recommend the Hunter or the Champ class. As they are both relatively easy to play and by completing content in the game will give you a feel for how LOTRO is meant to be played.   Also I would recommend finding a Kinship to assist you. It makes life alot easier when your surrounded by good people and will assist is reducing player burnout. I am in Roxxi Manor and we are always accepting new people and helping them out as much as they need.  All the best in LOTRO and Welcome to Brandywine.  EDIT - My first class 7 long years ago was the hunter. Loved every minute of it."
lotro,2wi0dy,mdtexeira,2,Fri Feb 20 04:24:06 2015 UTC,"If this is your first class, I honestly recommend you try out a minstrel to begin with.  They have fewer abilities that depend on charges as compared to champion and hunter, have amazing range, and don't have to stand still to deal damage.  I consider them to be the easiest starting class.    Wardens are awesome, but will require a lot of practice.  An eidetic memory would also be a boon.  Did Warden's end up going f2p?  When I started my warden, even VIPs had to buy them with TP.  P.s. shameless plug...if you're F2P, check out my guide and give me some feedback.  Welcome to LOTRO!!"
lotro,2wi0dy,epicman107,1 point,Fri Feb 20 16:42:10 2015 UTC,Have you confirmed 100% that you will be rolling warden? It is a pretty complex class and you should probably watch some gameplay of the class so you know what you are getting yourself into.

lotro,2wi0dy,Dod4r,1 point,Fri Feb 20 02:37:51 2015 UTC,"Well warden is mainly a tank class that can do some great dps through bleeds so it may not be the best choice, and this forum post has some videos of wardens soloing things."
lotro,2wi0dy,epicman107,2,Fri Feb 20 04:42:16 2015 UTC,"Warden currently has the highest aoe and ST dps in the game. So calling it a tank class is not necessarily true. Originally it was, yes. But since HD it is as much a dps class as a hunter or burglar."

We all poured our hearts out into our games through many long, sleepless nights. LotRO was no exception and it was the game that drew me to the company to begin with. I'm so glad that people are still enjoying it after so many years. It honestly is a work of love.  It holds a special place in my heart and as soon as that opening theme begins to play, I feel myself drawn back into Middle Earth.  Keep playing. Keep exploring. There is so much adventure. Journey far but take time to appreciate all the details in the beautiful world that was lovingly created for you.  Oh, and tell your friends :)  And thanks; you made my day.  Edit: and, to be clear, I'm no longer at Turbine, so I have no vested interest in the company. I just love LotRO and I'm glad others do as well :D"
lotro,2wd5ad,DerpMcStuffins,2,Thu Feb 19 07:14:55 2015 UTC,"Oh wow! Thank you for helping create such an immersive game.   May I ask what parts of the game did you contribute to? Do you mind sharing a story of one of those late night work sessions?  I'm always fascinated with ""making-of"" type stuff.   Do you have any tips for sharing this game with friends? So many of my friends are wow fan boys that dont play any mmo at the moment. They are immediately hesitant about playing the game. I, as I mentioned in my post above, was the same way at one time.   Again, thank you for such an amazing game/experience."
lotro,2wd5ad,DerpMcStuffins,5,Thu Feb 19 07:20:25 2015 UTC,"Without getting too detailed :) I worked on one of the systems that we refer to as a 'platform'. It consisted of a large number of components that are shared between games at the studio (LotRO, DDO, AC, etc.). It's less of a ""game-y"" type of role, but nevertheless is necessary for games of massive scale to run and provide the players with the best experience as possible.  Because of that, I was on site for the launch of countless updates to all of the games. Some were obviously much larger than others and some were much more smooth than others :D  There was one particular launch in which we ran into some issues while validating the updates internally while the game was still dark to the public. The updates we made were absolutely MASSIVE. We had spent the better part of a year crunching HARD on this stuff and I remember being in the office from early morning until almost 10pm or later every night for the last couple months of this project (working through holidays and such... time off was pretty much nonexistent and dinner at home didn't happen). So, needless to say, the launch was quite complex. At one point during this launch, I was still at the office with a bunch of our team troubleshooting the issues and it was probably 4am... at that point my wife had lost all patience with the situation (God bless the spouses of game industry employees, haha!) and had, perhaps only somewhat jokingly, sent me a message saying that I must be cheating on her if I was still out after such a long few days. So, I took a picture of one of my good friends and coworkers who was looking rather disheveled; he had buried his head in his hoodie and was folded over his chair after he pretty much passed out at his desk next to me. I sent it to her as proof of who I was actually with. She got a kick out of that :) I still have that picture lying around somewhere... Even though it was a tremendous amount of work, we came together and got the release out.  For some bizarre reason, I still look back on times like those fondly... probably because, despite the work, we all loved what we were doing and were passionate about the product.  As far as sharing the game goes, I guess the best way is to just see if you can get people to give it an honest try, especially if they're at all fans of Tolkien. I think some people can dismiss it too quickly. I find that it's very accessible to newbies and plays very well either solo or with groups. Once they try it, they might be pleasantly surprised :D  Thanks again for the comments and here's hoping we can all enjoy the game for many more years! :)"
lotro,2wd5ad,dr_amy_bishop,2,Thu Feb 19 17:49:48 2015 UTC,LOTRO is the only MMORPG I've played that I've actually liked.

My fist experience with a guild (in WoW): ""something something we raid every friday and saturday. those who miss two weeks in a row will be kicked. If you want a life, find another guild. You think it's cruel? Get over it, I'm not your mummy.""  Compared to that, LoTRO is waaaaaaaay above any other game. It has the nicest and most helpful community by and large."

lotro,2wd5ad,UltimasXaero,6,Thu Feb 19 04:20:04 2015 UTC,"As a long term Tolkien fan, I've always looked over this game for reasons I can't remember. I think it's because I had so much invested in other games, playing another mmo seemed so tedious. I feel like I've cheated myself. This game feels like the gaming community's best kept secret.   I was in the exact same boat. Played a lot of MMOs, as well, and you always have this notion that they probably didn't do the lore justice or were just trying to cash in on the movie hype. But Turbine put a crazy amount of detail in LotRO. I mean, to the point where we've been having literature professors doing Tolkien lectures in-game. (Coursera and the Tolkien Professor)  The community also helps in a big way."
lotro,2wd5ad,UltimasXaero,2,Thu Feb 19 00:51:51 2015 UTC,"If you feel like you are leveling too fast, don't worry. There is much more content than any character can do on level without using the XP freeze. If you ever feel like you are getting a little bored with your toon's mechanics, you can roll an alt and you can experience a lot of different content. Or you can be completionist and go back to areas you missed to finish the regional deeds.   As a Tolkien fan, you should enjoy the next bit of the epic quest line. It will take you the rest of Eriador that doesn't play as big of a role in the LotR, and there are some interesting storylines developed. And Moria is pretty epic."

lotro,2wdobh,Whitesymphonia,4,Thu Feb 19 06:50:54 2015 UTC,"As Whitesymphonia says...  Get the quad pack when its on sale.  I've read that it can go down to as low as 5 dollars (though I'd grab it at 20 or less).  With Evendim from the Steely Dawn starter pack and the expansions, you can get to end game without anything else.  In the process of doing so, you'll acquire enough Turbine Points to buy most of the quest packs that you're interested in.    If you want variety, you can specifically buy packs in such an order that a second character can take a mostly different route to the end game (still making use of expansions).  The TP you gain on this second character can then be used to help a third character reach end-game using different content.  tl;dr - the expansions are what really matter and you'll get enough TP in normal play to get a quest pack or two when they go on sale"
lotro,2wdobh,mdtexeira,2,Thu Feb 19 17:31:43 2015 UTC,"$5 is really rare, get it when $20. Hell, if you'''re already up to Moria, and really want to start $40 is still good for what you're getting. It's the only thing I got, and steely dawn which I got for free. My main is 65 right now, and I've got almost 2k TP, even after buying forochel unnecessarily. I do have a few other low level toons, but I haven't really done a lot of deed grinding imo.  Point is, you'll get lots of TP just playing through. I'm saving for helms deep, but if you wanted to buy it with real money, the TP is more than enough to get whatever packs you want, thus unlocking more opportunities for TP.  I'm expecting to have enough TP for helms deep when I get there, probably not retail price, but when it's on sale. After that, you've pretty much got the game unlocked for other characters to run through.  Quad pack really is the only thing you need.  Get riding skill from a starter giveaway and steely dawn might be able to be found for cheap somewhere. Tremorgames gives it for pretty cheap if you don't mind spending maybe 30 minutes doing a couple surveys."

I personally prefer Forochel."

lotro,2w5bw8,elrohir_ancalin,5,Tue Feb 17 14:34:07 2015 UTC,"North Downs starts about the same level as Lone Lands, but it extends a good way more. It would feel a little wastey for your current char, but it is a good option if you run a second toon and don't want to repeat yourself.  Evendim is the most beautiful area in lotro. It covers pretty much the range 30-40. And it has a good solo/group balance.  Trollshaws covers the range 33-40. It is a mixed-feelings area. If anything, it really represents the ""wilderness"" well. Its solo is challenging and I love the idea of having the hub in Rivendel for a while. But it interweaves solo and group quests along all chains, making you stall often for lack of a group.  Forochel starts around 44 and it has continuity with Evendim. It is a very beautiful landscape and its different structure makes it a nice change. The only problem is you might struggle with the first couple of quests if you arrive at 40 when they are still red.  Misty Mountains, and specially Angmar, span from 44 to 50 and lore-wise are very appealing places to visit. Like Trollshaws, the problem is they are wild areas where solo is sometimes frustrating and group content pops up everywhere changing your advancement pace.  At 45, you have to go to Eregion and get your first LI in the epic. The area itself starts at 48 but everyone recommends doing that epic ASAP. Beautiful landscape and lore, pretty good group/solo balance. One of my favourite areas.  My guess is the cheapest/shortest path is Evendim(30-40)-Forochel(40-45)-Eregion(45-50)-Moria, with the challenge of always doing quests above your level, and the sad detail of quitting areas witout seeing the end of the storyline there. Personally, I took my time and hung around everywhere on-level for a little bit. Depends if you want to get to endgame or enjoy the view along the ride."
lotro,2w5bw8,Louey7,4,Tue Feb 17 10:01:58 2015 UTC,"I'd highly suggest Evendim, Angmar, and Eregion.  Evendim should easily get you 40, if not more. Even more assuming you finish out deeds and quests, too, for your TP. Even if not, at least 40.  Angmar starts at level 40, unlike Forochel. Both can be difficult and feel spaced out, but I prefer Angmar. It will definitely be enough to get you to Eregion solo. The main problem with this zone is random, easily skippable, fellowship quests. There are some difficult quests other than those, but should be able to solo on any class. Angmar also goes a long way with many chains. If you finish out each quest hub as much as you can do without fellowships, and even if you do deeds, you can get 45 easily in this zone.  45 is the point you want to try to get your Legendary Item (LI) with Eregion, Walls of Moria, and all that stuff. I highly suggest getting Eregion once you are high enough level that you think you can quest there and do your LI chain. The earlier, 45, the better, but it can wait to 46. Angmar should be enough to get 46 (again with deeds)."
lotro,2w5bw8,cazama1,5,Tue Feb 17 13:11:32 2015 UTC,"There are a couple options to spend actual money on quests packs instead of TP, which I preferred.  The Steely Dawn starter pack from Steam and the Mithril Edition from Gamestop.  For the Steely Dawn, you don't need to have the game installed through Steam, you will get a code that you still need to enter into myaccount.turbine.com.  (I'm not sure if you need to have the Steam client to get the code though, you'll have to look into that).  It contains Evendim and some other bonuses (such as TPs).   Mithril Edition contains Trollshaws, Eregion, Moria quest pack, and Lothlorien, along with 2000 TP and some other bonuses.  For $20 it is a great deal, it even goes on sale for $10, and has been as low as $5 before.."

If you're on Gladden I'd be happy to run some skirmishes with you to practice (although I've just been back for a few months so I don't have anyone at that level yet).   As great as soloing is in this game, I find group content to be even better, so it's worth it to try it even if you find it confusing or overwhelming at first. Just don't be afraid to ask the group leader, ""What should I do?"" Most likely they won't mind and would rather have you following directions anyway."

On Arkenstone the players are pretty friendly, but they expect you have some idea of what to do in an instance. One of the easiest ways to get that is to find a kin so that you can build up some friends that know you, know what your have or have not done and will instruct you in how instances go. There is not a huge amount of general information to learn, but there is some things you need to stay alive and play your class to the best.  These can be as simple as assuring your virtues are set to help keep you alive and making sure your not always out of power in long fights or can hold aggro if your the tank. There are also instance specific information that the fellowship leader should tell you if your new to the instance. I truly believe that a good helpful kin can be a great way to get into group content, just look at the kin first to assure they are doing what you want. Don't expect them to hold your hand thru the content, but make sure they are willing to help you learn what you need to know."

lotro,2vyvgy,fadhero,1 point,Mon Feb 16 14:13:45 2015 UTC,"Which class are you? Each class has skills that complement group play. Generally speaking, each class can be a tank (taking damage), DPS (dealing damage), healing, or support. For example, Champions are great for DPS (yellow line AoE). However, depending on the makeup of your group, you may need to switch to another trait line if the group is unbalanced to fill a need. For example, if a group has no Guardian or Captain, the Champ may need to go blue line traits to serve as a tank. Learn your trait lines and how they affect the rest of the group.  Start by trying some three-man instances (Garth Agarwen or some of the In Their Absence quests) to get used to the group dynamic. You can also join groups doing where you will be significantly over-level so that you can get some practice serving in different roles in the group. For a level 75+ player, there should be lots of opportunities to do Great Barrows (Maza, Thadur, or Sambrog) or Moria instances where you are well over the required level to learn your role.   As you get more comfortable playing a role, increase the difficulty level until you are running group content at your toon's level."

The item level is the level required to equip the item.  This differs to the LI's item level, which is the level determined by how much legendary item experience you've earned. This is by default 60, but can be increased to 70 using the scrolls purchased from the skirmish camp - I have a feeling this is what you've done.   There is no relation between the equip level and the maximum item level - Even a level 100 LI will have an item level of maximum 60 or 70."

lotro,2vyvcu,Aragornsbrokentoe,6,Sun Feb 15 13:17:14 2015 UTC,"Hi and welcome to LotRO! It depends on what is your personal definition of 'worth it' for an MMO quest pack really. If you like to engorge yourself with the well-written quests of LotRO, my answer would be Yes, it is worth it.    But if what you're aiming is to level up, IMO the best quest packs for that is Evendim (to continue right after you finished the Lone Lands), and then followed by Forochel."
lotro,2vyvcu,ray_falkner,4,Sun Feb 15 13:53:10 2015 UTC,"Personally its not just about levelling up for me, I really enjoy the quests that the game has to offer, I have just arrived in Bree and really digging the story quests as well as the side quests. Would playing every quest pact with the one character cause any issues? apart from taking awhile :)"
lotro,2vyvcu,notwhoithink,4,Sun Feb 15 14:41:08 2015 UTC,"The problem with playing all quest packs on the same character is that you will completely many zones before you get to them. There's just so much content, there's no way to avoid over-leveling to the point where you can one-shot the mobs, get no xp for finishing the quests, and the rewards end up being vendor trash.  Well...there is if you but a Stone of the Tortoise. You can use it to prevent your character from gaining xp, and thereby stay at the right level range for quests in each zone. Just keep in mind that some zones have a wide level range, like 40-50. You can lock yourself at 40 and maybe do up to level 43-44 quests before you'll have to level up to have a chance of completing them. But then other zones (Forochel and Misty Mountains) cover a similar range. So it would be a case of doing the first part of one zone, then the first part of another, then the first part of a third, then back to the first zone to do the middle levels, etc. That gets cumbersome quickly, IMO. You're better off just taking three or four alts through the game and choosing different zones for each."
lotro,2vyvcu,byzantinebobby,3,Sun Feb 15 14:55:33 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. See everything at least once. HOWEVER, it is probably best to do everything across multiple characters. Some packs lead into others. Evendim leads right into Forochel. North Downs leads into Angmar. Trollshaws leads into Misty Mountains. Each route is designed to take you to level 50 where you go through Moria. After Moria you can go into Lothlorien and Mirkwood then the Great River to Rohan or Edenwaith into Isengard over to Rohan.   As you can see there's multiple paths. You can bounce around if you want, but it flows better if you don't. Also, some paths get thin in certain level ranges. Crafting, skirmishes, and instances can fill in gaps. Then there's the Epic Quest line which should be done at least once just to experience it but might not need to be repeated because it's a long story."

I read through the whole TP running guide out of curiosity, thinking to compare your way with how it used to be, where you could just use rep items farmed by a main to kinder a bunch of factions on a new alt, which is now impossible due to the recent minimum level requirements on the rep items.  Here's my concern: your guide will be slightly tricky for new players to follow, because they don't know the map very intimately like you do, and they will have a hard time knowing which way to go at a number of steps.  Even I couldn't quite imagine it all, because I don't remember all the names.  How to make it easier?   In your text, when you say ""head towards <place>"", add directions, like ""head NW towards <place>"".  This won't always be necessary, but there are quite a few spots in your text, where you essentially tell people to head in a certain direction by name, but adding the direction by compass would take any question out of it. A map with numbers on it, in sequence with your instructions, so people can see where they should expect to be at each step.  This might be immensely easier to visualize for new players, in a way that is easier than going back to read step by step.  The numbers might even be connected by lines to indicate the path to follow.  But what numbers? Wile your writing in paragraphs is nice to read, it would be useful to break it into numbered points, for people trying to follow step by step, and having a hard time keeping their place.  Much easier to look back and go ""Oh yeah, I'm near step 20"", and scan quickly down to step 20 in the guide.  And those numbers are easily put on the map.  I'm not suggesting you have to re-write in order to do this, and you could even just insert the numbers into your text at the beginning of appropriate sentences, so as not to break up your existing paragraph structure (just make them stand out, BIG RED NUMBERS or something to make them easy to spot at a glance).

Lots of things make it a little faster or slower, like knowing how far you can fall without getting the injury debuff.

lotro,2vwgk3,stigochris,3,Sat Feb 14 22:21:39 2015 UTC,"What you need is layers. You need to uh, 'acquire', a copy of Photoshop. Then you take your screenshot and open it up in PS. You need to create a new layer, basically another image on top of the screenshot, only this new layer is clear until you start drawing on it. When you do start drawing, you can adjust the opacity of the drawing so that you can see the map through the arrows and lines. You can use the airbrush tool to paint 'zones' and the text tool to label them, or create a legend. You can use the layer/free transform tool to scale and rotate text; text is it's own layer in PS. You can move individual layers in the layers menu, so you can create some text and then place it exactly where you'd like it. I'd suggest turning the grid on. You can collapse all the layers into a single one when you're done through the layer menu, or you can save a .psd copy and a .jpeg copy so you can go back and edit layers later and still post it to sharing sites.   How layers work in PS is fairly obvious, there is a pane in the bottom right corner that lists all the layers and has buttons to create, delete, or copy layers. Up above that a little bit is an opacity slider and a few options for the type of overlay you want it to be, but you shouldn't really need anything other than the opacity slider.   To draw clean arrows you can use the line tool or, alternatively you can use the pen tool to create a line with many points so that you do not need to freehand draw it.

lotro,2vvd14,dr0idx,3,Sat Feb 14 16:46:52 2015 UTC,"Aside from what others have said, I would like to add that LOTRO isn't about ""where are the most players"" imo. (Brandywine takes the cake there). But keep an eye on where the community is at, are you into RP? If so you will have a much better time on a server like Landroval because the community will seem much more open and vibrant to like-minded people. On the other hand, if you are wanting to level up with people who are also just getting started, servers like Gladden (which is the recommended server currently) will be more active towards the beginning levels. LOTRO takes a whole different mentality than, for example, WoW. For me personally, my enjoyment of the game comes from the smaller, family-esque feel that some of the servers offer."

Though it's nice to get a big hit with 0 fervor"
lotro,2vnbl7,cazama1,3,Thu Feb 12 18:35:55 2015 UTC,"I have not found an updated build guide, but the same principles usually apply.    You will see how u/legofreak11 and u/Ultrastorm1 have very similar red line trait trees, and are almost maxed (sans ferocious strikes).  Since you asked about servers the other day, I'm going to guess you are new to the game.  Traits look quite different at lower levels.  Brutal strikes for instance is very useful as it is good attack and you can get it right away.  Later, though, it just costs too much fervor for the other skills you have.  I have found Second Wind in blue line is almost necessity the more I level.  Low-mid level I did not have much issue  with power use though.    I switch between red and yellow line, depending on the situation and what seems like is working faster.    Champ survivability is great basically because you kill stuff faster than it can kill you.  Blue line is fun to run if you want to try and solo some bigger bosses, you really need a good amount of trait points to spend in it to be really effective, IMO.  Lower levels I say just focus on might and vitality/morale, that will help you the most.  At least until you get the hang of how other stats work, and there is not much gear to choose from at lower levels.  Slot traits that have those as well.  Eventually you will probably want to get more resistance and mitigations (these are basically your defense).  Fate is nice because it helps with crit rating, or straight up crit rating boosters are even better.  Champs rely a fair bit on getting critical hits (some buffs are applied w/ critical hits).  Check out the forums, too.  This recent thread has had some good posts for beginners.  Can post more specific questions here, too :)  edit: grammer grammar  edit: spelling"

lotro,2vl401,MilesChristiSum,6,Wed Feb 11 22:27:09 2015 UTC,"Beorning isn't a bad choice if you gave up Warden. The Beorning is a more solo-oriented version of the Captain and considerably less polished(towards the end-game)  Although Warden is the best option for solo play, as you're basically a small fellowship by yourself.  Edit: Beorning is fun though, don't get me wrong."
lotro,2vl401,GloriousMediaMakers,4,Wed Feb 11 22:47:14 2015 UTC,"Captains, while still having group buffs are pretty viable solo characters now. They changed up the on-defeat skills a bit and the new feat trees make it conducive to solo play IMO. For solo I would always spec any class their heal / survivability spec.  Beornings, overpowered as shit. Very fun to play, very rewarding to master. If you roll a beorning I would suggest speccing into the Yellow trait line, The Roar. You get insane survivability through heals and cc, while still doing relatively good damage. Very early on you will get access to an AoE fear that will do wonders. I regularly engnage 5+ elite monsters with no thought and come out unscathed on the other side. Speaking from personal experience, my beorning solos 6 man instances that are on level. Was able to Solo Great Barrows, Garth Agarwen, and Fornost so far. In yellow line you get access to a heal that is basically a full heal every 3 seconds WITH the added benefit of a huge HoT that will full heal you again over 15 seconds. Coupled with Hearthen, the other main heal, you can sustain through quite a bit of punishment.  Burglars (and for the same reasons lore-master) are strong contenders in solo due to their CC abilities. Both are fun classes, both are viable in all aspects. Just depends if you like stealth / pet classes really.  Champions are still AoE gods, I haven't played one since SoA so I can't comment too much on them.  Wardens are still great classes, although slightly nerfed from their release days so I've heard. I leveled one a while ago and the gambit system becomes easier the more you use it. There are a set few gambits that you will -actually- need to know, depending on spec. It's easy to get the muscle memory if you keep your gambit skills on 1-2-3-4 then its just getting into a sequence of rhythm. You stop thinking sheild-spear-fist-gambituse-spear-shield-gambituse and just into a rotation that you use every fight (like any other class pushing numbers in their rotation). Start out with defense gambits, move into offense gambits, maybe life steal etc. If you like the overall feel and aesthetic of the class maybe give the warden another chance and limit yourself to the gambits you know. You dont have to know them all to be effective."
lotro,2vl401,cerberus_402,5,Wed Feb 11 22:47:55 2015 UTC,"Something that I forgot to mention about beornings, Wrath. The change of resource is a great boon to this class that not a lot of people mention.  Wrath lets you continually spam skills and never run out of resource like a class with power will eventually run out. Beorning is very conducive to solo play for this reason, as soloing bosses is a drawn out process, beorning will always have resource available to heal, cc, and dps non-stop. Just something to keep in mind.   There are also quite a few debuffs that will drain a classes power (some with a lengthy 10s stun at the end). These debuffs have no affect on a beorning. Where a class like warden could run out of power and end up dead due to not being able to cycle defensive gambits."

lotro,2vl401,YasianMaster,2,Thu Feb 12 03:15:36 2015 UTC,"I know the masteries may be discouraging to play a warden it really is the best class to play if you plan on soloing most content.

lotro,2vl401,epicman107,2,Thu Feb 12 02:39:54 2015 UTC,"I've never played a Beorning, but of the classes that you listed the Champion is probably the least frustrating solo class.

lotro,2vl401,Whmagill,1 point,Fri Feb 13 00:26:05 2015 UTC,"Guardian is awesome fun. I just came back to the game about a month ago and just hit 50 on my new guardian. It may have started off slow but I'm not sure since it was my first class coming back to the game after a long while so I had nothing to really compare it to. I was straight red line until fairly recently and it was working well enough, but I switched to yellow line for Goblin Town and my word I can't go back.  Once you have enough trait points to invest 20 in the yellow line, you get Flash of Light. The skill granted to you when you go yellow lets you mark a target. With flash of light, you do extra damage to nearby enemies when you hit a marked target. Also, one of the first traits you can take in yellow line spreads your debuffs to additional targets when you hit AoE skills.  Basically, when you reach this point as a yellow line guardian, you are stronger and kill faster when you fight more enemies. Single target DPS definitely falls back, but just pull 5 things at once and laugh as you destroy them all down. Then hit Ignore the Pain and clear 4 debuffs from yourself, another yellow line bonus.  It's awesome fun the self heals guardians get help a great deal with survivability. I think red line is better for this later on, but right now I can't switch from yellow and I can't wait to pull everything in Moria and kill it all."
lotro,2vjjoq,mruq,3,Wed Feb 11 15:25:27 2015 UTC,"I am a red line myself mostly red, little blue and yellow mix. It honestly depends on what you do the most. You can always play around with it on the second trait area. I use the defense stance so that I get a heal from quick shot. I would add points to the barbed fury if you group a lot and take down strong enemies. Rapid fire might also help. You really can't have movement and dps, it is one or the other. Also check what you have equipped. You need to have as much agility and vitality as possible. Some deeds and quest give more points so you can add more spread out.  If you can earn up to draw weight, I would save up for that. I don't know if you could though. I just prefer to stand and shoot. Strength stance could help with a little more dps."

Depending various factors (RNG, Crits etc..) it took me usually around 10 to 15min to kill 20 wargs and 8 Guards (forget the meat quest, there are only 4 there before the 1st boss and killing him takes too much time, you should spend said time doing another new fresh WP run instead).  I´m a guardian, so ... poorly geared and what not and few times even below my level i was having hard time against 2 or 3 wargs at the same time, due one of them usually fearing you every now and then (dominant warg i think).  Based on this and my general experience doing it few times, do WP and kill 20 wargs few times and if you can 8 guards as well. Don´t forget to buy / use some EXP-Boost... from getting 150k XP you can make 300K per run...  It does not take much to level up doing WP.

Sword halls takes us 3-4 min and only gives us 87k exp (1 quest completed). The thing that sucks though is that you can only do 10 instances an hour.

lotro,2vheyg,hueresiech,1 point,Sun Feb 15 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"All of my toons have 6x bundled 100% boosts (5 from Steely Dawn, 1 from that MMOgames giveaway). I've found a couple from Lootboxes but since I'm still low level I will probably just sell them as in game gold is more valuable to me right now than fast exp.  Also all of my toons are already level 20+ and most are ready for LL and ND. By the time I get my first one to 100, I expect my lowest will be somewhere in the 30s-40s so it's more of a ""how do I accelerate midgame"" kind of question."
lotro,2vheyg,Dod4r,2,Wed Feb 11 03:37:35 2015 UTC,"Since you have limited boosts and no access to a level 100 on an alternative account, I'd suggest using the boosts while doing regular quests.  Go to an area, complete as many quests as you can, then pop the tome and hand them all in.  I would suggest doing this in evendim (finish northcotton farm and the glassblowers camp), then when you reach the camp on the stone bridge (3rd camp), do the quests there, do the quests in tinnudir, ost forod, etc. (you can find all quests on the wikipedia). Pop the xp boost, hand them in and then continue questing while the boost lasts.  Another area to boost that I would recommend is west-angmar. Evendim will help you in your 30's, angmar in your late 30's, early 40s.   I would not boost in eregion, just get level 50 and then enter moria. Moria will get you close to 60, at which point you can go to enedwaith, you could pop a boost here. After enedwaith you'll be 65 and from that point you will need to do most of the quests anyway, since the later expansions are so linear."

lotro,2v9o4l,Vestus65,7,Mon Feb 9 04:40:11 2015 UTC,"I have a legendary bow that I crafted myself, back when I last played. The bow is still only 56/60 and it still seems fine at level 68. How long can I expect to use it? I know there's a store item I can buy that will add ten levels to it, is that something I should do to extend its lifespan?   The Scroll of Delving adds 10 more levels of growth to your LI, but I wouldn't buy it from the store.  If you're going to buy it then get it from a Legenary Trader at the skirmish camps, it won't cost TPs.  ""Level"" as it pertains to LIs is sometimes confusing.  There are two important levels.  The first is the level of the item, which in this case is 56 (a max of 60 without using a scroll to boost it to 70).  That just keeps track of the progression of the LI's experience.  The other level is the level required to equip it, which is what most people refer to.  Usually you find them equippable are certain increments, like L52, L58, L60, L65, and so on up to the various level caps that have been released over time.  Unless you are using to Stone of the Tortoise to stop your toons from leveling, there's really no point to use crafted/2nd age/1st age LIs until you get to the level cap.  They 1st/2nd agers take more IXP to advance the levels, and they can be quickly outperformed by higher level LIs.  I don't know the exact numbering, but I believe that something like an L58 3rd age will do more damage (or at least equal damage) to an L55 2nd age.  As far as leveling multiple items, I usually slot my primary weapon and the secondary LI (rune-keeper satchel, champion symbol, etc) and then fill the remaining LI slots with ""junk"" items of a similar level.  When those LIs hit L31 or so I deconstruct them for relics and IXP runes.  At the lower levels I may only take them to L21 because there are so many LIs available in Moria, especially for bartering Rusty Dwarf Tools, etc.  As you level up the LIs will come primarily through mob drops, so finding the right kind of LI is slightly more difficult.  Once I got above 75 I started leveling them all to 60 before deconstructing because I had trouble finding enough LIs to keep my slots filled.  One other thing...when you deconstruct an LI you get to choose one of the legacies to remove from the item in the form of a scroll.  That scroll can then be used to put that legacy on a different LI, so you can build your ideal LI.  Those scrolls are limited by level, so you cannot take a legacy from an L55 Hunter's Bow and put it on an L95 Hunter's Bow.  I used to have a huge stockpile of legacies that I ended up tossing when this happened.  This is also another reason why you probably want to stick to leveling LIs for deconstruction that are relatively close to the level of the LI that you are using.  Finally, on slotting relics.  I slot relics all along.  I think that they add some nice bonuses, in addition to the legacies, and it's no trouble to remove the relics when you're done.  You can get Relic Removal Scrolls from the store and since I'm a subscriber then they cost doesn't bother me."
lotro,2v9o4l,notwhoithink,2,Mon Feb 9 13:04:13 2015 UTC,"Wow...thank you all for the helpful comments. I guess that's what I get for skipping a few expansions. :) Here is a screenshot of my current bow. Remember I crafted this back when 65 was the level cap. So I did slot it with relics. I didn't raid, so this was about as good as I was going to get at the time.  So a couple of other questions now: it seems like the thing to do now, at character level 68, is to switch to a 3rd Age weapon as soon as I get one that's an upgrade, and just use those till I get to 100? Since I won't be stopping at any of the ""old"" level caps for any length of time.  My current bow is now 58/60, should I take it to 60 and then...what? Seems like anything I get from deconning it now will not do me any good when I get to level 100. I think I'd like to just put it in my bank, since I made it myself and it took a hell of long time, back in the day. What do you suggest?  I've been checking the damage and stats on quest rewards in Dunland, just to make sure my bow is still ahead of the curve, and so far it has been. I assumed as I got closer to level 70 or 75 I'd be replacing it.   Lastly - all of the ""junk"" LI's I have been leveling are still from Moria/Mirkwood. They're items I had slotted back when I stopped playing. Should I decon them and switch them out for newer drops? I'm pretty sure they are level 58 items, I just put whatever I got at the time. Maybe I should dust them, use whatever I get to max my crafted bow, then give it an honorable retirement? :) Thanks again to everyone for the help."
lotro,2v9o4l,Cyrilion,4,Mon Feb 9 14:48:05 2015 UTC,"It may be a little early to switch out your bow yet, if you're level 68 and running with that 2nd-ager. Especially if you still feel it's up to the task.  Replacing with a 3rd-ager at level 68 would only just about make you even and a new weapon would still be behind your current one on relics and damage type scroll.   Every five levels make for a much better levelling experience, in my opinion. (But if you're that attached to it and it doesn't feel like a hindrance, it could probably be stretched to 75)  Comparing to quest rewards, has me a little puzzled, though. If you're comparing non-legendary weapons with your bow, stop that. Those quest rewards were not really meant to be used by a class that has access to legendary equivalents. If they're bows/crossbows, they're meant for guardians and champions.  As for the junk items, it depends what you really want to work on collecting. If you're looking for legacy replacement scrolls for a future weapon, get rid of those now and find something level 65+. On the other hand, if you're trying to stockpile relics, let them get to level 60 first (more relics per 10 levels and the levels after 30 requires less xp)."
lotro,2v9o4l,notwhoithink,2,Mon Feb 9 15:42:54 2015 UTC,"The bow you have is certainly good enough for an L68 Hunter, but you will quickly be discovering better options.   So a couple of other questions now: it seems like the thing to do now, at character level 68, is to switch to a 3rd Age weapon as soon as I get one that's an upgrade, and just use those till I get to 100? Since I won't be stopping at any of the ""old"" level caps for any length of time.   I'd try to find some L68-L70 3rd age bows and put enough IXP into them to max out their DPS legacy.  By L70 for sure you should be able to find one that does more damage that your L65 2nd Ager.  Then just keep leapfrogging every 5 levels or so.   My current bow is now 58/60, should I take it to 60 and then...what?   Take it to L60 and then when you have found a 3rd ager to replace it, deconstruct it.   Seems like anything I get from deconning it now will not do me any good when I get to level 100.   Well, you will get an IXP rune worth anywhere between 700,000 and 1,000,000 IXP points, so that's kinda handy to have for the next LI.  You'll also get a half-dozen or more Tier 4-6 relics, which is also useful.   I think I'd like to just put it in my bank, since I made it myself and it took a hell of long time, back in the day.   If you're into keepsakes then by all means.  I used to do that with certain weapons that I made but I always found myself hurting for storage, so I'd sell them.  With LIs you obviously can get quite a lot of benefit from deconstructing them though.   I've been checking the damage and stats on quest rewards in Dunland, just to make sure my bow is still ahead of the curve, and so far it has been. I assumed as I got closer to level 70 or 75 I'd be replacing it.    But those are normal weapons, LIs are a fair bit more powerful.   Lastly - all of the ""junk"" LI's I have been leveling are still from Moria/Mirkwood. They're items I had slotted back when I stopped playing. Should I decon them and switch them out for newer drops?    You can still level junk LIs for decon, you'll still get perfectly usable IXP runes and relics for them.  It's the legacy scrolls that you will outgrow.  Since the maximum return when deconstructing for relics is at multiples of 10+1 (i.e., L11, L21, L31, etc) I'd take them to the nearest sweet spot, level-wise, and then deconstruct and replace them.  As a general rule though, I never decon an item until I have another item to replace it (even junk LIs), because otherwise you're missing out on gaining some IXP that will show up in a rune one day.  Also, when replacing my primary weapon LIs I never replace them until I have leveled the replacement item to the point where the DPS is maxxed out.  That way I know how much better DPS I am getting before I ditch that item that I worked so hard to level."
lotro,2v9o4l,Nahktilakh,2,Mon Feb 9 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"If you decon at L31, that means you get the sweet-spot of being able to choose from the maximum number of legacies that item will get."
lotro,2v9o4l,notwhoithink,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:00:37 2015 UTC,"But unless you are deconstructing at/near level cap, those legacies probably won't be helpful for long."
lotro,2v9o4l,Arathaert,6,Tue Feb 10 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"Basically the point of leveling up LIs is so that you can get the relics and shards off 'em to make the ""perfect"" LI at cap. It takes a hefty chunk of shards to make the right relics, and if you're anal about it, you'd want your legacies just so.  Other than that.... no point, really :P  I used to religiously decon LIs at 31, but then I got lazy and now I just decon at 60. You get a TON of LI xp and relics and stuff, so it's quite nice. And less to think about :P  No need to worry about slotting relics til cap, either... kind of a waste before then, since you usually tend to outlevel the weapons comparatively quickly. And no need to add levels to the weapon... even a 3rd age bow that's the next level above the one you're at will be more powerful than a 2nd age crafted bow.  So basically, just level up. Slot LIs and when they hit lvl 60, decon them, combine relics and get shards, and slot a new one.  At cap, you'll find some legacies you like, and you'll have a bunch of relics and shards you can customize your weapon with. Until then... don't worry :)"
lotro,2v9o4l,Kants_Pupil,4,Mon Feb 9 06:20:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I like deconning at 60 better anyway. The bigger XP runes mean that you are usually with 11-21 levels of capping the next item, the relics you get for waiting are nicer, and the wait to get really powerful relics becomes much shorter."
lotro,2v9o4l,Arathaert,2,Mon Feb 9 18:18:41 2015 UTC,Agreed 100%
lotro,2v9o4l,xKINGMOBx,2,Mon Feb 9 18:39:07 2015 UTC,"Agreed, with one caveat: might as well slot Tier 1 relics - so easy to come by and higher level relics give a weaker return on investment. A tier 2 relic is not double the bonus of a tier 1, it's an almost trivial increase, so I never slot better relics until hitting cap."

The question must be asked, because accidentally selling to a vendor is the most common, and known to work mechanism, and we must know with confidence that it can be ruled out.  You would have every bit as much sympathy from me even if it was your accident, but it is important to warn other players if there is anything we can do to prevent this ourselves.  Any way, that sucks hard.  And 100TP is a bloody insult to what that's worth, 2000 might have been realistic for the amount of grinding that takes, and how little time the player has to re-grind.  I'm still working on getting my first whole set for my main, the little I get to play in my busy life it's taking months, so losing a set would be really awful."
lotro,2v42cw,exploderator,3,Sun Feb 8 01:49:19 2015 UTC,It was slotted on my guard so it wasn't an accidental sell. I last logged in a couple weeks ago and it was all there so I was wondering if it was due to the recent update.
lotro,2v42cw,exploderator,3,Sun Feb 8 06:09:43 2015 UTC,Also I should point out the GM said there was no barter record of me ever purchasing anything with merits but if you do the math of the merits I have vs. the bb completed I would still be missing merits. So something is funky.
lotro,2v42cw,exploderator,2,Sun Feb 8 06:14:10 2015 UTC,"Damn.  Thanks for clarifying, and good catch adding up the discrepancy between your BB counts and your possessions, given the missing barter records.  The missing barter records are genuinely disturbing, because without them, the GM will truly have no inclination to give you the items, and they aren't going to dig around and really do the math like you, and they won't just take your word that easily.  Tinfoil hat time:  I wonder if the GM actually can't give you those items, some limit of the system, but they don't want to admit it, so they lie and say there's no barter records to prove it, and give you a 100TP nothing to shut you up.  Worse yet would be if they could, but just don't care enough to take the time and check, and so they lie and say no records.  Of all those options, I don't honestly know what the worst is, they are all very ugly in their own ways."

The GMs are likely your only option.  The only thing call in staff can act on is account issues and in-store purchases, because they have to, because it counts as money purchases, and they have to make absolutely sure they provide what they sold (legally).  If you want an excuse for asking again, you should ask a GM to verify the lack of barter records, so you can accurately and fully describe the bug.  It is serious if even the barter records are missing, or maybe the jewelry left because of that?  The devs need to know such details, for sure, and the GM might have an important suggestion of what you should say / what to call the missing records.  Then, while you have their attention, you could even suggest they compare with your BB counts (if they can), just to know for sure that something doesn't add up.  Finally, maybe that is when they actually bother to pay attention, and give you your stuff back?  It's not like you have no case to make here, those merits don't disappear on anything else.  Finally, it's sad, but I suspect your first round of GM attention would get brushed off kind of easily, they must get tired and leery of people begging or trying to scam free stuff.  But if you go in with the purpose of getting precise information for your bug report, it should be fully understandable to a GM, perhaps even appreciated.  You're asking their help to fix the game, not just for your stuff.  Tell them a professional programmer told you to ask again, so you could include the exact right name of those missing records, which seem important now that we have thought about it.  If that legitimacy gets you a few minutes with them, maybe you also luck out and get your goods back."
lotro,2v42cw,Arathaert,3,Sun Feb 8 07:06:30 2015 UTC,Well that's depressing. I was hoping that actually talking to someone on the phone would have helped but if they are there to deal with in game purchases it's probably a dead end.   That sounds like a good idea. I'll put in a ticket to request a lack of barter records for my bug ticket and see where that gets me. Hopefully I won't get blown off as easily.   Thank you for all your advice hopefully this gets me somewhere. I am pretty frustrated at the game right now.
lotro,2v42cw,exploderator,3,Sun Feb 8 13:35:25 2015 UTC,UPDATE  So I put in another ticket.  It only said to submit a bug ticket and there is nothing further they can do to assist.  ...  So it looks like im out of luck.  I will still call on Monday and see what can be accomplished over the phone.

lotro,2v2jjz,HolyGigi,5,Sat Feb 7 07:17:22 2015 UTC,"Excepting the lore, LOTRO is very similar to WOW.  Based on your #1, I'd suggest you try out GW2. The end game gear will never change (stats that is, that game is all about cosmetics)"
lotro,2v2jjz,HolyGigi,1 point,Sat Feb 7 10:20:06 2015 UTC,"GW2 wasn't my thing because it was very, very software with no progression. I'm looking for actual power gaps between players that have meaning. Not sure it actually exists anymore though :)"
lotro,2v2jjz,Dod4r,5,Sat Feb 7 12:04:42 2015 UTC,"The powergaps in GW2 are due to player skill level. The progression there is based on getting the best looking item.   Its kind of impossible to find a game that has no treadmill model, yet offer power gaps. If you want gaps, you need ""better"" loot than the other guy. At one point, everyone will get the best loot in the game, so the item resets (treadmill style) are the only way to bring back that difference."
lotro,2v2jjz,mdtexeira,4,Sat Feb 7 12:34:17 2015 UTC,"1: Does this game have a gear treadmill model / gear seasons? For example: Will a large patch / expansion phase out my current gear and make the last ""Seasons"" more readily available? This has generally been the case with the expansion focused development since launch. Gear right now is pretty easy to get. This year is going to be slightly different, with what will most likely be 2 major updates, neither of them having a level cap. Both will no doubt have new gear, but we can only guess whether progression will be horizontal or vertical.  2: Is there any form of alternate advancement? Not sure what you mean by this? You can get ranks in PVP. Similar to how you get levels in PvE.  3: Part of 1 & 2 but is there permanent character progression? Virtues, stat tomes & promotion points are permanent progression. Also, the legendary item system is being changed this year and they will level with us, so no more grinding out a new weapon with every expansion.  I'm kind of sick and tired of the WoW model and sadly every MMO on the market post WoW uses that same model. I'm an old school MMO player (EQ1, FFXI, EQOA, DAOC, AC1 & 2 etc.) and I much prefer that vs. a constant fast paced character power erosion. Some erosion is good, fast erosion is not for me.  The pace of the games expansions and gear grind is far far lower than that of WoW.  4: Is there group based leveling (think: camps) There's dungeons spread out through the game, most leveling is done solo though, with dungeons being a nice break. I would suggest rolling on a high population server, if you want to do dungeons while leveling."
lotro,2v2jjz,angbad,3,Sat Feb 7 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"I've never gotten high enough on a single toon to have great knowledge of this. You do get xp from crafting, but will take a while.  You can get all of the early levels from just grinding out crafting XP, however.   With the trait system, you do have developmental options as well as permanent bonuses to your build.  The caveat here is that you have to be VIP (for at least one month) to open up the full range of access to the virtue traits.   Not sure exactly what you mean, but it is entirely possible to level only with skirmishes.  These are variably paced instances where you mow through baddies in order to control territory.  The marks you get from skirms can also be cashed in for some of the better items, making skirms an attractive option for people uninterested in the lore.   All in all, you'll like this game A LOT MORE if you like LotR.  For many of us, the most enjoyable parts are the Epic quest lines, the lore-related instances, and just getting to walk and ride around in Middleearth.  If that appeals to you, DL the game and give it a shot."
lotro,2v2jjz,comicspolitics,3,Sat Feb 7 09:32:21 2015 UTC,Yeah this isn't the game for you.  It's very similar to all post wow mmo's.  Don't go for it unless you love LOTR

I'm a hunter, and I've never NOT gotten platinum on 2 man Pelagir, no matter who I've run it with.  Everything you mentioned sounds about right, except we've never worried so much about barricades, and you really don't need them in the last battle, although perhaps they help.  Winch: We use trip wires about the same as you describe.  I stand dead center, zoom way back so it's easy to turn left or right, and dump ranged damage on them.  The other person does whatever, doesn't seem to matter much.  Maybe tell the soldiers to heal or pick up the pace?  Next, run down, one builds ballista, then drops down rope to cut grappling hooks.  I think constantly cutting the hooks might be the real key here, it eliminates there ever being a huge flood of mobs, until briefly during the looters or backs-to-wall challenges, and I think the defenders are maybe safe/immune while challenges are on.  I think the defenders can take care of almost everything, as long as they aren't constantly flooded.  Meanwhile it only takes one person on a challenge, and one when a boss shows up.  Possible trick:  the boss comes out the same door as the bad guys in backs to the wall.  If you are ready for it, the person might cover backs to the wall while staying more in the middle, and help take down the boss super fast without any problems.  If you had 2 trip wires in a row, just towards the town people, by the door where the mobs come out, you would have a good slow down to help burn them before they ran out of range towards the town people.  On the last one, we build catapults first, get 2 or 3 shots, and then it's all easy.  Kill bosses as fast as possible, help out, cut hooks, etc..  So, I wish you luck, 2 man Pelagir is always one of the easy ones from what I have found."

I used to do it on a daily basis  I can understand if your minstrel dont have first ages and other maxed out kit.   Only times i had problem was when i got ""back to the wall quest"".

Some of Legolas's lines were getting lost during 'Sons of Leaf and Stone' and will now display properly.

You have to edit each value on purpose, there are no ghosts or gremlins to magically change stuff.  And that leads me to wonder, if they did ""bug"" it on purpose, then they would do that because they don't want 6-mans earning platinum, not for now.  It was already too hard, now it's impossible, they are blocking rewards they think will unbalance the economy, and the easiest thing to change is the morale on a couple of bosses, instead of a whole loot table.  Gives people hope and challenge that way too, even if it's simply ridiculous for most mere mortals who stand ZERO chance against bosses like that."

Hope this helps as I am just returning as well (from lvl 65 cap too though I have an RK not a guard) and am currently leveling a hunter to 65 before I most likely switch back to my RK :)  Cant get enough of healing on them for some reason"

lotro,2unb4u,JKtheSlacker,1 point,Tue Feb 3 18:43:20 2015 UTC,"That's fine if you have time to focus on running around killing things.  The training dummies have three redeeming qualities. One, you can stand in one place the whole time. Two, you'll never have to worry about some high-level running around one-shotting everything you're trying to find. Three, there are never enough of whatever you're trying to get a slayer deed on.   Don't get me wrong. I don't create characters just for TP purposes, but I do find it to be helpful to finish out several deeds on the training dummies before I completely outlevel them."
lotro,2unb4u,Whitesymphonia,2,Wed Feb 4 02:02:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but skills are limited per day. Can only get so many tallies for the skill each day.  You need to use an acclerator you start with. Ran 100tp in an hour. Probably can get more if I streamlined the process better. It's possible to plot an efficient path for time and travel back and forth between farming nodes while they respawn. Also the free accelerator helps with the more sparse spawning mobs."

lotro,2unb4u,JKtheSlacker,1 point,Tue Feb 3 22:00:44 2015 UTC,"Probably two hours to get to level 10, then about 20, 30 minutes a day working on deeds. I usually watch something on Netflix while I play.  If you trait Watcher of Resolve, you get an extra instant heal which you can alternate with Raise the Spirit to raise your healing deeds more quickly. Traiting Warrior-Skald will give you Concussive Shout, which gives you +30% crit chance on Piercing Cry, which will help with one of the deeds."

You just run through the areas and gain 150-200 tp in a matter of hours. He repeated this several times in a single day and managed to unlock a quest pack for his efforts."
lotro,2unb4u,porpoiseoflife,5,Tue Feb 3 20:55:31 2015 UTC,Elf-side is simpler. It's more streamlined in southern Ered Luin than it is coming out of Thorin's Hall.
lotro,2unb4u,mdtexeira,1 point,Tue Feb 3 21:47:02 2015 UTC,"Best is a dwarf for the racial deeds (dourhand and goblin), but starting with the Celondim quest line."
lotro,2unb4u,mdtexeira,1 point,Fri Feb 6 12:58:03 2015 UTC,"Like others have said, I recommend a minstrel for TP grinding.  You can go either hobbit or dwarf.  The benefit of these two races is the extra TP you'll get for completing the racial deeds.  If you don't have the Starter Pack, get it.  On every new character you start, you'll get a 90 minute slayer boost.  This, plus the 30 minute slayer boost you get in your gift pack, will speed up TP running considerably.  You also get a nice one hour XP boost which will level you sooner, meaning it will be easier to kill things sooner.  Also, the riding skill means that you don't have to limit yourself to trying to get it done within 24 hours (useful if your schedule doesn't allow for very long sessions).  Consider choosing a very low population server for TP running.  You'll have much less competition for slayer kills.  My personal route involves doing all the quests starting in Celondim until I finish with the Duillond quests, doing relevent slayers on the way.  Then I head back to Celondim and quickride to Thorin's Gate, taking time to hit the exploration points for the Dwarves.  Get to Gondamon, take the quests that involve killing Dourhands, and continue the Intro quest line.  At about 1 hour 45 minutes I'm usually done with Erid Luin, at which point I ask a lore question in World chat and whoever can answer it gets the Steel Key I get for Deeds of Erid Luin.  I then head to the Shire for exploration and slayer deeds.  At some point the 90 min boost wears off, so I pop the 30 minute one.  By time they've both worn off, I'm done with all the Shire slayers except slugs (which I don't do), and both the exploration deeds.  With the XP boost, I'll have leveled quickly enough that my Dourhand and Goblin kills will have netted me racial deeds as well.  Last run for me was 2 hours and 24 minutes, netting 225 TP.  The Starter Pack is invaluable for this, so, if there are still keys for it, find them and get it."

I was considering Pelagir and Linhir as hubs, but they're pretty much dead. Twenty-First Hall had less than a dozen players as well.   And I wholeheartedly agree about Bree being the major hub at the moment. I think it's a good thing as well because it allows the veteran players to interact with newer plays more."

lotro,2uj0t7,facebrick,3,Mon Feb 2 16:45:17 2015 UTC,"Angmar will have a lot more content. It has the Carn Dum instance cluster, the Rift raid dungeon, and lots of fellowship content. Some people dread Angmar since the amount of fellowship content makes things difficult to get through.   Forochel can be a pain since a lot of the quest objectives are far from the quest hubs. Expect lots of riding through the snow. The main settlement of Forochel is on the far north side, so quick travelling there takes some travel to unlock and then still leaves you a distance from everything else. There's a small dungeon that is good for farming Lossoth and Thorin's Hall rep.   I would go for Angmar or save your TP altogether."

Currency isn't too necessary until later since repairs are fairly cheap and well within the 2 gold cap  Bag space is amazing though, but with the new loot system, its not as vital since you can let stuff sit in pending until you get back to a vendor. I remember when there was no pending loot :( it sucked and bag space was vital then."
lotro,2uj0t7,StevenTM,1 point,Mon Feb 2 20:21:47 2015 UTC,Why is shared storage so vital? You can just mail stuff to alts..

lotro,2uj0t7,StevenTM,1 point,Wed Feb 4 22:46:39 2015 UTC,":o  I'm 67 and have 240g to my name, just from playing and auctioning some of the scrolls I've gotten as rewards (mostly from the level gated gifts), along with a Fate 3 tome from a level 65 School run. I've never sold crafting mats for gold.  This is on a server with a very stagnant economy.  And while mailing does cost a few silver, shared storage is 1k TP and mailing items between alts nets you up to hundreds of extra inventory slots for a paltry (especially when compared to bank space gold upgrades) sum."
lotro,2uj0t7,Cortobras,0,Thu Feb 5 22:49:33 2015 UTC,"Most of me have [Stone of the Tortoise] and the [Universal Toolkit].  The latter can come out of some lootboxes (steelbound?) or Hobbit Presents, but I end up buying them with TP for most characters.  I like the Journeyman Riding Skill - +78% on non-MC ponies, and I mostly just start a new character rather than suffering MC yet another time."
lotro,2uj0t7,Whitesymphonia,2,Mon Feb 2 19:02:58 2015 UTC,"I have the toolkit too, but i have one for all characters. You can mail it back and forth, no sense wasting extra TP for multiple.  The experience lock is pretty handy though but i think content should be number one, since it opens up TP, and content is fun!"
lotro,2ujv0h,TheBeastDam,5,Mon Feb 2 19:59:57 2015 UTC,"Yes, gotta buy it all. Nope :( Yes I believe it's only that character. I think it's under character unlock, not account upgrade. Any characters made during VIP have all of that stuff unlocked. People usually sub for a month and make all the characters they want, before unsubbing.   Sorry, but it kinda sucks. Best bet is to get VIP for a month and make all your toons you want."
lotro,2ujv0h,Whitesymphonia,2,Mon Feb 2 20:15:17 2015 UTC,"So If I create 10 toons lvl1 and get vip, all their trait slots will remain unlocked like my main?  Well thank you. Yeah it sucks big time..."
lotro,2ujv0h,Whitesymphonia,3,Mon Feb 2 20:37:35 2015 UTC,"Yup, all characters logged in while VIP, get all the traits and swift travel unlocked. Currency cap is unlocked for them too I believe."

lotro,2ubwh2,derpstrike,22,Sat Jan 31 19:20:16 2015 UTC,"Endgame progression is basically about building First Age Legendary Items and collecting/crafting top-tier Essences. Or, if you're into PvMP, earning Audacity gear.  In this case, the gear itself is the goal. There's no particularly difficult content that requires the gear. You run the content because you want the gear because you want the feeling of progression.  Personally, I don't recommend playing the game that way. Even back when the release of a traditional raid cluster was an annual affair, endgame progression was not LOTRO's strongest selling point. I really recommend playing LOTRO just as a story game. Do the quests because they have pretty decent writing. Do the T1 raids because some of them have pretty fun mechanics and neat set pieces. Do the Epic Battles for the sense of scale. Wander around and explore stuff because the world designers really know their shit."
lotro,2ubwh2,tobascodagama,3,Sun Feb 1 01:03:59 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that, I guess that's the best approach to have then."
lotro,2ubwh2,exploderator,8,Sun Feb 1 03:39:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I say tobascodagama summed it up pretty well.  There are no dedicated end game raids.  What I will say though, is that if you are new to LOTRO (which it sounds like), then you have a few years worth of raiding that is plenty of fun, if you find a kinship that likes doing all the raids for fun.  LOTRO has lots of raids, and many of them scale up to max level, so you can play them as end game raids and get good rewards just the same.  Many old timers have gotten bored with the raids that exist, and many are angry at Turbine for not making new raids, so you will hear lots of grumbling.  But like I said, there is plenty to play before you will ever get bored, and I have always had fun going in any raid in the whole game, including some old ones where I am over-level and there are no useful rewards.  Still fun."
lotro,2ubwh2,DCSFoyle,3,Sun Feb 1 06:07:52 2015 UTC,"The last bit, wander and explore, is always what sold it for me.  My favorite parts of Lotro were always skulking through Angmar or dungeon crawling in Moria. The gear and dailies were never really a big selling point for me, especially since I'm not a daily player"

lotro,2ubwh2,DCSFoyle,3,Sun Feb 1 15:29:13 2015 UTC,I'll give them credit for not backing down. They really did make the pillage and rap of Rohan palpable.  And at one point iirc you get sent on a revenge mission and behead a bunch of uruks and stick them on pikes along the Anduin.
lotro,2ubwh2,Walting,-13,Sun Feb 1 15:30:12 2015 UTC,"So reading your post there is no such kind of endgame and do the story & questing because Ltro is a ""just a story game""?  Sorry sir, but i disagree on ppl like you that play occasionally and think ""story and max level is the end game"".  In any MMORPG endgame is about equipment, raiding and pvp.

lotro,2ubwh2,ktree921,4,Sun Feb 1 01:27:55 2015 UTC,"On Landy, and especially in my kin and groups I am part of, lots of people are doing roving threats/Central Gondor stuff. To me it seems like a dailies/rep game, same as DA. Seems like a lot of doing the same stuff over and over every day, to get better equipment - so you can do the same stuff with better equipment. I don't PvP so I can't speak as to that. I have a level 100, but honestly, most of what people are doing for end-game stuff doesn't interest me. There are lots of instances/skirmishes that scale to 100, which is mostly what I do, and deeds. It took me personally a lot of time to get into Big Battles, and I still get kinda lost sometimes, but I am growing to enjoy them. Just my 2 cents."

lotro,2ubwh2,Walting,-4,Sun Feb 1 01:35:36 2015 UTC,"Well i guess you will list other MMO's endgame and then realize that endgame in any MMO is kind of repetitive... Just do not say that Lotro does not have any kind of endgame and it is all about the story. Dailies, gear etc. all MMOs have in common.

lotro,2ubwh2,holdpls,8,Sun Feb 1 01:20:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it's really boring.

Just couldn't stay interested."
lotro,2ubwh2,Walting,-12,Sat Jan 31 23:22:35 2015 UTC,Your endgame is hitting max level and quit?
lotro,2ubwh2,totalrandomguy,1 point,Sun Feb 1 01:17:52 2015 UTC,"There really is no real end game in lotro like in standard mmo's for example wow,Once you hit level cap you can either go to the pvmp zone and battle it out or you can grind old content for the current best gear for bragging rights i guess.  Like traditional mmo's where end game consists of grinding challenging raids for rare rewards instead lotro has no current end game raids so to get the end game gear players basically have to grind old content that has been scaled up for random gear drops,hence how you see a lot of sammy farm groups ( sammy is a old skirmish that can be scaled for level 100 gear drops).  Saying that I think what keeps lotro going is the community and the epic story line/level progression it,by far in my opinion bests any other mmo for story and content but just takes a total dive once you reach end game."
lotro,2ubwh2,Kevan88,1 point,Sun Feb 1 15:50:18 2015 UTC,but this endgame gear...is a BiS? so better stats or any advantage in combat? and in what do you need this increase in stats? in dungeons/raids?
lotro,2ubwh2,totalrandomguy,1 point,Sat Jun 20 10:51:43 2015 UTC,"Basically ye better stats or better gear rewards (like 3 of this Armour gives bonus x or 2 of that Armour gives bonus y) and tbh the best gear is only minimaly better than the end game standard gear sure it would allow you to try the harder difficulty in raids (raids have scales of difficulty like 1,2,3) or i guess give you a sligh more help in the pvp area.  But saying that to do higher difficulty raids you generally need the group over the gear as the gear buffs are minimal and the higher difficulty stuff requires a LOT if teamwork and communication."
lotro,2ubwh2,SirIBON,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:36:34 2015 UTC,"The Endgame is maybe the time you remember what you enjoy most of the game. Raids could be one point, but that are not really present. So the Story, in special Angmar & Moria could be an other factor. To enjoy it again create a Toon and play the Story with the intention to feel Arda again, not to become Maxlevel."
lotro,2ua9v1,touchofkiel,5,Sat Jan 31 06:55:26 2015 UTC,"I started playing 8 weeks ago. Before that I had been a hardcore xbox gamer since 2007. I played every day for at least a few hours. I also didn't own a PC. I built my first PC in December because I got tired of the crap console developers pull (ahem, Destiny), and because of having to have a gold subscription. I didn't think I would be able to successfully PC game or even figure out how to game with a mouse and keyboard. It took me about two hours before I got the hang of it. Then it took me about one day before it felt natural. You'll be able to get the hang of it no problem. I've played 190 hours so far and I'm at level 46. That's with a few XP boosts and I got VIP last week where you get an XP bonus too. I don't think I'll hit 100 before the end of the year. I also wanted to say that the people in the game have been super helpful. I play on Silverlode and people there have given me armor and weapons (I didn't ask for them, they just made me great stuff because they felt like helping), supplies for crafting, and have helped me in instances or fellowship quests. The community is great."

lotro,2u9dea,async_fm,8,Sat Jan 31 01:11:51 2015 UTC,"Absolutely a viable main healer, but definitely a different style of healing as /u/Arathaert said. From my experience as a RK, it's more proactive than reactive, as many of our heals are HoTs or bubbles (or removing effects). We've got a couple of really good strong heals for when the tank really needs help, but a lot of it is just... keeping people up with buffs/HoTs/bubbles so they don't get so low that those don't work or help enough. Whereas - and again, just my experience, and I don't have nearly as much of it on a mini - a mini can just throw out heals to whoever needs it. I know that's a gross oversimplification, but I believe minis have much more direct heals versus HoTs. And I can't remember if they have to quite work up to their strong heals like RKs do with their attunement. Someone who's actually played a mini more than me could talk more about this."
lotro,2u9dea,ohliamylia,5,Sat Jan 31 03:47:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely work well as healers. I love playing the healer role and play both mini and RK.   It's already mentioned, but RK is more preventative medicine, while minstrel is more reactive. They both have HoTs and burst healing, but RKs favor HoTs and minis favor burst healing.   Personally, I prefer mini due to the fact that RKs tend to overheal easily, and that draws additional aggro. Furthermore, HoTs have overall more heals, but is weak to quick burst damage. I prefer minis ability to burst heal, and use their minor HoTs for maintenance.  Both are very viable and tons of fun though."
lotro,2u9dea,Whitesymphonia,2,Sat Jan 31 08:07:45 2015 UTC,"I've got a max RK who I mainly use for healing and I can say for certain that they are great healers. I haven't played a minstrel, so I can't compare the two, however.  Healing with an RK relies a lot on constant HoTs on your fellowship and managing spike damage with bubbles and Epic for the Ages (the RKs main spike heal). It's a lot of fun, but it can get hectic if your group is taking a lot of damage."
lotro,2u9dea,Onistly,3,Sat Jan 31 05:51:29 2015 UTC,"RKs are definitely viable as main healers! It's a different style of healing for sure, but they're certainly able to heal groups for sure. I don't really play either one (yet! Mini's next on the list to level and is sitting around lvl 33), so I can't speak too authoritatively on it though."
lotro,2u9dea,Arathaert,1 point,Sat Jan 31 01:27:17 2015 UTC,"They can be great healers, a RK, captain, and my warden do tier 3 skirmishes almost daily and we only ever die if I mess up while tanking. Definitely viable as healers and they also hold rocks which is a huge plus."
lotro,2u9dea,epicman107,1 point,Sat Jan 31 03:23:48 2015 UTC,"RK are definetly viable for healing especially focus healing single targets.  I have to admit though that since Minstrels are one of the most played classes that people often forget about RK healing ablilities.  In world you rarely see anyone asking for ""healer"" unfortunately and Minstrels are over-shadowing healing RK's.  BUT: If you are well recognized as a RK healer - guild, friends, teamspeak - you are almost everytime very welcome to join.  From my own experience i can say that healing as a RK is very satisfying, because it is kind of difficult comparing to Minstrels"

lotro,2u7tie,DiscoJer,1 point,Fri Jan 30 22:30:45 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think of it as reprieve. This means a lot of my characters aren't going to be played anymore because they will lose their names (and am I one of those people who hates to have renamed characters)"

lotro,2u7tie,stueyg,1 point,Sat Jan 31 20:06:31 2015 UTC,"Considering what is involved, its better that they take their time rather than trying to rush it through quickly. With server hardware upgrades, server relocations, launcher upgrades and game changes you would be looking at 6+ months at best."
lotro,2u7tie,notwhoithink,1 point,Mon Feb 2 11:44:40 2015 UTC,"While I agree that I want it when it is done and done correctly, it's a bit of a shock to me that they would announce that these features would be coming potentially 12 months before they are available. A ton of things could change between now and then, and shifting budgets/priorities our a higher than expected level of complexity could kill this before it is ready. If that happens they will lose a shit ton of goodwill from the players. It's better if they wait until things are more concrete and closer to delivery."
lotro,2u7tie,tobascodagama,3,Tue Feb 3 01:13:49 2015 UTC,"Wasn't expecting the transfer service to move into the launcher, but I guess it makes sense since transfers will end up being mandatory for anybody on a closed server."
lotro,2u7tie,mridiot102,2,Fri Jan 30 18:35:01 2015 UTC,Do we have a list of which servers are closing yet?
lotro,2u7tie,tobascodagama,3,Fri Jan 30 19:55:55 2015 UTC,"No, not yet. IIRC, the plan was to roll out the new transfer tools, issue some free transfer tokens, and then close servers. I think they want to be completely, 100% sure their transfer stuff is rock solid before forcing anybody to do a transfer."
lotro,2u7tie,CommandNotFound,2,Fri Jan 30 20:04:49 2015 UTC,"Anyone knows if it's gonna be free? Between Isengard and Rohan I transfered a few of my lvl cap to Brandy, since then I kinda stopped playing (they are still at 85). I have no wish whatsoever to level them to 100, but I would like to send them to Landroval so I can login and RP now and then."
lotro,2u7tie,JKtheSlacker,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"If it's free, it will be from low population servers to higher population (Or possibly overpopulated to underpopulated.) Brandywine to Landroval is highly unlikely."

lotro,2u4wsg,TDimaline,12,Thu Jan 29 23:17:42 2015 UTC,"Oh gosh, 7-year player here so:   Coal can be bought from a supplier. For the first few months of the game I thought coal could only be harvested through rich/bountiful deposits or through the AH, I wasted a good bit of money back in SoA on AH coal. Save your deed grinding until you are over-leveled, one-shotting mobs is vastly better than killing them on level. If you get stuck somewhere simply type ""/stuck"" (without the parenthesis) and you will be ported to your milestone locations - this does cost you your cooldown, however. Very useful in Moria. You don't really need a lot of gold; but if you want some, just sell everything you loot from mobs (the purple items) and you will gain gold very quickly. Also, though I am not sure if this still works, you can farm some of the old (SoA) epic quests and get a few gold per run. The one in Mirobel I think was a favorite of mine. The ""del"" (delete) key will select the nearest object (like a pile of wood, quest object, etc.). It helps when looking for a specific thing. Backspace selects the nearest enemy.   Think that is it for now, beyond just enjoy the story."

NPC Lalia inside the Lalia's Market in Bree. Very useful 'Return to' skill, especially for non Hunter/Warden.  2) Shift + Right Click will make you auto-loot all the contents in your target, useful in harvesting resource nodes.  3) Need a specific ingredient from Supplier NPC but not wanting to scroll through all his/her wares? There's a search button--magnifying glass icon at the top right of the NPC's window, easier way to pinpoint to a thing you need.  4) You could drag&drop an item to the Auction House's search field to automatically fill the field with the item's name (instead of manually typing on it).  5) Right Click on the minimap display on you screen and there's an option to ""track nearby quests"". Very useful when you want to clear an area of all your active-and-nearby quests. The 5 quests tracking limit still does apply though.  6) Don't forget to check the internet for Free LotRO starter giveaway. The giveaway includes the riding skill for all your current and future characters. A huge help especially for F2P players.  7) Those vendor thrash such as sheaths, skins, furs that you obtained from defeating mobs can also be used for performing daily tasks (repeatable 5 times per day at start). Tasks not only gives you extra XP (and item XP for Legendary items) but also helps you to gain reputation with a certain faction."

In the Vale of Thrain, there is an old fortress Orodost that has some goblin killing quests. At one point, you come to a T in the path. Going left takes you to the quest objectives. Going right takes you to the entrance of Sarnur with some level 45 dourhands waiting outside. Found it when I was very low level. One of my first ""Oh Shit"" moments when running into those level 45 dourhands when I was expecting level 9.  That's when I learned if you run from mobs, they will eventually stop chasing :)"

lotro,2u4wsg,notwhoithink,1 point,Sun Feb 1 18:34:06 2015 UTC,Any chance you could give a brief explanation? :)
lotro,2u4wsg,mattrubik,1 point,Mon Feb 2 18:49:58 2015 UTC,"When I started, I was new to MMORPGs, so my character's overall appearance was of secondary importance. I saw that there was cosmetic items available, wardrobe storage, and outfits that could be worn, but I was more concerned with learning game mechanics. Once I started getting used to the game, I noticed how oddly my toon was dressed. Most low level armor is pretty generic and blandly colored, but once you hit 30+, armor gets for colorful, and my toon looked like he was dressed by a three-year old that had dropped some acid.   My first approach was to just dye what I had using dies from the AH. That can get expensive, especially for a new low-level player. Then I started to learn the cosmetic outfit system. I wasn't aware that you don't have to keep an item that is for cosmetic purposes only in inventory to wear it. So one of my inventory bags was always full of cosmetic items. Then I learned you can keep it in vault, shared, or home storage. Wardrobe storage also allows you to share cosmetic items with alts on the same server.   As someone else has pointed out, there is no need to use TP or Mitrhil coins to buy cosmetics. Most everything is available through cosmetic or classic vendors in skirmish camps using skirmish coin and medallions.   My advice for cosmetics is to find some pieces you like through questing and looting and use dyes and cosmetics purchases to fill out the rest of your look. My toons now don't look dorky. I have a low armor and heavy armour look for each, and usually with a mount to match."

I can't really recommend them to low level players because while they feature stat scaling, it doesn't really let low level characters make meaningful combat contributions. Skirmishes do a much better job of providing ad hoc scaling combat for low level players in my opinion.  If you want it just to have it, you could wait until it goes on sale.

Here is a link to the survey. And here is a link to the thread on the LOTRO forums.   https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?563466-Your-Favourite-Hubs&p=7309398#post7309398  Thanks for voting!

lotro,2u29jd,exploderator,2,Thu Jan 29 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"Aldburg also holds a special charm for scholars: you can craft standing at the vault keeper, accessing all your storage, and even the auction at the same time.  It's the only place in game like that, even better than Snowbourn.  Also, the relic+forge master is just a few steps away.  Super handy.  Special mention, and not on the list, is Lanuch, because you can have your vault open while talking to the relic master.  This is very handy for picking which legacies to extract on a batch of deconstructions, because you can see what you already have in storage while choosing.

lotro,2tzkbc,PocketXXX,7,Wed Jan 28 18:24:34 2015 UTC,"i find Bree to be the best place, overall. (minus craft guild baterers and such)  but having bought the store items that make all my ports 5m CDs, i can mix it up a bit.  i use Mirkwood for banking, as its the closest port to a vault and relic/forge guys.  but the one guy is also a quest-giver and clicking that extra gate annoys me, so i now go to DA for forging.  Thorins is the closest port to a Skirmish Camp, so i use that one a lot too.  Esteldin is my favorite for crafting for low levels, but is not convenient for my lvl 100.  He often hits DA or Bree for crafting.  Edenwaith has a great spot for crafting and is close to a port.  Galtrev might be the most centralized and convenient, overall.  having everything the closest.  sorry for the long, near-non-answer  :)"
lotro,2tzkbc,SapienChavez,5,Wed Jan 28 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"Aldburg has always been my favorite. It's a bit of a hike from the milestone and stable, with the skirm camp about half way between the stable and craft area, but once your in the craft hall, everything else is there. You can stand on the entry rug, use the forge, workbench, oven and interact with a vendor without moving. All the guilds are there, plus the AH, bank and relic master/forge master. Scholar can stand at the bank and craft, so convenient! If I recall, the only thing is that it is just to far to have the bank and AH open at one time."

lotro,2tzkbc,Arch27,3,Wed Jan 28 23:06:50 2015 UTC,"They moved stuff to be near each other in Bree? It used to be all sprawled out over the city, which is why I was partial to The Twenty-First Hall in Moria. Everything is all right near each other with minimal running about.

If you are able to pick out one enemy at the time you kill stuff soooo much faster.  I don't think you get the lynx before about lvl 30 and it works best if you spec into the blue line with your traits. Good luck on leveling your lore-master!"

lotro,2typbk,Zethry,3,Wed Jan 28 14:17:03 2015 UTC,"Although there' s a lot of Europeans on US servers (like Brandywine, Landroval), I'd still recommend the EU servers. There's more players if you play at normal times and if you'd like to join a kinship that uses only for example Swedish, Polish etc., it will be easier on EU. Also the EU servers will be moved to EU soon and most new players will not join the US servers now that the severs will have tags in their name.  If you are really interested in RP, choose Laurelin.  Otherwise, I'd recommend Snowbourn. From what I've tried, it's the biggest EU server alongside Evernight. I like the community too, at least the kinship I'm in is awesome. :)"
lotro,2typbk,Spaisi,2,Wed Jan 28 16:47:07 2015 UTC,"Since most of the servers today are pretty empty, theres two servers which I would recommend. All servers are based in the US, so the EU servers currently have the same ping as the US ones. If you're into roleplaying and a good community, go to Landroval. The other server I'd recommend is Brandywine (the one I'm on :D). Brandywine has the reputation of being the biggest and most crowded server, which I personally like. It's also one of the only servers where there's active PvMP every day. The community is also very great, but Landroval might be better on that aspect. Hope you find a home in LOTRO!  EDIT: I'm european, and there's lots of europeans on Brandywine atleast."
lotro,2typbk,Botsji,3,Wed Jan 28 15:31:49 2015 UTC,"Is there any way to check the population of each server? I noticed that logging in you can't even see if the population is Low, Medium or High (this option is present in other games).   I'm currently on Laurelin, which is the RP EU server and one of the most crowded since the launch (don't know about the past few months/year). I also heard that they will put soon the option to free transfer your characters through the servers (like Rift does).   I would love to go to one of the crowdest servers if I've the possibility, but I'm afraid that I will always miss the peak as I live in EU so I will basically play when everyone in U.S. is sleeping :P"
lotro,2typbk,Theredas,2,Wed Jan 28 16:42:05 2015 UTC,"Don't listen to people recommending US servers. In a few weeks the EU servers will have their datacenters moved back to EU. The EU servers are: Snowbourn Eldar Evernight Withywindle Gilrain Laurelin (RP)  When the servers get moved back to EU, some servers will slowly be closed. Right now we don't know which ones, but I would guess its gilrain and then evernight and/or withywindle. When servers close a free transfer will be offered to a server of your choice. Just make sure you choose one of these, because it is impossible to move from an US server to an EU server."

It's one of the most popular EU servers (according to Lux Aeterna Evernight was the most active over the last 24 hours). I would think Eldar and Withywindle would be prime candidates, since their populations are less than half of Evernight. Has Turbine said something about Evernight?"

I know for a fact gilrain is completely dead, with laurelin being RP and snowbourn and evernight being alive that leaves WW and eldar.   I guess it depends on wether or not they want 2 or 3 non-rp servers. If they want 2 they'll close both eldar and WW, if they want 3 they'll keep one of them open.  At least thats my guess."

That means we spend lots of time in the started areas and on FTP content. Most everyone in the kin is very helpful and willing to give advice.

At the moment I only have the Evendim QP in terms of paid content, I did have mirkwood and moria a long time ago but I didn't know about the transfer to turbine and lost that account so now I'm waiting for the quad pack to go on sale."
lotro,2typbk,fadhero,1 point,Thu Jan 29 21:01:42 2015 UTC,"The current plan is to focus on SoA, then move to Moria when the time is right. After that, I don't know.   You don't have to plan to stay below level 50-60 forever. But if you are more inclined to powerlevel right now to get to Moria and beyond, then the kin probably wouldn't make much sense for you.

That's why I'm waiting on the quad pack sale, usually shows up in Steam sales and the next one will be a while so plan on doing everything I can until then, I just want to make sure I can go higher when the time comes, I wouldn't want to spend time getting to know everyone only to have to leave later on."

lotro,2ty1b0,Darchseraph,2,Wed Jan 28 08:32:51 2015 UTC,"Hunter here.  Yes I have noticed something like that, but not with so much precision as your observations.  I'll put it like this: there seems to be an issue sometimes with extra pauses between or after queued induction bow skills.  I think I quit using heart seeker for this reason, there was often a strange and long pause after shooting, perhaps 1s where nothing would happen.  I never paid close attention.  That having been said, my standard openings are:   single mob: focus -> swift bow -> penetrating shot (repeat until focus is drained, usually 5 or more) many mobs: focus -> split shot  -> rain of thorns (repeat until focus is drained)   Both of those queue an induction before a focus skill, and neither of them pause, I am sure.  Here's another bug: for big crowds I would prefer to open with focus -> rain of thorns (repeat), but it ALWAYS fails, because the rain of thorns WILL NEVER CRIT if it is the opening shot.  This, in spite of shooting into a crowd, with 80% crit chance during the 5s improved focus buff.  This is a problem of course, because we rely on the critical hit to remove the 10s cooldown.  If I use split shot first, the bug does not happen, and rain of thorns will then proceed to behave like an AoE machine gun, as long as there are enough mobs to ensure a critical hit each time, which is pretty reliable at 30% chance on each of 8 shots on 8 targets.  The damage is immense, and the main limit is power.  I want to skip the split shot, so I can get in a couple more rain of thorns shots during that 5s buff after focus.  It's not a huge deal, but noticeable."
lotro,2ty1b0,exploderator,1 point,Wed Jan 28 11:38:42 2015 UTC,"I'm a pretty lowbie hunter (Trying to play all classes to at least 25 to get a feel for them) so I don't have Rain of Thorns yet. My single target queue is usually:  Get Focus (or not since I run the + focus regen passive in Blue Line) Swift Bow->Barrage->Penetrating->Barrage if I have max focus, Swift Bow->Barrage->Quick Shot->Barrage if not.  I think the problem will be less of an issue as I sink more points into passive focus regen at least for solo play, but trying to put out good sustained DPS is frustrating due to certain skill sequences not transitioning well.  .3 seconds is a lowball estimate, the delay really feels unbearable and forces me to queue skills to avoid it rather than for optimal DPS.  Something similar happens with the Champion where even though most of the skills are Instant, your character kind of stands around awkwardly for half a second or so before proceeding with the next one. This could be because some of the champ skill animations are quite fast, but it feels more significant than that."
lotro,2ty1b0,exploderator,1 point,Wed Jan 28 11:43:56 2015 UTC,"OK, I logged in and checked, and I can't find this ""Barrage"" skill anywhere.

OK, I'll have to try out a blue line setup, and I'll see what I can notice.  Will experiment and see where I can spot the delays in various setups."

I run penetrating shot like a machine gun, at level 100 you can trait to regenerate focus from critical hits, you have a high chance of getting them, and your focus cost is reduced as well.  You can spam penetrating shot as long as you keep getting crits.  I've had as many as 10 in rapid fire.  They do a lot of damage.  But that stacking damage would be bad ass.  I will puzzle out a blue line and try it."

lotro,2ty1b0,legofreak11,1 point,Wed Jan 28 13:09:46 2015 UTC,"A lot of skills in lotro have built-in end lag. Meaning that there is a small, but noticeable, amount of time before you can start executing your next skill. One really noticeable one that I remember off the top of my head is ""barbed arrow"" The reason you were seeing a discrepancy in the time to finish a sequence of skills when the order is changed its because some skills can cancel the end lag of a previous skill. One good example of this is a champ that can cancel the animation and subsequent end lag of ferocious strikes by using clobber immediately after the ferocious strikes animation starts. This applies to your test because barrage was able to cancel the end lag on swift bow, but quick shot wasnt, which caused the first test to finish quicker."

Kill the bat lady first and remember to use big AoE attacks when those bats spawns as they do the most damage.  As soon as the bat lady is deady it should be fairly easy.

lotro,2tshvt,UDE785,1 point,Wed Jan 28 14:11:58 2015 UTC,"Audacity no longer scales after 74.  At 75 you can barter for the first pieces of Aud gear, 1 Audacity per piece.  Virtues, states, and gear all still scale up to 96-99, just less and less the more you level.  From what I've found, either at 85 with all pve gear, Hytboldt, gold jewlery, etc.  or at 95 with all Audacity gear (same amount as the 100 gear) seems to be almost better than going out at 100.  At 95, the gear will have the same stats as the 100 gear."
lotro,2tp5xr,Arathaert,4,Mon Jan 26 06:34:17 2015 UTC,My two cents: I would rather have had more of the landscape shard dropper kind of mobs. Mobs that aren't worth killing except for the bragging rights or an inconsequential drop (like Torahammas). Or even just a deed for the existing ones.   These will be farmed on release and quickly ignored once everyone gets their jewelry.
lotro,2tp5xr,My_feet_are_cold,1 point,Mon Jan 26 12:42:49 2015 UTC,Or first-agers in this case.  I mean.. I wish they all needed at least a full fellowship for sure.
lotro,2tp5xr,Big_Daddy_Dingo,2,Tue Jan 27 09:05:23 2015 UTC,Maybe they should increase gold drops so its worth farming for coin maybe. Or perhaps an increased rate of keys/lootboxes/stat tomes. could also be good.
lotro,2tp5xr,Soarel2,1 point,Tue Jan 27 00:47:06 2015 UTC,oo agreed.
lotro,2tp5xr,FG28,2,Tue Jan 27 09:06:11 2015 UTC,I like how the landscape has big threats again instead of the WBs.
lotro,2toxq2,thewookie15,8,Mon Jan 26 05:00:01 2015 UTC,"Hmm... most populated are generally considered to be Brandywine and Crickhollow. Not always the best idea to go to the largest pop servers though, if you're looking for a good community. I'd say pick a medium-high pop server (I play on Gladden, or Landroval is good too if you like the lore).  Also.... welcome to the game! It's an awesome one and there's a fantastic community surrounding it. Super helpful and kind, both here on reddit and actually also on Twitch.tv. There's usually some folks hanging around in the chat on my channel if you ever have questions about the game or wanna just hang out. :)"

lotro,2toxq2,turtlechef,1 point,Mon Jan 26 17:59:23 2015 UTC,"They should all be labeled in the launcher with -RP or -RE.  Landroval has most of the big events, though."

lotro,2toxq2,Kazzad,5,Mon Jan 26 06:11:57 2015 UTC,http://lotro-wiki.com/ is about it.  Also welcome back!! :)

lotro,2tly9v,Jeffplz,16,Sun Jan 25 12:40:27 2015 UTC,"There are ways to power level, easiest would the Sword Halls method  /u/Dod4r explained, however it's been made harder to encourage folks not to power level.    My question to the OP is why?  99% of the game comes prior to cap and you can do nearly everything that is at cap prior to cap, even some from level 10 on.  Getting to cap doesn't mean much at the moment.  Yeah, you can finally get top level gear (though much of it has lower level versions also), but guess what, it's a grind in itself.  Much more boring grind if you ask me since it's just essentially the same quests over and over each day.  This game is about the journey, not the end."
lotro,2tly9v,UDE785,5,Sun Jan 25 14:08:32 2015 UTC,May be a WoW player.  WoW is fun to level through a few times but most of the real meat in WoW is the end game at high levels.
lotro,2tly9v,RamenJunkie,3,Sun Jan 25 14:39:49 2015 UTC,"Agreed. If you want to power level, this game is likely not for you."
lotro,2tly9v,JKtheSlacker,0,Sun Jan 25 14:16:16 2015 UTC,"i'm a f2p, and have been since the f2p model launched. not looking to ever pay so just wanna hit as high a level as I can just to say i did, and maybe to one shot everything while I finish the book quests from lvls 30-100"
lotro,2tly9v,UDE785,6,Sun Jan 25 14:27:13 2015 UTC,"Then the Sword Halls method is out since you'll have to pay for the Mirkwood to get SH.  I can kinda see you're point though, if you're not wanting to pay, you are stuck with one ugly grind.  However, that is the downside of not wanting to pay for the game."
lotro,2tly9v,Ambassador_Buta,9,Sun Jan 25 17:26:28 2015 UTC,"Sword halls is the slow version  Get to 65 (hardest part), then do warg pens tier 1 till you're 100. Will take about a day depending on how many boosts you bring. You may need to bring friends along as Warg Pens is a 3-man instance and the wargs are scaled terribly, but there's no shortage of people on /world at Brandywine.  You only do the first 2 quests as they take like 5 minutes to do, then quit & repeat.  Although if you are f2p you may find this method difficult to even start. You may need the Mirkwood expansion, and the ability to buy Enhanced Experience from the destiny point store will help. Also depending on how fast you want to be at 100 you will need 100% or 200% boosts.  I like seeing people trying to dissuade you from this, they don't realize how fucking tedious the quests get after 75 or the 'mounted combat'. I don't think they realize just how many people are getting to 100 as quick as possible to skip all the bullshit."
lotro,2tly9v,-Exquisite-,3,Sun Jan 25 15:57:32 2015 UTC,Yeah the mounted combat sucked. I ended up powerleveling  leveling through all of that.
lotro,2tly9v,Throxon,3,Sun Jan 25 16:04:11 2015 UTC,"...they don't realize how fucking tedious the quests get after 75 or the 'mounted combat'. I don't think they realize just how many people are getting to 100 as quick as possible to skip all the bullshit.   This is the entire reason I put my Warden down @ 81. Mounted Combat, while an interesting concept, did not live up to my expectations (I was hoping for something a little more like Mount and Blade's mounted combat, swift and mean)."
lotro,2tly9v,exploderator,3,Sun Jan 25 17:30:44 2015 UTC,"I can't quite understand why mounted combat is enough of a big deal to quit over.  There's barely any of it actually required in the game.  It just seems like you could pretty much ignore that it exists, aside from a very few quests."
lotro,2tly9v,Staerke,5,Sun Jan 25 22:39:02 2015 UTC,"I feel as though I'm the only one who actually enjoys it.  You get to a point where you're killing mobs in 2 or 3 shots and it's especially fun with one or two other players, riding around killing stuff.  Meh."
lotro,2tly9v,exploderator,3,Mon Jan 26 00:29:57 2015 UTC,"You're not the only one who likes mounted combat.  It's not my best favorite thing, but I decided from the very start to actually just figure it out enough to be comfortable with it, which took a little determination.  As a result, there are times when it's distinctly satisfying to be able to run circles around a big pack of mobs and actually be able to kill them.  As a squishy hunter that is seldom an option on foot, we are just not built to take beating and live.  So, it's that guy above can complain and quit his warden, but as a hunter I've never been able to take on half of what he can solo, so I would rather have mounted combat than not.  Unless the game wants to offer me some other way to survive the heavy shit, I'm willing to climb on my trusty war steed instead of running away.  I just wish I could do it everywhere, like that warden can."
lotro,2tly9v,Throxon,2,Mon Jan 26 02:58:48 2015 UTC,"Oh I didn't quit over it, I just put my Warden down... I'm slowly making my way through Moria on a Champ, and North Downs on a RK."
lotro,2tly9v,exploderator,4,Mon Jan 26 23:25:29 2015 UTC,"Sorry there, I should have spoken more carefully, I didn't mean to insult you as some ""whiny quitter"" or anything like that :)  Is there something particularly messed up with mounted on warden that makes it extra insufferable?  Otherwise my meaning was just that mounted seems like such a tiny and irrelevant thing, I couldn't quite imagine how it would make any difference to anyone, aside from the disappointment that it was never really fixed or utilized, and that our fastest steeds wear ice skates.  The one and only main I've leveled so far was a few years ago, and trying to get through pre-remake Moria almost did make me quit, to be honest.  It was so dark and hard, and I sucked so bad.  I finally realized I could just run through and leave into Lothlorien, and I can tell you, the relief I had was palpable enough that looking back, I realize it was similar to how the fellowship would have felt, minus the tragedy of losing Gandalf of course."
lotro,2tly9v,Throxon,2,Tue Jan 27 05:13:55 2015 UTC,"You're good. Idk, it just seemed like a weak gimmick. Then again, I ground myself through the Isengard Epic and showed up into Rohan and got onto the horse. Haven't played him since, so maybe I should try it again. Give it another chance and maybe get through Rohan and into Gondor."
lotro,2tly9v,exploderator,3,Tue Jan 27 23:51:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, there's really not very much need for mounted combat, it's required way less than you would think.  Sure, there are a few times in quests, but not enough to really matter, or even end up feeling burnt out on it.  Overall, I don't love mounted, but I got OK with it, so I can use it when I have to, and not hate it, and I am thankful there's very little you actually need it for.  So I would say yeah, don't let it put you off."
lotro,2tly9v,StevenTM,1 point,Wed Jan 28 01:10:37 2015 UTC,By a day you mean like 12 hours? For real? And it can be soloed?
lotro,2tly9v,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:30:25 2015 UTC,"Depends entirely on how many and what kind of boosts you bring. But yes, it literally can be done in under 24 hours.   It caaaaaaan be soloed but it's really hard. It's a scaled instance thus the wargs will annihilate most light armor classes because they're scaled terribly.  It's really fun though because of that."
lotro,2tly9v,StevenTM,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:34:52 2015 UTC,Think it's doable as a champ that knows how to play his class decently well? I can take on 3 on-level elites or an EM and elite.
lotro,2tly9v,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:37:15 2015 UTC,"Find out haha, it's hard to say.  I've seen those wargs shred captains apart, I only took my burg through warg pens and it was pretty damn hard with a group of on-level fellows. Basically if the RK in our group ever pulled aggro he was already dead.  Also, remember that the wargs should be many levels above you as you want the maximum EXP, so you really might want to just find a level 100 to help you out."
lotro,2tly9v,StevenTM,1 point,Mon Jan 26 22:51:39 2015 UTC,"Easier said than done, I can't well beg for boosts in /world"
lotro,2tly9v,Eshneh,2,Thu Jan 29 18:53:12 2015 UTC,"Might not be relevant now but when I played I would get 2xp tome's, gather up a ton of quests from each zone, complete them and not hand them in, activate the tome and then hand the quests in.    This worked really well from 40-45 or whenever you can start the Moria questline, which you can power through"
lotro,2tly9v,Dod4r,2,Sun Jan 25 23:02:52 2015 UTC,"Get 1 or 2 level 100 toons, make 3 man fellowship, do sword hall T2 without challenge mode. Set level to your level + 10. Use 200% xp boost.

It just comes with the territory with a very large population. If you have X trolls on any server, and you multiply that ratio to the # of players in Brandy, you get the picture.  Also since PvMP is very popular on that server, there's more competitiveness and trash talking. Most of the ugly stuff that happens in global that make people roll their eyes in other servers is trashtalking and complaining about the Ettenmoors (PvP map), so I guess apply a bit of that factor to Brandy too."

lotro,2temq5,hotbassfishin,1 point,Fri Jan 23 14:58:58 2015 UTC,"I entered a building and as soon as I was inside my character started hopping up and down, never touching the floor, and I hear a splashing sound as if I jumped into a river. I opened the door behind me but I couldn't walk though, I was stuck. I teleported out of there, but then I'm still floated/hopping except around twenty feet in the air :/ I 'swam'/hopped my way across the map til I was able to walk, but it's not fixed... some measure of grounding makes me hop around, and any doorway traps me inside. It's frustrating !"
lotro,2temq5,hotbassfishin,1 point,Fri Jan 23 16:32:10 2015 UTC,"That does sound annoying. There might be a repair game files button somewhere in the launcher but I'm not sure. If you really can't figure anything out, it may be best to just re-install the game. It takes a long time, but might be the only fix if a file is broken and there's no repair option. I've had to re-install for other glitch issues I couldn't figure out, and it worked fine. Maybe you could contact Turbine support? They might know what's causing it."

lotro,2tdsg5,ray_falkner,3,Fri Jan 23 07:27:41 2015 UTC,"Actually with the legendary weapons you get some bonus to tactical damage which definitely all the damages from your skills.  Other than that, the actual damage from the weapon doesn't matter much for those three classes."

lotro,2tdsg5,klikka89,2,Fri Jan 23 13:14:16 2015 UTC,"For LM it may, depending on your playstyle. Please note a lot may have changed since I was leveling my LM like 2 years ago. That said, when I got the sword trait (not sure what level this is acquired now) I actually started using melee/auto-attacks for the first time on that character. You will have to start using melee if you wanna take advantage of the power restoration effect of staff sweep. Also, using Staff Strike while enemy is flanked does...something. Extra damage or increased critical chance or something but it is significant speaking anecdotally.  In summary, you may not be using melee/auto attacks much at low level because of how squishy you are but that will most likely change later on. Weapon DPS isn't negligible but it is also not nearly as important as Will and tactical damage boosts."
lotro,2tdsg5,CharmingJack,1 point,Fri Jan 23 17:51:28 2015 UTC,"LMs still get some stuff that encourages using your staff now, especially in the Red line. (In particular, there's a trait which gives a stun proc on Staff-Strike.)  Also, the Sword and Staff trait is no longer a legendary trait, now it's a passive that all LMs acquire at IIRC level 40. So every LM now has the potential to put out some fairly respectable melee DPS, though they still get most of their DPS from either pets (Blue line) or tactical skills (Red line)."
lotro,2taiwd,hotbassfishin,19,Thu Jan 22 14:52:57 2015 UTC,"I think the mapping is more accurate than it is not. More locations are where they should be, and I have to imagine that they are named directly as a result of the source material and the plethora of appendices.   Scale, on the other hand, is way off. Bucklebury Ferry can be easily seen from the Brandywine bridge (and vice versa) in game. These should be miles apart (some say 10, others say 16-20)."

lotro,2taiwd,Eslader,7,Thu Jan 22 16:24:20 2015 UTC,"That said, trying to ride a horse from Ered Luin to Rohan would take for freaking ever if the distances were accurate to the books. All MMO's based on some sort of source material shorten the distances. SWG's planets were tiny compared to the actual size of a planet. The speeders in that game went about as fast as the fastest non-warsteed horse does in LOTRO, and you could cross from one end of the planet to the other in less than 10 minutes. (of course, it was also odd that planets had ends, but for whateveer reason they didn't have wraparound maps)"

lotro,2taiwd,Arch27,8,Thu Jan 22 16:36:02 2015 UTC,"I was so pissed when I came back and found out you could get the horses so much earlier. It's also so much easier to get money.  I remember working so hard to reach level 35, and then even then only having just over 1g. I think I even ended up taking a ""loan"" from one of the officers in my kin to help me afford it."
lotro,2taiwd,ChriosM,2,Thu Jan 22 17:31:04 2015 UTC,"I had discovered a small exploit early on (which has since been fixed) that allowed me to get enough money before I was able to purchase the horse. There was a rare crafting item that sold high at any vendor, and the spiders of the Lone Lands were erroneously dropping them with every kill instead of at a rate more consistent with rare materials. Not being the greedy sort, I exploited that loophole enough to get the money needed for a (large) house and my first horse.  As for people able to get them earlier, I was still into the game when the change came. For me, it was a sad and happy thing. Sad because of how much it felt like you earned that horse previously, and happy because I have at least 6 alts who were stalled out between levels 15-25 at the time, and having a mount made things so much easier for me to get them up higher."
lotro,2taiwd,cbstryker,2,Thu Jan 22 17:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, horses used to be crazy expensive, even just the regular ones. Especially since it was so hard to come by gold. When I hit 35, it costed me all the coin I had on 5 characters to buy my first one. Now I start with 3 or 4 mounts on every character I make and can use them the moment I'm out of the noob instance. The only mount I will pay for now is the Thorin's Hall goat as it is easy to farm rep and it's better than the free goat I got with Moria."

I know and forgive the numerous reasons they scaled LOTRO's Middle Earth the way they did, but I still dream of a Middle Earth that is scaled MUCH larger.  Imagine if it was scaled so that it took 1 hour game travel time per day of book travel time, in stead of 5 minutes.  You could get somewhere new, and it would be a real adventure, a real accomplishment, just to have traveled there at all.  You could still have fast travel once routes were unlocked, so people wouldn't be socially isolated by impossible travel times.  There could be ways to balance that.  But the real challenge and genuine vastness would be there.  You would have to really learn how to not get lost."

Think about the books: it took a fellowship to survive traveling, unless you were some complete bad-ass like Aragorn.  Think about how many long-time players fizzled out and left LOTRO, because they ran out of raids and instances.  What if merely traveling was that challenging, and exploring any remote or hidden part of the world took real effort and teamwork?  If you want to find the rare treasures, it's going to be like doing a raid.  I honestly don't know how the mechanics would work, and it will take a lot of clever people thinking about it to figure out how to make a huge scale world be fun and feasible and not just an impossible drudgery.  And it would be a VERY different kind of MMO that way.  But we have to remember, computers and games might be new stuff at this point in history, literally a couple of decades worth.  But we have centuries ahead of us, and a lot of things WILL happen in all that time.  LOTR will be a classic for hundreds of years to come, just like Shakespeare."

Maybe you could only travel the main roads and take out small bands of orcs solo.  You'd have to get a group to travel farther out or to more hostile territory.  But it'd be neat to have places in game where you could meet other adventurers to group with, like at the Prancing Pony or a ranger camp near a ""fellowship"" zone."

Is this a class quest that I haven't come across or was this abandoned.   I've been playing since beta, and AFAIK those mobs have always been there.  I went back as a L65 Hunter at one point to see if there was anything interesting there hiding behind them, but there was nothing.  Lotro-Wiki references Dale Sageford as being at a camp that is a mini-quest hub in the Midgewater Pass/Weather hills.  He and his compatriots give a couple of L22 quests and also an L55 quest that takes you to those mobs.  I'm pretty sure that this camp was added during one of the revamps, and consequently they just added some quests to give a reason for those mobs to be there when the mobs pre-dated the quests.  The L55 quests do give LI XP.  As for Brandy Hills/Brandywood/Starmere lake, that's a more sparsely populated area of the map.  IIRC there is a deed related to locations that includes Ost Barandor in the Brandy Hills area, which overlooks Starmere Lake.  That also takes you to the area of the giant Svalfang, which has a handful of quest lines that originate with Dob Sandheaver in Bree (I think he's outside or behind the Prancing Pony).  Far Chetwood is an interesting case.  There are quests at the Hengstacer Farm that will send you east to the ruins that sit between Nen Harn and Far Chetwood (Turtle Soup was one of them, I think).  There is also a small camp with a few NPCs that give quests in the area.  I always liked those areas of the map because they seem so much out of the way and rarely traveled, at least on Nimrodel.  They can be good places to work some deeds and harvest resources, but generally they just seem to be fun places to explore.  I feel like Bree-land has more of those places than most of the maps.  It's just that people sometimes seem in such a rush to level that they only hit the major quest hubs anymore, so these interesting and out of the way places get ignored."

The Brandywood , the giant has been there for a long time. You picked up the pack and it sent you to the hobbit (name?) to return it ( I do not remember if the Giant roamed around then or appeared when you picked up the pack), starting the quest at the hobbit to go retrieve the pack was added latter.  There was a quest that sent you to Starmere Lake area (maybe beta?).  The north east section with Nen Harn where not there at launch, they where  added later as part of a tool test. The orcs were there but I do not remember them being as organized as they are now. There was a quest or three(horse farm ?) that specifically sent you there to kill some added even latter. The little camp was there but unoccupied, the quest givers were added even later after the few quest that sent you into the area.  Weatherhills, I do not remember if the ruins where there at launch or not. The level 55 orcs were added much later, have never seen a quest that leads you there. Even checked that other little group of quest givers that are on the horse route between Saeradan's cabin and Candaith's encampment (they were added after the Orcs).  I do not know about now, but in the past there where little changes like this not always documented, usually in the chapter updates.

It's a non-standard slow stable ride that takes you across Bree-land and right through that group of mobs.  The impact, as a low-level noob in the early days, of suddenly finding yourself on a horse surrounded by majorly high-level mobs (this was before Moria, even) is an ""ohshitohshitohshit"" moment that I shall always remember fondly.  I don't know if there was ever a quest involved, or if that stand of mobs exists solely for that dramatic moment, but it's clear to me that this was a pretty deliberate placement."

lotro,2tamy7,MystbornGaming,6,Thu Jan 22 15:29:43 2015 UTC,"The last set of 12-man content, or raids, that were put into the game came with the Erebor instance cluster at 85.  Since then, the only larger group content came to us with the Epic Battle system, wherein you can choose to run certain instances on 3,6, and one on 12 man mode.  So, yes, from that aspect - you're spot on.  As far as the viability of older raids and content: Turbine inserted loot tables into the older instances that scale to the level the instance/raid is run on, up to lv.100.  Most of the older 3-6-12 man content follows this scaled model, allowing you to enjoy (most of) the older content with current level cap rewards.    It's also worth noting that upon completion of these instances, you'll also be rewarded with a ""personal"" loot pool that only you have access to by hitting the chest at the end.  The gear from this pool is specific to your class (Guards and Champs get might/vit gear rolled to them, Hunters and Burgs get agi/vit gear rolled to them, etc.), as well as a chance at LI crystals, stat tomes, and more commonly - relics.  Most folks do run the older, scaled content in my experience. Whether it's an older 12 man skraid, or an Ost Dunhoth/Helegrod wing.  Although most of the playerbase gravitates toward the Big Battle system  for its recently revamped jewellry reward system.  Personally, I still run the older 75 Isengard raids for cloak cosmetics with kin mates when I'm not focusing on Epic Battles or catching an invite to a scaled 12 or 6 man.  I think that you'd still get plenty of rewarding enjoyment out of the older instances, thanks largely to the scaled loot system.  As for the EC question: The only weapons to use past LIs are for your offhand, or bow/xbow in the case of champs and guards."

Old instances and raids are still run, but groups can be hard to find, unless you're on a busy server like Brandywine (Free server transfers are coming soon!) There is usually end game content, but then again, that's not the strong point of the game. The fun part of LOTRO is journeying and exploring the lands. Epic Battles are a very gimmicky system that has not received a lot of love from the community. You definitely want to find a raiding kinship however, on a big server.  Always use Legendary Items. Regular weapons are for extra weapons, for dualwielders and etc. So my Champion uses a legendary sword and a regular sword, since you can't equip two legendary swords."

Is there any reason to do so other than to experience them once?   Gameplay wise it's incredibly useful if you run Dar Narbugud before entering Lothlorien as you can get Galadhrim rep letting you go into Caras Galadhon straight from moria. A single full run puts you really far.  Other than that no not really except for gear & cosmetics.   Old content aside, with no Raids what do you do at cap level? Battles? PvMP? Grind Deeds?

There are still many opportunities to join kins and many instances - especially if you find a good group to run with.    For me, I'm sticking with E, but if I was to try another server - I think I'd roll a character and run in from 1-20 and use that time to feel out what the community is like.

I think we can safely rule out Turbine doing anything significant beyond what they already did.  But it is foolish to be blind to the future.  Computers and games are new stuff in the world, but they are here to stay: they will be here 50, 100, 1000 years into the future, and so will LOTR.  Anyone who thinks such a classic story as LOTR will only ever have one MMO made is short sighted, as far as I'm concerned.  What game mechanics the next LOTRO will use, is anyone's guess, and we should hope it's interesting.  FWIW, I don't think the next LOTRO should be a corporate owned property, because no for-profit venture has the mountains of free time that not-for-profit public community efforts can put together.  Linux is the operating system made by the public, the time spent is truly staggering, and the result is far beyond what any company could accomplish on their own.  Now look at LOTRO, look at the time we are all willing to spend.  We should be creating and fine tuning content, making it perfect, instead of bitching about the limited for-profit content from one limited company.  We The People are the only people with the time to make a truly vast and epic game that can last longer than a single company's profit cycle.  LOTRO by Turbine was a first (or maybe second) generation MMO, standing proud with WOW and others.  What will future generations bring?  What will be possible with vastly more powerful computers?  What games would truly never get tired after many years of play, even decades?  I want a Middle Earth I can visit for decades to come, and a place where many others will also come, so that we can grow old together in magic.  The current LOTRO is good, but not that good, and we need to be honest about it, and brave with our imaginations of what comes next.  I think that only we who are truly in love with Middle Earth, working together en masse, can possibly create such a game."

Here are her other posts from farther down the thread:   I know there are reports of lag on Brandywine especially in the PVMP areas. I play on Brandywine and do not experience these issues, but I may not be playing in the areas, at the times players are running into problems. So I am gathering info on that to determine if we have an issue on that particular server that might be made worse by moving more players to it before we improve our hardware infrastructure. Yes hardware can affect performance and newer hardware and a better location could do improve upon latency. Player population is not always the cause for latency.  What I dont want to do is make everyone's experience worse in the meantime.   As for free transfers after improvements are made. Yes, after we improve the transfer process the plan is to keep transfers to the most populated servers free for some time to allow players to move over to those servers using the new tools. How long those will remain free is still to be determined.   .   This  If your server is ever closed, you will always have the option to move characters from that server to another open world for free. But transfers between already high populated worlds may not remain free, as we do not want to encourage a constant hoping back and forth between servers.  As for character items, we are working on making sure everything your character or account has will move with you. There may be some edge-case items that will come out in testing, but we will have a clear listing of what those items are.   .

My understanding is that name conflicts = you get a -1 after your name.  I.E. ""Fishbert-1"". There's something in the Q&A, though, about getting a token in your inventory after you xfer that lets you completely rename if you do get a -1.  I can't confirm as Fishbert apparently wasn't taken, and my main, Elbineezescrooge...well, what are the chances anyone else is using that haha.

lotro,2t37rc,Niwre,1 point,Thu Jan 22 18:22:51 2015 UTC,"Cool... There had been speculation that more robust hardware was coming. That will be cool. One thing to consider is whether there will be downtime associated with moving to the new hardware. In theory this can be done with minimal or zero downtime, but from experience Turbine often takes longer to do scheduled upgrades than planned. It might be worth it to wait until hardware moves are complete to avoid downtime."

lotro,2t1ku9,Mardoo,6,Tue Jan 20 12:03:49 2015 UTC,"Red line will get you some big crits, plus some improved dps. But your pet, the bog guardian, definitely benefits from blue line. I am by no means a pro at LM so you might want to wait for someone better qualified to weigh in, but I tend to switch back and forth between blue and red with few problems. Blue for skirmishes or when fighting larger numbers of enemies at once, and red for most of the solo stuff."
lotro,2t1ku9,ChriosM,3,Tue Jan 20 15:27:53 2015 UTC,"I just went from L1-L100 back in November/December, so much of it is fresh in my mind.  I was red line for most of my solo run, the crits overall made it the right choice for most of the content. Yellow did nothing for me, tho if you start running with groups it may be much better. Whenever I couldn't beat a boss, like a few instanced spots in the HD XPAC, I would switch to blue spec and rely on the capskill which summons a gazillion animals and they literally destroy whatever I point at. I could have sat on Blue all the time, but I found it removed all challenge, so stuck with what felt more appropriate on red.  When you are much higher level, you can unlock the bottom few skills in red and keep blu, or vice versa, and get your skill induction times down to almost nothing, as there are multiple induction-reducing skills. Enjoy!"
lotro,2t1ku9,xKINGMOBx,1 point,Tue Jan 20 15:55:15 2015 UTC,"thanks bro :D hit level 30 today and i'm sticking with blue for now, I'm mostly chilling anyways and don't really need a challenge for now. It's getting harder though, but I can solo 2 elites with ease, which is nice.  But which skills do I spec into? do you have any advice on how to spend my points?"

lotro,2t1ku9,olddaad,1 point,Tue Jan 20 17:55:58 2015 UTC,"I've done a Blue spec to 100 and am working on another currently at 58. I've tried Red spec on both but find Blue to be the more powerful. Two skills really make the difference, +3 levels for pet at level 58 and Sic' Em at late 50's to early 60's. Although I find Red okay, it doesn't make for the best fighting partnership with the companion. The Blue arrangement of damage from Pet and debuff from player is simply magic in my eyes. Sic Em' is the one fail safe skill that can bail the player out of almost all tough situations and is the most fun skill in the game for all classes."

lotro,2t09xf,chillypup,9,Tue Jan 20 02:32:41 2015 UTC,The inevitable conclusion reached every time this topic comes up in world chat is that the best class is whichever one you enjoy playing the most.
lotro,2t09xf,krackalackle,5,Tue Jan 20 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"Warden, purely because it is so different to other mmo classes! I love the gambit system, it feels like I'm playing Tekken while grinding out deeds, and makes the combat seem more fast paced."
lotro,2t09xf,bobothetractor,5,Tue Jan 20 02:47:36 2015 UTC,"Warden, because they are highly interactive instead of pressing various abilities over and over. Their survivability in a lot of cases that they shouldn't live is good too."
lotro,2t09xf,xKINGMOBx,5,Tue Jan 20 04:44:50 2015 UTC,"If people keep downvoting harmless topics like this, you will never have a decent subreddit community here. Just saying."
lotro,2t09xf,Arathaert,2,Tue Jan 20 16:04:42 2015 UTC,"I'd agree with mycakeday - it differs from person to person. My hands-down favorite is guardian. Besides the role of protector, the survivability if well-played is through the roof. I've seen guards solo Helegrod Spider Wing and hardly break a sweat. Tanking is tons of fun. DPS (if you understand the bleed system and copy mechanics) is oodles of fun to optimize ... pulling 15+ mobs and being just fine is my idea of a Middle-earth good time.  That being said, I also love minstrel. Healing your buds and/or calling down satellite beams from above to completely nuke things... another idea of Middle-earth fun. :)  I think the answer really is up to the player."
lotro,2t09xf,cazama1,2,Tue Jan 20 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"In every game, I find that I most enjoy myself bashing people over the head with a big sword.  Champ for me, but I know it's not the best class.  The thing about MMO's you need multiple people for the more difficult content.  I think questing is fine solo, everyone has their own pace and often that pace doesn't match other peoples.  Champ is good for solo, good mix of survivability and damage.  Warden is probably an even better mix, just not my cup of tea."
lotro,2t09xf,Hyoss,1 point,Wed Jan 21 16:07:14 2015 UTC,"I sincerely hope there is no answer to this, because if one class is vastly better than the others something is wrong with the game."
lotro,2t09xf,dr_amy_bishop,0,Thu Jan 22 08:11:57 2015 UTC,I hate to break it to you but Warden exists.
lotro,2t09xf,Hyoss,1 point,Mon Mar 16 19:27:04 2015 UTC,"Is this from a PvMP and/or soloing perspective? Because at least all PvE content can be completed with the other classes as easily as well, and that might be why I have not noticed any discrepancies."
lotro,2t09xf,dr_amy_bishop,1 point,Tue Mar 17 09:32:00 2015 UTC,"Soloing, I tried soloing as a few other classes and they were all significantly more difficult. Especially Hunter, Hunter was like a nightmare of getting stomped on constantly."
lotro,2t09xf,Zzzlol94,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"To start off, it's like discussing what's better, an apple or a banana (obviously an apple).  I have a Captain as a main, primary things to do are, some DPS, Healing/Revealing Mark, Buffs and can be traited to be a potential wipe saver with In Harm's Way and Last Stand, with the in-combat revive. That makes it an important and a good class, as doing its roles correctly can make things a bit easier for the others in the group, but you can say that about most classes.  But the best class is Warden. If you know how to play a Warden extremely well, you can do almost anything, it seems like. I still haven't spent time getting my Warden up in level, but that's because I feel I need to dedicate my time to only playing Warden to really enjoy it. Remembering the most important gambits, using the correct gambits and never stop pressing those buttons.  As an honorable mention, playing my RK is the most fun I have. Just tons of DPS, levelling up never goes slowly. In fact, I have two RKs, just because it's just loads of fun. Except when I'm on a war-steed. Then it's absolutely miserable and wish I could use my Captain instead."

In more difficult situations, Champ can go yellow line for AoE (or Blue line for tank if need be) while Mini heals. In most landscape situations, you can both go damage for some quick killing. For three man instances, you can take on pretty much anyone else as your third."

He is tough and aggressive.  His character is a warden.    Another friend is a senior in college, future law student, very analytical and independent.  He is a hunter.    One high school senior is an introverted tomboy, into hiking and camping, and looks a lot like her elf champion.    Another friend is a half-crazy bush pilot who is up for anything and tries all the insane stuff you wish you could do.  His character is a rune-keeper.

lotro,2szngg,Arathaert,2,Tue Jan 20 05:45:35 2015 UTC,"I would pick both melee or ranged classes.  Combinations could be:    Hunter+Lore Master Minstrel+Hunter Minstrel+Lore Master Captain+Champion Captain+Guardian Guardian+Champion Guardian+Burglar Burglar+Captain Champion+Burglar   I think combinations should send you off to a good start.

lotro,2szngg,Arathaert,6,Mon Jan 19 23:50:48 2015 UTC,"You'll need the Moria xpac for Warden and RK  Guardian and Mini is great except for one thing... whoever's playing the guardian will rarely actually hit anything during questing. Mini dps is high enough that it can nuke most anything in 2-3 hits for half the game. Add to that the fact that they're ranged and the guard might might get one or two hits in before the mob is dead.  It's absolutely doable, and - as a guard myself - if I wanted one companion to go do something tough as **** with, I'd pick mini. But for smooth leveling where both of you get a good feel for your class?  Ranged and melee combos might be a bit rough."

Then you go to Evendim, which will get you at least to 40-42. From there you can do the epic quests to get the last couple of levels needed to get to Moria. IIRC, you can start the epic quests that unlock Moria at level 44, and none of them are particularly difficult if you are careful.  Don't forget, you can also do a few skirmishes for XP/deeds/TP, there will always be festivals popping up that give XP as well, and if you work on leveling your creating you'll have more than enough XP to get there without buying Angmar/Forochel/Trollshaws our any of the usual suspects.  Also, don't forget to do tasks along the way.  Just save your vendor trash/task items and turn in your daily limit while you're in the zone.  There's a lot of experience to be had there as well.

I'm almost certain that I did something for the Book 2 prologue when I was 44 on the last toon that I took through there.  I know that the quests and everything in the Walls of Moria was red to me at the time, but that could have been a 5 level gap as well as a 6.  I distinctly remember going as soon as the quests were available though because I wanted to get my start LIs done as soon as possible."

lotro,2sy5gd,cyanpill,2,Mon Jan 19 21:43:34 2015 UTC,I'm kinda in a crossroads myself now. I got naturally from the starter zones Shire -> Breeland -> Lone-lands and bought the Steely Dawn Starter pack for some TP and the Evendim Quest pack for cheap. I'm level 40 now and it feels like Angmar is the place to go until I get straight to Moria. So if I buy the quad pack I would only need to buy Angmar with TP.
lotro,2sy5gd,Akul5b,2,Mon Jan 19 18:18:17 2015 UTC,"Aye.  Be aware there are a lot of fellowship quests.  You can try to get some people to help (joining a kin is nice for this, a high level might come help you and just clean house for you), or just skip them.  There are a lot of solo quests as well."
lotro,2sy5gd,cazama1,2,Mon Jan 19 19:48:39 2015 UTC,"As far as the bare minimum, I would say Evendim and Angmar. If you really do every quest possible within 9 levels in the free areas, you can get up to about level 35-36 before having to leave the Lone Lands. Evendim is for levels 30-40, so you can be in the low 40s before going to Angmar, which will take you to into the 50s and ready for Moria.   If you are on a really tight budget, you could conceivably just get Angmar. You could grind up skirmishes/GA and GB instances to get you to the high 30s, and then do every possible quest in Angmar and get through the Epic Line to Moria."
lotro,2sy5gd,fadhero,2,Mon Jan 19 16:54:59 2015 UTC,"No, evendim is better, it really is trust me ive tried"
lotro,2sy5gd,TheBadgerOnCrack,2,Mon Jan 19 21:00:20 2015 UTC,"Angmar can be pretty brutal. But since the Epic line takes you through anyway, it can be easier to hit those quests hubs along the way. I've never tried skipping Angmar, but it seems like one could make it work.   With Angmar, you get access to the Rift raids, and Carn Dum and Urugarth Instances. Not a bad investment IMHO."
lotro,2sy5gd,fadhero,2,Mon Jan 19 21:50:11 2015 UTC,"I did this exactly.  It requires a small bit of grinding but that's what slayer deeds are for, right?"
lotro,2sy5gd,derpstrike,2,Mon Jan 19 21:53:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say the other way around. Buy Evendim and milk Annuminas for as long as possible, until maybe level 43 or 44 when the rate of return drops precipitously. Then catch up with the Epic line and the class item quests before going into Sarnur and increasing reputation with Thorin's Hall to Kindred so you can get your full-speed goat before stepping through Durin's Door.   There's a lot more to do in the game between 44 and 50 (True novices shouldn't be going into Moria for the first time before 50 unless they are that damn good.) than there is between 34 and 39. So Evendim is a much better option if you can only buy a single zone."
lotro,2sy5gd,porpoiseoflife,2,Tue Jan 20 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"I'd absolutely 100% agree with this... Evendim is all you need, really. Between that and the epics and Sarnur, I got my first character to 44, got my LIs and hopped straight into Moria.  (Mebbe I'm just that damn good? :P lol I doubt it)  But GET THAT GOAT!! You'll want it for sure."

lotro,2syhyn,ThePhantomguy,3,Mon Jan 19 18:22:23 2015 UTC,"Just curious what level are you and how many points do you have to spend?  Yellow line is all about fighting multiple enemies.  You want to be pulling as many as you can handle then taking care of business.  In that way you might be easily overwhelmed with the damage you are taking.  So what does a Champ do?  DEAL MORE DAMAGE!    For yellow line I would max blade wall damage (quick cooldown, doesn't use fervor), raging blade damage, blade skill damage, and might.  Obviously you want the fervor traits so you can use your bigger hits more often.  Anything that improves rend is nice (b/c damage over time from bleeding). The higher tier traits aren't that appealing to me (finesse, % chance to bypass mitigations).  Horn of Gondor damage, at a cost of 5 fervor and only 3 sec stun, I only rarely use it. Great cleave really only seems worth it if you can max the damage from battle acuity (increase your AoE damage with great cleave active).  Great cleave has a short duration and long cooldown.  Kind of annoying for solo play.    I am less of a fan of traits that ""give you a 10% chance of ...""  They are important for instances when you are fighting a lot of mobs, but I would prefer the sure thing damage or mitigations.  After lvl 50 or so I pretty much stopped using yellow line because of the unattractive higher traits, and mobs seemed more spread out, so it was better to go red line and kill each single one quicker than trying to make a decent pull for the AoE.  That is my play style though.  I am finding going blue is nice at higher levels because you can get some good traits so you can solo some of the ""small fellowship"" bosses.  I am only lvl 67 though, so there are probably much more experienced people to give opinions."
lotro,2syhyn,cazama1,3,Mon Jan 19 23:19:05 2015 UTC,"I personally have no clue :P  My champ is sitting patiently at lvl 12 waiting for me to level him.

After that, someone else who might be able to help is Bludborn - he's a streamer on Twitch who (along with meself and quite a few others) streams lotro on a regular basis. He mains a champ and I'm sure would be happy to answer any questions you might have. Tell him Arathaert sent ya. :)"
lotro,2syhyn,Arathaert,2,Tue Jan 20 06:00:03 2015 UTC,"I started the game a few weeks ago, casually playing with friends. I'm level 25 now."
lotro,2syhyn,cazama1,2,Tue Jan 20 00:21:07 2015 UTC,"You'll get a feel for it as you go.  You probably have like 10 pts to spend, I'd get battle frenzy if you think you could use more fervor.  Fill up the +might as that will affect all attacks, but make sure to get raging blade as that will be one of your main attacks. Then put whatever is left into blade wall."
lotro,2sxk3b,Vantezzle,5,Mon Jan 19 13:11:14 2015 UTC,"I just started aswell, and got the following. I belive its right?  If you have a VIP subscription, you only need:  Quad pack: http://store.steampowered.com/app/258800/ Helm's deep: http://store.steampowered.com/app/258803/  The safest way for vip/tp, I belive must be: http://www.lotro.com/en  That should give you content for levels: 1-50 (VIP) 50-60 (Mines of Moria, part of quad pack) 60-65 (Siege of Mirkwood, part of quad pack) 65-75 (Rise of Isengard, part of quad pack) 75-85 (Riders of Rohan, part of quad pack) 85-100 (Helm's deep?)"
lotro,2sxk3b,Haltemien,3,Mon Jan 19 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"i'd advise:  (1) not paying anything until you reach the end of the lone lands content, say roughly level 32;  (2) then going VIP for a single month - this will unlock some very useful stuff like being able to hodl unlimited gold & having 'swift travel's between regions, also it'll enable you to continue levelling in Evendim, Trollshaws, Angmar, & so on; (3) after your VIP month expires [or you level to the point where you want to enter Moria, whichever happens first] kind of taking stock, see how much you like the game & so on, maybe ask again on here what'd be a good thing to do next. the quad pack posted earlier looks like a decent option."

In general, store exclusives are either cosmetic or quality of life improvements. In addition, every account gets one free Hobbit Present per server per day that can contain store-exclusive items, regardless of whether it's free, premium, or VIP. VIPs also get an additional, generally higher-quality present."

lotro,2sxk3b,outbound_flight,3,Mon Jan 19 15:31:50 2015 UTC,"LOTRO's main attractions are the world/back story, and the in-game music system. It also has one of the best F2P models I've ever seen.  Before you throw a lot of money at the game, I'd recommend playing it for a while. Buying a few Turbine points might not be a bad idea to move your account to premium status (a few less restrictions) but you can certainly play the game without ever paying a dime. If it's not for you, it's not for you. If it is, welcome to the fun!"
lotro,2sxk3b,Arathaert,1 point,Mon Jan 19 15:48:24 2015 UTC,"Definitely still active across a number of servers, but Landroval and Brandywine are probably the most populated out of the bunch.

Wait til they go on sale on steam though - you can pick them both up for $20 total. I do VIP, and I like it. I don't have to worry about joining in something 'cause I don't have that quest pack. And I can drop into pvp if I feel like it. And swift travel is nice too. But, more importantly for me, I'm supporting a game I love. The game is certainly active!! Lots of quite populated servers, and the community is growing, I think. In just the past few months, for example, the LOTRO community on twitch.tv has grown from just a few to over a dozen regular streamers of the game (myself included). If you have any questions, stop by twitch.tv/arathaert and if anyone's streaming LOTRO, I'll be hosting it. :) Safest way is via the official store on lotro.com. That being said, you absolutely can buy TP codes on places like g2a.com.  VIP though, can only be bought via the official website.   Hope that helps!"
lotro,2sxnl1,Crash665,2,Mon Jan 19 13:56:19 2015 UTC,"It's much faster and easier than in old times. Most of zones (and all the epic story) can be soloed. Even without XP boost you can progress quite fast.  However, the game is definitely huge (level 60 means end of Lorien, after that you still have Mirkwood / Enedwaidth / Dunland / Isen / Great River / East and West Rohan / West and Central Gondor) - So the 60->100 part can be quite long."

lotro,2sxnl1,Arathaert,1 point,Mon Jan 19 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"Short answer is yes - it's easier than it used to be.  Long answer - it can take as long as you want it to. If you go slowly, enjoy the scenery, read the quests, take your time... I recently got to 100 in over 5 weeks of in-game time, spread out over 3 years in RL. I then took a mini to lvl 30 in 6 hours.

lotro,2sxnl1,Botsji,0,Mon Jan 19 17:16:25 2015 UTC,"It really comes down to the player. You can take months-years if you read through the quests and follow the story, or as I did it: powerlevel with xp boosts (took under 24 hours to lvl 100). They revamped alot of zones to make the lvling more smooth though, and it seems to be easier to solo. You don't need a group to level at all either, since theres not that much group content anymore. How long it will take comes down to if you follow the story or just rush through the quests with a good flow. Also how much you play and how efficient you quest, and if you use xp-boosts. From 19-60 I'd say a couple of weeks if you play a good amount daily. :)"

Basically, the only thing that is even semi-official is that they are working on ways to improve server transfers so you don't have to give up certain things in the transfer process (shared storage, etc).

Only reason I would advise against Brandywine is that - in my experience - it seems to have a disproportionate number of griefers and folks prejudiced against newcomers in chat.  I play on Gladden and thoroughly enjoy it. Landroval also has a fantastic community.  If you'd like to get an idea of what the game's like now, you can always check it out on twitch.

I will say that both make great tanks, but that Guardians are prolly a better option if things go south fast. Wardens rely on threat over time, while Guards can instantly pull things to them and make 'em stick.  Also heavy armour ftw! :D Not too familiar with the EU servers.

lotro,2stieb,Darchseraph,5,Sun Jan 18 09:40:28 2015 UTC,"This looks quite solid to me.  The main thing with five characters, is that you'll be missing out on guild access for two professions as each character can only join one guild. This means there will be some recipes, you won't have access to, mainly connected with Legendary Items. Hardly a reason to scrap your setup, but you'll have to pick between Scholar's and Weaponsmiths guilds with your Historian.  To get all, you would need 7 characters.  There are titles connected with all tiers and with both proficiency and mastery of every trade. However, they're mostly pure generic titles on the form of name, the artisan jeweller.  The exception is some newish titles added for the vocations (Explorer, Historian, etc.) you get from completing all three introduction quests of your chosen professions. Those can be good, ie. ""Easily Lost"" for Explorer. Being the introduction quests, you won't really be locking yourself out of doing these by not levelling a profession.  One thing, though. If you want to earn more than one of those titles on one character, do so before you level up any of your crafting on that character as you'll have to switch vocation to get them. (I'm fairly certain you won't lose the previous title when switching, but I can't find confirmation of that)  As to your second question, no, you won't be limited or missing out on anything, save convenience. As long as you're willing to swap characters during crafting sessions, you should be covered. There are a few gathering recipes, mainly bulk conversions, that are still locked to mastery, but otherwise, this'll be a non-issue.   Making them able to grab resources during play by getting them proficiency level is easy, though."
lotro,2stieb,Cyrilion,3,Sun Jan 18 10:23:12 2015 UTC,"If you are ever going to play the secondary characters, you might as well max out their gathering skills, even if it's a duplicate, because you can snarf resources while playing them"
lotro,2stieb,DiscoJer,1 point,Sun Jan 18 10:15:50 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""snarf resources""?  I intend to get them to proficiency so they can continue to grab gather resources as they level but it seems to me that Mastery is only needed for a chance to crit while processing raw materials, which I can easily transfer to my ""main"" crafter of that profession to do right?  Getting each gathering tier to full Mastery takes  a lot of gathering and running around unless I'm willing to pay TP for lots of Craft XP boosts or something."
lotro,2stieb,exploderator,2,Sun Jan 18 17:22:01 2015 UTC,"Getting each gathering tier to full Mastery takes a lot of gathering and running around unless I'm willing to pay TP for lots of Craft XP boosts or something.   I disagree.  It actually happens pretty fast in the longer view (weeks), considering we play this game for years.   And if you have gold, you can usually buy raw materials on the auction house, often for cheap, and bulk processes your way in no time.  Also, you might have friends that will send you the random materials they gather and do not need, and processing them ads up quickly.  The one thing that actually takes a while is earing crafting guild reputation, because you have to make the small/medium/large guild items, and they are on cooldowns that can't be shortened, it just takes time.  Having said all that, if you're shooting for maximum productivity, then of course you only need one master in each craft.  I only have an historian, which does all it's own processing as well as the crafting.  I did do my farming, so that I could get special ingredients for making dyes, but farming is a super easy grind, that only needs a little gold to buy all the supplies, so it almost doesn't count.  If I had a cook+farmer, I obviously would not have bothered farming on the historian at all, considering it's only barely of use anyways (I don't actually make many dyes).  PS.  Black dye is a top auction seller.  Your ore mining and processing will sometimes give you iron oxide and other rare ingredients for dye making.  Keep them for your historian, don't mistake them for vendor trash."

lotro,2st6a7,falucedelefan,2,Sun Jan 18 07:26:31 2015 UTC,"It was most likely ABC playing - it involves getting an abc music file, saving it with a .abc file extension in a folder titled ""Music"" in your lotro folder in your documents folder, then opening it up in game... the Songbook plugin is super handy for that.  But... yes, I believe you could theoretically play on a midi keyboard. You'd have to connect it to your pooter and set the keybinds in the game to those notes though. I've never seen it done but I'm sure it'd be possible somehow."
lotro,2st6a7,Arathaert,3,Sun Jan 18 10:40:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah. It may be possible to bind the MIDI keys directly in-game, or else find something that would convert MIDI notes into mappable buttons a la HOTAS flight sticks. I'm not entirely sure how feasible this is.  Otherwise, you'd need to remap your MIDI keyboard's keys to match the keys used in-game. I'm quite certain you could find third-party software to do this, though I don't know any off-hand."

I recall hearing about this relationship before, not knowing the source, so I just took this as confirmation.  Apparently, Tolkien actually commented on this exact thing, explaining that Treebeard was a character, not Tolkien, and that he wasn't right about everything. Funny for Treebeard to say that though since it's certainly misleading, having established that he's living in Middle-Earth for eons and very knowledgeable about his surroundings, in particular elves since those were who made Ents into who they are.  Since it's a rejected idea, I have a feeling that this is a case of retconning by Tolkien."

Some constructive criticism: I wish the facecam would stop jumping around the screen, it was really distracting for me. I also found it to be a bit too large for my taste. My personal view on the subject of First Age Symbols is that I don't have an issue with it, because of the massive grind needed to actually get there, which brings me to my next point... I used to be really into raiding. I was actually a pretty decent captain back in the day. The problem is that with the lack of new raiding content over the last couple years, most if not all of the people who I used to raid with have moved on from LOTRO. I no longer have a group to run large-group content with on a regular schedule, but the raider and completionist within me still wants some way to get a first age symbol.

This game has accumulated a lot of micromanagement and microgrinding, both in LI exp and high level crafting, which is just a lot of pointless trashmaking since no-one wants to use standard weapons any more.  If LIs had a system similar to Inspiration in the earlier books, making them stronger in times of dire need or under the inspiration of others. And by this I mean LI have less stats in solo but growing in power with great buffs while in a fellowship/instance/PvMP. Then there would be great incentive to use and trade standard weapons more regularly out of instances. And it would also give ""hardcores"" a better feeling of special treatment, because it wouldn't matter that you get a good LI on random solo drops or barter, what would matter is that their true power is revealed while IN the raids. They would have to invent an improved dummy system which activates these, to allow people to train their raid rotations, though."

Basically, instead of wanting to do a lot of work of merging the smaller servers together, Turbine finds it easier to just process the handful requests of the people still playing their game rather than transfer thousands and thousands of characters to one server for a server merge (which is what should've happened in this game long ago if they ever wanted to keep up the appearance that it is still floating rather than floundering)."

lotro,2sj29b,Daemien67,11,Fri Jan 16 12:23:11 2015 UTC,"Sorry if there's a chance you might lose your favorite name.  But do you understand how your concern seems a little petty to easily many thousands of players who wish for a more lively game?  We are quitting in droves for lack of community.  If the only reason you would leave is the exact spelling of your name, then I'm afraid most of us are going to find ourselves lacking sympathy for your case, and indeed will think you sound increasingly like a whiner.  I'm honestly not trying to be mean.  I wish you would be excited at the idea that maybe we get a chance to play together and have fun.  But when you drag out this hangup of yours about your name, every single time anyone brings up server merges, it gets a little tired."
lotro,2sj29b,epicman107,1 point,Mon Jan 19 18:48:56 2015 UTC,"I have 0 interest in playing with other people for the sake of community, I already have my community on my server which still managers to do regular raids and has PuGs. ""Merges"" (or forced moves in this case) do not build community. People having a passion for the game and enjoying playing it with others is what works. But you take people who have passion for the game, like me, and do something that drives them away, you end up with lesser community. It may seem counter intuitive, but every MMO I've ever played lived an died by it's hardcore player base (more-so true for F2P MMOs), and every MMO that I've ever played that merged servers and did what you may call petty, drove away this player base. While my one thing may be petty it is also a key component that makes me want to play this game like any other RPG. Take that away and I leave (and I'm not the only one) then that is some amount of money that Turbine loses. This is one of many issues that people have, this has been reflected on the official forums in droves already.  Call it petty or short sighted, but I challenge to go look at my past posting record here. I am anything but a doom-sayer, or a ranter against Turbine. But I have my criteria, I've had is since Beta. Want proof of how much this matters?  Here is a post from almost 3 years ago:   https://www.lotro.com/en/forums/showthread.php?452168-Happy-Anniversary-Lotro!-an-open-letter-to-Turbine&p=6077835  In it I talk about how getting my characters name was a part of this game for me. The thing is; I'm not the only one, MANY people have brought up this issue as well, some much more vitriolic that I am. But when people get excited for this change, they need to realized that these merges will do jack if it just causes people to leave.  I want this game to succeed, I want to see more of middle-earth, I have concerns that if done incorrectly this will do nothing but damage the game, it's income, it's community, etc. Even if my server comes through this fine and I'm happy and keep playing, there are going to be people who leave for similar reason due to their server shutting down, and it can kill it.  On the flip side I can see why people on super small server would want this, I just don't sympathize with the desire to have these merges affect me and my community. If people want a more lively game community then they should step up and make it more lively."
lotro,2sj29b,epicman107,1 point,Thu Jan 15 17:45:39 2015 UTC,"Thank you for a considerate reply.  I appreciate keeping this a civil discussion.  Please understand that my comments here are meant to be honest.  My words are an attempt at unshielded emotion, I'm not trying to shit on you, or insult or hurt you.  I appreciate your longstanding and deep commitment to LOTRO, and I hope my honesty here can compliment a solid discussion, because hiding our real feelings only creates division in the end, and genuine community is what we need here.   I already have my community on my server which still managers to do regular raids and has PuGs.   So you're saying you have yours, and that's all you care about?  How charitable of you?  Too bad that's very much not the case for huge numbers of players, especially newer ones, and on low population servers.  I'm part time leader of a kin, the ""Random Invitation Kinship"".  We manage to snag a lot of new and/or lost players, and we're trying to build something good.  But just as the OP was talking about, you need population density to make stuff work and thrive.  There are not enough people to make the AH work properly on my server, not enough crafters, not enough people doing any particular instance, or even anywhere near it.  I've been around long enough to know the difference, as have you.  But you know what?  There are dozens of newer players I've met that have no idea how vibrant the game can be, because they never got to see it thrive.  They have no idea, they just think it's kind of lame and lonely, and have little idea why all that stuff exists, when they can never use it anyways.  I've got a lot of missing players between level 40 and level 80, several pages on my kin list.  People that left, even though they loved Middle Earth, because ultimately LOTRO is no longer thriving, and it fails to be a compelling experience for a huge number of people when you drop that first M from MMO.  I worry about that being a huge amount of lost income for the game.  The impression I have, after also having been in tight-knit older kins myself, is that your happy little bubble is simply not representative of the broader experience.  The broader experience is underpopulated servers, that leave a huge number of players lonely, un-connected, and unable to experience a lot of the content.  You need to prepare yourself for making this game back into a game that works for people who didn't manage to get themselves permanently established several years ago, back when there must have been well over 5 or 10 times the total population than what we have now.  For all your talk about Turbine needing your money, the fact is it needs a lot of new player's money too, and we've been shedding that far too fast with ghost town servers.  I'm willing to make sacrifices for that, not just sit in an insulated cocoon and hope nothing ever changes.   I just don't sympathize with the desire to have these merges affect me and my community.   That's not what anyone wants, we are not hoping to see you deprived of anything.  But changes are needed, and you may need to make sacrifices for them, just as many others surely will, and as so many other people already make sacrifices because we don't already have those changes.  Your stated unwillingness to have any compromise, because you are so attached, mostly just sounds selfish, and a lot of us are inclined to say get over it, and support the community when it needs it, if you want anything left at all.     If people want a more lively game community then they should step up and make it more lively.   Fuck you?  What do you think we're trying to do?  The funny thing is, it doesn't work very well when the servers are half empty.  We try, but our hands our tied, because the game is far below the critical population density needed for it to thrive.  And when we suggest ways to hopefully make a more lively game community even possible, all you do is tell us you'll quit if it affects you in the slightest.  Instead of telling us how little you will quit for, why don't you tell us how much you're willing to help to keep LOTRO alive and thriving.  From where I sit, you're the one not stepping up here."

lotro,2sigtl,imjustafangirl,4,Thu Jan 15 13:36:55 2015 UTC,"There is another option if you want to wait until the currency unlocks go on sale again.  When you talk to the folks who give you vault access, they also have a ""Store""/option where they sell items that sell for the same price you can purchase them for. I BELIEVE they're meant for transferring gold amongst characters on your account (server), but they should also work as an effective gold sink until you unlock the currency cap.  I don't know yet if they stack, but this is my intended approach for my F2P alt accounts.  Another, riskier approach is to buy stacks of stuff off the auction house at a discount, and hold on to them until later.  And of course, you should buy storage upgrades with gold as much as possible before sinking TP into it. A house and a house chest should be obtainable even on your limited budget, and then the gold sink items I mentioned above will allow transferring cash amongst your characters (housing storage is the poor man's shared storage.)"
lotro,2sigtl,JKtheSlacker,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"Yes, exactly!"
lotro,2sigtl,CharmingJack,3,Thu Jan 15 13:39:32 2015 UTC,"I often recommend that you wait until things go on sale before buying them with TP. Here's how to work around that:   As you've noticed, Starter Packs that give account-wide riding skills are given away often enough (twice this month that I've seen!) One of the items you can get from the daily hobbit presents, is the Universal Toolkit for crafting. This takes patience! (I have exactly one - which is technically enough, since it's account-bound!) I mentioned this above, but there are items that act as gold sinks. You'll get piles of scrap from the daily hobbit present that are solely meant to be sold and stack in your inventory until you need them. And you can convert gold you already have into bags of coins sold by the vault-keepers. Rather than buy new character slots, save your TP for when the Mines of Moria expansion (not quest pack!) goes on sale. That'll net you two character slots per server, the warden and rune-keeper classes, and a bunch of content."

When you cash it out with litany of defiance, you get a major defensive boost along with absorbing some of the damage that your fellowship would otherwise take.  (I think)"
lotro,2sjawo,helldeskmonkey,1 point,Thu Jan 15 20:28:09 2015 UTC,"Like helldeskmonkey said, Fortification is a bonus that stacks on you when you're in blue line. It can go up to 5 tiers, for a total of +10% physical and tactical mitigation.  It is a confusing tooltip, I agree, and it has a rather niche use.  Mainly, you use it when things go south and your fellowship starts taking damage. It'll remove all your fortification stacks in exchange for you intercepting some of your fellowship's damage.  It doesn't give you a major defensive boost though - just 2% to cover your butt 'til you get your shield skills going and fortification back up again. Ideally, use it right before you run through your block chain so there’s little time where you don’t have fortification up.

lotro,2sfhyz,brokenheartedsmile,2,Thu Jan 15 01:30:11 2015 UTC,Well basically at the moment I'm traited primarily yellow.  I can keep myself alive for an insane amount of time.  Takes longer to kill things obviously but I've died less than 10 times in total and I'm at lvl 57 at the moment.  Unfortunately I'm not sure how a Beorning as the sole healer for any sort of instance run is going to work.  It's just vastly different from healing on my minstrel.  I was more looking for anything that people think is pretty handy to trait just for leveling.  I haven't done PVP in forever so I don't really need that.  I'm just looking to push to 100 and go from there.
lotro,2sfhyz,WelCZa,1 point,Thu Jan 15 14:55:12 2015 UTC,"Give blue a shot for leveling, it may do a bit more dps and you shouldnt have to worry about heal spamming so much. It has some good, low cd ""oh crap"" skills that will help you with staying alive, trait into off red for extra damage.   Healing in bear form can work, but its different, and definitely not going to replace any good mini for t2 content. It's more supplemental healing like a cappy heals with good cc (-40% outgoing dmg, fellow sprint [great for invis chicken] and then the big aoe raid wide heals)  As for what to trait for leveling i would say if youre concerned about staying alive go blue with off red. But if you're more like me and have the ""kill the enemies, dont let the enemies kill you"" policy i go full red and then some into either blue or yellow (doesnt matter too much) and things blow up real quick. Specific traits in yellow to get would be shake free for the bubble, stampede for the rush duration. Definitely make sure you max out composure in red, does a ton of healing, and in blue the extra mitigations are good, making sure to pick up thickened hide."

lotro,2s9wd4,muestack,7,Tue Jan 13 12:24:17 2015 UTC,"Well, looks like what you and your friends lack in the group is a tank so... if you decide on a Warden, it would help ease filling the rest of your fellowships in the future.  Warden (especially as a tank) is IMO probably the hardest class to master in LotRO. It relies a lot on your ""muscle memory"" to utilize your gambits properly- so I think it is best for you to train early as a Warden in skirmishes and low level instances. You'll probably got defeated a lot when compared to a Guardian because inevitably you'll be making mistakes in your gambit here and there- and not to mention a Warden does not have a lot of breathing room for mistakes when compared to other heavy armor users, but that's normal, it's part of the process of becoming a good Warden.  And I think one of the most important tip for anyone just started playing a Warden: Learn, use, and live by your Masteries. Train using the Masteries continuously until it becomes a second nature to you.  As a Burglar I'll think you'll be expected to put your Tricks / debuff(s) on the mobs, CC'ing by using Riddle, interrupting enemy cast, and whenever appropriate you'll be initiating Fellowship Maneuver.  IMO it's easier to have a mindset that a Burglar in LotRO is not an assassin class found on other MMO. Burglar instead brings a lot of utilities in a fellowship and you'll perform better in groups if you imagine your Burglar as a ""clever, witty trickster"" rather than a stab-stab-happy assassin.  Captain is awesome for groups. Since you already have a LM friend, bringing both LM and Captain in a fellowship will pretty much fill all your essential buffs and debuffs package. Captain could also fill the role of an off-tank or supporting healer.  One major complain about Captain is its apparently low damage when compared to other classes, so I think soloing as a Captain could be a little slower or boring- though nothing bringing a friend or two couldn't fix!"
lotro,2s9wd4,ray_falkner,3,Tue Jan 13 12:54:31 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your answer. It was very interesting to read! I'll have to think about it, it seems that the more I read about it the less I know which class to choose xD"
lotro,2s9wd4,Botsji,4,Tue Jan 13 13:49:38 2015 UTC,"From what I've heard warden is probably the most overpowered class right now at pretty much everything. Captain is also excellent at group-play, but maybe not so much at solo-play. I myself have a lvl 100 burglar. They are really fun, good at soloing and PvMP, but maybe not as strong in groups as a cappy or warden..."
lotro,2s9wd4,Daddyloveshunt,2,Tue Jan 13 12:30:01 2015 UTC,"Okay, I've heard similar things. So burglar falls away, because 90% of the time I play lotro, I play with them in a group, therefore it's really about the group-play.. and maybe not so much about how good they are in their role in the group but more about how much fun they are in a group."
lotro,2s9wd4,Belhaven,3,Tue Jan 13 12:45:53 2015 UTC,Warden tanks better than a cappy. If you are grouping with a hunter lm and rk you will need a tank. Then you can just pug 2 dps for 6 man content. Assuming the rk is a healer of course
lotro,2s9wd4,Belhaven,5,Tue Jan 13 13:32:47 2015 UTC,"I've got a Warden and Captain coming up right now - both in the 70s to 80s.    I think the captain is easier to play (becuase of the gambits on the warden) but the warden in tank mode is does a better job of grabbing and holding aggro on a pile of mobs.   If your friends are ok with occasionally having to deal with a mob they pulled off you for a bit - and you want a less stressful session I'd say captain. Otherwise, warden."
lotro,2s9wd4,My_feet_are_cold,2,Tue Jan 13 20:25:50 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, I think I'll go with the warden, so far i had great fun with it, was just a little bit conserned, that playing it for a long timeperiode will result in spawing the same gambits over and over at higher level, where I imagine it to be quite entertaining buffing your fellowship during instances. What do you enjoy more at the moment? Warden or Cap?"
lotro,2s9wd4,ray_falkner,3,Tue Jan 13 20:48:02 2015 UTC,"I'm enjoying the captain more because, as I said, he is easier to play.  It takes MANY more button presses/mouse clicks to finish the warden's class deeds :)"
lotro,2s9wd4,ray_falkner,4,Wed Jan 14 01:26:02 2015 UTC,Here's my two cents. Every one of your friends toons are ranged. I run a captain main and it can be frustrating as heck to play a melee toon in a group of ranged - by the time I'd run up to hit a mob it would be dead. So I'd suggest the warden because at least you can throw stuff before you close the gap.
lotro,2s9wd4,dmentia777,1 point,Wed Jan 14 02:15:22 2015 UTC,This has definitely something! Most of the time we collect as much mobs as possible and its really practical to just throw the javelin to get them to you. When we takle only few enemies I don't even bother to run to them because they die so quick ^

lotro,2s976w,Vestus65,6,Tue Jan 13 06:11:27 2015 UTC,"From personal experience, I find that Evendim is about the best place to level from lv.30.  I've taken all of my characters through half of the stretch you're worried about there (and some as early as lv.28 into Oatbarton/Northcotton Farm quests). They've even ""revamped"" it slightly by adding swift travel destinations to the docks located around the lake, so it's not nearly as cumbersome as it used to be.   If you stretch out the exp there, it can take you to lv.40-41 or so; past Evendim, you may want to look into Eregion perhaps.  The quests are a ~bit~ higher around Gwingris, but I don't foresee a cappy having terrible issue there.  Eregion can also take you well within striking distance of Moria, quite literally.      Both of those QPs also include instances with them (School/Library with Eregion - HV/OE/Glinghant with Evendim), which sweetens the deal for later on, and offers a bit more bang for your buck."
lotro,2s976w,Turthim,2,Tue Jan 13 10:04:20 2015 UTC,"Agreed with Evendim + Eregion, although there will still be a bit of an XP gap between the two. If you can spring for a third, I'd say that Misty Mountains is probably your best bet - it's still a bit sprawling and messy, but it has additional transport hubs that help a bit."
lotro,2s976w,helldeskmonkey,1 point,Tue Jan 13 15:53:13 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the replies, I did decide to get Evendim for now and it's fun so far. The Farmer's Market quests are a hoot. Looking forward to seeing what the rest of the zone is like."
lotro,2s976w,DiscoJer,6,Wed Jan 14 06:47:38 2015 UTC,"They re-did Evendim a couple years ago and did a real nice job from 30 to 41-ish.  Then recently (6 months?) they re-did the Trollshaws, North Downs, and Misty Mountains. I only did the North Downs and didn't seem to be that big a a revamp. Haven't tried the other two revamps yet, so Eregion and Forochel might be better bets (that's usually what I would do, they are both 40-ish zones)."
lotro,2s976w,notwhoithink,2,Tue Jan 13 10:50:35 2015 UTC,"Evendim + Eregion + the epic quest line will get you from low 30's (when you finish Lone Lands) to mid 40's (when you can start Moria), no problem. And you really wouldn't need much of Eregion, TBH."
lotro,2s976w,MessyR,3,Wed Jan 14 12:35:02 2015 UTC,"Depending how much you can stretch out Evendim, Ram Duath and Angmar are excellent areas to level in, Angmar more so with the instances it has, you will easily get over level 50, then you can hit Eregion and Moria which is easy and enjoyable since the revamp."
lotro,2s976w,reddownthere,3,Tue Jan 13 10:16:36 2015 UTC,"Misty Mountains is kinda good now. Did a bit of Angmar, and it seems a bit improved, but not that much. Haven't touched Trollshaws, but it seems better too, with some more stablemasters thrown in there."
lotro,2s976w,dria,1 point,Tue Jan 13 13:29:28 2015 UTC,"When were the Misty Mountains redone? I blew through them on an alt maybe 8 months ago and I didn't notice any differences, but I really cleared out of there quickly."
lotro,2s976w,reddownthere,3,Tue Jan 13 13:36:14 2015 UTC,I think someone said that some zones were redone like 6ish months back. It might have been right after you did it.
lotro,2s976w,notwhoithink,3,Wed Jan 14 03:03:29 2015 UTC,The changes were relatively minor. Most of it was creating an extra quest hub just north of the Dourhand fortifications and adding more travel routes.  The changes to the Trollshaws were in a similar vein.
lotro,2s87ro,rconiv,6,Tue Jan 13 00:50:04 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the game!  As a new player, you don't quite have the grind ahead of you that players used to have. Turbine semi-recently (before my time) reworked some of the zones so that the game scales better and doesn't require as much time to get to max level. But as it is, there are still 100 levels and LotRO is a massive game with lots to do. If max level is your priority, it shouldn't take you any longer than it would in WoW--but I would definitely recommend that you take it easy and enjoy the ride.  I only started playing about a year ago, and we still get lots of new players, so you'll be in good company.  VIP is definitely something to consider. I'd personally recommend that you play the game until level 30 with a F2P account and see how you like it, and check out everything you have available. Then, if you enjoy yourself, consider going VIP for a month to get yourself through the base game and into the expansion content. You also get some cool permanent unlocks for subscribing. When you get to the expansions, you won't really need to subscribe again unless you want to support the devs."
lotro,2s87ro,outbound_flight,3,Tue Jan 13 01:08:42 2015 UTC,"Another thing, does all the things available to buy get less confusing?"
lotro,2s87ro,JKtheSlacker,1 point,Tue Jan 13 01:23:01 2015 UTC,"They do. My advice for now would be to never buy anything that's not on sale. Casual Stroll to Mordor used to do recommendation posts for the various sale items - dunno if those are still out there, but they were really good.  You also have the option of asking us what's worth buying. By limiting yourself to only what's on sale, that will help the confusion level."
lotro,2s87ro,MessyR,2,Wed Jan 14 18:15:08 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot for the answers, level 100 is a goal I'm considering. I'm really enjoying the game just making sure there is still a good player base."
lotro,2s87ro,Botsji,2,Tue Jan 13 01:18:41 2015 UTC,"Just remember, powerlevelling is good to miss out the older content, however Evendim, trollshaws and North Downs are now very nice quest areas, the flow is excellent.  Power levelling stops you boosting your virtures and once you hit Rohan you need to quest to pick up trait points.  I wouldnt powerlevel, the older SoA content is amazing, as are the SoA epic book quests, dont miss them out.  Its a great story."
lotro,2s87ro,Eslader,2,Tue Jan 13 08:56:57 2015 UTC,If you really want to you can hit lvl 100 in about 30 hours with powerlvling/xp boost/gift of valar.
lotro,2s87ro,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Tue Jan 13 12:25:26 2015 UTC,"What server? I'm surprised you're not seeing lower level characters. They just introduced a new class (Beorning) so a lot of us are running new alts through.   I think VIP is worth it. It's only 10 bucks a month if you get the 3 month at a time plan, you get points to spend in the store, and you help support the game."
lotro,2s87ro,bobothetractor,-9,Tue Jan 13 15:27:08 2015 UTC,can take you a little over a day to get to 100 if you know what to run and if you bring appropriate boosts. each time they pointlessly raise the level cap i die a little bit inside to be honest  if you quest all the way through then holy shit it's going to be a LONG borefest.  Instances > quests always.   someone else has a better answer than i could provide about vip for you
lotro,2s87ro,Ambassador_Buta,10,Tue Jan 13 01:04:27 2015 UTC,Then why the fuck do you play this game? Playing the way you suggest is about as fun as masturbating with oven mitts on.
lotro,2s87ro,bobothetractor,-5,Tue Jan 13 01:32:47 2015 UTC,"Actually powerleveling is probably one of the few things still fun about this game for me. I had a shitload of fun middlefingering mounted combat on my burg and skipping 20 or so levels in like 3 days (no boosts) But no seriously this is what happens inside Turbine studios each time they discuss raising the level cap  After you go through the quest content more times than you are comfortable sharing you really start to hate the road to max level. Realizing that instances awarded like 100000% the exp a single quest does put a lot of interest back into the game for me.   A new player might want to go through the quests the first time, but since OP wanted to know how long questing would take to get to max, I was honest. It's fucking forever without copious amounts of boosts & knowing which hubs to go to. I've given guides to powerleveling here in the past to new players so that they could just hit max. I don't think they complained about jerking off with oven mitts.  Anyway the only reason I still play is the moors, and because the lifetime sub lets me play on and off"
lotro,2s87ro,Ambassador_Buta,5,Tue Jan 13 02:44:06 2015 UTC,"It's attitudes such as yours that make it impossible for devs to find an even balance for content.  People who burn through content as quickly as possible and then scream and whine for more are the bane of mmos! If you don't like to quest, go play a game like Everquest 1. Grind away to your hearts content at the pace you wish.  Quest driven games are meant to be journeys that take time. If you can't handle that past your first character, it might be time to reevaluate your play style."

lotro,2s1nmw,comicspolitics,6,Sun Jan 11 08:16:44 2015 UTC,"Someday I hope Turbine will be more open to changing up their payment model to the point where it's more fluid. Love the game and have supported it since I started, but figuring out what to pay for and when, and how you need to pay for this part and not that part, is just a pain to figure out. It's a very convoluted system. (Exemplified by this chart being almost mandatory reading.)  Ideally, I'd love it if they made all of the zones up until the expansions free. It's easier to sell people on that and draw them in. When I've told my friends they can play for free up until level 30, they get really hesitant when there are other games like RIFT, Neverwinter, and SWTOR that are free all the way through their respective base games. Level 30 just seems like a really arbitrary cut-off point.  They'd lose money on quest packs, but they'll also get F2P players who will make it far enough to actually purchase expansions. Instead of the cliff being at level 30, it'll be at the gates of Moria and they might be more likely to buy it instead of grinding deeds when it's staring them in the face. They also might be invested enough in the game to go VIP or purchase from the store a bit more. End result might be a healthier population and more people buying expansions from the store and during sales.  They could also make deeds/achievements server-wide (ala SWTOR), but I'm not sure if that would be taking things too far.  I dunno. LotRO is one of my favorite games, but it probably has one of the most confusing payment models ever for a F2P game, which might be why it struggles to be competitive at times. The big hesitation might be upsetting folks who have already paid for those sections of the game, which is a valid concern.  EDIT: And great video, by the way! (Meant to say that at the beginning. xD)"
lotro,2s1nmw,outbound_flight,2,Mon Jan 12 01:53:14 2015 UTC,I agree that they could perhaps streamline their services to make things clearer.   ...and I'm glad you like the video. Lots more to come! :)

lotro,2rysjd,bronzeart,4,Sun Jan 11 20:50:38 2015 UTC,"To me, LotRO feels like it has the scale of EQ, the combat/progression of WoW, and the kind of casual atmosphere of GW2. It's definitely an older game that has one foot in the past in a lot of respects, but the overworld and the story are really second-to-none. Turbine made great use of the lore from what I've seen so far.  Definitely give a F2P account a try if you're interested. Explore a bit, check out the player housing, skirmishes, and the main storyline. As for servers, I'd say Brandywine for serious progression and Landroval for RP/player events. (Though those qualities aren't mutually exclusive by any means.)  And it's never too late to check out LotRO! I just started last year, myself, and I've been having a blast."

lotro,2rxz1u,AutInveniamViam,5,Sat Jan 10 06:46:15 2015 UTC,"Is there any distinct benefit to buying the X-packs before you actually hit the levels involved?   There are a few little perks that you unlock immediately with some of the expansion packs, like some mounts, cosmetic gear, and some other odds and ends. But by and large, no, there's no real benefit to owning the expansion packs before you need them.   So an old buddy of mine has a lifetime VIP account (which I hear from my gf is awesome). He longer plays video games really. I may be able to obtain this account. This would fix 90% of the cost issue of getting into this game Would he have Turbine Points in it even though he has not logged in for years?   Someone else might be able to answer this one better. I know that Turbine switched parent companies some years ago, and as a result people had to transfer their accounts over to the new servers. Depending on how long ago it was, it shouldn't be a problem. You might have a few hoops to jump through if he last played before WB bought Turbine, though.  But I think there should be Turbine Points available there, yeah.   How fast do you level in this game?   That all depends on what you're looking for in the game. If hitting max level is your main priority, it'll probably take you longer than it would in WoW these days, but it won't be gruelingly slow or anything. I think the only thing that will affect how quickly you gain XP will be if you go VIP, since you get rest XP while you're subscribed.    On a side note, the interesting thing about LotRO is that you can technically unlock everything permanently for your account, so after a certain amount of purchases going VIP makes less and less sense. It's almost buy-to-play in a way, since if you buy all of the expansions/quest packs, you have permanent access to them regardless of subscription.  If you're interested in the game, starting a F2P account will give you access to the first four zones and all of the content up to level 30 for free. That includes the quests, deeds (achievements you earn for cosmetics, Turbine Points, and other rewards), crafting, player housing, etc. It's a pretty good vertical slice of what the game has to offer, so I'd say definitely check that out if you have an interest, play around until level 30, and see if you want to invest anymore time/money from there.  Here's a post I made some time back that will give you a sense of what to buy and when: http://www.reddit.com/r/lotro/comments/2manqb/what_do_you_wish_you_had_known_when_you_started/cm2qrhy  Hope that helps!"

Probably the best approach would be to get the Quad-Pack on sale though.  That said, I'm buying my expansions with Turbine Points I've earned in-game. It's worth paying for something to get Premium (cheap Starter Packs), but you can even stay dedicated F2P and earn those perks without spending a dime."

I see that kind of data moving operation as technically of trivial difficulty, based on my own expertise.  This really is the most routine kind of operation, you read data here, you write it there, you verify it worked, and you delete.  I have never heard a coherent argument to the contrary, but have had large volumes of utter nonsense and abuse spewed at me for daring not to have blind faith in Turbine's shallow excuse on this point.  Turbine said it couldn't be done, therefore the fanboys insisted it was impossible.  Bullocks I say, they just were not willing to build the code.  My suspicion is simply that Turbine didn't have any reason to facilitate it, and indeed wanted to strongly discourage the practice, because it would undermine their efforts to load balance the server populations by changing the default new server, and it has the ability to destabilize server economies and stability, if people are let to hop around excessively.  But now the need is obvious, the game is suffering, and so of course the solution will now be implemented.  Funny how it's possible now, when it was technically infeasible before, and nothing has actually changed."
lotro,2rqf9k,exploderator,3,Fri Jan 9 01:04:35 2015 UTC,"Server transfers are already automated for US->US and EU->EU.  The EU<->US migration problem not about automation at all, it's about database consistency.  Keep in mind that Codemasters, not Turbine, handled all the user accounts for EU players prior to only a few years ago. I don't know what underlying database system either used, but they didn't necessarily use the same one. The game code may have been the same, but the DBs don't need to be as long as the interface connecting the game code to those DBs is consistent.  As long as Codemasters users and Turbine users never mix, this doesn't cause a problem. As soon as you do mix them, you either a) need to put something at the very beginning of every database lookup that figures out whether your user has a Codemasters account or a Turbine account and then select the appropriate DB connector to use for the rest of the query or b) merge the data from Codemaster's DB over to the Turbine DB. The former would almost certainly have unacceptable consequences on performance. The latter is far from trivial to do and carries a significant risk of database consistency errors that would need to be corrected by somebody.  I mean, we're probably talking about at least two or three engineers, at least one of whom who'd need to be a senior DBA, spending at least two or three months of effort. That is not cheap, and you wouldn't spend that kind of money unless there was a clear benefit to your company's bottom line. And, let's be honest, there isn't one. I don't know how many people are likely to do an EU<->US transfer, but even at $30 a pop I doubt Turbine would break even on that.  That they're considering it at all now suggests that they might be digging into their databases anyway while touching up the server transfer system. If they weren't popping that hood for unrelated reasons, there'd no financial incentive to even consider it."

But I still disagree with your assessment.  I think you've quite seriously over-estimated the difficulties involved.  It simply does not take months to overcome completely common hurdles like importing international addresses into a more modern database that can already handle international addresses.  And the data elements are either consistent within their existing fields, or the data is already not consistent, and can't be used properly in its existing database.  I cannot see how this takes many months of time by anyone competent.  I remain convinced that the only real hurdle here is NOT technical, it is purely Turbine's business interest to not offer customers the cheap easy server transfers they want when that would conflict with Turbine's interest."

Sure there's going to be a lot of tricky complications for the database conversions, but it wouldn't be impossible.  Add to this the fact that Turbine frequently shuts down all servers for updates, this means they have the luxury of not having to do these on live databases where transactions happen on realtime.  What Turbine should've done years ago was to set up the conversions translation infra from Codemaster databases to Turbine databases, then migrate ALL Codemaster databases to Turbine format to make the shift between EU <-> NA transfers easy in the future."

It makes me think the place is run by accountants, after some internal coup had a bunch of business school grads take control away from the passionate techs that actually made the game possible, and knew what they were doing, and what needed to be done to make the game solid and perfect.

Now I don't want to do that for a lot of reasons, a big one being that I will likely lose of my character's name, and these are names that I don't want to lose.  I am extremely worried about this. If my main character loses his name I'll stop playing. I will have no reason to continue. It is the one aspect of this game that I am completely unwavering.  ""You can play on whichever server you like on the preferred server list"" and what if I don't want to play on the preferred server list?

I play on Landroval, so the population is still good, but I've heard that some other servers are ghost towns. It's costing Turbine money to keep those things running, and if very few people are using them, there's no reason to keep them open. Transferring out of a server that is being shut down would by definition not be optional.  As to the name thing, yes, that is going to suck. I think the alternative would be to shut the game down. They're clearly in a cost-cutting phase. They fired a large portion of the staff, the Beorning class was not fleshed out when released indicating too few people with not enough time working on it, and the last paid update was a disappointment, and everything that was disappointing about it was in all likelihood caused by lack of budget.   The people calling the shots in this game are clearly not interested in spending money where it's not necessary (and it's entirely possible that it's because they don't have the money to spend -- watching some of the increased emphasis on microtransactions makes me suspect that people aren't paying for the game like they used to), and it's not necessary to spend money to keep a server open so that a few dozen players can keep their names."
lotro,2rqf9k,exploderator,2,Thu Jan 8 17:13:48 2015 UTC,"It's costing Turbine money to keep those things running,   That really depends.  You are still thinking in terms of ""server"" = ""a dedicated computer"".  Turbine might still be doing that, but I very highly doubt it.  We now live in the era of virtual machines.  It means you have a large pool of generic computers, and when a job needs to be done, you start it up on whatever machine has capacity.  This is a key strategy that allows high reliability systems, because if any one of the machines fail, you just stop sending work to it, instead of having a fixed part or your system go dark.  A major example of this now is Amazon's Elastic Computing services.  You can basically just start running jobs on their system (you pay of course), from pretending to have one small slow computer, to having tens of thousands of powerful ones.  You can instantly create a supercomputer, run one huge job, and when the job is done, the virtual computers cease to exist for you.  And here's the neat trick: it doesn't matter how many game-world-servers there are, it only matters how busy they are.  If one whole real computer can handle 500 players worth of server work, it wouldn't really matter if the 500 players were split across 10 mostly empty game worlds (servers), or all playing together on one single more populated world.  That one computer can pretend to be ten separate computers as easily as it can be one computer, as long as the total work load does not exceed what it can do.  If Turbine is doing it right, and I expect they must be, if only for the reliability, then you can forget about it costing per game world, because the cost is really per-player.  If a game world has almost nobody home, then it takes up almost no CPU time on whatever real processors it gets run on.  That means they can let picky Thomas keep his name, if he want's to live in an empty world, and it will scarcely cost them any extra."

Unless the server code base is hopelessly tied to optimizations that only work on one dedicated mainframe per game world, or something like that."
lotro,2rqf9k,ThomasTyndan,4,Sat Jan 10 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"""You can play on whichever server you like on the preferred server list"" and what if I don't want to play on the preferred server list?  ""You can play on whichever server you like"" is what I would have wanted to hear. Now I have to worry about hidden meanings behind the wording.    I suspect that the reason that it is phrased this way is that they don't intend to allow free transfers to underpopulated servers.  For example, they may want to consolidate players down to 8-10 of the existing 30 servers.  So instead of letting you have your choice of moving to any server they will want to you move to a target server so that you're not moving from a low population server to another low population server.   This is a dangerously imprecise description.   Undoubtedly it will become more precise as they have fleshed out more of the details.  The problem with these sorts of communities is that everyone wants to know EVERYTHING about new/upcoming features without being patient enough to wait until they are fleshed out.  They could continue to work on this plan in secret for the next 6 months and listen to players whining about low population servers, or they could come out and say ""we're putting together a plan to allow you to transfer to a more populated server for free"" and then fill in the blanks when they have the info.  Unfortunately, there's always someone who whines about it either way."

Then there's kin names. Neighborhoods I chose because the name. And I am fond of my server too even when I only knew what the name was about later.  And the multiple houses I have is not a minor detail either."
lotro,2rqf9k,ThomasTyndan,3,Thu Jan 8 16:05:27 2015 UTC,"As you can see in my profile, on of my character's name is ""Thomas"". If a forced server move happens what will happen to my character name. I can tell you what happened in SWTOR I became ""Thomas-FRE"", and I got a rename token. Which would not allow me to rename to ""Thomas"".  Now, if Turbine does some sort of naming land grab such as giving the player with the oldest account/character the name, and renaming someone else, then I'd come out the winner being a lifetime since Open beta player. No one with the character name ""Thomas"" will beat me out on that one. But I don't know... I certainly hope that all this really becomes is a marking of server population levels and a round of free transfers which I can safely ignore and go about my life. =)"
lotro,2rqf9k,notwhoithink,2,Thu Jan 8 16:13:04 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping so too. Been reading the comments in the forum and there's many comments about this, even added mine. I hope they consider those of us who like our names and locations and even the more peaceful servers."

I'm just spitballing here, but if you prefer the ""more peaceful"" (i.e., ""empty"") servers then your playstyle preference is out of whack with their business model.  They're not in this to run a bunch of underpopulated servers.  As far as the names go...I'm fond of my characters' names as well, but I think that having a thriving and vibrant server community to play on more than trumps the desire to not have to change any of my characters' names.  That really is the most minor and temporary of inconveniences when you consider the larger scope of things."

There will be no forced data merge from one server to another, or to combine two servers. When/ if players move, they will make the choice themselves of which of the available worlds they want to move each of their characters and account or kinship to. Yes, we are likely to close a number of servers to play, but only after a large grace period and even after that the characters will remain available to be moved to another server to play on indefinitely. We have an idea of the servers we will wish to keep and which to close, but that list is not yet set in stone and may be subject to change as we see the results of transfers and some of the hardware investigation we are doing.  Also it appears I may have posted some incorrect info yesterday. We may not be able to allow EU <-> US transfers due to data concerns that remain from prior merges. But we are looking into it to see if any of our new tech might bridge that hurdle.   Cross server play/ chat is something we looked into but was not feasible with the age of our code and sheer amount of character data that could conflict.   I have more meetings on the transfers in the next couple of weeks to clarify some of the questions that remain. After that I should be able to start releasing more info on the plans and possibilities."

Or something like that.  At any rate, whatever the actual process ends up being, it sounds like you'll have a choice in your destination server, which means you can shop around for one where your name is free.

You'd have to intervene once every 4 hours, 47 minutes to empty bags.  Not exactly a cash cow, and the fix for it is the same for any automated farming.

lotro,2rnd67,BelaLugosiDead,9,Wed Jan 7 17:58:27 2015 UTC,"Hello all! I’m Athena “Vyvyanne” Peters, Executive Producer of The Lord of the Rings Online.  Thank you for welcoming me. I am really excited to be exploring Tolkien’s world and all the adventures that have and will take place here!  2014 was a great year for LOTRO, and we hope you agree! Our focus for the year was expanding our story into Gondor, improving Epic Battles with Pelargir, and introducing a new class – the Beorning. Our progress in these areas sets us up for ambitious goals in 2015.  Our story continues in 2015 with both Osgiliath and Minas Tirith! Although there will be multiple updates throughout the year, these major locations will be the focus of our largest releases. Each expands the world of Middle-earth even further, and puts us in view of the Ephel Dúath and Mordor itself.  Major 2015 Initiatives:  Legendary Items: With the Osgiliath update, you will be able to Imbue Level 100 Legendary Items. An Imbued item continues to gain experience and will no longer need to be deconstructed to advance. These items are already in internal testing! There are many details still to work out, but you should expect a developer diary on the topic early this year.  New Fellowship Challenges: As we push into the heart of the War of the Ring, this is the perfect time for us to renew our focus on group content and instances. Expect new instances in Osgiliath, along with additional Roving Threats and group content on the landscape.  Quality of Life: We have been workingto identify your most persistent bugs. You can expect a renewed focus on resolving issues that may be small but troublesome, to improve overall gameplay experience.  Episodic Content: We are currently in development on a new type of quest content that will roll out like an episodic TV show, a little at a time, as you follow a new friend across Middle-earth seeing familiar places in a new light.  Server Populations: Based on your feedback, we’re taking measures to get everyone onto the more populous servers, so that finding parties is easier and festivals and live events are more fun. We are working on both improved server transfer tools and upgrades to our environments to improve playability. Also we will be moving our European servers back to the EU! More details on this coming soon!   <PvMP: The team is also seriously investigating a new PvMP map in Osgiliath. This landscape would tell the story of the Battle of Osgiliath, and the layout of the city (split by the Anduin) is perfect for smaller and more tightly focused conflicts than the Ettenmoors. This would make the perfect platform for gradual improvements to the PvMP experience, overall. We’ll provide additional updates on this initiative as we get deeper into 2015.   And that is just for the first half of the year! Stay tuned for more detail on all of the above and more on what will come along with Minas Tirith as we get deeper into the year. As always we look forward to your feedback and suggestions as we take this journey together.  We look forward to seeing you in Middle-earth as LOTRO enters its 8th year!  Happy New Year!  Vyvyanne"
lotro,2rnd67,notwhoithink,11,Wed Jan 7 17:59:55 2015 UTC,"The server populations comment was interesting. First she says she's working to get everyone onto the more populous servers, then she goes on to talk about improving the server transfer tools. The tools might make it easier to transfer, but if I have to pay, per character, to transfer my nine characters to a more populated server as we do now then it's not going to happen. They either need to consolidate (a huge task to work out) or give people free transfers. Asking players to pay $25 per character to move servers while losing their mithril coins, destiny points, shared storage, shared wardrobe, house, and good knows what else is a rip-off."

lotro,2rnd67,Daddyloveshunt,4,Wed Jan 7 23:42:03 2015 UTC,"New instances?! Good god, I hope they add a couple of raids. Doesn't even need to be anything huge. Just something to do at end game."

lotro,2rnd67,notwhoithink,3,Thu Jan 8 03:13:03 2015 UTC,Moving the EU servers back to Europe is a surprising move. It's an extremely non-trivial expenditure in terms of both hardware and personnel.  I wonder if there's some factor that makes this more affordable for them than it seems at first glance. I haven't been following Infinite Crisis at all; do they already have European servers? Moving LOTRO servers into a datacenter that already exists would be a lot cheaper than opening a whole new DC just for LOTRO.
lotro,2rnd67,Dod4r,5,Wed Jan 7 18:45:49 2015 UTC,My guess is that they are not opening a new data center or moving physical hardware. Most likely they are going to move a bunch of VMs into some third party cloud data center. Why would anyone run their own these days?
lotro,2rnd67,AfterburnerX,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:12:00 2015 UTC,This is probally the preparation for server merges. They might make 1 or 2 superservers per region.
lotro,2rnd67,outbound_flight,3,Wed Jan 7 18:51:39 2015 UTC,"I'm most looking forward to more info about the servers. Been considering a transfer off of Riddermark, but now I guess I'll just wait it out to see what they have in store."
lotro,2rnd67,Rarey,3,Wed Jan 7 19:22:44 2015 UTC,"Shame we're not hearing more about housing, but I'm liking the sound of this letter. The server part is hopefully implying some mergers are going to take place. This game has one of the biggest overworlds ever, and I think they have more servers up than SWTOR.  EDIT: I'd also love it if they put more work into their launcher and ensure that it's more up-to-date with events/patch notes. Right now, half of it's taken up with an expired event."
lotro,2rnd67,Zzzlol94,2,Wed Jan 7 21:40:29 2015 UTC,Hm. First reaction: I'm worried about losing anything with possible server... what ever the plan is.  Certainly very interesting.
lotro,2rnd67,lordkrall,2,Wed Jan 7 20:10:45 2015 UTC,"As a european playing on Snowbourn, having lots of issues with lag to the server, which seems to be specific to my account, the fact that the servers are moving back to EU is probably one of the best things that has happened. Hopefully those servers stay stable and give a more enjoyable experience, also make war-steeds less of a lag-/teleportfest."

lotro,2rnd67,chalk46,1 point,Wed Jan 7 18:22:43 2015 UTC,"Another vague ""road map"" and more than likely one that will be short lived and full of false hope. I'd love for Turbine to start acting like a company that cares about their players but lets face it. Each and every letter that's come out gets blocked by budget constraints and other issues that more than likely aren't revealed to the players due to non disclosure agreements and other provisions that limit how much can be told to non corporate members.  Our community sponsors three kinships on the game and I've been hearing a lot about the reactions in-game regarding this letter. Population has began to drop a bit on the servers we're on, ie Gladden and Brandywine. Crickhollow seems to be somewhat stable but even our Kin on that server is experiencing some issues.  Sad to say, but I feel this is going to be another Star Wars Galaxies / Star Wars The Old Republic all over again. They retired Galaxies for The Old Republic as Galaxies was badly outdated. Now, whether or not whomever re-creates the new version of LOTRO in the coming years does it right or not, that's something we'd have to wait and see but I really don't see much of a future with the current game.  Maybe I'm wrong and I hope I am, granted I do not play the game anymore, but there's a lot of good people in the kins that I talk to every couple of days and for most of them it's the only game they play and thus will be somewhat lost without the game. Unfortunately I've seen this with Galaxies and it followed a very similar route."

lotro,2rnc7a,Detective_Fallacy,3,Thu Jan 8 01:20:18 2015 UTC,"Hello LOTRO!  After eight years, five expansions, and one free-to-play transition, the time has come for me to Sail to the West. More accurately, I’m moving thirty feet down the hall to start a new project at Turbine. With that, I’m leaving you in the very capable hands of another Turbine veteran – Executive Producer Athena Peters.  LOTRO has been at the center of my professional and personal life for many years now, including my almost annual pilgrimage to Germany to speak to our players at gamescom. In this year I believe we’ve done a great job of focusing on what you, the players, would like to see the game. We’ve listened to you and changed our plans – the most significant change was probably pulling a level cap out of Update 15. In the next year you’ll see a continued drive to deliver great story content and an authentic world, but you’ll also need new investment in group challenges and content. Even after almost eight years, the LOTRO team continues to grow and adapt Middle-earth.  Frelorn will be posting Athena's Producers Letter soon with her vision for the coming year.  Time does not tarry ever ... but change and growth is not in all things and places alike.  Rowan"
lotro,2rnc7a,mithrandirbooga,2,Wed Jan 7 17:51:13 2015 UTC,Well. That was fast.

lotro,2rnc7a,upvotesforeverything,2,Thu Jan 8 00:14:40 2015 UTC,"Excited to hear Turbine is working on a new project. They need to slowly fade this game out and then let another company come along and take a shot at it.  Don't get me wrong, I love(d) LOTRO so very much, but they completely lost their vision halfway through. Turbine did a lot of things great, and a lot of things horribly wrong.   Simply put, this IP should be the number one MMORPG out there, but it won't be with a game like LOTRO. I hope someone can eventually come along and make a bigger, better Middle Earth MMORPG."
lotro,2rnc7a,msbq,1 point,Fri Jan 9 19:17:52 2015 UTC,Interesting. I am excited to see Athena Peters' upcoming producer letter. Her vision for the finale of the game had better be pretty epic!
lotro,2rnsr4,BelaLugosiDead,5,Wed Jan 7 19:55:09 2015 UTC,"Hi all!  I am so glad to hear the mostly positive reception to the things we have outlined for the year so far. I wanted to hop on here and address a couple of points of confusion/ requests for clarity on a few items.  Vagueness: Yes, we dont give a lot of detail in the Producer's letter for the year. This is because many of these things are still in design and thus subject to change or are simply ideas that will not be fleshed out for months to come. We will be putting feedback posts and more detailed threads on the specific features as they solidify and can be focused on for feedback individually. This letter is intended as an overview.  Group Instances in Osgiliath: We are specifically referring to a cluster of instance content for 3 & 6 man fellowships that is neither a Big Battle or a Raid. We evaluate the type of content we build with each region for what is appropriate and feasible. So we might do a raid again some day, but Osgiliath is not the time to do it.  Osgiliath PvMP map: This will be a different ""layer"" to the map. This way players will be able to explore Osgiliath in PvE mode in Update 16 and the goal is to then also provide a PvMP version shortly thereafter (not on the same release date).  Music: We currently have our sound engineers looking into the issues with the newer version of the music system that we pulled out late last year. Our hopes is that we can have it fixed with or next update, but I am still awaiting implementation and testing of the fixes to see if they are affective. Once we have it in we will of course be placing it on Bullroarer so we can get feedback before it is released. More info once I have it.  EU Servers: This will simply be a move of the physical servers to Amsterdam. The service will still remain in the hands of Turbine, so we will all still have the same downtime, updates, etc in sync with one another. Better location and newer hardware should result in better performance all around.  Server Populations: We are still working through the details, but part of our efforts here are to make the transition as seamless as possible for Kinship leaders to keep the players together. The idea is to bring you together, not spread further apart. This effort also includes upgraded hardware and a move to a better location for internet traffic for the US servers. This is a large and complicated process which I am fully focused on. More details on this in the coming weeks as more of the timelines and tech solidify.  -Vyvyanne"
lotro,2rnsr4,kintaeb,5,Wed Jan 7 19:56:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like the servers are a major issue that still seems murky. So they are making the process of staying together in a Kinship easier and moving servers around for better ping. What then? What does that mean? Like someone else said, will I still have to pay to transfer? I know moving characters and figuring out housing overlaps and the like are difficult, but is it really worth the cost of running these servers full time when most are ghost towns?"
lotro,2rnsr4,comicspolitics,1 point,Wed Jan 7 21:40:29 2015 UTC,How many servers have you been on?
lotro,2rnsr4,kintaeb,2,Wed Jan 7 23:48:50 2015 UTC,"Not that many, but a lot of people complain about their servers being dead and there's basically 1 or 2 that have any great community. There's 20 servers for the US alone, that's way too many."
lotro,2rnsr4,DiscoJer,1 point,Thu Jan 8 02:14:22 2015 UTC,"Most the servers I've played on have at 100+ people on during prime time hours. Is that a lot? Perhaps not, but it's not bad, either.  Exception being Gilrain. That is pretty much a ghost town."
lotro,2rnsr4,kintaeb,1 point,Thu Jan 8 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"Having only 100 people on at a time is awful, truly terrible. I'd say to have an okay community there needs to be at least 500 people online at prime hours. Otherwise you just have 40 people sitting in the main town and the rest are spread out over the entire world, meaning little to no interaction. At that point it becomes a single player game with a chat room. Unless you have a Kinship that you can count on having people on constantly there's essentially no point in calling a 100 player server an MMO since those 100 people are not in any way guaranteed to interact during their time online."
lotro,2rnsr4,Wolfbane5001,1 point,Thu Jan 8 05:38:01 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly. 100 online is absolutely miserable. Even your 500 is the bare minimum for a game to be considered ""alive,"" honestly. In a world the size of LotRO, I'd hope for at least 1,000, but preferably more."

lotro,2rofvh,CharmingJack,1 point,Wed Jan 7 22:45:44 2015 UTC,"Well, Battle Shout is a Tactical skill, which IIRC doesn't ever miss (or get BPE'd; they can only be resisted).  I'm not really sure how big the miss penalty for moving is in general, though. It should apply for both (non-tactical) skills and autoattacks, but I also think it only applies to ranged skills and autoattacks. So maybe there's a Hunter around who knows more about the mechanic."
lotro,2rofvh,tobascodagama,2,Wed Jan 7 23:43:40 2015 UTC,"Ahhh, okay. Well that is good news. It would be helpful if someone could confirm."
lotro,2rofvh,Onistly,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:48:17 2015 UTC,"I believe the miss chance while moving only applies to auto-attacks with a bow (Champ, Guard, Hunter) or with a javelin (Warden). I've never played a hunter, so I can't confirm with that class, but I do know for sure that's how it works with the other three.  Edit:There is also a miss penalty to other Javelin skills for the warden, as has been pointed out below"
lotro,2rofvh,freedaemons,1 point,Thu Jan 8 00:45:33 2015 UTC,"Considering that there's a Warden legacy to reduce miss chance penalty for javelin skills, it seems unlikely that it applies only to autoattacks.   However, I get the sense that minis , yellow RKs, and blueline hunters don't get a penalty.. Or at least, they shouldn't, intuitively. Would be nice to get some definitive confirmation."
lotro,2rofvh,Onistly,2,Thu Jan 8 05:43:48 2015 UTC,"MY gut says the miss chance legacy is just an old, useless legacy. While this is more anecdotal than anything, in my experience I can't recall seeing more misses on javelin skills while moving (Javelin skills being Javelin Toss, Hampering Javelin, and Wages of Fear) compared to not moving. Again, I can't say for certain, but that's just how it's felt when I've played my warden. The legacy may also have been added in once the Yellow line warden became ranged due to assailment.  The same goes for my RK. While I've never measured it, I can't recall ever seeing more misses on auto-attacks while moving, probably for the reason mentioned above - RK auto attacks count as tactical skills and can't miss or be mitigated by BPE."
lotro,2rofvh,Belhaven,2,Thu Jan 8 05:53:09 2015 UTC,"I've been paying attention to this for a while and i beleive there is an accuracy penalty for moving and flinging javelins on the warden, as my Shield Piercer or Hampering Javelin misses more often if I fire them as I'm moving in than if I fire them while stationary. It LOOKS like i get about 25% or so more misses while moving."
lotro,2rofvh,Onistly,1 point,Thu Jan 8 15:39:10 2015 UTC,"I was wrong. There is a miss penalty to the javelin throwing skills as well as autoattacks. However, it appears that there is no miss penalty to gambits or gambit builders while in assailment stance."
lotro,2rofvh,Sentreen,1 point,Thu Jan 8 17:17:50 2015 UTC,I'm quite sure that it applies to any ranged skill that can be cast on the run + auto-attacks.

lotro,2rmuiq,JKtheSlacker,3,Wed Jan 7 15:22:05 2015 UTC,Some of these make sense. Others don't (I can run through the southern Barrow-Downs starting around 25 and fill my bags with mathoms...)  Ah well. I knew buying rep items with marks felt a bit weird on my lowbie toons...
lotro,2rmuiq,Eslader,2,Wed Jan 7 16:22:49 2015 UTC,If you're a group of 2 or 3 Beornings you can run the southern Downs at around 19.   It doesn't make sense to me that mathoms require a higher level than tomb raiders sashes. You're fooling around with hobbit stuff long before you get way up there.
lotro,2rmuiq,dmentia777,2,Thu Jan 8 14:54:12 2015 UTC,"I find the rep item change disappointing,  but unsurprising. I have used these rep items to earn TP for a truly free alt account. (Roll lowbie alt; consume all rep items to reach max rep with as many factions as possible; delete lowbie; repeat.) I did it as a test, to see if it was possible. It was extremely grindy, but effective: I got to level 70 and Dunland without spending a penny of real money. I suppose the experiment is over now; QED."
lotro,2rmuiq,notwhoithink,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:02:50 2015 UTC,"Perhaps, perhaps not. It just slows down the rep gain so it's more in line with level gains. You could still rack up a fair number of TPs this way, it just takes a bit longer."
lotro,2rmuiq,dmentia777,2,Wed Jan 7 18:18:00 2015 UTC,"It's more than just a bit longer. Before the change, I could farm (or buy) stacks and stacks of 700-rep items. 122 of them would take a brand-new (fresh out of the intro at level 5) character from zero to kindred (50 TP) in about 60 seconds. Adding the time it takes to get through the intro (about 20 minutes), the time it takes to run on foot to a housing district (about 5 minutes), and the time it takes to click through the rep items for 8 rep factions (about 5 minutes), I could earn 800 TP in an hour (8 factions * 50 TP/faction * 2x per hour). Yes, I had to sink time and/or gold into acquiring the stockpile of the various rep items, but that hasn't been too hard to do with a healthy in-game gold balance.    The time to get from 5 to 8 adds another 30 minutes at most (60 min total for intro up to level 8). The run to the housing entrance is unchanged (still about 5 minutes). But the big difference is that I can now only earn rep for one faction - 50 TP. So it will now take 90 minutes to earn 50 TP.   I totally understand why Turbine made this change (earning 800 TP per hour, limited only by vault space, housing chest space, and gold to purchase rep items, is a little ridiculous) but the change to make rep items level-limited completely eliminates the effectiveness of this method for earning TP."
lotro,2rmuiq,notwhoithink,2,Wed Jan 7 21:02:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting take on that. Maybe you play on a more active server than I do, but in my experience is hard to find/collect/buy enough items that give 700 rep to go from unknown to kindred with that many factions that fast. On my server the market on the AH just isn't there. On the other hand, if you have enough marks then you can barter for them to get the rep from MOST of the SoA factions. I've done that with most of my characters in the past few weeks to get some quick TP, but I also spent trends of thousands of marks to get them. There's a limit to how much it can be done unless you have a very active AH."
lotro,2rmuiq,dmentia777,2,Wed Jan 7 21:28:19 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, that AH availability will vary as a function of server population/activity. I used excess items as a solid source of gold income when I needed it. (Remember Draigoch scales? Unlucky in /roll, I spent some gold to acquire mine.) Just about all of the rep items were easily farm-able from landscape mobs. And at level cap, nuking landscape mobs can be therapeutic. :)   If you're interested in farming for yourself, I can share my preferred spots. An hour or two for each faction (while working on slayer deeds!) is all it takes."
lotro,2rmuiq,Satarash,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:44:08 2015 UTC,"If you're interested in farming for yourself, I can share my preferred spots. An hour or two for each faction (while working on slayer deeds!) is all it takes.    An hour or two for kindred? I'm interested in your preferred spots. I have tried to farm reputation items but I cannot collect a quarter of that in two hours.  Except maybe in Barrow Downs."
lotro,2rmuiq,dmentia777,2,Tue Jan 13 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"Angmar (Council of the North rep): Far to the north, in the area of Carn Dum that is not the instance, there's a part of the city that includes a bunch of Angmarim and Hillmen in a courtyard. Some of them are in prayer/adulation around a big pillar in a puddle of wicked yellow-green. Kill everything in the courtyard (including the small courtyard to the north and up to the door at the west). By the time everything is dead, the first mobs will respawn.   Angmar (Rangers of Esteldin rep): Head north out of Gabulzhsjadhkashjd (the dwarf compound on the south east part of the map). You will pass a relatively open orc camp that has sharpened stake palisades. Though you can work in that camp, it's not as efficient as the one slightly farther north that has both orcs and trolls in it. Continue north until you see a narrow canyon with orcs at the entrance. This is a camp that's shaped like a backwards C and has many orcs and several trolls. Enter on the south and head east, murdering everything, continue into all the corners of the place, looping around to the north and then back to the west out the northern entrance. Kill all orcs outside, head back to that south-western entrance that you started with. Repeat.   Annuminas (Wardens of Annuminas rep): The lower part of Annuminas, closest to Men Erain, has normal (blue) mobs that drop rep items. Starting with the entrance from the road (you'll be heading south and then southwest from Men Erain), murder everything. Run back to start. Repeat.   Bree (Men of Bree rep): Haudh Iarchith. Murder all. You'll have overflowing bags in no time.   Ered Luin (Thorins Hall rep): Sarnur. Go there. Kill everything. Stay just on the upper levels and run the circuit around the perimeter of the central pit/canyon. It's a circuit of murder and deeds. Alternatively, the dwarf encampment in the northwest of forochel, Zigilgund, has a pretty good drop rate. (In terms of establishing a circuit, it's less efficient because it's not as ""flat"" a layout; you'll end up having to go up and down multiple levels. But it'll work.)   Forochel (Lossoth of Forochel rep): There is a large camp of Guardans in the northwest. This spot is near the spot on the map labeled ""Talvi-Muri"", north of Zigilgund and south of Kuru Leiri. It's a large that has you run up a long incline to the top of the camp. By the time you've killed everything on your way up, the mobs at the bottom will have started to respawn. I had a buddy who would trait red as an RK and just leave a trail of smoldering, bleeding corpses in his wake as he ran the circuit. It was fun to watch. (HI WALLUP)   Moria (both Iron Garrison Guards and Iron Garrison Miners): There is no real strategy except to kill many things. There are some pockets of Orcs and Goblins here and there in Moria that can work, but the Forges of Khazad Dum instance has lots of mobs with lots opportunities for drops.   Trollshaws or Misty Mountains (Elves of Rivendell rep): This is by far the slowest to collect for. There are two spots, one in the Trollshaws and one in the Misty Mountains. I prefer the one in the Trollshaws because there tend to be fewer people but the Misty Mountains location is arguably easier to reach. In the Misty Mountains, from Gloins camp, head north toward the gates of Helegrod. High up on the hill, toward the very north of the map, there's a switchback with Hillmen. Kill 'em all. Stop with the group that has the bloodletter at the top. Return to the bottom and repeat.   In Trollshaws, you're heading toward Amon Varadh (where Malloval spawns for a quest) and Minas Ciliant, Ost Chall, and Ost Brandras. The Hillmen seem to have a better drop rate for these rep items than the dead you'll find there, but... kill everything anyway. From the base of Amon Varadh, kill all things on the incline up to the peak, and then kill everything as you cross the ridge heading north and northeast into Minas Ciliant. Then, kill everything in Minas Ciliant, Ost Chall, and Ost Brandras. Return to the start - the base of Amon Varadh - and start all over again.   Bree or Misty Mountains (Mathom Society rep): Well-Kept Mathoms are so widely accessible that I'm having a hard time identifying a single spot for farming them. It seems like you just... GET these. Doing slayer deeds for humanoids in Evendim or North Downs yields zillions.   In Bree, as you farm up Bree Rep in Haud Iarchith you'll also probably get a fair share of Well-Kept Mathoms as well. Alternatively, in Misty Mountains, go to Goblin Town. The drop rate for the Rivendell items is poor, but you could consider trying to knock out farming for both at once here."

lotro,2rmuiq,7h3C47,2,Wed Jan 7 20:32:26 2015 UTC,I was really hoping to see some class titles for my Beorning.
lotro,2rmuiq,Execrat0r,2,Wed Jan 7 16:45:13 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering why they put on the level restrictions, think about what happens every time you go from one rep level to the next on a toon, and what happens when your main mails your alt stacks of rep items for all of those zones."
lotro,2rmuiq,notwhoithink,1 point,Wed Jan 7 16:24:37 2015 UTC,Level restrictions on rep items seems like a cash grab.
lotro,2rn5pf,tobascodagama,3,Wed Jan 7 16:57:31 2015 UTC,"Text for those at work:    Hello LOTRO!  After eight years, five expansions, and one free-to-play transition, the time has come for me to Sail to the West. More accurately, I’m moving thirty feet down the hall to start a new project at Turbine. With that, I’m leaving you in the very capable hands of another Turbine veteran – Executive Producer Athena Peters.  LOTRO has been at the center of my professional and personal life for many years now, including my almost annual pilgrimage to Germany to speak to our players at gamescom. In this year I believe we’ve done a great job of focusing on what you, the players, would like to see the game. We’ve listened to you and changed our plans – the most significant change was probably pulling a level cap out of Update 15. In the next year you’ll see a continued drive to deliver great story content and an authentic world, but you’ll also need new investment in group challenges and content. Even after almost eight years, the LOTRO team continues to grow and adapt Middle-earth.  Frelorn will be posting Athena's Producers Letter soon with her vision for the coming year.   Time does not tarry ever ... but change and growth is not in all things and places alike.  Rowan"
lotro,2rn5pf,Dod4r,2,Wed Jan 7 16:58:05 2015 UTC,"""An update from rowan""  Omg producer letter is finally here.  ""Oh""  I've got mixed feelings about this. Some things were great, some weren't. I guess the producers letter by Athena will solidify my opinion. Curious to see what the new project is and I hope Rowan will do well over there."
lotro,2rn5pf,matty9090,2,Wed Jan 7 17:04:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm curious to find out what this super-secret project is. Acheron's Call 3? :P"
lotro,2rn5pf,deltusverilan,-1,Wed Jan 7 17:53:23 2015 UTC,"Sigh. And to think they're leaving the game just for some tablet/phone freemium game.  I guess lotro has one, maybe two years left."
lotro,2rn5cq,Waterbison,3,Wed Jan 7 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"Yellow line is amazing in group settings. Burg heals are almost good enough you don't need to bring along a healer in easier instances. The debuffs rule as always. However, damage is scaled way back so yellow line burgs aren't really a dps class anymore. That being said, I would not go solo in yellow because you can no longer 1 hit mobs out of stealth.   I'm not sure about yellow burgs in the Moors. I haven't really seen one out there. Most people go red I think for the quick massive damage Coup de Gras gives you."
lotro,2rn5cq,moartaterz,1 point,Wed Jan 7 17:22:35 2015 UTC,"I see. Thanks for the response. I was afraid that the damage would be gimped hard in MM. I will fool around with it for sure to have that group utility available, but for fast questing I'll probably stick to QK."
lotro,2rn5cq,Mencham,3,Wed Jan 7 18:01:53 2015 UTC,"Don't discount yellow line for solo play. Yes your DPS is much lower. But one of the benifits of the trait trees is being able to switch stances before any fight. A Yellow,line burg can solo things that seem impossible. Debuff's and healing skills, besides the stuns means you can take on challenges that many besides a warden wouldn't even think to try. Also if it does start getting too much of a challenge you can just hips, rebuild health and come back for  more or move onto other challenges."
lotro,2rl4x6,BelaLugosiDead,2,Wed Jan 7 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"The LOTRO Game Servers will be brought down on Wednesday, January 7th from 9:00 AM - 11:00 AM Eastern (-5 GMT) for a hotfix. Thanks for your patience, and we'll see you back in the game soon!"
lotro,2rl4x6,Ambassador_Buta,2,Wed Jan 7 02:51:47 2015 UTC,This hotfix better address the stat exploit as well as the crippling lag.

lotro,2rl4x6,Wolfbane5001,1 point,Wed Jan 7 15:48:54 2015 UTC,That's pretty bad. On Crick I've had that happen. But it was once or twice over a period of two weeks and only lasted for less than a minute.

lotro,2rginp,ParadoxicGer,2,Tue Jan 6 01:33:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you for answers everyone. I find the MS approximately the same on Landroval US and Evernight EU, Evernight was less lagg for me and will choose Evernight because we'd like to meet people during the day when we will play. :)  I might make a character on Gwaihir in order to learn German xD"

lotro,2rewst,HippoHandler,2,Mon Jan 5 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"Is there a certain type of special currency? and if so like other MMO games, how do you acquire it? Plus is there a class that anyone recommends? Thanks!"
lotro,2rewst,ellohir,4,Mon Jan 5 17:10:19 2015 UTC,"Hi there! As most people on this sub will tell you, just read the classes description and choose whatever you like most. The race is mostly cosmetic, there's not a big difference between them in the end.  There's the in-game currency, with copper-silver-gold coins. Then there's Turbine Points, that you must pay or unlock via achievements (""Deeds""). With TP you can unlock new inventory bags and new zones.  The most important thing is that you like your character and have fun, though! Don't worry too much about what's better or what to unlock and just play the character as you think he or she would do. You'll learn the details of game by playing :)"
lotro,2rewst,ChriosM,2,Mon Jan 5 17:32:38 2015 UTC,"Just a quick tip: 100 copper = 1 silver, 1000 silver = 1 gold. A lot of other games with copper/silver/gold currencies are only 100 silver = 1 gold. That being said, drop rates are pretty high and you will earn gold pretty quickly unless you are blowing it on stuff you don't necessarily need."
lotro,2rewst,ChriosM,2,Mon Jan 5 17:51:13 2015 UTC,"Oh, also: if you haven't picked a server yet I suggest either Brandywine (which is my primary server) or Landroval. Both have pretty good populations, though Brandywine does seem a bit busier in lower level areas than what I have seen on Landroval."
lotro,2rewst,Daddyloveshunt,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:53:58 2015 UTC,"It is worth noting that there are other currencies as well. All the various festivals and events carry their own currency that is used to barter for things relative to that festival (rp stuff, cosmetic items etc.) There is also raiding currency in the form of Marks, medallions and seals for use in skirmish camps and almost all of the regions carry their own barter  currency as quest rewards which can be used for items specific to that level for the zone you are in"
lotro,2rewst,CharmingJack,4,Mon Jan 5 23:26:56 2015 UTC,"Hello, Jimm! Welcome to LotRO! As Ellohir said the best way to learn it is just to jump in. The game actually does a decent job of holding new player's hands so to speak. Just read all the little pop ups that it throws at you.   Additionally, the LotRO website and forums are great resources as is Lotro-wiki.com, which has pretty much everything you would need to know. And feel free to ask questions in the World and GLFF chat channels. LoTRO has one of the friendliest communities around.  I'm on the Crickhollow server by the way. I'm just returning after a year absence but I still remember most stuff. You can contact me on Reddit, Steam, or in game. PM me and we can exchange character names. We can learn together. =)"
lotro,2rewst,bronzeart,2,Mon Jan 5 18:05:06 2015 UTC,"I started like you:  I had no idea what an MMO was, except in theory, and started Lotro totally blind.  It has been fantastic!!    Class: The game is set up so that you can really use any kind of class and either solo or team-play through the game, so any class or race you choose is fine, except for one thing: choose the class you LIKE the best.  Don't choose the one you think will do the best in the game, choose the class description that you enjoy.    Do this: Enjoy the game.  Take every low-level quest there is.  Marvel at the detail of the boars in Archet.  Jump into the pools of water and swim around.  When it rains (yes, it rains in the game), run around and see what the rain does in different areas.  Follow the story.  I am not embarrassed to say that it took me a year to reach level 26, because I took my time, went slowly, and thoroughly enjoyed every new quest and every instance.  Eight of us all started at the same time, and we helped each other through the low levels, which means that each of us probably ran the individual quests three or four times, which fine-tuned our fighting skills and honed our sense of what the game was-- and we had fun!!  Don't blast through the levels. I have friends that have done this, and regretted it.  The gameplay and storylines, especially in the low levels, are really, really rich.  Read the text of each encounter, immerse yourself in the experience, and play the game to have fun, not stress over how your traits are optimized for maximum effect-- you'll get all that later.  As others have said, ask questions in the [World] chat, and most everyone will be happy to help you.  Also, click the little emote bubble next to the chat box and look at the lists of emotes and play with them!  It is fun to run up and slap a Blackwold robber right before you start your attack, or mock a Nazgul from a distance.  Enjoy it!"
lotro,2rewst,JKtheSlacker,2,Mon Jan 5 21:56:59 2015 UTC,"Well said. The one thing I would add is, look up. LotRO has fabulous world design, with crazy numbers of ""little details"" that don't necessarily stand out, but make the experience that much richer."
lotro,2rewst,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Wed Jan 7 23:15:23 2015 UTC,"The game takes your hand and carries you on its shoulders from start to finish. I could tell you a trick to level fast (as it's the best one I know), but I doubt you as a new player want to see what's there for you at max level.  If you're new to MMOs entirely, that's only where you'll have problems."
lotro,2rewst,Frodor,1 point,Mon Jan 5 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"Come to Dwarrowdelf! We are very friendly, even if there aren't that many of us!   And in all seriousness, play the class that looks fun to you. Just about all of them are soloable for the levelling process and if not there are other players who are more than willing to help/give advice. I personally enjoy the DPS classes (Hunter, Champion) but just try to have fun and that is the best way to play the game."
lotro,2rewst,Daddyloveshunt,1 point,Mon Jan 5 23:26:22 2015 UTC,The easiest way to pick a class is to gauge how you have played other similar games. Are you a blood thirsty swordsman that likes to rip it up? Pick a champ. Want a technical challenge? Pick a warden. Healer? Minstrel or Runekeeper. Death from afar? Hunter. Dont like to die? Guardian. Sneaky? Burglar. Like to do a bit of evertlything? Captain or Loremaster.

lotro,2rbro3,BrinkMeister,2,Wed Jan 7 23:05:59 2015 UTC,"That one, I wouldn't know about. I tend to play during Oceanic prime time with the Ozzies and Kiwis, so I'm usually curled up with my pillow by the time Europe is awake and active. Although the major events like Weatherstock would be held at a time where Western Europe might just have to stay up a bit later than usual. Eastern Europe, on the other hand, would probably need to pull an all-nighter to attend those."

It was the first time I'd seen the players really embrace the community itself as the ""endgame"" so to speak, with all of the player events and spontaneous concerts and the really positive atmosphere.  I've been playing a little over a year, and I think a couple weeks back was the first time I had seen someone be just outright mean in world chat. Stuff like that is a daily occurrence in other games, but it shocked me in this instance, which says something about the community if it's that infrequent."

Part of that was the music scene - many of the groups performed concerts on both servers to increase exposure.  I just started playing again, and I've noticed that Elendilmir hasn't been as populous as I remembered. I'm fine with that for now though. I might start playing my Landy toons this weekend though."

lotro,2rb4rf,AwesomeExo,5,Sun Jan 4 16:30:54 2015 UTC,"Well, first off there are trait trees now. That equals more specialization. The three options are -   Red- DPS, just straight up fire and lightning attacks Yellow - Support, Debuffing and Crowd control Blue - Master of Beasts, using all your different animals to tank and keep mobs off you.   Speaking personally, I use the Red line as I solo through the game, and generally switch to Yellow for groups. Also, you can still summon pets in the other trait lines, but they won't be as powerful and/or survive as well.   What other questions do you have?"
lotro,2rb4rf,General_DoozenDohntz,3,Sun Jan 4 16:41:57 2015 UTC,i just did the same thing. lore master stopped playing lvl 65 just game back now im 83. really enjoying the game. i think rohan is great but the area around isenguard lvl70-75 sucked i would advise finding another leveling area. just the dunland quests in general i found boring..
lotro,2rb4rf,realbigpanda,3,Sun Jan 4 17:08:16 2015 UTC,"Your pet does far more damage than you'll do the farther you are from level 100. It's pointless to not be traiting blue as a low level. Your lynx can literally one-shot most on-level mobs before you get off Embers.  So, sit back, turn aggressive on your bear/lynx and go get a cup of tea or something while your pet annihilates everything that moves. Yep, that's the state of the game right now.  I haven't gotten my old LM to 66 yet, but in the 50s the lynx does double my damage. I'm really only going red so I can take out multiple mobs from 100% to 0% at the same time with Lightning Storm + lynx aoe claw  If you're in an instance, it might be better to go red as you'll need the AOE.  Speaking of instances, you can go straight to 100 by grinding the Warg Pens of Dol Guldur instance. Would take you like 2 days max if you bought XP boosts with your lifetime account TP.  When you hit 100, trait red. Go back and read up where to get all your trait points for the trait tree, you might have to buy a Quest Pack to get a couple as they are pretty essential. Grind dailies and Pelargir. Enjoy the best gear in the game then go PvP."

lotro,2rcbz8,Enzaraen,4,Sun Jan 4 22:59:19 2015 UTC,"So what the hell is this exploit anyways?  I'm always curious, but nobody will every just out and fucking say what these things are, even though in this case it's quite obvious nobody will fresh start doing it now that the ban hammer is dropping."
lotro,2rcbz8,exploderator,2,Mon Jan 5 06:15:44 2015 UTC,"There was a way to amplify your class trait effectiveness. It took about 2 seconds. You'd spam it 30-40 times and class traits like +25% ranged dmg or +2000 mastery turned into +500% dmg and 200k mastery, etc.  With this you could oneshot everything, allowing you to farm instances at a very increased rate. Using mark tomes (100%) you're looking at 250k marks per hour, which can be turned into rep items -> TP.   Turbine had already banned someone for using this in PVP and he only got 14 days. So everyone started using it outside of the moors. I think like 20 - 30 people got banned on just my server. The fact that they give people who stick to pve with the exploit and don't actually affect other players get the same punishment as someone running around oneshotting other players is just wrong."
lotro,2rcbz8,Dod4r,2,Mon Jan 5 10:52:11 2015 UTC,"See... To us, the players, (the consumers) it doesn't make sense... But to turbine, the more heinous crime was taking money (TP) from them. I'm surprised they didn't make the bans longer."
lotro,2rcbz8,Grimfelion,1 point,Mon Jan 5 19:19:42 2015 UTC,"Most of the offenders were part of the more active level 100 players and make up a big part of the pvp and pve community. I wonder how empty some of the servers are right now.   Besides that most of us have spent upwards to several 100 dollars on just premium services. I'm a lifetimer, but most are probally regular VIPs. I doubt anyone will use this exploit from this point forward, so by permabanning they would cut into their future revenue. Some players might also be inclined to start botting or continue to find other exploits out of anger.  I think future exploits will be less popular, now that turbine have actually banned players for breaking the rules (only took them 8 years)."
lotro,2rcbz8,Dod4r,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:48:47 2015 UTC,"They definitely stepped up their game in terms of punishment for exploiting. I remember the school exploit, where the whole Server ran School in Tham Mirdain to collect seals. No one as far as I know got banned on Anduin. Good old times."

lotro,2rcbz8,Ambassador_Buta,2,Sun Jan 4 23:16:29 2015 UTC,"Please tell me you didn't open up a F2P/bullshit account just to do the exploit, on the same IP that you connected to your real accounts on.  Turbine has some seriously inept CS but they're not completely braindead.  Edit: Proven wrong later"
lotro,2rcbz8,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Sun Jan 4 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"I did it on my main acc, they say they can log the exploit like they log farming so I thought I wouldn't get caught since they're useless at catching farmers."
lotro,2rcbz8,Ambassador_Buta,2,Sun Jan 4 23:40:13 2015 UTC,How long is the ban?
lotro,2rcbz8,Arathaert,0,Sun Jan 4 23:47:43 2015 UTC,"2 weeks, but considering what I managed to get while using it, i'd take the ban anyday"
lotro,2rcbz8,DiscoJer,7,Mon Jan 5 00:45:28 2015 UTC,"That's shameful of Turbine.  I did a test a long time ago and got LotrO on my POS laptop. I switched onto my VPN, made a new F2P account in 3 seconds and logged in. Yelled out in some random server's /glff with flame and hate until a GM came on.   That account got banned until 2040, probably have a pic of it somewhere. Yet you can completely break the game & farm infamy/renown by 1-shotting all the players you come across getting away with only a 2-week ban.  I fully expected you to get perma'd, like you should have as well as the rest of the exploiters.  Sad."
lotro,2rcbz8,Mamabear2004,1 point,Mon Jan 5 00:54:13 2015 UTC,Weird. I thought they were handing out perma bans.... https://www.lotro.com/forums/showthread.php?561241-Important-announcement-about-recent-exploits&p=7288091#post7288091  shrug
lotro,2ray20,zaqq66,10,Sun Jan 4 15:08:20 2015 UTC,"Just doesn't seem like it's the game for you, honestly. I find the graphics gorgeous, with some of the best landscapes in the industry... but truly, most of us are here for the stories and just to be in middle earth, if that isn't enough for you (and I don't mean that in an insulting manner at all) then you probably won't have too much fun."
lotro,2ray20,latusthegoat,4,Sun Jan 4 16:35:23 2015 UTC,did you download the HD version of the graphics?  That could be a mitigating factor
lotro,2ray20,Not2original,7,Sun Jan 4 23:41:02 2015 UTC,"Evendim is what convinced me to be honest. Also, the landscapes are still beautiful, imo, and haven't aged at all. It just seems like this unfortunately isn't the game for you."
lotro,2ray20,comicspolitics,6,Sun Jan 4 15:32:54 2015 UTC,"I'm level 28 human hunter   ...and that´s the problem with Lotro :=) as nimble/flexible as a broom/stick. Try a hobbit/dwarf class and you will notice how better animated both races are compared to humans and elves.  Once you have enough trait points invest in the blue line for more mobility > can shoot while moving and have a setup for CC (Yellow).   I don´t use red line anymore and to your other question:  Yes, the game is much better once you have more skills/traits unlocked and looks better after level 45+ (Eregion, Moria, RoR and so)."
lotro,2ray20,Meatoberfest_Major,5,Sun Jan 4 15:49:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly the graphics are not going to get any better personally I like them the scenery around the lotro map is amazing and for the first 50 levels the map is so detailed.Exploring places like the mines of moria,mirkwood,rohan,gondor mixed in with the story line should keep any lotr fan entertained.  The only real great thing about lotro nowadays is the storyline ( which I think is what keeps most people playing the game) apart from that its just like any other mmo all areas require the sameish quests kill x number of this collect x number of that and get reputation with this fraction and at end game ..well there is no end game anymore.  The hunter class is in my opinion a bit boring just point and shoot especial at low levels its like 3/4 arrows and every mob is dead,try a new class thats more challenging :) warden is really hard to play,champion can be fun just pull every mob you see and aoe them to death."
lotro,2ray20,totalrandomguy,2,Sun Jan 4 16:41:00 2015 UTC,"If you don't like the game then don't force yourself to play it.  What got me to like the game actually were the lower levels (back in 2007). I understand if they suck now because Turbine made it faceroll and threw autobestow quests everywhere. However that doesn't seem to be your issue.  I believe the clunkiness comes from server lag (which has been unacceptably terrible lately). If you're talking about unresponsive skills then that's it.  There are better zones when you level up (and then gets crappier after level 75) I couldn't stand Hunter for some reason. It dies too fast for the damage it deals and has little survivability. My all-time favorite classes are Burg, Champ, Guard, LM, RK & Warden. You might have more fun if you reroll.  Alternatively, you could try Monster Play, but it's like a circus. A circus of lag. There are a lot of players that really only play this game to be an orc. You never know if you could be one of them.  Try following the Volume 1 epic story up to the end of book 15. Do the quests in the zones it brings you to. If you aren't hooked by Moria then the game isn't for you."

lotro,2ray20,Satarash,5,Mon Jan 5 13:32:45 2015 UTC,How does the lag not make you want to put your head through a wall though? What are your PC specs and what settings are you playing on?
lotro,2ray20,CharmingJack,1 point,Mon Jan 5 17:30:43 2015 UTC,"I lower the settings to low when in Rohan. Visuals suffer a lot which is acceptable to me but I suppose not to everyone. Fair point.  Also, I have played only in East Rohan so far, maybe the lag is worse elsewhere."
lotro,2ray20,Satarash,2,Mon Jan 5 19:04:48 2015 UTC,"Ahhhh, okay. I didn't want to do that but if I have no choice..."
lotro,2ray20,CharmingJack,2,Mon Jan 5 19:40:56 2015 UTC,"It depends on how you play it. I love my hunter on its WS, and I can solo just about anything, but on my Guardian its a lot less fun and a lot more grind."
lotro,2ray20,stueyg,1 point,Mon Jan 5 01:33:34 2015 UTC,Bad enough to make me grind one instance to get to 100.  Actually that's a good thing then because I got to 100 way faster than questing would've ever done for me.
lotro,2ray20,Ambassador_Buta,2,Sun Jan 4 23:52:09 2015 UTC,"It is SO boring at low levels, maybe make an alt on an rp server (Laurelin EU, Landroval NA, Belegaer DE)  Are you a raider/pvper or Rper?  EDIT: I should say I am a PVP/PVEr, 7 years, r13 so I know some stuff."

Thank you guys for all the helpful replies and have fun playing the game"
lotro,2ray20,Wolfbane5001,0,Sun Jan 4 18:00:12 2015 UTC,"I'd try something else besides the hunter. It's a really boring class. Stand far away, smack some arrows into some guy, and hope he dies before he reaches you. The most fun classes imo are minstrel, Lore Master, and if you want to pay money, Beorning. Beornings are basically massive burst DPS when you turn into a bear with a few heal skills and some defesive skills. Burgs are stealth assasins but don't last long in combat. And Lore Masters(or as I call them: Science Mages) are debuff/aoe/heal classes and can change their role based on their pet.  You probably don't want to go hunter,anyways. The most used classes are Hunter, Champion, and Guardian. Those three are also considered 'basic' which are the easymode/boring classes that can faceroll their keyboard and win almost anything anyways.  EDIT:Accidentally wrote Captian instead of Champion"
lotro,2ray20,CharmingJack,2,Sun Jan 4 22:50:51 2015 UTC,I think you are confusing Champ with Cappy in that last paragraph.

lotro,2ray20,freedaemons,1 point,Mon Jan 5 20:18:35 2015 UTC,"Guardians certainly are not among the most used classes, on landy, at least... Because it can be tedious to level them, even more so than cappies, despite them having higher dps than captains. There are so few guards at endgame."

lotro,2ray20,CharmingJack,1 point,Mon Jan 5 02:44:57 2015 UTC,Also Crickhollow. In my experience Champions are far more common than Captains just because it's simple HacknSlash. Massive damage with no responsibility.

Just for the reference of other people who visit your thread, besides thermal issues for PCs, on laptops it's likely that networks cards could be serving up poor connections too, many ship with crappy ones and most people spend money upgrading the cpus and memory only.

lotro,2r6zho,Kal_Vas_Flam,8,Sat Jan 3 10:08:55 2015 UTC,"I'll try and do the math, though I'm not 100% sure I'll be correct about what comes with what.  The subscription makes you a VIP and gives you access to all quest packs except Mines of Moria, Siege of Mirkwood, Rise of Isengard, Riders of Rohan, and Helm's Deep. Those are expansions and you'll have to buy them separately.   $15 for subscription per month. Getting the Quad Pack for $19.99 gets you Moria, Mirkwood, Isengard, and RoR. Helm's Deep base edition costs $19.99 as well.   As for classes, buying the Moria expansion will give you access to Rune-keeper and Warden, and I think Beornings should be free for VIPs (RK and Warden might be free as well but I'm not 100% sure). Beornings need to be bought separately.  PVP is also free for VIPs.  I hope this helps!"
lotro,2r6zho,leppard93,4,Sat Jan 3 13:30:17 2015 UTC,Pretty sure Beorning isn't free for VIPs
lotro,2r6zho,rogash102,2,Sat Jan 3 13:40:35 2015 UTC,Thanks! I wasn't sure. I'll edit accordingly.

I guess it is not all that likely I end up buying everything at one go. Yet, it really  felt like a factor to know the cost of unlocking them doors in future.     Last I looked into LOTRO, I don't think the Quad Pack thing was around. It seems of good value!"
lotro,2r6zho,capgras_delusion,1 point,Sat Jan 3 16:48:53 2015 UTC,"The $20 deal was actually a sale on Helm's Deep and the Quad Pack. They're usually $40 each.   Keep an eye on the Steam store and other sites for bigger sales, though. Steam just had one over the holidays where Helm's Deep and the Quad Pack were $10 each. There won't be another sale like that for a while, but if you're just starting out in the game this week, you have some time to wait."
lotro,2r6zho,WelCZa,2,Mon Jan 5 20:12:55 2015 UTC,"As for classes, Rune-Keeper and warden are free only with Moria expansion (don't know how's it in Quad pack), otherwise they are paid even for VIPs. Beornings are paid."
lotro,2r6zho,leppard93,2,Sat Jan 3 15:05:48 2015 UTC,The Quad Pack page lists RK and Warden as part of it.    Heal or deal damage with a Rune-keeper or use powerful attack combos and self-healing as a Warden!   I'll correct Beornings.
lotro,2r6zho,ninjanick95,2,Sat Jan 3 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"VIP isn't even all that good of a deal anymore IMO. Once you get into expansion content, VIP does less and less for you. I bought all the quest areas as I leveled, and have never regretted it. I've played on and off for years across 6 or 7 different characters, and I've definitely gotten better value. At this point I would never even consider VIP."
lotro,2r6zho,cyanpill,3,Sat Jan 3 16:02:51 2015 UTC,"It might still be worth going vip for one month, since you get one time unlocks with all character's played while vip. You save something 1000tp per character this way."
lotro,2r6zho,tobascodagama,3,Sat Jan 3 18:48:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a good idea to buy at least a month of VIP time to get the unlocks, plus the bonus XP and the TP stipend.  I'll also note that Helm's Deep (2013) was the last expansion, and everything since then is free to VIPs again. Signs are that this pattern will continue at least through the end of 2015.  So, that might be a factor in considering whether to resubscribe after level 95. There's no good reason to subscribe between levels 50-95, though. You need to pay for expansions in that level band whether you're VIP or not."
lotro,2r6zho,ninjanick95,2,Sat Jan 3 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"Ah, that is true. I believe you get a month free when you buy one of the physical expansions though."

As the gerbils that run Turbine's servers tend to start dying, you will have lag problems but if you want a ""healthy"" population you have few other choices.  To be honest you could just get the expansions up to Mirkwood and grind warg pens to 100 but you will be missing a lot of trait points."

lotro,2r0pxu,Barrab,6,Thu Jan 1 17:46:15 2015 UTC,"I'll give it a shot OP...  Guardian: Main Tank no problem. All the way from Duo to 24 man raids. Can DPS (and off tank in this capacity) but not great. With the right build you'll hold your own... But if someone asks for DPS in chat don't volunteer. ;) Warden: Main Tank no problem. DPS on big bosses (due to DoT not so good on trash mobs) VERY survivable if you figure out how to play it right. Champ: Can tank most(all) fellowship content and IIRC, top tier champs can tank raids. The problem with champs tanking is their limited threat gen. It's mostly DPS related. It's possible, and some champs I've seen do it quite well but that's not the guarantee. DPS wise they are top tier, and really excel at AOE damage. Captains: tank wise same as Champs. Do decent DPS... But they really excel at buffing and supporting the group. I believe they can primary heal 3 man groups as well. Hunter: Solo target DPS all day every day. They have limited AOE and can use traps but that's become less possible lately in raids. RK: Epic DPS or Epic heals... They use HoT as opposed to straight heals like minstrels but they do a great job if played right.  Minstrels: Your healers. Great at it. Love em. They can also DPS, but no one will ever let you do it in a group. ;) LMs: Moooore DPS. They rip up the battlefield. Their pets are strong. They can do good AOE and single target DPS. They used to be the Kings of CC but AFAIK turbine more or less eliminated CC mechanics in raids. They can heal (if they're talented) 3 man content. Burglars: I know almost nothing about them but AFAIK they can buff the group indirectly and/or DPS like crazy on single targets. Beorning: haven't had enough time with them to give you anything. Sorry!  Hope that helps mate!! Cheers and welcome!!"
lotro,2r0pxu,Grimfelion,3,Thu Jan 1 20:38:52 2015 UTC,"This game does have tank/healing, you might have been thinking of some other game like GW2 that doesn't have them.  Each class in LOTRO has a few ways they can be specialized. These traitlines are color coordinated, red, blue and yellow. In most cases, red is the damage dealing line, blue is the healing or tanking or otherwise survivable line, and yellow is some sort of support like crowd control. It's a bit more complex then that, but I just wanted to give a quick summery."
lotro,2r0pxu,cyanpill,3,Thu Jan 1 17:53:55 2015 UTC,"I understand that, but as far as I'm concerned some of those specializations are not really on pair with some other class specializations.  Let me try to explain, english is not my main language.  Captain has a healing tree! Does this means he can actually be a ""healer"" enter a dungeon group and heal it fully like a minstrel does? Or enter a raid and be one of the main healers? OR having the healing tree means he has the ability to do some heals but never be a main healer, more like a buffer or a helper to another healer? I know that the support role exists in the game and thats awesome, and I also know that Caps can do that role quite well...but are they capable of being The Healer or not really?  Thats what I want to know.   Same doubts with the Beorn or the Champion tank, etc, etc."
lotro,2r0pxu,cyanpill,1 point,Thu Jan 1 19:37:02 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much recently as well, so I'm not an expert. But from what I hear captains can heal and tank quite well. The dps isn't great, but since they provide buffs your groups dps would be higher.  I believe beorn aren't good at healing because of how the skills work, but not many people have them to give a good perspective."
lotro,2r0pxu,Niwre,1 point,Thu Jan 1 19:49:02 2015 UTC,"Captains can main heal a 3 man fellowship. When the group has 6 or more members, the group needs a Minstrel or a Rune Keeper.   My Captain can do decent healing in a raid, but it is the cherry on the healing pie that makes healing and power management easier. However, during trash pulls the heals of a Captain is often sufficient if there is a good tank. The captain also has an in-combat rez.   Captains can tank. But not everything. Small instances can be done if you're skilled and have a good healer."
lotro,2r0pxu,Drevs,1 point,Sat Jan 3 13:56:34 2015 UTC,"I think the OP knows that as far as I understand his post. I think what he means(and my doubts as well) are more related to the viability of each specialization tree.  For example Captains got a Tank tree, but as I'm concerned they cant really tank a dungeon or a raid as the main tank. See what I mean?  Same as the Beorn, which was my post question. He has a healing tree but  I don think you can bring a beorn to a dungeon as the only healer, cause he wont be able to fulfill that role that well.  Thats why I think the OP asked for, a list of what roles can each class fulfill and specified if they can do it lightly or at full capacity."

lotro,2r0pxu,tfp_sa,2,Thu Jan 1 17:51:29 2015 UTC,"Lotro wiki is fairly good for this sort of thing.  The way it's 'supposed' to work, and pretty much does, is something vaguely along the lines of the really top tier specialists [e.g. being the main player of a certain role in a raid on-level] being:  Primary damage - hunter/RK/arguably burglar [single target], champion [AOE]. Primary healer - minstrel/RK. Primary tank - guardian/warden. Primary buffing - captain. Primary debuffing - LM, burglar.  And then there's loads of 'next bests', e.g.   Secondary healing - captain, arguably LM. No others [beorning aside] can really do it at all. Secondary tanking - arguably champ/captain, no others really. Secondary damage - almost all can do decent damage in some build or other."
lotro,2r0pxu,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Fri Jan 2 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"This is all in the character selection screen.  Burglars were mezzers and were supporters but now they, just like every class, dps.  If you want to do instances make like a Captain. Everyone pretty much needs a captain in an instance. Or something that can heal like a Minnie/RK. Captains can heal good too but they're usually there for buffs.  Any heavy armor class can tank as long as they can hold threat. Champions used to be legit tanks till that was removed. Now the go-to tank is the Guardian. Wardens also refuse to die.  But really all of this doesn't matter because instances and raids are really goddamn easy. Pick a class and have fun."

Of the three 'lines':  Tanking seems to be the worst, seems to be in no way a remotely viable substitute for a guardian;  DPS [melee, nearly all single target] is pretty good but everything I've heard from those who really make an effort to 'get under the bonnet' of the game suggests that it can't compete with say hunters.  The yellow 'healing' build is actually very interesting, but ultimately as OP says quite captain-ish I suppose... by the standards of the specialist healers [rk, mini] the actual healing output is so-so, but not at all shabby & it offers quite a few interesting little other bits & pieces..."
lotro,2qwbyf,thebaconatorman,9,Wed Dec 31 06:30:43 2014 UTC,"Look, as a person who complains plenty about LOTRO, I still stand with you that LOTRO is great, and make no mistake about it.  I see the movies as a minor secondary concern, I came here from the books as many have, and have little interest in a nine hour treatment of such an incredible fantasy space.  The game is arguably the one medium that stands a real chance of doing the books proper justice, precisely because it gives players the chance to deeply explore and experience Middle Earth without constraints on time, and from the first-person perspective that all of us hunger for, of course we want to be there.  The chance to explore Middle Earth ourselves is truly precious.  But here's what really hurts: It begs to be so much better than what Turbine has achieved.  The potential is so huge, the content is mostly there, the mechanisms and systems are so close to being everything that's needed.  But Turbine has failed to go the last mile, in almost every single way possible.  Beyond the occasional bits of gross incompetence, it's mostly a case of economics, the practical fact that a for-profit company will never spend the huge money needed to truly polish the product to the degree of perfection that passionate artists and fans will always desire.  Much of the mess is just an innocent byproduct of the historical evolution of the game.  There are so many quests and instances, so much gear, that was all once relevant for a few months, back when level 50, 65, 75, 85, 95 was level cap, but now they all just clutter the game.  So much tantalizing shit you can never earn by the time you've leveled far past it, or will never get to play on servers with low populations.  So much of LOTRO has become litter along the road of leveling.  Turbine will never afford the time to clean it up, and we the players have no access to do it ourselves, for passion instead of profit.  My motive for criticism is not to diminish LOTRO, it is to simply remain clear, so that chances for improvement may be won, not squandered."
lotro,2qwbyf,exploderator,10,Wed Dec 31 17:53:36 2014 UTC,"The world they recreated far outdoes the play, IMHO. I have 5 characters level capped but love using the turtle and rolling a new one again - just like I did last week - and will do again in a few months when this one is capped."
lotro,2qwbyf,olddaad,4,Wed Dec 31 16:59:43 2014 UTC,I loved LOTRO when it launched and spent years there.  To me the grindfest that it's become makes everything after Moria just dismal to play so I don't spend my time in the game anymore.   I loved the Shire though - and found my way through endless adventures (remember running the Rift!?!) and made wonderful friends for the first few years.  Moria is still my favorite area and I am glad I invested the time and money I did into the game.
lotro,2qwbyf,alemap000,2,Wed Dec 31 19:35:14 2014 UTC,God so many memories left in the rift and angmar.  I miss those days when I could play 2-3 hrs a night. I'm lucky if I get 2-3 a week

lotro,2qwbyf,Ambassador_Buta,3,Wed Dec 31 07:24:21 2014 UTC,"This sentiment! I have to somewhat disagree though... I'm in sort of a middle ground: I am a fan of the books first and foremost like many of us, but actually I felt the art direction in the films was closer in many ways to what I always have in my head. The game always feels a little overly ornate for some reason.   Take the Shire for example. The film's hobbit holes are literally just doors and windows in the earth. The game has all kinds of little roofs and awnings and stuff which make them feel like little Oompa Loompa buildings. Or clothing... for example, film Aragorn wears a very plain shirt, duster and cloak, but the Rangers in game are all done up fancy-like.   Don't get me wrong, environment-wise LOTRO Is beautiful. The landscapes and terrain are gorgeous. But everything man-made (or elf- or dwarf-made) is just a little too fanciful; film buildings and clothing appear plausible like they could exist, the game stuff feels like it defies physics or utility.   The perfect blend would be a game that is LOTRO in scope and gameplay, with world-building by Turbine and level- and character-design by Weta. :)"

Be advised, less than half of Angmar is open to you until you complete Vol I, Book 6. There are a line of statues that will kill you instantly if you try to pass them.   At this stage, you should be able to follow the epic quest line as it takes you through Eriador. As you do epic quests, you should find more than enough local quest hubs to help you level up.

There will be a few fellowship quests in Aughaire, don't bother with them unless you have friends to help you. While you're doing all this in Angmar, make sure you do the Epic in order to unlock the rest of Angmar.  You should get to 43-44 at the end of Aughaire, at this point i'd advise going to Forochel until 45. At 45 go down to the entrance to the Walls of Moria (South-Eastern edge of Eregion), pick up the beginning of Volume 2 and do all the quests that will be red to you, they are all relatively easy at 5 levels below and will get you up at least one level, not to mention at the end you will get your legendary weapon and item.   At this point you should be level 46-47, head back to Forochel and level until 48 then head down to Eregion and quest until you hit 50.

In regards to dungeons being identical, the devs have went in over past updates and improved them.    And the dungeon camping was a symptom of launch.  Like every mmo people are scrunched together at the beginning and start to spread out over time.  Now single player is much more immersive and you have people to play with from time to time (Sadly unlike LOTRO).  The writing is great and the story is immersive, plus dungeons and PvP are amazing now.  It has really improved since launch.  There have been 5 big updates packed full of improvements with a huge sixth coming in January/Febuary.    I voted for LOTRO but people are really bashing ESO without knowing what it is like now."
lotro,2quuxo,mithrandirbooga,3,Wed Dec 31 16:47:21 2014 UTC,"people are really bashing ESO without knowing what it is like now.   I gave it a ton of chances. I excused all the bugs in Beta and still bought the Imperial edition. My first 3 months after launch were not fun to play, and that's all I can base my opinion on. They lost me, and it really doesn't matter if it's better now, because I'm not playing now, and I really don't have the energy to invest into MMOs anymore anyway."
lotro,2quuxo,Destiron,2,Wed Dec 31 20:12:55 2014 UTC,Isn't that a problem though? If it wasn't good for the first few months why would I stick around and keep playing it? Shouldn't you have a compelling gameplay right from the get-go?
lotro,2quuxo,Destiron,2,Wed Dec 31 17:14:09 2014 UTC,"O ya it is a problem.  However, it is a problem that plagues almost every single MMO.  AA, RIFT, WoW, Eve, even LOTRO (LOTRO launched as a group centric MMO without raids) had the same problem and stabilized or are stabilizing as time goes on.  That is why I usually wait a few months after launch before judging if it is worth playing.  Especially dont judge it during beta expecting a high quality product."
lotro,2qw6rc,thinkingthought,13,Wed Dec 31 05:34:49 2014 UTC,"It did, it peaked a number of years ago. Now its just a shell of a game with a damn good story line."
lotro,2qw6rc,smalli,3,Wed Dec 31 06:04:22 2014 UTC,"I think in terms of marketing, the producers' perspective is that the primary player base are LoTR fans, who would have come to hear about it simply by virtue of association. People who weren't already LoTR fans in the first place are not necessary to market to: LoTR has a much older and established reputation than LOTRO, there is no sense in trying to market LoTR through a game, to people who didn't already like it.  IMO it's a similar kind of phenomenon that SW:TOR sees: The producers of the game see it as a game for story/universe geeks, not gamers, so they don't think it has any potential to become something big. Mass appeal is all big companies care about, and games with proprietary IP that constitute some kind of sectioned-off interest group don't fulfil that need for them, at least, from their perspective."
lotro,2qw6rc,freedaemons,3,Wed Dec 31 06:48:18 2014 UTC,I think people overwrite value marketing and undervalue developers screwing up or not receiving a sufficient % of the money coming in.  I also think the average person is SWTOR is more main stream than LOTRO. People's behavior that I ran into in LOTRO is far better than in SWTOR and the average knowledge of lore was much higher in LOTRO.
lotro,2qw6rc,lotrofellalready,1 point,Wed Dec 31 23:07:15 2014 UTC,"That's too bad. I never really cared for LOTR. At most, I'm a passive moviegoer, but I love the MMO. I really got into it, even without knowing the book lore behind it all."
lotro,2qw6rc,loveNyeGuy,6,Sun Jan 4 02:42:09 2015 UTC,"The game peaked during MoM & SoM. While both expansions had certain flaws, they provided a great deal of end-game content. RoI, while still good, was of lesser quality but the game continued to do well.   RoR is the worst expansion imaginable. Mounted combat is a disgrace. No raids till months after the release and they weren't even raids, they were glorified skirmishes. This is where the game was killed.   HD wasn't good enough to revive it. Instead of going back to content that had proven to work (a raid), they release big battles. Some classes got butchered in the class revamp.  We can only hope for the 2015 producers letter to tell us some good things, or I fear most of us will just be along to see the end rather then enjoying the game as we once used to.  I think the fact that people still run ToO shows that people do want raids. Even the 'casual' playerbase which turbine seems to think want nothing but festivals and more level caps and more meaningless grind."
lotro,2qw6rc,Dod4r,2,Wed Dec 31 11:18:05 2014 UTC,"It already did.  ROI wasn't that great but some people liked it. Then, ROR came and basically nobody liked it.  An MMO can hang on by the skin of it's teeth as long as some people like it and people like playing with those people. I log into LOTRO occasionally, as I still like looking into my house and doing a few things I remember being fun. My friends list which was full has a list of people all quit within a few weeks of each other. A few have come back and transferred servers.  Currently, I play SWTOR the only thing keeping me in game is I introduced one of my friends to it and they played it initially because they wanted to play with me. If another game came out that they liked and wanted to swap to I would likely swap to it instantly."
lotro,2qw6rc,lotrofellalready,3,Wed Dec 31 22:43:58 2014 UTC,"I think it never really caught on like the movies because the game was not particularly casual friendly, and while they have moved somewhat in that direction, it's still not.  For instance, when the game launched, you couldn't get a horse until level 35. And then you had to do a surprisingly lengthy quest. Yeah, it was a cool feeling when you finally got one. But until then, you had to walk everywhere. North Downs, Trollshaws and Rivendell, Lonelands.   For another, the game is grindy as hell. It's incredibly slow leveling (to the point where I've played for 6 years and don't have a level cap character despite sinking 600 hours into the game) and you have to constantly fiddle with things like Legendary Items and Virtues. They are time sinks meant to keep the hard core busy, but they just keep casual players down.  It made something of a comeback with F2P, but then mounted combat pretty much killed off the game (it's awful), then the last XP no one liked - it was focused on grouping, but not traditional raids, so both solo players and raiders hated it."
lotro,2qw6rc,DiscoJer,5,Wed Dec 31 08:01:02 2014 UTC,"I'm only a casual player (1 hour per day, more or less) and I've only played LOTRO for 4 years now. I have 2 level 100 characters and 3 others between level 90 and 95. Perhaps you have too much alts.  The only grind I experience is the virtue grind. Before update 13 (if I remember well), squishy classes were very powerful and virtues had no value but since that update, the only way of playing is by having good levels in some virtues otherwise you die too quickly. When you start leveling these virtues nearly from the start and for several characters, it's a really painful and boring grind.  And about mounted combat, I suppose it's a matter of taste. I like it but I admit it's better for some classes than others. It's probably less fun with melee classes I think."
lotro,2qw6rc,olilo,3,Wed Dec 31 12:25:35 2014 UTC,"Agreed about the mounted combat. I think that is pretty good for ranged classes, but haven't tried it on melee classes yet. Overall I found it much better than the vocal ones who complained about it. I ran into very little of the technical issues like rubber banding that bothered so many people."
lotro,2qw6rc,notwhoithink,1 point,Wed Dec 31 12:39:19 2014 UTC,I agree about the horse issue. Didn't end up getting one until 44 in SoA.  But this game is super casual friendly and there is almost no grinding.  I went from 65-100 in about 70 hours.
lotro,2qw6rc,angbad,5,Wed Dec 31 08:51:05 2014 UTC,"shit marketing (hobbit movie coming out? No ads for lotro anywhere), bad development choices, oppressive korean-grind f2p, treating pvp as a failed abortion"
lotro,2qw6rc,Ambassador_Buta,5,Wed Dec 31 07:27:45 2014 UTC,"It was raised recently on the forums about movie tie-in advertising and Turbine explained that they did it in the past and saw little return for the massive cost of advertising on that scale. Cheaper, better targeted advertising has always worked better for them."
lotro,2qw6rc,stueyg,2,Wed Dec 31 08:54:56 2014 UTC,"Cheaper, better targeted advertising has always worked better for them.   I don't recall ever seeing an advertisement for LotrO after SoM (on TV atleast). Strangely that was also the time where this game had the most players. The Hobbit movies were the best place one could advertise anything LotR related. Imagine if a BfME 3 was announced there.  Shit, there's a goddamn MMO voting poll going on and Turbine doesn't even make any mention of its existence. The community has to do it through their forums. Meanwhile, ESO has it on their login page.  And on the other hand we have WoW putting up TV ads for its expansion. From their subscriber numbers it seems to be working. People know that game exists.  I think I have to go ahead and state the obvious by concluding that Turbine just doesn't want to spend any more money on this game than they have to. They really just don't give a shit."
lotro,2qw6rc,Ambassador_Buta,1 point,Wed Dec 31 18:41:00 2014 UTC,It peaked before it went f2p and added a cash shop. I loved this game until they added the cash shop. Myself and most of my kinship quit when it was announced.
lotro,2qw6rc,v1ct0r1us,2,Thu Jan 1 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say Siege of Mirkwood was its peak. Mines of Moria was definitely its peak--after its poor release is when people first started to leave. SoM brought some people back, but that nine-month drought of content up until the launch of F2P is definitely what killed the game off. I don't know how they thought nine months of no content would've kept people playing."

lotro,2qtafv,cbstryker,1 point,Wed Dec 31 12:51:43 2014 UTC,Try deleting the Lies Lord of the Rings Online folder from your My Documents. This will erase any screenshots and all of your in-game preferences and settings.  Edit: damn autocorrect

lotro,2qu44t,MayorOfHobbiton,7,Tue Dec 30 18:28:14 2014 UTC,"Why would it make sense?  There is some lore behind why the captain is man-only. The book archetype is obviously Boromir, Faramir and Aragorn. Elves would make sense but they actually kept to themselves (they were leaving middle earth) during the war.   Dwarves? Dwarves aren't really ones for inspiring/leading other races. Elves certainly would never want to follow them. Hobbits? Turns out short people have a tough time leading, probably because nobody can see them.   side note: i always thought burglar should be hobbit only."
lotro,2qu44t,DuneBug,1 point,Tue Dec 30 18:43:18 2014 UTC,"Good point!   My theory was that each race would have a leader in battle. For example, Elrond led the battle on the slopes of mount doom, and Dane led the dwarves to battle in Erebor"
lotro,2qu44t,DuneBug,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:26:06 2014 UTC,"Yeah I don't really have an issue with that. It seems kind of weird that the only single-race class is captain. (well, before beornings anyway) If I had my way   dwarves would be the only option for guardian.  Elves would be the only wardens. Hobbits could be champions  People probably wouldn't like that though. Gotta like that variety."
lotro,2qu44t,Staerke,1 point,Tue Dec 30 23:34:03 2014 UTC,"According to the lore, players who pick Hobbits should sit at home smoking and tending gardens.  There were great Elf and Dwarf captains and since there's no racial tensions between free peoples in this game it doesn't make sense NOT to open captain up to other races."
lotro,2qu44t,DuneBug,3,Tue Dec 30 19:23:23 2014 UTC,"According to lore hobbits occasionally went on adventures but it was always hushed up. Seems legit. You'd be hard-pressed to find a dwarf in the third age that would follow an elf as their leader, or an elf that would follow a dwarf. Also I'm pretty sure there are the occasional racial tensions between dwarves and elves in the plot.  But if you're just going to ignore lore entirely why not open up all classes to all races? Why stop at captain. need more hobbit RK's imo."
lotro,2qu44t,Staerke,1 point,Tue Dec 30 20:28:49 2014 UTC,RK  Ignore lore entirely   ;)
lotro,2qu44t,DuneBug,1 point,Wed Dec 31 03:37:15 2014 UTC,No no good sir there was a minor footnote in the silmarillion ... And thus rks use more magic than wizards! Seems legit!
lotro,2qu44t,Robertlnu,3,Wed Dec 31 17:28:46 2014 UTC,"Well not according to the lore.  It would ""make sense"" from a player perspective to allow all classes available to all races. But the reason why they do what they do is because what they do is the lore of the books."

I'm a bit of a ""Deed-aholic"", I've completed almost every single deed up into Rohan (including a number of hidden and meta deeds).  Boogrim, Level 100 Guardian."
