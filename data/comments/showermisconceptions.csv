Each shower lasts from 10 minutes to 30 minutes, so we'll just go with a baseline of 20 minutes.  365.25 days in a year (leap years) and the average person started showering at about age.. 9? I don't know, let's go with that.  And you will probably live to about age 80.  80 - those first 8 years (before 9 y/o) is 71 years * 365.25 gives us the amount of days you have showered and then you multiply that times 20 minutes to give us the amount of minutes.
