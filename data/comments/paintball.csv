paintball,3e3hia,helpprogram2,12,Tue Jul 21 17:50:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't owned my own field but I worked for fields for a very long time and helped others set up their own fields.   Biggest investment is almost always land. Land is incredibly expensive and typically one of the most cost-prohibitive investments. You'll need to make fields/obstacles that are relatively easy to maintain because no one wants to play on a disgustingly dirty course. If you do want speedball, you'll want to invest a couple grand in an air ball setup. You'll also need netting and a netting system, of course.   You'll also need good rental equipment (masks/pods/markers/small packs), air fill (CO2/HPA), insurance, and paint to start off. Obviously you'll need a POS (cash register/point-of-sale), building, staging area, drinks, and other tertiary equipment to run the business.   Your bread and butter are rentals, casual players, and parties. As much as tournament/speedball players like to toot their own horn, they are not the biggest money maker in owning a field. Corporate clients (team building exercises!), bachelor/bachelorette parties, birthday parties, walk-ons, etc are the main cash flow.   The biggest struggle is maintaining profitability. When you start a business, you'll struggle to pay yourself anything since all costs must be taken care of first. Finding the balance between attracting both casual and higher level players while staying profitable is a huge challenge. There are tons of hidden costs to watch out for."
paintball,3e3hia,mankstar,6,Tue Jul 21 18:25:44 2015 UTC,"Everything this guy said. My dad owns a field but im not at liberty to divulge the cash numbers.   One big thing you have to look at is if it is going to be indoor or outdoor. I live in the desert, Indoor thrives during the summer but is pretty dead during the winter. With indoor you might have a HUGE overhead with the heating/cooling costs. Our field is outdoor and we are almost completely solar powered except for our compressor and a few backup generators.  At the beginning it was very disheartening the first few months because it was pretty slow. You need to be prepared for this as it can take a while to get a steady player base. At the beginning you need to make it enticing to come play there, hit up a local forum and post up with some free days of play so people can come check it out. We started out by letting people play for free while we were finishing construction.   And like Mankster said, Rentals and weekend warriors will be your bread and butter. Make some fields that look like towns or call of duty levels because thats what the casual players want. Dont rely on listening to a ""Pro speedballer"" because they will want to make the field something that they like. Not what the casual players like.  Be friendly! Our field went from a little field that was told would never succeed into the busiest park in our state at the moment. We went from 15-20 people a saturday to 200-250 people during the winter and 150 during the summer. All because our field is known for its family friendly environment and staff (And its awesome playing fields).   We use converted shipping containers as offices an rental storage. This works well because they are difficult to break into and relatively cheap to rent/buy. We rent ours for roughly 300 a month right now and it even has a an ac unit and is wired for lights.   If you have any questions I would be more than happy to answer whatever I can!"
paintball,3e3hia,tsrui480,4,Tue Jul 21 19:01:40 2015 UTC,"At the beginning it was very disheartening the first few months because it was pretty slow. You need to be prepared for this as it can take a while to get a steady player base.    As with any business, prepare to pay yourself less than minimum wage for a long time until you drum up even revenue to begin paying back your costs!  Not to discourage anyone, but rather a plead to look at it realistically so you will properly be prepared for the daunting task of being a business owner.   Just remember, it's exactly that. You are a business owner and have to operate it as such. An idyllic paintball paradise sounds awesome, but if it's not making money then you're just gonna go out of business and owe a lot of money!"

As far as the money went, the field, paint, rentals, staff, and everything was donated from sponsors or the field owners and whatever you paid for went straight to the charity. For example, I paid 35 for entry and 55 for a case of paint, so the hospital received all $90 of that. They also had various little fundraisers throughout the day like silent auctions and raffles.  The event was probably one of the most well-run events I've ever been to. I've never had a check in process go that smoothly. The game itself was pretty wet as there was a lot of water covering the field but I had a good time getting muddy.  It was a big-game scenario format with two teams of a few hundred people on each side with different missions you could run for extra points.

Valspar agrees to buy X number of cases from mnpropaintball at cost or just above and donates it to the game? X being defined in advance or whatever is used the day of the game.

paintball,3e0j6r,zaxfee,2,Tue Jul 21 01:25:03 2015 UTC,"They're 1x red/green dots.  He had one on his and it made shooting very instinctive, I found personally. Put the red dot on the bad guy and press the trigger."
paintball,3e0j6r,kapyrna,3,Tue Jul 21 01:26:53 2015 UTC,"Really only good out to 15 yards, but yeah.  Running dual was fun.  See if you can get a tank with two remotes off of it and run each to a pistol.  SHP reg should get you the right pressure into your guns.  Or just run around crazylike popping 12grams."
paintball,3e0j6r,kapyrna,2,Tue Jul 21 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"My friend said he had issues with HPA, like he couldn't get past 260fps even cranked up to the max. Is it a know issue ?"
paintball,3e0j6r,Cookedmonkey,4,Tue Jul 21 01:39:56 2015 UTC,"The TiPX was designed for CO2 which has a working pressure higher than most HPA tanks.  My Ninja SHP reg outputs 1100psi, standard is 850 if I'm remembering correctly.  /u/Ninjahavekk can confirm?  The newer TCR which uses very similar if not the same parts has an updated engine that works better with HPA at normal pressures.  All I had to do to mine is turn in the smaller of the screws at the back adjuster, though turning in too much can over pressurise your engine and cause problems.  If you do this, take your time and do it right so you don't end up on the phone with Tippmann."
paintball,3e0j6r,Cookedmonkey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:47:07 2015 UTC,"I'll stick to 12g Co2 just for now. I can get 40 shots off before swapping cartridges (and I thought up a rig to swap both cartridges at once) and I still don't have much hours played on the field. I'll tell him too about the reg output thing, he told me his made loud spring noises when he cranked HPA too high. Kinda scared be tbh"
paintball,3e0j6r,zaxfee,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:55 2015 UTC,40 shots? Can you set up my TipX for me please? I get about 20 at 280fps
paintball,3e0j6r,thelao,2,Tue Jul 21 02:24:42 2015 UTC,"20 shots per gun, I meant. I can't really aim with two guns at once, so the incentive to dual wield is reloading less often."

paintball,3e0j6r,Danabler42,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:37:02 2015 UTC,Running a game or two pistol only with the 12 grams isn't terrible. That's how I started doing it before getting larger mags and the remote line adapter.
paintball,3e0j6r,kapyrna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:43 2015 UTC,"But playing a whole game on 12 grams and only 21 paintballs can get tedious. Was looking into getting the M17 SMG, that way I can use the Zetas for both my main and secondary."

paintball,3e1ze3,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:18:25 2015 UTC,Yea I use to hit up splat action all the time back in the day I'm sure they have changed all their fields around since then. I also just ordered an axe pro I'm prolly a week or 2 out before I get everything pretty stoked about it. Quick question is splat action still the best place in the area or are there other spots that are good that you or anyone know of?
paintball,3e1ze3,Swiss_Army_Penis,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:31:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah last time I played was about 6 years ago, and it's amazing what was considered good back then is considered crap now haha. And nah splat action is pretty similar. They have 2 hyperball fielda now tho instead of one and a speedball field. And I'm not sure. I have a couple friends who are pro players though so I'll have to ask them about fields."
paintball,3e1ze3,bigjuan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:38:26 2015 UTC,Cool I'll prolly spend most of my time there once I get going.

Took me about a year to get my timmy into working condition.  Great gun now.  BTW, unless you have your heart set on a first gen, don't get a first gen.  WAS board is either worth 20 dollars or 80 dollars, depending on what version."
paintball,3e2y5r,PiratePantsFace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:03:30 2015 UTC,"First gen Timmy, released in early 2000s, worth about $100-150. Should shoot decently well of its maintained."
paintball,3e2y5r,truant19,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:47:12 2015 UTC,"I concur with the rest here. Id give that one about $150, due to the fact that it looks to be in good condition. If you get all of those parts with it, that would be a pretty good deal. You can sell some of those, as the classic Intimidator market is still pretty active."
paintball,3e2y5r,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:06:58 2015 UTC,Classic Timmy. Those sell for about 150.
paintball,3e2y5r,TheAmazingLeech,0,Tue Jul 21 15:46:22 2015 UTC,These were popular back when I played 10-12 years ago. My uneducated guess is it is probably worth 300-400 dollars.   Edit. Seems like I've been out of the game for too long. :) probably not worth that
paintball,3e2y5r,-Mateo-,3,Tue Jul 21 15:39:32 2015 UTC,It's a classic Timmy so more like 100 up to maybe 200.
paintball,3e2y5r,bleedsmarinara,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:44:14 2015 UTC,How do they shoot? Worth picking up for $100 for a backup/mess around gun?  Edit: seller states it is fully functional and comes with all the extra parts.
paintball,3e2y5r,socks86,2,Tue Jul 21 15:46:02 2015 UTC,Definitely worth. Plus a gen1 timmy will bring mad street cred.   With the WAS board it'll rip too. Wicked Air Sports. One of the first aftermarket boards that really got popular. The stock boards back then were very basic and only offered very basic adjustability. With the WAS board you get way more modes and you can really customize how the gun shoots and performs.

If they peek out they get shot... if they tuck in, i'm running by and they get shot.   It's to make up for my lack of reflexes since making it to the bunker i may not react fast enough so I pre shoot to make sure i'm ready to get anyone that may or may not be there."
paintball,3e10wl,tuckertml,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:11:07 2015 UTC,They have ears? lol they can hear your gun shooting and getting closer so they can pop over top/ or be pre pared for you and either shoot you before you have time to react or trade out.
paintball,3e10wl,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:39:12 2015 UTC,"there are many ways to approach things...   The way I do it works for me because I'm fat and slow.  I need to cover myself when I move.   Things get really hectic and some people react differently to stress and pressure.   Now I'm no CXBL Elite D1 player, but the way I play is good enough for CX4/RT5. I'm assuming not a lot of people are going to be ultra pro at speedball and it looks like smilfman is starting to learning too. So some advice after the clinic and even about the video might give him another approach if something like that were to come up.   ugh I'm soo rusty.. I should start playing speedball again."
paintball,3e10wl,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:51:59 2015 UTC,"I play mostly indoors, so when this clinic came around I jumped at the chance to do drills all day hosted by Ryan. definitely worth it despite the insane heat that day, I'm sure tuckertml will agree. I know I took a lot away from just that single day. I'd like to make it to a team at some point; I know I've got a good ways to go."
paintball,3e10wl,tuckertml,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:33:12 2015 UTC,it's all about experience and fundamentals.   I learned from a former MXL player and a former D2 player.

paintball,3e13k6,TrailsOfDoom,2,Tue Jul 21 16:02:04 2015 UTC,Tyger's videos taught me a lot. I first heard of him when he was on the Blast Radius Woodsball podcast. It's sad to see his eventual decline. He lashed out at some industry famous YouTubers and burned so many bridges. I think he just grew apart from the sport and is focusing on other activities. He was definitely a more likable figure than some of our current paintball celebrities.

You continue to do so, no matter how many times you've been told you are wrong and your videos are anecdotal evidence compared to what has actually been proven against you in 30 years of paintball.  You are stubborn. Cynical. Jaded, narrow minded. You think your a5 is god's gift to paintball. While it's a paintball gun that works, its far from the best, but the fact that you continue to tout it so, it's beyond annoying and constantly leading paintballers in the wrong direction with your videos.

The A-5 is a great starter marker. As I've always said. Any marker that shoots +/-3 fps is a great marker, that isn't ""wrong"" but true. I never said the A-5 was best... It is just a good starting marker as you can buy them for less than $50 typically used, and you don't need compressed air or a hopper...

As I've always said. Any marker that shoots +/-3 fps is a great marker, that isn't ""wrong"" but true.   to this day, your a5 is the only a5 i've ever heard of getting +3/-3 consistently.   Im sorry, but just because you're the one who has one video as ""evidence"" for that and the rest of it is you posting it here is stupid. I've chrono'd many markers in my times. From tippmanns to planet eclipse. The average at most was on HPA getting +/- 5. You know what the average tippmann on co2 like you use was? +/- 10 or more.  It's great managing fields.

Have you... tried it?...   Of course not, because then you would see it actually works! Lol! People like you make me laugh. I was at living legends and the guy running the chrono actually thought it was broken and had another ref bring over another because it was shooting the exact same shot after shot after shot... I ended up having to shoot over 20 paintballs as all the refs came over to see my a-5 being perfect over a virtue chrono on co2...  I chrono'd it Saturday and it was +/-1fps... with co2. So again, how is that ""wrong""?..."
paintball,3e13k6,TheAmazingLeech,3,Tue Jul 21 18:57:57 2015 UTC,I'll bring this in one posts now because you're being ridiculousthe biggest problem with your argument is that you are cleaning things again but not providing any real evidence of the videos. Also forgive my punctuation for I am on voice chat. if your ways are completely correct in the way that you say they were the industry would have def did to them because it would be more more cost effective for them to reduce the equipment that you use and it would to make for other equipment otherwise. Let me start with the post about Tiger delete. you let me get off my point about him I said you were the pot calling the kettle black yes he is cynical but the problem is is that you can't recognize the fact that you were cynical as well he was led down a bad path just simply through bad experiences you've had a bad past you simply cuz you're an idiot. I like that you're trying to bring new players and sports but as you continue to post you can't ever back up anything you're saying with anything but your own videos. these do not count as evidence in the science world you know why because you don't make any steps to replicate or prove them you don't provide any factual evidence other than one video angle and maybe five or six shots of you shooting a tree without measuring the distance this goes for both your crown Elaine video and your test range of your monster spin piece of s. f*** voice chat is censoring me and I really hate that. To continue yes I have tried your method of making your gun shoot shoot as well as it does as I said I manage multiple fields one being rebal feel the one being CPX indoor both having a full flee to 10 mins in rentals at disposal also owned an 85 or two and my time and never have they ever perform the ways you're sad and I'm damn good taking care of my markers and if I have any questions I go straight to the actual tax. Making posts on the internet about it just simply so I can get it right. Once again I am sorry for any mistakes that happen my grammar just simply because the voice chat you're making this claim that the rest are all about how your gun shot plus or minus one or they had a check you over and over again but where's the video for that one once again Wild claims see that's the stuff I would believe. But no you have to act all high and mighty against me that we're beyond the point of what the comment that I made was about I just don't appreciate you talking bad about someone when you're worse than they are Tigers stepped away from the sport and he did so with the best intentions he was hurt by a lot of things that happen and he had the right to he was my friend if you think he's your friend that's great too but here's the truth you didn't know him like I did. I wasn't his best friend but I saw him at his worst I saw him at good times to. I find it offensive that you would ever stand above him and say that he got jaded and cynical when you are at a worse point of view than he has ever been I don't appreciate it I don't like it and I'm officially done with you I've tried to be respectful to you in the past but I don't feel like coming through a year and a half of your s*** posts just to prove you wrong a lot of people hate you here.

paintball,3dzf7h,Catbrain,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:38:00 2015 UTC,"I use my bipods more as a way to hold my marker upright... In long games, or games where you are laying down, it is VERY handy having a bipod so you don't have to hold your marker upright the whole time. You can just let it rest on the arms. I have used my A-5's bipod to fire from in the past. But, typically you end up needing a big more height than a bipod will allow. Which is why I got this style as it has longer legs, Course as you mentioned, it has a huge mag underneath as well... So it sits about level with the mag inside... I do end up using it when playing as a sniper though as I will often be sitting in an area for a long period of time, and I can use it to hold the marker where I want it, without having to stress my arm muscles!   It just depends on your style of play. If you are playing fast games, you likely won't use it much, but it is handy after a game to pop it out and let it stand on the table instead of laying it on its side where it can get scratched up..."

paintball,3e0a30,LuisUsername,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:45:35 2015 UTC,"The main difference between them is the ergonomics, they are way better on the axe pro, other things are it has a different feed neck, it comes with an oled stock, also a diffrent way to take out the bolt and the eyes and it comes with a 2 piece barrel."
paintball,3e0a30,MeccaYdna,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:02:49 2015 UTC,Alright thanks. I also would like to know how the axe performs against a minigs?
paintball,3e0a30,LuisUsername,2,Tue Jul 21 00:12:30 2015 UTC,"Minis and Axes use many similar parts, but the biggest internal change with Axes is they operate at a lower pressure. It allows the marker to be more gentle with paint if you tune it properly. They're also theoretically quieter sounding because of the pressure difference (not sure if that matters). If possible it'd be ideal for you to hold each of them in your hands, since the Mini and Mini-GS ergonomics are different from an Axe. Some people prefer the new GS platform since it comes with a rubberized foregrip. But it's a preference issue so you never know how things will feel out on the field."

paintball,3e0vrv,CDtothehizzle,-2,Tue Jul 21 15:22:18 2015 UTC,"It looks like a 3000-psi steel bottle. They're pretty cheap to buy compared to the more expensive 4500 tanks (can buy a new 3k system from Ninja, Empire, Valken for about $60). Because of the cheap price, 3k HPA tanks generally aren't worth anything to the value of the marker package. At least that's usually the case. Some fields even rent 3k HPA setups for free since they're so cheap. (of course that might not apply to you)  If you were to turn around and sell the HPA tank by itself, it would go for about $10-15, so it has very little value compared to the rest of the marker you're trying to buy. Because of that I'd suggest forgetting about the tank as a whole unless you're reallllllly trying to save money.  EDIT - after looking at it further, it's probably not a steel bottle but rather a fiber-wrapped bottle with some kind of covering on the outside. For that stuff there's no way to tell without visually inspecting it (which is done during the hydrotesting process)"

paintball,3e0m5e,Claclink,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:23:19 2015 UTC,"CO2 in any marker other than mechanicals and blowbacks without the proper filtering additions, which are pretty difficult to find nowadays, will ruin your solenoid and possibly ruin the rest of the electronics in the markers as well.  Since CO2 is transitioning from a liquid state to a gas, it cools as it expands. This isn't a big deal if you aren't shooting much, but becomes very noticeable when shooting rapidly or a lot. When this happens, the pressure fluctuates from high to low, and your marker's performance and accuracy will begin to suffer. As the tank chills it begins drawing liquid CO2 up into the marker, resulting in pressure spikes that can push velocities to unsafe speeds. If you see big white clouds of vapor coming out the muzzle and white snow falling out the barrel (it's actually dry ice) when shooting you can bet that liquid CO2 worked its way into the marker. And in cold weather, the pressure can get so low with CO2 that many paintball markers won't cycle properly. CO2 tanks also can't be partially filled- you have to empty them out all the way to fill them back up, so no topping off between matches.  Liquid CO2 is also hard on the seals of your marker and can cause damage if it works it way into the solenoids of many electropneumatic markers. Thus many markers cannot use CO2."

paintball,3e0m5e,phantomjm,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"I guess the real question is why you would need to. If you plan on playing somewhere where HPA fills are unavailable (outlaw fields for example), your options would be to either bring your own SCUBA tank to fill your HPA tank or to pick up a gun that runs well on CO2. If you go with the latter option, you're looking at mechanical guns like Classic Automags (not RT or X-Valve), Autocockers, STBB guns like Spyders & Piranhas, pumps, or pistols (to name a few)."

You can try taking apart the regulator and giving it an inspection and cleaning. Check for scratches or other damage on the reg seat. Give it a clean and lube it with silicone based lube (no petroleum based lube).
paintball,3e0edv,PiratePantsFace,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:28:06 2015 UTC,"Know of any good guides on disassembling a reg? Air leaks out of the 1.8 even with a new one installed, how can cleaning it solve that?"
paintball,3e0edv,meltedmineless,2,Tue Jul 21 00:35:49 2015 UTC,http://www.me-paintball.de/media/pdf/Ninja%20Regulator%20Owners%20Manual.pdf  Pretty simple. Make sure it's degassed. Undo the 3 screws on the bonnet. Unscrew the bonnet. Piston and the other stuff pops out. The reg seat is the little plastic ball on the bottom of the piston.
paintball,3e0edv,meltedmineless,2,Tue Jul 21 00:42:51 2015 UTC,"FOR THE LOVE OF GOD USE THE RIGHT LUBE.  That's the most important thing.  If you use the wrong lube, the tank can easily blow up."
paintball,3dydly,venounan,5,Mon Jul 20 15:23:15 2015 UTC,"First off Everyone will agree to buy a mask. Having a good mask is much more important than having a good marker. I recommend eflexes or proflexes.  As for beginner guns, tippmans are ok but a lot of guys on here will recommend the GoG enmey as it is a very good gun for the price. Very low maintenance and doesnt really need any upgrades for a beginner gun."
paintball,3dydly,tsrui480,2,Mon Jul 20 15:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yes this is definitely something I am planning on doing. I borrowed a friend's mask with the gun I used this weekend, and it was MILES better than any of the ones they were renting."
paintball,3dydly,tsrui480,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see people show up at the field all the time with a nice high end gun but they didnt buy a mask. Then they cant hit anything because they cant see. I wear virtue vios because they fit well (and look good) with my glasses. But they are on the pricey side of things."
paintball,3dydly,Christofolo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:32:44 2015 UTC,"Lent a kid my backup mask so he didn't have to use a rental, safe to say he felt so much  more confident since he could actually see what he could do lol. For a beginner gun you could rock a enmey which is smooth and quiet or get an azodin Kaos for a bit less (got mine for $90) and use the other 30 bucks for a nice barrel. Either will serve you well."
paintball,3dydly,tsrui480,-3,Mon Jul 20 16:50:19 2015 UTC,And if you are looking for a more mid range marker I recommend the Valken Proton. It is a macroless design and is very competitive for its price.
paintball,3dydly,mazu747,3,Mon Jul 20 15:29:51 2015 UTC,Those are total shit. Mini's and Etha's are far better. Valken really needs to stick with soft gear.  Ninja edit
paintball,3dydly,CDtothehizzle,5,Mon Jul 20 15:50:17 2015 UTC,total shit.. absoultely... ohh boards that don't remember settings when you turn it off? awesome.   Board wont turn on. Awesome  hard to programe. Awesome  Zero support at all if your shit breaks... awesome...   The mechanical part of the gun is okay. The board just plain sucks donkey balls.   Mokal is based in Brampton Ontario. Hell I'm fucking a few blocks from them at work... They wont take their shit back even if you show up. The first gen mokal auras were shit. Valken Protons are basically rebranded auras. It's just not a really good gun.   Better guns out there for a better price.

paintball,3dydly,emdee202,2,Mon Jul 20 16:31:59 2015 UTC,"In my opinion the A-5 that you liked would be great.  It's cheap, you can beat it to hell (gun maintenance is something new players often value too little), and it will work 100% of the time you step onto the field (granted I have little experience with modded A-5s beyond response triggers, drops, and barrel kits).  Also with the A-5 the resale value is decent, or if you love it and find yourself as more of a regular rec player, you can mod it to be ""cool"" or more effective per your play style.  If you get into more speedball you can keep it as a back up/ loaner gun, or sell it pretty easy for a better gun.  But as a new player mask > good carbon fiber tank > gun.  That's just my opinion obviously."
paintball,3dydly,jesus321,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:20:38 2015 UTC,Get an azodin blitz 3. Same cost as the enmey suggested but better quality (all metal) and actually has a double trigger. You can also get the evo for about $40 more. My brother has one and it's definitely the best marker I've seen for the price.
paintball,3dydly,thelao,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:46:10 2015 UTC,"Mini and axe are great but everyone and their mom has one. It'd be nice if other comparable markers were listed and discussed. At this point, I could just walk up to someone and ask to try out their mini or axe instead of just being another mini/axe on the field. Probably what's stopping me from getting one. Let's get some other nominees in for beginners. Ease of use and maintenance with great performance."

paintball,3dygjs,cptzanzibar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:22:43 2015 UTC,It comes with the vcom engine
paintball,3dygjs,victoryfap,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:30:39 2015 UTC,"I love how smooth the vcom is, I would say it is up there with the best of the spoolies.  The other nice thing about the vcom is if you want to get more efficiency you can pick up a vis engine and you have a poppet gun with all of the perks of a poppet. I think it is a genius platform"
paintball,3dygjs,tsrui480,2,Mon Jul 20 17:33:43 2015 UTC,"With the VIS, the Vcom engine is almost moot. The VIS is almost just as smooth and leagues more efficient. I really love it."
paintball,3dygjs,tsrui480,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:12:37 2015 UTC,I agree the VIS engine is bob long's best in my opinion.  It is smooth more efficient and the maintenance on it is a breeze.
paintball,3dygjs,villa9122,2,Mon Jul 20 18:51:07 2015 UTC,Personally I would choose the Shocker but they all have their perks.  Vcom is among the smoothest shooting spoolies with the vcom engine and is very versatile with the VIS engine.  But comes at a price of a little more maintenance. LV1 is going to need the least amount of maintenance and will shoot very smooth for a poppet.  The shocker is my favorite as it is extremely lightweight and I love the ergonomics of it.

paintball,3dygjs,villa9122,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:42:27 2015 UTC,"Its not too bad but definitely more than a Lv1. Basically you just need to take out the bolt, wipe it off and relube it once a weekend before you play. You could probably go longer without relubing but it only takes maybe 2 minutes since the bolt comes out with the push of a button"

It was mixed between the paint at the range (brand name Bonus Paint), and some paint one of their group members had bought but added to the box.   Paint around here runs for an average of $40 per case of 2000 at a storefront, upwards to $70, and the lowest at $20 (a local brand).  So saving on about $40 of ammunition pays for about 2 full field days in savings."

paintball,3dyo67,DeMiNe0,6,Mon Jul 20 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"I would advise you to not get any marker where you can mount scopes/rails to. Sure they look cool if you're into the whole scenario scene but they are almost purely cosmetic and offer no increase in performance. That being said, the single most important piece of gear to make sure you have a great time paintballing is your mask. The difference between a high end mask and a low end mask is ridiculous. Once she gets a nice mask  such as a Dye i4, Virtue Vio, Proflex etc... then I would recommend the general consensus for a starter set up: Gog Enmey ~150 Ninja 48/3000 ~50 Proto Primo ~15 Off brand pod pack ~10  Those pieces of gear paired with a good mask is a great recball set up.

You don't need a scope unless you're shooting first strikes and remote setups are fucking terrible. The enmey has decent mechanical antichop functionality so you can just run a gravity hopper on it with a lightweight tank and she should be good to go.
paintball,3dyo67,socks86,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:48:32 2015 UTC,^    Gog Enmey is the best beginners gun hands down. I do not advocate giving electros to beginners mainly because they do not know proper trigger control and that can cause issues.

Don't feel like you have to do much more than maybe get a .685 barrel if you want, that seems to be small enough almost all of the time. The step beyond that would be a kit of at least three sizes, usually a .685 and then something smaller, like .681 or .682, and then a bigger one, like .689."

Lurker eigenbarrel.  Quite, new, interchangeable backs, 8 inch control bore, 2 piece? Stella."
paintball,3dvxpl,socks86,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:43:54 2015 UTC,"The freak system is outdated and inferior to many that are available. They still work fine but something like the Stella system by inception designs or (best bang for the buck) the lurker Eigenbarrel are better. They have a longer control bore (8-9"") which means better efficiency and probably accuracy. These use interchangeable backs instead of inserts. The stella can be put together as a 3 piece barrel, so you can change backs fronts and tips. The tips may or may not help a bit with sound signature.  I know the lurker barrels come in impulse threads (same as ion/enmey threads). 3 backs and a front should cost less than $80 which is a damn good deal for a barrel of that quality IMO"

Empire paint tends to float around the .685 - .690 range,  Valken is anywhere from .680 -.690 depending on brand, and GI paint tends to run small in the .680-.685 range.  A upgraded barrel can easily overcome this but you just have to size your paint. Remember paint fluctuates in size based on temperature outside."

The school is not going to give you any money and frankly, nobody else will be unless you're winning national events.  Solution: create the team completely independent of the school.

paintball,3dwn2x,thelao,2,Mon Jul 20 11:58:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe instead of a ""team"" start a club that gets together weekly and talks about the sport, new gear, new fields etc. Then invite anyone from the high school to stop by if they are ever interested in playing or learning the sport. Use this club to organize weekend games and trips to new fields. Basically use it as a forum to plan and coordinate local (and maybe non-local) trips to fields and tourney and introduce people to the game.  All the school needs to do is provide a room and maybe some AV equipment. You can then watch paintball videos together and maybe live stream tournaments etc etc."

paintball,3dwqag,kavar13,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:54:28 2015 UTC,Ramping will increase your finger bps to the capped bps so it'll shoot a consistent stream of paint. True semi is like semi but it isn't buffered so if you finger it faster than it wants to shoot some of your inputs wont register. Semi is fine enough though so you shouldn't have to worry about it.

You can set the board back to stock and then adjust the firing mode to be ramp at whatever BPS you want.  Tippmanns are woodsball guns.  The enemy is okay but not a good speedball gun.  If you know you're only going to play speedball and maybe tournaments at some point, invest in a better gun and not waste money on something you're not going to keep using."

paintball,3dvlvp,cashrules36,2,Sun Jul 19 22:11:52 2015 UTC,"Your reg is at some fucky pressure. Sweet spot it or get a reg tester and set it to around 325. Then do all your adjustment from the IVG, don't mess with anything else."
paintball,3dvlvp,Rspctd,2,Sun Jul 19 22:53:57 2015 UTC,"To expand on this: general poppet valves have a spot when turning up the reg that will actually cause the fps to drop when you increase the pressure. This is because the pressure behind the valve will put pressure on the seal and require more force to open the valve. Start off with increasing the pressure until it starts to drop, if you can't get the velocity you want you'll have to increase the lpr/spring tension for the rammer and try again."
paintball,3dvlvp,kavar13,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:57:31 2015 UTC,"Yep.   Basically the SOP for sweet spotting a T2 would be to back the IVG to flush, then 2 turns in. Zero out the reg to where no air is travelling through whatsoever. Continue to increase the reg pressure until you get to the point where the FPS starts to decrease. IE. 269 278 280 269. The pressure in which the marker fires at 280 fps would be the sweet spot. Then adjust the IVG in the back to your desired FPS. Never touch the reg ever again.  This is a very good video to follow."

paintball,3dua8p,crazyike,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:33:04 2015 UTC,"Well you were on track until then. Paintball was tanking long before the economy did. The economic collapse was not the reason paintball tanked. Paintball was tanking in 2005, but it took a while for it to become obvious in every facet.

paintball,3dua8p,mankstar,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:27:56 2015 UTC,"I've seen that article before and I have some reservations about it. I know several paintball industry heads and they most claimed they were doing great in 06/07/08, during what seemed to be the height of external investment in paintball. They were struggling to get enough skids of paint manufactured to keep up with the demand and their markers were flying off the shelves.   While the writing may have been on the wall, the industry overall was pretty healthy 05-08. You just don't give $40,000 prizes and cars if the industry is bleeding; you give $5,000 prizes like there are now.   Perhaps I'm just spoiled, but from where I was in 2007/2008, no one was paying $100 for a case of paint. It was closer to roughly $40/50 for really solid paint like All Star (back when it was good). You'd also be able to buy the old DXS white box that had bronze/silver/gold mixed in for $30 a case."

paintball,3dua8p,SkinnyBins,9,Mon Jul 20 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"I've experienced a similar phenomenon. I know that the woodsball crowd has suffered a bit because of the popularity of airsoft around here.  Airsoft tends to cater to the guys who are looking for a more ""realistic"" (I use that term very loosely,) experience. When a player is looking for something that looks like real guns and has guys wearing all the gear, airsoft is immediately more attractive. Add to that the lower cost of BBs and the lower pain factor and it's a very attractive alternative to paintball.  I know that one of my local fields hosts both airsoft and paintball players during the same hours, and the airsoft crowds have been getting bigger while the paintball crowds have been getting smaller. I'm personally not a fan of the effort to create ""realism,"" and airsoft represents everything I hate about what woodsball (and the markers aimed toward that market) has become over the last ~10 years, (but that's a rant for a different post.)"

It's a totally different crowd, I've seen more wiping in recball than cheating in airsoft, and the folks tend to be the same type. It's a totally different format and feel. Most of the airsofters around me are just there to have fun, and it's just waiting on a medic or a walk back to the respawn point before you're right back at it, no real reason to cheat.

When and where tanks can be is heavily controlled and each side gets a chance to have tanks.

paintball,3dutcw,cdeco22,2,Sun Jul 19 18:32:34 2015 UTC,Id also pass on CO2 most fields only fill up for compressed air now and id never use CO2 on a high end marker. When you can get yourself a good compressed air tank perferably carbon fiber. That spyder is ok at best but its pretty outdated. The empire mini is a great marker and is just a couple hundred. If you need something for less similar  markers usually go for around $150 second hand. Ive gotten a mini for around that much.   All of this does depend on how and where you play though.
paintball,3duqvu,Ryanzab,3,Sun Jul 19 17:49:27 2015 UTC,I never bought one. You can easily make one. Take a coupler and screw a gauge into one end and a macro fitting into the other. Then just cut a length of macroline and pop it into the fitting.   Take the ram out of the vice and insert the macro and push it in till it stops. Boom you have a pressure tester.

The other team is out there completing objectives, we're getting our asses kicked, and you wanna just sit here jerking your friends off at the edge of the field? Really?

They crawled closer and closer, and I was facing the other direction so I had pivoted to watch them advance, but my gun was facing the other way...  I laid completely still as they got closer and closer... I realized I was going to have to shoot them as they were going to step on me in a matter of seconds...   Just as I was about to pivot and fire. The front guy raises up his mask and wipes his face off, while looking directly at me...  If I had reacted when he moved, I would have shot him in the face...  KEEP YOUR MASK ON!!! ALL THE TIME!!!  I waited for him to put his mask back down, and swung and pulled the trigger. Hitting both front players as the third ducked behind the other two.

paintball,3dt3qe,A7X4REVer,12,Sun Jul 19 05:41:53 2015 UTC,The fastest way to let everyone know you're out is to get up with marker or hand raised and start moving towards the dead box. Hunkering down and waiting for the shooting to stop is what will get you shot more.
paintball,3dt3qe,Boines,3,Sun Jul 19 11:08:01 2015 UTC,This is why I always hold my marker with the top rail and lift my marker as far out of cover before getting up and jogging off the field. Let's them know you're out and about to walk off.
paintball,3dt3qe,mazu747,2,Sun Jul 19 14:35:40 2015 UTC,"There is every excuse to keep shooting if you have not gotten out of your bunker. When youre hit there is 3 steps to take.  Tell ""im out"" as loud as you can. Wave your hand or gun out whatever side of the bunker you got shot or am getting shot from.  run out, i tend to block my neck on my way out.  If you are still hiding  behind the bunker everyone is fair to assume that you are still in and are fair game.   Unless you are a 10 year old renter terrified of getting hit, then staying in the bunker and getting shot more is your own fault."

Honestly I am surprised you expect someone to stop shooting to show you are out, staying in the bunker after being hit and not wanting to put a hand or gun out for fear of being hit is quite the new player thing. Personally I get my hand or gun out there as fast as possible and normally that relays the message enough for me not to get bonus balled."
paintball,3dt3qe,Helzvog,-3,Sun Jul 19 17:10:21 2015 UTC,Its really bad in woodsball where they usually cant really see what they are firing at so they hose it down at 15 bps and when someone gets upset they say they didnt hear anything. Of course you didnt hear anything over the sound of your gun ramping!   Its part of what is holding paintball back.
paintball,3dt3qe,crazyike,3,Sun Jul 19 14:05:23 2015 UTC,I have been out of the sport for around 4 years now but has it really gotten this bad? I was a head ref at a field when I was actively participating in the sport and at my field we had ramping rules. You were only allowed to fire strings of around 5 at a player before pausing to make sure they could get out if hit then another 5 and so forth. It was also at our descresion to throw people out of the park for bonus balling. Which we did to some young military hot heads all the time. Sunday was the only day that was open season. Sunday psp rules were in effect for tournament players to practice now shooting rules other than gun must use psp ramp.
paintball,3dt3qe,Boines,-3,Sun Jul 19 14:10:25 2015 UTC,Lets just say those rules arent enforced in very many places. Wish they did.  History will not be kind to the way electronics were implemented in early paintball.
paintball,3dt3qe,crazyike,2,Sun Jul 19 14:19:20 2015 UTC,"We are way past early electronics in paintball.   Ramping is a serious control over the super bouncy semi triggers.

paintball,3dt3qe,crazyike,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:37:17 2015 UTC,"""Been around enough"" not been around long enough. Theres a very large difference   I have done everything aside from owning fields and running tournament series. Ive been on both the sides of ref and player, and can guarentee that the issue was never and will never be the electronics.  It is not hard to create a mechanical gun that will shoot just as fast. Im sure youve seen what rt mags can do.   The only issues is player attitude/self control, player awareness, and lazy referees.   Blaming it on electronics is idiotic. Electronics has been the best way to level the playing field at a stable firing rate.   Ramping means it doesnt matter what settings you messed with to make your gun bounce like crazy, and if youre using any different settings it will be VERY clear to everyone involved. Its quite easy to pick up when one gun is shooting faster then the rest."
paintball,3dt3qe,Boines,0,Sun Jul 19 15:43:39 2015 UTC,"It is just as easy to pick up when a mechanical gun is firing faster than the rest too. I own a mag set to bounce for fun. It doesnt mean I think it should be allowed on the field like that. You're trying to deflect away but the pure fact is electronics were introduced to make high rates of fire possible and controllable.  You are welcome to believe anything you like. Reality is, however, that high rates of fire nearly destroyed the recball market. It is responsible for the total collapse of the industry . It is responsible for the rise of the .50 rental game which will poison everything else as fields ditch unprofitable speedball and focus on corporate parties and stags etc.  You say its the fields' fault for not making a controlled environment or the players for not exercising self control. History has clearly shown that the players never will so the fields are just moving away from guys like that to the grossly inferior but much more profitable low impact games. This would never have happened had the industry not moved to faster is better in the early 2000s.   Now they pay the price. And they still have it too high. High impact paintball is a dead game. The heart is still beating because it hasnt finished bleeding out yet, but its just a matter of time. That sort of paintball is STILL declining even as low impact is growing. More and more field owners are realizing this and if the industry is smart it will knock back the rate of fire limits even more before they lose it all."

I have never met a tournament player, or someone who has been around for a few years without self control. The only bonus balling ive seen is either completely intentional (and i know i be done it) when the other team is cheating for example, or from new players that simply do not have the ability to think and stay alive at the same time. They just shoot anything  that moves... like.me standing looking the other way holding a camera.  Regardless of the players attitude it is the referees JOB to control the field.  I have kicked entire teams out of fields. I have kicked individual players off of fields for as much as aaying ""fuck"" towards me. If a ref cannot maintain control of the players on the field he should not be on the field.  Your completely ignoring the fields responsibility in your reply and only  focusing on newer player's lack of control?   Now they pay the price. And they still have it too high.

What was i thinking?   Also, why are you talking about .50 call like it is drastically different? The biggest difference i can see for gun owners and regular players is needing to get closer to people, and allowing for more sustained  high rates of fire with the extra amount of paint youll be able to carry. Is the amount of pain or impact a shot carries with it that essential to the game of paintball? Im pretty sure its not called painball.

paintball,3dt3qe,cptzanzibar,-1,Sun Jul 19 16:12:13 2015 UTC,"No im not. My point is high rates of fire are not difficult to engineer mechanically  Electronically is the easiest way to control these rates of fire and keep them consistent.    Typical spin. Electronics can control rate of fire down, but almost universally they are used to control rate of fire up. Everything about an electronic gun is easier to fire. Not just ramping, though of course that is the most obvious. I doubt there is a single person at my field who can shoot a mechanical cocker without short stroking at double digit bps, and only a handful who could set up a mag to bounce. The number who can hit 15 bps ramping? Virtually everyone. And even if they could manage the mechanical side, its just as easy to outlaw as any other.

Total collapse of the industry is extremely far from reality. Locally .50 cal has not taken off at all.

Comments like this is why im saying you havent been around enough paintball because you CLEARLY dont understand business aspects.   Funny, I think the same thing about you. Odd how every field owner who has given .50 cal a try for its renters has noticed a big improvement in their feedback and that side of their business, to the point that some are just phasing .68 out completely. But I guess you, random internet person, knows more about their business than they do, right? After all, you say you do, so you must!  As for the rest, if you haven't met players with high rate of fire who don't bother to control it, then I think its pretty obvious which of us here hasn't been around enough paintball to know what's really going on out there. You apparently play in a bubble.  Its sad. Young guys like you have NO IDEA how many people have quit or refuse to play now because of the way the game changed as speedball got pushed. You accuse me of not being around enough paintball? You have no idea. None. The game used to be so much bigger. Total collapse of the industry is far from reality? I have seen industry insiders, people whose LIVELIHOOD depends on it, put the decline at over 90%. If you think its anything but a disaster right now, well.... you haven't been around enough paintball. Your bubble isn't the reality out there.  As for the rest, yes its a factor too. It's not just one thing. Focusing on the wrong demographic wasn't a good idea either. It's worth noting, however, that the other demographics weren't nearly as interested in speedball as the young testosterone filled kids just out of high school, and they never came back after the focus shifted to high speed high impact paintball.   I have never met a tournament player, or someone who has been around for a few years without self control. The only bonus balling ive seen is either completely intentional    The only response to this is, you haven't been around enough paintball if you think this is even remotely true. Get out of your bubble, find out what it is really like in the big games, the low ref recball, and almost all woodsball where speedball guns and rates of fire are allowed. Your field doesn't do it? Congrats! Wish I played there, because it is apparently the 0.1%! Out here in the real world, there isn't enough refs to control it, and there isn't enough motivation to make them control it even if they could, since more paint flying is more immediate money for the owners.   Because .50 cal limits the rate of fire more? I mean its not like the guns shoot the same speed and you can carry even more paint easily right? Fuck you know what youre totally right! What was i thinking?    You aren't. The rental .50 cal guns aren't set up to huge rates of fire. They probably could be but that isn't the point. .50 cal is a dead end game. It would never work for what any regular would call ""good"" paintball unless they upped the velocity max (not legal here) which would immediately defeat the point of using it in the first place. If you want paintball to succeed in a form that we would want to play, as regulars, .50 caliber is the enemy. But .50 caliber is gaining strength among field owners because for the casual market it is MUCH better and, when put head to head, much more popular. You don't really get it, the casual market doesn't WANT high rates of fire, so it's not set up to do so. It takes time, but you'll find out soon enough the realities of it when fields near you realize they can make more money and bring in more people with it than the .68 game does. It has already happened here. Theres a post here from not a few days ago talking about how there weren't any people out for the .68 game so they went and played .50 with the renters. It's coming.   Also, why are you talking about .50 call like it is drastically different? The biggest difference i can see for gun owners and regular players is needing to get closer to people, and allowing for more sustained high rates of fire with the extra amount of paint youll be able to carry. Is the amount of pain or impact a shot carries with it that essential to the game of paintball? Im pretty sure its not called painball.   Yeah, you don't really understand it at all. They don't try to push .50 as the same game. The guns are kept low rates of fire on purpose (most are converted low ends anyways) because that's what the casual market wants. You're so hung up in your bubble you don't even see this yet.   Make sure you understand things from field's perspectives before you start trying to talk from that perspectice.   Mind fucking off with your self important judgements of what I understand? Your opinion is not the same as a fact. I understand just fine. My understanding follows quite well with what is actually happening out there. So go fuck yourself with your arrogant ""only I understand!"" attitude."

I wouldn't call it an issue but I'm getting to the point that I really don't like playing with the space dildo crowd. There's normally a few mixed into the walk-on/renter groups and sometimes it's fine. Most of the time though they just scare the rookies, overshoot constantly, take away the ability to maneuver up close, and it seems like they're the only ones that get pissy about eliminations. Some would still be good players without batteries but I think most would get their asses handed to them if they couldn't shoot ropes.  I'm not normally a ludite but I think I'm heading that way for paintball. OP's on to something here, save the electros for speedball."

I chrony my sniper with the  handle held forward, and let go of the handle if im trying to lob a shot and have it drop in on someone. I lose 10-20fps when i leave the handle so it is very useful, say when im trying to shoot down on someone sitting in snake.

They are easy to rent as most welding supply store have it. Co2 is a hassle to deal with. You have to disconnect the bottle for every fill. Tank Orings usually were ruined in the process. The was no way to tell how much gas you had left. The tank would have to be completely emptied then refilled. If the tank wasn't cold you couldn't fill it all the way.

You know the oring on your co2 tank that you had to change every week or so?  On HPA it will last for months.  On high end guns, CO2 will literally destroy the gun's solenoid.  Can't use CO2 on high end guns.   A ton of fields have gone to HPA for their rentals, because it saves a lot of maintenance work."

(For anyone ready to argue about this, a lot of high end guns have ditched the LP air fad.)  It sounds like you are going to buy an HPA tank.  I HIGHLY recommend a ninja tank.  A used tank will run you around 100, while a brand new, absolutely top of the line tank will run you 220.  DO NOT BUY A STEEL TANK.  Those things are heavy as fuck and carry a piss poor amount of air.  For the love of god, no matter what tank you get, get a carbon fiber one.  I also recommend a 68/45 (Not a 68/30).  That seems to be the best all-around size."

paintball,3drq6k,socks86,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:11:30 2015 UTC,"Aluminum is fine if you're on a budget.  I'd recommend the gorilla 68/3000 if you're on a budget, most aluminum tanks are rather awkward to shoulder, the peanut style works wonderfully!  Or an old carbon fiber tank would work quite well, that's the way I went. $35 for a 7 year old (rehydro'd of course) tank and I have no regrets (besides it being a little too long for my arms, but it's no biggie)"

paintball,3druri,recycle_detroit,2,Sat Jul 18 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"Could just be a product of the gun or the trigger.  It is possible that an aftermarket trigger will take care of some of your complaints.  It is also possible that the trigger frame is incapable of having any real improvements to it.  Check out pbnation.com and ask them there.  I will tell you, that the quest for a slop free trigger is an almost endless quest, and each gun feels different.  The trigger on my ego is drastically different from my timmy."
paintball,3druri,PiratePantsFace,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:01:22 2015 UTC,"That's what it's kind of sounding like. I haven't found an aftermarket trigger for it yet (so if someone knows of one, please speak up), but might give pbnation a try.   Good point on the differences in trigger. After ALOT of messing with it, I think I've got about the best feel to it I can get out of it, so I'll give it a try here and see."
paintball,3druri,DakkaDakka24,2,Tue Jul 21 02:54:11 2015 UTC,"I had the same problem. The pull was too soft and the return was weak, no matter how I adjusted it. And even if I got it to a point where it was pretty alright, after one game the screws would somehow jiggle themselves back to how it was before adjustment. The Impulse just doesn't have a particularly good trigger. It's the marker's only real problem, and there aren't any aftermarket options available."
paintball,3druri,Aidspanda,2,Sun Jul 19 19:29:57 2015 UTC,"A drop of blue loctite will do wonders to keeping those screws in. Although I can't say I've ever heard of trigger screws backing out. (Usually it's reg creep or some,thing like that.)  I'm not sure what the trigger assembly looks like on the JT but possibly a spring from a pen could help with the tension issues?"
paintball,3druri,DakkaDakka24,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:23:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I hadn't either until that. Traded it away a few months back anyway."
paintball,3druri,MeccaYdna,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks, these are some good ideas. I have had the side screws on the trigger creep (resulting in it sticking during play), so some loctite would be a great idea.  It's been a while since I took the assembly apart, but I'll have to see what springs are inside. Also a great idea- if it looks possible, I'll try swapping the spring as well."
paintball,3druri,MeccaYdna,2,Tue Jul 21 02:57:47 2015 UTC,"This is a semi-common issue with other markers that use a ""suspended"" set screw system to hold the trigger in place (Luxe, EOS). I'm referring to the trigger's pivot screws, there's one on each side of the frame, and they pinch the trigger inside of a small bearing.  Over time the screws can become loose and this will cause the trigger to have some side-to-side ""wobble"". Usually you can fix it by tightening the screw(s) to make things more stable. But you have to be careful because it's possible to tighten one of the screws too far which will push the trigger against the inside of the frame and bind it up. It's actually easiest to do this when you can look at the trigger from the top, but that requires removing the frame from the marker which is a LOT more work.  Anyway, you may wish to consult the manual if you haven't done so already, since it has some info on this. The thing it doesn't say is that this can happen a lot (lol)  edit - I should mention this isn't guaranteed to be your problem, since it's also possible for the trigger bearing to simply wear out over time. But you might get lucky..."
paintball,3druri,iineviitable,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:04:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think the bearing is warn out, as it's only a couple of months old (but who knows how long it sat on the shelf). Have been reading the manual quite a bit on this too. I've got the side screws as even as possible, and turned in until it stops moving (then each backed slightly out).   I've got it tuned as best as I think is possible for the current trigger. I'll give it a try here soon and see how it goes. Of note, I also found that with the current way I've got it set, it's side to side wobble is still close to other triggers that I prefer (so perhaps I'm worrying about nothing there)."
paintball,3druri,iineviitable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:01:33 2015 UTC,"ah, that could be the case. One thing you can try is to loctite the trigger pivot set screws into their positions, but you have to be VERYYYYYY careful with the loctite because it can seize the bearing.  FWIW, I've heard pros and coaches and other such people often mention that a tiny bit of trigger slop can actually assist with semiauto firing speed since it lets the trigger adhere with your fingers easier. It seems really counterintuitive since not many people consciously ""prefer"" a wobbly trigger (myself included) but it's still one of those things that always gets brought up every once in a while. Of course it's still just a preference issue above anything else, you might not really care about the mechanical semiauto speeds..."

paintball,3dquzs,TheAmazingLeech,2,Mon Jul 20 03:45:32 2015 UTC,"Regs are ok to mess around with, they're really no worse than any other part of the gun with o-rings. Also, because the FX only has the one regulator you don't need to worry about a pressure gauge like you do on dual reg'd guns. Just clean/lube the o-rings, and turn the adjuster all the way down so that when you air it up for the first time after maintaining it it'll be outputting the lowest possible pressure and you can turn it up from there.  If you haven't yet, take at look at DP's manual for the FX. They do a very good job of showing how to disassemble and maintain the regulator."

paintball,3dpirw,stressedoutatumc,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:59:14 2015 UTC,Just about 2 weeks ago i got my first marker and i got the proto rail maxxed. I find the rail maxxed a very nice marker for its price range and i love it. Some nice things about the rail maxxed in my opinion is that it is very quiet and it shoots pretty smooth. 1 thing i dont love about it though is that you run out of air very quickly( this could be because i run a little 62/3000 tank) the other thing is that the rail maxxed is a spool and the ego 11 is a poppet. Personally i like the rail maxxed but i have never shot an ego 11 but i have shot an etek 5 and love it so you could go for an etek 4 or 5. So if iwere you i would either go for an etek or the rail.

paintball,3dpw8n,GooeyPod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:55:15 2015 UTC,"It'd be a bit of a challenge, you'd have to modify the externals a bit I'd think. Depending on the size of that stock, if it's more or less equal to the hammer 7's lower receiver you might design it with a gap to fit the original receiver? The grip looks roughly similar to the original Hammer 7's so you could easily cut it off and allow the original grip to fit through... It'll be a challenge to get that to fit without modding externals. You'll also have to cut a slot for the mag it looks like.  Additionally since you mentioned bolt action, that will be a bit of a challenge to do and you might need to custom-build a bolt system as nelson markers don't like to be pulled by only one side of the bolt from what I've heard."

paintball,3dp5w1,truant19,2,Sat Jul 18 02:53:18 2015 UTC,"No, ignore north7.  The ram is supposed to flop around.  It shows that it is lubed.  The ram and bolt assembly should flop around when connected.    The pin should be held in by something more than gravity.  You are either missing some sort of spring loaded bearing that would be near the tip, or you have a delrin pin that had a nub at the tip that has worn down.  OR you have some sort of specialty bolt that has a spring loaded ball bearing that needs to be tightened.  The only hope of fixing the problem is if the problem is witht he bolt.  Look at the channel where the pin goes through the bolt.  Look all around it.  There should be some sort of detent that keeps the pin in place. Could even be a set screw in the bolt, not a bearing"
paintball,3dp5w1,PiratePantsFace,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:32:06 2015 UTC,"That's odd behavior for the ram - it shouldn't flop around. Were the ram o-rings intact? Also the bolt pin should be held in the bolt by a ball bearing on the end of a spring inside the bolt. You'll notice a little dent in the bolt pin that the ball bearing should sit in when the pin is in the bolt. If you look into the hole on the bolt that the pin goes into you should see the end of the ball bearing - no ball bearing, no good."

Typically its capped at 10.5 or 15 bps I think and full auto is still not allowed in most places.   As For CO2, it's mostly phased out. The drop in temperature damages most markers when fired rapidly (remember what I said about ramping, it's everywhere) and most fields dont refill it."

paintball,3dos7n,IdiomIdyll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:45:46 2015 UTC,"Old guns are cheap. You can get insane performance, whatever your nostalgic heart desires, for a very low price these days.  Ramping and full auto modes are discouraged/frowned upon for most rec play in my area, unless its on the airball field. I mostly stick to mechanical and pump markers myself, unless its a tournament.  Paint quality seems to be in the shitter these days. New players just have no idea. Do not expect your favorite paint from when you last played to be of the same quality now. There is hope. A new manufacturer is supposed to be coming to the east coast. Everything else seems to be getting outsourced to taiwan or something.  Oh and paint has been shrinking in size as well. Doesn't seem to fly as far or as straight as it used to. I use bores .685 and smaller, occasionally down to .675...just something to keep in mind if you are buying barrels."
paintball,3dos7n,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:21:13 2015 UTC,"Ok, so rather than grabbing a one piece I should get one of the insert kits with different bore sizes?  The one I've got is a .685, I have a feeling the paint will roll right out if it's gotten smaller."
paintball,3dos7n,socks86,0,Sat Jul 18 12:26:25 2015 UTC,"Are you using an autococker?  You are thinking of the smart parts freak system and other similar kits from that era. The smart parts one is now an Empire product (smart parts went under, and has reemerged as GoG Paintball).  These still work fine but are inferior at this point in my opinion. The bore inserts are only 5 inches or so. It's been found that a longer control bore is advantageous for accuracy and consistency. Most of the better kits out there simply use a two piece barrel where you just change out the backs. There's a plethora of them out there.  I'm a big fan of the stella kit from inception designs. Another good one is the lurker eigenbarrel. You can pick and choose what bores you want, and they are cheap. Amazing performance for the price."

Grabbed an A5 because as much crap as they get, I actually like Tippmann, and I'd prefer having a cheap, reliable marker that I still know how it works as I get back into it rather than blowing money on something fancy for now.  I'll wait and see before getting something nice. Plus worst case scenario, I can either machine or print replacement parts for pretty much the whole thing.  Spent my money on a nice ninja tank and remote instead, because those will transfer to whatever I do wind up getting."

I haven't shot what I would call really good paint in quite some time. ultra evil seems to still be pretty good, but other than that if I wanted high end paint I would be hard pressed to find it locally. All of the very nice paint that used to be available has either disappeared or the name has been taken from it and placed onto a different product.  The marbalizer you get now is ok, but it's still half the quality that it was 10 years ago. It ain't marbs."
paintball,3dos7n,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:03:08 2015 UTC,I think all this paint stuff is cognitive bias. Paint is much better now than what I used to use back in the day. You no longer have to spend an arm and a leg to get paint that is actually bright and shows up.
paintball,3dos7n,cptzanzibar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:06:11 2015 UTC,"It's not all terrible but I haven't had anything that impressed me in quite some time. I think that the measures they are probably using to cut costs and bring the prices down has noticeably impacted quality. What you get for a given product seems inconsistent. Maybe because they are shipping it farther?   I will say Valken graffiti, redemption, and GI 4 star have been good for me, and ultra evil seems about the same which is great. So it's not all bad.  Still I would happily pay $$$ for a case of diablo hellfire or RPS Premium today..."
paintball,3dos7n,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:14:03 2015 UTC,"Basic field paint is far superior now that it has ever been. What's gone is mid range paint. Like your hell fire or rps. This also is highly dependent on how your local field cares for its paint. My favorite local field keeps all field paint in a climate controlled building and has a high turn over rate. They also don't buy a years worth of paint at a time. They do 4, 3 month intervals. This helps tremendously.  It's as good as the paint I was paying extra for 7+ years ago. Prices have come down strictly due to decreases in manufacturing costs, that's true with most industries."
paintball,3dos7n,cptzanzibar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:04:30 2015 UTC,"Prices have come down strictly due to decreases in manufacturing costs, that's true with most industries.    That is not what I have heard, but it's all just ""rumors"" I guess. Can't back that up with anything concrete but if you think what you said is true you are ignoring the fact that paint has been getting smaller in size and manufacturing has been out sourced overseas. Snoop around a bit for yourself. Hell look at the box your paint is packaged in.  My experiences, as well as that of many others, just haven't been as good as yours unfortunately.  Hellfire was not a mid range paint...  RPS made the full spectrum of paint from field grade to tournament grade paint.   I agree proper storage (and transport for that matter) can make a big difference but the fact is that the number of choices for high quality paint have dwindled."
paintball,3dos7n,gwhy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:42:36 2015 UTC,"Paint sizes getting smaller does not indicate a drop in quality tho. Back in the day Evil was smaller than lower quality paints.   This is just a case of anecdotal he said she said then. My area must be rife with good paint because we don't have many issues.  Hell fire was certainly not high end, it was great paint, but it was overpriced for what you could get at the time IMO. I know what RPS made.   The number of choices dwindles because PB got smaller. You've essentially got 2 companies making high end paint now."
paintball,3dos7n,cptzanzibar,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:58:27 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not the case. I disagree on a few points:  1) Hellfire was literally one of the best paints that you could buy back in the late 90's and early 2000's. The only paint that was better? Imperial Hellfire, AKA Hellfire Darts. It came in vacuum sealed bags, and boxes made like suitcases. This was before GI came in and bastardized the Imperial name with their 5* line. RP tried to come close with various types of All Star, but Hellfire was the stuff to have.  2) In the beginning, Evil was a larger bore paint. The spiel at the time was that Evil was larger bore, but had a lighter fill. Thus it would ""fly straighter and farther."" Apparently, the rules of physics did not apply to Evil marketing material.  3) On the flip side, Diablo/DXS came in and said that Hellfire was smaller bore, with heavier fill. Thus, it would carry the momentum further. Again, I understand that physics does not work this way, but you would be surprised by what people believed back then.  4) Paint quality, on the whole, has decreased since the early 2000's. Why? Paint manufacturing technology has not changed at all. The wheel is pretty round on encapsulation machines - the only actual innovation on paint in the last 15 years has been the First Strike round (this does not count when RP came out with its non-glossy shell, because let's face it: that was just marketing mumbo jumbo). Price changes are dictated primarily by A) economies of scale (which have decreased significantly since 2008, as the sport took a dive due to the economy and B) quality control; in the early 2000's, manufacturers were much more willing to throw out paint that did not meet the stadard. Now? They either rebrand it into a lower line, or just throw it in the same box and sell it for cheaper.  Source: Worked in industry and have several friends who still do."

paintball,3dmgdt,north7,2,Sat Jul 18 00:29:36 2015 UTC,"A shoe box compressor will take about a day to fill a standard 68 tank. They aren't meant for commercial shops. The minimum cost on a compressor setup is about $5,000. At $5 a fill that's quite a long payback."
paintball,3dmgdt,Dozernaut,2,Fri Jul 17 21:19:05 2015 UTC,"I was unaware of the fill times, but it's not ""a day"" to fill a 68cu tank with a shoebox. According to their site, depending on the shoebox model it takes 35min to 1.2hrs to fill a 68ci tank. I guess you would get a big scuba tank (44cf) and keep that topped off with the shoebox, while doing 68ci fills off the scuba tank. That would run a lot more than $650, but nowhere near $5k"
paintball,3dmgdt,ScottyBeans,2,Sat Jul 18 00:19:35 2015 UTC,"Toms original shoebox fill time was a day. I see that fill times have improved but you are still looking at 1.75 - 3.5 hours to completely fill a 68/45. Even if you had a full scuba and the shoebox going, you would only be able to completely fill a 68/45 about once an hour. This is impracticable for a paintball proshop. The minimum cost on a compressor set up that can service a proshop/small field is $5,000."

paintball,3donkw,TheAmazingLeech,7,Sat Jul 18 01:25:54 2015 UTC,It could be the fact the gun isn't pressuring properly at the lower pressure output causing it to cycle wrong and making a double feed.  For the tippmann it's more likely a worn detent
paintball,3donkw,UselessGadget,1 point,Sat Jul 18 01:52:12 2015 UTC,"for a 98, if it doesn't have enough pressure to cycle the bolt all the way back and catch it will do this."
paintball,3donkw,TheAmazingLeech,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:19:51 2015 UTC,"True, but the worn detent is more likely"
paintball,3donkw,UselessGadget,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:47:37 2015 UTC,"I think they are describing what happens when you are getting low on CO2/Air pressure and it doesn't have enough pressure to completelly cycle.  He even describes it as ""my fps is low"" which would be an indication of lack of pressure."
paintball,3donkw,TheAmazingLeech,2,Sat Jul 18 22:54:23 2015 UTC,Yes but op said it doesn't happen when he cranks it back up
paintball,3donkw,UselessGadget,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:38:38 2015 UTC,Right.  Since he's putting more air pressure back into it it cycles correctly.

paintball,3donkw,kurse21,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:01:37 2015 UTC,With the barrel off does the paint roll through the barrel?  On the gun side with the barrel off does the paint roll through the feedneck and through the chamber?

paintball,3dny1c,zieros087,6,Fri Jul 17 20:32:25 2015 UTC,"I'd clean what you'd like off the exterior. Look up a disassembly video of a 98 and follow that and how they oil the marker. Chances are this things probably alright, just needs to be cleaned internally and oiled. After that you should be good to go, 98s are pretty hard to break."

paintball,3dny1c,miketerry1992,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:09:42 2015 UTC,"Just clean them up and oil the guts.  You might need some orings and you will very likely need new ball detents.  Obviously any tanks that old will be out of hydro too so you will need new ones, or you can get them tested."
paintball,3dny1c,Markuss69,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:21:35 2015 UTC,"Tearing them down probably is not necessary.  Take the barrel off, put some oil in the asa, air it up and shoot.  Did it shoot? Probably. Clean up the outside.   Is there dirt or paint on the inside where the cocking handle is? No? You're done. Go play and enjoy the nostalgia."
paintball,3dny1c,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:30:24 2015 UTC,"Guns could work.  Not hard to do it yourself.  You only need to change a handful of orings and maybe the cup seal.  Also, BLUE loctite those steel braided hose.    Take the time and do it yourself.  You'll learn valuable stuff and if you stick with the sport, you really shouldn't be able to get a better gun until you know these basics.  I should say, it will take about 2 weeks, in between getting the air and ordering parts that are needed."
paintball,3dny1c,PiratePantsFace,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:41:32 2015 UTC,"Probably going to be a pain in the ass getting them to work again, specifically with the powertube / valve o rings.

paintball,3dnsjo,fsjake,3,Fri Jul 17 19:51:11 2015 UTC,Air makes no difference. When you slide the pump backwards you are just compressing the hammer spring.

paintball,3dns25,tsrui480,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:16:46 2015 UTC,If you dont happen to have a the manual handy. Take out the bolt by unscrewing the back with a large allen key. push a swab through the front of the gun to push the bolt and spring out through the back.  Wiper everything down and make sure there isnt paint on anything. Then apply a light coating of grease to the bolt. Try to avoid getting grease on the tip of the bolt. It should be a very thin coat as too much grease can cause bolt stick. I use pathogen grease but any Dow 33 will be fine. Put it all back together and there ya go
paintball,3dns25,WalterReddit,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"Just curious, why should I avoid getting grease on the bolt"
paintball,3dns25,Ohmslaw79,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:00:35 2015 UTC,It will just shoot it through the barrel coating the inside of your gun in grease and causing you balls to go all over the place. so dont worry too much.

paintball,3dnefw,kavar13,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:09:35 2015 UTC,I'd just turn them off and see if it chops without them. You might be surprised.
paintball,3dnefw,socks86,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:35:29 2015 UTC,"Thx, for the suggestion. That was what I was going to do for the rest of this season.   The gun is set for 20 bps, the dwell is set for 45 ms 27ms (the optimal) and the hopper (Halo Too) should be able to handle 20+ bps.  I don't expect there to be any chopping, but I'll need to order some lube anyway."

paintball,3dn195,throwawayblahbeer,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"I've been playing with save phaces for the past 5 years and only recently heard about the safety controversy surrounding them. In my experience not only has the mask taken countless hits to the lens and held up perfectly but it has even caught trees, rocks and markers without so much as a crack. When I first started playing i even used my old one with a safety clip missing (terrible idea I know and have no intention of repeating it) and never had an issue with the lens moving out of position. The plastic used in the mask holds up extremely well and I have never had any worries about the build quality. And as a side note the lenses are ASTM/ANSI rated so i really don't know where you're getting that info."

For $100, you have awesome construction. I swear mine are brand new and I've had them since Christmas, only the logos have started to wear off, but that's not a biggie. (I've had the GI pants since a few weeks before the first CPL tournament in Chicago for reference, and I've only worn them about 5 times total).

paintball,3dkx26,xluminosityx,2,Fri Jul 17 15:10:40 2015 UTC,"Ehhh.... No more than normal shooting, though.  The bolt hits the detents whether there's paint in the marker or not."
paintball,3dkx26,GoldyGoldy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:06:07 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  I know for a fact when I first bought my Ion years ago I went through my first set of detent because of dry firing it.  After I got my LV1, a friend wanted to see what it sounded like so I ramped it for just a brief second and it caused me to replace the left detent."
paintball,3dkx26,xluminosityx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:31:56 2015 UTC,"So internally, what is different about the bolt moving back and forth when there isn't a ball, compared to when there is?  (Rhetorical)"
paintball,3dkx26,GoldyGoldy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:02:23 2015 UTC,Look man I don't engineer these guns but I'm telling you it kills the detents.  Why don't you prove me wrong?  All I can think of is the ball is absorbing a lot of the impact and pushing past the detents first as opposed to the bolt striking the detents which it's not meant to do.
paintball,3dkx26,xluminosityx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:23:51 2015 UTC,Burden of proof is on the accuser.  Having detents fail twice is hardly a convincing sample size.  Ive never heard of this before or seen it happen.
paintball,3dkx26,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:45:42 2015 UTC,"The only difference is the speed at which the bolt moves, which is fairly negligible except in an extremely limited number of markers... The LV1 being one of them.  I can't even name another."

paintball,3dkx26,goodtime_lurker,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:13:21 2015 UTC,"Pulling the trigger while the marker is on with no air can wear out the solenoid faster (but generally not that big of a deal). Use grease on the rammer orings and reg orings (when you do a reg rebuild), and oil on the bolt orings."

paintball,3dkx26,Fuzznutz14,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:33:20 2015 UTC,You should not use grease on the rammer. Grease is fine in the regulator but you should only use Oil on stacked poppet markers. Also you should not excessively lube the bolt.  I usually put 1 to 2 drops on the bolt and wipe it all over with a paper towel. Excess oil will cause dirt to gum up on the bolt and create scratches on the bolt and in the breach.

Even a lot of the cleaning solutions you think will be okay can actually wear down the coatings on the lenses too. Always use small amounts of solutions and try to get ones that are meant for glasses or for lad displays. They have similar finishes.

Break the cost of the tank down over that time and you'll see it looks like a lot up front but in the long run isn't that much.  My experience has been to spend a little more for a better quality product and it will pay back over time.

Wasn't my favorite place, and the fields aren't even full size. BOLP is in Lee NH which is pretty small (like 4 fields), but does have a full regulation speedball field.

If you have one of the old ones, you can contact Tippmann and they will likely send you a new one for free!). serviceshop@tippmann.com   I like running an Apex on my Tippmann's and set it at 3 clicks.

Like /u/socks86 says - you probably just need some a little bit of PB oil and it's likely they will be ready to rock again.  Looks like the A5 might be running the stock barrel, which are serviceable but pretty poor in the grand scheme.  So a replacement some day would probably be a nice step up for it.  In the near term - put your cash towards a nice mask. A good mask is the best spend in Paintball"

They'll work just fine the way they are now, most I would do is upgrade the barrel. Later on if you decide you want a marker that shoots like a speedball marker, then invest in a used speedball marker. do not try and turn your a-5 or 98 into a speedball marker."

The only real thing to replace would be with a barrel of your choice.  Save your money for paint or for an eventual upgrade to a higher class marker.  They definitely are tough little guns!  I've been using my A-5 for 10 years now (off and on since I'm stationed overseas) and it still works.  If you check out TrailsofDoom's YouTube section, he also goes over polishing the internals of your A-5 and 98.  It's not necessary to do, but gave my gun a smoother operation.  It'll also effect your FPS, so don't forget to chrono!"

paintball,3dkub2,Averageboi,4,Fri Jul 17 02:55:28 2015 UTC,"In that case, I'd suggest that you get some epoxy putty and mold your own.                You can get it for relatively inexpensive, and if you use a small piece of wood or something for the basic/filler shape, you can use less of the putty.             Depending on how permanent you want it, you can apply it directly to your pump handle (I'd suggest using some 500 grit sandpaper to prime it) and it'll pretty much be there forever.                        If you want to take it off in the future, you could wrap your pump handle in saran wrap, make some holes (so you can use zip ties to make it more secure) then use the epoxy putty.                       It hardens in about 10-15 minutes, and you can pretty much mold it to your hands. I'd suggest letting it cure for at least 24 hours before putting any pressure on it though.

paintball,3dj0vp,swordfrog23,4,Thu Jul 16 17:43:11 2015 UTC,"The Azodin Z2 is an electric gun, the most competitive of all of their markers. The KD2 is a basic semi-automatic mechanical marker (albeit with an on/off ASA and clamping feedneck.)    I would go with the Azodin Z2 personally if I had to make a choice, but all Azodin markers are blowback markers.  You can get a lower end spool for the same price as either of those markers (GOG Enmey or GOG Extcy, Proto rail)."
paintball,3dj0vp,MastaBro,2,Thu Jul 16 19:27:35 2015 UTC,I would go with neither. Putting electronics on a blow back marker does nothing for the performance of the marker do to the limitations of the blow back design.   And by your same point there's better markers had at that price point
paintball,3dj0vp,TheAmazingLeech,3,Thu Jul 16 19:52:35 2015 UTC,The KD2 runs at 225psi. Definitely not your average blowback. I want one.

paintball,3dj0vp,Yupoong,0,Fri Jul 17 00:36:01 2015 UTC,"Still a blow back. Iniffeciant, rough on paint, and inconsistent performance"
paintball,3dj0vp,TheAmazingLeech,2,Thu Jul 16 20:57:03 2015 UTC,"Azodin has the blowback thing down, the rammer needs less force on theirs to fire. They're pretty nice actually.  Though a lower end spool would still be better, i have to agree with you on that."
paintball,3dj0vp,mazu747,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:26:10 2015 UTC,I disagree on all points. Do some research. Shoot one.  This isn't a spyder or a tippmann. Performance should be more comparable to something like the AKA VLMs...

paintball,3dj0vp,TheAmazingLeech,2,Thu Jul 16 21:37:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe you shot the Kaos D, not the D2? They look the same but are quite different.  The D2 has impressed me. The enmey probably beats it with lower operating pressure, smoother shot, etc (I prefer spool valves to begin with) and its cheaper. The upside to the kd2 is you don't need to change anything other than maybe the barrel if you want to match paint, but for their target demographic that probably isn't a huge concern."

The bone stock marker needs literally nothing but air and paint, it's a great value. It looks like something very basic, its a bit of a sleeper gun.  It is not your average blowback as some are suggesting here. It is a mechanical semi with some very nice features.

YMMV Idk what youre asking V1 Vanquishes are pretty cheap now. Theyre made by different companies. This depends on what you find to be most important in a marker.   How about this, why dont you tell us what you find most important in a marker?  A lot of what youre asking is purely subjective.  Also vanquishes are spool valves. The are based on the SFT/NXT Shocker design."
paintball,3dj0h9,cptzanzibar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:01:03 2015 UTC,"Corrected the spool for the Vanquish, my bad, a lot of reading lately and I got confused.  Here is what I am looking for: silent, smooth, air efficient and yes I will admit it, if it looks cool it's a big plus (the markers mentioned in my post are all good looking to me).  I was pretty interested recently with the Axe Pro (I like the space between the trigger guard and the handle) but then I saw the Vanquish for the same price, that's when I decided to post.  I guess the main question is Axe Pro versus Vanquish, what is the real difference???  The next question is any of the planet eclipse mentioned worth the additional $300?"
paintball,3dj0h9,cptzanzibar,3,Thu Jul 16 18:16:48 2015 UTC,"Well, the difference between a Vanquish is one is a poppet based marker, the other is a spool based marker. You may want to look into the differences between the two.  What youre describing is the perfect marker. You will have to sacrifice one of those qualities with any marker you choose. These is nothing on the market thats silent, smooth, and highly efficient.   No, I do not feel the PE markers are worth the extra cash. Youre paying for the name. There are plenty of markers out there that perform at the same level and you arent paying PE premiums. The Axe is a good example. Is it top notch? No. Will it do every single thing a Geo will do at the same level but a fraction of the price? Yes it will."
paintball,3dj0h9,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:27:33 2015 UTC,"You arent paying for the name when the Axe is using the cheap components it does though.

paintball,3dj0h9,cptzanzibar,2,Thu Jul 16 18:32:40 2015 UTC,"All youre getting from PE is fit and finish. Yes the Axe uses cheap components, but the performance is exactly the same. Im not even an Axe fan, but it would be wrong to say it doesnt perform on a professional level.  Thats why I do not believe in paying PEs insane markups. And theyve been doing ti forever.

(Captain and I can argue the merits of BL vs PE all day on here and not get anywhere.)  That being said I'd probably take the base AXE of the options listed above. Or if money is no option, then the LV1. Both have the low maintenance design of a poppet  with great efficiency to boot."
paintball,3dj0h9,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:01:37 2015 UTC,"Axes are cheap and dime a dozen, of course they arent gonna hold resale better. People put a lot of stock into a name. As for the Vanquish, people want Luxes instead because of the name, thats why they dont hold resale as well. Theres no real reason Luxes hold their value better than a Squish, outside of the name. Theyre essentially the same marker.  Theres just nothing PE markers do that demand the premium price over many other brands. They idiot proof their markers tho, so I guess thats a plus."
paintball,3dj0h9,Aidspanda,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:34:26 2015 UTC,"Well, they come with a nice hard case, parts kit, lube, tools etc.  That alone is worth it to some people as far as the all around package.  I like that I can use a microswitch or optical switch for my trigger. Do I need it? Of course not.   For a new player with the disposable income PE is what I recommend. The fact that you can pull them out of your bag and play, every time, is key.  This comes from owning most every high end on the market.  If I was balling on a budget I'd probably get an Axe of those markers listed. (And a g6r otherwise)"
paintball,3dj0h9,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:35:24 2015 UTC,"a nice hard case, parts kit, lube, tools etc.   All of which can be had for waaayyy cheaper than what PE charges you for it. Again, just PE markup on basic stuff. Theyre also certainly not the only company that does that either.   The fact that you can pull them out of your bag and play, every time, is key.   But again, this is not exclusive to PE, at all. You dont need to pay PEs markup to get that.  I dont believe in disposable income. That extra $300-$400 youre spending on something PE buys you a high end hopper and nice tank, which is more important than some PE branded ball end allen keys."
paintball,3dj0h9,Ravenye,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:05:58 2015 UTC,"Now i will come in and give my opinion about a thing or two :>  I think, that you pull all PE markers over the same edge only because of the name. Saying everything is fit and finish when they do offer a variety of markers that are in different perspectives better than the axe. For example, their poppetline being more efficient and their spoolline being quieter than in this case, the axe. Now, im not looking at the Geo+ or Ego6 when i say this, but the newer ones, Geo 3+ and Ego11+. Axe is a great marker, own one myself and i do believe that in many cases it might be a better choice for newer players that want a cheap allround marker 100% ready for tourneys. Especially in 'murica for the price range (PE is hella more cheap here in Sweden).  But something i do feel after owning several PE markers and an axe for a long time is that something that you can pull all PE markers over one edge with is simplicity. They are reliable (which the axe is as well) and simple (which the axe isn't in all perspectives). I have recently gone through hell with the little axe i have as it recently broke down. SO and I have fixed axes for buddys and they are simpler than some to troubleshoot but no way near PE, imo. Now i AM bias when i write this due to being certified Tech regarding PE but not with Empire.   But, PE's high end markers does have the usual tilt (poppet or spool-tilt) while the axe is more of an allround. Best at nothing good at most, because of the inline poppet. Which make it so awesome. But this comparison to spools and stacked tubes in a whole different tier is nuts.  Is high end markers worth it over midranges? Depends on you, not the marker (as in if you and your values, preference etc.).  TLDR: PE is awesome, but i do believe an axe might be a better choice for many (and in this case). I just want to give some perspective on PE in this."
paintball,3dj0h9,mazu747,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:33:20 2015 UTC,"Gunna go out on a limb here a bit. The LV1 is a smooth and quiet as hell for a poppet, like a low-mid end spool.  Though the Axe is cheaper and still loud and I smooth like most poppets, they are one of the smoother and quieter poppets.  If money is not a concern, LV1 all day.  If you could be using the extra cash to play more paintball, go on a few dates or whatever, get the Axe.  At the end of the day, you can't go wrong with either!"

paintball,3dj0h9,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:19:13 2015 UTC,"1 - Too close to tell, doesnt matter anyway 2 - Axe by far 3 - Axe: fewer orings and its a poppet so much less sensitive to oring fit and lube than the shocker-based Luxe 4 - See above, the Axe is very forgiving if for some reason you dont do regular maintenance 5 -What? 6 - Yep, people from Empire sponsored teams buy cheap and resell cheap which drives the value down.  The older vanquishes are cheaper than the 2.0 7 - A lot.  Id pick an Eclipse marker over pretty much any other option with the improvements theyve made lately.  Used to dislike them but theyve made BIG leaps.  Biggest difference is going to be build quality and being softer on paint.  The Axe can be very gentle too but you have to do a little fiddling to set it up right.  Geo will be smoother than the Axe, or more efficient than the Vanquish.  Equal in most other regards. 8 - A Geo 3 w/IV Core will be about $600-$625 and performs the same as a 3.5, or the Etek 5 is $550 or less new and almost hangs with the LV1"

You would be best served finding some Youtube reviews, overviews, shooting vids, etc.  I have to say I dont see an advantage to the Vanquish over any option on the market right now other than someone really liking its ergonomics (which arent really unique).  But there are certainly disadvantages it has."
paintball,3dj0h9,Gnarcosis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:36:13 2015 UTC,"Between the Axe and vanquish I prefer an axe.  It's a workhorse of a marker and shoots smooth enough.  The vanquish on the other hand let's just say I had to fix the same one 3 times in the same day (2 of 3 times was to reduce the bolt assembly).  Found that the Axe was easier to maintain. Personally I would prefer to shoot a used Geo 3 in the $500-600 range.  Super smooth,  nice ergos,  better imo (over Empire oled) controls."

paintball,3dio4s,TardyTheTurtle_,6,Thu Jul 16 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"Theyre good. Better than what you mentioned, for the price.  The only thing thats maintenance heavy about the G6R is needing to tune the regs once per year. But that in turn gives you the best shooting poppet for the efficiency it grants. I find the shot more satisfying than an LV1. It gives just as little kick but the feel has more snappiness than the LV1.  You wouldnt be making a bad decision with the Impulse or G6R. Both are top notch."
paintball,3dio4s,cptzanzibar,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:34:39 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the input. I had been away from the sport for like 10 years, so coming back I wasn't as well versed in today's markers and didn't want to buy something junky."
paintball,3dio4s,tsrui480,2,Thu Jul 16 17:17:43 2015 UTC,The Impulse and the G6R are both great markers. Personally I would choose the G6R. The maintenance is pretty minimal on both markers but you really cant beat the efficiency and shot of a tuned G6R.  You cant go wrong with either one though.
paintball,3dio4s,kavar13,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:59:05 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, good to know I can't screw up this decision too badly!"
paintball,3dio4s,Cuhrunchy,2,Thu Jul 16 17:19:09 2015 UTC,"I have a g6r and love it. I've also had the pleasure of shooting an impulse. Pros: the g6r shoots better but the trigger frame on the impulse feels just a little better. Cons: the impulse has a snap ring on the hpr and the g6r likes low pressure from the tank and Dow 55. If you care for cases, the impulse has a soft case while the g6r gets a box. Can't go wrong with either honestly."
paintball,3dio4s,nZcastillo,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:47:45 2015 UTC,"I love my Impulse so much. Bought it as a cheap way to get back onto the speedball course after 3 years off. After a fine LPR tuning to get a buttery smooth shot, all I've had to do is clean the bolt and lube the ram after I shoot it. I am very impressed by it at $500. I haven't had to fool with the dreaded snap ring on the regulator yet, and I've also heard about people having trouble with some sort of eye delay before firing, but my Impulse has been basically perfect after about 7 cases through it now. All I've done to it is buy a one piece carbon fiber freak barrel for some bore options. This marker needs nothing else."
paintball,3dh08l,AnBu_JR,3,Thu Jul 16 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"As to your gear downsizing; yes, it's practical to not have a backup, but I find paintball guns to be more of an addiction than a matter of practical need.  I never bring a backup anymore.  I did for the longest time, but hardly ever used it."
paintball,3dh08l,stressedoutatumc,2,Thu Jul 16 07:33:14 2015 UTC,Im a pump player. The field I play at is wide open expanses between building and I find playing stock class outside of big games is a huge challenge so I often run open class. I always have my grey ghost sitting in my car incase of a break down with one of my autococker pumps because I know nelsons never break down. I know a lot of people have back up GOG markers or 98s just in case. If one of my team mates hate a big breakdown I usually lend them my marker and pull out the grey ghost.
paintball,3dh08l,StockClassCanadian,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:54:36 2015 UTC,"I liked the idea of bringing spares to the field every day I could make it out, but that quickly turned into a bunch of stuff I didn't end up needing and that I'd wished I had left at home.  Now, I'm just extra careful to make sure my stuff is in good working order well before a game day, so I can get it fixed in time if it's beyond me. All I bring to the field now as a backup is a low-end slingshot (in case my gun breaks beyond repair at the field). I've only had to use it once in two years going every other weekend (ignoring all the times I've used it for a laugh)."
paintball,3dh08l,NotYoFriendGuy1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:28:03 2015 UTC,TFX is a great hopper.  I really like mine.  Man I am not such a huge fan of the Axe Pro.  Something stings me with it(I am an Empire fanboi too).  I'd look at the Shocker RSX over the Axe Pro personally.  Those two coupled together with a Ninja 68 or 77SL would be the lightest set-up out there.  (I love how light they all are! I own all)

paintball,3dh08l,kurse21,1 point,Thu Jul 16 10:17:05 2015 UTC,"It's always nice to have a backup of each type of equipment that you've listed.  If you're wanting to save weight and to get away from lugging it around you may want to leave a set in your trunk while you're playing.    The only thing I'd skimp on would be the extra tank and mask.  You can usually cheaply rent or borrow those relatively easy if need be.  I like having an extra hopper incase of a internal break.  Just plug and play the spare and clean the primary when you're cleaning the rest of your gear at home.    Extra gun, obvious pro's to this.    Also, currently, you have a full setup for a friend."
paintball,3dh08l,PhilDunphyDeltaMedic,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:34:40 2015 UTC,You will regret getting rid of your spares. If you ever take a noobie they will have a far better experience with your stuff vs shit rental gear.  Plus gear will go down time to time so it is great to have extras.
paintball,3dh08l,ScottyBeans,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:53:13 2015 UTC,I like having backups for the peace of mind during tournaments.  I also like having different guns for recball vs tournament days vs pump days.   Having a backup mask doesn't seem like a huge deal though.
paintball,3dgnlz,OffensiveHandle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:05:09 2015 UTC,Someone on Macdev Militia had the great idea to stick an extra O-ring on the valve body (black piece bottom middle) to cushion the bolt when it travels backward and rams into the hard plastic flange. Instead of metal-on-plastic contact it's now metal-on-rubber. Also moves the bolt forward about 1mm in the resting position and reduces rollback in the breech.   Put 6 pods through it in various fire modes including uncapped full auto and not a single chop or barrel break.

paintball,3dh490,Blodhgarm,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:11:42 2015 UTC,Get a ninja 45/45 and I would suggest upgrading your mask.  You probably won't find a bundle.
paintball,3dh490,xluminosityx,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:24:52 2015 UTC,"The Axe is the staple of the industry, so it's hard to find a 'better' marker. Very well balanced. The peanut is awesome, but if you can, try one first. So many people find them uncomfortable because they're so small (I'm one of those people :P)  The best loader you'll probably find is a rotor. I think used, depending where you are, you can find them from $70-120 in pretty good condition. Otherwise, Halo's are dirt cheap used and pretty good, but they're very heavy and bulky.   Simply by the helix being dual pane, you're a mile ahead of the renters. ProFlex and EFlex are hella popular, and with good reason. Dye i4's are sweet too, if you're okay with a little less protection, but amazing visibility and arguably the smallest profile on the market."
paintball,3dh490,NotYoFriendGuy1,-1,Thu Jul 16 06:22:20 2015 UTC,Thank you.
paintball,3dh490,desert0mirage,2,Thu Jul 16 07:00:01 2015 UTC,"Having owned a helix dual pane, and upgrading to the eflex, the lens is the same but the eflex foam is much more comfortable. The eflex also gets more bounces off the bottom."
paintball,3dh2x3,HooverTV,3,Thu Jul 16 05:35:12 2015 UTC,"If you're only carrying two pods, the weight is almost negligible. If you're also carrying a tank, it's still barely anything. I use this, myself, and I actually really like it for what it is. Yes, you do have two empty slots if you only run two pods, but those can actually cause an occasional bounce and it can synch very snugly, and I wear it high on my waist so, if anything, it actually supports my back better than a vest did.  Side question: what marker do you use?"
paintball,3dh2x3,NotYoFriendGuy1,2,Thu Jul 16 05:44:02 2015 UTC,Valken makes a super lightweight pod vest that would be perfect for what you want. its essentially a pack with straps that go around your shoulders.

paintball,3dhcn8,DrKippy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:02:05 2015 UTC,"It's the post stop screw, its were you adjust for where the trigger stops after activating the micro switch. I guess you could try and tape it to slow the wear on the anno or you could remove it for a deep trigger pull."

paintball,3dg0za,Red-Rise,6,Thu Jul 16 01:11:35 2015 UTC,Because they can be shot out of the barrel with the pull of the trigger. All of the fields in my area (Houston) ban them for that reason.

paintball,3deyje,shark6428,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:47:45 2015 UTC,"I usually buy my masks with clear lenses, then I buy some kind of specialized lens... Smoke, mirror, colored, etc... And I put that new lens on the mask.  That's the lens I'll use for everything, except in crazy dark environments like night games or in really bad rain.  Other than that, the clear lens just stays in the gearbag.  I replace my primary lens whenever it gets scratched enough to bug me."
paintball,3deyje,GoldyGoldy,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:32:47 2015 UTC,"I bought my Grillz off of a dude and they came with a smoke, and a yellow dual pane-  I use the yellow if I'm playing woodsball in the shade- especially in the fall when its a lot darker in the forest- and the smoke for pretty much everything else.  Some have their uses, some are just for looks, though I believe all the colors/varieties have an advertised purpose."
paintball,3deyje,HotSAuceMagik,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:43:33 2015 UTC,"Swapping lenses wouldn't likely affect or improve fogging. Fogging occurs because our breath has near 100% humidity and condenses on the inside of the mask. If fogging is an issue, try a dual-pane lens if you aren't already or an anti-fogging agent. An old (temporary) trick from SCUBA diving is to clean the inside lens with some spit. This makes it more difficult for the water molecules to cling together and fog up. Your spit is technically working as a ""surfactant.""  Some people like yellow lenses especially for woodsball as it enhances one's ability to see contrast (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10701805).  Most manufacturers suggest to replace the lens annually. Although not the cheapest to replace every year, if a freak accident occurs and you're injured due to the lens you would be on a must stronger standing legally by following the manufacturer's recommendations to the word.  Hope that helps!"
paintball,3deyje,SpartanPB,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:13:06 2015 UTC,"Hey man, I actually have virtue as a sponsor and play with an vio extend.  I would suggest it over the contour for two reasons.   The soft ears and bottom half of the mask are going to give you bounces.  I've gotten many bounces off it.  Had it be the contour, it would have broken due to the harder plastic The extend is much more breathable because it's bigger.   To your question though.  The mask is actually difficult to change the lens the first or second time.  It just needs to be broken in.  Once that happens, it's very easy.  The reason to buy an extra lens is for playing conditions.  My mask came with a smoke lens (good for sunny days) and I got a clear one for less sunny days to see better.  Some people like a yellow lens because they feel it makes things more visible.  Others like mirror reflect lens because it looks cool and gives your eyes protection on sunny days like a smoke lens.  The other reason for an extra lens is in case the lens gets scratched you can swap it out with no issues for the rest of the day.  This doesn't happen very often if you are careful with your gear but things happen.  Lastly, for replacing a lens you don't have to replace it unless: 1. It is not easy to see out of 2. Scratched 3. Cracks from being hit too many times."

A nice tinted lens makes playing in direct bright sunlight much more comfortable. Where you might want a clear lens for playing at night or in rainy weather because it is easier to see through with the low ambient light available.  Changing lenses shouldn't make you fog less, unless the lens you are replacing is ruined.  Generally you would want to replace the lens if it starts fogging, or if it is really scratched up. And that will depend on how often and how hard you play."
paintball,3deyje,Chinoodle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"I change my lenses when they start fogging. (I run thermal lenses) that is typically once a year, or every 8 months, depends on how much I play and how humid it is when I'm playing... I had BRAND new lenses at living legends and it was so humid I was fogging even with a new lens...   I also keep my mask inside my house when not playing, don't leave it out in the garage or where temps fluctuate, as that is hard on the lens and foam.   I run yellow lenses only, they make a huge difference in the woods.   I also run a fan in my mask, makes a huge difference on days where you are playing in 100% humidity."
paintball,3deyje,TrailsOfDoom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:26:55 2015 UTC,"Old school masks were TERRIBLE at being able to remove the lens.  Just look at the JT Proflex, which is still around.  You want to remove the mask for cleaning.  Sometimes you get gogged and the paint goes where you can't reach it without removing the lens.  Best to just remove the lens real quick and be done with it.  You also want to remove your lens if you're alternating between woodsball (no shading on your lens) to speedball (shading on your lens). However, I just have dedicated masks for either  edit: You should ALWAYS replace your lens after one year.  ALWAYS.  I don't care if it looks flawless.  Replace the damn thing every year.  Your eyes are not worth going cheap on this."

A good way to try to use your diaphragm is to inhale fully, then exhale, but leave your ribcage fully puffed out. Use the muscles in your lower abdomen to push the air in and out, without letting your ribs contract or expand. THe more you do this, the stronger it gets and the more control you have. Once you get better at it, youll be able to strongly and sharply move air over your vocal chords. Your vocal chords should distort via mass airflow, not by straining in your throat. Its hard to describe honestly."

paintball,3dghvz,OffensiveHandle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:54:56 2015 UTC,"Problem is probably not with the paint.   When you shoot CO2 the bottle gets cold. There's no reg on the bottle because it relies on thermodynamics to ""regulate"" pressure. So your output pressures are probably all over the place and making the gun less accurate."
paintball,3dghvz,NotYoFriendGuy1,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:19:30 2015 UTC,"Like everyone is kind of already saying, CO2 is a huge factor. It's very inconstant from shot to shot and can have widely varying pressures forcing paint down the barrel each time, causing them to interact very differently with the apex barrel, which thrives off consistency. If you can, HPA is a huge improvement.   Also, even though it's a new barrel, it is still a good idea to give it a nice clean. Between the factory your hands, there could have been dust or oils that somehow got in and are now affecting your shots. There are a lot of videos on YouTube showing how to take apart an apex barrel for maintenance. They're worth a watch.  Lastly, once all else is good, make sure you know how to properly use your apex. A lot of people I see just jam the slider all the way back and wonder why they can't hit anything but the floor. Doing that can not only send your shots in crazy directions at short to medium distances, but it can also break balls very easily. Also, make sure that the apex is correctly assembled and not loose, so that it stays oriented the same way shot to shot. The best success I've seen is at 3 or 4 ""clicks"", about middle setting if I recall. That gives enough spin for consistency, but not so much that it's hitting the ground from a level aimed marker.  TL;DR: HPA>CO2, clean your barrel even though it's new, and make sure you know how your shit works. :)  Good luck!"
paintball,3dghvz,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:54:56 2015 UTC,"apex barrel is not meant for accuracy...   basically what happen is that right before the paintball is about to exit the barrel, there's a rubber ramp that imparts spin on the ball. There is no way you can make it consistent. You will have to shoot a few extra to get paint to go where you want it to go. it isn't meant for accurate shots but more for distance and shooting under tree branches and stuff."
paintball,3dghvz,TrailsOfDoom,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:19:05 2015 UTC,"First off, show us a picture of the paint you are shooting. Likely it has dimples and flat spots. You need round paint. Paint is by far the most important thing you buy for paintball, and bad paint is ALL OVER the marketplace. The difference between good players and new players, is their ability to buy good paint.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WuTx2EP4u4  Any paint that is in good shape will shoot well. I prefer gloss shelled paints to matte finish paints (matte finish is paint like formula 13) Gloss with backspin shoots further, and has less drag. The fill matters too, the thicker the fill the better it will spin. Real watery paint won't spin well, and paint with air pockets inside the paint (been seeing that lately from GI Sports paint) will not shoot very well as it isn't weighed the same, and will fly off one way or another.   Second, turn down your velocity. You want to be at 280FPS max. If you don't have a chrono and your paint is good, and it is going every which way, it is because you are shooting hot... People think more velocity will be better, but when you exceed 300fps (and A-5s often shoot at 350fps out of the box). The paint will go all over...  Make sure the rubber ramp is clean with no grease or dirt on it. And push the button to 3 clicks forward from the back. That way you will be putting a ""flat"" shot trajectory and not a trick shot. The more ramp you put on the paint (aka trick shot up around 8 clicks) the more your accuracy suffers.   I use Co2 primarily. It is fine for an A5 with Apex. People that bitch about it don't know what a properly tuned A-5 can do with Co2. So they think you need compressed air. That is bull. I play with Co2 year round. Sure you get less shots in the winter, but with a remote line (acts as an expansion chamber) a Co2 equipped marker is VERY consistent shot to shot when properly maintained.   Don't take my word for it, here is video proof, all of my A-5's shoot like this, and you can make yours shoot this way too with a tiny bit of work.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Te9Z4SHh33k"
paintball,3dghvz,tsrui480,1 point,Thu Jul 16 12:20:40 2015 UTC,"Like what others have posted, the apex barrel will not help you with accuracy at all. In fact, it is more detrimental to accuracy than helpful. If you want to get an accurate shot make sure you use some somewhat decent paint that isnt dimpled."
paintball,3dghvz,Chinoodle,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:53:49 2015 UTC,"Are the shots just inaccurate, or are they chopping? If they're chopping a good amount I would check the apex ramp underneath the shroud. I have seen them come improperly assembled from empire before.  As far as CO2, unless if he was rapidly firing or going from an extremely warm to cold area it shouldn't be fluctuating enough to make a noticeable difference.  The most important thing regarding accurate fire from the apex is the proper paint. If you're shooting old, swollen, or dimpled paint any barrel will give you inconsistent results."

The best regulators on the market as well.   I own the 50/4500 grey ghost, and the ninja SL 77/4500. My 77ci tank is pretty much the same weight as the 50ci. If you spend a little bit more for the 50/4500 SL you will not be disappointed, you will never want another tank.  As far as a non fog mask, I second the Vios. I own a pair and they're outstanding. Only fog issue I ever had is when rain was literally dripping in from the vents, and a visor quickly stopped that. Also be wary of the chromatic lenses, they scratch ridiculously easy. In general the lenses scratch easy."
paintball,3dfmdw,Chinoodle,2,Wed Jul 15 22:29:10 2015 UTC,"I like dye i4s personally, small, light, won't fog.  As for tank, anything made by Ninja will be great, iirc the 50 is rather small tank, although that might be something you'd like, as /u/Chinoodle said the carbon tanks are all gonna be about the same weight."

paintball,3dcng8,RAND0M-HER0,2,Wed Jul 15 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"Nitrogen has been dead in paintball for several years now and everyone does compressed air now. He either went to a field with no compressed air, or is very used to using nitrogen previously   It's quite possible this guy did have it filled with Nitrogen. Now I'm not 100% certain if they can mix, but I feel like it shouldn't be a problem because they're practically the same gas.  If you're worried, strap the tank on your marker and shoot it dry then have it filled next time you play. As for after you play, good rule of thumb is get your tank filled before you leave at the end of the day in case you need to do some maintenance or just want to test it out. There nothing wrong with having a full tank of air hanging around, it's not dangerous unless you drop it and the regulator breaks :)"

paintball,3dcng8,SlidePanda,2,Wed Jul 15 13:20:34 2015 UTC,"The air we breathe is nearly 80% nitrogen, so it doesn't matter if you are using Nitrogen or Compressed Air, or a mixture of both.  You will not see a benefit or difference one way or another.  If you are playing on a field, they will have compressed air, because they have an air compressor pumping up the tanks.  If you wanted to get a group of friends together and go out and play woodsball or something, a compressor and tank is a VERY large commitment (upwards of $3000 for the compressor alone).  So what most people do is rent a prefilled tank from a gas/welding supply company.  You can rent a 5-6k PSI tank filled with Nitrogen for $60-80, and you would have enough air to fill up a dozen players tanks for a solid 9-5 day of paintball.  Most gas/welding supplies don't have ""compressed air"" tanks, just compressed nitrogen.  That all being said, I am guessing this guy didn't play at fields a lot or brought his own air to fields (which is pretty odd).  Also, nitrogen filled tires are a very large scam."
paintball,3dcng8,joocenasty,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:32 2015 UTC,"Also, nitrogen filled tires are a very large scam.   Unless one is a hard core motorsports racer... Then it helps with pressure stability from cold to hot tire states.... Total edge case though   If you wanted to get a group of friends together and go out and play woodsball or something, a compressor and tank is a VERY large commitment   There's actually a couple 'shoe-box' models out there now for a few hundred dollars. The catch is they are very very... very very slow. So if you have days of lead time to just let it run... it'll do. But yeah - for large volumes not viable so you're looking at the multi thousand dollar big beasts"

paintball,3dcbhx,Evohate,2,Wed Jul 15 03:55:32 2015 UTC,"I would definitely go to a store and hold them or try and shoot them. The Maxx will be smooth, but inefficient and require a little more maintenance. The Etha will be a solid gun with good efficiency and require low maintenance (but still require it), I also hear that the Etha vibrates a lot, but I have never shot one. The mini will be smooth, easy to maintain, and all around reliable but it can be a little uncomfortable if you are a taller guy/girl. I don't have much knowledge on the G5 but people will tell you to stay away from them because they are unreliable. A few people at my field have DP guns and they don't seem to have a problem with them but you never know. It pretty much all comes down to preference and what feels right to you. If I had to choose between these markers I would probably go with the mini. But if you are open to buying used I would look around the used market a little, you can find some great deals on great markers."

I held and fired (or dry fired) all of those and while they were all miles better than what I was currently using- I found the Mini GS to be my favorate- odd considering I'm 6ft and 250lbs.  I liked that it was more compact than the rest, very light, easy to use, and reportedly super low maintenance (plus Kee's great warrenty).  I finally got it out this weekend and couldn't have been happier!  TLDR- all of those will be a great starter- use your own requirements and actually hold them to decide which one fits you best."

My FX was out of service for weeks while I was tinkering with it and replacing broken parts. My local field had a project mini they let me use and it shot nice.

I ended up just selling it as broken, as the Bob Long tech ended up thinking it was probably the solenoid, and I didn't want to deal with that.

paintball,3dc82g,leeked,2,Wed Jul 15 03:26:00 2015 UTC,"Woops hi there. I wish I'd seen this earlier but I've been engrossed in the unfolding drama of the stolen collection of Matrix guns on PBN. I am very, very familiar with all things on the original Matrix and am happy to go into GREAT DETAIL about things should you so desire.  ""Snapping off the power switch"" to me indicates you've got a Gen 1 slide switch LED board with the F and S letters engraved on the back handle. Those broke all the time because it was a stupid design. Also the board has extremely limited options so your best bet is something like a Tadao if you can find one. They rock. The only upside slide switch boards had is the plastic microswitch made by Cherry which only takes like 5g of force to activate instead of the 25g Omron ones in every other board out there.  You're going to want an LPR and ditch that transfer spool. Common inexpensive options are to find a PBC one. The Cool Kids grab the ones from AKA or Aardvark mostly because of the street cred. I would stay away from the Shocktech ones as I find them finicky, and the Hybrid and Extreme Rage ones also have bad reputation for breaking or being made cheaply.  You're also DEFINITELY going to want to get a Gen 2 bolt kit which are, thankfully, dirt cheap. I can point you toward people who likely have them and can probably mod the top hat for you (you want this). I am happy to answer questions about this. I can also tell you how old it is depending on where the serial number is on the body and how it's etched on."
paintball,3dc82g,BonesJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:32:56 2015 UTC,"Fantastic! I'm always looking to learn about these older guns, they were way out of my price range years ago and now I've got disposable income!  The board does have a slide switch and a Cherry microswitch, no F and S marks on the backstrap however, and no serial number or other marks that I can see anywhere actually.  I've always heard the first gen guns were huge air hogs, so definitely interested in upgrades and mods if you have recommendations and sources for them. She and holds air well now, but I'd love to get her singing."
paintball,3dc82g,BonesJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:21:43 2015 UTC,"The serial number is actually going to be on the bottom of the main body between the hole for the solenoid and the hole for the wiring harness. You'll have to take off the two grip frame screws and be mindful of the wiring connected to the board to be able to see it. It will either be stamped with a number that reads E-xxxxxx (where X is a number) or hand-scratched.  The first gen bolt kits are air hogs because both gen 1 and gen 2 bolt kits were designed wrong. You can fix this with what's called a ""top hat mod"" which just shrinks the volume of the shot chamber to be less wasteful. The main reason I recommend getting at least a gen 2 bolt kit is because the weak, fragile areas were beefed up and the tolerances were improved.  I am actually so enchanted with these guns that a few years ago I researched everything I could find and wrote up some stuff on them:  History & IDs thread  Tech thread  Hmm. Looks like I have some broken images in there. Thanks a lot imageshack AND MACBETH YOU GREEDY WHORE  Anyway, my PERSONAL recommendations to get the gun where I want it are as follows:   LPR. PBC will be the cheapest easiest solution. Tadao board. They're just that good. Clamping feedneck. Any Matrix threaded one will do. Yes, Dye used the same threading when they did their stuff. Gen 2 bolt with modded top hat. You can mod the thing yourself if you have half a brain. Orange S.A.M. bolt. Hard to find, sadly. Like 1/3 the weight of the original bolt which reduces kick an amazing amount. Sometimes these bolts unglue themselves and fall apart so uh... be mindful of that. CP trigger. This is just my personal preference since I find the original trigger not to my liking. I love the CP ones. Also I take out trigger springs because I hate them, but to each their own.     On a side note, there is a slim chance your gun is so old that it has the original NuMatics solenoid inside it, instead of the SMC model that was used until like 2007."
paintball,3dc82g,BonesJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:41:15 2015 UTC,"Great stuff, I'll be taking it apart momentarily to check the serial number and see what else I can discover. Pictures will be forthcoming!"
paintball,3dc82g,BonesJackson,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:49:15 2015 UTC,"Okay, so the camera isn't cooperating, but here's what I found so far:  Serial number appears to be a hand scratched 417, solenoid is an SMC. Pulled the breech and the back plug and the bolt didn't seem to want to go out either way, so I didn't press my luck and left it be for now.  If you're willing to share your parts connections via post or PM that would be fantastic and searching online isn't turning up a ton."
paintball,3dc82g,BonesJackson,2,Thu Jul 16 00:45:59 2015 UTC,"Hand scratched means the guns were assembled by the original Aardvark crew before the split happened, so that's a proper OG body made by Mike Kelly.  The back plug definitely comes out properly if enough force is applied counter-clockwise like any regular screw. It's probably just stuck with old grease and the aforementioned shoddy tolerances of gen 1 bolts. The bolt kit will either be silver or black and use an oddly small allen wrench for removal. Gen 2s used a 1/4"" allen key.  For parts I suggest contacting harjukewm on PBN. I have traded with him many times and met him personally. His feedback is impeccable. Here is one of his sale threads."
paintball,3dc82g,GoldyGoldy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:01:06 2015 UTC,"The back plug came out without too much effort, but the bolt assembly itself wasn't so cooperative. It appears that the back of the bolt itself is messed up, as I didn't see any sign of a hex head there. The bolt appears to be all black.  Emailed harjukewm to inquire about everything you've mentioned, never collected enough posts on PBN to send PMs!"
paintball,3dc82g,socks86,1 point,Thu Jul 16 01:49:47 2015 UTC,"What does the back plug look like? Did someone drill a shape into it or something? There are a couple odd aftermarket pieces where you'd need to use a quarter (yes, US currency) to get the thing out but they are stupid.  Even though the Gen 1 is a bit different than the Gen 2 kit, use this for a guide on taking the bolt out.  As far as getting the damn thing out, the easiest solution I have is as follows. Take a barrel from a gun you don't care about and slip the thick end over the bolt. Mash or tap the other end with a rubber mallet so you're effectively pushing the bolt out back from the front. I did this illustrated in Step 5 with a stick."

paintball,3d7d6k,Ninjahavekk,2,Tue Jul 14 14:56:22 2015 UTC,Apparently people in the Battlebots sub seem to believe that the only way a tank could explode would be via it being filling to much. They hypothesized that a cut or a gash in the tank would result in only a rapid but less violent decompression.   Apparently.
paintball,3d7d6k,crazyike,5,Tue Jul 14 03:19:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah they aren't wrong. Remember Jaws? Shooting the compressed air? That was tested, I think Mythbusters did it. A tank just doesn't blow up like that."

paintball,3d7d6k,Ninjahavekk,7,Wed Jul 15 03:26:50 2015 UTC,"Yes and no, a tank can only catastrophically explode when it has been overfilled or if the tank has had oil introduced into the system. If the tank is ruptured or damaged the primary concern would be that you would create a projectile rocket out of the tank. If the tank is securely held within the bot and the bot weighs enough to overcome the force coming out of the ruptured hole it would remain stationary or vent ""spin"" in the direction opposite the rupture."

paintball,3d7d6k,Ninjahavekk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:06:54 2015 UTC,"What if you had a CF tank and somehow put a cut in the wrap? Without the continuous fibers couldn't the tank split from the hole and mushroom out? At the very least it'd be a very violent decompression, maybe an outright explosion right?"
paintball,3d7d6k,HELP_IM_ON_FIRE,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:30:33 2015 UTC,"Any damage to the carbon fiber wrap and lower the strength and structure of the tank so of course any damage to the carbon fiber you want to stop using that system. Damage to the carbon fiber to the point where it would no longer structurally reinforce the aluminum would have to be purposely physically forcibly done, as in you would have to WANT to do that to the tank for that to happen because something like that would not occur naturally since the aluminum is bonded to the carbon fiber core then wrapped and then reinforced with a resin.  Part of the DOT standards are to have the tank go quite literally into a bonfire and last for X amount of time and they even take the tanks out to a range and shoot it with a 50 caliber rifle, the results of which I am not sure but it has to withstand a certain level of damage. I understand what you are saying and did have to sit and think about it for a minute but fortunately the example which you said wouldn't happen. In theory if it did it would cause the aluminum to rupture and the air would escape through the rupture aluminum very much as it would if the tank was punctured."

paintball,3d861u,IAmTheFatman666,6,Tue Jul 14 13:04:41 2015 UTC,"Hi Tony!  I am in my mid 30s and have two kids of my own (granted they are about half your age).  Being what your mom said sounds like something my wife would say so I think I have a good perspective on this.  Let me start by giving you what you want:  Football is infinitely more violent than paintball and far more dangerous on a short term and a long term scale.  It is way more aggressive since you are physically hitting someone else as part of the game.  I believe she has a misconception on what Football and Paintball really is like as a player.  I'm guessing she has played neither and is basing her decision on the fact one is on TV and the other uses ""guns"".  The fear of you learning how to use a gun and possibly translating to a real gun is what she is more scared of.  And that's a real legitimate concern.  Let me go into the safety aspects and compare football with paintball.  The whole basis of football is built around two bodies slamming into each other at high rates of speed.  There will be bruise and sprains as a result of this.  Paintball is built around a tiny ball busting paint over you.  This will also result in bruising, but it will be much smaller and there won't be the sprains behind it.  Both teach teamwork, strategy and involve skills to play well.  Long term injuries from football typically deal with issues with the legs require surgery and such.  ACLs Tendinitis, things like that.  It is common and well known that players get life long injuries from playing football due to the constant and massive collisions.  The amount of protective gear... helmets and pads and such should be the red flag for the danger involved.    I found this page to illustrate injuries in paintball.  Keep in mind it's an article from 2011.   There were no cases in the literature in which a patient sustained an ocular injury while wearing a mask approved by the ASTM. Most participants experienced ocular injury when masks were not worn or when masks were removed temporarily because of paint or fogging. There are a few case reports of paintballs dislodging masks or the paintball traveling under goggles. The patients in these reports did not wear a mask approved by the ASTM for paintball games.   Typically paintball wouldn't have many long term injuries on that scale so long as you wear your god damn mask!  Excluding the Injuries from not wearing a mask, it's literally a dozen or so injuries due to paintball with MILLIONS of people playing.  Compare that with this and you'll see the argument for playing paintball for being less violent and safer is pretty strong.  Other injuries (twisted ankles, sprained muscles and such) seem more on par with injuries that could occur during any sport.  Cool.  Paintball is probably safer than football.  But with all of that said you may not realize it, but your mom might have other reasons she doesn't want you to play paintball.  I already mentioned the training on using an actual firearm.  Secondly it's STUPID expensive.  You may not realize how much it costs to actually play, but my estimate is for the cost of a new mask and marker, she could pay for a whole season of football which would last a few months.  She probably isn't' comfortable to just drop you off at a field alone (or even if you are with friends) where she has no idea who is there to watch the kids or be ""in charge"".  At football, it's going to be coaches and assistants and other parents looking on.  It's a billion times more organized and the adults involved will most likely have background checks.  In short, she knows you aren't going to be kidnapped or taken advantage of.  She certainly doesn't want to sit around a paintball field and wait there while you play where as at football practice/games there will be a group of parents that she'll be able to hang out with while you are off having fun.  I have two questions for you.  Do you have an adult male figure in your life?  Dad?  Uncle?  Neighbor?  Big Brother?  Friend's Dad?  Something like that?  Perhaps she'd be more comfortable if you played with someone you trusted like that.    Have you ever been shot by a paintball?  12 years old, is kinda borderline/grey area on the young side of someone playing.  You might find you don't like the way it feels when you are hit and you might want to try something else.  You don't know unless you have been shot at last once.  I'd hate to see you go on the field the first time not knowing what it feels like and have the other team light you up."
paintball,3d861u,UselessGadget,2,Tue Jul 14 13:26:51 2015 UTC,"She probably isn't' comfortable to just drop you off at a field alone (or even if you are with friends) where she has no idea who is there to watch the kids or be ""in charge"". At football, it's going to be coaches and assistants and other parents looking on. It's a billion times more organized and the adults involved will most likely have background checks. In short, she knows you aren't going to be kidnapped or taken advantage of. She certainly doesn't want to sit around a paintball field and wait there while you play where as at football practice/games there will be a group of parents that she'll be able to hang out with while you are off having fun.   ^ Good point and area for discussion.   (We) Parents have lives too and things we want or need to do. 2 hours at a football practice is a lot of time. A half day of a Saturday waiting in a parking lot, or 'Parents lounge' is probably not appealing.  And as /u/UselessGadget says - there is the concern for your safety, in just dropping you at some field. There's a lot of creepers around - so this is a legit concern that you mom might have Tony."

The firepower was definitely ramping up but I never let that deter me, with my trusty tippmann 98 I could take on the world as far as I was concerned.

paintball,3d861u,socks86,2,Tue Jul 14 14:30:08 2015 UTC,Thank you for your answer. My mom I's divorced and I sometimes see my dad. I have a 19 old brother but he doesn't care at all. My friend plays paintball and i want to join his team. Me and him are best friends.  About the money. I started saving for paintball 2 years ago.Currently i have enough money to buy everything i need.
paintball,3d861u,SlidePanda,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:59:29 2015 UTC,"Currently i have enough money to buy everything i need.   The - reoccurring costs are what can get you.    You mention a team - so are you looking to play tournament style - speed ball etc etc?  If so you're going to be shooting a lot of paint - cases of it. Prices per case vary - but you're looking $40-50 a case or more if you're getting the high end stuff for competitions vs practice.  One path to consider is Pump. Play is a bit different, since there's no 'ropes' of paint. But games are still fast paced and you're not going through massive amounts of paint... just a bunch"
paintball,3d861u,UselessGadget,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:12:23 2015 UTC,"I think this comes down to having and adult to take you that your mom is comfortable with first and for most.  How does your friend go play?  Who takes him?  I gotta tell ya, when I was 16 and had a part time job and only had to pay for gas in my car.  I bought my own equipment and I still couldn't afford to play every week.  Even now as an adult with a full time job, I don't think there is room in my budget to play that much.  What are your field fees?  What does paint cost?  Is it field paint only?  I'm not sure how much money you have saved, but I will guarantee it is not enough.  There will always be something to suck your wallet dry."

paintball,3d861u,ImperiumOfMankind,2,Wed Jul 15 04:34:32 2015 UTC,"Discussion points for Tony v Mom   Paintball - be it Speed ball or woods, depends on team work and individual initiative too as does football - that's a push Paintball is not war, it is a game. Yes, there are ""guns"" but football has armor which was used for war - very bloody ugly war for many many centuries The injury rate in Football, especially concussions, vastly out reaches that of paintball. I played Rugby for many years. As a result I have had dislocations, a broken hand, a couple sprains that required a short term on crutches, a fractured nose, 15 stitches in my face, many cuts, grass burns and bruises.... from Paintball, many bruises, and a couple surface cuts. paintball... way safer on the body. Football teaches aggression. A lot of football culture teaches aggression and fosters bad behavior.  It's part of the sport unfortunetly. She's ignoring that fact. Lets looks at how many NFL and college players have been arrested for fight, beating wives/girlfirends... hell the New (ex) Seminonles QB just got dumped after punching a woman in the face on camera. Of course, Pro PB players don't get much media attention. But no part of any practice for PB I ever was at talked about physically beating an opponent, hitting them, hurting them, making them cry etc etc. Aggressive competition is part of Football culture. Though there can be plenty of smack talk around Paintball, usually after games people are plenty happy to sit and swap stories regardless of the team played for during the day. There are plenty of good actors in football, but there is a notably large segment that has an unhealthy culture. PB can teach skills in other areas. I've learned about pneumatics, how to take care of the machines I use as part of the game, how regulators work and more. Football will not teach you how to diagnose and trouble shoot a complex machine.   Ultimately, you're 12 and have to abide your parents decisions - at least the prohibition on Paintball. But if you can engage them in an adult discussion - you might win your case. Though! don't go in with the expectation that your mom will discuss the matter in an adult manner. If she has an emotion based opinion of PB (and it sounds like she does) it will be hard for her to discuss the matter logically.  Good luck. Update us on your efforts!"
paintball,3d861u,SlidePanda,2,Tue Jul 14 12:21:09 2015 UTC,"I don't wanna start an arguement but I just wanna add, I don't think it's the sport that makes football players do things like hit their wives. Maybe a little bit, but I think it's more of things like how inflated their ego gets and the fame going to their head.  Loved everything else though."
paintball,3d861u,villa9122,2,Wed Jul 15 01:19:09 2015 UTC,"No argument from me. Perhaps I wasn't clear.   I don't think it's the sport of football - it's the culture of it in many places that ignores or allows such bad behavior. Of course there are plenty of counter examples where football teams are encouraged to, and do many good deeds. But football has more tha it's fair share of bad culture it seems"

The outer, upper part of the feedneck is definitely a separate piece from the body, there's a small gap underneath and the coloring is slightly different. I guess the only question now is if it's pressed on or threaded?  Probably take it to my airsmith tomorrow and let him check it out, it definitely needs some TLC, but I kind of expected that for the price I paid."

Tank: Ninja 45/45 or 45/68 (the 68 is standard but I still like my 45/45 to stay tighter)  Buy new so you get max life out of the tank  Marker: Try not to spend more than $400 here because getting a new tank and mask will be about $200 - $250.  I would suggest an older Ego / Geo.  Maybe even an Etek.  Don't get an etha.  Pod pack: This is really up to you, they all work basically the same.  HK Army, GI Sports, Bunker Kings, etc.  Misc: You will probably want paintball pants also.  They will save your knees and allow you to slide much easier.  If you decide to spend more money, get elbow pads too from planet eclipse or exalt.  They will give you bounces, protect you on slides, and make sliding even easier."

I've heard really good things about that gun. Most people say it's the best starter gun. I started off with a kaos and it was great for what it was. It did chop paint a few times within the first two time I went out with it. Yeah that sucks in the middle of the game, but it really taught me a lot on how to take care of my markers. Also it's fairly cheap so if anything really bad happened to it, it really wasn't a huge deal. Hope that helps!"

I'm guessing either its out of date (needs hydrotesting) or your local shop doesn't do HPA fills. if its out of date bring it to a scuba shop if you have one local and see if they can retest it for you, if its just that he couldn't do HPA fills then the scuba shop should be able to fill it there. as a side note HPA is the most reliable and efficient air source for PB but A5s are sometimes picky about working with it, mine and some others don't like HPA while a few others in our group run really well on it."

There's plenty of places that can do that certification just search for ""hpa hydro testing"". That returns a lot of PB related stuff - but places that deal with SCUBA and SCBA (commonly fire fighting gear) tanks are also viable options and you may have one locally.

paintball,3d9u5m,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jul 14 19:02:04 2015 UTC,"TIL about the Miata's racing pedigree.  But.... Weekend cone dodging and small or even regional races are equivalent of divisional level paintball.    Racing may not be the best analogy, because paintball has one (formerly two) major series, whereas auto racing has many different types, like Formula 1, nascar, and rally.  Each of those cars would lose when taken out of their element... But paintball is different in that one unmodified marker can be used effectively across all competitive platforms.  Additionally, the subject of money comes in.  If I could race in a Ferrari 458 Italia, I would... But I don't have enough money.  I'd bet it's the same for most Miata owners.... And there is no big ""any budget allowed"" racing series outside of those extremely specialized racing series.  The Miata isn't so popular because of performance, it's popular because people can afford it.  In paintball, however, there is no price problem, and there is no environment difference, and there's a very limited number of high-level tournaments... So the choice becomes extremely narrow."

The only thing that would stop you from doing it yourself is probably the o-rings (and technical ability).  You can get o-ring kits online (third party on eBay/Amazon assuming there's not an official Spyder kit out there), and the wrenches are usually standard sizes.  What you're paying the shop for is those items, labor, and  for the experience/equipment."

You need to learn how to do everything yourself, because you will eventually need to fix something yourself out on the field.  You should feel comfortable taking everything apart and putting it back together, replacing all the o-rings, lubing the marker.  That is really all you need to do."

paintball,3d49kp,JGdirtyWHITE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:04:34 2015 UTC,Have you tried calling DP support? They actually do a pretty good job now.     Only thing I can think of doing is reinstalling the original components (defective ones) and testing them with both pairs of eyes and doing a factory reset of the board.
paintball,3d49kp,Bumblemore,2,Mon Jul 13 14:30:00 2015 UTC,"I've put the old solenoid with the new eyes with the old battery harness vise versa vise versa vise versa, I think my best bet is to try new solenoid new eyes new battery harness because I'm getting the same results now. At first the new eyes worked, then I aired up and loaded the hopper and nothing happened after a trigger pull. So I de-gased and took it apart again this is when the problem with the eyes became appearent to me. Again, new set of eyes and old set giving same results with both new and old solenoid and both new and old battery harness with two brands of fresh 9v battery. And again, I unplug the eye wire harness and it becomes functional again. Except that eyes are a MUST with this gun you can half ass anything or it will breach more than one ball and break a ton of paint. I also can't navigate my board, because the screen is completely off not dimmed but off, I've considered the possibility that I've accidentally turned the brightness down to zero meaning I need to find a blind manual to navigate the board without the OLED like a step by step. I'll try turning the eyes on and off and try unplugged and plugged again when I'm home. Also yea the DP reps are quick and responsive but the dude I talked to didn't seen too adept I mean he was stuttering and not sure of himself when I asked about the board itself maybe having a short somewhere between the terminal- eye plug."

Funny thing at least two of the people that did not show up will be complaining that they are not on a line for the event (don't show up to practice, don't play). On the flip side, I have people that have been coming to practice, and they will not get to play either because I don't have enough for the second line."
paintball,3d380u,orangetoaster,1 point,Mon Jul 13 04:13:24 2015 UTC,2013 was one of the best years for me in recent memory. We had 10+ teams at the field every sunday for fat scrimmages. Now... not so much. We may get 10 guys all together to form rag tag lines.
paintball,3d380u,cptzanzibar,2,Mon Jul 13 12:35:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that this is more fun and better practice than showing up with a usual group/team. Being forced to play with people you don't know/different skill sets forces you to play differently than how you usually would, based on the situation at hand. I'm a snake/snake insert player, but nobody wants to play d side? I'll play d side. I'm not the best on that side of the field, but any reps is only gonna make you more field aware and a better all around player. Sure, it can be frustrating, but at the same time it's pushing your skill level as well.   Some of the best players I've met and played with have been purely streetballers, which is how I try to approach any day I play. Adapt, improvise, and have fun with it."
paintball,3d380u,HerroYerroPanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:52:46 2015 UTC,"I can only slightly agree with the situation we have. Were talking 2 lines that play against each other all day. Playing with other people sometimes is good, but if youre trying to practice with your team, and create team dynamics, you cant just play with randos and expect that to happen. Knowing peoples strengths and weaknesses, their tendencies, and how they play their best is 50% of a winning team. The other 40% is communication, the last 10% is actually playing. Im all for random line playing, its a lot of fun, just not the best when trying to build a highly cohesive team."
paintball,3d380u,cptzanzibar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:57:58 2015 UTC,"I think my view may be skewed from yours since I'm not on an actual team. I don't feel like dealing with bullshit politics that so often finds its way into paintball/don't have much time to play, so I just run with whoever needs an extra body/put together a line to go against the actual team that shows up. However, I completely agree with everything you said that makes a successful team - I've put enough work in with teams to respect that time and effort that goes into it.  Being a free agent, or playing on a ragtag line also has its benefits since I can play upper level players (I'm unranked, but play d4/d3 guys), and do fun things that you wouldn't normally see from an ""organized"" team, like cheat up to the 50 off break, or run down the tape when you already have a guy in snake.  At the end of the day though, regardless of approach to playing, we're all there for the same thing. I think we can both agree though that it's a shame more people aren't coming out"

paintball,3d3hrv,TheMoggle,2,Mon Jul 13 06:54:49 2015 UTC,"Know what your strengths and weakness are. Do not hesistate to bump up when you feel its a good time. If you can run up on someone and you get the gut feeling, you do it. Communication is key so always yell out constantly where they are s1,center 50, temple, mini race. Know field positions and bunker names so you can communicate effectively. call out your kill shots. Also have fun and get pumped up!! and STRETCH!!!!"
paintball,3d3hrv,imanAholebutimfunny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:58:04 2015 UTC,"This is all good advice. I'd like to expand on the topic of bumping up. If you see a side open up (as in, your opponents' dorito or snake side get completely shot out), then capitalize on it by sending somebody running down that tape line. In a good number of situations, you want your runner to race to the corner so you can turn the field.  I've seen a lot of teams throw away their body count advantage because they failed to do this. It does your team no good to sit tight and gun fight in that same bunker if you have an opportunity to run up to a better bunker which allows you to shoot opponents in the side, or even in the back."

paintball,3d2tcm,TheAmazingLeech,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:59:35 2015 UTC,"Well is there a semi auto gun for about that price that's decent? I'm not a super hard core player but I go maybe 1-2 times a week, and my current gun just isn't really doing it for me any more. I guess I'm just looking to upgrade"
paintball,3d2tcm,AndrewTheWookiee,3,Mon Jul 13 02:09:31 2015 UTC,"At that price point my favorite option is the Gog enmey. Because it's not a blowback, it's much lighter and is much more reliable in my experience. It also has the benefit of the whole cycle being dependent on the trigger which means the gun resets when you release the trigger if you run into a hiccup, rather than a blowback where you would have to manually re-cock the gun if it got a hiccup.  tl;dr - Gog enmey is lighter, smoother, more reliable.  Like he mentioned though, if you want an electro worthy of your money there aren't really any good options for $150 or less unless you buy a much older used gun."
paintball,3d2tcm,AndrewTheWookiee,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:17:52 2015 UTC,"Just checked out the GoG enmey on ans gear and that sounds like it might be the one. It's got pretty much everything I'm looking for and its a decent price.  Is it accurate? Because right now my gun shoots paintballs all over the place, some go up, some go down, and some swirl around. Or is that just the shitty paintballs I buy?"
paintball,3d2tcm,socks86,4,Mon Jul 13 02:33:15 2015 UTC,That's going to be the paint's fault. Bad paint will shoot bad no matter how much money you put into the gear.
paintball,3d2tcm,Aidspanda,1 point,Mon Jul 13 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"Shitty paint and/or your gun is dirty. The barrel, breech/chamber area, and bolt should be pretty much spotlessly clean."
paintball,3d2tcm,socks86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:33:35 2015 UTC,"So I take it it's not my guns fault but the paint I'm buying? I just buy 2000 from Walmart and use that until I run out. Thinking about it now that seems like a bad idea because it can get hot, squishy etc over time. Especially since I live in Florida. So when I'm out in the field how do I keep it from going bad? Also where's a good place to buy decent paintballs?"
paintball,3d2tcm,mazu747,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:15:13 2015 UTC,"Local shops will be your best bet for buying paint. Walmart is just about the worst option. I've had hit or miss luck ordering paint online, but it's almost always based on how far it's being shipped from. Amazon.com is a good place since their return policy is very good."
paintball,3d2tcm,Averageboi,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:25:05 2015 UTC,Obviously a spyder isn't the most high performance gun out there but they work just fine. If your gun is dirty and you use crappy paint you're going to have these problems no matter what gun you have.  Try to support your local fields and stores or they wont be around much longer man. Walmart does nothing for our cause and the paint there is usually shit + stored improperly.  Keep it in a cooler preferably in the shade when you're at the field. Store it somewhere cool and dry when you're at home and rotate it periodically so the balls dont deform.
paintball,3d2tcm,zorro1589,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:58:30 2015 UTC,"GoG eNMEy is a great mech marker, but if you want an electro, go for an older ION or Invert Mini (both used). Both markers are badass and you can't go wrong with them, even used.  Or if you want some real fun and a plethora of customization, look into a used Autococker, you can turn those things into pretty much whatever you want. Shot quality? Go for it. Want some good efficiency? Hell yeah, do it! Want to change the bolt style, knock yourself out. Getting sick of how it looks? You can change that too.

paintball,3d2h8l,Sir_Poo,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:12:20 2015 UTC,"Used is the way to go. But if you want new, get yourself a nice mask first. E-Flex is great! GOG ENMEY with a HPA tank and a proto hopper and you're set to go!"
paintball,3d2h8l,lordhoekage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:14:30 2015 UTC,Jt-spectra are also great masks to and relatively cheap
paintball,3d2h8l,zorro1589,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:09:34 2015 UTC,"Try out some goggles and see what you like best. My recommendations are the JT proflex, empire E-flex, dye i4 in no particular order  You will want an HPA tank. With your budget you should be able to get a 4500psi tank no problem. Don't get the heavy steel 3000psi tanks if at all possible.  I will second the gog enmey. You smooth, quiet shooter that wont chop paint, so you can use a gravity feed loader. You can get a proto primo for about $15.  I like dye and nxe for pod packs."
paintball,3d2h8l,socks86,1 point,Mon Jul 13 11:32:51 2015 UTC,"for 350. i would get a rotor, 45 68 cf tank, i4s and a invert mini. mini 150ish. i4s 70ish, tank 50 ish, rotor 85 ish. came to 355."
paintball,3d2h8l,imanAholebutimfunny,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:04:34 2015 UTC,"The first and most important thing you should focus on getting is a quality mask. After all, you won't be able to shoot anything if you can't see it because of the fog on your lens.  My recomendations (in order)   Vforce Profiler $60- best for people with glasses JT Proflex $55 Vforce Grills $75   Go to a local shop and try on some masks before purchasing.  The second most important piece of equipment is your gun.   The gun depends widely on what type of paintball you're trying to play. Since you mentioned playing woodsball, I'll list some quality beginner woodsball markers that are sure to stand the test of time.   Tippmann A-5  $170 - Great woodsball marker with a cyclone feed hopper that has been a staple of woods play for years. Spyder MR100 Pro  $90 - Spyder has been a trusted name in lower end markers for years. It's a great intro marker that will get the job done. Tippmann 98 custom  $110 - This marker is most often the first marker that new players either play with, or purchase. It is durable, ergonomic, and has a ton of aftermarket parts available to it for endless customization.   The tank and hopper depend on the gun you decide to get.  These are my tips to you.  For reference, I am a 13 year paintball veteran who has played up to division 3 in PSP and NPPL.   Feel free to message me if you have any questions."
paintball,3d2dg3,Spookies_,2,Sun Jul 12 23:39:48 2015 UTC,"With budget of $120, get a Helix mask ($30). Worry about your mask first about anything else. Thermal/dual pane lens is the way to go."

paintball,3d2dg3,lordhoekage,2,Sun Jul 12 23:59:01 2015 UTC,"Gun wise. There is only two types. .68 (regular paintbal) and .50 (kid paintball if you can say).   A setup that is good for a beginner although it is passing your budget is.   • GOG EnMey ($150 new) •Aluminum HPA Tank ($30-50) •Proto Hopper ($15) • Empire Helix Mask ($30) try to get a better mask like an e-flex, proflex, etc. you'll feel the difference but the helix is fine for starting.

paintball,3d2dg3,lordhoekage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"Tippmann's are workhorses and will probably never break down on you internally, but they're usually clunky, heavy, and are harsh on paint.  Most of the Tippmann starter markers have basically the same internals with different shells."
paintball,3d2dg3,lordhoekage,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:25:48 2015 UTC,Are there any cheeper guns you can recommend? Weight doesn't really matter to me. I like how small and sleek the cyclone hopper can I use it with these guns.
paintball,3d2dg3,cptzanzibar,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:28:03 2015 UTC,"Whatever you do, don't get a cyclone. I did that too for my Salvo, worst mistake ever. You're bigger of a target and it's a AIRHOG to the max. You're better off purchasing a decent electric hopper althought you need it because you're getting a mech. As someone said, with a budget of $120, you're better off buying a mask and renting. Alternatively, you can save more and purchase all your gear together!"

This is pretty much impossible unless you fluke out on craigslist or kijiji. Your budget just isn't good enough to get what you need. Buy a mask that won't fog and rent until you can afford more."
paintball,3d23m3,Whiskylimabravo,2,Sun Jul 12 22:17:49 2015 UTC,"I like DP guns, but they are definitely NOT the best starting markers. Not sure about the E1, but the G series was especially finicky. Plagued with some problems such as bolt stick, O-rings busting constantly, etc. I feel like you should go with something that's more proven in the field, that won't require you to constantly have to worry about whether or not the marker will give you problems during a day of play.   Some constantly suggested markers are the Etek series and the Etha, both by Planet Eclipse or the Empire Axe or Mini. Depending on your budget I'm sure most of the other guys on this sub will be able to recommend something.  Judging by your starting marker and how long ago it has been since you've played, I'm going to assume you used a CO2 tank. You're going to want to get yourself an HPA (High-Pressure Air) tank as CO2 can damage your gun's internals.   You're also going to want to get an electronic/force-feed hopper. This will both ensure your gun will always have a ball in the breach and will allow you to sustain a higher rate of fire.  Also, you may want to replace your lens, or mask entirely. It's better to be safe than sorry."
paintball,3d23m3,nZcastillo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:11:03 2015 UTC,"I have heard mixed reviews about the DP markers.Thats why I turned here. Honestly for $189, its hard to pass up. I have been looking at the Etha, and some 2011 Proto rail markers as well. But just cant justify the cost with how little I've been playing. I want to break back into the sport but don't know how realistic me playing every week again is. First thing I bought getting back into it was a SLY profit. Gotta protect the eyes, and a Ninja HPA tank. I just discovered that my 12 year old Custom is not going to keep up with who I am playing with, and Its not worth it to put in a E-trigger due to the age. If I can justify it I will step up to a Bob-long or a Empire brand. I was just wondering if anyone had first hand experience with the DP brand. Admittedly, the most crushing moment for me coming back to the game, was discovering that WGP/Auto-Cocker is no longer in business; that was always my dream gun."
paintball,3d23m3,nZcastillo,2,Mon Jul 13 00:56:31 2015 UTC,"I can see where you're coming from in terms of cost, but for that price or maybe about $50 more you could probably snag yourself a nice Axe or Mini GS, which will do you a LOT better in the long run. Plus KEE has some great CS support. DP is slowing rebuilding their reputation in the paintball world, but they are still miles away from the larger paintball manufacturers."
paintball,3d23m3,LordofthePuppies,2,Mon Jul 13 02:02:42 2015 UTC,"I bought a 2011 reflex rail for $185, and it shoots great, I would definitely check out the used market before making a decision on something new."
paintball,3d23m3,mazu747,2,Mon Jul 13 05:16:17 2015 UTC,"My friend has one. It blows, forget the awkward trigger, ergonomics (seriously, they put the goddamn macroline on the wrong side so it feels weird unless you're left handed, there's no excuse for that one, I don't care how cheap it is), the horrible inefficiency, shitty battery compartment... that's what you get for $180.  It doesn't work. We sent it to a shop, the guy turned it into his own little DIY project to make it work and not leak. We can't even screw the air tank all the way in for it to work after he did some work on it. He threw and o-ring into the ASA and did something else to it that I forgot to make it work right. Also did something to the reg (hey man, it's not my marker so I didn't keep tabs on it :p) so it finally started shooting.  Used Mini's or Ion's would be a much much safer bet."
paintball,3d23m3,imanAholebutimfunny,2,Mon Jul 13 03:01:51 2015 UTC,Personally i would choose the invert mini to be your next option. Lots of available upgrades and this marker will hold you over for a number of years until you upgrade to an axe or better. Owned and fixed many invert minis and owned 25+ guns.

paintball,3d27jc,SlidePanda,2,Sun Jul 12 23:19:54 2015 UTC,"/u/Buwaro and /u/mikekarmawhore have it pretty much down. I'll add a relevant story.  So I started playing ~10-11 years back. While some of my friends were interested in coming out 1-2x per year I had no regular playing buddies. But, I just kept going to the same field.  It was a busy place, lots of rentals etc - but it became clear after a bit that there were a number of other pretty regulars like me sowing up regularly. Singletons, a couple father-son duos a couple buddies etc. Ages ranged from early adolescents to well old enough to be that kids grand dad, in his early 60s I figure, and everything in between.   So we started talking between games - though I can't recall who initiated it. But once the ice was broken at all it was easy enough, at that point, to say - ""Hey, I see that (those) guys here regularly too. Lets go chat with them (as well).""   Pretty soon, the group at large was around 20. Half to 2/3rds of that would be there on any given weekend. But even when it was only a few of us it was still a good group.  So in short - just get back out there. Show up regularly and keep a little mental note of the faces you see on multiple occasions. You'll probably have to introduce yourself. But you've got a good back story, that many adult players will resonate with: ""Haven't played in X years, all the folks I played with are lame/fat/lazy/etc. I've seen you guys a few times, you regulars here?""  And I'll bet you'll have some new play buddies in fairly short order."

paintball,3d1zt4,GooeyPod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:07 2015 UTC,The hammer 7 and Spyders in general have sketchy feed with FSRs. Is your magazine rusted? That frequently causes feed issues.

paintball,3d1zt4,HELP_IM_ON_FIRE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:58:06 2015 UTC,"The breech liner is the part that the barrel screws into, and it's what you rotate to change from hopper to magazine and vice versa. If you damage (Like, you dent it or accidentally bend a piece inward) that would cause First Strikes to be unable to feed. That's difficult to do though, and very unlikely.  I think another possibility would be a detent is further back than it should be for one reason or another, leading to first strikes being unable to clear it and when the occasional paintball DOES clear it, it leaves the first set of detents altogether allowing it to move forward and more paintballs to enter the breech.  I haven't really encountered a similar problem myself though, but from individual pieces of your problem featuring in friends' markers, I think it's much more likely to be a combination of a broken detent (leading to multiple balls feeding) and a damaged magazine (leading to issues feeding paint/not feeding first strikes)."

paintball,3d2kz7,Claclink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:16:46 2015 UTC,No it doesn't.  Paint consistency and bore/paint match are the only things that matter.  A paintball barrel is just a tube.  Anything made in the last 15 years is smooth enough and round enough it doesn't make a difference.    https://www.reddit.com/r/paintball/comments/1ii2yh/  http://www.pbnation.com/showthread.php?t=2218018#/forumsite/20793/topics/2218018
paintball,3d2kz7,Egobeliever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:35:44 2015 UTC,the paint/bore match .... is the barrel.  Barrels make a difference and are the most important and only controllable variable
paintball,3d2kz7,Claclink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:52:14 2015 UTC,"Paint quality is the most important factor.  But i agree the paint/barrel match does affect it somewhat.  My initial post was meant to imply that one barrel is not more accurate than another, assuming you buy the right size paint."
paintball,3d2kz7,Egobeliever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:59:00 2015 UTC,"paint quality is not a controllable variable.  You cant "" buy the right paint size "" unless they allow you to open and bore match before you buy.  And yes some barrels are more accurate, after usuage, bk the quality of the polish determines how long the polish lasts."
paintball,3d2kz7,Claclink,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:03:10 2015 UTC,"Paint quality is a variable unless you are playing at a FPO field and even then they typically have 2 grades of paint you can buy.  And you can use Google to look up the bore size of any good quality paint.  The micropolishing they do on the inside of the barrel is not some kind magic coating they put inside the barrel.  It is tiny beads that grind the surface smooth.  I've never heard of a barrel being worn out or needing to replaced over time.  Go on any BST thread or forum where someone is selling used barrels.  No one asks about inner bore wear.  Any barrel with annodizing will wear off but it doesn't affect the performance of a barrel.  Find one person on the internet who claims their barrel no longer shoots accurately because the annodizing on the inside of their barrel wore off.  And even if it did affect your shot, no one mentions this in any review and you have no idea if your $100 barrel is going to last longer than your stock barrel."
paintball,3d2kz7,Egobeliever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:28:37 2015 UTC,"you cannot google paint size.  It varies batch to batch.    Never said it was a magic coating, i know how polishing works.  If the coefficient of friction is not the same throughout the barrel, it doesn't shoot the same.  This is very hard to do and does not happen quickly, thats why you dont hear anyone talk about it.  That being said the tolerance of the barrel is MUCH tighter than the paint, which varies quite a bit."

Take it out to a field and use their chrono, dial in your pressure adjustments accordingly, ask for help.

paintball,3d2kz7,JGdirtyWHITE,1 point,Mon Jul 13 12:14:49 2015 UTC,you DO NOT overbore for accuracy
paintball,3d2kz7,Egobeliever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:15:29 2015 UTC,"PBN and PBtech forums aswell as basic physics all saying tht slight overbore will give better ball for ball accuracy. Want a source? Too bad it's literally Newtonian fundamentals. Ball to bore match means that a paintball fits snug in barrel which will cause friction on the balls way down the barrel. This can not only cause the ball to have more spin but even elongate the ball atleast until it leaves the barrel. You're going to have a wider spread shooting ball to bore. You may get a shot with more travel time vs hangtime and downfall but that's irrelevant on the paintball field if you get better ball for ball accuracy.  Overbore, on the other hand allows air to travel both behind the ball as well as a better barrier around the ball. This will result in less friction and less spin. To put it in a visual aspect, imagine a .685 paintba shooting from a .689 barrel the same air pushing the ball down the barrel is going to act like a barrel insert made entirely of HPA, the ball will not drag on theower part of the barrel on te way out because that air is going to counter the forces of gravity until the ball leaves the barrel. Should you shoot .680 from a .695? No you're going to get counter productive results from that. Slightly overbore is going to give the best accuracy and still remain gas efficient."

paintball,3czdb7,jbende,4,Sun Jul 12 04:02:16 2015 UTC,First thing you should ever buy is a high end thermal mask. There's a plethora of them and generally anything over 70 dollars will be good. You want a dual pane lense. Do not skimp on the mask. You want the right one for you. This of course means going to your local proshop and trying them on. Only you can decide what mask is right for you and there is a billion head shapes so what fits you is unique to yourself.   Also buying used is highly recommended. Unless you never clean or maintain it it should never have any major breakdowns.
paintball,3czdb7,StockClassCanadian,2,Sun Jul 12 05:33:53 2015 UTC,"Another +1 for the good mask camp as a first buy. Even if it means renting a few more times invest your cash in that nice mask.   All the other gear one can buy is rendered useless when your cheapest mask on the market has fogged so badly you cannot see more than 5 feet  For me another good early buy would be some knee pads. They have saved me a lot of pain and bodily wear.   Beyond that, recommendations will start to factor in what style you want to play. Recball, go out play whatever games are going on at the field... Do you want to get into tournament/speed ball? Pump? Mil-sim? Etc there's a bunch of different sub genre that can impact your selection criteria. But pretty much any gear can be used for any style - unless there's some rules against. For example can't use a semi or full auto in Pump Only games"
paintball,3czdb7,SlidePanda,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:53:23 2015 UTC,volleyball knee pads are usually 10 - 20 $ online ( or at dicks/Sports auth.etc )  and work just as well as the 65$ paintball ones.
paintball,3czdb7,Egobeliever,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:22:04 2015 UTC,"Couldn't agree with this more. I well fitting mask is amazing and a good lenses makes a world or difference. Also, clean your mask as much as possible."

paintball,3czdb7,Spookies_,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"as gear quality improves and prices come down, some fields have thermal masks as rentals.  This improves the quality of their product tremendously... as rentals can actually see and have a good time."
paintball,3czdb7,Egobeliever,3,Mon Jul 13 22:23:06 2015 UTC,"Like others mentioned and Mike from techpb but put in order with less chit-chat. 1. Thermal Mask- You're responsible for you quality of vision and safety. 2. Electric Loader- Put the horse in front of the cart. Get that high rate of fire so you don't chop paint regardless of rental or high-end marker. 3. 68ci 4500psi HPA Tank- Now you can monitor your air level and not freeze up your marker when you shoot fast. 4. Then worry about the Marker. Your mask, loader, & tank can move to any setup you want to get. You won't be that noob shooting a $300+ market with a gravity feed hopper and CO2 which will damage your new marker.  Think of it like getting a car. First you need a loan, insurance, & then the car. If you have the loan and insurance you can pretty much get any car you want. Same goes for paintball."
paintball,3czdb7,JMWPainter,1 point,Sun Jul 12 11:46:20 2015 UTC,price range?
paintball,3czdb7,bobwolts,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:10:45 2015 UTC,"Old post I wrote up answering similar question.   Mask - A bad mask will ruin your day between fogging, being uncomfortable, or not fitting. The best way to find the mask for you is to try some on. Go to your local pro shop (if there is one) and ask to try on mask to find the best for you. Regardless of what you choose, be sure it's a thermal lens (dual-pane) to reduce/eliminate any chances of fogging. Hi-end: I4, VIO, Grillz, KLR, Eflex ($100+ New) Mid: Events, Profilers, Proflex, MI-9($50+ New) Tank - This is something that will need to last you a long time and is the most dangerous part of your setup. You have the option of a pure aluminum tank or a carbon fiber wrapped tank. Aluminum tanks are heavier and generally only hold 3000psi. CF wrapped tanks are lighter and usually go up to 4500psi, meaning more shots for the same volume. If you go used, make sure the tank is within its hydro qualification date. This tells you whether the tank is safe to use. Fields are not legally allowed to air up tanks that are out of hydro. CF: $100+ depending on brand, 15 year life span Aluminum: $30+ depending on brand/size, unlimited life span so long as it passes hydro. Marker - Now we get to the marker. The price range you listed can get you a good mechanical marker, a low-end electronic (used), or a decent beginner pump. So mechs are similar to your Tippmann 98. One trigger pull for 1 shot and is capable of semi-automatic fire. Pump markers are cock it and shot. One cocking stroke loads one ball into the breech for fire. Rinse and repeat. Electros use a board and a solenoid to fire. They are capable of semi-automic, ramping, and full automatic. Basically they allow you to lay down more paint. So here's a list of USED markers in your price range (not all-inclusive). Pump: Empire/PMI Traccer, Azodin Kaos Pump (not KP3) Mech: GoG Enmey, Azodin Kaos, Tippmann 98, Tippmann A5, Gryphon Electro: Azodin Blitz, Blitz Evo, Smart Parts Ion, GoG Extcy Loader - This will determine whether you will be able to shoot or not. There are force-fed and gravity loaders. Force-fed are of course faster using some type of motor to drive paintballs into the breech. Gravity loaders use gravity to drop the ball into the breech. Force-fed are more expensive but more consistent in feeding than gravity. There are agitation type loaders but I'm just going to ignore those. Force-fed: Spire, TFX, Rotor, Z2, Halo, Vmaxx (listed hi to low $) Gravity: Proto Primo (only one worth getting unless you're into pump and that's another beast) Basic Maintenance - Barrel swab/squeegee (Barrel maid), Lube/grease if you don't have any, Quality batteries (very important if you get force-fed or electro), Microfiber cloth for mask lens   If I missed anything or said something wrong, please correct me so I can change it on this post.

I never even said a thing to him - I just called hit and walked off.   It was a big scenario and we were the last 2 defenders stuck in a 3-man tower on a hill, surrounded by dozens (hundreds?) of enemy scenario ballers on ramp and full-auto who were out for blood because we had been ass-fucking them from up there for like almost a hour and they wanted that tower back.

Be warned, me and my brother usually go through about 2000 each depending on the day with no speedball, they charge 70$ per friggin case which is ridiculous to me but they have a 15 or 20$ bring your own paint charge, might be worth it if your a ""poweruser"".

If there is a rule at the field or an agreement between the players not to then its prohibited.

paintball,3cycok,socks86,8,Sat Jul 11 23:24:48 2015 UTC,I've done the gun/ammo swap mid game before. I don't see the issue. Pretty sure you can toss a pod to your teammate in a tournament.   Yelling out your position is kinda shitty but it's just something I expect in rec games with kids and parents.

paintball,3cycok,BurningPlaydoh,3,Sat Jul 11 22:15:33 2015 UTC,Who cares? Its recball. Ive seen plenty of players on the sidelines toss pods/swap guns in the middle of recball games.

However. Swapping markers/paint/air during rec is fine. Time is limited during rec play, so might as well get the most out of it."
paintball,3cycok,bleedsmarinara,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:06:00 2015 UTC,"Shouting team positions is a little scummy, but when I'm reffing I'll see people swap guns if they're in a group. Nothing wrong with that. Hell, on speedball fields if you say your gun isn't working and a player that's out hears you, they'll throw you their gun for the game sometimes.   What the dad did was perfectly fine. You can get yourself a podpack too if you feel like you need it."
paintball,3cycok,noided1111,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:51:24 2015 UTC,"Dead men shouldn't talk. For Walk-on rec games, it's pretty accepted at my local field to toss paint or markers in to players in need though. We'd rather watch a sick gunfight than call the game for running out of paint."

If this were the ""back in the day"" that dude would have left with bruises from being lit up every game for the rest of the day whether he was out or not.

paintball,3cziv7,savageape21,11,Sun Jul 12 05:04:30 2015 UTC,Yes.   Also it doesnt sound like you have pro gear. That would mean gear that you bought from a pro player. Experienced players will know you are new before you play with them.   Dont worry about what people think. Just have fun playing and be good to the people around you.   My advice would be to keep the gear you have and also get a cheap mechanical semi and play with that some too. Learn the skills. Ita nice to have a marker that can throw down a wall of paint but I have noticed that players learn to rely on that wall of paint when tjey start out that way.

Back in the day when paintball players were younger (like highschool age) and less mature, people could get shit for having gear but not playing well. It's not like that anymore. Now days everyone is a bit more grown up. If you play paintball you probably have a job, if you have a job and love paintball your probably going to have nice gear, regardless of your skill level. If you enjoy shooting your luxe and are comfortable in your soft gear, then great."

paintball,3cziv7,Strongdog71,1 point,Sun Jul 12 07:47:23 2015 UTC,I only make fun of people with gear that are new is when they are completely trash. for example I played at the paintball park at camp pendleton and 2 dudes with luxes and the whole nine yards only won one out of 10 games we played against them when we had bt7s and other than me no one else had played. If they can't win a 2v3 against rentals they are doing something wrong. Now as long as you don't act like a poser you should be fine maybe watch some videos to learn some of the basics and you should fit right in and always remember always avoid popping up over the bunker.

And a dm10 really isn't too outdated it still shoots all the modes you need and definitly keeps up with newer markers. Dm10s were going out of stock when I got my Fx and even though I wasn't shopping in that price range I did still revere it.

paintball,3cy2wk,KalynSS999,1 point,Sat Jul 11 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"Its a VLocity. I have the VLocity Jr and its smaller than that one. Its a mid range hopper. The reloading mechanism is more of a sorter type than a force feed. The ""force feed"" kinda happens in the at the center is spring loaded and the motor pulses to keep the tension. (You can hear the motor buzzing when it puts this tension on) however the spring was too strong and didnt stretch to apply force. So it was more like the motor is pulsing on a solid feeding paddles. The loader itself is good. I've never been able to out shoot it in semi (but I'm a slower shooter as I mostly play pump) the shell however is like the hard plastic which tends to crack and break. There are still some shells out there for replacement. However, the raceway/feedneck, no one has them."

paintball,3cy2wk,Egobeliever,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:07:10 2015 UTC,I use one. I like it a lot. I don't know why I don't see more of them. It shot thru two hoppers without any problems on a strange shocker vision with unlimited ramping capped at 30 bps. They teased me on how big it was until they saw it work. I just use it on an old 04 vision impulse. I have no need to get anything else. Best of luck on it. You can set different force settings based on how fast you shoot and how brittle your paint is. Check the user manual if you got it or can find it.

paintball,3cw3lj,CDtothehizzle,5,Sat Jul 11 07:02:02 2015 UTC,"A lot of fields don't offer high end paint like Evil or Gi 5 star or valken redemption. So you feel like you're getting a mediocre experience since you can shoot better paint for the same price.   Tell the owner(s) of the field you want better field paint options. If they want to make money, they will listen. If they don't, don't play there. Paint sales are where the majority of their profit resides.  FPO is better for everyone. Fields make more money, players get fresher paint, nobody can accuse anybody of freezing paint, you won't get oil from shitty Walmart paint on all your gear... the list goes on.  but here's where we run into trouble:   we like BYOP for the ability to bring higher quality of paint for the same price of Field Paint.   You can't complain about paint options if you go online to save $10 on a case of Graffiti. People buying paint elsewhere is the reason fields resort to selling white box for $50 and establishing FPO rules. Support your local field and buy your paint there. It's going to be fresher anyway."
paintball,3cw3lj,forgotmyredditagain,2,Sat Jul 11 07:37:50 2015 UTC,"If the field is hosting a big game and has resonably priced paint for medium quality paint. I'd buy their paint.   This year, wasaga is raising the price even more at 110 a case of inka bio-ball which is basically spectrum... Fuck wasaga you greedy douche bags. no case of paint is worth 110.   Carnage Carnage at Flag Raiders is giving us 75 for pre-reg for marbs. Not the best price but still 30 bucks cheaper then wasaga.  So I'd support Flag Raiders over Wasaga.   Certainly there are times FPO fails and wasaga fails. I wont support such unreasonable prices.  Also Canada so our paint prices are stupid high already."

paintball,3cw3lj,Seaskimmer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:31:47 2015 UTC,"Why can't field offer proshop priced paint? If there's one field that can do it, why can't others? The field in question does not have a proshop and primarily caters to owners/regulars who play speedball.   The only reason fields need to charge $180/case is because they cater only to renters - aka people who are going to play paintball once a year. They don't mind paying these prices because paintball isn't a regular activity for them. These prices completely alienate gear owners because nobody is going to play regularly at their field for those prices."
paintball,3cw3lj,GooeyPod,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:09:32 2015 UTC,"Depends on the field. For example, my local fields mostly just do woodsball. Speedball obviously uses much more paint and as a result the field makes less money on paint if the field does woodsball more."

I can't recall ever being hit so hard in 20 years of paintballing.  I've been bloodied before plenty of times but nothing like what I felt at HSP.

I paid for the weekend scenario, but ended up leaving early because everyone was getting bounces from 20 feet away. The only way to get paint that was brittle enough to break at reasonable distances, was to get the ""Tourny Grade"" HK Army Premier.            edit: Usually Field Paint Only events have better paint, I just happened to have a bad experience at that particular scenario."

Hotbox iirc is a white box paint which usually means second or third run paint aka the stuff that wasn't good enough for the high end or mid grade. I don't know if its the same thing for Hotbox though because it usually shoots pretty straight for me.

Less pain and more annoyance you got hit cause you were silly and stuck your arm out too far out of cover.  After the first hit you'll realize it's no big deal, take more risks which sometimes pay off, and have a total blast.

You don't back out of a game of soccer because you might take a cleat to the jaw. It's not about the pain it's not about causing pain it's about tactics, skill, and most of all fun. The only spot that might be a little uncomfortable is right above your hips in the tender area between your ribs. And still, it's not bad at all. Personally I like to be hit a couple times atleast because it's that sit second tiny sting..idk I just like it but really it does not hurt.  Source:I play shirtless a lot."
paintball,3cvjwe,mrkleen340,1 point,Sat Jul 11 11:52:06 2015 UTC,"As others have said, it really isn't as bad as you're probably imagining it is. My advice is to not have exposed skin. I submit that even a thin layer is better than nothing. I always go in pants and long sleeved jersey. I wear gloves and a hat with my mask. It can get hot but it gives you a little more padding and can make some hits less gnarly looking in the days to follow. Now sometimes I get pretty nasty looking bruises, other times I can only tell where I've been shot by poking around. The distance, type of paint, where you were hit, and a lot of other factors are going to determine what kind of mark is left. But think of it this way, if it really hurt that much, we wouldn't have so many active players enjoying the sport every week. And if you decide it isn't your cup of tea that's fine, no shame in not doing something you didn't enjoy.  Also, when I have the chance I go for mask or gun hits on rental players. Not every one does this but I think it lets them ease in to it a bit without the pain. Though getting a body shot is bound to happen and it is probably best to get it over with sooner in the day than later so you aren't dreading it."
paintball,3cvjwe,eleven4for20,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:00:11 2015 UTC,The worst pain you will feel is the fatigue at the end of the day. You will be putting your body in positions that it is not used to. Kinda like the feeling of landscaping for a full day when you haven't done it in months.

You have to understand that you will be pumping adrenalin, and one of the side affects is that you will fell pain less.  Literally, your nerve endings become less sensitive.  Just go out there in comfortable, breathable, light, clothes and you will be 100% fine."
paintball,3cvjwe,LukeGrasshopper,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:29:43 2015 UTC,"It is a bit painful, don't let people fool you into thinking that it doesn't hurt at all. The pain factor relies heavily on where exactly you're hit and at what range. That being said, the temporary pain is nothing you should be scared of at all. The first hit is always the worst because you don't really know what to expect. My suggestion is that the first round you play, get extremely aggressive and move up the field because it doesn't matter if you get hit and at least you'll get the first hit over with. After that it's all about having fun and dunking the other teams :) I've had some really painful hits before but I don't think I've ever had any sort of pain that lasted more than that one round so don't sweat it and have fun!"

paintball,3ctkca,mrkleen340,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:39:27 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I'm really happy with mine (for context I upgraded from an SFT). It is pretty quiet and very light. The OLED makes configuration a breeze. The bolt is easy to maintain and the price point made it a solid purchase. I'm hoping to take it out again tomorrow and put another case through it. I love not having a macroline to worry about and overall the construction feels rock solid. My only gripe so far is that I can't use a drop forward... but seems like the sport moved away from those a few years ago anyway. I already had a full freak kit for both my cocker(RSX is cocker threaded) and SFT, so being able to use that was just another perk."

Back then it was even smaller than it is now with most companies being run by mom and pop shops and machine shop owners who happened to a side business in paintball. AKA one of the companies that was hurt the most by the Gardeners was one of those types of businesses. The Gardeners were lawyers first and foremost and saw the growing paintball businesses as a way to make a quick buck. As lawyers are known to do, they used their knowledge of the law to screw over the little guys. By getting their hands on the patents for the operation of a paint marker by electronic means, they effectively eliminated their competion and ensured that they would continue to profit from the royalties of anyone willing to pay them.  /tired rant"

The GoPro case also muffles audio quite a bit. Best way to mount a GoPro is to put it on your barrel, but just about anything else is pointless. I prefer Contour myself. Their technology isn't quite as advanced as GoPro (smaller company and all...) but their form factor makes them very easy to mount to just about anything you have, on the barrel or mask or feedneck or wherever you want.

paintball,3cu3x9,MoltenCookie,8,Fri Jul 10 20:04:32 2015 UTC,"I'm just going to list a couple tips that always come to mind when i see new players out on the field. (This turned out longer than I expected, and is more of a general advice post for anyone. Enjoy.)   Bunker Bustin' - Avoid getting stuck too close to a bunker. Bunkers and barriers are great to avoid getting shot, but if you sidle right up against one you're likely to get stuck there if you come under fire. Stay a few feet back. It allows you to conceal yourself from the opposing team, but still gives you room to move and look around. Also, bunkers are not always the best cover. People expect players to be behind bunkers, so that's where they'll look. Use soft cover like bushes and long grass which might not be an obvious place for the enemy to look. There have been times where I've hidden beside or in front of bunkers and have people not notice me because they didn't expect me to be out in the open. Safety in Numbers...sort of. - Keep in contact with your team and work together. Stay close enough to communicate, but don't be so close that you start getting stuck in bunkers together. It's comforting to have friends close, but being in one bunker just makes you an easy target. You can't see, and you can't support eachother. It's better to spread out and have multiple angles to attack and defend from.  Patience is a Virtue - It's tempting to shoot at an opposing player when you see them across the field, but you WILL miss 9 times out of 10. Paintball markers have limited range and accuracy, so it's always best to wait until your target is close. If you can't be seen and the enemy is advancing,  take advantage of that and let them close the distance for you. Wait until you know you can hit them, or until you think they might discover you before shooting. If they're in the open, even better. That gives you time to get a couple shots in if you miss the first one. If you're the one advancing, don't shoot until you've gotten as close to your target as you think you can get. If you take your time, you'll have more than one opportunity to take the shot. After you take that first shot, any advantage you had will be lost if you don't hit the other player. Movement is Key - The road to beating your opponents is through movement (and sometimes the lack thereof-see next point.) If you get stuck in a fight you can't win (hint: most bunker to bunker fighting comes down to lucky shots if you're not experienced,) fall back out of range and try to get a new angle on your attacker.  If you have a teammate with you, attack from multiple angles. Use one person to draw enemy fire and have the other move closer or to the side to get a better firing position (flanking.)  The start of the game is the most crucial point for gaining ground. The momentum you establish off the hop often determines how well your team will do. If you can control the majority of the field before the other team even knows what's going on, you'll have a huge advantage. Sometimes you might even be able to get behind the enemy and have your pick of targets. Lack of Movement is the Key... to remaining unseen. -  It doesn't matter if you're wearing the best camouflage in the world, if you're moving, you're going to be visible. To stay hidden, camo gear helps, but even rental coveralls can be hard to see if the person wearing them stays still. This goes back to my point about patience. If an opponent is coming at you and you haven't been seen, don't run for cover, stay still until he's looking away or until you can shoot them. I've had an entire team walk within feet of me and not see me because i just didn't move. I didn't have any special camo (just a green jacket,) and my only cover was a few fern leaves.  Play to win - Whatever game mode you're playing, go after the objectives. If there's a flag to be captured, go get it. If there's a fortress to be attacked, move up and take it. Outside of elimination modes, ""kills"" don't matter. If you take out almost an entire team, but their last player gets the flag, they still win. As my old playing buddy always said ""shoot to move, don't move to shoot."" The marker is a tool to help achieve your objective, shooting is not the objective itself. Its purpose is to help remove players who are between you and whatever your objective is. In the past, my friends and I made a point of winning games without shooting. It can be extremely satisfying to out play people without having to shoot them. (Fun fact: Ritchie White won the very first paintball game without ever firing a shot.) No paint? No problem. - If you run out of paint, don't leave the game. Unless it's a field/game rule, you don't have to leave the game if you're out of ammo. You can still be useful to your team, even if you can't eliminate players. Be a spotter and call out enemy positions. Act as a decoy to help reveal opposing players. Go get the flag (or whatever objective there is.) Dry firing (shooting without any ammo) can sometimes help keep heads down, but be aware that experienced players can usually tell the difference between the sound of a regular shot and a dry fire (dry firing tends to be louder.) If you're really brave, sneak up on an enemy and get a ""mercy kill"" (get so close that you give them the chance to surrender without being shot.) It's always fun to let a guy know that you took him out while your hopper was empty. Getting shot isn't the end of the world  - You're going to get hit with paintballs at some point. Personally, I think it's better to get shot while you're trying to win rather than while you're cowering in the rear-most bunker with five other teammates afraid of getting shot. Put simply, no guts, no glory. I have huge respect for any player who gives it his all and fails, instead of playing it safe. There are times to be pragmatic and cautious, but when there's 30 seconds left and a base to capture, all bets are off. You lose if you get shot, but you also lose if you sit in your bunker until time runs out. Better to go out in a blaze of glory with a slim chance of winning than to fizzle out with a guaranteed loss. It's not the size of the gun, it's how you use it - Don't be intimidated by other players gear. Whether they're decked out in colour coordinated tourney gear and an electro, or rocking a ghillie suit and a gun with 50 pounds of attachments, it doesn't matter. First, the gear doesn't make the player. Anyone with some cash can buy all the fanciest gear, it doesn't mean they're good at the game. Where I play, I tend to find that the guys who spend the most time collecting gear spend the least amount of time improving their game. It's not a hard and fast rule, but I would say it's relatively consistent. In the end it doesn't matter, you can win with a 25 year old rental pump, or the latest and greatest Bob Long custom. It's all in how you use the tools you have.  Most importantly.... It's just a game. - This is advice I'd give to any player, new or old. The whole point of playing is to enjoy yourself. If you're not having fun, take a break. If you're taking the game too seriously, chill out. You're only ruining it for yourself (and sometimes others, if you're an asshole about it.)  In the end, there's nothing to be gained by getting mad about stuff that happens on the field. If someone out plays you or hits you with a really good shot, a ""Good game"" or ""Nice Shot!"" goes a long way toward keeping things fun and respectful. Being able to laugh at the end of the day and tell each other some fun stories over drinks or ice cream is about as good as it can get.    Have fun. Be safe.  tl;dr: There's no summary, just read it. Or don't. I don't care."
paintball,3cu3x9,SkinnyBins,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:19:16 2015 UTC,"Wow, thanks for putting all this effort into typing out your comment.  I learned a lot from this and this is definitely a reference I will be using whenever I need to.  I have a question regarding accuracy, though: you say that I will most likely miss most of my shots at a respectable distance. Is there a reasonable and numerical distance where I will most likely hit maybe two or three out of five shots?  Also, I'm really fond of the psychological warfare going on in paintball.  Are there any sort of deceptions or intimidation techniques I could employ to gain an advantage over my opponent (I.e. suppressing the enemy to keep their head down, call out imaginary friends to deceive my numbers)?"
paintball,3cu3x9,SkinnyBins,2,Sat Jul 11 05:56:43 2015 UTC,"The reason you will probably miss most of your shots is that you won't be familiar with your gun. Paintballs don't fly straight and you have to rely on being familiar with how your gun shoots to be able to predict where your balls are going to go. Best advice I can give you is to try and spend a little time with the gun before the game actually starts. Take some intentional shots downfield to get a feel for the consistency of your marker. Watch carefully to see if your shots follow the same general path, or tend to veer off or drop at a certain distance.  If there is a distance at which the balls are consistently changing direction, that will be your effectively accurate range. Hopefully you'll be able to count on your balls going to the same place at that distance (I'm guessing it will be between 25-50 feet?) Other than that, make sure the barrel is clean and check with a ref before you do any test shooting. It will take time to get used to how the gun shoots, and rentals are quite literally hit and miss. Some places maintain them really well, others just throw them in a bucket until next time. As far as sighting your shots goes, my recommendation is to look down the barrel, but keep both eyes open. This gives you a better idea of the arc because your depth perception is still intact.   edit: The other reason not to shoot at a longer range is that the balls may not break, even if you hit a player. Which leads me to point out that you should aim for the mask if you can. It's hard, which means the paint will most likely break, and if you hit the lens, the person cannot mistake whether they've been hit. On top of that, it doesn't hurt as much, but it can be quite a shock.   In regards to psychological warfare, I can't think of anything specific off hand. Just keep it clean (ie. don't pretend you're out when you're not.)   It's not exactly psychological warfare, but I find that constantly calling out the positions of enemy players can both provide your team with situational awareness  and sometimes cause the other team to think twice about where they're moving. When they know they're being watched (even if they're out of range) they get a little nervous and slow their advance."
paintball,3cu3x9,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:21:07 2015 UTC,Turn your marker sideways and dry fire it so they think you're out of ammo. Let them come at you then shoot them.  We used to do this with old guns that had powerfeed where you could just twist the knob on the side to stop the paint flow :)

paintball,3cu3x9,SlidePanda,2,Fri Jul 10 21:33:46 2015 UTC,Biggest tip - Get your team to talk. Communication is key.
paintball,3cu3x9,Wozrop,3,Fri Jul 10 20:07:44 2015 UTC,"I might be paired up with one of my buddies who is insistent on being a lone wolf.  Whenever I'm playing online games with him, he will usually do his own thing while I get frustrated with him.  How should I get him to communicate if I'm on his team?"
paintball,3cu3x9,SlidePanda,2,Fri Jul 10 20:15:11 2015 UTC,"Let him go off on his own then, there'll be lots of people, introduce your self, ""Hi my name is /u/MoltenCookie and I have no idea what I'm doing.""  I'm going to say right now that if you try to be a lone wolf your first time you will lose, you will get shot, the only reason to be by yourself is to sneak around and that's hard to do, you have to balance stealth versus effectiveness, but that's a different answer to a different question. I'm willing to bet he'll be fighting with the rest of you after a couple games.  If he's the guy sitting on top of buildings trying to snipe people in Battlefield he's gonna be doing nothing at all trying that in paintball.  PS. You don't really have to survive, running all the way to a flag and getting shot 3 times is way more fun that sitting in the back and missing all your shots, I learned that from experience, you might get scared of it, but just remember even if you fail, it'll at least be interesting. Hope you guys have a good time"

OP - Taking some risks can lead to great reward. (also knowing the fields rules). I recently played for the first time in 7-8 years and took out ~50% of the other team (with mah pump gun). A couple were eliminations by hits, but I took out a full 1/3 of the other team by making a do or die sort of run around the tail of the field and forcing the surrender of two bunkers - which happened to have a total of 5 people hiding out in. I expected 2, thought there might be 3... was a bit stunned at 5.  But that field had a pretty conservative (geared towards new players) surrender rule, that I very much took advantage of. Other fields without that... I still might a done it.. but been shot up for it as well."

paintball,3cu3x9,DakkaDakka24,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:27:15 2015 UTC,"Without a thermal lens it's kind of hard, but having a bandana/headwrap/handkerchief/sweatband resting on your forehead, just above the foam of your mask, is the best thing to keep fogging to a minimum.   Another tip is to make sure that you breath in through your mouth, out through your nose. People tend to go all mouth breathing because the mask restricts airflow, but you'll fog much quicker if you exhale through your mouth.  Basically do everything possible to keep moisture away from the lens."
paintball,3cu3x9,zorro1589,1 point,Fri Jul 10 22:03:14 2015 UTC,"Thermal lenses work better than a standard lense, fans help to a certain degree but are noisy and take away from perception.

Excerpts from my RMA inquiry with GoPro include  ""Unfortunately this kind of damage can't be covered under warranty since it involved a sudden force or impact during use"" and ""If you plan on using a GoPro camera in a paintball environment, it would be best to mount it in a paintball field location where it's less likely to get hit, such as the top of a barrier or on the ground in the corner of the paintball field area.""  tl;dnr: If you want to take a GoPro paintballing, don't wear it.

paintball,3cu81m,iineviitable,1 point,Sat Jul 11 01:40:18 2015 UTC,"Please explain why that is called a solenoid, I work in chicken houses and use farm equipment on a large scale so I know about some common technology. A solenoid is an electro-magnet that holds/carries current because the circuit board itself cannot actually hold a current, they're important in the computer main-frames in newer chicken houses which regulate all the temp. Sensors and tell the system to run fans or run heat, when to run feed, when to open/close vents, keeps track of how much water chickens are drinking etc etc...so, the electro magnet in an E-paintball gun is the same thing it carries the current load and pretty much sends it out upon request. This part can't actually leak, but when people say they have a leaky solenoid it's like the word takes on a different definition and it seems to be what people call the ""piston"" inside the regulator. Am I right? Because I own a mid-high end marker and I take it apart for maintenance and modification all the time.  Edit: tl;dr-a solenoid, to my knowledge has nothing to do with air/gas and cannot actually leak it is an electro-magnet, I think people call the piston inside the reg a solenoid. (I call it a solenoid too because that's just what it's called I guess only it's weird when we use the same term to describe different parts)"
paintball,3cu81m,JGdirtyWHITE,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:15:30 2015 UTC,"In machining/maintenance, which is where i'm coming from, it controls air flow from one place to another or 3 or 4.

And on the top of my solenoid if i remember correctly has 2 o-rings on it and a hose connected for the air intake and the 2 o-rings to move the air in the front of the bolt and the back of the bolt.

paintball,3csnc9,Aidspanda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 13:47:46 2015 UTC,"Freaks are popular around here for their price and the fact you can just get a different back to use the kit on a different marker.   However, the Lurker eigen kit is slightly cheaper and I can't recommend it highly enough. It's lighter than my shaft 4 with deadlywinds tip and has a markedly quieter sound signature. (It's replaced more expensive kits in my collection.)"
paintball,3csnc9,mahlers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:13:27 2015 UTC,What are you looking to get out of your barrel? And for what price?
paintball,3csnc9,Seaskimmer,0,Fri Jul 10 14:19:07 2015 UTC,"Price isn't really an issue but I would like to keep it under $200, mainly looking for a barrel kit that would let me shoot more accurately, noise reduction would be a plus but is not necessary"
paintball,3csnc9,mahlers,5,Fri Jul 10 14:35:30 2015 UTC,Save your money then. No barrel helps accuracy. Buy higher quality paint instead.
paintball,3csnc9,mahlers,5,Fri Jul 10 14:59:04 2015 UTC,they can help with consistency depending on the barrel he is using though. IE a stock 98 custom barrel is trash where as the JJ Ceramic barrel for like $20 is much better and doesnt sound like a cannon.
paintball,3csnc9,mobiusmorte,3,Fri Jul 10 15:13:58 2015 UTC,accuracy isnt a barrel thing. It is more of a consistency of paint and fps that will make your balls hit a smaller more consistently.   Buying an after market barrel is more for  1) sound signature   2) ability to bore match   3) different looks   4)different weight  5)efficiency due to paint matching  I picked up a stella barrel kit about a month back and absolutely love it. I did a 5 piece custom set for the free barrel case and picked up 3 backs 1 front and a tip. Im looking to get a slimline front a threaded front and a few more backs in the near future. It is by far the quietest barrel ive heard on my Axe or any other axes. The creator is the engineer behind the Empire Axe. They all have an 8 inch control bore for supposed better consistency over the 5 in freak. I would give them a look. They also have some of the best customer service ive encountered. They arent the lightest barrels nor the cheapest.
paintball,3csnc9,mahlers,-1,Fri Jul 10 15:10:16 2015 UTC,"Ever use a crappy barrel? It absolutely effects accuracy, luckily most barrels on the market today are fairly high quality. As a player who started in the eighties I had more than a few experiences with crap barrels. You kids today don't know how good you have it.... /rant  Since sarcasm is hard to write standard sarcasm disclaimer here."
paintball,3csnc9,valve_bender,1 point,Fri Jul 10 17:20:30 2015 UTC,unless the barrel is bent/misformed/scratched to hell on the inside/horribly overbored the barrel doesnt have much to do with it. you are right ive never played with a pre -'95 gun but even when i started the balls would shoot somewhat consistently.
paintball,3csnc9,mahlers,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"Inception Designs Stella barrel system. 8"" control bore(unless you get the freak back), you can buy each part separately for $30-40 to spend less money as you have less, lots of porting for quietness, and is user-friendly for pumps and autocockers.  I have the setup with a freak ready barrel back and a slimline barrel front, but you could also use the regular backs for longer bore, and get the threaded barrel front to buy different barrel tips to change the look and length of your barrel.  They even have easy kits you can buy rather than piecing it together, for at or under $200, right here  Edit: keep away from the polished raw barrels if you don't want to spend even more money. Buying the raw barrels means you're going to also pay somebody to anodize them after purchasing them, and will usually run you upwards of $100, so it's only if you're really into color-matching your gun."
paintball,3csnc9,Aidspanda,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:13:19 2015 UTC,"You can also email them to make your own custom kit if you dont like their preset kits. 5 piece gives you a free case, 7 is a free case and 10% off, 9 i think is 15% and a free case."

paintball,3csnc9,aviator_60,3,Fri Jul 10 15:48:28 2015 UTC,deadly winds I've used random shit to squeegee it....   I think the problem was with stiffi or with the empire CF tips. They didn't enamel the CF properly and there were loose threads that would catch. I've only heard of the empire CF tips doing this.   Never heard a deadly wind have this problem.
paintball,3csnc9,mazu747,2,Fri Jul 10 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"It was a very well publicized problem with the Empire version.  They used unidirectional carbon fiber as the inner-most (bore side) layer of their layup.  They didn't realize that when they milled the porting that it would result in edges that would catch fibers.  This condition led to fibers pulling layers out of the layup much like shale flakes away.  Companies now use satin weaves on the inner layer as well as milling with multi-flute, incredibly sharp cutters to avoid this condition."

paintball,3cvxt2,novonn,2,Sat Jul 11 05:46:52 2015 UTC,"wut?   you're comparing a mechanical marker to an electronic marker...   This isn't a high end vs low end argument.   It's a rate of fire argument.   I have high end mechanical markers... They shoot awesome... Can I walk 12bps with out eyes... not really.  I'll end up chopping past 8 and with the 1-2lb trigger pull.. it gets pretty tiring just shooting 8bps with out short stroking.   Do I have high end electros? Sure do. Do I need to push the field in a big game and shoot a bunch of paint. I shoot the electro. the ability to walk the trigger in semi with a feather light trigger is going to make it easier to get people out when you can shoot more paint.   There is not difference between an enemy with a 14 inch barrel or an etek3 14 inch barrel other then preference, loudness, vibration, and barrel rise. Outside of the light trigger pull and the electronically governed engine.   The gog enemy brings it back to the fundamentals of paintball.. Muscle memory. You're not using your rate of fire as a crutch for bad snap shooting or aiming. I loved the enemy i shot.. but I already have 4 high end mechanical autocockers. So I don't need one."

And consistency depending on the marker. They may be pretty similar in this case because with the enmey you get pretty dn good consistency for what it is.  Just remember that consistency plays a direct role in accuracy as well."
paintball,3cvxt2,socks86,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:21:37 2015 UTC,the biggest contributing factor would be air regulation.   the enemy vs an etek there may be some variation in consistancy but it's not like 98C vs etek differences.
paintball,3cvxt2,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Sat Jul 11 17:43:29 2015 UTC,"Like I said, depending on the marker. I wasn't limiting what I said to just the enmey vs etek, because they are probably pretty close consistency wise."

paintball,3cvxt2,GoldyGoldy,1 point,Sat Jul 11 07:45:51 2015 UTC,The difference is the kick.  A gun with less kick and a sensitive trigger will shoot more accurately because the gun isn't moving around while you are shooting.

It's a little quieter than the Etek 4 but smoother than the ego 11.  It's not an LV1 on efficiency or sound signature but beats an upgraded Ego 11.  It feels better in the hands than the ego 11 due to the LV1 ergonomics(if you like that type of front grip).    Lack of external LPR means you can wrap your thumb around the barrel.

paintball,3cq3z3,paintballer11,2,Fri Jul 10 03:49:26 2015 UTC,I was about to say the Etek 5 has the second best triggers I've ever felt (first being the Axe Pro). Definitely is preference.
paintball,3cq3z3,mazu747,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:59:06 2015 UTC,"It is purely preference, my gripe is that it feels too loose, not enough positive return.  I got used to it though.  Profile is fine."

paintball,3cq3z3,mazu747,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:41:24 2015 UTC,I just upgraded from an A5 to an ETEK5. It's still in the mail but I'm eager to try it. I tried an Axe and an Etha and I honestly preferred the Etha over the Axe. The trigger on the Axe felt too smooth and I couldn't stand the front grip on it. I've been told eteks are incredibly reliable and durable compared to other markers around that price. As always though the best way to choose a marker is by giving them a try and finding one that feels right for you.

paintball,3cq3z3,stressedoutatumc,-7,Wed Jul 15 03:47:53 2015 UTC,Etek 5 will basically be an LV1 (from what I've seen) with a macroline..which is pretty good lol. Drone 2s are pretty light and foolproof spool guns quieter than etek 5 but not so quiet. for $500 you can't really mess up with either choice so I'd go with aesthetics...$500 will also net you a crazy deal on a used high end too though so its best to check everywhere before making up your mind.
paintball,3cq3z3,Christofolo,8,Thu Jul 9 23:42:54 2015 UTC,Etek 5's don't have the lever valve from the LV1.
paintball,3cq3z3,GoldyGoldy,7,Thu Jul 9 23:55:37 2015 UTC,"They shoot completely different, no lever valve which is what makes the LV1 iconic"
paintball,3cq3z3,WoodSorrow,-1,Thu Jul 9 23:56:15 2015 UTC,Doesn't it have everything else though? I've held and shot both and it doesn't seem so crazy a difference to me...then again I don't have as much experience with high ends as others lol

paintball,3cq3z3,zorro1589,2,Fri Jul 10 00:31:27 2015 UTC,"Huge difference.  Etek 5 is great, but the LV1 is miles smoother, quieter, and more efficient.   Similar, yet drastically different."

paintball,3cq3z3,zorro1589,2,Fri Jul 10 01:31:02 2015 UTC,"Feels more like a low-mid end spool. Not very loud and pretty smooth, but not as quiet and smooth as most high end spools.  Great exchange if you ask me."

paintball,3cq60z,kavar13,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:01:44 2015 UTC,It's literally the same as any other pump conversion.   remove front block attach pump kit   The empire cockers have the same front block mounting as a karni so it literally just bolts right on. The only real concern is the pump rod as you need a custom length which you can probably find rather easily.

paintball,3cq60z,Lunarpancake,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:00:23 2015 UTC,"CCM kits and similar use a dual male 10-32 threaded pump arm. The empire sniper pump rods are male and female threaded due to how they're mounted onto the plate. I have no idea what length you need for this, but I would wager a guess that it's probably close to a mini half block length at 6.875 inches. I would measure it yourself as I'm just guessing here."

paintball,3cp5h6,mjrulz5,3,Thu Jul 9 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"First let me say that you will absolutely LOVE ION! When you forget about the amount of money you will spend on entry and paint and focus on the amount of fun you will have, it is totally worth it.   Now, excuse my lengthy post, but hey, you asked for it....  Assuming you get there Friday, this is how your experience will go, generally speaking:  You'll park and set up your camping spot next to a bunch of other players. Think college football tailgating, but with tents everywhere. You'll then go to the registration area to sign in and get your paint. I personally recommend buying about 1.5 cases per person to start, then buy it as you need it moving forward. It becomes a liability to have extra cases just sitting in the sun, roasting in your car, or sitting outside waiting to be stolen.   Friday night you'll just hang out, booze a little (if you're of age of course ;) ), walk around to vendors and shops, talk to other players and spend the whole night wishing it was noon on Saturday already.   Saturday comes, you're gonna wanna wake up no later than 8:00 to get your gear and paint all situated, then head to the rally area to hear the game overview and rules at 10:30. Before you know it it'll be almost 12:00, and you will be waiting at the German insertion point getting your chrono done and then heading out onto the field.   EVERYONE is on the field for the first hour or so, and then people start taking breaks. It is entirely up to YOU when you want to walk off the field and take a break. If you're interested in running missions with a group, plan accordingly, as the group will be meeting at the insertion point getting orders from the command staff well before the time noted on the game rundown page. You don't need to know anyone special to be a part of a mission. Just show up at the insertion point at the appropriate time, tell them you want to get involved, and do what they say. They will rarely tell someone ""no"" if they want to help out with an objective.   Hope this helps. Any other questions, ask away."
paintball,3cp5h6,AliceNChaynz628,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:34:00 2015 UTC,"Thank you for the response, this covered all of my questions."
paintball,3cp5h6,EsquireSandwich,2,Thu Jul 9 19:33:06 2015 UTC,"For a bit more info on missions, the play area is broken down into a dozen or so smaller fields. At the top and bottom of each hour certain fields are worth points- sometimes there is a flag stick around the middle of the field and it has to be showing your side's color at :00 or :30. Sometimes the refs will drop a prop which you will want to run back to your side's Insertion point/HQ.   The first hour (i think) of the game is the beach, there are no other objectives then for germans to defend the five flags placed along the treeline or for the allies to control them. The last hour of the game (on sunday) is similar.   The best way to be productive and have the most fun is to do some planning. As you walk off the field check the time (bringing a watch is a great idea) think about how long you want to rest/eat/gear up and plan ahead. Maybe there is a mission to field that is of particular interest to you, try to be on the field ~30 min. before hand to have enough time to get there and fight to control it.  Sometimes there are surprise missions and special role playing objectives, while those are usually taken on by players with a bit more experience in the game, if you want to explore some of the role playing aspects ask if there is anything you can do with the French when you insert (except for initial insertion, that's all about the Beach).  The role playing and 3rd party entities was a bit confusing for me the first few years. The French are essentially mercenaries, both the axis and allies have cash and the French are trying to get as much of it as possible. The French players might be fighting for the allies at the start but switch to axis at some point, you can't really trust them. If you go to ""treat"" with the French you might go off field and have a discussion with the French commander sort of ""in-character.""   Have fun, I'm happy to answer any other questions you have."
paintball,3cp5h6,samizdat1,3,Fri Jul 10 15:57:43 2015 UTC,"Something that might seem common sense, but is pretty important: Take water with you onto the field.  A camelbak or similar device is best since you can use it without removing your mask (and removing or even displacing your mask on the field, even when not near the action, will get you a stern talking to from a ref), but even having a bottle of water to drink once you're in a safe zone is important, since there is no free potable water near the insertion points unless you're very dehydrated and have to ask the medics.  The field is pretty huge and if you get there on Friday you're guaranteed a pretty long walk from your tent to the field, you don't want to be baking in the sun the whole time without any water.  You don't want to ruin your weekend by getting sun stroke/severe dehydration.  Also, although most of the more devoted players will tout going on missions, earning points, etc, you can 100% play the game just for the sake of shooting people.  The Germans never hold the beach for too long, but when I play German side I really enjoy being one of the last ones holding out on the edge of the beach until I get shot from behind because the line broke everywhere else.  Just be prepared to see people ignore breaks or wipe off the paint  - with 4500 players and a fairly limited number of refs, it's pretty much impossible to enforce breaks, especially early on Saturday when everyone is out.  Be prepared to get hit dozens of times, even if you surrender.  Putting up your gun and walking away from the fighting helps, but sometimes you just get stuck in a bad position and hit a lot.  There's the occasional jerk that shoots frozen paintballs or cranks up their gun after chrono (and, just like with breaks, the refs really can't check every gun on the field to make sure it's still at 280) and those will hurt more, but you're kinda signing up for some pain when you go paintballing anyways.  Be wary of fighting at night.  Last year my group was discussing whether to push on in the woods when a much smaller group of ghilly-suited, night-vision wearing players snuck up on us, closely followed by a ref.  We did the right thing and surrendered, but it was pretty embarrassing for two or three people to take us all out at once."

paintball,3cp1z5,bobwolts,3,Thu Jul 9 17:01:40 2015 UTC,"Rotors don't like reballs or low quality (small-bore) paint - they will jam. Additionally, they're shell is so durable and impact absorbing that you often have NO IDEA if you're hit in the loader. It led to enough penalties that Dynasty stopped using them all-together, even before the TFX was released.  The TFX is reball friendly, feeds all different sizes of paint, has a harder shell, lower profile and only takes 2 AA batteries. TFX all the way  edit: for the record, I shoot an OLED and Shocker. I stopped using the Rotor before the TFX was announced and switched to a Z2 cause I was sick of having to use the sharkfin."

paintball,3cp1z5,Allssie,2,Thu Jul 9 23:08:20 2015 UTC,Both a great hoppers either one will keep up with your luxe. I have both I personally like the tfx it has a lower profile than the rotor and runs on 2 batteries rather than the e or the rotor. I did hear of planned shells coming out for it that you can swap for different looks and capacity.  Other than that comes down to price and color choice. Rotor has just about every color to match a marker. Tfx on the other hand only has 3 at the moment.

But it really feels like a $800 marker and not a $500 marker. as far as customer service goes, empire is second to none.

paintball,3cosox,mx63,2,Thu Jul 9 16:55:04 2015 UTC,probably once the dm16 (if there is one) gets announced yes the 15 will drop even more to clear out inventory for the 16.
paintball,3cosox,Seaskimmer,3,Thu Jul 9 16:58:12 2015 UTC,dm16 (if there is one)   Of course there is going to be one... it might even have OLED this year!
paintball,3cosox,SlidePanda,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:29:29 2015 UTC,"Big price drops for known items like the DM line is probably trying to clear stock in advance of a new model release.  Looking at the PE line up, an Lv1 is got a pretty decent price cut as it's been replaced.  For retailers, if they have stock of something on the shelf it is a cost and it keeps costing them. So it's far from uncommon for a retailer to cut a price pretty deeply (from the consumer perspective) to clear out the inventory when new stuff is coming.   Now, I have no clue if there's a DM16 on the horizon, I just don't follow the industry news like that. So grain of salt and all that.  But - what features at you looking for in your 2nd?"
paintball,3cosox,AcidRaindrops00,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:22:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not really feature hungry, oled is standard these days but I wouldn't even need one, i like adjustable triggers, low profile, lightweight (under 2.5lbs) nice grips, I head for snake or for riot everytime in speedball so ergonomics are a must, I'm a semi-fire player so gun needs to be capable of atleast 20bps semi because I can go steady 16bps semi, clamp feed neck, everything must be easy to access and dismantle, needs to have aftermarket parts available for it, I like to hold my marker close to the body hand over reg on the move and fingers around feed neck for snapping, I guess it's not so much features I'm looking for but quality and advantageous construction."

paintball,3cosox,cptzanzibar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:26:30 2015 UTC,Must you buy new?  Look into a G6R. An OLED model with a slick anno can easily be had for $600 or less. You also have a choice between like 7 different bodies. Bob Long makes great stuff all in the USA. Still family owned too.
paintball,3cosox,vVvRain,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:51:30 2015 UTC,"That's why bob long would always be my go to if I won the lottery. And yea, I'm partial to new because you avoid any possible issues that were caused by owner. It's nothing personal to a seller it's just a safeguard for myself."
paintball,3cosox,cptzanzibar,3,Thu Jul 9 16:54:03 2015 UTC,"I think its an easily acceptable calculated risk. I have bought 1 marker new in my entire 10+ years of playing, the rest have all been used. I will never buy new again. I have bought lots of markers. The worst I have ever seen was a completely wasted top hat oring on a PM6. I got that marker $300 less than retail, in 2006, because the guy couldnt figure out why it was leaking.  The thing with modern paintball markers is their simplicity. Even if something is wrong, its almost always a broken or under lubed oring. You save hundreds of dollars by taking this slight risk. And I do mean slight. Buying new has almost no benefit, aside from saving you from the very minimal chance someone is a huckster selling you broken stuff. Which is a fraction of a percent of the time."

People really think they have no power when something stops working and they dont want to take the time to get it looked at, so they take a huge hit and sell it. I have purposely bought multiple ""broken"" markers. The last one I bought like that was my Vice. Dude said it was leaking down the barrel and he just couldnt figure out why. I bought it for $180. The cup seal was nicked and was covered in lube. I just went ahead and bought and LP poppet, fixed immediately. $200 and I got the best shooting poppet Ive ever owned. I then traded up later and definitely came out on top."

Now as for your question at the end, the truth is all high ends are priced way above their actual cost to make. The companies dont sell enough of them so this is what they do. The truth is most of them can easily lose $500 off their price with no question if their quality at all, just like the impulse did.  What should you buy that fits your criteria? A clone."

paintball,3cosox,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:51:12 2015 UTC,"The two spool valves I'm really looking into are the insight NG for a higher cost I want no questions about the quality and it need to feel like a $1000 gun for me to be happy. The drone, I'm hearing feels all of what it's worth and that's good. If I spend $500+ on a marker I want to feel and experience the quality, my dangerous power Fx has the field performance but none of the high end feel and that disappointed me. If I were to get another poppet the etek-5 seems I be fore-fronting the inguienutity with poppet, but that only tells me the next few poppers that will be released in the future are going to be even better. I don't see why PE didn't use the gas in trigger frame on the etek 5 that's one thing I really like about the newer PE guns. Because the no macro line designs have their issues too."
paintball,3cosox,cptzanzibar,2,Thu Jul 9 19:43:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think the Insight was a flop. However, the Onslaught and Phase fixed all the issues present with the Insight. If I were in the market for a marker, I would probably buy a g6r or a Vic platform with a VIS engine.  There's nothing special about the Etek5. It's made to look like the LV1, but it lacks the crucial part that makes the LV1 what it is (the lever). The Etek 5 is basically on par with the Ego11 in terms of shot quality."
paintball,3cosox,cptzanzibar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:15:32 2015 UTC,"I heard the insight was a flop and bob long himself addressed the issues and the company worked things out with it. Now that it's been on the shelf awhile I can assume one coming from the factory would have it's problems resolved. So, the phase I kind of brushed that one off, it doesn't look like it fits the construction I'm looking for. Looks me bulky and awkward for a bob long gun."
paintball,3cosox,cptzanzibar,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:12:23 2015 UTC,"ehh I'm not 100% sure if the Insight got the updated engine. Basically, you just need to spring mod the Insight and use Monkey Poo and it'll shoot great."
paintball,3cosox,Lunarpancake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 21:41:40 2015 UTC,"The etek5 does nothing new for poppets. Youve got the LV1, which has the lever valve, and the G6R, which is insanely efficient and fully macroless. Those are your poppet front runners."
paintball,3cosox,Lunarpancake,1 point,Thu Jul 9 19:57:58 2015 UTC,"Sorry I meant for mid range, I said price is negotiable but I can't spend up in the $1200 range for a marker. The insight NG would be the priciest one i would get, if it were really all it's worth. I'm not sure how to feel about it because it's priced between mid range and high end so is it a mid grade marker with a bob long price tag or is it a high end marker with a lower price? The drone 2 is right there in my optimal price range and the etek5, used insight ngs, and axe are right there with it. And it's really appealing regardless of price tag and the mid range price makes it all that more appealing. Btw what I like about the etek5 is the ergonomics of the foregrip and the implosion of the lpr for an even lower profile. My FX is hard to beat as far as weight and profile go, online it looks just like an etek but the FX is noticeably smaller and narrower, and it's actually so light that my halo b is really a bad choice for it because it throws it off balance so bad."

From what I read about reviews and the guys at the shop it seems like the way to go. But when I come in and read the comment sections everyone seems to hate it. Why? (remember I'm a noob)"
paintball,3cmduv,JGdirtyWHITE,3,Thu Jul 9 15:46:40 2015 UTC,"Okay, so I will give you the pros and cons of Owning an Etha: Pros: -It's made by PE, so it has amazing customer support. -It comes with goodies (ex. A case, a large parts kit, and a full colored manual). -The parts that are actually metal use the same metal that is on their top-of-the-line markers. -The Etha uses some of the same parts as the PE high ends do and they're made with the same tolerances (ex. the SL3 reg and the Shaft4 barrel) -It comes with an on/off ASA  Now for the Cons: -The trigger frame is composite and feels cheap. -The trigger wiggles around a lot, it squeaks when touching the composite, and it feels cheap overall. -The Etha isn't efficient by any means. -You will hear a ping sound when shot and you will also feel a ping because of the spring that the Etha uses. -The Etha isn't quiet and it has quite a bit of vibration and ""recoil"" when shot. -The Etha's stock barrel bore is .695 which is too big. -I have noticed this, but if you put your finger or hand on either one of the composite eye covers then fire the marker, you will feel the eye cover push back a bit and it is not fun to feel when ramping.  So, you can base your decision off of what I thought of it or get a recommendation from your local proshop. Honestly, I would recommend a Mini GS because it is essentially a tiny Axe."

But after holding the proton and playing with it a little it FELT like a middle range marker rather than a low-mid range which is what it's priced at. It's like $100 cheaper than the etha.

Some thoughts:   too short, usually with a podcast I like to be listening to something for 30mins-1hr. I know it can be hard to find people to talk to you for that long so maybe add a segment of you talking about random paintball topics. Co-host possibly? I know this is also hard- finding someone that wants to host it with you might not be possible depending on your situation but it's a thought. It would allow you to have a longer podcast and banter/discussions with a co-host.   Other than that I thought the interview went well, you asked some good questions. I think the ""microphone presence"" will come with experience (like you pointed out with saying fantastic multiple times)   If you need any help with any graphics (podcast logo, or twitter cover photo or something like that) I may be able to help. I'm by no means a professional but I like to mess around with that kind of stuff and do a bunch of graphics for a website that I run (on a completely different topic).  Hope this was helpful!"

Sufficiently old stuff had a 3 year service life before it needed to be tested and re-certified. But most stuff made within the last decade or so will be 5 years for each cert period.  Any shop cannot legally fill an out of cert tank. Not like ""Oh we shouldn't"" - Like big fines and more. Air at high pressures is no joke - we use it to play games. But it can do some really really really nasty stuff. Blow skin off bones, cause embolisms or strokes as a result of a bubble getting into the circulatory system... or yeah, the bottle could fail catastrophically and basically blow up.   So figure out how old it really is. And then figure out if you want to re-cert it ~$30, but can fail and be decommissioned (they will drill a big hole in it) . Or if you jsut want to buy a new one. 3k bottles are pretty inexpensive now."

So one can use a smaller, and likely lighter, bottle and get the same shot volume endurance.  Safer or more robust? Not necessarily either way - they all need to meet safety criteria."
paintball,3ckisl,Dozernaut,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:18:44 2015 UTC,It's not worth it to get an old steel tank tested.  It's about $20 more to get a new tank (assuming you have a 3000/45 tank)  Might want to get a carbon fiber tank.  A lot lighter than the steel tanks.

That's a pump, so not really much to go wrong with it. if it has the stock pneumatics included and you have some money burning a hole in your pocket, then it might not be a bad buy just to have some fun with or turn into a project gun."

Empire has amazing customer support and their dealer network is extensive. if anything goes wrong with it, take it to your local proshop or call up empire and theyll have you sorted out extremely quickly.  if you're a relatively new player, then i think the most important thing you want in a gun is reliability and customer service. everything else should be secondary to those 2 things so no matter what you can get out on the weekends and play."

You've been posting a considerable number of questions here, which is not inherently bad but shows that you need a tech or someone to sit down with you and get you a solid grounding in maintaining your gear.  The alternative is a good dose of Google and YouTube.  Your ASA is unlikely to be permanently damaged, if so the part is easy enough to order from TippmannParts.com or even direct through Tippmann, if you can't get one through your field.  Should be no more than $10 if memory serves correctly.  Only thing your tank would need if damage is significant enough to replace parts is the bonnet, and at your level you will probably want a field or shop to do this for you.  The vast majority of issues like this can be prevented with knowledge and taking care of your gear accordingly.

They shoot great when they have the correct bore of paint but in stock configuration that can be very rare. Mine doesn't have detents (none due unless modded) so its really hit or miss and the pump stroke is very rough due to the nature of the bolt.

paintball,3chq8e,cornbreadsloth,2,Wed Jul 8 07:08:35 2015 UTC,You could get a used axe or mini they are very reliable and good guns. Or even a older planet eclipse ego. You could get a empire 48 4500 for about 135 bucks but it's a smaller tank. Masks comes down to preference. You could get a used rotor for under a hundred too.
paintball,3chq8e,Stupid_Pink_Dog,2,Wed Jul 8 00:43:00 2015 UTC,"This will give you an excellent, reliable set up that'll shoot ropes and not break.  If you're torn between the mini and axe, get the ax though. Has a on/off asa (great quality of life thing) plus its dump chamber is a bit bigger, meaning it'll be quieter."
paintball,3chq8e,Wozrop,2,Wed Jul 8 04:17:33 2015 UTC,"Well what would you like, there are lots of different styles of gun, and even within a certain class of marker there is no best option.  That said are you looking for a speedball gun or a milsim gun, a speedball gun if you don't know is typically most of the markers that you see on this subreddit, small, tank on the bottom, hopper on the top.  A milsim gun is made to look like a real rifle, not necessarily a specific one like most airsoft guns, but some kind of real rifle, a subsection of milsim is magfed, most people like it for the limited ammo play style, and the more realistic gun.  There are many differ styles of paintball marker and none of them are the best, so we need to know more about what you would want.  At a budget of around $500 you're likely to spend $300-$350 of that on a gun, you've gotta get a mask, tank, and something to hold your extra paintballs, be it pod pack or vest.  In terms of dollar for performance value, you'll want a good mask, you can do a lot better being able to see with a good mask a bad gun, rather than being fogged up with a bad mask and an amazing top of the line gun.  I'd recommend a Dye i4 it's small and light, and has never fogged on me, theres lots of other masks if you want something that fits you better or you prefer more, check YouTube, there's lots of comparison videos out there.  In terms of a tank you've got to get an HPA tank, don't even think about CO2, it will break an electro gun, and the pressure drops off as you use it, plus it gets cold, goes through orings faster and there are more and more fields that just won't fill them anymore.  You'll probably fine to get a 48/3000 aluminum tank, you'll get at least 500 shots out of it.  You say borrowed, I assume from a friend, if there are a couple of things that you really enjoyed, maybe ask to buy them, Depending on the gun you'd probably want something different, and you also want a good mask but a pod pack, extra pods, barrel swab/squeegee, those would be great to pick up for next to nothing used.  Other than that, let me know if you have any questions, an. Make sure you get what you want, not what someone tells you is the best, these will be suggestions, take a good look at any of them and their competitors, I don't really care at all if you buy my favourite gun, I just hope it's your favourite gun"
paintball,3chq8e,SaltySalad69,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:51:23 2015 UTC,"I would recommend a used axe or etek 3 or 4. Like stated before, masks are all about preference. My recommendation would be to go down to your local store and try on all the masks they have and see which one suites you the best. Don't buy a used tank. Used rotors are good."
paintball,3chq8e,imanAholebutimfunny,1 point,Wed Jul 8 02:12:25 2015 UTC,"lets see through ebay, you can get a used axe for around 300, a rotor around 100 and a 68-45 carbon fiber tank at around 60-100 depending on brand and hydro. i like i4s so you can get them at around 60-130 dpending on quality. but marker and mask i would say are the most important things."

paintball,3cife6,Seaskimmer,2,Wed Jul 8 11:31:31 2015 UTC,You could check out bob long insight. There an little older so you can big a base model for probably 350 to 400 upgraded one maybe 450 to 500. They have crazy efficiency for a spool around 10+ on a 4k 68 fill. Downside their lube hogs and need more maintenance. Also depending on what your looking at I believe YourPbFriend.com's YouTube channel does some pretty air efficiency tests.
paintball,3cife6,lacquerhead901,2,Wed Jul 8 04:49:37 2015 UTC,"If efficiency is your key metric, you should seriously be considering a Bob Long G6R. There isnt anything, as far as modern markers go, that is more efficient."

paintball,3cife6,novonn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:18:22 2015 UTC,"Alright, I am on mobile, but I will explain. You will have to search these specific markers for images.  There are two types of markers, poppers or spoolies.  A marker with a spool mechanism would be like a Geo 3.5, Luxe 2.0, etc. They usually feature a ""easy bolt removal"" ideal in which you can pull out the whole bolt mechanism with the push of a button or switch and easily perform maintenance (see Axe or Shocker RSX.) The bolt is one assembly that can be pulled out as one. Spoolies are generally quieter with a softer thud. They have few moving parts, but... they also do need more lubing and oring replacements than others. Finally spoolies use more air than poppets, making them less air efficient.  Poppets have more moving parts. Some poppets are Eteks, Egos, Lv1, JT Impulse. The ""rammer"" is the moving ""bolt"" inside the body of the marker, but the ACTUAL bolt that hits the ball is attached to the rammer and is above the rammer unit. So this makes poppets more air efficient. They also require less maintaining with fewer orings generally. But the sound of a poppet is loud and snappy (besides a high-end poppet such as the Lv1.)"
paintball,3cife6,deogi,1 point,Wed Jul 8 04:41:46 2015 UTC,"Thanks a lot! Honestly, I think I'm going for an AXE. I can stand doing more maintenance, and I think less moving parts and less sound make the (hopefully slight) increase in air consumption worth it."
paintball,3cife6,FukinGruven,2,Wed Jul 8 04:53:07 2015 UTC,The axe is a poppet.
paintball,3cife6,novonn,1 point,Wed Jul 8 06:44:26 2015 UTC,"It is, but it does have the easy bolt removal mechanism where the entire system pops out the back of the marker with a button press. It's a poppet valve, but a hybrid bolt system."
paintball,3cife6,wallyg12345,1 point,Wed Jul 8 13:20:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah the kick on spoolies are generally smaller also, forgot to mention that (besides a Lv1.)   BE SURE to test out the Axe. Some people do not like the foregrip, they say it feels awkward. Others are perfectly fine with it. So either go into a pro-shop and hold some markers, or request from whomever your buying from that when you meet up, you can hold the marker first and try it.  Edit: another user said that the Axe is a poppet, which is true, but the Axe is an in-line poppet."

paintball,3cgflb,flyinpanda,2,Tue Jul 7 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling most everyone will tell you to save your money. If we're talking about taking apart the gun and just doing a basic clean n relube it's worth it to do it yourself.  You've indicated $35 would cover any included repairs. I'm not sure what falls under ""included repairs."" My guess is nothing major, prob o-rings and things of that nature. I would only consider that option if I knew that there would be lots of little things to replace / fix and I was short on time and looking to play real soon.  TLDR - Take it apart yourself, clean and lube - your manual or an online manual can help you figure it out real easy."
paintball,3cgflb,Celox1,2,Tue Jul 7 19:28:41 2015 UTC,For 35 bucks you could buy enough lube and rebuild kits to keep it going for years to come.
paintball,3cgflb,Session99,2,Tue Jul 7 19:58:50 2015 UTC,"I literally had the same thing happen this summer with a PM5. Took it out after about 7 years, replaced all the o-rings, annnnnnd, that was it. It shoots perfectly still. I would at least give that a try before taking it in."
paintball,3cgflb,TardyTheTurtle_,2,Tue Jul 7 20:14:27 2015 UTC,"Was it working when you put it up? Put a fresh battery in it, and see how it shoots man.  I wouldn't recommend just replacing all the orings as some might suggest. Replace it if it's leaking, if its not then leave it. With a matrix you actually want those orings to wear in, and it takes a little while for them to do that. With worn in orings the gun will be smoother, more consistent, and more efficient."
paintball,3cgflb,socks86,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:10:11 2015 UTC,"This is what I would do. Visually check to see if any are corroded, air it up and fix things as they present themselves."
paintball,3cgflb,Aidspanda,1 point,Wed Jul 8 12:36:32 2015 UTC,"a proto should be relatively easy to clean because it is not as intricate as other markers. replacing o ring, lubing it up, cleaning the reg,and a fresh battery should do the trick. plus once you work on a gun it is easier to troubleshoot problems."

paintball,3cdbhl,Buwaro,10,Tue Jul 7 01:30:44 2015 UTC,"Its smaller...  But serious answer, it shoots at the same velocity but the balls are much lighter so the impact force (and therefore pain) is lower."
paintball,3cdbhl,BurningPlaydoh,9,Tue Jul 7 02:23:54 2015 UTC,"In addition to that, having less mass behind them causes them to not travel as far as 68 cal making them less than ideal for bigger fields."

paintball,3cdbhl,Buwaro,2,Tue Jul 7 10:39:27 2015 UTC,At my field they have both. Sometimes I like to play 50 just because there are way less people playing and I get to run more than on a field with 100+ players. So I have both setups.
paintball,3cdbhl,theRealCrazy,4,Tue Jul 7 13:57:39 2015 UTC,Has it really gotten that popular?
paintball,3cdbhl,red_subie,5,Tue Jul 7 00:52:54 2015 UTC,At my field... Sadly yes.  New and timid players seem to love it.  It was a fun casual day of PB but nothing I'd want to do on the regular.
paintball,3cdbhl,red_subie,7,Tue Jul 7 00:56:13 2015 UTC,That's no good. I'm not against 50 cal but I don't like the thought of it being the standard at fields.
paintball,3cdbhl,BurningPlaydoh,4,Tue Jul 7 01:40:32 2015 UTC,"Why not?  Lower ""pain"" factor for new players, renters can carry more paint, keeps gun owners/renters separated, etc."
paintball,3cdbhl,red_subie,7,Tue Jul 7 02:22:40 2015 UTC,"Like I said, I'm not against it. I think it's great for younger kids or people with a low pain tolerance. But the fact that there is a field that had only three 68 cal players show and the rest where 50 cal makes me worry that maybe one day 50 cal will be the standard. Maybe not for several years though."
paintball,3cdbhl,BurningPlaydoh,9,Tue Jul 7 02:29:53 2015 UTC,"I think you've got the cause and effect reversed.  .50 is getting people into a activity/hobby that fewer and fewer are investing in.  Right now the rental market is what is making money for the industry as a whole.  Too few gun owners, and too many fields for that to really be a very profitable section of the market."

And if youve played since 2000 you must remember one of the big reasons ROF limits were imposed as well."

Anyway, here goes:  Red Sunrise  Pros:   Body appears clean Has matching Aardvark frame and trigger Has matching Trinity LPR Milled for eyes, usually indicating nice aftermarket board inside. The only ones that fit that frame without milling is the Tadao 5.0 and Vaporworks Chaos. Both are good. Has AKA Sidewinder HPR   (Minor) cons:   Missing Aardvark grips (but Dye stickies are super comfy so w/e) Missing lexan window. Appears to be aluminum sleeve. Or it could be a bad camera angle. Non clamping feedneck   That gun should happily list for $850 in my estimation.    Silver/Gray Sunrise  Pros:   Small picture but looks super clean. Hope it still looks like that. Matching Aardvark frame Original Aardvark grips! Yeah! Aardvark bullet volumizers are cool as hell and always will be Matching Aardvark Trinity LPR Like red one, milled for eyes likely indicating aftermarket Tadao or Vaporworks board.   (Minor) cons:   Missing lexan window. Clearly has red aluminum sleeve. Non-matching NDZ breech and VAA. It's like they were trying for the red accents with the red bolt kit and sleeve, but it just ends up making the rest of the gun look sad.   Without knowing more and seeing current higher res pictures I'd put list that one at $900  FYI for both there are market fluctuations, and supply and demand can really mess with collector guns like these. There are only about 50 Sunrises out there anyway, so they don't pop up super often."

I dont even play in a jersey other than tourneys really, and wear pants that dont even have padding in them because they are then lighter and more breathable.  Proto pants are super durable, $15 is a nice deal if theyre in good condition and fit you.  Some people like volleyball-type kneepads for paintball too.

paintball,3cff3n,kapyrna,2,Tue Jul 7 15:05:28 2015 UTC,Do you have money to throw. Go tiberius. Otherwise tipx.   I Have a tipx. It's good for cqb. But dont expect to hit people far awar without a remote. That applies for both.  Changing the co2 cartridges has become an issue for me because it is my main marker. So I decide to add a remote adapter.  The cons with the tiberius one is the ha dle is bigger for some people and the magazines are more expensive but they are made of metal. The tipx ones are made of plastic.  The video has way more info. Look for it Try to look for them at a store.  Each has pros and cons
paintball,3cff3n,ldks,2,Tue Jul 7 16:30:59 2015 UTC,"I recommend the Tippmann TiPX. The gun is great, has a great warranty, and you can upgrade it to shoot First Strike rounds if you want the option.  The mags are cheaper, and come in a 2 pack making it more frugal as well.  Also, Tiberius as a company isn't doing so hot right now. Their products are slow to arrive, and more people are quitting there HQ. This tells me that parts will be harder, and harder to get.  Go with Tippmann. Go ol' reliable Tippmann."
paintball,3cff3n,S-Archer,2,Tue Jul 7 18:01:12 2015 UTC,":( Some people in this thread are just dumping out personal preferences.  The two biggest differences are magazine size and where the 12g CO2 canister goes. If you can handle 8 rounds and want CO2 in the magazine. If you want 10 round in the magazine and want CO2 in the body.  I thought (I do not know) changing CO2 mid-match with the TIPX would be a pain so I bought a T8.1. I am happy with this decision thus far. I will get a TIPX eventually because I think it is cool also. If you feel different buy different, the only person living with your decision is you.  I think the inner workings of the TIPX are simpler. That can be good or bad. The T8.1 has more complexity but it is incredibly well engineered. The magazine for it has more parts than a Spyder Hammer 7 but the T8.1 is easily more reliable. The TIPX is made by Tippmann so it would be reliable too. The main gun has more than 40 parts before taking apart the regulator. I mention this because it affects durability but so far not in a bad way. I run through muddy creeks and jam crap in the barrel jumping in into the brush and the T8.1 has not misfired because of it. It has screwed up when I have failed to reassemble it though. So far this has cost me one game (because I kept test firing without the barrel even though I new it is what holds tension on the bolt) and saved me another (because my Axe is a maintenance nightmare and I used this instead).  I cannot speak well or ill of its accuracy or range. My eyes are terrible  at distance and I use the T8.1 only when I do not want to wear glasses this limits my range to about 30 feet. Inside that range I can reliably hit mask sized targets with single shots.  As for fire rate it will shoot as fast as the trigger is pulled, when I have chosen to do. I think I can empty the magazine in a second or two, but have not timed it.  I would love to hear responses from TIPX owners on the complexity of maintenance. I am also curious about the air efficiency of the TIPX (I can reliably get more than 24 shots from the T8.1) even though OP is not concerned.  Edit --  To expand on reassembly, there are a couple key facts to remember about the T8.1 that save me time and effort. Always fully reassemble it, it cannot easily be tested in parts. When reassembling always push the bolt past the trigger and insert the barrel last, this is import to correctly position the sear."
paintball,3cff3n,Sqeaky,2,Tue Jul 7 22:02:52 2015 UTC,"TiPX maintenance is pretty simple. Like the Tiberius as long as you put it back together right, no problems at all. It takes 10 minutes if I want to take it apart and clean/relube internals and put it back together.  Efficiency wise it's not that great, about 2.5 7-round mags  per 12g. I run a remote because changing 12g's is a bitch especially mid game."

paintball,3cff3n,loinfroth,1 point,Wed Jul 8 03:10:55 2015 UTC,Why is it a huge pain to reassemble?
paintball,3cff3n,Sqeaky,2,Wed Jul 8 16:43:53 2015 UTC,"because the breach is spring-loaded and tries to abort itself unless you screw the barrel in thru the front block. Both detent and the stupid top acrylic window stub keeps falling out and you have to remember to reinsert them, and you have to unscrew the remote line adapter from the gun reg which often shreds the tiny oring as there is no chamfer in the hole. As someone who fabricates mechanical and electronic things, TPX is absolute horrible shit to maintain. Tiberius is also shit, but not as massive turd as TPX. I own both."
paintball,3cff3n,loinfroth,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:45:51 2015 UTC,Shredded orings sounds like a pain.  Are either so bad you regret your purchases?
paintball,3cff3n,Sqeaky,2,Thu Jul 9 16:19:39 2015 UTC,"Other than 10 pound overbuilt magazines, and stovepipe sized grip, Tiberius is an excellent gun. TPX on the other hand is cheaply made, unreliable, slow shooting, paint chopping POS. Tiberius was designed by FN Herstal, TPX was designed by a monkey working for Tippmann. If you swap the engine in TPX with one from TCR it becomes a decent marker."

My friend went out to a MagFed meet and even though she's pretty petite, the 8.1 worked for her using the stock mags and First Strikes."

paintball,3cfedl,JGdirtyWHITE,1 point,Tue Jul 7 14:13:40 2015 UTC,"APE didn't make a board for the FX. STORY TIME:  APE made boards for the REV-i guns. For the FX, DP basically ripped off the ape boards. APE got pissed at this (obviously) and didn't make boards for the FX.  That being said, the FX board is pretty much an APE board, so even if they did make an FX board, there isn't much you would gain from it over the stock one.   FXs are actually great guns. I used one as my primary for many years. I even got a Etek 4 and preferred my FX over it. If you want to get the most out of your gun, then your best upgrades would be the TechT bolt and RAM. I've worked on many FXs and each time the problem seems to be from improper care.   If you need a board, I doubt DP will restock them as they have probably moved on to the F Elite and wont be making stuff for the FX. Your best bet is probably finding someone who has a broken FX but working board."

Anyway that's kind of counter productive to not make a board for a gun just because the factory board is kind of like the apes, if anything that's more of a reason. On DP's end of it, that's pretty shitty customer service. So they just don't care about boards anymore because of the FE? The FX isn't old at all I got mine in 2012 and otherwise it works perfectly.

When I google aftermarkets for fx I think like the first link is the ape rampage for the fusion on ansgear ""fx"" is a tagged word but on the website it just says fusion board.   Seventh Element made an aftermarket board for the FX. There were problems with them though (IIRC the micro-switches were completely messed up making the board useless, but 7E said they would fix them, so perhaps they did and/or shipped good ones). Problem now is the 7E is out of business. You may have luck with someone who has both a 7E board and Stock board and willing to sell one.    Anyway that's kind of counter productive to not make a board for a gun just because the factory board is kind of like the apes, if anything that's more of a reason.    DP pretty much stole APE's programming. Think of it this way, most computers run on Windows. If company XYZ decides to rip off Windows and sell their computers with their of software rip-off, you think Microsoft is going to support them? Sure, it sucks for the end consumer, but that's business.   But really, I have an APE board in my G3 Spec R, and comparing it to the FX board, I actually have to say DP did a good job copying it. The average Joe wouldn't even be able to tell the difference.    On DP's end of it, that's pretty shitty customer service. So they just don't care about boards anymore because of the FE? The FX isn't old at all I got mine in 2012 and otherwise it works perfectly. I should be able to except a $500 marker to last more than a couple years with moderate use, and if not atleast be able to get replacement parts.   DP has become known for their shitty customer service. I haven't had to work with them lately, so I don't know if things are turning around (supposedly they are). The FX is a 2010 gun, and while technically DP ran with it as their main poppet until the FE came out, it really isn't a surprise they aren't supporting it too much now. If you haven't already, try calling them directly to see if they have a board they can ship you.   A lot of people will come in and say that DP are shit guns, and I agree they did have some issues with tolerances, but I've never came across a gun that had a factory issue I couldn't fix (outside of board issues, but those are pretty few and far between). The problem is that their price range is perfect for new players so plenty of people who don't know how to work on guns end up buying them. The FX did have issue with dim screens, but that was the only consistent issue I saw. Basically, if you know how to work on PB guns, DPs are great options.  Many people don't know this, but the DP G series and the Planet Eclipse Geos (most especially the Geo 1) are the same internal base design. PE has highly refined their guns more than DP, and the higher internal volume is better, but otherwise very similar operation. PE has better tolerance issues, and they build their guns to be work horses, but they also cost 4 times as much."

A pair that fits right for me may be as comfortable on you. I've tried Eclipse pads and GI pads and I prefer the GI pads over the Eclipse.

You carry less rounds then if you were using a hopper and pods typically, makes you think about your shots more as you can't just dump paint down a lane. Also depending on the field and gun setup you have you can use first strike rounds opposed to regular .68 cal paintballs. These rounds cost more then regular paint but travel further and are much more accurate. Again all about the style of play you are looking for, and what is fun to you."

The earlier suggestion of TM-7 or -15 is still better in your price ranges though.

A big knock on them is you can start spending money on them and before you know it dumped enough money into it where you could of had a much nicer marker. One think to keep in mind most upgrade are going to be purely cosmetic and for comfort, and affect the actual performance of the marker."

To disconnect front solenoid   Unplug the front solenoid cable Unplug the eyes   To Remove Front block   Remove bolt pin and bolt Remove cocking rod Remove the pump arm from the RAM Use an allen key and remove the front banjo screw (it's the big one in the middle) You can just unscrew it a little and move the frontblock forward little by little until the banjo comes off   Now you install the pump kit. Put the cocking rod back, put the bolt/pin back.   Now you can use your electronic frame with your pump kit. Be careful, you can shoot with out having the pump handle all the way forward which will cause you to chop since the shooting mechanism isn't tied to the cocking mechanism."

My other hoppers have been a Prophecy, Pulse RDR and a Rotor.    The HK sits lower but a little further back.  First time I picked it up in the case I thought there wasn't a hopper in it.  No jams.    Feeding down to the last ball is a little funky and dropping a pod in is a little odd, kinda like the spire you almost have to tilt it forward for full capacity.    Case design is very similar to the rotor but the feed system is different.    It will still feed if the batteries go dead."

Probably put ~20 cases through it, haven't had a single issue. 2 AA's batteries makes it unreal light, it has a lower profile than any other loader. I haven't jammed a ball yet. I used to use a Rotor and that thing could not feed small paint; the TFX handles is brilliantly. KLR is a love-hate thing, the Zero-G pack is solid but the TFX is truly the best product they've put out.  edit: oxford comma  edit #2: I have only ever used it with the speedfeed - not sure about /u/r45vt feeding issues.

paintball,3cdgha,walkoffaith,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:04:05 2015 UTC,I bought one. Was really on the fence about them. Honestly they are the best loader hands down. No issues ans I'm really impressed by both hks quality on this but also their customer service. My teammate fucked his up. Completely his fault. (He unscrewed the tension screw and lost it.) Nabi at the hk booth gave him his to use until he fixed it and just let my boy keep the new tfx. I would recommend it hands down over everything I've used including the spire.
paintball,3cdgha,clamchou,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:00:44 2015 UTC,Own one very could like it better than the rotor honestly. It seems more  balanced than my rotor plus the 2 batteries is nice. Interview with hk said that down the road there coming out with different body styles. Same interview they said around 20k shots off 2 batteries because of the on/off micro switch.  If your looking at one highly suggest picking one up.

Always used either a HALO B or as of recently the prophecy.  switched to the TFX, and so far i like it.  Bought a speed feed, its a little stiff.  let a pod sit in it for about 2-3 hours while I went to a meeting one day, and seems fine now.  the only thing i dont like is the little ""ramp tray"" at the front of the loader, when there is multiple balls it moves down, but when they start to feed, the platform rises, since there might be tension on it from 20 balls wen i gets to one or two they kind of get stuck on there.  maybe a stronger spring, but so far i like it.  No jams no issues losing paint on the speed feed.  the speed feed lid didnt pop when i dove.  i would reccomend!"

Understand though, if you happen to be one of the unlucky ones, and the lens pops and you lose an eye, the news story will not be, ""Man wearing known defective paintball mask loses an eye, but don't worry all the other masks on the market are safe."" It will say that a man wearing proper eye protection loses an eye playing paintball. That's what the public will see and use it to judge our sport and become fearful of our sport. It will dwindle our appeal, make parents not let their kids play, and put yet another stigma on paintball that we don't need.

Skip the Co2 tank, it's useless in today's PB world, get a HPA tank. As for a mask, the Profits are ok, but I think the Valken annex Mi9 are better than the profits and half the price. Vest is not needed. The hopper is very important, I will offer 3 suggestions. My first choice would be a Dye Rotor, arguably the best available, but they are expensive so it is understandable to go with a cheaper loader for your first setup. Option 2 would be the empire halo too, it's less expensive and is a solid all around loader. Option 3 would be a Proto Primo hopper, its about as good as you can get in terms of gravity fed hoppers."

It has one of the best, if not the best triggers on the market(feels like the Luxe, just different profile){triggers are preference}.    I had my Etek 5 and Tippmann TCR shit the bed by 2 cases or 2 magazines in the case of the TCR.... The shocker has not missed a beat.  Its not as quiet as the Luxe OLED and would compare level with a Geo 3.1.   The 3.5 with the core IV is slightly smoother and quieter.    It does need to be lubed after every outing.  It takes 15 seconds.. the bolt is super easy to pull and lube.  If you don't lube it you'll get some inconsistency.     They put some effort into the bolt to make it feel smooth and it shows.  Anyone who says its just an Ion bolt hasn't shot it.  Highly refined, yet simple.  You can adjust the bolt speed to change the feel of it too.  I got 1k shots off a 3k fill on a 68cu tank.

Feels like a Geo, smooth but can still feel the shot. It sounds similar too.   How much cleaning do you need to and how difficult is it after a day on the field?   The engine design is based on the Ion - a gun designed for new players to not need much maintenance. While it's not a Geo and won't just work all the time, the maintenance is very minimal. A couple of lubed orings and it's fine and they're easy to see cause the engine is so miminal.   Have you ever had any problems with the marker?   I personally don't like how small it is. Idk if that's a ""problem"" but I like some heft and substance to the gun. The foregrip is also really small. That being said no a couple of the HK teams and a guy on our team used them throughout the WCPPL Oceanside event and since then and they seem to be fine.   Whats your favorite part about the shocker?   It's $800? That's a pretty good thing. If I were in the market to buy a new gun, I'd buy a Luxe. If I wasn't going to buy a balanced spool gun, I'd have to chose between a Geo and a Shocker and at almost half the price, I'd always shoot a Shocker.  edit: formatting"
paintball,3cb78r,walkoffaith,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:22:11 2015 UTC,I think those with foregrip gripes could be full wrapping their hand around the foregrip.   Those that barrel thumb wrap over the barrel might not have the same problem.    The issue I had with the AXE was that the foregrip is squared off so when I barrel wrap  it's not comfortable for me.

paintball,3cblhd,WoodSorrow,5,Mon Jul 6 17:17:39 2015 UTC,"I think the most common thing you hear about NTs is ""They're good guns... when they work"".  the NT design is a pretty big departure from the DM design which is very well designed bolt thats been slowly getting refined and better for over a decade. the NT10 design was known to be finicky/unreliable and generally needed someone who really understood the design and function of the gun to make it a good, reliable shooter. the NT11 fixed a lot of the issues of the NT10, but ultimately the design still wasn't as reliable or idiot proof as the DM series. just a lot of variables to play with since you have bolt inserts and can spacers also in the mix when you tweak and troubleshoot it. the biggest reason the NT died was because at the time they came out, DMs were still regarded as some of the best guns on the market, especially for spool guns. the NT was less reliable, less smooth, and more complicated than DMs so the NT kind of just died off.  Anyways, i think $350-425 is a fair range to pay for a nice, working, and well cared for NT11.  Parts should still be available for it, but you're going to be buying used most likely. you could also call Dye and ask their tech's what their NT parts situation is. they will likely outright tell you how many parts they still have in stock for the NTs."
paintball,3cblhd,alizaman,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:46:14 2015 UTC,So it's kind of the SLG of high ends?
paintball,3cblhd,zakharov435,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:54:35 2015 UTC,"NT's are great guns. They are pretty sensitive to adjustments, so they can be challenging to work on if you're not used to them. 400 is a bit on the high side, but if it's in good condition it'd be ok. My NT10 has never let me down, so perhaps I'm a bit biased. As far as parts go, all you really need are o rings, plunger bumpers, reg seats and maybe a spare spring or two."
paintball,3cblhd,zakharov435,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:43:54 2015 UTC,Do you think a DM12 for 400USD is a better deal?
paintball,3cblhd,zakharov435,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:55:01 2015 UTC,"The NT will have better efficiency, the DM will shoot smoother. Not that the NT is kicky or anything. My personal choice is the NT, but YMMV."
paintball,3cblhd,socks86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:00:01 2015 UTC,Yeah I guess the NT was kind of marketed towards poppet owners.  Why do you prefer the NT? Is it just the efficiency?
paintball,3cblhd,socks86,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"The efficiency is just a bonus. If all I wanted was efficiency, I could easily pick up a g6r or something. The NT has felt better in my hands, and shot better, than any other gun I've shot. Add on to that the fact that I've had exactly zero issues with the gun since I got it, and I get kinda sentimental about it :)  Edit: A tip if you ever decide to get one. Look for one where the chamber that the plunger sits in opens easily. If it doesn't open easily, you're gonna have a bad time."
paintball,3cblhd,GoldyGoldy,2,Mon Jul 6 21:40:02 2015 UTC,"The NT's seem to be a little bit too specific for me, i.e. ""look for one that is like x, not y"" ""when they work, they work"". I'd rather just spend 600 on a DM14 than spend 400 on an NT and be pissed, you know?"

paintball,3car2a,SiriusCybernetics,4,Mon Jul 6 16:01:09 2015 UTC,The drone 2 is a great bargain in the price to performance department and I think that will be your best option. I think you can find them for 400-450 on pbn if you look hard enough. Macdev is also really coming into its own as a customer service company and is leaps and bounds better than it has been in the past.
paintball,3car2a,Kabosui,3,Mon Jul 6 13:26:10 2015 UTC,"If you're fine with used, I'd suggest looking into a Bob long marq or victory. They are very quiet, light weight, efficient, and your price range. They're more maintenance heavy, but not much compared to a cocker.         Of what you listed though, I'd go for the drone."
paintball,3car2a,Averageboi,3,Mon Jul 6 13:23:00 2015 UTC,Used g6r. $350-500+ depending on year and milling. Most efficient marker on the market and shoots as smooth as a lv1.You shoot a cocker so you already know what maintenance and tuning are.

paintball,3car2a,deogi,2,Mon Jul 6 16:08:02 2015 UTC,"Those three markers will all perform at a tournament ready level out on the field. With that being the case, the decision between the three really comes down to personal preference. If possible I would suggest trying to get to a pro shop to hold all three markers and whichever feels most natural in your hand go with. When it comes down to it, all of them will shoot 10.2 bps at a consistent 280fps and be a reliable marker as long as you maintain it. Personally, if I were buying new I would pick up the Drone as it is loaded with features and is a great value. However, a used Axe can easily be found for ~250$ and you get a ton of marker for your money."
paintball,3car2a,Lepadep,2,Mon Jul 6 13:31:31 2015 UTC,Just played with my drone 2 this weekend. Great gun-would highly recommend.
paintball,3car2a,A_Zed_Head,2,Mon Jul 6 13:50:35 2015 UTC,"Well if you want something quieter, the Drone, Etek and Axe are definitely not the way to go. Especially the Drone and Etek, they're loud as fuck. The Axe isn't the loudest poppet out there, but it's still a poppet.  Spool valves will be much quieter (the Drone is probably the loudest one out there), a used DM14 (I think those go for $500, if not then the 13 does). That or a 2015 Proto Reflex Rail (bonus, parts are compatible with the DM's). Used Luxe's would work too. Not sure how much Vanquish 1.5's go for either, but they're nice spoolies as well."

paintball,3car2a,NHDraven,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:27:10 2015 UTC,I have an axe as my backup and its stock i believe. thing is very quiet and very little kick. i find it to be very consistent with breakdown maintenance to be very easy. Also with the axe are available bolt and body upgrades as well as an lcd board different triggers interchangeable parts with a mini. There are just alot of pros with it versus cons if any.
paintball,3car2a,imanAholebutimfunny,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:08:41 2015 UTC,"The etek is very similar to the eblade but super loud.

I would suggest something like a spool valve, macdev, dm, luxe, if you want a smooth and quiet shot."
paintball,3car2a,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:07:56 2015 UTC,"Why would you ""lean towards the drone, because I have never shot one""?    The Etek is not like an autococker so that is not a good comparison.   If everyone has an axe, it means that that they are popular because they work, are cheap, and can probably be fixed locally.    Rethink your logic.  The Etek is rock solid and is a good low maintenance gun."

paintball,3cb0bz,nileo2005,5,Mon Jul 6 14:37:34 2015 UTC,Yep. CO2 for most basic markers will be just fine.  It's when we start getting into the more fragile rapid shooting electro flavor of marker that it can do real damage. CO2 in the bottle is mostly liquid and converts to gas. That conversion requires energy. That's why CO2 bottles get cold when used to supply a lot of gas. So those temp drops - down to or below freezing are terrible for the itty bitty bits in fancy electros. And forbid should liquid CO2 get out of the bottle... That would spell the end for much of the internal workings on many a fancy shooter  But your 98 has none of that stuff. It was designed in an era where co2 was super common and will be just fine

Yeah we have OC, but truthfully we've never had a day out there that was really anything more than messing around.

paintball,3c81ws,blahkbox,2,Sun Jul 5 20:16:24 2015 UTC,"If you want a 50rd, get the APP gravity fed. If you want 100rd, get the new Sportshot made by Extreme Rage, iirc.

paintball,3c81ws,mazu747,2,Mon Jul 6 08:24:32 2015 UTC,"Came here expecting someone to ask that. Was not disappointed.  It's because you're basically guaranteed to have one in the hole, you never have to shake it. Some people like a high ball count, it will last one or two rounds without reloading, where a 50 round hopper might not without carrying pods (which is really nice to not carry around a pod pack). In speedball you can twist the marker (especially useful for Doritos players) and it will still feed.  EDIT: I forgot to mention it helps balance out the marker if you got any regular, non-13/3000 tank."
paintball,3c81ws,Fuzznutz14,2,Sun Jul 5 23:21:48 2015 UTC,Its not about the speed it feeds. Its all about the force pushing the paintball into the breach and always knowing that your next shot will be there no matter what.  Id use a Rotor over any gravity fed hopper any day of the week.

Since i played counterstrike competitively for a few years, i use the same quick peak strategies and A LOT of people camp and are not aggressive.  Communication is always the most important thing because one wrong call or not calling when someone bumps up and then there goes three of your teammates.   Yes there are certain roles that you can play depending on your physical and mental ability like rushing and pinning people down.  I have not use walkies or coms but it can improve game play depending on how you utilize them within your group of people.  Yes there are many different strategies and breakout techniques that come into play when playing speedball. There are too many to describe but watching professional matches you will see what i am talking about.  Personally, this is the closest thing, other than airsoft, that you can get to hunting down people and ""killing"" them as opposed to the extreme.

paintball,3c96uc,Pacostaco123,3,Mon Jul 6 01:51:46 2015 UTC,"I would get an older PM/DM if I had to pick from this list. A marker that used to cost $1,000 back in the day is arguably still better than newer budget guns like the mini. I had a mini and I honestly wasn't a big fan of it aside from the shot quality. Ergronomically it wasn't very comfortable, but that is probably because I am a bigger guy. As for the ego, meh. I wouldn't go for it unless you find a really good deal on like an 08-9 ego at least. The older egos weigh too much, guzzle too much air, and kick a little too much for my liking. However, if you like a gun with a little kick I do have to admit they are fun to play with. An older DM/pm might be a bit heavy and not the best in terms of air efficiency, but they shoot very very nice! Another option you could consider which would be my personal pick would be a used axe. Basically, the axe is a mini on steroids and a lot of the issues that the mini had empire fixed with the axe. Nice shot quality, decent air efficiency, good ergonomics, and great bang for your buck value overall. That is my two cents anyways. I am sure someone else on here probably has a different opinion, but this is just from my personal experience."
paintball,3c96uc,Jojo_PB,1 point,Mon Jul 6 03:33:32 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. The only other thing I was considering was this ad  on Craigslist:   https://cleveland.craigslist.org/spo/5098548619.html  Any merit to this? I'm guessing not.  I hear g4s were unreliable as hell but they fixed the problems in the g5.
paintball,3c96uc,Jojo_PB,2,Mon Jul 6 09:21:13 2015 UTC,"That deal isn't too shabby. Dangerous power does have problems with their guns if they aren't treated with utmost care. However, they are great guns aside from reliability. You could get it and then learn a thing or two about common paintball gun problems which isn't a bad thing, but just know if you get it you might encounter a few problems every once and a while. Once again they aren't bad guns and they shoot pretty nice, but count on tinkering with it occasionally. I would still pick the Empire Axe over it, but if that isn't an option that isn't a bad alternative."
paintball,3c96uc,Aidspanda,3,Mon Jul 6 14:42:27 2015 UTC,"Pbnation is an excellent forum if you're looking for deals on used marker and gear. Lots of people complain about the attitude on the forums, but I've found that if you're polite and friendly more often then not you will be met with the same. Feedback is God on there so you'd more than likely be paying first. BE SURE TO SEND THE MONEY FOR GOODS AND SERVICES IN PAYPAL. That way you will have buyers protection through PayPal.  Other places to look are MCB forums or eBay although the latter can be hit or miss. R/paintballbst has the occasional deal as well.  As far as markers - Any of the markers mentioned will do fine in most situations.  The invert mini is a modern option on the cheap - I found it to be too small in my hands and was unimpressed with the shot. Great bang for the buck.  Egos are tanks - my main shooter is an LV1. However the older ones have a louder sound signature and a bit of a crack to the shot (read kick) I'm partial to the 8 and 11s due to the thicker grip frame and more robust solenoid. Any of the SL editions get some major style points too.  DMs are arguably the best shooting guns ever made, but they can be a nightmare to tech sometimes. In my personal opinion the PM8 is the best buy of the line as it uses the modern eye pipe and bolt system of the dm8-12 and (I put a billy wing bolt in mine)  I'd say find a deal you like and pull the trigger. Run it by us here before you pull the trigger if you like, but it really comes down to what you wanna be mowing muppets with."

paintball,3c96uc,QuantumEgg,2,Mon Jul 6 20:50:43 2015 UTC,"Recently bought a marker on here from another user. This is how the process worked for me. They send you an invoice. After opening it in your email, you sign in to your PayPal account and review it. Now PayPal as an additional 3% fee. This is the protection fee. (So if something does get screwed up, or they scam you, PayPal reimburses you, or something like that). You pay for it and then they hopefully ship your your item(s).

paintball,3c96uc,Aidspanda,2,Mon Jul 6 22:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm always afraid of scam. Can't really help you with a used tank though, sorry."
paintball,3c96uc,Jojo_PB,2,Tue Jul 7 00:56:57 2015 UTC,"You can pick up good tanks for ~$80 with at least three years left on hydro. Just be sure the gel coating isn't cracked and none of the fibers are exposed for carbon fiber tanks. For aluminum tanks, they can be had new for $30-50 online."
paintball,3c96uc,Aidspanda,2,Tue Jul 7 04:16:51 2015 UTC,If you pay for goods or services and they don't deliver you can file a claim through PayPal. The fees are covered by the seller in that situation so you don't have to worry about it.
paintball,3c8ph9,lukasubo,2,Sun Jul 5 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"My friend and his brother both got the Cronus and they like the gun. They are more into woodsball and like the look and feel of guns that are more ""realistic"" looking. I personally would go with the project salvo if you are looking for a gun that has more realism to it. I got one and it worked perfectly. No chopping, pretty easy maintenance, and it uses all the same customization and parts as a tippman 98 custom. I know the Cronus has few if any upgrades.  It does shoot pretty well though. He ran the same tank you are looking at with a regular gravity hopper since it's just a mechanical gun an electric hopper isn't really necessary at this point"
paintball,3c8ph9,Tang_Slap,1 point,Mon Jul 6 15:19:52 2015 UTC,"First things first.... Get a good mask, everyone will say it, go to a store and try them on and find one that works for you. Thermal lenses...  Cronus is great our college club just switched most of our club guns to the Cronus. Super durable and holding up well.   I would buy the cheapest model available and then down the road invest into something you really like if you really enjoy the sport.  Can't see the hopper or tank just takes me to the homepage of the website."
paintball,3c8ph9,MHerboth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:47:47 2015 UTC,The hopper is the Gen-X Bullet Paintball Loader and the tank is the Guardian 48/3000 Aluminum Paintball Tank. Thanks for the advice!
paintball,3c8ph9,MHerboth,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:52:30 2015 UTC,Personally I would just get a gravity hopper since I don't think the Cronus can use an e-trigger and an electric hopper is overkill for a gun in semi. Any tank should be fine but if its only a couple dollars more ninja usually has better regulators than their competitors.
paintball,3c8ph9,Bircher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:13:11 2015 UTC,"OK, thanks a lot! I've looked around, and you're probably right about the hopper."
paintball,3c8ph9,Bircher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:18:42 2015 UTC,"this tank seems to be decent at a good price. I've been told this could fire ~500 paintballs on one fill, is that true?   I use an Empire tank with the same capacity. I seem to be able to get about 500 paintballs off one fill."
paintball,3c8ph9,WoodSorrow,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:09:57 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info! It's pretty important to me because I want to be able to do woodsball up north and the nearest shop for refills is about 30 minutes off by car.

paintball,3c8ph9,Just_Owen,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:30:27 2015 UTC,"I would say get a tippmann 98 or a5. The cronus is annoying to me as the feedneck is not removeable, and the only upgrades are more just cheesy things to slap on the shitloads of picatinny rails. The 98 has a decent variety in future upgrades. E-trigger and such, and is easier to clean or field strip."
paintball,3c8ph9,Just_Owen,3,Mon Jul 6 17:53:25 2015 UTC,I'm looking at a used A5 with an E-trigger and a dual trigger already. ~150$ with a tank and 2 masks.

The chances of you finding a squad f 5 for the day are random... But that shouldn't deter you from going
paintball,3c7ea8,Nifty_Biscuit,8,Sun Jul 5 16:08:59 2015 UTC,"From many reviews, Snipers are a complete hit or miss with people. Definitely try one out before you buy.  Phantoms: don't bother with the open class. If you want to play stock class, phantom all the way!  KP3: I'm very satisfied with the KP line. However, it should be noted that KP's are blowback based, not cocker based if it means anything to you."
paintball,3c7ea8,mazu747,2,Sun Jul 5 16:28:19 2015 UTC,As far as customization and reliability go. What would your choice be?
paintball,3c7ea8,mazu747,3,Sun Jul 5 16:33:05 2015 UTC,"Out of all of those, KP3, but I don't want to customize anything. I don't even know how you would go about customizing a KP3.  But it sounds like you would like a used pumped cocker. You can do pretty much anything to a cocker. And they're reliable as fuck"
paintball,3c7ea8,SlidePanda,2,Sun Jul 5 17:00:50 2015 UTC,So used cocker with some upgrades put into it over all these? Can you tell me more about cockers and where I might get one?
paintball,3c7ea8,socks86,2,Sun Jul 5 17:09:47 2015 UTC,"Cocker (basically) = Sniper. The original Sniper was made by WGP. It was just the same body and internals some of their Autococker models - but with a pump kit installed in lieu of a the Front Block with the auto bits.  So pretty much any autococker can be converted for pump use. It's very easy, and can be done in a few minutes. Typically folks do it with mechanical Autocockers, but there's no reason an E-cocker can't be converted to pump and back as well.  Personally - my pump is a WGP Orracle that I got with lower tube internals. Fit with an Eclipse hinge frame, CCM pump and a CP reg and swapped out the springs with a Maddman spring kit. So, built from some new and some used items. Great shooter, and doesn't suffer the case of the farts that some folks have with WGP based, Empire Snipers and the KP3"
paintball,3c7ea8,bleedsmarinara,3,Sun Jul 5 18:58:16 2015 UTC,"The sniper and sniper II came first. The autococker came later, with pneumation adopted from glen palmers design.  In other words, snipers weren't originally autocockers with a pump kit installed. Autocockers were snipers with pneumatic kits installed."
paintball,3c7ea8,noided1111,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:47:51 2015 UTC,OG Sniper bodies aren't quite the same. You probably mean Sniper II.
paintball,3c7ea8,mazu747,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:07:13 2015 UTC,"Get whatever body and frame fits your taste and budget, ccm pump kit, and some slps springs. Feels and shoots way nicer than an empire sniper. Shouldn't cost more than $200-300, depending on what parts you use. Mcb, cc, and facebook groups for most of your parts."
paintball,3c7ea8,phantomjm,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:04:31 2015 UTC,"Check out a store, or online but I prefer a store/field when buying used because I can try it before I buy it. They don't make autocockers anymore (sans the Empire Resurrection and the pump version the Sniper that you just asked about), autocockers can be converted to pump (autocockers are pump markers with pneumatics to make it cock itself). Many that you can buy used have pump kits on them already, but any without one can easily be converted!"
paintball,3c7ea8,mazu747,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:59:54 2015 UTC,"So far as reliability goes, I can't see how a Phantom would be in third place. There is very little to go wrong with them, they're easy to maintain, and they can be easily reconfigured between stock class, mod stock, and open class by swapping out a few easily changed and inexpensive parts. They come stock with an autotrigger - cockers don't. The valve is easily accessed for maintenance if necessary - cockers require a special valve tool. Phantoms are extremely lightweight - cockers aren't. You also need to factor in the quality of service you get when contacting Mike - the guy who invented it answers the phone himself. As for the KP3, it's flashy but unproven. Having owned several cockers and a Phantom, I can easily say that Phantoms are far more versatile. Also, I've owned mine since 1999 and it hasn't let me down even once."

If you're adamant on getting one of the three that you picked, I really enjoy my empire sniper. It's not perfect but I think it's because it's previous owner kind of abused it."

paintball,3c8s0d,SkinnyBins,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:45:26 2015 UTC,"Where are you located? If you're in a place with a decent used market, always look into that first. Craigslist is a goldmine for starter kits that people sell because they decide that paintball isn't really their thing. You can often get barely used equipment for a fraction of the retail price. That being said, if you're not into used equipment, the kit you have lined up is fine for a start. The price is right, and all the reviews seem to agree that it's good value for the money. It does mean that the setup will have little to no resale value if and when you decide to upgrade."

But you can find Minis for around 130-150$, try to combo in a tank deal ~160-180$  Yea, you are paying 50-100$ more but you are also not buying crap. remember these purchases do not have to be all at once, and you can still play by just renting a marker and having a great loader and mask to one-up other renters.

paintball,3c7vvx,Caliboy50124,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:52:19 2015 UTC,"20rd or even 30rd mags are worth it if you plan on shooting more than twenty rounds in a game.  Biggest consideration is the size of the 20rd is longer than the 14rd, and longer for the 30 if that weighs into your chest/belt rig decisions.  You can also call RAP4 to see if they plannon putting out a package that has a few 20rd Helix mags that are continuous feed and are generally better.  The extended mag release prevents the arm on the left of the magwell from rotating down.  When it rotates down, it does not engage the magazine lock and the mag will not stay in the well.  Furthermore, the bottom on the right will have an adjustable height and travel to fit your style.  Lefties can use their thumb or index finger, righties can reach forward with the trigger finger to catch the tail of the release lever.  As for your cosmetic attachments, the magwell goes in place of the fake mag for the Allen keys, and that's where the modding on shrouds happens.  Just don't worry about modding until your kit arrives, and slowly and carefully dremel away what you need to on the shroud until it fits on the MKP-II."
paintball,3c7vvx,kapyrna,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:07:43 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks. This has really helped. Although, do you think it's worth getting the extended mag release?"

paintball,3c7vvx,Wozrop,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:07:38 2015 UTC,"Helix mags are out in a pack of ten, 20 rounds, they sold out of the current run though so it will be like until August until the next batch of orders ships.  I put some gaffer tape over the magrelease lever screw thing(the bit that falls out and gets stuck) solved it for me but the extended mag release button does work.  Stocks are fine, it's only shrouds that have issues, because the magwell is longer than the magwell for the tool kit on a stock phenom, shrouds don't fit.  The bottom of the shroud extends past the point where you put in the push pins, to work with the MKP-II this needs to be straight.  You can cut the extra piece with a hacksaw, not sure exactly how much material there is on the ump shroud but to work with the kit, huge shroud should be able to stand on its end.  Hope this helps, enjoy your ""new"" marker!"

paintball,3c8u0z,roadkill435,19,Tue Jul 7 11:30:03 2015 UTC,Um how about not overfilling the tank
paintball,3c8u0z,IyamwhatIam,10,Sun Jul 5 23:58:08 2015 UTC,Stop doing that and don't fill it past 3k. Don't fuck with pressurized cylinders. They have safety measures in place to help prevent you from hurting yourself and/or others. Over filling will rupture a burst disk if the pressure gets to high and then you're out of a tank until it gets replaced.
paintball,3c8u0z,kavar13,5,Mon Jul 6 00:00:22 2015 UTC,"So, it seems like there are two questions:   What is the conventional wisdom in regards to filling hpa tanks? When will my tank break? The conventional wisdom is clear...don't overfill.  Besides the obvious, though slim, possibility of catastrophic failure, I've blown fill nipples when I've over-filled.  An extra 200psi really won't make a huge difference...just a handful of shots.  Having said that, also consider that tank reg gauges are often not perfect.  They are often wrong, even on high quality tanks like ninjas.  My brother has gone through 3 mini gauges on his sl 77.  Just fill it to the recommended. You will have two burst disks I'm your tank for this very thing, and on a 3000 tank, the disk will burst at some pressure higher.  Theoretically, 3200 won't burst anything.  But, why take the chance?"

paintball,3c8u0z,iamthelouie,-15,Mon Jul 6 00:56:15 2015 UTC,"Please, blow it out your ass.  I'm asking because, generally speaking, the maximum limit of something is usually a fraction of what it can actually reach. Maximum capacity =/= recomended capacity."
paintball,3c8u0z,aaronm7191,8,Mon Jul 6 01:03:43 2015 UTC,And the recommended capacity is recommended for a reason... if you really need the extra shots get a 4.5k tank.
paintball,3c8u0z,tacodorifto,3,Mon Jul 6 01:22:18 2015 UTC,yeah get a bigger tank and one rated for more psi. why push your luck with overfilling a tank? take a hint and realize everyone is saying the same thing. dont over fill your hpa tank. Its called high pressure for a reason.  it can cause serious damage in the worst case scenario.
paintball,3c8u0z,Claclink,6,Mon Jul 6 01:30:59 2015 UTC,"Maximum capacity =\= safe.  The tanks is rated for 3000 psi so it is safe under all conditions.  Let's say you are playing in the summer and your tank gets really hot and adds some extra PSI, combined with the little dent in the corner that makes your tank weaker, the gauge on the fill tank is off by 200 psi.  All the sudden you are walking around with a ticking time bomb up against your shoulder.  This is how all saftey standards are designed and stuff still fails all the time.  You are endangering the lives of people around you."
paintball,3c8u0z,Claclink,-5,Mon Jul 6 02:21:58 2015 UTC,I've actually never thought of it that way. I always thought the tanks were built to be tough just for situations like this. I didn't know lots of little things like that can all add up into one big thing.

paintball,3c8u0z,GoldyGoldy,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:13:39 2015 UTC,"Safety ratios exist to prevent retards like you from killing themselves.  You fill to about 3200, leave the tank in the sun and pop goes your 4.5k burst disk. Anybody within 30 feet is probably getting hearing damage. You do NOT want to fuck with this kind of pressure. Trust me when I tell you that burst disk is not something you want blowing. Ever."
paintball,3c8u0z,SkinnyBins,3,Mon Jul 6 04:16:41 2015 UTC,"You can exceed it by zero, without putting yourself at risk to the tank exploding on you.  That risk at 200 extra psi may be just a few percent, but it's there."
paintball,3c8u0z,SkinnyBins,2,Mon Jul 6 01:36:05 2015 UTC,"Check your burst disk ratings. You should keep well below them to be safe. Most Steel 3K tanks I've seen have 5K burst disks,  so 3.2 K shouldn't be a problem. That being said, I recommend not overfilling. At best you'll gain a few extra shots, at worst, you'll be horribly maimed (or dead?) It's not worth it. The most likely scenario is one where the burst disk blows and you're left with a cold hand and no tank to play with. I've had CO2 tanks blow on me on hot days and it is not a pleasant experience. With CO2 running at only ~800 PSI, I can only imagine what would happen if a 3K tank burst right beside your wrist."

Is your burst disc basically your maximum possible capacity? I noticed the little gauge on my HPA tank has a max of 5 but I usually top it off at 3.2.    At best you'll gain a few extra shots, at worst, you'll be horribly maimed (or dead?)   Looking at it that way, its obviously not worth the extra few shots.   I can only imagine what would happen if a 3K tank burst right beside your wrist.   I'd guess mostly soft tissue damage all along your wrist. The biggest concern would be it blowing up into your neck (which is probably exposed while your face and torso are covered) and getting shrapnel into your carotid artery, jugular vein, and your trachea!"
paintball,3c8u0z,HELP_IM_ON_FIRE,2,Mon Jul 6 02:15:08 2015 UTC,"Is your burst disc basically your maximum possible capacity? I noticed the little gauge on my HPA tank has a max of 5 but I usually top it off at 3.2.    Yes and no. The burst disk value is the effective maximum pressure. If the pressure goes as high or beyond the burst disk rating, the disk will rupture and cause the tank to evacuate its contents through the now open hole. This prevents you from being able to fill the tank to levels that would approach the actual maximum capacity of the tank. Going beyond that maximum is where you would start to see explosions, lacerations and death. This is why we don't fuck with burst disks. As it is, if you overfill your tank past the burst disk rating, you probably won't die, but you might get hurt from the massive amount of pressure being released very quickly through a small hole."

paintball,3c5cmi,TSK-REAPER22,6,Sat Jul 4 23:13:03 2015 UTC,"A budget limit would help, but here's some basic info  First things first - mask! A good mask is super important, so don't skimp on it! JT Proflex is great for all players and is nice and comfy on the majority of people.  Dual pane lenses make it not fog as much and the air venting is pretty great.  If you're on a tight budget, you can pick up the Empire Helix.  Just make sure it's dual/thermal pane lens.  Note that buying used is a great option! You can find a ton of high end masks for cheap if you look around your area of B/S/T places.  Try to avoid CO2.  It's all around bad for your marker, and most places are starting to not fill it anymore.  Most electros can't take CO2.  If you want to jump straight into electros, pick up an Empire Axe (my opinion) or an Planet Eclipse Etha.  Both are great starter electro markers.  The Axe is better IMO, and can be found for a decent price used.    Otherwise, mech markers are great too.  The A5 is a workhorse and will last you forever, but is fairly bulky and hard to work with.  A GOG eNMEy is a great mech marker.  I use and love mine.  Easy maintenance, great trigger pull, smaller design.  Outperforms the A5 in every way.  Other things like a tank and a hopper are up to you.  If you're going with an electro, get a force-fed hopper, like a Halo Too.  Carbon fibre tanks will be lighter and give you more shots per fill.  Please don't buy a 22"" barrel"

paintball,3c5cmi,IyamwhatIam,2,Sat Jul 4 23:39:54 2015 UTC,"High Pressure Air (HPA) tanks are much more consistent and clean for your marker to use, as well as much more popular now.  Get a tank size that fits you comfortably.    Depending on the field, your paint will be different.  A lot of fields only allow you to play using the field paint.  Other places allow Bring Your Own Paint.  I would always recommend buying paint from a local proshop, and if you can, ask to check the paint for breaks before you buy it.  Proshops store their paint properly, which makes the paint higher quality.  Buying paint online is risky because of transport.  For pants, the best quality for the price are IMO Exalt Thrashers. They're really decent - breathable, light, less padding but its enough.  Paintball pants are kinda pricy sadly.  I haven't tried the cheaper Valken pants yet, but they seem like they're worth a shot."

paintball,3c2xrj,Foamie,3,Sat Jul 4 10:16:38 2015 UTC,Like the poster above I recommend that all of your soft goods and protective gear be new. My marker tank hopper and barrels are all used but my mask pants and pads are all brand new when I got them.  Knee pads and elbow pads are a big deal. I'd highly recommend even if you are buying pants with padding because you only get one set of joints. Messing them up because you botch a slide or a dive isn't worth it.  Plus the extra padding will help you with bounces anyway.
paintball,3c2xrj,Foamie,2,Sat Jul 4 10:35:47 2015 UTC,Alright! Going to be getting some new stuff in the next 2 or 3 months and I can't wait!
paintball,3c2xrj,SlidePanda,2,Sat Jul 4 10:54:04 2015 UTC,Sounds good man. Just remember to not skimp on your mask for your other gear. The mask alone is probably the most important piece of gear you'll wear. Make sure you can try some on too before buying  especially if you wear glasses or have a big head or anything like that because certain mask types will be much more comfortable to wear.
paintball,3c2xrj,forgotmyredditagain,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:24:59 2015 UTC,Yep! Was planning on going to my pro shop soon to try some on especially because I have a big head and glasses. gonna hold some markers to see how they feel in my hands as well as pads.
paintball,3c2xrj,benttwig33,2,Sat Jul 4 23:36:52 2015 UTC,"I'd buy knee pads new. They are right against the skin, see a lot of sweat and are not easy to get clean like a pair of pants would be  To your initial question. No goggles unless foam can be replaced. Pants, jersey, sure just toss em in the wash. Gear, marker, hopper, tanks... Sure. Just be sure you do your home work.   I think the only marker I've bought NIB was my first spyder. After that it's all been good (for me) wheeling and dealing on used stuff. Or the pump I built with mix of new and 2nd hand items"

I mean look at MR H, is this the person you want representing a sport? The crash at the coast events that they host are literally there for you to party, do drugs and have sex. (which i would personally enjoy) but from a business standpoint, its bad for the sport. The sport of paintball already has a very negative light to it, its seen as a sport that misbehaving, drug doing, no fucks given kids play. and while that does not represent everyone in the sports, it is seen that way by most people outside the sport. I think there videos are great for the most part, products arnt my style but thats not a big deal. This come from a 23 college student who does party, has gone to living legends in 2014 and partied with hk and works part time at a paintball field. I have so much time / money invested in the sport and i would love to see it grow just as much as any paintballer but they just attract the wrong crowed, the crowed that will continue to represent the sport in a negative light.

paintball,3c0vr0,Blodhgarm,6,Fri Jul 3 19:13:21 2015 UTC,I would probably go with a .687 or .685 bore. You should be able to shoot most paint with no issues.

paintball,3c0vr0,Drenlo,2,Fri Jul 3 19:59:09 2015 UTC,".687 will allow you to shoot anything.  Yes, paint has been getting a bit smaller, but I shot some 4-star that was .687 a few weeks ago.  Say you find yourself in a humid area, or a really cold one, or are shooting super brittle paint... You might not want to underbore.  Don't get me wrong, .685 will probably be fine for 90% of the paint you come across.  But .687 will bump that up to 99%, and you won't see much of a drop in performance."

paintball,3bz5ux,Ravenye,2,Fri Jul 3 09:38:33 2015 UTC,How do you like yours? I had a 1.5 for about three months. Probably put about 4-5 cases through it and it just seemed underwhelming to me. I've since traded it for a Clone Gt but I'd like to hear another's opinion.
paintball,3bz5ux,jpwasson,3,Fri Jul 3 15:52:37 2015 UTC,"I haven't taken her for a proper spin yet so i can only talk about first impressions, to be honest!  I love how it feels in my hand, very light weight (almost too light maybe, depending on how much kick i will get out of her). Test ran a few shots and in all honesty i must say it kicked alot and was not as smooth as expected. However, i didn't have a chrono on me so it might been shooting hot. Hopefully i will get her alot smoother once i tune her.  I love the thinking behind the marker though, like only needing one allenkey for the whole marker and such things.   I think alot of people might give this marker too high expectations as the ""luxe-killer"". In quality and thought: Oh yes definitely better (imo) than a luxe. But i think the charm with the luxe is the smooth shot, and that is something i think this marker won't reach. But who knows! Then again, i paid a third of what a luxe goes for in Sweden sooo.. Im satisfied either way :-) Will in worst case serve me well as a backup!"
paintball,3bz5ux,jpwasson,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:38:28 2015 UTC,I'm sure once it is tuned it will be considerably smoother. The shot on mine was very nice. I certainly can't complain about that. It just didn't feel right in my hands though. My Etek 4 that I use for my backup actually felt better in my hands even while considerably lacking in shot quality. I guess it's all personal preference really. So far I've loved my Clone GT. Considerably smoother and quieter shot compared to the vanquish.

paintball,3bz5ux,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:41:22 2015 UTC,"But i think the charm with the luxe is the smooth shot, and that is something i think this marker won't reach. But who knows!   Theyre essentially the same marker. Based on the Shocker. They all can reach similar levels of smoothness. My last NXT Shocker was as smooth as any Luxe or Squish ive shot. Really you just have to decide which one has the bells and whistles you like more."
paintball,3bz5ux,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:25:51 2015 UTC,"I'm aware of that (which is why i bought her), but somehow this lil'fella wasn't as smooth at all.

paintball,3bz5ux,CaptainKejj,1 point,Fri Jul 3 17:39:54 2015 UTC,Is it brand new? The shocker platform tends to do better when the orings wear down a bit. Theres quite a few of them in there causing friction.

paintball,3c0fm0,iamthelouie,5,Sun Jul 5 03:01:42 2015 UTC,"Soda stream machines use a different, non standard connection. Basically a way to try to limit folks into using their gas bottles and thus giving them recurring revenue - vs having a standard connection that any CO2 bottle could be fit to.  And as I understand it, the Soda Stream bottles are set up so they cannot be refilled with standard equipment.   Now, folks like Palmers and other make adapters that are male Soda stream threads and female ASA or hose kits that are male SS on one end and Female ASA at the other for remote style set ups.  So nothing different about the CO2 - just the threading on their bottles"

paintball,3c0syw,novonn,3,Fri Jul 3 18:52:41 2015 UTC,"Swabs don't do much anything for chops (breech breaks), they're good for barrel breaks. They might push a little bit of paint back, but it's not that bad, very much an improvement over leaving the barrel dirty.  If you're playing recball or woodsball and you got time to kill, just take the barrel off.  And shitty swabs don't help as much, not as absorbent."
paintball,3c0syw,mazu747,3,Fri Jul 3 19:03:31 2015 UTC,They absorb some of the paint from the barrel/breach and the shell should be cleared by the subsequent balls you have fired. With that said they aren't perfect but sometimes you don't have the time to take your barrel all of the way off. It should also be noted that products like the exalt barrel maid have a rubber end to help pull more paint out. and then a swab end for the final clean.
paintball,3c0syw,JagoDago,3,Fri Jul 3 19:04:38 2015 UTC,"To elaborate on the rubber end, for those who haven't seen one used in person, it actually stretches while it's being pushed down the barrel and only contacts the inner barrel wall at a couple small points. This minimizes the amount of paint pushed deeper into the barrel. Then when it's pulled back out, the round part squishes back together and contacts the full inner wall, all the way 'round and squeegees all the paint ahead of it out of the barrel. It's easily the most effective way to clean the barrel in a pinch. If you follow it with a swab after, it's almost like new."
paintball,3c0syw,NotYoFriendGuy1,2,Sat Jul 4 04:44:03 2015 UTC,"Some paint and shell out is better than leaving it all in.  Swabs are designed to help during the game...to get you to the pits and get a proper cleaning.  Also, a product like the exalt barrel maid, which is the absolute best swab out there, is designed to sweep out the shell, as well."

paintball,3bzo1v,zorro1589,2,Fri Jul 3 18:16:10 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that was the experience of a friend. I went there earlier this year and my only problem was the slow turnarounds. In my experience, you should be able to get at least two or three 15 minute games per hour depending on the size/experience of the group. We got about 1 - 1.5 games at best. It wasn't as if the plauers weren't ready, the staff was just standing around. They weren't unfriendly or anything, just slow."
paintball,3bzo1v,zorro1589,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:13:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree with you there it can be kindve slow depending on the day but it is also the cheapest field in the Lower mainland I believe, especially if you get the membership which is only 180 for a year"
paintball,3bzo1v,Canaba,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:28:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is the cheapest, but I'm not close enough to it for that to make the difference. In the end, I'd rather pay a bit more to get a higher quality/quantity of games. As it is, I'll probably end up at Ambush again at some point, but I won't go out of my way to get there. Like I said, North Shore can't compete with the terrain of the Surrey fields, but it's close to home and they have pretty decent turnaround. Basically, I'll probably only head out that way if there's a big game or something.   Edit: One of the reasons turnaround time is so important to me is that I don't get a lot of chances to play anymore, so when I do get a Saturday or Sunday afternoon off, I want to get as much play time as possible. From a field owner's perspective, it means people have a better time and shoot more paint."

paintball,3byvim,zorro1589,3,Fri Jul 3 08:14:15 2015 UTC,"You can easily get a used Empire Sniper for that price nowadays.  you could also build a a decent cocker pump with $250. But if you dont have any experience with that, the Sniper may be your best bet."
paintball,3byvim,cptzanzibar,5,Fri Jul 3 12:32:51 2015 UTC,"From my own personal experience with the Empire Sniper, I would say pick one of those up used. It's compatible with plenty of other pump and autococker parts and works very well. It has some small quirks that may occasionally need to be maintained, but they're usually just small nuisances.  Something I always like to do is research problems of the gun before buying it, so I know what's common. I would suggest you do that, too, before making the decision. The only reason I say the Sniper over the KP3 is that the KP3 is basically a Spyder clone pump, and there aren't as many readily available upgrades for it. I've handled a KP2, and I can't say I'm a big fan, but if I had a $250 budget and just felt the need to buy new, then I would get an Azodin.  Also, if you can find a used autococker pump on craigslist within your price range, I would pick that up over a Sniper. The reason being is usually the owner has put together a decent setup and it's compatible with more autococker parts than the Empire Sniper."
paintball,3byvim,valve_bender,2,Fri Jul 3 08:19:54 2015 UTC,"SL-68 II. One of the most simple and reliable markers of all time. I've had mine for 13+ years and have bought and sold many other markers in that time (including two Snipers.) I've always fallen back to my SL because of its light weight, compact design and reliability. If you're looking for a more modern gun with more modifications available, a Sniper or Phantom is probably your best bet, but if you want something that's good out of the box and costs less than $100 (used) an SL is a great introduction to pump."

paintball,3byvim,stressedoutatumc,1 point,Sat Jul 4 03:52:00 2015 UTC,"If you live in the states, $250 is enough for a KP3, and they seem to be quite well received. They're pretty much only available brand new right now.  Otherwise, the Empire Sniper is a fantastic marker and you can find a tonne of them used, but in perfect working order for $250 or maybe even less. When new, it's a $400-450 marker, I think. I haven't checked in a while. This is my better recommendation. It's technically arguably a better marker, as long as everything works."
paintball,3byvim,NotYoFriendGuy1,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:33:30 2015 UTC,"Oh joy a pump thread my fav! Ok, with pumps you have a bunch of options: buy used, buy new, stock class, open class, etc. Since this is going to be your first pump (atleast based on your question) I'd recommend something like the new Azodin Kp3s which are very good guns for the price, but if you want to go used(and usually cheaper), something like this or this are good ideas. Both of these are call autocockers, and they are extremely customizable. If you got any questions please ask, I love to talk pump :D"
paintball,3byvim,CallmeCC,1 point,Sat Jul 4 04:51:22 2015 UTC,"okay.  my suggestion would be an SL68, they are bomb proof, and are really good if you can find an aftermarket barrel for it(hard to find but they are around)  also for 250$ if its just a marker your looking for and dont need to afford other gear with that bugget.. i would suggest a open class CCI Phantom. if you can find one with a center clamping feedneck, and grip mounted asa it would be perfect for all occasions."

paintball,3bwcwv,OffensiveHandle,2,Thu Jul 2 18:15:32 2015 UTC,I'm currently stuck deciding between the drone and the etek5. I currently own an Etha and love planet eclipse. But I'm wondering if it'd be worth it to try something different.
paintball,3bwcwv,92759275,2,Thu Jul 2 21:58:36 2015 UTC,"Can you go to a local shop and actually hold them to compare? That's what everyone suggests.   Personally I prefer spools, but I've heard really good things about the etek5."
paintball,3bwcwv,92759275,2,Thu Jul 2 22:04:50 2015 UTC,"I live in Anchorage, Alaska. There are no shops up here haha. But I have done research online and am really leaning towards the etek5. But everyone I've met that has the drone absolutely loves it."
paintball,3bwcwv,novonn,3,Thu Jul 2 22:17:14 2015 UTC,"Do you want a poppet or spool?  Etek 5 is said to shoot like an Darted Ego 11, have a feel like a Lv1 (cause the grip), and quieter than previous Eteks. Also poppets are more reliable and more efficient. So pretty good for its price.  I don't know about the Drone, but spoolies in general shoot ""smoother"" and generally quieter, but require more maintaining and more replaced orings."
paintball,3bwcwv,ejyazel,1 point,Fri Jul 3 04:22:34 2015 UTC,"You really shouldn't have to change out your spool o-rings that often. Part of what makes spools so smooth and consistent is that the o-rings wear and form into the grooves on your bolt. Yes, you'll need to take 2 minutes to lube your spool every other time you go out and play, but it really isn't a huge maintenance commitment.  In Alaska though, I would probably recommend a poppet. Less chance of any bolt stick or frozen o-rings."

Some of their patents are pretty vague so they kinda prevented further development/innovation cause anything better would infringe on a SP patent. Most people are over it now, some people aren't."

paintball,3bxmof,cptzanzibar,2,Fri Jul 3 12:24:11 2015 UTC,I dont know of a better starter marker for the price than an enmey. They really are solid little shooters.
paintball,3bxmof,cptzanzibar,2,Fri Jul 3 12:10:42 2015 UTC,"I dont know of a better starter marker for the price   I didnt say cheaper. Sure the Kaos is cheaper, but have you ever used one? You can get a used enmey for $100 easily. Its built better and has a much better shot quality, like, way better. The Kaos is every bit of a $90 marker. Youre getting what you pay for there.  I only buy used, I never said you have to buy the enmey new, youre making an assumption. Idk what $400 marker youre getting for $100 thats in any sort of good condition."
paintball,3bxmof,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 12:25:37 2015 UTC,"Same price as a enmey, which is like ~$200.    Theyre $189 brand new. And can easily be had for $100 used.   I dont understand what youre saying"
paintball,3bxmof,cptzanzibar,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:03:22 2015 UTC,"So then why would you say a Kaos is better for a new player?  The enmey fits the criteria you just outlined better than the Kaos does.   Im also not sure why youre comparing the price of a used mid range against the price of a new low end. You can get a used enmey for $100 all day. That leaves you with $100 to spend on a better mask/hopper/tank, which as a new player, you should be doing over trying to balance future resale of your mid range marker."
paintball,3bxmof,cptzanzibar,0,Fri Jul 3 13:15:46 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of comparable markers in that price range. Proto rails, invert minis, and whatever tippy offers now.  As much as I dislike the Gardners and their business tactics, do I still own some of their products? Sure, but only because those tactics have made them a major (if not the most) player in the business.  They have their hands in GI, SP, DLX, KEE and all of their offshoots. Odds are the haters are using something from one of their companies whether they like it or not."
paintball,3bxmof,Aidspanda,2,Fri Jul 3 13:18:51 2015 UTC,Rails and minis are more expensive. And tippmann offers nothing as good in the price range.

paintball,3bxmof,Lunarpancake,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:18:58 2015 UTC,There's a little bit of a difference between suing someone for  a) Suing a company for re-branding your marker and selling it as their own.  v.s.  b) Suing every paintball manufacturer for their method of shooting a paintball by using a microswitch trigger to activate a solenoid.

A court won't just award SP for no reason (assuming it went to some court), there has to be some sort of smoking gun. It's not a jerk move if it's the correct move. Did some companies that were put out of business doing something better with SP's technology? If so, they obviously didn't go about it in the right way? You reap what you sow no? If I created something awesome and folks started to take what I did and improve it and make money, hell, I'd want me share. THAT'S if this is the situation of course.

paintball,3bxmof,TheAmazingLeech,3,Fri Jul 3 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"The problem is that this sticky has been brought up by new players before and it worries them to buy the GoG product. In turn, GoG's products are the best company for a new player to buy from. They get cheap, reliable, easy to care for markers at a great price. PLUS, amazing customer service and a warranty to boot.  I am still convinced they are the company driving up new player participation and longveity. They did it with smart parts with guns like the Ion, SP1 and SP8. Not to mention the Shocker was more competitively priced than all it's counter parts on the market at the time.   I also feel like they did more help to the industry than harm, when the industry is truly about the players. Not the company. It sucks we had to lose these companies from their actions, but I feel their actions since smart parts has more than made up for their past. The one line they drew was never, ever, hurt the players. And they have kept to that. Brands come and go, in ever industry. It sucks to see things like that die.   Its called Capitalism, and while I mostly hate it, I believe its the only thing driving new tech to truly surface and survive in this sport."

However nothing beats a good non-fogging mask. If you really want a marker first watch craigslist as you can find something low end for under 50. Then get the hopper and tank, something decent because i cheaped out on a hopper and got a crap one and switched to a gravity feed until i get a spire."

In my opinion, when it comes to markers, you get what you pay for. As sad as that fact is, it becomes more true every time I price check. I'd say assess just how much you're willing to put into your set up, and then buy a new marker that fits into that budget."

You need to play to progress, not spend days teching your gun in the parking lot. Eteks are great beginner guns as are used Egos. You can get wicked deals on used G6Rs and other BLAST guns. They're a little more work to maintain, but DM14s are also selling for dirt cheap right now.   The rest of your gear you want to be comfortable and functional.

Personally, unless you're very frugal, don't buy something just to get it because 3 months from now you may be back in the market. Go and get what you want (suggest doing research first) and don't make the mistake of buying something you ultimately aren't in love with. Markers are finicky things, and it's best you are in sync.  If your first marker back into playing is an autococker, and you don't know autocockers, I do not suggest getting it."

paintball,3byel7,Wojciech10,5,Fri Jul 3 04:31:14 2015 UTC,"Without seeing it in person, it's a bit hard to help... But, here's my methodology:   Ensure everything is good to go, per the manufacturer's specs.  New battery, board settings to stock/factory, and no amazingly out-of-place tears in o-rings or anything. Ensure everything is properly clean and lubed, including the regulator.  If a reg seat is worn, I'd replace it here. Ensure the pressures are correct, especially if it doesn't have an LPR.  Google tells me ~150 psi should be coming out of your HPR. Assuming you've set everything up correctly and it's still leaking, I'd identify EXACTLY where the leak is coming from, beyond just ""near the trigger"".  On guns that have macro line, this would include taking the trigger frame off of the body, and running air through the marker.  8/10 times for trigger-area leaks, it's something like a solenoid gasket, because people never clean or lube them, and they may dry out or bits of dirt or random foreign objects magically end up there.  Clean, lube, inspect, try again. If there's no leak, then...awesome.  Fixed. If everything else is working fine, but the velocity of your shots is still super low, it means one of two things:  obstruction of an airway, or undue friction on the bolt.  Since I've already cleaned everything, it won't be the first one.... But I'll usually still trace the airways again to make sure.  This may include taking the solenoid off/apart to give it a detailed inspection... Which I don't recommend unless you really know what you're doing.  The second thing is just hand-fitting o-rings and lubing the bolt.   On some markers, there's a purge function on the solenoid if there's too much pressure.  If you hit that mark, which you might be, it's because your bolt isn't smooth enough, causing you to over-pressurize to compensate, causing your solenoid to purge, which sounds like a leak.  Reduce drag on the bolt, take the pressure back down, and it'll be fine.  So... There you go."

paintball,3bxyer,orangetoaster,2,Fri Jul 3 06:59:44 2015 UTC,You live in San Deigo. You should keep playing paintball in the off season.
paintball,3bxyer,orangetoaster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:33:10 2015 UTC,Truest words ever written.
paintball,3bxyer,orangetoaster,1 point,Fri Jul 3 03:53:34 2015 UTC,"The number of players depends on how reliable they are, The team I play on has 20-30 ""members"" but only 10 are actively coming to practices. Our policy is ""you must practice to play"" meaning those that are regularly showing up to practice get to play tournaments. Others may be pulled in but only if we are short players for a line.  Practices should be about improving skills, not playing full points. Scrimmaging against teammates is not a good way to improve. Lucky for you, there are plenty of players in your area. The team I play on is very much a rural team, the nearest teams are 3-4 hours from us. But we still manage to be dominant in tournaments in larger areas (Minneapolis/St.Paul).   Figure out drills to work on. Drills should include gun skills, communication, aggression, communication, laning, communication, snap shooting, communication, and physical fitness.  Check out the pro tips sites like bkipaintball by Grayson Goff and Paintball University. Both have a wealth of information on drills and building paintball intelligence. If you browse youtube you will find numerous videos available. Be aware of older video, tips in some of them are no longer thought of as the best way to play. For example, there is a Ollie Lang video of him going completely wild snapshooting, pushing off with his feet, it is considered to be bad form.  Next, prize reliable equipment over having a flashy Jersey. Custom Jerseys start at $80 and go up from there. You are better off buying cheap (1-2 sizes larger than needed) long sleeve shirts and spend the saving on reliable equipment. In a tournament, having equipment fail during a point is a $5,000 mistake.  Film your practices (Grayson recommends this also). There are often mistakes you will catch wen reviewing footage that you would not catch otherwise. Last snapshooting drill I did, I setup a camera on the receiving end of my gun, it made me realize that I was staying out too long after the trigger pull. This brings up another point: Practice as you would play, this means when doing snap drills, hug the bunker. Its easy to forget you should be right up on the bunker in tournament play, unless you know you have everyone else blocked out.  Learn to read a field, figure out the lanes and your role on the field. You should be walking the entire field. Even if you are a snake player you need to know what shots the Dorito side has (they will be gunning for you).  Most tournaments are run through the APPA nowdays, this means you should understand how player rankings work. My general recommendation is to not play outside of your division until you rank up ( If you read through the formula for player rankings, you will see you can fudge it a bit). Don't play Open class until you are ready to play against really good players. This is especially true if you are doing well in your division. Also understand that if you are doing remotely well in D5 you will become D4 the next year. the Ranking system is designed to move you into D4 after one season unless you are careful with your points. I came into this season as a D5 player with 95 points, so I managed to stay D5 for 2 years, but that was because I was mainly working on improving my skills as a player, not playing tournaments the first year."

paintball,3bwg7m,mazu747,7,Fri Jul 3 10:35:40 2015 UTC,"It's not broke. Tippmann's work. They could easily make a better marker instead of having zero innovation.  The only argument people have is that they're durable. Hell no. Hell fucking no. Unless you plan on bashing your markers with rocks, using them as a fucking hammer, and go swimming with them then I can see why you'd like the durability. For paintball, just about every other marker will put up with as much shit as any other Tippmann. Don't believe me? Watch the 2015 Dallas PSP tournament.  That cyclone feed blows. It's not innovative. They should have just made an electronic hopper. It's a waste of air and isn't low profile at all. It makes you a much bigger target by making you wider. Your hopper is typically in front of your head, which is about as tall, maybe just a little taller. The cyclone makes your upper body and head much much wider, making you an easier target. And it's a fucking air hog. Most modern hoppers last a long time (multiple days of use) on their batteries.  Their spool valve markers are a disappointment. They could have made them so much better (seriously? 300 PSI? DP's and their dump valves are more efficient).  And don't even get me started on how fucking hard they are to clean and maintain."

paintball,3bxl0v,lacquerhead901,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:22:35 2015 UTC,"The GoG enmey is a mech marker and not electric. The GoG extcy and GoG envy are their electronic markers. Both of these are pretty solid entry level markers IF you are set on buying new. However used you get much more value for your dollar as many paintball guns have terrible resale values. A commonly mentioned electro is the Empire axe which can be found used for ~250 usd.   When you buy an electro you also need to remember to factor in an HPA tank as pretty much all electros will not operate on CO2. Also it is suggested you have an electronic hopper, if this gun won't be your primary I would suggest a halo too which is around 30$ used. At minimum you should get a Proto Primo which costs around 15$ new and essentially is a fancy gravity fed hopper that feeds around 8 bps iirc."

The indoor speedball field hosts many CPPL tournaments and members usually organize things like Pump nights or low-tech nights.

This saturday (ie, two days from this post) is the first big game held by the field east of Red Deer (Outcast Society Paintball, also on facebook). We will see how they handle it (I'll be there). It probably won't get the numbers Olds does.  The other major southern Alberta field to keep a watch on is the one in Bragg Creek, appropriately named ""Bragg Creek Paintball"". I don't know when their big games are, though.  There is also a big field in Cochrane, Alberta, but my experiences there have been negative, they do not seem to give much of a crap about anything but corporate bookings at blindingly high prices anymore.

paintball,3bvvae,kavar13,3,Thu Jul 2 16:13:05 2015 UTC,"You can find used freak kits for decent prices $80+, $100 can find you the empire sniper/resurrection kit, various barrels can be bored out to accept freak inserts, the stella kit is nice but a bit pricey, same with CP kits, deadly winds makes an awesome Fiber barrel, lots of choices. Mostly comes down to personal looks preference.  Keep in mind that if you shoot the same paint every week you wont need too many bores; 2-3 will see you though 80% of your days."

Not a huge difference but some say they can notice a difference. If you have $200 to drop I would get a stella kit. You can also email them to make your own custom kit (this is what I did). I went with 3 backs 1 front and a tip. Looking to add 2 more backs and a front soon.

The diuretic effect of caffeine has been strongly debunked in recent years and is now regarded as having a very minimal effect, though there's still a lot of misinformation mentioning it. As for sugar, well, there's plenty of pop with no sugar in it at all and aspartame does not have any dehydrating effect. Gatorade etc is plum full of sugar and it rehydrates just fine.

paintball,3bsr04,Xysted,3,Wed Jul 1 21:48:20 2015 UTC,I WANNA KNOW THE STORY
paintball,3bsr04,Dasuchin,10,Wed Jul 1 21:49:07 2015 UTC,"TL;DR - Short-lived D2 team out of southern California.  Long Version -   The year is 2007... and there was a new team that had been formed, called the ""Hackers"".  Owned by a guy named Arnel who had two sons named Jordan and Josh.  They had both played on ""Legacy 2"", a D2 team started by SD Legacy, a pro X-ball team which wasn't all that successful, but still noteworthy for some of the players on the team.  At the end of the year before, the Bob Long Assassins and SD Legacy joined forces to create BLAST, which would be their new pro team.  Gary Shows owned Legacy, and was a main force behind Hybrid, also known as Contract Killer.  So, with Legacy being no more, their D2 team also went away.  So, Jordan, Josh, and a few other guys from the Legacy 2 team decided to form their own team, which they called the Hackers.  Other guys from around the area were also on the team, each one very talented.  I happened upon them while surfing PBNation, when one of them posted up a thread offering other teams to come scrim against them at SC Village.  I asked if I could play.. and they said ""Sure!  Bring donuts!"".  It was a joke, of course... but I went out and bought some donuts and brought them to the field.  They thought it was hilarious, and I guess I was cool enough to hang around, so I ended up practicing with them from that point.  At SC Village, they had reserved the lower tournament field every weekend.  It's now the Aftermath Arena, but I'll always know it as the hard-surfaced shithole that it was for us.  Because of the relationship between Gary Shows and Arnel, we had our own full set of X-ball bunkers.  It was our own private tournament every weekend, where other teams and players would come practice, and usually get their shit pushed in by the ridiculous talent on our team at the time.  I was in the Marine Corps at the time in 29 Palms, so I made the long drive to the field every weekend, and I ended up getting the nickname ""Marine"".  I'm still pretty convinced that half of them didn't know my real name, but the haircut gave away the nickname every time, so it worked.  ""Hey Marine, go D-side""  ""Hey Marine, lane here"".  etc.  I was nowhere near the talent level of any of them... but I'd still get to hop on points, and I took pictures sometimes with my camera... we'd randomly get photographers coming out to our practices to work on their photography, including many of the guys that still do the national events.  So, the team was practicing every weekend, and gelling.  I wasn't fully aware of it at the time, but damn near everybody on that team had several connections to other players or companies, and so it was known that we were looking for sponsorship.  Hybrid/Contract Killer was one of the first up, due to Gary Shows.  Hybrid was in the middle of doing their individual-player sponsorships, and they were really getting to the height of their influence (before crashing back down spectacularly, partly due to smart parts threatening to sue for the trademark of ""hybrid"" in paintball).  The Hackers and a team called Recluse (also D2) were the only non-pro teams/players to ever be sponsored by Hybrid, to my knowledge.  CC Paintball wanted to give us a deal.  Bob Long was going to set us up with a marker deal for his new ""Marq"" line.  DXS was in line for pants and other random gear.  Some other store approached the team.  It was the golden age of paintball sponsorships, so folks were coming out of the woodwork.  My ignorant mind thought this was a normal thing... and really only after it ended, did I ever figure out how rare all of this was.  We played the PSP LA Open in 2007, and made sunday.... then got totally shit on by Denver Altitude, who ended up winning the event (and several more that year before going D1).  We played HB 2007, and also made sunday.  It was street ball, in division 2..... guys would go to the gate, and ask ""hey, where are you going?"", and then just run up the field and bunker three guys.  It was so random and insane... and it worked!  So, the team was off to a pretty good start.  Alex ""GOAT"" Hong, (SD Legacy, then Dye Ironmen) would come practice with us.  He's a great dude... I can't say enough about awesome he is.  He started Christ Krew, which was a prayer group for paintballers at national events, since nobody goes to church on those sundays, and it got pretty big.  I remember Jordan beating Alex in several 1-on-1's at a practice... he was probably the most gifted and smoothest paintball player I've ever seen, and still is to this day.  Then, we were making plans for PSP Chicago... and had a private practice scheduled at the (now defunct) RAZA field with Dynasty and BLAST.  I think Aftermath was also supposed to be there as well... but it was going to be a great time.  ....and then nobody showed.  Well, I was there.  Arnel, Jordan, and Josh were there.  Nobody else.  There had been a few grumblings about playing time, and organization, and all that... but this was the icing on the cake.  We stood up Dynasty and Bob Long.... which is something that you don't hear very often.  Arnel was PISSED.... and the team pretty much ended right there.  Apparently some guys had thought it was going to be at SC Village, others had work, and some just flaked.  So, the Hackers were no more.  The guys on the team went their own separate ways... Jordan joined Aftermath 2 for a bit, and ended up winning some with them.  He also bounced around to random teams, sandbagging a bit and destroying people in lower tournaments, and I believe he's now in the Air Force.  Josh pretty much followed Jordan, but kept with paintball and played PSP WCO and World Cup with Red Storm, who was in the Pro-Challengers division.  He played snake, and did really well for them, getting props from Matty Marshall on the webcast of some of their games.  He recently played on HK Platoon (D2, WCPPL) when they won last year's series championship over NW Allstars, which was owned by Chris Rangel, who owns and operates UNDR.  I was at the Vegas series finale last November, so I got to see Arnel and Josh, which I hadn't seen in a long time, which was nice.  NW Allstars is now called 406's Finest, which now has two teams, and I played for them a few weeks ago at the San Diego WCPPL.  Some guys went to play for Destiny, who was co-ed at the time, before they went all-female and started sucking again.  One went to play for the Stoned Assassins for a bit.  I deployed to Iraq, then much later helped start the Marine Corps Paintball team.  Others bounced around on random teams, often guesting on squads that needed a killer.  My photography connections landed me a one-time job for Gary Baum, who is behind www.paintballphotography.com, and is basically the godfather of tournament paintball photography.  I did one of the USPL events in Vegas for him.  It was pretty cool... I was pretty drunk.  So, in the end... the Hackers were just like so many other paintball teams from that era... amazingly talented streetballers who were successful for a short time, then flamed out into nothingness.  Every so often I used to wear my Hackers jersey at Camp Pendleton, and almost every time I would meet someone that used to play with someone else that was on the team, or had seen us play, or practiced against us... paintball is a small community, and the Hackers were my little window to see into it.  Now of course, this is about 8 years ago, so some of the exact details may be a little off... but this is how I remember it.  Also, other guys from the team probably have a different side of the same story.  This is just my version of it.  Random pictures I found:  One I took at HB:  http://s69.photobucket.com/user/sinseer90/media/IMG_0875.jpg.html?sort=3&o=95  http://s69.photobucket.com/user/sinseer90/media/NPPL_HBfriday004.jpg.html  Old style long sleeves:  http://s69.photobucket.com/user/sinseer90/media/ql7p1584.jpg.html"

paintball,3bshb7,mazu747,8,Wed Jul 1 20:30:44 2015 UTC,Cyclone feed cost as much as a decent used electric hopper that can be used on any gun. They both do the same thing but an electronic hopper can do it better/faster. Also the feeds will eat away your CO2/HPA if you cant refill at the field.
paintball,3bshb7,GorillaFace,5,Wed Jul 1 20:49:09 2015 UTC,"Meh, an electric hopper works much better IMO. Much smaller target (I love seeing some Cyclones to shoot at, especially when the player is right handed 😏), and Cyclones suck up air like crazy. My buddy can't even shoot 400 rounds with his cyclone and 48/3000 tank, vs my Tippmann (both are 98 variants, same as yours) which can shoot ~700 with a 48/3000 tank.  EDIT: also, Tippmann likes to advertise it doesn't use batteries like electric hoppers. I could use my Rotor for days without changing the battery. They won't die on the field, trust me."

paintball,3bshb7,tremorcontrol91,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:08:59 2015 UTC,"I would get the Proto Primo over the cyclone.  But the RT kicks ass, do get that.  Btw, mahlers is wrong.  The Cyclone and the RT operate on vented gas, i.e. leftover pressure that is not used for resetting the hammer.  This occurs after the air is released through the valve, which means that air would be wasted anyway even if you didn't have either the Cyclone or the RT attached.  I still would pass on the Cyclone though, unless you like milsim and want to rock a tac-cap.  Might as well get the magfed conversion if your going to do that though."
paintball,3bshb7,SaltySalad69,2,Wed Jul 1 21:42:25 2015 UTC,"I like the idea of a cyclone and response trigger as my marker will have nothing electric to go wrong, mechanical problems are no biggie"
paintball,3bshb7,Rafeno760,2,Thu Jul 2 05:50:29 2015 UTC,"You are preaching to the choir my friend.  My thinking is; would I want an electronic trigger or a electric magazine on a real weapon in the same situation? No. Its not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but still it is too many things to go wrong, and too many things you can't always fix at the field.  Solenoids, boards, etc. Changing a battery is only scratching the surface of things to go wrong. Anyways, my primary marker is an A-5 w/ response trigger (cyclone is included obviously), and if there is any one thing I would change about it is the cyclone.  Its a fantastic loader as long as you give it a little oil occasionally, and the 30 rd tac cap is a fun challenge for rec ball. However, the hopper hits get a little infuriating. Especially if you are a righty.  I have learned to play off of my left shoulder well so It helps to negate the disadvantage a little.  You cant always snap on the left side though so you still have to show that big target occasionally.  As a fellow Tippmann owner, I highly recommend you grab a Proto Primo for now.  Later, if you find a friend with an attached cyclone, give it a whirl before you buy one."

paintball,3btq8g,rynet,6,Thu Jul 2 01:58:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we generally all use HPA tanks now. You could open the Tippmann up yourself; it probably just needs new orings and some oil. Shouldn't take too much to get it up.    You probably want to make sure your mask is in working condition. Other than that, you're more or less ready to play."
paintball,3btq8g,mikekarmawhore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:08:08 2015 UTC,"How do the tank sizes work?  There appears to be two numbers, what should I be looking for ?"
paintball,3btq8g,mikekarmawhore,3,Thu Jul 2 03:20:34 2015 UTC,"The first number is the size of the tank in cubic inches. The second number is the PSI, of which there are two options, 3000psi and 4500psi, better known as 3k and 4.5k.    Generally speaking, if you have the money, we recommend you invest in a 4.5k tank, skipping the 3k stage. 48-65CI will be enough in terms of size. In terms of brand, Ninja is considered the most reliable and customer friendly."
paintball,3btq8g,mikekarmawhore,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:28:10 2015 UTC,Awesome thanks so much - looks like I'm looking at about $150-$200 for a tank?
paintball,3btq8g,xluminosityx,2,Thu Jul 2 03:30:34 2015 UTC,"New? That's about right. Used, probably 100-150, depending on condition."
paintball,3btq8g,zorro1589,2,Thu Jul 2 03:34:25 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Go with a 4500 tank.  The 68 will make it so you fill less but if you want to lighten the load since you're playing woodsball, a 45/45 should do just fine for you.  I agree on Ninja being a great brand.  Valken isn't terrible either.  To add to this, invest in a high quality mask like a vforce grills or virtue vio / extend.  You want something you can see very clearly out of, great breathability, and easy to clean."

paintball,3btq8g,ejyazel,3,Thu Jul 2 18:47:16 2015 UTC,"Ensure you mask is safe if you plan to even use it again. If you do, replace the lens, check the foam and elastics. After a few years of storage I found my mask strap elastics had become brittle and well no longer elastic. But perhaps look at a new mask. There's nicer stuff that what you probably have for moderate prices The Tippy 98 owners manual is available online. DL it, and buy up any o-rings you'd need. Might as well go through it and replace out any soft parts and lube it up. If you put it away clean, and didn't store it in some place that would promote corrosion that's probably all (and perhaps more than) it'll need to function again. Might as well spend a bit of time, and very little cash on the Tippy in the near term. If you get it running again, and still want something new you can always sell the Tippy for a little bit. Yes, many fields and shops are getting away from CO2. But it's still usually available through various other sources. Welding gas supply, and home brew/kegging shops often times can/will fill CO2 bottles. If you do opt to get High Pressure Air (HPA) /u/mikekarmawhore gave you to basic run down on size/pressure. As you might figure the more volume per pressure the more shots. Likewise higher bottle pressure but same volume gets you more shots per fill. One thing to keep in mind is the output pressure. For the Tippman you'll want an output in the ~800psi ballpark. Some of the new higher end stuff needs lower pressures from the bottle to perform optimally. The nice thing now, many bottle regs are now set up for easy adjustment without the need for big external bottle regs. They are set up with shims or springs that can be changed out (with the storage bottle empty) to change the output.   TL;DR: Get mask safe again, or buy new. Service Tippman in near term, Figure out CO2 vs HPA debate"

The hyper 3 reg is rock solid and the shot is quite smooth.  Like any spoolie, there will be a certain amount of maintainence, but as long as you are comfortable with it, it will be fine.  On another note, $250 is way too much for a marker that you can find for just a touch over a hundred used."

paintball,3bpwtc,xluminosityx,3,Wed Jul 1 13:39:59 2015 UTC,"Listen to the refs, they are there for your safety and enjoyment. As much as we love seeing people have fun, we don't like constantly having to yell about masks down on the field and barrel sleeves on in the safe area or having to sit people who are repeat offenders.  It's just a game, don't get mad, don't get violent, have respect for other players. Bunch of common sense stuff.  The first hit will hurt, you wont know what to expect from it and it'll catch you off guard. After that the adrenaline will take care of you and you wont feel them as much throughout the day. Don't be afraid to get shot, don't sit in the back, communicate with your team and move when you can. Don't turn your back to your bunker, you cant see the opponents if your back is turned.  When moving around the field, be mindful of what you can and cant see and what your opponent can and cant see as they will be doing the same to you. If you can put a bunker in between you and him, that blocks off his vision on you and you now have an avenue to move up on him, but be mindful of his buddies.  Most importantly: have fun."

paintball,3bpwtc,DDRguy133,2,Thu Jul 2 02:21:40 2015 UTC,"It all depends. A good solid hit that breaks usually feels like a decently think rubber band snap. Not too bad. Bounces can hurt a bit more, but still, its just not that bad. Some places can hurt a bit more tho. The top of the forehead, where the skull starts to curve can be kinda jarring.   The only place where I think the pain can actually be distracting is getting hit right on the spine, or on the back of your arms. But those are rare shots.  All of the pain is minimal if you get into the action and have some adrenaline going. Paintball doesnt hurt that bad at all."

A hit in any normal spot -- chest, arms, face, legs, stomach, etc. -- really doesn't hurt at all. You'll get a funky mark and it might feel sore the next week, but nothing more than a post-workout type of sore.   The real pain is the 1-2 times a year that a paintball catches you in an unexpected place -- Neck, fingers, ear, and coin purse are the worst.   Thankfully most masks cover the ear, you can snag a cheap pair of gloves if you want, and real paintball pants have padding in them to protect from most of that pain."

So you need to sell the tank in the US and buy yourself a Canadian Legal TC Stamped SL tank.   It's regardless of it being completely safe, but it's an insurance and liability issue.

paintball,3bozda,Averageboi,2,Wed Jul 1 03:57:18 2015 UTC,Repair it burst disk burst due to a dirty regulator. Have them clean the reg and put a new one on (should be under $10). If that disk bursts then consider a new regulator not a new tank. Do not waste your time on them trying to make a tank sale.

paintball,3bozda,Seaskimmer,2,Wed Jul 1 01:15:24 2015 UTC,"It's probably not your tank. Low pressure is 400psi and G6r markers can run on super low pressure tanks which output even less than that.             Did you change the batteries on your g6r?   What pressure is your lpr and hpr at?  What lube and when did you last lube the rammer?   After that, if that didn't fix it, if suggest changing the orings on your rammer and bolt.  If that didn't fix it, you might want to lube your hpr and lpr or do an o ring rebuild on them.  Edit: if you have a Bob long Tech near by, it might be easier to just send it in to get tuned."

paintball,3bkrhz,IAmTheFatman666,2,Tue Jun 30 02:42:44 2015 UTC,Awesome! How do you like the Speed? I really want to get it but I'm concerned about the paddle/motor (whatever it's called) being in the front and the balls not loading if I am shooting at an upward angle. Is this a problem at all? Thx
paintball,3bkrhz,bh473,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:11:50 2015 UTC,"I've had the speed for almost a year now and it is pretty damn good. Have yet to jam with it and the bend sensor only needs to be repositioned once in a while to keep feeding consistent. Pretty good purchase for the money.  Also, the angle would have to be really severe for it to stop feeding. You can still fight in most distances regardless. However be mindful of the low paint. After a certain point it won't feed but at that point you are already reloading."
paintball,3bkrhz,IAmTheFatman666,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:00:52 2015 UTC,"Fellow Speed owner here.    As the other guy said, it's not a major issue. Once you run low enough to have to worry about a feeding issue like that, you need to reload anyway. Rarely, if ever, will it be a problem."

paintball,3bo20j,cocorickoo,3,Tue Jun 30 19:33:20 2015 UTC,"no set up is going to get much lighter than any other up-to-date marker set up. only true changes you can make is an SL tank, they're significantly lighter than regular tanks. other than that, get used to the weight that you need, you'll find it's better to base your type of play and the guns shooting abilities more suitable than worrying about the weight in general."
paintball,3bo20j,onedollarbill,2,Tue Jun 30 19:56:27 2015 UTC,"If you want to go radical, consider a TIPx Pistol setup.    Alternatively, a stock-class Phantom is damn light and fun, too!"
paintball,3bo20j,stressedoutatumc,2,Wed Jul 1 00:02:09 2015 UTC,"Start bulkin bro.  But seriously you already have a very light weight set up thanks to the plastic body on the gryphoon, if you do decide to purchase a new marker your best bet would be a gog enmey ($129-149 depending if you get the updated valve or not) but really the weight differences would be negligible in the grand scheme of things.   If you really want to go light weight a stock class phantom or even an old pmi Trracer will be your best bet, but then you really have to get used to limited paint. Pistol play is another option if you can find a tipx for cheap enough."
paintball,3bo20j,mx63,1 point,Tue Jun 30 19:53:49 2015 UTC,Pistol play looks fun too but im not sure about it for the fields i play on. the fields are big and i'm used to shoot 1000 rounds per day.

But they are still run on compressed gas and everything else any other paintball gear is - with a couple details for distinction  If you hear/see someone refer to Stock Class pump. That one will use 12 gram CO2 cartridges and have a stick feed of around 10 balls  Open class refers to one that take a hopper (I run a Winchester 50) and some gas bottle bigger than the little 12 grams. Anything from 3oz co2 to any flavor of HPA.   And some folks will do a hybrid, like stick fed with a 3oz CO2  My pump is 'cocker bodied sans the Auto parts. I run a small hopper as mentioned and the same air bottles I use with my electro. But I might grab something smaller in the near future."
paintball,3bo20j,quinnosg,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:24:56 2015 UTC,Actually 'open' is just basically anything that doesn't qualify for stock while still being pump. There isn't such thing as 'hybrid'. Either you're stock or you're... not.

paintball,3bo20j,Thehostilehustle,1 point,Tue Jun 30 22:25:31 2015 UTC,Why should i remove my Remote and put the tank on the marker ? wouldn't it be better to keep the tank weight on my back ?

Only thing I would suggest is an aftermarket snub nose barrel 6-8"" for the spyder victor I have tried a 12"" and it seems like there's too much force and the balls want to break in the barrel I'd go snub nose and its light as all hell ! Is back heavy and doesn't have the best fore grip found best to shoulder tank and shoot on a slight angle seeing as feedneck sits in the middle of the gun rather than being off set ( design flaw ) anyways would highly recommend this setup for a beginner !

paintball,3blr6p,bleedsmarinara,3,Tue Jun 30 15:27:57 2015 UTC,Dye UL pants will be the coolest pants you can get IMO. They're not exactly a bargain at $200 retail but they're light and breathable.
paintball,3blr6p,Kabosui,2,Tue Jun 30 09:51:06 2015 UTC,"The UL pants are as breathable as it's going to get, without going the birthday suit or kilt option. The UL pants have zero padding, just venting. (There is a little padding to make having a pod harness a bit more comfortable, but that's it.)  $200 can be a little steep (considering the whole concept is about minimal material.) I think they are definitely worth it if you are playing in hot environments.  Edit: just a side note, I own these pants and the UL jersey... The feeling of a cool breeze over sweety parts feels absolutely amazing. (The jersey is basically a loose under armor long sleeve shirt.)"

paintball,3blr6p,Bergauk,2,Tue Jun 30 16:49:13 2015 UTC,I've been wearing Empire Contact Zero F5's for about 4 months now and they're super breathable. Lots of holes everywhere.
paintball,3blr6p,psyco45,2,Tue Jun 30 07:16:24 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind the outside temp.  If its hotter than 98.6F then your pants actually serve as insulation from the outside rather than traping heat in.  Have you ever seen landscapers wear heavy flannel in the dead of summer?  Its because its actually cooler inside their shirt than it is outside. I use this alot when i work outside, been camping in the deserts durring the summer, and in general.  What you want is moister wicking vs. breathable.  It will help you alot more.    If your not used to it or have never heard of it its going to be hard to understand, but trust me it works."
paintball,3blr6p,orangetoaster,2,Tue Jun 30 14:04:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think that is how that would work. Your body does not simply stop producing heat once it is at 98.6, the insulation/padding will trap heat inside the pants as well as keep the sun from adding more heat on the inside.  Long sleeves and flannel is worn because it keeps the sun off of their skin, flannel will wick moisture/sweat off the skin, pulling sweat off (via wicking or evaporation) is what cools the body Source. A breathable pair of pants will help cause evaporation  Another thing to keep in mind is the color of the pants, lighter color clothes will reflect more energy (light/radiation/heat)."
paintball,3blr6p,psyco45,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:43:47 2015 UTC,"It pretty much does work like that, I have a lifetime of experience dealing why high heat high humidity from high deserts inWest Texas to the Gulf Coast area in Louisiana.  I have been in the desert in 105+ easy and always wear long pants long sleeve.  Im not saying wear ski pants to keep heat in.  Just saying there is an insulating effect.  I go hiking in Big Bend about once a year for a week or 2 at a time, and I worked cattle in Louisiana on my families ranch.  You want to vent, but not expose your self.  You also want wicking not moisture."
paintball,3blr6p,Claclink,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:01:43 2015 UTC,"I live in Tucson, AZ.  It is hotter than 100 degrees every day.  No one wears sweatpants around to keep cool, lol.  Look at people in Africa, they walk around naked for a reason. The reason a breeze still keeps you cool in temperatures higher than 98.6 degrees is because our body uses sweat as a way to cool off.  The breeze greatly accelerates the evaporation of water from your body cooling you off.  White people who aren't used to the sun wear long sleeves to protect from sunburn not to cool off.  I can promise you I am way cooler when I take my shirt off."
paintball,3blr6p,psyco45,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:28:59 2015 UTC,What effect would 100% humidity and 105 degree weather have?
paintball,3blr6p,Claclink,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:08 2015 UTC,Yea because that happens all the time.
paintball,3blr6p,orangetoaster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:18:14 2015 UTC,"Right, I don't disagree that long sleeves and pants are actually good in sun. I worked construction for 15 years and never wore shorts or went without a shirt. Reducing direct exposure to the sun (and its radiation) will keep your temperature down. What I meant was insulated/padded will also keep heat generated from your body trapped increasing discomfort/heat.  A better example would probably be armpads, removing the insulating affect of the pads will do more for your temperature than removing a long sleeve jersey (unless it is a dark color)."

paintball,3bkcpl,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:13:51 2015 UTC,I thought the same thing. Why not get a drop forward and have a little bigger tank and be more comfortable. Then having a little peanut tank and still be in the way
paintball,3bkcpl,socks86,1 point,Tue Jun 30 00:18:23 2015 UTC,"Because taller doesnt mean better. A drop forward adds unwanted height. Back in the day, this was an acceptable trade off. Now that tanks are waaayyy smaller, theres no need to add height. It causes the marker to be more unbalanced. 77ci tanks are the size of 68cis from just a few years ago. Those mammoth 68s just arent around anymore."
paintball,3bkcpl,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:20:04 2015 UTC,Very true. Thanks for explaining it to me.
paintball,3bkcpl,socks86,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:07 2015 UTC,"Tank size has littlw to do with it.  Drops were on the way out long before the tanks got smaller. The style changed,  and people figured out that its just better to have a longer gun for running and shooting and etc. Running and shooting wasnt really much of a thing until 10 years ago, ish. Airball fields also came along and you can play just as tight with a longer marker on the more 3d bunkers."
paintball,3bkcpl,cptzanzibar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"Well, thats your opinion. Tanks used to be longer. I got rid of drops because of tank length. Most players I know did the same.

paintball,3bkcpl,Session99,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:37:09 2015 UTC,"Tanks used to be longer. I got rid of drops because of tank length. Most players I know did the same.   Whatever you say. Go look at some pictures from tournaments in 2003 onwards. The tanks were still huge yet drop forwards are almost nowhere to be found. The guns were still heavy as fuck compared to what we have now too. The tanks have gotten much smaller overall but in length they have gotten an inch shorter,  max.   Yes I read the part about how much height they add,  and I dont disagree."
paintball,3bkcpl,cptzanzibar,1 point,Wed Jul 1 20:45:58 2015 UTC,"Im looking, still seeing plenty of drops. The only markers im really seeing, and even remember seeing without drops at that time were SFT Shockers.   An inch shorter? The tanks I posted are 2.6 inches different in length. If the old tank still had its original reg, it would be over 3 inches, guaranteed."
paintball,3bkcpl,Session99,0,Wed Jul 1 20:52:09 2015 UTC,"68's have been the same size forever. This is mis-information. People ran silly drops back in the day because they thought they could rely on equipment to make them play ""tighter"". They actually just had shitty gun skills. Though 114ci tanks were common. And a drop forward helped with these."
paintball,3bkcpl,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:13:46 2015 UTC,No they arent the same size. I have 2 68s that are 10 years apart and they are noticeably different in size.

paintball,3bkcpl,socks86,1 point,Wed Jul 1 02:32:41 2015 UTC,Thats not a huge difference in length... I was running a tank that size wothout a drop forward as far back as 0 I would say.  The tanks getting smaller isnt the reason drops went away.  It was just the style then before people figuted out the advantages of javing a longer setup.  Airball fields probably had a lot to do with it as well.
paintball,3bkcpl,abrooks1125,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:23:40 2015 UTC,"Whatever you say bud. The size difference is very noticeable, especially on the marker. Tanks getting smaller is a huge reason as to why they went away. Is it the only reason? No. But for you to say its mis-information that tank length had nothing to do with drops going away is dishonest. I got rid of my drops exactly because tanks got smaller.  Besides, you said:   68's have been the same size forever. This is mis-information.   And that is false."

Lmao so go look at some pictures from 2003 or so. Tanks hadnt started to shrink yet, drops almost nowhere to be found.    I got rid of my drops exactly because tanks got smaller.   I dont believe you. Drops. typically moved the tank down and forward several inches. Even today the tanks are only an inch or so shorter than they were 10 years ago.  Diameter isnt as important.

paintball,3bkrdu,Caliboy50124,2,Tue Jun 30 00:53:48 2015 UTC,"To convert you will need the MKP-II conversion kit.  Basically drop-in replacement clamshells and magwell, with some minor attachments like a plug for where the cyclone originally goes.  I was just down at RAP4's retail store in California, and one of the guys mentioned something about a new ""Helix"" mag that will be available hopefully next week.  Might be worth waiting for a couple days.  Almost all X7/Phenom platform stuff should carry over to the new body, as it uses exactly the same internals and engine.  If you have any more questions, let me know, I ran an MKP-II for a couple years before moving to a 468."

paintball,3bkrdu,MaxPowerzs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"Ok thanks for telling me these things. I just have a few more questions. Is it worth converting my phenom over buying a magfed marker? Also if I were to buy a new mag fed whats a decent one that's not too expensive. My last question is how did the MKP-II work for you? I have seen good and bad things about it. Was it easy to assemble, maintain, and use? Thanks!"
paintball,3bkrdu,kapyrna,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:34:42 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed having the same engine and accessory platform available if I wanted to go magfed or hopperfed, so converting was the way to go for me.  I also ended up with a boneyard Phenom so I cobbled together a second complete marker as a backup.  The second ended up getting converted as well, and the first was sold to finance some optics and blackrifle stuff.  If you're looking to get into magfed at the cheapest cost possible, and you have a 98 Custom or similar marker, there is an adapter that goes in place of the hopper elbow that takes mags designed for the TiPX pistol.  This won't require any thing other than a 10-second part swap, if you've got the rest of the stuff for it.  Another great option is a TiPX pistol itself, I used to use two as a primary pair, and now have one as a sidearm or just by itself if I feel crazy.  If you don't mind used, a good package can be had for under $200 on various BST pages.  Another solid option for magfed are older Milsig markers or Scarab Arms, or the Milsig M17 for a more recent platform.  Tiberius makes great pistols as well if you can find one in good condition, and I like their T15 once some minor kinks are worked out.  I did have a small issue with one set of clamshells for my MKP, one pair was unmatched enough that the firing mechanism bound sometimes, though swapping shells between pairs worked fine for both sets.  RAP4 swapped out the shells for me, as one set was painted and the defective set was factory black.  Their machine that was out of tolerance has since been fixed, I'm told.  As far as use and maintenance, should be pretty much the same as a stock Phenom.  A couple things that are almost necessary to have are the Lok-Bolt (essentially a mechanical eye), and the extended magazine release.  It took me an hour on the field to get things dialed in perfectly, then smooth sailing from there.  Of note, the TechT bolts are great for efficiency, but the softer bolt tips will get chewed apart by the delrin of the Lok-Bolt, especially if you have the electronic trigger.  Are you planning on getting a small tank to be fitted in place of a stock, or using the ASA off the grip still?"

Your only real options there are 1) Hydrodipping (above... in my experience doesn't work well on aluminum) and 2) Annodizing.

paintball,3bif00,cptzanzibar,3,Thu Jul 2 15:37:50 2015 UTC,Depends if you like popping valves or spool valves. I'd personally go with the Geo.. Quieter & efficiency is still decent

paintball,3bif00,xluminosityx,3,Tue Jun 30 12:36:04 2015 UTC,Geo 3 is only slightly behine the Ego in efficiency and is a huge improvement in about every other regard.
paintball,3bif00,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:41:56 2015 UTC,A Geo 3 with a core bolt should shoot nearly the same as a 3.5 once it's broken in.  The bolt alone makes the Geo the best option.

paintball,3bif00,SolidKeevo,1 point,Tue Jun 30 13:33:13 2015 UTC,"I own a Geo 3, G6R, and LV1. The Geo 3 is by far my favourite. Sold my Ego 11 in favor of it. G6R's are very awesome markers, but a bit too unreliable for tournament play in my opinion. I've only had it go down once on me in the year I've owned it, but my Geo has never failed me. If you can find one with a IV core or one separate for cheap, snag one up. Much more efficient and a quieter/smoother shot."

You could also get a pair of Dye UL's, they'll provide all the comfort you need but aren't padded at all and are a little more expensive. Stay away from HK pants. I recommend them to anyone but not someone who's main concern is flexibility. Good for everyone else though"
paintball,3bhbbu,walkoffaith,2,Mon Jun 29 15:26:37 2015 UTC,"Are UL's really worth the price? I looked at some, and they look amazing, but $200 for a pair of pants? I'm sure a lot of that is the Dye name, but if they're worth it, then it's OK."

paintball,3bh9cr,Caliboy50124,2,Mon Jun 29 05:14:58 2015 UTC,"Ok, if your gonna get a rap4 kit for your phenom get the newer  MKP-II kit, it's better designed than the old one.  Now regarding switching it back it's very easy, just put the internals back in the old body, put the cyclone back on and your good to go.  As for mags, it will take dmags, which people will definitely argue the merits of, but the general consensus is, they aren't as durable as other mags, but they are cheap, $10 a piece, I personally haven't had any break on me but anything short of jumping in them and you'll be fine. My biggest issue is that it's got two stacks of 10, that'll be fixed by the new helix mag which is a continuous 20 round mag, that is compatible with the dmag magwell.  If you wanna shoot first strike, you'll have to either modify your bolt or get the rap4 first strike bolt for the phenom, reason being the stock bolt will catch the fin and flip it backwards.  Now for quality, the body itself is solid, the only issue with the kit is the mags are a little tough to put in, other than that, it's a great gun."
paintball,3bh9cr,Wozrop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:44:33 2015 UTC,Thanks for sharing this. Now I just have one more question regarding something you said before. First off should I get a Lok bolt? I will most likely only use mags... maybe a box mag. Also what exactly is the first strike bolt? Does it replace the Lok bolt and is it easy to set up? Thanks.
paintball,3bh9cr,Wozrop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 22:09:30 2015 UTC,"I think you should get a lokbolt, I don't have one but I hear a lot of great things so there's a chance that could change very soon :) it will help any time you use high rates of fire and tells you when your out of paintballs and have to reload.  Ok now the first strike bolt is a modified phenom bolt that works a lot better with first strikes, it replaces your stock bolt and is actually expected to be used it conjunction with a lokbolt. It's as simple as taking out the power tube, taking off the spring and the bolt, then new bolt old spring, back in the gun, the difference between a stock bolt and the rap4 bolt is that the modified one has a taper on the end of it, It's better for shooting first strikes as there's less chance of it smashing the fun off, and it's a touch thinner at the taper so that the gap between the oring and the end of the bolt doesn't catch a first strike and spin it backwards.  If you have any more questions let me know"

As we have no airsoft companies/players here we need those with the sport to tell our politicians the benefits. Even New Zealand has airsoft! So they do make a difference...there is only so much we down here can say.  As for it's illegality, when we had a massive shooting back in the early 90's, the government at the time brought in all these super restrictive gun laws. Airsoft was barely a thing back then and wasn't properly cared for under the laws, instead a ""get rid of it all"" mentality was taken. Now the arguement that airsoft is lethal/can be modified to be lethal is used a lot as well as ""they look real"". Paintball has suffered from a lot of these laws and yet just managed to keep going (is still illegal in at least 1 state to my knowledge.)"

paintball,3bgol0,AnBu_JR,2,Mon Jun 29 02:30:58 2015 UTC,Slps spring kits for snipers work great. I had the best results with an slps valve spring and a ccm main spring (wgp valve/hammer). Way lighter than stock.
paintball,3bgol0,noided1111,2,Mon Jun 29 02:40:47 2015 UTC,Maddman sells spring kits. If you're using Nelson ones in your cockers and snipers you'll need to clip them a little.

paintball,3bh3ks,Fikap4us,3,Mon Jun 29 04:18:24 2015 UTC,I started out with a gog enmy and I think it's a really good gun if you are new to the sport and on a budget. I still play with the gog instead of my Etek 4 sometimes.
paintball,3bh3ks,novonn,2,Mon Jun 29 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"You have some options for under $300.  Brand new you could get a GoG Enmey for 150, and a Carbon Fiber Ninja Tank for 150.  Used you are more flexible. You can get a used Axe for around 250, and a Metal Ninja Tank for (New) 50  A used Etek 3/4 for around 200-250 also.

paintball,3bh3ks,TheAmazingLeech,2,Mon Jun 29 22:37:41 2015 UTC,Try to think because your reasoning for him to get the ion isn't needed. If he gets an enemy he can.afford a a.hopper still.   He.doesn't need an ion currently.
paintball,3bh3ks,xluminosityx,-2,Mon Jun 29 22:43:31 2015 UTC,If he buys a GoG he won't be happy with it...  Why suggest a bad marker.
paintball,3bh3ks,TheAmazingLeech,2,Tue Jun 30 02:44:53 2015 UTC,What the hell are you talking about. The enemy is the best starter on the marker and the.envy.is a rebodied ion. All still made by the same guys who made the ion too.  Not to mention their guns are highly loved by the starter market as well as the experienced.  Do you have a brain injury?
paintball,3bh3ks,xluminosityx,-2,Tue Jun 30 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"The Gog does not have an on/off, it's feedneck is not great, and it's internals are not nearly as good as the ion.  Fuck off some where dude.  Stop pretending to know anything about paintball."

You Fuck off you half wit. While the ion is.a Great first electro, it isn't what this guy seems to be looking for.  Stop being arrogant just because someone disagreed with you."

Enmeys are super fun and and very reliable."
paintball,3bh3ks,miketerry1992,0,Tue Jun 30 14:40:48 2015 UTC,I always recommend Tippman like a 98 Custom or a-5 super reliable easy to tear down and repair. I agree with everyone in regards to the tank HPA all day.
paintball,3bh3ks,TheAmazingLeech,0,Mon Jun 29 15:08:54 2015 UTC,"If you think a 98 or an a5 is easy to tear down, you must be like a robot.  Compared to the gog enemy neither of those tear down as quickly or are as easy to care for. Simplicity in a single marker."
paintball,3bh3ks,iamthelouie,2,Mon Jun 29 19:13:43 2015 UTC,"if i could go back in time and tell my younger self to avoid the 98, i would.  Its hard to clean, heavy, and if a real money hole.  save your money and get something like the go enmy.  I run with an old SP-Vibe, which is pretty much the gog Envy.  you can find them on eBay or craigslist for decent prices.  Easy to clean and upgradable."
paintball,3bgwei,wallyg12345,4,Mon Jun 29 03:01:04 2015 UTC,That's about right...   the G5 is a dump chamber type spool valve. It's a basic type of spool valve.  It's not meant to be efficient... with a 77/4500 you should get around 9ish  pods so that's about right.. hopper + 7 pods.

paintball,3bfl2u,kapyrna,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:05:03 2015 UTC,Thx for this advice. I have actually thought the same thing and I have decided that for the most part I will stick with mags. I just thought a box mag would be good if I wanted some more ammo for a couple of games.
paintball,3bfl2u,novonn,2,Sun Jun 28 21:53:03 2015 UTC,It's REALLY only for big games. It's large and heavy.
paintball,3bfl2u,Averageboi,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:10:01 2015 UTC,"Overall, I think it's worth converting. The Phenom is a solid platform with a decent level of efficiency.               If you convert it, I'd strongly suggest getting the lok-bolt upgrade. It basically works as a sort of mechanical eye system and prevents chops. (I had the tacamo MKP-II conversion and before the lok-bolt, I'd get TONS of chops.)           The box-mag works like any hopper, and is comparable to the cyclone feed (assuming you have the lok-bolt, otherwise it'll chop a lot). In my opinion though, the cyclone feed works better because it doesn't need batteries, and the box mag still has left-over balls in it when it's ""empty"" because it feeds upwards instead of downwards. That being said, it's easier to put the box mag in when you want to feed a lot more paint than it is to swap it back to the cyclone feed."
paintball,3bfl2u,Averageboi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:29:08 2015 UTC,"I'm looking into this lok bolt it's just I need to know some things first. Like if I can still use my rap4 attachments if I get the lok bolt or even on the kit. So actually if you read this I would like to know if you could answer one more thing. Will I even be able to use my attachments with the conversion kit and the lok bolt? I use the m4a1 style barrel, stock, and gun handle. They are all from rap4."
paintball,3bfl2u,Silentwalrus8346,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:56:25 2015 UTC,"Pretty much every Phenom mod is compatible. One thing I noticed though, is that there's some jiggle to the front railing system, but if you get some electrical tape and put it on the connector parts, it should get rid of that (if you get any jiggle). In short, any foregrip/stocks/barrels you used before will still be usable."
paintball,3bfl2u,AlaxisXeon,1 point,Sun Jun 28 22:41:20 2015 UTC,Thank yo this has really helped me.
paintball,3bfl2u,Wozrop,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:23:27 2015 UTC,"Firstly, I don't know of any other kits besides the Tacamo.   Secondly, Box mags are basically hoppers with cyclone feeds. But they suit the whole scenario scene better (and the look fucking badass)  To answer your final question. It's totally up to you. I would recommend finding a buddy at your local field who uses magfed and talk to him about it (Or take a magfed gun for a test run). Magfed isn't for everyone, you need to be careful of how much paint you use otherwise you're screwed.   I personally love (and only play) magfed because I'm in the same boat as you, I love the realism that comes with it. If you want more info, feel free to PM me. It's pretty late here and I'm very tired, so I could be talking out my ass, I'll edit this in the morning when I have more energy."
paintball,3bf8ig,mooseyman87,10,Sun Jun 28 18:15:25 2015 UTC,Mostly it's for peace of mind that you'll never have to worry about the loader not feeding and you'll always have a paintball ready to shoot.
paintball,3bf8ig,AndrewTheWookiee,6,Sun Jun 28 18:21:45 2015 UTC,"most people are probably just using the hoppers they already have. Still, even at the low ROF of a pump I've still had my gravity hopper fail to feed, usually if the marker isn't quite vertical"

paintball,3bf8ig,moosecakems,2,Sun Jun 28 19:14:54 2015 UTC,"No difference in fire rate between a good gravity feed and a force loader. I use a modded Winchester for 50 ish rounds, a Pico hopper (inception designs) for forced 100 rounds, a Promo for gravity feed lot o rounds, and either a V2 or Z2 prophecy for forced lots o rounds. I like not having to worry about batteries, but the Pico lasts a few games and is damn convenient."

paintball,3bf8ig,StockClassCanadian,3,Sun Jun 28 18:59:24 2015 UTC,I use gravity hoppers by choice (app 50) I got into the habit pretty quickly of occasionally giving my marker a couple shakes here and there to keep the paint rolling. I prefer the low weight and size of a small pocket hopper
paintball,3bf8ig,Claclink,2,Sun Jun 28 19:27:33 2015 UTC,I think a proto primo or a cheap agitation hopper will do fine.  Even an old VL revy if you can find one.  You don't realize how much you shake your hopper until you go to a electronic hopper then back to a standard one.
paintball,3bf8ig,mazu747,2,Sun Jun 28 19:28:07 2015 UTC,My Proto primo works wonderfully. I really only use my rotor for speedball when not having one in the hole could be disastrous.
paintball,3bf8ig,Agglet,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:34:45 2015 UTC,"You'll definitely be able to output a higher rate of fire with an electronic hopper. Mcarterbrown had a contest a while back for this, and people were achieving close to semi auto ROFS auto triggering on ccms.   It's also just personal preference. You won't have to worry about a gravity hopper not loading, but you'll also have to deal with the extra weight."
paintball,3bf8ig,NotYoFriendGuy1,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:41:08 2015 UTC,"It's about either A: carrying more shots than the lower capacity grav-fed hoppers, or B: guaranteeing a feed when you know you'll need it most (like a tournament situation).  A lot of people also prefer a smaller capacity, or even 10-round-tube feeds, as it raises the challenge, and gives a handicap that bridges the gap when playing with newbies. Also, I've had virtually no feeding issues with both my ""50-round"" APP hopper and with my homemade 10-round-tube adapter."

It allows me to auto trigger if I have to without pulling the bolt on a ball that Is being gravity fed. It's the extra assurance that the ball is being force fed that is nice. However you are trading off weight for loading speed as the mini rotor and the inception Pico are heavier than shake and bakes. If I want to shoot a lot of paint, I'll use a vl2000.

paintball,3bfv8s,IdiomIdyll,3,Sun Jun 28 21:25:01 2015 UTC,"Everyone here will recommend buying used.  You can get an Etek 3, or an axe used for about 275-300.  or you can buy a GoG eXTCy new for around 250."
paintball,3bfv8s,StopEating5KCalories,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:41:41 2015 UTC,Thanks for the reply. I think buying used is a good idea. I really like the look and reviews for the Etek 3. Any similar markers in that price range and look/feel?
paintball,3bfv8s,StopEating5KCalories,3,Sun Jun 28 23:30:17 2015 UTC,Some of the older Dye models I believe are similar.  there's an age old debate of whether axe or eteks are better.  If you like how the etek looks more than the way the axe looks....go for it...they are basically the same thing.
paintball,3bfv8s,StopEating5KCalories,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:45:32 2015 UTC,"As far as mechanical models are concerned, do they even match up and are there some worth investing in? (Something like the GoG eNMEy - autococker, simple, cheap)"
paintball,3bfv8s,SlidePanda,1 point,Sun Jun 28 23:59:34 2015 UTC,"match up? as in like, compete in a speedball field?  if you're playing against other people with electronic markers, no, your mechanical marker probably will not compete.  Lots of people prefer mechanical markers because they use less paint, and are more fun to take care of (if you're into that kind of thing)."
paintball,3bfv8s,socks86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:06:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I meant more in terms of quality and recommend-ability. I really like the nuts and bolts simplicity of taking care of mech markers and the ability to easily take them apart. I don't expect to be competing with speedball players, but want to be versatile when I just play with friends and non competitively. I also have no real use or interest in full auto guns, I really like the single trigger pull aspect of the markers I've used in the past."
paintball,3bfv8s,StopEating5KCalories,2,Mon Jun 29 00:11:25 2015 UTC,"Theres plenty of good mechanical options. And if you're a tinker, you can do a lot. Back when I built out an actually rather nice, low pressure Spyder. Total money sink, but it was a fun project.  My go to mechanical was a nice Autococker. Without 'cocker nerding out, once I tuned it, it was constant, reliable and (to others) obnoxiously efficient. Getting around 1600 shots of a slightly larger than normal 4500 bottle. Older Dye Throttle - I want to say 72 cubic inches."
paintball,3bfv8s,socks86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:53:36 2015 UTC,That is decent efficiency but for a modern reference point the enmey will get about that many shots from a fill.
paintball,3bfv8s,socks86,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:43:06 2015 UTC,"Then, You might want to look into pump guns.  You sound like the kind of person who would get into pump play."
paintball,3bfv8s,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:47:52 2015 UTC,"Autococker,  automag,  gog enmey.  In no particular order,  but those three are right up your alley.   Cockers are infinitely customizable and tuneable Mags are infinitely customizable and the just work. Like,  every time you pull it out of the gear bag. If you have a problem there are 2- things youd check to figure it out,  and replace an oring.   The enmey is possibly the best bang for the buck on the market right now. Rare platform. It is a mechanical spool valve design. Semi automatic,  smooth and quiet shot quality, lightweight,  and pretty efficient to boot.   If you want a fun project you might look into building a mechanical ion (or just buy the enmey).   A ULE auomag build might be in your budget as well."
paintball,3bfv8s,iAllxn,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:44:52 2015 UTC,As long as you dont suck a mech gun works just fine for speedball.  It wasnt so  ago that mech guna were the norm for tournament guns.   I will recommend a mech gun 10 out of 10 times to newer players that want to get better. Its a lot of fun to shoot lanes with an electro but it doesnt do much tondevelop your skill set.

(E-flexes go for around 70 used, Vios go for around 100 used.) edit: Everyone's going to probably suggest a proflex. I used to have one, and loved it, but the E-Flex is much better in my opinion due to the lens change being significantly easier."

paintball,3bew3h,ventilatorminer,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:59:33 2015 UTC,Yes if it fits your head. If you have a smallish head then this is a great mask.
paintball,3bew3h,iAllxn,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:14:54 2015 UTC,A mask would be the one thing I would not cheap out on.  Just try on whatever mask is available at your proshop and buy one.  Thankfully you can snag a proshield for cheap

paintball,3bew3h,TheReturned,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:46:25 2015 UTC,The mask should be the one thing if any that you don't cheap out on. Even if the one that fits you perfectly is a higher price like 150 just go with it and cut your budget somewhere else. Wearing a mask that is not properly fitting to your head can be very annoying
paintball,3bew3h,StockClassCanadian,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:47:35 2015 UTC,What is decently priced? Because I'd have to vouch for Vio Extends...they cover almost everywhere and are very comfy. They also have a visor with space for a fan to install inside.  Of course Flexes and E-vents are great masks too. Along with profilers.

paintball,3beb98,MightBeDoge,14,Sun Jun 28 12:35:55 2015 UTC,"The main advantages of aftermarket barrels are the looks, ability to adjust the bore size, and the additional porting they have (the holes on the tip of the barrel). The porting makes your marker quieter, and have a different sound signature.      Barrels between the sizes of 10-16 will all have the same accuracy. Anything longer/shorter will then cause your accuracy to go down. The advantages to having a barrel on the longer side are that it makes your marker less loud and allows you to manipulate the air bunkers in speedball better. Shorter barrels allow you to play tighter.      Bore size affects consistency and efficiency. This is the diameter of the inner barrel. If you get a barrel that's slightly smaller than the paintballs you're using, you'll get better efficiency (known as underboreing) but you'll have a higher chance of getting barrel breaks. If you get a barrel that has a bigger diameter than the paintballs you're using, you'll generally have better consistency, but your efficiency goes down (known as overboreing). That being said, it's better to either under or overbore since paint matching causes some crazy consistency issues.  Generally, stock barrels, as long as they're over 10 inches, are pretty much all you need.   I personally overbore unless I'm using a pump. I don't really like having to take my swab out every round.  Efficiency = you use less air per shot Consistency = your shots have a tighter FPS range"
paintball,3beb98,Averageboi,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:53:41 2015 UTC,"Hey thanks for the write up, extremely informative."
paintball,3beb98,currentlyonthepooper,-8,Sun Jun 28 17:01:35 2015 UTC,"No its not all for looks. Barrel length can improve accuracy in your marker, also not aftermarket barrels have a caliber number on them. If you match that number with the caliber number of the case of paint you just bought, you should get a straight shot. Also try putting the ball through your barrel before putting it on the gun. If it can roll through just fine then that's no good.  Maybe look into freak kits. They have a bunch of different caliber sleeves you can swap out so you always have the right sized barrel for the paint you're using."

I've held a 3.5, and it's pretty comfortable, but the grips aren't as squishy as you might think.  If you want to have reliability proven to you, here's a torture test of Planet Eclipse's Etha, their mid-end gun. The Geo is one of their high ends, so you know it should be able to take more abuse than the Etha.  Honestly, though, you should have little to no problems with your gun, assuming you maintain it regularly. I like to take my markers apart and re-lube after every weekend, but some could say that's overdoing it. All I've got to say to that is that my markers have never broken down on me at the field."

paintball,3bcamn,Bircher,11,Sat Jun 27 21:23:26 2015 UTC,"A rifle is more accurate than a pistol because of a lot of factors, the barrel length is not necessarily at the top of that list. In fact, swapping different length barrels on a rifle does not seem to affect the accuracy on that rifle.  But that's a moot point anyway, because paintballs are imperfect spheroids with a liquid filling. They're just such shitty projectiles that anything a barrel might do is lost in the random noise due to the paintballs themselves. Basically, if the barrel is long enough to get them up to velocity and point in a straight line (apex/flatline not withstanding) that's all it can do."

Folks have made, and still do make spiral rifled barrels. But they do very little if anything.  Tippmans Flatline and the Apex do work by spinning the ball and do have an notable effect. But they are spinning them, like back spin on a base ball to extend range or cause a curve.   Though the flatline does extend the range, the balls are going slower once they have passed the ""normal range"" and are less likely to deliver a break. Been pelted with plenty a Flatline long ball that didn't break even hitting harder items."

paintball,3bcamn,socks86,2,Sat Jun 27 22:42:29 2015 UTC,Because longer barrels increase muzzle velocity by focussing the force for longer.  Markers have restricted muzzle velocities.
paintball,3bcamn,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:30:37 2015 UTC,Too an extent.  After a certain length (typically after 6-9 inches depending on the marker) yoi are only hurting efficiency.

paintball,3bcamn,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"It really depends on the gun. If you're dumping extra air down the barrel, a longer barrel will take better advantage of it. Think dump valve vs poppet."
paintball,3bcamn,ahabswhale,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:28:10 2015 UTC,"Poppet guns do use a dump chamber...  That ""extra"" air is so low pressure and so slow it has basically no effect on velocity.  Thats why most guns try to limit and/or capture any excess (IV Core is a prime example)."
paintball,3bcamn,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 19:59:50 2015 UTC,"I think the Paragon is the prime example.  By dump chamber I was thinking more along the lines of Ion. Sure poppets use a chamber, but it's not emptied."
paintball,3bcamn,Bigasssheep,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:24:41 2015 UTC,Which doesnt neccessarily equate to increased accuracy.  Flatter projectory? Sure.  The faster a projectile moves the more any turbulence will affect it which is very noticable with paintballs.
paintball,3bcamn,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Sun Jun 28 13:22:45 2015 UTC,"But paintball are always restricted to around 300fps, therefore negating any changes in velocity resulting from barrel length"
paintball,3bcamn,Bigasssheep,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:08:08 2015 UTC,"No, more efficient use of the air leads to higher velocity at the same operating pressure which means you can lower that pressure and still reach the same velocity.

paintball,3bcamn,Claclink,2,Sun Jun 28 13:23:56 2015 UTC,"Longer barrel doesn't make magical accuracy in airsoft either. It's consistency that effects that the most. Cobrawhatshisname used a ~11in bar 10 barrel in a gbb pistol, was able to get ""sniper"" groupings with it.  To increase paintball accuracy the less fps varies the more each shot will fly about the same, paint quality and size, barrel bore, consistency of regs, etc can all effect overall consistency. It's a lot harder to control than a spring airsoft gun"
paintball,3bcamn,DarkLordSnuffles,2,Sun Jun 28 00:21:04 2015 UTC,"Longer rifle barrels are not more accurate.  I do a lot of long range rifle hunting.  A big reason a rifle is more accurate is the action.  A bolt action rifle keeps the cartridge stationary until you pull the bolt back.  A semi-auto gun lets the cartridge move backwards during the shot.  Any movement inside the chamber causes inconsistencies in your shot.  Also rifles are much easier to aim.  A shoulder rest, a heavier gun, a rifle scope all make aiming easier.   If you are really fine tuning a gun, the length and weight of the barrel can be adjusted slightly to minimize the affects of vibrations as the bullet leaves the end of your barrel.  It has to do with vibration harmonics.  Most rifles ignore this effect, but if you are shooting more than 500 yards, it is something you have to account for.    Not going to matter with a paintball gun.  A longer paintball barrel will feel more accurate.  A longer barrel is easier to aim with a human eye.  Think about trying to accurately aim a gun with a 2"" barrel compared to a 36"" barrel.  A longer barrel makes it easier for our eyes to estimate where the gun is pointed.  At the end of the day the paintball is exiting through a hole at the end of the barrel at 280 fps.  It is traveling straight and it shouldn't have any spin on it at this point.  How long the paintball was traveling through the tube before this moment is irrelevant."
paintball,3bcamn,Lepadep,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:41:07 2015 UTC,"Because smoothbore barrels, sphere-shaped projectiles and some weird sciency stuff."
paintball,3bcamn,WalterReddit,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:26:44 2015 UTC,"To my understanding, in regards to firearms when a barrel is longer, it allows the bullet to spin for a longer duration due to the barrels rifling. That increase spin results in a more stable flight trajectory. However, you cant really apply that concept to a paintball because like others have said it is a horrible projectile. It's spherical, half filled with liquid, and often times have imperfections such has dimples and an oil coating. I remember someone describing a paintball to me like a water balloon half filled with water, you can't really throw it accurately."
paintball,3bcamn,HotSAuceMagik,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:15:28 2015 UTC,probably because it only needs so long before any error in the acceleration of the ball has been corrected
paintball,3bcamn,cameroncac,1 point,Sun Jun 28 01:15:54 2015 UTC,"One thing that has not been mentioned- a longer barrel will generally help your first shot in terms of aiming.

Screw in your tank so it pins the oring between the top of the tank and the asa. It will create a seal.   Also, too many players do not degas their markers while attempting to take a tank off if their on/off does not purge when turned off. Unscrew your tank a quarter turn and shoot off the air.

paintball,3b83np,SaltySalad69,1 point,Sat Jun 27 00:30:17 2015 UTC,"If it's just a little backyard ball, Tipmman 98 is the kind of user-friendly gun that even if you don't clean it thoroughly (if much at all) it will still function.   They are also incredibly durable. If anyone in your family has experience with Paintball guns, I would ask them to find you one off of Craigslist and save yourself some money. You can also look on PBnation BST, which IMO is much more reputable: http://www.pbnation.com/forumdisplay.php?f=144&order=desc  A lot of times they come with CO2 tanks as well, which will also save money (as long as they are younger than 5 years old of the printed date found here:  http://www.abcpaintball.com/images/hydrotest/hydro_date_co2.jpg  A used Tippmann 98 I wouldn't pay more than maybe $60 at the absolute most (and even then I'd feel like I was getting kicked in the nuts). Try and find closer to $40, as I've seen them now and again. Also, tell them to throw in the hopper.  Buy a decent mask (not used unless there is little to no wear). this mask is probably your best bet for a cheap but very reliable mask.  If you aren't playing super seriously, the cheapest Air option is CO2: http://www.discountpaintball.com/20-oz-Aluminum-Co2-Tank-for-Paintball_p_624.html  Otherwise, HPA is more reliable: http://www.ansgear.com/Ninja_Paintball_Tanks_s/1398.htm?searching=Y&sort=1&cat=1398&show=3000&page=1  You'll need a barrel swab:  http://www.ansgear.com/ANS_Single_Flex_Swab_Squeegee_Red_p/anssingleflexswabred.htm  And a also a barrel sleeve: http://www.ansgear.com/Extreme_Rage_Barrel_Plugs_Covers_s/1518.htm  All told, the cheapest you could get setup for with what I've listed:  Tippmann 98 + hopper = $40-60  Mask: $30-35  Tank: $15-50  Barrel Swab: $2  Barrel Sleeve: $5  Total: ~$90-150"

The etek and axe and all of those guns are amazing, but it may not be what you are looking for. The standard rental gun is the tippman 98, and I highly recommend you to avoid it at all costs. Valken makes really nice woodball/senario guns so I would start there.

Think about which costs more: buying a new marker or paying medical bills for a broken rib? A lot of people complained about this to companies who had this happen, like planet eclipse. When the LV1 came out, they reinforced the grip frame so that it wouldn't bend, but if you land on it, you're not going to have a fun time"
paintball,3b6j64,socks86,5,Fri Jun 26 14:31:56 2015 UTC,"The reason why they break is entirely for the safety of the shooter.   Yeah thats bullshit. Think about it. IIRC that ""reason"" wasnt touted by PE or anyone else until people started noticing that ego frames seem to bend all the time. The frame getting tweaked slightly isnt going to make a difference when it comes to a rib breaking or not breaking. IF there is any safety benedit its just a happy coincidence.   The reality is that PE isnt going to come out and say that the aluminum used just isnt particularly strong. And why should it be? Its not a design flaw, the guns function just fine with that aluminum."

This is because the fields aren't big enough anymore. Back in the day, the fields were so large you could sneak people around and right through the field to the enemy base where the flag was.  Still, you can do single flag ctf. Flag in the middle and the team that gets it to the OTHER team's base wins.  Once you get bored of that, start making scenario games."

The defending team will then appoint 1-2 medics depending on size and 1 VIP (we usually have only ref know medics everyone knows VIP). The attackers will start outside of the town and push in. The attackers will have 2 lives to eliminate the VIP.   Variation: Medic can only heal non-headshots, this works well for more experienced groups, or if one group is better than the other.   SWAT Extraction: A group of 5 people must take on everyone else there (usually 10-15) and extract the VIP from the town. The SWAT team will start outside the town everyone else inside. The VIP may talk but must not shoot until the SWAT team reach him. If at any point after being grabbed the VIP is shot the game is done. Once the VIP is grabbed he may start shooting and assist in his escape back to the SWAT teams starting point. If he reaches there he wins. SWAT team 3 lives, defenders 2 lives."

With your tippy, point it down and simply grab a firm hold of the cocking lug sticking out the right. Then gently pull the trigger, while still holding that lug. When the trigger this the release point, you'll feel the lug move forward a bit. Now just gently ease the lug forward until it stops moving forward. Bingo, no longer cocked  You can easy try it at home empty, un gassed. It's exactly the same  With my cockers, same idea but one just grabs the cocking rod and eases that forward"

paintball,3b5rb9,StopEating5KCalories,1 point,Fri Jun 26 13:49:20 2015 UTC,"Depends on the paint really. High-quality paint feels like a stiff poke when you get hit, field-grade paint can break skin.

I have learned over the years that despite the illusion that youre cooler in a t shirt and jeans, this is not the case. Your skin will feel the moving air more readily, indicating that youre cool, this is a trick. Your internal temp is what counts. There have been quite a few tests with motorcyclists with this. Its pretty well proven that people who are totally covered on a long ride, compared to those with exposed skin, are less dehydrated and have a lower internal temp. If youre just in the woods with no sun, its not really a big deal."

paintball,3b4y1g,ThePapaFlores,3,Fri Jun 26 00:27:02 2015 UTC,"Honestly, for a loader, whichever one you can find for cheapest is good.  Unless you're playing actual tourney ball.  the tank, I'd always advise you to buy new, just in case.  Marker, etek 3 for 260 is a little high, you can probably talk him down a bit.  Pod pack, anything cheapish, ebay is usually good.  There are usually decently sized pod packs for 30 bucks there.  Also, I'm in Wisconsin as well, but i go to a place by waupaca, Milwaukee is a bit a drive for me."
paintball,3b4y1g,StopEating5KCalories,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:32:04 2015 UTC,Yeah really only into open play airball for now.  What would you say is a decent price for a used etek 3? I was hoping to get it closer to $200-$220.   And vertical or sideways pod packs? (I'm always afraid my pods will fall out on the vertical ones [it has happened to me before])
paintball,3b4y1g,StopEating5KCalories,2,Fri Jun 26 00:38:11 2015 UTC,"Vertical packs, they hold real well, don't worry.  Etek 3's I'd say 220ish is good.  I wouldn't pay more."

paintball,3b4y1g,IAmTheFatman666,2,Fri Jun 26 17:47:42 2015 UTC,"Tank- anything as long as it has a ninja regulator and the tank is in hydro. the weight difference between an ultralite reg and normal adjustable reg is negligible and you wont feel the difference  Loader- you cant go wrong with any of these loaders, the spire is a personal favorite as virtue has arguably the best customer service in the industry. The rotor you might have to worry about if you shoot recreational grade paint as they are known to jam on non-tournament grade paint.  Marker- 260 is fairly high for a used etek 3. The Etek 5 has the same valve design as the LV1 a $1300 marker and is a bargain for the price. I'd also recommend looking into the new Macdev Drone 2 its in the same price bracket as the Etek 5 but isnt a stacked tube poppet like the etek"
paintball,3b4y1g,Kabosui,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:00:10 2015 UTC,"The Etek 5 has the same valve design as the LV1   That's not true. The LV stands for Lever Valve, which the Etek 5 does not have."

paintball,3b4y1g,IAmTheFatman666,2,Fri Jun 26 02:14:34 2015 UTC,"Mask: Great choice!    Tank:  Your call on new vs used. As for the reg, if I understand correctly, the UL is just lighter. Barely any difference.     Loader:  I prefer a Pinokio, but out of the Big 3, Spire. Yes, the Rotor is a bit heavy and does spin when it's out of paint, and yes, it can not only get annoying, but trust me, you can hear it if someone else has it happen, and if it's you, you can get bunkered.    Marker:  I have both an Etek 3 and an Etek 5. The 3 is great, but it's not worth $260. $200 sure. Etek 5 is amazing. Smooth, quiet (ish. Etek's are loud) Plus it looks awesome.      Misc.: Try on a pack if you can, but if not, the GI Race pack and the DYE attack pack are some fantastic packs. Bit pricey, but well worth it."

paintball,3b4y1g,cptzanzibar,2,Fri Jun 26 02:12:22 2015 UTC,"I'd also suggest looking into the JT Impulse, 100 dollars cheaper than the etek 5 and comes with the oled. It was a high end (at about $1000) but since its JT no one bought it so they reduced it. I adore mine though, awesome marker. Lasted 1600 shots on a 68/4500 tank last time i played too."
paintball,3b4y1g,i_like_turtles3,2,Fri Jun 26 05:03:52 2015 UTC,"Hey man.  Great call on getting a good mask and then getting a gun later.  Tank: I would say go with the adjustable.  That way your fill nipple is never placed awkwardly and you can fill easy  Loader: I own a rotor and love it.  It does spin when it's empty because it's uses eyes (laser beam) to know if a ball is ready to be fed.  If nothing is there it spins to feed.  My team is sponsored by virtue so we get Spires and they are excellent as well.  I think overall the spire is the best bet because you get a speedfeed.  The rotor has faster feed rate but you have to buy a speedfeed separate.  Marker: This really depends on how serious you plan to get, how much money you are willing to spend, and what type of paintball you're playing.  It sounds like you don't want to spend more than $500 in which case I would say try to find a geo 3.0 or 3.1  Don't get an Axe.  PE makes amazing markers.  If you like the etek, you will love an LV1.  Whatever marker you do decide, a barrel kit like a freak is a great investment to shoot accurately.  Misc: HK, NXE, and GI make good packs.  Elbow pads (planet eclipse) are awesome for bounces and if you're sliding / crawling around.  Also make sure you get a good barrel swab.  Paintball pants are also a great buy for crawling around, sliding, etc."

paintball,3b59am,dasjaco,1 point,Fri Jun 26 05:33:46 2015 UTC,Vforce Grillz or Profiler are always great.  I currently user a vio extend because of sponsorship but I love the mask.  I have gotten a lot of bounces off of the mask and ears.  Also easy to clean and breathable.

paintball,3b3gk9,SlidePanda,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:38:19 2015 UTC,Alright cool. Just making sure because I would feel awful taking a buddy out to play and then having a tank fail on them
paintball,3b3gk9,ScoobehDoo,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:45:02 2015 UTC,Understandable. But tanks are more robust than we give them credit for. Their construction tolerances are spec'd to way higher pressures than they see during normal use. So it takes a lot of abuse to cause a failure
paintball,3b3gk9,ScoobehDoo,1 point,Fri Jun 26 11:51:45 2015 UTC,Looks good as long as the tank hasn't expired. I'm also from Illinois. Where do you play at?

paintball,3b0vgo,Stilgar_42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:38:01 2015 UTC,"I tested it on 12 grams and the efficiency is horrible. I don't want to devolumize the valve or the air line because I intend to swap bodies when I want to run it as a standard Automag. That leaves CO2 & HPA tanks. I have a 3.5oz, a 4oz., and a 13/3000 tank I plan on using with it. I actually removed the level 10 kit for exactly the reason you're thinking of. The level 10 is great for preventing chopping but it's not the most air efficient system."
paintball,3b0vgo,DarwinZDF42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"The 3.5oz tank nets me about 200-250 shots depending on heat and velocity.  this is on a standard lvl 7 valve and using 12"" barrel with a bore that is probably just on the loose side of matched.    Actually, I just picked up an RTR phantom to cocker adapter so I can use a phantom barrel on my Mag!  Still expect to get roughly 200 shots off the 3.5oz with that set up."
paintball,3b0vgo,DarwinZDF42,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:39:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah. The 3.5oz. tank is going to be my first choice unless the field I'm playing at doesn't offer CO2 fills. At most, I'll have 170 shots on me when I'm using my leg harness and Gauntlet (100 in the harness, 60 in the Gauntlet, and 10 in the gun. So I'd run out of paint before I run out of air."
paintball,3b0vgo,DarwinZDF42,2,Thu Jun 25 11:57:07 2015 UTC,"If you can find one, an 8ci/3k is about the same size as a 3.5oz, though fewer shots. I get about 100 shots out of mine, but it's great if you play at places without CO2 fills. (Most local places have converted their rentals over to 72ci or 48ci 3k's, so CO2 isn't an option.)"

paintball,3b1vzd,xluminosityx,2,Thu Jun 25 11:22:34 2015 UTC,Yeah seriously..when I went paintballing for the first time someone lent me a crappy mask. In the middle of a gun fight the mask slipped down (broken strap) and the dude popped me in the forehead. Make sure your mask is good!
paintball,3b1vzd,SlidePanda,2,Thu Jun 25 19:16:10 2015 UTC,"Communication is key - talk to your teammates.  Tell them where the opponents are at all times.  Keep your gun up at all times.  It should never be pointing at the ground during a game because it causes you more time to draw back up if you catch someone moving.  Always keep your mask on until the game is over AND everyone has put there barrel covers back on.  The wider you can get, the better.  You want to flank the opponent and wedge them into the middle so they can't move.  Paintball is a game of angles.  The wider and closer you get, the easier it for you to shoot them.  The key is to have teammates doing the same on the opposite side as you.  Lastly, have fun with it.  It's not that serious so get crazy and do some wild moves.  You will either be a hero or have a great story to tell."
paintball,3b1vzd,xluminosityx,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:15:10 2015 UTC,So it's better to be around the edge of the 'map'?
paintball,3b1vzd,SlidePanda,2,Thu Jun 25 13:29:37 2015 UTC,"Generally yeah. if you're on the edge of the field, you know that, that direction is 'safe' IE you won't have a sudden unexpected barrage of paint from that side.   Being in the middle, now you've got to contend with folks possibly on the attack from your left and right"
paintball,3b1vzd,stressedoutatumc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:33:02 2015 UTC,Yes because you know that no one can be behind or from the side that you're on the edge of.  Paintball kills rarely come from shooting straight at each other.  They happen when one player gets an angle on the other because the player in the middle / player who did not move is now exposed without realizing it or has no way to get tighter in there bunker without getting shot.
paintball,3b1vzd,mrkleen340,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:46:56 2015 UTC,"Communication is key   Yep - a team that talks - or at least has a few leaders willing to let others know what's going on, where the opposition is, will beat a ""team"" of individuals much more often than not.  When I was playing regularly, there were some other guys who were also regs and so we played together a lot, refs knew us etc.   For ahem fun, sometimes the refs would lump 2-3x the number of noobs/renters vs our little gaggle during walk up play.   Despite the numeric imbalances, and a couple pump guns, we played as a team, communicating and coordinating, and often would win or play to a tight loss"
paintball,3b1vzd,airman93,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:44:42 2015 UTC,"On the subject of paint, if your field is cool with being your own paint, do it.  I'd second or third the notion that was Walmart paint sucks the big one, but if you have time to order or drive to get more and the field sells the same stuff, you gotta do what you gotta do. Have your co workers do the same so everyone can play more than a game or two.  I think that's crazy that you only get 200 rounds...most give you at least 500.  On the subject of play, if you plan to be out there for most of the day, bring water and food.  Water is obvious, but you will be burning a lot of calories.  I usually pack 2 gallons and a couple of sandwiches.   On the subject of clothing, don't worry about getting hit.  It doesn't hurt at all.  Unless you are taking 10 shots at point blank...which you won't with co workers, you will hardly feel the hit and be more mad that you got hit than feel pain of the hit.  So, leave the heavy clothes at home, including a hoody.  Just wear something can can breathe.  A lot of players will just wear cut offs and pants/shorts.  Shoes are important...soccer cleats are popular.  I personally like trail shoes with heavy tread.  In the subject of playing, stay to the edges and move bunker to bunker.  Always ask yourself ""what's stopping me from moving?""  If the answer is ""nothing"" move.  If the answer is another player, put him into his bunker, then move when he loses sight of you.  The worst thing you can do is trade paint at range with no one moving.  Good luck and have fun!!!"

It creates downward pressure on local prices which help newer folk or less fortunate folk a chance to get gear.  If price was a barrier for entry a local shop with  30%-50% markup is not doing anyone favors.  Plus large outlets do better for the industry than small shop simply because they purchase large quantitys of gear regularly.    If ANS asked any vendor for something, be it a notice of defect, special item request, early access, anything like that.  ANS would have more pull and there be the better store.  Its like Walmart.  Everyone hates them but you cant deny the low price, convience, or overall market effect it has.  Look at black friday and sales events that happen only in big box stores.    Im all fore small shops.  My family has had a hardware store since the 40's and has had to deal with large outlet store taking away business, but on the flip side we are all consumers, and anything that lower barriers of entry for more players is better for the overall health of the sport."

paintball,3azrpk,currentlyonthepooper,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:44:56 2015 UTC,"I'm on old player looking to get back into the sport. I am looking into getting a kp3, does it matter what compressed air tank I get for it?"
paintball,3azrpk,currentlyonthepooper,2,Wed Jun 24 22:00:22 2015 UTC,"Well, first off, the KP3 can run compressed air or CO2, CA being superior because it is more consistent and doesn't freeze your gun up. From there, basically most tanks are equal in terms of performance but you'll want to consider volume, pressure and weight. You'll get more shots out of a 68 cubic inch tank than a 48, but you probably wont shoot enough with this pump to really need the capacity. 4500 psi max tanks store more air and therefore shots but are more expensive. The tanks can be either aluminum or carbon fiber, I think, and that effects the weight and price. My aluminum tank is less expensive but also heavier than a carbon fiber equivalent.  Since we're talking about air for a pump, I'd say go for the lightweight, lower capacity option that best fits your budget. I have an empire 48ci 3000 psi tank I just got because it was cheap, takes as much air pressure as my local field's compressor can provide (no need for 4500), and I don't mind the lower capacity or weight"
paintball,3azrpk,valve_bender,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:09:44 2015 UTC,"Hey man, just wanted to say I really appreciate the information you just gave me! It's been a really long time since I've been into paintballing so some stuff is pretty hazy. I'm thinking of just getting an aluminum compressed air tank for now, then eventually get carbon fiber. Should I be worried using a gravity fed hopper at all?"
paintball,3azrpk,currentlyonthepooper,2,Wed Jun 24 23:40:44 2015 UTC,"With a pump, a force-fed hopper isn't really necessary, because usually when you pump it, you're going to move the gun around, agitating the paintballs in the hopper. People generally recommend the sportshot hopper, or you can find yourself a cheap 50rd hopper to keep it lighter and smaller. The APP 50rd hopper isn't the best, but it's pretty readily available."

paintball,3b0w5g,Pyr0Paladin,10,Thu Jun 25 01:59:28 2015 UTC,"That is a Gen-E Matrix. Can't tell from the picture, but it looks possibly blind. Has a Tadao 5.0 board in there (that is good). Aardvark Trinity LPR and CP HPR. Let me know what color the bolt kit is and I can tell you more. Just basing off what I'm seeing here I'd estimate market value at $125.  Source: I am the god of all things Matrix."
paintball,3b0w5g,BonesJackson,4,Thu Jun 25 07:11:21 2015 UTC,"This guy is 100% right... I shot these things for years back in the day.  I still own my NYX Matrix to this day.   Regarding the eyes... It is my understanding that if you can remove the breach (unscrew the back, pull out the long rod that goes through the gun, pull forward/up on breach) it does not have eyes...?  Maybe Bones can address that... I know I sent my NYX into The Matrix Center (sidebar: is that still a thing?) back in the day to get the eyes installed, and since then the breach has been locked in.   The guns are really fantastic and will work with very little maintenance.  You can set the bolt pressure super lower and you shouldn't chop paint even without eyes.  I would get this thing up and running if you can and play with it from time to time.  It's a heavy gun to play with, but.... ""heavy is good, heavy is reliable, if it doesnt work you can always hit him with it"" - Boris the Blade"
paintball,3b0w5g,dxspip,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:58:14 2015 UTC,"NYXes are some of my favorites. I have ... 3 of them right now including serial# NYX003. The NYX actually was the first Matrix with eyes, and they were externally routed through the Dead Air Chamber (DAC, left side tube) and into a specially sliced up breech. If you wanted to take the breech off you needed to unplug the eyes from the DAC first.  External wires like that are silly and bulky, so Duane Parsons, machinist of the Ironmen guns looked at it and said, ""this is a silly design. I can make something better"" and created a two piece U-shaped  metal fitting that fit between the body and breech. A chunk of the breech had to be milled away to accommodate this but that wasn't a big deal. His design was used specifically on the 120 or so Ironmen guns.  ""Toxic Dave"" at Gen-E, the guy behind the Toxic Matrix, saw this and went, ""whoa we should put this on every gun"". However the Ironmen had some specific milling done to them to prevent this, so a slight redesign of this eye carrier that fit ALL matrix bodies was worked out. Gen-E offered conversion services to people who wanted to get internal eyes.  TMC, partnering with Will Roberson of former Tadao (RIP), offered a nearly identical thing as well. They, however, wanted to leave their special mark on it so their package included a custom reshaped tapered breech and different eye diodes that Will sourced. He didn't feel the ones Gen-E used were up to snuff because they could potentially be impacted by sunlight. The complete TMC package included the TMC breech, TMC eyes, and the Tadao 1.1 board, also known as the Trauma Eye Board because of the relationship with team Baltimore Trauma.  Regarding breech removal itself, all breeches are removable on these guns. Yours may be stuck with old gooey paint, but they didn't ""lock in""*.  *exception being the original 120 Ironmen guns which had special breeches and breech rods that actually did lock the thing in."
paintball,3b0w5g,BonesJackson,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:15:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for that write up, you obviously know your stuff...  But, my breech hasn't been removable since I got it back.  I have the spliced breach exactly like you say but I can't ever remember it being removable since I got it back from TMC ~10 years ago... As well, mine came with an Eggi board, so maybe something changed in their process?   I haven't gassed mine up in ages, I should check the serial number on it but the screw holding my CP Snatch grip (haha remember those?!) is stripped, and I haven't gotten a dremel yet.  What colour NYXs do you have?  I have the Blue Black Tri-Fade"
paintball,3b0w5g,dxspip,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:23:35 2015 UTC,"Blah, my internet has been acting weird for the last few days and I didn't see this response. First, I promise your breech is removable. it might be stuck with some gunk or something but it's removable. It has to be.  Yours came originally with an Egi board, but TMC likely replaced that with the Trauma Eye Board (Tadao 1.1). Open up the 3 grip screws on the left and take a look at it; I'm pretty sure it will say Tadao.  I have a Tri-Fade, a silver one, and a raw, unanoed body leftover from the machinist. I have, in the past, owned 'battleship' gray, red/black fades, black, and blue ones.  I like the 1st gen 2 Liter on yours. Those are hard to come by these days. Whatever you do hang onto that."
paintball,3b0w5g,BonesJackson,3,Mon Jun 29 22:25:59 2015 UTC,"I don't believe that it's a DYE matrix as others have been saying. While it is a matrix, I think it's actually a Gen-E whom DYE bought the matrix design from. I could be wrong however, as it's flat black and I think most Gen-E's were gloss. Did DYE make them for a short while without eyes? My first ever high-end gun back in 2003 was a Gen-E matrix. Absolute pig on air, an 88/4500 was around 7 pods. There were a slew of aftermarket companies making upgrades for these including complete drop-in bolts for better efficiency. This one looks to have an aftermarket clamping neck, older DYE boomstick, Aardvark LPR and CP reg. If it is a gen-E, someone added later grips (window) and board (LED not dip switches)."
paintball,3b0w5g,Human-Remains,2,Thu Jun 25 06:29:19 2015 UTC,"Here's a pic of a DYE build matrix. You can see the breach has been milled for eyes, as well as the more extensive ""swoop"" milling on the side. The DYE also had the teardrop milled into the frame above the trigger that Gen-E guns did not. Imgur"
paintball,3b0w5g,Human-Remains,2,Thu Jun 25 06:31:43 2015 UTC,"Dye Matrix, sometimes called the DM3. CP reg, and an aftermarket LPR at the front I think, but I don't know what it is. Looks kind of like an ANS, but kind of not. I can't say for certain that it is or isn't.  Looks like a Dye Boomstick barrel with stainless back. Those are nice.   If you unscrew the screw at the back, you can remove the breech and expose the bolt. If it's aftermarket, that seems to increase the value. I think black is stock and any other color is aftermarket.  If the internals are mostly stock, you're probably looking at $80-$100, but if it has a desirable aftermarket bolt, or the barrel is particularly sought after, maybe closer to $120-$140? I'm not up on the market for older electros, but one of these passed through my hands a few years ago, so based on that experience, those are my estimates, assuming everything works.   If anyone has more experience than me (which should be...a lot of people), please check my math and correct as needed."
paintball,3b0w5g,DarwinZDF42,3,Thu Jun 25 02:33:29 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not a Dye model. The funny thing about your guess on the LPR is that while ANS did not make a Matrix LPR, the Aardvark Trinity is pretty much exactly based on the ANS Jackhammer. Early models were just milled Jackhammers."

I think AKA made some of those as well. they aren't worth that much like 150 or something. unless it was a real matrix from aardvark it's not going to cost a lot.   edit: Interesting - In late 2003, Mike Lukas sold the patent for the Matrix to Dye, who quickly issued cease and desist letters to all aftermarket bolt manufacturers they felt infringed on their new patent. Dye also lightened the body a little, and changed the HPR and LPR to their own brands.  Edit: Jeeze people relax....  it's a Matrix of some sort. No need to get all crazy...

My only complaint was the trigger. It didn't have enough movement in my opinion. I like triggers that have a fair amount of pull to them and even after adjusting it didn't feel good for me so I bought a new trigger which is the one you see in the picture.
paintball,3ayzgx,valve_bender,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:09:51 2015 UTC,"I felt the same way about the trigger, I like the trigger on my guns to be tripped as soon as it starts moving, and with the stock set screw for the microswitch, it sat too far back and did not have very much movement. I went to the hardware store and picked up a set screw 1/8"" longer than the original, put on some loctite, and bam, the trigger sat all the way forward, tripped the microswitch immediately, and has a LOT of post-travel. Just the way I like it."
paintball,3ayzgx,valve_bender,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:20:34 2015 UTC,I didn't even think about just replacing the screw. That would have been a good idea.

paintball,3azo78,iNomaD0,12,Wed Jun 24 20:08:47 2015 UTC,"Lay down the law.  You give a shit about every rule.  You don't let anyone slide with not covering their barrel.  You know that every gun is chronod correctly.  Learn to yell clearly.  Do the countdown right.  ""5 - 4 -3 . . . . . . GOGOGOGOGOGO"" (Don't count the last numbers out loud.  Yell ""Go"" over and over so nobody stands at home wondering if you actually started the game.)  If you're not getting hit you're not doing your job.  People pay you so you can enforce the rules and check people for paint.  Soooooo many people will just cheat if there aren't paint checks.  Cheating isn't fun for the other team, and they may not come back.  You know from your experience as a player when people are probably going to get hit.  Predict the game, get close to the people who are poking out too much or getting flanked.    Build or get a shield.  Screen is the ideal material.    Pick up trash when you're walking around.  Try to keep an eye out for thieves."

paintball,3azo78,dxspip,10,Thu Jun 25 21:03:22 2015 UTC,"Work on your Command Voice. Being loud and clear for more than just a word to two is a skill one can develop. Nothing more annoying than starting each game asking your team ""WTF did the ref say""   If you're dealing with first timers, avoid slang/jargon. Paintball's full of specific terms, and even more slang/jargon. Keep is simple and avoid slang.  Be there. Physically - be engaged, move as needed. Mentally - don't be dicking with your phone, note paying attention during a game you're reffing. *Acceptable phone dicking might be video of said game for someone playing.  Teach - again, if you're dealing with a lot of first-timers or folks who have played just few times (IE the rental gang) - Take some time to teach them. It can be as simple as a ""Hey, if you run fast on GO! to that bunker and look to the left corner you'll have tons of great shots"" You don't need to go in deep - just little bit of info can make a big positive impact on the feelings of overwhelmed noobs.  Bring a whistle."
paintball,3azo78,SlidePanda,6,Wed Jun 24 20:19:33 2015 UTC,"Don't just stand on the sidelines, get in the fray when needed for paint checks. I love playing at a field with an engaged ref and will want to return.  Also, be willing to yell at young kids for taking their masks off (or adults I suppose). Have to accept the fact that sometimes sounding like a dick is better than having someone get shot in the eye.  (basically just be willing to be the bad guy for the sake of other players if needed)."
paintball,3azo78,TardyTheTurtle_,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:45:53 2015 UTC,The mask thing is important.  It can result in trouble for you and your local field. Be firm but don't come off as a dick.

(basically just be willing to be the bad guy for the sake of other players if needed).    This is so wrong and it really needs to die. Yelling at people accomplishes the exact opposite of what you want. If you can't deal with people in a mature fashion when they are making a safety mistake, don't get into reffing.   You do NOT need to be a dick to people to run a safe game."

paintball,3azo78,dedtigers,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:58:31 2015 UTC,"There are plenty of times where it is not an ""active game"" and the ref does not need to be a dick or act in such a way as to give everyone the impression they are panicking and unable to handle the situation."
paintball,3azo78,crazyike,3,Thu Jun 25 05:11:11 2015 UTC,"I get what your saying, I guess I could have explained better. I meant it more as be firm and authoritative when needed (and people might think your being a dick for telling them what to do).

paintball,3azo78,MiniMagCO,2,Thu Jun 25 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"When I refed local tournament's I was told by the head ref that if you make a call stand behind that call no matter what. People are going to get mad especially if they think you made a bad call if you go reversing you decisions or giving warnings and not enforcing them no one will take you seriously.  And don't give away people pos, as in if your watching a player in the lay down that makes a move to the snake, if he's not getting shot at and no one seen it watch him but don't move to keep a close eye untell he starts taking fire. Some players will watch the refs to have a idea where the players are. Same goes for woods ball don't stand on top of the advancing players, stand off to the side or behind a tree or way back so the other team doesn't know exactly where people are at. And remember to always carry a towel, for cover from incoming to clean hits on masks where people can't see to get off the field,"

My father in law was on the other team, and the field was HUGE. With tons of woods, and you couldn't see from one side to the other.   We blew the horn to start the game, and I lifted my gun up to aim in the direction of their camp and fired about 10 rounds at it and then headed down the hill towards the other team.   That night I asked Henry about his first game... he said the horn sounded, and he started moving forward and a paintball fell out of the sky and broke on his shoulder and he was out... He had taken TWO steps forward.   Haha! I've never topped that shot and it was over 10 years ago. lol!"

paintball,3awm1a,MyCatsNameIsCheese,2,Wed Jun 24 20:23:54 2015 UTC,The axe regulator pressure should be at 180 - 200.  110 is really really low and I don't know why your field would care about that....Their rentals are shooting at 800 PSI at least.

paintball,3awm1a,Booglysnot,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:35:38 2015 UTC,"If you're gun is shooting with 110 psi of pressure it causes everything to not work as well.  Just turn up the pressure on the ASA on the bottom of your gun, and then turn down the velocity it shoots on the back of your bolt thing.  I would put money on the fact that this is your problem."
paintball,3awm1a,TrailsOfDoom,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:39:52 2015 UTC,"your Operating pressure is too low and youre likely causing things to work weirdly inside the gun.  That may not be the cause of your issue as I think it's because youre only shooting 275, but you may be imparting some weird spin on the ball as a result of the low pressure.  Turn down the back cap and turn up in the internal pressure.  IF you have aftermarket internals (delrin bolt, modified springs, modified poppet) you should follow their tuning instructions.  If you're running stock internals, fix the internal pressure as per other comments."
paintball,3awm1a,xluminosityx,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:18:00 2015 UTC,"275 is really low.  You should go to 285.  Even if it goes a little over, anything under 300 is honestly acceptable.  This doesn't really affect accuracy though.  You can also can't compare one markers accuracy to another unless they are the same.  It's like comparing two red cars.  What barrel is on it?  Is the barrel sized properly for the paint you're shooting?  Have you shot someone else's Axe and if so do they have the same upgrades to them?"

paintball,3awm1a,FukinGruven,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:41:39 2015 UTC,"LOL at all the misinformation in here. If your gun is chrono'd at 275, your shots will have the exact same range and shot trajectory as any other gun shooting at 275. And no, 10 fps will not make any significant difference. This has all been studied in detail... not to mention it is common sense for anyone with even a basic understanding of physics.  Also... Spools do NOT shoot flatter than poppets. Any perceived difference is essentially an optical illusion due to the angle at which you view the paintball leaving the barrel and travelling downfield, amongst other minor factors (such as grip angle, which can also affect the visual relationship of your eye to the barrel/gun).

paintball,3awm1a,TrailsOfDoom,-7,Sat Jun 27 14:47:48 2015 UTC,"Get an apex 2, put it at 2 clicks. That is enough backspin to really reduce shot drop, while low enough that it won't slow down the paintball enough to cause the balls to hit each other when firing fast. And it won't fly funky with just a little backspin added.  backspin makes a huge difference in drop off. Rifled barrels also help to a degree as well, because they impart some spin to the ball and it will fly straighter longer as it doesn't have the same wind resistance as a ball not spinning. But, they are way more susceptible to issues as they have ridges that can break paint, or cause accuracy issues if you are using bad paint.   Spinning paint even at lower speeds will fly flat so much further than non spinning paint."

You might get an extra foot, but everything you posted is complete fantasy. Rifled barrels will only work with first strike rounds."
paintball,3awm1a,FukinGruven,0,Thu Jun 25 00:40:11 2015 UTC,"I've been using backspin for years, and I have tons of high end barrel as well, and I've tested them all... They make a huge difference when you want a ""flat"" trajectory. That isn't my opinion it is science... See ""magnus effect"". And the more consistent the spin, the flatter it will fly. As putting the same spin ball to ball is a huge deal. Which is why I created the MonsterSpin system, as I wanted to control the spin much better than the apex or flatline could do on their own... By combining both systems, you can dial it is much better and get more consistent spin.   And I've done so much testing over the years that I know what I'm talking about. You can downvote all you want, but I can hit you in the woods in heavy cover, and you can't hit me back unless you have a backspin system. So say what you want about it ""being fantasy"" but with over 2,500,000 views, showing what my barrel system can do... It isn't fantasy... I film every game I play, and you can see for yourself what it does, and since I film at 15X optical zoom, you can actually see the flight path of the paint. WAY out there, in distances other players can't see with their eyes. Most players film with no zoom, or do digital zoom on their action cam, which is like 3x zoom... So you can't see the distances I am shooting with those cameras.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LlNdA_xsZyU  I have tons of video showing flat shots with my backspin MonsterSpin barrel system. Trust me, if you saw it in real life you would be shocked at how flat it shoots and how far it shoots flat.   Here are a few videos... I've been using it for years. At Living Legends this year people were shocked at how far I could shoot it, flat... They had never seen anything like it.   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wJZfHn5w-c  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHOPE5C383Y  Here is living legends this year using the MonsterSpin, ff to 4:00 in to see it in action. I was shooting at 275fps that day. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ifoL2nmfqZs  No one else is testing paintball accuracy at 160 feet away, and I've been doing stuff like this for years... Here is the new TCR, with a 16 inch J&J ceramic, using regular paint and FSR, vs my A-5 with MonsterSpin, and the TCR with Lapco Big Shot .687 with Apex 2 tip. It shows the trajectories of all those systems and the backspin shoots the flattest by far. So actually if you want to get rid of the hook of paintball the backspin is the only way. (because of the magnus effect, science Bro!).   https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rINGp01viIk"
paintball,3awm1a,TrailsOfDoom,0,Thu Jun 25 11:50:52 2015 UTC,"This is positively delusional. In order for the Magnus effect to actually produce the results you want, the ball needs to be spinning in the neighborhood of 32 thousand rotations per minute. Anything lower, and you are actually decreasing the range of your paintballs. You may think they are flying flatter, maybe they are, but they will drop to the ground far sooner than an un-spun paintball.   Further, if you actually are spinning the ball that fast with your retardedly named monster spin system, the trajectory of the ball will no longer be flat. It's an arch out to about 160ft before it dips, rises, and falls again. It's a veritable roller coaster ride. If you think that's an accurate shot, or just a fun one to take, good on you. You sure as shit aren't shooting laser beam paintballs because of a flatline and and apex.   Science, bro!"

paintball,3awkop,Bircher,3,Wed Jun 24 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"Hello! A regulator in regards to paintball markers and tanks is a device that 'regulates' the air pressure coming from one vessel to another. For example, your empire tank (comes with a pressure gauge) can be filled up to 3000psi. There is a regulator on your tank that will then 'regulate' that 3000psi air to something around 850psi. Now that 850psi burst of air will be regulated again by the reg your marker has (if it has no reg, the regulatory processes ends) to whatever pressure your marker is designed to operate as. I hope I made myself clear as I'm not an expert on these sorts of mechanics.   If I made a mistake or have misunderstood something someone please let me know! :)"

paintball,3awkop,bjchu92,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:09:25 2015 UTC,Is the reg the same thing as that little pressure gauge that says the amount of air in the tank?
paintball,3awkop,SlidePanda,1 point,Wed Jun 24 09:54:40 2015 UTC,"No. A regulator is a regulator, a pressure gauge is a pressure gauge.  A pressure gauge simply tells one the difference between two pressures. In this case ambient air pressure ~1 bar and the pressure inside the tank  For the most part, gas regulators in paintball are pistons on springs and a method to block the inlet. A common set up is - high(er) pressure air comes into a chamber with that piston. Once the pressure in that chamber is high enough it starts to move that piston and compress the spring.   The more the spring needs to be compressed (before blocking the high pressure inlet), the higher the air pressure in that chamber needs to be. Once the spring is compressed to a certain point, the inflow of high pressure air will be blocked.  I say certain above as, many regulators that point is adjustable - and how one tunes the outlet pressure (pressure post regulation).  There are other sorts of gas regulators - like rotary. Commonly seen on gas lines to houses, propane tanks for grilling and welding rigs."
paintball,3awkop,Quakerz1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:07:14 2015 UTC,"Just a little extra. All paintball tanks have a regulator with a pressure gauge (except CO2 tanks, since they don't have regulators)."

The outlet pressure of a CO2 bottle depends a lot on factors like ambient air temp, how rapidly you're consuming the gas etc.  Only a small portion of the CO2 in a bottle is gas, the bulk of it is liquid."

Also, in Canada and some states, paintball markers are considered unregistered weapons for purposes of transportation and use with crimes (so they could consider it armed robbery if you robbed a store with one). It needs to be as disassembled as is reasonable so that it is less likely to be usable as a weapon.  The tank situation is exactly what someone else mentioned already. Regulator needs to be removed from the tank to bring it with you. Shipping it separate by GROUND (express air shipping, or international shipping have the same restrictions, needing to separate the reg from the tank, as if you were bringing it with you on a flight), or just renting a tank at the field or borrowing one from your buddy... Those are your easiest options."

If the Ion is working and holds air, it's worth $55-100 depending on what upgrades it has. If it's not working and depending on what's wrong with it, I wouldn't pay above $55 for it by itself.

paintball,3auuxq,krazymunky,5,Tue Jun 23 18:16:26 2015 UTC,Carrying two markers around sounds like unnecessary bulk to me
paintball,3auuxq,socks86,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:45:00 2015 UTC,Part of the Beauty of the phantom is how small and light it is. Becuase of this it is possible to remain fast and get into spots you normally wouldn't fit. Carrying a pistol and additional mags would only add un needed size and weight.  If you really need to sling your phantom you might want to look for a way to do it from the rear frame screw some how.  I imagine that would probably be the best balance point to keep the phantom pointed in the right direction and keep the sling out of the way during normal operaion.

EDIT: now that I think about it, for poppets, there's the Axe and Etek 5. But if you got the money for a Cyborg or an LV1, get those instead since they're in a higher tier."
paintball,3atn8n,mazu747,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:01:18 2015 UTC,"I like the LV1 and have no real info on the Cyborg (only know people with the Clone). However if I'm dropping that kind of cash, I want to know all my options. That is, if there are other options.  EDIT: I didn't know the new etek had the same body as the LV1. So that is definitely an option, given the price. I could almost get that and a new shocker for the same as the cyborg."

paintball,3atn8n,mazu747,0,Tue Jun 23 16:01:16 2015 UTC,"I don't have much either other than I've rarely heard a complaint, and how incredibly efficient it is. Same with the LV1  The Etek5 is great as well, it behaves similar an Ego11, so like a standard (modern) poppet. Dropping extra cash on an LV1 is also worth it, they almost behave like a spool with the air efficiency of a poppet. Very quiet and low recoil (not as low as a spool per say, but pretty close). Can't go wrong with either, honesty"
paintball,3atn8n,MuscleP4nda,2,Tue Jun 23 13:22:14 2015 UTC,"The more I look at the Etek, a used LV1 may be more my style since I'd need to add the OLED board and and on/off ASA to the Etek. At that point, its used LV1 territory. Thank you. You didn't give me a new option but you strengthened the case for the LV1 :)"
paintball,3atn8n,bullitkatcher,2,Tue Jun 23 13:25:03 2015 UTC,"Get an LV1. They're absolutely worth it. I couldn't get over how well it shot for the longest time and now when I pick up an older ego, it feels and sounds like it's shooting way too hot."
paintball,3atn8n,jettagopshhh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:29:41 2015 UTC,"To be fair... You don't ""need"" the oled board, it doesn't change anything about the board itself, because the LED will still give you all the info you need. And the etek has an on/off asa, it's just not as nice as the lv1's.  That being said, the lv1 is the nicer one of the two and if you are deciding between a new etek5, or a used lv1: get the lv1."
paintball,3atn8n,xluminosityx,2,Tue Jun 23 13:45:07 2015 UTC,You don't need an OLED but boy is it ever convenient. I hate changing firing modes with blinking lights lol.

paintball,3atn8n,SiriusCybernetics,2,Tue Jun 23 13:56:33 2015 UTC,I highly recommend the LV1.  It's not loud and you don't have the LPR in the way.  Edit: To add to this it's basically the best of both worlds.  It's a poppet that shoots and sounds like a spoul with less maintenance.

However I've had a lot of inconsistent problems with it so I am hesitant on more BL guns. The other thing that I've learned with the Impulse is how much easier maintenance is and less pieces to go wrong. The inline poppet engine of the Vis I'm not sure gets me much over the spool on the Vis or the Insight in terms of simplicity. However please correct me if you feel different since I want opinions."

I then snapped out and hit him with my final ball (didn't use any of his).   :D  I've had an experience like this along the same vein before at one of my local fields. We had a few pump players split between both teams that included a ton of rentals and players with electro's. Just so happened that most of the pump players ran to one side of the field and basically met each other on their respective sides. Two remained at the end and were locked in this snap battle. One runs out of paint and the other lets one of us (standing out on the side watching) run paint to the dude that was out.  Good feels all around."

paintball,3arjy9,Kabar1191,3,Tue Jun 23 01:03:20 2015 UTC,I too have done this with other AC players. One game at the old Silver Lake field in Michigan there was 4 of us left and one guy on the other team called himself out after running out. The other guy had a cocker as well and I noticed he has not popped out in some time so I yell at him and ask if hes out and he said yes. I took two pods out of my pack and tossed them mid-field and me and the other guy pulled back so he could get them. Ended with  him and I left after he shot out my team mate. I got the last point and the game but it's just an unspoken bond.  Good times had by all.

paintball,3asiio,tuckertml,2,Tue Jun 23 03:55:16 2015 UTC,"Use Dow 33, pretty much any will do. Don't use Dow 55 as that swells orings and pretty much only Bob long markers use it. Swollen orings, especially on moving parts, can cause a lot of extra drag/wear and can make your marker perform funny/improperly."
paintball,3asiio,kavar13,0,Tue Jun 23 07:15:19 2015 UTC,Fyi dow 55 hardly swells orings. It's good if you don't have a perfect fit but most of the time you won't be able to tell the difference..meaning if it's all you have is better than nothing   That being said don't bother with the stuff unless your gun asks for it.
paintball,3asiio,hathegkla,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:17:33 2015 UTC,"It does swell orings. When you say ""hardly swells"", that little bit is the .2mm they're going for."

They will be in need of a thorough going through to even hope to get back to normal operation. And some things may be too far gone and need to be replaced.

I've had times where I brought it to the local repair shop, they told me to replace batteries so I did so, brought it home, and it still didn't work. I'd bring it back to the shop, give it to the guy and the first pull of the trigger it's working for him.  It'll work great for 3 or 4 days, then it'll hit problems every other day for a few days before fixing itself again. I need something reliable, but also a speedball gun. I know tipmann is reliable, but they don't have the selection I'm looking for. I really do like azodin, I've had multiple guns with them in the past, but this recent one is making me doubt whether or not to invest in another. In the end I think I will"

paintball,3aqluh,cptzanzibar,3,Mon Jun 22 19:05:45 2015 UTC,"Used Etek 5 prices are around $400.  LV1 around $750-800 and up depending on anno.  Ego 11's are nice and all but the Etek 5 feels better in the hands, at least in my opinion.    The Etek 5 is on par and better with the Ego 11 in terms of performance while the LV1 leaves both in the dust- it feels like it is shooting under chrono but 100 psi... both Etek 5 and Lv1 feel fantastic in the hands.  Also don't forget about Bob Long markers too.  He has some fantastic poppet markers that were better than anything PE could muster until the LV1 came out.  I do believe PE has better customer service though.    I am selling my Etek 5 currently for $400- I got a Shocker RSX and the Etek has just sat since."
paintball,3aqluh,r45vt,2,Mon Jun 22 19:13:17 2015 UTC,So you'd say 2k11 and Etek 5 are in the same boat?
paintball,3aqluh,r45vt,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:28:19 2015 UTC,"That is my opinion- the Etek 5 edges it shot quality and the front grip feels better than the Ego 11.  Obviously someone disagrees with my opinion on that.  I think the Ego 11 has a better trigger but you get used to the lightness of the trigger on the 5.    Ego 11 has OLED and all metal frame. A used Ego 11 is a fantastic gun, I just wouldn't touch one with the price they want for a new one."
paintball,3aqluh,Dasuchin,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:01:21 2015 UTC,"When I do upgrade it'll be to something mid end. Right now I have a Etek 3, which is my first electro, so I will use this for a while before moving up. But when I do move up I will be looking at mid such as Etek 5 (or 6?) and Ego 2k11."
paintball,3aqluh,r45vt,2,Mon Jun 22 20:19:47 2015 UTC,"By the time you're looking to upgrade, you can probably get an LV1 for close to that. They're already possible to get around $700 if you look hard enough."

paintball,3aqluh,PiratePantsFace,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:05:46 2015 UTC,"I can't speak to the Etek 5 because I've stepped away from the game for a little bit, but I'll assume it is still being produced with cheaper composite materials vs the Ego and LV1.  Ego 11's are great. Light frame, good build, great air efficiency. The biggest knock I had on the 11 was how loud it was. Poppet valve markers on the average will be louder than spools, but the Ego 11 has a particularly loud snap on each shot.  The LV1 is the marker I ended with before I took a break from the game. Can't say enough about the marker, it's amazing. Balanced, efficient, smooth, enjoyable sound signature. The in-line removing the need for classic macroline is great too. It has never gone down on me.  If you can afford the LV1, go for it. But even if you ended up with the 11 I don't think you'd be disappointed. Planet Eclipse makes great stuff."
paintball,3aqluh,PiratePantsFace,3,Mon Jun 22 19:04:59 2015 UTC,The LV1 (new ego) is less loud than the geo 3.5
paintball,3aqluh,forgotmyredditagain,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:09:15 2015 UTC,I played with an ego 11 the other day at the field.  I wasn't impressed.  I did not see any improvement compared to my ego 7 that I normally play with.
paintball,3aqluh,ejyazel,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:32:22 2015 UTC,"I have heard repeatedly that the LV1 feels like it is shooting under chrono.  Everyone that has ever held the marker and shot it has told me that they thought the gun was shooting 150 fps, when it was really shooting 280.  The gun is supposed to be phenomenal and heads and tails above all previous generations.  If money is not an issue, I would recommend that over the others."
paintball,3aqluh,cptzanzibar,0,Tue Jun 23 22:31:26 2015 UTC,the G6R beats the shit out of the Ego 11.  but if you can afford it the LV1 is the nicest poppet of all time.
paintball,3aqluh,cptzanzibar,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:29:17 2015 UTC,"You can find the Ego11 and LV1 for cheaper than you've stated.  The Etek 5's are mostly brand new so $550 might be right.  I think you can find an Ego11 for $550 easily.    I've only shot an LV1, its as smooth as a spool with all the benefits of the poppet.  I own an Ego11, its a great, very reliable marker, and the last of the ""true Ego's"".  Not sure why you like Poppets so much; if you're looking to possibly spend $1,000 on a marker (LV1 as you mentioned), you should really look at the new SP Shocker RSX, retailing new for $800 with a year warranty.  I have #40 off the line and it's been nothing short of flawless."
paintball,3aqluh,GoldyGoldy,3,Mon Jun 22 19:00:54 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you like Poppets so much   Reliability, efficiency, shot feel, look, ergonomics. Some of those are subjective, but if you like them better, that would be the reason."

paintball,3aqu04,tetsballer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:08:23 2015 UTC,I can say from experience that dm6's still shoot just as good as the new guns (with virtue board) they just weigh a little more. You can get them for around 150-$200. I wouldn't get a shocker because of all the FSDO problems they are know for.
paintball,3aqu04,bowesguitars,2,Mon Jun 22 21:01:58 2015 UTC,"I've got 3 shockers and after spending 20 minutes on how to properly set them up with the stock boards, nerve boards and Hater boards, none of them have FSDO or chopping issues.  All are SFT shockers.  Drop the Eigenbolt in there (40 bucks) and the Hater board (60 bucks) and you'll have a low pressure, zero kick and awesome marker that would hold its own with the modern guns.  An overwhelming majority of ""known issues"" with a lot of paintball guns are people not knowing what they're doing or people who don't bother to read a manual.   I've gotten spectacular deals on markers from people who tell me there's a small leak and after replacing a single oring, the gun shoots amazing."
paintball,3aqu04,cptzanzibar,2,Tue Jun 23 14:48:42 2015 UTC,"As much as I love Shockers, they certainly get FSDO and bolt stick. Ive had 3 as well. All had sprung Eigenbolts, 2 Mg, 1 Al. They all had aftermarket boards, APE and 7th Element. Im pretty good about setting up Shockers and they all had a bit of bolt stick and FSDO. A shot or two and the beginning of a game was enough to take care of it.   That said, DMs have bolt stick and FSDO as well. Ive owned a few of those too."
paintball,3aqu04,bowesguitars,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:28:39 2015 UTC,"Weiiiiiird.   I had the problem on my Shocker for a bit, but I just ended up adjusting the dwell  and lowering the pressure.   With the Hater board, i just dropped it in there with no adjustments and the gun just shoots amazingly.  Do you get the bolt stick during high rates of fire or just whenever?   Not trying to troubleshoot, just seeing if theres something i've missed that I should be on the lookout for.  I think with the prices that you can snag one for, they're great guns."
paintball,3aqu04,tetsballer,2,Tue Jun 23 15:58:58 2015 UTC,If I go a week without cleaning my dm6 the bolt sticks on the first 1-3 shots then it works itself free and is fine for the rest of the day. If I clean the dm6 there is never fsdo afterwards. The anti bolt stick (up dwell on first shot) setting on the virtue board helps though.
paintball,3aqu04,cptzanzibar,2,Tue Jun 23 16:03:35 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, theyre great despite some flaws. Theres so much info and resource on them now, any issue can be easily dealt with.  The bolt stick would only happen after it had sat for a while. Even 20 mins or so was enough to get them to stick again. But a shot or two at the start of a match would free everything up until you stopped playing for a while again.   Hardly a real issue for such a smooth shooter, realistically."
paintball,3aqu04,PiratePantsFace,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:17:21 2015 UTC,Everyone should be shooting about 20 balls before the game starts anyways.
paintball,3aqu04,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:37:25 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I always shoot a few before the match, and I shoot a Victory, so no bolt stick."

The Rail is fully featured, but the PM8 gives you that higher end feel over all.  In any case, neither marker will win over the other when in a game. That comes down to the skill of the player.

The integrated LPR stands out since it wasn't implemented in any other dye markers until the dm14. I'm convinced it was due to the pm8 cutting into DM sales which killed the line.

Ive lost count on the number of times i've had to take apart my hopper mid game due to shitty broken paint or whatnot. I would consider that a high pressure situation.  If a product can be used by both a retard and a person with common sense without it failing, then that product is superior to the competition's."
paintball,3aqhs6,lokii_,2,Tue Jun 23 16:54:23 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, needing to fully disassemble a rotor to clean it out, so it functions properly, is normal.  There should be no reason to disassemble a Z2 on field. Despite the nose cone issue, the Z2 is well known for its ability to feed any paint when its dirty as hell. Thats like its hallmark."
paintball,3aqhs6,cptzanzibar,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"Then they are doing something wrong if they are removing the nose cone and losing the spring. It has to be really fiddled with for it to come off, at all. The situations where you can lose that spring are very minimal and shouldn't happen during a game unless youre reaching in there and pulling more than you have to.  All you need to do with a z2 to dump shitty paint like you said is open the lid. It's a huge lid and because of it's design it came allow the maximum amount of dump.  The rotor has the smallest lid and also the shape doesn't allow for easy pour, which is why it's easier to take off the top half of it. Not needed with the z2, at all."

I prefer the rotor because of the ease of teardown on it and the fact that I finally had to replace the batteries after 6 months (probably 30 cases of paint).   I haven't had a jamming problem either and we've used super tiny under 679 paint.  The sharkfin was a great feature when i ran out of power on the field for the one game though.  :)  The Z2 that I swapped to when my Rotor ran out of power was also really easy to use though.   I used to use a Halo (when they originally came out over a decade ago) and this is pretty much the same thing with some updates and an easy field strip.    Feeds super fast, pretty durable and zero jams feeding either my Luxe or Shocker."

It was light, fed fine with a few jams due to awful paint and 100+ weather. Nose cone never flew off mine, but it happened to others on my team. Only thing I really hated was the shape of it, which is why I sold it and picked up a rotor. Rotor has yet to jam on me, but in the end it's really up personal preference. Neither system is perfect, but both are going to feed paint into your gun faster than you can shoot. I would advise seeing if you like how each one sits on your gun before purchasing anything."

paintball,3aqhs6,Allssie,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"Here's something to consider.  If you watch any pro games, there's a hellovalot more rotors being used than z2's.  Other than the Empire-sponsored teams, they are scarce.  In the other hand, teams not sponsored by dye rock the rotor.  This is, of course, just an observation.  Having said that, both loafers have issues, but run great when they are clean and re assembled properly.  Both feed adequately fast, though the rotor is faster (but way faster than needed).  Neither is what anyone would call a bad loader; they are definitely in the top tier of loaders, so you cannot make a bad choice.   I use a Spire, but before that came along, my rotor never let me down and saved my ass at my last event when I took a shot in the speed feed and was able to just switch with confidence."
paintball,3aqhs6,stressedoutatumc,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:08:58 2015 UTC,"Z2 is not great unless you just stand around shooting and never dive or run.

paintball,3aoctx,cptzanzibar,3,Mon Jun 22 13:13:49 2015 UTC,"What position do you play?  If you suck, use it to your advantage in your position.  I'm a back player.  I live behind my gun with 2 missions -- lay a lane on break, shoot +7 pods per point, stay alive the longest and communicate EVERYTHING.  This position is the 'QB' on the field -- relays info from the coach/captains.  If you're doing mid/support for your front men -- you shouldn't be in this position.  These people need to be your more experienced players.  They're usually the captains for each side.  So you're playing front?  Congrats!  You're the disposable pawns in the game.  Your job is to keep pushing forward, moving only straight unless you're jumping somebody -- in which case they will only be immediately next to you.  You should never see people beyond your immediate vicinity.  If you are then your team is kicking ass because they're still at their first bumps or you've eliminated a lot on your opposite side.  You should be the first on the field to the 50.  That is your goal.  You are supposed to get eliminated every point.  The further up you can get, the more helpful you are for the team.    So how can you suck in this position and still be useful?  That's kinda up for you.  Talk to your support guy or back man.  What do they need you to do this game?  Maybe you just need to get to 50 snake off the break?  Hahahah.  Everyone will want you to get to 50 snake on the break.  But seriously, if your team is watching the games, they might have an idea on what they need you to do for each point.  Maybe you need to go D1 and lay a lane on tape for the first half of the game?  Maybe the other team always goes 3 wide up the D and you're going to the A to wrap around on them?  You are the in-disposable guy.  Make the best of every point to the best you can for your team.  If you do that, then you're an asset -- no matter how bad you might actually suck."

paintball,3aoqhi,Bircher,7,Mon Jun 22 06:59:12 2015 UTC,"The thing with paintball is that it was not designed with milsim scenarios in mind.  Yes, it can be done, but airsoft was designed to be similar in feel and use as a real weapon system.  The pellets in airsoft fly farther, faster, and more accurate than our round paintballs.  It's just better for that purpose.  Paintball isn't/wasn't designed for this purpose, so paintball found a niche as a flashy, fast paced activity.  Sort of an adrenaline junkie thing.  Couple that with the fact that realistic looking paintball weapons being a bit difficult to design and be reliable, comfortable, efficient, etc., and it makes for a difficult time getting a good functioning design, and unwise investment for companies/individuals.  Paintball, from what I've seen, focuses more on speed and chaos of the game, and less on the role-playing aspect, although scenario games are still a thing.  Because of the roots of airsoft, it stirs some people up.  Because of the inherent danger of paintball markers, there are restrictions, no school zones and the like, but our markers are generally made to be more flashy and crazy looking anyways, and for the sake of reliability, efficiency, etc. they don't look anything like a real weapon.  In essence, we don't have as much as a problem because the idea behind the game was never to be realistic, and our markers look less scary.  So when people look at paintball from the outside, it looks more like a game and less like a war.  TL:DR - Airsoft was made to be realistic, Paintball was not.  Edit - markers not mrakers"
paintball,3aoqhi,Movietheaterguy,3,Mon Jun 22 09:45:40 2015 UTC,"Paintball was originally marketed as a more militaristic style game and milsim guns were present from nearly the beginning. National Survival Game, National Pursuit Game, etc with people running around the woods in full camouflage. WGP made a sniper that looked like a Thompson submachine gun and the first Tippmann autos were derrivative of the Sten. There was also the AGA 62 and Crosman 3357, both made to resemble revolvers . Then there were companies like Line SI riding off Colt's fame with the Bushmaster and AGD using the Automag name. The push for sporting nomcleture and appearances came in the 1990s but the wargame side has always been there as well, just not as pronounced as airsoft."
paintball,3aoqhi,Markuss69,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:09:59 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind marketing does not change design of the equipment.  The original paintball markers were made to mark trees, not shoot other people. Paintball was marketed that way only because airsoft did not catch on until the late 80's.  There was a market to be filled and they filled it.  Airsoft, from platform to projectile was designed with realism in mind, unlike paintball, which was adapted to be used in milsim scenarios.  Airsoft from guns, to pellets to function are made to be realistic, so it scares some people and attracts others interested in milsim."
paintball,3aoqhi,Movietheaterguy,2,Tue Jun 23 22:44:49 2015 UTC,"Back in the mid 90s i guess the community tacitly agreed to call markers ""markers"" to distance ourselves from the term ""gun"" which shined a bad light on what was a relatively harmless game (back then it was 80% pump anyway).  Some lawmakers around the world seek to regulate the game in one way or another, but as others pointed out, people realize it's a game and calm down.    Although the game has not essentially changed (we're still lobbing paint capsules at each other at some 300 feet per second and over half of players are teenagers still), i think all old timers can agree safety has drastically improved.

paintball,3aoqhi,SlidePanda,1 point,Mon Jun 22 13:42:03 2015 UTC,"U might be right, but I think the other part of it is that it's harder for the field officials to make sure they are crono right. Because most markers that shoot first strikes also shoot regular paintballs. The problem being that they both shoot at different velocities and when u switch back and forth the fps is way different. If you crono with a regular Paintball at 265fps and then go play with first strikes you could be shooting at 300+ fps..."

Wow - yeah if that's the case.. As an owner I'd probably not allow them to be used at my field.   Way to easy for someone to get checked out at the chrono range with  normal paint get their sticker (or whatever) and then switch up at the fields.  Granted anyone can crank up velocity pretty easily if you know your marker at all. But at least that usually takes a tool and is harder to put back if they get pulled by a ref for being hot - vs swapping to a normal ball mag to re-test.  Now I am ascribing a lot of malice and forethought here... But there are some folks who would do that.  Getting whacked with an over 300 'ball' is trouble.

Super hot...   And yeah the neck hits. I took a non-breaking, not hot, long-ball hit right to one of the big blood vessels that nearly knocked me out. The blood pressure disruption from the hit was enough to give me Bambi legs and a touch of tunnel vision for a moment - near enough to cause a face plant.   Hot or closer might have put me down"

There's no sniper role. All guns shoot the same speed and the same distance. (Except for FSR's and rifled barrels, but don't worry about that.)    If you're deadset on buying, you're looking at about $250 for a decent setup. Buy a mask first. No question. Best buy is a JT Proflex. It's about $70. Then buy a tank and a loader. Get a Ninja 49/3000 for about $50 and a Proto Primo for about $15. Then get a marker. We suggest the GoG eNMEy. Great marker, especially for the price, running about $130.

My thing with renting is low quality and damaged gear is unfun to play with, though it may be worth to try first. Also, with the sniper role, is it just disallowed/looked down upon, or how is it just nonexistent? Could it vary field to field? Cuz given the proper environment  (and equipment) sniping could prove to be a very viable position, so long as you check your rear and keep relatively mobile so as to avoid close contact w/ opponents. A 2-man team could rek imo, why don't people do this? Theoretically, a sniper and spotter/cover, heavy gunner, a couple close-quarter roles, and however many more short-mid range gunners to fill up empty slots would be a perfect team"

You're shooting the same weight and size projectile at the exact same velocity and due to the way a paintball gun works a super-long barrel is doing nothing for you. It's like trying to hit a quarter with a musket.  Also, if you try shoot from too far, you end up not breaking paint even on the rare occasion you DO hit."
paintball,3ao2h3,cptzanzibar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:22:28 2015 UTC,"""Camping"" as a ""Sniper"" isn't really a thing in paintball.  The closest thing to that is a nice magfed gun that shoots first strike and has all needed accessories, and being in a good environment for what you said. I found that most people that ""camp"" are new players that are nervous. If that's the case, play some more to loosen up, put yourself in new situations. When that adrenaline is pumping there's no worry in your mind about getting hit, as I'm sure you know from playing Airsoft. If what you have in mind is playing slow and shooting accurate shots, pump might also be for you, I don't even play pump so I'm not biased, but that's what I think. Since you come from Airsoft you might really like magfed guns. I don't play magfed so I'm not biased about that either. I recommend checking out Milsig markers, Tiberius Arms, and the Dye DAM. Good luck.   Edit: Yes, people play pump very differently. From my experience pump players usually do what I said above, but there are some fantastic aggressive pump players as well!"
paintball,3ao2h3,SlidePanda,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:42:24 2015 UTC,"shoots first strike    For the OP - First Strike is a special sport of paint... capsule(?) with tiny fins and does benefit from the rifling concept. But many field do not allow them as the shell is polystyrene and not gelatin.    If what you have in mind is playing slow and shooting accurate shots, pump might also be for you,   For me - it was quite the opposite. Having gone through the normal PB evolution (low cost blow back, nicer mechanical, upper tier electro, and now pump) just hanging out with a pump... you're missing out.  With a pump, you're carrying a lot less stuff. Less paint, lighter hoppers (I use a 50 round), no batteries and you can get away with a small tank. With the lighter load - shoot n scoot is a great way to play.   On the other hand, you don't have the ROF to really scare folks into just totally turtleing up in a bunker, obstacle etc.   But that's where teamwork comes in. Typical move was to get one or two faster guns to suppress the opposition while I'd run the edge and turn the corner on those folks and catch them in a cross fire or force a surrender depending on the fields rules"
paintball,3ao2h3,cptzanzibar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 12:28:39 2015 UTC,"The weight really depends on your set up as well. My pump is a full bodied 2k2 Prostock.

A 50 round hopper, full is going to be several ounce lighter. You've got AA batteries at almost 1 oz each, and every 10 balls add over an ounce. Plussing up to 200 (150 net) balls is over a pound more.   For me, the pumps lighter  - but it's also a heads up since all my stuff for several years is one flavor or cocker or another.  Also, don't forget the extra paint weight. Pump I usually roll with one big pod or 3 little ones. Basically ~150 balls. Much less mass to hork around on my back as well"

paintball,3ao2h3,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:44:05 2015 UTC,"Theres definitely less metal on the Orry than my prostock. The completely unscientific feel of it in my hands would support that as well. But yeah, I like the weight, not a bid deal to me at all."

paintball,3aney3,Bumblemore,6,Sun Jun 21 22:52:09 2015 UTC,"Since no one is giving you a real answer:  Dust is a matte surface anodization. Pic  A splash is self descriptive. Pic  Polish is anodization on a polished aluminum surface, making it shiny Pic  An acid wash anodization is anodizing using acid and bleach to create a ""wash"" effect on the aluminum. Sometimes a sponged effect is done. Note the washed out effect on the dye. Pic  A fade is just one color fading to the next. Pic  A 3D annodization combines dust and polished areas on the aluminum to create a 3D effect. Pic.   Aurora or Oil Slick is a special type of finish that I don't know much about.

paintball,3anqa1,novonn,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:47:54 2015 UTC,What I did was reduce the pressure in the HPR(foregrip) until the velocity was around 200. Then increased the pressure in the LPR (Torpedo thing under the barrel.) At first your velocity will increase but it will get to a point when it starts to go back down. Turn it to the point right before it starts to drop again. Then turn the hpr up until it reaches 280 fps or whatever you want to chrono at. Then screw with the dwell if you want.
paintball,3anqa1,cptzanzibar,1 point,Mon Jun 22 05:21:15 2015 UTC,Theres not much you can do with an Etek. There really is no LPR adjustment to be done. They come from the factory set up the way PE wants you to use it.

Most likely dirt in the tank from dirty fills or dirt on the fill nipple. Take apart the reg and check the reg seat and body for dirt, scratches, damage to the internals. Another possibility is a damaged reg seat which will cause reg creep leading to the blown 1.8k disc.  Second tank - leak is probably coming from the piston.

paintball,3ajkoe,Seaskimmer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 21:14:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the reply, I'll take a look tomorrow. Any way I can protect my gear from the fill station? Do they make filters or should I gas the fill line quickly before attaching? A few weekends in and I don't think I've gotten a full 4500 fill yet."
paintball,3ajkoe,Seaskimmer,4,Sat Jun 20 23:13:27 2015 UTC,"Not really, the dirt and oil is coming from the tanks/compressor and it's up to the field to keep that clean. There are filtered fill valves available though. I can't comment on the effectiveness of them though. Otherwise, just keep the cap on your fill valve when you play.   It sounds like their fill equipment is only capable of outputting 3k if you can't get a fill above 3k."
paintball,3ajkoe,ahabswhale,2,Sat Jun 20 23:39:38 2015 UTC,"On the old ones I suspect it's most likely your reg seats and o-rings just aged poorly, whether or not an o-ring makes it past 5 or so years is a gamble. You should strip them down completely and rebuild them with new quality o-rings (I wouldn't just default to buna in a tank regulator - for example that green ring that popped out of the Ninja reg is probably HNBR). /u/Ninjahavekk is usually around and will probably jump into this thread at some point to help you with your ninja regulator. Otherwise it's pretty easy to just call them."
paintball,3ajkoe,nathanjayy,2,Sun Jun 21 04:58:21 2015 UTC,"Get the Ninja reg brust disks replaced and follow any and all steps to gte it back to working condition. It looks like excess dirt may be entering your tank through the fill valve at your field. a good way to test this is to clean a reg and rebuild it, use it through out the day and then disassemble to find any impuritie coating the reg insides."
paintball,3ajkoe,Ninjahavekk,2,Mon Jun 22 06:19:43 2015 UTC,"Hey bud sorry for the issues you had there. With the older tanks you will want to use a silicone based lube to clean and lube those and inspect the piston and you should be good on those. For your Ninja reg, the reason the 1.8k blows is because there is some sort of damage to the nylon ball seat on the piston. If you just got that Ninja system shoot me an message with your info and the numbers off the reg near the fill nipple and I will get you out a rebuild kit for it which will replace the piston and the 1.8k that blew on there"
paintball,3ajkoe,Seaskimmer,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:14:00 2015 UTC,Any reason in particular for silicone based lube? I've been using dow33 in my regs with no problems and I'm pretty sure I read a manual somewhere that said dow33 was fine.
paintball,3ajkoe,Ninjahavekk,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:37:05 2015 UTC,"Primary reason is most other lube is petroleum based which is combustible similar to putting oil in your fill nipple which you never want to do. I recommend silicone based lube but always check with the lube manufacturer for the specific ingredients, if petroleum is used at all you do NOT want to use it."
paintball,3ajkoe,PiratePantsFace,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:02:39 2015 UTC,"Ignore the ninja reg:  The old regs probably just got dirty and were old, and the vaseline/grease inside of it went away, causing the reg to fail which meant the burst disc popped.  Add the ninja reg:  It looks like you are getting a lot of dirt into your fill nipple, OR that the pump at the shop does not have the appropriate filter on it, causing dirt to be forced into your tank.    Do you have a fill nipple cover?"

MacDev itself went through a bad period from about 5-2 years ago, where their guns weren't as good as their older guns.  They seem to be back.  Bob Long has always made good guns.  But to be honest, my ego 07 shoots smoother than the g6r.  I havent' tried the inline poppets or spool.  If you have the chance, ask people at the field to shoot some paint.  A lot of people who can afford a thousand dollar gun don't really blink an eye at a stranger shooting a pod's worth of paint.  Hell, I love seeing other people enjoy my babies."

paintball,3aj6mn,Domrckn,5,Sat Jun 20 18:37:01 2015 UTC,"Just do some snipping with scissors on the foam around your nose.  It'll probably fix it.   Profits aren't the best for breathability and tend to fog up from sweat and whatnot. Grills and E-Vents are both great goggles, but the foam on Empire's E-Flex and E-Vent are my personal favourite.    I run E-Flex.  It's super breathable because of the huge amount of space there is between your mouth and the mask.  The foam is super nice, and I've gotten a few bounces off the flex part.  Lens changing is super simple too."
paintball,3aj6mn,IyamwhatIam,1 point,Sat Jun 20 18:53:47 2015 UTC,Have you ever worn the E-Vents? I'm worried that once I snip the foam there's no going back
paintball,3aj6mn,IyamwhatIam,3,Sat Jun 20 19:48:51 2015 UTC,"Cut a tiny bit, try it on, repeat! As long as you aren't taking off huge chunks of foam, you should be alright."
paintball,3aj6mn,kbustera,2,Sat Jun 20 20:30:11 2015 UTC,"I've owned, or worn all the modern masks (my first was a Scott). Your problem is weight. The quick change system Empire uses, while nice, is heavy. Try wearing it up higher before cutting ( might need to double strap). If that doesn't work, cut the foam. If that doesn't work, replace the foam you cut and get a lighter mask. I've never had any gripes or problems with the ProFlex or any of the older variations made (proshield, flex7, etc etc). The eFlex is a mix between ProFlex and events, but the weight makes it a sub standard substitute in my eyes."
paintball,3aj6mn,IyamwhatIam,2,Sat Jun 20 20:22:31 2015 UTC,Really the only reason I didn't choose the Proflex was because the lenses were a pain to change.

paintball,3aj6mn,DashsofRainbow,2,Sat Jun 20 18:49:17 2015 UTC,Buy a pair of proflexes and never look back.   Lenses last years of consistent play  Best breathability  The most customizable mask on the market  Incredibly comfortable for every head shape

paintball,3aj6mn,BurningPlaydoh,1 point,Sun Jun 21 15:51:06 2015 UTC,"Used to have a pair of E-Flex before I got my Grillz. IMO they're the two best masks on the market. Grillz feel more solid on my head, but the E-Flex are extremely breathable."
paintball,3aj6mn,stressedoutatumc,1 point,Mon Jun 22 02:03:12 2015 UTC,"Proflex for max breathability, communication and bounces.  Profiler for max protection, great FOV.  VIO if you want a jack-of-all-trades kinda deal, with excellent lenses and small profile (the extended bottoms are very similar to the Proflex bottoms as well.  Thats if you absolutely can NOT try on some masks to see what you like."

paintball,3ahcca,novonn,2,Sat Jun 20 04:40:38 2015 UTC,Is the macroline securely in? My Etek 3 did that sometimes.
paintball,3ahcca,IAmTheFatman666,2,Sat Jun 20 05:12:43 2015 UTC,I will check it tomorrow and report back.  I mean the hissing goes away inaudible so it can't be that much air. I guess it is alright. I will see tomorrow when I buy some paint and test fire it.
paintball,3ahcca,IAmTheFatman666,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:20:14 2015 UTC,The amount of air doesn't matter. A leak is a leak.     My best guess is to check the regulator where the macroline goes into it. There's that little tab thing that you have to push on to pull the macroline out. Make sure that's not pushed in.
paintball,3ahcca,valve_bender,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:27:52 2015 UTC,Aired up and blank fired this morning. Air leak was hissing from the 90 degree thread on the markers reg. After some shots I couldn't hear it anymore.
paintball,3ahcca,Seaskimmer,1 point,Sat Jun 20 12:42:52 2015 UTC,"It would still be pretty smart to address the issue so it doesn't actually break on you at a later date. What it sounds like is the macroline fitting is leaking either from the swivel point, which means replacement of the fitting(~$5+shipping), the threads aren't all sealed for some ungodly reason(fix is remove fitting, apply teflon tape to the threads, reinstall; if you don't have this, your field or shop might), or the macroline has been taken on and off many times, has been work down, and needs to be replaced.   My guess would be it's the macroline, because I think each time you dry-fired the gun, due to there not being a ball in front of the bolt it let out so much air that the pressure dropped down significantly, giving the macroline time to reset itself in the fitting."
paintball,3ahcca,alizaman,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:14:23 2015 UTC,"Put a drop of oil in the macro fitting and wiggle it around. It should help it seal up. It often takes a while to seal. The macro on my pump leaks for a few minutes, then seals itself. If not, your macroline or fitting is likely messed up."
paintball,3ahcca,paintballer11,1 point,Sat Jun 20 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"if its just leaking air, its always just an oring unless there is something REALLY wrong with it. if you can find the exact location of the leak, then you can usually pretty easily deduce where the bad oring is.  or it could just be macroline which is like a $1 fix. or it could be the fitting which might need some thread sealant or at worst a replacement which is a $3-5 fix."
paintball,3ahcca,paintballer11,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:24:50 2015 UTC,Put some thick grease on your macroline were it goes into the 90 and it should fix it.

paintball,3ah5yb,DashsofRainbow,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:43:37 2015 UTC,It's difficult to say with canadian used values... The Etha is a much better marker than the Azodin.  I am just wondering more about the hopper and tank... both would work just fine but might leave you wanting to upgrade in the future.

paintball,3aexfr,eatacactus,3,Fri Jun 19 16:43:06 2015 UTC,"It was mostly because it was my first time milling something on a CNC mill, let alone with a 4th axis, and when I got to the shop, I still needed to convert the program over to CAM. I also used a 1mm end mill that was available to me, rather than a larger bit, so we started at .4 inches per minute, then by the end had ramped it up to 2 inches per minute."

paintball,3ag16e,ahabswhale,2,Sat Jun 20 03:48:20 2015 UTC,"Smart Parts and Tippmann are the only two that are still clinging to their own proprietary thread. Smart Parts' RSX is the first SP gun to take Autococker threads, despite the Ion/Luxe threads to be vastly superior in function.  I do not know if the RSX ended up using the KEE ""improved"" (short) Autococker threads that unscrew in less turns, but I doubt they did as they were concerned with IP issues when I spoke with them last."
paintball,3ag16e,nathanjayy,2,Sat Jun 20 05:20:57 2015 UTC,"The worst part about autococker threads is the long shaft, it adds unnecessary length and weight to the marker and adds manufacturing cost. It's also got an unnecessarily large diameter (again adding weight).  I've heard a story that Bud Orr picked those threads because it was the closest tap he had in his garage. Autococker is the standard we're heading to, and it wasn't even designed with the application in mind - it's just what was sitting around in a dude's garage."

paintball,3ag16e,Fuzznutz14,9,Mon Jun 22 06:35:53 2015 UTC,"Make it so smaller Proshops have the ability to get new equipment as soon as it is released with better profit margins.  I cant tell you how many times something new has just been released, but it is not available to Proshops until easily 1-5 months later.  During that time big online sites like ANS gear buys every single item the manufacturers produce before you even get the option to buy it for your store and they start to saturate the market. The big distributors get the gear first, sell it like hotcakes because it is new, and by the time your local Proshop gets it, people may have purchased it online, bought something else, or just lost interest.  Also the Profit margins are alot better if you buy in bulk (obviously), but I cant afford to purchase 50 R2 Rotors, I only need like 5 and my margin is drastically lower than what ANS gear can achieve.  And as soon as ANS gear puts theirs on sale, my margin is gone and you just cant compete.    I understand that that is how the business works with online stores, I just wish the big companies would focus on the fields more than the superstores.  Kinda like how some people prefer local stores over Walmart.  Help the small guys first then sell all your remaining stock to ANS Gear and the like.  Also, Stop putting marker manuals on a CD, nobody has access to a computer with a CD rom drive at the field.... I just want to change my Rate of Fire. Ain't nobody got time for that."
paintball,3ag16e,nathanjayy,2,Sat Jun 20 03:06:02 2015 UTC,"Valid.  On our side of things, it is quite frustrating spending time putting together deals and support for fields /stores when they will drop you over $1/box discount from a competitor, especially these fly-by-night garage dealers that are importing paint."
paintball,3ag16e,Fuzznutz14,1 point,Sat Jun 20 05:23:46 2015 UTC,"Ya, I know how frustrating that can be. Unfortunately because of the low margins fields are stores are more apt to go after the cheapest equipment so they can get to make up for the margin.  Most people want the cheapest stuff they can get so they can get more profit.  Its a vicious cycle that hurts everyone."
paintball,3ag16e,MastaBro,1 point,Sat Jun 20 13:42:33 2015 UTC,"Now you say you know business, so you must know that a manufacturer has 0 incentive to sell to you at a better rate and earlier when they can dump all their stock in the superstore and forget about it. What makes you think they'll balance big distributors and small shops?"
paintball,3ag16e,nZcastillo,1 point,Mon Jun 22 07:45:40 2015 UTC,"They wont, its as simple as that.  Their business model is making products cheap and selling at high prices as quick as possible so they can make as much money as possible. The only reason they will stop is for the want of fields to continue offering their products.  Everyone shops online, It is nothing new.  But some times people will buy things that they can physically touch and examine before they purchase it.  This is why Manufacturers should allow the equipment to get into the hands of people at a Paintball facility at a affordable cost.  Eventually Stores and Fields will carry the bare minimum of equipment and just tell people to go online as they cant compete. Unfortunately unless the Store has a great field then it has no chance of keeping its doors open.  Once fields start closing and people realize they have fewer places to play then they might change their mind.  Just imagine your local Proshop and field just suddenly closed for good one day, and the next closest field is 2+ hours away.  You would suddenly spend alot more money on playing Paintball regularly or you would just get out of the sport. No one buys paintball gear when there is nowhere and no one to play with."

paintball,3aec03,i_like_turtles3,2,Sat Jun 20 23:50:41 2015 UTC,"I agree, wiping should be either completely taken out, or only at a time when it is even possible, such as the hopper on a break out or something like that. Honestly i would say do away with it completely.  I think if they utilize the kinect it could actually be quiet fun. For example, in order to super man dive you have to push your controller forward really fast toward the ground. Also, if it tracks the movement of your controller if you hold the controller sideways like a gun where the face of the controller is near your face and you turn it so that LT would become the trigger for the gun, i think that would be pretty neat (it would help if it was 6-axis). Finally you would be able to dodge and poke out easier around bunkers and such. I think it would still be very difficult to capture actually playing paintball though, since there is no explosions or surrounding factors like that to help create a sense of realism like call of duty has."

paintball,3aektk,Kahnbrochill,2,Fri Jun 19 14:13:50 2015 UTC,"That's a tough question. Is there anything about the A5 that you're not particularly happy with? The reason I ask is that any other guns in the same price bracket as the A5 are just going to be a lateral movement, it'd be like buying another A5.   If you're just looking for a bit more firepower on the cheap, the response trigger is kind of fun. Otherwise, I'd save up for a new gun and use the right-now savings to buy paint and get out on the field more.   Edit: Err, they're still charging ~$70 for the RT I guess? Maybe just buy paint...."
paintball,3aektk,FukinGruven,2,Fri Jun 19 14:42:48 2015 UTC,I mostly want more fire power ha.  What would you do? RT or continue to save for a new marker?  I had a buddy who had an E grip and he didn't have a great experience.  Granted that was years ago...
paintball,3aektk,FukinGruven,2,Sat Jun 20 02:35:11 2015 UTC,"Eh, sadly the response trigger isn't going to be a much better experience than the e-grip. Electronics are great but they need to be paired with break-beam eyes to really put that speed to practical use.  I'd probably save $250 - $350 for a nice used marker. Drone, Axe, Etek -- there's a bunch of great options out there."
paintball,3aektk,airman93,4,Sat Jun 20 02:50:45 2015 UTC,"It all depends on which style of play(woodsball or speedball) and how much you are willing to spend. Planet Eclipse make great speedball markers, I have an Etek 4 AM  and I love it! Empire Axe, MacDev Drone DX, Dangerous Power G5, Dye Proto Rail, All are great guns around $300-$500 range. Hope this helps!"
paintball,3aektk,Bigasssheep,3,Fri Jun 19 14:32:11 2015 UTC,Both to be honest.  Would like to keep it closer to the 200 range tho :/ that going to be possible???
paintball,3aektk,Agglet,2,Sat Jun 20 02:42:46 2015 UTC,Check out GOG markers/see what you can get used. Also save your A5 as a loaner gun
paintball,3aektk,FrigginAmerica,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:02:24 2015 UTC,Will do. Thank you!
paintball,3aektk,Bigasssheep,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:15:18 2015 UTC,"Get a speedball marker then, it'll function well in both Rec and speedball. Do learn some trigger discipline though if you're going to switch between the 2 constantly, as spraying paint ≠ skill. There's not a ton that you can get for 200, but much more you can get for 300, especially used. Axes, ethas, and eteks can all be found used for under 300. If you're really insistent on keeping it under 200, you might be able to find a used mini for that price.    In general I'd suggest saving over buying cheap, as you'll probably find yourself wanting a better gun within a year if you buy a shitty beginner speedball gun."
paintball,3aektk,Lepadep,0,Sun Jun 21 00:00:25 2015 UTC,"Unless one of the more experienced people here say otherwise, go with a 98 custom. I'm a woodsball player and I would say that's the most basic reliable gun in the industry (kind of like an ak for paintball)."

paintball,3aektk,stealthgerbil,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:12:32 2015 UTC,"Hello and welcome to /r/paintball! The A5 is a decent marker that will suite a majority of your rec ball needs. Pretty much any marker that shoots consistently at ~300fps and gets you out on the field for a day of play is fine for recball. Because of this I would not bother spending money on any upgrades for the A5, there aren't many performance upgrades available as most tend to be cosmetic things. Which have their place, but from a pure performance standpoint they serve almost no purpose.   Because of this I would recommend making sure you have other quality gear. Such as a high end mask, tank, pod pack, and whatever other things that you may need that will actually improve your playing experience. If you already have those items, I would just spend that upgrade money on paint or put it towards a newer marker when/if you grow tired of the A5. Let me know if you have any questions!"

I had one in my early days on a 98 custom and it felt like a brick slamming around. Just my personal opinion. Also just not worth the price, for ~70 bucks you could buy other nice gear (or put it towards a new gun in the 300-500 range.)"
paintball,3aektk,Bigasssheep,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:20:09 2015 UTC,"Really?  Any idea if they've since improved?  Reason I brought it up is the main reason I'd like a newer marker was to improve my rate of fire if need be.  I figured if I could spend the 70 and get the performance I'm looking for rather than buying an entirely new marker, why not right?"
paintball,3aektk,Bigasssheep,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:33:30 2015 UTC,"i would go play a few times before looking into a nice marker. the A-5 is fine but it is heavy and not air efficient. however if you aren't playing well with an A-5, getting a fancy marker wont magically turn you into a paintball legend."
paintball,3aektk,Ghillieguy,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:43:25 2015 UTC,Ha I play well with an A-5.  But it'd be nice to have a bit more fire power when you run across that guy who has the capability to throw auto paint my way.
paintball,3aektk,ejyazel,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:32:27 2015 UTC,"Well the A5 is a great marker, but don't bother upgrading it, it won't make it preform any better. Best you use that money on other equipment, paint, new marker, a date, etc...  But if you'd like to get a speedball marker, go for it. The performance and efficiency will be much better, and contrary to popular belief, speedball markers work just fine in the woods. Actually, they preform better in the woods, smaller and lighter bodies and far more ergonomic, puts them a little ahead of the game than milsim markers, even the ones with speedball internals. Downfall is you can shoot much faster with ease, but trigger discipline will fix that right up.  It's about preference, really. People still wreck the other team with 98s, the game is all about what you want."
paintball,3aektk,Tibbsyadig,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:48:38 2015 UTC,"Really?  Thats disappointing… (the upgrades).  Would you have a recommendation on a particular make to look for?  I'd love to spend 200 or less, if thats possible."
paintball,3aektk,NeonFeet,1 point,Sat Jun 20 02:31:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, all you get from upgrades might be faster firing, but for a marker with such low air efficiency, it's not the best idea IMO.  Hrng. Might want to buy used. A used Invert/Empire Mini would work, or an older Ion. Both would work pretty well, they keep up with high ends in terms of BPS."

paintball,3adsrk,ahabswhale,1 point,Sat Jun 20 00:10:39 2015 UTC,"Huh. 99% of the time when I hear something like this the company is still using a subcontractor. They may have had a hand in the design, but it's infinitely more economical to have the pros do it rather than purchase the equipment to actually manufacture a solenoid valve.  I mean I'm sure they don't advertise who they're contracting to make them, but I'm pretty darn sure they approached one of the aforementioned companies to make it for them."
paintball,3adsrk,BonesJackson,2,Sun Jun 21 16:33:46 2015 UTC,"Yes, someone else is making it for them (tbh likely a no-name in Taiwan) and they likely collaborated on the design, but it's a 100% custom solution and I know they did some of the design work in house, so I doubt there's going to be much available online.  The Axe solenoid actually uses two pulses, one to shift the valve, then the solenoid power turns off, then another pulse to close it. It is a fairly standard industrial design, although the latching is more rare in off the shelf designs, and the mounting and all that is custom. I recall Simon saying something about having difficulty with manufacturing a press-fit piece at some point... don't quite recall what it was."

paintball,3adsrk,BonesJackson,2,Sun Jun 21 18:16:36 2015 UTC,"Well, when the gun is aired up, the solenoid armature has a seal pressing against a hole with pressure in it. So there's enough force to overcome that pressure and create a proper seal. Every time the solenoid cycles, it moves away from that hole with the first pulse, then back against it with the second. If there's no air pressure, you get a double knock against you. If there were pressure, at the beginning of the second pulse, the valve is going to want to stay open. So normally you have to overcome that - but without pressure you're just giving it a bunch of force it doesn't need. Then as it reaches its resting position, you don't have to fight against the air coming from the input to the solenoid, so there's no damping as the valve closes. Put both of those together and your seal could get cut up. Depends on the seal material/design, which I don't know anything about. Disclaimer: just a best guess.  http://www.zdspb.com/media/tech/animations/invert_v3_7fps.gif  Honestly I wouldn't think this would be an issue with a robust seal design, but I have heard Axe solenoids have had some longevity issues so it's best to just follow the manual."
paintball,3adsrk,ahabswhale,2,Sun Jun 21 18:41:20 2015 UTC,"Alright, so it shouldn't be an issue unless they skimped on the design/production. Since we can't confirm it, it's probably not worth the risk."
paintball,3adsrk,BonesJackson,2,Sun Jun 21 18:54:07 2015 UTC,"No, it's the same as shooting the marker with air. The clicking is the solenoid cycling. That said, it's just extra wear and tear."
paintball,3adsrk,Seaskimmer,3,Sun Jun 21 19:35:54 2015 UTC,"Not exactly. When the solenoid has no resistance (air pressure), it slams harder and wears faster."
paintball,3adsrk,HELP_IM_ON_FIRE,1 point,Fri Jun 19 12:21:22 2015 UTC,"How do you figure? If anything, 75 psi is putting more wear and stress on it than being de-gassed."
paintball,3adsrk,BonesJackson,3,Fri Jun 19 23:40:03 2015 UTC,The valve inside the solenoid is designed to open and close very quickly under high pressure. The valve is designed to resist this pressure. The lack of pressure causes the solenoid opening to slam against the magnet harder than it would normally and then slam back in place.

paintball,3adsrk,BonesJackson,1 point,Sat Jun 20 06:25:19 2015 UTC,"Jack Wood seems to support that theory. According to him, the solenoid won't even cycle fully if there is no air (because who actually has brand new batteries). Regardless, a solenoid is supposed to be good for 5-10+ million cycles.   Yes it is perfectly normal. The solenoid works off a combination of electromagnetic drive and air assist (once gassed). With a most of the solenoids, if you have a brand new battery that is a decent brand you will get the solenoid to click every time as the charge being supplied by the fresh battery is enough to drive the internal mechanism on its own. However, as the battery level drops even slightly, when there is no ""air assist"" in the solenoid the battery cannot fully drive the mechanism every time you pull the trigger. However once the air is on the gun the air assist and the battery combine to make sure the solenoid funtions perfectly.  Hope that makes sense.  Jack"

paintball,3adsrk,M4LAngryGnome,1 point,Fri Jun 19 11:14:44 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say it's bad for the solenoid, but it does make it work. A little bit to hear the cycle rate you'll get out of your walk it ok. But keep in mind if your gun has eyes, you turn them off to hear the cycle. This cycle rate could be faster than your loaders feed rate. Best practice is aired up with paint, but if you want to just speed your fingers up, then walk it without the gun on.  TL;DR - The solenoid will be fine, but it's just as easy to practice with the gun off."

It has been thrown around, bounced while sliding, etc.  I've had zero feed neck issues with the enemy.  I'm about the same height as you and I weigh more.

paintball,3adebk,TheAmazingLeech,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:25:22 2015 UTC,"Alright, one thing I'm looking at with the eNMEy is a slightly longer barrel (14-16"") just to make it feel bigger. Every time I try finding information on a longer barrel, I keep getting directed to something called the ""freak barrel kit"" or something. I'm absolutely confused as to what this is. From looking at pictures it looks like a barrel you put on the gun that is stock length, then at the end of the stock barrel is MORE threading so you can thread different barrel ends on it to adjust cosmetics and barrel length."
paintball,3adebk,Bumblemore,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:33:12 2015 UTC,"The normal freak barrel is a 2-piece barrel, where the back section is bored out to accept freak inserts. These inserts are there so you can change the inner diameter of the barrel to better match the kind paint you are using (tighter or looser fit), allowing for you to enjoy the benefits of owning multiple barrels at a cheaper price, rather than buying 4 different barrels, you get one freak barrel and several inserts. I'd recommend getting a Custom Products barrel (CP) or something similar. Barrels don't make a huge difference past 8 inches in length.   On another note, you'll figure out pretty quickly that all the ""accessories"" you can get are basically just ways to make your marker heavier and less practical. As for the Tippmann having issues keeping up with the fire rate, this can easily be fixed by getting a decent force feed hopper. Ultimately, comfort and reliability are going to be your biggest factors in enjoying whichever marker you pick."
paintball,3adebk,GooeyPod,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:51:26 2015 UTC,"Barrels don't make a huge difference past 8 inches in length.   Afaik, the jury's still out on that. Most people that I've talked to agree that you don't want anything shorter than 10in or longer than 16in. Below 10 you're using too much air to just get it up to speed in the short barrel, beyond 16 the air isn't expanding much so you're needing more air to overcome the resistance.  Most seem to recommend 14in or so."
paintball,3adebk,BonesJackson,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:53:07 2015 UTC,"I recall Tom Kaye's testing leading him to believe 11"" is about ideal. However this can vary based on valve type because they release air at different rates. Because the spool was just a little bit slower than the poppet. A longer barrel was recommended to let the ball get up to speed in that case."
paintball,3adebk,valve_bender,1 point,Fri Jun 19 20:22:36 2015 UTC,"You also need to be conscious of the barrel threading when buying a barrel. The GOG Enmey is ion/impulse/smart parts threaded. The 98c is 98 threaded. If you buy anything other than your gun's thread type, the barrel is useless to you. I personally would recommend the freak back as well, as I like to underbore my paint slightly, but if you don't want to worry about bore sizing your paint, just buy the barrel in parts: a freak back, freak front, and a .695 insert. I like to underbore, because it can help with efficiency, and sound signature. Here is a video showing on how to bore your paint if you do decide to go down this route. Note there are other options besides the freak barrels to bore your paint, but freak barrels are the most commonly used method to bore match you paint."
paintball,3adebk,CDtothehizzle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:42:22 2015 UTC,695 is a tad big. I'd recommend 689 or 691 and everyone should be fine...
paintball,3adebk,mazu747,2,Fri Jun 19 18:17:21 2015 UTC,"Comparing the two side by side:  Durability: the Tippmann is a tank, you could throw these things at trees and rocks and shit and they'll survive. The eNMEy will very easily put up with some rough paintball use, so unless you plan to bash your marker with a rock for some reason, the eNMEy will put up with any abuse on the field.  Accuracy/barrel: barrels don't effect accuracy, it's all about the paint, these are bullets. They do affect sound signature and efficiency. eNMEy wins this, the 98 doesn't even have ports on its barrel, so it will be much louder in terms of the barrel only.  Bolts: this effects sound and efficiency as well. The eNMEy uses a spool valve bolt, a very common bolt type used in many high end markers, known for their low kick and low sound signature. They use a very low operating pressure so it will be quite efficient (though for high end markers, spools are not considered too efficient, but for a low end, it uses very little air which is amazing) The 98 uses a blowback, a rammer strikes a pin and air is released, which is pretty inconsistent in terms of velocity. Piss poor efficiency. You could get well over twice as many shots off the eNMEy than you will with the 98. They're also loud as FUCK.  Maintenance: the 98s are a fucking nightmare to open and clean. The body splits in half (clamshell) by you unscrewing a bunch of screws, pulling it apart and losing 100000 little pieces of you just barely jitter. The good news is you can go an entire year without cleaning it and it will probably be fine. My Salvo (98 with an M16 like body) hasn't been cleaned in a long time and it's fine (though it is my backup/loner so it doesn't see much use anyways). The eNMEy is super easy to clean. Stick an Allen wrench in the back of the bolt, turn it and it pops right out. Very quick and clean. This has to be done after a few days of usage, which really isn't a pain in the ass since it takes less than 5 minutes to clean and re-lube it.  You'll love how light and ergonomic the eNMEy is. Never heard of feedneck issues, but if one comes up, it is very easily replaced (probably by an even better feedneck!). Customizing a 98 isn't worth it if it's your only marker and don't want to blow a lot of money on it. They don't make the marker better, it's just a hobby some people have to mod the bodies of these things.  Summery: GoG eNMEys are much better."
paintball,3adebk,s0berr,1 point,Fri Jun 19 05:56:16 2015 UTC,"my personal opinions as a scenario player.  customization / upgrades do little to help a marker, maybe upgrade the feedneck and asa but upgrades dont hold resale value or provide much of an advantage.  things im looking for in a marker typically.  compact  light weight   reliable brand  regulated air  dont go too crazy into barrel upgrades ever, there are a lot of myths due to marketing when it comes to them. dont waste your money on a freak kit tbh, the only thing that will ever change is slightly more efficiency when under boring, less when overboring, and bore matching is the worst thing you can do as the imperfections of different balls will cause spikes in consistency lowering overall accuracy. as you are around paintball good deals will come to you in the barrel department, pick that sort of stuff up then.   mask most important thing, if you cant see you are no good  hopper second most important thing, you want to be absolutely sure every time you pull the trigger your marker is going to fire.  tank third most important, getting hpa is going to provide you with better consistency in turn improving your accuracy.  of course on top of all of that you want to get something that makes you excited to play the game."

paintball,3adebk,Wozrop,-8,Fri Jun 19 08:05:16 2015 UTC,"First of all, everyone here is gonna recommend the speedball gun, because well this is a speedball forum.  I'm gonna say get the 98 for a few reasons. First, it's the woodsball gun, it's very common and there are lots of upgrades for it, people say that upgrades will only make it heavier, which is somewhat true but only for the wrong upgrades.  A red dot sight would be somewhat practical for your play style, you gain the advantage of a more accurate first shot as you won't have to base where your aiming on where the last shot went.  You can get a cyclone feed system for the 98 which comes stock on the A5 and X7, the hopper feeds into a wide cylinder that is horizontally inline with the breach, it uses paddles to feed the balls, it can feed about 20bps, which is plenty fast enough as most e triggers can only do 15bps. Which leads me into an e trigger, it gives you more fire mode options than just semi auto, if you want a high rate of fire than it would something you'd want, but I never use mine as I don't use that much paint, and I can never find enough 9v batteries.  There's also magfed, which is getting pretty huge, instead of a hopper you have a 20 round magazine, rap4 will have a magfed conversion kit for the 98 out soon, it uses dmag, which currently are a 10+10 double stack, but there will be a new version that's continually 20 balls.  It sounds like your going down the milsim side of the game and so I recommend the milsim gun"
paintball,3adebk,FukinGruven,11,Fri Jun 19 12:46:46 2015 UTC,"I'd like to dispel a weird myth that continues to propagate through the paintball community, especially among inexperienced players:  A ""speedball marker"" will not perform better when you shoot at inflatable bunkers. A ""woodsball marker"" will not perform better when you shoot into heavy brush.  I don't know where people got it in their heads that the 98c is a woodball gun. It's rented for both wood and speedball everywhere in the country. The only reason it is ever recommended as a first buy is because you essentially can't break the thing and they are cheap as hell.   This isn't a speedball forum, this is a forum of users who have made the mistakes common to all new players to the sport, and we really hope that our mistakes can be learned from.   Everyone I know who convinced themselves that the 98c was the best marker on the planet wound up pouring hundreds of dollars into the gun hoping to quiet it down, make it shoot faster, chop less paint, be more accurate (see: I wanna be a sniper!!), etc.   While they didn't achieve any of that, they did manage to take a sub-$200 marker and ratchet that price well into the $400+ range. All the while, for $265 I picked up a ""speedball marker"" with every single feature they tried to add to their gun and play mostly woodsball and scenario games with it.

Also your point about performance in a specific setting is not entirely true, it's more about fire rate, in speedball you'll be shooting a lot more than you would be in the woods, if you shot your gun like you were playing speedball you would run out of paint in 3 minutes.  And if your saying a woodsball marker isn't any better in the bush than in airball, you've probably never seen any one try it, like I said, it's about fire rate, the fire rate that saves your paint in the forest get you shot on the speedball field.  I'm not saying the 98 is the best gun he should try and make it his own right now, I'm saying that would be a good gun to get.  I also recommend the 98 because magfed is getting to be very big in the woodsball scene and there is a conversion kit for the 98 if he'd want to go that sub-route.

Also, just because I CAN fire at a high rate of speed with my marker doesn't mean that I WILL.   If your argument is that woodsball guns fire at a lower rate of speed, therefore they are more accurate and can save more paint, that's just asinine. All speedball markers have various rates of fire, one of them being semi-automatic. I can pull my trigger every bit as slow as you can. Now that we both fire the same rate of speed, you have no advantage.   Second, they create pod packs for a reason. If my hopper runs out because I decided to fire like a madman, I just reload. I can carry up to 11 pods of paint. Even if firing one shot at a time somehow magically increased your accuracy, you still need at least one reload pod with you.   Third, accuracy is not an option in paintball, much less woodsball. You can only be so accurate with a round bullet filled with liquid. They just aren't naturally accurate. On top of that, unless your woodsball field is meticulously groomed every year, there's a million twigs, branches, tall grass, etc. that will break your paint before it hits your target. I go through far more paint out on the woods fields because it's much harder to actually put paint on your target. If you think you can 1-shot 1-kill out in the woods, you're kidding yourself.  Sorry, none of those arguments hold water. Let me reiterate -- I am not a speedball player. I play mostly woods, rec, and scenario games. I still use a speedball marker because as long as a marker can shoot paint, you can use it anywhere you want. Which means when I get tired of woodsball or curious about speedball, I don't feel the need to go buy a new marker to compete."

There are inexpensive'ish HPA options. But, you'd probably be filling up more often.  So depending on the cost of fills for you, the HPA might continue to be more expensive per fill.   Different places will charge differently - so you'd have to check. Common models are co2 by weight and HPA as a flat fee or possibly differentiated by pressure level."

paintball,3afclp,doodilie,1 point,Fri Jun 19 19:04:15 2015 UTC,"Wiser? Eh probably. But sometimes C02 is the way to go. HPA will be more consistent. CO2 pressures vary a lot based on ambient temps, and even how much you're shooting. HPA varies a ton less.  But, some folks just can't get HPA filled up. Their local field just doesn't have the capability (rare these days, but not unheard of). And there's also the ability to go to a gas supply shop (like for welding) and getting CO2 filled for cheap   So it's a toss up...   But there's low priced steel HPA tanks. Lower priced 3k, Aluminum bottle tanks - a 62/3000 with an MSRP of $65 http://www.ninjapaintball.com/Ninja2014catalog/index.html  And then you jump to the 4.5K bottles starting solidly over $100 msrp"

paintball,3ac62v,Agglet,2,Sun Jun 21 00:02:27 2015 UTC,"absolutely!  alien's markers are basic stacked tube poppets, designs ""borrowed"" from Bob Long and Eclipse. so if you buy a new alien you're basically buying a copy of an Ego... you're better off just getting the  Ego in the first place and actually having parts and support available if necessary. that being said there's nothing too inherently terrible about them, they're just an order of magnitude less popular which means more expensive and more rare parts, and harder to sell if you grow tired of owning one.  however there is one difference between a normal poppet marker and an alien. alien uses a bolt they call the ""sweep"" bolt which is supposed to put more air at the bottom of the paintball in order to create backspin. backspin would, like the flatline barrel, increase accuracy and range.   unfortunately, this bolt does not actually produce backspin, it only puts out more air. the only thing this accomplishes is a higher FPS. this has been shown to be true about half a dozen times by 3rd parties - most notably PunkWorks. they filmed with a high speed camera and showed that paintballs fired with the sweep bolt do not spin in any way differently than any other bolt. (they have also filmed the flatline and apex with the same camera and shown that they definitely cause consistent, significant backspin). they went back and forth between alien with their findings and there was a whole bunch of drama including jack rice (alien's owner) falsifying a bunch of data and filming a laughably bad video in order to ""prove"" that the sweep system worked. if you actually watch the video... it shoots all over the place, with both bolts. it's pretty funny actually.  alien's marketing, their whole claim to fame, is based entirely on the sweep bolt and the assertion that alien markers are more accurate than other markers. an assertion which is completely false."

Doesn't use a poppet, but Jack Rice (owner of Alien) and Griffan Spanner (paintball guru) designed a valve is essentially a spool that hits a hammer.  The gun is unreal, and even the prototype that I had for a few months (the only working gun for a while) was the best shooting gun I've ever shot and I've shot them all. Griffan and Jack will also support the gun to no end. The Deception is finnicky, and getting it to work was sometimes a challenge. But when it was working it was pretty unparralled"

paintball,3ac62v,ImperiumOfMankind,1 point,Fri Jun 19 00:20:40 2015 UTC,"Jack Rice came up with an idea for a boltless paintball gun around 12 or so years ago. He was just a poster on pb nations ""custom"" gun forum. If I recall correctly, it used a trap door to seal the breech and use an air burst to fire the paintball. Anyway, there were a ton of revisions and eventually a low production release happened. While he was putting that design together, he came up with a stack tubed poppet system. He claimed his ""sweep"" system of valving/bolt action made the guns more accurate and shoot further.  He released a gun based on this system ever since.   When a buddy and I had a deal with a shop to get things at cost, we got an alien independence to check out. This was back around 2010. Was not a fan at all. Very loud, lots of kick, not a smooth shooter. This was my experience putting around 8-10 cases through it. I gave it to my buddy and I'm pretty sure he sold it super cheap after a day out with it.   If you're thinking of picking one of their guns up, do your best to seek out someone shooting one where you play. Always your best bet when checking out any marker if it all possible."

If you have issues with one of their markers you can email or call and they will walk you through fixes as best they can to avoid having to send it in. Also it seems the markers they come out hold there value longer compared to dye or pe that comes out with a new marker every year.
