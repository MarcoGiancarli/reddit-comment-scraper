subaru,3e37r2,guitarnerd29,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:31:17 2015 UTC,"as a former 08 WRX owner, with a Stg1 Perrin tune via Access point,  the spooling on it was awesome.  It may not have the top end of the new newer WRXs, but it has an awesome turbo for a DD Street machine.  Sucks they kinda shafted that year on suspension, body, as well."

Much more stable, transition from vacuum to boost feels much smoother. Oh and max boost is up to 16.5psi vs 11.5psi stock.   Costs $150,  with full support after the tune is done.

Dealer told me they were all seasons but when I looked them up before I bought some new ones, turns out they weren't.  I managed to make it through a Buffalo, NY winter with them although it got a little sketchy here and there. You would have no issue accelerating, I managed to get going just fine, but my problem came with braking. Car liked to slide way more then my previous car and I really didn't know why at the time. Ended up just engine braking a lot to get around that.  Now I have a set of continental extreme all seasons as I don't really care enough to have a set of snows and summers."

I am on my 3rd winter right now and the tires still have thick thread and it still grip well. I think it will last me another few winters.   In the long run, it won't cost you a lot to have winter tires. Buy a set of steel wheel or any other cheap wheel to mount the winter tires.  Swap it when the temperature goes down(winter time)."

subaru,3e0nzz,Austinquick,5,Tue Jul 21 01:28:38 2015 UTC,"I was driving to work this morning when I saw a semi truck loose a trailer tire. A second later, a Subaru Forester hit the tire and flipped end over end, then rolled 3 more times before coming to a stop against the median a hundred or so feet away. I ran over and made sure she was good and not hurt, then helped her out and shut the car off. We sat and talked, amazingly she walked away with only a sore arm. Another couple stopped also, they called 911. They ended up being long time friends of my cousin. All of us were in shock, the driver probably being the most calm out of the group, her only concern was her newly totaled Subaru. Her wallet was thrown across the median and her backpack out the window a few feet away. Weirdly, airbags did not deploy, which flipping forwards and sideways should have triggered. I still cannot believe that she walked away from this, and I am thankful that she did. I cannot believe that after all of the tumbling this Forester did, that the cage is still intact, and the driver completely unharmed. I am amazed.  TL;DR: Watched a girl flip a Forester 4+ times and walk away totally unharmed."

You only need to see something like that once and you'll always be careful.  Very happy that the driver was able to walk away from this and it didn't end with a loss of life.  It's disturbing that the airbags didn't deploy though.  To me that's a major cause for concern.
subaru,3e0nzz,FluxxxCapacitard,6,Tue Jul 21 01:49:40 2015 UTC,"It doesn't look like anywhere there is an airbag sensor got hit hard enough.  Interestingly, everywhere else got smashed pretty hard.  Most of the energy of the crash looks like it was absorbed on the passenger side rear near the roof.  That's a weird looking crash.  And I used to drive a tow truck in college.  So I've seen a lot of them.    What is weird to me is that OP had to shut off the car.  I would have thought the inertia switch would have killed the car.  Does Subaru explicitly tie it to an airbag deploy?  Or is it like some other cars that it can independently kill fuel even in a non airbag deployment?  That or the fucking thing is built like such a beast that it didn't need either!  It said fuck it, ready for some more."

subaru,3e2v66,entfromhoth,3,Tue Jul 21 15:15:00 2015 UTC,"Rust Timing belt Water pump Head gaskets are not a huge issue on this year, not sure where you heard that, this year has the EJ251 as opposed to the one that is ""notorious"" which was retired in 1999, the EJ25D. The leaks on the EJ251 are typically external oil leaks and slow, as opposed to the EJ25D which usually had internal leaks (oil mixing with coolant) and needed a fix right away, if you are stingy or strapped for cash external leaks can be lived with for years, just keep an eye on oil level and get a compression test if you can. (This really goes for most any car over 10 years old) Outside of head gaskets, valve cover gaskets may need work if it was a northern car and not taken care of, not a common problem and more related to how the previous owner treated it. Check the transmission fluid and level, SO MANY SHOPS will overfill it and cause the pan to start leaking around the edges during heavy use, outside of that if it smells burnt it needs to be changed out. Though at this kind of age (>10 years) you should replace it anyways if it wasn't done recently. Check the coolant (take off the radiator cap ONLY IF THE CAR IS 100% COLD OPENING HOT WILL RESULT IN BURNS AND A STEAM EXPLOSION and ensure it's not got shit floating in it, white/chocolate/black shit is usually oil, again at this age coolant should be changed anyways) Don't check the coolant in the reservoir as it's probably dirty and you won't be able to tell anything from that. Diffs are pretty sturdy on these years, but you should still check them for leaks and the front's fluid level--though the dipstick is a PITA to reach Coolant hoses, especially this one running from the air conditioning are going to probably have holes after 10 years, check upper/lower radiator hose first and then check the AC line. This is the AC hose I'm talking about. The part new is in the $200-300 range (cannot just replace the hose), and you cannot buy a used/scrap one in most areas for some idiotic reason when I tried, so if you find a hole just buy some cheap hose and clamp it down as tight as you can, it should be fine for a few years. The speakers (rear ones specifically, and often the driver-front) have a high chance of being blown out if the previous owner drove with the windows down a lot in the rain. The hose that goes from the windshield washer reservoir to the sprays on the hood will sometimes come loose. There is a joint plastic piece between the set of hoses in the assembly that connects a 3 way joint to a small hose and then another 1 way plastic piece to a second hose. Removing the 1 way and just connecting the hose directly will fix it entirely. Expect at least 1 wheel's alignment to be frozen if it's a northern car. Check the rust prevention coating on the bottom of the frame, it should still mostly be there, with probably a few spots scraped off from where shop lift arms have been used. If you're in the north, there is a liquid sealant you can spray if you're paranoid about it. The tiny lightbulbs for the heated seat lights (if equipped), shifter light (if automatic) will probably be burned out. They're at most auto stores and somewhat cheap. The instrument cluster lights may or may not have a couple burnt out if this was a northern car. Not too bad to replace (while you're at it, replace the radio, get a subaru harness adapter off amazon and any cheap radio will do.) The rear gate's handle might be a bit sticky and stick in the ""open"" position, just press down on it and shut the gate it will be fine if you do that every time. The lube inside has just dried up. The rear gate light assembly may or may not be leaky and let water in when it rains. YMMV, this seems to be more of a problem with the legacy outbacks. The stalk for the directional will probably be dirty inside the relay and ""click"" forever when in the neutral position (but otherwise work fine) at this age. It's annoying as fuck if it happens and replacing/cleaning the dirty lube is easy, takes 15 minutes tops. The plastic hose going from the intake to the resonator box to the engine will sometimes get dislodged at the resonator at a T joint, just plop it back in place. The plastic fasteners are probably worn from age. This only applies to NA engines, not turbo. If turbo, get that shit checked and make sure it was at least somewhat taken care of. The secondary cooling fan/air conditioner fan in the engine will sometimes blow the fuse if the wiring has aged to a certain point. When using the AC just keep an eye on the coolant temperature when doing a test drive. Either replace the wiring or replace the fuse and watch the coolant, either one is cheap, easy, and works fine. Chances are you don't need to replace the wiring, but rather the tape around it has just dried up and started to fall off. When checking under the car make sure there are no slow leaks around the oil drain plug. A LOT of shops will over-tighten it and strip the thread. The heat shields will RATTLE LIKE MAD if it ever had any work done that involved adjusting or removing the exhaust. Just get them removed, it's not worth the hassle of trying to pinpoint the noisy spot. At least IMO. The exhaust will probably have some holes if it's a northern car, and the muffler hanger will probably be badly rusted (heat shields removed, patch, new hanger for me was $200 at a shop, I'm sure you can get cheaper if you shop around, I was lazy). I would highly recommend replacing the spare tire at this age, since it's a full size spare just go to a tire shop and ask for a used one. However, only do this if the tire is flat/low on air, most shops WILL NOT remove a 10+ year old tire if it's over 20PSI (spare is 60PSI). Depending on the condition, tires like this can be very dangerous to handle. Knock sensor on some models (check engine light). Airflow sensor is usually recommended to check but you should be fine with the EJ251 (MAP as opposed to commonly failing MAF) (also check engine light) Catalytic converter, unlikely but maybe. YMMV, get a mechanic to check it specifically when going in for an inspection. O2 sensors (check engine light). Somewhat easy to replace and pretty cheap. Door shut sensor buttons might not detect the door is closed all the way on the driver door, when in the car, shut the door and push outward on it, if the inside lamp comes on it needs to be adjusted or replaced (I just stuck a piece of rubber in the hole to fill the gap, good as new). Check the suspension on a car this old, it's probably fine but just to be sure. Have the seatbelts/airbags checked by a dealer or trusted mechanic since it's over 10 years old. Make sure ALL recalls are taken care of. Throw your VIN on the subaru website and it will tell you. If it has fog lights and it's a northern car, they are probably cracked. Just fill the cracks/hole with glue, replacing the fog lights is a pain in the ass. Check neutral if it's a manual, I've heard of it sticking in gear if it was abused by it's previous owner but don't know how common it is. Similarly, check park/the parking prawl if it's an auto, though it should be fine. The gauges may fly around (jump to max and then back, as if you put the key in a newer car like this) if you go over a bump in a specific way, specifically the speedo when going slow over a heavy bump. It will return to normal near instantly so don't worry about it, as far as I can trace it it's a sensor issue....... or a wiring harness issue somewhere.......... MAYBE....... but after 4 months of trying to diagnose it I gave up. It happens rarely so just be aware of it so it doesn't freak you out the first time you see it. Not a big deal. Check/replace spark plugs Check/replace spark plug wires and distributor cap If it has a heated windshield (wiper de-icer) make sure A. it works, and B. the windshield hasn't been cracked by it. Make sure the cowl still has the plastic fasteners on the outer edges (there will be a circular hole there if they are missing). If not, at highway speeds you will hear an ungodly noise from the wind. Easy/cheap to replace. Make sure the idle speed is steady at around 600-700 RPM when the engine is fully warmed up (after ~10min of driving). If manual, make sure the clutch isn't squeaky or loose. Check the cruise control cable and accelerator cable for sticking. With the car off and in park have someone press down on the gas all the way then let go steadily, and watch the cable move in the engine bay, you'll see if it sticks at all. With gloves on, then do the same with the cruise control lead (press down on it to open), again with the car off. It's normal for the pedal to ""stick"" when first trying to press it down, so long as it only happens with the car off, but otherwise it should be smooth. Check brakes/fluids/tires/alignment/service history/wear items/etc. as with any used car. ""Knocking"" when cold that goes away as it warms up is normal. ""Piston slap"" (tsch tsch tsch tsch noise as revs increase) is normal. Prolonged knocks are NOT normal. Sounding a bit like a tractor motor when idling is normal, that's just from age.   And when I say ""check for leaks"" I mean look for wet spots on the metal and stains around where gaskets/seals would be. This is an exaggerated example, most will not be this thick and wet, it usually shows itself as a stain.  Most of these were just general ""used car"" checks included with some specifics.

I gravitated to Subaru and bought an XV/Crosstrek a few months ago because it can handle just about anything Ohio winters can throw at it. It's got clearance and travel yet handles more like a sporty car than an SUV. Wish I saw more tough Subies over fast Subies on here."

According to the forums nothing is directly supported by it, it was added to improve the crash test rating for off axis frontal crashes (from 4 to 5 star). Anyhow, there was a bunch of posts where people removed it entirely.  That said, I still do eventually want to repair it... but it aint cheap (~$1000 because of the labor involved in removing all those shitty rusty bolts). It's not a job I want to mess with myself (it took me 5 hours to change my fog lights because the heads snapped on 4/6 of the bolts. lots of cursing and blowtorch work to remove the busted off remains from the mounting plate. fuck rust.) There are some nice aftermarket lightweight frames, too, but people expressed concern about them not letting the engine drop out of the bottom properly in a crash.  FYI, also Chicago. As little as 3 years ago it still looked like it was doing its job... but then we had all these crazy ass winters.  Edit: have a bonus pic. The subframe on the other side"
