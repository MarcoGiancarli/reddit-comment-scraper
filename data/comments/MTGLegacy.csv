MTGLegacy,3e4lnf,456852456852,3,Tue Jul 21 22:29:09 2015 UTC,"I can't give you firsthand experience yet, but I like the card and I will definitely play it as a 1-of when I pick up Elves again. It definitely seems to increase the reliability of the deck's ability to kill, but that has almost never been a problem for Elves. The biggest issue is that it requires the same thing that NO and 'hoof do to win: a board full of Elves. It doesn't help much with the worst matchup Elves has (which is also the most represented deck in the Legacy metagame, currently): Miracles.   Terminus hoses the deck so hard it's not even funny. I stopped playing Elves literally because it felt so bad to grind out that matchup for 50+ mins every time, come so close to winning multiple times, and get blown out by one Terminus in 7-8 out of 10 games.   All that considered, it's still a sweet card and a very welcome addition to the list. Increasing consistency is never bad."
MTGLegacy,3e4lnf,atm0,7,Tue Jul 21 23:51:57 2015 UTC,It makes Collected Company a win condition. It's good.  EDIT: Thought I was in the modern subreddit.  My bad. I look silly...

MTGLegacy,3e4lnf,tresle101,5,Wed Jul 22 06:57:02 2015 UTC,"Correct me if I'm wrong but I would consider this card a great boon against Miracles. You know you will get hit by Terminus so perhaps the answer is to build a smaller contingent of elves on the board, drop the Shaman, bounce, drop, get hit by Terminus, rebuild."
MTGLegacy,3e4lnf,LastTomato,1 point,Wed Jul 22 01:42:24 2015 UTC,"It is interesting, this guy wants you to have a bunch of elves in play so you can drain alot.

Hard to say how it will fare but I am probably going to be testing it in Legacy."
MTGLegacy,3e4lnf,Umezete,3,Wed Jul 22 02:29:15 2015 UTC,It is playable alongside craterhoof as an alternative win con. I like it
MTGLegacy,3e5gxr,noahgs,5,Wed Jul 22 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know what numbers you're looking at. 3 Fetchland Tendrils in the top 16 of the last Legacy GP, 2 FT top8s at Prague Eternal, and at least 1-2 decks in most of the recent IQ top16s. That's pretty damn healthy. Is Omni arguably the stronger deck? Probably, but it's never going to push storm out of the format."
MTGLegacy,3e5gxr,TheScynic,3,Wed Jul 22 03:28:41 2015 UTC,"I may be wrong, but I thought the health of Storm was suffering because Miracles is the dominant deck in the format.   Most Storm variants not only have poor matchups vs Force of Will/Counterbalance, but they also suffer against the other decks people bring in exactly to face Miracles. MUD? Aggro Loam? They all run Chalice of the Void, at least 3s, main deck.   If you have troubles vs the biggest deck in the format AND against the decks built to hate this specific one, your margin is slim to win."
MTGLegacy,3e5gxr,DXArcana,2,Wed Jul 22 03:58:13 2015 UTC,Why did this get down voted? I feel like a lot of people on this board have little to no experience in the match up.

Poppet gets bigger. Poppet costs 7 and he's a bit of a late comer . Serrated Arrows costs 4 and helps me against Infect which is a hard matchup, but isn't a creature, which I guess doesn't really matter unless I want to play Poppet which is only a 4/4 anyway. Triskelion also hits Liliana or Jace which can be very relevant ."

MTGLegacy,3e34mg,noahgs,8,Tue Jul 21 16:23:00 2015 UTC,"Swords to Plowshares is so good. So, so good. Far better than 4 Punishing Fire in most situations.  Counter-Top is usually worth considering, especially if you play Brainstorm, which you should. This opens you to Terminus to stabilize.  Verdict is amazing.  Stoneforge Mystic can be splashed with ease, or sideboarded.  UW is practically the core of control for legacy, which is pretty bad for variation among hard control decks. Miracle is kinda the cookie cutter of hard control, and Stoneforge/Jund midrangey decks make up the soft control portion.  Also, white is beyond the best sideboard Colour in the game.  Why would you want RG in control without just playing Jund? I guess I just don't see the appeal of green in control.  RUG is best paired with black, and Shardless Agent / Bloodbraid, where you can have some cascade fun, but that's not a proper control deck in my eyes - it's more of a midrange deck."
MTGLegacy,3e34mg,Grasswalker,4,Tue Jul 21 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"I agree on all points, but would want to add that you can absolutely make a strong Control deck in BUG based on the strength of Abrupt Decay. Shardless is definitely in the area of midrange, but the 2nd place list from the most recent SCG 5k certainly pushes a control theme. I think if you throw some Lilianas and Jaces in the maindeck, you'll be seriously cooking with some gas."

That card is everywhere and it's too easy to make a billion little dudes on a critical turn.   No pressure. Delver decks beat combo because they can both disrupt and pressure. I think a deck like this would gain something from a better clock, because it can't lock down the game like counterbalance or a pile of dazes/hymns/stifles.   Pros: Youngy pyro and punishing fire are best buddies. You get to end the game quick with a pile of little dudes.  Wasteland lock is a real thing. Never losing the punishing fire combo is great. Loam was sweet.   Deck felt a bit like Grixis control with a slightly different angle. I missed cabal therapy, but punishing fires does fight delvers and DnT well.   My build was for the more grindy matchups, but it sacrifices too much early game. I think it needs delvers and deathrites, but then we have to ask: How does this improve BUG delver, or RUG delver? Answer: Don't think it does."

MTGLegacy,3e34mg,Grasswalker,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:11 2015 UTC,"The labs were a concession to Omni. Honestly they're not incredible, because they cast the show and tell, you get in Lab they get Onmiscience. Pass turn, they cast wish, you have a chance to counter. If you can't, they get Eladamri's call for Emrakul. It gives you a few turns, usually, but it also makes it impossible for you to amass an army with young pyro. Also they can still cast Digs for free on your turn. I think it might actually be better to jam Iona, Shield of Emeria. Just shuts them off. Kill at your leisure.   Let me know how it goes, I want the deck to work, but I have limited testing time, so I'm going with tried and true delver."

It's a 2 mana spell that does 2 damage.  You can buy it back by tapping Grove to get the recursion trigger, then spending the mana to pay for the trigger.  Oh, since Grove is a mana ability, you can use it while a split second spell is on the stack to put the trigger for the Punishing Fire on the stack and resolve that before the split second spell resolves.  I guess if people played extirpate you could do this to fizzle the extirpate if it was cast on a punishing fire.  Also, each punishing fire triggers on the life gain, so 1 Grove can recur-trigger all your fires (but you will need to pay R for each of them)  Other than that it's pretty straightforward."

MTGLegacy,3e0mjd,magictgmike,4,Tue Jul 21 12:26:46 2015 UTC,"Yes. When a spell with Split Second is on the stack, nobody can play spells or use activated abilities that aren't mana abilities.

I see you have 4 Scrublands. Have you considered building Deadguy Ale (BWx Blade)?  Also, you can look into Aggro Loam as another poster suggested, which is typically a Junk deck splashing Red. It plays out a bit differently than a typical BGx midrange deck primarily by employing Chalice of the Void. This might be a attractive option if you don't want to get a playset of Tarmogoyfs.

MTGLegacy,3dur82,Watchyobak,5,Sun Jul 19 17:52:19 2015 UTC,"Former High Tide enthusiast here. As much as I love this deck, the sad truth is that it's just can't be competitive anymore. Against the 3 boogeymen of the format (Miracles, Omnitell, various Delver/Tempo decks):  -The deck has no answers to a resolved Counterbalance lock, as experienced Miracles players will make it a point to float a 3 drop on top before passing turn, taking away your option for Wipe Away.  -Omnitell is just faster. They also don't randomly fizzle out 10 minutes into comboing.  -All manner of Delver decks are a huge problem for this deck. Soft permission hurts us much harder than other decks, as its simply not enough for us to resolve some combo pieces, we also need to be floating mana after each spell. In addition, each delver deck has its own demons that haunt us (BUG has discard, UWR has Meddling Mage and Cannonist, RUG has REB and Stifles).  That said, here are some answers to your questions. Proceed with caution.  1) I love High Tide too. Don't set the bar too high, just have fun with the deck knowing its tier 1.5 / tier 2.  2) Worst match-ups are MUD, Miracles, RUG, BUG Delver, UWR variants, Omni, Stompy Decks, Prison Decks, to name a few. Best match-ups are Lands and maybe Tendrils decks if you play Countertop package.  3) I'm not too familiar with Reset Tide, but I've been told it's generally weaker than its Time Spiral counterpart. Being able to combo off at instant speed is its biggest saving grace, though you'll have to personally decide if that's worth the power cut.  4) A lot of this depends on the meta you're up against. Storm decks and Burn have a particularly difficult time getting through Counterbalance, so feel free to run it if your meta has a lot of those. I used to run a 3/2 split of top and Counterbalance, though others opt to run none at all saying those cards tend to clog up your Time Spirals and cause you to fizzle out more often than you'd like. Seeing 10 cards off of Spiral is nice, but there's also the chance you'll see multiple tops before you combo off.  5) This card shouldn't be a problem. Don't try for a lethal Zenith when your opponent has a resolved RiP, instead just go for a Brain Freeze kill. I'll take this time to make the comment that the deck plays out very differently with and without Candelabras, as its difficult to hit X for 60 if you're not playing with Candelabras. With the resurgence of Emrakul decks, this is incredibly important, as the alternative is being forced to play subpar tech cards like Ravenous Trap or Surgical Extraction.  6) Hah. Let me know if you figure out how to win this one.  7) Siding out a High Tide against Surgical decks is a good habit. I'd recommend going up to 3 Cunning Wishes if you're going to try this, as it's particularly important to find High Tide before combo-ing off. You can also side out a Turnabout, but this comes back to the point of Candelabras. A reasonable split would be 4/2 or 3/3 on Candels/Turnabout, so siding one out shouldn't hurt you as much. With a 4x Turnabout and no Candelabras, I'm not sure if you'd want to move any of them into the sideboard.  8) Honestly I don't think you can beat this card without Candelabras. You just don't have the raw power and mana count to power into a lethal Zenith or Freeze. Alternatively, just try and jam the combo before they can reach 4 mana.  I don't think you'd ever side out Force of Will. It's just too good in a mono blue combo deck.  Hope this helped, just remember that the deck isn't tier 1 anymore. Don't get too worked up over losses, and savor those rare moments where you get to play Solitaire in front of your opponent for 10 minutes."
MTGLegacy,3dur82,jesturelol,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:10:05 2015 UTC,Can't you just Chain of Vapor the Counterbalance and then when they tap to put Top on top to counter it you can Wipe Away?
MTGLegacy,3dur82,rifter5000,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:43:26 2015 UTC,"You're getting 2 for 1'd -- which is certainly not ideal. I don't think CMC=3 on top of your deck is your biggest concern with Miracles either. They side into so much cheap and efficient counter magic (plus of course the constant threat of a CounterTop) it's just very, very hard to resolve the numerous parts of the combo."
MTGLegacy,3dur82,henryponco,4,Mon Jul 20 09:30:33 2015 UTC,"I do have to note, jesturelol in his reply on here makes a very good point, keep in mind I am very bias towards High Tide because I'm insane, however, the information cannot be ignored: He writes, and then explains why: ""Former High Tide enthusiast here. As much as I love this deck, the sad truth is that it's just can't be competitive anymore. Against the 3 boogeymen of the format (Miracles, Omnitell, various Delver/Tempo decks):""  Having noted that, I am playing in DC at the open in a few weeks since it is Legacy, I am still on High Tide. I pretty much just ""stopped"" because I haven't been motivated to do the IQ's and I'm trading at events instead. When the main event is Legacy it's still on though, the last one however for me was Philly back in almost January, couldn't make Worcester.  Counterbalance will likely still be in my sideboard.  Against Rest in Piece you just bounce it if it becomes a problem, or go to Brain Freeze route instead since they have no graveyard either and you know it's safe to mill since Rest in Piece stops Emrakul shuffle type hurdles. When you get Candelabras, that will help you make a lot more mana and Rest in Piece will be even less of a problem. You'll make so much mana Rest in Piece won't matter.  Miracles is a tough match up, instead of waiting forever to go off, try to go off as soon as possible, preferably turn 4, the longer you wait, the higher a chance they resolve a counterbalance. When I first played Tide, I did a 1 maindeck Wipe Away / 1 sideboard Wipe Away, and the main reason over all others was for help against Miracles decks and those counterbalances.   Always run a single turnabout in the sideboard, it's too useful. Always put a high tide in the sideboard games 2/3 as ANY deck can potentially run surgical extraction (phyrexian life mana cost) If they Extract your Time Spirals with Slaughter Games, you have to try to set yourself up for a huge blue sun's zenith or a brain freeze without spiraling, BUT, without candelabra's, that's going to be almost impossible to pull off consistently. Getting Candelabra's will definitely help with some of these issues.  Also, the format right now, is a tough road for High tide, it is not as well positioned as it was pre Delve spell era (Treasure Cruise was even worse though) If you want to play this deck, play it because you love it and you can still get some level of results.   Hope that helps! ~Feline Longmore"
MTGLegacy,3dur82,Feline_o1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:54:34 2015 UTC,"Feline! Thank you for taking he time to respond, I actually found the deck initially from all of your appearances in the feature match. A few more questions if you don't mind :)   Are you on reset or time spiral list. Feel free to PM me in case you dnt feel comfortable telling all of reddit before you g to DC (that gives away a lot of info haha). I posted my list a bit further down in his thread and was hoping you could help me with 2 card choices. I have 2 cunning wish but really feel that 3 is ideal, probably swapping for 1 dig through time, does that sound right? Secondly, how many candles should I add in? I was thinking 2-3 tops (4 seems bad in this meta, but that's just me.   Thanks again'"
MTGLegacy,3dur82,Feline_o1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:46:02 2015 UTC,"I am not on the Solidarity  / Reset list, that was fun but it's just in the end inferior to Time Spiral High Tide. My list will likely be the same as my SCG Atlanta 2014 finish, if you have access to that. If anything changes though I can note it in here the differences.   I am definitely running 3 Cunning Wish main, especially since I don't main deck Blue Sun's Zenith (Though it always comes in games 2/3, swapping for 1 High Tide.) A Dig Through Time is probably fine, I just have a personal agenda to have the least amount of dead cards in my opening hand as possible, so I run as many Ponder/Preordain/Brainstorm/Sensei's Divining Top's as I can, in exchange however, I run 0 Meditate / Blue Sun's Zenith / Pact of Negation / Dig through Time in the maindeck. I even had 1 Dig through Time in the sideboard as a wish target at an Open earlier this year and I never Wished for the Dig through Time even once through the whole tournament. I always got Intuition into Time Spirals or could always get to a Time Spiral via my 1 billion 1 cost cantrips.   3 Candelabra's is fine, I am actually doing that myself, it was the only way I could squeeze in the 4th Preordain, I finally went down to 3 Candelabra's after all this time. Since I have Capsize in the sideboard, I only need 1 Candelabra to get infinite mana by bouncing it and replaying it, untapping my islands and then casting capsize with buyback to do it all over again. (This just requires that you have a certain number of High Tides resolved based on the number of islands in play, if you can tap all your islands and generate 12 mana, with capsize and a candelabra you can go infinite. Pay 6 for Capsize w/ buyback, 1 to cast candelabra, 4 mana to untap 4 islands, and that all costs only 11 mana, but since you tapped everything and made 12, you are +1 mana, repeat infinitely. If you have 3 islands in play and 3 High Tides resolved, that's 12 mana, if you have 4 Islands in play and have 2 High Tides resolved, that's also 12 mana, the numbers vary slightly based on the number of Islands in play, more Islands mean having to have less High Tides resolved for the combo to work for infinite mana with a candelabra, and vis versa.)  I bring in Counterbalance against most match up's, really it's probably easier to list the decks I don't bring in Counterbalance against. I don't bring it in against decks that are like 95% permanents, so not against Death and Taxes or Goblins or Dredge. Bringing in Counterbalance against miracles is something I definitely do, it draws out disruption at a minimum and even better, it can establish a soft lock against them that can really help you out.   My list will likely start from something like this, however, there is the potential for things to change as I am considering some options, but I am not concrete on them yet, and I don't want to expose that to anyone because if I do go this potential route, noone will see it coming until after DC in a few weeks: 6 Fetchlands 12 Islands 4 Ponder 4 Brainstorm 4 Preordain 4 Sensei's Divining Top 3 Cunning Wish 4 Merchant Scroll 4 Force of Will 3 Flusterstorm 4 High Tide 4 Time Spiral 3 Candelabra of Tawnos 1 Turnabout -sideboard- 1 Blue Sun's Zenith 1 Brain Freeze 1 Intuition 1 Turnabout 1 Capsize 1 Wipe Away 1 Snap 1 Rebuild 1 Flusterstorm 1 Pact of Negation 1 Surgical Extraction 4 Counterbalance"

I could see it coming with with matchups like storm, zoo, burn and the like, but what about miracles? I see value in establishing a lock before them but it also would slow our gameplay down so much."
MTGLegacy,3dur82,Sir_Laser,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:23:20 2015 UTC,"1) I will start with saying I don't expect to take down any SCGopens with high tide, I understand its not as strong as miracles or omnitell, but I really do love the combo and the wish board.   Great. The metagame is really awkward for high tide decks right now.   2) Generally speaking what are my worst matches, and what are my best?   You want to avoid smallpox decks, killing a land and forcing you to discard hurts alot. Delver can be a bat machup at first, quick clock with disruption isn't that great but when you learn the matchup becomes easier. Miracles is the worst matchup ever in my oppinion, countertop is really hard to beat. Reanimator and painted stone can also be hard matchups but generally smallpox and countertop are your worst.   3) I will post my list when I get back to my home computer, but a few general questions regarding Spiral lists vs reset. I am currently running a Time Spiral list with turnabouts and 2 cunning wishes, but honestly I am only like 40 dollars away from a reset list. Is reset stronger in the current metagame? What decks does it fair better against. Honestly it seems to me that it just becomes that much open to disruption because you can always time spiral as a top deck get a fresh 7 and go off.   Pros of playing spiral tide over reset tide are that you get to run 12-16 cantrips and you are able to start the combo with only 2 cards in hand (reset tide usually needs 3). So you are generally better off vs discard. Personally I prefer reset tide over spiral tide because of the flexibility , you can go off when a hatespell is on the stack or in response to your opponent tapping out etc etc etc. But tbh I think spiral tide is better situated in the metagame than reset tide, although I think in the end it comes down to personal preference.   4) I saw that Feline Longmore ran 4 counterbalance, 4 sensei divining top in her deceits last year. Is this still a viable side boarding option? I run a 1/3 split between preordain and sensei divining top. Top seems great when you drop it before a time spiral because seeing 10 cards rather than 7 is pretty crucial for making you not fizzle.   Countertop is a viable SB option against decks that run a lot of discard or against combo, I might be wrong here. I mainly play reset tide but tested spiral tide when I saw feline playing countertop.   5) Whats my best method for beating rest in peace? Overtime it gets dropped on me, I have to high tide, spiral, I lose all of my cantrips in the yard and pray for a cunning wish to get a bounce spell from my board. I don't play candelabra's (yet, but open to 1 or 2 if you all think they are worth), so losing a turnabout or high tide hurts.   I usually end up going for a Brain Freeze followed by a BSZ for lethal. You could also bounce the RIP. I might also consider adding more wishes.   6) I REALLY need some miracles help. I just cannot seem to get through the counters and counterbalance. I watch Joe Lossett's stream nearly nightly and still can't figure the best method for going off. Would you all say waiting for 5 lands in play and crafting a hand that has high tide, spiral, 1 hard counter (swan song) and maybe a force is best? Should I turnabout their lands and then go to second main so they don't have mana open for counterspell of the like? Are defense grids worth? In general, I would just like some matchup tips, or general side boarding strategies.   As I said, this is your worst matchup most of the time. I usually try to counter counterbalance and just stall the game. If that doesn't work you have to try to wish for a wipe away and bounce the cb and after that go off on your next turn.   7) So i know that against discard strategies (i.e. Jund) its sometimes good to put combo pieces in the board so extirpates or surgical don't take them all. I run 2 cunning wishes in the main, so should I put one turnabout and one high tide in the board, or just the high tide. 8) Lastly, for now haha, I have had slaughter games take my spirals quite often (didn't even know slaughter games in legacy was a thing tbh), but whats my best line of play for that. Whats my out? I have a BSZ mainboard so do I just need to aim for a big BSZ?   If they slaughter games your spirals you should try to go off with turnabouts and bsz targeting yourself for more untap efects and Brain Freeze + BSZ them out eventually, or just BSZ. I usually end up boarding out a single high tide if my opponent plays surgical / extirpate / slaughter games. I think your list needs the 3rd wish atleast.   hope this helps, sorry for bad englando. I'm not a native speaker.   Edit: Formating"
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,KangaRod,6,Sun Jul 19 18:53:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe reduce the entry fee to $5 and pay out to the top half. I know it's not a terribly big difference in price, but new players who are wary about getting crushed in a format they don't know would feel better throwing away 5 instead of $10. Also if you pay out to the top half all people have to do is perform decent in order to get a little credit. Your payout system seems very skewed towards the top as it is. Besides that maybe change the time of the event. IMO evening times like 6 or 7 PM get the biggest turnouts because a lot of people work during the day even on weekends."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,Cowcrusader,0,Sun Jul 19 20:09:30 2015 UTC,"Its worth noting that the top 3 usually was halfish of the event. I would say that we at most would have 10 or 12 players, normally 8 or less.  Also, this is Canadian Dollars so its more like $7.50 or so. Basically its a meal at McDonalds. I don't feel like $10 is an unreasonable amount of money to charge for an afternoon of entertainment."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,Iysk225,2,Mon Jul 20 00:23:18 2015 UTC,"The issue isn't the price of the tourney but to get into legacy itself is something that's difficult. At my LGS what they are doing is that its a 5$CAD entry OR spend 10$ in the store but only 50% of the entry is paid out the rest actually goes towards the store and they offer free drinks and snacks between rounds. its seen less of a touny where people come to win but more of a place to hang out and play legacy but with a small prize as an incentive, then again going 2-1 pays the entry"
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,Noxwalrus,6,Tue Jul 21 06:51:25 2015 UTC,"I've found the easiest way to get people to pick up legacy is to play with them. I have two decks built up and always ask people to play a game or two between draft or standard rounds at FNM. I ALWAYS have my decks on me, and after a month or two I have people waiting around till I finish my match so we can play some legacy. I always offer to lend my spare deck out for our bi-weekly legacy tourneys as well. Once people play the format and see how awesome it is they almost always want to buy/borrow/proxy a deck to play as much as they can."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,slack,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:43:30 2015 UTC,"Great idea, kind of where we were going with having decks prebuilt at the store."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,Noxwalrus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:24:09 2015 UTC,"What decks do you use for this?  I can build a lot of different stuff, but the decks I have together now don't necessarily make for the most interesting games for new players.  Either the decks are relatively complex and unforgiving (Legend Miracles, Storm) or simply don't make for long, interactive games when pitted against each other.  I hate just giving new players Affinity or Burn to try out because, while those decks can win I feel like they aren't actually experiencing what the format has to offer."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,rifter5000,2,Mon Jul 20 02:05:49 2015 UTC,"My main deck is storm which doesn't make for the best games all the time. My secondary deck is grixis delver, so if they want to play storm they have a chance. Then I proxied up a punishing BUG list that my buddy likes to play. Punishing fire is great vs the small creatures of grixis, but anglers and tnn give grixis a chance. Over-all the games between those decks are usually really fun.  Edit: To add, I think storm is actually a pretty great deck to introduce people to legacy with as long as you're the one piloting it so they don't stumble about. The combination of discard and force from grixis (and surgical + more discard post board) gives the deck a good fighting chance, and delver puts on a great clock. Also, players new to the format are always interested in how storm functions and those first few combo kills kinda blow their mind in regards to the intricacy and power level of the format. When I'm teaching them the format I do usually go a little easy some times. Keeping hands that are like 4 lands, probe, brainstorm, dr might not be great but I'll keep them cause they function and gives the new players a shot at putting on some aggression."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,rifter5000,4,Mon Jul 20 02:47:58 2015 UTC,"Honestly 15 proxies is HUGE. 25 is just ridiculous. We play 30-proxy vintage where I'm from in addition to proper Legacy, and that's a MUCH less accessible format.   Setting up weekly cube events, playing with others at draft and talking about Legacy in those events, that's how you get people interested. Not just saying ""Legacy event on Sunday, 15 proxies"". That sounds to most new players like something they couldn't possibly do, way too advanced. But if you actually offer to play Legacy with people outside a tournament setting, they'll love it."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,rumballtron,0,Mon Jul 20 02:58:28 2015 UTC,"This is kind of the conclusion I am making as well.   I currently have Temur Delver together, but am thinking of working towards putting a second deck together so that I can say hey, here you go and me and someone can just jam a few games.   I'm leaning towards stoneblade as being a second deck that wont be too difficult for newer players to grasp, or they could grab my temur delver deck.   Is there a ""most accessible, easiest to play deck"" that you guys would recommend having on hand to show off the fun that can be had?"
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,socratoast,2,Mon Jul 20 04:49:49 2015 UTC,"I currently have Temur Delver together, but am thinking of working towards putting a second deck together so that I can say hey, here you go and me and someone can just jam a few games.   Making a second deck is awesome. Seeing the new Avaricious Dragon printed, I'm leaning pretty heavily towards Dragon Stompy as my secondary deck, when my last dual land arrives for RUG Delver.   I'm leaning towards stoneblade as being a second deck that wont be too difficult for newer players to grasp, or they could grab my temur delver deck.   Stoneblade is definitely one of the most 'normal' decks in Legacy. Unlike some decks (RUG Delver, where you have to understand that 2-for-1ing yourself for tempo is sometimes okay and that both players having no lands is a good thing; Storm, where you have to understand some fairly complex lines of play before you can even pick it up and goldfish with it; etc.), it pretty much plays a normal game of Magic.  BGx decks in general are pretty good this way too. Shardless BUG is one that new players seem to love a lot. People take a rather disturbing delight in Shardless Agent into Hymn. Shardless BUG is most definitely not a cheap deck though, in fact it's probably the most expensive good deck in Legacy.  Cheerios or something similarly stupid is always a good one to show people, if only to show people how ridiculous Legacy can be sometimes.   But yeah, Stoneblade is definitely one of those decks that plays a pretty normal and approachable game of Legacy. You have removal, countermagic and threats and a midrange/control angle that seems to be very attractive to people new to Legacy in my experience."
MTGLegacy,3duyfy,ashent2,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:56:05 2015 UTC,"I'd say have the store print proxies to build a ton of legacy decks, and call it ""learning legacy"" where players can jsut pick up a prebuilt and basically play duel deck matchups where they get a chance for back and forth, but also to have access to a deck with a maybeboard of proxies so they can choose a version of it or make some substitutions of cards.    you could run a little get started session with some coaching from the legacy guys and then run your tournament right after so the newbs get to take stuff for a spin"

See if your time slot is hindering attendance.  Look around for an existing legacy playgroup in your area on facebook. If you can't find one, make one and then mention it on the local magic groups (and here, of course.)  Encourage your friends to come and play with you even if the ""event"" doesn't fire.

MTGLegacy,3dtvmg,IsrengBelemy,18,Sun Jul 19 12:25:57 2015 UTC,"All this talk of the banned and restricted list changes   There's this amount of talk, often more, about B&R changes every 3 months.    have been getting me thinking that maybe the problem lies not in removing things to balance the format how it once was   There isn't a problem, though. Legacy's metagame is pretty healthy. Bans don't happen because one deck is currently the most popular or best deck. This isn't Modern and it hasn't even been Modern, where they continually ban cards to 'shake things up', because Legacy isn't a Pro Tour format.  Modern shouldn't be a PT format either, for the same reason: formats that aren't seriously shaken up by every new set release are not good Pro Tour formats.  In addition, blue being dominant in Legacy is neither bad nor new. It's just how Legacy works. Blue is the most popular colour, but it's not unbeatable. Non-blue decks are completely viable, they're just generally less popular for whatever reason. Lands, for example, beats a lot of fair decks extremely proficiently, as does Jund. In combo-heavy metagames they don't do well, in fair-heavy metagames they do.   The idea that colour balance is a good thing is an inherently bad one, IMO.   but to print cards specifically designed for legacy to makes other colours more valuable and move legacy forward to a new balance.   The other colours are valuable already. And Legacy is already balanced. It's not colour-balanced, because colour balance is completely irrelevant. Lots and lots and lots of people like the current standard format despite it being incredibly green-dominated, even more so than Legacy. Even standard red aggro splashes green. That's not a bad thing, the fact that there's no archetype balance in Standard is what is flawed about it, IMO.  Look at Modern, where despite there being rough colour balance (probably the best colour balance of all constructed formats at the moment), the format is incredibly poorly balanced, with almost everyone agreeing that the only way to win is to play linear decks.   I think that would make the game quite interesting to play and to watch.   On the contrary, I think that printing cheap (because let's face it, 'designed for legacy' usually means 'undercosted') strategy-targetted hate cards would make the format more like Modern, where many many matchups are decided by whoever draws their silver-bullet cards. That's not enjoyable to watch, at all. Modern can be interesting to watch, but that's in spite of the silver bullet sideboards, not because of it.  Legacy is already interesting to watch, and it's already interesting to play. ""I win because I drew this card that costs 2 mana and completely invalidates your deck"" is not interesting to play, interesting to watch being played, or interesting to play against."

I guess you're right about the silver bullet thing, and to be honest with you I should have picked it up myself as one of the things I hate most about modern is it's absurd deck match ups and how because there isn't a lot of more general hate (like force of will is in this format) the sideboard cards are mostly extremely specific and win games by themselves."

Twin is just as happy playing a fair game of magic, using the threat of the combo as means to keep opponents from using mana efficiently. Knowing when to switch between the fair creature beatdown + Snap Bolt gameplan and the combo gameplan is one of the most important aspects of playing the deck.  If Twin is a linear deck then I honestly don't know what deck wouldn't be considered linear."
MTGLegacy,3dtvmg,Timiniel,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:25:23 2015 UTC,"I am aware of how twin plays. Before I stopped playing modern, that was my deck. The issue of linearity vs nonlinearity is how to attack the strategy. You can disrupt the combo in the same way that you can stop pestermite beats, frankly. That's why I still see it as a linear strategy.  A non linear deck would be one that would show the necessity to have different types of hate to stop all avenues of attack from it... Say, painter in legacy, for example. Or hell, doomsday ^_^"

MTGLegacy,3dtvmg,rifter5000,-4,Mon Jul 20 15:05:20 2015 UTC,"If you knew anything about modern you'd know that Twin is a tempo deck that has a combo in it. The threat of the combo is used as a form of mana denial, and it gets sided out fairly often.   That's completely untrue. Twin is a combo deck first and foremost. It can delay the game until it combos off, it can even use a transformational sideboard into a tempo deck, but it is a combo deck.    Jund has been back on top since people realized that Kolaghan's Command is insane.   No it hasn't. Is it a top tier deck? Sure. Is it the best deck, or anywhere near the best deck? No, it isn't.    But please, don't let facts or anything get in the way of your modern sucks circlejerk.   I didn't say that, retard, I said that it was a format full of very linear decks and sideboards full of very linear silver bullets."

All the best decks in the format with the exception of Jund, then.   Again, Twin isn't a linear deck. It has two distinct methods of attack and knowing when to switch between the two is one of the most important aspects of playing it. It can, and does, play a fair tempo/control oriented game. It can also just combo off on turn 4. Both of those gameplans are vital to the deck. How is that linear?  Now, given that Twin isn't a linear deck, as I pointed out before 4 out of 7 of the decks listed as tier 1 on the ModernNexus aren't linear.   The whole thread is about sideboard silver bullets.   Let's look at how this all developed. I responded to   with almost everyone agreeing that the only way to win is to play linear decks.   with   Except that the best decks in the format aren't linear.   which is, admittedly, not the most informative or helpful comment.

It's an important part of the game, but the 2 things that make blue dominant aren't things for which hate is a great solution: 1) Card draw 2) Generic answers: counterspells    Wizards has been fiddling around trying to make blue more like other colors in standard, which has led to shit like Delver, but in general I don't think adding countermagic to other colors is a great answer. Card draw is secondary in Red, so I think a decent card draw spell in red would be a solid improvement. Wizards has thus far been reluctant to print one though...

MTGLegacy,3dqq5d,Cowcrusader,3,Sun Jul 19 01:57:24 2015 UTC,"Hi Cowcrusader, from my experience the MUD vs. Miracles matchup plays out 2 different ways - resolved Chalice or Trinisphere on turns 1 or 2 or no resolved Chalice or Trinisphere turns 1 or 2.  MUD is hugely favored if they can get one of these cards down early, and otherwise Miracles is the favorite.  I think because of this, the matchup is pretty high variance.  The number of Wear/Tears in the Miracles player's SB also significantly affects post-SB game percentages.  Overall, if I'm the Miracles player I don't want to play against MUD."

I had been assembling my Painter's Servant / Grindstone combo between the board and my hand while locking things down, and my Jeskai opponent had only really played a few unthreatening creatures. It looked like I would dump his whole deck into his graveyard before he would kill me on damage, and I had won game 1 so seen his whole deck anyway and nothing jumped out. To be honest it had looked like a collection of ""good Legacy cards I own"" (Blood Moons, Chalice of the Voids, Lightning Bolts, Swords to Plowshares, some creatures like maybe Stoneforge Mystic, Goblin Rabblemaster, or something). Nothing to be afraid of.  So he casts Final Fortune, and I do a bit of Math and calculate that he must have a load of burn in his hand because his creatures alone certainly won't kill me on the extra turn, and after that he just loses the game, right?  He takes the extra turn, gets in for some more damage, and casts Day's Undoing. Now he's completely restocked his hand, he's NOT lost the game to the Final Fortune trigger, and I'm only one more attack phase from death. Worst of all, I've had to shuffle my own hand away and draw a fresh seven, which don't have the pieces in that I'd been carefully putting together.  So I lost that game.  I feel like there's potential for this Final Fortune // Day's Undoing value combo. The tempo swing certainly turned that game sharply against me."

MTGLegacy,3dndof,Apocrypha,4,Fri Jul 17 19:23:40 2015 UTC,Reset high tide isn't running quicken yet and it already has bad instant speed cantrips. Quicken into Spiral Tide would be better because it untaps your lands.
MTGLegacy,3dndof,Dutchling,2,Fri Jul 17 19:48:07 2015 UTC,"ohh, does it run Opt? please tell me it run Opt"
MTGLegacy,3dndof,syntaxr,2,Sat Jul 18 02:42:50 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think it plays Opt and Impulse."
MTGLegacy,3dndof,Apocrypha,2,Sat Jul 18 02:56:39 2015 UTC,"Opt, impulse, dig through times, meditate."
MTGLegacy,3dndof,cincyfire35,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:57:59 2015 UTC,"I have been playing 2 of them in UR delver (the burn variant) and it has been pretty good, but not game breaking. It is a very good ""refuel your hand with more burn spells"" card, and plays better with snapcaster than dig through time does."
MTGLegacy,3dndof,joshwarmonks,3,Fri Jul 17 21:25:08 2015 UTC,i think delver is the best place for undoing in legacy
MTGLegacy,3dndof,rifter5000,-1,Fri Jul 17 22:02:23 2015 UTC,Jesus fuck that deck so much. If it's even remotely viable with day's undoing that card should be banned.
MTGLegacy,3dndof,nebetsu,2,Mon Jul 20 03:49:01 2015 UTC,Could you post a list? I love UR delver-burn

MTGLegacy,3dndof,Cloud-Jumper,0,Sat Jul 18 08:35:42 2015 UTC,I'll likely be testing in modern this week
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,twndomn,25,Fri Jul 17 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"Sounds like these guys miss being able to do Legacy commentary on the regular. I can't imagine watching 2 days of Standard every weekend is very entertaining. Hell, I know I'm not entertained by watching Standard every damn weekend, so I don't watch SCG (well, ok, I do watch Legacy when it is on once every six months.) and I don't buy anything from them anymore."

MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,KangaRod,7,Sat Jul 18 08:58:39 2015 UTC,"even before i started playing legacy, just watching legacy is so much better.  standard is horribly boring to watch, and modern has too many degenerate matchups that are 95/5.  oh, and i'm not counting miracles, as that's pretty boring to watch too."
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,unstoppable-force,4,Fri Jul 17 23:05:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair, if I were to turn 1 blind cabal therapy a miracles player, then I would name sdt 95% of the time. The other 5% being when I have a turn 2 kill and need to name FoW to protect it."
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Noxwalrus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:32:09 2015 UTC,"As Grixis Delver I understand that, but as ANT you would do that as well? I feel like its wrong to not name Counterbalance unless you have abrupt decay in hand (or, like you said you are protecting your t2 kill)."
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Therefrigerator,2,Sat Jul 18 22:11:06 2015 UTC,"Counterbalance is pretty lame without top. The fact that top let's them dig for FoW and whatever other sb countermagic they have is pretty bad. You can easily test counterbalance by just casting a cantrip and seeing what they flip, but if they find RiP or a force you need to dig for specific cards to fight it."
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Noxwalrus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:14:26 2015 UTC,"I rarely have extra mana up the first few turns which is when storm really needs to try and go off against miracles anyways. Yea it can help smooth out bad draws but allowing my brainstorm to turn into a one-sided chalice of the void for a turn on a number of my choice seems far worse for you. Especially since you need some combination of 0, 1 and 2 mana spells to go off (usually, not always of course) counterbalance seems like a far bigger threat."
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Therefrigerator,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:34:06 2015 UTC,Eh not really. I haven't found counterbalance that difficult without a top in play. I play the slower grinding station build any way. Storm can plow through counters pretty well. And abrupt decay is an amazing card if it's needed.
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Noxwalrus,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:36:25 2015 UTC,"Right, that's what I'm saying is that storm can plow through counters pretty well. Storm has a tough time with permanent hate more than anything. That's why MUD is a rough matchup for you as they just start playing hate t1 until they win. If you snag the counterbalance all you have to worry about is the counterspells which is something that you can beat."

MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Pheyniex,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:34:36 2015 UTC,"More specifically, banning top would seriously hurt card selection in non-blue decks.

MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,TheDarkRainbow,2,Mon Jul 20 13:47:41 2015 UTC,When someone forces my turn 1 top it feels like I've already lost. ;)
MTGLegacy,3dn5y2,Nolii,2,Sat Jul 18 15:15:33 2015 UTC,"are u kidding? u should thank your opponent, now u are clear to land turn 2 CB, and then just brainstorm to find another SDT for the lock."

MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,onethreefour,17,Fri Jul 17 16:10:39 2015 UTC,"I put a 1-of Liliana into BUG pod nic fit. I reaaaaally like it. I can flip her pretty much immediately, and get a body and then either regen something like Veteran explorer or Baleful strix, or uptick to discard. (I play with no hand pretty often so that's not usually a huge downside) And if someone lets me ult that? Ooooh  man.   Edit: and being able to pod her makes the one-of pretty easy to find. I didn't have a great three-drop base in that deck anyways."
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,alomomola,4,Fri Jul 17 16:39:20 2015 UTC,do you have a list?
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,SanctuarySC2,13,Fri Jul 17 21:43:16 2015 UTC,"I might try Lily in Esper/Grixis control. The sequence of t1-therapy away their countermagic/removal, t2-baleful strix, t3-lily + sac strix to flashback therapy and flip lily and then reanimate the strix seems like a sweet value play. The fact that she can reanimate fallen pyromancers/mentors is just graaavy."

MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,firebadmattgood,4,Fri Jul 17 18:05:01 2015 UTC,Are you planning to run Jace in the main deck? seems sketch.
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,yung_wolf,2,Fri Jul 17 17:07:36 2015 UTC,"I'm aware it seems sketch... but that's the point of testing, right?    He filters your hand, fuels dig, and might be able to cast back a countered Show and Tell. I think he would have to be, maybe, a 2-of in the sideboard. In the maindeck he would just turn on my opponents Abrupt Decays/Bolts/STPs/etc."

Having three power is cool though."
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,10leej,-1,Fri Jul 17 19:02:35 2015 UTC,"That looks almost like a tendrils of agony too me.  Turbo elves are already basically combo, so MAYBE instead of craterhoofing for obscene damage, you can cap an explosive elf opening with a CoCo, if it hit two, then that'd be pretty sweet.  Just saying."
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,ajanivengeant,2,Fri Jul 17 18:29:14 2015 UTC,"Flip Jace had my attention, but now it has my interest.  I getting a good tempo value vibe from him.  He has the right cost, the right ability, and at least one of the right plainwalkers abilities.  One thing, I think he has a huge red target painted on his head for removal.  I've got this storm deck on the drawing board that might see sleeves, I need to do some more thinking."
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,lar55on,2,Fri Jul 17 18:19:49 2015 UTC,I kinda wanna try Kytheon/Gideon in my soldier stompy
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,ajanivengeant,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:13:32 2015 UTC,Wouldn't you have trouble casting it because of Chalice of the Void? Do you think you would be able to cast it often enough for it to be worth it?
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,10leej,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:50 2015 UTC,It can still be cast by cavern of soul or vialed in if you're running vials
MTGLegacy,3dmyx7,pyrogny,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:55:21 2015 UTC,I know about Cavern of souls I was wondering if Cavern of Souls would show up reliably enough with Chalice of the Void for it to be worth it in the first place.  I'm pretty sure AEther vial is too slow for a stompy deck running Ancient Tomb City of Traitors and Chrome Mox. It also catches itself to Chalice of the Void with no workaround whatsoever unlike with Kytheon.

MTGLegacy,3dld1n,rightseid,2,Fri Jul 17 19:49:11 2015 UTC,"I can get FNM Duresses, for maximum ugly.   That said, the Therapies were one of the last things I picked up. By that point, most of the deck was in new borders, so I just decided to match them. JDG Therapies are way sweeter, but I had to make the call there. If Past in Flames and Tarn came in the old border, I'd be working towards old border cards.  Sadly, I'd still need to run disgusting Lotus Petals."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,Skuloth,5,Fri Jul 17 16:31:17 2015 UTC,You know you love the FTV weird ass foil.  I wish there was a different style foil for lotus petals for my reanimator deck.

MTGLegacy,3dld1n,TaonasSagara,0,Fri Jul 17 15:59:54 2015 UTC,Nah. Merc Masques or CNS. Ice age is worst brainstorm.
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,150crawfish,5,Fri Jul 17 16:23:44 2015 UTC,Mercadian Masques are the only brainstorms.
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,onethreefour,2,Fri Jul 17 17:51:15 2015 UTC,Ice age brainstorm is the best
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,OneWithNothing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:46:37 2015 UTC,You're not alone. I love the ice age brainstorm and everyone in my local meta hates it. I saw a guy who customizes them to look full art. I'm thinking about having my set done.
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,OneWithNothing,3,Fri Jul 17 22:14:39 2015 UTC,I'm working to foil my reanimator deck and have been having a back and forth with which brainstorm to use. I just can't seem to like the mercadian masque version.  These CNS versions look nice.
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,Noxwalrus,3,Fri Jul 17 10:16:36 2015 UTC,"I wish there was a foil with the ice age art for brainstorm. But alas, I've settled on MMQ ones for my deck.  And something about the old style foils just makes the card pop. I like the new foils, but the old ones just catch my eye sometimes."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,Noxwalrus,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:58:54 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly, but so much of the core of the deck doesn't have old borders, and I'm a sucker for similarity."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,OneWithNothing,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:03:24 2015 UTC,"Continuity is FAR more important IMO than the most ""pimp"" card. Which is why old border art in my deck have signatures and new border is foil. Ice Age brainstorm should really be a foil."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,OneWithNothing,2,Fri Jul 17 20:37:21 2015 UTC,Use the art that you like. Don't listen to these people. It's your deck.

As a ANT player with dreams of foiling the deck, but too many other varied interests, I wish to help you finish your deck by mailing you the foil Past in Flames I have for freesies.

MTGLegacy,3dld1n,henryponco,14,Fri Jul 17 08:24:08 2015 UTC,"Aww, man, you don't have to do that.  Especially considering that my other one is in the mail as we speak! Once it arrives (sometime next week), I'll be updating this."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,RacquetReborn,7,Fri Jul 17 08:56:47 2015 UTC,"Congratulations, friend! Though the way new storm abstracts are going with Dark Petition, you'll need one more Past in Flames soon!"
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,pauljmichel,3,Fri Jul 17 11:06:53 2015 UTC,"That's fine lol. Dark Petition intrigues me, but man, Spell Pierce is an utter blowout against that card."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,pauljmichel,2,Fri Jul 17 15:56:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I've been testing more big mana with 2-3 seething song. It helps fix red mana if you don't have an LED to go off with and generates a decent amount to help dodge soft counters. Also, I think it's been a mistake of some to cut LED. Even with FoW, the card is super powerful and you can always just not crack the LED to keep force up, unlike with IT."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,motorcityguitarist,2,Fri Jul 17 18:48:32 2015 UTC,Seething Song? That's spicy.
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,pauljmichel,2,Fri Jul 17 19:50:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I found the biggest problem was mana. Since you're all ready to go off as soon as you get a DP, you often don't bother keeping LED and stuff while digging. You also can't do shit just going CR into DP, so you need to have at least 7+ mana to start going off. It also helps build up mana if you don't have threshold. I am also considering cutting petals as they don't add to instant/sorc count."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,RacquetReborn,2,Fri Jul 17 20:54:52 2015 UTC,"But Spell Pierce isn't seeing as much play right now. It's either become mainboard Pyroblast(s) or Flusterstorm. The former of which is great for us, the latter of which, well, we're probably losing anyway."
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,TheScynic,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:25:33 2015 UTC,That's a valid point. I just have this crippling fear of getting my otherwise sweet hand blown away by them having a clutch Brainstorm -> Force or what have you. I'm still testing the card though.
MTGLegacy,3dld1n,rifter5000,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:49:51 2015 UTC,"That's part of the beauty too, extra copies of Past in Flames add an extra layer of resiliency to the deck. If you ever wanna talk shop about storm, PM me. I love talking about it."

Then the next answer is getting rid of a Cavern of Souls.  In this match up the best Sideboard cards to bring in are Sulver Elemental, rough//tumble only for the rough, and Null Rod to stop their equipment.  I think Keeping Stifle in for games 2/3 is a good idea as it can stop Aether vial it can turn a SFM into a Squire, and works to get rid of Mother of Runes/Karakas-thalia bounce."

MTGLegacy,3dmfh9,Toranyan,2,Sat Jul 18 12:56:23 2015 UTC,"Fair decks make for longer, grindier games so you need 2 things : card advantage and inevitability.   Board out Force of Wills for removal/more specific counterspells. While there will still be games where you can just plop a delver t1 and just stifle/waste daze/force all their plays, fair decks are fairly resilient to this strategy. Quite a few cards can become dead depending on the deck/playing on the draw, so you need to figure which ones those are and bring in cards that aren't dead. Daze on the play is still fine and stifle is still pretty useful outside of stifling fetches, but in general you want to answer their threats with sweepers or spot removal and just lay down hard to deal with threats like Tarmogoyf and...  True Name Nemesis. After the dust settles and your hands are spent, slapping this guy down is often just game over. It's very near impossible to deal with this guy outside of the stack. This is usually all the inevitability you need against fair decks and the mirror."

I think the card is boring and the combos don't interest me from a gameplay standpoint.  But, the fact is that the card is fine.  The decks that play it are powerful, but they don't dominate and they do have answers.  Would I prefer a format without Show and Tell?  No.  I personally only play it as an alternate piece in Reanimator so the loss wouldn't matter that much.  The fact that the card is legal demonstrates that WotC would rather leave legacy players to solve balance issues in the format.  This keeps things interesting and challenging.  The card is boring, but beatable.  Some people like that kind of game.  Let them keep playing it."

My viewpoint, or the one I pushed forward when writing, was to surmise that while Show and Tell is not a card to be banned on power level, it is one on enjoyment by stifling maybe other interesting archetypes from existing. A viewpoint, which I admit, may be completely incorrect as it is quite speculative."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,5028,3,Sun Jul 19 12:41:57 2015 UTC,"I think Omnitell in its current form should probably go for the health of the format, not because it's dominating the format, but because of how it's dominating its general archetype. It is without a question the most resilient combo you can be playing, because the answers to it are so incredibly narrow. Once it resolves, it can often win on the stack, and in reaction to the next answer on the stack again, making the effective answers against it a very small and specific group of cards.  I'm not going to say it has no natural enemies, it does, but it actively removes from the intricacy of Legacy instead of adding to it, given the much wider range of ""next best things"" that would be left in it's place.  I am entirely for banning either Show and Tell or Omniscience, just because Omnitell I think does significantly homogenize the format for no real benefit.  That being said, I'm marching in the street about it, I'm just responding since the article brought it up (and I can't vote without Facebook, apparently)."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,bmemike,2,Sat Jul 18 03:41:27 2015 UTC,"Getting rid of Omniscience is interesting but is a banning angle more reserved to Modern, where you remove the most efficient pieces but try to keep archetypes alive where possible (and when not, you have Birthing Pod).  You otherwise pushed the point I had in the article so won't comment further :)"
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,dripdropdiet,4,Sun Jul 19 12:44:31 2015 UTC,"Legacy is a turn 3 format. Show and Tell decks, by and large, adheres to that notion.  Yes, there are ways to speed it up (sol lands, petal, etc), but there are ways to speed up Modern decks faster than the T4 target. This explosiveness usually comes at the expense of resilience and isn't usually conducive when talking about the fundamental turn of a deck, so I'm going to largely ignore it for now. Speed at the cost of becoming more fragile isn't super helpful and not necessarily a net gain.  Sneak & Show is obviously slower than Omnitell, but it's a 2-card combo (and you have 8 effective copies of each combo piece). Omnitell requires 3 cards though, so the likelihood of having everything on T3 is much lower and there are far more points at which you can interrupt the combo. So Omnitell is closer to breaking the turn 3 target, but requires more to get there and often more turns to ensure counters to push through the combo (while often being under pressure).  At the end of the day, some things are going to be at the high end of the power level for every format. Show and Tell is one of those cards for Legacy. There's nothing wrong with being at the top and it doesn't mean we need to get rid of it. Show and Tell is fine and I honestly think it should remain a part of the Legacy meta."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,cincyfire35,5,Fri Jul 17 19:33:26 2015 UTC,"Right. Legacy is a turn 3 format. At the risk of coming off as a Troll… if you don’t like it, play Modern or Standard. They’re sculpted by WOTC to be more balanced formats.  As a tangent, I also believe that Legacy is also a blue format because blue's pieces of the color pie are the most powerful pieces. Drawing cards and saying ""no"" are the most powerful things you can do in Magic if you want to consistently win over time.   For example, a player attempts to go off with belcher/reanimator turn one on the play. Blue gives you access to FOW to say “no, you can’t win right now,” even though you haven’t even played a land yet. That is very powerful, but FOW should not be banned.  Or, look at card selection over the first three turns. Without “the blue core,” (assuming no mulligans) by turn three you should have seen a total of 9 cards on the play (7+1+1), or 10 cards on the draw (7+1+1+1). With “the blue core,” on the play you can see 18 cards on the play (7+3+4+4), or 19 cards on the draw (7+4+4+4). Over time, the person who gets to see more cards, and select their best cards out of a larger sample of cards, will win games.  I don’t want the blue core banned because I think it leads to more interesting/skill intensive games.   Finally, instead of calling for popular/powerful cards to be banned, why don’t you spend your time coming up with innovative new decks?  OK, got that off my chest… troll going back to his cave."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,bmemike,3,Fri Jul 17 21:50:33 2015 UTC,"Sneak and show is considerably faster than omnitell. Omnitell doesnt run as many sol lands, doesnt run lotus petals for the most  part, and by its nature it tries to durdle and cantrip until it can go off  with complete backup. Sneak and show just tries to go off asap, with an added bonus if it has protection. Omni, as you said, tries to assemble 3 cards, and uses cantrips such as preordain to get there. Omni is stronger because its much more resilient to hate. Sneak has a horrible death and taxes matchup, where omni is somewhere around 55/45. This, plus a stronger miracles matchup as well as a better matchup against wasteland and hatebear decks means that omni is able to just power through the current meta if hate isnt overwhelming, where sneak and show could be hated out by the maindeck alone. Omnitells worst matchups are decks like reanimator and dredge, and those decks were hated out of the top tables a while before. Hence, omni is an all around stronger choice for the show and tell plan due to resilience and unmatched consistency, not speed."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,Apocolyps6,0,Fri Jul 17 21:37:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to disagree with the analysis, I was just look at the two S&T decks side-by-side irrespective of meta and play style (spending time cantripping, building up a hand, playing control, etc).   Sneak & Show requires more turns to go off with optimal draws. Either by way of S&T'ing a dude and waiting a turn to swing or landing a SA and needing mana to activate.   Omni just needs the flat 3 mana for S&T to go off.   I think we're both correct - I just wanted to clarify the basis for my assessments."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,Kaono,2,Fri Jul 17 22:18:26 2015 UTC,"In practice (goldfish or not) S&S is faster. It is a matter of collecting 2 8ofs rather than collecting 2 ~4ofs plus some other stuff.  The mana base reflects this and many of S&S's hands can play a T1 emrakul.  In terms of winning on the spot S&S also has that option, just not at the same speed. If you Sneak in a Grizzlebrand you get to see 14 more cards to try to find lotus petal + emrakul.   So S&S is faster with optimal draws and faster on average."
MTGLegacy,3dnfxs,Anachronan,1 point,Sat Jul 18 10:07:27 2015 UTC,"Omnitell requires 3 cards though, so the likelihood of having everything on T3 is much lower and there are far more points at which you can interrupt the combo.   That's not entirely a fair comparison, though, as the only real important cards for Omnitell are its namesakes, Show & Tell and Omniscience.  If you've got both on T3, then unless you've got literally land or counters in hand you have a very high percentage of cantriping into a CWish or Dig to win on the spot."

MTGLegacy,3dn6qp,DemonicSnow,4,Fri Jul 17 17:09:43 2015 UTC,"i've played prosbloom in legacy!  i brought it once or twice as kind of a gag. it's an amusing deck.   I figured the deck would immediately drop Prosperity in terms of using Minds Aglow, as you pay the mana when it resolves so you won't be sunk after a counter spell.   old school ran [[city of solitude]] to prevent counters. the problem with [[minds aglow]] though is that your opponent can potentially mess you up. if you're going to draw 35 cards, for instance, and your library has 36 cards in it, he just has to pay two mana, and the game's a draw.   I guess my real question is how should I fill out the land base with this,   well, you need basics for [[natural balance]], or there's no point in running it. i ran i think three of each, forest, swamp, island. from there [[undiscovered paradise]] is a classic choice, because it comes back to your hand, and is potentially worth two mana in hand. [[gemstone mines]] is another standard, i ran four of each. one [[city of brass]] for old time's sake.   Lastly, I was thinking of running Manamorphose as a way to get the blue/red needed to keep the cost down.   i like [[lotus petals]] because you can also use them to accelerate in the early game.   as well as do I run Drain life or upgrade to something like Banefire?    i mean, banefire is better. but i think half the fun of the deck is risky win-cons. sort of, what one or two really expensive things can you drop and win the game. i recently lost a multiplayer game with my now less-than-legal version of it for casual multiplayer, because i drew down to one card left in the library, dropped emrakul, dropped [[iron maiden]], passed back to myself, drew my last card, and neglected to attack. my opponent basically won the game with a damage prevention effect."

MTGLegacy,3dky49,Magnaguard100,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:29:04 2015 UTC,"Ah, the recruiter dilemma is real, I play on cockatrice and borrow a playset when in paper.  the extra oracle is huge against pox-strategy denial, as it can completely neuter a smallpox if it procs a land.  It also has a slight benefit when chaining with Cavern Harpy, as it generate mana when digging for the combo in case you pull a Brainstorm, of which I run 4 of course.  I have 1 DTT in the sideboard for grindy matches like Loam, but I find that my graveyard does not fill enough to fuel more. the added cantrips probably help you in that regard.  I could see Kataki for MUD; I run Null Rod in the side, but I personally haven't had a lot of experience against the deck.  If Empty the Warrens or Young Pyromancer are nearby, Pontiff is the best pull, and Minister of Pain is the best if you cut white.  As long as you're in white, Brago from Conspiracy is a decent test. He dodges Bolt and Decay, blocks Delver, and his ability can generate large card advantage while giving him pseudo vigilance. I have a copy for if I dive back into white, but there's have to be a wonderful new printing for that splash to be a thing.  Also, I recommend testing Shardless Agent. I run 2 main for value and it's the best pre-combo recruiter target unless you're 100% safe on landing and keeping an Edric, of which I run 1 in case I ever want to Ancestral Recall on a 2/2. Both of these cards are also good for the Blue count for Force."

MTGLegacy,3dktj3,calexil,3,Fri Jul 17 02:11:52 2015 UTC,"Okay, say you put it in an ANT list for example - you're not really losing that much tempo. Given that you don't have a god-hand and can win on turn 1, maybe turn 2, your first couple of turns are setting up anyways. If you have it in your opener, you can search for either of which you need between protection (CT) or action (IT). Admittedly, it won't help you in the scenario that you need mana in rituals, but that's the least likely of the three to happen. This is the only real weakness I see in it.  I believe it being a sorcery is also slightly irrelevant here in this situation due to you 95% of the time going off on your own main phase (I have EOT'd ritualed into AN before, but it's a corner case enough that I would consider that irrelevant). Yes, the spells you can search for are restricted, but they're powerful enough to your gameplan that I wouldn't consider it to be too awful.  If I were to replace anything it would more than likely be a Preordain as it's the weakest cantrip of the four and most often cut for other cards already.  Of course, I can very well be completely wrong on all parts but I do enjoy discussing them."

I would much rather be drawing a NO, GSZ, or glimpse than this in most cases. For sideboard and flex use, it doesn't do enough against decks that Elves needs help with.  Another issue is that many decks that use brainstorm also have FOW, so tapped out doesn't meat you're safe.

Unfortunately, that would make the format's control decks even better, because they wouldn't need force of will to two for one themselves and could be even more value packed. I really just think there are too many good cards in legacy for a straight aggro based creature deck to be good."

I think that Terminus and Miracles as a whole with it's insane popularity is the reason that non-blue aggro cannot exist. That being said, I would put combo a close runner up. With terminus gone Zoo would at least be played just because it can potentially kill combo decks before they go off. There was always combo back when Zoo was a highly played deck, and it's always been a bad matchup."

There was always combo back when Zoo was a highly played deck, and it's always been a bad matchup.   Yeah but it didn't have Past in Flames or Omniscience or Griselbrand. It didn't just win on the spot with Show and Tell, it put a big fatty on the field and attacked you. Aggro decks can Path a Sphinx of the Steel Wind and kill you with creatures. They can't do that when you kill them with dumb Release the Ants bullshit off Omniscience. I've had opponents play literally four Digs in a row in response to Ashen Rider's trigger, for fuck's sake.   Past in Flames makes you life total almost irrelevant in a storm deck. If you kill them before they go off (easier than ever with PiF) then obviously life total is irrelevant, and turning off Gitaxian Probe isn't irrelevant, but when you needed to cast Ad Nauseam some or most games to win, Zoo taking your life total down was actually quite relevant."

Actually, not really.  Most combo decks that exist now, existed back in a similar form when zoo was tier1 or close (omnitell being the biggest exception). What didn't exist, however, were cards such as delver, true name nemesis, deathrite shaman, etc. Zoo began it's swift decline when mental misstep totally borked the format, and never bounced back. It's quite likely that banning the combo enablers would change nothing if blue has better disruption/permission, more efficient creatures both on the offense and defense as well as more tools.

You focus on the means they use to achieve the ends, I focus on the ends they achieve by using said means.  Besides, elves isn't gone and you should know it. Metagames shift, adapt, especially in legacy where the bannings are few and far between. Once people considered griselbrand sneak&show to be banworthy. Players adapted and new decks arose.

The power level of Omni/Gris/Emmy is strong, but not something that on their own immediately wins the game. Griselbrand comes the closest to doing so, but at a cost of paying life.   Compare putting Emrakul into play for B vs 2U. Clearly, WotC thought reanimating an Eldrazi was too powerful, but S&Ting it in was not.

MTGLegacy,3dkb5e,Timiniel,4,Fri Jul 17 02:09:26 2015 UTC,You're focusing on match ups too much. Delver pushed then out because it has such a better batch up against those decks you say pushed aggro out.   Banning delver would bring back jund and maverick in a big way
MTGLegacy,3dkb5e,Timiniel,3,Fri Jul 17 02:19:07 2015 UTC,"I guess im confused on the logic now. Wouldnt banning delver make the other decks better? Because if delver really was what pushed the other decks out, because it had a better combo matchup per say, wouldn't banning it make combo better and further keep decks like maverick and jund out?   I personally think that the meta will correct itself in due time. Miracles has some bad match ups, and if people start accounting for it instead of trying to force their deck to work, then miracles wont seem as overpowered. Honestly, i feel this should be the thing that brings jund and maverick back into the format, as they can pack their sideboard full of things like choke and needle and null rod and turn their even to slightly favorable matchup into a 60/40 one, and thus completing the cycle.  Lets also note that fast combo is at a low, with ANT and OMNI being the strongest decks. That helps decks like jund and maverick a ton, as it lets them develop their board and disrupt."

Jund and Mav also have decent match ups against combo. The reason they aren't played is because a blue aggro deck exists that is just as fast as they are.   Lets also note that fast combo is at a low, with ANT and OMNI being the strongest decks. That helps decks like jund and maverick a ton, as it lets them develop their board and disrupt.    I agree, but so long as Delver exists, players who care about playing the optimal deck are generally going to choose delver variants over mav/jund and decks like that."

Was it combo that made maverick become less played (and I might notice that frankly maverick has a good matchup versus several of the combo decks around), or was it delver and TNN?  Your perspective is not reflective of reality. It's not the combo decks that prevent those decks from coming up, instead, it's the decks that are strong vs the combo.  Why do you think that, with eidolon, storm no longer has a very good matchup vs burn? A deck that disrupt the combo while putting up the clock is the biggest problem. The thing is, delver can set up a clock that is as fast, or even faster than zoo, while piling up more disruption.   You really need to revise your analysis. It has no basis on what really happened, nor the motivations for things right now."

Of course you can rely on the clock to beat combo.   Aggro beats control beats combo beats aggro. Are you familiar with this? If so, do you know WHY? Because combo decks are SUPPOSED to be faster than aggro. If undisrupted, a combo deck should beat an aggro deck all the time.  So, no. No you cannot rely on your clock to beat combo.   Because it also has Rishadan Port and Wasteland, obviously   And was splashing for thalia. And yet, you don't consider that? Why can't zoo adapt? Why mustn't it? Why shouldn't it?   But it doesn't work as a deck, as evidenced by its lack of results.´   It's solidly tier 2, has won a couple of SCG tournaments recently and if it weren't so criminally underplayed, you would be seeing it more often. Also, it's several times been a deck with great win ratio versus the field, but people still didn't play it.  Lack of results is evidence of nothing if you don't consider how many people are playing a deck. Do you think lands' lack of results is evidence of it being bad? Then how is it one of the decks with the highest win ratio in the format, if not the highest, for over six months now?"

MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,_sandcastle,7,Thu Jul 16 07:00:41 2015 UTC,"Many older lists play 3, and 1 side, current lists play 4 main. As it is your main wincon I would highly recommend playing 4 main."
MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,LastTomato,2,Thu Jul 16 12:27:41 2015 UTC,"I like 3, but both are good. Almost all placing elves decks have 4 NO maindeck, generally if you have to drop a spell it's 1x GSZ  I think the simple explanation is that 4 will give you more big plays more frequently, but 4 will give you more dead hands also (GoN, GoN, NO, NO, 3 lands is a hand that's going nowhere until you topdeck into something). Alternatively 3 allows for a more 'fair' strategy, as a 'play dudes and attack' deck, which does better against decks that have to handle every single threat, like miracles.   There's also the fact to consider that NO is just better against some decks than others, so that makes it partially a meta choice. NO getting counterspelled hurts, whereas nonblue decks generally roll over more to NO -> CHB.  The major benefit to the full playset is that Elves very easily gets enough dudes on the board to power a cradle into an early NO with attackers up into craterhoof. What this means is that you can easily treat the deck as a combo deck with NO->CFB as your main strat, so more NOs make more consistent wins for the deck through that route.  It all depends on your list though, elves generally play with 4 glimpse 4 GSZ 4 NO, which gives you a lot of utility and paths to victory, but interfere with each other slightly. (The spells themselves don't draw off of glimpse (though going GSZ into visionary will get you a card and GSZ into symbiote or ranger can still get you a 'play a creature' trigger off the glimpse if you bounce something.))  Some decks run worldspine wurm, ruric thar, or progenitus in the sideboard, which are more likely to be useful if you have more NOs in your deck."
MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,DarkLordMagus,2,Thu Jul 16 08:31:27 2015 UTC,"Almost all placing elves decks have 4 NO maindeck, generally if you have to drop a spell it's 1x GSZ   GsZ is like always a 4 of. As far as i remember, only Julian23 did cut a GsZ recently decklist."
MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,e_scaon,2,Thu Jul 16 09:20:43 2015 UTC,The list he posted here for that event has 4 GSZ and 3 NO.
MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,MASTICATOR_NORD,2,Thu Jul 16 15:02:32 2015 UTC,"I want to start by saying that I agree with /u/DarkLordMagus I am a big fan of having 4 NO in the main. I like the possibility of going off on turn 2 and that is increased by having the full set of NO. I am also on the Ruric Thar sideboard plan (when I play elves) because you can jam the NO very soon and end up with something that wrecks storm, delver, omni, etc."
MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,tumescentpie,2,Thu Jul 16 14:10:32 2015 UTC,"it's tricky because you essentially have 2 paths to victory.    1-natural order t2 or t3 for hoof and swing big    2-glimpse chain for mana to hardcast or green sun for hoof. this approach also lets you dig down to a natural order for hoof.    I wouldn't suggest ever cutting a GSZ for a NO since in a pinch you can use GSZ to find your finisher or whatever you need but you can't really NO for a dryad arbor on t1. if you find that you are always going for that NO as early as possible then pack 4, if you are glimpsing and beating down more often then go 3."
MTGLegacy,3dh9w6,rumballtron,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:46:29 2015 UTC,"I played 4 for the last ~14 months but recently switched back to 3 in the whole 75. Mainly because it's bad against decks in the current meta, mainly grixis and miracles. I'd board out the 3 against those decks as you'll never want to cast them. They have plenty of counter spells and removal. Getting it countered is bad and casting it with 1-2 creatures in play is also bad. I'm playing sylvan library in the main instead, soo good against miracles.  Advantage of playing 4 is that you have more pay-off cards, deck will be slightly more consistent at winning quickly but to be honest you don't need more consistency or pay-off cards against good match ups. Playing 4 is also good against combo decks because you need to win ASAP."
MTGLegacy,3dfxqg,spm615,17,Wed Jul 15 23:28:34 2015 UTC,"I want to sell you on Tezzerator, not unlike the one that just came in 2nd in the Drakkar Tournament in France. (Although there are much more refined lists out there)  Here's the thing - they didn't ban Dig Through Time. Maybe they still will, but you can't count on it. So, you can do one of three things. You can Play Dig Through Time or you can Beat Dig Through Time, and if you don't want to be as grindy as Miracles, I say you want to Beat Dig Through Time.  So, what's the best way to do that? I'd say the most effective way is to play something that runs graveyard hate mainboard as part of it's own gameplan. You get to accidentally turn off all of their delve cards just as splash damage. The only decks that do that are something like Enchantress that main decks Rest in Peace, or Tezzerator, which often goes for Leyline + Helm for the free win.  The thing is, Leyline + Helm is a better two card combo than you may think, and is certainly stronger than all of this Painter + Grindstone nonsense. Besides Leyline turning off Delve cards, auto-winning every single Graveyard based matchup, and getting all of these weird side benefits like shrinking Goyfs, neutering Deathrites, etc, the 2 card win is actually one 0 cost card, and one card that only really costs 2 or 3. It's one of the quickest kills out there.  Why am I claiming that Helm doesn't cost (4)? Because Tezzerator gets to run Sol Lands and Mana Rocks. Since it's artifact based, all of the color requirements in the deck are exactly UBX on CMC >= 2 cards, which means cards like Dimir Signet and Darkwater Catacombs give your manabase the robustness to run the Sol Lands without flinching.   This also means you get to run the best but hardest to include card in Legacy, Turn 1 Chalice of the Void. This all begins to feel like a bit of an aside to the fact that you also get to run Tezzeret, Agent of Bolas at full strength, (and again, as early as Turn 2). Not only is he consistency for all of these cards (or making 5/5 beaters appear at will), it's remarkably easy for him to just drain life for 12 to 20 after a single +1 activation.  There is one drawback that has to be confessed to here. While you get to play all of the classically good Blue cards you want, Force of Will et. all, you don't actually get brainstorm. I know playing brainstorm is fun, but if it makes you feel better, thanks to Chalice of the Void your opponent won't get to play Brainstorm either. Or even Dig Through Time for that matter. They won't get access to their consistency cards much at all.  Of course, there are plenty of cantrips that YOU can go to that still work, if Tezz's digging for 5 a turn isn't strong enough. Heck, you could even Dig Through Time yourself if that's the direction your build is oriented.  The thing about Tezzerator is that it incidentally kind of stops the opponent from playing Blue. Making the only real Blue player ... you."

Well, if you like pooping on non-blue decks, and being the reason the format needs force of will and brainstorm, belcher is the deck for you.   In my opinion, it is one of the strongest non-blue decks. And even better? It is pretty easy to learn and to use each round, is very consistent, and with the current combo decks being much slower (omni and Ant being the strong ones), lots of people will not be expecting it. It is literally the exact opposite of miracles, can be built cheap, and depending on the version, the cards can be ported to other decks once you get tired of winning so much and gettin' it in with all the women between rounds. Just watch out for force of will and learn to play around it, and know that you can win games off of 10 turn 1 goblins given the right situation.   All aboard the belcher hype train!!lets bring this deck back to the top 8, further push all non-blue decks out of the format, and make ties a thing of the past."

Either you combo out turn 1, or you don't really do a whole lot. Kill or concede if you really want to save time, though some hands can topdeck the rest of the combo before your opponent finds enough answers."

MTGLegacy,3dfxqg,Mutantknight,6,Thu Jul 16 00:21:27 2015 UTC,"Good question. UWR is the weakest Delver deck by a fair margin, since it has conflicting goals. Delver wants to keep people in the early game, but Stoneforge wants to grind it out in the midgame.   RUG vs BUG is something I'm not super knowledgeable about, but it essentially comes down to whether you'd rather play tempo or midrange. BUG has a better combo matchup, but doesn't close the game out quickly. If sitting back and ticking up Liliana and holding up Deathrite activations sounds like a fun win condition, go for BUG. RUG plays outs extremely differently, and your goal in every single game is to never let your opponent climb out of the early game, where a single cheap threat and some soft counters will kill them. RUG is better at just blowing people out, but if your opponent resolves an important threat, you're in bad shape. Play RUG if you want to make every mana count, and live and die by careful sequencing. Play BUG if you want all grind all the time, and win through sheer average topdeck strength."
MTGLegacy,3dfxqg,10leej,1 point,Thu Jul 16 00:35:07 2015 UTC,"I'd tack onto this that RUG actually has a pretty amazing spell based combo match up. Its clock is faster (goose vs deathrite; bolt vs decay) and blue based combo allows you to bring 2-4 REB effects. The mana denial plan combined with 10-18 counters post board and the faster clock means your combo match ups in my opinion are better than bugs. Where rug really struggles is in the midrange match ups where if your opponent manages to keep 3+ lands in play your cards are generally much much weaker than theirs (including your top decks). Additionally non blue decks are typically pretty rough. Think dredge, D&T, aggro loam, junk, jund, etc."

The games themselves are simple enough for a regular pilot to play the deck, but the deck has a higher skill cap than people give it credit for. (Seen most often in the Aggro or Tempo match-ups.)  Eidolon of the Great Revel is a pretty busted card in Legacy, and you have a surprising amount of reach in closing the game. (Any life total under 10 is typically not safe, and you can even close the game when your opponent is on 15+ life with Price of Progress.)  It's pretty weak against Reanimator, and not great against Omni-Tell or Storm, but crushes decks like Shardless BUG/Delver variants.  Failing that, Reanimator is also pretty strong.  Reanimating Iona, Shield of Emeria is good against a surprising amount of decks in Legacy, and Griselbrand is still pretty degenerate.  Being able to win off your opponent's Show and Tell is pretty tilting too."

You still get the satisfaction of playing really tight, grindy games, but you also finish some of your rounds in 10 minutes and have plenty of time to relax.   Once you've got the basic pieces, picking up different storm variants is pretty cheap, so you can always keep yourself occupied with something different.  A well-tuned storm deck also has very few poor matchups - most of the really abysmal ones like Reanimator aren't seen very often.  The ways you win are truly absurd sometimes - I built my way up to 10 storm off the back of a few Rituals and 2 Sensei's Tops that I kept flipping over and over again. I've literally Mindtwisted my opponent on turn 1 after casting Duress, Cabal Therapy, making 16 goblins, then flashing the Therapy back. I've hardcast an Emrakul off of a bunch of land and 3 LEDs."

The deck is rather cheap to build barring a few expensive cards that you can run it without in the interim (also you do not need Candles for the deck, they're win-more) and the expensive cards will hold their value.  You get to abuse top and a ton of tutors but you're a turn 4 deck without interruptions and with interruptions you're the inevitable deck so you will win.  Here's my list from memory.  I haven't tweaked it in a while but did a testing tournament online where I tested a bunch of different cards and still managed 2nd place despite playing some stinkers.  It's a deck that takes some learning as it has a lot of marginal gains.  cards with asterisks next to them are cards that you can test different numbers on to fit in the suggested cards at the end.   ---The Set Up 4x Green Sun's Zenith* 4x Sensei's Divining Top* 4x Exploration Map* 3x Pithing Needle Naming Wasteland Blind 98% of the time* 2x Into the North* (which fetches snow lands) 2x Moment's Peace* 4x Crop Rotation ---The Sweeps 1x All is Dust* 1x Oblivion Stone* 1x Ugin* --The Creeps 4x Primeval Titan* 1x Oracle of Mul Daya 1x Emrakul, the Aeons Torn 1x Kozilek, the Frequently Sideboarded 1x Ulamog, the 9 mana Vindicate --The Mana 2x Dryad Arbor 1x Karakas 1x Eye of Ugin 1x Cavern of Souls naming Titan or Elf and Pretty Much Never Eldrazi Because Those Getting Countered Never Matters Because You Just Eye Them Up Again 1x Thespian's Stage 1x Dark Depths which is a snow land 1x Glacial Chasm 3x Snow Covered Forest 3x Green Fetch Land 4x Glimmerpost 4x Cloudpost 4x Vesuva*   Suggested Cards to Play With * 2-3 Ancient Stirrings (can reduce # of maps/tops/GSZ) * Singleton Wasteland (can be extremely useful in the case of awkward lands on your opponent's side, and sets up with the next card.  Stops Ports and Blinkmoths mostly) * Singleton Crucible of Worlds (this card is always amazing when you land it) * Candelabra of Tawnos (this is basically a dark ritual, useful in a combo-heavy meta I would imagine...it wasn't very useful in my testing league) * Exploration (this is inconsistent ramp but would be useful in a lands / D&T heavy meta I would imagine...it wasn't very useful in my testing league) * More / Different mixes of your Sweepers (Ugin is the most exciting/powerful, but O-Stone gets cast T2 for 3 and blows up on T4, with T3 protected by Moment's Peace against elves and the like, and All is Dust is a sacrifice and randomly only 5 mana)  Glimmerpost is the secret MVP in this deck because the incidental lifegain early on becomes huge stacks of life gain later in the game, especially with PrimeTime finding a pair of them.  Always use vesuvas over cloud/glimmerposts when you can, you'd rather be able to draw your cloud/glimmers later rather than drawing a vesuva.  The magic number of cloudposts is 2.  You need 2 to prevent them from wasting your whole mana base, but with 2, glimmerposts let you make more than enough mana while providing life to keep you in the game and build inevitability.  Ulamog and Kozilek are always going to get hit by Swords and that's fine, you just gained a turn of life and got their effect.  The magic number to Eye+Emmy is 20 mana, because it's 7 for tutor and 13 for Emmy thanks to Eye.  To Use Glacial Chasm and Primetime Correctly, do the following: resolve primetime find glimmerpost/vesuva on existing post and Glacial Chasm.  stack triggers so chasm is underneath glimmerpost, gain your glimmer life, then eat the post because you have a million of them, but green mana is scarce.  You can't attack with Glacial Chasm up, so you won't get more primetime triggers until you let it die.  But it's pretty easy to use Primetime to stabilize, not attack for a turn and just play a land / do some topping / searching, and set up for the next turn.  Attack with Primetime, find two more posts, then tap posts for mana in your second mainphase.  I could talk about this deck for a long time it's a lot of fun, but especially if you're doing a lot of miracles on miracles grindy shit, you'll love this deck because every turn you don't die you're like 20% closer to winning the game with GIANT NOODLY DUDES"

My local meta is infested with miracles and not with bloodmoon decks except for the occassional painted stone, which is on the 1/3 beatdown plan, so blood moon is rather irrelevant in that matchup because you can just natty hit your land drops.

MTGLegacy,3dfxqg,10leej,2,Thu Jul 16 13:18:26 2015 UTC,"Do you like to experience joy when you play Magic? Are you looking for a deck that requires more intelligence than a ham sandwich to play? Do you want to break some of the most fundamental rules of Magic as you play? Do you enjoy exploring literally every single possibility in your chosen color or colors? Is the idea of crushing people with spaghetti monsters appealing to you? If you answered ""no"" to the second question, play Sneak and Show! But if you answered yes to most of these questions, then there is only one deck for you, and that is 12-Post.  Let's face it: one of the appeals of Magic is the ability to do arbitrarily awesome shit. Sure, any Joe or Jane can netdeck and cobble together the mathematical hodgepodge that is whatever happens to be cool in today's meta, but it takes a truly awesome person to say, ""You know what, I am going to cast 6-, 7-, 8-, 10-, 11- and 15-mana shit in Legacy, and you're doing fuckall to stop me."" Who has time for one mana a turn? Certainly not you. You have cool shit to cast! You want to Wasteland me, bro? Well I'm just going to Crop Rotation this Cloudpost into...another Cloudpost! I didn't want that one anyway!  Delvers are for pansies. Thalia? Cool trick, doll. Let's see how your puny sword matches up with my Primeval Titan. Wanna flood the board? A -3 (or, holy shit, the occasional -4) from Ugin ought to take care of that. And if all that fails? Hide in a Chasm for a few turns. You're safe in your hidey-hole. Just hope it doesn't smell too bad. And what's better than a spaghetti monster? That same spaghetti monster, cast over and over again, every single turn. ""Sorry sir, but I will be taking all of the turns from here on out.""  The best and worst parts of the deck are the creativity it inspires. You can run literally anything in your colors because mana-wise, everything is on the table. You can have insane sideboards and can literally find matchups where you will board in all 15 cards, depending on what tech choices you make. The downside, of course, is that you have to really know what you're doing to play the deck. It is one of the hardest decks to play correctly, and even something as mundane as playing the wrong lands early can easily lose you the game. There's no for-sure ""optimized"" list since so few people play it as it is and again, the mana production means anything is possible.  But the best part? The thing that really puts 12-Post over the top, aside from all the awesome shit it lets you do? Nothing inspires the tears of a Miracles player quite like Turn 1 Cloudpost-go. Do you have a 6 on top? What about an 8? And what about a 15? Too bad, I'm casting it anyway :)  Play 12-Post.    Still not convinced? /u/TheLastBeast is also a satisfied customer!"

I will say that Standstill can become a liability in certain matchups and winning versus fast combo is very difficult.  My store has a lot of Miracles, too and I've generally been favoured in that matchup which helps.  The decklist I played is here.  It's a bit out of date, but would probably still be playable.

MTGLegacy,3dg5ux,ogre_bard,3,Thu Jul 16 22:21:10 2015 UTC,"Landstill  Man... I love Landstill, it was the first deck I ever top8ed a biggish (180-200~) event with. I have played just about every version at one point or another in tournaments the last 9-10 years (UWx, BUGw, Ur, Dreadstill, etc) and own more copies of Mishra's Factory than I am willing to admit.  I kept playing it long after Stoneblade was better, and for too long after Miracles was better.  I have since joined the Miracles dark side... and while it is probably the better deck, I do think some version of Landstill has a chance to be good.  Dreadstill pretty much died when abrupt decay became a thing, this type of deck might still be possible to pilot but you would have to be very good at it.  Ur is a lot more ""tempoy"" than traditional landstill lists and relies heavily on countermagic. Personally I don't like having trouble with resolved Tarmogoyfs in my control deck, but if this style appeals to you give it a shot.  BUG has a lot of utility (potential for Loam, Lilianna, Abrupt Decay, etc) but I find Pernicious Deed to be particularly vulnerable and slow removal and the manabase is by far the greediest which does lose games from time to time.  I don't think NinjaStill was ever a 'real' deck, but the basic theory is to cheese dudes into play under standstill by ninjutsu'ing them off man-land attacks, looks pretty bad but I have been wrong before.  UWx Landstill is where I would start if you wanted to look at a modern competitive Landstill list.  Mostly because of the ability to pack in 3-4 [[Myth Realized]], which is an exciting new tool for abusing Standstill.  Merfolk  For non-Landstill Standstill decks you're pretty much looking at Merfolk (or Meathooks/Slivers, but that's basically a worse more expensive version of merfolk). Aether Vial and potentially pumped Mutavaults make Standstill a real threat and Standstill doubles as pseudo protection against removal/sweepers as you get to reload."

Someone already mentioned that manaless is the version that can splash blue for FoW (as well as disrupting shoal, sometimes misdirection or mindbreak trap) to counter hate cards, as manaless is weaker against grave hate. I have seen another manaless variant, running dryad arbor and dakmor salvage as its only ""lands"" in order to run Bloodghasts (also dryad arbor can cast cabal therapy).

People dont expect dredge to fight a counter war. I played a reanimator player and had Git Probe + Narcomoeba + Disrupting Shoal + FoW and he just was not prepared for the second counter spell."
MTGLegacy,3dgn45,RedeNElla,-6,Sun Jul 19 08:21:38 2015 UTC,"Dredge is not / should not be for new players. Can new players afford it? Sure. Should they buy in? No.   Play something else. Dredge is tough when you don't have a Full grasp of every deck, how they win, what hate they'll bring in, and what hate to bring in to stop it."
MTGLegacy,3dgn45,Bob_Bradshaw,4,Thu Jul 16 05:17:19 2015 UTC,"surely it depends on what type of player?  dredge does something so drastically different to normal magic that it's an experience in itself, especially for people coming into eternal formats (I mean, stuff like dredge is why eternal formats are so cool)  having a great game 1 matchup against almost everything is also a great way to get some wins as a newer player and not feel like you're losing constantly as you learn."
MTGLegacy,3dghoq,OrionoftheGlade,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:13:32 2015 UTC,"Sample sideboard, Ricardo Sanchez 3rd place list from GP Lille:  1 Grafdigger's Cage  1 Necropede  2 Rest in Peace  1 Sylvan Library  1 Flusterstorm  1 Force of Will  2 Hydroblast  2 Krosan Grip  2 Swords to Plowshares  1 Savannah  1 Karakas  White splash definitely makes side-boarding easier, as it gives you access to more powerful cards in the form of Rest in Peace and Swords to Plowshare. The biggest oddball here would be the Necropede, which is most likely a concession to Young Pyro decks being a large part of the format. Everything else is in there for obvious reason, Karakas for Reanimator/Marit Lage, Fluster and Force for Combo, Sylvan for control, etc.  As far as boarding out cards, everything except for Brainstorm and Invigorate can be reasonably side boarded out. Do you have any questions regarding specific sideboard cards or match-ups? Side boarding is varied between decks by nature, so it's difficult to give a blanket answer to any questions without providing match-up context.  Edited for formatting"
MTGLegacy,3dghoq,jesturelol,2,Thu Jul 16 04:27:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, this is one of the ones I actually saw beforehand. So when do you bring in Library/what do you take out for it?  Is Swords only relevant vs Griselbrand and other reanimator/SnT decks? When you need more control like Fluster and Force, which cards do you take out? Daze, or more pump spells?  And what's the Necropede for?"
MTGLegacy,3dghoq,Countertoplol,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:42:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know your list, but I know many run that random package of singletons (spell pierce, stifle etc.). If you're against, say, Miracles, I'm sure you'd get more mileage out of a sylvan library than a stifle."
MTGLegacy,3dghoq,alcaizin,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:52:22 2015 UTC,"Necropede is for Young Pyromancer.  Without knowing your exact list, I'd cut pump spells for Sylvan (or a one-of that's dead in the MU) since Sylvan is likely to be good in the grindier games presented by removal-heavy decks, which are the most likely to two-for-one you.  Charm is good against Pyromancer as well, since it either kills Peezy or gets your dude in past the tokens (let's be real, there aren't Pyromancer decks that aren't playing blue).  You probably also cut a pump spell for that one.  After sideboard, you can transform into something closer to a Delver deck that only needs to deal 10 points of damage - cut some of the combo pieces for more generally good cards.  Remember that they're gonna have to play around the combo, even if you didn't leave much of it in (kinda like Twin in Modern)."

MTGLegacy,3dfbgr,Ozy-dead,2,Wed Jul 15 21:41:12 2015 UTC,"What you saw is classic DnT splashing red for magus. There are also splashes into black for zealous persecution, into green for gaddock teeg and choke, and blue for meddling mages. Historically, mono-white has had the best results and is most consistent. Recently, DnT has been in a bit of a decline because it can't deal with Dig Through Time decks well (Grixis, Dig Miracles, Omni). DnT works very well in a delver meta. Currently, it's not a delver meta, so DnT is slowly being pushed down to tier 2."

Maverick has a hatebear component (and notably has Gaddock Teeg, one of the strongest hatebears), but is the generally worse hatebear deck compared to Death and Taxes. The list you're describing is somewhere in between, and is likely worse than both I'm afraid.  It looks like you've seen the recent D&T lists with a red splash for Magus, which is promising (though I must say that without having tested it myself, I'm not entirely convinced by the idea what with Legacy being dominated by two decks that play tons of basics).   Something else you can look into are some older D&T lists that played Ghost Quarters and Leonin Arbiters along with the usual stuff, for maximum mana disruption."

MTGLegacy,3dfbgr,cromonolith,3,Wed Jul 15 22:35:13 2015 UTC,"Here are some cards that Gaddock Teeg stops.

That's off the top of my head.  From this we can see that he does a number on Miracles, stops Storm entirely unless they have Grapeshot, can slow down Omnitell a bit unless they just have the Emrakul (prevents Dig and Firemind's Foresight), can slow down Dredge by stopping Dread Return and Breakthrough, is actually pretty good against Elves, stops High Tide decks of all flavours if that's something you care about, etc."

MTGLegacy,3deyj1,Skriger,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:48:52 2015 UTC,Tainted Remedy doesn't double False Cure because it's a replacement effect -- so it turns off Kavu Predator and False Cure itself.

Miracle triggers (they keep the card in hand, but cannot cast it for its Miracle cost).   I'd look into the Elf abilities you're looking at, though.  First of all, mana abilities can't be countered as they don't use the stack.  So no Stifling Heritage Druid's ability.  Also make sure you know which piece is the cost and which is the effect.  While you can counter Symbiote's untap effect, they will always get to return the creature to their hand, as returning the creature is a cost, not an ability."

Show/Emrakul is completely unaffected. Show/Omniscience is still perfectly reasonable, since Emrakul now costs 3 mana (a pretty good deal), and Dig is still free if you delve 3.

You should be able to keep them off of a very fast start, in which case you should get to the point where you can cast multiple spells a turn (even under the trinisphere).  One thing to remember about Lands is that they have a hard time interacting with you. Their interaction is limited to:  Good interaction   Trinisphere, Thorn of Amethyst, Sphere of Resistance. Fast Marit Lage.   Medium interaction   Ghost Quarter Lock (which takes a long time to set up). Port your lands in your upkeep."

MTGLegacy,3ddw6f,rerek,3,Wed Jul 15 18:44:34 2015 UTC,"Although it is a generally easy match-up, you have to play the match up more cautiously than some. Don't go for the combo without some spare mana to pay for spells after putting Omni down (and consider just putting in Emrakul unless you suspect either Karakas or Crop Rotation are in their hand) and try really hard to make the first thing you cast off of Omni either a second Omni or Emrakul. As they don't get priority until after you have a chance to cast something, this plays around them casting Krosan's Grip on the Omni."

MTGLegacy,3d9bsa,Apocolyps6,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:46:14 2015 UTC,You can't quite silence the permanents out of their hand. Chantwalking gives you exactly 1 turn per 'chant' and sucks against decks that mix disruption.   your 2 chains or 3 decays or w.e are often not enough so playing the more general disruption can only help. Also your manabase gets better.   This has all been talked to death forever ago in the forums.
MTGLegacy,3d9bsa,wintermute93,3,Wed Jul 15 01:01:24 2015 UTC,"Wait, is Trygon Predator a real consideration, or is that just a joke about how frustrating Miracles is and how Xantid Swarm never seems to do anything against them?

MTGLegacy,3d9bsa,noahgs,3,Wed Jul 15 05:26:23 2015 UTC,"Neither deck is going to win through an active Counterbalance/Top in game one. But if you want to argue two mana spells, TES plays 10 (4 Infernal, 4 Burning Wish - which can get Past in Flames and 2 Cabal Ritual) to ANT's 8.  The new Tutor has been solid, it's not deck defining by any means. But it's ended the argument about where the fourth copy of Infernal Tutor should be (Main deck vs sideboard)."
MTGLegacy,3d9bsa,steve2112rush,1 point,Wed Jul 15 11:38:44 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the builds of ANT with multiple maindeck Tendrils at least have a chance against CB/Top game 1. Make a bunch of land drops, run 4 spells into CB, ""hardcast"" Tendrils, rinse and repeat a few turns later. You still lose to the lock plus any pressure, and have to actually draw into the Tendrils, neither of which are great, but it's something."
MTGLegacy,3d9bsa,SporadicGenius,3,Wed Jul 15 13:12:00 2015 UTC,"Those decks technically aren't ANT - They're ""Grinding Station"". It's also impossible to argue against a deck when there isn't a proposed list, I've been speaking of the ""norm"" lists."

You're definitely right that normal ANT with 1-2 PiF, 0-1 Ad Nauseam, 1 Tendrils, 0 Empty is almost always just dead to turn 1 CB/Top, even if you make them burn a ton of mana spinning Top to counter a 0, counter a 2, counter a 1, counter another 2, etc.  Side note: when you're playing Miracles post-board, do you ever go for goblins and hope they sided out / can't find a Terminus, or do you wait until you have a good chance at a one-shot kill? I feel like a moderate number of goblins used to be a reasonable plan against post-board Miracles, but now that so many lists are running Mentor or something similar, that never works for me."

I usually prefer the more creature heavier builds, justifying green over monowhite by having toolbox creatures + knight of the reliquary."
MTGLegacy,3d92tv,sometimesIplayMagic,4,Tue Jul 14 15:59:23 2015 UTC,"This archetype blew up on the scene thanks to Jeff Hoogland...he popularized the deck but a few cycles later quit Legacy in Grand fashion because he hates the Brainstorm.dec staleness of the format, in addition to the fact that all non blue decks are at an inherent consistency disadvantage. Granted, his hallmark decks depended on turn one Chrome Mox + Chalice as their strategy against Combo.   The earlier lists ran a Burning Wish package to famously grab Devastating Dreams to wreck the board."
MTGLegacy,3d92tv,thepeter,5,Tue Jul 14 20:20:12 2015 UTC,"Mox Diamond, not chrome Mox.   I played dead guy for awhile with chrome mox, but never with chalice."

MTGLegacy,3d92tv,Countertoplol,2,Tue Jul 14 19:00:03 2015 UTC,"The main deck of this build feels pretty well tuned from my testing with it. As a few others have pointed out it is the evolution of the four color build I played for most of 2013 / 2014.  The side board felt a bit all over the place, but then a lot of legacy boards often do since you are getting attacked from so many different angles."
MTGLegacy,3d92tv,jeffhoogland,2,Wed Jul 15 14:49:16 2015 UTC,"Maverick player here.  First thing I want to say, Mono White feel *more inconsistent to me than Maverick. Green gives access to a mass amount of toolbox. Knight of the Reliquary, Green Sun's Zenith and Living Wish are my personal favorites. We also have access to a decent card draw/manipulation in Sylvan Library. Lastly we have the option to splash red (which I do) for the resiliency in Punishing Fire and Grove of the Burnwillows.  Second thing I wanted to say was the ability to protect our threats in the form of Mother of Runes. As a DnT player you already know how power she is. I prefer her over Chalice in Abrupt Decay and Punishing Fire heavy metas. Chalice is stronger in any combo meta and/or control metas. That said, you forego Thoughtseize in a Chalice deck.  Thirdly I like to play with more threats and have a faster presence on the board. I love utility creatures and finding ways to control the board through them. Being able to commit early to the board and ride it to victory, with multiple back-up plans in hand is my personal way to play.  Last thing from me is this. Maverick is an attrition deck not an aggro deck. As such cards that gain you value and silver bullets that you can search for make this deck what it is."
MTGLegacy,3d92tv,tsukixxiii,2,Wed Jul 15 15:47:46 2015 UTC,"Since you want to Chalice on 1 during most games (main reason for the Mox Diamonds), it only plays 1 DRS as a Green Sun's target.  If it played more, it would get stuck in your hand a lot.  I love me some DRS, but if your plan is Chalice, you can't really run any 1 drops.  Punishing Grove combo destroys creature decks, while Chalice does work against everything else.  Mox will put you down card advantage in the super early game, the deck really recoups the card advantage later with Punishing Fire.  Finding a Loam helps you find both pieces."
MTGLegacy,3d92tv,Krond,2,Tue Jul 14 14:21:52 2015 UTC,"Dark Confidant really helps pick up that card advantage early, too."

MTGLegacy,3d9d06,GnomishProtozoa,3,Wed Jul 15 18:57:36 2015 UTC,"The best piece of advice I can give you is that once you get better at the deck, you'll find that it's not you that is playing slowly in a match but your opponent, especially when you have a dominating board position but cannot find your finisher as your opponent will go into the tank to mull over their outs. When this happens, you need to be assertive and kindly ask your opponent to play faster as you both obviously want to finish the match before time is called.  I don't do this enough and have drawn quite a few rounds because of it."

My advice is just to watch and copy Joe Lossett as much as possible.  One thing I saw him do vs. a Lands player that helped me win a small Legacy tournament last night was using Top to order my cards with the second card being the worst card of the three at the end of opponent's turn.  Then I untap, draw, and have Jace fateseal that second card to the bottom, which improves your draws and builds up Jace for the gamewinning ultimate.  That's not unique to Legend Miracles, but pretty much any trick you can learn is an edge in a slow matchup."

MTGLegacy,3d6c70,magictgmike,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:12:15 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's nice to have less of a jarring ""game over"" moment, but I can't help but feel that this is extremely heavy-handed and will lead to games that are ridiculously warped by someone picking out the only relevant card(s) from their opponent's hand.  Obviously a game loss is very heavy-handed as well, but I always felt like it was a rare occurrence and everyone knew exactly what happens if an extra card reaches your hand. So just don't do it."
MTGLegacy,3d6c70,ashent2,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:37:26 2015 UTC,those warped games would have been losses for the other person so it seems like a pretty big improvement.  The problem with drawing extra cards is that due to hidden information it's frequently impossible to resolve the game state correctly and reset things.  This new system lets you spot the issue at any time and continue the game rather than stopping it.  This isn't going to change the rarity of this happening.
MTGLegacy,3d6c70,magictgmike,-1,Tue Jul 14 07:33:00 2015 UTC,"I agree that it won't change the rate at which drawing extra cards accidentally occurs, but it does introduce a completely different mechanic to games affected.  I'm not completely sold on it. What I want to express is that games in which my opponent saw my hand and took a card out of it without the use of a discard spell shouldn't happen so I'm not sure it's better than a game loss. My argument is that the fix isn't immediately understood as the correct solution, so naturally it can't be the best solution. Losing a game due to an accident is crappy, but it was well understood."
MTGLegacy,3d6c70,ashent2,0,Tue Jul 14 07:36:37 2015 UTC,If you think its worse than a game loss then concede. Not sure how it could be worse than just straight losing.
MTGLegacy,3d6c70,HuntmasterOfTheFells,1 point,Wed Jul 15 01:05:31 2015 UTC,It really isn't about the player who made the mistake... They should be punished.
MTGLegacy,3d6c70,ashent2,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:50:07 2015 UTC,"It's an auto loss against all combo decks for the most part. It should be a random card chosen by the judge and then revealed to all members and shuffled away. This way the non-violating player doesn't have information on the entire hand but does gain some knowledge and the player who drew an extra card doesn't gain the advantage of the extra card. Yes it is possible to try and abuse this situation as a free, half faithless looting, but it sure as hell beats a free thoughtseize. What if you drew and extra card on turn 1 and your opponent gets to see your entire game plan and take away your one and only land. You had mana dork back up or, brainstorm/ponder/probe. Maybe you're just a burn deck but now you have no lands. It seems too much of a ""nicer"" or ""hidden"" auto game loss to me. Obviously there are going to be times where the hand you have is super good and missing a card doesn't break the game for you as well. Just saying that this is too much of a penalty if the idea is to create a more lenient penalty that is easily repaired."
MTGLegacy,3d6c70,tsukixxiii,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:59:20 2015 UTC,"This is literally better than a game loss. I wasn't arguing there weren't better options but they could have left the rule as is.  The guy said this was worse than a game loss, in no way is it worse than just losing the game."

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,tophaloaf,3,Mon Jul 13 14:51:12 2015 UTC,"I think maybe a Counterbalance ban would have been healthy, but I'm on board than unbanning Survival is probably not.  So lumping the two together is a very punchable straw-man, but it's still a straw man."

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Skuloth,8,Mon Jul 13 15:27:12 2015 UTC,"I play storm.  I play high tide.  I love combo decks.  Unbanning Necropotence would be safer than unbanning Frantic Search.  4 Frantic Search would speed up high tide by a full turn, making it potentially the best combo deck in the room, since it's biggest weakness is to faster combo decks.  Necro, on the other hand, loses to pithing needle and phyrexian revoker, as well as hurting storm's ability to play Past in Flames and making the combo far more reliant on your own life total, which can be rough in a world of delvers and dazes."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,8,Mon Jul 13 15:51:50 2015 UTC,"Frantic search is close to gush's level of busted in that deck. It's card selection, stapled to a ritual that turns on your post-twister digs."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,firebadmattgood,0,Mon Jul 13 16:35:38 2015 UTC,Gush is terrible in that deck...

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,__Topher__,3,Wed Jul 15 03:50:57 2015 UTC,"Unbanning Necropotence would be safer than unbanning Frantic Search.     Only way to tell is to test both!    Some of these non-power cards that have been banned since pre-9/11 could use a season up against 15 years of design. I'd love to see what would happen with Necro. Obviously it's a great engine, but BBB? Can't discard to it? Pithing Needle? Abrupt Decay?"
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,notaprisoner,5,Mon Jul 13 16:35:32 2015 UTC,"Necro would be good, but I doubt it'd be better than current storm builds.  It'd be more explosive, with more turn 2 wins, but a lot more losses.  You essentially have three options when buliding the deck (assuming you're building it as a storm deck)   Leave out Past in Flames because Necropotence screws it up.  Become hyper aggressive on the combo, being willing to mull to it to play it as quickly as possible to get it down before you've taken much damage. Include Past in Flames so you have an option if you don't draw necropotence early enough that you have life to use it.  Deal with dead draws off of Necro. Include Past in Flames in the board and have Burning Wish available, making your back up plan more expensive and fragile than current storm's.  Remember, Burning Wish for PiF has never been particularly good because you still need another win condition after that.   If you don't have a turn 1 or 2 necro, you could easily be at 14 or lower life from two delver hits and other nonsense.  Play the necro, pay a ton of life, pass back, then what?  Die on the crackback with some burn?  What if your top 7 cards are mediocre?  We've all played enough Dig Through Time at this point that we've looked at 7 cards and been like ""ewww . . . I don't want any of these"".  It happens.  I had a 7 land Dig the other day.  I don't think the format is such that you can pay 7 life for 7 cards that you have to wait a turn for, then pay more life if they suck.  Especially not when you compare it to paying 7 life for 7 cards immediately and keeping your flying lifelinker around."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,2,Mon Jul 13 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"As a long time Storm pilot, this is exactly why I don't fear Necro in regular Storm decks. DDFT OTOH would love to run 2-3 Necros. But DDFT won't ever be format warping, so meh...  Maybe decks like Train Wreck can shake up things a little with a potent engine, but that's about it I guess.   Necro was rightfully banned in the first place but Legacy today does way nastier things than drawing a bunch of extra cards at your EoT in exchange for life."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,payl0ad,2,Mon Jul 13 17:40:51 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  I made this argument to my playgroup and they were all like ""Yeah but you draw 7 cards every turn with Necro""  What?  In what universe?  Ad Nauseam is arguably better than Necro in a lot of places because you can actually see whether you need to keep going or not.  Necro you never know what you're gonna get."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,2,Mon Jul 13 17:44:07 2015 UTC,"Yawgmoth's Bargain is twice the price of Necro, but when I saw it playtested it seemed much scarier being able to draw a ton of cards, cast a Tendrils, then draw a bunch more cards looking for more copies of Tendrils. Necro at least gives your opponent a turn to do something."

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Nolii,11,Mon Jul 13 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"As a legacy player, I just want the format to fucking evolve.  We've gotten like one new deck in the past 3 years (Grixis).  Other than that it's the same shit we've been playing since late 2012.  These are tournament results from December 2012.  If the exact same results popped up next weekend, would you be surprised?"
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,21,Mon Jul 13 15:36:57 2015 UTC,Sounds like an eternal format ;)
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Apocrypha,4,Mon Jul 13 15:49:59 2015 UTC,"That's not how it used to be though.  It looks like in the past few weeks starcity took down their 2010 and 2011 coverage archives, but I was looking this up about a month ago.  The decks shifted dramatically from 2010 to 2012, or from 2011 to 2013, but from 2012 to 2014 and 2013 to 2015 they didn't really shift much at all.  It used to be a slowly evolving format where it'd take 2 years to really see a shift, but you could take any 2 year period and it would be very different at the beginning than it was at the end.  Now, though, that's not the case.  The format hasn't really changed significantly in almost 3 years."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,13,Mon Jul 13 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunate, but Deathrite Shaman is some industrial-strength metagame concrete."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,branewalker,6,Mon Jul 13 16:19:24 2015 UTC,"DRS is powerful, and that might have been true in Modern, but in Legacy, Show & Tell is a much bigger offender. It's harder to answer and is almost always an instant win. And of course the cantrip suite is so much better than any other card drawing engine available, unlike Modern where there are actually very few engines so decks tend to be redundant (and linear)."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,notaprisoner,2,Mon Jul 13 16:33:22 2015 UTC,"On the combo front, sure, but that doesn't explain the coalescing of fair decks around fewer cards.  Also, every card that was aimed at already-good decks with the intent of shaking up Legacy has really only served to stagnate the format around those decks, and further push strategies like Goblins, Merfolk, and Maverick out.  But yes, Show and Tell has been a problem when combined with WotC's desire to push the boundaries on what effects are allowable on a single card. Emrakul, Omniscience and Griselbrand are simply ridiculous effects, no matter what they cost."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,branewalker,5,Mon Jul 13 17:18:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  With very few exceptions, the format is either dedicated combo decks that build up to a single winning turn, or ""goodstuff"" decks that only put a single threat on the board and intend to let it win the game on it's own.  Death and Taxes is an anomaly there, but the decks like Goblins, Merfolk, Enchantress, Affinity, etc, decks that wanted to put a lot together and win through the synergy of all of their cards?  They're mostly gone, because the individual all stars are so much more powerful than the synergy even when you can get it working, which the significant increase in power level of removal makes less and less likely."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,5,Mon Jul 13 18:42:04 2015 UTC,"The fair decks are pretty much all blue goodstuff decks, because only blue has the best tool to answer Show & Tell in countermagic. Blue fair decks aren't really that much better than non-blue decks head to head, but they gain so many percentage points against S&T and to a lesser extent Storm, not to mention are far less likely to die to their own terrible draws, that if you're serious about winning, you HAVE to play blue.    Like I've said, I've made friends with that fact, but that's not to say I wouldn't be thrilled if Wizards woke up one day and made actual changes to the format that incentivize not playing brainstorm and buddies and wincon of choice."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,notaprisoner,2,Mon Jul 13 19:01:21 2015 UTC,"However, prior to Omni-Tell (and certainly prior to Griselbrand), non-blue decks were a much larger percentage of the metagame. So, while I agree with you to an extent, I still think it's not entirely the fault of a card printed in 1998.  Moreover, the existence of Deathrite Shaman has still brought down some of the classic tribal strategies in favor of ""goodstuff"" decks, which is lamentable.  He has also reduced the effectiveness of Wasteland as a strategy, thus most of the old mono-color Wasteland decks have been significantly diminished as a result of that. So he's been influential on two axes in terms of reducing diversity in the format."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,branewalker,2,Mon Jul 13 19:52:09 2015 UTC,I blame it on the fact that Wizards doesn't want Legacy strength cards in either standard or modern. This really limits what enters Legacy as a format.
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,BassNector,2,Mon Jul 13 18:49:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, modern is their new toy. But I feel that modern is on a crash course to becoming an unstable format. Modern already has storm and cheerios, and people are actively trying to port in high tide + modern elves are becoming more and more combo-ish with each iteration. Without Wasteland and FoW, people will come up with better and faster combos till the meta will be just burn, combos and maybe some 39 counterspells 1 morphling type of deck. Current glue in Modern is...thoughtseize, and if a sorcery-speed discard is the only thing that's holding combos - the format has a problem."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Ozy-dead,5,Wed Jul 15 11:46:23 2015 UTC,"I'd say the additions of YP/Mentor, DTT and Angler/Tasigur have shook up the format quite a bit.  As you mentioned, we got a competitive version of a new archetype (grixis), but we also got a new competitive combo deck in Omnitell (the prior version was fun, but not that good). Ugin has brought some life back to MUD, and D&T is seeing new results with a red splash for Magus of the Moon/Recruiter.  That said, I do agree that it would be nice to give green some more room. Maverick was poised to make a comeback around the time of UR Delver, but banning TC while keeping DTT put the kabosh on that."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Kaono,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:05:51 2015 UTC,"Those are just cosmetic changes to existing archetypes, though. Even Grixis is just a new blue goodstuff deck. There also used to be a decision involved in Omni vs. Sneak & Show. jeffderek is talking about new decks, like the way the Zombie deck had a few months in the sun until they printed freaking DRS and RIP in the next block, followed by TNN."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,notaprisoner,2,Mon Jul 13 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"Well, they used to make open ended combo cards that you could do something with. We're never going to get another Solitary Confinement, Standstill, or Doomsday type card to enable new archetypes."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,KingJulien,2,Tue Jul 14 02:53:56 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that the ""U/W Miracles"" lists in that tournament are nothing like the present-day lists. Hell, one of them is listed as miracles, but runs 4 SFM, 4 Wasteland, 2 Tops, and 0 CB. Omnitell is entirely absent. The card that put RG Lands on the radar, Thespian's Stage, hadn't been printed yet. RUG Delver was far more dominant than today. BUG Delver has changed some key cards. Jund, Maverick, Zoo, and Goblins were much more prevalent.   So yeah, I would actually be flabbergasted if that was the top 32 of a recent Open. Every single deck has undergone major changes with the possible exception of RUG Delver, dredge, and esper stoneblade (although even they got TNN to play with). But the underlying flavor of each archetype is still recognizable. That, to me, is what an eternal format should look like: always changing, never unrecognizable."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,-Tazriel,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:15:09 2015 UTC,"So let me start by acknowledging that this is all very subjective, and that if you disagree with me after looking at these links, well, then I guess we just disagree.  That said, look at the following top 8/16's, selected at random from legacy opens in 2010 through 2012  2012  SCG Washington, January 2012  2011  SCG St Louis, December 2011  SCG Boston, April 2011  SCG Atlanta, April 2011  SCG Los Angeles, Mar 2011  2010  SCG Los Angeles, Jan 2010  SCG Indianapolis, March 2010  It is my opinion that the decks changed far more substantially from 2010 to 2012, or from 2011 to 2013, than they have from 2013 to 2015.  More new archetypes appeared and old ones disappeared.  Nowadays it feels to me like decks just swap up what the threats are a little when things change, but major changes don't happen at the rate that they used to."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:41:58 2015 UTC,"If the exact same results popped up next weekend, would you be surprised?   Well yeah, a little, because Sneak & Show hasn't seen success in ages. There's also a Scapeshift deck in 12th and a Goblins deck in 17th. And there's a Garruk Relentless in that BUG Control list (and BUG Control is a deck I haven't seen in years). You also don't see Stoneblade decks around so much anymore. Most of those decks still see play, but that looks like it would be a pretty unusual top eight if it happened now."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,TheBotherer,3,Mon Jul 13 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"Guess we'll have to agree to disagree then, I wouldn't be any more surprised by Sneak and Show or Scapeshift in the top 16 of that list than I was by Jund and Manaless making top 8 of this recent tournament or MUD putting 3 decks in the top 16 of this recent tournament or Merfolk and U/B Tezzeret making top 16 of this recent tournament"
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:46:52 2015 UTC,"Well, that's why I said ""a little surprised"", of course. In those lists you have one or two slightly abnormal placements (as you will tend to do with a format this diverse), but that list you posted had several more than the usual number would be, were it a current list. I would note it as being unusual.   Side note: Scapeshift is easily the oddest of these decks, as it was only a deck for a short time in Legacy, and even then it was fringe-ish. I would certainly be surprised to see it placing today, much more-so than any of those other decks."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,TheBotherer,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:01:35 2015 UTC,"I played against Scapeshift at the 4-0 table in Baltimore a few weeks ago :)  But yes, I'd be very surprised to see it make top 16."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,2,Mon Jul 13 19:15:26 2015 UTC,"Well! Still surprises me, but I suppose that's just one of the things I love about Legacy - there's so much diversity in the format that even with a fairly well-established top tier, you can't count out the many, many random decks that make up everything else!   FWIW I actually know the guy with the Tezz deck. I play against him fairly frequently at the weekly Legacy event at the store I go to, and as far as I know it's the only deck he plays, and he's very good at it. He's placed highly in other major events as well."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,TheBotherer,2,Mon Jul 13 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"BUG control is still really strong. It's just a powerhouse card away from making consistent top 8s, i think."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,KingJulien,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:55:11 2015 UTC,"We've gotten like one new deck in the past 3 years (Grixis)   Oops all spells, 4 color loam, UWR delver, food chain, infect, miracles (no, countertop bant and the old countertop decks were not miracles), deathblade, Fabiano BUG, shardless bug, are all decks that appeared in the competitive scene less than three years ago.   Omnitell and Tin fins are decks that are just barely out of the 3 years margin (1 month and 1 month and a half out).  You speak as if evolution is somehow slower when in fact, it is not.

Hell, I even published it and showed it to people, it was mentioned by Stephen Menendian in SCG. SO FUCKING WHAT?   The idea of a deck doesn't matter, only its first results and placements, because we're not talking about new decks that have been conceived in the past three years, or you'd have veritable HUNDREDS of them, imagined by people all around the world, being played in tournaments that are not as competitive, etc etc etc. We have to stick with what makes sense: High placements in competitive tournaments with 100ish plus people.  And then, 4c loam's appearence WAS in march 2013.  Be realistic, will ye?

Wizards cares about the format a little bit, but mostly wants people to stop playing legacy and start playing modern so they'll spend more money on magic.   Discuss amongst yourselves which you think is true.  My money is on #3.  I can build almost every legacy deck and I've spent less than $200 a year over the past 2 years maintaining my collection.  There's no reason to spend a ton of money on the format.  Once you're in and the only thing you have to buy is whatever the new set brings, you can pretty much never spend much of anything.  That's not what wizards wants to support."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,8,Mon Jul 13 15:00:15 2015 UTC,"There is no way Wizards cares about legacy to me. Knowing what to ban can be tough and cause a lot of bad feelings but there are some clearly safe unbans that we have to wait until they print the next ban-worthy card to get released in the crazy prisoner exchange they do instead of listening to people who play the format and letting Vice, Twist, and Earthcraft go."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,simdude,5,Mon Jul 13 15:16:03 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  I wish they'd actually just release a statement on the format at some point.  I'd love to hear justification as to why Earthcraft is more powerful and deserving of a spot on the banned list than Show and Tell, for example."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 15:21:27 2015 UTC,Wouldn't earthcraft be busted in elves?
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Cowcrusader,2,Tue Jul 14 01:11:50 2015 UTC,"How?  Elves doesn't really have a problem that earthcraft fixes.  Turning 1 creature into 1 mana isn't really any different than turning 3 creatures into 3 mana, and the card that does that comes with a creature on it's own (heritage druid).  Earthcraft doesn't die to sweepers, but it's not like it really does anything amazing that elves doesn't already do.  It's a better win condition for Enchantress than they currently have, but not significantly so.  I think you'd see more people playing Enchantress than you currently see, but it doesn't solve the inherent problems the deck already has, namely that Delver is too fast for it, Daze and Decay are too effective against it, Golgari Charm is insane against both the engine and the combo cards, and everyone has -1/-1 sweepers for TNN that incidentally hit Argothian.  You still have to pass the turn after comboing off and everyone gets a shot to answer all of your squirrels . . . so yeah I don't see it breaking the format."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:08:46 2015 UTC,"-I'm not convinced on Vice being an obvious unban. I know it's just a shit-ton of damage if it drops T1; it might actually have some impact on the format, especially against something like Miracles. -I'd have to think a bit about Earthcraft. On its face it's a pretty nasty engine card, but the only think I can see using it right now is Enchantress. Maybe we'd see a new breed of Elves that used less mana elves and more aggro elves? -Now Mind Twist... I'm pretty sure they could unban it and it wouldn't even be played except I dunno... maybe in some storm variants or if BUG control came back?    tl;dr? Mind Twist is an obvious un-ban. Disappointed that it didn't happen."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,bunkoRtist,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:44:09 2015 UTC,Earthcraft is banned because of [[Squirrel Nest]]. I'm not sure there's a more powerful combo for it. And that combo is not that impressive in the face of something like Omnitell.

It's a whole different world comparing the organization by SCG and the organization by BoM, plus SCG marketed the tournament almost as an attempt to break records. Not only that, but an IMMENSE amount of european players went there. Hell, more people from my country went to NJ than to lille, where we had the lowest attendance from my country I can remember.  The rewards for playing in NJ were bigger, organization was better, marketing was better, SCG has a higher reputation... You can't easily compare those two tournaments... At least not in the way you are trying to. It doesn't work.  If you want, you can compare the SCG opens to the ovinogeddon tournaments or the old BoM tournaments, and there you see the numbers being similar. Or the SCG IQs to the MKM tournaments, for example.

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Timiniel,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"They do Modern/Modern Masters because despite their best attempts, WotC knows there will be a crowd of people who prefer an ""expert"" non-rotating format. It takes less time, costs more money, and has a higher skill bar. Unfortunately, Legacy is not an option for this format since WotC can't sell more of it: they can't grow the format and they can't make money off of it. So, Modern exists because WotC can't sell more Legacy cards."

Modern pushes a lot of card prices forward, and they can make products like Modern Masters.  They can't make legacy masters.  Legacy only helps WotC in that I support distributors by buying the occasional playset of new cards.  Deathrite, Snapcaster, Liliana, Decay, Omniscience, etc.  That's not enough to make them invest in the format.  I just wish they'd admit it and get out.  If they don't like the format, that's fine.  Let it go.  Let an outside group that gives a damn manage the banlist, like EDH."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,0,Mon Jul 13 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"I don't see the correlation between selling Modern Masters boosters and more people playing Modern.  Are there many more Modern players today, as compared to 3 months ago, because of MM being on sale?  Also, what's your estimate of the impact of Modern Masters on their bottom line this year?  More or less than 5%?"
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,cyberstrider,3,Mon Jul 13 18:59:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know about MM2015, but the original modern masters saw a huge boost in modern tournament attendance because it brought the cost down on a ton of modern staples.  Sure, the $100 cards only went down to $90 or whatever, but a whole host of $8 uncommons went down to $1 and $2.  Serum Visions is still a big offender, but on the whole deck prices went down dramatically, and that brought a lot more people into modern.  It also sold them a lot of modern masters boosters.  That's not something they can do for legac.  I'd say MM was probably more than 5% of the paper business, but not by much."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,2,Mon Jul 13 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"It keeps players in the game that would otherwise not be in the game. Judges, people that attend FNMs, Prereleases, etc etc.  You seem to severely underestimate the impact the format does have. Half of my LGS wouldn't be there should legacy not exist. This is fairly common in several EU countries. A lot of people play standard (example) because since they are playing legacy and have the cards, they'll want a different challenge sometimes.  Legacy helps more than you think, and could help WotC even more if they chose to do something about it - and no, this has nothing to do with the reserve list."

Well, you might be quite a bit far from the truth.  The legacy community in my region has around 200 players. Most are currently inactive, or only play in GPs or the like, but from the active players, I'd say only around 10% fit that scenario.  Most of us, and this is reflected in other regions here in the EU and Japan (frankly my data on the US is limited and contradictory), are players who are much more recent. My testing partners are all people who had no legacy cards just a few years ago. Last FNM I went to, only one player had cards left over from the 90s. Hell, I only started collecting cards for legacy in the mid to late 2000s, and had my first legacy deck (dredge) around 2010 and my first dual in late 2012, saving slowly for them. Two of my testing partners weren't even playing until a couple of years ago.  My store has three judges. All three are people who either play legacy exclusively (as a constructed format, they still play limited) or people who play legacy as a main format.  I personally can tell you that I purchase a playset of each common and uncommon from every new expansion (plus any other cards I find interesting), because if a standard or modern metagame comes up that I like, I want to be able to reasonably quickly be able to assemble a deck I like. I know of other people who feel this way in Italy, Sweden and Spain, for example.  You might be a tad bit mistaken on your idea of who plays legacy :)   The burst of growth from 2011-2012 onward brought MANY people to the format.   Since you are correct that the reserve list isn't going anywhere, what would you have WotC do that would both help them and Legacy?   You can get a legacy masters set done with cards that are not on the reserve list. Me and a couple of mates got a list of cards that are used in the format, and filled up a few holes with draft-interesting cards. Several of these cards are cards that should really have a reprint, from simple cards like nimble mongoose and high tide to more complex cards such as rishadan port and the like.  You'd be amazed at how many legacy playables are not in the reserve list."

Still, I am surprised to hear of so many players that have picked up the format in the past few years. I hope that such vocal support can reach WotC to convince them of the value in supporting the format.  Sadly, the much maligned reserve list remains a huge problem. A set (or several sets)like you propose to increase the card pool would be nice. But what happens if these sets succeed in growing the Legacy player base? For every High Tide and Nimble Mongoose the format wants, they want 10x that many duals."

I can see a time in the future where Legacy owners will begin to realise they depend less and less upon Hasbro's control (to your point where Legacy players don't spend money on Hasbro products) and that they rely more on competitive Legacy events with or without Hasbro's participation. SCG have had limited success but the opportunity is still in its infancy.  The same can be said of Modern players, to a lesser extent."

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,MrMond4y,2,Tue Jul 14 00:19:01 2015 UTC,"In general people need to be more assertive when they think their opponent is playing slowly. As a Miracles player, I really do try to keep an eye on the clock and hurry my pace of play if time could be a concern. Similarly, I politely try to remind my opponent to watch their pace if I think they are tanking a little too long on their decisions or we're under ten minutes left in the round.  Almost all of my unintentional draws with the deck have come either against opponents who play slowly or in extremely grindy matchups (Lands players who don't concede G1 to Counterbalance + 2 on top of the deck, Stoneforge decks when I can't find Entreat, etc.)."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jon_boner,13,Mon Jul 13 15:28:20 2015 UTC,Now I've heard it all; a Miracles player complaining about an opponent taking too long! Love it.

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,efil4zaknupome,4,Mon Jul 13 15:49:33 2015 UTC,"In my first tournament as a miracles player I noticed that my opponents would take as long, if not longer on their turns/actions once the lock was placed. It's a problem with miracles matches and both players can be at fault."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Hlaford,3,Mon Jul 13 16:16:25 2015 UTC,Sometimes there is a lot to think about when top + counterbalance is out. Can I bait them into putting top on top so I can resolve this spell? or do they have a one drop in the top three? Maybe my opponent doesn't have a two or three on top? Counterbalance + top is not necessarily game over. I feel like miracles players assume their opponents are thinking about nothing when in reality you have to think the most when counterbalance + top is out.
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Cowcrusader,5,Tue Jul 14 08:24:47 2015 UTC,"It's not unusual at all. On Friday I played against an Omnitell player who was less than 5% to win game 1 after four turns. All of my turns were very fast: end of his turn spin top to draw the new card which doesn't cost 3, untap, draw, play land, attack with Venser, pass. My turns took less than 15 seconds. My opponent's turns often took over a full minute, consisting of playing a land and passing.   In his position, I would have conceded the game after 5 minutes. He definitely has the right to make me kill him though, and even that should have taken no more than 10 minutes. That first game took half an hour.   People play slowly when they have nothing to do."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,cromonolith,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:33:04 2015 UTC,"I've played against this guy.  People need to know that when they cast a cantrip they need to know what they are looking for.

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,ChivesandOnions,3,Tue Jul 14 05:33:59 2015 UTC,"Just to be clear: Your unintentional draws come when your opponents won't concede but you can't figure out how to actually win the game?  And that's their fault, not yours?"
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,6,Mon Jul 13 15:53:05 2015 UTC,"No. Most of my unintentional draws come from opponents playing very slowly. It definitely takes my deck a while to actually win the game, and I totally understand and support my opponent's right to make me kill them. That's not the problem at all. The problem is people spending 30 seconds thinking about playing a land and passing every turn when I've got Countertop and Jace out.   Miracles shouldn't be that slow of a deck to play. Most of the decisions with Top aren't hard ones. Usually there's one Brainstorm or Top activation per game that requires some thinking.   I've had a lot of opponents tell me that I'm an unusually fast Miracles player, even after we go to time.   EDIT: To give a good example, I was playing a Delver player once. I had Counterbalance and Top out, and he had one card in his hand and no threats in play. He thought about what to do for a full minute, maybe more. Then he cast his card, which turned out to be a Ponder. He spent all that time thinking, then cast a Ponder into an on-board Top and Counterbalance with no other cards in his hand.   That match also went to time. It was frustrating."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,cromonolith,3,Mon Jul 13 16:37:43 2015 UTC,"Your example isn't what I'm talking about though, and isn't what I was referring to.  Your example is ACTUAL slow play, which you can call a judge to come watch and deal with.    I should have been more specific in my original comment.  My mockery was pointed at his statement where he complained about unintentional draws against lands players who wouldn't concede or to stoneblade players when HE couldn't find an answer.  That's not actual slow play, that's your deck not being able to win.  Both things can be true.  There can be slow players, and you can have a responsibility to win in the time allotted."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jeffderek,1 point,Mon Jul 13 18:38:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm definitely fine with the responsibility to win in the time allotted. In no way do I think that the game needs to accommodate my slow-to-win deck.   I'm just saying that in my experience, my opponents being slow is the biggest cause of my games going to time. That's my impression, anyway. If I played Miracles on Magic Online I think I'd be able to be more objective about that."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,cromonolith,3,Tue Jul 14 00:25:35 2015 UTC,"That's not my point.   In the Lands example, G1 is (virtually) over if the Miracles player establishes Top, Counterbalance, and a two. Lands can win from here either via a misplay by Miracles (shuffling their deck when they didn't need to) or by going for a desperation Marit Lage and the Miracles player doesn't have StP or Terminus. That said, the game will go on for a while -- Port makes is hard to resolve an actual win condition, and sometime the game has to be finished via Snapcaster beats or Jace ultimate. Both of which can take some time. Generally, the Lands player should probably concede from this position to get more time in post-board games where the matchup is a lot less lopsided. Obviously this is partly due to the construction of both decks, but I've had several rounds against Lands where I won a very long G1, Lands won a very quick G2, but then didn't have enough time for G3. I'm sure that some of these draws would actually turn into losses if the opponent conceded G1 sooner. In the Stoneblade example, I've drawn games where I had the game locked out but after many shuffles and aggressive cantriping I can't find a wincon. This is certainly the fault of the Miracles deck for playing so few win conditions, but really is just variance."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,jon_boner,10,Mon Jul 13 16:25:21 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying, but you don't seem to realize how ridiculous it is.  You're saying ""I want to build a deck with inevitability, but a very limited number of win conditions, and I want my opponents to assume that I will never make a mistake that will let them back in the game and that I will find my win conditions, and so they should scoop to me instead of making me find the win.""  It's your responsibility to win the game.  If you can't do it in the time allotted because you aren't playing enough win conditions, then play more win conditions.  It's not your opponent's responsibility to scoop when they can only win if you misplay.  From their perspective, if there's still room for you to screw up, why should they just assume you won't?  I've won a LOT of games that I shouldn't have won because my opponent screwed up, and I've lost more than my opponent shouldn't have won because I screwed up.    EDIT: Stoneblade can totally beat miracles, by the way, if you're only playing like 3 jaces and 2 entreats, by simply countering all of the entreats and attacking or pyroblasting the jace, then letting miracles deck themselves.  I've seen it happen.  Just because they'll never attack you to death doesn't mean they don't still have the ability to win the game."

It's not your opponent's responsibility to scoop when they can only win if you misplay.   In principle I agree with you, the opponent should make me (as the miracles/control player) win the game.  However that statement is only OK if the opponent doesn't get salty later for ending the match at 1-0-0 (in my favor) because they decided to do so.  I saw this a lot back in the final days of the verdict/revelation decks in Standard last year -- the ones that had 2x mutavault and 3x Jace, Architect of Thought as a win condition.  I could always tell who were the objectively higher skilled opponents I played against, not just because of their in-game decision making but because after an instant-speed board-wipe into one or two revelations they would just concede and go to game two.   (For what it's worth, I actually added a Jace, Memory Adept to the maindeck of that deck as a concession to the clock and also to players who wouldn't concede.)  I have no sympathy for people who rage at the end of a match they considered to not really be finished because they decided to sit on their ass and do nothing (or tank, uselessly) for 20 minutes while the miracles player made land drops and looked for a win condition or ticked Jace up."

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,thedignityofstruggle,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:38:26 2015 UTC,"Let me preface this with the fact that I play a lot of decks that flat out die to counterbalance; stuff like 43, PSI, DDFT, etc. Yes, it's annoying. Yes, I've lost to counterbalance floating 0, 1, or 2. However, I don't think it should be banned. Miracles is about the third fairest deck in the format by my estimation and as such, can lose to fast combo. It also has very little in the way of actual win conditions, and thus can potentially lose to a random midrange deck or 12post/MUD since both of those have a faster clock than miracles and play big things which are much harder to counterbalance. Miracles is a fair deck in every sense of the phrase. It has gained some amount of extra juice from DTT, which is a much more powerful spell than CB or Top. DTT is also the spell that pushed Omni-Tell over the top as well, due to the fact that they no longer have to run all those clunky cards like Dream Halls and such. DTT doesn't deserve a ban either, it was simply just a sloppy design. Like it or not (I personally don't), the prominence of DTT in decks has caused the metagame to shift in a direction that will push some amount of decks out of the format, while letting others shine. The same thing happened with DRS, and that's still around and not very many people complain about it, despite it making it much more difficult to play graveyard based decks now that ever before. DRS, RIP, etc shifted the meta away from reanimator if I remember correctly, and on a good hand, that deck is even less fun to play against than Miracles or Omnitell because you kinda just sit there while they magicsturbate with Griselbrand or whatever. Miracles at least gives the illusion that you've got a chance for most of the game.  Sorry about the rant/wall of text"

And brainstorm is pretty easy to hate if you wanted to.   Dig through time is not skill intensive. It is pure and raw CA and card selection built into the hardest and most hate-proof frame ever. Soft-counters don't hold it back because delve, spirit of the lab doesn't hold it back because no draw, it's mono-colored (wasteland doesn't hold it back), it's immune to trinisphere and chalice, and you can't reliably counter it with counter-top. It kind of slows down to gravehate, but DRS is not fast enough, and hard gravehate like RiP is too scrarce to make an impact."

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,XVOS,1 point,Wed Jul 15 12:25:53 2015 UTC,"My point is, a bad player with a brainstorm will fail, while a bad player with dig will not. Reasons are - it takes setup, knowledge and pre-meditation to make brainstorm work, partially because there are a lot of counterplays against it, and partially because there are times where you should hold on to the brainstorm. Dig is fool-proof, will work through a lot of hate, and gets you what you want, and you always want to play it whenever you can. So, brainstorm is fine and should not be banned. If you want to ban something - look at DTT."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,Ozy-dead,2,Wed Jul 15 12:35:30 2015 UTC,"Then we should ban show and tell for being a stupid person combo card. And unban Necro because it is skill testing and requires planning.

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,XVOS,2,Wed Jul 15 12:38:13 2015 UTC,I actually would agree with banning show and tell and unbanning necro (and survival of the fittest for the same reason).   Tricky cards usually are easier to hate or play against than stupid-level cards.

The deck is an absolute menace and the reason why vintage sideboards run insane amounts of GY hate. Also arguing that unbanning a card is okay because we can ban other cards is stupid. Arguing that a healthy legacy has everyone devoting more than a third of their sideboard to one deck is also. I'm sorry but did you read this before submitting it.

MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,XVOS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 09:23:42 2015 UTC,"Dredge is definitely not the 'no question best deck in vintage'. In fact, it currently occupies a metagame percentage of much lower than it did a few years ago.   It's the best game 1 deck in Vintage, but it's first to two wins, not first to one. The strength of gravehate these days is ridiculous.  They could ban Grave-Troll, you know. It'd still be a very viable deck, it'd just not be the best deck in Legacy. And we'd have all sorts of graveyard shenanigans available.  I think it'd be fun to unban Necro, Bazaar, Vise, Frantic Search, give it two weeks, then unban Mana Drain."
MTGLegacy,3d4qiw,milesrout,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:01:52 2015 UTC,"If you ask vintage pros they all will say that dredge is no question the best deck in vintage and the only thing containing it is the massive amount of hate every other deck is forced to run. Few vintage decks run less than six pieces of dredge hate and many run as much as ten. Also even with grace troll banned bazaar dredge would break legacy in half. A healthy format does not involve that much hate and vintage has a number of decks that can at least try to race dredge.   As for a format with Necro and bazaar and frantic search (vice doesn't belong in the same sentence imo) that is a very different format than today's legacy and much much less fair. Also mana drain wouldn't be enough to contain those decks because mana drain is in effect a ritual rather than counter magic (the correct spell to counter with it in vintage is generally the first spell with a cost). In vintage the fair decks are very unfair (running vault combo for example) and have tools that simply don't exist in in legacy to combat the true combo decks, as someone who plays both formats I can't say how strongly I disagree with your ideas of what would happen or be healthy. It wouldn't even be entertaining, just stupid. You should play with these cards before you simply dismiss them as being able to be assimilated into legacy. Keep in mind that Necropotence is restricted and still incredibly influential in vintage. The idea that playsets running around in legacy would be meh is crazy."

I would strongly suggest seeing what decks used the card, and how, and the many aspects and facets that bazaar allows people to abuse... It's not just a dredge card. Hell, it was banned in legacy years before dredge even became a mechanic, and before vintage and legacy became what they are now, when there was still the old type 1 and type 1.5 formats with different rules for legality, the strongest deck in 1.5 was a bazaar deck, that obviously did not have dredge.

That's why I play it.  Now I'm certainly not saying it would be a perfectly fine card in the format, but I think the format could absolutely do with something strong operating out of its graveyard.

You could reasonably expect to win a 5 round tournament with it, and it's possible to spike a 7 round tournament with it, but you're also going to 0-2 drop a lot more than you would with a more consistent deck.  All it really takes is playing against something that doesn't lose to Blood Moon and Chalice and your deck really, really starts to suffer.  If you're spending money right now to finish something, I'd highly recommend staying on then Sneak and Show plan.  You can buy the Force of Wills and just play Steam Vents while you save for Volcanics.  Sure, Volcanic is better, but let's be honest, Steam Vents is still a fine dual land.  Since you're gonna probably play or fetch a few more basics than other S&S decks, make sure you play a board blood moon plan to take advantage of your weakness.  I think the mono red sneak attack deck is something fun to do for a week or two, but not really a realistic long term deck to focus on.  If you don't have the budget for multiple decks and screwing around, don't sink any of your limited budget into something so narrow."

Maindeck a full playset of fireblast, that's your finisher.  I would also move at least 2, if not all 3 of your sulfuric vortex to main.  Shuts down all lifegain, and if resolved before the counter-top lock will win you game 1 against miracles.  Also, some ideas for sideboard is vexing shusher.  Another way to get out of the counter-top lock.  Lastly, a fun card to sideboard against any large creature deck like reanimator or s&s is ensnaring bridge.  If they didn't side accordingly a resolved one is an automatic win for you.  Good luck on your next tournaments"
MTGLegacy,3d5dm3,papadrag0n13,3,Mon Jul 13 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Legacy! it rules you had a good time. Don't be disheartened at your showing, a lot of legacy's gameplay involves trying to figure out which deck your opponent is on, which needs some general format experience. Burn is arguably a tier one deck in legacy, even stronger than it is in Modern, so you need to think about your sideboarding and how much you're slowing down your gameplan. Bringing in Smash for Smithereens to blow up your opponent's Top is I think indicative of the kind of misplay you're making; a lot of this will come quickly as you play more games. I've also been kinda blown away by how willing people are to go over matchups and what you could've done differently as a new player, so if the other players at your store are chatty I'd ask them for more sideboard advice.   Your deck looks fine, but not running some number of Swiftspear is probably a mistake. That thing is brutal and four lavamancers is kind of old-school lately.   Your first game was probably against some kind of Stiflenaught, a two-card-combo deck. Bringing in Pyroblasts to counter Stifle is a good way to slow them down, but they have a bigger and better counter suite than you do and can win the war, so racing is probably the better plan. Burn can do some serious burst damage and their big creature isn't that impressive when they're dead.  Not sure about your second game but it might have been some kind of Maverick list? enh, grats on the win  Your countertop opponent never showed you the miracles but they had them the whole time. Because Legacy's converted mana costs are so condensed, Top/Counterbalance basically stops you from being able to cast spells. I don't think you know how to play around Miracles as Burn but I'm also not sure there are a lot of ways to do that. ""Keeping the pressure on"" all game isn't it, though, you want to hold up and then overwhelm their countermagic with a flurry of spells.  round four: it's Legacy and everybody expects the red counter.

There's no safe space for their spells.  Play Needles or Null Rod in the board for miracles and to counteract the tops that combo decks will bring in against you to fight your discard, and make them feel truly awful for playing combo.  I say this as a dedicated lover of combo decks.  There's very little I'd like to face less than a skilled Team America pilot.  EDIT: In general I actually like TA in any unknown room.

MTGLegacy,3d4uup,randomnickname99,2,Mon Jul 13 18:28:22 2015 UTC,That's really heavily anti combo!  I cut down on the spell pierce and hymns for 2x dark confidant and 2x thoughtseize.  Confidant is an all star vs combo.    Also I think you want to run 1 more tropical island and only 1 bayou.  It's more critical to have that dazeable blue source turn 1.  But you'll be fetching the bayou first almost every game.    Sideboard looks pretty similar to mine.  I'd run a little bit more grave hate in that meta though.   Maybe Nihil Spellbomb? Don't lean too heavily on DRS.
MTGLegacy,3d4uup,randomnickname99,2,Mon Jul 13 19:20:17 2015 UTC,"Right, my normal BUG delver is more balanced, this is tuned to make me hate it (I normally play combo).  It's similar to +1 GAngler, +1 Tasigur, +1 Decay, +2 Disfigure, -4 Spell Pierce, -1 Lili with the sb balanced differently.  I'm not 100% on the extra trop over bayou - I agree daze mana is critical obviously great but I usually fetch usea over bayou.  I only need 1 green source in play early on, while I have 6 double black spells (the normal GAngler and Tasigur probably are part of why I lean toward the extra Bayou too).  Nihil is good, just not sure what I'd cut for it.  Maybe +2 Nihil -1 pithing needle, -1 Golgari Charm?"
MTGLegacy,3d4uup,randomnickname99,2,Mon Jul 13 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"Right, my normal BUG delver is more balanced, this is tuned to make me hate it (I normally play combo).  It's similar to +1 GAngler, +1 Tasigur, +1 Decay, +2 Disfigure, -4 Spell Pierce, -1 Lili with the sb balanced differently.   Yeah if you're not playing angler or Tasigur I'd recommend a few Bobs.

Yeah I should have said second!  Usually the best development is Usea, Bayou.  The reason I say the extra trop instead of bayou is that blue and daze are so critical turn 1.  You usually want to fetch your bayou not have it in the opening hand, and rarely need more than 1 (as USea is present) While trop is sort of the opposite.     Nihil is good, just not sure what I'd cut for it.  Maybe +2 Nihil -1 pithing needle, -1 Golgari Charm?   I was going to say -1 needle + 1 bomb.  Charm is too powerful.  Also maybe -1 clique?

Hmm, Golgari Charm is great but I tend to like it the most in more fair matches.  It's obviously awesome vs all x/1s, but not sure how much I like it vs combo that isn't running EtW.  I like clique vs combo in general, but I will be the first to admit I'm not as familar playing TA as I am against it."

If it was less GY based combo I'd lean more towards RUG with the 6 flex being 4x Spell Pierce 2x Flusterstorm.  It's hard to beat 14 counters + wastelands and a clock, but against GY based ones DRS is very nice to have."
MTGLegacy,3d4uup,ashent2,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:38 2015 UTC,"Another thing worth considering is Grixis Control.  I've been playing it since February, and it's insane against combo decks.  The miracles matchup is surprisingly good for a deck without good answers to counterbalance.  I've been enjoying it a lot, but I think I'm liking it over delver mostly because I'm bored of Delver.    If you really want to get spicy, it looks like you'd have no trouble building Grub.  Surprisingly better vs Wasteland than you'd think (although I keep wanting to fit a loam in the board).  It's basically team america with Lightning bolt and pyroblast.  Can't go wrong."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,Noxwalrus,4,Mon Jul 13 04:42:39 2015 UTC,"Since the card doesn't really work with AdN, and it makes us even more susceptible to graveyard hate, I have a hard time imaging it seeing too much play. Maybe 1-2 of them in grinding station builds. Both TES and ANT are too reliant on having AdN as a last resort to dare play it.  The build you're talking about, playing four PiF alongside four DP will have a really hard time postboard, it's a nice thought though.  Regardless of what I've said previously, the card will be fun to experiment with and we'll only have the future to tell us about how well it fits into each respective stormbuild.  Edit: Outside of AdN, what we should be focusing on as it mainly serves as a last resort, DP becomes a card that will be focused by soft counters. The counters will be harder to play around since we don't get the mana until after resolution, which in turn leaves this card as a finishing tutor for the combo turn. It's simply too much of a mana investment for a card that screams ""COUNTER ME"" as soon as you play it, along with the fact that it's easier to have countered than IT or grim.  On the plus side the art is fantastic and it dodges CB flips for days in the miracles matchup. It also let's us tutor without being hellbent."

MTGLegacy,3d3btz,Tvox,2,Mon Jul 13 10:28:06 2015 UTC,"It's simply too much of a mana investment for a card that screams ""COUNTER ME"" as soon as you play it, along with the fact that it's easier to have countered than IT or grim.   Here's the thing - if it was IT you were casting instead, you've already blown almost all of your resources getting Hellbent, either by casting every Ritual in your hand, or discarding the chaff to LED. In this situation, the mana chokepoint you end up in by investing 5 mana initially is largely irrelevant, since a soft counter can just as easily stop you from casting the spell you were about to get with the tutor, and it's unlikely you were going to do anything with the extra 3 mana post-tutor if it gets hit by a hard counter.  These are the situations in which it matters:   You have 2 DPs and are using one to accelerate by finding CR/LED. Pretty bad beats if the first gets countered, but less likely the less DPs we run. You had to crack a Petal that you otherwise could have left sitting on the board had it been an IT. Either way, our tutor got countered, so saving the Petal is a fairly small upside. You were getting a PiF, and would have had the ability to recover and flashback the PiF on a later turn had the tutor not been countered. Probably the biggest downside of DP.   DP is definitely nowhere near the level of IT, but it's counterability isn't as bad of a downside as people are making it out to be."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,TheScynic,-3,Mon Jul 13 18:25:37 2015 UTC,lol dp costs less life then grim off ad nauseam so i think you are wrong
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,treystand,3,Mon Jul 13 06:51:44 2015 UTC,"So you're completely disregarding everything else I wrote as well as holding a condescending tone towards me?  I mean sure, it costs less life than grim, but if you flip a grim you could simply choose not to play it. AdN simply puts it into your hand, and if your deck is built like it should be you're probably able to cast enough cantrips or infernal + LED into tendrils instead.  Point I want to get forward, if you flip grim to AdN you lose three life, barely over a sixth of your starting life total, if you on the other hand flip DP you lose a fourth. In order for grim to cost you more life you also have to play it. It could even be as bad as that you have a hard time flipping the mana sources to play DP without LED mana."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,Tvox,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:46:24 2015 UTC,"I'm actually curious if anyone has done the math on how much GT is likely to cost you on average. That is, in how many situations post-AN do you actually find yourself needing to cast it? It's definitely harder to calculate than the usual AN percentages, and depends a lot more on what you've cast already that game."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,TheScynic,2,Mon Jul 13 18:27:43 2015 UTC,"This sounds unnecessarily condescending, not to mention most ANT builds I've seen in the past couple months run no Grim Tutor.

MTGLegacy,3d3btz,Kidbails,1 point,Mon Jul 13 07:01:06 2015 UTC,"Most ANT lists also aren't running ad naus. Recently, you either have the 2 PiF + 2 Tendrils (or 1 tendrils, 1 empty) grinding station builds, or a more traditional 14/15 cantrip with 1 grim tutor and 0-1 top. In either list DP looks good as there is no ad naus in one, and the other is already running grim tutor."

MTGLegacy,3d3btz,vastros,9,Tue Jul 14 22:01:58 2015 UTC,"So.... Do we even need AdN anymore? I cant remember the last time I used it. It never seems like a better option than PiF. I go to PiF quite literally every game. I've been thinking of dropping AdN, a ponder, and a Petal for 3 DP. Im going to the library to print out proxies of DP tomorrow, and will post results after 20-ish games vs the gamut.  I feel the deck should be called PiFT, partially because thats the sound my son makes every time I storm him. Quite hilarious.  Edit: Stoned dad thoughts about deck names, and being an awesome parent."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,Tvox,4,Mon Jul 13 07:46:25 2015 UTC,"This sounds like an awesome plan, the only problem I see with it is that it makes us even more graveyard reliant. Against active graveyard hate it is a worse diabolic tutor. I mainly play grinding station and have for a while, in which AdN serves as a race card in the sideboard. We need it to beat fast combo more reliantly, so despite the fact that I really like your plan, I don't think you should cut AdN entirely, just put it in the board instead, you'll still need it.  I love the naming though, you seem like a cool father."

Relating to post, my playgroup doesn't like side boarding, so I end up not proxying them out. I'm deciding on what deck to card out right now as i had to  sell off my collection because adulting. Its really down to combo lands and  ""PiFT"". Were i to have a sideboard, it AdN would be in it, not main deck. I dont feel the need for the race aspect. As it is the only times i play ant is vs burn, omni, and dredge, and i rarely have problems racing them with the PiF route. I feel like its safer, easier, and more effective."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,Skelegro93,1 point,Mon Jul 13 08:28:29 2015 UTC,"I think keeping ad Naus in the board is smart, but without it I think you can safely maindeck 2 DP and pull 1 out when you bring in ad Naus. 1 DP hurts less than grim tutor if you were going to hit and cast grim off ad Naus. And if you are just looking for mana or discard, then the chances you hit enough high drops to kill you before finding a single ritual is pretty slim. Even if your first card is DP you will still look at another 10+ cards before you risk killing yourself."
MTGLegacy,3d3btz,vastros,1 point,Mon Jul 13 17:07:36 2015 UTC,I've had a similar thought too. I've always wanted to put DTT in storm just because everyone else is playing it and this just might be the ticket.

Here's a quote from it:   Lets say you have been cantripping and cracking fetches so you have threshold. Now in your hand you have  Dark Petition, Cabal Ritual, Lion's Eye Diamond  If you are familiar with the IGGY-POP combo, then you will quickly catch on to what happens here. Cast Cabal for BBBBB, then DP cracking LED for black so you have BBBBBB. Tutor up Ill-gotten gains, cast and return the same spells to your hand. You can repeat the same loop again, and then the third time crack LED for red, then tutor a burning wish to grab Tendrils and win.   I'm new to ANT and Legacy in general (And I've never heard of IGGY-POP), but that loop seems really powerful.  I like running AdN and flipping a good portion of my deck, but I feel like the combo above requires less cards to be effective.  Thoughts?"

Pre-PiF ANT used to run as many as 3 ad nauseam with IGG as the loop card and zero infernal tutors, but that was back in the day when you could crack LED on upkeep, draw ad Naus and cast it with the LED mana. Once that changed they added IT to combo with LED but still usually ran 2 or so ad Naus with 1 IGG. Once PiF was printed IGG was a sb card at best. PiF is just much more consistent even if you can't get back LEDs."

I've been playing it in Tournament Practice online for the last few days and am like 14-2 in matches against real decks or something similarly ridiculous.   I'm hesitant to start playing with DP since it's blank until you're actively trying to storm out and makes us weaker against soft counters, but I'm definitely excited to see how people like it. TES players should just put one in the board and stop boarding out Infernal Tutor, but it's really not cellar how we should best use it, or how many copies we want and how it affects the rest of the build."

MTGLegacy,3d58wo,jeffderek,6,Mon Jul 13 18:47:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know that I'd agree with that.  In the past they've been open to other fan-created formats.  EDH was entirely created by other people and they've opened up and accepted it.  Gavin Verhey even created Overextended before Modern existed, and got stores to run tournaments, and they didn't shut it down and even ended up hiring Gavin.  There's no reason to believe that they'd immediately shut you out, and nothing to lose from asking them.    It's not like this is going to go under their radar.  If you're successful, and they don't like it, they'll come after you.  So why not ask?  You're much better off knowing directly from them whether it would be OK than hoping you're on firm legal ground and going ahead.  If you get bad legal advice, or they decide to try and shut you down anyway even though you're in the right, you'll have a big fight ahead of you that you should be aware of before starting."

Especially to support the therapies. 19 is too many lands, even with the wastes.  When you cut badlands replace it with a spell, not a land.

MTGLegacy,3d12xx,spoc351,7,Sun Jul 12 17:24:02 2015 UTC,You want to start dredging pretty much immediately. The idea behind running LED is that you can cast faithless looting then flashback immediately and hopefully dredge a large chunk of you library on t1 or t2. I play LED dredge lots on MTGO my username is the same as reddit so hit me up if you wanna play the mirror match.
MTGLegacy,3d12xx,bleedth3sky,5,Sun Jul 12 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"My buddy plays Led dredge, I've seen him draw like twice."
MTGLegacy,3d12xx,Rio_Bravo,5,Sun Jul 12 20:22:12 2015 UTC,Anytime you don't need to draw a non-GY card from your deck. Need a land? Don't dredge. Need a Sideboard card? Don't dredge.
MTGLegacy,3d12xx,mtgkoby,4,Sun Jul 12 20:23:57 2015 UTC,"whenever there isn't hate in play probably. unless you know your only out is to draw and cast a looting spell/LED that turn, just dredge."
MTGLegacy,3d12xx,InkmothNexus,2,Sun Jul 12 18:38:55 2015 UTC,"Do you feel you have everything you need to win the game already in your graveyard? ie Bridges, Ichorids + cards to exile. If so you can stop dredging if you'd like. Most of the time you will want to dredge in your draw step. If you don't want to Dredge in your draw step its most likely because either A: you need to draw into a piece of anti-hate or B: you're worried about decking yourself."
MTGLegacy,3d12xx,gibbousm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:10:00 2015 UTC,...always?
MTGLegacy,3d12xx,alomomola,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:13:45 2015 UTC,Draw when you have no dredge or have so few cards you cannot dredge. There are so very few occasions where you should not dredge. Always think of your yard as your hand. More cards in your yard the better your options are.
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,_sandcastle,8,Sun Jul 12 17:29:58 2015 UTC,"Casting a 3-mana Elf-Grey-Ogre doesn't seem like a great bonus option, so I think in general this is comparable to Lotus Petal, which is not really something Elves wants. Elves is a combo deck, but it's bottleneck is not mana. It wants to build up on this turn, and then that one, and then go off. I'd much rather have a Forest that I can use turn after turn, especially if I don't know what the rest of my hand is. It's not Belcher."
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,SarahPMe,3,Sun Jul 12 17:46:22 2015 UTC,"To be fair, you can cast it to continue a glimpse chain, and it does make you faster at times. Plus, its still an elf"
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,tresle101,3,Sun Jul 12 18:21:59 2015 UTC,"That being said, I would not play 4 of them in elves"
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,tresle101,2,Sun Jul 12 18:22:25 2015 UTC,And none of that really matters.
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,CheddarOps,2,Sun Jul 12 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"you can cast it to continue a glimpse chain   Just like you can cast whatever you're taking out for it to continue a glimpse chain, except not for 3 mana."
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,milesrout,0,Mon Jul 13 23:54:51 2015 UTC,"I just looked at some list, mine is way outdated. What happened to reagle force?!?"
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,tresle101,3,Tue Jul 14 00:19:53 2015 UTC,"Some elf lists run Priest of Titania, and in these cases they want ESG too, to enable a turn 1 Priest.  Way back a few years ago, Survival of the Fittest was legal and running ESG to play out an earlier Survival was very useful.    Today's Natural Order builds don't really need it however."
MTGLegacy,3d14cw,mtgkoby,2,Sun Jul 12 20:25:35 2015 UTC,Honestly it would not only make the deck less consistent but also slow the deck down. I mean yes it makes it more likely that you can natural order turn 2 but that likely is not what you'd want to do because it'd be hard to have enough elves that are untapped and not summoning sick. With glimpse you are much more likely to stop a chain because you can't cast esg rather than continue a chain because you got an extra mana from esg. That being said it could be an interesting one of just to keep your opponent on their toes.

MTGLegacy,3czixj,InkmothNexus,2,Sun Jul 12 17:15:57 2015 UTC,"when playing oops last time I found a manaless dredge player; at first I thought it weird when they were really scared when I cast Balustrade Spy then when I targeted myself they had a big sigh of relief only to die turn 1 to my combo. The next game, they elected to go second which gave me enough information to figure what they were playing so, turn 1 I just targeted them for the win.   so to add to what others have said about a creature, maybe you want a single land too to stem the bleeding ;) That being said, maybe I do too."
MTGLegacy,3czixj,volrathxp,2,Sun Jul 12 12:21:17 2015 UTC,"no, if you want to beat oops when they're feeling clever and targetting you, boarding in a single self-reshuffler does it. You get to put your entire deck into your graveyard, then put one card back, so the oops player is just dead when they pass turn."

Because if you can actually hit 4 mana and get your spy/informer active, don't you just win? No need to be cute and risk auto-losing to a shuffle when you can just freely win (especially on the play against manaless dredge, what are they going to do about your combo win?)"

MTGLegacy,3cyifs,Sir_Laser,8,Sun Jul 12 11:53:27 2015 UTC,"I would highly, highly recommend going with Elves.  1) Between the two, Elves is kind of in a game-space all it's own. Meaning a year from now, two years from now, Elves will still be the best at what it does. Maybe some new build will be favored (I like the idea of bouncing the new Shaman of the Pack back and forth from your hand for a sideboard non-attack win-con), maybe it will be Tier 1 or 1.5 in that month's meta, but it will be viable, legal, and any reasonable variation you could run of it will more or less function on the same foundation you bought into in 2015.  Show and Tell is in a much different situation. Sneak and Show is on top, then Omnitell is (currently, playing S&S over Omni is a little silly). If DTT gets banned, or something the meta simply shifts, Omnitell's role could easily get usurped not only by other Show and Tell builds, but by other decks that work in a similar cantrip 2-card blue combo space. It very much lives in that portion of the meta where new cards enter and/or get banned. Heck, in 3 months maybe Show and Tell decks won't even have a good reason to run a creature.  2) Of the two decks, Elves is the deck with the more satisfying skill ladder. Both Elves and Show and Tell decks, like basically all Legacy decks (with maybe one or two fringier exceptions) have some response to your respective skill level (which admittedly isn't a linear variable, but let's treat it like it is for sake of simplicity). While Show and Tell decks have their own varied and interesting play decisions, Elves is a deck that really responds extremely well to your ability to read and adapt to various situations and probabilities, and while this is subjective, just makes it a much more satisfying deck to master."
MTGLegacy,3cyifs,RELcat,3,Sun Jul 12 00:55:43 2015 UTC,"Elves is also much more difficult, IMO, since there often time exist the possibility of going off T2 and winning right there. S&T is much more binary - 3 mana or nothing."

MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:57:07 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't it be hilarious if they banned Brainstorm and blue was still just default the best color no questions asked?     Well of course it still would be. It's the only color with meaningful stack interaction and the best card manipulation. The rationale for banning Brainstorm isn't to nerf blue beyond recognition, it's to open up the possibility for other engines and synergistic cards/decks to compete beyond the ones that are driven by Brainstorm + fetches.    That being said, I have come to terms with the realization it's never getting banned. However, by any measure, it is a bannable card -- or at least discussable."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,notaprisoner,2,Sun Jul 12 23:05:58 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Two things are true.   By any objective measure, Brainstorm deserves to be banned.  It is present in a ridiculous number of decks, even if those decks have diversity within themselves, for the most part deck selection revolves around ""what should I play with brainstorm in it"" or ""how does my deck beat brainstorm""? A large enough contingent of legacy players, including those who work for Wizards itself, have decided that they are OK with this situation, and that they would rather have a format where they can play 4 brainstorms than have a ""fixed"" version of legacy.   So while I will argue to anyone who enjoys argument for sport that Brainstorm should be banned, I have no expectation of it happening.  I will also continue to register only Brainstorm decks at tournaments I want to win."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 23:11:21 2015 UTC,"Small question here: Do you believe that a card being present in ""a ridiculous number of decks"" is reason to ban any card?  Would you consider that there are people against brainstorm's banning because they think a banning exists for another reason entirely?"
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,Timiniel,0,Mon Jul 13 14:35:30 2015 UTC,"I believe that if every deck in the format either plays a card or is specifically built to hate on that card that the format is warped around that card.  To me, if the format warps around a card, that is a good reason to ban it.    I realize that's not everyone's opinion, but it's the criteria I use.  I think banning exists not to keep specific cards from getting out of control, but to keep the format open and interesting and evolving.  If a format gets too stale or is too focused around a single card, then banning is something that can keep things moving.    What reason do you think banning exists for?"
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,0,Mon Jul 13 15:42:57 2015 UTC,"What reason do you think banning exists for?   To increase diversity, or most likely in practice, to prevent a single card or strategy from reducing diversity in deck strategies. It is the only reason why bans should exist in my eyes.  EDIT: For clarification, I do not think that bans should occur if a format gets ""stale"" or ""too focused around a single card"", as long as there is still a high diversity among strategies. If we had to choose between  A) a metagame with 60 decks presenting 30 different strategies (example: grouping up all tendrils decks as storm strategies, all delver decks as delver strategies, etc) and all decks (as in 100% of the decks) played 4 copies of one card or B) a metagame with 30 decks presenting 15 different strategies where no card is played in more than 20% of the decks, my choice would obviously be ""A""."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,Timiniel,0,Mon Jul 13 16:14:25 2015 UTC,"OK, but that's a false dichotomy.  What if you could choose between  A. 60 decks presenting 30 different strategies  B. 30 decks presenting 15 different strategies where no card is played in more than 20% of the decks  C. 60 decks presenting 30 different strategies where no card is played in more than 20% of the decks.  For the record, I think 20% is an impossibly low number, as there will always be great cards.  I'd settle for 50%, honestly.  But MTG Goldfish has Brainstorm at 73.54%.  That's ridiculous.  Beyond that, I personally feel that the current ban policy DOES ""reduce diversity in deck strategies"".  Sure, Reanimator, OmniTell, Storm, Delver, Miracles, etc are all very different decks, but the way the format is currently built Aggro and Prison, two traditional archetypes, are completely unrepresented.  I guess you could count Death and Taxes as prison?  If you really wanted to.  But there's no equivalent of Stacks or Enchantress, no equivalent of Zoo or Affinity.  No one card is responsible for that, obviously, it's a natural evolution of not maintaining the ban list for years (up until the cruise ban we were in the middle of the longest period in legacy history without a ban).  So I agree that deck diversity is important, but I think that just because there are 15 different viable combo decks and 6 different viable delver decks doesn't mean that the format is as diverse as it could be.  It could be better."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,0,Mon Jul 13 16:24:52 2015 UTC,"It wouldn't be all Zoo vs Maverick though   The funny thing about this is that most of the fair non-blue decks people mention when they talk about banning Brainstorm -- like, say, Maverick -- are good (when they're good) primarily because they prey on blue decks."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,ubernostrum,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:57:51 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that's because there haven't been any nonblue decks that didn't prey on blue decks in a long time.

MTGLegacy,3cxbit,notaprisoner,10,Sun Jul 12 22:59:16 2015 UTC,"I expect no bans.   They should unban Black Vise because it won't really do much in the current meta and I feel with Dig Through Time everywhere Mind Twist would actually be fairly safe to unban. I'd love to see Terminus get the hammer because then creature based aggro decks would make a comeback. Zoo has been pretty nonexistent for the last 2-3 years and while Terminus isn't the only thing preventing Zoo from returning, it certainly is one of the biggest reasons.  If Dig is still a problem when Battle for Zendikar rolls out then it might see a ban."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,gibbousm,5,Sat Jul 11 22:05:41 2015 UTC,"Terminus isn't the only nail in the coffin of Zoo decks, although it doesn't help.  Fast combo decks are also strong against Zoo, unless they're playing blue and enough blue cards to cast Force."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,alcaizin,10,Sat Jul 11 23:56:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Several years ago combo decks were a turn slower and could be raced by zoo.    ANT - Ill Gotten Gains was the backup plan to Ad Nauseam.  This meant that doing a bunch of damage quickly could shut down the main combo.  Now Past in Flames is the primary plan and it doesn't care what the life total is when you start.  Reanimator - once you got your creature you still had to win.  Blazing archon could get pathed or swordsed.  Jin gitaxias gave you a turn to empty your hand.  But now the primary way of winning involves a giant lifelinker.  Show and Tell - the fastest combo was show and tell into emrakul, but the backup plan was progenitors or blight steel, cards that won quickly but still had to pass the turn after putting something into play.  Omniscience now means you win the turn you go off.  Obviously there were nut draws before and there are bad draws now, but on average all of the combo decks have gotten dramatically more resistant to aggro."

MTGLegacy,3cxbit,PM_ME_KATY_PERRY,8,Sat Jul 11 16:41:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty much this. I could see a DTT ban because we are seeing a lot of maindeck REB effects.

MTGLegacy,3cxbit,randomnickname99,9,Sat Jul 11 22:33:15 2015 UTC,"I'm not convinced it's Omnitell that's pushing the other combo decks out.  It's the fact that the maindeck combo hate cards hurt omnitell less than other decks.  Storm has a lot more trouble beating Counterbalance, Eidolon, and Thalia than Omnitell does.  Sure, they're all a pain in the butt, but not to the same extent."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,2,Sat Jul 11 23:47:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I didn't mean that omni is making other combo non-viable, it's just much better than the others at this time so there's no reason to play other combo."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,randomnickname99,4,Sun Jul 12 04:14:54 2015 UTC,"Right, but I don't think it's better than storm in the abstract, I think it's better than storm because of the hate storm is currently facing."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,-2,Sun Jul 12 04:25:09 2015 UTC,Cruise actually opened up metagame imo. I was super surprised that it was banned. It was during that time that MAVERICK won a SCG open.

I have a hard time believing that they could print a permanent that bumps it to tier one without DTT. Emrakul and omniscience are both pretty good there.  I'm a bit confused by your comment here vs your last comment. They seem kind of inconsistent."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,alomomola,0,Sun Jul 12 21:57:09 2015 UTC,"My point is that Show and Tell is the source problem. The current incarnation of that problem is Omnitell, and while DTT made Omnitell tier-1, banning DTT just pushes the problem to the future. It may not be Omnitell in the future, it may be some incarnation of Sneak and Show, or revolve around some entirely new card Wizards wants to print for casuals that becomes ridiculous when you don't have to pay mana for it (either because you Showed it into play or because you cast it off Omniscience, etc.)."
MTGLegacy,3cxbit,matunos,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:13 2015 UTC,"Okay that makes sense. But I think u disagree with you banning show and tell because I don't think it's a problematic card by itself. Without some kind of HUGE dig/search spell It's not as oppressive as pod was in modern to warrant that sort of limiting ban. I think it's a fun deck that a lot of people like, and doesn't need to be completely killed that way because with a bit of a limit (banning DTT) its totally reasonable, and other permanents don't change that.  It's by nature a combo deck, that's true.  But it's not so fast or consistent a combo deck to need to be completely kicked out of the format."

MTGLegacy,3cxbit,jeffderek,0,Sun Jul 12 05:07:46 2015 UTC,"No, they are not draw spells.   Brainstorm is great, but it's not a gameplan by itself, even in the decks that use it the best. It's more of a variance reducer that smooths everything out, similar to the fetch-dual manabase system. DTT, on the other hand, is an actual gameplan - lots of decks now have the simple plan of ""cast a bunch of cantrips, cast Dig --> profit"".    ""So your point is that the 4th most common blue card selection spell in the format is the one causing the problem?""   Yes.   Just like that time treasure cruise (most likely the 4th most common blue spell in the format) was causing all the problems. Remember that?

MTGLegacy,3cxj8j,fivestarstunna,2,Sat Jul 11 17:56:17 2015 UTC,"If your problem is ""My miracles matchup is bad"" I don't think stoneforge is the way to solve it.  You have a couple of common options.   Null Rod/Pithing Needle naming top.  This makes setting up terminus a LOT more difficult. Krosan Grip to hit top or CBalance.  You can also play decay just for balance, which has more versatility because it hits delvers and lavamancers and stuff, but I'd want to have rod or needle available if that were your plan because you need an answer for top. Gaddock Teeg.  Shuts off Natural Order and Green Sun, so it's one hell of a clunky card, but it also stops Force, Jace, and most importantly Terminus. Ruric Thar.  They're gonna need to have the answer in hand to not lose to him, because they can't cantrip to find it.   If you want some less common options,    Splash blue instead of black.  Play Envelop.  Good against Show and Tell, Infernal Tutor, and Terminus.  Bad turns 1 or 2 because you can't hold mana open effectively.  If you do this, make sure you play 2 Birchlore Rangers to give you another blue source. Buried Alive for 3 Vengevines.  Rough versus Terminus/Swords to Plowshares, unfortunately, so probably not a good idea, but this used to be the sideboard plan for Elves against the wrath decks.  It may be possible to build it to work this way so you can combo off, force them to terminus, then the next turn you play two elves and attack with the Vengevines that have been waiting, making them have a second terminus.

MTGLegacy,3cy0ep,MTGCardFetcher,2,Sun Jul 12 00:55:48 2015 UTC,"Short answer: I wouldn't.    Long answer: Stone Rain/Pillage is simply too slow in this format.  I'm positive of this because of the amount of time I've spent trying to make Sinkhole good.  If sinkhole is too slow (and it is), then Pillage is definitely too slow."
MTGLegacy,3cy0ep,jeffderek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:19:58 2015 UTC,"Pillage is not really my recommendation because of the land destroy effect but because of the equipment destroy effect . the land denial effect allows the card to be playable outside of the sideboard, so you have artifact destruction main deck.   I wanted a build with Pillage to kill Batterskull"
MTGLegacy,3cy0ep,jeffderek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:27:02 2015 UTC,"I understand your premise here, I just disagree that it will actually work.  If you want artifact destruction maindeck, splash another color so you can play a maindeckable artifact removal spell.  Play Manic Vandal or Torch Fiend or . . I dunno, something.  I don't think 1RR stone rain actually makes the card playable in legacy, even if it's upside is destroying batterskulls when your opponent doesn't hold up 3 mana.  It's particularly bad at killing batterskulls because it's a sorcery, so they can still use their mana every turn and play around it by holding up 3 during your turn."
MTGLegacy,3cy0ep,jeffderek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:33:01 2015 UTC,that's true I didnt think of that . They still need to pay 2 mana to cast it . If it's in your hand maybe you can get it
MTGLegacy,3cy0ep,Sir_Laser,1 point,Mon Jul 13 13:05:39 2015 UTC,"There will be definitely moments where it works out and you can get it.  But think of a typical batterskull line.  T2: Play Stoneforge  T3: Pass with 3 mana up and stoneforge untapped.  On your end step, pay 2 to put batterskull into play  T4: Attack with batterskull, pass with 4 mana untapped.  That line leaves you no opportunity to pillage the batterskull.  Now sure, sometimes on T4 they'll attack with batterskull and then play some other spell, like Jace (in stoneblade) or flickerwisp/crusader/etc in D&T.  And in those instances you'll get to cast pillage.  But once they've seen that you're a 4 pillage deck, do you think you'll get another chance at that if they can help it?    The card is just far too easy to play around.  Even something as simple as a Torch Fiend, which is an on board trick, is theoretically more maindeckable than pillage, and I'm in no rush to cast Torch Fiend in legacy.  If you really want to beat Batterskulls game one in a burn style deck, I think the better plan is to play cards that make sure stoneforge never cheats the batterskull into play, and win before they can cast it on 5.  This is part of why burn plays all the Searing Blazes/Bloods now.  You can throw burn at stoneforge and it doesn't substantially slow your clock.  If you're really concerned about it, play Char, Flame Javelin, or Stoke the Flames, so you can kill the germ token.  In most circumstances if you spend one spell to destroy the token they'll be dead before they can bounce and recast."

MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,Freshism,11,Sat Jul 11 01:45:27 2015 UTC,I kind of think of Jund Depths as the line between Pox and Lands. Lillies and Punishing Fires and more Entombs are probably better than Sink Holes and Hymns.
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,Manaplease,3,Sat Jul 11 04:27:36 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of this, from back before the legend rule changed.  I feel like the glaring hole is Liliana of the Veil.  She's so important to controlling both hand and board.  The other card I've always found is important in a delver meta is Innocent Blood.  Smallpox is insane if it resolves turn 2 against them, but you can't always play it around daze effectively.  Blood helps you stay ahead long enough to cast Smallpox.  The way pox deals with opposing topdecks is by removing the ability to cast their spells.  Just keep loaming and wasting and sinkholing and you'll be fine."
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,jeffderek,1 point,Sat Jul 11 05:04:45 2015 UTC,"So I should run the Innocent Bloods main deck? Also, what would I replace with Liliana? Everything seems so crucial to the deck. The Sylvan Libraries and Maelstrom Pulse are probably at the top of the chopping block though, but I really love the card selection the library gives."
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,Slothrob,5,Sat Jul 11 10:11:50 2015 UTC,"I think Innocent Blood in the side is fine, Toxic Deluge should also be there (it's really important against Elves).   The real glaring absence in this list is Tabernacle though.   If you shave an Urborg and a Library for Barren Moors,  and the other Library for another Entomb, you should be able to reasonably reliably get the Loam engine on line that will give you card selection as good or better than running Libraries."
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,jeffderek,1 point,Sat Jul 11 10:49:30 2015 UTC,"I've played with Barren Moor in the past and while it can be helpful, it feels clunky. Pox is kind of a clunky deck anyways, and I was trying to streamline that with the Libraries. I'm going to play this list as it is this Wednesday and will try with the Barren Moor the next week."
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,jeffderek,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:33:21 2015 UTC,"I like 1 or 2 bloods maindeck.  I'd also be cutting the crop rotations.  They're card disadvantage and you're a grindy deck with enough card disadvantage already.  You'll find the combo if you just keep digging.  I'd probably do something like  -1 Maelstrom Pulse -3 Crop Rotation -1 Mox Diamond  for 3 Lilianas and 2 Innocent Blood, or maybe 4 and 1.  Also I really like 1 Worm Harvest in the side for the Miracles matchup, they don't have good answers for it and they do have good answers for Marit Lage and Nether Spirit."
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,zitical,1 point,Sat Jul 11 13:57:01 2015 UTC,"Y'know, I've never actually ran Worm Harvest and I don't know why. I'll be searching for a copy."
MTGLegacy,3cv9yw,TheWorldMayEnd,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:35:16 2015 UTC,It's a great card for grindy matchups that can answer Marit Lage . . . which is basically Miracles.  But it's a good tool to have.  It's too slow for Delver and friends.
MTGLegacy,3cv5pv,USERP131,7,Sat Jul 11 01:07:33 2015 UTC,"What were they used in before? What deck would use them? It's not like Faerie Tribal is a Legacy deck. Miracles is the only place it seems worth considering them, and the creature suite there is already pretty solid (in the versions with creatures). What do you cut for it? Venser?   SSS would almost certainly be competing with Snapcaster (which is much more flexible) for a spot in any given 75."
MTGLegacy,3cv5pv,wintermute93,6,Sat Jul 11 01:28:46 2015 UTC,They've seen play before. FaerieNinjaStill used to be a thing.
MTGLegacy,3cv5pv,thefringthing,2,Sat Jul 11 14:10:19 2015 UTC,"I figured snappy killed it off, but I was not sure. Most decks ran minimal fae's but it usually ran 4 spellstutters and 2 cliques and that was it if I recall. Sometimes 2 sowers. Mainly the SSS was used to carry jitte and counter 1 drops."
MTGLegacy,3cv5pv,wintermute93,12,Sat Jul 11 01:34:02 2015 UTC,"Ah, okay, yep. I went and looked it up on mtgtop8, and sure enough, SSS/Clique/SFM was the preferred creature suite of UW Stoneblade circa 2011, and then was pretty much never seen again.

MTGLegacy,3cv5pv,the_n00b,2,Sat Jul 11 23:03:59 2015 UTC,"Sure, but what I'm saying is that Delver warped the meta far more than snapcaster does which probably had more to do with the decrease in SSS play than the presence of snapcaster does."
MTGLegacy,3cv5pv,wintermute93,2,Sun Jul 12 03:33:22 2015 UTC,"Disagree. If Snapcaster had not been printed but Delver was, people would still be playing SSS.

All those Clique/SSS/SFM decks wouldn't switch to Clique/Delver/SFM for the same reason that UWR is the worst current Delver variant."

MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,CannedPears1,10,Fri Jul 10 20:42:55 2015 UTC,"I remember in the lead up to GP NJ, there were a fair amount of Maverick placing in the trials and posted GPT results. It does what it does well, so it'll always be a deck, but I haven't seen anybody win with it recently.  It's problem is it has a bad matchup versus EOT Terminus, untap Jace. But when I briefly played it in paper, I always felt like I could chew up the greedy decks because of the toolbox answers. I've noticed the MTGO meta shifting into more MUD, 4c Delver, and other decks that try to play an ""unfair fair game"". Decks that aren't combo fast, but still trying to do things like t2 Lodestone, or have 4 different dual lands out on t4. So I do think that the deck is poised for a comeback.   In the end, play what you want. You can win games with the deck. The tools are there to beat Miracles if that is the one matchup you can't win. It gives a lot of tool for an experienced pilot to abuse, so it rewards an investment in learning the deck. Go for it, live the dream."

MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,jackson_mcp,2,Sun Jul 12 04:09:03 2015 UTC,"Teeg, Thalia, pridemage main deck to name a few"
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,Dwellonthis,5,Sun Jul 12 22:29:06 2015 UTC,"I started off legacy with Maverick and still enjoy the deck. I think it is very viable, but very matchup dependent. I liked playing Green Sun Zenith/Gaddock Teeg/and KoTR. Grinding out games with wasteland and knight was fun, but you have to make some concessions. For me, I was okay with conceding to combos like storm. It's not that the matchup is unwinnable, but it you have to go turn 2 Thalia or Gaddock Teeg to have a shot. Miracles is also very tough because of terminus. Gaddock Teeg is an all star in the match up. If you go Turn 1 Mother of runes, Turn 2 Gaddock Teeg you have a shot. Delver/jund is a good match up. Having your ooze+wasteland makes land ok, but not great. And that it basically how I would describe the deck. It's fine, just not great. You have game agasint almost everything IF you can get it set up in time. DRS and Ooze give you some outs to Dredge, Thalia+Teeg basically help you in every match up. I don't think Mother of Runes is bad against anything (fine, storm). Sometimes you don't get that time. I've lost a lot of game I was ahead on board but then my opponent drew something like a brainstorm/dig through time and your cards just aren't as good as those. I would suggest playing a ""dark"" build with the jund/stage combo in it, just to end games out of nowhere. If you don't have that, expect to face a lot of grindy matchups. I wouldn't be surprised is maverick got some new tools in the coming years though. They aren't reprinting brainstorm anytime soon, but they will continue to make busted green creatures, hopefully. I think you should ask yourself why you want to play legacy. Is it to win high level tournaments or have fun every few weeks at your local LGS? If it's the latter, Maverick is great (and affordable). If you want to win GPs and SCG events, you might consider playing something else."
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,wcs15,2,Sat Jul 11 03:20:17 2015 UTC,"Not sure what world where Jund is a good matchup for Maverick. LotV and Punishing Fire absolutely wreck Maverick. I haven't seen a non-Punishing version of Jund in a long, long time."
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,Sonicpulsar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 03:24:40 2015 UTC,"I never really found punishing fire that big of a deal. Yes, some of your creatures die to their removal, but Knights are too big and both ooze and DRS help you shut off the engine. You also run 4 wasteland, so unless they are running Loam, it's hard for them to get the grove+fire combo. It's actually the Abrupt decay that is the most annoying and that's just a part of legacy. Mother of Runes gives you an edge they don't have and stretches their removal. Unless they have a turn 2 LoTV, it can actually be okay to play against since you can often fetch for a dryad arbor or have something to sac. I tried running Voice of Resurgence because it was good against UR Delver when that was the on top (on the fence about whether it's good or not overall) so that gave me some game against LoTV too. Something to consider if you're expecting jund."
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,wcs15,1 point,Sat Jul 11 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"Sure, you'll win some games against Punishing Jund but they're easily favored. I'd call it somewhere in the 70/30 - 60/40 range. They save their Abrupt Decays for your KotR, answer your Moms as soon as possible and LotV you out of the game. Their discard doesn't tend to help either. Most G1 Maverick lists only run StP as removal (some run Abrupt Decay, but not many). Jund has a lot of must answer threats (DRS, Goyf, sometimes Bob). It's just not a good matchup for Maverick."
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,Sonicpulsar,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:29:28 2015 UTC,I've never had a problem with Punishing Jund.  Your guys generally get too big to meat-grinder out like they do with Death and Taxes and they absolutely cannot answer Sigarda.  Combine that with 7 pieces of spot removal main (StP + Decay) and a sweep or two in the side and Jund can have a very bad time if they don't draw the right portion of their deck on time.
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,wdingo,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:13:14 2015 UTC,"Most Dark Maverick lists I've seen don't run Abrupt Decay maindeck. It's such a feel bad card when you're running Thalia (4 StPs, 2-3 Abrupt Decays, 3-4 GSZ)."
MTGLegacy,3cu8yd,Sonicpulsar,2,Sat Jul 11 22:30:55 2015 UTC,"I go back and forth between 3 Decay or Thoughtseize main.  Right now the meta has been heavy Delver and the Decays are required.  If it swings back to combo it'll be TS main and Decay in the side.  That being said, it is very rare that I don't have the mana advantage on my opponent (with the five dorks and cradle) so usually it's not the worst nonbo in the world.  It's a necessary evil -  she's our best card against combo and the T2 Deathrite, into Thalia, into Wasteland, waste you is probably one of the best lines of play available to Maverick."

The deck has access to ghetto Force of Will ([[Disrupting Shoal]]), Delver, lots of cheap cantrips, Tarmogoyf, and cheap counters. It's just a very shitty Legacy deck pretending to be a Modern deck.

I was initially thinking more of what existing Modern deck, but ""very shitty Legacy deck pretending to be a Modern deck"" is a cool angle.  Given that RUG Delver isn't a staple deck in Modern, but things like Twin, Abzan, and Grishoalbrand are, I wonder which would fare better: a tier-1 existing Modern deck, or a tier-1 existing Legacy deck knocked down a bunch of tiers by the Modern restriction.  Of course, this is a weird hypothetical question, and asking here may be a bit off topic since half the question is about Modern, really (!) but I do like your answer!"

It's a deck that needs a critical mass of cards to do much, like many ramp decks (needs mana + gas).  Hymn should be pretty disruptive if you can stop what they're trying to do on the first turn or so.  Needle is fine against him, you can either proactively name cards you don't want to see, or name something on the board if you're still in the game.  Deluge is medium good, if you think you have a lot of dead cards it's an okay board-in.  Your life total isn't usually under too much pressure in the matchup."

MTGLegacy,3cq7px,lord_mcdonalds,2,Fri Jul 10 16:19:11 2015 UTC,"Would cut Sylvan, 1-2 Jace and 0-1 Deluge,   Sylvan is a card for the grindy fair-er matchups, this MU is won and lost by big turn 2-4 plays (3sphere>Lodestone, DRS>Hymn>Wasteland), and tapping out turn 2 for sylvan while your opponent drops a lodestone, 3 sphere, etc just straight up feels bad  Jace is cuttable, not sure if you want to cut all of them (maybe shave just 1), for the same reason as sylvan, it also can be hard to cast against MUD decks (reaching 4 mana against any prison/denial strategy can be rough) however, it is a win condition, and is especially good if you are forced into the slow DRS/Shardless beats while they are top decking  Deluge is hit and miss imo, as there aren't many creatures it kills, and it can be rough to cast while being pressured by a lodestone + sphere-effect, but conversely, you don't have anyway to kill Lodestone (and sometimes have to), you're probably keeping lilly though, and they likely have only 1-2 creatures at a given time so you probably don't need it, but I guess that depends on how much you value jace."

MTGLegacy,3cpi2a,MASTICATOR_NORD,2,Thu Jul 9 20:27:50 2015 UTC,"I've pondered something similar. I envision it as being like the combo version sans the combo and naturally falling into the secondary plan of swarm the board and grind people out with Wirewood Symbiote + Elvish Visionary. Except now we have Shaman of the Pack and Bloodbraid Elf whose ETB abilities we can abuse.  So you can take out the Glimpse of Nature, Natural Order package, and Heritage Druid in favor of BBE and some more interactive elements.  Also, with less of a need to make a lot of mana, we can replace Gaea's Cradle with Cavern of Souls.  I think the core of a deck like this would be:   Deathrite Shaman Elvish Visionary Shaman of the Pack Bloodbraid Elf Wirewood Symbiote"
MTGLegacy,3cpi2a,Cyclone306,3,Thu Jul 9 21:49:25 2015 UTC,"As an elves player I cannot endorse this. If you can't generate loads of mana, abusing the best friends team costs lots of tempo. If you really want to abuse BBE, punishing jund is a much better shell as you're not going to be cascading into, GSZ, wirewood symbiote, mana dorks, nettle sentinel etc.   Sure you can cascade into visionary but in P.Jund you cascade into Liliana's, rabblemasters, hymns and other higher impact spells. Elves is built around synergy which makes it less desirable for cascade on BBE. It's probably better to slot SHaman of the pack into a regular elves shell.   This would be much better as it would give the deck a way to win outside of the attack step.   I like hybrids but you are missing what makes elves a good deck in the first place.   Also you would need to entirely rework the mana base, including upping the amount of lands, as you're raising the curve significantly."

MTGLegacy,3cp54v,Satanarchrist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:52:27 2015 UTC,"Pretty much.  I've pondered a Knights deck many times, and I think everything that is even remotely interesting is Modern legal.  The big draws to a Knight deck in my opinion are...   Playing Knight of the Reliquary Playing Hakkon + Nameless Inversion Life from the Loam to both put Knight cards in the yard, while getting back cool lands and making Reliquary bigger.   The downsides are numerous.     Beyond Reliquary, Hakkon, and Inversion, all the Knights suck. No creatures worth playing cost 1 or 2. There are only 2 lords, they eat Lightning Bolts all day, and they are awful.  One is 1WW 2/2 that gives other Knights +1/+1 and Indestructible, and the other is a 3W 2/2 that gives other Knights doublestrike."

It tries to unbalance the mana denial strategy by using cards like Preeminent Captain to cheat large threats like Captain of the Watch into play without casting them. It may also use Enlistment Office to attempt to recoup some of the card advantage lost by this type of strategy.  On the other hand, if you mean something like a [[Knight Exemplar]] deck, no.

Delve is a static ability that functions while the spell with delve is on the stack. ""Delve"" means ""For each generic mana in this spell's total cost, you may exile a card from your graveyard rather than pay that mana."" The delve ability isn't an additional or alternative cost and applies only after the total cost of the spell with delve is determined.   2: Brainstorm can cost either {2U} or {3} as you can still choose to cast brainstorm without using Omni, Emrakul costs {3}"

MTGLegacy,3cl2r2,Manpandas,2,Wed Jul 8 19:53:50 2015 UTC,"When you calculate the cost of a spell you do it in this order:    Determine initial cost (based on any choices made prior to cost) Add cost increasing effects Subtract cost reductions, floor at {0} Apply ""Total cost affecting"" effects (of which only one card has: trinisphere)   So step one is usually easy, its almost always just ""the mana cost in the upper right of the card"".  Choices come into play here, for example (X) prior to calculating the cost the player must choose what X will be. Replicate, Kicker, and Multikiker choices are made.  Also modal cards or split cards options are declared.  Also alternate costs are part of your choices.  So if you are casting Force of Will with a Dream Halls, Omniscience, and Fist of the Suns in play, you'd choose a method of casting it prior to calculating its cost.  Step 1 starts with that cost.    2 and 3 are things like Sphere of Resistance, Lodestone Golem, Thalia... Or Affinity, Helm of Awakening, or Semblance Anvil.  Notably increases occur first, and then reductions.   And if you would reduce the cost to below no mana, it becomes {0}.   Step 4 is the Trinisphere step, because to my knowledge, its the only card that has a cost setting ability.  So basically you calculate your costs and then Trinisphere asks ""is our final cost less than three manas?""  If so, add colorless to it until its total mana is 3.   At this point the cost is locked in, and ALL payments are made simultainously.  So Tinkering out your  Lodestone Golem or Helm of Awakening wont change the mana you pay for Tinker.   NOW you can start paying for your spell.  You can draw floating mana.  You can activate mana abilities like lands, sol ring, ESG, or Wall of Roots.  And you can also use abilities that pay costs as though it was mana like Delve and Convoke.  You so must pay non-mana costs like sacrificing an artifact to Tinker.   So all in all its pretty subtle how each ability is applied and costs are calculated.  But knowing the rules for calculating cost is better than memorizing interactions between two cards."
MTGLegacy,3cl2r2,tumescentpie,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:31:35 2015 UTC,"[]Trinisphere's ability affects the total cost of the spell. It is applied after any other cost increasers or cost reducers are applied: First apply any cost increases. Next apply any cost reducers. Finally look at the amount of mana you have to pay. If it's less than three mana, you'll pay three mana.(http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?name=trinisphere)  1: You can cast DTT with delve through Trinisphere.

MTGLegacy,3cl2r2,berwald89,1 point,Wed Jul 8 19:54:24 2015 UTC,"According to this thread delve and convoke are forms of payment, therefore, you can delve 3 cards to pay for Trinisphere since Trinisphere is only asking for 3 colorless mana.  Delve isn't an alternative cost, its just a different way to pay for the casting cost.  The way I see it, and this is obviously just my understanding,  the cards in your graveyard become colorless Elvish Spirit Guides when you cast a delve card.  Also, if you want to cast Brainstorm off of Omniscience into a Trinisphere, it will cost 3 colorless."

MTGLegacy,3clclf,EchoWhiz,7,Wed Jul 8 20:21:54 2015 UTC,"You should definitely start with the thread on mtgthesource, and there have been at least two threads here in the past few weeks of people asking for ANT tips/tricks/advice. I'll leave you to find those, but since you ask after decklists, I can at least break that down. The majority of ANT is pretty set in stone. You need:  15 lands: 2 Underground Sea 1 Volcanic Island 1 Tropical Island 1 Island 1 Swamp 1 other land (Bayou, Badlands, or Island #2) 4 Polluted Delta 4 other blue fetches (if Bayou, Misty; if Badlands, Tarn)  4 Lotus Petal 4 LED 4 Dark Ritual 4 Cabal Ritual    4 Brainstorm 4 Ponder 4 Gitaxian Probe  4 Cabal Therapy 3 Duress    4 Infernal Tutor 1 Ad Nauseam 1 Past in Flames 1 Tendrils of Agony    That's 57 mandatory cards so far, so we've only got 3 flex slots. You can go with 3 Therapy and 4 Duress if you're not comfortable with Therapy yet. The 15th land slot depends on your sideboard -- Badlands if you have Young Pyromancer or Pyroblast, Bayou if you have a more traditional sideboard, Island if you're okay with giving up a sideboard slot (Bayou) for extra Wasteland-proofing. I run a Bayou.   Historically, the default card for filling those 3 flex slots is Preordain, but Preordain isn't great and you probably only want 2. Maybe less. Many people run 1 Grim Tutor, which I personally don't like (they're expensive and ugly and often not worth the slot). Recently, many people have been running a 2nd Past in Flames, which I like a lot (it makes you much less dependent on Infernal Tutor -> Past in Flames at the cost of making your Ad Nauseams slightly worse). Finally, with Miracles all over the place, Sensei's Divining Top is a great upgrade for Preordain. My 3 flex slots are Past in Flames #2, Preordain, Top, and I've strongly considered replacing both Preordains with Tops. A few lists have 1 Rain of Filth (which is essentially Cabal Ritual #5), but I don't think that's worth including.  So there's your 60. On to the sideboard, which is much more flexible. Pretty much every sideboard should have:  3 Abrupt Decay 1 Empty the Warrens 1 Chain of Vapor 1 green dual, if you don't have two in the main  You should have 2-3 pieces of anti-hatebear tech, in the form of Dread of Night and/or Massacre. If this were TES, Massacre is the obvious choice since we could Burning Wish for it, but in ANT it's kind of up to you. I like Dread of Night slightly better at the moment, but I go back and forth.  You should have 3-4 pieces of green anti-counter tech, in the form of Xantid Swarm and/or Carpet of Flowers. Swarm is a godsend against any blue decks that board out or don't have removal, while Carpet of Flowers is a better Sol Ring that blanks soft counters against blue decks.  If you've got a lot of Miracles in your area, the 4th Abrupt Decay is a reasonable include, and/or 1-2 Krosan Grip.  The last few sideboard slots are entirely up to personal preference, but are commonly a second Chain of Vapor or 1-2 Flusterstorm. 1-2 Surgical Extraction isn't insane. Some people have some cuts to their sideboards to fit in either 4 Young Pyromancer (a backup plan) or 4 Dark Confidant (punish boarding out removal), but personally I don't like either of those options. YP is probably fine, but I couldn't get used to it in a storm shell, and Bob just isn't a very good card at the moment.  Edit: The other major deck design decision is whether or not you want multiple maindeck Tendrils. If yes, you probably want 3, you move the Ad Nauseam to the sideboard, and you call the deck ""Grinding Station"" instead of ANT. There's a separate thread on mtgthesource about that variant. It's much better against Miracles, and slightly worse against everything else."

Ideally you'll get 12-14, you want Empty to be a two turn clock, but being able to (1) ignore Leyline of Sanctity without needing to find a bounce spell, (2) dodging grave hate, and most importantly, (3) establish a kill without needing to resolve ten spells is really helpful.  It's good against most Delver decks (and tempo deck in general where you board it in in place of Ad Nauseam), Burn, Miracles (they'll board out all or almost all Terminus when they see you're ANT and not TES), MUD (where you're praying to go off before they land a Trinisphere/Chalice/whatever), even D&T (unless they get Batterskull online quickly, but hopefully you can snag it with flashback Therapy)."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,Canas123,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:31:24 2015 UTC,"Discard spell #7 and ad nauseam are certainly not mandatory. Some people even cut lotus petal #4 (example of this).  As far as the young pyromancer and dark confidant sideboard goes, you really don't need 4. With bob, you want 2-4, and pyromancer you want 3-4, and it completely depends on what you expect to face. Pyromancer is very strong vs miracles and delver decks, while bob is very good vs miracles and in combo mirrors.  Oh and also, cabal ritual #4 isn't 100% mandatory either, some people prefer running a rain of filth over it."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,milesrout,0,Thu Jul 9 09:54:48 2015 UTC,Tropical Island maindeck doesn't seem right at all.
MTGLegacy,3clclf,wintermute93,3,Thu Jul 9 03:59:10 2015 UTC,"Eh. I think you want at least one green dual in the main, just because you have so much green in the sideboard and you really can't waste two sideboard slots on lands. One in the main and one in the board is fine, but I think you're pretty rarely going to get punished for sticking them both in the main. The majority of ANT lists on mtgtop8 appear to have a maindeck Trop."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,milesrout,-1,Thu Jul 9 04:02:02 2015 UTC,"You don't really want two green lands, though. Flooding out is the worst thing that can possibly happen to a storm deck: just about everything that isn't a land is a live draw in every game, either a cantrip to get more combo pieces or a combo piece."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,DecentOpinion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:09:27 2015 UTC,"I play ANT, here's the list from my top 8 in Portland. A trop in the main is so important and must be played. You will unlikely flood out with 15 lands (8 being fetches). I actually like a bayou in the board like what is being said above because I have often been in spots where 1 green land source is not enough. Keep in mind you play 4 petals as well."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,milesrout,-3,Thu Jul 9 06:41:34 2015 UTC,"Tropical Island can go in the sideboard, and Bayou isn't good in a deck with only blue/red and blue/black fetches."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,Canas123,3,Thu Jul 9 06:51:22 2015 UTC,"That's why you play misty rainforest instead of scalding tarn if you're running bayou. If you're running a decent amount of green in your sideboard however, you very likely want two green duals, since wasteland is a thing."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,SimoonSays,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:46:21 2015 UTC,"Hence why you're playing Misty Rainforest instead of Scalding Tarn if you're playing with a Bayou, As was written in Wintermute's writeup. Having the Tropical main instead of the previously used Gemstone Mine also helps opening up a SB slot and is a lot easier to get thanks to the fetchlands. The Bayou is a great way to make sure you're not as hurt by having what would otherwise be your only green land wastelanded before getting your Xantic swarm or Carpet of flowers into play.  I honestly can't see where your disdain for a Tropical main comes from."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,milesrout,1 point,Thu Jul 9 09:48:36 2015 UTC,It's impossible for them to wasteland before you cast a spell. Don't fetch the green land until you want to cast a spell.
MTGLegacy,3clclf,SimoonSays,3,Thu Jul 9 12:32:20 2015 UTC,"You don't always have access to a fetchland, there will be times where you'd have had to fetch it earlier. Besides, if you fetch, play one Xantid/AD followed by them wastelanding your land every other Green spell you draw are going to be a dead card unless you draw a petal to pay for it. If your SB is heavy green it's just better to have more ways to pay for it."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,DecentOpinion,1 point,Thu Jul 9 14:55:53 2015 UTC,"Sorry, I was trying to explain things to you, but you obviously have no idea how the deck works. If you look at my list, I run 4 mistys and 4 deltas. Having only 1 green land source is sometimes not enough. I am saying this from experience."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,rifter5000,2,Thu Jul 9 16:37:03 2015 UTC,"Most important thing with storm decks is to not get too excited. Just because you think you might be able to go off on turn 1, that doesn't mean you should. Combo off when you know you can or you have to (opponent has two flipped delvers and you are below 10 life).  Also, there are several primers and guides in the sidebar of this subreddit. Plus search this sub; reddit search sucks but you should still be able to find something useful there.   Good luck!"
MTGLegacy,3clclf,Bloo_Meanie,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:43:47 2015 UTC,Didn't notice that those were there. Thanks!
MTGLegacy,3clclf,sagemeister,2,Wed Jul 8 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"Be able to quickly tell what you need to go off. Usually that's a business spell (Ad nauseum/Past in flames) + 5 mana, or a Tutor + 7. This is much easier if you think of spells in terms of their net mana effect (Dark ritual is + 2, Cabal is +1 or +3, LED is +3, Tutor is -2). Remember that extra tutors can be used to get second copies of rituals, diamonds, or even discard spells to set up for the next turn.  Learn what to name with Cabal Therapy. Probe is a big help here, but you won't always have your training wheels. Name what scares you the most, even if it means giving up a guaranteed hit. If you call Force and they don't have it, who cares if they still have a Batterskull you just win anyways. Also, if you know they have a Force and just a single blue card, it can be correct to discard the blue card. Especially if it's a Dig through time or a Brainstorm.  Cantrip effectively. There are entire articles written about just this. Save Brainstorm for when you have a fetch, and vice versa. I play TES so I need the red source much more frequently, but if I have two fetches and a Brainstorm, I'll get the Volcanic first and the Sea second so I can Brainstorm and then discard. And don't forget that you can also use cantrips as a window to crack your LEDs if you know what's on top.  Sometimes you just gotta go for it. You have a kill in hand and they just tapped out but you don't know if there's a Force of Will? Make them have it now. Every extra turn you give them is just more time to find one.  Have fun counting to 10, the deck is a blast!"
MTGLegacy,3clclf,lordoftheshadows,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:13:23 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your advice! I think the effective cantripping, Therapies and knowing when to go for it are a function of familiarity with the format, which I'm working on. The rules of thumb are good to keep in mind as well."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,Canas123,1 point,Wed Jul 8 23:41:09 2015 UTC,"The best way to learn the format is to spam watch EVERY legacy video on scg live youtube. After you have done that, it becomes easy to quickly tell what your opponents are probably playing after their first land drop."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,dripdropdiet,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:35:48 2015 UTC,"ANT is a fun deck although I find it to be just worse than TES or Grinding Station I understand why people play it.  Playing the middle of the spectrum doesn't tend to work out too well for storm decks.  The most important part of learning ANT are:   Learn how to cast Cabal Therapy.  Watch coverage, jam matches and talk to people.  You'll miss sometimes but eventually you'll be able to consistently blind name what you need to.  Another thing to remember, only take cards that do one of two things stop you from winning or find things that stop you from winning.  Very rarely is it correct to take a delver or a goyf unless they kept a very loose hand or are on a mulligan. Know how the rules works.  LED is a bit bizarre rules wise so I would take a look at some articles to understand exactly how it works. Know how to mulligan.  You just have to learn this skill.  You can talk to other players but what you really need to practice.  Like all things legacy practice makes slightly less difficult. Know how to cantrip.  You can't hold on to Brainstorm as aggressively as other decks do so you need to know how to get the most out of your cantrips.  I believe that Caleb Durwald (maybe someone else) had a great article on this a few years ago that still holds today. Know how to sideboard.  This is exceptionally difficult but my advice is don't be afraid to cut ponders or lands.  Every card in your deck except Infernal tutor, LED,and Tendrils can be cut."
MTGLegacy,3clclf,rifter5000,2,Thu Jul 9 05:20:13 2015 UTC,You can absolutely sideboard out tutors and LED's in certain situations.
MTGLegacy,3clclf,thefringthing,0,Thu Jul 9 10:46:48 2015 UTC,Can't hurt to check out Bryant Cook's page on the Epic Storm: http://www.theepicstorm.com/. And of course read the whole primer/thread on ANT on http://www.mtgthesource.com/forums/index.php
MTGLegacy,3clclf,TheScynic,6,Wed Jul 8 21:26:27 2015 UTC,TES is not ANT. It's a very different deck that works very differently. It's about half a turn more explosive but much less resilient.
MTGLegacy,3cl2x9,Magnaguard100,5,Wed Jul 8 19:15:55 2015 UTC,"I've played this deck.  It's a blast.  It's also not good.  Be warned.  The version I played used Diabolic Intents and Summoner's pacts, also played a Young Wolf for doubling up on the sacrifice effects, which was kind of nice.  Don't think it played top.  Top is too slow for something like this anyway.    I put this together a week or two ago when it first popped up and promptly ad nauseam'd into primeval titan.  I then burning wished for tendrils and won the game anyway.  So that's nice.    In general I think you could probably tweak this enough to make it about as good as belcher.  I'm pretty sure that's the ceiling though."
MTGLegacy,3cl2x9,jeffderek,2,Wed Jul 8 20:49:35 2015 UTC,"The tops probably help somewhat with the awkward disynergy with GSZ and LED, though they still seem kinda slow.  It's probably worth it just to see your opponent's face when you say ""flip Top, crack LEDs for six green mana, cast Primeval Titan."""
MTGLegacy,3cl2x9,TheScynic,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:29:09 2015 UTC,"Agree.  Downside is then titan goes and gets the depths combo tapped and it's two more turns before you can attack with the damn token, at which point you'll have attacked for 12 with Prime Time.  So what's the lands combo doing in here anyway?"
MTGLegacy,3cl2x9,jeffderek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what my initial thought was as well, I mentioned it in a comment below. I'm trying to think of some decent way to use Prime to get lands that aren't completely useless drawn naturally, but I'm at a loss."
MTGLegacy,3cl2x9,TheScynic,2,Wed Jul 8 21:44:37 2015 UTC,"Primetime just doesn't fit this deck.  this is the list I was playing around with before.  Works along the same general concept, lots of different cards though.  I didn't ever actually get around to playing it even in a local tournament, just a lot of goldfishing, and it was a while ago, but my general impression is that you could probably combine it with this and come up with something fairly close to belcher in consistency level.    I'd cut two of the ESGs for something else, maybe cabal rituals, maybe add a 4th color for Burning Wish, dunno.  I like having one ESG to Pact for.  All in all, it's a fun deck to mess around with but it's never going to approach 4 Brainstorm 4 Ponder 4 Probe 2-4 Preordain levels of consistency or power."
MTGLegacy,3cl2x9,jeffderek,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:53:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that looks a lot more like a typical VANT list.  Honestly, these inconsistent Belcher-esque strategies like Saint, VANT, etc. work a lot better when you go full combo game 1, then board into creatures game 2.

As far as I've ever seen, the only case for legal reasons has been speculation and conjecture, let alone someone who actually put figures down as a potential loss that a lawsuit would garner.   Unless you can point to where there actually had been legal minds saying yes there is a potential case here, and it's potentially this damaging - you're just espousing more conjecture.

I would like to be able to spend money and play legacy. Unfortunately, in my part of the world it only appears to be possible to spend money on it.  Finally, I am not for a minute saying wizards doesn't know what they are doing. Au contraire I feel they have an excellent grasp on economy management of the cards. That is why it is so confusing to me to see them manage their online product and their paper product so differently.

The reasons for keeping it now are exactly none, but it's real cute that you actually believe WoTC and by extension made a promise and are standing by their word.   Okay, I guess by your condescending and belittling attitude, there's no point in debating this then. I figure once someone stops debating and resorts to repeating themselves, personal attacks, what's the point?  Enjoy your masterful debate with your self."

I have to acknowledge that completely unregulated supply may break the economy.   Its worth it to note, that the original print run of Unlimited was originally considered to be more cards than anyone would every possibly need. Hence the name.  The game has gotten bigger and bigger with every passing set, and far and away surpassed anyones expectations for it.   Magic is here to stay.

MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,rumballtron,6,Tue Jul 14 13:01:37 2015 UTC,This may give some a new view on the reserved list. It would pop the bubble of price on older magic cards. Who in there right mind would pay 1K+ for cardboard. The only thing that keeps prices up is the rarity. It could cause a panic sell out and tanking of all card prices. that would be a good thing for people who have little to nothing invested in the game. but online stores and LGS would lose a lot of liquidity. Making it even harder to stay open. As much as i hate that I have to pay 100+ per land its not a bad thing for the health of the game.   http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2015/04/16/400140583/how-success-almost-killed-a-game-and-how-its-creators-saved-it

MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,MASTICATOR_NORD,5,Thu Jul 9 22:51:49 2015 UTC,"The value of older cards is part of the genius of their strategy, because it allows for the presumption that new cards may one day attain such prices, thus driving sales of the newer product."

MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,milesrout,2,Thu Jul 9 20:08:11 2015 UTC,"the company has given explicit reason for the collector to believe that their collection won't be devalued by a reprint, and for 20 years has acted in accordance, which is long enough to establish that a collector could reasonably assume they would continue that promise in perpetuity.

MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,MASTICATOR_NORD,3,Thu Jul 9 17:39:25 2015 UTC,"you understand my premise though, the availability of a playable alternative naturally devalues the original.   This is the big problem in all of this mess. People keep trying to treat magic cards like collectibles, but the magic secondary market doesn't work like that. The market (except on the really high end stuff) is driven by players who need the cards to play. But wizards doesn't want to reprint cards because they're afraid of the backlash from people whose collections lose value.  People need to stop treating magic cards as collectibles/investments. Keeping people out of the game so collections don't lose value won't save collections from losing value when nobody wants the cards to play with anymore.  Again, I think comic books are a good illustration of what's wrong with magic. All of the major comic publishers have made it easy for anybody to be able to read old and important stories, whether it be through digital copies or paper omnibuses. This hasn't (to my knowledge) affected collectors.  I think wizards have basically painted themselves in a corner at this point. They've created this mindset that cards are ""collectibles"" and should have some sort of monetary value. They've let cards become expensive enough that reprints will cause a shitstorm. As they let cards continue to become more and more expensive it will be harder and harder to not piss people off with reprints. Meanwhile, less and less people will want to play because of the stupid prices. But then if nobody wants to play, what's going to happen to the value of collections whose worth is based on people needing the cards to play? I just don't see how this is ever going to end well.  I keep rambling in this thread. Sorry about that.  Edit: I guess the TLDR is that if magic cards actually were collectibles, then reprints wouldn't be an issue because they wouldn't hurt the values of rarer original printings."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,thefringthing,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:36:00 2015 UTC,"yeah the issue is a small subset DO care about reprints enough, whereas everyone else wants them.    the other thing is that since magic is still growing, lets say only 1 in 50 people wants to and/or has the money to get into legacy/vintage. well, then the legacy population is still growing, and demand for those cards continues to grow even as the availability dwindles through gold old fashioned destruction, theft, or loss"
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,shamonic,2,Thu Jul 9 19:52:06 2015 UTC,"But look at what modern masters 1 & 2 did when they were reprinted?  they increased the number of players that wanted the cards, and because they are the primary driver of prices, actually had the long term values of the cards go up (if they did dip down for a while).  My set of Tarmogoyfs is still ""worth"" the $800 it was two years ago when I bought them.   Dark Confidants? Halfed in value because nobody uses them currently.  Volcanic Islands? Went up 300% because the number of people that want to play legacy is increasing, and the lands required to do so are not. There will be a point where there just isn't any Volcanic Islands out there anymore."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,YodaTuna,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:47:15 2015 UTC,"I believe there was a point in time when magic cards were seen as something like comic books or baseball cards and treating them as limited collectibles was a logical approach.  Obviously in the 20 years that has passed since then, it has become a completely different beast into itself. Now, as you aptly said early - the primary driver of prices are people who want to use the cards. This is different from every other ""collectable"" out there (to the best of my knowledge) - and the people who want to actually 'use' the cards for their stated purpose of playing in tournaments cannot because WoTC still thinks they are the same as comic books.   Its been 20 years, and its time for a new approach is my only argument, or at least - help us understand why you are so opposed to reprinting cards (but yet reprint them all the time on Magic Online)"

Wow, 7 conditional statements and yet I'm the unreasonable one. Don't break your back bending over twisting yourself into a pretzel to justify/defend your original position.

MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,InGross,0,Wed Jul 15 18:38:28 2015 UTC,"My original position was unreasonable. Is that what you want to hear?  I am very interested in debate, but that usually involves defending my position.   I still don't think there is grounds for a lawsuit, so getting me to admit that a lawsuit could damage them doesn't really further your position.   Promissory estoppel makes a case that there is an expectation of keeping the reserve list; but if there is damages to collectors (we don't even know for sure that there will be - many cards went up after high profile reprints) the onus will be on the collectors to show that the reprints are the sole reason for the damages, and that WoTC is responsible for X dollars.  I feel fairly confident that a barely competent lawyer could make a case that (even if some of the values of the original cards go down, which we don't know for sure that they will) that there was a multitude of other factors responsible for it, so personally the reason I come off as dismissive of a potential lawsuit is because it comes across to me as a preposterous preposition.   It would be thrown out before it even got traction.   Its possible I could be wrong since I don't have any background in law, let alone American Tort Law, but I don't think I have ever seen a lawyer say that there is good justification for a case (assuming the cards go down, which again we don't know for sure that will happen) and have seen multiple lawyers (in this thread alone) say that a lawsuit is laughable at best.   I apologize if you are a lawyer, but you would be the first that I've seen to loan any credence to a case based on promissory estoppel (if you do)."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,0ffendid,2,Thu Jul 16 03:47:02 2015 UTC,"I still don't think there is grounds for a lawsuit   I've had two different lawyers say the same. Promissory estoppel wouldn't necessarily apply in this case for two reasons. First, there has to be an admission of worth directly in the mention of the promise, this is arguable, but there are several precedents where cases based on estoppel failed because of this, but more importantly, secondly because any acquisition by another company exculpates the company from any and all promises. There are according to one of my sources, dozens of precedents for this, and none where this legal argument was used that failed.  Sources: My ex is a lawyer, albeit in the EU, and a friend of mine is a magic player and lawyer in the northeast US.  That doesn't mean there aren't still costs, even if the lawsuit wouldn't be successful. The legal costs of running such a lawsuit would not be negligible for wizards, and there is always the risk, which is the main thing legal departments try to avoid at all costs.  Also, the fact that there are several testimonies of the managers of the biggest stores in the world saying that they'd make more money if there were reprints, would also be important to consider in the first issue above.  Long story short: Whether or not the lawsuit had merit, it would be something that wizards should (and would) try to avoid at all costs. The safest way is not touching the reserve list, regardless of how much it is harming the game now, since it is still in a growth period."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,InGross,1 point,Thu Jul 16 11:15:32 2015 UTC,"true. but then you think, why would you lose all that money and have this big hoopla for no reason?    i mean of course there is motivation to remove the list, but it isn't discouraging people from buying product. if anything, people being discouraged from legacy/vintage is better for wizards because they dont make money selling those products sealed anymore. people say, damn, the price is too high, better consider modern, standard, or limited. which pushes them to somewhere more (only slightly in moderns case) centered on progression with new sets than old staples.     failing to remove the list disappoints people but since there is no expectation of it actually being lifted, it's a pipe dream and nobody is put off when it doesn't happen. as opposed to the removal, which would make people mad and annoyed."

This is what upsets me the most in all of this. From what I can tell magic is different from any other collecting hobby since the secondary market is driven by players rather than collectors. This is an important distinction because the rarity that drives up the prices comes more from people needing the cards than actual scarcity.  An example that came up in a debate about modern prices is a good illustration of how different magic is from other collecting hobbies. Collectors will a pay a lot of money for an original Action Comics 1 (the comic book Superman first appeared in), but at the same time you can get a digital copy from comixology for $1. Here the value of the collectors item isn't tied to the demands of the everyday comic book readers, but to the people who value it for its scarcity.  Compare this situation with the situation in magic. In magic the price of cards is driven more by player demand than by demand from collectors. Its the ""everyday comic book readers"", so to speak, who are forced to pay ""collector"" prices just so they can play the game.  The irony is if it weren't for the players the collectors collections wouldn't be valuable. How much do you think an Underground Sea would be worth if it weren't needed by players? Well it's not any rarer than a Plateau, so I'd say the ceiling is $60. If everybody stopped playing legacy their collections would be just as worthless as if there were reprints.  My point is that players are being made to suffer because these ""collectors"" (whoever they actually are, if they even exist) are worried about the value of their collections tanking, but their collections only have the value that they do because players want to play. In any other collecting hobby reprints aren't such an issue because people put more stock in rarer printings, but to somebody who just wants to play in tournaments, an Underground Sea is an Underground Sea no matter what printing it's from.  All that being said, I don't think the really high end collectors will suffer. They are more like traditional collecting hobbyists in that they care about rarity and original printings and stuff like that. They won't care about a reprint of Black Lotus because they have their Alpha Black Lotus which is a lot cooler.  This got pretty long winded. I consider myself a collector at heart (though I lack the wallet to be a collector in practice) so I get upset by this notion that reprints hurt the value of ""collectible"" cards, because that's not how collecting is supposed to work."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Timiniel,0,Thu Jul 9 16:18:51 2015 UTC,well thought out response. You really put some of my feelings into words as well.  I tried to draw the parallel to how much Action Comics #1 tanked when they reprinted it as well (my guess is that it didn't at all?)
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Timiniel,0,Fri Jul 10 06:36:40 2015 UTC,"Oh please. What company actually cares about ""promises"" ?  They care about what makes them money, plain and simple."

It can't happen, and even if they were the amount of money they would make printing something like legacy masters would crush any potential class action"
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,ashent2,6,Thu Jul 9 20:15:01 2015 UTC,"""because we promised"" can also mean that an NDA was signed by all parties involved in a legally binding agreement.  Just some food for thought."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Ozy-dead,8,Thu Jul 9 09:22:23 2015 UTC,"Based on the way they talk about it, there almost certainly is legal issues around the Reserve List policy."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,ashent2,-1,Thu Jul 9 10:36:06 2015 UTC,"I can't possibly imagine what they are.  I'm not a lawyer by any means, but did any of us sign any contracts the last time we bought magic cards?"
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Ozy-dead,3,Thu Jul 9 11:37:02 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is back in the day Wizards made a bad decision and made the reserve list. This is something they have acknowledged, however as a consumer I'm much more willing to buy legacy duals/power because of the reserved list.   On a whim, after a good check and selling some standard cards I bought a piece of power at a GP recently. This is not a purchase I would have made if I thought it was possible for my moxen to be reprinted. A lot of people have a lot of money tied up into magic cards. Abolishing the reserved list is going to plummet the price of a lot of these cards. And people that have a lot of money tied up into the game because ""Wizards promised they would not reprint them"" will get screwed and there is issue there for a potential law suit. One which I can not imagine WOTC wants to even try and fight."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Ozy-dead,0,Thu Jul 9 11:58:33 2015 UTC,I suppose we can look at comic books as a comparison.  Have functionally (same story and art) copies of Spider-Man 1 been printed as special editions?   Superman #1? Did the values of the originals tank because now you could get the exact same story for a fraction of the price?
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,motorcityguitarist,0,Thu Jul 9 20:18:35 2015 UTC,Your moxen will never be reprinted.  The original print run will forever retain value as its a collectors item that people are buying to own not play with.

MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Timiniel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:45:22 2015 UTC,"Who did they sign a contract with? Themselves? Lmao. No, at most theyve made a non binding verbal promise to players.

As a lawyer, I can say with a high level of certainty that there is nothing holding Wotc back from reprinting the reserve list."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Timiniel,1 point,Thu Jul 9 13:54:55 2015 UTC,"Except verbal contracts do hold value in court. A lawyer would know that. With out a doubt immediatly abandoning the reserved list would result in a flood of civil cases for betraying buyer confidence. You probibly took a class on fiduciary duty in law school, and there would definatly be a case for collectors to sue for damages."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Timiniel,0,Fri Jul 10 14:39:33 2015 UTC,"Wotc does not owe a fiduciary duty to its customers or card investors.  Saying ""we are not going to reprint X"" is a promise, but not a contract. It's not enforceable because Wotc is not receiving any benefit or detriment from anyone else in exchange.  Private companies change policy all the time. Unless you are a stock holder, you have no recourse. Even then, the board has lots of leeway on making business decisions.  This is very clear cut."
MTGLegacy,3cnk0g,Timiniel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:24:46 2015 UTC,"Wotc does not owe a fiduciary duty to its customers or card investors.   So, using that logic, a person cannot be sued for any reason, say negligence, or damaging my property, because there's no fiduciary duty?  That's like saying someone sells me a car, takes a sledgehammer to my car, and then says ""sorry, there's no contract saying I won't destroy the value of your car.""  It's not an issue about fiduciary duty, it's about not destroying the value of the stuff I bought. People who bought stuff from the reserved list based on the reserved list policy, in my opinion, have a right to expect Wotc to follow that policy.  Edited: Clarity"

Surgical could work to get their Loams and/or combo pieces, but it's probably a little narrow.  Relic is another option if you want to keep some cards around, but it's probably worse than RIP, especially against lands.

MTGLegacy,3cib1f,alcaizin,2,Wed Jul 8 06:32:30 2015 UTC,"You have Wastelands, Deathrites and Ooze (I assume) which should give you plenty of game to turn off their Loams.

MTGLegacy,3cib1f,Skelegro93,2,Thu Jul 9 18:26:03 2015 UTC,"It's a grindy match up, but you really only need to watch out for Loam. Hold back on Wastelands and don't bother trying to hit anything that produces mana. You want to keep them around to snipe Thespian Stages so they can't get a Marit Lage, or to blow up Mazes of Ith if you can go for a kill. If they ever have one half of the combo on board, stop attacking with Knight. He's your best card. They can't usually P-fire him, and he's effectively a Wasteland that they can't tap with Rishadan Port. Just hang back and let Deathrite drain them out.  As far as sideboards... RIP hurts you a lot too, so I generally avoid it. You can try specific hate like Tsabo's Web, but you're better off with something like Pithing Needle or Surgical Extraction that has other uses throughout the day. Armageddon doesn't stop Loam from getting them back into the game, so it isn't as strong as it is vs. Miracles. I actually prefer Crucible of Worlds vs. Lands since it lets me recycle Wastelands, and they can't normally combo faster than I can replay a single land."

It's not actively being discussed because it's a fairly known quantity. The only real difference is SFM -> SCM.  Miracles is very good, but has trouble closing out games. Mentor is great with Sensei's Divining Top. Throw in a few Dazes due to how they play with Mentor, and you have Mentor Miracles, is a very solid deck.  In terms of it vs Esper Mentor, I'm not sure the comparison is completely fair. Aside from the namesake wincon, Esper Mentor is a lot more like bigger version Grixis Control (in terms of how its games play out) than it is like a Miracles deck."

I wouldn't put too much stake into what WoTC calls various decks.  However, you're right and this deck isn't exactly Miracles.

MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,twndomn,4,Tue Jul 7 21:16:23 2015 UTC,"Just look at GP Kyoto and GP Lille. If you play Ponder Miracles in its purest form, you won't get too far. Rather, I would suggest that Mentor Miracles is the natural evolution of Ponder Miracles. Before Lille, some people including me have already mentioned that Ponder Miracles plays like a combo deck, you are barely controlling the board state. When you are cutting lands down to 20, running Daze, cutting Jace, tap out main phase to present Mentor as a threat with Daze/FoW backup, how much control are you really? I am not saying this is wrong, I am just saying that is the direction of Mentor Miracles. Without Jace MD, I question the reliability of putting Terminus back on top of Library. However, why bother doing that since you intend to smash with Mentor to begin with. It's as if you just treat Terminus as a dead draw/dead card in your hand and move on.   The state of Legacy and Miracles as a whole, you either play Mentor Miracles without Karakas to be as pro-active as possible, or you have to MD Clique with Karakas in your Mana base. Looks like being pro-active in an intelligent manner can crush Omni-tell and get you a GP trophy."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,iAmQuantum,0,Tue Jul 7 19:46:27 2015 UTC,"I think it's the real deal. People were steadily upping the Mentor count in the sideboard and finding more situations to bring them in post-board. Pushing them maindeck alongside some tweaks makes a lot of sense, especially when the matches it shines in are very popular in Europe. You're basically pre-boarded for Delver and 'standard' Miracles. Adding Daze makes a lot of sense too as it helps shore up the extreme early game where you are most vulnerable. Personally I'd like 1x Jace somewhere in the main to hit with Digs but on a whole I like the list."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,aegais,6,Tue Jul 7 21:41:21 2015 UTC,This deck is worse against standard miracles as it makes a terminus a live card again.

MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,aegais,2,Tue Jul 7 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"I feel like there is some debate to be had here, considering that Claudio Bonanni managed to beat Olivier Ruel with it, certainly a daunting task considering Ruel's pedigree. The reason I feel it might have the edge is the ability to play daze as weird as that may sound. Being able to daze early when miracles mana is tied up trying to establish countertop is huge. Being able to establish it with daze back up on turn 2 is also incredibly valuable in the pseudo mirror (if one can even call it that.) Once the countertop lock is established, the aforementioned removal becomes more manageable."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,TheFlyinGutchman,2,Tue Jul 7 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"GP Kyoto had the same decks with different results. Schnogger as well as other miracle aficionados have said it is in traditional miracles' favor.  Yes, it makes countertop easily to establish, but only really during the first two turns, which doesn't happen in miracles very much. Otherwise it's mostly a dead card, and I wouldn't be surprised if it was one of the first cards to go out.   PS. I forgot to mention, but it turns on StP as well."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,aegais,1 point,Wed Jul 8 00:41:29 2015 UTC,"They weren't the same though. The winning list at GP Kyoto was a Legend Ponder Hybrid, and the 2nd place list had stoneforge package. Comparing the two matches is relevant, but they were not ""the same decks with different results.""   I am saying that I think maindeck mentor lists may have an edge over traditional ponder miracles given that daze is so helpful in establishing/denying countertop which is I would say the most important piece of the mirror or pseudo-mirror."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,iAmQuantum,1 point,Wed Jul 8 15:02:42 2015 UTC,"Ruel's decklist is also a Legend Ponder hybrid, if you haven't noticed. Yes, GP Kyoto had the SFM package but the core engine of those decks is very similar.   After Kyoto came out, I extensively tested Miracle Mentor and dropped it because of its weakness to normal miracles. I do not think the small differences in builds changes it significantly, as it still has the same problem on turning on 8 near dead cards in the mirror match. If the other miracles player knows what he's doing and floats them on the top, the late-game power of traditional miracles will overcome the mentors. Schonegger and the GP Kyoto finalist that created the mentor miracles deck have said that it is weak to traditional miracles.  Again, Daze is only really relevant the first two turns of the game, and pretty much necessitates having countertop in in your opening hand, which happens relatively little of the time. I don't think Daze is nearly as important in the mirror as you are making it out to be, as the number of times it's sat in my hand as a dead card or had to send it back with brainstorm far outnumber the times where it was a blowout.  This is really something you will have to test out and see. Everything I've told you is a result of my experience piloting and playing against the deck. Theorycrafting, while fun, is near useless."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,aegais,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:36:23 2015 UTC,"Terminus getting better is fair. I'd add that Terminus becomes very important to resolve as not resolving it basically leaves you dead on board. I think that is an interesting dynamic as Miracles mirrors typically don't end quickly outside of a big Entreat, which Terminus is live against anyway.  I'm not convinved the deck is worse in the mirror if the GP finals match was anything to go by. The deck looked significantly stronger than previous Mentor builds."
MTGLegacy,3cgfrd,iAmQuantum,1 point,Wed Jul 8 09:09:27 2015 UTC,"Terminus or StP works. We've had the opposite result in GP Kyoto, with almost he exact same decks.

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,HotCKate,48,Tue Jul 7 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"Correction: four horsemen isn't ""banned"" because it's slow; it's ""banned"" because of a peculiarity in the way it wins via a non-deterministic infinite loop which is considered slow play; because the loop has a high probability of success the win-con is in reality pretty quick (and yet still violates tournament rules). You can read up on it here.    Also I'm not convinced Miracles would still be anywhere near tier 1 if Counterbalance were banned. Counterbalance generates a ton of card advantage, which buys a lot of time. Without it, I think miracles will have a really tough time against tempo decks that stick a fast threat.    Edit: forgot to say ""Thanks for the article! It's great to see new writers taking up the Legacy format!"""
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,bunkoRtist,14,Tue Jul 7 14:34:04 2015 UTC,I think without counterbalance you see a return to the 4 snapcaster mage control decks where you just bury people in infinite swords to plowshares.
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,6,Tue Jul 7 14:53:13 2015 UTC,"I would guess that the control meta shifts towards something where you bury people in infinite Digs and just play a Gro-A-Tog style deck, with DTT functioning as your Gush engine, and Peezy/Mentor as your Tog. Basically the Grixis Control and Esper, which is just a spinoff of Grixis that borrows the same shell while swapping red for white."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,efil4zaknupome,0,Tue Jul 7 15:43:36 2015 UTC,"Probably a good guess.  I don't think the white version plays black though.  I think miracles stays Jeskai.  Cabal Therapy is nice but plays better with the 2 mana version of tog than the 3 mana version, so you keep red around for pyroblast.    ""Miracles"" probably keeps the 4 tops around though, just because of how dumb they are with mentor."

As for Jeskai Mentor, I've done some work there, as well. This is what Jeskai might look like without Counterbalance: http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/285722 I want the deck to be good, but I felt like I hit a wall and ended up putting it on the shelf for the time being."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,efil4zaknupome,4,Tue Jul 7 18:25:32 2015 UTC,"I apologize if I was incorrect, I was under the impression if you played the deck the reason you would be given a game loss (if the deck started to go off) was for slow play.  I'm mobile/at work but I will read up on it more later!"
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,13,Tue Jul 7 14:58:36 2015 UTC,"The actual penalty you are given is for slow play, but you're given the penalty not because you're taking to long to make a decision (like top), but because you're trying to shuffle your deck an indeterminate amount of times to get a very specific order.  Since the game state isn't changing between each shuffle and you can't guarantee that you'll ever shuffle and get the exact order you want, the tournament rules require you move on and make a different game action.  If you don't, and try to keep executing the combo, the penalty you receive is slow play."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,ubernostrum,2,Tue Jul 7 15:06:41 2015 UTC,"The basic idea is that any time you have a loop in the game, you need to be able to do two things:   Up-front, give the exact number of iterations of the loop you'll go through, and Up-front, give an exact description of the resulting game state after that many iterations.   If you can't do that, the loop is indeterminate, and trying to execute it in hopes of achieving a particular desired (but not guaranteed) game state puts you at risk of Slow Play penalties. There is no specific defined moment/number of iterations/etc. when you get cut off and given a penalty -- that's up to the subjective judgment of the judge who's watching you do it -- but if you just sit there and keep going and going without achieving your desired end state, sooner or later it will happen.  For sake of comparison, people often ask about a situation that seems similar but is actually very different: if you have some loop that lets you scry 1 as many times as you like (say, Viscera Seer plus Melira plus persist creature), can you just cut a particular card to the top of your library? Since the library is random, people expect that not to work, but it can be done in a purely deterministic fashion:   Count the cards remaining in your library (which you can do at any time). Call this number N. Do the scry 1 loop, putting the card on the bottom each time. Number of iterations is N, result is library is in the same order as before but now you know the order. And, specifically, you know how many cards down the desired card is. Call that number K. Do the scry 1 loop, putting the card on the bottom each time. Number of iterations is K-1, result is desired card is on top of the library (and the rest of the library's order is also completely predictable).   Since this can be expressed in a way that satisfies the rules above (regarding number of iterations and resulting game state), it's perfectly legal. And in fact it's fine to shortcut it by just picking up your deck, looking through it and cutting to the desired card.  But the Horsemen loop can never be expressed this way; it's not possible to give the required number of iterations in advance, for example, so it's on the wrong side of policy here."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,efil4zaknupome,8,Tue Jul 7 15:14:02 2015 UTC,"No. 12-post is (no exaggeration) probably 90/10. A few of the BGx decks (Shardless, for one) probably hold an edge of 55/45 or 60/40. Temur Delver is around 50/50. People say MUD is close to 12-post level of bad, but I think it's closer to 60/40 (at worst).. I think most people just have a poor approach to that matchup."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,6,Tue Jul 7 15:41:07 2015 UTC,"I strongly suspect 12post is going to get a lot better for miracles if Mentor becomes a widely adopted maindeck card.  Miracles always lost to post because post just had the better long game, but if Miracles adapts and is able to come in under post I could see things going much better.  Post still has tools to shut that down, obviously, with the fogs and Tabernacle, but mentor can actually pump out enough damage on it's own to fight glimmerpost effectively, and most post decks don't run more than 3 or 4 ways to sweep the mentor off the board.  I think the matchup is still in post's favor, but it's gonna be a lot better than it used to be."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,KingKha,22,Wed Jul 8 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"I would be much more in favour of banning Terminus as a way to deal with the modern miracles deck. Before the advent of AVR, the CounterTop engine was in a a wide variety of decks. Here's a Legacy Open top 8 from 2011 which has two four-color decks, one with goyfs and lavamancers, the other with thopter/sword, and a bant deck with Rhox War Monk. You could run also run BUG with Bob or RUG with Delvers. According to mtgtop8, decks with CounterTop were still only 6% of decks. So clearly the CounterTop engine itself doesn't limit the variety of decks.   What does stifle legacy is Terminus. It's a 1-mana instant-speed wrath that gets around indestructibility. There's no reason not to run it. Suddenly, decks with Countertop run fewer creatures to avoid this nonbo. Gone are the days or running CounterTop alongside Bob, Goyf, Lavamancer, and other creatures that you want to keep. What's the point of trying to make Thopter tokens if you're going to have to get rid of all of them if your opponent lands more than 1 creature? You need to run creatures which either give immediate value or can reliably keep coming back. Snapcaster mage gives you instant value, and shuffling it back into your library will give you even more. Clique gives you instant value and can be saved from the Terminus by Karakas. Because of Terminus, decks with CounterTop can't be aggressive. So they need another win condition, something that also lets them control the game. Enter JtMS, which does both but takes forever to do it. Dodges Terminus and wins the game by itself.  Terminus pushes all the CounterTop decks into being very similar. There's very few creatures that can be profitably run and very few ways to reliably win the game when you're not turning dudes sideways."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,Morzas,4,Tue Jul 7 14:41:30 2015 UTC,"Wizards usually bans engine cards (Flash, Survival) instead of pieces (Hulk, Vengevine). It would be very unlike them to ban Terminus instead of Top."

It'd be like banning Brainstorm: Legacy is the 4x Brainstorm format, just as it is the format where CounterTop has been a viable strategy for forever.  What Terminus does is it pretty much forces every CounterTop deck to be a single deck: Miracles with Terminus and Jace as a win condition."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:35:25 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, does the existence of Supreme Verdict change any of this logic?

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,ubernostrum,3,Tue Jul 7 16:47:59 2015 UTC,"Verdict is too slow against some creature combo decks, which can kill before you ever get to four mana. Terminus, with a bit of luck, can be cast starting on turn two, and that's a huge difference."

I just don't see turn 3 miracled terminuses all the time.  I see lots of counterspells and swords to plowshares on the key creatures to prevent getting overrun, then when an army is built up a terminus that has been floating for a while on top finally gets cast.  On average I feel like Miracles probably casts their first terminus of the game after they already have 4 lands in play.  But I admit that's all pretty anecdotal."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,thekmind,2,Tue Jul 7 18:52:13 2015 UTC,"It can be cast as an Instant, and costing 1 mana instead of 4 leaves you room for Spell Pierce or Ponder on your turn etc."

Verdict means the deck can still be played, but you can't use it on Natural Order into Craterhoof or Sneak Attack or Monastery Mentor and his monks (just to name three things off the top of my head). Either way, I think Bob and Goyf and Verdict/Jace are different enough in game plan that neither would play like current miracles. I'm not in favour of banning the deck completely because then something else will be dominant and people will call for bans, I just think there's no point in playing a CounterTop deck that doesn't run what has become pretty much a standard 75. I think banning Terminus would lead to a lot more playable decks. Yes, they might still have an identical engine in the form of Counterbalance and Top, but Bob+Goyf is very different from Jace+Verdict."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,15,Tue Jul 7 16:57:52 2015 UTC,"Congrats on your first article!  I have to admit, though, I was a little surprised to see High Tide in your list of ""other decks in Legacy that do not bog down the format""  To your main point: 15% adoption of a single deck isn't that notable in legacy.  Looking at some old results, you can see Merfolk held that rate for a while, as did Stoneblade.  In fact, depending on how you categorize things, Delver decks as a whole are currently occupying 19.65% of the metagame, according to MTGGoldfish.    The format will adapt, and decks that prey on miracles will start to have more success.  We've already seen the dominant combo deck of the format shift from one where counterbalance is amazing (Storm) to one where counterbalance is less relevant (Show and Tell).    The Grixis control deck with Pyromancer also has a very strong Miracles matchup.  It's certainly not an autowin by any stretch, but being able to present multiple must-answer threats like True-Name Nemesis and Pyromancer without overcommitting into terminus helps make that matchup very winnable.  I've been playing that deck a lot and I have an overall positive record vs Miracles.  12post could also see a bit of a comeback, although admittedly I think the adoption of Mentor will make that matchup better for Miracles, it's probably still in post's favor.  I agree that top is very irritating to play against, but as I've said elsewhere I think that banning the only playable colorless card selection spell is a very bad decision.  Jund and 12post both had very good day 2 showings at the GP with Divining Tops in them.  Can you explain to those pilots why their card selection has to go but Brainstorm, Ponder, Preordain, and Dig are all totally fine?  It's ludicrous, right?  It's easy to think of top as a blue card, and think of how banning it will affect the blue decks, but especially at the local level I see a lot of players who can't afford blue duals using top to help smooth out their draws in their inconsistent non-blue decks.  EDIT: To your last point (got distracted, sorry).  You could ban counterbalance, but I'm not sure there's any real justification for it.  Again, Miracles isn't a larger percentage of the field than the best deck has been at any given point.  Based on the way Wizards has issued bans over the past 5-6 years (Survival is the last ban of an existing card, since both TCruise and Misstep were banned very quickly after being released), I don't see any reason to think they'll look at 15% metagame saturation and think an existing combo needs to be broken up.  EDIT2: It took 20% saturation of a single deck (U/R Delver) and 31% saturation of that general strategy (Delver) to get Cruise banned after New Jersey, for reference.  I don't have full metagame numbers but those numbers are true for the GP at least."

Banning a card is much less disruptive when done at the very start of a format than when it's already an established presence in the format.  (also I suspect it had something to do with the fact that Legacy just doesn't have a lot of events and has even fewer big on-camera ones, while Modern was intended to have a ton of events ranging from PTQs to GPs to PTs every single year)"

Dig tends to lead to other Digs in a way TC was used to, even more effectively maybe, so that makes Omni-Tell, as likely the biggest abuser of it, a huge favorite to win after resolving a Show and Tell for Omniscience. However, I'm fine with that: if Omni-Tell can resolve and get the better end of a symmetrical spell like that, they should be rewarded.  I highly doubt (and hope) nothing gets banned at all, myself, but even if I temper my own wishes to allow the meta to adapt naturally, I still think Dig is safe.

Metagame saturation isn't the only (nor the best) measure of ban-worthiness. Brainstorm had a higher saturation than treasure cruise, and cruise was banned first, and that ban was obviously correct.   Brainstorm is more comparable to the fetch-dual manabase system in legacy - it's more of a smoothing/variance reducing tool. Whereas Dig is directly comparable to cruise - an undercosted card advantage spell. So it would certainly make sense for Dig to be banned before brainstorm."

It's just the most recent card.  If saturation is the problem, then Brainstorm and Ponder are far bigger offenders anyway."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,ReallyForeverAlone,8,Tue Jul 7 16:49:43 2015 UTC,"I think you make some decent points about the deck, but you talk about the CounterTop combo as if it recently became oppressive. It has always been oppressive, arguably more so before the printing of Abrupt Decay. The problem is how many people are flocking to Miracles now more than ever because of the power of Dig Through Time. Before the powerful Khans delve spells were printed, Miracles was around but it was kept mostly in check by Abrupt Decay decks. It turns out that those decks don't line up well against cheap card advantage spells like Treasure Cruise and Dig. On the other hand, Miracles feasted on Treasure Cruise decks if they stumbled at all. When Treasure Cruise was banned, a lot of people assumed we would revert back to the BUG heavy meta, but it seems that casting Dig Through Time is actually still better than casting Hymns or Visions. So we are here in a meta where the decks that can leverage Dig Through Time the best are successful and popular. These include Omnitell, Grixis, and Miracles. Looking at the top decks of GP Lille, I am happy with where Legacy is as a format. I'm not convinced banning cards is the answer unless they gravely suppress the options of the format a la Mental Misstep or Survival of the Fittest.   TL;DR CounterTop has always been slow and oppressive, but Miracles is poised where it is right now because of the power of Dig Through Time, which may or may not be banworthy."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,1 point,Tue Jul 7 15:24:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah but CounterTop has been a part of Legacy forever. It's not really an issue on its own, as it ""dies to removal"" and playing around it is an extremely good test of skill. The issue is when you combine the ability to just about prevent people from casting spells with the ability to also remove any creatures that they do manage to get past the lock: Terminus is the issue IMO.  CounterTop used to be a package that would work in a variety of decks. Sometimes it'd get played with Delvers for example, but at the moment because of the strength of Terminus, if you play CounterTop playing anything but Miracles (because Terminus!) is just dumb.   If you really don't want to play Miracles in your deck but you want CounterTop + Terminus, then you're playing UW CounterTop, and why play Stoneforge Mystic or Delver if they're going to be returned to library? So add in Entreat as a win condition. And then you're playing Miracles."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,Mirage08,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:43:27 2015 UTC,"The time issues are a young player issue and not specific to that deck.  The correct thing to do in these situations is call a judge for slow play early and and often.  Counter-Top as a combo has existed since counterbalance was printed and it's never been oppressive on it's own.  It's existence helps keep storm in check and promotes diversity of spells (and has a lot of influence on how pyromancer decks and delver decks are built).  Terminus is what pushes the deck over the edge into tier 1 domination, because it gives the deck game against both aggro and spell oriented strategies without loss of tempo.  Having to tap out for Supreme Verdict, splash for pyroclasm, etc, would weaken the deck considerably in those cases."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,2,Tue Jul 7 21:41:52 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness how big of a dropoff do you think Miracles would take if they had to play Supreme Verdict instead?  I know, for example, that I routinely beat Miracles with Grixis Pyromancer by siding in Envelop (which is really, really good right now since you can hit the dominant combo deck and dominant control deck in the format with it) and countering the Terminus or the Entreat.  For the midrange deck that can present individual must answer threats instead of committing to the board, Verdict is a much bigger problem than Terminus.  And since the ""swarm the board"" decks don't really exist outside of Elves and D&T . . I'm wondering if the dropoff would really be that bad.  Sure the Elves matchup would get worse, but I'd wager the Delver matchups might even get better, if not stay pretty much the same."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,MAC777,2,Tue Jul 7 22:34:44 2015 UTC,Verdict is really only good against blue decks. Terminus is one of the reasons many non-blue strategies (read: zoo) cannot do well. I'd rather non-blue decks get a bump.

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,rifter5000,2,Wed Jul 8 04:19:45 2015 UTC,I think a deck running that combination of cards will lose to so many more things that zoo won't have to worry about it.

U/W Counterbalance control can and will exist without terminus, and with that kind of resiliency in removal will still be favored against Zoo."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,nightfire0,4,Wed Jul 8 04:51:41 2015 UTC,"Verdict is a much bigger problem than Terminus.   Verdict is a joke that can effectively be countered by G. Charm (which many midrange GBx decks are already running), a crazy common sideboard card which itself isn't countered 100% of the time by active countertop like Envelop is.   Verdict is absolutely not better for the delver matchup since it takes 4 lands and double-white to cast; not the easiest resources to line up against the stifle/wasteland decks. Delver players don't care that they can't counter verdict, they'll just hold up their goyf and play it after the wipe.   Without the ability to flip legit miracle Terminus, the deck will just plain start losing more to turn one delvers and early aggro plans; it's just the basic math of it. Terminus has been the deck's ""get out of jail free"" card SOOO much of the time.   D/T already has a fine matchup against miracles (despite how proponents of the latter might brag), but a ban on terminus would bring back all sorts of more Maverick, more elves, and just a bunch of less-common creature archetypes like Deadguy Ale or Pikula. It would also enable more brewing and variation within the Counter Top archetype itself; instead of everyone just playing the ""objective best pure control deck in the format."""

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,jeffderek,3,Tue Jul 7 22:13:40 2015 UTC,"You're taking my quote out of context, I was specifically referring to a non-delver deck when I said Verdict was a bigger problem.    That said, absolutely there is one playable counterspell for Verdict.  There are a LOT more ways to counter terminus.  I don't see how the existence of a 2 color sideboard only counterspell invalidates Verdict when Force of Will can actually hit Terminus.  I think you're undervaluing how strong a U/W control deck with 4 StP's, 4 Snapcasters, and 3 or 4 Verdicts can be against a delver deck.  If you don't give into temptation and splash an unnecessary 3rd color you can pretty easily just play basics and play around stifle a lot of the time.  Getting to 4 is only difficult if you play into the Delver decks' strengths.    Miracles already gets to 4 mana against delver all the damn time.  How do you think they're casting Jace and Entreat?  It's not just that terminus gets them there, they're using other countermagic and removal spells to stay alive to that point.  Yes, there will be games where a turn 1 delver runs them over, but that happens already, where they never draw terminus or the delver player has the force for the terminus."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,da_chicken,-4,Tue Jul 7 22:51:59 2015 UTC,"I love composing a considered rebuttal only to be told I'm twisting someone's words or taking their quote out of context; accusing ppl of logical fallacies is becoming the new Godwin's Law I swear.  Your context was that for ""the midrange deck that can prevent individual must answer threats instead of committing to the board"" (which is really unclear btw, I think you meant commit instead of prevent but god forbid I twist your confusing-ass phrasing) that Verdict is a ""much bigger problem."" I thought the last few words of that sentence made the least sense, so those were the only ones I quoted, and I immediately responded in the context of midrange decks and golgari charms.  You also mentioned that the ""Delver matchups might even get better,"" so I addressed how wrong I thought that was too.   Now that you're up to speed; there's way more than one way around verdict ... anything from Lotleth Troll to Thun--anything with undying or regenerate stapled to it can easily just bypass the spell's effects. Sure, not everyone is going to run Thrun or G. Charm, but more ppl will if Verdict becomes prevalent, and having your wrath effects just not work against a substantial percentage of the field is not where a control deck wants to be. Playing a bunch of Verdicts in a meta with a bunch of rock decks on g charm is like playing Hymn in a Treasure Cruise meta. They want their control elements to work every time.   I think you're missing the crazy tempo difference of the two spells here; in that Verdict costs four times as much as a miracled Terminus. In a game decided by resource management I shouldn't have to tell you how big a deal that is. It's less about how easy either spell is to answer, more about how much you have to commit just to cast it. Tapping out to Verdict only to have your opponent flash in an end-step attacker isn't nearly as good as flipping terminus during their attack step with 3 mana still up.   Sure Miracles gets to 4 and casts win cons ""all the damn time,"" but decks are usually in control by the time they start casting wincons, and it's way easier and more consistent asserting that control with a 1 mana instant-speed spell. Saying miracles can cast 4 mana spells because it can cast jace is like saying turbo eldrazi can cast 15 mana spells because it casts Emrakul. It's missing the point.   Sure, it's not just terminus that gets them there, and sure delver decks will sometimes beat them to death even with terminus in the deck; but that's my whole point. Banning Terminus doesn't cripple the archetype, it makes it moderately less viable and moderately more fair/easier to deal with. Control players will die more often to turn one Mongoose (as they should, honestly), but they'll still wipe boards and win a few games."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,vxicepickxv,3,Tue Jul 7 16:12:25 2015 UTC,"Nice wall of text.  Go back to my original statement.  Read the whole paragraph.  In context.

Apparently I did make a typo and say ""prevent"" instead of ""present"", and I apologize for that."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,da_chicken,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:26:30 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness how big of a dropoff do you think Miracles would take if they had to play Supreme Verdict instead?   It's very clear that you do not have any experience playing miracles.   Sure, in one matchup (Grixis pryomancer) supreme verdict and terminus are equivalent. In most other matchups, they are not close.   The main issue (and the point that you're missing) is that supreme verdict gets ""countered"" by wasteland, port, thalia, and stifle (hitting a land at any time, as opposed to stifling a specific miracle trigger).   In the delver matchups you use terminus as stp (just trading for a single threat) a fair amount of the time, and actually being able to cast it early matters much more than uncounterability."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,alpinefroggy,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:44:25 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you have a lot of experience playing only a single version of miracles, with lots of nonbasics that can get screwed up by wasteland.  The last time I played a delver deck against miracles I kept Volc, Delver, Waste, Waste, Daze, Bolt, flipped Delver on turn one, got it killed in a way I couldn't daze, and then watched my miracles opponent simply fetch 7 basics to start the game.    To think that you'd just go -4 Terminus, +4 Supreme Verdict is obviously asinine, but to think that Miracles wouldn't adapt to the changing world and still manage to exist as a U/W counterbalance control deck with Jace I think is equally naive.  You could easily tweak the deck to play more basics, eliminate the red splash to focus on consistency, and several other things. I wouldn't be entirely shocked if people found a way to include Banishing Stroke to supplement Swords to Plowshares and provide maindeck removal for troublesome artifacts and enchantments.  My point is that Supreme Verdict was printed after terminus so we've never actually had a legacy format where it was the best wrath in the format.  I'd be interested to see what the talented control brewers of the format come up with if Terminus disappears.  I think the existence of a wrath effect that cannot be dazed on turn 4, which was always the big problem with Wrath of God, would result in a very different control deck than we had before terminus.  Back then Merfolk was a legitimately threatening deck, Team America was a big deal with stifle/waste/daze and had just gotten Delver, and there was no particular expectation that you could resolve a wrath.  Now if all you have to do is play basics to get there, you can bet someone will find a way to take advantage of it.  Obviously this is all moot, because Terminus isn't going anywhere.  I just find it to be an interesting thought experiment."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,efil4zaknupome,0,Tue Jul 7 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"I don't really see an argument for Terminus without Top.    Without a consistent way to draw on the opponent's turn and the consistent ability to keep the card that is on top always on top the way only Top does, Terminus loses basically all of it's punch.  In order to Terminus on the opponent's turn without a Top, Miracles needs Brainstorm or Jace to stack the top of the deck, and then Brainstorm or Snapcaster Brainstorm to Terminus on the opponent's turn.  And you need Jace to float the top of the deck consistently."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,nightfire0,3,Tue Jul 7 22:29:40 2015 UTC,"A major peeve of mine is when people complain about how long the deck takes. This is usually due to a combination of poor Miracles pilots, opponents who go into a slack-jawed trance because they are at a loss for how they're supposed to fight through the soft lock, and (this is a biggie) Miracles pilots who don't know how to speak up when their opponent goes into said slack-jawed trance. It's important to be able to assess when your opponent is tanking for too long and to be able to politely tell them, ""We both want to play this match to it's conclusion. I need you to make a play."" That last bit has done wonders for taking me from always finishing in the last 5 minutes to always having time for a beer between rounds.   The only time I ever go to time with the deck is when I'm streaming it and talking a lot (and drinking and forgetting about the clock, and then saying, ""oh shit, guys, I have 5 minutes left! I'ma stop talking now!"")    When I play it in paper, I'll typically go to time once over the course of 7+ rounds, and most of the time, I finish with over 20 minutes. The amount of time I have priority in a typical turn cycle is less than a minute, unless we get into some complex stack battle."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,battousai555,4,Tue Jul 7 15:21:14 2015 UTC,"no player should ever lose their chance of doing well because their opponent is playing a deck that inherently slow. That was considered reason enough to ban Eggs in Modern and 4 Horsemen in Legacy   Eggs (really second sunrise) was banned because the ""extra turns"" took too long, and this could make a tournament run long.   In a large tournament, such as a Grand Prix, when time for the round expires, players are given five additional turns to complete their game. Usually, this takes a few minutes to conclude the rest of the games. However, a player playing Eggs might have a fifteen-minute turn during the additional turns, delaying the start of the next round by ten minutes or more (beyond the next-longest match). Over the course of a day, this can mean an extra hour of waiting for everyone else in the tournament.  The DCI considered which card to ban to deal with this issue. We decided to try and do the narrowest possible ban: one that would reduce the chance of such long turns without banning a card used in other decks. That is why Second Sunrise is banned in Modern.   The Four Horsemen deck is not banned. As Toby Elliot says in ""Horsemyths"":   ""Some players have been told that playing Monolith and Orb together is “illegal”. It’s not, and if you’ve been giving that impression, please don’t.""   So the author uses a false premise to support their call for a ban:    ""... and [these reasons] should be a good enough reason to break up the Counter/Top combo.""   The stronger argument is the second one:   there is not much effective (and practical) removal that can be run against Counterbalance   I agree that Abrupt Decay and Krosan Grip are some of the few (mostly) guaranteed ways to remove this, but I would argue that focusing on removal is a narrow view. Going big is an effective strategy against Miracles. Cavern of Souls/Boseiju pushes you through. Gaddock Teeg is a huge pain for them. Sulfuric Vortex is lights out. Pithing Needle limits the effectiveness of Counterbalance. Engineered Explosives can be cast for large enough to get through Counterbalance."
MTGLegacy,3cfei7,marcospolos,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:23:52 2015 UTC,"I think the issue is that even if you do play around Counterbalance to get threats out, you are vulnerable to Terminus. That's why Terminus is the issue IMO. If to remove all your creatures UW Control ('cause it wouldn't be Miracles without Terminus :P) had to use Engineered Explosives or Supreme Verdict or something then that would make the deck far less oppressive.  CounterTop would be back to being something that could be run in a variety of decks as well."

MTGLegacy,3cfei7,nightfire0,-1,Tue Jul 7 16:37:45 2015 UTC,"I think I have a different opinion of what ""oppressive"" means than this author. 15% is a lot. It's right up there with omnitell a few months ago, or Bug midrange decks pre khans. I suppose that people started playing painter means Bug warped the format right?  It really bothers me that the author called the counteock oppressive. That's kinda the point, it's what the decks is trying to do to win the game. Do we ban chalice of the void now that so many decks run 1 drops? How about cabal therapy and golit probe, I feel pretty oppressed when I get 1 for 3'd by grixis Pyromancer. What about show and tell. People use that to win the game, how am I supposed to play my cards if they already won the game?  Wizards has always been hands off with legacy. They believe the card pool gives people the opportunity to beat any deck that starts to take over. The last 2 bannings for legacy (and I can't confirm since I'm on my phone and lazy) where TC and MM. Both these cards were banned at the first B/R list update after their printing. They quickly demonstrated 2 things: that their power level was too high and seeing warping the format around playing it, invalidating many more strategies than it enabled, and that it was easier to join the card than beat it. You said that elves has been pushed out of the format, which is true. Elves also has trouble against fast combo like storm and omnitell. Storm is another deck that miracles is good against, but storm players, instead of complaining about a card that tries to beat them, changed its game plan to beat miracles. I now have to sideboard 2 izet stati casters to for all the pyromancers coming out of combo sideboards.  Point being, decks beat other decks. Counterlock is a soft lock that can be beaten. Oppressive would imply that it invalidates other strategies, which not only do I not think is true, bit ignores the idea that you should be trying to figure out how to beat strategies that you struggle against. You want elves to be a deck again? If the deck is so God damn good that the only reason it isn't the deck to beat is people dare to counter you combo pieces, run a couple caverns. If that doesn't solves the problem of its fast combo matchup, then maybe don't blame its current performance all on miracles.  If everybody started playing 12post, I either give up miracles or start packing bloodmoons again. If miracles , or the counterlock, truly becomes oppressive, people can either give up, pack kgrips or decays, or caverns, or more blasts, or vials, or bigger curves, or a bazillion other things. Just don't give up."

Any trigger can be defeated IF they have cunning wish to find trickbind, although that forces them to have cunning wish and waste it on finding trickbind instead of winning, so it adds a layer of complexity.  To actually defeat it, however, you need Krosan Grip in response to the first spell they cast off omniscience, which they won't be able to interact with via countermagic or trickbind.  However, this involves having 3 untapped mana after they resolve show and tell, which can be tricky and retard your 2nd/3rd turns."
MTGLegacy,3ch7r1,magictgmike,3,Tue Jul 7 22:40:21 2015 UTC,"Seal has one advantage over the ETB cards and that is when you have multiples or other hate cards to put in off SnT.

They do not get this window to cast any sorceries for free and instead can only cast instants for free in an O-ring scenario.  I'm not sure what advantage you feel you are getting by responding to a particular spell instead of nuking it immediately and really need an example of a beneficial situation.

MTGLegacy,3ch7r1,Mid-Range,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:50:56 2015 UTC,Cunning Wish into trickbind is what you are trying to dodge. (Or them killing you in response) Other than that Omnitell has no other way to stop it (Perhaps find another show and tell and bounce their own omni but that will most likely require another turn to combo.)  I think it's a very middle of the pack answer the best is still Krosan Grip but seal seems fine.
MTGLegacy,3ch7r1,pointofinformation,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:26:33 2015 UTC,"Not well. It's counterable by Force and Spell Pierce (and Spell Snare, if you want to get fancy about it), then the effect is countered by Wish for Trickbind. Krosan Grip is better in a way, but has the clear limitation of having to leave three mana open turn after turn. I feel that Seal/Grip is like putting a bandage on someone with the flu; you're just attacking the problem in the wrong way. Seal lets your opponent's hand, rather than your skill, determine the way events play out. Multiple Seals are an improvement, but that's two turns of likely tapping out/down for a card that isn't progressing your board. Kami of Ancient Law/Keening Apparition/Ronom Unicorn is probably better, which is a sentence that has rarely been said ever. Obviously that's a tremendously narrow card to play compared to the flexibility of a Qasali Pridemage, but I guess if you're insistent on the effect costing 0, it's the only candidate. And if you're siding in enough Seals to have multiples by turn 3...that seems pretty bad. You said you're aware of better options, so I won't list them. Hope I helped with the meta approach, though.  P.S. I do, just for my own edification, want to put it out there that Meddling Mage is not the answer. It so rarely is."

It obviously worked out great, due to the fact that you only met one ""non creature deck"". Why do you consider Revelry better than Krosan Grip? Revelry will rarely get you out of a cb+top lock. I get that grip will cost 4 mana with a thalia on board, but still. Also, why no Null rod or Needles in sb?"
MTGLegacy,3cevy1,echofish,5,Tue Jul 7 12:16:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't actually play four extra removal spells. I played 2 extra. We have 6 flex spots (in my head we actually only have 4, because I believe that the 2 forked bolt should always be there)  2 of those should be removal (fire and Ice, forked bolt, dismember) 2 of those should be extra counter spells (spell pierce, spell snare, etc) and the last two are the real flex slots (Thought scour, Gitaxian Probe, more counters, more removal)  So my options realistically are Probe, Spell Snare, Thought Scour, Spell Pierce, Dismember. I love probe, but just the info it gives you isn't gonna win you the game against Miracles. Dismembering an angel does more, because we put in so much pressure that entreat for one or two is happening more often than not. And more than anything else was I expecting Deathrite Shamans and Tasigar/Angler. My Omnishow match up is already good, so I'd rather have cards that make tough match ups better in the main.  On Krosan Grip 3/4 Mana against a deck that has Wasteland and Ports is completely unrealistic. The DnT match up is so tough, that I want stuff that's good against that more than against miracles. Yes, it might not help me against the counter top lock, but once I'm there I have mostly lost the game anyway unless I have the Krosan Grip right the turn after they play it, because I'll give them enough time to set up their hand. And I like the 2 damage of the revelry against miracles.   I simply had no room for Null Rod or Needles.

I mean sure during the treasure cruise area I played BUG Delver but it never felt as right.  2. Nimbe Mongoose means I have game where the other delver variants have a harder time, like lands and miracles. 3. Good combo match up, due to all the counters and stifle+wasteland 4. Apart from Jeskai delver I feel like I am better positioned in the delver mirrors and I feel like Jeskai Delver is on the decline  So the only horrible match ups I have are D&T, Maverick and lands.

MTGLegacy,3cevy1,Sonicpulsar,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:24:15 2015 UTC,why do you run 2 forked bolt instead of 1 forked 1 fire/ice?
MTGLegacy,3cevy1,rifter5000,2,Tue Jul 7 21:17:18 2015 UTC,Because Forked Bolt is a Sorcery for Goyf and the difference between R and 1R is actually important in a deck that functions of one or two land.
MTGLegacy,3cevy1,Sonicpulsar,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:49:24 2015 UTC,"When I played RUG, I ran 1 Fire/Ice and 1 Forked bolt cause Fire/Ice pitched to force , with 2 maindeck dismember I'd feel kinda awkward with FoW's sometimes I think, or am I just wrong? Also, against reanimator and other fatty decks ice is kinda nice sometimes."
MTGLegacy,3cevy1,rifter5000,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:56:49 2015 UTC,I definitely see what you mean. But especially with Dismember instead of Gitaxian Probe I want more sorceries.  If Reanimator was a bigger part of the meta I would consider Fire/Ice but at the moment it just doesn't seem worth it.

Nissa is pretty much a Strict Upgrade for Wood Elves, so if you have a Nissa on you I'd switch this out immediately. HOWEVER, I think Wood Elves is pretty outdated, at least based, again, on watching the 1 (and only) really good Explorer Pod player that I know.  Over that past year I've seen him go back and forth on what seems like 2 versions of the deck (I don't see his decklist, just what he puts on the board from week to week), BUG and BUGw.  In BUGw, I've seen him use that ""slot"" on [[Derevi, Empyrial Tactician]] (who is surprisingly annoying!), but usually I just seem him abusing [[Pestermite]] or [[Kitchen Finks]].

MTGLegacy,3ch37o,ChaosPainter,5,Tue Jul 7 21:24:09 2015 UTC,"You don't want either splash colour. It opens you up to Wasteland/Back to Basics/Blood Moon/mana screw for not very much upside. It also weakens your Price of Progress which is one of your strongest cards.   Deflecting Palm is not really a reason to splash for white. Your green splash is easily replaced by Skullcrack (which you don't really want) and Smash to Smithereens (which you very much want).  Burn's landbase is usually 12 Mountain + 8 Red Fetchlands (possibly 11 + 8 + Sensei's Divining Top). 18 is too few, and Barbarian Ring doesn't cast Fireblast.  Don't get fancy with burn. Its strength is its speed and consistency.  edit Seeing your meta, you certainly do not need 4 Maindeck Skullcracks. That's a very rare move for Stoneforge heavy metas. You don't seem to have Miracles in your meta! If I were you, and this was my meta I would cut the 4 Skullcrack and 2 Sulfuric Vortex and replace them with a split of Searing Blood/Blaze.  I would also consider putting 2-4 Guerrila Tactics in your sideboard for all those black decks."

MTGLegacy,3ch37o,TheScynic,2,Mon Jul 13 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"I can't comment on the splash colors, I've never tried them. I can only comment on the rest of the list:   Don't play Ring, especially not 2 of them. I played one in a list awhile back, and I honestly ran into more situations where I couldn't cast Fireblast than situations where I wanted to use Ring. It's even worse in your list, because of how many nonbasics you're playing with PoP, along with the fact that you're playing Shocks. You'd be surprised by how many games you win on sub-5 life in Burn, so you want to mitigate self-damage as much as possible. On much the same subject, if you're committed to playing multiple colors, you really need to get Taiga/Plateau. They're dirt cheap. Forked Bolt sucks, get some Searing Blazes in there. I'm really not a fan of Swiftspear in general in Burn, and I'm definitely not a fan of cutting Price of Progresses to fit it in. What exactly is Deflecting Palm supposed to be doing that really helps your plan?"
MTGLegacy,3ch37o,TheScynic,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:48:11 2015 UTC,Deflecting Palm seamed good against Show and Tell decks. Forked Bolt is a 2 for 1 in creature machups. As for Fire Blast in past 5 years of playing Burn I found out I'm rarely casting more than one of them. Green is mainly for sideboard because Leyline of Sanctity is a card. Atarka's Command is a better Skullcrack because it can give u more damage in combat when attacking with Swiftspear and/or Guide.
MTGLegacy,3ch37o,Sir_Laser,2,Tue Jul 7 22:21:18 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, I know why you play the splash, I just can't comment on whether or not they're worth it, because I've never played them.  Deflecting Palm rarely does anything against SnT decks - Assuming they don't already have the counter for it (since they're not really countering much else against you), Omnitell can generally either Dig it's way into a piece of countermagic, or use Firemind's Foresight to double up on Wishes before killing you.   As far as Forked Bolt goes, you're misevaluating Burn's role in creature matchups. You're never trying to fight an attrition battle with Burn, your spells are very inefficient compared to cards like Goyf/SFM/DTT. Sure, you might get a 2-for-1 at some point, maybe hitting a Thalia and a Flickerwisp or something, but that advantage is lost the longer a game goes on, as they continue to cast dudes and hit you with them. The game will continue to go on, since you wasted one of your precious spells to kill a dude, instead of doming them with it. Do you have to kill creatures sometimes? Sure, Thalia is often worth killing, and SFM almost always is, but never will you actually kill 2 creatures that are directly hindering your gameplan. That's why you play a card like Searing Blaze - it'll kill the problem creatures, while still working towards your gameplan of burning your opponent to death.  And regarding Ring - you've never drawn only 2 lands, and had to win off of just those? What if one of your shocks gets wasted? What if you need to cast PoP to win, but you're already sitting at 2 life because you've been repeatedly dinging yourself with the Ring?   Think of how many times you've lost a game with your opponent at 2 life, with you having Threshold and 2 mana open. Then consider that in every one of those situations, you'd only have around a 10% chance that any of those lands were a Ring. It honestly just rarely happens."

Starting w/ a Taiga + 6 CMC 1 spells (otherwise keepable if the Taiga is a basic) is very scary - if they Waste you, you've lost. I run [[Flame Rift]] as a countermeasure vs Leyline too - doesn't target.  This list provided by Patrick Sullivan is a very standard list that should be good vs a diverse meta.  What would you Surgical Extract? Reanimator targets? If you want instant-speed grave hate go with [[Faerie Macabre]] - two targets at the cost of 0 life.

MTGLegacy,3cfauz,Drisoth,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:43:49 2015 UTC,"There is a decent amount of MUD in my area so two cards I play SB to help that matchup Krosan Grip and Phyrexian Revoker (can shut off Metalworker or Monolith). I also have a Maze of Ith maindeck which is quite good at stalling their monsters and getting in Knight activations. Against MUD you generally want to keep a hand with either a turn two Knight so you can start Wasting them ASAP, or a Plow/P-fire for Metalworker.   Belcher can be a coin flip, but if you survive until your second turn anything like Thalia, Canonist, or Teeg will be pretty good, and more than one of these will be game over.  Omni-Tell is definitely a poor matchup, you need to draw multiple hatebears (Thalia, Canonist) and an answer to Omniscience (ideally a Blast to give you a shot at countering SnT) in order to cobble together a win.  The new Dig/Pyromancer decks can be problematic too. You need to have some kind of sweeper in the SB (Engineered Explosives, Electrickery, Sudden Demise? Not sure which is best yet) to handle Elemental swarms in the event that you can't answer Pyro quickly enough."
MTGLegacy,3cfauz,syntaxr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:28:41 2015 UTC,"Cannonist is going into the sideboard, on the sweeper angle I've been using birds as my mana dork, for the synergy with Swords of X & Y but it also enables firespout as a sweeper that doesn't hit your mana dorks. I've found it to be fast enough for elves, the only matchup where you need a sweeper really early. I think damage based sweepers are where you want to be so you can save your creatures with mom if nessesary"
MTGLegacy,3cfauz,syntaxr,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:11:27 2015 UTC,"Being able to not kill your Birds with Firespout is cute, but I don't believe playing more than 1 Birds is correct.

In a lot of post-board games I don't even have Red spells in my deck. I currently play 1 Birds and 3 Hierarchs. The singleton Birds is a great Zenith target (flying can be super relevant, as you recognize), but you never really want the 2nd. I've been very satisfied with this configuration for a while.

The issue with Vintage is accessibility, but if I had a choice between proxy Vintage and proxy Legacy (or legit Vintage and legit Legacy, but legit Vintage will likely never be an option for me due to Wizards' absurd reprint policy) I'd choose Vintage every time.   If they had to choose three, I'd choose Vintage and Legacy and then either Pauper or Limited, but realistically they're always going to have Modern and Standard, so it's Vintage or Legacy and IMO Vintage is better to watch than Legacy.

MTGLegacy,3ce0tr,KangaRod,3,Tue Jul 7 11:47:36 2015 UTC,"As far as I know, nobody actually wants it. That's why I find 'BUT WE PROMISED!' to be a weird excuse: everyone you promised that I've ever talked to just wants more players for the game or doesn't care either way.   Also, I don't see how an alpha black lotus becomes less valuable because a new version with completely different art and frame is printed. Chronicles was different, cards were all printed with original set symbols and such. But modern reprints of old cards aren't like that. Any reduction in value was only there because of TOURNAMENT demand, not collector's demand, and so it should be fine for that tournament demand value to come off the cards.  Any remaining value above the new versions is collectors' value, and I don't see any value above that as being deserved of reservation."

MTGLegacy,3ce0tr,UsaZ,14,Tue Jul 7 12:49:06 2015 UTC,"Eh.. I realize I don't speak for everyone, but as someone who is heavily invested on these cards (I can basically build every deck Legacy except Elves, anything with Port, and anything with LED), I wouldn't mind reprints if it would mean more tournaments and more coverage. It's a beautiful format that I wish would get more exposure. The brutal efficiency with which decks get to operate, thanks to Brainstorm, Ponder, and occasionally the too-good-for-Modern Preordain creates a type of game-play that you don't really get in other formats."

For one, if someone has the collection then if they plan to sell it they're a speculator not a collector, but the majority of people who own legacy staples want to play with them. And reprinting dual lands doesn't make your existing dual lands worse.  It would be FAR more damaging to the value of one's cards for them to print strictly better dual lands in a commander product, for example."
MTGLegacy,3ce0tr,Kaono,1 point,Tue Jul 7 22:16:13 2015 UTC,"And reprinting dual lands doesn't make your existing dual lands worse.   Sure does -- I know a lot of people bought into Legacy by buying MP/SP dual lands. If the Duals were ever reprinted, non NM (e.g. collectible) originals would tank in value. Right now, there's only a $70 difference between a Heavily Played! Underground Sea and a NM one. Nobody is going to pay $180 for a beat up dual land when there's plenty of recently printed NM ones running around."
MTGLegacy,3ce0tr,rifter5000,2,Wed Jul 8 18:21:10 2015 UTC,And why exactly should a heavily played (read: shitty and nearly unplayable) bit of cardboard be worth nearly as much as a NM one?
MTGLegacy,3ce0tr,Kaono,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:42:30 2015 UTC,"I'm offering a rebuttal to the statement that ""reprinting dual lands doesn't make... existing dual lands worse."" People have poor condition duals for the purpose of playing legacy which would lose half or more of their value.  Not saying reprints shouldn't happen, but if it happened it would impact all dual lands that are not considered ""collectible."""
MTGLegacy,3ce0tr,rifter5000,0,Wed Jul 8 23:11:02 2015 UTC,"except for people who have invested time and money into actually building legacy and vintage decks who don't want to see their duals and other reserve list cards plummet in value. besides them, yea, nobody...   Except if you actually talk to people like that (including myself), you know that we actually want others to play with far more than ""EV"".   Magic cards aren't investments.   as well as driving away the big time collectors who have already dished out the dough for the expensive cards.   Collectors don't care about value, they care about rarity. Alpha black lotus's value comes from the rarity of alpha black lotus, not black lotus in general.

Dream Wizards is on the Red line about a mile walk from White Flint station. Its the farthest away and doesn't have the best reputation but is supposed to be pretty good for competitive play.  I've spent time at Curio Cavern and Labyrinth, both are good. I'm planning to check out Dream Wizards this Friday and check the rumors about it as I've heard that its not as bad as people say it is.  I'm expecting certain other people to show up in this post and try to add you to the Labyrinth Legacy mailing list.

Top may be a gigantic pain in the ass when it comes to tournament timing, but I'm not positive banning the only particularly playable colorless library manipulation spell out there is the best way to solve the problem.

Stacking the goblins in that correct order takes forever, not to mention that card is absolutely BUSTED with food chain.   Trust me, I'm an occasional goblins player and would love to see more members back in the tribe but even I have to agree no body likes to watch someone play solitaire with their deck. (yes I hate when high tide players do exactly that)  https://www.youtube.com/watch?list=PL04lbfeNAaS8esFeHVNI_XskBkYQPHq-N&v=3lKc-qGfrxI  ^ Pretty much proving how long the deck takes to play ^"
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,potatodavid,3,Mon Jul 6 16:52:32 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't play Goblins with Food Chain personally; it opens you up to countermagic, which is normally useless against you. I also don't like combo decks and think there are better combo decks than Food-Chain Gobs.   Stacking the deck is much simpler then you'd think- it's always Ringleader- 4 cards, Ringleader - 4 cards. The order of the non-ringleader goblins shouldn't make a difference, although I do understand and agree with your point about slow-play and how awful it is to watch.   As for the banned series, that was probably Caleb's first time ever playing Goblins and the majority of games were done in under 10 minutes, with the longest one stretching to 15. That's still very quick.   Giving Goblins Recruiter back would just mean the deck could keep up with the Blue decks with all their brainstorms and ponders and preordains and digs, and while I'm admittedly immensely biased, I think making Goblins a good deck again would be healthy for Legacy."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,steve2112rush,2,Mon Jul 6 17:21:56 2015 UTC,"I personally would like a mono-red  destroy target artifact goblin for 2 or a better tarfire/sparksmith with haste. Goblins is pretty much an auto win for most combo decks  that are out there. I'm not expecting goblin eidolon but... i can dream. I think we'll have better luck getting new better goblins printed in future sets  before the unbanning of recruiter.   Hey rabblemaster sees fringe play in legacy, and piledriver's reprint hopefully is bringing forth a few more toys and tools to the future of the deck."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,potatodavid,2,Mon Jul 6 18:02:35 2015 UTC,"I'm actually playing 1 Rabblemaster in Goblins now, the card is very good at quickly rebuilding your team after a sweeper whilst also applying a tonne of pressure. It's everything Krenko wants to be, but never is.   Splash white for 4 Ethersworn and you can beat storm quite easily.   A replacement Tin-Street or Tarfire would be very nice though. Even just 1R- Goblin, when it comes into play you may have it deal 2 damage to target creature would be so good. I hate playing tarfire :/"

There are two 3cmc elves that etb kill artifacts, one can even kill enchantments. Goblins have 4cmc and a 2cmc that doesn't work if you try to vial it in or have cost reduction. That's unfortunate.  As for the combo matchup, would it be tremendously unfair if there was a goblin thalia or goblin eidolon printed at 3+cmc?"

Honestly, if you're playing Goblins in 2015 you just have to accept that your combo-matchups are going to be abysmal. I play Death and Taxes when I want to win, and I play Goblins when I want to have fun. Giving us Recruiter would just improve our fair matchups a lot and even them out: Stoneblade etc."

MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,150crawfish,7,Mon Jul 6 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"One thing I take away from going through the banlist, and looking at what cards people want or think should be unbanned, is that most of them are on the ban list not because of power level but because of speed. Black Vise is a t1 ~8 dmg, at minimum. I've taken 16 off Sulfuric Vortex but had the chance to find countermagic for it. Hermit Druid is just another combo that loses to all the same hate, but it's incredibly consistent and easy to get it off t3. There is some bulk rare that is Mindtwist but for double black X, and that 1 mana / 1 turn extra seems to be the difference between banned in legacy / standard unplayable.   Earthcraft is the one card I can see being taken off, because I don't see a way for somebody to accelerate out both it and Squirrel Nest out before t3, you have until t4 to actually beat their onboard presence, and t3 is already an accepted turn to combo off. The exception I see is that if you fizzle their combo, they can go off with the same pieces again and again until you run out of answers. That might put its power level over the top.  Then there is Frantic Search. High Tide isn't exactly threatening to take over, and unless there is some combo I'm unaware off, it doesn't seem that scary to play a 3 mana card disadvantage spell.  Other than those, I don't think anything else can be realistically considered for unbanning. In particular I see Survival of the Fittest talked about, probably because it's a really fun card to play with and not an obvious t3 combo kill, so not considered that powerful relative to everything else going on. But it is. It's Legacy's Birthing Pod, the longer the game goes on and the more cards introduced to the game, the more powerful it becomes."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,tophaloaf,6,Mon Jul 6 16:13:31 2015 UTC,"As a high tide player Frantic Search is just about the only card I'd look forward to that wouldn't ruin the meta. Mystical Tutor would go in every blue deck, Mental Misstep would go in EVERY deck period.   I could understand if Frantic doesn't come back- but it's wishful thinking. Even aside from High Tide.. I think Oops could possibly play it as a pseudo [[Manamorphose]] but even that's far fetched. I really don't see anyone able to abuse this card more than High Tide would- and we can't really even ""break"" the card. Mana certainly isn't a bottleneck for us, if it was we'd be maining [[Snap]] and [[Cloud of Faeries]] much MORE consistently"
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,batvanvaiych,0,Mon Jul 6 16:15:55 2015 UTC,"improving high tide would heavily affect the meta, that card is broken, it's just a good card for your pet deck so you're not seeing it."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,magictgmike,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:17:07 2015 UTC,"...how? It doesn't make our combo faster, it MARGINALLY makes the combo more reliable,  and we would have to sacrifice better draw engines to slot it in. What would I take out? 1 Brainstorm, 1 Ponder, and 1 Preordain; just to leave me with 3 of each. I don't know about you, but unless I'm in the middle of my combo, I'd likely take any of those 3 over Search. If I'm using it to cantrip and dig pre-combo, what would I discard? I doubt there's any cards besides superfluous Time Spirals, Wishes or a single High Tide id be willing to discard, and if I'm using it during the combo, what will I be discarding- lands? I don't see us getting a giant advantage from any point of this scenario.   Our deck is purely made of Cantrips to find the combo/protection.. and The Combo/Protection pieces. None of those are worth spending 3 mana to toss in the grave, and certainly not worth taking out to slot in a 3 mana cantrip.   Honestly, I see Dredge, Oops, and Reanimator abusing this more than us. We see it as a free cantrip and surplus mana- they see it as free discard and filter."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,batvanvaiych,0,Mon Jul 6 23:28:10 2015 UTC,"The card correlates easiest to meditate, as it's effectively one of the gas cards you are trying to draw off the meditate.  You're drawing a bunch of islands you don't really need as well.  It's definitely better in the Reset version than Spiral Tide."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,magictgmike,2,Mon Jul 6 23:43:50 2015 UTC,"Meditate isn't as influencing in the tide build as it looks on paper. Meditate is a dead draw outside of the combo, can still whiff and legitimately kills you when it does. There isn't a single deck in legacy im willing to give an extra turn to just willy nilly. Plus, you can't Search on an empty hand. You'll immediately discard both cards you drew.. At least you can cantrip or Meditate on an empty hand.   I just really don't see a scenario where Search can break (Spiral) High Tide. I will agree though, that it is better in Reset than Spiral. But once again- what would you slot it in instead of? The ONLY place I can see it taking, would be in place of DTT should that get banned (which I doubt will happen), but even at that it's a lack luster alternative. It still creates card disadvantage, and requires you to sacrifice space for a card that could otherwise be beneficial."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,batvanvaiych,10,Tue Jul 7 00:09:36 2015 UTC,"I think Frantic Search is incredibly deceptively powerful.  As a sometimes High Tide player I don't think it's even remotely unbannable.  I'd immediately put down every other deck I play and play High Tide full time until they banned part of the deck.  There's nothing scary about a 3 mana card disadvantage spell.  There's something very, very scary about a card selection spell that ADDS mana to you mana pool instead of taking it away.  Especially when you think about what Frantic Search would do to enabling Dig Through Time in that deck.  Right now Dig is really difficult to get back up to post-spiral, but if you spiraled into Frantic Search | Dig Through Time you'd be going really deep really fast."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,jeffderek,4,Mon Jul 6 17:01:58 2015 UTC,This guy.   I ran a hypothetical  High Tide list with Frantic Search and it was completely nuts. No need to run clunky stuff like Turnabout or Candles. All your gas now produces new cards and mana.

But it is. It's Legacy's Birthing Pod, the longer the game goes on and the more cards introduced to the game, the more powerful it becomes.   I didn't play when Survival of the Fittest was legal, so I never saw it in action. All I know about it is the Basking Rootwalla and Vengevine interaction. How do you get a turn 3 kill with it? And why is it any more degenerate than other combos that can kill on or before turn 3?"
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,MASTICATOR_NORD,3,Mon Jul 6 16:42:53 2015 UTC,"The issue (kinda like pod) is that it's both a combo piece and a value card in one.  For instance, you could play a BUG midrange/reanimator hybrid deck that can discard Iona or Griselbrand to tutor up either another fatty (that can be discarded on a later turn), or value creatures.  The problem isn't that it can do either of those things, it's that it can do both."

MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,MASTICATOR_NORD,3,Mon Jul 6 18:12:12 2015 UTC,"Well, no. IIRC, the 6-month period before Survival was banned it had ~57% winrate on average and it's winrate for it's worst match-up was ~51%. That's too good - it was literally the best deck. There are more hate cards for Survival now (Abrupt Decay is probably the most prominent example), but it's not enough since they can survival in response. If survival was unbanned I'd run 3-4 Pithing Needle mainboard as Burn just to have a chance.  IDK if you know/remember the old Mirrodin Standard Affinity broken-ness, where the only playable Top Tier deck was Affinity - Anti-Affinity decks w/ 16 artifact hate card were not good enough. Survival's a bit like that."

In fact, Consult was so good Vampiric Tutor wasn't played as a 4-of when both was legal in extended! The other enabler for Necro-dominance during extended is gone too - Mana Vault.

MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Mon Jul 6 17:31:52 2015 UTC,Demonic Consultation absolutely needs to stay banned.  It's a one B instant speed demonic tutor.  The only reason it isn't the best card in vintage is the restricted list making most of its targets dangerous.  In legacy it would be completely nuts.
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,randomnickname99,3,Wed Jul 8 12:36:15 2015 UTC,"Funny thing, I was around when necro was legal. Necro was bad in the beginning but when wizards started banning everything that was better than necro , necro became good. Truth be told, necro would be awful against delver etc, but would be good against control or slow combo"

MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,dustindblack,2,Mon Jul 6 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"its powerful enough to make black splashing x decks playable again, or heck even mono black."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,rrrOuta,5,Mon Jul 6 18:21:53 2015 UTC,"The people who always suggest unbanning Necro usually weren't around when it was legal   It hasn't been legal since the Clinton era, and so much has changed since then. It's three mana, sorcery speed, TRIPLE black, and doesn't win the game on its own. I don't see how it's much worse than Show & Tell. FTR, I think S&T should be banned, but I don't think even if Necro was legal it would be that oppressive. Turn 1 Dark Ritual into Necro from a Storm player is the worst-case scenario and there's still a non-zero chance they'll whiff or you'll still have an answer for them, even pre-board."

MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,alphastryk,7,Mon Jul 6 15:48:25 2015 UTC,How is Survival safe?
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,Sir_Laser,6,Mon Jul 6 16:20:22 2015 UTC,"When it was banned neither Abrupt Decay (solid maindeckable survival hate) nor Rest in Peace (not only good combo hate for survival combo but something that prevents people from just tutoring for Witness to get back the survival you just killed) existed.  The environment is very, very different from what it was when Survival was banned.  Also Deathrite exists.  Survival already played manadorks so it probably doesn't speed them up that much, if at all, but it definitely opens up a new avenue to fighting them.  if they have enough mana they'll definitely get a vengevine or two, but not all of 'em."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,jeffderek,2,Mon Jul 6 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind Survival decks can play Deathrite and Decay as well. And it's not all about Vengevines, although that's probably the easiest/most straightforward path to victory for them. The problem I have w/ Survival is that it, as a repeatable engine & tutor, enables true Aggro-Control-Combo decks. No matter where your deck is positioned on the metagame clock a Survival deck can position itself favorably vs. your deck (i.e. it is the ultimate toolbox/The Answer deck). Removal (which isn't as effective as one would think because they can survival in response unless you play something like Krosan Grip) will slow it down, but it has Plan B in the form of AEther Vial + [[Fauna Shaman]].  IDK if you care for some dude on the internet doing playtesting w/ Survival from last year but CalebD has a series of videos where he test a Survival deck against other decks here: https://goo.gl/TVS34r"

Tapping out to cast necro on turn 3 is reaaaallly slow and I think it wouldn't be a problem.
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,rrrOuta,2,Mon Jul 6 16:55:55 2015 UTC,"Tapping out to cast necro on turn 3 is reaaaallly slow and I think it wouldn't be a problem.   Well less slow if you've just gone turn 1 Thoughtseize into turn 2 Hymn into turn 3 Necro, to be fair."
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,rifter5000,3,Mon Jul 6 21:43:46 2015 UTC,Spirit of the Lab doesn't work vs Necro because you're putting cards into hand from exile instead of actually drawing them.
MTGLegacy,3cb7m7,Sir_Laser,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"yeah but the point im trying to make is that having necro + ritual resolve on turn 1 especially in this meta is really uncommon.

MTGLegacy,3c9e3r,KangaRod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:20:06 2015 UTC,I just have two questions about your list:  Why 3 FoW + 1 Misdirection rather than 4 FoW? Why 2 Opt and only 1 Preordain?
MTGLegacy,3c9e3r,Saluton,1 point,Mon Jul 6 08:20:04 2015 UTC,I'm curious about this too
MTGLegacy,3c9e3r,KangaRod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:19:15 2015 UTC,"Why 3 FoW + 1 Misdirection rather than 4 FoW?   Ultimately, for budget reasons. I only own 3 Forces. Although I haven't felt like it's hurt me all that much here. Misdirection also helps me deal with creature removal which is the easiest way to attack this deck. I've taken out Delvers and a TNN by Misdirecting opposing bolts into them. Misdirection also does a reasonable impression of Force in a counter fight (and is actually better against Flusterstorm!).  I've only had one game where I really needed it to a Force.   Why 2 Opt and only 1 Preordain?   These numbers aren't perfect, but the Opt is a concession to wanting more instant speed cantrips (messes up their Mentor-math, get instant value out of pyromancer, etc.). The Preordain is just another powerful dig spell that gasses me up in the late game.  These 3 slots (and the 2 myth realized) are definitely the most flexible. What do you suggest?"
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,iPhone747,43,Mon Jul 6 02:42:29 2015 UTC,Nothing.
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,wintermute93,12,Mon Jul 6 03:11:49 2015 UTC,I don't think it would be reasonable to ban either. They aren't exactly dominating the format the way UR Delver did when cruise was legal.
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,babyrhino,2,Mon Jul 6 02:52:09 2015 UTC,U/R dominated? I guess I forgot that GP top 8 in New Jersey where 7 blue/red decks top 8'd....

MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,cyberstrider,-2,Mon Jul 6 22:56:25 2015 UTC,"Not dominating?  Top 2 in Lille and 27% of Day 2 decks were either Omni (9.8%) or Miracles (17.2%).  That's a stagnant position.  Been there, done that.  Boring, boring, boring.  Time for change.  Any combination of banning Terminus, Top, CB or Dig will allow more diversity and innovation."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,cyberstrider,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:55:29 2015 UTC,This is data from one tournament and not enough to establish any usable statistical trend. Right now both are relatively popular decks and as a result more will be present. A lot more data is needed before we can say it's a problem with any real certainty. Further Legacy is a slower moving format and if those decks do consistently rise to the top the format needs a chance to evolve naturally before the ban hammer is brought out.
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,babyrhino,7,Mon Jul 6 19:37:55 2015 UTC,"Nothing will be banned.    I want Counterbalance banned. It is unfun to play against, encourages abuse of SDT, and requires people to play narrow answers OR for Wizards to print clumsy answers like Abrupt Decay or Cavern of Souls that remove nuance from the format.    If they ban anything it will be one of the cards you mentioned and it will be a big mistake."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,notaprisoner,17,Mon Jul 6 12:51:43 2015 UTC,"It seems after every tournament in any format people are talking about what needs to be banned. I remember people insisting SnT get banned because Omnitell was too strong, but time seems to have fixed that. I wonder how many people wanted Stoneforge or Stifle banned when RUG and Stoneblade were the decks to beat. Wizards won't ban anything until there is a reason to do so, and being the top deck at a tournament is not a good reason."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,tophaloaf,14,Mon Jul 6 02:58:14 2015 UTC,Nobody wanted Stoneforge nor Stifle banned.

Also the format has much stronger ""answers"" that keep things from being oppressive once the meta stabilizes."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,bunkoRtist,11,Mon Jul 6 06:01:21 2015 UTC,Just wanted to add - There are no Legacy Pro Tours. Cards that'll get banned in Modern because it will create bad Pro Tour environments is non existent.

MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,logopolys_,4,Mon Jul 6 15:36:26 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your sentiment. I think there's almost nothing on the Modern ban list at this point that doesn't deserve to be banned. Pod was given so many chances, and value Pod killed any semblance of strategy to the deck. The last GP winner with the deck had never piloted it before that Day 1. Legacy has been more conservative simply because the format has been around longer and had it's demons purged before most of todays players ever heard of Magic. I fully believe Modern will follow a similar path"
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,dj_sliceosome,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:56:50 2015 UTC,"I would disagree that everything on the list should be banned. I think that there are far too many cards on the list simply because WotC is scared of combo for their new format. Ponder, Preordain, Rite of Flame, Dread Return, and Seething Song all fall under that umbrella. I personally don't see why Dread Return is banned, it's not like it's any faster or stronger than the current Goryo's Vengeance strategies. It would let Dredge become a proper Modern deck, which would open up a little diversity in the format."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,mulltalica,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:59:59 2015 UTC,Wizards is scared of it because Modern doesn't have the tools to fight it.  The lack of free counter spells outside of Disrupting Shoal means that combo decks have 2-3 turns of little to no interaction in which to go off.
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,allenthar,-10,Thu Jul 9 13:58:45 2015 UTC,being the top deck at a tournament is not a good reason   cough Pod
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,ReallyForeverAlone,10,Mon Jul 6 03:45:23 2015 UTC,"Pod wasn't the top deck at a tournament, it was the top deck at every tournament.  It didn't always win, but it dominated Top 8s.  Plus, the very nature of new value creatures always being printed meant that Pod would only get better and never worse.  Banning Pod was absolutely the right choice.  People complained about it until they realized they could build the exact same decks with Collected Company."

MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,MASTICATOR_NORD,5,Mon Jul 6 14:24:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly I don't think Miracles needs anything banned from it, I like the format right now and it would be a huge change to the format if miracles just went away. Banning top also hurts other decks (Nic fit, Doomsday, 12 post, and most likely several other archetypes I am not familiar with)  I would like to see a card printed that miracles does not interact well with. (Possibly in the commander set?) What should it do? I'm not sure. But I have not been a fan of the heavy handed policing and banning of modern and I would not like to see it be that way in legacy. But I do think Miracles is to well positioned right now in the meta.   I don't think that anything can be unbanned that will effect miracles much without warping the format a ton. Survival is probably the safest unban that miracles would care about and even that would drastically change the meta game. Printing a new card is my ideal solution, but it would have to be like True-Name power leveled pushed and directly effect miracles. And if a card had to go I'd rather it be Dig than top. I hate miracles and even I don't think the deck needs to go away."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,Mid-Range,2,Mon Jul 6 09:56:56 2015 UTC,Slightly off topic: is there a legacy doomsday deck that works?
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,slobbishbodysfw,3,Mon Jul 6 12:43:29 2015 UTC,"For suitably broad definitions of ""works"", yes. It's not nearly as good a choice as ANT/TES as far as storm decks go, but if you don't care about winning a GP or an Open or whatever, it's a reasonable deck to play for fun."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,wintermute93,2,Mon Jul 6 13:31:22 2015 UTC,"Doomsday is by far the most hilarious card I've seen played.  If it's good enough to spike an FNM, it's good enough for me!"

MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,lordoftheshadows,1 point,Mon Jul 6 13:37:50 2015 UTC,"Are there any reasons to play Doomsday over ANT?  They seem to have a similar win condition, but ANT seems less fragile, and more consistent."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,slobbishbodysfw,4,Mon Jul 6 14:48:52 2015 UTC,"DDFT has the most inevitability out of any of the storm decks. If the game goes long and I find and resolve a doomsday, it's just GG where as a lone infernal tutor in hand isn't always gonna get you there in ANT. I also like that fact that I know, as soon as I cast Doomsday, what my avenue to victory will be. Sometimes when I play ANT or TES you have to rely on a ponder or brainstorm hitting gas or you fizzle, DDFT never fizzles as I know what my pile will be.  Honestly, DDFT is probably worse than TES or ANT, as other have suggested, but I've been playing it for so long that it just makes more sense to me and I feel like I have a better shot winning with it than the other storm decks."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,Countertoplol,2,Mon Jul 6 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Permanent based hate like Leyline, sphere, and Gaddick Tegg are very easy for Doomsday to beat.  Doomsday is a more flexible deck that, in general, has outs to more situations.  The deck also can play higher impact sideboard cards because it has more filtering power than ANT or TES.  Also, it's really fun to play."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,lordoftheshadows,1 point,Mon Jul 6 14:51:53 2015 UTC,"i think if something goes its definitely dig. as a card that isn't a 4 of in all blue decks, it can set back some decks without crippling them, and its not as interesting as top. the counterbalance soft lock is something you can beat by counter-strategising what they expect and therefore what they put on top. in that way it creates an interesting decision for both players, whereas DTT does not."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,rumballtron,4,Mon Jul 6 18:45:53 2015 UTC,"Top doesn't need to be banned, there is a difference between ""should not exist"" and ""ban it with fire"", top is obnoxious, in that, it does let players tank and stall out games, however, it's been in the format for years and unless WOTC decides to ban it for logistic reasons, I doubt it will go, it is a remarkably resource intensive card (in the early stages of the game, it eats up quite a bit of your available mana relatively speaking),   DTT I'm undecided on, it encourages blue but it definitely opened the format up to non-miracle control decks (although I'm pretty sure the delver variants its enabled has done better, which honestly isn't a good thing imp)"

MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,Unconfidence,2,Mon Jul 6 10:28:20 2015 UTC,"At first I thought that you were crazy, but as I thought about it more, it didn't seem like a half bad idea. More diversity in decks, and it's a 1/1 for 2 with no protection by itself. Dies to bolt, swords, removing a single jitte counter, has to be built around, and the strategy it enables isn't as good as it once was."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,legitimatelySLND,2,Thu Jul 9 04:02:00 2015 UTC,"Precisely.  It's a creature that has the same power level as SnT in an SnT deck, but which costs 2 and activates for 1.  I would sat SnT is much more powerful than Hermit Druid, in their respective decks, so why not unban him?"
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,Unconfidence,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:11:57 2015 UTC,"Pretty much. With all the removal flying around these days, angry druid decks would have to run force, daze, pierce, dispel, and even possibly counterspell (in a deck with no basics, stringent mana requirements aren't that big of an issue). Misdirection might also be required for abrupt decay. Even then, if you manage to activate hermit druid, your choice of win conditions is probably going to be necrotic ooze which can't protect itself very easily, although a 1-of prognostic sphinx in the deck might work. Also, pithing needle is a card, along with the creature version DnT plays, which means abrupt decay is also a thing. Blood moon seriously fucks you, what with the whole ""no basics"" thing, and a well timed wasteland could end the game before it begins on a sketchy keep. Might need to run countertop as a backup plan. brb brewing  TL;DR: Although powerful, hermit druid requires jumping through so many hoops that it probably just isn't as good as something like SnT in SnT decks."

But then, there would be others who seek to break it (which they should).  And then it's comes down to splitting hairs about what exactly a ""fair deck"" is.    Is getting back a Vengevine a fair play?  Probably.  Is getting back four of them fair?  Not as fair as casting one, but more fair than 20 Goblins on turn 1.  Is getting back an Iona fair?  Hmm...."

And then we have wrath for w in the heaviest control shell out there, where resolving a Surfit would be an achievement by itself.    Surfit was good back in the day. In the last 5 years, wotc gave us lots of MUCH better cards. Look at 2010 top tier decks, and look at current top tier decks:   http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=807&f=LE - Suvival and Belcher + Dredge decks? Proves the point that surfit is just another fair deck that folds to combo.   http://mtgtop8.com/event?e=779&d=208014&f=LE - miracles w/o miracles topps the event. Now add a wrath for w into that list, and we'll see how surfit does. And it had sneak attack w/o Griselbrand...and there was a zoo deck (Infect will lol all the way tot he bank at those).

I look forward to hearing what you have to say, especially re: its banning."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,Morzas,10,Mon Jul 6 05:12:56 2015 UTC,"Cruise completely warped the format and was clear from about 2 weeks in that it needed to go.  Delver decks had the better long game vs Miracles, and that's not particularly healthy.  Top has been around forever and nothing new has changed to make it any worse than it already was.  I don't see any reason to ban it that didn't already exist.    The real reason I think they won't ban top, though, is that they'd have to deal with the PR fallout of banning the only playable colorless library manipulation while leaving the most egregious blue offenders alone.  Explain to the Jund deck that made top 32 of the GP with 2 Tops or the monogreen 12post lists that play 3 or 4 why top is the problem, not Brainstorm."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,jeffderek,8,Mon Jul 6 11:52:14 2015 UTC,"cruise got banned for total format warping.  virtually every deck played it, and built around it, and there was a huge list of cards that were traditionally legacy staples, but were now unplayable because of it.  no one played wasteland or stifle anymore because you were just investing resources to fuel their cruise.  UR burn and jeskai burn took huge percentages of the large event meta, well over 50% between the two, and people were playing pyroblast maindeck.  if top gets the ban, it won't be for warping... it'll be because a huge % of games where top hits the board go to time.  that's why it was banned from modern.  literally every single paper match i've had with miracles has gone to time.  on top of that, MTGO and paper are different.  on MTGO, if you slow-play with top, you get utterly punished, because you have your own clock.  but in paper, if the top player wins game 1, most will just slowplay game 2 for the 1-0-1 win.  in other words, paper play rewards you for toxic behavior.  just watch people on cam.  if the miracles player wins game 1, they take their sweet ass time shuffling, fetching, topping, etc, but if the miracles player loses game 1, they hurry up.  because if they don't, they lose the match.  honestly, i stopped playing legacy because of miracles.  legacy is hands-down, the best format, but miracles is just unfun to play against. some people have mentioned this is actually intentional by wizards... that legacy is a better format across the board.  the solid countermagic allows tempo decks to keep combo and non-interactive decks in line, unlike modern which is easily 70%+ combo or otherwise uninteractive decks.  but as long as legacy is strong, people aren't in a rush to move to modern.  by having a toxic deck in legacy, it pushes people out of legacy, and most will go to modern."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,unstoppable-force,8,Mon Jul 6 12:38:56 2015 UTC,"literally every single paper match i've had with miracles has gone to time.   I think at a certain point you have to consider that you might be the problem there.... Very few of the paper matches I've played against Miracles have gone to time, and there are hundreds. And I play D&T, one of the matchups that tends to go longer. Obviously the majority of Miracles matches don't go to time, or else it wouldn't be such a popular deck, so if literally all of yours are, it's probably because you're too slow playing against Miracles.    some people have mentioned this is actually intentional by wizards   That's gotta be the weirdest conspiracy theory I've ever heard."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,TheBotherer,3,Mon Jul 6 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"The only other matches I've had go to time are random 1 off matches.

I've piloted RUG delver, esper deathblade, sneak and show, and the old version of omnitell with burning wish.  It's specifically miracles players in paper magic taking forever to top, decide, fetch, shuffle, top, decide again, etc.  I've successfully had judges warn them for slow play multiple times too.  Also, this is competitive REL... not nightlies or FNMs."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,unstoppable-force,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:50:12 2015 UTC,"I meant more that perhaps you don't know how to play against Miracles, and that is causing you to play slowly against specifically them. Miracles is a control deck. Control decks like to take it into the long game. You have to learn how to play efficiently against them just as much as they have to learn to pilot their decks efficiently, because control decks are a part of Magic.  There's no denying that Miracles matches have a tendency to go long, but if anywhere near the percentage of matches you're claiming went to time did so, it would be considered a terrible deck, not possibly the best one. Miracles players are not performing the maneuvers you talk about on every turn. They are doing that rarely. Most of their turns consist of topping, playing a land, and passing. Experienced Miracles pilots resolve Top activations pretty quickly. If you're actually literally only played against inexperienced Miracles players, then either you've had absolutely astoundingly bad luck, or you haven't played much Legacy."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,TheBotherer,2,Mon Jul 6 20:33:14 2015 UTC,"it's not my ability (or lackthereof) in playing against control.  i say that because i've played with and against plenty of other control decks fine.  i played during the UW control days, when it became esper control, and then esper deathblade.  i was one of the early adopters in adding DRS to esper control (i'm just not good enough to T8 with it and make it look cool).  the problem is specifically miracles, specifically in paper magic, and specifically because of top activations taking forever with all the shuffles and digs in between.  on paper, i've mostly just played GPs/SCGOs.  i haven't played in many premiers because miracles started really taking over around the same time that the changeover started.  i usually made it to rounds 7-9 or so before dropping with an x-3 record.  in earlier matches, yes, players are actively bad and take forever.  in later matches, you have to start calling a judge to pressure them to speed up, because players that get that far know very well how to play the clock to their advantage.  yes, those matches still went to time.  one of the players ended up getting a match loss (or game loss that was effectively a match loss) later that day, because he'd received too many slow play warnings that day.  i've played in many smaller events online (e.g. dailies), but this problem just doesn't exist there.  if a miracles player durdles online, they get punished for it.  even funnier, i've brought ensnaring bridge in just to punish miracles players online.  i can sit at 3 cards in the grip and just block snaps for days, and i've run multiple people's clocks out.  of course, because of the shared clock, that's not a solution for paper magic.  i would lean towards me getting just ridiculously bad luck, except (1) i've heard this same complaint (high % of paper matches against miracles going to time) from many people, and (2) wotc had to ban top from modern because too many people were running it to time."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,unstoppable-force,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"This is just a fact: if anywhere near 100% of all Miracles matches went to time, the deck would see no play whatsoever. There are no two ways about this.   The only constant in this situation is you. If you have played against any reasonable number of Miracles players and matches, it is statistically absurd for every match to have gone to time always because of your opponent. Why can other people finish their matches against Miracles on time much more often than not, but you can't even once?   It's really hard to look at a situation like this and see it from an unbiased point of view. I understand the frustration. Maybe this just really is how it is for you, but even if it is somehow the fault of your opponents, despite the odds, surely you understand that it is not normal.   Sensei's Divining Top was on the initial ban list in Modern. It has never been Modern-legal, since the second the format existed. A Modern-legal deck with Top in it has never existed."

Sensei's Divining Top was on the initial ban list in Modern. It has never been Modern-legal, since the second the format existed. A Modern-legal deck with Top in it has never existed.    although SDT was banned in extended (which became modern) since 2008, modern was originally an online format (added may 2011).  SDT was on-again-off-again banned depending on the organizers.  it wasn't originally banned online.  SDT wasn't officially banned until august 2011 when modern became an officially sanctioned paper format: http://mtgsalvation.gamepedia.com/Timeline_of_DCI_bans_and_restrictions  and whether you like it or not, here's the official discussion on why top is banned in modern...    Data from tournaments held in previous Extended formats showed that Sensei's Divining Top takes too long to play with. When rounds go to time, everyone in the entire tournament has less fun. If Modern ever caught on seriously, we would likely have to ban Top, so we decided to reflect that in this experiment."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,unstoppable-force,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:42:24 2015 UTC,"You said this:   literally every single paper match i've had with miracles has gone to time   which there is no reason to say unless we are supposed to extrapolate that to mean you think it's anywhere close to normal.   Of course the reason why Top is banned in Modern is because Wizards doesn't like the amount of time it can take up. I never stated otherwise. However, it is disingenuous to not consider the other factors at work. Context is everything. Wizards has also stated many times that they don't like fetchlands in Standard because they don't like how much time the shuffling takes up. In other formats, this is seen as a non-issue. In Modern, where the overall power level is a lot lower, and there is no Brainstorm to put cards back on top to set up Miracles, winning with Top would take a lot longer than in a more powerful format like Legacy.   You can't just say ""because something is this way in this format that means it is the same way in this other format"". Thirst For Knowledge is restricted in Vintage, but seen as unplayable in Legacy. It's like if someone said ""oh, Lotus Petal/Trinisphere/Merchant Scroll/Ponder doesn't dominate Legacy, therefore it'd be safe to unrestrict it in Vintage!"" The artifact lands are banned in Modern, but virtually unplayed in Legacy. Same goes for a huge amount of the Modern ban list. Just because Top would be too slow in Modern doesn't automatically mean it is in Legacy."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,TheBotherer,2,Tue Jul 7 15:12:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's a sign that going to time comes from something else. I've easily played over 500 matches with miracles, and I've gone to time less than 25 times"

Treasure Cruise was an extreme case. Miracles is not an extreme case.    My proposed solution is a Null Rod bear. A 2/2 for two mana, either for 1W, 2, 1G, or even GW.

You play all those cards in the same deck to ensure that you are able to reliably cast whatever you need to cast and in conjuction with probe/force/discard/(maybe daze if it's t1?) you can see if your opponent has the counter. Also, losing cards to petal/LED is nothing compared to how many cards you can get from necro."
MTGLegacy,3c9c7v,billygoat210,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:24:11 2015 UTC,My point was that you can't use the mana from LED to cast a necro... EDIT. Also if you use 2 petals to get necro out and it gets countered you pretty much lose the game.

Learning how to top quickly and correctly is a big part of playing miracles, and is a hurdle that should be passed before playing it in a tournament."

MTGLegacy,3c863u,amiolas,7,Sun Jul 5 20:21:45 2015 UTC,"My only real problem with the suggestion is that in my experience the problem with playing against miracles is usually trying to resolve the reanimation package in the first place rather than keeping whatever I get (grave titan or inkwell usually) around. I do accept that being able to blank miracles's creature removal (terminus and StP and to a lesser degree Karakas) is interesting, but it sounds like you are proposing one of two things. Either you try and jam the reanimation on another target in t1/t2 and when miracles deals with that first target you then try and jam [[Disciple of the Ring]] while keeping mana up or you simply jam Disciple of the Ring when you have mana up.   The problem with both of these is because your reanimation is happening later in the game there is a very real chance that many of the controlling elements miracles has against us come online before t3. RiP; grafdiggers and counterbalance are all easy enough to assemble before t3 especially g2 on the play (which Miracles is likely to be in a scenario in which you board this in). Granted those are all things we have to deal with anyway Disciple or no, but they are what make the miracles matchup difficult more so than the creature removal.   In my eyes, the difference between this and Grave Titan (which can effectively blank/worsen StP) is Disciple also blanks Terminus. Disciple can enable you to extract value from your hand in the face of a counterbalance lock, and Disciple can stop Clique, Entreat wins. But this comes at a cost of needing/wanting to jam it a turn or two later so that you can have mana up.   I have my doubts about this largely because I feel like in g2 against miracles the pressure is more on resolving a threat than getting it to stick around but fully accept that the opportunity cost of putting one of these in the board to have a chance at winning the late game may well warrant actual play testing, especially so in miracles heavy metas, but I am not particularly optimistic.   Also do you mind posting your list? You mention having negates in your deck which are not commonly played in reanimator, so I somewhat suspect you are running a slightly unorthodox build."
MTGLegacy,3c863u,thebutton,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:40:50 2015 UTC,"It's pretty similar for the most part outside of snaps instead of S&T's, a regular BUg version.

MTGLegacy,3c863u,HeadbangsToMahler,4,Mon Jul 6 05:35:39 2015 UTC,Are you reanimating her and then just holding up mana? That's a little different than normal when you will tap out to reanimate something and then fight over it with free counterspells. Did you find it was better than just drawing 7 with griselbrand?
MTGLegacy,3c863u,Noon2Dusk,4,Sun Jul 5 21:32:47 2015 UTC,"I have to ask myself the same question. In which situation is it better then Griselbrand? Sure it looks awesome against miracles late game, but should you even be trying to get to the mid/late game against miracles?"
MTGLegacy,3c863u,thebutton,2,Sun Jul 5 21:45:52 2015 UTC,"but should you even be trying to get to the mid/late game against miracles?   I feel like the concept of sticking to a decks gameplan is slightly overemphasized. Lots of people argue this when establishing sideboards that you should stick to the gameplan and try to set up the deck to win the fight it is designed to fight. This is a good concept and nobody is disputing that Reanimator's best chances of winning against miracles are by jamming a threat t1/t2 and protecting it and Griselbrand is probably the best way to do that.   But the real question when deciding on a sideboard is not should we even try to win late game but rather what is cost of improving my late game against miracles both in the Reanimator vs. Miracles match up and in a tournament.   It's not too difficult to see that you may well think that (depending on how good Disciple of the Ring is in testing)  it is worth boarding one in g2 in lieu of a griselbrand against miracles because while you may fail to jam griselbrand early in more games you win sufficiently more in the late game to net overall improve the matchup.   And on the tournament side, equally this decision might well make more sense in a meta full of miracles where you could justify the replacing a sideboard slot directed against another deck to improve the matchup or repurpose one of your other anti-miracles cards.   The concept is good as a general principle of teaching people how to think about sideboards, but it shouldn't be the end all be all of sideboarding.   Ultimately, the point here is that if Disciple means you win more than why not?   As far as the situations in which it is better than Griselbrand there are plenty, most notably when the opponent leads with a karakas or has a counterbalance lock (Disciple can be hardcasted especially if you play with sol lands and turns your hand into spells in the face of counterbalance)."
MTGLegacy,3c863u,150crawfish,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:53:23 2015 UTC,"The problem I had with griselbrand is they had too many ways to deal with him; karakas  or stp, which I hate having to draw 7 just to protect him. Also reanimating him I only get 1 draw 7 leaving me very open to early aggressors such as meddling Mage or a miracled entreat. Yes I potentially can get a ""free"" draw 7 with stp but they can play around that better with countertop and their negate suite.  Having the ability to have multiple negates without affecting my hand size was what proved its worth to me. Every time I got her out with mana open I won out of the games I tested her.  And like I said earlier, if I had the t1-t2 combo I would get another target like griselbrand or inkwell leviathan. I only would go for her if those failed because then I can have mana up."
MTGLegacy,3c863u,MAC777,1 point,Sun Jul 5 22:03:35 2015 UTC,"Giving them time to sculpt a hand to allow them to stop you from reanimating is a problem. Inkwell is the greatest target against reanimator, however, I see no harm in testing this out myself once it gets released. Hell, I play snapcaster. Odd choices work well sometimes"
MTGLegacy,3c863u,Kaono,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:41:35 2015 UTC,"T1 she's a terrible reanimate target   I'd take that as kind of a sign if I were you.   It's generally best if the pieces of your fast combo deck are at their best in the early stages of the game (like Sire of Insanity, for example). Disciple takes a deck that's crazy weak to graveyard hate and makes it even weaker. Uniquely, you'll be doing so even after your reanimation spells resolve ...   Consider Dig Through Time; which could be crazy powerful in a deck like Reanimator since you could fuel a fast delve and use dig to recover from early hate (you only need 1 card in your gy after all). But they don't play it because as a local explained, it makes them even weaker to hate in g2 and g3. Rest in Peace kills DTT for them--and it does the same thing for disciple even after it's in play. If you get griselbrand into play then all the hate they boarded in becomes dead, while RiP turns disciple into a vanilla 3/4, and they get like five more turns to deal with her. Also the idea of show and telling her into play with gy hate out is kind of a non-starter.   Ultimately I see no reason why this would be any better than Tidespout Tyrant; the old standby for control matches. Esp if you can reanimate and play a petal on turn 1, Tyrant is broke as all hell. They can't cast spells to counter if they can't keep lands in play. The fact that your miracles opp had the time to cast a bunch of jaces and miracles is less a testament to disciple's quality, and more a testament to the fact that you let a beaten Miracles opp live on for way too long."
MTGLegacy,3c863u,MCSpacy,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:51:24 2015 UTC,"It seems like people forgot about Aetherling. When I was solely on Reanimator for about 8 months last year my SB'd Aetherling singlehandedly won me every game vs Miracles when I was able to get it onto the board.   Rather than Spell Pierce, Aetherling outright ""counters"" any removal for U (including Supreme Verdict). Sure this doesn't stop Jace, but you don't care about a Jace resolving when you've got a 2-3 turn clock.   Aetherling also continues to function through a Rest in Peace, and never runs out of ""gas"" as long as you have blue mana.  I honestly can't see a non-trivial reason (like colorless vs blue mana and some tacked on corner-case abilities) that would make DotR better.  That said, Sire of Insanity is often just better vs Miracles in executing Reanimators #1 plan of getting a unbeatable creature out t1/t2."

MTGLegacy,3c744c,MungallSMASH,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:50:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's why I'm still wavering a little on the green vs. white splash.  Doesn't seem to be too much available to green."
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,Zurangatang,14,Sun Jul 5 20:37:23 2015 UTC,Proxy tournaments are frequently ran as weekly tournaments for stores trying to create a legacy scene. Tournaments that allow proxies are a form of tournament not an allowance at a random tournament. Proxy tournaments are not allowed to be sanctioned.  I'm not really sure what you're trying to figure out.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,Watoo24,3,Sun Jul 5 20:53:25 2015 UTC,"I just thought it was cool, I am really interested in legacy but don't have the money to drop on a deck so this is an awesome way that I can get my foot in the door."
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,StoicSpartan,7,Mon Jul 6 04:50:36 2015 UTC,They can't be sanctioned. So you don't get credit through DCI or whatever. But it does make it easier to have a play group. We allow 15 proxies at my LGS. We get 8-10 people currently. Without proxies we would get 3.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,StoicSpartan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:48:17 2015 UTC,I played Magic for the first time like 10 days ago so I am not anticipating getting into ant PTQs or anything anytime soon lol.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,StoicSpartan,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:03:59 2015 UTC,"It not just PTQs. Any normal tourney at your LGS is sanctioned. Standard, Modern, and Legacy. Hence why there are legal sets and banned /restricted cards. Non-sanctioned (Kitchen table / using proxies..etc) is anywhere you want to play with whatever cards you / your friends want."
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,sithsniper17,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:50:28 2015 UTC,What's DCI?
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,LRats,3,Mon Jul 6 08:01:07 2015 UTC,"The number you get when you play at a LGS or any MTG event. Think of it as a membership number. You can give your name or your number when you enter a tourney. If you play somewhere consistently like your local gaming store you will not need to repeatedly give it. But if you go to a different store that you have never been to or a larger tourney say a GP, PPTQ, SCG event or a TCGplayer event you will need a number. If that is the first time you play somewhere they will just give you one just ask for a DCI number if you have never been giving one before. There is no cost to get one it just a tracking number. EDIT: DCI is the database for rules / judge certification / etc... http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=dci/welcome"
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,VioletBroregarde,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:51:10 2015 UTC,"The DCI, or Duelist Convocation International (nobody calls it that anymore) is the organization responsible for working with Wizards of the Coast in constructing Sanctioned/Organized Play events, from local Friday Night Magic all the way up to the Pro Tour and World Championships. They set tournament policy, tournament rules, and penalties for breaking the rules. The DCI is also responsible for the Judge Program, which focuses on making interested players into judges for events of any scope, whether it be a local draft tournament, a PPTQ, a Grand Prix, etc.  To participate in sanctioned Magic play (Friday Night Magic, prereleases, etc.) you must register with the DCI and get a card and number. Any local game store (LGS) will have forms you can fill out and receive your DCI card and number right there, free of charge. You can use it to create an online profile where you can track the events you participate in, unlock ""achievements"", and see how many Planeswalker Points you have. (PPs are used for player rankings and for determining 1st-3rd round byes at Grand Prix.)   TL;DR The DCI makes playing competitive Magic possible, organized, and fun. :)"
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,KangaRod,3,Wed Jul 8 04:51:24 2015 UTC,I really don't know how common they are. My guess would be if the store is just starting their Legacy scene they might allow proxies to try to churn up interest and make it affordable. It their Legacy scene is more established then they probably don't allow proxies. Note that a tournament that allows proxies can not be sanctioned.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,cripledcyclone,3,Sun Jul 5 22:59:31 2015 UTC,There's a store in Austin that lets you run a full deck of 75 proxies at their weeklies. Maybe just google around and see if there's a store by you that does too.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,MrMond4y,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:43:28 2015 UTC,This is the only store in my area.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,MrMond4y,3,Mon Jul 6 06:03:00 2015 UTC,At my LGS we allow 15 proxies and run the tournament every other week and it's still hard to get 8 people to show up.  I wish we had a bigger legacy scene here in Winnipeg. I love playing it.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,MrMond4y,2,Mon Jul 6 09:25:20 2015 UTC,If they allow 12 proxies try looking at LED Dredge instead of Manaless.  http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=87176
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,MrMond4y,1 point,Mon Jul 6 05:51:39 2015 UTC,Manaless is like $60 cheaper which is way nicer. Whats the advantage of LED besides some protections against graveyard hate?
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,Tehdougler,3,Mon Jul 6 06:12:13 2015 UTC,LED Dredge is way more explosive and generally more robust. IMO it's better than Manaless at the moment.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,ashent2,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:18:33 2015 UTC,Do you actually use the Mana? If it wasnt for the cost of LED I would be into it but I dont have the money to drop on it right now.  Also playing without mana is the coolest thing ever.
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,cromonolith,3,Mon Jul 6 06:28:08 2015 UTC,"Yes. There are tricks you can do like going land->LED,  cast Faithless Looting, then in response crack your LED for Red and discard your hand. This lets you dredge whatever was in your hand, then discard them and flashback Looting again. I've gotten a few turn 1 kills this way.  I agree that playing without mana is sweet though. It feels so weird."
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,Claw01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:31:37 2015 UTC,"So whats your kill cards with this deck, Golgari Grave Troll and Dread Return? I feel like I am missing what makes it more powerful cause with manaless your GGT has the a higher likelyhood of being a one hit kill. Plus flayer does it instantly."
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,bmemike,2,Mon Jul 6 06:35:34 2015 UTC,"I prefer to use Flame-Kin Zealot. Generally, if you get an explosive start (or even just a fast one), you're likely to get a few zombies out on the field pretty quick, and FKZ can turn that into a fast kill.   It all depends on how many Bridge From Belows you manage to bin, and LED helps with that a ton."
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,KangaRod,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:40:10 2015 UTC,Do you only play with one Dread Return? Cause that means you can only use it twice to get creatures on battlefield? So your only other options after you use it twice are Narcomoeba and Bridge to Below generated zombies. Am I missing something? Also if you have two Bridge to Belows in your graveyard does that mean double the zombies? Is it possible to have the sideboard to switch from Manaless to LED?
MTGLegacy,3c87xa,cromonolith,5,Mon Jul 6 06:47:08 2015 UTC,"This is my list atm. I use 2 Dread Returns, though they often only get flashbacked. The deck doesn't tend to get more than 1-2 lands on the field at a time (though it can happen and there are times where I do cast my dredgers).   After I Dread Return twice I am generally done with DR, though I often don't cast DR twice in a game (and a fair amount of times, not even once). I tend to rely on Narcomoeba and Ichorid providing me repeatable sac triggers for the Bridges.  Each Bridge triggers separately. So lets say that I have three Bridges in my graveyard and two Narcomoebas and an Ichorid on the field. If I sacrifice all three to flashback Dread Return, I'll get three zombies from each for a total of 9. Then the Flame-Kin Zealot that I DR'ed will enter the battlefield and give all my creatures +1/+1 and haste, allowing me to swing for 30. This can be done on turn 1 if you're lucky, though generally it happens around turns 2-4, depending on how controlling your opponent is.   Ichorid is valuable because it provides zombies each turn, along with swinging for 3 each time I bring it back. There are games that I win just by beating down with them. Narcomoeba is the same, though it generally acts as fodder for my Cabal Therapies."
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,TheScynic,3,Sat Jul 4 20:17:02 2015 UTC,He's done now and I lost to him 2-1 in the last game he played.  The new TES list seems to be a bit stronger than the 3 moxen one.
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,lordoftheshadows,3,Sat Jul 4 22:52:13 2015 UTC,The current list on his website lists 3 Chrome Mox. You're saying he was playing a newer list than that today? What were the changes?
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,intelli78,2,Sun Jul 5 04:27:30 2015 UTC,"He was streaming his normal list -2 Mox +2 Cabal Ritual, with his old SB (back to 1 Thoughtseize and 2 CoV)."
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,wintermute93,2,Sun Jul 5 14:03:15 2015 UTC,The newer list has +2 Cabal Ritual -2 Moxen.  He is going to update the website after GP Lille.  Kai got 17th I believe so a report from him will be great.
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,lordoftheshadows,1 point,Sun Jul 5 15:26:06 2015 UTC,"The list is about a year ""new"". this change was being talked about last summer too"
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,Apocolyps6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:24:49 2015 UTC,The list is a little different from the one from a year or so ago as it still has four copies of Infernal Tutor in the main and a main deck Empty the Warrens as well. Where the previous list lacked both of these.
MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,Bryant_Cook,1 point,Sun Jul 5 20:25:03 2015 UTC,I'm also interested in the changes.

MTGLegacy,3c4uhq,Zahninator,3,Sun Jul 5 00:21:47 2015 UTC,"We've already been discussing it on the Facebook page, you should join it.  Basically, it's ok in TES because we can have the tutor pre-sideboarded without having to play 3 IT main, but it's nothing crazy. Probably worth the slot."

So what I did was build delver and pick up the other stuff later and the you can make meta calls for each tournament."
MTGLegacy,3c589l,Abrandy,3,Sat Jul 4 23:01:45 2015 UTC,yup. I got the stuff to run shardless and it wasn't as good for me... Too much combo and the delver list was just so much more resilient.. just get 2 Dark Confidants and build delver for the time being... many lists don't run 4 anymore anyways..
MTGLegacy,3c589l,bugdelver,6,Mon Jul 6 21:36:58 2015 UTC,What's your meta like?  Shardless is very strong against fair decks but weak to combo.  Delver eats up combo but is weaker vs fair decks.     You can tweak them around though.
MTGLegacy,3c589l,randomnickname99,6,Sun Jul 5 01:57:30 2015 UTC,So it would be safer to pick up the shared cards then build towards either?
MTGLegacy,3c589l,Umezete,6,Sun Jul 5 00:11:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, pretty much everything pricy in bug delver is played in shardless except for Bob in the versions that still use him.  Shardless has a couple jaces and sometimes lili on bug."
MTGLegacy,3c589l,Comma20,2,Sun Jul 5 05:55:02 2015 UTC,I did this. Works out nicely.
MTGLegacy,3c589l,Mirage08,3,Mon Jul 6 05:09:05 2015 UTC,"With all the Delver and Miracles running around I feel like Shardless would be stronger. That being said, they are almost the same deck (10-15 cards different) so you don't really have to choose all that much."
MTGLegacy,3c589l,Eric91,2,Sat Jul 4 23:56:50 2015 UTC,"My meta is basically mono colored decks. D&T, burns and such."

MTGLegacy,3c589l,Abrandy,4,Sun Jul 5 03:33:56 2015 UTC,Not if that means a lot of Goblins and Merfolk.
MTGLegacy,3c589l,ChaseDagger,2,Mon Jul 6 11:02:36 2015 UTC,Here's my delver list. My meta is combo and D&T and burn. So it's designed for a similar meta like yours in the board. I'd probably add a massacre.   http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=87309

MTGLegacy,3c589l,Abrandy,2,Sun Jul 5 14:45:57 2015 UTC,"Very valid. It was a last minute change from true name. So, it probably should be angler. But I didn't end up playing d&t in the tournament I top 8ed so I was fortunate."
MTGLegacy,3c589l,Abrandy,2,Sun Jul 5 15:02:13 2015 UTC,"Gotcha, thx.  It's kind of a bummer since Tasigar is more fun."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,PM_ME_UR_GUNPLA,13,Sat Jul 4 12:52:44 2015 UTC,I'm really disappointed by just how many Grixis decks they've put on camera. There are tons and tons of different Legacy decks. Why are they only showing one?

MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Skelegro93,3,Sun Jul 5 22:35:48 2015 UTC,This is the spiciest fucking deck I've ever seen. Too bad the Grixis player drew the stone cold nuts game 1.

MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,heavyheaded3,28,Sun Jul 5 17:00:39 2015 UTC,Man this Dig Through Time really looks like a fair and balanced magic card  topkek
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,steve2112rush,9,Sat Jul 4 15:55:04 2015 UTC,"Before this event, I was not sure if DTT was too overpowered. I know better now.  That being said, is it bad enough to ban?"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Robot_Drew,6,Sat Jul 4 16:29:30 2015 UTC,"Depends. It is quite a bit more fair than TCruise. However, the blue based decks that were doing well before are doing just as well now. It isn't warping decks to play cheap cards to reload on. It is making different decks viable.   The only deck that has shyed away is Sneak and Show, in favor of Omni. When TCruise was around it was warping decks and every sideboard as well.   It is not stronger than brainstorm. It is not stronger than ponder. It is in that category of card selection....but the skill ceiling is SUPER low on it. I think it isn't a problem."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,150crawfish,15,Sat Jul 4 16:38:56 2015 UTC,"I think my main complaint for the card is the fact that it caused Dark Confidant to fall out of vogue very quickly in many decks. I am a fan of Bob's design, and I feel like a player doesn't sacrifice enough for that kind of advantage when delving.  Granted, that's all personal flavor, nothing objective. I do agree that it lowers the skill ceiling."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Robot_Drew,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree with that take on it, although the 4c loam deck that showed up day 1 was still playing Bob, so really he's just moved house."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,pi-i-e,1 point,Sun Jul 5 17:31:28 2015 UTC,Well of course the non-blue decks are not gonna play dig over bob :p  That deck is not particularly well positioned so the fact that it showed up is not because of dig or anything.  The 4c loam deck that showed up day 2 and top4ed was also playing it btw :p
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Apocolyps6,1 point,Sun Jul 5 19:32:27 2015 UTC,"interesting you say it's poorly positioned when 2 copies made the top 8, but I suppose variance can get involved. Not saying it's around because of dig, just saying it plays Bob still :P"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,pi-i-e,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:36:58 2015 UTC,I'm not saying it is poorly positioned. It only has 2 bad matchups amongst the DTB (Omni and D&T). But for example in the meta right before Treasure Cruise I think the deck had something like ~0 bad matchups among the DTB.   I just think the top8s now have more to do with the fact that the deck is gaining popularity.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Apocolyps6,4,Mon Jul 6 03:12:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly think its worse than cruise for the meta since the decks cruise enabled optimally and the decks dig enables optimally are different.  Cruise was a delver card good enough for every blue deck to play, dig is a control/omni card that is good enough for every blue deck to play."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Umezete,6,Sun Jul 5 05:58:42 2015 UTC,"Cruise warped decks into going low and reloading fast. Attrition became fodder for drawing three cards. It made legacy turn into a format of card advantage over card selection which happens to lower the skill of playing a deck significantly (in terms of legacy). Hell, RUG delver at one point was playing kird ape to accommodate the delving.  Dig just makes different archetypes more consistent - replacing cards in lists that were otherwise used to fill a different and less important role. The UU makes it so it isn't as potent as cruise so decks do not warp around it. It compliments rather than defines a deck."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,150crawfish,3,Sun Jul 5 07:40:06 2015 UTC,"Not sure if I agree with that last point, Dig has warped Omni quite a bit and its probably given miracles more teeth than it really needs to be a meta contender.  I mean if you use that argument then you can use the same for cruise.  It made UR tier 1 and it did cause a couple Rug lists to play kird ape (I really don't get why people point this out as such an absurdity.) but plenty of RUG delver decks top 8ed without cruise as well and the top 8s in the brief cruise meta had more different decks than the last few top 8s we've seen."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Umezete,4,Sun Jul 5 11:09:45 2015 UTC,LOL. Right there with you man. Have been pretty light on Legacy recently and thought it wasn't a problem. I was wrong.

For those of you calling for a ban on DTT, what is your data/evidence-based rationale? I mean, we all have cards we don't like-- I think delver is totally over powered and off-theme for blue-- but that's my opinion. What's the evidence DTT needs banning?

MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,shandrana,6,Sat Jul 4 14:59:27 2015 UTC,"did anyone notice in round 5 when the esper player set aside 4 for jitte/equip at an angle, then brought it back untapped amongst his other lands, and used it to play his clique that had been karakas'ed? He basically never tapped the lands for the jitte."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Apocolyps6,5,Sun Jul 5 02:15:12 2015 UTC,That guy was tapping his lands like 20 degrees and fiddling with them the whole match. I would have called him out on that shit pretty early.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Maxtortion,6,Sun Jul 5 19:49:10 2015 UTC,"TOP8: 2 Miracles, 2 Aggro Loam, 1 Grixis Delver, 1 Lands, 1 BURG Delver, 1 Infect."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,jackgibson12,3,Sun Jul 5 16:07:26 2015 UTC,"They're really both 4c delver. The deck they have labeled as ""grixis"" has 4 goyf and 2 abrupt decay. In fact, the black main deck is only for deathrite and decay."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,DXArcana,3,Sun Jul 5 17:00:51 2015 UTC,"Miracles vs 4color delver in the quarterfinals. Game 1 was incredible, miracles player top decks swords to kill lethal goyf, terminus the next turn to kill follow up goyf, and then top decks ponder into dig into top to complete the lock."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,lolsusl,3,Sun Jul 5 15:29:48 2015 UTC,Am I the only one disappointed by the number of players? 1.6k players seem low for a Legacy GP. No?
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Fallen_Akroma,3,Sat Jul 4 16:36:03 2015 UTC,"For a European GP that's a good number. If i recall correct there were less at GP Copenhagen and GP Paris, which were the last constructed GPs."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,DXArcana,2,Sun Jul 5 06:19:39 2015 UTC,Holiday weekend.  It's a 3 day weekend in the States so most people are out getting drunk and blowing shit up.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Forty__Three,5,Sat Jul 4 17:02:38 2015 UTC,But how is that relevant while the GP is in France? I doubt 2.5k players would fly from the US to play that tournament and make it 4k players :(
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,DXArcana,6,Sat Jul 4 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"it's because you said Audience, which means people watching, whereas you meant attendance, which is people playing."

MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,TweetsInCommentsBot,19,Sat Jul 4 17:15:55 2015 UTC,"I think the best part of that match was where he tried to miracle something at the end of his turn. Don't forget about the classic 6-0 (or 5-1?) bug delver player who pithing needled a LED, then tried to stifle it later.  Pretty much just this"

MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,GamerKingFaiz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:19:28 2015 UTC,I was watching that on Joe Lossett's stream (he was hosting so we could chat).  He lost his shit.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,oepeoa,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:39:50 2015 UTC,"As someone new to legacy, can you explain what's wrong here? Pithing Needle seems like it should stop LED and if it doesn't then why does Stifle not?  Or is it the fact that the player already had the LED Needled'd so he didn't need to Stifle?"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,GamerKingFaiz,6,Sun Jul 5 04:20:44 2015 UTC,"led's ability is a mana ability, which needle explicitly doesn't work on  stifle counters activated and triggered abilities...but not mana abilities"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,greenpm33,1 point,Sun Jul 5 04:45:05 2015 UTC,"Oooh, I was thinking that it's an activated ability because it has the colon.   And I was understanding that mana abilities only meant stuff like what's on mana dorks (i.e. tap: add G)."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,cach-e,4,Sun Jul 5 04:59:22 2015 UTC,"It is an activated ability, its just also a mana ability.  What confuses most people is the timing restriction, which has nothing to do with determining if an ability is a mana ability."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,randomnickname99,5,Sun Jul 5 05:46:31 2015 UTC,"Does the ability give you mana? Does it require a target? If the answers are ""Yes, it gives me mana"" and ""No, it requires no target"" then congratulations - it's a mana ability! :)   It's still an activated ability, it just can't be stopped by things like Pithing Needle that explicitly excludes mana abilities and it doesn't use the stack when it's activated."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,TaonasSagara,3,Sun Jul 5 09:56:44 2015 UTC,Note that it can be stopped by null rod or phyrexian revoker though.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Skelegro93,2,Sun Jul 5 12:59:57 2015 UTC,"Third qualifier is is it a loyalty ability?  If it is, it is not a mana ability."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,TheWaz18,-8,Sun Jul 5 18:30:35 2015 UTC,Fucking moron. I play storm and if that happened I would have an extremely hard time trying not to laugh
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Ozy-dead,3,Sun Jul 5 03:14:57 2015 UTC,we also got the 'force of will your flusterstorm'
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Morzas,3,Sat Jul 4 18:38:24 2015 UTC,"The TA player who was 6-0 last night puts needle on LED against storm, then tried to stifle a LED actvation. I facepalmed so hard, it wasn't even funny."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,goblinpiledriver,3,Sun Jul 5 12:43:43 2015 UTC,No Twitch chat? Where am I supposed to PJSalt?
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,GamerKingFaiz,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:49:50 2015 UTC,Chat is there on the mobile client
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,twndomn,1 point,Sat Jul 4 23:03:13 2015 UTC,You can still pop out the chat and view it. This website makes it handy to view both stream and the private chat. multitwitch.tv/magic
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,simdude,2,Sun Jul 5 04:22:25 2015 UTC,"Europeans must know what they are doing, how else do we explain the fact that Julian Knab and Marc König only had 9 points? As matter of fact, I am not sure how many of the euroswag players have made day 2. If I'm not mistaken, you need 21 pts (7-2 or better), and Schönegger only had 15. Kai Sawatari, the storm player who Top 8 at Kyoto had 21."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,mr_tolkien,9,Sat Jul 4 23:03:54 2015 UTC,Variance. Even the best players can get hit by the variance of theirs or their opponents deck in a high power format like legacy.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,cromonolith,1 point,Sun Jul 5 00:35:42 2015 UTC,"Legacy is pretty much the lowest variance format though, with all the cantrips that are played. You can see that by pretty much having half the day 2 pool carry from one year to the next."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Grievers,7,Mon Jul 6 13:38:26 2015 UTC,Schonegger probably should have played more Vensers and less Ponders. Hehe.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,cromonolith,1 point,Sun Jul 5 03:47:41 2015 UTC,"I'm unable to watch at the moment, can anyone list what decks have had feature matches so far?  That way I know if I need to go back and watch the earlier rounds later!  Thanks!"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,mpaw975,3,Sat Jul 4 13:37:34 2015 UTC,So far I've seen Omni VS Sneak & Show (Rd 4) and Aggro Loam VS Esperblade (Rd 5).
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,cromonolith,3,Sat Jul 4 13:48:01 2015 UTC,Aggro Loam!? Like with Seismic Assaults and Countryside Crushers?
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Grievers,3,Sat Jul 4 15:25:14 2015 UTC,"No, it was 4 colour loam. Very similar, or even exactly, this list."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Robot_Drew,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:33:46 2015 UTC,That makes a lot more sense. It would have been sweet if there was just old-school aggro loam doing well though.

MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,cripledcyclone,2,Sat Jul 4 14:08:30 2015 UTC,Rd 6 was a Grixis Delver Mirror and fell back into Omni-Tell and Grixis Delver.  The Rd4 and Rd6 Omni player is Raphael Levy. the Rd5 Loam player is Niklas Kronberger.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Pheyniex,2,Sat Jul 4 14:52:55 2015 UTC,"Thank you guys!  Driving makes watching streams hard, haha"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Retardedfarmer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:02:44 2015 UTC,Currently another Grixis Delver vs Miracles is going on.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Robot_Drew,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:42:43 2015 UTC,wasn't there a misplay at the end of the Loam vs Esper where the Esper could have tied the game by -2/-2 the knight and attack for 1?
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Pheyniex,3,Sat Jul 4 15:01:28 2015 UTC,Can't really remember but didn't the Loam player have Maze of Ith in play?
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,iu34,2,Sat Jul 4 15:05:34 2015 UTC,"Your thinking of using the Jitte counters on the Knight of the Reliquary?  The Maze of Ith and karakas were already in play to handle Baleful and Vendillion respectively, so denying the ability really would solve nothing. The counters were kept for the potential later on.  The main line of play for the Esper player was using the Clique to take the second Liliana in response to the activation of the first; that could led to a more favorable board state."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Grievers,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:11:19 2015 UTC,"forgot about maze, but at least could force a mistake for the opponent. =D"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,alpinefroggy,1 point,Sat Jul 4 17:36:00 2015 UTC,"From what I saw in round 6, there was delver vs miracles, grixis delver mirror, and grixis delver vs omni-tell as well"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Apocolyps6,2,Sat Jul 4 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"So much Grixis, wow."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,greenpm33,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:39:58 2015 UTC,"A lot of discussion of people wanting top banned on the Twitter.   I am relatively new to legacy,  so I want to ask if this kind of discussion on this card is common like so many cards are in modern.  I am particularly interested because I finally can invest in legacy and miracles is the deck I want to build as it looks utterly sweet.  I have jeskai stoneblade as a backup choice but I really want to build miracles care free"
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Skelegro93,6,Sun Jul 5 18:06:37 2015 UTC,Snarky Answer: Sometimes Modern players will watch Legacy and complain about what they see. Legacy players tend to solve problems with Force of Will or sideboard cards rather than ban lists.  Real Answer: I wouldn't say you are 100% safe as top or terminus miiight be banned. That being said it is not that likely. If WotC decides to stop pretending the format doesn't exist (unlikely) and decide to have more legacy events (more unlikely) then they will probably ban top for time reasons like they did in modern.
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Sun Jul 5 20:01:46 2015 UTC,"As Patrick Sullivan state its nothing new that SDT is an annoying card. It got banned for time reasons in modern years ago, so its not like its a new idea.  And I highly doubt it would be hit for power level in legacy."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Sun Jul 5 18:58:53 2015 UTC,They have banned the counter - top combo yet and they even designed abrupt decay to specifically break it. If they were to going to ban the combo they would have already and if they do they would ban counterbalance (well it would be the smarter choice)
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,Morzas,2,Sun Jul 5 22:31:47 2015 UTC,"The only complaint is that it ""eats up time."" Instead if banning the card, give warnings to the players taking more than 15 seconds to resolve the ability."
MTGLegacy,3c3l3p,ReallyForeverAlone,1 point,Sun Jul 5 18:28:42 2015 UTC,GG now everyone will be playing bad Miracles (see: Daze). Makes my mirror matches much easier.
MTGLegacy,3c4f2b,mwb12,4,Sat Jul 4 17:56:47 2015 UTC,"Counters require you to have the counterspell in hand and ready to go when your opponent casts their spell.  They also use more of your opponents' resources (whatever casting the spell cost them).  Discard requires your opponent to have the relevant cards in hand when you cast your spell, uses up only your resources (in terms of mana and life), and can't play around a topdeck.  Discard is generally better if you can't afford to hold onto whatever you need to cast countermagic on the turn where you think you might need it, since you can strip their hand on one turn, and go off on the next.  Specifically to take care of grave hate, countermagic is probably a little better if you don't consider the deckbuilding costs, since you won't get blown out by a topdecked Rest in Peace that way.  So if you think your deck remains powerful and consistent enough if you include the package you need to run countermagic, it's likely going to protect you better."
MTGLegacy,3c4f2b,alcaizin,2,Sat Jul 4 19:17:20 2015 UTC,"In a format with Brainstorm, Discard is a bit worse than it otherwise would be."
MTGLegacy,3c4f2b,Sir_Laser,3,Sat Jul 4 19:27:32 2015 UTC,"You're very right, I forgot about that.  Especially discard against grave hate - it doesn't help quite as much if you're trying to therapy away their force."
MTGLegacy,3c00r1,Carnilawl,7,Fri Jul 3 15:14:55 2015 UTC,What is going on with the other subreddits? I'm so confused.

MTGLegacy,3c00r1,ChaosHazard,9,Fri Jul 3 17:08:25 2015 UTC,"Basically, a major AMAadmin from r/iama was fired without anyone getting notice about it and it screwed up a ton of upcoming AMAs, causing r/iama to close down. Other subreddits closed down (like r/books) for the same reason, and then even more subreddits closed as a sign of solidarity."
MTGLegacy,3c00r1,DaTaco,6,Fri Jul 3 17:19:00 2015 UTC,"That's a pretty good description, just a little clarification, the admin that was fired is the person who is the ""contact"" for AMA moderators, for outside organizations and has made herself the contact for working internally with getting their message heard to other admins. She was a very visible person to the people doing the ""work"" to setup AMAs and she actually verified everyone's information, now the other admins are not wanting the moderators to verify for example that no one has paid money to do an AMA."

MTGLegacy,3c00r1,MAC777,7,Fri Jul 3 21:29:31 2015 UTC,"It's a random thing that started in r/Iama and is now being used as the platform for large-scale power-tripping, just done collectively this time instead of the usual one power trip at a time. It's like the Kony 2012 of mod powertrips.  Reddit mods feel under appreciated (surprise) and like they're owed something for their contribution to the site (despite the fact that they essentially agreed to work pro bono for a Fortune 500 company which is hilari-dumb). Failing to realize how easily replaceable most of them are in terms of maintaining bottom-line profitability, it seems like they're dead-set on pushing the issue until they're further disempowered and (to at least some extent) replaced by equally power-hungry and slightly more desperate losers.   They're not all bad to be sure, and the mods here are a fantastic break from the usual. But it's important to remember what a mod's role should be (ideally little more than a human spam filter) and that some mods can be dogshit human beings (violentacrez)."
MTGLegacy,3c00r1,djlawrence3557,4,Fri Jul 3 17:33:48 2015 UTC,Not to mention the main Magic sub is essentially using this arm-in-arm solidarity march to throw a big mute button on the whole Zach Jesse internet explosion.

There is a good amount of Miracles, but the number of different deck types I've faced in a short period has to be close to 30.  All sorts of decks like Oops All Spells, Food Chain, Enchantress, Cheerios, Belcher, Burn, TinFins, Tezz, Dredge, NicFit, Painter, Merfolk, Infect, Alluren, 12 Post, Maverick, Elves, MUD, etc show up in addition to all the usual suspects (which is a large # as well).  The legacy daily events have been very enjoyable imo."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Negator77,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:04:35 2015 UTC,"Nice. And, that's really good to hear. I guess my big concern was that Legacy is kind of niche and there wouldn't be enough variety / enough opportunity to test out some ideas that I have if I tinker around with the LED Dredge deck I've been playing."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Sir_Laser,5,Fri Jul 3 23:29:13 2015 UTC,Legacy 2-persons fire every few minutes at worst.

MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Negator77,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:34:09 2015 UTC,"For Legacy, yeah.  For between 2-3 hundred, you can build Burn, Dredge, and some other decks.  The deck I've been running and doing well with (Hex Depths) set me back around 300, but I already had some tickets from playing limited previously."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Biwin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:55:34 2015 UTC,I spent last night playing and I don't think I'll be getting into it.  The game was crazy slow because people don't click through their turn on the bajillion fast-effect phases.  MTG is a lot different than I remember it being in the 90s.  Also not being able to buy legacy packs is kinda silly imo.
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,twndomn,6,Tue Jul 21 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"The future of Legacy is Definitely digital, not Paper. Unless you live in mega city like NYC, there're just aren't enough Legacy paper players in your local area.   May I ask why would you dislike emulation? You can have dual boot or VMware Fusion easily. Before you buy a machine, perhaps use the trial period to evaluate your options."

MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,rifter5000,-5,Sat Jul 4 07:55:15 2015 UTC,It's quite likely.
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Ksd13,2,Sat Jul 4 10:00:30 2015 UTC,"How so?  Wizards has deflected the question any time it comes up, and the legal battle they'd have to face to get rid of the reserved list doesn't really seem worth it when they make almost no revenue from the Legacy format."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,rifter5000,2,Sat Jul 4 10:44:10 2015 UTC,"I've always been curious about that logic. You're right. They don't make money directly from Legacy, but I spent a shit ton of money with ChannelFireball and StarCityGames assembling LED Dredge, not to mention dice, deck boxes, sleeves, ect., ect. So although Wizards doesn't directly benefit, I am supporting the MTG ecosystem as a whole as a Legacy player, and by keeping their partners profitable, I'm supporting their (SGC for example)'s activities, which in turn keeps MTG healthy, which in turn keeps people playing and buying products that DO directly benefit Wizards."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Fallen_Akroma,0,Sat Jul 4 15:49:07 2015 UTC,"There is no legal problem with getting rid of the reserved list, and anyone claiming that there is either ignorant of the law or has a vested interest."

It has all of the problems that people like to complain about (although satisfied users rarely complain, so take the feedback with the game of salt), but it's definitely a reasonable way to practice and test."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,Magnum256,3,Sat Jul 4 04:23:32 2015 UTC,"No, stay away. It's just too addicting. There's way too many high-quality games, skilled players and tournaments. Not to mention how much more convenient is to brew and play different archetypes, than with paper.  Furthermore, it doesn't feel pimp. I mean, sometimes you can build the same deck for a 1/4 of its paper price, WITHOUT foils / alpha|beta / foreign, etc.  But the worst effect of it is that you get to play so much that your skill actually improves, then the next time you play on a paper tournament, you will feel confident and perhaps even feel like you can actually win the tournament."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,marumari,2,Mon Jul 6 17:24:30 2015 UTC,"I haven't played much Legacy since the 'new' client launched, what about 1-1.5 years ago now? But prior to that I played a ton of legacy online. For me it was worth it since my local legacy scene is almost non-existent, plus the price of entry is a lot lower online. I managed to play in several daily events per week and I was actually surprised at how competitive the legacy practice room games were. If you're looking to just get a lot of play volume I always thought the online platform was great, and with a fairly diverse meta.   Like I said tho, most of my opinions were from the state of MTGO over a year ago. I can't speak for how it it is today. Hopefully it's as strong as ever."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,slowhand88,2,Sat Jul 4 08:27:21 2015 UTC,I've been running MTGO in Parallels for years now without issues related to emulation.  I'd recommend that first.
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,marcospolos,3,Sat Jul 4 21:05:00 2015 UTC,"The town I'm in (San Antonio, TX) has had it's Legacy scene wither and die since January (the last time weekly Legacy would fire) so I've had to move to MODO only play for Legacy.  It's been an absolute blast.  Just having an outlet to play my favorite format again has been amazing, and the competition is a lot stiffer than you will get from most local legacy scenes.  I sold out about 3 grand worth of paper cards to buy into MODO Eternal (Vintage and Legacy, bought Power, Blue Duals, Forces and a bunch of staples: I have Miracles, various Delver and Stoneblade flavors and Vintage Grixis Control/UWR Mentor) and haven't regretted it for a second.  If you have to cash to buy in do it without hesitation, if you don't save up the cash then do it without hesitation."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,slowhand88,2,Sat Jul 4 04:44:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure if you know, but legacy is thriving in Austin - there actually a power series tournament happening on Sunday. We regularly get 30+ competitive players on Thursday at Pat's. Worth checking out if you can find an excuse to make the drive."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,addelorenzi,3,Sat Jul 4 06:48:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm gonna head up there for Sunday's tournament.  I'd like to play weekly events but I just can't really make an excuse to drive up to Austin on work nights; I get up at like 6:30 so getting home after midnight is a bitch."
MTGLegacy,3c1m8j,tumescentpie,2,Sat Jul 4 07:14:24 2015 UTC,"It gives you an opportunity to play against many great players and meet new people (sorta). For example I played against Lejay (Jean Mary-Accart) yesterday, Gerry Thompson today; and I am sure at least 1 familiar face from the  dailies will be in the top 8 of GP Lille. I have really enjoyed playing online, even if I had to sell about half of my paper collection to do it."
MTGLegacy,3c1ox7,Plato92,10,Fri Jul 3 23:08:31 2015 UTC,"Goldfish until you can look at a hand/board and no longer have to think much about the question ""can I kill a goldfish right now"". This gets much easier when you start thinking of your cards as +/-X mana. Dark Ritual is +2, Cabal Ritual is +1 or +3, and so on. Once you're free from spending mental effort worrying about if you can generate enough mana/storm for a kill, you can start worrying about how to play around Force, or Stifle, or Flusterstorm, or whatever else a real opponent might have.   You can cast stuff in your hand with LED mana if you also have Brainstorm and another cantrip.   Burn extra Infernal Tutors to double up on acceleration or discard as needed before your combo turn.  Don't get too trigger-happy with Ad Nauseam, it's more of a backup plan in this deck, and if you do go for AN, obviously be wary of the fact that there are cards in your deck that cost 4, and your opponent may have burn spells.   You can Chain of Vapor your own mana artifacts to build storm.   When going off with Past in Flames, extra Infernal Tutors in the graveyard can be turned into Lotus Petals by casting them and getting Cabal Ritual or LED."
MTGLegacy,3c1ox7,wintermute93,6,Fri Jul 3 23:38:43 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that you don't necessarily need a tutor to go off, if you already have a PiF - it can often be used to flash back enough cantrips to find a wincondition.  Natural drawing Ad Naus + LEDs for acceleration sucks, but you can often get around it by Brainstorming the AN back to the top of your library, then casting a cantrip, breaking LED in response.  Don't feel the need to go off quickly. Going for Ad Naus one turn when you could've set up a reliable PiF the next turn will often kill you.  Always keep at least the next two turns in mind when deciding how to cast your spells. Keep a 7 card hand with a cantrip that has no chance of going off before turn 3? Just hold the cantrip and cast it turn 2, after you have more info on what your opponent is playing/what you drew for the turn - you'll have more knowledge of whether or not those cards you see are good, whether you need to fetch a basic/dual, etc.  Similarly, don't just jam your discard spells because you can - they give valuable knowledge as well as disruption, and that knowledge gets worse as more turns go by. Goes for Probe as well.  Abuse the fact that many of your spells are instants. Cast Ad Naus off some rituals on the end of your opponent's turn. Cast a tutor, then a Cabal rit, then break an LED to enable both threshold and hellbent. Your opponent has a Leyline of Anticipation and a Trinisphere? Chain of Vapor the Sphere, then jam all of your rituals when he replays it (a little ridiculous, but actually happened to me last week)."
MTGLegacy,3c1ox7,TheScynic,3,Sat Jul 4 03:29:06 2015 UTC,Learn how to cast the following: Brainstorm and Cabal Therapy  Brainstorm acts a little different in this deck because you need to dig for action as soon as possible.  This means that you risk less good brainstorms in order to be faster.  You don't always have to have a shuffle effect before you cast it because sometimes you just need one more card.  To learn how to cast therapy watch other people play.  Cabal Therapy plays two different roles in the deck.  Sometimes it just gets rid of a force of will but sometimes you have to decide what card is the scariest.
MTGLegacy,3c1ox7,lordoftheshadows,2,Sat Jul 4 05:59:52 2015 UTC,"Most of the tricks are pretty self-evident, the ones that I forgot the most are ""cabal therapy myself in order to become hellbent"" and ""holding priority with a cantrip on the stack and cracking LED in response when AN/a Tutor you can't cast yet/a spell with storm is on top"".   Other suggestions: Do play Sensei's top in the main deck, do consider buying a Grim tutor, or try out Dark Petition (from Origins) if a grim is out of your range. I'm going to try it.   anyway, i have general advice which is that the deck is hard. Folks will talk about how it's easy as combo goes, and they're right, it's not nearly as hard as TES or Doomsday or whatever, but it is still hard. You will make lots of mistakes, and you will lose because of them; sometimes you will cantrip and dig and just not find the thing you need; sometimes you will make all your decisions exactly right and you will still lose. Do not let yourself become discouraged by this, losing and making mistakes are vital steps to getting better at the deck. Take it in stride and try to find a lesson to learn every time you play a match."
MTGLegacy,3c2dxz,J3llo,3,Sat Jul 4 03:07:09 2015 UTC,"How do you plan on preserving the cards that make nic fit work while running the creature and blue count to run collected company and force of will? It sounds like you want to be an even jankier version of the bug pod deck which was already pretty questionable.  Evolutionary leap seems a lot more useful to the archetype so I'm surprised you haven't even mentioned it. It's really great with veteran explorer and has some other cool interatctions like saccing evoked shriekmaws, drawing creatures in response to terminus etc. It would require a reduction/elimination of deed but there are ways to work around that."
MTGLegacy,3c2dxz,InitialG,2,Sat Jul 4 07:43:02 2015 UTC,"You're not wrong in saying that it ""wants to be a jankier version of pod"". While rolling through some test lists I settled on what basically ended up being some form of just Abzan beats with Lili at 3, and a larger focus on a Trinket Mage package to fetch thinks like Needle and Explosives. Force of Will is never a main board card in the deck, that was my own miswording.   Didn't...even really read Evolutionary Leap it seems. Card seems bonkers. Might not cut Deed for it but might slam it into the Pod shell over a fourth brainstorm (which BTW is totally nuts in the coco varient).

MTGLegacy,3bzxfd,efil4zaknupome,4,Fri Jul 3 14:46:53 2015 UTC,"Thoughts on this list that Gerry T featured on his Daily Digest? I've spent considerable time messing around with Jeskai Mentor builds (http://www.mtggoldfish.com/deck/285722), but decided to temporarily put it on the shelf, and have been playing a lot of Grixis Control, lately, instead. This Esper list almost sort of fuses the two lists together, taking many of the elements from the Grixis shell (Probe, Therapy, Token Maker; millions of cantrips + 4 Digs), and replacing red with white for Mentor and Plow over Pyromancer and Bolt. When I saw it, it was basically love at first sight.    I took it for a spin, myself, last night, and went 4-0, with the following tweaks: MD: +1 Ponder, +1 Thought Scour, +1 Unearth, +1 Misdirection, -2 Peak, -1 Snapcaster Mage, -1 Counterspell SB: +1 Nihil Spellbomb, +1 Null Rod, +1 Darkblast, -1 Pithing Needle, -1 Zealous Persecution, -1 Perish"
MTGLegacy,3bzxfd,addelorenzi,3,Fri Jul 3 14:55:42 2015 UTC,"I think I was your BURG opponent yesterday. Mentor is becoming more and more prevalent online, and whatever the version (Jeskai, Esper, Deathblade) it seems like it has relatively few weaknesses compared to other legacy decks. How have your matchups felt?"
MTGLegacy,3bzxfd,addelorenzi,2,Fri Jul 3 20:56:12 2015 UTC,"Ohhh, man.. I remember that match. My roommate and I were kind of laughing to each other that your head didn't explode from tilt. T1 probe you, see deathrite, deathrite, delver, delver, waste, waste, sea.. Therapy your delvers. T2 plow your deathrite and therapy the the other one away. That was a brutal start. (if that was you).    I've only played this particular variant twice so far. On Wed, I lost to dredge due to clock because I spent waaaay too long on talking through some of the different lines in game one. Forget what else we played. On Thursday, we went 2-0 vs Infect, 2-0 vs BURG Delver, 2-1 vs Esper Deathblade (with Mentor), 2-0 vs Food Chain."
MTGLegacy,3bzxfd,twndomn,3,Sat Jul 4 19:13:44 2015 UTC,"Oh trust me, there was definitely tilting involved."
MTGLegacy,3bzq6z,rumballtron,3,Fri Jul 3 13:40:59 2015 UTC,"Discard is kinda meh against other delve threats right now but anyway some of my take on the subject:  -Yes stifle is significantly worse without wastelands, its still an okay card but probably not good enough alone.    You are going to want some delve cards like tasigur and angler.   Something like  4 delver  2 Gurmang angler  4 Death's shadow  3 Dig through time  4 FOW  4 Daze  2 spell pierce  4 ponder  4 brainstorm  4 Gixatian Probe  4 Dismember  2 Disfigure  3 ???  10 fetch  4 watery grave  2 island  1 swamp"
MTGLegacy,3bzq6z,Umezete,2,Fri Jul 3 14:31:31 2015 UTC,"similar manabase but withless fetches and more islands so i can daze safely if i need to, along with a very similar setup to that in my disruption but i am running 4x thoughtseize and 1 hymn.    i guess i could go easier on the manabase by running counterspell instead of hymn and more blue ermission than discard, but i do think i want it for some matchups.    you actually nailed my maybe-board, a i have dig through time, tas, and tombstalker in the wings (don't own any anglers yet for some reason). thanks so much for the input. also: what do you think of spellsnare as a 1 of for a 1cmc hard counter? i feel like it is highly narrow, but also might be a good alternative to one of my spell pierces for critters like snaps and goyfs and bobs and stuff, although tbh im not too worried about goyf, if he hits me once he's outclassed by DS for the most part after that."
MTGLegacy,3bzq6z,Umezete,3,Fri Jul 3 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"Honestly there is very little basic LD in legacy so as long as all 8 of your fetches grab islands you can get away with only a couple.  I don't think thoughtseize is bad per say but hymn's double black will be annoying.  Counterspell is okay, 2 mana is alot to hold up though.  Its not bad but you might want to be more streamlined.  Still, you can get away with 1-2.  Tasigur is very good and you can probably run him, his biggest flaw over angler is karakas being popular but if you don't see that land often then he'll be worth including.  I personally quite like stalker but double b is hard.  Spellsnare is a solid counterspell, there are enough 2 drops it still hits.  The best cards it counters in the current meta are goyf, stoneforge, counterbalance, chalice at 1, and such.  Its lost a bit of power with the rise of delve but its still a very good card in the format.  You're right about goyf, also for the most part goyf will not be bigger than 4/5 in most matchups so dismember kills it just fine."
MTGLegacy,3bzq6z,DelverOfSeacrest,3,Fri Jul 3 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"I run UB Death Shadow and it's my favorite deck. I don't run stifle but I do run Wastelands and I definitely wouldn't run stifle without wastelands. There are many cool cards this deck can take advantage of. As far as creature removal, Snuff Out is great as well as Diabolic Edict and Dismember. You run counter spells in the form of Daze and Force of Will. Gitaxian Probe is an excellent card for this deck giving you knowledge about your opponent an getting you closer to Deaths Shadow. Having said that to play this deck you don't just want to lose your life really fast because most decks will do that for you, especially in Legacy. You just want to play the tempo game and if some decks don't make you lose life like Infect, then you help them out. Lastly, don't play Gurmag Angler. Tombstalker is strictly better in this deck since BB is so easy to make with two colors and he flies over True-Name Nemesis and other cards which give this deck problems."
MTGLegacy,3bzq6z,bunkoRtist,1 point,Fri Jul 3 18:58:24 2015 UTC,"yeah i saw tombstalker in another list and liked it. since my manabase is more budget i am going low on the dismembers and gonna try some other black removal options. have you tried tragic slip? i feel like without a cabal therapy package it doesn't work but it would be B-instant removal for utility critters. was jsut a thought.    maybe inquisition instead of thoughtseize? i feel like i still hit so many good things but i miss DTT and other delve threats and i also can't hit gris or sneak attac , FOW or stuff like that.    in modern i used rite of consumption on a big DS to kill. i think a fling effect is too cute but if my manabase puts me too low too fast on a consistent basis i would look at adding a surprise tech card that could grab a win suddenly and without warning."
MTGLegacy,3bzq6z,cincyfire35,2,Fri Jul 3 19:05:12 2015 UTC,"I agree with Umezete on the Delve cards. I don't think it's good enough, but you could add Street Wraith to fill the yard and burn life at instant speed. If you want casual jank, you can add a miser's Nephalia Drownyard, or instead of delve you can go threshold with Putrid Imp. I'm just throwing these out there."
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,Gandalf4077,14,Thu Jul 2 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"Okay, I used to play Enchantress like way back in the motherfuckin day, so I figured I could try to help...that was until I Googled current Legacy Enchantress decks...So people just put Emerakul in everything now? No one uses the Auratog + Rancor engine anymore? Or Ancestral Mask? No Enlightened Tutor toolbox package? No Sterling Grove? No Replenish? Call me Danny Glover cause I'm getting too old for this shit.

If you, for whatever reason couldn't grab a Rancor you would just sac all your other Enchants to Tog, and Replenish them back, only to sac them again all the while praying to God they weren't hanging on to a [[Terror]] the entire time. So without Auratog, I could see Replenish being a narrow sideboard card at best, but thats what inspired me to build the deck in the first place, all the interactions and durdleing. Even Pre Auratog Oldschool Enchantress with [[Concordant Crossroads]] and a giant [[Rabid Wombat]] was my jam back when they were still airing new episodes of Recess on TV.   This just feels like another way to cheat an Emerikul into play, just another Sneak and Show clone, fuck I hate that he exists. I've won with him before, the victory just seems so hollow, half the time they concede the second he comes into play and you don't even get to swing with him. He became the go to fatty to cheat into play and he put my homies like [[Sutured Ghoul]], [[Auratog]], and [[Akroma, Angel of Wrath]] out of a job on the process. Remeber when we used to turn all our shit left and dump a fat [[Cognivore]] into play? Did you ever use [[Worldly Tutor]] to cheat a [[Polar Kraken]] into play with [[Call of the Wild]]?

Emrakul is almost always the best win condition the deck has and despite playing many many variations and builds now I have never cut him from the main and will basically never side him out. Every line of text is super relevant. I've had to discard him to hand size limit to shuffle my graveyard back in just so I don't get decked before winning. He stops some random combo decks like Painter+Grindstone. It's pretty common that you can take infinite turns with your own Karakas. And being uncounterable just slams the door on so many matchups.

MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,ZeusMcFly,4,Fri Jul 3 14:05:43 2015 UTC,I dont play it but my friend does.  Your enchantress wffects are the most important part of your deck. You need to be able to draw multiple cards a turn. Depending on your build you need to prioritize different combo pieces. Sometimes you need to just get rid of elephant grass or Solitary.   In terms of legacy in general the format is wide and diverse. Sometimes you will play against known decks and sometimes you will be matched up against rogue decks. No one really plays mass enchantment removal so you shouldnt have too much of an issue unless its a rogue deck.  Whats your sideboard like/ decklist? Having that will be easier to help

MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,kiwithief,3,Fri Jul 3 14:38:27 2015 UTC,"Enchantress can be best described as draw 7, hopefully there're multiple cards with the word enchantress on them and go from there. If Enchantress Presence meets Abrupt Decay, you will need another one asap. If Argothian died due to Golgari Charm/Pyroclasm, or returned by Terminus, you need to find another one asap. Once you have multiple copies in play, you start playing solitaire, might just cause opponent to concede due to boredom as a side effect.  As to Legacy in general, all the combos are ridiculously fast and consistent comparing to Enchantress. Even if the combo is not as fast as griselbrand storm, a typical reanimator is still faster than enchantress.   If you're trying to get your hands on Legacy for the first time, I question the decision to start with Enchantress, much rather have a newcomer to start with a delver deck or a Burn deck."
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,simdude,2,Fri Jul 3 00:34:08 2015 UTC,"I wanted to play Enchantress because I don't mind starting off playing wonky lower tiered decks when entering a format.  I started playing modern with 8-rack and now have built up to a full Grixis Delver list.  I plan to slowly aquire more legacy staples so that I can build into different decks in the future.

I've been struggling with deciding what win condition I want to push for, it seems as though most people are pushing for the helm+RIP, along with Emrakul over others such as sigil of the empty throne.  Also, there seems to be contention on the use and amounts of sterling grove.  What are your thoughts on these?"
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,Cr0c0d1le,2,Fri Jul 3 00:31:12 2015 UTC,"I'll repeat at least a bit of what I wrote in a thread not too long ago when someone is interested in Enchantress.   So I'm a very heavily invested Enchantress player and my general philosophy on the deck in this meta-game is that the ""standard"" GW build has great hate-cards which can help us in the bad matchups, but that right now decks are running so many cantrips, and especially Dig Through Time that our opponents can 1 for 1 us all day long countering or killing our hate cards and never break a sweat as they kill us. Combo decks in particular are bad matchups for Enchantress and right now they are arguably probably some of the best meta-game decks (Omnitell and Storm). Even worse decks which prey on those combo decks can be rough matchups like the many flavors of Grixis. The best thing we have going for us is a very good matchup versus Miracles. Basically put the deck isn't ""not a tier 1 deck"" but actively struggling to remain relevant and is only propped up by it's highly dedicated playerbase. I don't want this to come off so terrible but the reality is that we're at the complete bottom of the win percentage table right now and you should know it before spending the still hundreds of dollars the deck will cost.   Okay with all that gloom and doom out of the way I need to first mention that I believe Enchantress should be built in the following way. You choose which secondary or tertiary win-condition you want after Emrakul, which is the best win condition by far, and build the rest of the deck around that. Sigil of the Empty Throne, Words of War, and Rest in Peace/Helm of Obedience are the most popular choices but you could also test some fringe cards like Myth Realized or Doomwake Giant.  So for example if you want Words of War then you probably don't want Supression Fields. But without Words of War to ping down small dudes you might want to play 4 Elephant Grass instead of the ""standard"" 3.   I'll drop in a really standard list here.   Enchantment (30)  4x Elephant Grass  4x Enchantress's Presence  2x Oblivion Ring  1x Sigil of the Empty Throne  3x Solitary Confinement  3x Mirri's Guile  2x Sterling Grove  3x Suppression Field  4x Utopia Sprawl  4x Wild Growth  Land (20)  9x Forest  1x Karakas  2x Plains  1x Savannah  3x Serra's Sanctum  4x Windswept Heath  Creature (6)  4x Argothian Enchantress  1x Eidolon of Blossoms  1x Emrakul, the Aeons Torn  Sorcery (4)  4x Green Sun's Zenith  Sideboard (15)  1x Banishing Light  2x Choke  1x Grafdigger's Cage  1x Gaddock Teeg  2x Eidolon of Rhetoric  3x Swords to Plowshares  1x Nevermore  4x Leyline of Sanctity  I would highly suggest learning to play with a list similar to this. You need to get a lot of the motions down to remember all your triggers. Remember that the Enchantress triggers are on cast not resolution or ETB so my motion is usually something like ""Oblvion ring"", hold up 2 fingers ""2 draw triggers"" pause implying you're asking if it resolves. To make this slightly more complicated remember that Eidolon is an ETB trigger so you need to announce and draw for that one separately as well. This definitely sounds easy but when you've locked your opponent out of the game just like like a good Miracles player you'll need to practice and be able to move through these motions and decisions very quickly without messing up your draws.   The other reason I suggest practicing with a list like this is so you can learn when you pay for elephant grass and solitary and when you let them go.  I love the deck to death and could basically talk about it all day if given the opportunity so if there's absolutely anything you want to know feel free to ask."
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,ReallyForeverAlone,1 point,Fri Jul 3 00:41:26 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks alot!  I don't mind getting into a deck that may be losing, I was able to get the pieces missing to build the whole deck using spare credit so it is costing me nothing in reality to build the deck.  What do you think the deck is missing to bring it back to relevance?"
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,kiwithief,2,Fri Jul 3 14:35:34 2015 UTC,"Truthfully, I think too much incidental hate might have been printed to prevent the deck from ever being truly relevant again. Reclamation Sage, Council's Judgement, Golgari Charm, Abrupt Decay, are big players but the list goes on and Theros didn't exactly inspire much confidence that we'll be seeing tech anytime soon.  But in general I think the deck needs two things. First, I think it needs a way to interact or beat combo at least some of the time. I don't think this is impossible. Death and Taxes beats combo without playing blue for example. Second, I think think it needs a plan which is harder to disrupt in the same way that Lands or Omnitell win but operate on tough-to-beat axis. The engine for a long time was much harder to disrupt but as mentioned before we've just been hit over and over by cards basically designed to hate on other things but end up wrecking us. An example of a realistic, printable card that would help us might be a Boseiju for enchantments.   The other approach, which I've taken, is just forget trying to tune 4 - 6 cards in the deck (not that I don't have this type of list prepped and tuned) and rip the list to pieces and start over trying different color combinations and angles of attack while keeping basically only the enchantresses as a draw engine instead of the way to survive in a prison bubble."
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,MelonJuice7,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:08:07 2015 UTC,Have you had any success with trying other colors?  I've seen some lists run blue as a way to power out the combo.
MTGLegacy,3bx6fv,tresle101,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:32:25 2015 UTC,I won't feel like I've had any success until I can either regularly do well in daily events or spike a medium/large paper event. I'm not sure what blue lists you've seen but I'd like to see them since from my forum experience I've never seen anyone else trying out the Brainstorm/FoW/Ponder combo that I am.   I've also tried black for Engineered Plague and Thoughtseize and while I liked Thoughtseize I found Plague slightly underwhelming in the current metagame.

Also fights abrupt decay. On top of that it allows me to have more spicy one of's. I'm not sold on this right now though because I don't think my elves match up got any better.
MTGLegacy,3bu13q,ChemicalBurns156,4,Thu Jul 2 03:41:35 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about probe? Do you feel the information helps you by quite a lot (either on your ability to race in the given game, or how to plan your counters, perhaps?)? Why only 2?"
MTGLegacy,3bu13q,Hydrogoose,6,Thu Jul 2 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"You literally have only 2 anything flex spots in modern RUG lists.  Its technically 6 but 2 of them have to be removal to hit deathrites and 2 countermagic to give you enough disruption to have favorable combo matchups.  Every RUG deck is  4 Delver  4 Goyf  4 Goose  4 FOW  4 Daze  4 Stifle  4 Brainstorm  4 ponder  4 lightning bolt  4 wasteland  8 fetch  3/3 dual split  There is an argument to whether or not stifle really is a shoe in staple or not but I really think there isn't a reason to weaken your mana denial plan on RUG.  Now this techincally makes for 6 flex slots BUT 8 counterspells is not enough for the deck.  This makes spell pierce as at least a 2 of staple in almost all RUG lists which leaves only 4 slots.  The problem is deathrite is very good against the deck and 4 bolts does not give you a fair shot at turn 1: kill deathrite, therefore just about every rug deck uses 2 slots on additional removal.  That gives you 2 slots, these are your true flex spots.  The rest of RUG delver's md is pretty much set at this point."
MTGLegacy,3bu13q,Umezete,2,Thu Jul 2 10:55:39 2015 UTC,"So for those ""six"" flex spots, am I right to assume that the norm is 2 Spell Pierce, 2 Forked Bolt, and then some combination of Probe, Spell Snare, or a third Spell Pierce/Forked Bolt?"
MTGLegacy,3bu13q,wintermute93,1 point,Thu Jul 2 23:31:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, though with the decline of elves and rise of tasigurs there is a solid argument for MD dismembers over bolts."
MTGLegacy,3bu13q,Umezete,2,Fri Jul 3 01:16:54 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely correct - although I haven't listed Pierce as part of the core, this is just due the variability in number played in the main, and hence why I'll be talking about it in Part 3 concerning flex slots and sideboarding. As you've also said, two extra removal spells is standard but I think discussing the merits of all the possible options is valuable and worth looking into in a section seperate from our RUG 54. And as you said, the two ""true"" flex slots have a lot of options too."

MTGLegacy,3bu13q,Umezete,1 point,Mon Jul 6 09:30:04 2015 UTC,"I think you'd need to make another deck.

MTGLegacy,3bu8ns,ashent2,2,Thu Jul 2 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"Probes are either hit or miss in my experience. Sometimes they are in your opener with a cabal therapy and you absolutely wreck any chance they had of executing their gameplan. Other times you topdeck a probe which cycles you into another probe which you cycle into a land. They can be really underwhelming. They also help the blue count for FoW, but I don't know if that's good enough to keep them in over something as consistent as top."

MTGLegacy,3bu8ns,d3sden0va,3,Thu Jul 2 08:01:12 2015 UTC,"The solution is just to curve out lower. IMO, in bug nic fit the vet serves as a way to power out a turn 2 jace, an early DTT or a turn 3 or 4 six mana bomb.

Deed I like in Jund but in Reanimator I find it too slow for what it does, you would be better off maxing out on Decays and a bounce spell to deal with hate.

Both can't hit me hard enough in 4 turns even if I do reanimate something big.
MTGLegacy,3bsskd,Watchyobak,1 point,Thu Jul 2 21:14:33 2015 UTC,"I've got some curiosity as to why you're playing with show and tell when you have show and tell. The reason to play green is to free up space for your sideboard. I'll get to this later.  That aside, here are my critiques. Your mainboard looks great. Super solid. I play the same BUg variant and play 14 lands and 3 petals. If you want more cantrips, thoughtseize, or silver bullet mainboard you can cut one fetch or basic swamp (saw you had 2) for one. The deck functions great on 14 to 16 land + petals. If your comfortable with your mainboard, which I'd imagine you are with this build, excellent. I like it regardless.   Sideboard needs A LOT of help IMO. You are running massacre AND dread of night. You only need massacre. 2x massacre is great, no need for the dread. Id suggest a replacement of dispel. Its 1 mana and absolutely surprises everyone. Stops removal and counters in mid game. Keranos - Waaaay too slow. It's meant for control, not combo. I'd suggest cutting it for a flusterstorm. Storm is not really a problem honestly, but having a flusterstorm kinda feels right and helps in weird pinches. Helm......suuuuuuure. I used to play with a misthollow griffon, surprise factor is real and awesome. Needles: good. Pernicious deed: no. Not good. Needs too much setup. Abrupt decay is better. That's why we play green. This takes too long to set up safely. Try echoing truth. Feels better, instant speed, quite good, hits what you want and you can combo off on untap. Untapped mana is scarier than a deed that can get AD'd.   So...show and tell. Green means we don't need this. Some people like it, some don't. But it is counterintuitive to play it with the splash. Without the splash we can side into sol lands and a full set of these. You play a low creature count so the hit factor is lower. This deck is SUPER explosive. SnT is slower than our deck, which is why we beat Omni 9 times out of 10. Playing a full set of abrupt decay makes miracles sad. Gives us a chance against BUG delver. Of which BOTH are big right now. I would suggest cutting them.   My sideboard currently looks as such:  4 AD  2 Needles  2 echoing truth  2 massacre  1 dispel  1 flusterstorm  1 hurkyls recall  1 ashen rider (concession to Omni)  1 tidespout  If you have any specific questions I'd love to help. Reanimator is my favorite deck and I have quite a lot of experience with it and can explain selections more if needed."
MTGLegacy,3bsjig,Jokey665,12,Wed Jul 1 20:14:12 2015 UTC,"since you asked for the opinion of the internet, here's mine... For me, one way to measure a card's worth is to compare it to other similarly costed cards in Legacy. Of the top of my head, for 3 mana, you could be costing Show & Tell. Is this card better? Another way to measure a card is to compare it to other cards with similar effects. In this case, null rod. Null rod only costs 2, but it can't attack, and only affects artifacts. However, null rod shuts down non-mana activated abilities, which in my opinion is more powerful than causing one point of damage. And null rod can't be STPlowshared or Bolted. This card just causes damage, it doesn't take control of the game state. One of the reasons Death & Taxes works because it creates situations that it's opponent can't get out of: taxing mana by adding costs to cast spells, and denying it's opponents mana through wasteland/ports. D&T wouldn't be nearly as effective if opponents just had to take 1 point of damage to cast their spells. That taking damage is inconvenient, but life is just resource to be spent while you're trying to take control of the game. Hope that helps...  I would love for some red-green beat-down/prison deck to work BTW. Of the top of my head, I'd look at red taxing cards... eidolon of the great revel, tunnel ignus, scab-clan berserker, zo-zu the punisher, pyrostatic pillar..."

MTGLegacy,3bsjig,dripdropdiet,6,Fri Jul 3 15:09:09 2015 UTC,"I want to say now off the bat. It is a 3/4 for 3 mana in 2 colors, in a format where fair decks are going to pester your resources and unfair decks are going to try to win by then. The only deck that this really messes with is elves and jund has a pretty okay matchup against them already. Other than elves there isn't anything on the list where I worry about the 1 point of damage coming across. If it had 2 or 3 damage associate with the trigger then I would start to bend down that line of thinking."
MTGLegacy,3bsjig,tumescentpie,5,Wed Jul 1 20:20:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, my fear is that the hoops you have to jump through to play it might be just a bit too big, and the rewards you do get for playing it might be just a bit too small."
MTGLegacy,3bsjig,keaiperoapocopang,3,Wed Jul 1 20:25:25 2015 UTC,"Even Elves wouldn't worry a whole lot about this card. I've seen skilled pilots play around Eidolon - made it look easy, even. Natural Order just makes going over hate easy."
MTGLegacy,3bsjig,tumescentpie,2,Thu Jul 2 01:11:09 2015 UTC,It only messes with them a little. I didn't mean it kills their game plan. It is a minor annoyance. Taking 5-10 damage during a couple of turns while you are doing all the stuff isn't 20.

Versus Omni:  -2 S&T  +2 Omniscience  -2 Soft Counter (Spell Pierce for me)  +1 Boseiju  +1 Wipe Away  Your S&Ts will likely kill you, but slapping in an Omniscience off theirs can give you a chance. Omni will likely win a counter war, so Boseiju is one of the best early draws. Casting Wipe Away on their Omniscience while they are cantripping can really set them back.  Versus Grixis:  -2 Soft Counter  +2 Bloodmoon  -2 DTT  +2 Pyroclasm  -1 Gitaxian Probe  +2 Boseiju  I actually board out my DTTs pretty often. But I have found Grixis to play a lot like RUG, but with smaller creatures. Hence the pyroclasms. But if you feel confidant in the speed of your deck, you could even drop them.  But for the record, Omni regularly crushes me. Grixis, I would say, is 60-40 in my favor."
MTGLegacy,3brs3f,iwillcorrectyou,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:42:07 2015 UTC,Great. Thank you. I'm going to a GP so I have to take the general meta into account.   Do you side in Omni against other decks too?
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,RolandDPlaneswalker,27,Wed Jul 1 14:28:17 2015 UTC,"Grixis control swiftly and sadly shifts toward obsolessence.    Omni becomes garbage tier again.    Shardless becomes the default card advantage wins deck.  Miracles feels like something is amiss, but it can't seem to discern what changed.  Goes back to dominating."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Sansia,15,Wed Jul 1 14:44:55 2015 UTC,Shardless becomes the default card advantage wins deck.   Nah son.   Goblins.

MTGLegacy,3br7uo,branewalker,2,Wed Jul 1 23:48:23 2015 UTC,"I was kinda joking, but I'm happy to play against Deathrite decks with Goblins tbh. The games are always interesting with a lot of back and forth."

MTGLegacy,3br7uo,notaprisoner,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:31:54 2015 UTC,Grixis control doesn't focus heavily on either of those cards.  I'm talking about pyromancer control not g-delver or grixis midrange.

MTGLegacy,3br7uo,syntaxr,13,Wed Jul 1 14:59:57 2015 UTC,"Let's be competely honest... Omni was an occasionally high-performing pet deck before DTT.  Prior to late last year, when was the last time you said ""but what about my omni match up?"""

MTGLegacy,3br7uo,TheBotherer,5,Wed Jul 1 17:04:22 2015 UTC,"More people will play it, even. Because they finished it when the deck was winning.  Legacy is less of a ""play a different deck every few months"" format like the others can be."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,ashent2,8,Wed Jul 1 15:02:39 2015 UTC,What are the chances that DTT does get banned though? It doesn't warp the format like Treasure Cruise did and it already survived one ban update.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,baffman,10,Wed Jul 1 16:08:27 2015 UTC,Low.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,bac5665,2,Wed Jul 1 16:17:04 2015 UTC,I certainly hope note. It continue to push the deck towards blue blue blue blue blue. It's waay to powerful. Should be banned and it should DEFINITELY be restricted.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,milesrout,3,Wed Jul 1 21:29:19 2015 UTC,Why are you playing Legacy and not tapping Islands   Because this little $2 bitch Thalia shuts down those island-tapping opponents just fine.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Ozy-dead,2,Wed Jul 1 21:35:24 2015 UTC,Why are you playing Legacy and not tapping Islands    Red deck wins.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Sir_Laser,-5,Thu Jul 2 08:05:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly if we are looking for cards more likely getting banned, I'm even Cradle has higher chance than DTT."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Gredenis,7,Thu Jul 2 06:54:09 2015 UTC,"I can't see Cradle banned.  The card goes in one deck.  It's a good deck, but it's not degenerate or abusive.  Nor is it dominating the meta.    I can't see cradle banned."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,bac5665,4,Wed Jul 1 18:07:00 2015 UTC,Oh I agree 100%.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Gredenis,-1,Wed Jul 1 18:07:50 2015 UTC,But it has warped the format.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,steve2112rush,2,Wed Jul 1 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"In what way? It has changed the format for sure, but I wouldn't say the format is warped."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,baffman,-6,Thu Jul 2 07:50:32 2015 UTC,"When you have to have Omni hate in your sideboard, I would say the format is warped. Why is the deck so resilient and good? DTT.   It's literally Omni and anti-omni decks right now. Dig has also gone into every deck that can and it is beyond busted. It pushes the blue cantrip shell into overdrive. Miracles is playing dig to keep up with the other decks playing dig. How is that not warped?"
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,steve2112rush,6,Thu Jul 2 14:34:39 2015 UTC,"You have to hate any top deck in your sideboard, this was true before Omni and will be true long after Omni is replaced by something better. Should we ban Terminus because you have to play sideboard cards for the Miracles matchup? The sideboard exists for this purpose.  Omni isn't even the best or most represented deck. The format is not Omni and anti-Omni decks, the format is essentially what it was pre-TC with Omni more represented than it was before. If the format was truly that warped where Omni and decks that beat Omni were the only decks played it would all Omni, MUD and Reanimator."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,baffman,12,Thu Jul 2 15:12:59 2015 UTC,Less Omnitell. More miracles and delver.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Jables237,13,Thu Jul 2 16:08:45 2015 UTC,"Alot of Miracles uses 2 digs and that is a big way to dig out of getting grounded out.  So it would be less miracles and omnitell, more elves, shardless, and delver.  Miracles will still be really strong but its still a nerf to it."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Umezete,3,Wed Jul 1 14:33:02 2015 UTC,I feel Omni is a rough match up for miracles. With less omni running around I see miracles going up.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Jables237,6,Wed Jul 1 14:51:47 2015 UTC,Also miracles is far from reliant on Dig.  It's basically only there as a concession to every other deck that's using Dig because card advantage is the way to beat miracles.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Sansia,2,Wed Jul 1 15:00:55 2015 UTC,"Its still its best way to get back from behind on ca.  Without dig miracles is more vulnerable to hand disruption and grindy CA.  Its not reliant on the effect, but nor can it replace it.  Miracles without dig is strictly worse than miracles with dig."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Umezete,4,Wed Jul 1 15:28:55 2015 UTC,"That fact is granted, but what we're asking is whether miracles without dig is worse than the rest of the field without dig, and since miracles was already ahead prior to Khans, it's pretty reasonable to assume that it will continue to be the top deck in Dig's theoretical absense."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Sansia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:46:22 2015 UTC,"and since miracles was already ahead prior to Khans, it's pretty reasonable to assume that it will continue to be the top deck in Dig's theoretical absense.   Exactly this. I don't know why this Umezete guy is insistent on the fact that Miracles will take such a hit. Miracles was an incredibly good deck prior to DTTs printing and if DTT is banned, all other decks that benefit from it will take an equal or more substantial hit (Omni) and there haven't really been many serious threats to Miracles since DTTs printing anyway, so essentially things would go back to the way they were before, which still favored Miracles in most matchups."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Magnum256,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:50:57 2015 UTC,"I think Joe Lossett would disagree, at least with no ponder miracles he seems to love that matchup."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,SEMLover,5,Wed Jul 1 16:27:38 2015 UTC,"Joe Lossett's build also runs 5 creatures with incredibly disruptive ETB abilities from an Omnitell player's point of view.  His version is less commonly played, but certainly is far ahead in the Omni match up."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Sansia,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:57:13 2015 UTC,"Lossett's build sacrifices strength against some decks to have a better MU against others. Ponder Miracles smooths out MUs across the board so that almost all of them range from 45-55 to 55-45. Lossett's Miracles changes that spread from 35-65 to 65-35, roughly."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,ReallyForeverAlone,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:17:18 2015 UTC,"I'm really conflicted about it, since Joe is the absolute master of Miracles, and Reid Duke plays 4 ponder...can't tell who to listen to..."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,SEMLover,6,Wed Jul 1 16:26:19 2015 UTC,Joe is an amazing pilot playing what many consider to be a subpar list.  Listen to Philipp Schoenegger.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,ReallyForeverAlone,3,Wed Jul 1 18:14:49 2015 UTC,"I think Joe is more obsessed with being ""that guy with the weird miracles build"".  Before DTT's printing I respected his list, I considered it a different approach to the deck that had slightly altered strengths and weaknesses.  Now that DTT is out, it's pretty clear to me that he just wants to play his version of the deck, despite it being completely inferior, in my opinion."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Eric91,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:02:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know if I agree with this statement. I mean, the deck is good. Joe is one of the best Miracle players around. I think the deck may be inferior in the hands of any other player who isn't Joe. But when you put it in Joe's hands it's 1 million times better. I think he plays it because he legitimately believes it to be the best list. It's kinda similar to how most people play ANT and Bryant Cook plays TES. The deck overall is probably worse but in Cooks hands it's way better."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,TKHoga,2,Wed Jul 1 19:06:45 2015 UTC,Reid Duke doesn't play 4 ponder.

All in all, seems like a negative to me.  (And before someone tries, no, I do not play with DTT, nor have I ever even cast one.)"
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Timiniel,13,Wed Jul 1 16:41:44 2015 UTC,nor have I ever even cast one.   Dude you should get on that. Casting DTT is pretty amazing.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,LRats,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:20:22 2015 UTC,I've cast it like twice and found 6 lands one of those times.. maybe I should be casting it in vintage.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Derpalisk,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:29:23 2015 UTC,"No keep doing it in Legacy. That's the beauty of DTT. Think about what would have happened if you hadn't cast it. You would have drawn 6 lands in a row and lost. That is a second reason why it is so good. Not only do you get 2 cards, but you get rid of all the garbage cards."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,LRats,2,Thu Jul 2 12:32:25 2015 UTC,"I only cast it in modern twice.. which I stopped playing. I've moved on to a deck that plays no colors now for legacy, and I'm loving it."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Derpalisk,0,Thu Jul 2 15:21:24 2015 UTC,"I bet it is, but I simply don't have the time to play all decks I can... One day, eventually, I'll make an omnitell deck. I've been meaning to since dream halls was considered a mainboard must, just so you know. It just so happens that I have too many lists I want to try, and too few tournaments and chances to play to get through all of them >_<"
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Timiniel,6,Thu Jul 2 16:05:29 2015 UTC,"I'm curious why I keep on hearing talk about DTT getting the ban hammer. It just isn't as format warping as TC was. Look at the top 8 performing decklists from the three most recent Star City Games tournaments. At SCG Super IQ Columbia there were 10 copies of DTT in the top 8 decklists; at SCG Invi Qualifier Dalton there were 7 copies in the top 8 decks; and SCG Permier IQ Baltimore there were 8 total copies of in the top 8 decks. The only deck running 4 was Omni-tell, which didn't win any of these tournaments."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,dripdropdiet,9,Wed Jul 1 17:31:53 2015 UTC,It's really format-warping.
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,milesrout,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:30:18 2015 UTC,Making one deck viable is not warping. Omni still isn't the top deck. Miracles has held that for a long time. Should we ban top?
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Jables237,5,Wed Jul 1 21:29:32 2015 UTC,Probably just a huge pile of butt hurt Hymn to Tourach players like me :P
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Manaplease,4,Fri Jul 3 15:45:44 2015 UTC,"I don't see it happening, I think people are just lumping it in with Treasure Cruise and assuming it gets banned for the same reasons."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,baffman,8,Wed Jul 1 21:09:59 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that was exactly WotC's reason for banning it in Modern."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,Maxtortion,2,Wed Jul 1 16:34:09 2015 UTC,"True, but it's not the same card. The difference between 1 and 2 CMC in Legacy is a lot bigger than in Modern. In a Modern setting they are much closer to being the same card."
MTGLegacy,3br7uo,baffman,7,Wed Jul 1 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"Honestly the only reason I want DTT banned is because it's blue. I play only blue decks in Legacy (favorite color since 1995), but I would rather there be less things in the color that are just total blow outs for every other color. Delve card drawing spells just hose black so much since discard just feeds it. Discard is one of the few reasons to play black. :("

Plus, BSZ for value isn't bad while of going off, and it even gives you a shuffle which works with SDT (though I don't play them in my list... been thinking of adding 1 or 2)."
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,bunkoRtist,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:39:48 2015 UTC,"The probabilaty to have you'r wishes are getting removed entirely pre-board is pretty low. After sideboard it is very much diffrent! I always board in BSZ and out with 1 High Tide because of this reason, if they manage to surgical you'r wish you have a kill card in the deck, if they surgical your high tide you have one in the board to wish for."
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,bunkoRtist,1 point,Thu Jul 2 01:54:10 2015 UTC,"Well, it's not just surgicals. I think Meddling Mage is an equally likely prospect, and I see no answers to a resolved Meddling Mage. I agree it wont' happen too often, but it's an angle of attack that you can fix mainboard with very little cost. At least that's my take on it."
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,BParkes,6,Thu Jul 2 03:22:16 2015 UTC,Looks like High Tide all right... I'm unsure what you are really looking for here?

MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,Cap_Jizzbeard,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:59:09 2015 UTC,Well my understanding is that spiral tide is something like 1-2 turns slower than omnitell but folds to much of the same hate. What are your plans to deal with that? I don't see anything that really makes your list tuned for the expected metagame other than the four counterbalance but I haven't played high tide before so I can't even guess what matchups those come in for or how much better they make them.
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,NoChurch,3,Wed Jul 1 14:12:17 2015 UTC,"Have you tested with DTT yet? It seems like scooping all those cards would be tough, as you're not going to have lands in there during the combo turn, plus you might have to get rid of cantrips that you need later.   Also, I'd have to say that a maindeck Blue Sun's Zenith is necessary, since you want to be able to win if your opponent knows to hit your Cunning Wishes. That way, you can just scroll up a Blue Sun and win without the wishboard.  Capsize is kind of a win-more card in my opinion. I'd cut the DTTs, put in that SB Flusterstorm in the main, and put a Repeal or two in the side. It's not a horrible play vs Delver or Infect to see some of those.   Otherwise, it looks pretty solid! Best of luck!"
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,Feline_o1,0,Wed Jul 1 18:08:36 2015 UTC,"I have played with DTT(even with the red splash for 1x Past In Flames) and the reason im running it is beacuse it digs(Pun intended) so well after protection/combo pieces, one think with Time Spiral(which is very important for the combo) is that it can't be tutored with Mercant Scroll. Dig really helps finding it easier, while at the cost for exiling cantrips, but you also get to exile lands(which you dont want to draw during the combo turn)."
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,Feline_o1,3,Thu Jul 2 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Apparently there's gonna be an ice-cream vendor at Lille, thus for (ice-cream) flavour reasons I think you should go more all in on the Brain Freeze plan and make sure that all of your basics are Snow-covered Islands."

MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,mollters,2,Thu Jul 2 01:48:07 2015 UTC,"Run 4 tops especially with those Counterbalance in the sideboard. -1 a preordain for the 4th top.  Try to squeeze in another Flusterstorm to the maindeck, I am very bias towards this card though. You could -1 Candel for the additional Flusterstorm, since Turnabout is like a candel that you can Scroll for anyhow.  As for games 2/3, -1 High Tide to the side and +1 the Blue Sun Zenith to the main, incase someone cuts off your High Tides or Cunning Wishes with Extraction type effects from their sideboard. It never happens game 1 though, unless the person is nuts.  Anyhow, all in all, these are just my opinions/preferences, in the end, the shell of all High Tide decks are the same, make lots of mana, draw lots of cards!"
MTGLegacy,3bqnvx,rrrOuta,2,Wed Jul 1 22:45:43 2015 UTC,"I always board out 1 High Tide and in with a win condition, have played the deck for some time now(Previously with a red splash for Past In Flames and 2x Intuition Mainboard).  I was thinking of removing one Candel for a another counterspell, but i have been thinking of Swan Song instead of fluster(Hits the same things and hits Counterbalance).  About Top, i don't really like it in the deck. Think it is to slow and takes up alot of mana, the reason im running it is because i want to have Counterbalance in the board.

You can't reasonably expect to continue to hold WOTC to a promise they made over a decade ago (imagine a business that bought into the ""Internet is a fad"" thing and made a ridiculous promise not to use it... should they seriously handicap themselves simply to keep a promise just because they were wrong?). I don't think it's as clear-cut, but I can see how Hasbro would want to simply avoid court fees and such since there is a case to be made, even if they think they'd ultimately win."

MTGLegacy,3brab6,TheBotherer,9,Wed Jul 1 19:19:25 2015 UTC,Power creep on creatures is definitely real. Virtually no pre modern creatures are played in legacy. The only ones I can think of are nimble mongoose and goblin welder. It's spells that have gotten consistently worse which fits into wizards plan of a creature combat oriented game.
MTGLegacy,3brab6,montebanc08,8,Wed Jul 1 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"Ichorid,mother of runes, xanthrid swarm, goblin lacky,ringleader,matron,sharpshooter, and the enchantress,wirewood symbiote, quirion ranger, putrid imp,elvish spirit guide, and imperial recruiter are all very sad right now."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,Ozy-dead,4,Wed Jul 1 19:24:19 2015 UTC,"In addition to the ones listed by /u/montebanc08: Metalworker, Meddling Mage (which, although it is legal in Modern, was originally printed in Planeshift), Lord of Atlantis (same dealio as Meddles), Goblin Warchief, and Phyrexian Dreadnaught (although not so much anymore - but there was a time not too long ago when it had an entire deck named after it). IIRC Academy Rector also sees minimal amounts of play in some fringe builds of Maverick and/or Nic Fit. That's just off the top of my head, I'm sure there are others.  Oh, and then there are the creatures that are actually banned in Legacy: Goblin Recruiter, Hermit Druid, and Tempest Efreet (okay, okay, the last one is cheating).   That said, you're right, creatures are definitely getting more powerful on average. That's not related to lands, though, which have distinctly gotten less powerful. The most powerful lands were all printed a long time ago: the original duals, Tolarian Academy, Mishra's Workshop, Library of Alexandria, Tabernacle, Gaea's Cradle, Karakas, Cloudpost, Strip Mine, Wasteland, Rishadan Port, Ancient Tomb, City of Traitors, Maze of Ith... I'm sure there are ones I'm forgetting. Even the fetches were originally printed in Onslaught, and those weren't Modern legal until a year ago. What do we get now? Forget Wasteland, don't even think about Strip Mine. Instead, we get Tec Edge and Ghost Quarter. Instead of any of the sweet utility lands like above, now we get Gavony Township... if we get any at all!

MTGLegacy,3brab6,Sir_Laser,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:35:44 2015 UTC,Yeah and in my opinion creatures abilities are just as strong as ever but now we are seeing more efficient power/toughness and keyword cost and alternative costs being very good on creatures such as delve or play a 1/1 blue creature and reveal on your next draw step delver style creatures.

In addition, Legacy is full of modern spells. Ponder, Jace, Pierce, Probe, Dig Through Time, Preordain, Council's Judgment, Flusterstorm, Thoughtseize... these are among the most powerful spells in the game, period. If you cherry pick the really broken stuff, then yeah, you find the most powerful things earlier in Magic because they didn't really understand how to balance it yet. But you still see new spells pushing the power level limit and entering eternal formats on a regular basis."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,BayLeaf-,1 point,Thu Jul 2 08:33:25 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  If you'll notice, though, these examples are either an answer to powerful spells they made in the past or design flaws, since R&D mostly balances around Standard and not the non-rotating formats.  Modern-day (modern-legal, let's say, so after 2003) spells are powerful because they're an answer (to previously powerful noncreature spells: (Flusterstorm for Storm cards, Pierce because noncreature spells are really good, etc.) or a mistake (cantrips used to be highly overcosted - [[Zap]], for example - because R&D considered them to be too good after Brainstorm was printed and didn't relent until Modern-day; they were right, and thus Serum Visions is a $15 card now; Dig/Cruise had to be banned in multiple formats, Jace because they were fiddling around w/ a 4-ability planeswalker and that got out of hand - apparently free Brainstorms are OP; Probe/Misstep because apparently paying life instead of mana is hella good - nod to Necropotence).   It's precisely because R&D have gotten better at balancing things that creatures are getting progressively better and spells are not as a long-term trend. Alpha/Beta/Unlimited's best creature was Serra Angel. Their best spells are not in Legacy because they're banned due to power level reasons."

The problem people have is that cards cost too much and they blame the reserve list. Modern doesn't have a single card on the reserve list and decks are creeping up to legacy in terms of cost. Many people like myself bought and play legacy because we feel safe spending the money on cards because the value will not drop."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,swegen9,7,Sat Jul 4 00:00:34 2015 UTC,play legacy because we feel safe spending the money on cards because the value will not drop.   also because legacy is sweet and modern is mind-numbingly boring.

MTGLegacy,3brab6,L0rdAceX,2,Wed Jul 1 17:10:29 2015 UTC,I think that's a fair point. I was shocked at how much it cost to put DredgeVine together for Modern.
MTGLegacy,3brab6,randomnickname99,2,Wed Jul 1 17:16:34 2015 UTC,"The fact is that if the game suffers a drop in popularity, which is neither unprecedented or unlikely, then the value of those decks will fall. There's a point where it's healthier for the value of cards for the reserve list to be abolished."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,FG_cash,1 point,Wed Jul 1 16:33:58 2015 UTC,I'm also of the opinion that even if there was a reprint a lot of the value of the original cards (like the dual lands) would remain intact. There will always be a market for the original product (look at the fetch reprints) even if it is diminished by a reprint. Also legacy is a format where it can be pretty awesome to pimp out a deck so some there's some market there too.
MTGLegacy,3brab6,Code_Rinzler,3,Thu Jul 2 15:17:44 2015 UTC,"This might not really be a solution to the reserve list, but WOTC doesn't have obligations for Legacy staples not on the Reserve List right? If they can't reprint the duals, they could just reprint everything around the duals: IE Cards like Show and Tell, Sneak Attack, Stoneforge Mystic, Sensei's Divining Top, Umezawa's Jitte etc. These cards are expensive Legacy staples that would overall drop the price of Legacy if reprinted (I would love to see Legacy Masters or something), but aren't on the reserve list. I think WOTC COULD theoretically start there. The only issue for them is Legacy doesn't directly make them money like Modern and Standard do.   I do still realize there is still an elephant in the room and reprinting these cards is still a roundabout solution if not one at all."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,jvLin,6,Thu Jul 2 15:37:11 2015 UTC,"It would drop the prices of the cards sound the reserve list cards, but that would push the reserve list cards even higher in price as more people would be looking for those specific cards."

MTGLegacy,3brab6,Ozy-dead,3,Wed Jul 1 17:10:02 2015 UTC,"That's not a loophole because the reserve list is for tournament-legal cards. It doesn't matter if they're gold- or silver-bordered, or if they're the size of your face. If it's tournament-legal, it won't be reprinted."

MTGLegacy,3brab6,milesrout,2,Wed Jul 1 14:52:21 2015 UTC,"I think that dumping the list will do very little to the price, even with reprints. Cards of older editions hold collector value (compare old and khans fetches - big difference). Modern showed us that even with large print runs, cards in high demand will go up. Snapcaster, Collected Company (used to be $2 card) Serum Visions (it is a common ffs) - all are creeping up in prices w/o being on reserve, and seeing decently large supply.   And the thing is - they can dump the reserved list, but they control how it's printed. Why not run a limited Vintage Masters? With MM2 boosters hitting $10 in some places, they can easily do a $20-30 booster for vintage. Vintage is a collector's format. Legacy is very close to becoming one. Collectors will still value older editions. Prices go up because people want to play the format. Give people ways to play already.   Edit: Alternatively, make new lands and new fetches that can fetch them. Boom, problem solved."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,milesrout,-1,Wed Jul 1 16:51:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. I can't speak for anyone else, but as I'm building my Legacy deck, I am only buying cards from the original set they ran in. So I'm in hot pursuit of 4 City of Brass from Arabian Nights for example, even though I can easily buy the Chronicles print of it for $2.49 or whatever it is because I want the original. The fact that it's reprinted doesn't even register to me.  Same deal with Modern. I want the originals if I can grab them."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,Manaplease,3,Wed Jul 1 18:27:46 2015 UTC,Very limited print runs like modern masters to just push a few more copies into the market on a regular basis.  You won't tank the prices of the originals that way.
MTGLegacy,3brab6,potatodavid,4,Wed Jul 1 19:17:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly, there really is no reason to remove the reserved list. I enjoy that paper Legacy is a more niche community. You have to be somewhat competent at the game to want to sped a few grand on magic cards. Once they inevitably fix modo, there will be a cheap venue for many legacy players to get a taste of the format."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,Claw01,2,Wed Jul 1 22:43:02 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping for better reprint ideas, like the legendary dual idea.   Have a legendary land counts as a mountain and an island tops for r or u enters untapped. Since it's legendary you can only have one on the battlefield at a time, but would ease the barrier to entry a bit."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Thu Jul 2 08:40:12 2015 UTC,That would just increase demand for the others and would be in demand from everyone currently playing Legacy.

MTGLegacy,3brab6,ilazul,5,Wed Jul 1 16:31:15 2015 UTC,"How do you think that works? Why would a store become bankrupt when you reprint stuff from the reserved list. Yes, their stock will lose value, but not up to the point of bankrubtcy I think"
MTGLegacy,3brab6,MAC777,7,Wed Jul 1 17:03:20 2015 UTC,"I agree. For instance, if they reprint these (after given heads up) in a similar way to Modern Masters, it will generate massive revenue for the store through sealed product (and hopefully the profit there makes up for slight decrease in value of the originals), but if it encourages people to enter legacy (with a campaign to push legacy with like a major Pro Tour portion) it could encourage new entries into the market further minimizing the negative price change.   Basically, if they can shift the demand through shiny new Legacy Masters and Pro Tour Invite something and increase the supply through the Legacy Masters set to could keep the price near where is began after a mild period of correction. It isn't certain, but a Legacy Master would (as observed through Modern Masters) act as both increase in supply and demand.  Or they could go the chronicles route and kill their game, but I think they over corrected from that mistake.  Edit: Also, the thought of Foil duel lands...."
MTGLegacy,3brab6,ilazul,-1,Wed Jul 1 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"I think   These stores are all about margin, and while standard cards tend to have a higher markup percentage, reserved list stuff is gold in terms of total markup value dollarwise. Plus no one cares if you can mark up a 50 cent standard card to $2.50, because even then you're just barely covering shipping/processing costs etc. Selling one bayou online nets you as much after shipping as two dozen of those orders.   I think you're correct off the top. Losing a ton of value in your inventory combined with much narrower margins moving forward would only force a few of the smaller companies out of business. But those factors combined with a company ethos of cutting out the secondary market would lead to a bunch of other distributors just getting out of the game. It'll just be too expensive for them to justify the cost of doing business, the opportunity cost will get too high or whatever and they'll do something else for a living. At that point I'm sort of concerned about the ones that stay in business, because they'll be the only ones with a) profit margins to justify staying in it (so they're ripping someone off) or b) the lack of business acumen to realize they should get out (and so they're dopey).  Some of these are the same stores that host your local FNM. Sure it's a bit extreme to imply that repealing the Reserved List would cause your branch of ""WackyKidz Gamez"" to go out of business, but the fact remains that it makes the business less appealing to them. So maybe they start jamming the MtG cards in the corner case with the Pokemon gear so they can focus more on Yu-Gi-Oh and Warhammer.   MtG is doing great right now, so it's unlikely that would happen ... but what incentive does WotC have to change that? After all, this infrastructure is the grass root of the game's success--why fuck with their livelihood?  Sorry to ramble but this is something I've felt strongly about before I ever started vending cards.

I get the feeling this is really a list you'd have to play with to determine whether the splash is justified."
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,mickyj300x,3,Tue Jun 30 23:39:44 2015 UTC,And please for the love of all that is holy remember that it shuts off your own fetch lands.
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,ilazul,-1,Wed Jul 1 01:10:54 2015 UTC,Why would you play fetchlands in this deck...
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,milesrout,10,Wed Jul 1 07:07:05 2015 UTC,To find your Plateau..
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,milesrout,0,Wed Jul 1 07:45:26 2015 UTC,You'd be better off just playing other RW lands and four Plateaus. You don't need or want the shuffle effects and it conflicts with Magus.
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,TheBotherer,6,Wed Jul 1 07:46:21 2015 UTC,"Wasteland, dude"
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,milesrout,2,Wed Jul 1 07:52:09 2015 UTC,You're already running 8+ colorless lands and three Karakas. You still need to have enough basic Plains to not die to your own Blood Moon. Not having basics conflicts a lot more with Blood Moon than having fetches that find both your Plateaus and your basics.
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,TheBotherer,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:23:19 2015 UTC,"Sure, and the fact that Karakas, Wasteland and Port are much more important to you than others' lands are to them is one reason that Imperial Taxes feels like an inherently poor idea."
MTGLegacy,3bnsps,milesrout,2,Wed Jul 1 21:20:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I made no comment on that, and I haven't tried Imperial Taxes or played much against it, so it's hard for me to form an opinion. This was in response to the idea that, having decided to play the red splash, you'd be better off not running fetches, which is just false.   Putting that aside, the thing is that Wasteland etc. are not more important to you than your opponent's lands. In fact, if a Blood Moon effect shuts off all my opponent's lands, it basically does all the work that Port and Wasteland would have done on its own. Those cards are literally there to shut off your opponent's lands, and that's exactly what Blood Moon does. I think the point is that it helps out a couple poor match ups a lot (Infect, Elves), and shores up some mediocre-at-best match ups (Lands). In those match ups, one or two Wastelands or Ports are not usually going to be enough, but a Blood Moon effect can win you the game. It doesn't hurt that it is basically a free win against a lot of Delver decks, which tend to run no basics. I'd happily have my Karakas and my Wasteland be Mountains if my opponent's Bayou and Underground Sea can be as well.   The question is not ""Does it hurt me too much?"", it's ""is it worth the additional vulnerabilities and lessened cohesion that comes with splashing a color?"" In my personal opinion, it's not, but it's certainly not because I think Magus of the Moon hurts the deck. If Blood Moon/Magus of the Moon were white, I guarantee the deck would be running them already."

MTGLegacy,3bnsps,randomnickname99,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:31:05 2015 UTC,the meta around me is Jeskai Miracles and a good amount of omni tell. I have a much harder time against the miracles deck.

MTGLegacy,3bnsps,TheBotherer,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:37:20 2015 UTC,Stoneblade will likely get beat up in that meta.  It's too slow to pressure omni or miracles and not as powerful in the long game.

The second is to have [[wispmare]] and/or [[ingot chewer]] in your sideboard, which you can play cheaply for their evoke cost, and lotus petals to cast them.

That said, Force of Will is a pricey card which blows the budget if that's what drew you into playing dredge. It's transferable into so many other decks though that it's never a bad card to have in your collection if you want to play legacy long-term.  I really need to echo what /u/volrathxp said, though- learning to use cabal therapy effectively is still your strongest weapon. Gitaxian Probe obviously helps, but being able to blind-name and still hit is a skill that will reward you in the long run (it's also very satisfying when you blind name and hit multiples). There are a lot of good articles out there that give some solid advice, but practice and format knowledge are the main things here."
MTGLegacy,3blhny,InkmothNexus,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:51:31 2015 UTC,"Blue builds don't feel as dredge-y to me. I tried proxying up blue Dredge and I just don't like playing without Balustrade Spy or Chancellor of the Annex, honestly.  As for Cabal Therapy, that card is MVP. Every card in Dredge is very important, but Cabal Therapy is the best card in the deck. I've read a ton of articles on how to use it, but like you said, experience is the best tool for blind naming Cabal Therapy targets. I'm still getting used to Therapy, but I successfully blind named a Crop Rotation today and prevented myself from being Bojuka Bog'd :D I also successfully blind named a Rest in Peace. The best tip I read was to ""Picture the card you fear most and name it. If they have it, awesome, you got rid of it. If not, you have nothing threatening your combo and you can proceed without fear.""  I've goldfished my Dredge deck about 50 times in the past three days here and played about 5 matches on Cockatrice. I really like how difficult Legacy decks are to pilot. I always had the misconception that they were just expensive decks that took zero skill to play, but they really take practice to play effectively. Once the whole deck arrives, I'll probably run by that shop /u/InkmothNexus told me about and try playing there.  I have a lot to learn, for sure, I'm brand new to Legacy, but I think I am beginning to see why it is called the best format in Magic. It is such a wide playing field.

Try to slow dredge until you have what you need to cast them, but they are purely reactive, so you have to wait for them to hit the board then hope they don't get countered.  Containment priest can be dealt with with either sickening shoal or contagion. I prefer contagion, but both options are fine."
MTGLegacy,3blhny,wylatwork,3,Tue Jun 30 15:27:17 2015 UTC,"As some of the other folks here have said, if you're not playing the blue plan or the green plan with Dryad Arbors in the board, then your best defense is speed and Cabal Therapy plays.  Learning how to play Cabal Therapy is one of the hardest parts of the deck.  You have to know what could possibly be in the opponent's list (by researching various archetypes and decks to know what is commonly played) so that you can maximize the effectiveness of a Therapy.  Gitaxian Probe is your best friend here, since it can let you see your opp's hand if you think they have hate.  Containment Priest / DRS are actually fairly easy to deal with, since [[Contagion]] and [[Sickening Shoal]] kill them.  Both are instants, so its great.  Beyond that, as /u/wylatwork said, the blue plan is a good for dealing with hate since it actively runs counterspells to do so.  DShoal is good to pitch Whirlpool Rider too to deal with Rest in Peace, FoW for other stuff.  Another thing to worry about running into is the possibility of tax effects like [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]], [[Trinisphere]] and things like [[Chalice of the Void]] on 1 (which shoots down your Gitax Probes).  The tax effects can be actively played through however, since you can go on the zombie plan still."

MTGLegacy,3bl9v8,rifter5000,7,Tue Jun 30 06:51:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe if you want to add non-blue relatively straightforward combo decks you could try something like 12-post. People love playing big mana strategies, and anyone with experience playing Tron in modern (or extended?) but that hasn't played a Cloudpost deck will be amazed at how much mana they can generate in Legacy with the more powerful lands. I'm not saying Cloudpost is an easy deck or anything, but it's more accessible than something like TES: you can probably pick up the deck without being told its strategy and work it out pretty quickly, whereas with Storm you kinda have to be told about things like LED + Infernal Tutor and the three main combo methods (Ad Nauseam, tutor chaining, Past in Flames).   I don't think Miracles is a good idea: it's not that it's way more difficult than the other decks, but it is quite difficult, slow, and well it's not actually a lot of fun if the person playing it is inexperienced and slow.    If I had to come up with a list based on that, I'd:   Keep Shardless BUG. (midrange/control) Replace Miracles with Cloudpost. (combo) Replace Grixis Pyromancer with Grixis Control. (control) Keep RUG Delver. (tempo) Keep UWR Stoneblade. (midrange) Keep Lands. (WHO THE FUCK KNOWS) Keep Death & Taxes. (aggro-prison-non-blue-control-???) Replace OmniTell with Reanimator.

Miracles is probably the most skill intensive deck in my opinion. People that think it's just Counterbalance and Top until you get Entreat have never tried piloting the deck against other skilled players. It's probably the most punishing deck if piloted poorly.

You can -1 Jace to return your own snapcaster/clique/venser to your hand, you can clique yourself on your opponent's upkeep to draw a miracle, and now with monastery mentor, things are completely different.

Once on MTGO I turned over 3 Bridges, 1 Dread Return, 1 Flame-Kin Zealot and 3 Narcomoebas, at which point I made nine 3/3 zombies with haste and murdered my opponent.

Stack your Bridge triggers correctly - E.G. you attack with Ichorid, they block and both creatures die, Stack the triggers so that the creation of Zombie tokens, resolve BEFORE the Exile Bridge trigger. (place on stack as Exile then Zombie, so that it resolves and you get the Zombie token)  Aim for an opening hand with, Land, Discard, Dredger. and preferably a draw effect. If you can't get a discard, if you're on the play, just draw, pass, discard in cleanup.  If you think they are playing hate, don't be afraid to slow-dredge (Use the Thugs to dredge in stead of the Imps or Trolls, this means if they exile graveyard, you have library left to rebuild)  GOLDFISH!!  When you cast Looting with LED in play, retain priority and Crack the LED for RRR, this will let you dump your hand and get dredgers in the yard, it will also pay for the flashback, meaning you can do it again (the 2 cards in hand will both be dredgers, and discarded by looting)  Don't Panic, relax, if they remove your tokens, or your yard, just rebuild. this deck is resilient.  Don't over-sideboard, maybe trim a breakthrough or 2,  don't take too much out just for reactive cards to hate, most decks only have about 4 hate cards in the board at most for graveyard, as they need the slots for other hate (Creature removal, etc). So if you board in 8 cards to deal with hate they may or may not have, you are hurting yourself more than you are hurting them."

MTGLegacy,3bkd93,goblinpiledriver,7,Tue Jun 30 01:34:07 2015 UTC,"I think it's one of the most, if not the most flexible deck in the format (once you take the splash colors into account). Thanks to Matron and Ringleader, you will usually be able to find the exact card you want. Also, due to Cavern of Souls, Vial, and Lackey, your tools are mostly uncounterable (stifle is a problem, but luckily not many run it). There are a lot of interesting goblins out there, so there are few threats that we can't deal with, and all of those problems can be reduced with a well built sideboard.   It seems like a pile of overcosted not-brainstorm cards, but in reality it's more like a pile of uncounterable vintage staples. I think the lack of counter magic is what stops the deck from being absurd (unfortunately there's no viable way to incorporate countermagic due to need for a high goblin count). Matron = Demonic Tutor, Ringleader = Ancestral Recall, Warchief and Vial provide unfair amounts of free mana. You can clean house with Sharpshooter - not many decks boast a one-sided board wipe. There's even combo potential if you want to run Kiki-Jiki (a 1-of resto angel is a reasonable splash, or you can do the full goblin combo with skirk prospector and lightning crafter). You also have access to an uncounterable Jester's Cap stapled to a 5/3 (Earwig Squad), which can be devastating especially against combo. Lackey into Warchief + Earwig is a turn 2 storm killer. There's many more good picks for the deck's flex spots that enable you to solve whatever your meta presents to you.   Also, note that you don't always pay full cost of cards. Your dudes cost 1 less often times, and half the time are flat out free. Some of us are running a 1-of Grenzo, and if you've never seen that guy hit a goblin or two (you often have a few extra mana to spend on your opponent's EoT) let me be the one to tell you that it's borderline cheating.  I won't lie to you and say that it's a top tier deck. It's not. I do believe it's a relatively competitive choice with the right build and ample experience though. Sure you usually get smashed by combo decks, but that's only a slice of the format and you can still beat combo half the time (I won 2 of my last 5 omni-tell matchups, and beat painter 2-0 when I was last matched against it. not great but not hopeless).   The deck preys on anyone who thinks they get to play fair magic. Goblins has insane card advantage, rivaled only by Shardless BUG or something with a recurring engine like Lands. It eats Miracles for breakfast, and that's arguably the top deck in the format.  Most of all, the deck is plain fun. Nothing beats flipping 4 goblins off a Ringleader, slamming them into play, and killing your opponent while they're holding a handful of useless counterspells. The deck is a grindy midrange sort of deck, but it can flip the switch to aggro mode in an instant. It's very skill testing, and highly satisfying when you start to learn all the little lines to play around popular strategies in the format.   TL;DR - flexible, uncounterable, card advantage, explosive damage/surprise kills, and pretty much as fun as it gets in magic. combo and certain enchantments are problematic, but that's shored up in the sideboard."

MTGLegacy,3bkd93,everial,1 point,Tue Jun 30 12:21:30 2015 UTC,do you have a list you'd recommend for new goblins players?
MTGLegacy,3bkd93,goblinpiledriver,3,Wed Jul 1 02:54:15 2015 UTC,"This is my current list:     4 lackey 4 piledriver 4 warchief 4 matron 4 ringleader 2 stingscourger 1 grenzo, dungeon warden 1 skirk prospector 1 sharpshooter 1 lightning crafter 1 earwig squad 1 tuktuk scrapper 1 tin street hooligan 1 Kiki-jiki 1 gem palm incinerator    2 Tarfire    4 aether vial    4 cavern of souls 4 wasteland 3 rishadan port 4 arid mesa 2 wooded foothills 3 mountain 1 badlands 1 plateau 1 taiga    SIDE 3 Krosan grip 3 pyroblast 2 pyrokinesis 2 relic of progenitus 2 chalice of the void 1 ethersworn canonist 1 rest in peace 1 warren weirding    several of these card choices are personal preferences and don't need to be there, especially if you're just learning the deck. These include lightning crafter, Kiki jiki, and the number of color splashes that I run. Usually 1 or 2 extra colors will do. You'd be fine dropping white for different sideboard slots (more chalices would be good). In place of crafter and Kiki, a couple Mogg war marshal or even a chieftain are nice to have around. It's mostly meta dependent. For example, if there's a ton of BUG lists in your area, main board Krenko might be a good idea.   Also grenzo is not a normal choice but I'd recommend him to everyone as long as you understand not to prioritize him. He's more of a backup value plan for your excess mana rather than your plan A. He's solid against terminus and clique too"
MTGLegacy,3bkd93,everial,2,Wed Jul 1 17:03:36 2015 UTC,"Thanks for sharing! Couple of questions, since the list differs from some of the others I've seen floating around lately:   why the full four Piledrivers? It seems people are often dropping to 2 and Matron/Ringleader-ing them up when in a good position. 3x Port is a concession to the splashes? Or would you also play 3 with only one splash? This list skips the Thalias (main or board) - what do you think of it?  Crafter is for D&T/Maverick/Delver decks? Seems like Sharpshooter would be better against Elves.  What is Warren Weirding handling that Stingscourger doesn't? I haven't seen Sphinx/Inkwell/Akroma around in quite some time, so I'm not sure what you're hitting with it other than Progenitus (which also seems to have fallen out of favor in Elves)."
MTGLegacy,3bkd93,goblinpiledriver,2,Thu Jul 2 04:42:57 2015 UTC,"Well, with less piledrivers it's more likely that you'll run out of them. It's also more likely that you won't have access to one when you need it. Also, they're great at soaking up removal from more important things like warchief. 3 is and ok number but I personally prefer the full 4. Additionally, with 2 or less you lose the ability to race combo effectively. It's not so much the splashes as I just wanted an extra fetch for access to red sources, which incidentally helps out with splash colors. I found myself in too many situations where I needed actual red to pyroblast or Tarfire and only had caverns and colorless lands. Thalia is strong, but I think people have mostly learned to play around her too well I do have sharpshooter in there. Crafter is for killing anyone, I suppose. He enables the combo if you ever happen to assemble it. It's also a mainboard out to Moat and other things that stop attacks. Also the value you get from championing a matron or ringleader is sweet. Iona naming red and also progenitus. However, it's good against any goyf deck or even just creature strategies like elves and d&t. you don't have to take down a huge creature for it to be useful. Also is another thing to help a turn 1 lackey through."

MTGLegacy,3bkd93,steve2112rush,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:33:25 2015 UTC,That's kind of what I thought. When I get off of work I can go into further detail.
MTGLegacy,3bkd93,OlafForkbeard,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:37:09 2015 UTC,"depends on the matchup, but in general:  look for a hand with lackey or vial. Vial is the stronger of the two, but with a cavern the lackey opening can be real good especially when paired with something to clear the path like tarfire or stingscourger. If you run Grenzo, he is also a viable enabler if you cannot find a vial or lackey.   beyond one of those enablers, try to get a good balance of action spells. If all you have to follow up your vial/lackey is a skirk prospector, you're not going to be doing much of anything. You want a couple things like warchief, matron, piledriver, etc. Even just a lone matron or ringleader is serviceable.   In general, when using matron and you aren't fishing up a specific answer (such as a hooligan/scrapper to destroy a problematic equipment), you want to grab ringleader if your hand is sparse (3 or less action spells), or warchief if you need to start dropping things. I usually say when in doubt, go ringleader. Also, matron into matron just to get a dude out and stall your real choice is okay to do.   However, many matchups will warrant pre-emptive matrons. For example, against death&taxes or stoneblade, you want to matron to get your artifact removal as fast as possible, because you're nearly guaranteed to see a jitte or the like at some point. You can't allow jitte or sword of fire and ice to stay around, and batterskull is pretty rough too. Against Elves and Grixis Pyro, getting a sharpshooter in hand quickly is a solid plan (tip for sharpshooter: try to vial/cast it when you already have a warchief out so that you don't open it up to dying before using it). Grenzo, if you run him, and Ringleader are great to grab against Miracles (be sure to look at your opponent's face when they read grenzo). Of course the artifact removers are great against MUD and painter as well.   edit: also, matron for stingscourger against any griselbrand/emrakul/etc deck, and if possible keep a vial on 2 for the instant speed bounce. If you're not playing this matchup, vial should stay on 3 until you need it to go to 4 for a ringleader or another 4 drop."
MTGLegacy,3bkd93,steve2112rush,2,Tue Jun 30 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"Jim Davis and Max Tietze videos. Those two are/were just stone cold masters of the deck.   The problem is that the videos are all pretty old, and the meta has obviously changed since those tournaments with a meta more hostile to Goblins.   As others have said Goblins have Ringleaders and Matrons which are nice, but all the other decks have Brainstorm/Ponder/Preordain/Dig. Where they can find literally any card in their deck, we can only find Goblins, and most of the Goblins (read all) are pretty bad. Our threats are outclassed and overcosted compared to everything else, so even in fair matchups, you're a massive dog. Oh and True Name exists so as a Goblins player you get double the fun of playing against it and effects that deal with it, which is always a blast! /s  TLDR: Don't waste your time. The deck is heaps of fun to both play and to pilot, but it's dead in the water. My Goblins deck is still sleeved up but it's just gathering dust. If we ever get Recruiter, the deck will become much better and actually become playable again, although you'll still never be able to reliably beat a Combo Deck :/.

MTGLegacy,3blku7,Cdub_surf,9,Tue Jun 30 05:15:50 2015 UTC,"I'd keep an eye out for Day's Undoing. Blue MUD and legacy affinity with this toy can break some faces.   Vryn Wingmare will probably find a slot in DnT, and Hallowed Moonlight looks promising for anyone who runs white.   Burn got some toys to play with, but nothing spectacular.   Elves got a new elf who deals some damage with an ETB trigger. Too weak for a combo kill, but decent enough to at least try.    The new thopter enchantment looks cool. I'm sure some brewers will find ways to exploit it."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Ozy-dead,5,Tue Jun 30 11:51:31 2015 UTC,Hallowed Moonlight is just worse than Containment Priest.

MTGLegacy,3blku7,pi-i-e,3,Wed Jul 1 21:34:54 2015 UTC,"Think the are several that are interesting to at least try out; Molten Vortex, Hallowed Moonlight, Goblin Glory Chaser, Infinite Obliteration, Vryn Wingmare, Exquisite Firecraft, Shaman of the Pack, Day's Undoing.  Most of them will probably be duds, but they're interesting enough to test. And then I think Thopter Spy Network might be something of a sleeper as a one-off in a suitably controlly list. If the game is grindy enough that card is insane."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,cach-e,2,Tue Jun 30 10:21:47 2015 UTC,I think the only easy-include is Hallowed Moonlight. It's a Containment Priest that cantrips and kills Batterskull.    The only other thing I can see is Day's Undoing if someone breaks it.

MTGLegacy,3blku7,Noxwalrus,2,Wed Jul 1 07:35:29 2015 UTC,"At a cmc of five, I personally doubt it will see much play. If you trigger spell mastery, sure, then it was a demonic tutor, but it's much more susceptible to soft-counters as it makes it harder to play around them with a higher initial cmc.  Sure, some people will use it as a budget option and yes, if it resolves it's strictly better than grim, but as is, you have to play quite an amount of hand disruption for it to be a valid choice.   Nonetheless, it will be fabulous to experiment with :3  Okay quick edit: I'll just preorder a playset and have in case :p"
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Tvox,2,Wed Jul 1 14:36:30 2015 UTC,I can't think of any situation where I wanted to cast Grim Tutor and I had 5 or more mana I could afford to invest into it without being susceptible to Spell Pierce.
MTGLegacy,3blku7,milesrout,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:41:23 2015 UTC,"I mean, you generally lose the game any way if you haven't cleared the way for an infernal tutor and it gets countered. It really shouldn't be any more difficult to clear the way for this. Yes, playing around spell pierce is harder, but with 1 or 2 in the deck it probably won't be that bad."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Noxwalrus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:41:44 2015 UTC,"This isn't nearly as flexible as grim tutor for post board games. It's not that uncommon to use the grim tutor to grab a one of sideboard card, like a rebuild or massacre to set up for a win on your next turn. A play like that with dark petition would almost always require you to waste a ritual first, which isn't great.  And even though a lot of people (myself included) have moved ad nauseam from the main to the sideboard, you absolutely cannot play ad nauseam along with dark petition."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Canas123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:49:56 2015 UTC,"Yes sb flexibility is worse, but dark petition can absolutely be played with ad Naus. Grim tutor is 6 life if you hit and cast it off ad Naus where petition is only 5. And people have run and had success with up to 3 ad Naus in the main deck. Pre PiF, 2 ad Naus was fairly common. It's a bit more dangerous, but you lose less life than grim tutor and it costs less mana over all."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Noxwalrus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 13:57:04 2015 UTC,"That assumes you're casting the grim tutor/dark petition. While a tutor is what you're most often looking for, sometimes you're just looking for mana or a LED and already have an infernal tutor, so dark petition will end up being more damage in that situation.  Not to mention that dark petition also gets hosed by graveyard hate, which people are already bringing in anyway.  I'll probably try the card once origins hits, but I strongly doubt it'll end up replacing grim tutor."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Canas123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 14:07:01 2015 UTC,"It only really gets hosed by mass gy hate, and with PiF being the primary win con that's already kinda difficult any way. For a deathrite shaman to keep you below 2 instant/sorcery cards the entire game is basically impossible. And if you need an LED, then finding dark petition solves that problem as you now no longer need LED. In the cases where you just need mana, the deck has so much of it that flipping a 5 drop off the top first thing is hardly going stop you from still flipping into a ritual or 2."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Noxwalrus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:07:58 2015 UTC,"You also completely ignored the fact that 2-3 ad naus, tendrils, 0-1 IGG was a decently common setup. Adding a single 5 drop brings the average cmc up from like 1.3 to 1.5. If you're super worried about it, then pull a cabal ritual or 2 for chrome mox. It's not like the deck can't be tweaked to accommodate another demonic tutor with slight restrictions."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Noxwalrus,1 point,Thu Jul 2 15:18:45 2015 UTC,"Cutting cabal rituals for chrome moxes sounds like just about the worst thing I can imagine. Chrome mox is a truly awful card.  And sure, it's probably possible to run dark petition along with ad nauseam, it just makes ad nauseam worse than it already is, which is pretty fucking poor.  As far as graveyard hate goes, deathrite shaman doesn't do too much, and will certainly not be able to prevent spell mastery. Rest in peace, tormod's crypt, nihil spellbomb all see play and they all make dark petition a completely dead card.  I'm not arguing that dark petition isn't better during the combo turn in game 1, because it quite clearly is, but you play more game 2 and 3's than you do game 1's, and grim tutor is usually a lot more flexible in those games."
MTGLegacy,3blku7,Canas123,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:10:41 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying chrome mox is good, but I'm simply pointing out ways the deck might adapt. Just as the deck adapted to include more green for abrupt decay despite making the mana weaker. Same as incorporating red for PiF over IGG, or how recently people have been adding more Tendrils/PiF in the absence of ad naus. The deck is very flexible and I think making the minimal alterations needed to add another 2 mana tutor seem well worth it.  Also, RiP, tormods crypt, etc all make PiF a dead card too, yet we've seen people cutting ad naus because it's so damn easy to just decay a RiP and combo any way. All of your arguments against Dark Petition are already weaknesses the deck has and ways that people attack the ANT game plan, yet ANT still is successful against them."

MTGLegacy,3biqqg,PucaTim,5,Mon Jun 29 22:04:38 2015 UTC,Isn't the biggest strength of Lands that EVERYTHING relevant can come back from the yard?  If this gets decayed or dredged then you can't get it back so I don't see it being that great in that particular deck.

MTGLegacy,3biqqg,motorcityguitarist,-1,Mon Jun 29 20:20:34 2015 UTC,It seems like a close to strictly worse replacement to Seismic Assault.
MTGLegacy,3biqqg,recreational,5,Tue Jun 30 03:30:06 2015 UTC,close to strictly worse   Just like Lightning Bolt is 'close to strictly worse' than Carbonize? Please learn what 'strictly worse' means: this card costs R and Seismic Assault costs RRR.
MTGLegacy,3biqqg,rifter5000,-2,Tue Jun 30 09:31:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree it's definitely worse than Punishing Fire and worse than Seismic Assault, but it's not strictly worse that's all.

MTGLegacy,3biqqg,batvanvaiych,2,Tue Jun 30 03:27:53 2015 UTC,"Pushing it up to 4 damage for 3 mana, when lots of spells currently work at 2 mana for 4 damage (like Boros Charm.)

MTGLegacy,3biqqg,Derpalisk,4,Tue Jun 30 04:25:12 2015 UTC,"I was thinking it replaces punishing fire...replace all of them with 4 of these.  replace the 4 groves with 2 more duals and have enough room to mainboard both karakas, bog.  obvious downfall, you cant dredge into this.  just thinking out loud."

MTGLegacy,3biqqg,Kaono,7,Mon Jun 29 16:19:22 2015 UTC,"Yup, it can definitely replace seismic assualt for people still running it as anti-moon sideboard material but it won't replace any of the core cards in the deck.

MTGLegacy,3biqqg,InitialG,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:30:53 2015 UTC,But why replace seismic?  Two more mana up front for the effect for free just seems better.
MTGLegacy,3biqqg,Umezete,1 point,Mon Jun 29 16:34:18 2015 UTC,"Mostly because seismic is miserable to try and resolve without a moon out. Just to be clear I don't think it's a much of an actual upgrade card for card outside of 1cmc but I do think it's a more versatile option because it's actually playable in matchups like delver, elves, or non-imperial taxes where seismic assault is too difficult to cast.  I don't think the cost having a red tacked on to it is a big enough drawback to outweigh 1 cmc and only needing a single red mana source. You are prorated for the first two activations anyways when comparing cost and if a moon is out chances are you have a lot of unusable red mana to work with. If you are just using it to pop creatures then 1-2 mana a turn isn't that bad if you can sustain loaming as well."
MTGLegacy,3biqqg,InitialG,1 point,Wed Jul 1 15:50:10 2015 UTC,"I think this has more use in Aggro-Loam than lands properly, but I think it is a reasonable sideboard card to increase the number of burn spells you have beyond a grip of punishing fires and to give you additional interaction against Moon and Taxes and other bloodmoon decks."

MTGLegacy,3bijrj,randomnickname99,9,Mon Jun 29 20:15:37 2015 UTC,So... doesn't this just make Delver decks and a handful of turn-1 combo decks absurd?
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Bobmuffins,2,Mon Jun 29 17:55:31 2015 UTC,"I see that Delver does get a boost from knowing the top, but I don't think I'm ever going to gamble 1 or more cards on ensuring a flip when I'm on the play.    For combo, the Scry 1 is pretty big, but again, nobody is going to gamble a card on that."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Krond,2,Mon Jun 29 20:36:56 2015 UTC,"Right, but mulligans in both those decks are inevitable. Obviously you won't go down a card to go up by half a card, but in situations where you would mulligan anyways...  Like, I guess my point is this is a massive power increase for Delver/Combo when compared to how much of a power increase it is for things like BGx or Burn."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Bobmuffins,5,Mon Jun 29 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does look like combo and Delver decks do gain more benefit from this than others.  But I'm not sure that it matters a whole lot.  Every deck is still gonna be thrilled to peep the top card on a mull to 6.  Each deck values things different already.  If Belcher or Dredge has to mulligan in a match today, it's arguably more crippling than if Jund has to mulligan.  As a Junk/Maverick player I am probably not gaining as much from this change as Delver, but I would still like to be able to Scry 1'on he mull, even if the cost is that their Scry 1 is ""better"" than mine."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Krond,7,Mon Jun 29 21:15:26 2015 UTC,As long as they make exceptions on the layout rules for Dredge and Elves we're ok.
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Saluton,3,Mon Jun 29 15:19:14 2015 UTC,"It seems like more of a guideline that is meant to cover most of the cases. Corner cases will probably be dealt with individually.  For example, it's doubtful that they will insist that Dryad Arbor always be placed in front of lands."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,mpaw975,2,Mon Jun 29 15:30:07 2015 UTC,It's that way on MTGO.
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Shocked439,2,Mon Jun 29 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"Don't they insist that right now? Putting Dryad Arbor with your forests is somewhat deceitful because it can trick your opponent into thinking that you have no creatures and attacking (say, with a young pyromancer or something).  I think LSV talked about this once in a Limited Resources - there's a specific Dryad Arbor artwork that looks exactly like a forest, so putting it with your lands can be very tricky (not in a good way)."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,GateOfSteiner,5,Mon Jun 29 16:53:20 2015 UTC,"In all the games I've watched, Elves players keep their Dryad Arbors with their lands, only bringing them to the front when they are attacking.  I'm not talking about hiding your Dryad Arbor in a stack of forests."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,mpaw975,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:37:49 2015 UTC,"Even if it's not intentional, Dryad Arbor (particularly the promo art) can cause confusing board states if it's with the lands. And maintaining a clear board state is important for both parties. I don't think it's actually enforced in any way, I just think it's something that should be enforced, and I thought that judges will generally tell you to separate them if they see you doing that (maybe not, I don't play a deck with Arbors)  I remember seeing a game on camera (SCG Open, I think?) where the opponent played a pyroclasm, killing all the creatures on the board, and they didn't realize that the dryad arbor was dead until the next turn when the opponent went to tap it.  If I play against anyone with a Dryad Arbor, though, I always get them to move it out of their lands. Some standard/draft players even put their elvish mystics with their forests, which at least is distinguishable because of the card frame, but is also kind of unacceptable imo."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,GateOfSteiner,-1,Mon Jun 29 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"I can see what you're getting at, but we can't force everyone to be nice and not try to trick us.  Headgames, and mentally checking your opponent is part of the game.  It's not like we say, ""hey, that Entomb for Griselbrand I just played means I'm playing reanimator.  If you have graveyard hate, you should cast that first or I will likely beat you.""  It's up to the opponent to figure that out.  If he hasn't played against reanimator, or if he's confused, then he will make a mistake that he will learn from.  Similarly, if they attack into Dryad Arbor, they're about to learn something, and likely will not do that again."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Krond,3,Mon Jun 29 19:54:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is a valid argument. Misrepresenting the board state is not the same as headgames. Your example is nowhere near analogous.  For example, if I tap my mana only 15-45 degrees, then it may be unclear how much mana I have available for an activated ability on board. While the opponent can obviously count through the cards you've cast this turn to figure it out, that doesn't mean that you are not at fault here. Clarifying the board state is your responsibility.  Similarly, what if i laid out my creatures so that every one is visible, except for one that is almost completely hidden beneath another creature? Is that mindgames or unclear board state?   Finally, there was a gp thing that happened recently where a player got thoughtseized, revealed his hand by spreading it out on the table, but completely hid his most important card by putting it directly beneath another card. Nobody noticed it at the time (not even the commentators). Is that mind games or unfair play?  I would argue all the examples I gave are unfair and should not happen."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,GateOfSteiner,2,Mon Jun 29 20:10:46 2015 UTC,"Putting a Dryad Arbor or Mana Dork near your lands is not necessarily misrepresenting the game state.  If it were, this would already be a big deal, which it clearly is not."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Krond,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:39:30 2015 UTC,"If it were, this would already be a big deal, which it clearly is not.   Clearly it is, hence the change."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,rifter5000,1 point,Tue Jun 30 08:29:19 2015 UTC,"I know, but my complaint with Dryad Arbor is that it makes board states less clear (same with putting dorks in the lands area, to a lesser extent).   My first example (tapping mana 45 degrees) is not misrepresenting the board state and people will not generally care, but it can cause misunderstandings that could be prevented and shouldn't really be considered as strategy. Nobody's going to be DQed for it if the intention isn't there, but it's still something that shouldn't happen imo.  The whole point of all these new layout changes is for clarity of board state. None of them are actually in any way illegal or a big deal."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,GateOfSteiner,2,Mon Jun 29 20:46:41 2015 UTC,"I keep it in the back with the rest of my lands, but separate from my forests. I also run the Future Sight Arbors so it's pretty easy to tell the difference anyways."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,yung_wolf,2,Mon Jun 29 17:54:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the future sight ones are pretty clearly creatures who are incidentally lands.

MTGLegacy,3bijrj,Cdub_surf,3,Mon Jun 29 14:59:38 2015 UTC,"I feel like the two decks that get the most out of the possible new mulligan rule (remember its still in testing) are Delver decks and Combo decks. Delver decks can more reliably set up a turn 1 Delver into flip and combo decks have a better chance of drawing a card they need to go off. However, as Delver decks have so few non-fetch mana sources it doesn't improve the chances of flipping delver as much as many are inclined to believe.  That said, I'm pretty sure we can all agree you'd rather have a decent 7 than a decent 6 + Scry 1."
MTGLegacy,3bijrj,gibbousm,2,Mon Jun 29 22:46:31 2015 UTC,"I tend to mull pretty aggressively, and having any sort of extra selection is good for me as an Elves player, so I'm a fan of this rule change."

It's also a lot worse than Thalia, so you don't cut Thalias for it, and the same anti-thalia hate that tends to show up for decks that are truly injured by her (massacre / dread of night / pyroclasm / golgari charm / marsh casualties) are just as effective against the Wingmare.

On the other hand, having both Thalia and the horse in play pretty much shuts down 90% of legacy.   If you decide that you want one or two, the problem becomes - what do you cut? DnT is a very fair and square list. You have maybe 8 slots (if you cut revokers and wisps), and there are a lot of cards competing for those slots. Consider these as a tradeoff:   1) Spirit of the lab. Our trump card against any blue deck. This guy + Thalia is game-ending.   2) Serra avenger. Delver is real, and we need to rule the skies. We also need a clock, and this guy is perfect for it.   3) Mirran Crusader. A clock that dodges half of removal and half of legacy-viable cretures? And he is nuts when you give him a Jitte.   4) Brimaz. Probably the most durable beater we've ever had - legendary, surives bolt, and leaves kitties behind to carry on the jitte's.   5) Leonin relic-warder. He is a must-have in the Omniscience meta, I can't imagine a current list w/o at least two in the main.   6) Containment priest in the maindeck. A list of cards that this guy shuts down is very long - natural order, GSZ and enemy vial are topping the list. And it's a 2/2 flash.   7) Aven Mindcensor. A flash flyer who shuts down an even longer list of legacy staples than containment priest. Mainly fetches and enemy mystics, trades with delver, great cost for effect ratio.   8) 4th Flickerwisp - this guy is the deck's swiss army knife. He can do too much, but sometimes his WW is taxing, and he is half as good w/o a vial.   9) 4th Revoker - maindeck answer to SDT, Lily, mox, DRS, Jace, Griselbrand and enemy Jitte? The only reason people consider cutting him is because currently he is a blank draw against Omni.   Now, do you really want a 5th Thalia at 3 cmc?"

MTGLegacy,3bj6tl,cebolladelanoche,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:35:36 2015 UTC,"I don't play DnT, but I have a good bit of experience from the other side of the table, so take this for what it's worth.  Being a guy who spends most of his time cantripping and playing broken cards, a taxing effect on turn 3 is a MASSIVE difference compared to the turn 2 Thalia comes down on. This is particularly important for a deck like Omnitell that overloads on cantrips and doesn't spend it's time doing much else on turn 2. It's also very relevant with Pyromancer decks running around, as you'll never be able to land him before the guy hits the table. On the draw, they'll have an entire turn to cast spells and shit out elementals without being taxed.  Another problem with the card is it's 1 toughness. My local metagame is particularly degenerate, so a friend of mine decided to play an exceptionally hatebear heavy DnT build with 4 Spirit of the Lab main, along with a few Glowriders I believe. The problem was that nearly every creature in the deck died to Marsh Casualties, Golgari Charm, Electrickery, Sulfur Elemental, Dread of Night, etc. So those efficient value spells that most decks run became ridiculous one sided boardwipes, and he got wrecked pretty hard by fair decks.  So it's definitely a powerful effect, and I'm sure there's room for the card in the deck somewhere, but don't overevaluate the card as being Thalia Ascendant, Smiter of Blue Players."
MTGLegacy,3bj6tl,TheScynic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:39:10 2015 UTC,"I imagine it would be meta dependent to an extent, and the kind of meta that has a lot of dedicated D&T hate running rampant is definitely going to catch Wingmare. My local meta does not have this problem. Plenty of decks have a sideboard Toxic Deluge or something, but it is not ridiculous like your meta sounds. I think a meta filled with combo decks (at least, the ones against which D&T fairs poorly) and mounds of dedicated sideboard hate is just not the place for D&T, and doesn't really reflect on Wingmate at all. You can't really build around your opponent having sideboard Golgari Charms. You just have to accept they exist, and play around them by not overextending.   I certainly don't think this card will be replacing Thalia (LOL), or be seeing play as a 4-of, but I'll be immediately testing two, and I think most lists will settle at 1-2 copies. Flying is huge in Legacy."
MTGLegacy,3bj6tl,TheBotherer,2,Mon Jun 29 19:35:53 2015 UTC,"Flying is definitely huge, and this guy carries equipment like a boss, that's for sure. My anecdote wasn't trying to describe why this card is bad, or what DnT experiences in an average metagame, only why running too many 1-toughness guys can be dangerous.   When you're cutting too many cards like Avenger, Crusader, and Brimaz for more dedicated ""hate"" cards, the deck loses a lot of it's potential in fighting fair matchups."
MTGLegacy,3bj6tl,TheScynic,1 point,Mon Jun 29 20:43:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I can't imagine what I want to cut for it. I have a hard enough time sideboarding out cards to get things like Containment Priest in most of the time!  Avengers seem like the first cut. Wingmare still trades with a Delver, though it's a slower clock. The difference in Vigilance v Tax effect is negligible, probably. Crusader stops Goyfs dead and is deadly with a weapon. Brimaz is likely the second option to cut for Wingmare, but like you say, it really helps in the fair matchups."
MTGLegacy,3biglg,c2232,3,Mon Jun 29 14:21:08 2015 UTC,Thanks for the report. Did Mystic Crusader see play during your tourney?

MTGLegacy,3bi1y0,KingJulien,1 point,Mon Jun 29 13:43:53 2015 UTC,"Also a good point I glossed over.  Only 1 Boseiju and no way to find it, and it only helps on Eureka.  Can be rough.  You can play force in Hypergenesis, you just has to build a little differently.  Maelstrom Wanderer, NIcol Bolas, and Progenitus all become much more important cards because they're also blue.  You can go 4 color and play Ardent Plea over Violent Outburst, but I've never liked that because your spirit guides work better with outburst."
MTGLegacy,3bi1y0,jeffderek,2,Mon Jun 29 13:49:41 2015 UTC,"You're correct that redundancy on legendary creatures is bad when you're trying to unload your hand, but I still think you should be playing more copies of Emrakul.  If you resolve Eureka and have two copies of Emrakul, it's not really a big deal, you know?  You've still got an Emrakul.  The planeswalkers I get not wanting multiples, but Emrakul is a special case. Instead of focusing so heavily on destroying whatever they put in (7 Angel of Despair effects plus all of your walkers and Terastodon?), I'd run a few things that give your guys haste.  [[Urabrask the Hidden]], [[Maelstrom Wanderer]], [[Akroma's Memorial]].  Then you get the first attack instead of them, which is nice. Sideboard if you want some creature hate I've always liked [[Shriekmaw]] and [[Dismember]] in those slots. Another sideboard consideration is Sneak Attack or Through the Breach.  I don't think they're necessary just pointing them out as things to consider for matchups where you would prefer not to cast Eureka.   From this list I'd probably cut Vraska, Karn, and 2 of the Angel effects for 2 more Emrakuls and 2 Haste Granters of your choice.  Memorial is probably the best because of Vigilance, but it doesn't do anything on it's own, so that's kind of hard to evaluate.  I'd also make sure I had some Dismembers in the sideboard so I could deal with Containment Priest or Canonist before turn 3."

I do feel you're right about the hast effects, though uncertain about redundant emrakuls. In previous builds with show and tell and eureka, I got badly hosed by people who had anticipated emrakuls and had real answers. Same with grislebrand. Dismember does seem like a hot sideboard option, thank you. Also note, that I'm in no way expecting to rely on the one boseiju. Obviously that's not really a plan. But the meta has been shifting away from force of late. Instead folks have been opting for more things such as daze or spell pierce. The spirit guides really shine against those sort."
MTGLegacy,3bi1y0,ImThePianoMan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:07:06 2015 UTC,"I can't run the lotus petals alongside cascade, as it invalidates that whole strategy.   even with 4 shardless agent, 4 show and tell, 1 prgenitus, 1 nicol bolas plansewalker, 4 force of will and 3 misdicrection... That's only a blue count of 17. I don't feel like pitch related counter-magic has a home alongside a cascade strategy.   I'm not saying I don't own or see the validity in the free counter magic, but it's either not effective alongside cascade due to costing too little or not reliable given the low blue count."

MTGLegacy,3bhzsp,Derpalisk,7,Mon Jun 29 11:25:56 2015 UTC,It isn't news that the game is decided by your opening hand while playing MUD. The deck is inconsistent without access to cantrips or card filtering so you have no way to fix your draws.
MTGLegacy,3bhzsp,Countertoplol,1 point,Mon Jun 29 11:55:45 2015 UTC,Thanks for the helpful response...  What should I want in my opening hand? Chalice on turn 1 every single game?
MTGLegacy,3bhzsp,bloodygripen,6,Mon Jun 29 13:18:24 2015 UTC,Either a 6 drop in 3 turns or chalice/trinisphere
MTGLegacy,3bhzsp,Countertoplol,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:22:42 2015 UTC,"Chalice turn 1 is obviously one of the most powerful plays your deck can make. Other than that, you need some other action like a lodestone, wurmcoil, metalworker etc. It also depends on the matchup, chalice 1 and trinisphere are much more backbreaking against certain decks."
MTGLegacy,3bhzsp,rich101682,5,Mon Jun 29 15:30:00 2015 UTC,"As a relatively new MUD player myself, here are the important things I've learned over the last few months:   When deciding whether to mulligan, I always think to myself ""Would a T1 Wasteland or discard spell wreck me?"" So many times I would keep a hand that looked like a monster only to have a T1 Wasteland or discard spell wreck everything. You don't necessarily have to mull to a chalice/3-ball hand, but if you have neither of those, the basic rule I have for keeping is ""Do I have ramp and a giant robot to ramp into?"" If you don't have both of those things, you might have a hard time. Lands? Good luck. Being so vulnerable to Loam/Wasteland lock is tough to get around. Tsabo's Web is a great friend. I haven't played the matchup much, but I've been wrecked each time. Don't be afraid to throw Chalice on 0 out there on the play, as cutting them off Mox Diamond can be huge. As someone above said, D&T is all about Swords to Plowshares. If you can Chalice on 1, you should be set. Against Delver, if you can resolve Wurmcoil Engine (usually with a big assist from Cavern of Souls), you've got a great shot at winning. I usually mull to either a Wurmcoil hand or a Chalice/Trinisphere hand. You'd have to have a really great reason to keep a hand with neither of those things. Jace the Mind Sculpter is a beating. Dack Fayden is just about game over. Phyrexian Revoker is a must out of the board. Speaking of, even more than knowing what to bring in out of the sideboard is knowing what to take out. In a deck with so many synergies, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to sideboard and can't think of what to take out of the deck. I don't know if it's correct, but I usually side out anywhere from 1-4 Forgemasters in a lot of lineups. And that makes Blightsteel cuttable too, since it's not often that you can hard-cast him.   I run 3 Ugins too and I feel like that's a great number.  Hope this helps!"

It also makes Ponder and Preordain exile their top card. Dig Through Time will also be a problem to cast as there aren't enough cards in their graveyard. So if omnishow wants to combo off, they need to have omniscience in hand or they probably can't win unless they remove it. I highly recommend you to try this card.

MUD should be tweaked to fit your local metagame. It is a deck that punishes you for playing the wrong threats. For example, if there is a lot of merfolk, storm and D&T decks present, you should avoid playing Sundering Titan in the main. On the other hand, if there are lots of Jund and Miracles decks around, Sundering Titan can win you games."

MTGLegacy,3bgk7h,brianandstuff,2,Mon Jun 29 01:07:31 2015 UTC,"Against Miracles, I always keep a hand with a (castable) Vial or Revoker. They're your best tools. If your hand is good but doesn't have them, it's not the end of the world, but you always want to have one if possible, especially Vial. I've mulliganed to six in search of one, but I wouldn't go lower. You need your cards for this matchup. Caverns also does nicely.   Priority number one is to get an equipment on the board, preferably Sword of Fire & Ice. Once that has happened, every single creature is a threat that requires an answer. Never overextend! You want to force them to use a Terminus on a single creature if possible. If you don't have at least one creature in hand at all times, you should be very aware of that fact that you will get wrecked by the next sweeper. The only times I want to have two creatures on board is if one is Mom (only if I have no equipment), or if one is Revoker, and they have any kind of blocker. Mom gets to beat down in this matchup.   Cataclysm is a great sideboard card against Miracles, but I've been switching off it lately. I found that I was never really able to get it to resolve. I'm playing a Kjeldoran Outpost in my sideboard instead for Miracles, which has been great. It's very hard for them to beat a 1/1 every turn, especially if you have any equipment on board.   You want to port them off white if you can. Porting off double white is important. You can't take them off blue, and red pre-sideboard does nothing. Post-sideboard I still go for the white, because Pyroclasm is just another sweeper, and if I'm playing correctly around Terminus, it shouldn't be a problem."

I know this is probably really vague, I'm just beginning to feel like there's some barrier with the deck I'm not breaking through. I've been playtesting against miracles a lot in preparation for the Seattle GP this November, and struggle quite a bit both pre and post board, which leads to frustration pretty often. When I trade decks with my testing partner, I lose almost every game, which is leading me to believe I'm playing some vital part of my role in that matchup (at DnT) poorly. Essentially, I'm looking to return to the absolute basics about the deck, and try to get a crash course in how it executes in game plan in popular matchups.

Miracles will really struggle to do much of anything if you resolve one of them against them.  That said, DnT is not favoured against miracles, and the tournament results reflect this.

As for your your list, I would personally cut Krenkos for Siege Gang Commanders, Chieftains for 2 Rabblemasters and the 4th Piledriver and 2 Mountains for the full 4 Ports, but that's just my personal preference.   As for Omnitell well.. you're playing Goblins. Not a whole lot you can do to interact with them lol. A fast start backed up with a Trinisphere ready for them when they cast Show and Tell is probably the best you can do, but it's not unbeatable for them."

It isn't necessary with the spy/flayer/troll kill, but they only require you to still have one dread return in your deck after sideboarding and getting deathrited, as opposed to 3."
MTGLegacy,3betsp,InkmothNexus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:04:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I forgot mulliganing isn't a possibility. I'll throw in the faerie instead.  Ashen Rider is an excellent idea, I saw him in a few boards but I wasn't sure why. Now that I see how well he works against Show and Tell decks, I'll definitely run some in my board.  Would you mind elaborating on why reshuffle effects are so powerful? I saw your match from last year's Eternal Weekend, but I wasn't sure why you boarded in Worldspine Wurm for the game 2 match.  Thanks for the tips, by the way."
MTGLegacy,3betsp,InkmothNexus,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:19:46 2015 UTC,"in addition to show and tell, rider is good against stuff like an ensnaring bridge or moat or whatever when the flayer kill isn't available.  I don't think I boarded in wurm during the feature match I had in that event. having the reshuffler primarily matters against painter, as it turns their ""I win"" into a ""you win"". It also does a little work against people trying to get fancy in the mirror by not targetting themselves with spy, or potentially even high tide when they're on a brain freeze line, which they might be just because such lines are easy against us. wurm is the best reshuffler because it's the best off a show and tell."

MTGLegacy,3betsp,MTGCardFetcher,2,Sun Jun 28 20:38:01 2015 UTC,"I really recommend stuff like [[Ashen Rider]] and [[Serra Avatar]] in the board.  Ashen Rider is a solid Show and Tell target that can exile Emrakul/Omniscience, etc.  Serra Avatar has a neat side trick of being able to either drop with S&T (if she's in hand) or drop Balustrade Spy (if she's in the library) and be able to combo off.  Sideboarding in Manaless is very meta-dependent.  [[Surgical Extraction]] is amazing for dealing with things that can ruin your day.  Cabal Therapy can remove threats from hand, but Surgical removes them post-Therapy for good.  That makes dealing with things like [[Trinisphere]] and [[Thalia, Guardian of Thraben]] much better.  I also personally like [[Mindbreak Trap]] in the board for dealing with Storm."

MTGLegacy,3beehi,Countertoplol,3,Sun Jun 28 14:03:12 2015 UTC,"Werewolf Stompy was my first Legacy deck. I eventually switched to the Goblin (Moggcatcher) build because I found that the ability to go wide with Rabblemaster and the ability to control the board with Siege-Gang Commander was very strong in my area. I also disliked the way my Werewolves rarely flipped -- my area is full of decks packed with cantrips. The ability to play uncounterable Magus of the Moon is pretty sweet, but it just wasn't worth having an unreliable kill package. Plus, I found that people were most often countering my hate cards, not my threats, so it was never all that useful.  If I were to make any changes to your build, I would do the following:   -2 Bonfire of the Damned, +2 Sudden Demise -4 Phyrexian Revoker, +2 Rakka Mar & +2 Koth of the Hammer (I'd still run Revokers in the sideboard, though) -2 Thundermaw Hellkite, +1 Lotus Petal OR Chrome Mox & +1 Koth of the Hammer -1 Zealous Conscripts, +1 Sudden Demise   If you have any question about my suggestions, feel free to ask. Another way you can help us help you is by telling us about your meta (i.e. what decks you think you will run into.)

MTGLegacy,3bdfbt,kona_worldwaker,5,Sun Jun 28 04:14:01 2015 UTC,"Here are a few tips about Dredge:   Don't be afraid to aggressively mulligan with Dredge. A hand without a dredger is generally unkeepable, and unlike most decks, you don't need a critical number of cards in hand to go off.  The key to winning with this deck is the ability to Dredge more than once in a single turn. I would recommend running a Griselbrand as a Dread Return target for this reason. He lets you dump your entire library in the dirt and win that turn. Just be sure not to deck yourself. Learn how Bridge from Below works. Don't swing a handful of zombies into your opponents blockers if they have <2 power or you will be sad.  Bridge triggers will not resolve if they get exiled before resolution. This means if you sac Narcomeaba to a Therapy and I bolt my Delver in response, no zombies for you. Lastly, I don't like Abrupt Decay in Dredge, since two Mana is actually a lot for a deck with 12 lands. I would run Nature's Claim and Chain of Vapor. This is purely just my preference, other people may advise otherwise.   Good luck and enjoy being the bogeyman!"

MTGLegacy,3bdfbt,Zarania,3,Tue Jun 30 14:31:52 2015 UTC,"Whenever a nontoken creature is put into your graveyard from the battlefield, if Bridge from Below is in your graveyard, put a 2/2 black Zombie creature token onto the battlefield.   This has what is known as an ""intervening if clause"" - they are in the form of ""trigger, if condition, do this"".  Some other examples are [[Test of Endurance]], evolve on cards like [[Experiment One]].  Relevant Comprehensive Rules text:   603.4. A triggered ability may read “When/Whenever/At [trigger event], if [condition], [effect].” When the trigger event occurs, the ability checks whether the stated condition is true. The ability  triggers only if it is; otherwise it does nothing. If the ability triggers, it checks the stated condition again as it resolves. If the condition isn’t true at that time, the ability is removed from the stack and does nothing. Note that this mirrors the check for legal targets. This rule is referred to as the “intervening ‘if’ clause” rule. (The word “if” has only its normal English meaning anywhere else in the text of a card; this rule only applies to an “if” that immediately follows a trigger condition.)  Example: Felidar Sovereign reads, “At the beginning of your upkeep, if you have 40 or more life, you win the game.” Its controller’s life total is checked as that player’s upkeep begins. If that player has 39 or less life, the ability doesn’t trigger at all. If that player has 40 or more life, the ability triggers and goes on the stack. As the ability resolves, that player’s life total is checked again. If that player has 39 or less life at this time, the ability is removed from the stack and has no effect. If that player has 40 or more life at this time, the ability resolves and that player wins the game"

However, here goes nothing:   In game 1, don't be afraid to overextend if you think you have lethal. You're velocity is almost unmatched in Legacy, which is what makes Dredge such a powerful mechanic. I've gone off T1 before, and it isn't as uncommon as one might think. The one exception to this is Miracles, because they can float a terminus and completely destroy your board presence as early as turn two. Don't be afraid to Cabal Therapy yourself on the first turn. If you don't have [[Faithless Looting]] or [[Careful Study]] and the ability to cast either, you can target yourself naming [[Golgari Grave-Troll]] or whatever dredger is in your hand. Prepare to lose a lot of sideboarded games. And I mean a lot. Even with LEDs, your win percentage G2 and G3 plummet. Does that mean you shouldn't play to your outs? No, but a lot of the time your G2s and G3s will be stolen from your opponent.

But as for that Boseiju land, once it hits, you get one last turn, maybe another if they show and tell in an Emrakul and pass again, but there's no real room to answer a Boseiju setup from the sideboard, it's just one of those things that can get you. Luckily they aren't a turn 1 combo deck so you hopefully can go off on your turn 3 or 4 and that can be right before they're going to."
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,Feline_o1,3,Sun Jun 28 00:32:21 2015 UTC,"If my draws are less than optimal, should I concentrate on being more passive and countering more preemptively, or being more aggressive and tapping out for the sake of digging deeper?"
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,Feline_o1,5,Sun Jun 28 00:41:46 2015 UTC,"play defensively until you know you have to go off, I always play the control deck 99% of the time, especially against other combo decks.  As long as they never go off, you will eventually just draw into your combo pieces and be able to go off without having to use draw spells to get to them."
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,rerek,2,Sun Jun 28 01:38:37 2015 UTC,"If you had two Wipe Away in your wishboard, would you consider boarding one in to bounce the Boseiju? The fact Boseiju comes into play tapped makes trying to buy a turn more attractive, right?"
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,Feline_o1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:09:58 2015 UTC,"I use to main deck 1 wipe away, but I don't anymore. That is an interesting Idea though, Wipe away maindeck almost always bought me a turn, it was awesome back then!"
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,chthon3573,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:35:48 2015 UTC,"Yes. I always played 2, as did many lists, exactly for that reason. The ability to board 1 in and still wish for one helps some matchups tremendously."
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,Apocrypha,4,Sun Jun 28 08:39:01 2015 UTC,"Ashen rider is probably a better show and tell counter creature. Your opponent would have to respond to the trigger when it enters and it can hit omniscience and emrakul.  That said, I don't think having a counter creature to drop is your best bet to win."
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,Apocrypha,2,Sat Jun 27 22:22:12 2015 UTC,"Good call on Ashen Rider, I think I'll pick one up. And I know what you mean, that's why I'm trying to explore other options, Right now Omni is the only deck I play that o blank out on so I'm trying to fix that ration"
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,rerek,4,Sat Jun 27 22:25:01 2015 UTC,Other mana intensive solutions: mindbreak trap or venser. Exile the spell instead of countering it. You can do it with 3 islands and high tide.
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,rerek,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:36:19 2015 UTC,Hmmm Mindbreak Trap is a great idea actually.. thanks!
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,Evilsqirrel,3,Sat Jun 27 22:39:43 2015 UTC,"If you are at the point of running otherwise unplayable cards as S&T targets, I suggest Iona. It is the hardest lock as it is not a trigger and I have to have the non-blue solution or an Emrakul already in-hand.   I can combo off in response to the trigger from Ashen Rider. So, you have to both have the Rider and be able to win the counter-fight afterwards.   It is a hard match-up for sure as many of the same hate cards hit both decks and you can not afford to run many of the solutions."
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,MTGCardFetcher,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:52:10 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight! I'm definitely gunna trst a bit more and consider Iona, both matches I lost today were as a result of having both Emrakul and Omni in hand, so I'll see what the rate of cantrip digging is, and if that's worth siding against"
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,rerek,1 point,Sat Jun 27 22:58:50 2015 UTC,"That is unusual. Most lists have one or two Emrakuls and four of both Omniscience and Cunning Wish. The plan is usually to go Show + Omni and then dig with cantrips for Wish which is for Eladamri's Call and then Emrakul.   Another option you might consider is board into V Clique to play in response to Show on the stack. You may be not able to counter a Show off of Boseiju, but you can try and fight a counter war over the Clique and if you win, you can take the Omniscience from their hand."
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,jeffderek,2,Sun Jun 28 00:08:45 2015 UTC,There's a list around here that runs [[Enter the Infinite]] and [[Release the Ants]]. It puts Emrakul on top and wins that way.

MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,chthon3573,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:16:04 2015 UTC,I think most lists still have the Release kill available. It has the advantage of winning at instant speed (you can win while the trigger from an O-Ring or Ashen Rider is on the stack). Its part of why I suggested Iona over Ashen Rider.   You usually save the Release kill for games where there is some reason to believe that fetching Emrakul won't be enough. Only on account of it taking more time in the match to execute.
MTGLegacy,3bcgdt,EvenStevenKeel,3,Sun Jun 28 05:05:27 2015 UTC,"In all seriousness: Go off before them.  If they're going off with Boseiju on turn 3 that means they only had 2 mana for cantripping to set things up, since Boseiju had to come into play tapped on turn 2.  It's not going to be super common that they find one of their 2 Boseijus, and one of their 4 Show and Tells, and an Omniscience, and an Emrakul or Cunning Wish.  Sure, it can happen, but focusing on that narrow set of circumstances to the point that you're siding in uncastables to put in off of Show and Tell for this matchup only?  That's overreacting to a small sample size worth of losses.  Depending on your list you should have some Flusterstorms.  Counter their setup spells aggressively if you're worried about Boseiju.  If the game goes a little longer remember that you can Turnabout their lands on upkeep to buy a turn.  If you're playing a list with only 3 candles, consider playing the 4th.  Most of your turn 3 kills are going to involve a Candle at some point, so increase your chances of finding one.    Yes, they're a faster combo deck than you.  Yes, faster combo decks are High Tide's worst matchup.  Don't let that make you warp your already limited sideboard space with crap like Iona or Keiga.  Speed up your game, counter their setup, rely on the fact that your deck is WAY more consistent than theirs is."

Iona has seen some play recently as well, as it does not lose to instant speed wins in response to the ashen rider trigger and cannot be trickbinded. Its not good against emrakul or griselbrand (sneak and show), but if you're just afraid of show and tell => omniscience, its definitely better than ashen rider."

Mindcensors aren't even that good - by turn three they're already not doing as much as you wish they would, and you can't ever bluff one. If D&T passes the turn with three mana up and cards in hand, especially if they have a Port in play that they don't use on the next upkeep, there's really not much else it could be. I'll be testing 1-2 in my deck. I think the full four is insane, but I'd be surprised if this card didn't merit inclusion at all."

MTGLegacy,3b6v9f,ilazul,2,Fri Jun 26 19:20:00 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it will go into DnT as the 3 mana spot is crowded among Flickerwisp (a necessary 3 or 4 of), Mirran Crusader (1 or 2), Brimaz, and sometimes Aven Mindcensor. I guess the Mindcensor would go?  A 2/1 for 3 is pretty bad. Flickerwisp usually saves a card or gives card advantage as a 3/1, Mirran and Brimaz are a house, so I think you'd compare it to the Mindcensor slot."

MTGLegacy,3b77uc,jeffderek,9,Fri Jun 26 15:39:01 2015 UTC,It's pretty niche though.  How many situations do you have enough elves to make this good and you're not able to come up with enough mana to green sun for Craterhoof?  That's gonna be pretty rare.
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,jeffderek,0,Fri Jun 26 17:03:03 2015 UTC,The capacity to tutor it up play it and burn for 5 then play it again the next turn for another 5 is certainly not niche or even that unlikely of a scenario for elves imo
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,randomnickname99,3,Sat Jun 27 18:36:57 2015 UTC,"So how many situations do you have 4 other elves in play and you have a Green Sun's Zenith and you can't generate 9 mana?  It happens, sure, but not as often as you might think.  And that example requires you to also have a Symbiote too.    It's not that I don't think you can invent scenarios where this would be good.  It's that this in most of those scenarios something else you already have in the deck can do just as well.  If you've got enough Symbiotes so you can replay this guy over and over, you could also just replay Visionary and draw a bunch of cards.  You have to balance ""How often will this card be better than what I already have"" with ""how often will I draw this when I'm not ready to kill them yet, and have a card that doesn't act as part of my engine?"".  Elves already plays a lot of cards that are dead at certain times, with the Craterhoofs and Glimpses that you can draw without support for them.  You're talking about playing another situationally good card that requires access to your splash color that doesn't actually solve a problem the elf deck has.  It's already got a ton of ways to win if it has 5 creatures on the board, it doesn't need another.  EDIT: Just out of curiosity, have you played Elves at all?"

MTGLegacy,3b77uc,pi-i-e,2,Mon Jun 29 17:06:35 2015 UTC,"True, though Chasm tends to come out a bit slower, so grinding them out with Deathrites at that point probably gets there much of the time. It just seems like there are too few situations where it's good enough to justify fitting it in an already fairly tight mainboard."
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,tumescentpie,1 point,Mon Jun 29 17:11:24 2015 UTC,"I would agree, although Punishing Fire is a decent card I've heard. I'll be testing it with 3 NO 1 Shaman for a little bit just to see if I like it. At the very least I'll pick up a copy to just have around, same as Packmaster."
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,TheScynic,2,Mon Jun 29 17:16:41 2015 UTC,"Shaman of the pack. I don't know about the ensnaring bridge, because as /u/TheScynic said you can just get a rec sage. I do know that if you are on the glimpse plan and pop this out, you might be able to kill your nearly kill your opponent without having to untap. Think of the wirewood symbiote."
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,tumescentpie,0,Fri Jun 26 20:51:17 2015 UTC,"If you're on a glimpse turn and have the resources to kill someone with this dude, you probably could've just cast NO/Hoof/GSZ for Hoof anyways."
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,TheScynic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:54:00 2015 UTC,"Because there are times when you glimpse and don't have NO, but do have GSZ. Also, if you draw this naturally you can cast it where you can't cast hoof."
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,tumescentpie,1 point,Fri Jun 26 20:55:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but just drawing this doesn't actually do that much. Pretty much every card in the deck is a combo piece (Glimpse, NO, Hoof), or an enabler for the combo. This is kinda trying to be both, where technically it's a combo piece (but you need quite a few resources to actually kill someone with it), and technically it can be an enabler (relatively easy to cast, triggers Glimpse, taps for mana, etc). It's just not very good at being either. The general utility of just being able to grind your opponent out (look how strong Visionary + Symbiote is) might make it worth it, but I'm not optimistic."
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,TheScynic,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:08:29 2015 UTC,Drawing this is like visionary with symbiote. It isn't bad to play.
MTGLegacy,3b77uc,sagreensabre,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"Visionary is 2 mana, and draws you a card. Much better than 3 mana for 3-4 damage."

MTGLegacy,3b77uc,SarahPMe,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:26:45 2015 UTC,"There are very few situations where you're not able to attack for the win with Elves (Moat and Bridge are played very rarely, and answerable via Rec Sage anyways), so that utility is marginal at best.  And I don't even know what to make of your second statement. Not only could GSZ for this guy be countered just as easily, what fucking Elves deck plays Cavern? And even if they did, they'd just counter it the second time you played him, since you have to cast him at least twice to kill someone in most situations."

You're determining the pace of play and being extremely proactive. I don't want to spend a turn (and card) in perhaps messing with my opponent. I would rather spend that mana and card on looting or putrid imp."
MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,Hydrogoose,2,Fri Jun 26 18:13:44 2015 UTC,Why?   Its a narrow card that's only good in Tempo decks. Dredge isn't a tempo deck. Its a Combo/Aggro/Attrition deck.
MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,gibbousm,1 point,Sat Jun 27 01:17:22 2015 UTC,"So...if it's not in your opening hand, you pretty much won't see it.  And you're cutting what, exactly, to run stifle? Dredgers? Actual cards that fill up the yard like breakthrough and faithless looting?  I'm usually the guy coming up with these ideas, not pouring cold water on them, but I hope you brought some dry clothes!  You're not on a mana denial plan. Spending mana stifling a fetch is not where you want to be.  Stifling a bridge trigger is...cute, I guess.  Stifling a storm trigger? Uhhh, yeah, stifle is a good card against storm in general, but your storm matchup should be just fine as it is. Don't dilute your deck to bolster that matchup.  ""Stifle is a good card"" /= ""I need to play stifle"""

MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,Honore_de_Ball_Sack,2,Fri Jun 26 17:56:14 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. The answer to these questions is almost always: Test it and see what happens.  I've tested weird stuff that went fine too, and it was fun at the very least.  It's just...I mean...I said it already, but you're not even going to see the card other than to flip it over the majority of the time. Plus, then your opponent knows about it and can play around it.  You sure as hell shouldn't mull to it, so...enjoy the VERY occasional blowout, I guess?"

There is actually more room than most people care to admit in a dredge deck. 1-2 golgari thugs can be cut, 1 dread return is more than enough in most cases, mainboard fatty or FKZ is not necessary depending on player preference, 3 ichorids is usually just fine instead of 4, same goes for the imps. There is room to play with for sure."

I find that mainboard Iona is a game winner in those games where you find minimal resources to get a beatdown going and it requires less resources than FKZ to win the game (FKZ can win that turn, but requires multiple bridges, narcs/imps, and dread return, where as iona requires a number less of these and basically wins the game by coming into play - although not the turn she comes into play)."
MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,Hydrogoose,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"If I were to play a fatty, it would be Iona.  I only played the deck for a few months,  but I've been meaning to sleeve it up again.

MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,milesrout,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:28:53 2015 UTC,GGT is susceptible to removal and combo decks that are going to go off the next turn. Iona deals with these problems.
MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,branewalker,2,Fri Jun 26 18:30:25 2015 UTC,"It's not that the GGT kills them, it's that if I'm at the point in a game where I'm casting Dread Return, I'm probably already in a winning board position.  I only run 1 DR main; I really don't play Dredge as a Dread Return deck, just my personal style.  I say again, if you do want to add a fatty Iona is your best option. I also haven't played in this Omni meta, Iona might be better now than she was."

Quite often they're games where I would just have maybe 3-5 zombie tokens and I never quite feel like they're a decent clock against a lot of decks (especially if my opponent can gum up the board with Goyfs or Mongooses etc). I may just win the vast majority of those games via being able to grind out with Ichorids, but I'm not sure.   Being able to stop the decks running Lightning Bolt/Punishing Fire/any other piece of burn from just doming you seems quite valuable. Although if I were to be perfectly honest, that has only happened a few times to me.   But yer, I certainly agree with the sentiment that if you can manage to resolve a DR, you're likely not behind."

MTGLegacy,3b7t0y,milesrout,1 point,Fri Jun 26 22:14:24 2015 UTC,"Because it's not true in Vintage dredge. You have Bazaar to draw/filter cards and pitch dredgers in the early game, before you transition to the replace-every-draw plan.  To be fair, it's not entirely true of LED dredge in Legacy either, but the namesake card does empty your hand, in a way that Bazaar does not."

MTGLegacy,3b47t7,MTGCardFetcher,8,Thu Jun 25 22:19:14 2015 UTC,"It certainly has almost no recent success at large tournaments. Conventional wisdom is that it's been pushed out of the format by Batterskull and Terminus on one end, and fast combo on the other. I think the fast combo weakness has improved recently with the printing of Eidolon of the Great Revel and the shift towards turn-3/4-ish combo like ANT and Omnitell, which are at least possible to race.  About your list - I think it would benefit from a decision about how you want to beat fair blue decks: be very fast and race them before their card quality engines take over the game, or beat them by overloading their low number of removal spells with an endless wave of bigger creatures in the midgame. Your deck right now appears to be set up in the second mode. If that's what you want, I would look really hard at whether you can incorporate Knight of the Reliquary and Punishing Fire/Grove, so your long game is much stronger. At that point you're basically playing Punishing Maverick. Loam Lion is an example of a card that fits that strategy poorly and could be cut.  If you prefer the blazing-fast route, something more like Goblin Guide and Eidolon would be better, along with cutting Swords and Green Sun's Zenith, and adding burst kill potential like Ghor-Clan Rampager or even a Fireblast. You would be relying on your 4x Thalia and 4x Eidolon to interact with combo long enough to kill them on turn 4 or 5.  I would definitely add at least one Sylvan Library either way. Not a fan of red blasts - I think in Zoo you're better off tapping out and presenting a very fast clock, relying on your hatebears to interact with the stack (but I'm biased towards the more aggressive variants)."

MTGLegacy,3b47t7,syntaxr,7,Thu Jun 25 21:29:02 2015 UTC,"I believe I'm the last person to Top 8 an SCG Legacy Open with Zoo at Seattle in October 2013, losing to Jacob Wilson in the quarterfinals. That was, incidentally, the last time I played Zoo, because the release of True-Name Nemesis soon afterwards pushed me away.  In my opinion, the list I played naturally had a very good against midrange and tribal decks, and I was able to configure it to be solid against combo and hard control decks like Miracles. However, the release of TNN meant that one of our most favorable matchups (Stoneblade/Deathblade) became much harder, and moreover, the rise of -1/-1 effects meant cards like Noble Hierarch and Sylvan Safekeeper became less reliable. I saw no incentive to continue along that path. I wouldn't be surprised if Big Zoo were still feasible, but I've since had success with other decks and haven't looked back.  If I were to reconfigure Zoo for today's meta, I would still keep most of the core intact, but I would definitely try to squeeze in a few copies of Council's Judgment, likely shaving a few copies of Swords to Plowshares."

MTGLegacy,3b47t7,lordofthepit23,3,Sat Jun 27 20:54:55 2015 UTC,"Zoo isn't very good right now. A couple people (including me) have been messing around with lists and so far I think that playing a hatebear-centric Zoo deck (some combination of Thalia/Eidolon/Spirit of the Labyrinth/Teeg/Canonist in the maindeck) is probably a good starting point for a Zoo deck these days.  In reference to your specific list though, I think Green Sun's Zenith is a little bit weak in the list unless you want to throw in a Gaddock Teeg in there. Paying an additional mana stings too (or 2 if you have Thalia in play).   If you're dead set on playing Red Blast in the main deck, switch them for Pyroblasts so at least you can get them in the graveyard for Lavamancer & Tarmogoyf. Swords to Plowshares also isn't the greatest if you are trying to race them. Path is probably better - yes it's worse with Thalia in play but STP can in all likelihood buy your opponent a couple turns too anyway.  EDIT: Here is the Zoo list I am probably going to take to my next weekly when I get a chance:  Creatures   4 Wild Nacatl 4 Kird Ape 4 Goblin Guide 4 Thalia, Guardian of Thraben 3 Ghor-Clan Rampager 3 Eidolon of the Great Revel 3 Gaddock Teeg 2 Grim Lavamancer 2 Qasali Pridemage 1 Ethersworn Canonist   Spells   4 Lightning Bolt 4 Path to Exile 2 Sylvan Library   Lands   4 Wooded Foothills 4 Windswept Heath 3 Arid Mesa 4 Taiga 4 Plateau 1 Savannah   Sideboard   3 Ethersworn Canonist 3 Pyroblast 3 Choke 2 Umezawa's Jitte 2 Krosan Grip 1 Sulfuric Vortex 1 Containment Priest   EDIT 2: I almost forgot, this guy went 7-2 at GP NJ with Zoo, though he scooped R9 to his opponent after he already won, so he didn't actually play in Day 2."
MTGLegacy,3b47t7,dafunkee,2,Thu Jun 25 21:11:30 2015 UTC,"Zoo is better than you might think, but your list has some issues. -You are not playing enough creatures, you are gonna want to play around 30 honestly. -Swords to Plowshares in an aggro deck is a nonbo. -Green Sun's Zenith only gets about half of the creatures in your deck. My buddies and I have actually had some success locally with a zoo deck that looks like this  4 Experiment One 4 Goblin Guide 4 Wild Nacatl 3 Kird Ape 2 Grim Lavamancer 4 Tarmogoyf 4 Burning-Tree Emissary 4 Thalia 4 Ghor-Clan Rampager  4 Chain Lightning 4 Lightning Bolt  1 Forest 1 Mountain 3 Arid Mesa 1 Horizon Canopy 2 Plateau 1 Savannah 2 Taiga 2 Wasteland 3 Windswept Heath 4 Wooded Foothills  Board 4 Ashen Rider 2 Krosan Grip 4 Mindbreak Trap 2 Surgical Extraction 3 Gaddock Teeg  The deck is very good against Delver, Blade, and the other fair midrange decks. It suffers against combo, but plays maindeck Thalia, which beats storm game 1, and plays a ton of dumb hate in the board. It's not a deck I would take to a GP, but it's fun to play at local legacy events."
MTGLegacy,3b47t7,griselbiscuit,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:11:41 2015 UTC,"You can play the deck, sure, but you're game plan of just casting creatures on the field and beating down as much as possible, in general, is a strategy in legacy that is going to lose a lot games for you. What do you do when an opponent plays Show and Tell then Omniscience? How about Terminus? Swords and lots of removal? Straight Zoo decks in legacy are just weak in general right now."
MTGLegacy,3b47t7,endlesswurm,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:08:45 2015 UTC,"Is Zoo any good in legacy?  -not really  Is Zoo viable in legacy?  Sure, although it tends to morph into stompy decks very easily."
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,PhilippSchoenegger,17,Wed Jun 24 07:16:32 2015 UTC,Play DDFT at every event. Just my opinion.
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,Countertoplol,3,Wed Jun 24 13:02:04 2015 UTC,I think my head would explode!
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,winglerw28,3,Wed Jun 24 13:29:47 2015 UTC,"Well miracles, lands and 12 post are just as mentally taxing! I could play DDFT at a grand prix but not miracles."
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,Countertoplol,4,Wed Jun 24 16:30:56 2015 UTC,"I suppose that can be true! My bias is that I actually feel Miracles to be the easiest of those three, and easier than DDFT, but a large part of that is my familiarity with the deck and the fact that it is easily the deck I've put the most time into in all of my magic-playing career.   My head doesn't work with combo, I simply don't comprehend the cantrip philosophy or general game sense required when piloting things like DDFT, or even just ANT or Omni-Show. I've been working on learning it, though!"
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,winglerw28,3,Wed Jun 24 16:37:05 2015 UTC,"Good, well explained article. I also like to see you've reevaluated your opinion on lands as a deck, and looked more at the results and less at what the established knowledge is. It's good to see that happen."

MTGLegacy,3axeqa,winglerw28,4,Wed Jun 24 16:08:32 2015 UTC,"Hey Philipp, thanks for the extensive primer. I agree with your take on the current best decks, and have started playing Omni-Tell.  With the standard list you reference, I'm strongly considering cutting the Impulse for a copy of Split Decision. This allows an instant speed kill through Cunning Wish > Firemind's Foresight > FF for Cunning Wish, Split Decision, Brainstorm > Cunning Wish, duplicate with Split Decision, get Release the Ants and Eldamri's Call > Eldamri's Call for Emrakul > Put Emrakul on top with Brainstorm > Release Ants.  I've already put this line together in games twice now to kill at instant speed in response to Ashen Rider, and winning at instant speed certainly has other applications. I know you're an advocate of consistency, and I'd like to hear your opinion on whether it's worth it to swap the cantrip (Impulse) for the Twincast (Split Decision)."
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,Azunjan,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:41:43 2015 UTC,"Hey, thank you very much!   Split decision is a very valid choice, agreed!   Greetings"
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,ilazul,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:53:27 2015 UTC,I like that Split Decision is also just always a counterspell when being used against other counterspells and that the opponent likely isn't going to want to use the copy mode when trying to resolve something like Dig Through Time sometimes.
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,ilazul,2,Thu Jun 25 13:44:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it does a great impression of Counterspell against other counterspells. Also love the ability to copy mine/their Dig Through Time for 2 mana."
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,ilazul,10,Thu Jun 25 13:48:33 2015 UTC,"I think that the general content of your article provides good information, but I think there are two glaring issues:   You need your editor to go through and clean this up quite a bit. There are several typos that, although clear what you intended, are basic fixes that should be caught prior to publishing. When speaking about your own opinions, you should express them in terms of ""I believe that <some fact> is true, and I feel that way because <explanation>"" rather than stating things in concrete terms. Strictly better literally means better in the most common game situations (thank you for the terminology correction, /u/Timiniel!) and is rarely the correct terminology to use - your assertion that you know these things for certain (even if you truly do) makes the text come across as somewhat arrogant, despite that not being the intention or truth (at least, I would hope)."

MTGLegacy,3axeqa,battousai555,3,Wed Jun 24 13:58:54 2015 UTC,"Hmm... a small issue here... Strictly better, in what relates to magic, does not mean 100% of the situations. It means 100% of the COMMON situations. If you are at 3 health and there's that RW minotaur that reflects damage in play with 1 damage, a shock is better than a bolt, but that doesn't make lightning bolt any less strictly better than shock."
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,wylatwork,2,Thu Jun 25 11:50:30 2015 UTC,"That is fair, I was typing it up quickly and generalized.  If you want to be highly technical, a card being strictly better is defined as having on of the following qualities over an otherwise identical card:   It is more powerful for the same cost (Lagonna-Band Trailblazer is strictly better than Yoked Ox for this reason). It provides an unrestricted version of the same effect for an identical or reduced cost (Lightning bolt is strictly better than Shard Volley for this reason). It is the same effect, but the cost is reduced (Control Magic is strictly better than Mind Control for this reason). The speed or interactivity of the card is improved (Boil is strictly better than Boiling Seas for this reason). The card is identical, but has an added ability or effect (Spell Burst is strictly better than Spell Blast for this reason).   It is just a pet peeve of mine, people tend to use the term ""strictly better"" all the time when comparing two totally different cards."

I've been playing it lately while letting shardless Bug take a break.  http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=84347  In some ways it uses similar tactics to DnT (but in my opinion isn't nearly as consistent or controlling) but plays very differently.
MTGLegacy,3axeqa,milesrout,3,Wed Jun 24 16:40:23 2015 UTC,"Hey,   it's a decent deck but I cannot think about the place in the metagame that this deck truely fills.

MTGLegacy,3axeqa,TheBotherer,2,Wed Jun 24 19:29:37 2015 UTC,"Hey,   I fear that Shardless isn't very well positioned right now as even Delver decks can now keep up with CA in the way of Dig Through Time.

MTGLegacy,3autvf,TheScynic,9,Tue Jun 23 18:09:24 2015 UTC,"Not going to lie, that was my first thought when I saw this card.  I'm super stoked to try it out.    It's also perfectly playable as a 1of in regular ANT if you were playing Grim Tutor before.  Grim Tutor is 6 damage off of Ad nauseam (assuming you cast it) and this is only 5.  If you were willing to cast Grim before, the 5 mana here shouldn't stop you that much.    That said I think it gives Grinding Station even more consistency, which I like."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,jeffderek,3,Tue Jun 23 18:20:04 2015 UTC,"You're probably right, especially considering people run around with a second AN on occasion and manage to not kill themselves. Still, I'd rather have the second or third Petition than an AN most of the time, I think."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,jeffderek,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:25:03 2015 UTC,"Still, I'd rather have the second or third Petition than an AN most of the time, I think.   I think that depends on how big graveyard hate is at any point in time.  Grinding Station really wants Past in Flames to be a consistent kill.  If graveyard hate becomes more prevalent than it is right now then Ad Nauseam becomes a lot more appealing.  But yeah, I really like this card and it would pull me away from Ad Naus pretty easily."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,Mirage08,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:35:31 2015 UTC,"I mean, you'll always have access to the AN in the board if you want, and MB grave hate is rarely a concern outside of DRS. Being on the Grinding Station gameplan game 1, then potentially boarding into a more lean ANT build is probably the safer option, and this card just makes that plan even more appealing."

MTGLegacy,3autvf,InkmothNexus,2,Tue Jun 23 19:37:41 2015 UTC,"See,  storm isn't a legacy archetype I play. I'm trying to learn more about it. I can't stand decks that are named after a specific card that don't use it. Personal preference,  I guess."

MTGLegacy,3autvf,InkmothNexus,4,Tue Jun 23 20:10:30 2015 UTC,I love silly names but naming a deck after a specific card that isn't in the deck just seems wrong. Imagine your Pox decks without a single Pox card.  ;)

MTGLegacy,3autvf,Maxtortion,2,Tue Jun 23 20:15:12 2015 UTC,"FWIW, the reason is because it's set up to play a very grindy game against decks packing a lot of countermagic.  The short version is that on your kill turn, you cast a lot of spells and your opponent counters a significant number of them. Then you just cast Tendrils or PiF from hand and kill them. Essentially, you're grinding through their countermagic."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,johhny-turbo,0,Tue Jun 23 20:21:00 2015 UTC,That's what I linked to?
MTGLegacy,3autvf,thetrueshyguy,3,Tue Jun 23 19:25:50 2015 UTC,"Its the silly name. Nobody outside of source Ant thread readers knows what grinding station is, much less why a familiar deck (storm) is suddenly named after a shitty card from the first Mirroden block. I don't care personally, but I don't use the name to save me time explaining."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,Maxtortion,3,Tue Jun 23 19:32:54 2015 UTC,"It's not a silly name, though the name it shares with the card does make it a bit more confusing.  The thing is, we need a new name. There are too many storm variants with fundamental differences to just call it Storm. It's not the same as ANT, and doesn't even play the namesake card.  We might as well call it by a name that's already common within the storm community, and let it spread from there. Legacy decknames almost never make sense, and yet they still manage to become commonplace eventually."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,RedeNElla,11,Tue Jun 23 19:41:35 2015 UTC,"Hey now, Legacy deck names totally make sense, you just need to know the backstory.   Take Tin Fins, for example. Tin Fins wins by reanimating Griselbrand or Emrakul and drawing a million cards, finishing with Tendrils if necessary. Okay, now there's this animated show that was on Cartoon Network from 2000-2005, and on the show there's this restaurant chain named Grizzlebee's, which sort of sounds like Griselbrand, and there's some kind of mechanical shark action figures that come with your meal there, and they have those deep-fried onion blossoms you see at the food vendors of country fairs, and... you know.   Okay, nevermind, it doesn't make any goddamn sense. But we like it that way!"
MTGLegacy,3autvf,Boleyn278,2,Tue Jun 23 20:04:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Tin Fins makes Grinding Station sound like a standard deck name."
MTGLegacy,3autvf,Boleyn278,4,Tue Jun 23 20:08:54 2015 UTC,"Surely you mean ""TinFins 3: Return of the Onion Burst""?"

And since it keeps coming up, Quicken + this card, is not a Solidarity idea, Quicken + Time Spiral would be better and that hasn't happened either."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,Feline_o1,9,Wed Jun 24 02:06:11 2015 UTC,"In Hightide, yeah, Timespiral is so so much stronger. I think this is a strong enough card to have a place in Legacy without being broken or fringe. We'll see. That said, I do respect that you are very good at magic the gathering."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,usumoio,2,Wed Jun 24 02:31:43 2015 UTC,"I think the deck that would want this is a deck that goes off at instant speed, making the end of turn clause almost irrelevant. You play it on your turn and go off immediately on their upkeep. That said, you'd need to really want Time Spiral copies 5-6 before you run this."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,tom_rorow,-1,Wed Jun 24 11:29:46 2015 UTC,Maybe if you ran Quicken in the Reset-Spiral version?  Just tossing out ideas.
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,Unconfidence,5,Wed Jun 24 09:29:24 2015 UTC,"Hahaha, I popped in here wondering ""what would Feline think?"". Any chance you could walk us through your thought process? Also, how about in Solidarity (where I think it might be stronger)?"
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,bunkoRtist,6,Wed Jun 24 09:39:57 2015 UTC,"The card just isn't strong enough overall, and Quicken + anything isn't that insane, noone even does Quicken + Time Spiral, so why Quicken + something weaker, I don't know, but a new card gets lots of attention I suppose."

MTGLegacy,3au8kk,FrugalityPays,24,Tue Jun 23 22:35:41 2015 UTC,This seems extremely powerful. Even in something as simple as Burn.

The original idea was to either cut misdirection and over load threats + reload or to cut Chancellor of the Tangle as he is the ""worst"" card in the list being not blue, only a ramp on turn 1, and not being the biggest fatty. Chancellor has really pulled his weight in my testing though."

Sure it's blue and allows faster kills, but games I went omni to Emrakul I would have won regardless.   I cut that for Chandler for a halfway spot in the form of a non legendary fatty and a decent turn 1 aid and I've never looked back.  I then found the deck could mull better and wanted to be faster with more fixing so I added gemstone to fill this spot by cutting some duals and a fetch."

I don't know what yet, but the idea of Time Walk-ing and then Timetwister-ing on the next turn seems fun.  But getting the Day's Undoing countered would be very bad on that extra turn."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,csnsc14320,10,Wed Jun 24 01:07:36 2015 UTC,This may have great legacy potential... U/R delver has a new card?
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,knucklebust,9,Tue Jun 23 15:48:09 2015 UTC,"The builds would need to be more mana-heavy than previous Boat-builds, but it looks interesting at least. I'm actually more interested in seeing it with combo.   From my understanding (please correct me if I'm wrong), if you would have triggers generated from the card, you would have an additional cleanup phase and get triggers (say, Underworld Dreams triggers from the opponent drawing). From there, players get an opportunity to cast again and pass priority, so with a combo that can win at instant-speed AND several effects that could generate triggers from this, it could be a draw7. Not sure how it would be built (if it could, assuming the rules is correct here), but it seems like a strong enough effect to build around.  Ninja edit: Rules from Time Stop  This seems to be a more clear description than my rambling.   If any triggered abilities do trigger during this process, they're put onto the stack during the cleanup step. If this happens, players will have a chance to cast spells and activate abilities, then there will be another cleanup step before the turn finally ends."

I'm going to hate this card when its like 4 am at prerelease"
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,Buddyboy451,2,Wed Jun 24 02:08:05 2015 UTC,"Also, burn with a blue splash?"
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,tumescentpie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:58:05 2015 UTC,"Agreed, grixis delver is the first thing I thought of.  Dump your hand on the board quickly then reload."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,randomnickname99,4,Tue Jun 23 19:57:40 2015 UTC,Sure it ends your turn but how bad is that when you are drawing into instants and free counterspells(daze and fow).
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,knucklebust,6,Tue Jun 23 20:02:35 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Do it after the attack phase when you were just gonna pass anyway.  The only issue I see is that it resets your delve, so drawing into a new dig through time isn't great."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,randomnickname99,2,Tue Jun 23 20:04:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's necessarily as good as dig, but could you replace? I see 2 digs usually."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,Derpalisk,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:29:48 2015 UTC,Yeah that might be an issue. Dig might just be a better card for that slot and the synergy isn't great.   I played 3 digs in grixis but I see lots with 2. I might try this as a one of along with 2 dig.
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,randomnickname99,3,Wed Jun 24 02:55:54 2015 UTC,Play it second main phase
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,tresle101,6,Tue Jun 23 20:59:03 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure it's worth the slot yet, but it's definitely got some potential as a wish target in TES. BW > DU is 3UR, which leaves a good bit of opportunity for a T1 play where you run out petals/LEDs/chrome moxen, then draw a fresh seven and be ahead on board, similar to how draw7s + moxen are used in Vintage."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,TheScynic,12,Tue Jun 23 18:08:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah vintage players know how brutal a T1 twister can be.  Imagine land, exploration, land, mox diamond,  dark ritual, days end.  You haven't played a thing, you're forced to take a new hand that you can't mulligan, and they start their next turn with 3 mana, an exploration and a full hand."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,randomnickname99,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:15:29 2015 UTC,And then you lose the Storm count from all those fast-mana sources.  I don't think this has a place in Storm. Perhaps in aggro strategies like Affinity.
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Wed Jun 24 02:17:14 2015 UTC,Yeah transitional storm definitely isn't the build for this.  But something like belcher could be.
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,randomnickname99,2,Wed Jun 24 02:57:51 2015 UTC,"Losing the storm count doesn't matter much when you just drew 7 new cards.   Traditional Draw7s are strong because A. they can be a storm engine, B. they're a symmetrical effect that allows you to recover, and C. you can get ahead by jamming fast permanent mana sources, then resetting your hand. This still does 2 of those 3 things, it's just not a storm engine anymore."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,TheScynic,1 point,Wed Jun 24 23:45:13 2015 UTC,And if your opponent counters the Day's Undoing? Now you're down cards.
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,ReallyForeverAlone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:37:59 2015 UTC,"If being counterable was the only redeemable quality of storm business spells (or any spell in magic, for that matter), we'd all be jamming Smiters and Abrupt Decays.  That's like saying Infernal Tutor is a bad card because if it gets countered, you have an empty hand and you're dead."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,TheScynic,0,Thu Jun 25 03:44:08 2015 UTC,"Infernal Tutor works because you can do stuff with the card you get, and thus up your storm count. Using fast mana just to draw a fresh 7 and end the turn isn't productive, especially considering that you now have n-less free cards that can contribute to your Storm count. The only situation I can see a Storm player casting it is if they're about to punt, and the opponent will know this, and counter it to let them punt. Also, this doesn't work with cards that care about cards in the yard, like Cabal Ritual and Rite of Flame. Your 2 mana rocks, Probe, Brainstorm, fetchland: all gone. When you could have had Threshold turn 2 you now have nothing."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,ReallyForeverAlone,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:30:24 2015 UTC,"I brought up IT as an example to point out how irrelevant counterability is, obviously IT is better than this card. This card has 2 uses, recovering from heavy discard from a deck like Jund, and functioning as pseudo card advantage by dropping mana rocks and drawing a fresh 7. As such, it's a clear BW target. Is it good enough to warrant play? Probably not, but acting like it's useless is just short-sighted."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,TheScynic,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:57:08 2015 UTC,And then you lose the Storm count from all those fast-mana sources.   That's okay - you're clearly not playing Storm if you've got mox diamonds and explorations.

MTGLegacy,3au8kk,yakushi12345,3,Wed Jun 24 03:04:12 2015 UTC,"Came here to mention affinity. It's already obviously broken in modern, but this is exactly the type of thing Legacy affinity may need to make a comeback. Dump entire hand - draw 7, 7 more robots next turn!"
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,Ozy-dead,1 point,Wed Jun 24 08:45:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Affinity isn't tossing cards into the yard like Burn and Delver so DTT isn't as much of an option."

MTGLegacy,3au8kk,CheddarOps,1 point,Fri Jun 26 01:51:27 2015 UTC,What about some new high tide variant that is looking to slow roll into one of these and then solidarity off on the opponent's next turn?
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,gwax,5,Tue Jun 23 23:53:40 2015 UTC,Dig through Time / Meditate / Time Spiral are better for the big draw stuff.

MTGLegacy,3au8kk,tumescentpie,6,Tue Jun 23 20:51:29 2015 UTC,"Countertop can eat a surprising amount of mana, giving the opponent a full hand and tapping low might allow them to resolve something thats annoying to deal with (library, liliana, even TNN), so why give them a chance?   Also Miracles doesnt play that well with pure card advantage since Entreat and Terminus in hand are not great."
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,stnikolauswagne,2,Tue Jun 23 21:37:30 2015 UTC,"For ANT, you spend the first few turns disrupting your opponent's hand and scultping your own so you can go off. Taking a random 7 AND refilling my opponent's hand is shit. But maybe other combo decks can do something with it."

MTGLegacy,3au8kk,randomnickname99,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:17:58 2015 UTC,"I might be pessimistic, but I can see it playing out like, turns 1-3 you dump your hand, they cast a couple of creatures or something, maybe counter one of your creatures. You cast this, maybe you draw 5 cards and they draw 2 (total), but now you both have full hands and ~3 mana, at which point midrange decks are going to be able to make more use of the cards they drew.  It could be pretty good against combo decks that are just trying to sculpt their hands with cantrips though, because you get to refuel and you mess their hand up a bunch? But 7 is a lot of cards"
MTGLegacy,3au8kk,oogaboogacaveman,0,Tue Jun 23 20:06:41 2015 UTC,"Imagine casting it turn 1. So, your opponent keeps a hand to play against you. You make him discard it and draw 7 random cards."

MTGLegacy,3avyic,Kurraga,2,Tue Jun 23 23:11:46 2015 UTC,So it still just plays like manaless? Would led dredge still be better ?
MTGLegacy,3avyic,InkmothNexus,5,Tue Jun 23 23:59:23 2015 UTC,this is an attempt to fit the blue and green manaless plans together. straight blue manaless and LED are probably preferable.
MTGLegacy,3avyic,dlmtg123,3,Wed Jun 24 01:14:25 2015 UTC,"LED I can lean in favor of.  Straight blue manaless, in my testing, actually falls short in some areas compared to my list.  It really comes down to what you are comfortable with playing as well.  I really enjoy my list and have put in a lot of hours with it.  I am very comfortable with it and the deep lines of play that can come out of it.  Anyone who wants to play any dredge list is cool in my book though!  ;)"
MTGLegacy,3avyic,InkmothNexus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:11:20 2015 UTC,"the list is interesting, but I disagree with certain parts of it. not running 4x chancellor main seems wrong, running kelpie over whirlpool rider with shoal in the 75 seems unnecessary, multiple dedicated(not even pitching)dread return targets seems like a lot, and that number next to ichorid appears to not be a 4. I have always found the bloodghast idea interesting though, especially in its ability to potentially do stuff through a thalia."
MTGLegacy,3avyic,dlmtg123,2,Wed Jun 24 02:26:54 2015 UTC,"You can pitch kelpie to shoal to counter FoW and Ad Nauseam. It may be possible to cut the zealot for a fourth Ichorid, but at times I feel like with the bloodghasts, The other Ichorid just isn't necessary as most of the time the bloodghasts will just be faster since you can get them into play the same turn they are dredged into the GY with a land in hand. I don't really know what to say about chancellor.  It's not even truly necessary in some regular manaless builds IMO, but I have had no interest in it at all with this particular list, and don't think I'd ever want it in this list.  The main reason I even started brewing this list was because of multiple losses to thalia lol.  Being able to just pay the extra one to cast a spell from your graveyard makes you not stone dead to a resolved thalia, like actual manaless dredge. appreciate the feedback!"
MTGLegacy,3avyic,InkmothNexus,2,Wed Jun 24 02:40:40 2015 UTC,"I find having the ability to counter rest in peace, or for that matter thalia, more often relevant than countering force, and attempting to counter ad naus feels bad, as most of the time they will be going for past in flames anyway. countering RiP, priest, or even the stray stoneforge, thalia, or teeg is much more likely to be relevant, as force only matters much against you when it's countering your counter on their hate piece, in which case another counter for the hate piece works as well as shoaling their force would be.  chancellor is necessary, in my opinion, as an answer to potential turn 1 discard spells or deathrites, in addition to slowing down other combo decks and being an easy thing to reanimate. they also make it substantially riskier for someone to cast show and tell against you. I've never run any maindeck nonblue nonchancellor targets except iona, and even that has felt unnecessary. the number of decks that can win through a full board, an empty hand, and 2-3 sphere of resistance effects when you pass turn doesn't feel like enough to warrant playing cards that are only necessary there and overkill elsewhere.  I've never found that manaless is dead to thalia, so much as it is dead to ""thalia and..."", where the second thing is an equipment of any kind usually, breaking bridges in some way or other. massive amounts of zombies can do the job of killing someone pretty well, thalia or no."
MTGLegacy,3avyic,dlmtg123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:52:10 2015 UTC,"DRS is easily played around with phantasmagorian and street wraith, which have much more value to me than the chancellor.  If someone is throwing their turn one DRS into a chancellor trigger, thats just insane on their part given a turn two DRS is still fine and throwing any other spell into the chancellor is correct.  Turn two Thalia is about as dead as I've ever felt playing manaless.  Certainly more things join her to kill you, yes, but thalia alone makes it very very very unlikely for you to even amass an army of zombies given you can't cast any spell and strictly depend on finding free creatures creatures and dodging path.  Granted, if you are running the green sideboard, you may get lucky and be able to pay for a spell or so with your SB forests.  I urge to you keep playing with your build though, if you like it. I am perfectly settled with my list as is currently."
MTGLegacy,3avyic,InkmothNexus,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:14:32 2015 UTC,"phant and wraith exist, but chancellor gives additional outs. the point isn't to get people to throw DRS away, but to make it come down a turn too late. neither stops turn 1 cabal therapy or thoughtsieze from being a time walk, chancellor does.  against thalia, your main plan is now to make zombies. if she's their only thing on board, just attack with almost everything. she has first strike, so she can't trade and break bridges even if they wanted her to, which they don't obviously. if they have other dudes that would just trade just move to end step and trade those ichorids in for 4-8 power each, each turn. block their random attackers with narcs and shadows. you are producing multiple creatures a turn to their less than that, so you can get ahead. the problem is when the thalia gets a jitte, or a batterskull, or just a second thalia to break bridges with."
MTGLegacy,3avyic,dlmtg123,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:28:54 2015 UTC,"I understand how ichroid has game against thalia, in this example though, you are assuming you have a non-zero number of bridges, which is definitely not always the case.  That is why thalia is so crippling, because you are reduced to this game plan alone.  I have NEVER seen a lone thalia.  There are  sooooo many creatures in that deck, if she is the only thing they have on board after turn three then you would be extremely lucky.  And yes, jitte is what you want to tutor for to all of those D&T players out there! haha"
MTGLegacy,3avyic,babyrhino,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:35:54 2015 UTC,Probably. The main benefit of a list like this is that it can keep recurring the bloodghasts through land drops either with dryad arbor or dakmore salavge. In this regard it is actually a lot like Vintage Dredge though I would still rather have LEDs.
MTGLegacy,3avyic,InkmothNexus,5,Wed Jun 24 01:14:40 2015 UTC,"dryad arbor and dakmor salvage trigger bloodghast, and arbor can be sacrificed to therapy/dread return. you can also dread return it to get back bloodghasts and chain dread returns. river kelpie lets you dredge into the kill."
MTGLegacy,3avyic,RedeNElla,2,Tue Jun 23 23:19:45 2015 UTC,"River Kelpie has some neat stuff with Bloodghast too. It lets you dredge when it comes into play, and you can then dredge off it with any land drop (including having the first dredge be for dakmor salvage).  Just goldfishing it a bit but it feels pretty sweet."

Sac the two bloodghasts and the dryad arbor for another dread return targetting flame kin zealot, get 3 more zombies, zealot comes into play. Attack for 21.

MTGLegacy,3avyic,sagemeister,2,Wed Jun 24 11:24:31 2015 UTC,"It may seem kind of weird, but I think the interaction with crop rotation in this list could prove interesting. Sac dryad arbor -> zombie tokens,  dryad arbor into play -> bloodghast recursion."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,mdw2402,6,Tue Jun 23 20:30:01 2015 UTC,"It's too slow and too hard to cast.  You only play 12 lands, and those either hurt you or produce a limited amount of mana.  Plus, it's just dead once you've dumped your hand and start dredging."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,alcaizin,2,Tue Jun 23 20:50:44 2015 UTC,"I agree that it's too slow, but it's not dead once you've dumped your hand and started dredging: You get 3 draw triggers every draw step instead of just one."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,jeffderek,3,Tue Jun 23 21:19:37 2015 UTC,"If you're dredging every turn, then it's going to your graveyard, yeah?"
MTGLegacy,3ave87,alcaizin,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:55:08 2015 UTC,"Well for starters, your graveyard is where you want everything anyway.  But let's say you're hellbent with a Grave Troll and two Imps in your yard.  Without library, you're going to dredge the Grave Troll, put 6 cards in your yard, and that's your turn unless something you hit is relevant.  With library, you get to dredge 16 cards, since you get to draw 3.  Because of the way library is worded, you won't have to put any cards back AND you won't have to pay any life.  You'll just have the grave troll and two imps in hand.  Now you have to figure out how to get them back in the yard, but if you're dredging that many cards you've probably found more dredgers or at worst a therapy you can target yourself with."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,jeffderek,4,Tue Jun 23 23:13:31 2015 UTC,"I think he means, if you're dredging every turn, how are you casting Sylvan Library from your graveyard."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,RedeNElla,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:50:16 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but lots of the deck fits into that category.  You still run Breakthrough, for example, because of how good it is when it's in your opener, even if you can never really draw it later."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,jeffderek,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:33:59 2015 UTC,"True. It's similar to Bazaar, and Faithless Looting though, the fact that it draws a bunch, and then dumps a bunch is really handy.   Library sounds pretty sweet, and is worth experimenting with, but it seems like it would be less explosive than Breakthrough (and more expensive). Breakthrough being cast from the one non-rainbow land in most lists is also somewhat relevant (you can cast Breakthrough with any one land in the deck compared with needing two lands, one of which rainbow to cast library)"
MTGLegacy,3ave87,RedeNElla,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:47:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed. This isn't Bazaar of Baghdad, which gives additional draw and discard."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,Sir_Laser,3,Wed Jun 24 01:13:06 2015 UTC,You do not get to see the top 3 cards first. You may choose to draw or dredge any/all of the 3 cards you are drawing that turn (unless you choose to draw/dredge just 1). Then all of the cards you drew and did not dredge -1 have to either be payed for or put back.
MTGLegacy,3ave87,Apocolyps6,2,Tue Jun 23 23:00:30 2015 UTC,"Correct.  For each draw trigger, you get to either Dredge or Draw a card.  If you dredge all 3, you won't have to pay life or put anything back, but you don't get to see what the cards are at any point before you make that decision."
MTGLegacy,3ave87,jeffderek,4,Tue Jun 23 23:14:35 2015 UTC,"but you don't get to see what the cards are at any point before you make that decision.   Let's say you have a Sylvan Library and a dredger in your graveyard. Here's your draw step slowed down.  Draw step starts. You need to draw for turn. (This can be replaced by dredging.) Resolve this draw/dredge.  Sylvan Libary's ability triggers (as do any milled Narcomoebas) and goes on the stack. You have priority. You can cast/activate things. (e.g. Your opponent can activate Relic when you pass priority.)  Sylvan Library's ability resolves. Choose whether you want to draw two additional cards. If you decide ""yes"", you can replace either draw with dredging. You can wait for the first dredge to finish before deciding on if the second draw should be a dredge. No one has priority between the draws. After you've resolved the draws/dredge, you have to settle up with Sylvan Library. If you dredged all three you don't have to pay anything.  The stack is empty (except maybe some Narco triggers or something) and you have priority. It is still in your draw step."

MTGLegacy,3awd9n,paladin_blake,3,Wed Jun 24 01:29:23 2015 UTC,Don't fall into that trap -- you're just as susceptible anyway and further make things worse by gimping your own mana.   Anytime you fetch for basics you're opening yourself to colorscrew by getting plains/swamp and getting wasted off of UU for dig or TNN/clique.   There's no shame in being a greedy mana based deck. You make up for it by playing hugely powerful cards. Diluting your lands as a nod to one or two decks in the room is just going to make your other matchups worse and you'll still probably lose to the Ancient Tomb Lotus Petal Blood Moon opener anyway.

MTGLegacy,3auuo7,dafunkee,3,Tue Jun 23 18:45:39 2015 UTC,"12-post is really good, especially if there's a lot of Miracles in your local metagame.  And let's face it, there's a lot of Miracles in every local metagame."
MTGLegacy,3auuo7,milesrout,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:36:58 2015 UTC,"12-post is still a great and fun deck. I still play it, http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=75668 here is a somewhat recent list. I would suggest -1 Dryad Arbor -1 Courser, +2 Show and tell main, -1 repeal, +1 engineered explosives compared to that list, and better fetches. The sideboard needs many changes.  It's very good vs anything slow or grindy, miracles and lands it's sort of hard to lose against. It's bad vs goblins, infect, omnitell, elves, RUG delver. Sideboard according to your meta. It's not bad vs ANT even though tons of people will tell you it is. I wouldn't play the deck if your meta is really fast but if you have miracles and stoneforges running around be be prepared to crush. I would say it's a pretty skill intensive deck to pilot since almost every matchup you get behind and have to come back. The mono green version is less versatile but a bit faster and much easier to pilot. You can reply if you have specific questions, I have been playing the deck for a couple years now."

MTGLegacy,3auuo7,Timiniel,1 point,Wed Jun 24 11:21:19 2015 UTC,"Interestingly there essentially 2 versions of the 12 post deck. The GU and the Gw. Each of these decks play differently than the other. GU uses more cantrips, also a great trick is using repeal to bounce back a candle and recasting to double is untapping. Gw really only has white for sideboard. It can use Green Sun's Zenith to pull Primetime, Gaddock Teeg or also can Dryad Arbor if you run it. Ive seen lists running Moment's Peace to hold down the fort, personally not a fan of that."

You hold Ethersworn in hand until they cast Show and Tell, then play Ethersworn and pray that you've found your Krosan Grip to blow up the Omniscience when they pass turn after Show and Tell. When you're playing 3x Top though, there's a good chance that you've found your Krosan Grip by then, and even a decent chance to natural draw it if they don't combo until turn 3 or so."

Considering that the conventional wisdom for the deck is to needle wasteland unless you are going to lose to another effect that is onboard with your first two needles I am skeptical.   With that mentality that is saying FoW and Daze to deal with other decks make them soft.   Counterspells contribute to tempo gameplans by enabling the tempo and aggro control rolls.  Needle (and crop rotation in the majority of cases) contributes to the 12 post game plan by causing it to not fall apart.

There is no smugness or personal attack here bud, cool your jets. Not everyone is out to hate on you. It's a joke towards Miracles since 12-post is one of their worst matchups.  This is a constructive conversation. 12-post I not top tier but it is very competitive in the current meta.   There is a difference between cards you run because they contribute to what you're already planning on doing and cards you run because you're dead to something without it.   So wouldn't Crop Rotation contribute to what 12-post is already planning on doing? Tutoring lands to play out large creatures or to answer the game state. If you are using wasteland to prevent 12-post from doing what it does, then you utilize a card to prevent that. Take Counterbalance out of Miracles and what do you get? Take out Omniscience from Omni-tell. These decks fall apart. All decks have primary pieces that make them operate at maximum capability. Crop Rotation and Pithing Needle doesn't make the deck fall apart, they do slow it down yet it is still functional without them.  Why would a deck be considered bad if it runs cards to help answer situations against other decks? Isn't that what half of what this game is about?"

If there's no smugness or personal attacks dont act smug or insult me because I dont think a deck is good.   So wouldn't Crop Rotation contribute to what 12-post is already planning on doing?     Im not sure how many times I can say this or how many different ways I can before it sinks in so ill suggest you do this.  You want chasm primarily for burn and bog primarily for reanimator.  Obviously there are exceptions and corner cases where you'll want chasm to fog after landing a monster or where bog will stop a deathrite activation that might kill you but im trying to keep this to the ""reasons you play the card"" side and not ""minor upsides you also gain.  So, if you accept that you're primary rotation targets are karakas chasm and bog you're playing rotation to tutor in a silver bullet against decks that contain eidolon of the great revel, emrakul, entomb and ichorid and you're looking to defend against decks with wasteland.  By mtgdecks.net list of the 50 most popular cards in the past 30 days there were 425 wastelands or roughly 106 decks where you want to hold rotation as a defensive play.  Now, emrakul, entomb and eidolon dont actually crack the top 50. In the best possible case scenario they are all tied for 51st which is pretty much the only case where you're tutoring for silver bullets more than Defending your mana.  In actuality, dredge has put up 12,  reanimator has put up 7, sneak attack has put up 5 and burn has put up 6 results or 106 vs 30 meaning you are 3.5x as likely to need to defend your lands from wasteland in any given top 8 than you are to need to tutor up a silver bullet. Crop rotations major contribution is defending you against a single card that you are otherwise incredibly soft to.   Take Counterbalance out of Miracles and what do you get? Take out Omniscience from Omni-tell.    Do I really need to explain the difference between the namesake flagship card in a deck and a roll player?  12 post is highly dependant on using its roll players to defend it from a single card it is very weak to and without those roll players the deck falls apart to a single card.  Keeping with your example of miracles, taking away counterbalance would be like taking away cloudpost.  If you want a real analogy it would be more akin to not having snapcaster.  Miracles does not fall apart without snapcaster. It is suboptimal, yes, but functional.    Crop Rotation and Pithing Needle doesn't make the deck fall apart, they do slow it down yet it is still functional without them.   Not against wasteland it isnt.  Remember, 12 post is a pretty proactive deck unless you're playing against miracles.  If you go slow against delver or death and taxes you're likely to just get mana denialed out of the game."
MTGLegacy,3auu45,zerolinks2014,3,Tue Jun 23 18:11:06 2015 UTC,"General GP advice:   Only bring what you are going to use. Specifically, only bring the cards that you will be playing with or intend to trade/sell. Sadly, theft is a problem at large events, and no one wants their binder of Legacy staples. As well, do not leave anything unattended. People have had their bags which were right next to them stolen. I always keep my bag between my legs, with one strap through my leg.  Hydrate often.  Bring snacks. It's tough to find time to sneak in a proper meal during the day, so any snack will go a long way, especially healthy ones. I like to bring nut and dried fruit mixes with me. Bring Ibuprofen (or something like it). Magic is a mentally exhausting game, doubly so for Legacy. If you want to buy cards, get there early on Friday. Dealers only have a finite stock of cards with them. Same goes for selling -- lots of dealers run out of cash-on-hand by Sunday. Do not hesitate to call a judge for any reason. See something shady while walking around? Call for a judge. Did your opponent miss his Dark Confidant trigger? Call for a judge. Do you not understand the interaction between Sylvan Library and Life from the Loam? Call for a judge."

I've found I always want more crop rotations when I play this deck, it is a great answer to wasteland (wasteland my inkmoth, crop rotate it for another inkmoth). I like 2 krosan grips in the sideboard, don't forget blood moon is a card. If your opponent is grabbing basics game 2 when they were playing duals game 1 they plan on playing blood moon. I'm sure you already know that though.   Have you consider the sideboard that splashes white with karakas and savannah for RIP and swords to plowshares? I'm curious which you prefer and why.   As for the actual GP, it is a grind. Get a good nights sleep the night before. Make sure you eat breakfast.

MTGLegacy,3auy6u,adambueller,2,Tue Jun 23 18:39:03 2015 UTC,"Your list is fine. It is Brad Nelson's take on Shouta's version right? The matchups you have to really watch out for are Dredge and Reanimator, they are pretty abysmal. Also any deck with a lot of counters can be tricky. Punishing Jund can be bad if they land some timely Hymn to Tourachs, but it shouldn't be that bad."
MTGLegacy,3auy6u,LRats,2,Tue Jun 23 20:12:58 2015 UTC,"Merfolk and Omni-Tell? I like this guy and his blue attitude.   So anyways, long time Omni-tell player reporting for duty!  A few things:   Punishing Jund is actually a rougher match up than people think: Pinpoint discard, Hymns and Lili can make you have a bad time not to mention the blow out sideboard cards like [[Choke]] and [[Golgari Charm]], which crush both you Plan A and your Pyromancer Plan B. Best thing you can do is keep a hand that has brainstorm to hide your combo pieces or keep a land/cantrip heavy starting hand and just take the discard on the chin and sculpt your hand as the game advances. Elves is a race situation and it's nearly impossible to win once they GSZ for Ruric Thar, so you know, try to not let that happen. As mentioned by the other comment, Reanimator is no fun for you...counter what matters and hope you win first. One great trick to remember that has helped avoid more than a few pieces of spicy sideboard tech (such as [[Krosan Grip]] is to retain priority when you sense that your Omniscience is in trouble. Let's assume you are playing the mono-U version vs. infect and you have successfully Show and Tell'd in your Omniscience but you can sense that the Grip is coming (and ain't shit you can do about it once it hits the stack). On several occasions in this exact scenario, I cast [[Cunning Wish]] and then announce to my opponent that I am ""retaining priority"" and then cast [[Dig Through Time]] on top of my wish (and if I have any other relevant instant speed cards I can can add to the stack), then pass priority, they Grip my Omni, and then Dig resolves, usually finding me more of the combo pieces to reload and go off again, then the wish resolves to go get intuition to find anything you might be missing to combo again or something else that's relevant, essentially negating their hate card.    That's all I got for typing on mobile while pooping. Good luck my degenerate friend."

The gate is super fun, can be pretty budget and a good way to break into the format (get some lillies and wastelands if your list calls for it, budget list dont need it), and it has game against most decks, and absolutely poops on delver decks and some other midrange decks. We keep a deck assembled to loan to newer guys, and they enjoy learning complexities of the deck while also being able to learn the format."
MTGLegacy,3ar98x,cincyfire35,6,Tue Jun 23 06:51:38 2015 UTC,"It is far from budget, but Mono-Black Pox is a deck you may consider building towards. Its a basically ""destroy everything"" (Hymn, Sinkhole, Wasteland, Liliana, etc.) deck that wins at a snail's pace with cards like Mishra's Factory, Cursed Scroll, and Nether Spirit. The deck's somewhat comical expense mainly comes from a motley crew of oddball cards that can include Chains of Mephistopheles, The Abyss, Nether Void, and even Tabernacle. Pox isn't Tier 1 my any means, but it is definitely a real deck.  Other Mono-Black decks I know exist are Demon Stompy (an Ancient Tomb/Chalice of the Void deck with beaters like Abyssal Persecutor) and Spanish Inquisition (a Mono-Black storm deck), which are even more fringe than Pox is, but are cheaper."

MTGLegacy,3ar98x,magictgmike,3,Mon Jun 22 23:14:42 2015 UTC,"The most competitive is probably Pox, which is a grindy control deck / quasi-prison.  It's benefits from some expensive enchantments from legends and it also can benefit from a green splash for life from the loam, but those aren't huge improvements to the deck.  There's also suicide black / aggro decks similar to Dead Guy Ale type decks that rely on using dark ritual and chrome mox to dump a ton of 2/2s for B, Dark Confidants, Hymns, etc onto the board and beatdown the enemy while using discard and some spot removal to keep them down.  Finally, you can go for a monoblack reanimator deck, using buried alive and entomb (and thoughtseize / cabal ritual on yourself) to set up your graveyard to reanimate large fatties that may or may not be black.  You'll use discard here again to try to keep your opponent off balance instead of using Daze / Force of Will to protect your line of play.  The suicide black option is likely going to be your most budget-friendly, as the expensive cards are lilianas, thoughtseizes, dark confidants, and phyrexian obliterators, and you have most of those.  For the suicide black option running wasteland/urborg tomb of yawgmoth as a package is not required, but for Pox it is."

Merfolk isn't top tier but if you play Modern Merfolk you just need Force/Daze/Wasteland which isn't a bad upgrade cost. Those are used in lots of decks.

MTGLegacy,3arox4,milesrout,-1,Tue Jun 23 04:27:29 2015 UTC,Burn is a tier 1 deck in the right hands.

MTGLegacy,3arox4,milesrout,2,Tue Jun 23 22:40:35 2015 UTC,"As usual, there's only a handful of decks you can build at that price, and if you want to play more decks, most of the decks you can build at that price aren't too easy to transition into another deck.   My suggestion is enchantress cause it's fun to draw lots of cards. I'm not a fan of dredge, so I tend to avoid wanting to give that answer (as it's the answer given every single time the word budget shows up in this forum). However, the stuff you buy for enchantress is usable only in enchantress for the most part. If you decide you want to save more and possibly double your budget, you can work into getting stuff like a playset of fow, wastelands, blue duals etc. If you're gonna spend something like 750 bucks, you need a deck that you truly enjoy, so I don't suggest getting a budget deck just because it's cheap."

The LED's are the expensive ones and the deck requires 4 of them.  http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/24-05-15-dredge/  I bought all the cards at GP Charlotte. With me loving grave based decks this one is a blast a lot more stable and consistent than the mana-less dredge. Now in modern I play infect because Modern dredge is virtually non-competitive.  and yes please use search ;)
MTGLegacy,3arox4,jackgibson12,1 point,Tue Jun 23 00:02:33 2015 UTC,There is a modern dredge list that went around for a few weeks after GP Vancouver. Uses dredges to put unburied rites/iona or elesh norn in the yard then flash it back.

MTGLegacy,3arox4,RELcat,2,Tue Jun 23 00:03:34 2015 UTC,I have modern affinity and ad nauseam. As well as Merfolk and mono  u tron which I'm sure isn't viable. Merfolk is obviously a contender now that I think about it.
MTGLegacy,3arox4,RedeNElla,2,Tue Jun 23 03:08:04 2015 UTC,"As mentioned by someone else, upgrading Modern Merfolk to Legacy Merfolk is one of the cheaper ways to enter the format."
MTGLegacy,3arox4,jeffderek,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:41:57 2015 UTC,Not to mention Chalice Merfolk + True Name Nemesis is actually pretty solid.
MTGLegacy,3arox4,IgoRStripes,0,Tue Jun 23 19:02:11 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Cards like Cursecatcher and Chalice already do work in some matchups in Modern. I think a lot more Legacy decks fall into the category of being affected by them. And True-Name is always amazing, but being a merfolk too is a huge bonus."
MTGLegacy,3arox4,mdw2402,1 point,Tue Jun 23 22:55:48 2015 UTC,"Agree with /u/RedeNElla.  Upgrading Modern Merfolk to Legacy Merfolk will put you into legacy with what I would say is definitely a budget and below average deck, but the real advantage is that all of the money cards you'll be buying (Force of Will and Wasteland) are staples for half the archetypes in the format.  $750 should get Modern Merfolk into a Legacy version pretty well.  Then over time you can save and tweak and eventually end up in some sort of Delver variant that also uses the Forces and Wastes and Dazes.    Given the cards you have I think it's the best path to a tier one deck with as little wasteful spending as possible.  Sure, you could buy burn or manaless dredge, but where do you go from there?  The reason those decks are cheap is because their cards are only really good in one archetype.  Investing your money in Forces and Wastelands is a much better way to break into the format."
MTGLegacy,3arox4,rumballtron,0,Wed Jun 24 01:20:02 2015 UTC,"You can also upgrade Affinity a bit to make it Legacy useable. Has affinity had a great showing in Legacy? Not recently, no, but it is still a great aggro deck that gets some definite improvement from the artifact lands being legal."

I suggest you find a ""deck-building-path"" because it's a cheap way to work up to a tier 1 deck. Also, try to proxy out a bunch of decks to find a tier 1 deck that you like. Then try to find a path to build up to it."
MTGLegacy,3aqhub,ZEPHYREFTW,4,Mon Jun 22 18:06:31 2015 UTC,"Entreat is often the finisher, but Jace (which is also played) does a good job closing games too. Haven't seen Joe's latest list, so can't speak to what his game plan is.  Temporal Mastery just isn't a useful effect. Extra turns are good when you consistently have powerful things to do with those extra turns, but Miracles is a deck that typically doesn't; the most you'd do is draw a card, play a land, and maybe use Jace to brainstorm again. Since there are much better effects you can get from other cards, they go in the deck instead of Temporal Mastery."
MTGLegacy,3aqhub,ubernostrum,2,Mon Jun 22 18:10:14 2015 UTC,"Joe Lossett has run a build of Miracles featuring 3x Vendillion Clique and 1-2 Venser, Shaper Savant for some time now. He often uses his 2 Karakas to protect and re-use the ETBs of these creatures and wins using them. Given his recent adoption of 2 MD Cavern of Souls, he has been testing running the list without Entreat. Entreat can be hard to set up effectively, is awkward to draw early and is a large mana investment whenever it is cast. I can certainly see the appeal of not running Entreat.   There are some match-ups where you have traditionally needed to race and provide a strong clock to the opponent. This is often when Entreat was at its best. For many of these match-ups, Monastery Mentor (usually only 2 out of the SB) fills that function better and quicker than Entreat can. All that said, I am still running 1 copy of Entreat in my list and I know Joe has been on 1 copy in major events recently as well. Though, he seems to wish he could find a way to cut it permanently.   The other major competing build of Miracles doesn't usually run as many (or any) MD Cliques or Karakas and rarely has access to Venser in the 75. This build is championed by Philipp Schönegger and features 4 Ponders and more Snapcasters to set up the early turns much more consistently and establish an early Top + Counterbalance. This build usually features multiple Entreats as they are the only real win-condition other than Jace, tMS (though, Snapcasters can beat down). This build is much more consistent at mounting its game plan and playing proactively. I personally prefer the extra power of the Legendary Creatures, but you may wish to experiment with your list to determine what fits your play style."
MTGLegacy,3aqhub,rerek,2,Mon Jun 22 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"Jace is the primary win con without entreat.  Reid Duke has played the deck with only Jace's to win and been successful.  The only reason Joe doesn't play Entreat right now is that he cut the 2nd plains for a 2nd [[Cavern of Souls]] and doesn't want any cards his basics can't cast.  If you have 2 plains, then run entreat.  You can also win with Cliques and Snaps or play something like Mentor main or Stoneforge.  Temporal Mastery does so little, it would basically just be [[Explore]].  Its also another card that's bad to have in the opening hand."

When you name human, you get to play un-counterable win-condition known as [[Monastery Mentor]]. If you don't incline to run Cavern, there is little incentive to run Mentor. Mentor from SB can work, but it's still an open debate as to whether it's better than Entreat.  There is no point in running mastery, the point of Miracles is Not about playing the miracle cards to be cool, it's about establishing control, dominate the board state. Gain a turn doesn't answer threats, present threat, or establish lock."

MTGLegacy,3aqhub,marcospolos,3,Mon Jun 22 18:27:20 2015 UTC,Joe has been changing his deck a ton recently.  He cut entreat about a week ago because he moved the 2nd cavern main.

MTGLegacy,3aqhub,greenpm33,2,Tue Jun 23 17:19:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah Joe plays the decks he streams, since it is playtesting.  I think he was referring to the time where joe switched to reanimator, and many of us died a little inside."
MTGLegacy,3aqhub,maturojm,1 point,Fri Jun 26 02:46:21 2015 UTC,"There are a few versions of miracles and you need to cater to your meta and realize what each version brings to the table. Personally I like Joe losett's older version or miracles with my own twist of 2 snapcaster and 3 clique with 2 entreat. His ""legends miracles"" is better vs combo but is much worse aggro. I play more casually so having the extra swords to plowshares helps a lot. Venser can create a ton of fun interactions and create value but I just don't enjoy it. When I first played a budget miracles I tried out temporal mastery but it was horrible, you play 2 man's (which usually prevents you from casting anything else) to play a land and then play another turn where you play another land and say go. Miracles is almost exclusively played on your opponents turn so having extra turns of your own without their turns in between just doesn't work well."
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,dafrk3in,3,Mon Jun 22 14:01:42 2015 UTC,"R/G lands.  Got crushed, all because of my own mistakes.  Im extremely new to the deck, and I really need to figure it out.  Had fun though.  (It also didnt help that i had to work until late the night before, and was rushing to be on time, and filling out a decklist as they were collecting them, etc.  It took me two rounds to even feel caught up to myself.)  I played against Sneak and Show, Alluren, a Death Blade variant, Goblins, and reanimator."

I should have beaten the death blade variant too but by then I was pretty demoralized and just stopped playing well.  I did take reanimator in one game, but that took a loooooong time.  We had about seven minutes left after that, and the second game my opponent had a nut draw and was able to get griselbrand beating me up turn two.  Games two and three we had judges sitting next to us because we were the last ones playing, and we were into extended time.  It definitely made me nervous, like driving with a cop behind you.    Anyway, a good experience.  It was fun to play against decks i hadnt seen in real life before.  Im used to sixteenperson lgs tournies.  I just need more play time."
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,thedignityofstruggle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:13:36 2015 UTC,"I think reanimator is actually an excellent matchup. You should have either main deck bojuka bog or karakas which are both very hard for reanimator to beat. On top of that, you can fetch them at instant speed with a card you have four of. The same goes for sneak and show as you effectively have 9 copies of karakas mainboard (4 gamble 4 crop rotate) and that's the card they have most trouble with. As a lands player I really don't mind sitting down across from reanimator or sneak and show its Omnitel and alluren that are really hard to beat."
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,TyrannosaurosRex,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:37:07 2015 UTC,"I tried to crop against reanimator and it got forced.  Game one i bojuka bogged his yard and held back until I made the token.  I should have mulled to Karakas game two against show and tell, and but that was game one, and i was running late, almost auto lossed due to making it late to seat, yadda yadda, i fucked it up."
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,thedignityofstruggle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:46:28 2015 UTC,I'm not saying the matchups are auto-wins by any means but I do believe they are 50/50 at least. You can win and lose any matchup but I think you are more likely to lose these matchups to lack of skill or player mistakes over simply having no winning lines.

MTGLegacy,3apmkk,thedignityofstruggle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:54:30 2015 UTC,I've played the deck quite a bit and I believe that it is very rare for it to be correct to use most of your resources to try and set up the full prison. Most of the time the game plan is simply to stall the opponents game plan long enough to be in a good position to either be making a token every turn with loam in case they remove the first one or two or to simply push out a token when you're in danger of losing control.
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,TyrannosaurosRex,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:59:06 2015 UTC,Cool.  I recognize i need to be better about playing around counter magic too.  Its rough not running any blue.
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,thedignityofstruggle,1 point,Mon Jun 22 22:44:48 2015 UTC,Yea counter magic is usually dead against you. Once you get exploration/mana bond down the only spell you really need to cast is loam each turn. You generally only want to crop rotate if you really need to.
MTGLegacy,3apmkk,TyrannosaurosRex,1 point,Mon Jun 22 23:02:50 2015 UTC,"Which is interesting, because that means they have their countermagic handy when you need your crop rotation (or gamble.). Having a crucial crop rotation hit by FoW can really suck, because the land is sacked and yourel likely in a bind.   Anyway, im all ears to other tips, tricks, or advice with play.  Honestly, i need to be better about mulligans with shitty hands.  Im kind of terrified when i mull to five.  What is your general seek with a starting hand?  I find that Im often looking to hold some form of access to green mana and some sort of mana acceleration.  Mox diamond is a bonus, as is loam.  Thoughts?"

MTGLegacy,3aoats,mpaw975,2,Mon Jun 22 03:55:50 2015 UTC,"Hey, I was your swiss / QF opponent. Thanks again for the games, and I wholly admit that things went rather south for you in our QF match. One thing: my deck had 0 delver of secrets in it. It's probably better titled 'Grixis Pyromancer' or even 'Grixis Control'.   I should also say, in retrospect, that my skepticism regarding myth realized was mostly due to its having failed to do much for me in modern, although abrupt decay is more prevalent in that format than in legacy right now, it would seem. I certainly still feel as though it might not be the best card in tokens pseudo-mirrors, for obvious (ish) reasons, but your density of removal may have made it a reasonable conclusion even there, since I can't chump it forever. I do think 3 copies is a bit much, even now, and it seems correct that you adjusted the numbers.  Is dig really considered too slow? Even a pair? The late game potential offered by that card is just so unreal. I understand that it is clunky on your aggressive draws, but you are often just a midrange deck anyway (maybe that is just how our matches went, given that delvers will never survive against grixis).   Post-script: looking at your list, the 'budget' 1-of misdirection is especially hilarious, since it was a massive headache in game 1 of our swiss match.  Post-post-script: I guess it is hard to see what could be cut easily for dig through time. Maybe this is just a sacrifice the deck has to make. I can't imagine making it myself - it is certainly the reason to play grixis pyro, if there is one."

BUG Delver: Looks like you're opting for Digs instead of Lilis in the Hymn shell. Manabase seems fine since Deathrite is bonkers.  Omnitell: Flusterstorms don't need to be main, but you can split 3 total between it and Spell Pierce.

MTGLegacy,3an3e8,Timiniel,2,Sun Jul 19 23:06:07 2015 UTC,Hmm. Have you considered removing the bobs and going for tasigur/angler?
MTGLegacy,3an3e8,ReallyForeverAlone,4,Mon Jun 22 11:36:28 2015 UTC,"Is it playable together with shocks at all?   Absolutely not. I have proxy BUG Delver list with 2 Bobs in it and flipping a FoW is definitely feelsbad.mode but one of the strongest boards in Legacy is a flipped Delver + Bob. Potential 5 damage on the board, and pressures your opponent into either saving themselves 3 life a turn so they could maybe block the 2/1 nonflyer later, or killing your card advantage engine and losing to the fastest clock in Legacy."

It really depends on the metagame: if I'm expecting much combo I'd rather have Delver where I can provide an early clock and strip their hand of combo cards long enough for that clock to matter. If I'm expecting a more fair meta, I want Shardless so they feel really bad using a Lightning Bolt on a 2/2 that came with a free card attached.  The good thing is that once you have BUG Delver, there's very little further cost to having the cards to build Shardless."
MTGLegacy,3angyh,jr2694,4,Sun Jun 21 23:10:18 2015 UTC,"Basically if you get omniscience into play, in most cases the pact trigger won't matter. You have two ways around it, cunning wish for Firemind's Foresight into the Release the Ants win, or Trickbind the pact trigger so you don't lose and win with Emrakul. Both of these should be doable with omniscience and a cantrip or two to get going.   Taking that into consideration, it's free removal that also isn't blue, which lets you get around Iona if you know they have it and you wish for it before attempting to go off. The fact that it's free also makes it ideal for powering through tax effects like Thalia or Thorn of Amethyst. Keep in mind that in almost all cases, you aren't looking for removal after getting Omni into play, you usually need removal to get something out that is keeping you from comboing off. So you need enough mana to cast cunning wish + your wish target + show and tell after the hatebear is gone. You want the cheapest removal spell possible.   Dream Halls is mainly an alternate wincon that you board in if you suspect your opponent is playing Extirpate or Surgical Extraction. Without it, you have no realistic way of winning in these situations. It also has some minor utility value in matchups like Reanimator where the symmetry is slightly less dangerous than the symmetry of show and tell. For example - your opponent has iona in hand, they aren't going to have another white card to cast iona, so dream halls is a lot safer than show and tell."
MTGLegacy,3angyh,pinkfrosting,1 point,Mon Jun 22 00:12:27 2015 UTC,"What pink said, also note you can actually pay for it after the combo if you really have to with lands and a petal.  Also Dream halls acts as a 5th show and tell or a 5th omniscience, but it can't get you emrakul. Halls is good against lands.dec mud.dec, ect, decks that have a similar clock. It just helps you be more consistent by only needing either the omniscience or the show and tell."

MTGLegacy,3aijif,Havepity,3,Sat Jun 20 15:00:32 2015 UTC,"I like the list a lot. I however would like to include the dark depths combo because it gives you free wins, and is easily powered out by knight.   In sideboard everything seems fine, though maybe adding spirit of lab, ethersworn, or thrun vs specific matchups would be solid. Also is there a reason your running exxtirpate over surgical?"
MTGLegacy,3aijif,Magnaguard100,2,Sat Jun 20 15:52:01 2015 UTC,"I second this. I think if you want Maverick to be competitive right now you NEED the DD combo. One of the biggest strengths of Maverick is Knight plus Mother but in the age of deathrite eating lands (both your deathrite and the opponents) you can't just rely on knight being huge to give you the win.   Furthermore, the combo give you major game against fast combo. I might even consider crop rotation as a two of.   I also think that you are trying to cram a lot into this deck. Having both Stoneforges and Confidants along with Plows and Decays seems a bit greedy and taxes your mana base that much more. You need to be able to reliably get to 4 mana to really leverage green sun zenith and I cant see you being able to fetch enough basics. I would make sure you test a fair bit against delver matchups to see if that becomes a problem.  I think if I was going to leave the list just as is but slot in a stage and dd I would cut scryb ranger and horizon canopy.  I would also consider trying to streamline the plan of the deck and reduce the amount of black out of fear of wasteland vulnerability."

The extirpate was basically because I prefer the can't be countered aspect over the freeness off of extraction.  The European meta is very combo heavy so I have been pondering Canonist too"
MTGLegacy,3aijif,wdingo,1 point,Sat Jun 20 15:58:21 2015 UTC,"That's funny, I've had the exact opposite opinion on the depths combo in Maverick.  The number of free wins it gives you far outweighs the number of games you just lose because you need to hit your land drops or a certain color and you rip a Stage or a Depths off the top.  I'm also not super hyped on Maze right now considering a lot of Omni decks don't even run G-Daddy anymore in favor of cantrips and digs.  Bob is interesting and I've been toying with putting him in.  The cool thing about Mav is that it's such a meta deck and is really quite customizable based on what you think you're going to see and what your playstyle is."

MTGLegacy,3aijif,Mythikdawn,5,Sun Jun 21 16:01:36 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Maverick (GSZ and Vial) for almost a year now, and here's my initial reactions:  Mainboard:   -Dark Confidant is bad in this deck - mostly because he's slow. He requires two turns to get value out of, dies very easily, and your Golgari Charms in the sideboard kill him.   -I would probably shave a Thalia if you're going to maindeck three Decay.   -I honestly hate Maze of Ith in this deck because it's horrible to see in the early stages of the game and really doesn't help against most of the decks that are on the beatdown plan.   -I definitely would not run any less than four Wasteland - remember, Maverick is a resource denial deck.   -I strongly urge you to play a Gaea's Cradle if you have access to one. Having surplus mana is nice esp. if you decide to sideboard Batterskull (which I think is good).   -I don't like Cavern of Souls as much, since if you name Human, all it really does is benefit Thalia and Mom, or if you name Kor it only benefits Stoneforge Mystic, which leaves you with a colorless land a majority of the time. Having an uncounterable Knight of the Reliquary can be nice, though, and maybe justifies playing one copy, but due to the toolboxy nature of the deck, I just don't think you'll hit the relevant creature type often enough.   -Sylvan Library is, in my opinion, the best mono-green card and I think you could benefit from playing one. Having card filter and being able to dig in a nonblue deck helps keep up immensely.  -I would also like to see a basic Plains and possibly a basic Swamp as well in the list. Being able to draw out of an untimely Blood Moon is nice, but I also just really like basic lands.   -I would cut Bog either entirely or out to the sideboard - you have enough graveyard hate with DRS and Scooze to not want to include a monocolored tapland.  -I think going up to a playset of Swords to Plowshares is your best friend here because getting over a large Goyf when you don't have Knight of the Reliquary is important.  -If you're maindecking Decay, you're going to want two Bayous.  Sideboard:   -I think the Spellbombs are a bit overkill, but if you plan on seeing a lot of dredge/loam/etc then it might be okay. My experience is that most of the time you get the delver/miracles matchup where it's a dead sideboard slot. I would replace these with two Teegs. With how popular Miracles is, having multiple cards that can shut their entire deck off is very good.  -I like Thoughtseize, but I almost think it could be Duress instead. Personal preference - since you're not playing Vial, you don't need to preemptively Thoughtseize a Clique to get around getting Cliqued in response to activating Vial. A niche case, but I've lost because of it.  -Extirpate should probably be Surgical Extraction. I love Extirpate, I really do. But if you are bringing this in, you're likely also bringing discard in - and being able to turn 1 Thoughtseize their Terminus/Swords/Infernal Tutor/etc into Surgical is nothing less than gross.  -Pithing Needle is fine.  -Golgari Charm is BAD. Very, very, bad. What you're looking for here is Zealous Persecution. Not only does it not kill your dudes, but it buffs them as well. The mass regeneration is pretty much useless except in response to a Pyroclasm (which if you have ZP, your x/2s will live anyways), or Supreme Verdict, which is only ever a one-of and not in every Miracles list, and the break an enchantment mode is covered better by Abrupt Decay in that it can't be countered.   -Containment Priest is pretty much useless now that no one is playing Sneak and Show - that being said, you can potentially hose Elves or Dredge with this card. I would cut either one or both of them, since it doesn't even get fetched by GSZ. I would play one or two Krosan Grip over Priest - having a Split Second answer to Omniscience is good with the way the meta is heading.  -Choke is very good. I like playing two in GSZ Maverick.  -SoFaF is a great card for getting past Goyfs and I love it.  -Cataclysm seems very bad if you're not playing Vials and/or you don't have Flagstones of Trokair. I think this should be a second Surgical Extraction.  -I would try and fit in an Ethersworn Canonist or two if you can. There are quite a few matchups where you just want to put more dudes on board all the time, even against a non-combo deck.  Other thoughts:  -I really like Siege Rhino as a one-of or a two-of. Having the huge body plus a lightning helix on top of it AND trample is just too good. I've stolen a LOT of games/matches simply by topdecking GSZ with five mana to an opponent who is at three life.  -I'm seeing others suggest Dark Depths/Thespian's Stage, and I honestly think that's not where GSZ Maverick wants to be. I could justify putting it into Vial Maverick, where you have a much better way of accessing nonbasics (via Weathered Wayfarer), but in GSZ you really don't want lands that don't tap for mana or don't tap for colored mana right away.  I think this should about cover it. Hope it helps!"

Merfolk succeeds because it has access to Force and Daze as free spells to back up its vial/tap-out-for-lords plan.  It also has Silvergill Adept as card advantage and Cursecatcher as more countermagic.  Also, the Merfolk lords give Islandwalk, which is super relevant given that a large number of legacy decks are blue.  Zombies don't have nearly the same kind of CA or evasion, and the lords cost three mana as opposed to two."
MTGLegacy,3akj6l,alcaizin,1 point,Sun Jun 21 02:58:59 2015 UTC,"All true. Coming from playing Merfolk I understand this. I am just bored with that deck and looking to branch out, i guess. I saw zombardment and still just dont see the throughput of that deck, so I have tried to recreate a merfolk deck through a zombie shell using various synergies and interactions. The lords are definitely slower than what I'm used to an I have none of that explosiveness of the Reejerey dropping a hand, NO pulling a craterhoof or even Goblin Warchief/Lackey getting things rolling early. I have opted instead for a control based game disrupting with thoughtsieze and hymn, as well as rotting rats and fleshbag all the while having a strong midgame with grottos, defilers and lord of the undeads. I dont have a lot of reach to really test this thing against a huge field. Im fairly anti-social and my playgroup doesnt have any SnT players. Against various delvers, miracles, ANT and a few others its fun to play. I wont quote any win %s because I dont have them and would hate to mislead anybody. But because its a playgroup, its not as competitive as the scene at Asgard, the closest true legacy store here in Houston.  Its fun when it works, but there are definitely times where I get stuck with hard to play hands like lots of creatures but no disruption, too much disruption, inadequate cards against storm but I mean I dont think this is out of the ordinary. I dunno, maybe it just wont work and im playing with fools gold. Thanks for the honest reply :)"
MTGLegacy,3akj6l,5028,4,Sun Jun 21 03:25:40 2015 UTC,"Ok, so if I got this right, you're actively looking for a worse deck, you want it to be a zombie brew, and want help making it better? A bit strange, but okay.  Anyways, if you're making a bad Legacy deck and want it to actually do something, you have to go for the free wins, because they're the wins you can actually get. With this in mind, I imagine a Zombie Tribal deck in Legacy would be a prison deck that would look something like this:  4x Cavern of Souls  4x Ancient Tomb  3x City of Traitors  2x Urborg, Tomb of Yawgmoth  11x Swamp  4x Nether Void  4x Chalice of the Void  4x Contamination  4x Unmask  2x Smallpox  2x Slaughter Pact  4x Gravecrawler  4x Gurmag Angler  4x Necromancer's Assisstant  3x Graveborn Muse  1x Liliana's Reaver  Sol-Lands ramp your mana up quickly. Chalice of the Void turns off spells of the cost of your choice. Nether Void turns off pretty much all spells. Cavern of Souls let's you ignore both of these things and be the player who can actually cast spells, because those cards are template so that the spells are automatically ""countered"".  Also, Gravecrawler + Contamination can also lock out opponents not playing Black.  Gurmag Angler is a 1 drop that ignores Chalice even without Cavern. Unmask works as a pre-emptive Force of Will on your first turn so they don't interrupt your lock or combo off first, and doesn't fight with Chalice.  This deck is not GOOD - I don't think there's a GOOD Zombie Tribal deck in Legacy currently. This one will at least pick up a fair number of 'free wins' though just because it will lock the opponent out. Then, you can play with ratty revised basics and laugh as you beat them with a Necromancer's Assisstant (which is the whole point of decks like these, they're usually to troll people by actually beating them with terrible, terrible cards).  That's how I'd go about building a Legacy Zombie Tribal deck (if I had to). Don't forget, usually really ugly basics lands is important here."

MTGLegacy,3afr08,warpg8,2,Fri Jun 19 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"Affinity in legacy is very tier 2. It can't out race delver withe delvers tempo based control. Delver is the agro deck spot affinity wants. And It's bearly tier 1. Other control decks have sweapers, and punishing fire appears in Jund and lands lists can pretty much mop up anything you could try and race with. On sideboard you will find tons of artifact hate, and worse if you do make a dent in the local meta you will see bridge and null rod popping up wich effectively kills your deck.

The problem with these decks isn't that they  are intrinsically  bad, rather  that they  can be easily  shut down if you  expect them ahead of time, this is what  keeps them outside of tier 1 territory - the fact that they can only make up  a certain percentage of the  playing field and still hold parity with more meta-resilient tier 1 lists like delver/stoneblade/miracles"
MTGLegacy,3afr08,rickyroper,2,Sun Jun 21 05:05:47 2015 UTC,"Eryao Affinity is not viable. In order to flip it, you will commit a lot of permanents onto the board. In Legacy, there're simply too many free spells and too many instants. I can target anything Affinity has using a Pyroblast to have it get countered (yes, it's a legal target) and then proceed to Terminus everything Affinity has.  Neither Champion or Master are good enough in Legacy.  The heavy hitter of Affinity is cranial plating. You're just miserable without it. Other Legacy decks are simply better than Affinity. Without Plating, you NEED to have a Chalice in play on 1. Without either, you're just worse than any Delver decks.  Simply put, Affinity is for Modern. You like to play artifacts, play MUD. You like tempo strategy, play any Delver decks."
MTGLegacy,3afr08,twndomn,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:21:21 2015 UTC,"This is what I have been using for Affinity:   http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/essie-artifacts/  As far as the card choices are; I have been trying to focus on getting out a Chalice on Turn 1. My deck doesn't focus on getting Sol Lands into play because I want to pump as much possible power into Master/Cranial Plating as well as play a great deal of colors.  The Boros Charm has been a pretty sweet piece of tech because It either wins the game for you or saves stuff from getting wiped (except from things like Terminus obviously).  Lim Dul's Vault G1 is mostly trying to look for Dack. As soon as Dack is on the board your draws are alot less crappy; nothing sucks more then drawing those 0cc creatures, lotus petals, lands, more moxes. G2-3 It can look for Sideboard Pieces.  The biggest issues I am running into is that you have absolutely no way of interacting with the opponent; save for the Revokers and the Chalice's. The only Solution I have come up with is Liquimetal coating which is mostly just really 'cute' with Dack, and it makes him able to gain control of target permanent.  Everyone can have their personal opinions about this list but this is what has worked best for me and will give you more perspective to other things you can be doing with Affinity.  As far as worrying about people sideboarding in Artifact Hate, I really do not see it too often where I play mainly due to the fact that it's a Tier 2 deck and not worth taking up Sideboard Slots for.  Also with Affinities ""Core"" don't forget Thoughtcast! its the closest legal card to Ancestral Recall IMHO."

MTGLegacy,3afgl1,kaluma,9,Fri Jun 19 18:24:01 2015 UTC,"Everyone is different but I'll try to relate my thoughts on the deck coming from a UWR Delver player. Being on the Delver plan means you're trying to ride a single creature to victory. The idea/hope is that you T1 Delver, T2 Flip with protection (Daze, Spell Pierce, FoW). Ride the insect to victory. This strategy is counteracted by your own StPs, Abrupt Decay, any flier on their board, or a legitimate race (burn, combo, etc). What I'm getting at is that it's hard to protect your Delvers when you're tapping out to put a SFM into play, and then tapping out to activate the SFM, then tapping out to play a TNN. Yes, the SFM + TNN gameplan is fantastic for any game that's going to run long, but that's not what Delver is trying to do. Lightning Bolt helps the Delver scenario significantly. It adds additional 1 mana removal (get their DRS, Delvers, flyers, etc out of the way) and acts as reach for when you just need to quickly close out a game.  But what do you take out? If you're going to run Delver, I suggest either the BUG, RUG or the UR variety for the above reasons and the following. UR is a more resilient burn deck that forsakes speed for the inevitability and game against combo. BUG tries to out value your opponent. RUG tries to deploy cheap threats and keep your opponent's off kilter by attacking their mana base.  So that is a long way of saying that I'd venture into Stoneblade/Countertop territory if you're set on the UW route."
MTGLegacy,3afgl1,Sonicpulsar,3,Fri Jun 19 19:39:18 2015 UTC,"this makes sense, but one of the strengths of UWr (and this UW deck) is it's ability to shift roles from control to beatdown or vise versa depending on what the situation calls for. the disadvantage is that you are not the best beatdown deck or the best control deck and i get that. i was just seeing if there was an optimum UW build or if UW is competitive in general. it's likely that the answer is no, other delver decks are more efficient at what delver decks are trying to do and stoneblade decks don't need to have this avenue of attack, but wanted to get other opinions."
MTGLegacy,3afgl1,Sonicpulsar,5,Fri Jun 19 20:05:44 2015 UTC,"One of the strengths of UWR Delver over the others is the sideboard options that White brings to the table. Meddling Mage, RiP, etc.  On a separate, but related note. I've been trying to find a build with Young Pyros and Monastery Mentor that I like. Haven't found it yet but there's got to be one out there. The ability to go wide is awfully tempting. Yet again, I think the Grixis Delver decks do a similar thing, but better."
MTGLegacy,3afgl1,mpaw975,2,Fri Jun 19 20:26:56 2015 UTC,"I started with the Brainstorm Show's UWR Mentor list but it felt really underpowered to me.

Its late game is improved by Opt and Preordain. Opt and Peek can help protect your Mentor at instant speed and Peek plays nicely with the sideboard Cabal Therapy + Meddling Mage. It now has a way to use its graveyard game 1 (Grim Lavamancer) as well as help clear the board.   I like Cavern of Souls because you want to do your fighting while a Pyro or Mentor is on the board, not while it's on the stack. Cavern makes that happen. (Note all your creatures are humans.) It also can push through a Chalice or Counterbalance.  With the extra 5 cantrips we can afford to cut some lands. 4 Wastelands seems like too much since we want to get to 3 lands on turn 3. The mana denial plan seems dubious in this deck, and Daze just doesn't do enough in the face of an opposing Lightning Bolt or Swords to Plowshares."

If you want a better deck, play Maverick, but Jund could easily become a thing again in the future. You could test Kolaghan's Command in legacy Jund too. Being able to respond to the living weapon trigger on Batterskull with shock Stoneforge, destroy Batterskull seems insane."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,TheAmericanDragon,2,Fri Jun 19 14:32:46 2015 UTC,Why would you need to respond to the living weapon trigger?
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,jboons,3,Fri Jun 19 16:26:08 2015 UTC,"You don't ""need to"" per se, but it would be best to do it in the scenario I outlined as soon as possible."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,TheAmericanDragon,5,Fri Jun 19 16:47:37 2015 UTC,"I guess I get it, since they're probably doing it EOT and could untap and possibly respond if you did it on their turn, put another equipment in, or something like that."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,jboons,2,Fri Jun 19 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they're going to be flashing in Skull on turn three in their best case scenario, so you don't want them having 3 mana to bounce Batterskull during their own turn. It isn't the most mana efficient on your side, but a 2-for-1 is still a 2-for-1."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,TheAmericanDragon,2,Fri Jun 19 17:24:58 2015 UTC,"you still don't need to respond to the living weapon trigger in this scenario though, as you will receive priority again after the trigger resolves."

MTGLegacy,3aeftn,Maxtortion,6,Fri Jun 19 23:26:18 2015 UTC,"Maverick feels like the better ""getting into legacy"" deck, because it runs up to a playset of stoneforges, a playset of wastelands, and several other legacy staples. If you want to eventually play a deck like stoneblade, that's something to consider. The deck is a blast. There's a visceral joy in wastelanding somebody out of the game and then swinging ten with a KotR. That being said, the deck packs a lot of nombos that take some getting used to (teeg, Thalia, and GsZ come to mind)"
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,Cr0c0d1le,2,Fri Jun 19 15:23:41 2015 UTC,"Isn't Jund a 4 Wasteland, 4 Goyf deck?  If he wants to upgrade later, it will be influenced by what he want to build toward, but I'm pretty sure Jund has more staples in the 75."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,Dat_Gentleman,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:35:09 2015 UTC,"I thought jund was in the 2-3 wasteland category. He said he already has the goyfs/bobs/lilies, so I'd say it kinda depends on what he wants to build. Stoneblade is closer to maverick, while bug is closer to Jund."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,Cr0c0d1le,3,Fri Jun 19 17:03:01 2015 UTC,"Either deck is a good choice because either way, you are playing legacy. :) The reason I went with Maverick is because I absolutely love the way the deck plays. I've been playing it straight for 2 years now, and I actually love the deck more now than when I started (as a goblins player). I've learned a lot about legacy by playing this deck. It really rewards you for playing tight, smart magic. You can customize it a bunch of different ways, and you get to tune it a lot depending on the meta you are expecting to play against. Every deck has it's weakness, and this deck does as well, but you have a fighting chance against everything. Here's my current list, check it out. http://tappedout.net/mtg-decks/mavey/. I also really really suggest going with the Dark Depths/Thespian's Stage combo. I've won a lot of games with that combo that I probably should not have."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,endlesswurm,2,Fri Jun 19 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Hey there. Let's compare them bit by bit...  In the current normal metagame, maverick is better off. The small bit of hatebears and other disruptive creatures gives it an advantage versus the several decks commonly seen as getting high placements.  In terms of price, if you already have the expensive cards, it depends on whether you want [[chains of mephistopheles]] or not.  I think instead of giving you a flat answer I am going to ask you the usual questions: A) What is the metagame like where you are going to play? B) What do you like playing in terms of decks, as in, how do you draw enjoyment from the game?  Jund as a deck focuses much more on inevitability and each card coming from the deck having a high impact or generating card advantage (which discard does as well).  I personally would be more likely to build maverick as it stands right now, but both are not a choice I'd make."

MTGLegacy,3aeftn,MTGCardFetcher,2,Fri Jun 19 15:30:07 2015 UTC,"I've been playing jund recently and I love it! I'm in a meta full of miracles, 3 color delver, and not too many combo decks which is perfect.  Being able to play a turn 3 bloodbraid elf and cascading into a Liliana or a hymn just seems too good.  If you like 2 for 1's this is the deck for you!"
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,papadrag0n13,2,Fri Jun 19 15:59:59 2015 UTC,Maverick lets you build towards some Stoneblade builds with the white cards you have. Jund lets you build towards BUG.  I put Jund on the backburner when Treasure Cruise ran rampant as my discard just fueled their ancestrals. If you play the Punishing version however and the meta is overly fair this deck will make people cry with your recurring removal.  Maverick is quite flexible though depending on your splash color. I've seen people splash red for a punishing fire build but if you did that I would just recommend playing Punishing Jund. Or using Knight of the Reliquary for the Depths-Stage Combo.  Both decks however have lousy combo matchups. Maverick might have it slightly better as white is pretty much a great color for SB hate cards.
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,MCSpacy,2,Fri Jun 19 19:10:09 2015 UTC,"Jund and Maverick are similar in that they are non-Blue fair decks but play differently and have very different strengths.   Playing either deck means you're willing to straight up lose some percentage of games to combo, but the same time, their weakness to combo overall is sometimes overstated. I suspect Maverick is ""better"" in current, combo-heavy metas due to permanent-based hate like Gaddock Teeg and Ethersworn Canonist being better against Dig than discard is, plus having access to Karakas. At the same time, Miracles is huge as well, and Jund has a much better Miracles matchup than Maverick (and better fair matchups overall I believe).  The best way to find out for yourself is to proxy each deck and play them against other popular decks to see which style you prefer. It might also be worth considering what decks you expect to play against in local metas. I would lean on Maverick being the better choice to start, which is what I started with. While it is a difficult deck to master and can be unforgiving to play mistakes, the toolbox/hatebear nature of the deck provides a good avenue for learning about many of the format's key interactions."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,syntaxr,2,Fri Jun 19 21:13:17 2015 UTC,"If you're playing legacy alongside modern, then just build jund for both. Lots of overlap, that's what I currently do.  Eventually you can expand to adding the modern legal Wx hatebears and be in a Dark Maverick, RBGW Maverick, or cut it down to WG Maverick (original style) or even just a BW or BG version. It gives you the most reasonable cards to brew around with while also giving a strong and stable base of cards for Modern.  edit: oh also if you have a lot of miracles grinders in your shop, the jund vs miracles match up is an actual joy. and delver is fun but in a different way."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,boxian,2,Fri Jun 19 23:30:37 2015 UTC,Maverick all the way. You should be playing with Thespian stage combo. It lets you race decks like ANT etc and is often just way better than trying to win with Knight like you used to.
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,Tharen101,2,Sat Jun 20 07:33:32 2015 UTC,"Maverick is better positioned right now, and isn't as prone to meta shifts as Jund is. This is because Maverick has more answers to stuff than Jund.  I would play Maverick in a heartbeat."
MTGLegacy,3aeftn,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Mon Jun 22 00:29:10 2015 UTC,"Depends on the build of Maverick you go with but there aren't too many expensive cards in it that aren't liquid staples. Saying that, getting the pieces for Jund will likely be better in the long run. But, it also depends on your definition of liquid staples. I've heard some folks refer to the non-blue duals as considerably harder to get rid of. In that light, neither deck will offer much transferability to Tier 1 decks. Savannahs aren't used in much else, Taiga and Badlands aren't used much in anything else. Bayou will be the most likely card to transfer over to another deck (BUG).  As for which deck is better is hard to say. They both have bad combo matchups. Jund relies on discard, Maverick relies on Thalia and hatebears. Unfortunately, Gaddock Teeg is the only green hatebear that GSZ grabs. This is why a lot of Maverick lists splash black and run Thoughtseize as a 3-4 of in the sideboard. Punishing Jund really punishes a lot of the fair decks out there (notably DnT, Maverick, Merfolk, some Delver lists). It's game plan is so proactive that it's able to easily take on some of the weird brews out there too.  I will say that I really, really enjoy playing Maverick. It has so many interesting/fun lines of play against a lot of the decks. The feel bads from losing to a few of the other popular decks because you have no real game against them (in vicinity of 80:20 in their favor) forced me to move on to other decks. Some folks like to roll the dice and hope they avoid specific parts of the meta, I prefer to run a deck that at least has some game against damn near everything."

MTGLegacy,3ai1cc,Manaplease,2,Sat Jun 20 13:51:48 2015 UTC,Been following the evolution of this deck for a while. Daze is an interesting touch.
MTGLegacy,3acxtk,USERP131,8,Fri Jun 19 02:26:36 2015 UTC,"I have it, but I rarely play it competitively. Something to note is that there are a lot of interactions in the deck, stuff that you won't be able to easily see just by looking at the deck lists. It's not like oops, all spells where you can see ""A turns into B turns into C turns into win"". E.g. you can therapy an empty hand to get something into the graveyard if you need (Genesis, triggers for Recurring Nightmare), or use Phyrexian Tower to avoid STP. Those are probably bad examples, but you kind of get the point."
MTGLegacy,3acxtk,jvLin,5,Fri Jun 19 04:50:03 2015 UTC,"This is especially true with the Junk and Birthing Pod versions.

MTGLegacy,3acxtk,Haydeeez,3,Fri Jun 19 04:58:48 2015 UTC,I love that Nic Fit seems to be the only shell that Birthing Pod fits in these days (for similar reasons that I love Survival decks in Vintage). Lots of sweet things can happen with that card.
MTGLegacy,3acxtk,RedeNElla,7,Fri Jun 19 08:55:35 2015 UTC,Play [[Veteran Explorer]]. Sacrifice it to Cabal Therapy or Phyrexian Tower. Get basic lands. Play big creatures. Attack.
MTGLegacy,3acxtk,gibbousm,6,Fri Jun 19 04:32:59 2015 UTC,"Basically this. Vet Explorer lets you play threats that other creature decks normally couldn't cast on-time with you. Their 2-drops are your 4-drops and so on. You use the mana to utilize Green Sun's Zenith early, control the board with Abrupt Decay, Maelstom Pulse, and Pernicious Deed (as the main one), and play big threats like Thrun on 4, Thragtusk on 5, and Titans on 6 (among other things). A Deed pop for 3 will most often kill their board while leaving yours intact.  Nic Fit has more flavors and variants than probably any other Legacy deck. Punishing Fit, Junk Fit, Pod Fit, Pox Fit, Nic Fit Superfriends, goes on and on. All strong in their own ways."

MTGLegacy,3acxtk,MTGCardFetcher,5,Fri Jun 19 04:33:12 2015 UTC,"I've played all sorts of Nic fit variants at smaller events and here's a bit of stream-of-consciousness crash course.    The most important factor to winning with nicfit is Cabal Therepy. You must be good at the blind therepy to be sucessful. Not hitting a card is fine, but naming the ""wrong"" card is not.  The rule of thumb for blind therepy is name Brainstorm.  Biffing a brainstorm (meaning naming something else when they hold a brainstorm) makes your flasback an issue.  When building the deck 30 cards are very rigid, 22 lands, 4 explorers, 4 therepy.  The other 30 cards can be almost anything under the sun.  Explorer combo is very forgiving on mana contraints, so putting together the second half of the deck is a bit of a puzzle.  Also its a hard deck to ""net deck"" because its power is mostly in its ability to flex to cover your meta.  First pick a general theme that will work in your meta: sweepers + planeswalkers for fair creature decks, white splash hatebears for combo, gsz fairbears, scapeshift combo, pod value, pod combo, nightmare etb triggery dudes... Then pick your removal, selection and tutors, and then lastly all your win-con stuff.  That way youre not skimping removal because you put in too much ""fun stuff"".  Have some sort of combo-ish finish. When you have 6-7 mana, you want something in your deck to really hit the enemy hard. This isn't standard so have something that either combos off or lets you spend all your mana to gain advantage (for example recurring nightmare or tassigur).  The deck sometimes loses to itself, therefore try and include some sort of fixing.  Brainstorm is great in nic fit, not only for the fixing but you can generally cut some lands if you run it. Other than that I try and run a couple sylvan library in nicfit every time, also top isnt bad esp if youre running crupix.  Finally cards like eternal witness and volrath's stronghold can be counted as ""fixing"" assuming your not worried about drs."

I generally try and fit 2 libraries in the deck plus another 3-4 of fixer. Brainstorm is far and away the best fixer, but it pushes your manabase (as you end up with 4 brainstorms, 4 explorers, and 4 cabal therepy as different color turn 1 playe).  If brainstorm doesnt feel right then I either want top and/or to run multiple witnesses.   Because as pointed out above, sometimes library dies to deeds."

You also might want cards like [[Defense Grid]] or [[Grand Abolisher]] to stop your opponents from interacting on your turn.

One of my new favorite things to do is to play some legacy half smashed on a Saturday night. It's fantastic. I got beat down last week by a stifle naught deck and after both glorious games were over (he got me 2-0), I lifted my drink to the monitor and toasted that guy. I was happy as shit."

Is being able to play Legacy whenever you want on MTGO worth the price of the deck you want to you?    You can see which bots have cards for the cheapest prices on mtgowikiprice. You can also get more convenience by buying all the cards at once from MTGOTraders. Do whichever is better for you.  I don't actually know the answer to that. I've never heard of one.  Yeah, the bot system sucks. MTGOTraders is a lot easier, though not always cheapest.     I really wish I could just paste in a decklist, get a price, drop the cash and start playing   MTGOTraders basically lets you do that."

But wizards has a fiduciary responsibility to Hasbro to keep generating profit, and as long as mtgo costs next to nothing in upkeep and marginal costs per user,(hint: it always will, it's online) they have a steady stream of income. wizards also has a pretty good track record. the day they violate the reserved list you can start questioning the future value of all their product, until then it's fair to assume they are taking a long approach to it and respecting collectors."

Is there a third party place to get tickets from other than the in-client store (maybe cheaper)?    If I'm not mistaken this is against the ToS of the game, but yes, you can find it, in several places, but you might be ripped off.   Same question for acquiring cards... the bot/trade system looks like a nightmare to slog through   It IS a nightmare to slog through. It is however what we got.

Here is what I have as answers to your questions: - Best way to get into legacy on mtgo is to start buying the deck you want. If you need to price out the decks your looking at use http://www.mtggoldfish.com/tools/deck_pricer#online. This tool is great to find the cheapest vendor with the cards you are looking for.  -You can buy tickets from the store, from a bot, a user on mtgo or from ebay. Personally its not worth the risk to trade large sums with users or ebay so I just use the store but sometimes bots will have the tickets for less then $1 ~96-99cents. -Bots suck in some aspects but are great in others. You can try to scour the trade lists for specific cards to save a buck or two here from humans but this is extremely time consuming and you may not even save much. I like cardhoarder,mtgotraders and goatbots. Try to keep it down to 1-3 vendors so your saved credits will add up and you can buy the 1cent cards when you need them.  Also on mtggoldfish you can drop a decklist in get a price and click to buy. It will send you to the vendor who can help. I dont use this function but if your so inclined by all means go for it.   I know some people complain about the mtgo coding and bugs but personally I rarely experience issues with MTGO and I get to join competitive tournaments anytime of the day/night or just play for fun against reasonable decks."

MTGLegacy,3a89rr,SamoJamo,2,Thu Jun 18 15:58:41 2015 UTC,"Here's a significant factor that I don't think anyone in here addressed: where do you live and at what times can you play based on your lifestyle? You should evaluate the daily event schedule and see how feasible it is for you to regularly play in them. As an east-coaster who works ""traditional office hours,"" I've been growing increasingly frustrated with the daily event schedule, since 5pm (Mon/Tue) is impossible, 11pm (Wed/Thu) is too late, and 6pm (Wed/Thu) is close, but requires a lot of luck with getting out of the office early AND getting all the breaks on my commute home. Sometimes I'll suck it up and play the 10pm on Mon/Tue and just accept that I'm going to be tired the next morning, but it's really miserable not having anything between Mon-Thu with a start time between 6:30pm-9pm. Sure, you can play in two-man queues whenever, but once they stop paying out MM2 packs for prizes, you want to stay as far away from them as possible (when they pay out in Standard-legal packs, the MODO economy is often fucked up to the point that the prize payout is less than the entry... as in the entry for one person, not the combined entry for both players)"

I play legacy online because it is way more affordable and I get to do it much more often, that's what ""worth it"" means to me. The competition is also very good, people like Bahra, Julian23, Boky and Lejay play often in the daily events, playing against the best is how you get better, right?   The trading / bot system is fine, the bigger chains are cardhoarders, mtgotraders, and goatbots. Cardhoarders have pretty much every card, but sometimes the other two can have something they don't or provide better prices. Mtgowikiprice is a website I use to track down specific cards, it tells you which bots have them, how much etc and is updated frequently.   Mtggoldfish is another website I use to track online price movement and how much individual decks are. If you don't already have an idea, that's a good place to start, and they even have links to the bot websites where you can add all the cards to your cart and checkout very easily.   In the client you can import deck lists from text format, as long as the are formatted like:    4x maindeck 4x maindeck 2x maindeck ... etc    1x sideboard 1x sideboard etc    And then in a trade you can search the bot for all those cards at once, as long as they are part of a deck list you have. If the bot has them they will show up.   I don't know if any of this means that Legacy on MTGO is worth it though. Hopefully this answers some of your questions."
MTGLegacy,3a56gq,yespair,9,Wed Jun 17 08:56:39 2015 UTC,It feels like most of the white cards in the main are too cute. They also make you better against already favorable matchups. Upping the blue count and adding forces instead (if possible)  should improve your matchups.  Instead of going the FoW route you could also mainboard at least a teeg + maybe a meddling mage/thalia/canonist as both are versatile and easily fetchable with pod
MTGLegacy,3a56gq,Apocolyps6,2,Wed Jun 17 09:42:35 2015 UTC,"I do have a playset FoW laying around in a binder, so that would be possible I guess. But then you're speaking about taking away Stoneforge (+Batterskull), Kitchen Finks, Academy Rector and Siege Rhino?  I guess Stoneforge + Batterskull could easily be replaced. The Rector though? Hmm. From my experiences it's usually to strong when tutoring either Recurring Nightmare, Pernicious Deed or any of the sideboard cards. I've tried running Canonist maindeck in some builds, but it doesn't rhyme to well with Recurring Nightmare so there are many matchups in which it's just a no-impact 2drop for feeding the pod. I guess with FoWs that would be different though, being able to counter their only spell for the turn and it would definetely up some of the combo matches.  Could you precis more what changes you would do to fit 3 FoW and up the bluecount?  -1 Stoneforge Mystic -1 Batterskull -1 Kitchen Finks  That's 3 cards to fit the FoW.. But as for upping the bluecount? I guess moving up to 4 Brainstorms is a neat move, but at the same time I don't want to go much lower on the creature count."
MTGLegacy,3a56gq,Apocolyps6,2,Wed Jun 17 10:12:55 2015 UTC,"You currently have 7 blue cards. The minimum for playing FoW is something like 17.   When I briefly played BUGw pod I had along with my mb teeg: 3 strix 1 edric 1 glen elandra 1 image 3 brainstorm in the mainboard and  : 1 Glen Elendra Archmage 4 Force of Will 2 Envelop 3 Riptide Pilferer 1 Venser, Shaper Savant in the board  (btw this was David Gleicher's list)  That is up to 18 blue cards in postboard games. That's a pretty big commitment in terms of sideboard space leaving you with only 4 nonblue slots. It was not a problem for me because I felt like I needed very little help in the fair matchups. The 4 slots were ~4 pieces of removal as that was what my main lacked the most.   What this would mean is that you'd have to cut rector as that package is huge and rely on your 4 mainboard gravehate cards more.   With Nic Fit there is infinite temptation to get cute because the shell can support so much cuteness, but I actually think the threshold for ""non-staple""/cute cards is lower than people think it is."

Sure you CAN do it, but it makes you a little unfocused.   Tacking on to someone else, you don't need/can't afford FoW with that few blue. I tried it in a relatively blue deck and it wasn't great. I have 4 thoughtseize that replaced them in the side and they work great for my combo matchups.  Here's my list. It's done pretty well for me so far. Combo isn't ever fun to see, but against most ""fair"" decks it wrecks face.  Edit: for combo, I side in a lot more disruption. 4 thoughtseize, 2 extraction. Teeg comes in to gsz/pod or deathrite for it too. But tbh I'm thinking of dropping him, or adding a W source in the seventy five. Either a basic plains or a Savannah.

Ive had more than one game where i was able to recur thragtusk/grave titan off of each other multiple times and it just doesn't get better than that. I do think you can live without for awhile. Maybe add another good gsz target/three drop till you get it. The three drop spot in this deck is sad.  I don't think you need a fourth pod, I've found that three is enough, the deck works without it being a ""for sure"" card, and I really don't like seeing it too early or in multiples.

I played this build at a few $5 events and it was super fun to play, and impressively resilient.  Anyway below is a copy/paste from a post I did on another thread....  I ran a version of the deck that was pretty interesting. It was GBUW, running something like:  4 brainstorm  3 pod  2 Recurring Nightmare  3-4 Satyr Wayfinder  2-3 Tassigur  1 each: Deceiver Exarch, Eternal witness, Siege Rhino, Academy Rector, Revielark, Palinchron  So the idea was something like this: 1) get 6-7 lands in play and pod  2) pod out wayfinder -> exarch, untap pod exarch -> rector. Go.  3) untap pod out rector -> Revielark + Nightmare (both in play with rector trigger). This should do some work because revielark death + nightmare you can return 3 things including wayfinder to make a land drop and/or explorers and importantly your exarch to untap pod. Now recast nightmare and return the revilark sacing the exarch. Pod revilark -> tassigur, returning exarch untapping pod. Pod tassigur -> palinchron. Untap 7 lands.  ... Now you win! With 7 lands, planichron, nightmare you have infinite mana and infinite creature triggers... So you can mill your whole deck with either wayfinder or tassigur until you hit your rhino and then kill with infinite rhino triggers. Thats the ""hardest"" way to combo... With therepy on rector and some extra mana you can 1-turn the combo. Also you can really short-cut things with a tassigur in hand because you can go immediately to pod -> pallinchron. Also in general wayfinder and brainstorm make things smooth."

Deed is great in the planeswalker heavy nic fit decks (so I'm told) but here you are gonna have a couple strixes or whatever hanging out and have no walkers to protect. You are actually fine with the creature stalls. Turning every fetch while flooding into potential dudes for pod can be pretty big."

I'm pretty convinced, from both personal experience and recent results, that GS vastly outclasses traditional ANT in this metagame, despite it's somewhat less intuitive gameplan.  Other than that, it's nice to see the older style of BURG Delver still floating around (basically BUG with Bolts), though I'm not sure what advantages it has over Pyromancer lists.  Also, my bad, that's actually Deathblade, not Esper. I got excited for a second."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Maxtortion,5,Tue Jun 16 22:24:05 2015 UTC,"Other than that, it's nice to see the older style of BURG Delver still floating around (basically BUG with Bolts), though I'm not sure what advantages it has over Pyromancer lists.   The European BURG (Castlevania) lists typically go heavier green to be able to maindeck 2 Abrupt Decay. This makes it stronger against Miracles, which the Young Pyromancer versions of the deck are typically weaker against. This also opens up the Gitaxian Probe slots, allowing the deck to play some number of Spell Pierce / Thoughtseize / whatever floats your boat. As should be clear from the lists that Top 8'd, there isn't a clear consensus on where the deck should be, exactly, only that TNN and DTT are powerful cards."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Maxtortion,1 point,Tue Jun 16 23:43:10 2015 UTC,"I was always under the impression that the URBg variants of Delver were already pretty strong against Miracles. Having access to Decay is certainly a plus, but Tarmogoyf is a far worse threat than Pyromancer in the matchup. I suppose I haven't played BURG since sometime in early fall, so I'm really sure about it's strength these days."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,thexlastxlegacy,2,Tue Jun 16 23:53:48 2015 UTC,"It got a bit weaker against Miracles when Stifle came out. It's not an unwinnable matchup or anything, but it's not something that I look forward to facing."

MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,thexlastxlegacy,2,Wed Jun 17 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"""Burg"" means ""Castle"" in German, and the deck has a German origin.  It started off looking a lot more like a mashup between RUG and BUG Delver, with the threatbase being 4 Delver, 3 DRS, 3-4 Nimble Mongoose, and 2-3 Tarmogoyf. The removal suite has been a fairly consistent 4 Bolts and 2 Abrupt Decay. This version went full-out on the mana-denial strategy, running 4 Stifles, letting them double as a way to protect your own greedy 18-land manabase from opposing Wastelands."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,wintermute93,2,Wed Jun 17 20:52:35 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the response! That makes sense. ""Castlevania"" is such a better name than ""BURG Delver"". My modern port has been really fun lately so I'm definitely going to start calling it that."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,wintermute93,2,Wed Jun 17 21:25:23 2015 UTC,"ANT players: I highly recommend trying out Vonasek's or Wagner's GS variants   I keep seeing people praising the GS plan, and I'm finally going to give it a shot. My current list is pretty stock, 15 lands, 4/3 Therapy/Duress, 1 Ad Nauseam, 1 Tendrils, 2 Past in Flames, 2 Preordain, and playsets of the other obvious 7 cards.   Would you recommend just -1 Ad Nauseam +1 Tendrils, or going up to 3 maindeck Tendrils? If 3, what's the other card to cut? Swapping both Preordains for a Top seems reasonable if you're explicitly going for a longer game. I don't run Grim Tutor and never plan on buying one, if it makes a difference.  Also, I didn't get a chance to watch the coverage of this event, but... is the 3 sideboard Iona in one of those ANT lists a mistake? Unless that's there specifically to hold in your hand and laugh at Omni-tell, I'm not sure what's going on there. Also also, ANT sideboarding into SI/Emrakul Doomsday?! This is madness!"
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Timiniel,2,Wed Jun 17 02:47:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Europeans are crazy :D the Ionas seem like overkill honestly, I think the matchup is fine with Flusters + K.grip out of the board.   The Doomsday plan is probably a nod to the metric fuckton of bullshit we have to deal with out of Miracles these days. CB on 3 is hard to hit, and it dodges MM, Clique (potentially), Canonist, and all of their countermagic post-DD. Still a little crazy though.  I haven't honestly been a huge fan of 3 Tendrils, but if you're playing against a ton of Miracles it's probably decent. Cutting the AN for the second should be fine. I'd also definitely recommend cutting at least one of the Preordains for a Top.  Also not sure on your manabase, but I'd recommend the badlands if you're not already playing it. 2 red sources is pretty necessary with double PiF I think."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Timiniel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, thanks! I'll try out -1 AN -1 Preordain +1 Tendrils +1 Top at my next event.  My manabase is a bit screwy at the moment since I recently sold all of my Tarns/Mistys, but I went up to a second Volcanic Island to compensate. 2 Sea, 2 Volc, 1 Island, 1 Swamp, 4 Delta, 1 Trop, 1 Bayou -- with a Bayou in there I know the other four fetches should be Misty, but at the moment I've got 3 Strand and 1 Mire. Is there a good way of fitting a Badlands in there with no Zendikar fetches?  Edit: wait, hang on, that's 16 lands. I'm not sure what my manabase is off the top of my head, then. Maybe I just cut the Bayou and put 4 Strand in there. A second green is nice, but at least it means my fetches aren't all messed up."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Timiniel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:10:00 2015 UTC,"Probably not, though 2 Volcs is honestly fine, since it's the one you're fetching 95% of the time."

MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Timiniel,1 point,Wed Jun 17 11:29:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's any clunkier when piloted correctly. I think the biggest notable difference is against DRS decks, Elves in particular, since you have no access to AN game 1 and can't take the time to sculpt a natural Tendrils."

It could be my own inexperience with the version, but as sad as this is, and trust me it pains me to say this, but I missed ad nauseam G1..."
MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,milesrout,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:16:32 2015 UTC,"BUG is definitely worse, but it's a pretty tough matchup no matter what.

That is exactly where I noticed the most difference, as I couldn't simply try to power out an ad nauseam win pre-thalia, and throwing out 2x tendrils is much harder when we are mana constrained. In fact, this is the only matchup where I can tell you flat out that I prefer having AN mainboard."

T2 percentage was slightly higher for his list than ANT's. Even if you're not playing Empty (I think he had like 3 Empty kills in the 60 games), the GS win percentage was only slightly lower on T2.

So the most relevant consideration is how fast you can goldfish them. That's why I brought up Slosh's testing.   If we're assuming that you manage to strip their Thalia, then GS is still better positioned, since there's no GY hate to worry about, and AN isn't as reliable when you're being put on a clock."

MTGLegacy,3a3cmu,Angelbaka,8,Tue Jun 16 23:19:59 2015 UTC,"Grinding Station refers to an old storm strategy against blue decks that relied on having Tendrils in hand, then dumping your hand on the board, forcing your opponent to fight your spells and build storm, finishing them off with a natural tendrils.   The name has been picked back up recently as a way to describe the Storm lists that forgo Ad Nauseam and play 2 Past in Flames, 2-3 Tendrils, and the occasional Empty (as ANT is even less accurate of a name than it is already)."

MTGLegacy,3a49gl,Angelbaka,5,Wed Jun 17 07:29:22 2015 UTC,I honestly think they'll ban omniscience before either of the other two. Free spells are always broken.
MTGLegacy,3a49gl,magictgmike,3,Wed Jun 17 19:14:25 2015 UTC,Omniscience is the real issue with the deck.  Sneak and Show is a much easier to interact with deck than a deck that can cast all spells in the game for free.

The thing I don't like about Stifle and Port is that they ask you to not spend you mana on other things.  With fish, your ideal plan is to play Vial, and then start deploying guys with Vial AND by casting them.  This will often use all your mana.  FoW and Daze let you do stuff while you're spending all your mana every turn to cast more Merfolk, or beat in with Mutavault.  If you're itching to try the Port and Stifle plan, you should definitely go ahead and give it a try, but I think you'll get more wins by spending your mana on dealing damage with creatures."
MTGLegacy,3a1ppj,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Tue Jun 16 15:50:32 2015 UTC,Yea I understand. Stile + Port maybe too much devoted to mana denial. But I feel like stifle is just as much as a temp card as daze/Force. Yes I can't play it for free like them but it accomplishes some of the same things.

MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,TheGreatLummy,10,Tue Jun 16 18:02:42 2015 UTC,"None of the cards in black are better than Red Blasts. It sounds nuts, but that's the truth.  EE goes to 3 with any splash color, so that doesn't matter.  Discard is not good when you're planning for the game to go very long, and is a horrible draw later.  Notion Thief is OK I guess? I certainly wouldn't want it over anything I'm playing now.  LDV is slow, doesn't actually draw a card, and costs life. I'd rather just play Top, Brainstorm, Ponder and Dig Through Time without splashing anything.  Enchantress is a tough matchup but very winnable - you need to focus on not letting them put an enchantress effect on the board (either the actual Enchantress or Presence). This means countering GSZ or either enchantress effect. Terminus and Council's Judgment both get rid of the creature after it is in play as well. Without a draw engine, the deck is pretty bad to be honest. 60% against a bad matchup is pretty reasonable. You'll get more by just playing well. - I can talk more about boarding and playing this matchup, but I'd say its close to 50/50 depending on the Enchantress player's draw.  Merfolk can be irritating, but the Elves matchup is great and Sneak Attack is usually not too bad.  At the end of the day, if you want to win at your local meta, maybe black is where you want to be - but don't expect that to carry over into any larger events or anything outside that store."

Probably Dig) +1 Engineered Explosives +1 Wear // Tear +2 Ethersworn Canonist (stops them from having explosive turns) +1 Counterspell (better on the play, but usually fine regardless) +1 Supreme Verdict (If you're not bringing in men)   Try to keep them off of an enchantress effect via counterspells, Terminus, and Canonist. Counterbalance is better than you might assume - the real threats are all 2s and 3s. They really only have 10ish Enchantresses even with GSZ, so if you stop the first two and win quickly, that usually does it.   Watch out for the splash color - they might have Blood Moon.

MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,Ganthamus_prime,5,Tue Jun 16 23:42:14 2015 UTC,"Miracles is more of a reactive deck that plays on their opponents turns, that being said the only spells you really cast on your turn is t1 top. Yes thoughtseize is good, but also spell piercing their spell works just as well.  I've seen some miracles splash black but it's simply not as good as the red splash. It really comes down to percantages and what you're more likely to see, youre more likely to see a bunch of blue decks than enchantress so focus on those match ups. REB has a high chance to get blue spell/permanent because of all the blue in the format without losing 2 life, also wear//tear is sick with counterbalance. Izzet static caster is also better vs a young pyromamcer builds. If your meta has a lot of enchantress decks then maybe running black is the answer, also think about running clique to disrupt their choice spells."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,alphastryk,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:14:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah in a more ""normal"" metagame I feel like red is the splash you want. That being sad, REB only really gets Merfolk in my metagame, and my matchup against them hasn't really been horrible. I already run 2 Clique and it works when you get it out, but turn 3 can be too little too late in alot of Enchantress matches. Spell Pierce has been okay, but it does nothing against Elves and Merfolk, while Thoughtseize (though obviously not ideal) does at least something. It also requires significantly less conditions for it to be good.  Like I said, I'm not disagreeing with you, but the main reasons why red is good just don't do anything for me."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,cromonolith,2,Tue Jun 16 18:21:37 2015 UTC,What's your meta like? Honestly miracles might not be the best deck to play. Also how do you feel about engineered explosives?  In a 3 color deck it can easily hit most of enchantress's spells. Maybe toss an Academy ruins in there.
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,simdude,1 point,Tue Jun 16 21:23:46 2015 UTC,"EE is great, Academy has been okay for me but by the time I can get it going it's generally too late. Might be good though.  Meta is generally Elves, Merfolk, Sneak and Show, and Enchantress. Not sure why the latter is a thing but it is."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,TheSicknessX,1 point,Wed Jun 17 03:45:58 2015 UTC,"Spell Pierce (and even Flusterstorm) are actually better than you think vs Elves. They often need to use GSZ and Natural Order (some players leave Glimpse in as well), and pierce hits the hate they bring in like Null Rod and Pithing Needle."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,Skelegro93,5,Tue Jun 16 19:33:17 2015 UTC,"Enchantress is just a horrible matchup for Miracles. Possibly second-worst after 12 Post. I don't think it's easy to fix that without significant changes.   As to your points:   Miracles doesn't need targeted discard like that. You'd much rather sit back and counter their relevant threats rather than try to take them out of their hand.  EE is great, and many Miracles decks include one in the sideboard. You already can have it set to 3 since you're definitely splashing red in Miracles.  Notion Thief is way too gimmicky. Again, you'd rather just sit back and react to their threats. Vendilion Clique is a much better creature in this sort of role.  Meh. Vault is okay, but non-RIP/Helm Miracles decks don't really need tutoring outside of Dig Through Time. We already see most of our deck every game.    But yeah, the Enchantress matchup is a total mess. You have to kill or counter every one of the Enchantress effects as quickly as possible. If they sit in play and your opponent draws several cards off them, you're not going to win that game. I would just load up on a few extra Wear/Tears and Council's Judgments and EEs if I were you. You could also play something like Serenity.   It's also worth noting that the Legends build is probably better against Enchantress. Vensering their enchanted lands and casting Vendilion Clique a bunch of times can be helpful."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,twndomn,3,Tue Jun 16 18:22:44 2015 UTC,"As others have mentioned Enchantress vs. Miracles is a good matchup for the enchantress player, but I'm rather shocked that you're metagame is heavy enough on it for it to be a concern.  If you really wanted to tune the deck to be better against Enchantress I played against a UW control deck the other day I felt was a better matchup than the typical miracles build. Basically without red your deck doesn't have dead bolts or REB against enchantress and gets to run additional countermagic. Plus that deck sided into RIP/Helm to turn it into a combo deck which is again, much much harder for Enchantress to deal with. Maybe try having that in the sideboard. I'd also say that Containment Priest sounds good in your meta. Most enchantress decks run Green Sun and it is additionally good against Natural Order from Elves and the entire Sneak and Show deck. Again this is tuning for a very very specific meta though. I don't think Priest is all that great in the larger scene where Omnitell is a much more common variant than S&S now.   In a real setting I'd just say win your early rounds because Enchantress is far weaker against an open field than Miracles and you're likely to never even see the deck."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,Traggy,1 point,Wed Jun 17 01:20:37 2015 UTC,You're right about the Containment Priest in my meta. Oh my god it's great.  You would actually be shocked by how much Enchantress is in my meta. By far the worst matchup that I see on a consistent basis.
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,legorockman,3,Wed Jun 17 03:47:54 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest I've thought the same time being a new-ish Miracles player, but as others have stated; red makes a much better splash; the blasts are great in the overall meta of legacy atm with delver and agent decks being as popular as they are.  In addition; the discard is good for a combo win in a quick deck,  but Miracles wins with the slow game so Liliana or the hymm/inquisition aren't better."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,toletole,2,Wed Jun 17 03:36:20 2015 UTC,"You could bring in meddling mage and name Rip or helm. As for emrakul, you can hope to rely on terminus but karakas unfortunately undoes that plan"
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,MelonJuice7,2,Wed Jun 17 07:35:07 2015 UTC,"Thoughtseize/Inquisition is Horrible in Miracles. You are a Esper Stoneblade pretending to be Miracles if you do this.  You can set EE at 3 by spashing Red AND you enjoy the Red Blast effect. EE is not a reason. You have Terminus to deal with TNN.  Vault has no place.  Overall, there're only 2 cards worthy of splashing: Notion Thief and Engineered Plague. Thief can single-handly destroy Shardless BUG, Plague is perfect against Vial decks.  If you care so much about Enchantress, just run More [[Council's Judgement]] and [[Pyroclasm]]. There, problem solved. No Black needed."
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,MelonJuice7,1 point,Tue Jun 16 19:01:31 2015 UTC,When you splash red you can get explosives to three.  I fail to see your point on this unless you are playing without a slash currently.
MTGLegacy,3a2c8d,ReallyForeverAlone,1 point,Wed Jun 17 13:25:57 2015 UTC,"When people were brewing with Miracles originally, they splashed black for Vindicate and even when people made the move to the red splash the Esperanto decks were still popular enough. But now that we have Council's Judgement there's no real point. Discard is okay but not what Miracles is doing. I'd rather T1 Ponder or Top. I have some people try out Lingering Souls but Mentor is better now that it exists."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,skterran,28,Tue Jun 16 11:37:37 2015 UTC,"The answer is definitely Delver. It is the best, almost indisputably.  But people put FAR too much emphasis on this subreddit on what the 'best' Legacy decks are. That's relevant if you're going to GPs and SCG opens and hoping to win money, but honestly it's almost entirely irrelevant otherwise.   Legacy is a format where virtually everything works."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,milesrout,10,Tue Jun 16 11:48:24 2015 UTC,"Legacy is a format where virtually everything works.   Well ... when I can name 40 of the ""most popular archetypes"" off the top of my head I know what you mean, but possibility space is always more expansive than we give it credit for. I'm skeptical about, say, Gorgon Tribal, and there's a lot more ideas like this than ones that work."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,RELcat,12,Tue Jun 16 12:37:00 2015 UTC,"Honestly in most local metagames the vast majority of players, almost certainly including every non-pro in this subreddit (there are a couple I think) would get FAR more benefit out of playing more, learning the ins and outs of their deck, and generally getting better at the game than playing whatever the 'best' daze/wasteland/fow deck is.  Merfolk is a competitively viable deck. It doesn't have the percentages to win an SCG Open except by luck but it's MORE than capable of competing in basically any matchup. Legacy is, for the VAST majority of its players, a way to enjoy themselves and have fun playing interesting cards and interesting strategies in interesting decks.   Something like Merfolk can win a local 4-5 round tournament easily in the hands of a player that knows the deck. You can beat people that are reasonably comfortable with their tier 1 decks with a tier 2 deck any day if you know all the little interactions. That's what makes Legacy so interesting. It's so interactive."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,milesrout,3,Tue Jun 16 12:50:48 2015 UTC,I've phrased my question to be spikey because I tend to approach the hand that way. But I agree that legacy seems open enough that I can play whatever as long as I know my deck and my deck is actually trying to do something powerful.
MTGLegacy,3a117p,gcacul,2,Tue Jun 16 14:43:56 2015 UTC,I hope you meant Merfolk is a competitively vialable deck BD. But yes a Merfolk deck is definitely fast enough to win matches and even moreso when they know their matchups.
MTGLegacy,3a117p,milesrout,2,Tue Jun 16 15:58:39 2015 UTC,I hope you meant Merfolk is a competitively vialable deck BD.   It took me about five times reading this to see 'vialable' and to work out that BD was a smiley. :P
MTGLegacy,3a117p,xjguyma,2,Tue Jun 16 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"Totally agree on both counts. Delver variants are best with FoW & Wasteland.   Also agree that knowing your deck, it's matchups, your outs, your sideboarding strategies, will shave more percentage points off your win % (or loss % I guess) than playing the 'best deck' at a tournament.  This is of course not taking top level players into account (EFro, PVDDR, etc). They can bend the rules more than us mortals."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,TenspeedGames,2,Tue Jun 16 17:28:14 2015 UTC,Do you suppose there's a place for Burning Vengeance?
MTGLegacy,3a117p,milesrout,-6,Tue Jun 16 18:09:43 2015 UTC,"Hurr durr ""Legacy is a format where virtually everything works"" clearly means that literally every possible deck archetype in the history of the game is viable and not ""the format is and always has been fairly wide open""."

Maybe there's a build around BV, past in flames and something like pyromancer ascension with a bunch of rituals and fast mana, but it's still probably slower and weaker than just playing storm anyway.   No reason not to experiment with it if you're keen, though."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,TenspeedGames,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:27:35 2015 UTC,I had a scars/innistrad Standard format combo deck that could go off on turn 3 or 4 with a nut draw for an otk. Tried looking for strict upgrades in eternal formats but gave up after a while. I'll probably try again.

MTGLegacy,3a117p,Fallen_Akroma,1 point,Tue Jun 16 12:54:38 2015 UTC,4 color is just to greedy imo.  It's mana base is worse then deathblade and you have to run it at that because you are trying to pack so much good crap into 60 cards.

MTGLegacy,3a117p,griselbiscuit,3,Tue Jun 16 14:05:52 2015 UTC,"Infect is another solid deck that plays wasteland and force, but not a full set of each."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,twndomn,4,Tue Jun 16 18:01:50 2015 UTC,"Legacy awards best plays, tight plays, not best decks.  You can have any GP/SCG winner decks, that won't get you far if you don't put in enough hours."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,150crawfish,2,Tue Jun 16 18:33:47 2015 UTC,"If your talking about a full playset of each, delver. Delver takes it. Any variant really, they all do their own thing, its a matter of which suits your playstyle more."
MTGLegacy,3a117p,lord_mcdonalds,2,Tue Jun 16 17:12:15 2015 UTC,"It's not probably, or almost positive, Delver is the best waste+force strategy in the format, at that point, pick which flavor of delver you find the best and go (and you have plenty of options)  Personally I feel BUG delver is the best, but Grixis delver is supposedly good (no one locally really plays it so I'm just going off things I've heard with that)"
MTGLegacy,3a117p,keyboard_mash,2,Tue Jun 16 17:50:23 2015 UTC,"Only because nobody has mentioned it and everyone seems to be on the delver train, Shardless BUG is a pretty good deck, although it's also very pricey if you haven't got a lot of the pieces already."
MTGLegacy,3a1c0n,rumballtron,4,Tue Jun 16 13:32:03 2015 UTC,My guess is that you would probably want [[Sickening Dreams]] over Brain Freeze in the main because of Omnitell's popularity.

MTGLegacy,3a1c0n,berwald89,2,Tue Jun 16 15:30:47 2015 UTC,"You can also cut the [[City of Solitude]] and [[Zuran Orb]] in favor of other protection as well, or keep City of Solitude, cut the Pacts and Orb, and add the [[Orim's Chant]]s main deck, or add [[Defense Grid]], or cut the Cities and add [[Silence]].  The good thing about City and Defense Grid are they can be fetched by Enlightened Tutor if all you need is some counter bait and/or protection, but really anything that stops this from being a glass cannon would be good.  I wonder how the card disadvantage of FoW would be in this though?"
MTGLegacy,3a1c0n,MTGCardFetcher,2,Tue Jun 16 16:01:57 2015 UTC,"tbh i haven't gotten a ton of testing done, it was a few bucks to buy worms and shoals last week so i did. in practicality it might turn out FOW is unnecessary since you probably want it before you go for the shoal anyways, because if the effect of draw 15 cards is on the stack, it doesn't matter what is across the table, that player knows its counter it or die in legacy. so thoughtseize is just better in that case. now that i talk it through, it actually seems like FoW is a total safety net card, and i can go down to one, if i run it at all. that would leave a few proactive defense slots or tutor slots open."

MTGLegacy,39zvww,the3rdlegion,11,Tue Jun 16 03:19:44 2015 UTC,"Well the biggest factor is the degree of tempo you play at with each opponent. Rug decks leans heavily on tempo, where bug delver tempos games out far less often, and even more so with 4 color and jeskai delver. Thats mostly in relation with how many stifle and spell snares and spell pierces each deck plays, and the curve. Rug delver decks are super focused on playing a single threat (maybe 2) and putting you behind with their cheap/ free counters, and by setting you turns back with wasteland/ stifle. Bug jams hard to beat threats, attacks your hand/critters/graveyard and protects its own with soft counters. Jeskai plays resilient threats that enable a late game, but comes with great lack of synergy as its soft counters get worse as the game goes on. 4 color just jams the best spells of each color, plays the best dudes and has soft counters, but is super weak to land disruption and looses a lot of tempo game from its own daze effects. Grixis plays almost like rug, expect it plays bigger dudes but not nimble mongoose, and has hand disruption. in all seriousness, nimble mongoose is kind of a big deal.  Each deck is also has major advantages and disadvantages in thier sideboard mostly as such: White= Rest in peace and meddling mage Black= discard and more removal Green = sylvan library, sometimes more abrupt decays Red - pyro blasts, ancient grudge The playstyles are drastically different as well, which takes some amount of testing to get an understanding of. watch plenty of videos to see which each deck is about, as each plays drastically differently than the others."
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Ixadore,1 point,Tue Jun 16 03:54:46 2015 UTC,So which do you believe is the strongest? XD
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Ixadore,9,Tue Jun 16 04:41:05 2015 UTC,"I think, at the moment, Bug delver is the most well positioned, with the popular decks being Miracles, Omnishow, and death and taxes. Rug is close behind as it does well against combo and slow decks. I personally beleieve there is no reason to play jeskai delver. i think jeskai stoneblade or miracles takes a better role in late game decks, and rug/bug delver are better aggressive decks. 4 color is hit and miss with the land base, and grixis seems very popular and powerful."
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Ixadore,1 point,Tue Jun 16 04:44:50 2015 UTC,Is just flat out UR delver viable?
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Ixadore,2,Tue Jun 16 04:45:52 2015 UTC,"Again, not my specialty, but from experience, i think burn is just a turn or 2 faster, and the disruption there is not powerful enough to compete with the better combo decks. Its basically a burn deck with better creatures and less variance, but I honestly think its just worse than burn, because its trying to go on 2 plans instead of just sticking with 1."

I would cut the 3rd Spell Pierce for a 4th FoW in the main, turn the 2 Disfigures into 2 Thoughtseizes, and cut 1 Bob for the 4th Abrupt Decay."
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Shocked439,1 point,Tue Jun 16 05:38:53 2015 UTC,I disagree on the thoughtsiezes. They don't fit into the main of a reactive mana denial plan.
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Umezete,1 point,Tue Jun 16 16:38:11 2015 UTC,"BUG Delver will never be as efficient at mana denial as RUG will, so we have to attack their strategy another way, namely ripping apart their hand."
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Ozy-dead,2,Tue Jun 16 16:42:27 2015 UTC,"In this case, the difference between RUG and BUG is literally a single copy of stifle.  The deck plays 1 mana, instant-speed removal spells because they either maintain or generate tempo, while also letting you hold up stifle/pierce. Thoughtsieze does the exact opposite of that."

MTGLegacy,39zvww,milesrout,7,Sat Jun 20 11:55:57 2015 UTC,"BUG Delver - the most stable and versatile. Can be very highly tuned for meta, does not have outright bad matchups. Does very well against current Tier 1 decks. Has two major builds - Stifle Delver and Hymn Delver. The second is slower, midrange-y and heavier, but packs a better late game thanks to walkers and TNN. DRS does major legwork here stitching all the elements together and allowing to play those hard double costs. If I were to name this deck, I'd call it BUG Deathrite.    UWR Delver - instead of BUG's versatily, this one packs what I call ""the freight train"" - TNN with mystic package. It also runs the best creature removal set so far - swords, bolts and sometimes even snaps to fetch more of those. Ultimately, it's the killer of creature decks like DnT and (suprise!) other delver decks. This one is as close to midrange as it gets, even in the ""token"" build. On the flip side, it struggles with combos a bit, because it's slower. I'd put it in the ""UWx"" blade category more than into tempo delver category though.   UR Delver - burn with blue.   RUG Delver - the ultimate tempo deck. It attacks your board, your spells and your mana, while your life total quickly disappears with the help of fast clocks. It actively trades card advantage for tempo, and does so exceptionally well. However, it lacks any late game, and if the opponent found a way to stop the bleeding, RUG is boud to lose. Also, Chalice >>> RUG.   Grixis Delver - an attempt to abuse pyromancer - cabal therapy build in a faster shell than Grixis Control. I'd call it ""Grixis Pyromancer"", not delver, because the namesake of the deck is by far not the main card there. It combines great creature removal and discard, and leverages every spell to the max with pyromancer, but has very little tools to deal with Miracles."
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Apocrypha,1 point,Tue Jun 16 09:28:02 2015 UTC,"Perhaps I've been playing the matchup incorrectly, but I feel like U/W/R delver doesn't do too well against D&T. Unless I can get lucky and get a TNN equipped with something, it always feels like an uphill battle. Thalia and Mom make removing things a bitch, and aether vial and cavern of souls putting in creatures that you can't stop hurts just as much. Not to mention their mana denial plan! I agree with everything else in your post, though!"
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Canas123,3,Wed Jun 17 20:23:53 2015 UTC,This is an extreme oversimplification but I see them as what they best prey upon:  RUG: Combo. The best mana denial and fastest clock mean that your mongoose plan will kill scheming mages.    UWR: Fair decks. Swords to plowshare and the stoneforge package will help you beat up mavericks or pyromaniacs.    BUG: Control. Bug offers hand disruption and the ability to decay counterbalance. You will be able to grind back at miracles with these dirty tricks.
MTGLegacy,39zvww,milesrout,3,Tue Jun 16 04:41:49 2015 UTC,Hmmm... I think you are underestimating BUG's game versus combo.

MTGLegacy,39zvww,Canas123,3,Tue Jun 16 11:20:37 2015 UTC,Because combo needs to assemble peices and discard removes those peices.
MTGLegacy,39zvww,Maxtortion,2,Tue Jun 16 11:59:32 2015 UTC,Because it is?
MTGLegacy,39zvww,lord_mcdonalds,2,Tue Jun 16 11:36:30 2015 UTC,No it isn't. More counterspells are infinitely more useful than more discard.  BUG Delver is bad against combo compared to RUG Delver. RUG Delver has more counterspells and it has stifle.
MTGLegacy,39zvww,griselbiscuit,3,Tue Jun 16 11:40:01 2015 UTC,"No, counters are better than discard against non-combo: your opponent spends mana to cast a threat, you usually spend less mana to counter it. Against combo you don't care much about tempo loss (you spend mana to make your opponent discard, your opponent does not spend anything), but about breaking the synergy among combo pieces (Omniscience without S&T, Infernal Tutor without LED, etc.)."

MTGLegacy,39zvww,rrrOuta,1 point,Tue Jun 16 13:33:10 2015 UTC,"Because they are willing to play the odds against topdecks and brainstorm. Id personally rather prevent them from even being in a position to top deck a win condition. Nothing feels dirtier than stifling a fetch and forcing a brainstorm lock, especially with a delver or threshd mongoose in play. Ive been on both sides of the table, And even as a reanimator pilot, id rather see bug with deathrites and all than rug delver. Bug doesnt have the threat of a hard mana lock with a possibility of bolting in response to a grizly activation, and im more likely to dodge a seize or hymn with brainstorm (bonus if they have to put a creature into the yard) than i am to win a counter war with rug while my mana base is under fire. I feel similar things can be said for TES/ANT, although in different applications. There are simply more dead cards against combo as a bug player than there is as rug. Deathrite is really the main reason bug is a hard matchup, and if they dont land him, then bug is almost strictly easier. A good rug pilot is a nightmare to play against as a combo deck (although the rug/ant matchup is one of my favorites in all of magic). And i feel game one, rug keeps a better hand against combo than bug in the blind (especially with less dead cards), and game two and 3 both are heavily favored anyways so its irrelevant which cards are sided in, as both kept hands will be hard to overcome.   EDIT: this being said, i personally pilot BUG a lot and think its position in the metagame right now out weighs a slightly worse combo matchup, because lets face it. It is significantly stronger against stone blade and other fair decks, even other delver decks. Just having access to decay gets you out of situations rug delver could only dream of in sideboard christmasland, and deathrite is nice too. Nothing feels better than golgari charm board wipes against DnT or elves, or just depleting a grave yard to keep opponents delves/therapies/thresh turned off."

People seem to talk about the extremely blue US east metagame as if it's 'the' metagame of Legacy and that couldn't be more wrong.  For example, in my metagame there is much more combo, not many Miracles decks, and a fair amount of players on budgets playing burn."

A Divining Top will survive, and precious little else.  He's definitely a board-out against MUD and Death & Taxes, but unlike every other Planeswalker, landing him means the game immediately shifts in your favor, no matter what the board state looks like (except against MUD).  Compare to Garruk.  You...get a 3/3 Deathtouch?  Kill something, gain a little life, and then he dies next turn?  Kill a Liliana?  Ugh."

I always start there because you're more likely to find a crowd of Nic Fit experts on the actual Nic Fit primer than you are in a small subreddit.   To answer your question; Karn by a country mile. No specific color restrictions (not that they'd matter for nic fit) He's +4'ing every turn instead of +1'ing, so he can reasonably race incoming aggro if you cast him when you're flooded, and his effects don't die to color-based BS (Garruk looks wimpy if your opponent has a Mother of Runes on the table).   At most I'd run 1-2 but I might also consider Ugin for that slot. All the other walkers you mention are pretty weak (other than jtms) or just outright unplayable. New Nissa is cute but meh (and her effect doesn't just work on basic lands btw). I hope you're running Green Sun instead of focusing too much on the planeswalkers."

IE, Planeswalkers who have a place somewhere in Legacy, but don't belong in the spotlight. In the technical sense I'd say this following set is ""Legacy Playable"", but only in the sense that something like Reverent Silence is ""Legacy Playable"". You'll see it in a list somewhere and agree it belongs there, but whoever is running it should probably be the only one doing so.  Dack Fayden  Chandra, Pyromancer  Nahiri, The Lithomancer  Now that last one is definitely a weird one, but it was played in a recorded SCG feature match (at the top tables) to good effect out of the board, and I have to admit in a grindy game against miracles in a stoneblade list it has it's place.  Finally, I think that ""Lil' Chandra"" from Origins might have a place in Burn? I'm not sure, I don't really play a lot of Burn, but if you resolve her and cast at least two red spells next turn, she basically explodes for 5 damage and then turns into a Sulfuric Vortex."

MTGLegacy,39xn4q,alphastryk,12,Tue Jun 16 17:06:53 2015 UTC,"What's budget depends on who's asking, of course. Budget for one player might mean fully-built Miracles but with KTK Polluted Deltas in place of the Scalding Tarns and one Hallowed Fountain that should be a Tundra. Budget for another player might mean jamming together two copies of the Fire & Lightning precon.  In some sense, any deck with at least some of its 75 chosen to be suboptimal but cheaper options is a budget deck, but that doesn't really answer your question. For Legacy in particular, the average deck is somewhere around $2k (major exceptions: burn/dredge/merfolk/mud), so I'd say anything under $1k can pretty safely be labeled 'budget'."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,wintermute93,-17,Mon Jun 15 17:29:22 2015 UTC,"If that player runs a basic mountain, using Polluted Deltas instead of Scalding Tarns is indeed a budget approach, Shock instead of a Dual even more so. I would argue that KTK Fetchlands are budget alternatives to the Onslaught versions too, but it is a tricky matter because one could also label all non-foils as budget alternatives to foils :D Still, while watching someone play, I am much more ecstatic to see an old Thoughtseize, Fetch, etc., instead of the reprints, which I deem to be a budget approach (Modern Masters provides cheaper alternatives to otherwise more expensive cards, there is no arguing with that.

MTGLegacy,39xn4q,Skullcloud,5,Mon Jun 15 19:20:43 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I don't understand the point of budget Legacy decks. This isn't a snotty or elitist thing. It's just that even the cheapest Legacy decks are going to run you several hundred dollars, and your friends are right - that doesn't really sound ""budget"". Legacy isn't a budget format. And most of the ""budget"" options don't translate well into the more expensive decks - as in, they don't share that many cards. So you're spending a lot of money on expensive cards that don't see play in other formats no matter what you do, but if you go for the budget option, you're also spending it on cards that don't even see play in other Legacy decks.   If something like Manaless Dredge or another budget deck is really what you want to play, I wholeheartedly support that! But if you actually want to build Miracles but can only afford Dredge, just save that money, work slowly towards Miracles, and in the meantime, proxy up the deck and play it whenever you can.   Proxied decks are great for Legacy. It's so expensive, and the decks are so diverse, that it is ridiculous to buy into a deck without playing it a lot first and making sure that it's the one you really want to build. They're not even that limiting. You can't enter sanctioned events with proxies and that sucks, but you can play with your friends all you want, and lots of places hold proxy tournaments."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,TheBotherer,2,Mon Jun 15 21:06:38 2015 UTC,"This is actually something I want to address up front. The way I would like to structure the 'introduction to Legacy' resource I'm trying to together would be:  -Address that proxies are 110% the way to go to figure out what you want to play and build towards. -Based on the final list you're trying to build, figuring out how to best 'budgetfy' that deck while still using real cards that not only mostly go into the final list, but go well into other legacy decks or fit well in your binder after. -Slowly transition into the full deck, piece by piece, making the original 'playable' version strictly better than it was before with each addition.    The 'dream scenario' is to avoid decks that people only build because of budget reasons (Such as manaless dredge, burn, or some mono colored aggro variant, unless, as you said, they want to build those), and give them lists they could play at tournaments with reasonable results if they want to play Legacy and get a feel for the format today, while building toward an actual, tournament ready list.

MTGLegacy,39xn4q,ogre_bard,5,Tue Jun 16 11:45:10 2015 UTC,"budget is anything I own, nonbudget is anything I don't.  in seriousness, probably under 6-800 is where I would put the limit. this means burn, any version of dredge, belcher, etc are the decks in that range. aside from those decks, most decks involve spending an awful lot on the manabase."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,William_Dearborn,4,Mon Jun 15 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"Some general tips for getting you and your friends into the format:   Prioritize acquiring fetchlands over duals, in game you can find that 1-of dual pretty easy, and you often want to fetch basics anyway Stay away from decks with little format overlap unless you absolutely want to play just that deck (Dredge, D&T, Lands, etc) Lend/borrow/pool cards with other regulars to provide extra decks. If you can get new people to play, even if it's with your or someone else's deck it has a chance of getting them hooked. If they do well at an event and start turning store credit into their own cards it starts the snowball Point out the long-termness of their investment, those crappy standard rares that they are okay shelling out $20/per every 6 months are going to literally be useless soon.  Duals/Forces/etc will be generating enjoyment forever :-)"

You could maybe check the cost of the decks being played (organize it by top 16s if you want, following the source's listings for ease of reference) listed by number of tops, calculate then the respective average deck cost, and then see budget decks as the ones being on the bottom X% of that range, but frankly, someone will come and say it is not budget (upwards or downwards) because player perspective matters.  Frankly, don't go that way."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,bcoutlander,2,Tue Jun 16 10:52:55 2015 UTC,"I think budget in eternal formats has to do more with properly trading up for what you want. I had to trade off 90 some odd cards I've picked up over the years for edh along with standard staples for my Tundras. The rest is a mater of properly budgeting and saving to make purchases.   People who drop money to play a deck for an event in any format aren't really there for the enjoyment, they want the wins. The spike thing just isn't easy to do when it comes to high dollar collectibles."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,Sansia,2,Mon Jun 15 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. I had used a friends UBg reanimator deck for a few local tournaments and then played and SCG Open with it. I enjoyed it so much I traded my whole Kaalia EDH deck, 60% of my standard collection and a good chunk of modern cards to pick up the cards I needed to complete my own reanimator deck. And that's still budget until I pick up my 3rd Underground Sea. And now I've decided I want pick up the Volcanics so I can play 4c delver as well.   TL,DR: there's no such thing as budget in legacy. Once you start building you think just a couple more pieces and I'll be able build 'x' deck for a change of pace! It's all too much fun!"

It as a culmination of your time playing. Buying, trading, etc. Those years playing can net you a decent sized pool of cards and those cards can be used to trade for staples you need. Eventually trading into (and buying a few of) the cards you need to build the deck you want.  I have two beta Mox Sapphires, and quite a few other cards. The few times I get to use them in Vintage highlanders around here it doesn't really enter into my mind that there is $15,000 ""retail"" swimming around in that deck. Most of those cards I got for under $100 way back in the day, or I traded for more recently. That deck is simply my deck."

That said, there is nothing wrong with buying pieces to contribute to your ideal deck (after playing the format with proxies), and building a low tier deck in the interim.  For example, I have always been a fan of imperial painter, but could not afford it while I was a student. So, I built ""dragon stompy"", which utilised the blood moons, SSGs and such, which allowed me to buy into the format and use proxies for the cards I couldn't afford. I then built imperial painter when I had enough money from my job. Even though I was not playing a key deck in the format, I was still enjoying myself along the way with what was a fun deck."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,kaminamina,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:21:54 2015 UTC,"Can't speak for anyone else but for me I consider any non blue legacy decks budget. Sounds elitist, but in all honesty Blue is very expensive comparative to non blue options."
MTGLegacy,39xn4q,cripledcyclone,10,Mon Jun 15 17:24:12 2015 UTC,Storm is blue and fairly cheap. Lands can be nonblue and still run you over $2000.

MTGLegacy,39xjfk,LRats,2,Mon Jun 15 16:51:11 2015 UTC,Well because lim dul gives you the ability to see more cards. And you can play it earlier because you don't need to delve.  Also: having two digs in hand is worse thabln dig + vault.
MTGLegacy,39xjfk,kaminamina,7,Mon Jun 15 17:00:49 2015 UTC,Seeing more cards is fine and all but dig through time actually puts cards in your hand

I've tried to make it work, but unless you've already got a cantrip or something already in your hand, it's a painfully slow card to have use when you're trying to assemble a combo.  Which is a shame, because it's a very cool card. It's a great little puzzle, and it does something that no other card I can think of really does. If it only cantripped, it'd be a real contender."

MTGLegacy,39xjfk,wintermute93,2,Tue Jun 16 00:52:08 2015 UTC,"Because Dig Through Time is not hard to cast for the deck and is easily the best card. It's not just a cantrip - it leaves you up a card. Also, after Omniscience, it's the best way to grab your finishers. The graveyard requirement is barely anything since the entire deck is cantrips, and the number of cards you get to see is so much higher than any of the other cantrips.  In fact, Chris Vanmeter called Mono-U OmniTell a ""Dig Through Time"" deck, not an ""Omniscience"" deck. You can tell how important it is, since even you noted in the description that you are looking for DTT using LDV in the first place. If that's the case, then you might as well run more DTT and replace something else.  I haven't really used LDV, but since it doesn't actually draw you a card I would think that it's somewhat suboptimal. The second color could also be punishing. But if you really wanted to run it, then you should replace one of the less important cantrips (like Impulse, as the other poster said), since Impulse is probably the worst of the draw spells in the deck."
MTGLegacy,39xjfk,famdoola,2,Mon Jun 15 17:27:52 2015 UTC,"Dig is the reason the deck is as powerful as it is now, why would you cut it? Current lists typically run 1 impulse to facilitate the Firemind loop, lists that splash black run LDV in that slot."

MTGLegacy,39wug9,Ozy-dead,5,Mon Jun 15 14:51:16 2015 UTC,"That philosophy seems so misguided. The real difference between a proxy and a counterfeit is the intent to deceive. No one can or should be fooled by a proxy.  Counterfeit cards aren't real. If you show up with a piece of cardboard sleeved up representing a Force of Will (but is not actually a legitimate Force of Will), why can't anyone else say that their Force of Will represents a Tabernacle of Pendrell Vale (or whatever is convenient to them)?  I know prices are absolutely ridiculous now (Heritage Druid at $25? Seriously) but you should never condone counterfeits in organized play. It's not healthy for organized play.

Sticking Chains of Mephistopheles can leave control decks dead in the water and desperate. And I know that you shouldn't expect your opponent to play badly, but this card can make some really seasoned players make some really bad decisions.

Think of it as an enchantment that costs 0 mana and a land drop. Maze of Ith is similar here. You wouldn't count it to your mana base since it does not produce any.

MTGLegacy,39tueh,Dwellonthis,3,Sat Jun 20 23:21:15 2015 UTC,"I ran two copies of Nether Void in both GB and monoblack pox. I loved it. So much. In both decks you have a bit of acceleration that can aid in pushing it out vs storm and combo decks and as a lock peice vs everything else. When someone has been sinked and repeatedly wasted it serves very well to ensure they dont just win off topdecks, which i found to be the biggest problem. In the GB varient it couldnm't be pushed out as quickly, but I found it more effective as that build felt less explosive to me, since without dark ritual you can push for a devastating turn one.  Now because of those early turns in Monoblack Nethervoid was the perfect follow up as after losing up too 3 cards turn one when it hits it became too hard to recover from. The issue with it is that if you don't have Factories out asap an opponent can sometimes just wait it out and play through it.  Also vs any storm deck they outright lose to it. So pushing it out with ritual can create the most satisfying look an ANT players faces.  netrhervoid allows you to play magic the way Richard Garfield intended it to be played. Draw go with minimal permanents in play."
MTGLegacy,39tueh,Twenty-VII,3,Sun Jun 14 21:39:45 2015 UTC,"I use Nether Void in a BUG deck. It essentially locks the game at the current board state once you play it. So by four mana in a BUG deck you already have Tarmogoyf or Liliana out (plus Dark Confident or whatever other configuration you run). Meanwhile you limit resources with Thoughtseizes or Hymn to Tourach.  Its also very hard to deal with as an Enchantment even Abrupt Decay cant get rid of it. So if you have a stronger board state, played at the right time, Nether Void often seals the win."
MTGLegacy,39tueh,Capwnski,2,Sun Jun 14 23:39:05 2015 UTC,"Hey we're like opposites. I started with Pox and acquired all of the Legends cards, including Tabernacle because I got a crazy deal on it. I am now making lands because I've always loved it and had the Karakas and Tabernacle.   I would say all 3 of the enchantments are nuts in their own way. I've had The Abyss literally win me games against Show and Tell. Nether Void can shut off so many things. And Chains is probably the best of them all in a format that loves Brainstorm. I can say I'm happy I have them all and I use them all fairly regularly."
MTGLegacy,39tueh,Timiniel,2,Mon Jun 15 01:49:39 2015 UTC,"Chains is excellent versus all the brainstorming and other cantripping going on, as well as jace. It is worth it.  Nether void is also excellent versus combo as it is what locks out the game and prevents them from coming out of the lock. Without it, they always have a chance to simply power through what you've got.   Abyss, however, I consider less useful now. The metagame is less full of weenies and smaller casting cost cards, and all the delver decks in the world won't be enough to justify it.  I would not play pox without chains and nether void, personally."

People can't interact with it outside of the stack very well and it's deceptively simple to pilot.  The only real caveat is that it's entirely propped up by dig through time at the moment so if that gets banned it may have to go back to the old configuration that's pretty awful.

From a budget standpoint, you'll have to try it out with and without to see if you wanna invest in those.  Volcanics are pretty solid as an investment though.  There are 4 generic builds I see generally.  One runs 4 ponders and snapcasters which means you have a lot of card selection and you won't have as many dead hands.  One runs V.Cliques and Vensor and Karakas to have more S&S/reanimator play and as a cute mini combo / extra soft lock.  One list runs MB RIP and helm to have some MB graveyard hate and a combo finish aside from jace/entreat.  One list runs MB SFM to have more pressure in the early/mid game. I personally like the ponder build due to having more card selection and more stability, but they each have their place."
MTGLegacy,39szom,khangreen,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:36:51 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting that the popularity breakdown of the different types of miracles is something like: 80% 4 ponder, 10% legends, 5% RIP-helm, 5% stoneforge.

MTGLegacy,39szom,nightfire0,2,Tue Jun 16 18:49:55 2015 UTC,"Unless you're running a basic mountain you don't need the Scalding Tarns, that might save you a few bucks.  Any blue fetch can find that Volcanic.  Red is fairly critical to winning the mirror and having a chance against Omni. It's very unlikely you win the counterbalance war in the mirror if they are sitting on blasts and you aren't.  I don't follow the mind-set of ""be prepared to lose a lot"" -- in my experience the deck is extremely forgiving. Particularly if you run the stock 4 Ponder + 3 Snapcaster Philipp Schönegger build - which I highly recommend you try card for card until you are comfortable with how all of the cards function.  If anything it's the mechanical aspect that will trip you up at first: check to make sure that the card you've drawn isn't a miracle before putting it into your hand, verbally trigger Counterbalance every time, remember which cards you stacked on top and in which order.  If you are unfamiliar with casting the cantrip package (BS/Ponder/Top) you will likely run out of time fairly often at first, but your pace will pick up the more you play. I find it helps to have the clock on the mind, I recommend timing your games when you're testing to see how far off you are with your decision making timing from where you need to be.  A bit off topic, but also remember that just because you're a slow deck doesn't mean going to time is always your fault. It can be hard for some players to realize when exactly they are beat against miracles. Don't let your opponent sit there tanking about their single card in hand that won't ever resolve through your CB/Top. Mentally time your opponents decisions and hold yourself to the same standard. Anything beyond 5-10 seconds is typically too long, ask for a move, if they sit there for upwards of 20-30 seconds, play a land and pass turn, you need to ask for a judge."

Copy a list from an established player and play it until you understand how the deck functions. Find all of Philip Schonegger's articles and read them all.   Do you want to win? If so, play the red splash. Do you want to get general experience with a suboptimal version of the deck? If so, it's acceptable to start off with straight UW. You can easily get away with 1 volcanic or even a steam vents instead of 2 volcanics to start out - the matchups where you bring in red blast, they aren't pressuring your life total, and they don't have wasteland.

If Disenchant is really better than Wear // Tear, why does practically every Miracles list that has Top 8'd a major tournament in the last two months choose to run Wear // Tear?

And miracles can be tough because we present no clock and they have entreat the angels (CB isn't the worst for us but you basically have to resolve and stick a Deed to have a good shot, which isn't easy against a control deck, especially since they now play CJ main and needle postboard)"
MTGLegacy,39snsk,notaprisoner,2,Mon Jun 15 15:58:31 2015 UTC,"Nic Fit player here. I personally play Punishing Nic Fit and my best bud plays Junk Fit. His list runs Birthing Pod and Sun Titan with more one-ofs and low drops to make use of those, and being able to pod into a Thragtusk from a Siege Rhino is no joke. He also has Academy Rector to search out Recurring Nightmare, Sylvan Library, and Pernicious Deeds of course.  In general the Junk list is less control oriented and more proactive, since you don't have the Punishing Fires to control the board very well, and focuses more on getting more creatures down to apply pressure yourself, and if you run Pods, get crazy value off of your creature chain, and, depending on the list, easily acquire you silver bullet creatures for many situations. The Red version in typically better suited against other ""fair"" decks, where the Fires allow you to control their creature base while playing your own threats, which are generally more impactful than theirs. With the Junk lists your just out-value and out-utility them without controlling their board or plays as much and just reacting with your own threats (And Deeding/Decaying/Pulsing things when you need to), which doesn't seem like a lot but it's something a lot of decks can't seem to handle (if Maverick can do it so can you!)  Both lists typically don't main-deck directed discard, which you see most often in the vanilla GB Nic Fit, with Thoughtseize/IoK and Hymn to Tourach (which obviously isn't set in stone, and you can build and test all you like to see what works for you and your metagame). So in general you'll struggle against combo and other ""unfair"" decks, but that's not something that a sideboard plan can't handle.  As always your choice will come down to your local metagame, and how you have fun playing Magic (which is what it's about, after all), and I can't really say which is a better deck in a broad sense. Where I play creature decks run wild and I don't see many ""unfair"" combo decks (aside from manaless dedge, which is a wild creature unto itself) and Punishing Fires and Firespouts allow me to easily control most of those games. There's many many different flavors of the deck, which is one of the main reasons I play it. I've seen GBU Fit, Mono-Black/Smallpox Fit, Junk versions with and without Birthing Pod, Valakut/Scapeshift Fit with Burning Wishes, among others. So I'd say, if you haven't already, try proxying up both lists and testing them out a lot to figure out which Fit fits your playstyle the best.  Hope that helps at least a little ;P"

Your combo game is stronger than a non blue Nic fit variant. But you are still one of the easier blue match ups most combo players can play against.  A lot of your win cons and normal spells (Brainstorm and ponder) line up with the meta very favorably for your opponent. While the other nic fit varients are interested in playing strong cards that are hard for your opponent to interact with favorably IE Thrag, Primetime, Broodmate, and Thrun. BUG is basically playing the ramp package, cards that the rest of the meta can interact with and then 1-2 thragtusks and a grave titan.)

If you're avoiding duals, a GWb deck with just deathrite in the main black is totally doable, allowing you to focus on picking up other staples like STP, Stoneforge, DRS, swords, equipment, etc. the deck is difficult to pilot, and very meta dependent, but that's how I started, and even now that I have the cards to build force decks, I still play Maverick on occasion because it's so much fun."

MTGLegacy,39tmyy,Watoo24,5,Sun Jun 14 20:14:26 2015 UTC,"Also, some Burn resources for you:   MTGtheSource Primer. Start here. Great info about the history of the deck and card choices. Mike Flores' ""The Philosophy of Fire"". Why we don't include most of the cards you think you might want to include. Patrick Sullivan's ""Burn vs Counters"". An important read before your first tournament. Tl; Dr: Suspend Rift Bolt last, play around Daze if you can, Goblin Guide can't be Spell Pierced, float two red before using Fireblast. The best burn match ever on camera. Watch this. Rewatch this. Another Patrick Sulivan Burn video against RUG delver. Watch his threat assessment. Tom Ferguson's 5 6 part Burn articles: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Looks at the deck from multiple perspectives. Some strange conclusions, but overall useful."
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,twndomn,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:29:00 2015 UTC,This list looks pretty stock to me. Maybe another fetch instead of one of the Mountains?
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,Eric91,3,Sun Jun 14 20:08:46 2015 UTC,Merfolk is about the only thing reasonable in that range.
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,wintermute93,2,Sun Jun 14 18:15:01 2015 UTC,"If you start with Burn, the fecthland Burn uses will allow you to transition to many other decks down the line."

MTGLegacy,39tmyy,milesrout,3,Sun Jun 14 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"If you're willing to buy a set of Forces, I think Merfolk is a much better choice for someone new to the format."
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,dripdropdiet,1 point,Sun Jun 14 20:59:50 2015 UTC,"I guess that's true, I just highly reccomend forces for anyone who's interested in legacy because they're tramsferrable between decks and the value is gonna be there for a while."
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,Code_Rinzler,1 point,Sun Jun 14 22:19:36 2015 UTC,Yeah I agree I think recommending that newer players play something like High Tide is a bit of a mistake. It's a fun deck but it's not for everyone. The aggro/tempo style of Merfolk is probably more appealing to most players.
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,mpaw975,2,Thu Jun 18 06:38:47 2015 UTC,"I returned to magic with burn almost a year ago, after selling off collection when I had kids. I've had fun with burn. It's fairly straightforward, but there's definitely reward for experience. It's a good way to learn about all the other cool decks in legacy while they stomp your face. You've got about a 45% win rate against a diverse meta. One other thing that I didn't see, but helps budget is look out for played cards instead of pristine cards... And see if there are any shops in your area that allow proxies. When I finally bought force of wills (moving on to UR delver, then Grigio delver) I saved $125 by buying four in ""good"" condition instead of near mint. It hurt to buy them back after having sold them ages ago for like $20 each."
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,Code_Rinzler,1 point,Mon Jun 15 01:12:36 2015 UTC,"So my friends and I play super budget legacy, we have started and we're slowly over time adding a cabal therapy to our decks etc. I started with a Blue/black delver/delve deck and it's in my opinion pretty strong. I don't have force of wills or duals yet but those are the big purchases.   This is a blue/red delver list but in my opinion if you just want to start playing legacy you might be able to steal a few games here and there and slowly build a very competitive legacy deck.  In b4 I get hated on for posting non-competitive or bad decks.  http://deckstats.net/decks/14281/97726-ur-delver-budget-/en  I would suggest continue to use the filters and poke around this site. I think you will have the best experience finding a deck you can upgrade over time rather than dropping 2k+ on a single deck."
MTGLegacy,39tmyy,Zamite,2,Sun Jun 14 19:56:46 2015 UTC,"Seems fine, but I would definitely replace the Harvest Pyre with even something as simple as a Sudden Shock or a Chain Lightning.

MTGLegacy,39q6yi,bloodygripen,4,Mon Jun 15 00:30:39 2015 UTC,"Ask your friend if they'd rather have 1 large creature (MUD) or a bunch of small creatures (Dredge) and if they would rather play a prison/beatdown deck or a combo/attrition deck.  Both are powerful decks. Dredge is a lot more consistent than MUD and wins much faster but is hit harder by sideboard hate. MUD's greatest weakness is its inconsistency. Both are decks people don't play test enough against and don't really know how to fight.  Legacy Staples in Dredge: Cabal Therapy, Lion's Eye Diamond  Legacy Staples in MUD: Ancient Tomb, City of Traitors, Chalice of the Void."
MTGLegacy,39q6yi,gibbousm,5,Sat Jun 13 18:56:46 2015 UTC,"I was in this position a few months ago.  I went with MUD, and here's why.   MUD is probably the most cost-effective Legacy deck.  It's never really dead, with turn 1 Chalice giving it game against pretty much everything.  It costs noticeably less than blue-based Legacy decks without being completely run over by them.  It has favorable matchups, most importantly against legitimate tier 1 decks like Miracles.  Most importantly, while MUD has a unified strategy, it runs some tutors (in the form of Forgemaster), some one-ofs, and can have some explosive starts (I got a turn 2 kill from a hand with a Lightning Greaves, 2 Metalworkers, a City of Traitors, and a Blightsteel)--meaning that you'll have a lot of games that play out very differently in meaningful ways. Dredge is a very powerful deck, but is often referred to as ""the boogeyman of the format.""  It is a deck that is easy to hate out, and how good it is mainly depends on how willing your opponents are to run that hate.  Most games are going to play out more or less the same, and it has a major tell (choosing to draw after winning the die roll for game 1) that will give experienced players a leg up against it game one.   Bottom line, Dredge is a deck that is going to have more games where it just doesn't do anything.  To me, that's the ultimate feel-bad moment, and the one most likely to make me go sour on a format."
MTGLegacy,39q6yi,Blenderhead36,4,Sun Jun 14 00:11:08 2015 UTC,"Most games are going to play out more or less the same, and it has a major tell (choosing to draw after winning the die roll for game 1) that will give experienced players a leg up against it game one.

MTGLegacy,39q6yi,5028,0,Sun Jun 14 00:55:03 2015 UTC,"We were talking budget, so I assumed manaless."

MTGLegacy,39q6yi,LRats,2,Sun Jun 14 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"I would go with MUD, the games are usually interesting. I'm looking at the prospective of you and your friend playing against each other. Of course a lot hinges on what your deck is, but I feel like playing Dredge can turn out really swingy. You can end up in a situation where one of you is almost always going to win. I think MUD will give you guys more competitive, interesting match ups on a more consistent basis."
MTGLegacy,39q6yi,djauralsects,2,Sun Jun 14 14:14:44 2015 UTC,"MUD is better situated in in the current meta. Dredge gets hated out after side boarding, the is also a bit of a one trick pony and may get a little stale over time."
MTGLegacy,39q6yi,wintermute93,1 point,Sun Jun 14 00:03:53 2015 UTC,"I would go with MUD. Dredge is fun and sort builds into storm, but how well it does is largely dependent on how many people showed up with grave hate that day, where how well MUD does is largely dependent on what happens to be in the top 15 cards of its library. If I were going to have one Legacy deck, I'd rather have one that's always a pretty reasonable choice but performs inconsistently than one that's very powerful but not consistently positioned."

Muds got no place to go but mud, however its the best non blue deck in the format in my opinion. Not to many decks can deal with turn one challice, and you have crazy good sideboard game, and a solid miracles matchup. It can play like combo, stax, or aggro."

MTGLegacy,39q6yi,vastros,1 point,Thu Jun 18 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"Dredge. The answer is dredge. It will always be dredge.   Dredge is the budget deck of choice along with burn, both being refered to as ""Fischer Price's my first legacy deck"".  Dredge does not play magic, dredge does not want to draw cards, cast spells, or play creatures. This is an advantage.  Dredge has a high game one auto win rate, and can win through hate easily.  ""But people have graveyard hate in their sideboards!"" Yes, they do. Assume 4 cards graveyard hate means that there is a 1 in 15 chance they will pull that card. Agressively mulligan? Well now they are on a worse footing for the hate.  Dredge builds into ANT/TES/Landless Dredge/Tin Fins. So there is more opportunity later.  ""But deathrite shaman!""  Yes, DRS can be a pain, but it can be played around. Darkblast kills em, and not as many decks run DRS as say, a year ago.   Most people have no idea how to play against dredge in my experience. This gives you an adavantage as you should know how to play against them.   Dredge is hilariously fun to pull out against ego headed players as well. ""Im da best"" they say, then they face down 30 dmg worth of haste zombies turn 2/3. They rage quit.  I recommend dredge to pretty much anyone based off these reasons."

What should I focus on keeping off the board besides the Vials?"
MTGLegacy,39lvmt,batvanvaiych,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"Thanks for feedback!  High Tide seems rough. Combo decks best beat Merfolk by going over the top with speed or having just enough disruption.  In general, it's easy to overload Merfolk's disruption. Disregarding Chalices, at worst you have to beat one Spell Pierce, Cursecatcher, or Daze and a Force of Will.  I think you just need to do what you can to buy time, because Merfolk can't fix or stack its hands with Brainstorm like the Delver decks. Consider rather than Forcing the Vial, Forcing what they play on turn 2.  It's all really case specific. The best thing is to assess what is going on in their hand. If they're light on threats they're likely heavy on disruption, vice versa.  If you can make them Force something early it also puts them down a potential threat."
MTGLegacy,39lvmt,kreldin,3,Sat Jun 13 03:16:15 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Chalice Merfolk for over a year now, so I'm glad you did well with it.

I might go back to it though, it does help out against most of the other matchups- I usually had no problem against decks like storm and dredge, but usually lost to omni tell"

MTGLegacy,39mddd,Derpalisk,6,Sun Jun 14 15:04:38 2015 UTC,"They're pretty different decks strategically. MUD is more of a prison deck (running things like Trinisphere/Chalice/Lodestone as disruption) that either uses Forgemaster or a ton of mana (often via Metalworker) to generate a huge threat. 12 Post is more of a combo/ramp deck that's streamlined towards generating huge amounts of mana to cast their big threats. As a result, 12 Post is more consistent and quicker at reaching its end game, but more susceptible to combo decks due to lack of disruption. That's my impression at least, maybe someone who has actually piloted the decks can chime in."

MTGLegacy,39mddd,Manaplease,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:12:27 2015 UTC,"It doesnt. Unless they run a maindeck island and manage to repeal it, it is a back breaker."
MTGLegacy,39mddd,cincyfire35,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:25:45 2015 UTC,"This isn't really accurate.  Post always runs at least 1 basic island, sometimes a few and sometimes also a basic forest. They also run map to find their island using only mountains.  They can also vesuva a basic island the enemy controls.   With an island they can cast show and tell and repeal and sometimes even SB hydroblast.  And even without an island they run usually something like 26 lands, plus land tutors, so getting to 8 mountains into Ugin into -3 is also very viable if the enemy isn't following up moon with a clock."
MTGLegacy,39mddd,Manpandas,0,Mon Jun 22 21:05:18 2015 UTC,But isn't it in every Miracles board?
MTGLegacy,39mddd,Manaplease,24,Mon Jun 22 22:59:23 2015 UTC,"Goblins. Matches up fairly well against Miracles and against 12-post, which I assume the other 40% of the field is playing, knowing the same info that you do."
MTGLegacy,39mddd,Maxtortion,3,Fri Jun 12 20:45:35 2015 UTC,Depends on whether the rest of the players need to be concerned with card availability. Candles are pretty pricy. If there are no restrictions for anyone then I'd say your recommendation is great.
MTGLegacy,39mddd,Gordonuts,2,Fri Jun 12 22:15:08 2015 UTC,"Candle is absolutely not a necessary card, especially for the miracles matchup.  I play monogreen 12-post and have my candles in a binder.  It's win-more in your good matchups and I'd rather have Pithing Needle for Wasteland in the bad matchups than a candle."
MTGLegacy,39mddd,magictgmike,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:55:09 2015 UTC,"Well... Like I mentioned elsewhere in the thread, I don't have any experience piloting the deck, but the only iterations that I've seen have any success have Candles."

Dredge is a really fun and interesting deck, and it has a pretty high skill ceiling, so you should be happy playing it for quite a while.  Now, work on getting some dual lands and Force of Will! It may seem impossible, but it just takes time and patience. I have been working on my Legacy collection for 10 years, and it still isn't complete. Buy good Legacy staples one at a time, and soon enough you'll have a collection that can last, literally, a lifetime.   Welcome to the best format! I hope you stay involved in Legacy for a long time to come because it really is a great way to play Magic!"
MTGLegacy,39m2ee,fish60,6,Fri Jun 12 18:48:30 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the Dredge family. I impart upon you one of the greatest words of wisdom from a master of the Dark Art of Dredge Fu   ""Using Therapy to beat hate cards is straightforward: think of the card you fear, picture it in your mind, and then say its name out loud. Do this as Cabal Therapy is resolving."" - Richard Feldman"
MTGLegacy,39m2ee,gibbousm,3,Sat Jun 13 17:43:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, [[Cabal Therapy]] is definitely the one card I need to learn the most.  I played a casual Legacy game against a friend's Bant deck last night (just mainboards, no cutting after shuffling, etc), and I snagged a [[Stoneforge Mystic]] during the second game we played off the second Therapy that turn (first one got countered, oh no!).  It felt really good to actually be able to think through the cards I know/suspect he's running, figure out which one straight up beats me, and hit it.  I'm actually in the process of going through Legacy decks on mtgtop8 to see which decks run what hate, as well as general deck composition so I have a better idea of what to name with Therapy."
MTGLegacy,39m2ee,gibbousm,2,Sat Jun 13 19:31:42 2015 UTC,There are a couple of articles devoted to just Cabal Therapy I suggest taking some time to look them up and read through them. Dredge is the best Therapy deck in Legacy.

There's nothing better than grabbing a handful of hate cards of a player who felt safe and secure after they mulliganned hard looking for it.   Having them try and dance their way through it with brainstorm just adds to the fun of what's already a beautiful mindgame. Love everything about the card.

I haven't played a whole lot against other people, as my LGS has a very small Legacy crowd, so I figure the grindier version will help me learn the deck better in it's best matchup, game 1."

You're already pretty fast, so you may as well just up your consistency, then run the best silver bullets out of your sideboard.   Between Elesh Norn, Iona and FKZ, you're pretty well covered against most things. Ashen Rider is good if you expect to see a lot of OmniTell, though it's not idea if they cunning wish into trickbind with the trigger on the stack.   I miss the Flayer kill from playing manaless, but I think it doesn't fit into the mana version so well.   Overall, I like your list. It seems pretty flexible."

MTGLegacy,39gya9,5028,3,Thu Jun 11 22:25:58 2015 UTC,"Having more consistent Legacy writers is always good, as not many pros or grinders who write on the topic actually play the format and understand its nuances. I'd say some interesting things you can go over could include any of the following:   The importance of understanding the fundamental theories behind a deck. In Legacy sometimes ""who is the beatdown"" is a bit more muddled due to how differently spells interact in the format and the evaluation of card advantage can vary based on deck choice. A good example of this is Lands, where Manabond can be a somewhat conterintuitive card to play with at times. A breakdown of the difference in regional metagames and how that may change the composition of decks in that given region. Japan, Europe, and America all vary in deck composition and understanding that can really help both players newer to the format and enfranchised veterans get a more realistic glimpse of what choices are good for them right now. Since you are a well-known Miracles player, going a bit more in depth with the deck on occasion to give people updates on your thoughts. I may not agree with your deck construction choices personally, but that doesn't mean they aren't well thought out or poor choices (you certainly are a much stronger player than I). The value of dissenting opinions in the community is actually very beneficial, as it keeps a lot of the diversity in the format alive and creates more interesting metagames."

MTGLegacy,39ikv2,Lazy_Brain,5,Thu Jun 11 23:34:20 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend 2 flusters, they've been pretty nuts against combo. Grip has also been decent, though I'm not sure how much better than decay it is.  Top is bonkers against Miracles, definitely play it.  My board has been something like this most weeks, and my meta is similar to yours (though I play grinding station):   2 Fluster 3 Decay 1 Grip 1 Top 1 Ad Nauseum 3 Massacre/ DoN 2 Chain of vapor 2 Xantid"
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,TheScynic,2,Fri Jun 12 00:19:11 2015 UTC,"Great suggestions. I wouldn't waste a sideboard slot on Top, though, just put it in the main (-1 Preordain) if you want it. I never liked Krosan Grip, since bringing it in just for Miracles seemed too narrow, but now that I think about it, it hits Omnitell as well, so that's a much stronger option now than it was a few months ago. I also like Dread of Night over Massacre in ANT, but there's arguments for both.  If you have Ad Nauseam in the side its useful to have a second Past in Flames in the main, and swap it out for Ad Nauseam when you want that engine.   In my view, the following are mandatory:  3 Abrupt Decay 3 Dread/Massacre 2 Xantid Swarm 2 Chain of Vapor 1 Flusterstorm    and the other 4 slots are personal preference, to be filled with some combination of (Krosan Grip or Abrupt Decay #4), (Carpet of Flowers or Xantid Swam #3), (Empty the Warrens or Tendrils #2), Ad Nauseam (if 2 Past in Flames main), Flusterstorm #2, or move one of the green duals out of the main.  Some people run a playset of either Young Pyromancer or Dark Confidant in the board, but I think both of those are bad plans."
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,wintermute93,1 point,Fri Jun 12 02:33:32 2015 UTC,"I already play a top main, that's the second. I refuse to play Preordain, that card sucks.  My list is 1 top, 2 PiF, 2 Tendrils, 1 Grim, no AN main.  And I only play Massacre sometimes because my local meta has a large amount of DGA/ Zombies w/ hatebears, I generally agree that DoN is the superior option."
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,TheScynic,1 point,Fri Jun 12 05:01:51 2015 UTC,Why do you think Xantid Swarm is necessary? What do you side it in against?
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,paperwarrior,2,Fri Jun 12 16:51:19 2015 UTC,"If your opponent has countermagic but no removal, it's the best protection we have. The bees come in vs Miracles, Show and Tell, Reanimator, 12 Post, etc. Anything with countermagic but no removal, or countermagic and mostly-sided-out removal. If you're expecting more soft counters than hard ones, maybe leave some Swarms at home and replace them with Carpets."
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,wintermute93,1 point,Fri Jun 12 19:25:28 2015 UTC,That looks like a good list.  I kind of felt like grip and decay can serve the same role.  Maybe this is a noob question about the deck but when do you want the extra ad nauseum?  I kind of like having a mix of creature removal so I was thinking a mix of DoN/massacre and what ever else would be good.
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,Skelegro93,2,Fri Jun 12 00:29:18 2015 UTC,I think he doesn't have an ad nauseam main. Which is reasonable I guess because I can't think of a time where you wouldn't go for pif game 1

Krosan Grip:   Can't be interacted with through spells/activated abilities, but can be Counterbalance'd if they have CMC 3 on top. Hits OmniTell   Abrupt Decay:   Can be exiled/[[Flicker]]'d Hits Hatebears"

MTGLegacy,39ikv2,ReallyForeverAlone,3,Fri Jun 12 07:31:19 2015 UTC,"Against a miracles/combo heavy meta I would honestly opt for a different main. Sb ad naus in favor of 2 PiF main, and cut a preordain for either another md tendrils or md empty. Having multiple PiF/tendrils main makes it much easier to combo through a counterspell or go off naturally and thus not worry about any counters. This may require switching the bayou to a badlands though (and consequently the mistys for tarns).   Sb cards really depends on which combo decks are prevalent. For a bunch of SnT decks I would much rather have xantid swarm as it's not horrible to bring in vs miracles either. For a bunch of reanimator or storm I would pack 1-2 flusterstorm as you're equally worried about them killing you first as you are protecting your combo (in protect mode just flusterstorm their discard spells). Never ever sb tormods crypt as it hurts you just as much many times. 1-2 surgical extraction is also a fine option vs the mirror, reanimator, and dredge if you don't like flusterstorm much. City of solitude vs defence grid vs xantid swarm is really just personal preference. City is best vs miracles, defence grid is kinda in the middle, and swarm is strongest vs SnT decks/high tide/12 post/(and decent vs miracles). I really dig a 1-1 split of massacre and pyroclasm. Sometimes DnT doesn't play a plains, sometimes they have mom to protect a dude from clasm. Dread of night is really iffy for me. On one hand it is immune to karakas bounce, mom, and them not having a plains; on the other hand it doesn't touch revoker, and if they play cannonist you need a minimum of 2 or 3 in the board. Pyroclasm can also potentially be brought in vs elves in case they get a quick start. Usually I side out swamp, all duress, top (if in the main), and maybe a preordain or 2. This leaves 5-7 cards you can bring in which is usually more than I dedicate to the matchup. I bring in 3-5 removal in the form of CoV or decay come in (for potential null rod and deathrite), but then what? That's why I like pyroclasm as a 1-of in addition to massacre. Can also come in handy vs stoneblade decks (meddling mage) or young pyro decks (if you expect a grindier game 2/3), and can be a good way to have some more game vs belcher or the misguided ANT/TES player that decided to keep empty in their deck. If MUD is at your meta (or you play a larger tourney) I would run 1 rebuild over recall as it can cycle if you don't need it, and by costing 3 it dodges a potential chalice on 2 and doesn't care about trinisphere. However, the MUD matchup can be so abysmal and uncommon that I wouldn't dedicate more than 1 sb slot to it. If you opt to run a top, then just stick it in the main in place of a preordain. It's usually not worth the sb slot and is about as effective as preordain (though admittedly a bit slower). Carpet of flowers is kinda meh for me. I generally feel pretty good vs RUG delver and its kinda 50/50 on whether BUG/grixis will pack stifle, or even wasteland.   For ref, my current an looks a bit like:   3 decay (necessary)  2 CoV (necessary)  2 Flusterstorm (one is kinda flex spot)  2 xantid swarm (kinda flip-flop between these, surgical, and carpet of flowers)  1 ad naus (2 maindeck PiF for me)  1 massacre  1 pyroclasm  1 rebuild (kinda flex. My meta has MUD but sometimes I take it out for larger tourneys)  1 tendrils (maindeck empty and tendrils. Tendrils #2 is for burn and miracles)  1 dedicated flex (surgical, teferis response, extra massacre, divert, or whatever else I feel like testing)"
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,Skelegro93,2,Fri Jun 12 12:51:27 2015 UTC,"Don't take this advice seriously but yesterday in my 18-man, my first round opponent as on ANT and he brought in Bitterblossom and Young Pyro."
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,ReallyForeverAlone,3,Fri Jun 12 00:12:29 2015 UTC,I've heard of young pyro but bitterblossom is just nuts if it can't be dealt with. What were you on?
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,jsauci26,3,Fri Jun 12 01:24:44 2015 UTC,"Miracles. Ended up drawing that round because Bitterblossom killed him faster than he could creature-beat me down in G2, and he couldn't storm off. G3 my hand was mono counterspells, and we went to time."
MTGLegacy,39ikv2,Ixadore,2,Fri Jun 12 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"I recommend adding 2 Xantid swarm to the sideboard and pushing Top to the main board. I also recommend adding another massacre (as it is good against thaila, etherstorm and meddling mage) and another carpet of flowers for the delver wasteland decks. I also recommend cutting the following: hurkel's recall, rain of filth, krosan grip (decay is the same thing), empty the warrens (this is a maybe, but I think a 2nd tendrils would be better), pyroclasm, defense grid (xantid swarm does the same thing and can be used to flashback a therapy, also deploys a turn earlier.  Still, I like the tech. try it out.) engineered plague and Dread of night (only run this card as at least a 2 of maybe 3 of)."
MTGLegacy,39gr04,Engale,10,Thu Jun 11 16:41:44 2015 UTC,"Which would you rather do: guess at whether you should go for 14 goblins or try to Ad Nauseam for a kill (TES), or wait until you have a deterministic Past in Flames kill (ANT)?  ANT is a little bit easier to play, simply because it has one win condition (maindeck Tendrils) and three routes to it (Past in Flames, natural Tendrils, Ad Nauseam), where TES has three win conditions (maindeck Empty, SB Empty, SB Tendrils) and four routes to it (Ad Nauseam, natural Empty, natural Tendrils, wish for Past in Flames) plus a second color of mana to worry about.   TES is slightly faster, but it's not at all clear if the speed advantage is worth the increased risk of simply choosing the wrong path. Especially if your name doesn't rhyme with Cryant Book."

MTGLegacy,39gr04,wyldwyl,7,Fri Jun 12 06:04:57 2015 UTC,"ANT is easier to play and probably stronger overall. Juggling red mana rituals is just not something I've had good experiences with. Cabal ritual is also amazing and many TES lists don't run that.   I also don't really like having to go in on the goblin plan. TES  is more likely to end up with 6, but not 7, mana. I just find that you often empty the warrens, attack for less than leathal, and then die."

MTGLegacy,39gr04,XVOS,3,Fri Jun 12 14:28:09 2015 UTC,"Play whatever you feel you like the most. You will have to learn a lot of skills, relearn a lot of stuff, and forget a lot of stuff you learned from modern.   Since you can easily convert from one to the other, it's perfectly fine to build one first and then switch if it is not the right for you. From what you described, I'd say go TES.  Don't let what others play dictate what you play."
MTGLegacy,39gr04,Timiniel,3,Thu Jun 11 17:08:35 2015 UTC,"Budget wise, they are pretty similar, and easy to convert. I'd start with ANT, (I haven't played it, only TES, but it seems easier), then surprise some people with TES.  When I put down Tin Fins I'll probably sleeve up TES with 2x Cabal Ritual, which is also an option."

MTGLegacy,39gr04,KennethKnot,2,Thu Jun 11 20:50:47 2015 UTC,"I was testing 4x serum powder, 1-2 pull from eternity, and 4x gemstone caverns out of the board.  Fun, but too much variance.  Right now I'm testing 3x Daze main."
MTGLegacy,39gr04,Honore_de_Ball_Sack,2,Fri Jun 12 17:02:25 2015 UTC,At the moment the only real difference is burning wish. And empty main and red ritual instead of cabal ritual. You could rather easily play both (thats what I do)
MTGLegacy,39gr04,noahgs,2,Thu Jun 11 17:23:00 2015 UTC,"The differences are numerous:   TES runs a wishboard for Burning Wish, while ANT runs a green sideboard with hate-hate for post-board resiliency TES runs red rituals and black rituals, which never feels right. Instead of having two Dark Rituals and a Cabal Ritual in hand with LED on the battlefield and Infernal Tutor in hand and thinking ""I have won this game"", you have a Rite of Flame, a Dark Ritual and a Burning Wish in hand and think ""WTF am I doing with my life?"""
MTGLegacy,39gr04,milesrout,2,Fri Jun 12 13:03:36 2015 UTC,"It really depends on your style of play. TES likes to go off quicker and is more risky in that sense, so if you like the adrenaline rush of a real storm deck (Modern Storm these days is pitiful), TES might be a good option. ANT, on the other hand, is more the type of storm deck that likes to sculpt its hand and its winning turn, so generally in ANT you aren't trying to go off as soon as possible, but more to build toward your storm turn and make sure you win."
MTGLegacy,39gr04,anubis647,2,Thu Jun 11 19:00:41 2015 UTC,"ANT is simpler to play and the stronger deck, especially in the current metagame. TES works well when the meta is vulnerable to fast starts, eg. when it's full of Delver decks that fold to a quick Empty, for example. Right now ANT's resilience and the raw power of its cards is much more helpful.  That said, while the two decks are like RUG and BUG Delver variants (same core strategy, one is more aggressive one is slower but plays bigger stronger cards), they luckily share like 98% of the card base, so just get Storm staples and you can try which one you like more.  TES is the Storm deck for an aggressive gambler, it wins fast with Empty and aggressive, strong Ad Nauseams into Tendrils. ANT is the Storm deck for someone with a control player's heart. It is more comfortable in the long game, can spend resources to shred the opponent's hand and typically kills with a smooth, comfortable, zero variance Past in Flames into Tendrils line."
MTGLegacy,39gr04,Komatik,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:17:12 2015 UTC,"Test both of them extensively against the top decks, then start trying to decide."
MTGLegacy,39gr04,cromonolith,1 point,Thu Jun 11 16:48:50 2015 UTC,TES can be a bit more explosive but it's a lot less resilient.  I'd sleeve them both up and goldfish them 20 times to see which one feels better to you.
MTGLegacy,39gr04,magictgmike,0,Thu Jun 11 20:31:07 2015 UTC,"Don't actually do this! Actually yes, do it, but don't make your decision solely on that. Goldfishing ANT is like goldfishing a control deck. There's too much interaction main that doesn't get used (EG duress)"
MTGLegacy,39gr04,Cr0c0d1le,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:58:43 2015 UTC,"For the purposes of figuring out which one you like better, sure.  Also it's really easy to goldfish the deck against certain scenarios.  There's only 6-7 interactive spells in the deck, let's not pretend it's a highly interactive deck here.  It's easy enough to goldfish ""I need to go off through 1 counterspell/2 counterspell/T1 Thoughtseize + counterspell"" etc."
MTGLegacy,39er9b,ReallyForeverAlone,2,Thu Jun 11 06:14:06 2015 UTC,"First, thank you very much for posting this. I like reading these every time people post them, especially when the list is similar to mine. I just have a few questions for my own learning.   Do you think a second Council's Judgement (side or main) would/could be advantageous? Would do you think about cutting the 3rd Jace for another Dig? Are you running the 2 Pierce in the main as a concession to your miracle/combo meta or do you find it that good?   I play in a meta that has a great deal of creature decks myself and I'm just trying to take note in case there is ever a shift."
MTGLegacy,39er9b,jj702561,2,Thu Jun 11 07:44:17 2015 UTC,"Council's Judgment for me at least was great as a 1-of. It's actually kind of slow for the current universal meta, so I don't think having a second one is what you want to be doing, unless your local meta is filled with a lot of midrange that you can take advantage of drawing out games, or if your list is tuned more for drawing out games like mine is. Never. I'm not a big fan of Dig in Miracles; I don't think you should cut a wincon for a card that might show you the shittiest 7 ever. Some Miracles players swear by DTT, but I am not one of them. I've never found myself wanting multiples of the card, but that's because my list is more control-centric and less about closing out games quickly. I'm used to my list, so I can play at a relatively quick pace (hence why I only went to time round 1, and even then it was my opponent that chewed up most of the time.) Pierce, for me at least, is just that good. It's actually in the list for a different meta, specifically against a deck that would love to power out T1 CotV off of land-Mox Diamond, and I also loved it here in a meta that I knew nothing about. Miracles is slow to get moving, and Spell Pierce gives us some much-needed early game interaction. And it's also a house in the mirror, letting you kill CBs and Jaces before they hit the board."

I agree it's not well positioned in the meta right now, but I'm a diehard fan of it and even when I go to SCG in August I'll probably still pack it in the board.

I also like your personal opinion on some of the lists. I'm the type of player who likes trying out many different kinds of decks, so just being able to sleeve up some of these and try them at a weeknight legacy tourney seems like a lot of fun! I'll definitely be looking forward to these if you're doing them every month!  As far as constructive criticism, I really like your articles and have literally nothing to complain about because they're not too text filled, and the short but concise explanations cover the questions i have about the decks. Even when I try to think of something they're missing, I can't come up with anything. One thing I would like to see maybe is when you're looking at winning decks, pointing out any ""weird"" cards that show up either in the sideboard or mainboard, and then possibly discussing the validity of it would be really cool. You do that to a slight extent already, but maybe something to elicit discussion in the comments or on here could be fun, too!  Thanks for writing the great article!"

Goblin Guide inherently goes against Delver's mana-denial strategy, and doesn't pitch to Force.  Jace might as well cost 6 mana.  Tasigur is used in Grixis, but Gurmag Angler cannot be Karakas'd and has 1 more power so you can eat big Goyfs. Tasigur is actually too slow for Legacy (if you want his 2{U/G}{U/G}), and too vulnerable to all the removal available.  Preordain doesn't pressure your opponent, Spell Pierce is a solid card that I would play 1 or 2 of in any Delver list, and Top is a mana sink that you don't want in a deck that plays 18 lands (14 after Wasteland)."

MTGLegacy,39c181,Tehdougler,4,Wed Jun 10 19:17:48 2015 UTC,"Your questions are pretty open ended and hard to answer concretely, so here are some random thoughts:   Would I be right in assuming that Sultai Delver could be very strong or slightly weak depending on meta, where Deathblade always has some level of reliability?   I think you are exaggerating a bit. Slight meta shifts can make certain things slightly worse. BUG Delver is at its best when Tarmogoyf and Abrupt Decay are good, which is not always the case. E.g. during the Treasure Cruise era, both were relatively weak (since they matched up very poorly against Young Pyromancer + Treasure Cruise). Historically, Stoneforge Mystic + equipment has been a potent combination, but there's no reason to believe it will continue to be a top tier strategy forever (e.g. at the moment, I don't think it is).  Perhaps a better question to consider is whether the Delver shell is more likely to be playable X years from now than the Deathblade shell (accounting for the estimated value of the cards you buy for each).  For the latter consideration (value): Tarmogoyf and Abrupt Decay will almost certainly always see play in both Modern and Legacy, and so should retain their value. Dual lands will always retain their value (barring some catastrophic event that prevents people from playing Legacy). Short-term, Tundra is more playable than Tropical Island / Bayou because Miracles is the best deck. And like I said, it's conceivable that *Blade decks aren't very good X years from now.  Do note that Deathblade is essentially at an all time low power level right now. Contrast with the few months after TNN was released, where Deathblade was a top deck, if not the top deck.   I was thinking of picking up an Underground Sea, a Tropical Island and either a Bayou or Tundra (depending on if I go delver or deathblade)   BUG Delver isn't playable with basic lands, imo. What's the exact 75 you have in mind (assuming you had infinite money)?"
MTGLegacy,39c181,botaroo,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:37:27 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the insight, I (clearly) don't know a while lot about the legacy metagame other than what some pople in town talk to me about, so my views on certain decks are probably skewed. I figured a stoneblade variant was a reliable choice because a lot of people play that type of list here, but now that you point it out it is probably because they built it when it was the best deck.   Now that you point out that BUG Delver was only bad a while ago because of cruise, I think I am more interested in picking up that deck, as it was my original choice in the beginning.   http://www.channelfireball.com/home/deck-guide-legacy-sultai-delver/  The list at the top here is probably where I would want to be as a finished list, though I would like to try to fit a Tasigur or Gurmag Angler into the mix as well. I would also switch up the sideboard to play into my local meta a little more.   After playtesting the proxied up version I made, I can see why basics would not be an option here, so I might even just run shocks until I get the full set of duals needed."
MTGLegacy,39c181,milesrout,1 point,Thu Jun 11 18:22:53 2015 UTC,What is the 'Delver shell'.
MTGLegacy,39c181,randomnickname99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 08:24:30 2015 UTC,"Delver, blue cantrips, Daze, FoW, blue fetches?  Not really a shell but a legacy starter kit."
MTGLegacy,39c181,milesrout,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:30:37 2015 UTC,"It's really a tempo shell. Threats, protection, disruption."
MTGLegacy,39c181,randomnickname99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:34:36 2015 UTC,Yeah pretty much.  But delver and tempo are nearly synonymous these days
MTGLegacy,39c181,milesrout,-1,Thu Jun 11 12:36:55 2015 UTC,"Merfolk is still a deck. It doesn't run cantrips because it's inherently consistent (running a lot of relatively redundant threats), but it runs Daze/Wasteland and I've seen versions with Stifle (although Chalice seems more common)."
MTGLegacy,39c181,randomnickname99,1 point,Thu Jun 11 12:41:41 2015 UTC,Ahh right.  Merfolk is pretty much the only other one.
MTGLegacy,39c181,milesrout,-1,Thu Jun 11 12:51:04 2015 UTC,Yeah that's true.
MTGLegacy,39c181,randomnickname99,3,Thu Jun 11 12:52:53 2015 UTC,"Delver is the better deck at the moment.  Deathblade is in a bad position at this point, its UWR cousin is a better deck."
MTGLegacy,39c181,thereisafrx,2,Thu Jun 11 12:32:01 2015 UTC,"Hey,  You bring up an interesting question. BUG and Deathblade are two very strong decks, if the pilot knows what he is doing. Further, they both run a lot of legacy staples so deciding to build one deck and then switching to the other wouldn't be too hard. The only difference between BUG and Deathblade that costs a pretty penny is the 'Goyfs in BUG and the playset of Stoneforge Mystic in Deathblade (plus equipment).  From a lands standpoint, you'll need a few Tundra and maybe 1-2 scrubland to turn a BUG deck into Deathblade. The Khans fetches are all on-color for Deathblade so if you pick up the Zendikar fetches for a BUG list you'll be spending more money to begin with. Moving your abrupt decays to the board in Deathblade and dropping the Goyfs are the biggest changes most likely.  Here's my deathblade list:  Creatures (13): 4 DrS 4 SfM 3 TNN 1 VClique 1-2 Snapcaster  PWs (3-4): 2 JtMS 1-2 Liliana of the Veil  Spells: 4 StPs 4 Brainstorm 3 FoW 1 Spell Pierce 1 Ponder 2 DTT 1 Council's Judgement 3 Thoughtseize 1 Umezawa's Jitte 1 Batterskull (0-1) Sword of Fire & Ice  For my lands I run: 3 US; 3 Tundra; 2 Scrubland; 1 Bayou; 1 Trops 4 PD; 3 FS; 1 Marsh Flats; 1 Karakas; 2 Wasteland  For BUG you would add:  4 Goyfs 4 Abrupt Decay 1-2 Stifle 4 Delver 1-2 Ponder  2 Bayous; 2 Trops; 4 Misty Rainforest; 1-2 Verdant Catacombs Keep the PDs, the USs, and drop the Esper fetches and duals and you've got BUG.  So in summary, the decks are relatively similar and are only different in the amount of green splash. With BUG you can also go further into green and run things like Thrun or Life from the Loam or other fun spice depending on what you like doing and what your meta looks like. I'd just start collecting the cheap pieces (i.e. non-dual lands) that would be different, picking up the underground seas before they hit $300+ each, and then playtesting with each type of deck to see which one you like. You could also just punt deciding and run 4 color deathblade with a green splash for a few goyfs!"
MTGLegacy,39c181,milesrout,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:50:06 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the advice! I realized after looking at some lists that there is quite a bit of crossover in most of the money cards in these two decks. I ended up deciding to start building the BUG delver deck, and once its done I'm essentially a couple tundras & scrubland and a karakas away from deathblade since luckily I already had all the goyfs, stoneforges, jace and equipment.   I traded into a couple Undergrounds yesterday, so now I'm just a couple trops, 4 wastelands, 1 Liliana and 2 force of wills away from a playable delver deck!"

More players need to do this to their own decks.  The stuff about sideboards was super useful, and I in fact used the perspective of ""think about what you're going to take out, not what you want to bring in"" on a post here yesterday.  Idea for raising money. You guys could give away signed (by you) copies of Brainstorm (the card) for like a ~$10 donation (or whatever).

MTGLegacy,398knq,Patrunkenphat7,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:49:03 2015 UTC,Thanks for your feedback. We are aware of the issue and hopefully it gets better as we become better prepared for episodes.
MTGLegacy,398knq,DragonZProd,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:24:20 2015 UTC,"Great episode! Your thoughts behind brewing are spot on. However, I have a couple of questions about the deck, and specifically Monastery Mentor.  You're clearly aware of the inherent dis-synergies in UWR Delver (StP, Stoneforge playing the long game vs Delver trying to close it fast), and you talk about these. However, I think Stoneforge and Mentor are more similar than you give them credit for.  You mention with Mentor that it's a threat that basically states ""If I untap with this, I pretty much win. You have to have removal right now or I am going to beat you."" Meanwhile, you discredit Stoneforge as just eating a removal spell. Even though untapping with a Stoneforge is a bit less explosive than untapping with a Mentor, both of them provide a lot of power to your board. The amount of resources an opponent has to use dealing with a resolved Batterskull is typically enough to close the game via your Delver/TNN beats, if they can even reasonably remove the Batterskull to begin with. In terms of upside of the card sticking, both are extremely high, but Mentor is higher. If neither of them stick, you've invested less mana into SFM and you're up a card (to either Brainstorm away, put in with a second SFM, both of those options, or just to hardcast if nothing else).   Furthermore, Delver decks have a tendency to run out of gas. It's why some people are jamming 2x Dig Through Time into their Delver decks, despite the low relative impact of each of the cards the Dig can find. When you're in this situation where you're out of gas, looking to close out the game, Mentor is a much weaker topdeck. It needs other cards to funtion. A topdecked SFM can be incredibly powerful and a great way to close the game, or at least stall it long enough to find your TNN/Bolts. Especially in a deck without Bolts, it seems like drawing a Mentor when you're starting to peter out can be a nail in your own coffin just as often as sticking it Turn 2 with Force/Daze backup can be a nail in your opponent's. Is this assessment wildly off?  All of that aside, the deck looks exciting and I'm going to try it out (starting config being -1 Murderous cut +1 Gurmag Angler)."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,noahgs,10,Wed Jun 10 14:59:40 2015 UTC,"Well, Omnitell is pretty laughably easy to play, so if that's a concern go with Omni. It's also a bit better positioned (it's arguably the best deck in Legacy right now).   However, with that said, I play Storm. I play Storm because I love the deck. You should play some games with both to see which one you enjoy more, and pick that one."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,wintermute93,5,Wed Jun 10 15:06:33 2015 UTC,"I personally find ANT more interesting and fun, but that's something to decide for yourself. OmniTell is a very 'timmyish' combo deck, while storm decks are much more 'johnny', if you're more familiar with those terms.   Tendrils is like gaslighting someone over many months so they go insane. Show & Tell is like punching someone in the face."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,milesrout,12,Thu Jun 11 12:44:13 2015 UTC,ANT you get to have fun.  Omni you get to be bored out of your mind.
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Komatik,4,Wed Jun 10 15:07:29 2015 UTC,Is it really that boring?
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Horse_Of_Will,3,Wed Jun 10 15:18:32 2015 UTC,"Show and Tell decks generally have an extremely linear strategy. Omnitell is constructed to play the same game, every game, if at all possible. If you find that sort of thing enjoyable, you might like the deck, otherwise you'll probably get bored of it."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Undomian,2,Wed Jun 10 17:39:31 2015 UTC,It depends on what you think is fun. I find it incredibly fun. There's a lot of strategy. You only get one chance to win. So planning the perfect moment is super important. If you want to swing with creatures over and over. It's not the deck for you. If you want to get into the mind of your opponent and try to outthink them omnitell is probably the way to go.
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Usedinpublic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"No, obviously what is boring to one person is not to another."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,endlesswurm,7,Wed Jun 10 15:35:50 2015 UTC,Boring usually implies (to me at least) too repetitive and straightforward lines of play. While you can have fun playing tron in modern (and I did it was a blast) it's still boring because it's almost the same thing everytime. Maybe im just looking into what he said too much
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Horse_Of_Will,2,Wed Jun 10 15:43:42 2015 UTC,"Regardless of the fact that ANT is significantly more difficult to pilot optimally, just practice whichever one you intend to use in the next few months. If you don't have any plans for any big events or anything, and you just want to have fun, then practice whichever one you enjoy playing more."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,TheScynic,2,Wed Jun 10 15:57:54 2015 UTC,"ANT is a blast and is less likely to get hit with any bans than Omnitell, although I'll admit I don't expect either to see a ban.  I do think that over the long period of time there's more value in being a competent storm pilot than in being a competent Show and Tell pilot.  S&T decks are straightforward for the most part, but storm combo can be a real puzzle, and if you ever play against storm after you've played it yourself for a while, you'll be amazed at how much easier the matchup gets."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,jeffderek,2,Wed Jun 10 16:18:47 2015 UTC,Seconding that last part.  I sucked at beating storm until I picked up ANT for a bit.  I'm now a half ass ANT pilot but I beat it regularly.
MTGLegacy,39az0m,randomnickname99,2,Thu Jun 11 12:34:03 2015 UTC,"In the most reductive way.... Omni is the pinnacle of cantripping.  If you can cantrip well, you can win and your opponents won't respect you.  Storm is the art of counting.  If you can do basic math you can win and you opponents won't respect you. They're both pretty simple to play-- Omni being the easier.  Since Omni is also the better deck at the moment, the only reason  to focus on Storm is if you enjoy doing math while the joy of life slowly leave your opponent's eyes.  Said as someone who has played both decks extensively."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Sansia,0,Thu Jun 11 14:25:11 2015 UTC,"If my opponent does not respect it thats their problem, I sat behind a delver and daze for too long. If theirs something i see as lifeless and boring its losing over 7 turns as an overly efficient one drop slowly sucks your life away and no other spells resolve the entire game."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,magictgmike,2,Thu Jun 11 15:32:35 2015 UTC,"Omnitell is both easier to play and stronger against a field of miracles players, so I would go with that in a vacuum / in my local meta.  Both are powerful."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Umezete,4,Thu Jun 11 20:29:27 2015 UTC,Honestly scared of omni getting dig banned.  Even with that said I hate show and tell decks with a passion (Their lines seem really boring and tbh they're unfun and overpowered by legacy standards) so I'd definitely recommend ant as I enjoy piloting the deck.  The only problem with ant is its skill intensive and exhausting to play but storm really is an archetype you can only enjoy in legacy these days.
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Ozy-dead,3,Thu Jun 11 08:07:32 2015 UTC,"Show decks are not overpowered at all. Meta will adjust, and traditionally fair decks end up hating out show decks."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Umezete,-1,Mon Jun 15 10:55:58 2015 UTC,"My big beef with omitell is there is very little actual counterplay, either you play counters and waste their boseijus or you hope they get unlucky.  Between Omni and Tnn the only viable non-blue deck is d&t and that is because although you will almost lose to omni you should beat everything else since your worse matchups are also non-blue."
MTGLegacy,39az0m,Jables237,2,Mon Jun 15 22:32:23 2015 UTC,Storm is harder to master but you don't get to loop extra turns while swinging with Emmy!
MTGLegacy,399m6b,iamspeaker,23,Wed Jun 10 06:28:41 2015 UTC,Get 2 cradles and then 2 crop rotation while you get the last two.
MTGLegacy,399m6b,Skelegro93,3,Wed Jun 10 13:24:22 2015 UTC,"This should be further up. The crop rotation line worked for me for a bit, while finding my cradles."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,Dracoplasm,2,Wed Jun 10 15:05:54 2015 UTC,"Entirely this.  the tombs over bayous is fine, too, your life total is not often relevant in this matchup.  You're typically either comboing off or you're contained and trying to beat fairly against a slow-to-clock deck."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,magictgmike,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:32:23 2015 UTC,"this is what i play, and i use an OG tomb not a bayou. tbh for the couple times i get to play legacy every few months i odn't mind it. crop rotation is good, and as a fast combo deck if you have to take 4 dmg from a OGtomb every once in a while it shouldn't hurt you cuz winning that turn."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,rumballtron,1 point,Fri Jun 12 14:47:28 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely the answer. Play it with 2 Cradles, Overgrown Tombs, and Crop Rotations, and look for good deals on  the remaining lands. They won't go down but people will sell for cheap if they need money quickly."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,pi-i-e,9,Fri Jun 12 17:18:51 2015 UTC,"I agree that you should truck on and finish the deck, but don't hesitate to bring out a deck that's not 100% netdecked. People lose a lot more games to inexperience than they do to actually playing shocklands, so you should get out there and jam as many events as you comfortably can. You need to learn sometime."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,MAC777,3,Wed Jun 10 07:22:49 2015 UTC,"The deck is sick and I enjoy playing it. I would recommend finishing it so you can jam the best format in Magic, Legacy!  From there, you can see if you prefer a different deck and do some trading."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,ValentinoYoshi,3,Wed Jun 10 06:54:37 2015 UTC,"I believe Shia Labeouf would like a word with you...  But seriously, though. Elves is fun as heck."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,branewalker,1 point,Wed Jun 10 15:00:37 2015 UTC,"Assuming you have an outlet to play legacy: definitely. Elves is highly competitive and a blast to play (not so fun to play against haha, but definitely better than Turn 3 Show and Tell double force, flusterstorm backup)."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,henryponco,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:18:38 2015 UTC,If you like it the sooner the better to finish it.  Definitely jump on decent cradle deals as the deck really wants 4 cradle.
MTGLegacy,399m6b,Umezete,1 point,Wed Jun 10 07:35:12 2015 UTC,4 cradles is a must. The Bayous can wait as Tomb's will be fine for the most part.
MTGLegacy,399m6b,Hydrogoose,2,Wed Jun 10 08:48:00 2015 UTC,"This is just not true though? Crop Rotation is just fine as a replacement, especially if he has 2 Cradles."
MTGLegacy,399m6b,pi-i-e,1 point,Fri Jun 12 17:06:24 2015 UTC,"Yer Crop Rotation gets you the Cradle but puts you down a card which can be massive. Also, having your Crop Rotation countered will be huge. It's fine as a budget alternative if you literally can't get Cradle's, but I would much rather have Cradles and run Overgrown Tombs than have Bayous and have to run Crop Rotation.   Having said that, if your area runs proxy tournaments and you can get away with proxying some amount of cards, I'd actually be inclined to get the Bayous first as they are a more useful card to have. Cradle only goes in two decks."

MTGLegacy,399b3t,Damaku,1 point,Wed Jun 10 08:36:38 2015 UTC,Cut one main board griseldaddy for inkwell. Never has a game where the fourth was relevant. An extra silver bullet is good
MTGLegacy,399b3t,150crawfish,1 point,Wed Jun 10 17:53:37 2015 UTC,"Maybe you have not personally had a game where the 4th was relevant, but from a mathematical standpoint, the 4th grizly is relevant, as it is then that much more likely to be able to show and tell it in or pitch it with a study. I always suggest if players know their meta decently well, there is never a need to trim the 4th, as most of the time there is only a need for 3-4 bullets. This isnt reanimator of old where mystical tutor allowed us to find the exact creature we wanted every time, because we are much more reliant on study and the like as another outlet to put into the grave. I know i for one would feel like an idiot careful studying a useless silver bullet that should have been a grizly. Grizly is the heart and soul of the deck, and unless you really dont want him 95% of game 1s, and your oponent sides in specific grizly hate to the point where its not worth playing him g2, i wouldnt cut his numbers down period. You only have a small chance of being able to study or show and tell the bullet you need, but having 4 grizlies mean that there is 5 cards that are very relevant, instead of just 4, and that will be very relevant over the course of many matches.   If you are on the show and tell plan, there is almost never an excuse to cut the 4th. And even on the decay plan id be very cautious, and would weigh how much more relevant the bullet for a specific matchup is than being able to more reliably get out a grizly."
MTGLegacy,399b3t,cincyfire35,-1,Mon Jun 22 01:25:01 2015 UTC,"Some people swear by the 4th, but the longer and more experienced I got with the deck the less I wanted the 4th. I also play in metas that ALWAYS rotate with players with several decks. I like to be prepared for everything. I can't be swayed to play the 4th anymore even though I do understand where you are coming from.   As for show and tell, I've never liked it. It allows your opponents to respond or drop in am ashen rider. I suggested abrupt decay a couple years ago and have followed my own advice to great success and have seen it catch on. If you haven't tried them yet, I highly recommend them  Edit: did a tournament report going 5-0 using reanimator that's floating around this sub. I explain my choices and SB there and have a list. Feel free to check it out. Ran 3 griselbrand."
MTGLegacy,399b3t,150crawfish,2,Mon Jun 22 01:50:54 2015 UTC,"maybe your meta has significantly altered what your list would otherwise look like in a fully diversified meta, which could be understandable, but if we're talking about 'take this to a tournament expecting everything' then there is no way you can play reanimator without 4 griselbrand. without mystical tutor you are unable to search for exactly what you want so the next best thing is to play a beefy creature that draws cards for you which in turn allows you to find that silver bullet. However between griselbrand, elesh norn, inkwell, and grave titan, pretty much every base is covered.  i would highly recommend sideboarding iona and swapping in inkwell to the mainboard. iona is probably the best sideboard card but can go either way mainboard depending on what deck you're up against. especially in your meta, only terminus and sacrifice effects can get rid of inkwell and he's a 3 turn clock.  the reason you shouldn't drop the 4th griselbrand is because he creates his own advantage with lifelink and draw 7 (which in most cases is simply too much for decks to handle g1) and he protects himself. Even if you are unable to draw 7 and counter their removal, the chances that you drew into another reanimation set up combo is so statistically reliable because of his card advantage. Since he was printed, griselbrand completely took over the deck and it has been that much better for it. so definitely put in inkwell mainboard, but swap out either tidespout or iona as they are not as efficient at actually closing out the game, but rather serve as really good silver bullets for g2 and g3. never drop the 4th griselbrand"
MTGLegacy,399b3t,arnsonj,1 point,Tue Jun 23 06:45:06 2015 UTC,"I couldnt agree more.   Just because the 4th copy of delver isnt relevant in any particular game i have played with rug delver, doesnt mean it isnt statistically relevant. And considering grizly is the heart and soul of reanimator, as he is an engine to find and reanimate multiple creatures on his own, in addition to being his own game ending threat sometimes, i cannot see a situation where it is worth cutting the 4th. Cut a careful study or a daze or a thoughtseize or a land or a lotus petal. All of those cards only supplement the deck, and are mainly a preference. But the 4 grizlies should be a lock at this point. You dont see show and tell running 3 emrakuls or 3 grizlies, you dont see shardless bug running 3 shardless agents. You dont see omnitell running 3 digs. You run 4 of your engine card every time. And grizly is the engine, in addition to being potentially our best threat in some games. If you want more bullets, you should drop a card that isnt as relevant. And even then, if you are running more than 4 bullets, you will be overly dependant on entomb (and grizlebrand... Oh wait... He was cut) to get the right bullet into play. And if i wanted to mull to entomb to win every time, id play tin fins, as it the multiple dump outlets and ways of putting grizly into the yard, as well as added protection that makes reanimator the most efficient two card combo deck. Its why we play reanimator. If you sacrifice the consistency and want to become dependent on entomb resolving in order to win game one, you are playing the wrong deck, as tin fins is even better at winning game one in that case, because its entomb target wins the game the turn it comes in every time."
MTGLegacy,399b3t,cincyfire35,0,Tue Jun 23 07:26:19 2015 UTC,"At large events, I'm even more prone to stay on 3 griselbrand as the expected decks could be anything. 3 vs 4 is not as important as people think. It really just is preference. I've seen winning lists with both 3 or 4, the deck is redundant enough for it to not matter.   Iona is so absolutely main deck-able as it shuts off the most crucial, if not all, of most decks. It is only dead against MUD and affinity, of which only one of those decks sees a lot of play.   I enjoy my build and it has consistently put up results for me. Without innovation decks become stagnant. There is absolutely nothing wrong with deviating from the ""status quo"". When I started playing reanimator I was on a stock list with 4 griselbrand and 3 extra fatties. Since I've gotten more comfortable I am not afraid to try new things, and cutting a griselbrand has been better than expected."
MTGLegacy,399b3t,150crawfish,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:34:10 2015 UTC,Run at least 1 ashen rider in board against show and tell it's almost a just have. And a great thing for smaller things like fnm if people start boarding in rips toss in a helm it's hilarious
MTGLegacy,399b3t,galactusbaits,1 point,Wed Jun 10 14:54:13 2015 UTC,Cool thanks for all the advice. I'll try out some variations with green splash and mbe no md shows. Also definitely mainboarding the inkwell. Thanks again all
MTGLegacy,399b3t,150crawfish,-1,Thu Jun 11 20:34:37 2015 UTC,"You need an inkwell for that meta. I would suggest -1 griselbrand +1 inkwell as the 4th griselbrand is almost never relevant.   As for MD show and tell, I've never liked it. You can use more disruption though, I would suggest -2 show and tell for either +2 daze or +1 thoughtseize +1 daze, based on your play style. Also, 16 lands 3 petals is alright, but you could easily cut one fetch for another piece of disruption (I'm on 14 land 3 petals as a reference) and it won't affect the play of the deck at all (from my experiences at least).  Show and tell with Sol land in the board is good though if your not splashing green."
MTGLegacy,3996gk,mdw2402,10,Wed Jun 10 03:59:49 2015 UTC,"First off, good that you have a plan. A deck-building path like that is the best way to get into Legacy for pretty much anyone who doesn't have a giant silo full of gold doubloons that they can swim around in like Scrooge McDuck, and it looks like you've thought out how far you can take it.  More importantly, it looks like you've actually thought out what decks you'd enjoy playing and found a path that follows them, which a lot of prospective Legacy players don't do, and worse, a lot of Legacy players don't really encourage. You see a ton of ""just build XYZ cheap deck until..."" recommendations, never really taking into account that it takes a very particular personality type to play Burn for that long without deciding to just forget about Legacy and spend the money they saved on something else.  Neither Dredge is a super meta-topping choice right now, but they are solid enough decks that you won't lose constantly until you can upgrade to ANT. Unfortunately there is not a huge amount of overlap outside of that path, though by the time you have ANT together you'll have dual lands. Bad news - that doesn't make branching out to new deck types cheap. Good news - it does make it easier to swallow the costs because after all, you've already got the Underground Seas and those are the really expensive parts so might as well..... :)  There are other routes you can take, like Burn -> UR Delver -> Grixis or RUG Delver; Death and Taxes or Deadguy Ale -> Stoneblade, etc. but honestly it sounds like the path you're considering is pretty good for you, if you're excited about those decks.  For reference, these were my paths:   LED Dredge -> Manaless Dredge -> Blue Manaless Dredge -> LED Dredge again but now I have Force of Wills in my collection -> (X) Pox -> Deadguy Ale -> Junk Stoneblade ->  Junk Loam -> Jund -> (X) (X) -> RUG Delver -> Decide I hate playing RUG Delver, trade all the cards I don't need for Jund into cards for 12-Post -> Perfect happiness forever   So it's quite a journey but it's great to have a plan you actually enjoy following most of the way through!"

MTGLegacy,3996gk,RexyLuvzYou,3,Wed Jun 10 16:01:18 2015 UTC,"Comedy answer: You don't!  Real answer: It is a tough matchup, but not unwinnable. It does take some combination of speed/luck and sideboarding (to help it take a little less speed/luck). Maindeck, Glacial Chasm can be a big help, and not having to worry about Crop Rotations getting countered is always nice. Versions of Post with maindeck countermagic have a bit more of an advantage. I don't feel like it's an auto-loss, but it's definitely not a deck I like sitting down across from."

MTGLegacy,397xj9,TheFiremind,8,Wed Jun 10 00:58:22 2015 UTC,"I've been playing TES on mtgo for the last year pretty much exclusively.   It's harder to play than ANT.  There are a lot of lines that can be hard to see and it can be overwhelming to try and figure them out on a clock.  Sometimes you know you have the win and other times you really have to guess especially when going the ad nauseaum route.  A common thing that will come up is the decision to either tutor for wish/warrens with 5 storm leaving a chance for the opponent to respond over the next 1 or 2 turns or tutor for ad naus and ride the luck train to tendrils town. This can be a really difficult decision.  The attraction of TES is that there are a lot of angles of attack. You can wish/tutor for your win, you can ad naus and as a last resort you can PiF.  More angles = more complexity and less redundancy.  Also it's more of an empty deck than tendrils.  You'll be casting empty as your win for the vast majority if your games which leaves at least 1 or 2 turns for your opponent to answer it.   You'll have to get really scrappy as well if you want to win.  There have been many games with less than lethal tendrils followed up by grapeshots/empty for the win.  If you want to play TES watch as much Bryant Cook as you can.  Seriously watch stuff even when the deck was using gemstone mine.  He knows the deck so well and some of his lines are not obvious.  Also he posts pretty regularly on the source (or is it mtg salvation) and his posts are worth reading.  Keep in mind he is building his deck for his meta and you need to tune yours to whatever meta you play in so don't just copy his lists.    If you play on mtgo make holding priority a second nature.  My god I can't even recall the amount of games I've lost from accidentally not holding control while casting tutor or wish.  Literally the worst feeling I've ever had playing magic."
MTGLegacy,397xj9,szrap,10,Wed Jun 10 00:35:27 2015 UTC,ANT is easier to play than TES. People can count to 10 and win. That's easier than figuring out what let's you win then trying to make it happen.
MTGLegacy,397xj9,150crawfish,-4,Tue Jun 9 22:54:54 2015 UTC,I don't think that's it. TES is pretty unreliable due to spending less time shredding your opponents hand. It's like saying Belcher is harder to play
MTGLegacy,397xj9,KingJulien,4,Wed Jun 10 00:33:32 2015 UTC,"There are MANY more decision trees in TES than in ANT, which is what makes it harder to play. Each is resilient, just in different ways"
MTGLegacy,397xj9,150crawfish,1 point,Wed Jun 10 02:09:22 2015 UTC,"Those were probably the worst decks to compare possible. A better comparison would be modern ad nauseum combo and UR storm. Ad nauseum is much easier to play: resolve an ad nauseum with a way to not die and dump your lands to lightning storm. That much easier than stringing together cantrips to figure out if grapshot or goblins is a better kill. What if you don't have a pyromaster ascension? The game gets harder.   Point is, both decks are fine. One is easier to play then the other, but just because of that doesn't make the other deck any worse. People gravitate towards a deck they like, and in competitive play I want to know I'm not going to fry my brain after 3 rounds. TES and UR storm both will leave me a little frazzled after the 3rd round."
MTGLegacy,397xj9,150crawfish,-1,Mon Jun 15 17:07:10 2015 UTC,"Well, in a way, TES has more options, but ANT has to figure out how to win with less options available. They both have their complexity, just different types of complexity."
MTGLegacy,397xj9,Timiniel,4,Mon Jun 15 18:02:05 2015 UTC,A lot of reasons. TES is predominantly an [[Ad Nauseam]] or 6-7 storm [[Empty The Warrens]] deck whilst ANT is predominantly a [[Past in Flames]] deck.  A lot of people prefer knowing that they will win when they go off instead of leaving it to chance (assuming perfect information).
MTGLegacy,397xj9,MrBumblebear,3,Thu Jun 11 11:26:47 2015 UTC,"Am I crazy for thinking that it's odd that ANT (which I assume is ""ad nauseam tendrils"") is not the one characterised by the card ad nauseam?"
MTGLegacy,397xj9,RedeNElla,5,Tue Jun 9 22:23:30 2015 UTC,No but it was given that name pre-innistrad so it stuck.  If they don't have graveyard hate post board then PiF is 100% likely to win (without disruption)
MTGLegacy,397xj9,Skelegro93,2,Wed Jun 10 01:40:35 2015 UTC,PiFT was not as catchy
MTGLegacy,397xj9,Apocolyps6,2,Wed Jun 10 02:31:30 2015 UTC,"Ad Nauseam Tendrils was characterized by exactly that for...really the entirety of the 5 years preceding Innistrad (I can only speak to 5, as that was how long I had been playing).  Past in Flames truly changed the lines of play for the deck, and it's still head-spinning to watch how much it's changed by that one card.  Though to be fair, CounterTop became Miracles when Avacyn Restored was released, so I assume it's just a matter of catchiness."

MTGLegacy,397xj9,Komatik,1 point,Tue Jun 9 23:18:05 2015 UTC,ANT is both easier and stronger because TES' speed advantage doesn't matter as much in the current meta as ANT's resilience and the raw power of its cards do.

MTGLegacy,397xj9,Umezete,0,Tue Jun 9 23:07:24 2015 UTC,"Cause its the better deck, it sacrifices about half a turn for more disruption, better mana, more resilience, and stronger cards.  Tes was good when empty turn 1 was a death knell, most deck can deal with a empty for 4-6 with a decent draw even pre-sb.  The consistency and power ant brings by focusing on the tendrils kill give it the edge in larger events."

Ideally you could be using the FOWs to protect your plays such as RIP and Helm.    Also Swords is really good against Pox since it removes the creature from the game.  It's really good against MUD too since it's extremely cheap removal for Wurmcoil, Forgemaster, Metalworker, Golem, or even Blightsteel.  Against Miracles and Omnitell (or all combo) it is sort of a dud.  Otherwise it's the best removal you can get."

MTGLegacy,395dhu,mpaw975,6,Tue Jun 9 22:30:02 2015 UTC,"yes, that is true.  Is MUD such a boogey man that you need to twist your deck around avoiding 1CMC cards?  Chalice sucks, but I think some of the creatures that you are going to be staring down are the bigger issues.  Goyf, SFM, Bob, Delver, DRS, Young Pyromancer, Tasigur, and others.  I guess I'm not sure why you would be so fearful of Chalice in MUD when other decks that are just winning with creatures are a larger threat.  EDIT: It might be worth mentioning that the chances of them having Chalice are as likely as you having Force for the Chalice."

MTGLegacy,395dhu,mpaw975,7,Wed Jun 10 16:27:35 2015 UTC,"I would make the following changes immediately:   OUT: 3 Daze, 1 Fact or Fiction IN: 4 Swords to Plowshares   You aren't really a tempo deck, and you are trying to make a lot of 2-3 drops, so Daze isn't ideal. Something like Dispel might even work. Jace TMS also seems like a reasonable include here.  In terms of your sideboard, I would double down on the Enlightened Tutor package. Go up to 4 tutors, and then keep some silver bullets in your sideboard. Right now you seem to be weak to OmniTell (which is very popular) so I would think about shoring that up.   OUT: 2 Stifle (This is a tempo card, not where you want to be), 2 Surgical Extraction (You have 4 MD RIP, you're fine), 2 Ivory Tower (not needed, your Burn matchup is fantastic with Energy Field) IN: ...   You have some room to play here. Against Omnitell you are going to be taking out: 2 Shackles, 1 Supreme Verdict, 1 Poryphory Nodes, 1 Pithing Needle, 3 Back to Basics and probably 2 Propaganda. That's 10 cards (!). Try to think about 10 cards you might want against OmniTell. They should be a mix of counterspells, hatebears, enchantments/artifacts that hate them and enchantments artifacts you can tutor for. Having some number of Leyline of Sanctity is not crazy (even if you just Show and Tell it in against them), as is Eidolon of Rhetoric (Rule of Law guy), Ethersworn Canonist, Aegis of the Gods. You could even go with Arcane Laboratory (Blue Rule of Law).  Alternatively, you could go with a sideboard of 4x Counterbalance, 4x Sensei's Divining Top so that you can become Miracles."

MTGLegacy,394pap,_sandcastle,58,Tue Jun 9 06:15:41 2015 UTC,"I appreciate your concern for an investment you have in a given format being banned, but let's have a quick conversation about Modern and Legacy.  Modern is the format the Wizards of the Coast structures to be their 'premiere' non-Standard format. They promote the heck out of it, make special products designed to reprint all of it's most desirable cards and put them in player hands, incorporate into their own championship series, etc. More importantly, it's the non-rotating format that they groom to be their vision of the game. The very first month after the format was created, they banned 6 more cards beyond their initial banlist. Three months later, they banned 2 more. In January 2013, they banned another creature and a mana ritual, then juts that May they banned Second Sunrise when a combo deck rose up. The year after that they banned Deathrite Shaman, the year after that Treasure Cruise, Dig Through Time, and Birthing Pod, all in one go.   Why do they ban all of these things in Modern? In almost all of the cases above, they weren't banned because the format 'broke', they were banned because the format is actively kept in check by Wizards so that remains in a certain playspace. If Timmy can't reasonable play his Seige Rhino, then they're unhappy, because they want the format to appeal to Timmy and let him play his 4-cost Rhino and attack with it.  Now, Legacy is a much different beast. Wizards doesn't actively promote Legacy because promoting a format they aren't even allowed to print several of the key cards for isn't great policy for them - it's the whole reason the Modern format was invented. Wizards maintains Legacy, aims new cards for it in Supplemental products, and keeps an eye on the format to maintain a healthy banlist in order to retain long-term players. They don't attempt to turn Legacy into ""how they think Magic is suppose to play"", because it's honestly not there to be marketed to new players, it exists so that they keep those players around who play for 8, 12, 16, 20 years. So, with respective to the Legacy format, them maintaining the banlist is more about keeping the playerbase happy and the format diverse and interesting, what that format actually looks like is something they couldn't honestly care about less as long as it makes the old-timers happy.  The same year Modern was created (in Legacy), they banned Mental Mistep soon after it's release, because a free counterspell for 1CMC cards is just format breaking in a format where most decks are super low to the ground on largely based on 1-drops. The next year they banned nothing. The year after that they banned nothing. The year after THAT they, again, banned nothing (well, unless you count the new card type they printed in their multiplayer draft product they preemptively banned in every format). Then this year, they banned their first card since 2011, Treasure Cruise, just because it did kind of unbalance the whole metagame since it largely just played as Ancestral Recall (U: Draw 3) in the kinds of decks in Legacy that built up their graveyard so efficiently (but they left Dig Through Time in place just fine).  Bannings are not something you really have to worry about in Legacy. They don't come out of the blue because the giant gardener's hand of Wizards have decided that the leaves on your right side have grown out a bit too far for their liking. Wizards steps in and bans something in Legacy when the format begins to actually break down, but not simply when things get too weird. Legacy is allowed to be weird. You can play a deck with no lands that just wants to discard your hand for graveyard synergies, you can attack people with 16 power worth of animated Leylines on turn 1, and so on, because Legacy has just as amazing disruption as it has powerful plays, and when both players disrupt the powerful part of each others bizarre deck lists and then have to try to win the game with the scraps of their engine left over, it's just incredibly fun. (The two things I just mentioned aren't even considered Tier 1)  Unless your deck is catching the world on fire and changing what everyone is playing at the big Legacy tournaments, don't worry about your deck being banned. Things don't get banned like that over here. That is very much a Modern format problem. The Legacy metagame is generally just allowed to try to digest overpowered nonsense, and with free counterspells, amazing hand distruption, and an incredibly wide range of answers to go to (basically any every printed), the truth of the matter is that when it comes to digesting overpowered cards, Legacy has a very strong stomach.  I mean, it wasn't too long about people were lamenting a 3-power 3-drop with protection from the opponent (http://magiccards.info/query?q=True+Name+Nemesis&v=card&s=cname) and now-a-days I hear people analyze the fact that a single person in the Top 8 is SCG Worcester ran 2 copies of it as an argument that the unblockable, untargetable, immune to damage monstrosity is ""not actually so bad"".  It's cool man, It's Legacy, your investment is safe here."
MTGLegacy,394pap,RELcat,12,Tue Jun 9 12:55:07 2015 UTC,This was a great description. I'm saving this to show people who I try to convince to join Legacy.
MTGLegacy,394pap,thexlastxlegacy,34,Tue Jun 9 14:37:26 2015 UTC,"First of all this is Legacy, not Modern. Bannings aren't impossible, but they're a lot less common in this format than they are in the other. Cradle has been legal in Legacy for ages, and multiple archetypes (elves and maverick at least) have abused it to great success without really coming off as being too unfair.   Second of all, your buddy's claims are definitely a bit dubious; because the nightmare card he's talking was printed years ago. Beck // Call (a functional reprint of glimpse costing UG) has been around for ages, but I don't think I've ever seen an Elves player splash blue just to play Glimpse 5-8. Make no mistake; Elves definitely saw a substantial boost when the Legend rule changed allowing you to tap two in a single turn, but as the deck has matured it's become less and less about glimpse chains and more about value glimpse into natural order.   Third, Elves is getting shit on right now. Miracles can be a really bad matchup with all the board wipes, as well as other decks that are using far more abusive-and-likely-to-be-banned blue draw engines (dig anyone?). Even when Elves was sitting pretty as a Deck to Beat, Cradle wasn't striking anyone as a broken card."
MTGLegacy,394pap,MAC777,10,Tue Jun 9 06:29:01 2015 UTC,But tell us how you feel about terminus...
MTGLegacy,394pap,migsmia,10,Tue Jun 9 07:00:56 2015 UTC,"honestly, i'm all for banning top in legacy.  miracles is just an unfun deck to play against because of it.  online it's not so bad because they can't abuse the clock to their advantage, so the slow players just lose, but on paper, it's like watching someone play solitaire."
MTGLegacy,394pap,unstoppable-force,14,Tue Jun 9 10:43:23 2015 UTC,"Now, color is just one axis of diversity, however SDT is one of the only good non-blue card selection tools we have in Legacy.  If something is oppressive in Miracles, it might be the instant-speed board wipe that costs W. That is, after all, the card that gives creature decks the most trouble."
MTGLegacy,394pap,branewalker,6,Tue Jun 9 11:43:24 2015 UTC,"I agree, if I were to be in charge of banning out the Miracles archetype, I'd remove Terminus.  First because there can absolutely be another card-filtering-esque thing printed down the road that would abuse Terminus again, and secondly because Countertop combo isn't something entirely exclusive to Miracles and I think it is something that should stay in the format.  Plus, yeah, there are other decks that would suffer from a Top ban when the only theoretically oppressive cause is because Top facilitates instant speed board wipes."
MTGLegacy,394pap,Dat_Gentleman,10,Tue Jun 9 13:57:01 2015 UTC,Do we really need to ban the only good control deck though? I don't play it and I kinda hate it but i think it should exist.

MTGLegacy,394pap,theotherhemsworth,3,Tue Jun 9 20:24:39 2015 UTC,Yes and it's quite nice to have more than one control deck in the format.

MTGLegacy,394pap,milesrout,2,Wed Jun 10 00:14:42 2015 UTC,"Terminus wouldn't make the deck disappear, it would just introduce variety into the control archetype.  Before Terminus there were several different flavors of countertop and different color variations on landstill, and now between Terminus and Entreat it's basically silly to play a control deck that doesn't use them.    I'm not saying you should ban Terminus or Top, but I do think that you could ban Terminus and a good control deck would still exist in the format, it would just be different.  Remember, we still have a 4CMC uncounterable wrath, and black variants have never really had the chance to explore the quality of Toxic Deluge, which would be neat to see."
MTGLegacy,394pap,jeffderek,4,Tue Jun 9 19:13:06 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding? Terminus is the card that actually wins games. You get rid of the best board wipe in the format and Miracles is left with what, Verdict? Yea, have fun tapping out on T4, assuming you live that long."
MTGLegacy,394pap,ReallyForeverAlone,5,Tue Jun 9 20:26:53 2015 UTC,How much Legacy did you play before Miracles was a deck?  Have you forgotten that control existed as a viable archetype?
MTGLegacy,394pap,jeffderek,3,Tue Jun 9 20:35:00 2015 UTC,The miracles were printed 6 months after Delver of Secrets.
MTGLegacy,394pap,milesrout,3,Tue Jun 9 23:09:40 2015 UTC,"If a card were to get banned from Miracles, I'd prefer to see Counterbalance or Terminus gone instead of top.  Sensei's Top is at least used in decks like Painter, Nic Fit, Bomberman (fringe), ANT, and non-blue decks that need card filtering."

MTGLegacy,394pap,axalon900,2,Tue Jun 9 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say slim to none.  Elves isn't exactly overpowering, and it's definitely a unique deck that adds diversity to the metagame. Gaea's cradle is ridiculously good, but there's lots of ridiculous cards that are legal and not many of them are green."
MTGLegacy,394pap,randomnickname99,2,Tue Jun 9 12:25:19 2015 UTC,"On that note, what does everyone think the chances are that Tolarian Academy is unbanned? Unlike in vintage, Legacy isn't flooded with 0 cost mana rocks that give Academy the busted explosive starts everyone knows it for. As far as I can see Academy would see play in decks like Affinity and maybe Tezzerator, and you might see MUD switch to a blue splash with cards like Thirst for Knowledge. No matter how I look at it I don't see it being all that crazy of an addition to Legacy."
MTGLegacy,394pap,PhyrexianBear,5,Tue Jun 9 14:41:21 2015 UTC,"It's still probably one of the most busted cards in the game. We still have lotus petal, mox diamond, etc etc."
MTGLegacy,394pap,KingJulien,3,Tue Jun 9 15:56:03 2015 UTC,"Exactly! Many of the standard cards from tempest-urza block that were abused in Academy.dec are also unbanned in legacy. Sure, we don't have memory jar, but you can run 4x lotus petal, 4x grim monolith, 4x mox opal (which didn't exist), plus mox diamond and voltaic key. That's already more artifacts than the standard deck usually ran, and you still get 4x time spiral, which is trivially easy to cast off Academy."
MTGLegacy,394pap,neurosoupxxlol,2,Tue Jun 9 16:04:29 2015 UTC,"Not to mention we still have mind over matter and the rest of the engine, not to mention the fact that high tide is a decent tier two deck nearly in its original form WITHOUT Academy."
MTGLegacy,394pap,KingJulien,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:41:30 2015 UTC,"Note that those decks were overpowered in standard. They would not necessarily be all that powerful in Legacy. Caw-blade was also too good for standard, but would be bad in Legacy."
MTGLegacy,394pap,milesrout,3,Tue Jun 9 23:58:12 2015 UTC,"Academy is ridiculously busted.  It's my favourite card in all of Magic, and I'd never let it back into Legacy.  The mana ramp that card provides - in blue - is insane when you build your deck around it.  It wouldn't really slot into an existing archetype, Academy is a card you build your deck around.  Think of a High Tide deck that can go off fairly reliably on turn 2, and that's Academy.  Even if it wasn't going to break the meta-game in half, nobody wants a tier 1 deck playing Academy, because it promotes the kind of one-sided solitaire play that drives people out of the game.  It's straight-up bad news, no matter how you slice it."

MTGLegacy,394pap,haaayuuuguuuys,2,Tue Jun 9 17:10:58 2015 UTC,"Buying into Elves is about the safest investment you can make in legacy right now (outside of duals). The deck is not favored against the best two decks (Miracles and OmniTell), and it won't be broken by another green draw spell (believe me, we have those already). The only thing another draw engine would add is explosiveness, and that's only if it were VERY aggressively costed, which it won't be because wizards needs to protect Modern. After Deathrite, I'm not sure what wizards could even print to make the deck better. Perhaps a Notion Thief for 2GU? Or and elf that blinks all creatures until end of turn."

However, I love Omnitell, and had it built before DTT made it the bee's knees.  I like 4 Probes, I find the life doesn't matter that much, and I love being able to know what my opponent has. It really helps to know when it is safe to go off, or when you need to find more counters.  I'm running Rushing River, Wipe Away, and Echoing Truth right now. I admit that it is probably wrong. Wipe Away is also used in the mirror, you can cunning wish for it and bounce your opponent's omniscience.   Surgical Extraction is for any graveyard strategy. We are weak to Dredge and Reanimator, so there is an argument to not run Surgical and just hope not to run into those decks.   It seems that people are using the Trickbind slot for either Trickbind or Release the Ants. Again I'm running both. I like to be able to go for the instant speed win, but also go for the Trickbind+Emrakul when it is easier.   Intuition is just really slow. I could see it as a one of somewhere though, it is still useful. I play one in the SB, sometimes you just have to wish for it and go off that way.   I also have mixed feelings about Defense Grid, I've had matchups where it is just great, and wins me the game. I've also had matchups where playing it hurt me more than it helped.  Here is my sideboard right now: 3x Defense Grid, 2x Flusterstorm, 1x Firemind's Foresight, 1x Release the Ants, 1x Intuition, 1x Wipe Away, 1x Rushing River, 1x Echoing Truth, 1x Surgical Extraction, 1x Grafdigger's Cage, 1x Eladamri's Call, 1x Trickbind"
MTGLegacy,394bh6,LRats,3,Tue Jun 9 05:38:08 2015 UTC,I have been testing grixis now for a bit and I love it. I am currently testing 4 Bwish and 3 Cwish. Here is my board:  4   Leyline 2   Boseiju 1   show 1   ETI 1   massacre 1   pyroclasm 1   noxious revival 1   inuition 1   trickbind 1   rushing river 1   overmaster  Maindeck  A. I love the black and red splash. Burning wish is super great for getting S&T more consistently along with access to Overmaster and Massacre. D&T becomes a pretty easy match when you can fetch the 1 main deck underground sea and massacre them.  B. I feel 3 is the right number of probe but I don't hate 4.  SB  A. Haven't tried this on. I gave Izzet charm a run for a bit. Was usually pretty good but I ended up cutting it. Every mode is useful which I like.  B. I like rushing river because of being able to bounce 2 things.  C. Reanimator is such a bad matchup I don't even care at this point. My only hope is to dodge them.  D. I find trickbind/stifle a must. You need to be able to react to what your opponent shows in  E. Haven't tried main deck but I have 1 in the board and I can always inuition for a combination of Emmy/Bwish.

I honestly think the deck is better suited with 1-2 MD boseiju, and with impulse either cut completely, or replaced by Twincast.   The life loss from probe is just one of those ""shit happens"" type situations -- you really cant win em' all, and the advantage of probe in the mirror and pretty much every other matchup can be huge. I've had a probe/surgical win me a game against Miracles by grabbin their red fetch with the surgical to cut em off from their pyros = me going off ....and then in the Mirror matchup, i let the Intuition resolve then BONG! surgical!  I guess my point being theres tons of ways you can utilize surgical, and at the very least sometimes u can just use it EOT to see if you're safe to go off.  As far as twincast goes -- i just love it so goddamn much -- the feeling of Casting a DTT eot, and the coast is clear, then twincasting it is just incredible :  UUUU  Look at the top 14 cards of your library and put 4 into your hand and win the game next turn cuz you're the fuckin man and you're playing Twincast instead of Impulse.   And then when you're going off you can Wish for FF , Grab Wish - Twin - Brain   Wish for Eladamri, Twincast it and win with your 2 emmys.   Or twincast the wish  and grab Eladamri and a trickbind or wutever u need to keep going off.  Idk i love the card, and highly recommend testing it.     My SB right now is completely fucked as i keep expecting certain decks and then none of those ppl show up --- for instance i pulled out Hurkyl's Recall for Echoing truth , and then first matchup against Tezz i got shitted on.  That being said -- i dont run rushing river, but i also only run 1 CoT at the moment as im still waiting on the other copies, so maybe with the CoTs in, i will appreciate it more."

In certain matchups you are effectively running 3 wishes, because 1 is usually alotted to getting something from the SB to deal with the hate.

Doesn't let you use LED.  Finds any card eventually, costing variable quantities of life, from 0-10, and costs two colors of mana so it can't be easily cast a second time off your PiF'd rituals or an LED.

The spike in this case was fueled by Modern staples shooting up in value, and people trading their Modern staples into more stable reserved list staples. My guess is that the price will hold relatively stable until the next spike (no clue when that may be) or a large meta shift (ie Infect starts doing really well)"
MTGLegacy,3935w8,Gordonuts,4,Mon Jun 8 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"I think that we're shortly going to see the same thing we saw after the last Modern Masters release, albeit to a lesser degree.  If you've been watching the interests section of MTGStocks over the last few weeks, there's been way more than the normal number of cards putting up big price increases.  Same as last time, a new Modern Masters is putting a lot of capital into the singles market, which is driving up prices on everything not printed in MM15.  Same as last time, I think people are going to be converting modern staples into reserved-list staples, but not at anywhere near the same frequency as we saw before.  I'm expecting REV Duals to start ticking upward over the months to come.  Not sure if/when they'll hit the highs they were at after the big spike, but I don't see the price dropping any further."
MTGLegacy,3935w8,foldingcouch,9,Tue Jun 9 03:35:42 2015 UTC,"Over the 3 year period: * Exponential growth rate per annum: 24% * Linear growth rate per annum: 31.3% I'd say this is wildly growing value over time, but down from its peak/spike from 14 months ago; which corresponded with Team America and Infect being the performing decks. It only takes one big breakout before another spike occurs.  Granted, if we considered a 20 year period, the growth would be very high too."

Either that, or Legacy and Vintage (and competitive EDH/Tiny Leaders) will be played with high-quality fakes. Which is already happening (It's already ~impossible to distinguish a high quality fake in a double sleeve across the table, and it's not like you will be paying attention during a tournament match anyways). Knowing wizards, they won't let it happen. The reason is simple - it can make them money, just like Modern Masters does. I'm personally predicting a Legacy Masters before the end of 2017 or so."

MTGLegacy,391yk7,Speedbump_NZ,2,Tue Jun 9 12:42:59 2015 UTC,I been thinking about burn alternatives and if you run more goblins like 4 guide and 4 mogg fanatic you can then play goblin grenade. It's pretty solid. You can also play gitaxian probe as it thins your deck and essentially let's you play 56 cards. Could also put in street wraith but you would have to cut the flame rift as you will kill yourself too fast to actually win with all 12 of those in the same deck.
MTGLegacy,391yk7,tiiiki,3,Wed Jun 10 03:26:49 2015 UTC,Tarmogoyf. Preferably in foil.
MTGLegacy,391yk7,vxicepickxv,2,Tue Jun 9 03:28:23 2015 UTC,Oh yeah I've heard of that card. I'll give it a spin. A friend of mine says he has some
MTGLegacy,3918ee,James718,16,Mon Jun 8 14:43:38 2015 UTC,"Dig Through Time is castable before and after Show and Tell -> Omniscience resolves. The DTT just needs to hit cantrips, Cunning Wish, or Emrakul, which is basically your entire deck anyway."
MTGLegacy,3918ee,centira,3,Mon Jun 8 14:47:05 2015 UTC,So then it wins by just finding the wish to get release the ants to then put emrakul on top of the deck?
MTGLegacy,3918ee,wintermute93,3,Mon Jun 8 14:55:50 2015 UTC,"You don't even really need Release the Ants when you're hardcasting Emrakul (or more than one) for 0, but yes, it still has that line (Brainstorm to put back an Emrakul/Omniscience first). You can also Cunning Wish for Eladamri's Call for Emrakul."
MTGLegacy,3918ee,LRats,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:06:35 2015 UTC,You play with 3 Emrakuls?
MTGLegacy,3918ee,wintermute93,3,Mon Jun 8 15:24:29 2015 UTC,"Most  lists use 1-2 Emrakuls. The difference is now Emrakul is the main kill and Release the Ants is the backup. In the Enter the Infinite versions, RtA was the main kill condition and Emrakul was the backup. The fact is, even landing one Emrakul is enough to win a good majority of the time. RtA is there for when 1 Emrakul won't be enough, or your opponent puts something in off SnT that you have to beat immediately at instant speed."
MTGLegacy,3918ee,asjohnson,2,Mon Jun 8 16:28:35 2015 UTC,"I don't actually play Omnitell, but if I did, yeah. 4 Dig, 3-4 Cunning Wish, 2-3 Emrakul.   I think I like 4 Wish 2 Emrakul a bit better than any other split though."
MTGLegacy,3918ee,zetftw,5,Mon Jun 8 15:29:46 2015 UTC,"If you check out burning wish lists it is in the sideboard. I still enter frequently, but off of a burning wish. Dig is just so good. Also folks are off dream halls, which makes eti even worse."
MTGLegacy,3918ee,LRats,3,Mon Jun 8 17:48:09 2015 UTC,"People realized that you don't need it in the list, opens up spots for other cards."
MTGLegacy,3918ee,endlesswurm,3,Mon Jun 8 14:45:11 2015 UTC,"It's too clunky. With DTT you don't need EtI, instead you just cantrip like crazy and then use DTT to find whatever pieces you need, or to continue cantripping if you brick. Like others have mentioned it is great because you can cast it before you Show and Tell, it is not a dead card like EtI."
MTGLegacy,390oot,iPhone747,8,Mon Jun 8 11:47:04 2015 UTC,Have you considered just going grixis instead?  Pyromancer is something you really have to build around and the grixis delver decks really optimize it.  Take a grixis list and ask yourself what you'd be improving by using green instead.    If you're committed to rug I think it's a playable idea though!  Give it a try!
MTGLegacy,390oot,randomnickname99,7,Mon Jun 8 12:57:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the only I reason I can see for YP not doing well in place of Goyf in a RUG shell is the lack of late-game power. RUG is a deck that thrives on keeping both players permanently stuck in the early game -- if your opponent gets 4-5 lands in play and is resolving their threats, you're probably going to die. If things go poorly and the game goes long, topdecking Tarmogoyf is a must-answer clock, whereas topdecking YP is a deal-with-this-when-you-have-time clock. Grixis, on the other hand, lets you live the dream of YP/Probe/Therapy/Therapy :)"
MTGLegacy,390oot,wintermute93,5,Mon Jun 8 14:14:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with young pyromancer in such low to the ground mana denial deck, that is all about efficiency, is that not only do you have to spend 2 mana to cast him, but you then have to play a bunch of spells (preferably cantrips) to produce elementals for him to really do anything, rather than stifling or wastelanding your opponent, while tarmogoyf is just a big dumb guy that beats in for 3-4, and also doesn't get blocked by very much, except opposing tarmogoyfs."
MTGLegacy,390oot,Canas123,3,Mon Jun 8 15:17:12 2015 UTC,"Young pyro dies to even more removal than goyf, so replacing one for the other, and advocating it by saying ""goyf dies too much"" sounds wrong."
MTGLegacy,390oot,Ozy-dead,2,Mon Jun 8 12:50:38 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, but I guess my point is that often Young Pyromancer leaves behind a couple of elementals once he dies to removal."
MTGLegacy,390oot,payl0ad,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:03:41 2015 UTC,"But then, you're still playing a deck which actually wants to use countermagic to protect one of its few threats. Dying to removal is something you accept in a tempo shell."
MTGLegacy,390oot,rifter5000,2,Mon Jun 8 21:40:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's okay if your creatures die to removal because the removal dies to countermagic.   People put too much emphasis on 'dies to removal'. It's relevant for a control finisher because you have to be able to win through your opponents' hands being full of removal they were unable to cast until then."
MTGLegacy,390oot,Umezete,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:36:00 2015 UTC,The problem with just shoeing in pyro over goyf into rug is that rug is really reactive and delver cards like stifle are much worse then.
MTGLegacy,392ag2,James718,14,Mon Jun 8 19:03:45 2015 UTC,"Death and Taxes was at it's best when the premier combo deck in the format was Sneak and Show, because it was a ""fair"" deck that had a positive matchup against the best combo deck in the format.  It's still got a much better matchup against Storm or OmniTell than most fair decks, but it's not as positive as it once was, so it's a little bit on a down turn.  Beyond that, SCG Premier IQ's are smaller tournaments than we used to have and you're seeing the results of a little more variance.  It's still a popular deck, it's still doing fine at winning matches, and I wouldn't be surprised if you saw it in the top 8 of an IQ in the next month."
MTGLegacy,392ag2,jeffderek,9,Mon Jun 8 19:19:37 2015 UTC,This pretty much sums it up. If you try to Karakas an opponent's Emrakul when they have Omniscience in play...you're gonna have a bad time.

MTGLegacy,392ag2,ArgoSaxifrage,3,Tue Jun 9 02:17:28 2015 UTC,It's still a very good deck. The problem is that it isn't well represented on MODO cause of Wasteland and Rishadan Port being an absolute necessity for the deck.
MTGLegacy,392ag2,TheAmericanDragon,2,Mon Jun 8 21:09:39 2015 UTC,It might be a little worse of than it once was but I wouldn't call it dead by any means.  It top 8'd SCG Worcester IIRC

MTGLegacy,392ag2,wintermute93,2,Mon Jun 8 20:42:12 2015 UTC,A long time? Do you mean about a month? People playing Magic are far to quick to dismiss a deck as dead just because it isn't the hype of the month.
MTGLegacy,392ag2,rifter5000,2,Tue Jun 9 03:31:35 2015 UTC,But did it get replaced by NO RUG? /s
MTGLegacy,392ag2,Apocolyps6,2,Tue Jun 9 04:52:18 2015 UTC,"No, it's definitely not dead, it just needs time to adjust to the Dig meta (Omnitell, Dig Miracles and Grixis are all over the place). When the best combo deck in the format is pretty much mono-U, and you rely on nonbasic land hate gameplan - you will have a tough time. Traditionally, DnT relied on bears to fix these matchups (Thalia, Canonist). There are currently no bears that decively win those matchups.   Another side of the problem is that against Dig decks, half of the deck is blanks. Mother of Runes and Phyrexian Revoker are dead draws, and Mystic is not fast enough to keep it in the opening hand against these matchups.   Death and Taxes RnD department has been working hard to come up with changes to fight this new threat. I personally am testing Jotun Grunts and a very light green splash for Teegs abd Choke, while dropping more and more Revokers. One of the DnT pilots at my local LGS runs a black splash and borrows some stuff from Blade decks, mainly discard and surgicals. New set is coming up, and we might get a new bear or a new card to help fix the new Tier 1s.   The good news is - the Omni rampage completely pushed elves and jund out of the game. This leaves pretty much only graveyard combos (who die to Karakas), Storm combos (who die to Thalia and 9999 other white cards), Delvers (who die to Mystic) and Blade decks (who just die) against us."

MTGLegacy,392ag2,Ozy-dead,2,Sat Jun 13 02:17:50 2015 UTC,D&T was the 3rd best performing deck last month. Not sure why you think it's dead?  http://www.channelfireball.com/articles/may-2015-legacy-metagame-analysis/
MTGLegacy,390hpv,hopppz,9,Mon Jun 8 10:24:09 2015 UTC,"I think it's just worse than regular High Tide, which is in turn probably just worse than Storm. Solidarity is more sweet than any of those decks, so it's kind of a shame, but I think that's the truth of it."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,cromonolith,3,Mon Jun 8 10:26:51 2015 UTC,"I've been playing Solidarity for years, the deck isn't tier 1 for sure, and often people call it worse than spiral tide. In my opinion that is not completely true. I've played both decks for quite a while and honestly I think Solidarity isn't worse than spiral tide; the matchups are just different. While spiral tide needs only 4 islands , high tide and spiral to go off Solidarity usually requires 3 cards in hand or then you have to be lucky with meditate / DTT. The current metagame isn't in favor of solidarity over spiral tide but you have some nice options. Like boarding into 4 DTT against discard is quite nice and you can also board into Vendillion Clique / Venser / Snapcaster beat plans against miracles and other slow decks. I think the deck isn't a turn too slow, its just that it has some really bad matchups like miracles which is a popular deck right now. Though I have to say that in the current meta I prefer solidarity over spiral tide any day."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,rrrOuta,1 point,Mon Jun 8 13:34:46 2015 UTC,Do you know if there is an up to date primer on the deck?
MTGLegacy,390hpv,rrrOuta,4,Mon Jun 8 13:56:28 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid not. I can give you my decklists , also if you are interested you can watch my stream on twitch.tv/ikirouta , I usually stream legacy dailies and I play solidarity only."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,cromonolith,1 point,Mon Jun 8 16:58:00 2015 UTC,That's awesome. I didn't know anyone was doing that. I'll definitely check it out. How often do you stream.
MTGLegacy,390hpv,rrrOuta,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:23:14 2015 UTC,"like once a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. I won't stream much during summer but ill start streaming more in august."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,RedeNElla,1 point,Mon Jun 8 18:31:42 2015 UTC,"I found your Feb list, has it changed much since then?   The whole idea of ""in response to losing game, I win game"" is fascinating, and I love that you're making it work."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,RedeNElla,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:09:23 2015 UTC,Can you post the feb list?  until /u/rrrOuta comes back with his current list please.
MTGLegacy,390hpv,rrrOuta,1 point,Tue Jun 9 09:56:09 2015 UTC,"http://www.reddit.com/r/MTGLegacy/comments/2ttes8/solidarity_sideboard/ I just googled his reddit username and solidarity and found this post.  I'm curious if he's changed much, as well as if he's decided on the final sideboard slot. From comments it sounds like he was keen to try a clique."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,rrrOuta,2,Tue Jun 9 10:58:48 2015 UTC,"10 Island  8 Fetch  4 FoW  4 Impulse  2 Opt  2 Flusterstorm  2 DTT  2 Snapcaster  4 High Tide  4 Brainstorm  1 USZ  3 Turnabout  3 Meditate  3 Remand  4 Reset  4 Cunning Wish  SB:  1 Brain Freeze  1 USZ  1 Meditate  1 DTT  1 Surgical  1 Ravenous Trap  1 Cryptic Command  1 Echoing Truth  1 Wipe away  1 Rebuild  1 Turnabout  1 Pact of Negation  1 Snap  1 Merchant Scroll  1 Clique  is my current main list, I also run a snap + snapcaster based list do you peeps want that one too?"
MTGLegacy,390hpv,Zeggo,2,Tue Jun 9 12:11:25 2015 UTC,"also, to avoid confusion. I've played solidarity for along time but I was lost for a year around 2013, thats why my feb post says ~6months, I started playing solidarity again in September 2014"
MTGLegacy,390hpv,Feline_o1,1 point,Tue Jun 9 12:12:58 2015 UTC,Yeah if I could have both that would be great  *edit I didn't read you'd posted the twitch link :)
MTGLegacy,390hpv,Feline_o1,1 point,Mon Jun 8 19:27:40 2015 UTC,I'd also be interested in checking out your decklist. I put Solidarity together a year ago but never really played it much. Now I'm looking for another legacy deck and it may be time to bring it out.
MTGLegacy,390hpv,gropingmantis,3,Mon Jun 8 23:06:01 2015 UTC,"I believe overall Solidarity is just weaker than Spiral Tide, even though I enjoy both and wanted to see Solidarity become a thing after Dig was printed. Though even now Spiral Tide isn't putting out numbers anymore, this year it hasn't had a single top 16, and as a big pusher of the deck myself, I've been playing a lot less since the change to Legacy with the format structure this year, it's just not worth it for me to push PiQ's every weekend. I get more out of trading at events though so I still go to many of them.   When the main event is Legacy however, I am on Spiral Tide right now! So still rocking it but, not nearly as often."
MTGLegacy,390hpv,Umezete,2,Tue Jun 9 11:46:21 2015 UTC,"Feline as your the authority on high tide could you suggest a list for solidarity, I know you've said your on spiral tide but do you have an up to date list?"
MTGLegacy,390hpv,5028,2,Tue Jun 9 13:42:24 2015 UTC,"the last list i used for solidarity was the same as the jersey one, though I'd at this point cut down to 1 brain freeze in the sideboard."
MTGLegacy,38z74c,Tharen101,11,Mon Jun 8 02:09:11 2015 UTC,"All you need with Release the Ants is a big CMC spell on top of your library. Brainstorm accomplishes that just as well as Enter the Infinite.   Once while playing Death and Taxes, I showed in a Spirit of the Labyrinth and my opponent showed Omniscience. He then cast a Brainstorm just to put two cards back with Omniscience among them, then wished for Release the Ants."
MTGLegacy,38z74c,cromonolith,10,Mon Jun 8 03:16:11 2015 UTC,That is the saddest thing. Did you then put sadness on the stack?
MTGLegacy,38z74c,xxmrscissorsxx,8,Mon Jun 8 10:45:34 2015 UTC,sadness is like poison counters... doesn't use the stack.
MTGLegacy,38z74c,unstoppable-force,3,Mon Jun 8 11:49:09 2015 UTC,Notice that a lot of list don't even play Release the Ants anymore. It occupies pretty much the same slot as Trickbind; the later requires much less setup and is thus often preferred.
MTGLegacy,38z74c,CeterumCenseo85,2,Mon Jun 8 08:44:32 2015 UTC,"After you show in an omniscience, You play cunning wish and wish for firemind foresight. You get another cunning wish, an impulse, and a brainstorm. You get release the ants with the 2nd cunning wish, you play impulse, get the highest CMC card, or something like a dig through time, cantrip until you get emrakul or another omniscience, brainstorm, putting emrakul/omniscience on top, and then release all the ants you want."
MTGLegacy,38z74c,MelonJuice7,3,Mon Jun 8 02:12:49 2015 UTC,I thought it likely involved firemind foresight and hoping to put a card back with brainstorm but I wasn't sure if there was some guaranteed way to get the highest cmc card. So I guess you could still brick but it is nice to have the option to try to go off in response to something or kill without attacking in the face of something like ensnaring bridge.
MTGLegacy,38z74c,MelonJuice7,2,Mon Jun 8 02:16:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it can be done at instant speed, so if the opponent shows in an oblivion ring/venser/whatever, you can actually just kill at instant speed in response to the triggers. Yes there's no guarantee that you'll have a super high CMC card, but it's better than NEEDING an eti on top of needing show and tell and omniscience."
MTGLegacy,38z74c,Dat_Gentleman,1 point,Mon Jun 8 02:22:02 2015 UTC,It's also not hard to know when you can expect to win via Ants and when you should just grab and cast an Emrakul instead.  It would take a bit of desperation or error to end up in a situation where you were only able to release a single ant because you lost the clash.
MTGLegacy,38z74c,LRats,3,Mon Jun 8 03:42:53 2015 UTC,I would just like to say you should probably hold the Cunning Wish for last. You don't want to get stuck with Release the Ants if you brick on BS/Impulse. You might need the Cunning Wish for Trickbind to save your Omniscience if possible.
MTGLegacy,38z74c,MelonJuice7,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:42:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry I didn't mean in that particular order, just what each card is there for but yea absolutely correct to wait till afterwards to cunning wish."
MTGLegacy,38z74c,LRats,1 point,Mon Jun 8 03:44:07 2015 UTC,"No need to apologize.   I just didn't want someone to get confused and do that first, I was pretty sure you just didn't put them in a particular order."
MTGLegacy,38z74c,Tophtalk,2,Mon Jun 8 03:48:34 2015 UTC,"Also, some lists still play a silver bullet ETI main board, for example."
MTGLegacy,38yil9,Buddyboy451,6,Sun Jun 7 22:46:39 2015 UTC,"I just recently finished mine and found cutting snaps for ponders and finding room for DTT really helps the deck play smoother and run more naturally. Try cutting snaps, 1 jace/Lili, and the main board councils judgement cause that double white is rough next to Lili double black"
MTGLegacy,38yil9,montebanc08,1 point,Sun Jun 7 23:56:48 2015 UTC,"Also, are 3 TNN really necessary? Most decks can perform quite well with only 2, especially as the amount of ponder/brainstorm/dig are increased."
MTGLegacy,38yil9,MelonJuice7,2,Mon Jun 8 02:15:20 2015 UTC,"Deathblade is a deck that wants to play 3-4 TNNs, unlike UWR lists. Deathblade is, effectively, an aggro list with a lot of removal and disruption, where UWR goes more in the direction of control.  The only reason I play 3 TNN in my list instead of 4 is in concession to a combo heavy meta. I run a 1-of Tasigur, who is an easier to cast clock against decks like Storm/Omni/Reanimator."
MTGLegacy,38yil9,atlimar,3,Mon Jun 8 15:18:32 2015 UTC,Do you happen to know any of the decks you will be up against?
MTGLegacy,38yil9,montebanc08,2,Mon Jun 8 02:39:29 2015 UTC,"Congrats!  It must be a great feeling to have it finished, no corners cut or card restriction any longer.  Deathblade is a very fun deck and, while maybe not well positioned, is very strong and can definitely do well.  I've seen people who love their archetype play it even when it is much worse off than yours, so don't feel bad.  I think the most important thing to take into a match with Deathblade is assessing what your role is in the match.  You have tools to play any role, whether aggro or control, whether to focus on overall value and card advantage or to put all your eggs in the basket of one game - breaking card, and you need to be able to recognize and implement the proper strategy.    Remember that the best strategy can change partway through a game, so don't ever get complacent and let yourself fail to reevaluate your position regularly.  It is also important to understand what cards are important for the matchup and which ones you can afford to get rid of.  Knowing to keep Stoneforge against burn is pretty simple but deciding on a Council's Judgment versus a Spell Pierce or a Jace versus a Snapcaster Mage early in a game is much harder.  There is a high skill ceiling with the deck so keep working on your play and you will notice improvement and become more successful over time.  Enjoy yourself, this is the coolest format in magic and you are playing a collection of the most powerful fair cards ever printed."
MTGLegacy,38yil9,Dat_Gentleman,2,Mon Jun 8 03:39:59 2015 UTC,Dig Through Time makes deathblade a very hard deck to beat for most fair decks.
MTGLegacy,38yil9,steve2112rush,1 point,Mon Jun 8 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! Deathblade isn't quite as badly off as people try to make it sound like, and as an added benefit we are off peoples' radars a bit.  I made the move over to Deathblade half a year ago (ultra greedy 4c version) and haven't looked back since. I've fine tuned my list based on my tournament performances (I play in any competitive event I can access), and have built a list I quite like in the Miracles/Omni/BUG meta.  I like your list, but I have a few comments:  I have found Creeping Tar Pit to perform very badly, and have cut it out of my list entirely. I'd suggest that would be your first cut for a Dig Through Time. Running a single utility land (Karakas) is already a stretch with our tight mana base, but I like it in your list with both Clique and Venser.  I don't have extensive testing with it, but the little I've tried it I haven't been too fond of Council's Judgment, and I'm running a main deck Engineered Explosives instead.  I haven't tried running two Jaces, but with the current meta I think running more than one is too much. He's amazing in the deck, but very often too slow, and you need a high enough density of disruption before you can get to a board state where he will actually have a detrimental impact on the game. I might cut one for a second DTT.  Other than that I really like your list! Is your local meta largely fair, or combo based? My own list is quite tuned to beat other control decks and fair decks pre-board, and doesn't have a very strong combo matchup until post-board.  How have wastelands been performing for you? I've cut mine and run additional Ponders instead, even though they are brilliant with Deathrite.  My list: http://decks.deckedbuilder.com/d/77987 let me know if you have any questions (the copious amount of 3-ofs may look weird, but there's method to the madness :) )  Edit, For GP Lille I'm considering different ways of fitting the 4th Force of Will into the main deck, which would give me an additional board slot for either Venser, another Jace, Flusterstorm, Containment Priest, Pithing Needle, or SoFaI... the decisions."
MTGLegacy,38yil9,atlimar,1 point,Mon Jun 8 08:19:51 2015 UTC,Dig Through Time and Lingering Souls are really strong cards in the grindy matchups.. You definitely want to make room for at least 2x DTT.
MTGLegacy,38yil9,hymn22rock,0,Mon Jun 8 16:32:43 2015 UTC,Played this deck before... I think 4+ flash guys is always the best way to go... I started with basically your list exactly but shaved some stuff for 3 snap 2 clique
MTGLegacy,38yil9,I_use_bro_mockingly,0,Mon Jun 8 05:17:53 2015 UTC,"I know you're going to hate me, but as I look at your list all I can think of is ""game two, kill the Deathrite and blood moon""... have you thought about a basic swamp somewhere in the 75 for the decks you know might side it in against you to get the quick concession?"
MTGLegacy,38yil9,jj702561,2,Mon Jun 8 07:45:03 2015 UTC,"While Blood Moon is a back breaking card, there are quite a few ways Deathblade can deal with it, even without basics. At least when it comes in shells like Miracles/UWR Blade/UR Omnitell.  We have proactive cards like Thoughtseize/Hymn. We have Counterspells, Force of Wills, and sometimes Spell Pierce to slow it down. We can float green and black in response and Abrupt Decay it. If you know you are playing against a deck that might board it in, adjust your game plan.  While sometimes you lose to it, it's unreasonable to fear the card so much that we dilute our deck because of it. It's not impossible to handle. It's only really a huge problem when facing decks like Painter, that has 8 Blood Moon effects that can hit the board on turn 1."
