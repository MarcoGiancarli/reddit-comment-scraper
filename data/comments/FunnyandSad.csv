FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,albertowtf,7,Mon Jul 20 00:07:47 2015 UTC,"Not sure just how accurate it is that nature would survive well enough after we're done with it, but it's still a really great panel. Love it."
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,IAmHyperdriver,26,Mon Jul 20 03:48:10 2015 UTC,It survived mass extinctions of over 90 % and a frozen earth so whatever we're doing doesn't even come close.
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,cefarix,3,Mon Jul 20 03:54:23 2015 UTC,"Very true. I should have clarified. It's very likely things will survive in the end, but I don't get the impression that everything will be honky-dory like Gaia seems to be suggesting. We'll be taking a lot with us before we go. And I'm not sure what we took will be replaced."
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,IAmHyperdriver,12,Mon Jul 20 04:59:48 2015 UTC,"But that's part of what she means by ""change and take new forms"". Things will never be the same because species went extinct forever and the planet got (mtemporarily) hotter so things will be quite different in the end but the planet (and nature) as a whole will make a full recovery with new species and everything will be honky-dory, it'll just be different"

FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,Cloud_Chamber,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:40:16 2015 UTC,"Yup. A species becoming self-aware, having deep passion for studying anything around it, and constructing things that mimic nature or even improving upon it from the basic elements found in nature is as natural as ants building self-sustaining colonies."

FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,fakewars,2,Mon Jul 20 10:00:45 2015 UTC,( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) not that I'm complaining
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,DragonSlayerYomre,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:11:49 2015 UTC,"Nice thought, but no. Humans are literally a mass extinction event. In all likelihood, anything that takes us out is going to be so catastrophic it will kill most if not all life on the planet.   Edit: I mean, theoretically there will be some things that survive even a nuclear holocaust, but I wouldn't call tiny radioactive amoebas and tardigrades being the only survivors of the human experience ""not killing nature."""
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,Codoro,5,Mon Jul 20 08:12:19 2015 UTC,"The worlds had several mass extinctions.  Tiny survivors can be something big again in time.  Even if we killed every known or unknown living thing, what's to say the same events that caused life to appear won't simply happen again? Billions of years is a long time."
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,enceladus7,0,Mon Jul 20 09:48:17 2015 UTC,I think you and the person behind the comic are severely underestimating humanity's ability to fuck up the planet.
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,Codoro,7,Mon Jul 20 09:57:02 2015 UTC,"I think you are severely underestimating nature. Earth has things immune to radiation, things that can survive the vacuum of space. Right now there are chunks of Earth floating in space from meteor impacts covered in microbes  likely to return, something that's happened a few times already.  No matter what we do, life is gonna stick around."
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,enceladus7,0,Mon Jul 20 09:58:50 2015 UTC,"See, that's part of what bugs me about this entire argument. Humans are part of nature. Even this comic humanizes gaia. The argument that nature won't miss humanity could be used to argue against any other animal or plant that is an inconvenience to something else."
FunnyandSad,3dvzfg,Codoro,3,Mon Jul 20 10:01:00 2015 UTC,"Well yea we are. Doesn't mean it makes any difference to nature when we're gone though, which is something a lot of people seem to think differently in comparison to any other animal or plant."
