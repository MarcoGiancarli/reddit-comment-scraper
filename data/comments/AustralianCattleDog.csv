AustralianCattleDog,3e4b57,ANormalSpudBoy,2,Tue Jul 21 21:13:56 2015 UTC,Do you have any idea what he is mixed with?  He looks a lot like one of our mixes
AustralianCattleDog,3e4b57,Drackonn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:58:48 2015 UTC,looks like possibly a Boston Terrier
AustralianCattleDog,3e4b57,cheezgorditacrunch,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:36 2015 UTC,"I doubt it's a Boston Terrier like other person guessed. Pic is taken from above so his body looks smaller then it is, he's about 50 lbs. A lot of people have guessed Pit but my housemate (who's a bit of a breed nut) doubts it. What are your mixes?"
AustralianCattleDog,3e4b57,Drackonn,1 point,Tue Jul 21 23:47:31 2015 UTC,Ours were guessed to Pit mixes also. They both weigh about 60 pounds. One has blue mottled and looks exactly like a cattle dog but he built like a pit. The other looks like your guy.   They are litter mates but we're rescued so they don't really know. There were 3 of them and we have 2.

AustralianCattleDog,3e2kn9,edmdaze,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:09:26 2015 UTC,7 weeks- 6lb 9 weeks-8.3 lb 12 weeks- 10 lb 3 months- 13 lb 4 months 18 5 months- 23lb shes 5.5 now probably around 25lb i think my girl is going to be on the small side i have asked the vet every time i go in and they say she is on the right track ( i think she is small compared to other acd that are 5-6 months)  3 months at 7.6 seems small but unless the vet was concerned about his size i wouldn't worry...you could have got the runt of the litter  edit: this is what i can remember
AustralianCattleDog,3e2kn9,edmdaze,2,Tue Jul 21 14:53:46 2015 UTC,Thanks that's useful.   The vet wasn't concerned with his size as he's healthy and he's eating right. I was just concerned he's just on the small side and wasn't sure what the actual norm was. As long as he's healthy all is good. My brother's Aussie was born a few days after him and completely towers over him.
AustralianCattleDog,3e2kn9,Darrq,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:06:39 2015 UTC,i have a good friend whose acd is smaller 30-35lb and his brother got one a couple months ago at 9 mo he was almost 70 lb hes the biggest beat of a dog i have ever seen i think they really can range in size.  As long as he is eating and drinking water like he should i wouldnt be too worried!! enjoy them while they are still small!!!

With all of our efforts, we received zero calls and it appears he was just abandoned at the park in our neighborhood. Took him to the vet, got his shots (we were able to confirm he had not gotten them do to a minor case of worms), got his heart worm meds going, and got a new kennel. They are adjusting quite well!"

AustralianCattleDog,3dybkq,sheilahulud,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:25 2015 UTC,"We got our blue at 6 weeks and made sure she was well socialized. People, dogs and other pets were no problem. We got our red from a rescue site. He was 8 months and had spent his life in a kennel with his litter mates. It took a while to get him out of his shell. He's a sweet goofy guy that adores us, but not into anyone strange. He's a floor licker."
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,drumsareneat,2,Mon Jul 20 16:10:02 2015 UTC,"I would say my ACD does chew a lot, and he's 10 months old. My advice would be: constant vigilance.  Start building habits now. Always put your shoes up or in a closet, don't leave clothes on the floor, close the door to rooms where things might be on the floor. If there's a way to put a cap on the corners of your baseboards, or to cover the legs of furniture etc. then I would advise you do it. Invest in good chew toys, lots of 'thinking' toys like kongs and other food-dropping toys that can make meals turn into fun games that keep the mouth and mind entertained. I use apple sauce frozen in kongs, or pumpkin puree, and that can usually keep pup busy for 45min trying to get it out. I often will put his breakfast or supper in a kong or other toy with holes in it and it keeps him busy, and I wasn't keen on giving him rawhides but I realized he needs that chewing outlet.  We also cut old used towels into strips and braided them to make ropes to chew on and play with (do be careful, if the pup is a chewer you want to inspect toys regularly and trash any that can't be salvaged).  It's not a question of STOPPING chewing, it's just a question of ensuring that pup only chews on things you want them to so you can build good habits. The way to do that is to keep tempting things away and out of reach, and to make sure there are LOTS of options in the way of good things to chew.  I would highly recommend bitter apple spray, apple cider vinegar, and hot sauce for baseboards and chair legs. I have these bar stools that are metal, and they have been lifesavers in terms of not being chewed.  Crate training is also something to consider. If you're not going to be supervising puppy (I'm talking in the room with him) then put him in the crate. Crate all night, crate if you're out of the house, because the more your eyes are on that puppy and can catch any bad behaviours, the better habits you'll be building.  In terms of exercise I'd recommend an hour and a half of vigorous exercise every day. My heeler really enjoys taking a basketball (the most durable compared to soccer balls) and herding it in circles for hours. It totally exhausts him. He also enjoys obedience classes and participating in rally obedience, which are great mental exercises that exhaust my little guy. He's also super social, so I take him with me everywhere and that also tends to tucker him out.  Bottom line, be vigilant and exercise lots, but chewing is an issue at that age and it's something some dogs can take a couple of years to grow out of. In my experience, it hasn't been too hard to handle, and what little damage he has done to shoes/baseboards hasn't been too bad. A couple of pairs of flip flops, lots of shoelaces eaten out of running shoes (why the shoe laces, we don't know) and then one area of the baseboard that he really enjoyed, and my husband's favourite pair of dress shoes. All easily fixed, or replaced."
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,sincerely-sacha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the feedback.  I've already put some things into play.  I just brought him home but he's all drugged up from the neutering surgery. He's not interested in anything, understandably."
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,sincerely-sacha,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:46:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah I found mine was also fairly dopey after neuter, and most of the small dogs I've had before seemed to recover better from it. He did, however, only need about a day before I literally couldn't hold him back from functioning as normal, so you may not get as much rest as you were hoping for ;)  Mine also ran into a glass window, so ya know, let the hilarity ensue."
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,sincerely-sacha,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:23:26 2015 UTC,Well sleep was definitely compromised.  He got close to jumping out of his enclosed fence after 10 minutes of being alone right at bed time.  My girlfriend had to sleep on the couch whIle he slept on the floor.  She held onto his leash all night.
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,psychofilly,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:20 2015 UTC,"I would HIGHLY recommend crate training. My heeler screamed like crazy for two nights, and he was crated in a separate room from us across the condo. We slept with earplugs, fans, and AC on to drown him out, and he went for potty breaks at midnight, 3am, and 6am was wake-up time. On the second night, my husband threw a tshirt into the crate with him that he had worn, and one of mine, since that night he has been absolutely silent every night.  Seriously crate train your pup. You will get way better sleep, as will your girlfriend, and you will both be 10x happier. Your puppy will also be equipped to handle crating at a moment's notice, which is incredibly convenient, and doing it now will save you the trouble of having to crate-train an adult dog."
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,Vectorbug,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:11:13 2015 UTC,Got him in a crate today for 4 hours and he completely ripped some of the bars off. I'm really glad he didn't hurt himself.   Edit* Yes I had chew toys and a Kong with frozen pb.
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,ceresadeth,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:41:09 2015 UTC,"Mine was a chewer, oh god. She chewed our brand new bedroom suite that we had just received only a couple of months before. She chewed shoes, and towels and anything she could get a hold of. She even chewed a cord while we were asleep and blew the tip of her tail off. It took a good two years (you are half way there, yay!) However, the other poster is right, lots of toys to redirect the instinct and lots of activity and the pup will be fine. I know our hated anything vinegar-y. So mild hot sauce and ACV worked wonders.   I think I'm going to try the frozen treats in a Kong toy myself. We have a 4-5 month old shepherd Boxer mix we just adopted who is keen to chew."
AustralianCattleDog,3dyk24,Floonet,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:15:16 2015 UTC,"If mine (5 yo) has something to chew on he will chew until he can swallow it or until there is just bits laying on the floor but he will not chew on random things (except sometimes dirty underwear). I lucked out with a very well behaved ACD however, I can't imagine him at 11 months.  With my dog, simply jogging with him isn't enough, he needs to herd - he needs a job, so we play fetch every day until he needs to lay down after each fetch or becomes too slow to catch the thing before it lands. We go on 6-12 mile hikes with lots of elevation change now and then too and that will make him very tired but I don't bring him with me to shops and bars or anything, he gets too restless."

AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,corntortillas,13,Wed Jul 15 14:28:46 2015 UTC,"She has pretty much every symptom of anxiety.   In short ACDs are all about doing jobs. Jogging will make them tired, but its not really a task they'll find reward from. ACDs might as well have been created in a lab to only do one thing: work for you. So you have to give it tasks: like fetch (herding), or agility training (thinking and solving problems) so that it feels like its done its job and can rest.  When I adopted my 4 year old ACD he had a lot of separation anxiety that felt like pent up energy, but I believe it was confusion and a sense of being totally and utterly lost in a way that only an ACD experiences the world. I couldn't leave him tied up outside the donor shop / cafe while I grabbed a quick to-go order, even though he had a clear line of sight to me through the open door 5' away. He would yelp the way only an ACD would yelp and completely ignore anyone who tried to pet him and make baby noises at him. Same thing with bringing him to work if I had a meeting, or leaving him in the car on a cool day to run in and get a hot chocolate, etc...  This slowly went away.  ACDs aren't like normal dogs when it comes to bonding with their masters (and I really believe that is the correct term with regards to this breed: master. I am not his parent. He is not my buddy but I am his supreme commander and he wants to be my right hand man). If my ACD could crawl inside me and wear me like a suit so that we would never be apart, he would.  But as time went on, it got better.   I don't jog very much with my ACD because its not really a ""job"" and my ACD in particular is more of a sprinter (he is also very big for an ACD, 50lbs) We play fetch every day until he needs to sit down and take a minute to cool down and then after this his personality is totally calm and (to me) he acts like he ""earned his right to be at ease"". One thing that really helped was taking my ACD to Agility class. He picked up on what I asked him to do immediately. Running up the giant A-frame, through the tunnel, across the balance beam, etc... Then we created a routine and connected each challenge and turned it into a course. He was exhausted after the first 50 minute appointment - and not once did he expend the intense amount of energy he does when we play fetch (sprinting). So a huge part of this is mental exhaustion and discipline. Now when we go play fetch at a park, I'll tell him to hop up on a picnic table or tree stump, stuff like that and reward him. These are tough dogs. They're bred to nip at the hooves of cows and other livestock which will kick the shit out of them. My ACD is missing several teeth from before I adopted him. I accidentally threw a frisbee over a terrace with a 12' drop on to pavement and my ACD faithfully leaped over it. When I ran down to him he had a bloody chin but was wagging his tail and ready to keep playing with the look on his face: ""I did it, I got it for you!"". I could hardly forgive myself. His medical record state that he has injured his paws/legs several times playing fetch for his previous owner. Get pet insurance or start an emergency vet fund. Again the ACD wants a job. If he/she is doing a job for you and being rewarded, she feels as though this is her ticket to heaven. But think about it from the dogs point of view - she just lost her master (the one she would follow through hell) and now she is learning to trust you. During this transition she is going to have a lot of anxiety, she is going to be very lost - she might as well be dropped off in the middle of the pacific ocean. So she needs tasks, routine, discipline and distraction as you form a bond and hierarchy.   Like I said, although my dog was a very good boy when I adopted him he had issues, as time went on, it got better. It's a double edge sword because they are not going to automatically trust you and as they get comfortable with the neighborhood by marking it, they're going to get a bit territorial. My ACD became leash aggressive, but is great off the leash when walking around my hood (which I don't do very often). When we are at the dog park (or a regular park) he doesn't care at all about any other dogs. They'll try to play with him and steal his frisbee/ball, and he just shrugs and sits down. People want to pet him and talk to him like a baby and he gives no shits.  So to solve the leash aggression, when we walk I make him carry a toy in his mouth. Boom. Totally passive. Because he has a job to do. This also creates the expectation that if we're carrying the toy, we're going to play fetch - which has its pros and cons. But for us, it works.  A couple of years have passed and he is still a little leash aggressive without a toy if I am distracted, be we have used a clicker and treats to combat this. As soon as I see another dog - before my dog spots it - I tell him to sit. Whenever we play fetch out front of my house, whenever another dog comes by (even though he doesn't care), I hold the toy and tell him to sit while the neighbors pass. Then I reward and resume playing.  This is all amateur anecdotal experience. I never took my dog to a trainer other than agility sessions. I've made a lot of mistakes along the way. It's a lot like adopting a child. The child is already 4 years ahead of me, and I'm just now learning how to be a parent. Whereas if I adopted the dog as a puppy, I'd learn how to be a parent as the puppy learned how to be my dog.  They are very smart dogs, one of the smartest but they are not people, so you can't treat them like how you'd treat a person. So don't feel bad when you discipline them for breaking the rule, but do reward them when they follow your rule and do your best to make the rules clear and positive."
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,Vectorbug,5,Wed Jul 15 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"This is way above reddit's pay grade. It sounds like you are doing everything you can. Call the vet specialist back and reiterate that your dog is aggressive and is responding to training negatively. Ask them to please bump your appointment up because you are fearful of escalation to dangerous behaviors. Make sure they understand the severity of the situation, and you may get a closer appointment time.  If all else fails, there are specific ACD rescues with experienced foster 'parents.' You may contact them just to ask for recommendations on training, or if you need to, ask them if they could find a home with less environmental ""threats"" for lack of a better word."
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,thatweirdfemale,3,Wed Jul 15 16:24:08 2015 UTC,"I definitely agree. Sounds like she is trying hard but this sounds like a tough dog. But it's only been three months! If the poor dog had a tough home life before it might take much longer to get good results, but they will come eventually. Personally I would ditch the pinch collar and focus on whatever the dog seems to enjoy."
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,uncwil,2,Wed Jul 15 16:40:42 2015 UTC,Thank you for saying this. I will try again with the vet. I really am trying.
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,steverino75,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:25:33 2015 UTC,Why wouldn't you look for another vet who specializes in this?
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,Bronconation,2,Wed Jul 15 18:50:10 2015 UTC,I honestly find walking not enough for my purebred heeler. Obviously every dog is different but he truly isn't tired unless he exerts himself. He needs the sprinting to actually tire himself out. Learning new tricks is also a great way to mentally tire them out. Im sure most heelers behave like brats if they dont get their exercise. As for the aggression I'm not entirely sure how to deal with that since I got my guy at 8 weeks and he was well socialized between the dog park and daycare when he was young. I hope you find some solutions to your problems because they are amazing dogs.
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,steverino75,1 point,Wed Jul 15 15:53:10 2015 UTC,I find the same: without a fast back-and-forth of fetch at the park mine is never going to be tired out.
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,Mule2go,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:18 2015 UTC,"You are right in wondering about the training methods in the class. Find one that uses positive reinforcement. Better yet, start now. I can't even begin to think how a heeler would turn out using punishment. For all their bluster, they are sensitive dogs."
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,jbishpotter,2,Wed Jul 15 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"Kudos to you for a adopting! But that shelter is crazy.  Australian Shepherds are territorial, high strung and can be pretty bad with kids just like heelers and every other herding dog.  Our Heeler is great with kids and much more accepting of strangers than our Aussie.    Negative training makes no dent with these dogs. They are pretty much bred to be indifferent to pain.  Ours repeatedly jumped a 6' brick wall because we used to live next to a lab who was her bff.  I'm sure it hurt, but that didn't stop her.  Our Aussie is terrified of the vacuum cleaner and hides under the bed as soon as it goes on. The heeler comes tearing out to bite it and try to save me.  Positive reinforcement is the only thing that works and consistency is really important.  I take half her dinner and make her ""work"" for it, reinforcing all the little tricks/obedience basics.  Sit, stay, wait, lay down, shake, roll over, etc.  Kikopup has some great training videos on youtube.  We did 2 levels of obedience and our trainer often repeated, your dog wants to please you and do what makes you happy.  They just don't know what you want until you train them.    Right now our heeler is on restricted activity with no running, no walks other than potty because she tried to fight a racoon and got her foot sliced.  An hour of obedience work over the course of a day is enough to keep her calm and relaxed even with no exercise (although exercise + obedience would be better).    Teach a working dog to fetch and your whole life will change.  Once she gets it, really make her work for it. Ours have to sit, lie down, or shake before the ball gets thrown.  I've read that helps them learn control with the herding instinct and will make them better with kids/chaos that would ordinarily rile them.  Even if you're not ready/able to go to the dog park, we play short distance fetch or hide n seek in the house.  Mental exercise is really key, if they get bored, that's when they get creative.    Abby (our heeler) has some strong separation anxiety.  It has gotten a lot better with time.   I freeze food and peanut butter in kongs or those bones you can stuff so she doesn't see me leave and then she will rest quietly until I get back.  But I can't crate her if she hears me at home unless I want to listen to the Heeler song for every minute until she can see my face.  I can't run a quick errand and leave her in the car or she just starts ripping the car apart.  But I can take her to any dog friendly store with me, and she will walk quietly beside the cart, sit and wait while I pick things out and generally behave better than most kids I see in stores.    These are tough dogs, but also very very rewarding.  Once you start working with them it is really exciting to see them learn and grow and you can tell that they are so happy and engaged learning new stuff.  They are incredibly loyal and loving to their person."
AustralianCattleDog,3ddupx,TimblyBimbly,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yes! Make them work for everything, they like it! Dinner - sit, wait, lay, okay then they eat; fetch - trick first, then throw, drop it, then trick then throw; guests come over and they bark? Leave it, good, sit, have guests give them the treat.

AustralianCattleDog,3d5ty3,ASU-Vols,2,Mon Jul 13 23:43:30 2015 UTC,"Yes to both. My older Heeler, 7, gets possessive of ice. I used to bring a couple of bags to the park, we live in Arizona so it's hot, and she would lay in the middle of the pile and bark at other dogs who tried to get a piece.  Both of my Heelers bark like crazy when we get ~3 miles from the park. And don't stop until we enter. I chalk it up to them being excited. And when we're in the car I can't tell them to stop, they're both deaf. So, I have just learned to drown it out."

AustralianCattleDog,3d5ty3,trose89,2,Tue Jul 14 13:13:23 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's too much stimulus for her in the pool? I would try getting her to sit next to you calmly while you fill the pool. Similar with the barking, a lot of training is just distracting your dog away from stimuli that cause bad behavior. If she's barking on the way to the park gate, just stop and wait for her to calm down before continuing. My pup learned pretty fast because her desire to go in the park outweighed her desire to bark and be crazy."
AustralianCattleDog,3d5ty3,dt_jenny,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:20:58 2015 UTC,do you just wait for however long it takes?  a lot times if i wait in the car at the park she will just keep barking even if i ask her to sit.  i would say too much stimulus is probably correct about the pool she gets really excited when the hose turns on and a lot of other dogs get pretty pumped up about the water running as well
AustralianCattleDog,3d5ty3,dt_jenny,2,Tue Jul 14 14:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the advice I've heard is to just out wait the dog. I've gone to a trainer that also recommended sort of annoying the dog into stopping for barking like that. You basically take their collar and pull up lightly while vibrating their head. The dog will get annoyed and stop. Just make sure you aren't choking her haha. I'll just calmly whisper listen, shh, listen to mine while doing that as well."

He was found wandering around without a collar on Edisto Island in SC. He's such a good dog, but also an escape artist, so that's most likely how he ended up at a shelter."

AustralianCattleDog,3cb4mn,ccellofleming,2,Mon Jul 6 15:08:36 2015 UTC,"I taught this behavior with free shaping. Fi LOVES playing the shaping game, so I simply presented the switch to her and she experimented with it. Here are the steps I rewarded:   Any interaction  Only nose/mouth touches (no pawing) Interacting specifically with the switch, and not the whole cover Harder and harder touches Upward motion (If she had offered downward motion first, I would have taught that, but she seemed to want to go up)   Here is video of her consistently switching it on in a more ""normal"" vertical position.  Then, because Fi is an experienced thinking dog, I wanted to see if she could generalize on and off. I added a pen cap to the switch to make it easier to flip (I got this idea from Emily Larlham.) And bam! She could do on and off without retraining the behavior. I don't want to have to worry about 2 different cues, and having to know which way the switch is, so I use the cue ""switch"" to mean flip the switch opposite of how it currently is.  I got the idea for the switch on a stick from Donna Hill, and my husband was the one who made it for me :)"

AustralianCattleDog,3c9d8f,steverino75,3,Mon Jul 6 03:39:23 2015 UTC,Good point. How long do you think we should give her before trying to get back into her regular routine? Any tips to get her more comfortable in going back out?
AustralianCattleDog,3c9d8f,steverino75,5,Mon Jul 6 03:46:22 2015 UTC,"That was a little snappy, my apologies. Honestly it's going to be up to her. I'd recommend taking her for a very short walk first thing in the morning - just long enough to do her business - then normal routine as much as possible. I would actually avoid using my training methods to try to get her back outside because then she may start associating those training methods with her fear response. Instead I'd suggest taking some of her favourite toys out to the yard - and ensure that she sees you doing it so she knows where they are. At the same time I'd move her food near the door to the backyard and slowly move it closer and closer to the door so that after a couple of weeks she is being fed outside in the backyard. But those recommendations are based on my heeler who is incredibly food obsessed and is utterly oblivious to anything else when food is around."
AustralianCattleDog,3c9d8f,tau-lepton,2,Mon Jul 6 03:56:03 2015 UTC,then she may start associating those training methods with her fear response.   Agreed 100%
AustralianCattleDog,3c9d8f,LaraWood,1 point,Mon Jul 6 11:25:39 2015 UTC,"Didn't seem snappy to me haha.  Her food is pretty close to the back door already, she didn't eat last night and this morning I had to put a sprinkle of shredded cheese in it for her to eat. Then she just hauled it back to her crate.  She doesn't care too much for plain toys, but she loves her treat puzzles, dentastix, bones, hooves and Kongs. That could be a good start, although once she sees we're trying to get her to the back of the house, she'll retreat to her crate and none of the treats we offered her would get her to come out. We did try closing the crate, but she knows something is up as soon as the crate is closed so she hides back behind our furniture.   I don't know why our dumbass neighbors decided lighting a pack of blackcats at 9:30am was even a good idea. It isn't like we threw her outside in the evening or afternoon, the normal times people are shooting off fireworks."
AustralianCattleDog,3c9d8f,tau-lepton,2,Mon Jul 6 04:29:42 2015 UTC,"that really sucks. My ACD seems to hold on to fears like no one's business. that said, we are working through her issues with nail trimming SLOWLY... but surely.   I have found with mine the best way to deal with her fears is to be as nonchalant as possible. to the point of being comical about it. the more i stress about things the more she picks up on them and will freak out. so don't coax her to the back door. calmly walk there and offer whatever treat (high value is important) she loves and just put it down in the general area of the back door.   all that said though, i agree with other posters that you should give her some time to recover from being scared that badly. I know it's not your ideal situation but you have to change up your morning routine a bit. forcing her to use the backyard is going to make things worse in the long run."

He hated it to the point that he would quite literally make me walk off sidewalks to avoid sprinklers. Now that we are living in Georgia and it is nearly 100F everyday, I am thankful he had a breakthrough a few weeks ago. We started tossing his favorite ball in the ocean just enough to get his feet wet and he responded well and got a lot of praise. He then followed another dog into the mud pool at the local bark park that he was following and mimicking. Now we have a little kiddie pool in the backyard that he lays down and relaxes in to avoid the heat. We haven't gotten him to ""swim"" per say more then a foot or two but he really loves getting wet now."

Out running near the end of our run the trail went really close to the creek that was high due to the rain the day before. I think she didn't realize how deep it was and in the water she went. She was paddling with all her might upstream but she wasn't going anywhere (up or down). I scrambled to my knees and grabbed her harness and dragged her out. She was really close to me the last half mile and hopefully it didn't traumatize her too much."

AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,malmcb,6,Fri Jun 26 13:28:20 2015 UTC,"Give them all treats. And lightly discipline the puppy in front of the other dogs. Help them establish the pack heeirarchy. Your older dog doesn't want you thinking the puppy is the boss, he's still the boss, after you of course. It will probably help the puppy and let him know to look up to the other dogs by establishing them as more dominant members of this pack"
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,abortedfetuses,3,Fri Jun 26 15:35:50 2015 UTC,"Congratulations! You already know about the constant talking/barking, as for introducing him to new friends... I'd say introduce them one at a time. My ACD loves other dogs, but gets nervous when he first meets multiple dogs. Then again, that's just my guy. Best wishes."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,Th3KangolKid,3,Fri Jun 26 13:49:33 2015 UTC,My girl was similar. She did great with meeting dogs 1:1 but even 2 dogs scoping her out at the dog park made her tail go between her legs. A year later she's much less anxious.   We also take her to puppy day camp once every few weeks when we have evening plans so she can both socialize and mental stimulation up the wazoo.
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,CSArchi,3,Sat Jun 27 10:29:27 2015 UTC,Bring the new pup into the yard put him down and walk away. Focus your attention on the old dog first then let them meet each other on neutral ground. Keep a keen eye as it might not go smoothly at first. Be ready to step in.   Have you watched the pup in it's current home? Especially during meals? If the wee one had to be competitive for kibble/nipple he might be aggressive about food in your home. That's something to discourage. Focus on them having a soft mouth at meal/treat time and they will be less likely to be aggressive with each other at any time.
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,wynper,3,Fri Jun 26 16:23:21 2015 UTC,"Make sure the adult dogs have ways to escape the annoyingness of the puppy. Help the puppy make the right choice when the adult dogs tell her to take a hike. Sometimes this means limiting the pups freedom in the house by using a leash, pen, gates, crates, etc. You want to foster a good relationship, which means managing the annoying factor that puppies often bring to adult dogs."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,OrangeCrushinator,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"I wish I had done better with this. Our Australian Shepherd is 3, and he is a ""high energy"" breed but I forgot how wild puppies get. Our ACD is almost a year now and she still wakes up full throttle ready to furniture parkour/chase him around the house when he would really like to just pee and then sleep a little more.  I also wish I had worked on bite restraint more, because although she knows not to nip people or strange dogs, she does nip her ""brother"".  Its playful but also kinda annoying."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,jbishpotter,3,Tue Jun 30 02:05:16 2015 UTC,"Get him used to brushing early. I really wish I had done this with my dog. When we got him I'd never even heard of ACDs. He was a side of the road puppy. So when he blew his coat for the first time I was shocked that my ""short haired"" dog suddenly shed enough for four dogs. He hates brushing, so spring, when he blows his coat for the summer, is... ""fun""...  That's aside from normal new puppy stuff. And post pictures! No such thing as too many puppy pics."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,shiseido_red,1 point,Fri Jun 26 19:36:31 2015 UTC,"You could try this for the brushing (not sure quite how bad your dog is about it, but it may help). Tie the dog up to something with his leash make it shorter if you need to keep him from leaping all over. Have a second person hold a spoon with peanut butter on it in front of the dog, just out of his leash range (so basically the dog is at the end of the leash, focused on that spoon). You brush once, then have the person give the dog a small lick, then brush twice- small lick, brush a little more- small lick, until you can brush more and more and for longer durations of time. You can do this alone as one person too, and just set the spoon down out of his reach, but it works a little faster if you have two people.   When both my ACDs were young they hated baths (would shake and cower) and I used this method in the bathtub too. Only I put the PB along the side of the tub and they would lick it all off, took about 3/4 of the time it took to bathe them. After a few baths they were running to me for bath time instead of running away! And now they are great for baths, no PB needed (but I still give them a treat when we're done cause they're just so good and cooperative)."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,OrangeCrushinator,2,Tue Jun 30 02:59:25 2015 UTC,"That's a great tip. Thank you. Usually when he starts getting that cotton ball coat when it's shedding time we just go outside and vigorously pet him (with fingertips, almost a scratching motion) until we get the free hanging fuzz off. We do this every day in the spring time usually. He's 10 now, and I try not to stress him too much, but the peanut butter idea is a great one. Will definitely try it next bath time."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,shiseido_red,1 point,Tue Jun 30 03:40:52 2015 UTC,"My ACD/Jack Russell mix loves baths so much he tries to climb in whenever he notices that it's the faucet running and not the shower. Water falling from overhead = NOPE, water to lay down in and get a brushing, yes please.   This is really only a problem when the bath is for me. :)"
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,newenglandnoir,4,Tue Jul 21 19:29:36 2015 UTC,Do not bring the dog inside until it goes to the bathroom outside your house.  That will be a good way to start establishing potty training.
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,adaires,2,Fri Jun 26 17:02:41 2015 UTC,Don't let them off leash till the recall it 1000%.
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,bicykyle,0,Fri Jun 26 17:08:23 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with this one. I've had mine off-leash from day one - moving from side streets to main streets in a city of 1m+. As a result he never runs off or chases anything, and I can leave him untied outside any store and he'll never wander off. Of course, he's terrible on-leash now..."
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,steverino75,2,Fri Jun 26 18:35:28 2015 UTC,I don't know how you can disagree with this advice. Maybe you misread it but I don't know why anyone would let their dog off leash if it wasn't fully trained to come back yet.
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,bicykyle,1 point,Sat Jun 27 03:26:54 2015 UTC,"you were lucky. please, never advise people to have their dogs off leash, especially ACDs, which are a nipping/herding breed. For the record, I've taken my girl off leash on walks since day one (13 weeks), but was lucky as shit that I had her on leash when her instincts kicked in at ~5 months old and she decided the car passing by is something she needs to herd.  Yes, you should practice off-leash behavior in places where it is safe - dog parks, going on hikes etc. You will mostly not have a problem with recall because these dogs are DEVOTED AS FUCK and they won't want to leave your side most of the time. But there will be distractions that will play on their instincts, and you don't want your dog running across a busy street to get that squirrel/bird/truck in line.  My girl also decided at one point in her life she must herd bikers and runners - it's not full on aggression but she will nip because she is a cattle dog and thats what they do, and most people that don't know dogs will be petrified, and she can still do damage with her teeth, if even by accident.  These dogs are not for off-leash until you build up amazing levels of control (which should not be a problem if you work on it because they are smart and devoted, but it will take some time).  Good luck!"
AustralianCattleDog,3b6vxl,domepro,2,Fri Jun 26 20:09:38 2015 UTC,I have several chewed on pieces of furniture from when my ACDs were little (up to 2yo) and I left them loose in the house while I was gone or not watching them.  Enough said.  Wait...had to edit.  Totally worth it; they are my little girls and I love them.

She'll stop mid-run and just lay down, looking for a belly rub.  Running is just not in her nature.  Unless you crack a hard boiled egg.

AustralianCattleDog,3b33a1,bristleboar,2,Thu Jun 25 19:06:25 2015 UTC,my ACD mix could care less about toys for the first few months we had him. He was 4 or 5 mod when we rescued him. Somewhere around 9 or 10 months the chasing instinct kicked in. Basketballs drive him absolutely insane.  SOON.
AustralianCattleDog,3b33a1,thewolfmansbrotha,2,Thu Jun 25 23:16:32 2015 UTC,"Mine is ALL about the chase. But the second he gets the ball, he just finds a nice comfy spot to lay down with it."

If it's any consolation, ACDs' hyper-intelligence seems to make them grow up a bit faster. Mine's just a mix from a shelter, but by the time she was 8-10 months old she was totally house broken, had stopped play biting, knew furniture was a no go, had sit/lie down mastered, and was an angel on a leash and in the car.

He lived to the ripe old age of 16 before he started having some heart problems and we had to take him to the Vet for the last time. So with any luck I can have Zeke in my life for about that long. Ill have to track down some pictures of Spotty and post them some time.   In the house Zeke is a ninja pooper and pees without squatting sometimes so its hard to catch, but it hasn't been everyday, so for his age I can't complain. We have been using the clicker training method on him and I can see a huge difference between how fast he is learning compared to Spotty. 2.5 weeks and (with many treats of course) he's got a good grasp on Sit,Lie Down, Roll over (in one direction) Speak & Quite, Shake (which ever paw he feels like for now) and the latest ""handsome"" , sitting straight on his hind legs with his front ones in the air."
AustralianCattleDog,3ayihg,edmdaze,2,Wed Jun 24 17:20:40 2015 UTC,"No idea what she is. The rescue had her down as a heeler/border collie mix. My vet has her down as a kelpie/heeler mix. She was found on a ranch in a tiny cage with 3 other puppies at about 9/10 weeks. Poor thing was filthy, covered in fleas and had almost zero human socialization. The rescue only had her a couple of days when we adopted her, but they did have 2 other pups from her litter. They were both bigger than Lemon and mostly white with black spots and ticking. Neither one had the same face coloring or dark gray fur. I've seen one of her sisters recently (one of the ladies that works for the rescue ended up adopting her) and there's definitely cattle dog there. Here's a bonus pic of the day we brought her home.  Sounds like Zeke is pretty brilliant for such a young guy. Can't wait to see pics of Spotty!"

AustralianCattleDog,3awsqa,bumblebiscuit,2,Wed Jun 24 13:52:11 2015 UTC,So how is that working out? Completely honest and interested question here! What made you decide on a second? What are the biggest challenges with two pups? How did your first little guy take to a new sister coming into the picture?   We have an 11mo boy and would love another. I'm torn between thinking he would LOVE  a playmate and be stupidly jealous of a new puppy taking time away from his people

AustralianCattleDog,3awhdi,rejonkulous,2,Sun Jun 28 19:14:25 2015 UTC,Our has destroyed every toy we've ever thrown at him except for one. It's a three ended (triangle shape-ish) stick made from recycled car tires and we've had it for three years and it has never succumbed to the abuse. It's probably just the material that makes it like that but I bet a pet store will probably have something like it.

We've had to complain about 1 toy so far, but they sent us $10 to play with in the barkshop and the original toy was only worth $7 so I was happy. We've discovered that his favorite flavor in the entire planet is duck, which I probably never would have even bought for him in a pet store. For the first year of his life we've decided to celebrate every quarter birthday, because he's growing so much and it's so special. For his 3 month we went to petsmart and got 1 toy and a chew. For the same amount of money, I just got his 6 month presents from the barkshop and ended up with 3 toys and a venison trachea. They also have cheaper beef tendons than anywhere I've found online, and I trust the quality a lot more. They make doggie spoiling so easy!"
AustralianCattleDog,3awhdi,Masterniles,2,Sun Jun 28 19:12:15 2015 UTC,"I've only received one box, but I subscribed for more, just because of the quality of the treats!! We are picky about food/treats, we do the no grain, wheat, fillers kind of stuff; that's what all the treats were in her box! I was sad she tore through her two toys within an hour. But, I did take a survey that was sent with her box, and someone got back to me within 24 hours, updating her profile for tougher toys! ♡ so excited for her July box"

AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,jtkendall,2,Tue Jun 23 23:06:45 2015 UTC,"What sort of treats were you using? That makes a big difference. Were you using bacon, hot dogs, cheese, or were they the boring dry packaged things? Was the class too stimulating? Was it in a small room with not enough space between dogs? Another big difference. The quality of the instruction can also make a big difference, especially if you're just learning clicker training. There are many good trainers at the big box stores, but there are many more woefully inadequate ones. Try another class with a KPCT or APDT certified instructor."
AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,Mule2go,2,Wed Jun 24 01:01:39 2015 UTC,"They were Milk Bones, different flavors to keep things interesting for him. Tried hot dogs and cheese but when he wants a treat he stares at the Milk Bone box, he completely ignored the hot dogs when the trainer tried them today.  He occasionally will accept a pig ear as a treat, but only if he really wants it; otherwise he ignores it and stares at the Milk Bone box or where it was if it's been put away.   The class was in the middle of the store, he was the only dog in the class the last few weeks. They like to only have two dogs per class max, there was a Chihuahua the first class, but it was deemed too aggressive to be in the class with him since it bit him the first day. It could very well be too distracting for him, last week he didn't listen well, but there was a dog in the grooming area barking it's head off.  It wasn't clicker training, it was whatever the positive training PetCo allows in their store. Basically lots of praise when he does something right and a treat, when he does something wrong or doesn't listen you basically ignore it. I certainly don't want him to have any training that hurts him, but I didn't like that when he does something wrong I wasn't allowed to say no. I think knowing that ""No"" means he's doing something wrong would be beneficial.  I doubt I'll be able to convince my cousin to try another trainer, but I'll look into finding one and suggest it.  Thanks."
AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,edmdaze,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:55:54 2015 UTC,"i know you said he is an older dog but i have found that the clicker and using ""yes"" as a positive reinforcement has worked wonders.  but like the above the type of treat can make a difference i have a couple different treats high end (freeze dried pork) for serious focus and training and then dry cookies for a quick recap also i would try one on one training maybe in a bathroom or bedroom with no distractions. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I CAN STRESS IS ONLY SAY THE COMMANDS ONCE...once and then make them do the command...if you dont do this you are teaching them they get to decided when its time to work and when they can get away with something.  i am trying to get my pup into a training course i really am looking into former k-9 trainers- best of luck"
AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,edmdaze,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:01:47 2015 UTC,"I just got back from chasing him through the neighborhood because someone came over and let him out since he was by the door. No shoes and a mixture of rocky gravel and hot blacktop has lead me to the decision that it's time to learn more about clicker training. Of course once he peed in someone else's yard and ran himself tired he was ready to drag me back to the house insisting that I hurry because I have to have forgotten where it was.  I'll give your suggestion about saying the command only once and working in a room without distractions a try this weekend since I'll be the only human around. I'm also going to pick up some block cheese and some other things that I can give him small pieces of as treats to see if that works. He generally turns down cheese, but it's typically sliced and I think he's on to the fact that he gets it when it's time for a pill.  Since he was looking at me while I typed this I felt obligated to share a photo of him. Here's Bandit."
AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,Pazzito,1 point,Wed Jun 24 21:59:25 2015 UTC,my older dog realized the cheese trick quickly...chicken or turkey slices work well!  i always keep training to 10-15 min so they dont get tired of it or bored.  most important thing is while you only say the command once give them a 3-5 seconds to perform trick and if they dont you show them how and keep doing this until they get it down...i watched a ton of youtube videos to help with the training process - also petco sucks for them to not train a dog because he isnt treat oriented is just lazy plenty of dogs are fine with a scratch under the chin for a job well done! keep your head up! also for the jumping up and stuff when you walk in the door...once you get sit down we broke my acd of this from when we walk in the door she has to sit to get pet...shes isnt sitting petting stops until she sits again she is still wagging her tail to the point she is scooting herself across the floor but hey its better then her jumping!  the biggest thing though would be recall you can work on this when you are in the house if you dont see bandit just call his name wait for him to come and treat just do that randomly a couple times through the day so he is associating you calling him to good things!  you can also get really long leashed like 10ft+ to work on this command outside give him some slack call him in wait if he doesnt come on his own reel him in and give treats...it just takes time sorry for the long paragraph! but best of luck!!! and since we are sharing my pup
AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,bg0nzales,2,Thu Jun 25 12:27:05 2015 UTC,"For the backyard, get him a 30-40 ft check cord to run around with. Ie: http://www.gundogsupply.com/luckydognoknotcheckcord.html   He will learn that you can always reign him in. A good check line shouldn't tangle or pose a hazard to the dog. It's the best way I've taught proper recall and boundaries. Positivity on top of that should help. My pup wore 8 ft one inside and a 20ft one outside for reference."
AustralianCattleDog,3avzcd,Nugginz,2,Thu Jun 25 02:52:58 2015 UTC,"Do not put a a harness on him, he hill just get into work mode and pull pull pull.  Be very polite and stern with your guests, tell them before they get there, or when they arrive, that your dog is in training. Ask them to not acknowledge him when they enter till he is calm and respecting their space. Give them permission to push him down if he jumps up on them. If he continues, you intervene with actions in conjunction with commands as reinforcement. If you have unexpected guests, simply step outside, shut the door, and inform your dog is in training.  Use liver treats. They are small, but very tasty and quite small. Use them only as positive reinforcement for specific response to a command, not just because he is looking cute.  FINALLY, I cannot stress this enough, tell your dog only one time what you want them to do (sit, come, release, down, stay et.) If he does not, very calmly but assertively enforce your command with action and repeat the command only when you are physically following through. ACDs will always always always see how serious are with your commands, till the day they die. This trait is who they are and what makes them great herding dogs - they constantly push the boundaries in hopes of gaining just one more inch. Inch by inch they herd cattle.    Remember, if you only follow through on the 6th command, your dog will wait 6-7 times to do what you are asking - if you are lucky.    Be assertive, use positive energy, but always follow through nonverbally and with love.    If I can I will make some videos of Lola and I and post.   EDIT: Spellings"

When we get home from our family walk after dinner, I take it off of him and set it down randomly somewhere in the house.  I used to lose it, but then I started showing him where I was putting it, and he remembers where I left it.  Now I just say, ""Simon, COLLAR!"" and he goes and gets it, no matter where I left it and drops it at my feet while whining uncontrollably with excitement for a walk.

If my older dog falls for it, he'll runs outside, and Chevy grabs a mouthful of his food and takes off. But, now my old guy is on to him and he'll walk away from a full bowl of food and wait. When Chevy goes in for a bite, my old guy jumps up like cujo and chases after him barking. By the end of dinner time, my entire front room is covered in dog food from Chevy dropping it as he's running. None of its aggressive, which makes me think it's just a big weird game of ACD tag."

She loves to chase balls, sticks etc. but never figured out (or I never properly trained her) the ""return"" part, so we get a chase, followed by a proud dog parading her prize around the yard or on the riverbank.  She sleeps on the couch in my office every day, 5 days a week I'm in here working, on weekends she waits for me at the office door, even after I've left for a gig (sound engineer). Creature of habit.  Every night after dinner she HAS to have a bully-stick. If we don't produce one, she is a whining wiggling mess. She also has the short attention-span, so sometimes after we give her one she'll go in the yard & drop it, and will return to whine some more. Quite the exercise in patience for us, eventually she gives up & finds the one we gave her earlier.  The 1-year old kitten and her team up on rodent patrol. Sometimes a gopher is too big for the cat, he'll run to get Bandita and she'll go in for the kill.

He will then eat the rest of his food. Then he will carry over to the couch and plop it down beside himself and fall sleep with the bowl beside him.

AustralianCattleDog,3atluz,p8ntballa100,1 point,Tue Jun 23 16:27:12 2015 UTC,"Mine can squish, wiggle, claw, chew, or jump his way out of any enclosure. He's gotten out of our chain link fence by opening the gates, actually separating some of the poles and bending back the chain link in one corner, jumping over where there used to be a platform that barely gave him enough clearance to jump over. We had a zip line for him for a while where there was a long line hanging off that attached to his harness - no matter what type of harness we tried, he could get out of it. He squeezed through a triangular hole under the porch railing that I couldn't believe he fit through. Once we were living in the country and we had a small window that was high up on the wall and ended up being about 1.5 stories up on the outside. We left that window open with a window fan totally covering the opening, and the fan was on. We left to go grocery shopping, came back an hour later, and the cat was somehow on the front screened porch with the screen door shut, our other dog was hanging out by the front steps, and our ACD came trotting out from around the shed, totally proud of himself. We found the fan on the grass on the side of the house, no idea how all of this happened.  He's calmed down quite a bit since then but we really didn't know what we were getting into when we adopted such an intelligent dog. Now he protects our son without fail, heck, when he was learning to walk, Duncan walked alongside our son and would give him a solid surface to bump against if he started tipping over. He's an incredible dog, no matter how many times I've had to search for him in the freezing cold or blistering heat, or how much I had to pay to get him out of the shelter once after he ran away. I feel so lucky that we found that adorable puppy for free on Craigslist and made him a part of our lives forever."

We give her to daycare sometimes and photos of her are taken the during the day. I look on Facebook and what's happening in every single photo she is in? Yes, you guessed right! She is on her back with her legs spread with multiple dogs sniffing at her huha. EVERY.SINGLE.PHOTO.   I no longer thinks it's a submissive thing. It's a slut thing. She's a ho! (But i love her to bits)"
AustralianCattleDog,3atluz,totoswanson,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:04:17 2015 UTC,"My 5 month old puppy is in training to be a therapy dog. He LOVES kids. Infants, toddlers, older kids, you name it, he loves it. He's gentle and polite and super cuddly. I work with an animal rescue organization, so we do adoptions from 11-5 at petsmart on Saturdays. Naturally, he comes with me and walks around next to me getting used to people and noise and other craziness. He has every petsmart employee and phoenix volunteer well-trained. He knows how to be adorable and convincing and get treats from everyone. He got a 12 inch bully stick out of a lady the other day, and manages treats from every employee he sees. It's insane. Also, since he's teething and it's the middle of the summer, I've made him two different types of frozen treats to soothe his gums and I freeze his kongs periodically. Now he assumes that every time I open the freezer it's for him."
AustralianCattleDog,3arxpv,bootsontheground1,11,Tue Jun 23 00:50:47 2015 UTC,"We were meeting up with my in-laws at the dog park. Our ACD, Dingo, was chasing tennis balls when a robust couple arrive with two equally robust cattle dogs. Our dogs greet, so the humans start chatting. Right in front of this couple my MIL says ""Why are they so fat? Your dog isn't that fat. Are they supposed to be that fat? They are pretty big....""  I was horrified and these poor people were devastated. They quickly walked away while I fumbled with words about the breed 'looking kind of thick'. I was angry later, realizing that her comments might discourage them from coming to the dog park again. I wish I could go back and tell them to ignore her, they were doing great by taking the dogs out. Why the fuck would anyone insult someone trying to be better?  Ignore the haters. Keep it up."
AustralianCattleDog,3arxpv,snap_crapple_pop,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:24:25 2015 UTC,"Our girl was a fatty when we adopted her. It's been a slow road, but she's loosing weight. If you haven't looked into lower calorie kibbles yet, I would recommend it. It's been helping our girl a lot."
AustralianCattleDog,3arxpv,Laika_Pup,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:16:32 2015 UTC,"You can substitute a portion of his food for green beans, they are low calorie and mostly filler. Also, don't run with him to substantially, his weight could cause a torn ACL. Try long walks before, move to light jogs, and then ask your vet about running. My dog had a torn ACL and I got him TPLO surgery, it's quite pricey.  I cant take him on runs anymore because of it, but he can go on short jogs. My main point is be aware of how hard you are training him, and good luck!"
AustralianCattleDog,3arxpv,kwasmosis,1 point,Tue Jun 23 12:28:45 2015 UTC,It's basically a jog for me and a trot for him. He is 9 now so I don't want to over do it with him
AustralianCattleDog,3assfy,SuperCoolant,2,Tue Jun 23 05:37:19 2015 UTC,Are the cattle dog broke as in seen a dog up close before? If not then I would leave mine on a long leash. Wild cattle are dangerous and your dog needs to be taught the basic commands of herding before being let go. There is more to it than just putting your dog in the field and letting it go. Mine herds and I never would turn mine out first thing without basic herding command obedience.

AustralianCattleDog,3aqyxl,strikt9,1 point,Tue Jun 23 02:58:32 2015 UTC,"Bahaha, I coned just at night, but I wish I had had a donut like this. It's priceless! Trying to keep his activity level low though after the neuter...well...that was just a big, giant failure."
AustralianCattleDog,3aq099,ACD_Throwaway,6,Mon Jun 22 15:54:53 2015 UTC,"Sounds to me like he's getting plenty of exercise and attention.  You're doing fine.  If he were being destructive, I'd say he needed more exercise, but honestly from what you described, it's plenty.    I have lazy cattle dogs.  A 3 year old and 6 month old.  They get about 15 minutes of frisbee chasing 4-6 times a day and that is more than enough for them.  The puppy gets in his crazy modes at about 8 PM at night where he needs about 20 minutes of high energy play time, but other than that, he's fine and just sleeps all day (I work from home, so he gets plenty of attention and if he wanted more exercise, he'd get it)."
AustralianCattleDog,3aq099,adaires,5,Mon Jun 22 16:34:27 2015 UTC,"I think you're doing fine. My heeler Feste Waffles is 3.5, and he usually gets two one-hour blocks of exercise per day. We generally do a 3-5 mile run in the morning and then an hour of fetch at night. He seems happy, healthy, and non-destructive, so I call that good. Last summer when I was back at home in the country for a month, he got to do the shorter bursts of activity like you describe, and he seemed to like that better, so I don't think your regimen is lacking.  One thing I've noticed lately is that he does have a ""sad face"" when he's getting ready to take a nap, though, and sometimes his sleepy face makes me worry that he's depressed. I think it's just a combination of his sleepy face and the fact that since he's been 3 years old he doesn't seem to be quite as crazy-active as he used to be. Maybe what you're experiencing is a maturing dog?"
AustralianCattleDog,3aq099,firsttimetexan,2,Mon Jun 22 16:42:12 2015 UTC,"To me it sounds like he gets a good amount of exercise. In my opinion you might just be worrying too much. I always feel bad when I don't get ACD enough exercise, but I try and make up for it later with Lake trips and dog park time."
AustralianCattleDog,3aq099,kiltstain,2,Mon Jun 22 16:34:32 2015 UTC,"If he seems happy and playful with you and not destructive then I would say you are doing absolutely fine. And don't forget that physical activity isn't the only way to make a dog happy and satisified.   I find that training sessions are way more fun for my ACD then fetch. And the bonus is that you can combine the two! ALL INDOORS TOO. Just throwing the ball up in the air or Frisbee up a little bit and having her catch it works. As long as you are giving your ACD enough attention and love, that's all you need. Training also creates a stronger bond than just playing. Teach him something hard. Such as heeling, or cleaning up toys. something that requires a lot of strong communication between the two of you.  And remember: Dogs should be a fun addition to your life, not just another chore. I think you are doing great.   As for the aggressive part: I would suggest starting off small. In this sense I mean: get your ACD together with a friend's dog you may know very well and is calm/not aggressive. The key is to associate positive interactions with other dogs and then build up to larger groups (i.e. a dog park)."

AustralianCattleDog,3afali,charlie_bugs,20,Fri Jun 19 17:38:15 2015 UTC,Anybody else disappointed by the lack of Cattle dog in Fury Road? I think ending would have been perfect if he walked off into the sunset with a heeler pup following him.
AustralianCattleDog,3afali,BWCA,3,Sat Jun 20 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"Kirsten Fedderson, a professional animal trainer, said they spent time filming a flashback with a blue heeler.  Although there were a lot of quick images of the past in Fury Road, 'Dog' apparently didn't make the cut.  Maybe it will show up in an extended edition and / or a deleted scene."

AustralianCattleDog,3afali,HunterS,4,Fri Jun 19 18:50:05 2015 UTC,My blue just places things as awkwardly as possible while you're trying to work so you have to throw them out the way. She drops toys in front of the lawn mower because she knows I'll stop and throw them instead of running them over. They're too clever.
AustralianCattleDog,3afali,ohhorrow,3,Sat Jun 20 08:16:10 2015 UTC,"if you aren't paying enough attention to my red, you will find yourself on receiving end of whatever she wants to play fetch with. There has been countless time that I will be playing with my daughter and suddenly get pelted in the side of the head by a rock, pinecone, ball, whatever looks kind of interesting."
AustralianCattleDog,3afali,WaffleMonsters,3,Fri Jun 19 23:14:40 2015 UTC,"Heelers are well known to stash items, the dog has a marker hidden in the woods.  The lack of opposable thumbs does slow him down a little."
AustralianCattleDog,3afali,tau-lepton,1 point,Fri Jun 19 23:58:24 2015 UTC,"My heeler's favorite thing to hide is the toilet plunger. Where does he hide it? In my bed, usually. Clean laundry works well too. After that he loves hiding kitchen utensils."
