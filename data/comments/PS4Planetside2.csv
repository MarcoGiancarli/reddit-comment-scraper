PS4Planetside2,3e1vs9,SylverV,12,Tue Jul 21 11:09:34 2015 UTC,"I'm actually very glad that I got the albums done before the preview function was released. Otherwise I probably would have lost motivation and left the VS one unfinished.   Moreover, if the PS4's preview is anything like the PC's, the objects being previewed suffer from a bizarre lighting angle and colour (under-lit by white[?] light but with an amber reflection to one side), sometimes making it difficult to tell how an object would look under daylight conditions.   Still, I can rest easy knowing that people probably won't pester me for camo versions."
PS4Planetside2,3e1vs9,ArK047,2,Tue Jul 21 12:17:33 2015 UTC,"yeah the ingame previews fairly awful, BUT bill (art head) does want to use the skybox lighting instead of the curent weird one.  skybox lighting  some cool effects in there"

PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,Dark_Jinouga,23,Mon Jul 20 14:33:50 2015 UTC,Many posts about this topic. I will upvote every one of them. This is something that needs to be addressed!
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,attackoftheasshole,12,Mon Jul 20 15:08:46 2015 UTC,"This is mentioned so so much since before the game was out, you'd think they'd think about changing it by now. It's probably the biggest complaint about the game.."
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,BWalker66,8,Mon Jul 20 15:54:19 2015 UTC,If you are squaded the auto spawn constantly tries to put you with your squad. Even if there is only one squad member somewhere else on the map. Leave your squad and it helps a lot. The only time I get sent somewhere random is if the base I try to spawn into gets captured. Then the game doesn't know where it should logically put me.
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,Flincher14,3,Mon Jul 20 16:02:26 2015 UTC,"well this could solve that issue, thank you very much :) makes sense to keep squads together, i just wish there was something somewhere that would explain all these details."
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,Heratiki,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:04:38 2015 UTC,I wish it wouldn't automatically put you in some random squad when you come into the game. Maybe try and squad me up with online friends if there is room.
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,RiffRaffDJ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"This isn't a problem on PC. So long as Outfits and Platoons aren't in the game, squads are pretty much useless.

PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,unobtainaballs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:48:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, extremely annoying. You can't even spawn in some bases with the L1/R1 that are being taken. Crashed today 3 times.."
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,Hunsvotti96,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:49:21 2015 UTC,Every time I couldn't select a particular base to spawn in there was a reason why.   Enemy has destroyed the SCU Base is too far from current position  We haven't gained complete control of territory yet    Apart from those times when the whole map UI freezes up ofc.
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,unobtainaballs,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:04:39 2015 UTC,That base was so small it didn't have SCU and it was connected to friendly bases. My death position was about 1km from the base underattack.  And yep that map freeze is really annoying too. It's just instant action then and hoping to spawn in a base that is actually in action.
PS4Planetside2,3dy73v,I_HEART_GOPHER_ANUS,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:19:21 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Yup, sometimes that doesn't work either so I try Squad Respawn, Warp and then closing out.."

PS4Planetside2,3e00gh,5FVeNOM,3,Mon Jul 20 22:36:26 2015 UTC,The game was playable before the patch. Now it just crashes every time I load in and try to spawn. Pretty terrible.

Yeah, keep spawning me at this sunderer 100m away when there are several much closer to the enemy base. Oh, and then randomly auto spawn me somewhere else across the map with a 30 sec loading screen.

PS4Planetside2,3e00gh,Terradyne,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:48:26 2015 UTC,This is just the nature of many free to play games. They're generally extremely buggy because you have to manage your programmers time against what you're making on the game which can vary significantly. This isn't a 60 dollar game where you can make a profit upon release fix any bugs and then continue to make money on dlc. And if they're already making money on a buggy game what motivation is there to commit larger resources to fixing it?

PS4Planetside2,3e00gh,dota2nub,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:18:56 2015 UTC,Considering me and my friends haven't been able to play for more than 20 minutes without it crashing pretty sure this is a big bug that shouldn't have made it through.

Besides, up close there is always mines and c4s."

PS4Planetside2,3e0e2u,TheReplacer,5,Tue Jul 21 15:33:23 2015 UTC,"While I agree with the position that it shouldn't one shot anything, most if not all of the reasoning in this video is complete nonsense. Even if it did one-shots to the head up to a decent range, it does not measure up to actual sniper rifles in the slightest regard. It has the damage per bullet output of a semi-auto, a worse rate of fire than the Railjack, and worse accuracy than the poverty BASRs.  And the fact that rocket launcher splash damage is regarded as a major downside in itself is laughable to say the least. You'd have to be trying pretty damn hard to even put a dent in your health with your own rocket splash after the nerf. And the idea that engineers with BASRs would be more threatening than infiltrators is so stupid I just can't even. The Engineer cannot cloak, which is extremely crucial. Engineers also do not have EMP grenades nades or motion spotters. It all sounds like some theorycraft BS some guy who installed the game last week came up with."
PS4Planetside2,3e0e2u,doombro,3,Tue Jul 21 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"gotta admit, I was laughing for a lot of this video, especially when he implied cloaking isn't important for sniping."
PS4Planetside2,3e0e2u,diamondwing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:28:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with him. Cloaking makes for lazy snipers. It's fun and easy but you can certainly snipe without it. Keep strafing, reposition constantly, only sit still for the moment you're squeezing the trigger.  I'm a veteran battlefield sniper and I immediately got lazy using the shield."
PS4Planetside2,3e0e2u,RedCairn,0,Tue Jul 21 20:51:46 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. I didn't think about a lot of this because it's a rant.

PS4Planetside2,3e0e2u,Lucky_Number_Sleven,2,Tue Jul 21 15:50:26 2015 UTC,"Logically speaking, should an anti-material rifle capable of destroying vehicles and mech-suits with a few shots also be capable of killing a squishy human with a single shot? Yes. Yes it should. However, we've got spandex-clad worshippers of a disembodied voice shooting lasers at people who are able to be magically reconstructed with ""nanites"" - the same material that also causes your vehicles/guns/ammo/etc. to magically appear - on a distant world with no chance of returning home. Your logic is invalid.  But in all seriousness, we make gameplay concessions all the time to maintain some semblance of balance. The Archer should be for designated anti-material; if it was useful against infantry, there would be no reason to use any other weapon on the Engineer. That said, an anti-MAX sniper rifle is probably good enough for most of you currently fighting off the MAX crashes."

Supported by a following of scientists, doctors, and engineers and gifted with visions from Vanu (an unknown alien lifeform whose species was responsible for the relics), the Vanu cult leapt ahead technologically at a staggering pace. Once the war between the Terran Republic and the New Conglomerate broke out, the Vanu declared its independence and became the Spandex Sovereignty we know and love."

PS4Planetside2,3e0e2u,PantsJihad,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:55:06 2015 UTC,"The only way I could see having a more powerful AMR for engineers is if it was a big break-action single-shot like the bolt driver from Planetside 1. It should have a slow reload and absolutely ass terrible accuracy when moving, with a significant boost for aiming while static and crouched.  Some ammo variety would be cool too. Something like APFSDS rounds with a flatter trajectory that do mildly reduced damage. HEDP ammunition that has a nasty splash to it but reduced damage. The default round should be a simple penetrator shot.  That being said, I'd like it to hit with AUTHORITY so long as what is stated above is the case."

PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,Radar_X,2,Mon Jul 20 17:42:04 2015 UTC,"The higher-ups at DBG (formerly SoE) make a lot of promises that they don't follow through on and generally have a history of lying. You can google SoE lies for more info. The other guy is right, though, I was definitely being over dramatic being all like ""ZOMG WHAT IF THEY DONT EVER ADD THIS GUN ZOMG.""

PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,WeCanNeverBePilots,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:52:47 2015 UTC,I saw new sensitivity settings and a controller scheme that doesn't share reload/eject on a button. Or did you mean something else?
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,dontmineme,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess that's it, I was expecting more somehow.   Did not notice a new sensitivity setting but it seems to be somewhat easier to fly now."
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,WeCanNeverBePilots,5,Mon Jul 20 19:31:22 2015 UTC,Big question for me is did it fix:  1- The super Framerate drop when it's actually a 20+ Vs 20+ fight?  2-The Render issue the game suffers from greatly.

Have to relog. Map, notice someone already said it's still slow UI stuck on screen, parts of the UI overlay and get stuck on screen when viewing loadouts, vehicles, weapons etc. Relog required. Squad chat, pulling up map squad chat stops working, random squad chat failures that require switching to proximity and back."

PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,vampatori,3,Mon Jul 20 18:49:18 2015 UTC,Map still slow to come up. I'm also still getting stuck in the warp menu with no way out under certain circumstances. Just now we were fighting on Amerish and the TR won it. So I hit redeploy and it would not let me warp to Hossin or Indar. Kept saying Warp Failed. No way to back out aside from exiting the game. This happens a lot. The redeployment interface sucks very very badly.
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,trevx,2,Mon Jul 20 14:43:42 2015 UTC,"Well great, they didnt fix my two biggest complaints."

PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,trevx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah the only working way to warp is to spawn somewhere on your current continent then hit your map, zoom all the way out, and warp to the new continent."
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,Kinmar,3,Mon Jul 20 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"Are you supposed to be able to warp from anywhere or only at a warp console? I ask bc the warp button is always there out in the field, but the only time ive ever been able to warp is at a console."
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,awokenthehive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:03:46 2015 UTC,You can warp from anywhere when you redeploy (which kills you). The problem is this doesn't always work. You're better off getting to a warp gate if you can.
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,trevx,0,Mon Jul 20 21:11:29 2015 UTC,"I hate when that happens. It doesn't even take that long to restart the game, it's just so annoying and it happens consistently."
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,Bazz27,3,Mon Jul 20 16:39:53 2015 UTC,US Servers are being locked whilst they iron out the issues.

PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,Venau,4,Mon Jul 20 16:37:27 2015 UTC,"A couple pieces of advice from someone who recently came from Destiny..     There is VERY LITTLE aim assist,  Mess with your controller settings, they weren't very clear at first (at least not to me) on what they controlled. But the two to work with are Infantry Sensitivity (the looking around while not in a vehicle) and the Aimed Sensitivity (aiming your gun). The first will affect the second, but not vice versa   Other than that, have fun exploring all the game has to offer. Its confusing at first but worth the trouble to learn it to really enjoy the game and its objectives."
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,awokenthehive,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:08:12 2015 UTC,"I think any experienced/semi experienced ps4 player should switch aim assist off. If anything it hinders you, especially when trying to aim at a an enemy that is going for you and the aim ""slows down"" on a diferent enemy who is less of a threat, leading you to miss those first couple of shots which would have otherwise hit. Although in some situations it might help you, I feel that if you are used to thumbsticks and first person shooters, it is better to have it off."

PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,quadalot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:34 2015 UTC,I hope they don't change it. For me it's a feature of the game that every faction has a unique color. As TR i can warn others of that blue tank coming down the road or a purple max incoming and they know what's coming there. With the possibility to change the colors that won't be possible anymore.
PS4Planetside2,3dxyz9,ps4hero,2,Mon Jul 20 21:54:07 2015 UTC,why not? you could make the colors whatever you want them to be on the pc version apparently

For example, if you auraxium 5 different carbines, you'll get basically a shiny reskin of the TRAC5/Mercenary/Solstice with an underbarrel shotgun, and built in Advanced Laser Sight/Soft Point Ammo. Stuff other than weapons are a lot harder to get, but it's shiny stuff, so, why not?   The progression system itself is pretty thorough. I doubt you'll run out of stuff to unlock any time soon. I'm well over BR100 on my main and I've still got at least 50k+ certs worth of stuff to unlock."

While none of the factions seem specifically prejudiced or racist, their ruling styles are all terrible.  The TR is like Space America, but an extreme parody version where the Republic is more like the fascist federation from Starship Troopers or the UNSC from Halo.  The NC fight for freedom, but they're clearly a terrorist organization and a bit too radical for me.  Their methods are brutal and as oppressive as the TR.  The Vanu are like the Brotherhood of Steel.  They worship technology, but they are also extremists...brainwashed zealots who by the game's own admission are described as cold, indifferent to suffering and totally dedicated to their alien artifacts and technology.  I think I have to go with the TR and their drab, oppressive Republic, because it may not be fair, and it may be rigged, but at least it's democracy."
PS4Planetside2,3dw8a7,JWAxeMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:18:01 2015 UTC,"The TR of Auraxis is only similar to the TR of Earth in name.

PS4Planetside2,3dyb6d,Lerobinate,5,Mon Jul 20 16:35:54 2015 UTC,I keep my eyes on VS around 50 mins til the alert is over. Those sneaky spandex ninjas seem to push hard around that time.
PS4Planetside2,3dyb6d,drofloh,4,Mon Jul 20 22:58:03 2015 UTC,"Not so much that we are sneaky, but until the alert happens, VS and TR tend to fight eachother fiercely while NC is sniffing glue, as usual. Then the alert pops up, and everyone on NC looks at their map and their lizard brain sees red and immediately believe it is the greater threat because it is red on the map. The attack in droves and all TR outfits HAVE to defend against the flue sniffers. Meanwhile, purple ghost caps everything blue, holding the majority of the continent by the end. See, purple looks less than before than red, and is similar to blue, so the glue-addled brains of the NC never give us a thought.  Lol...the Swarm...they're just that: a Swarm of drones with no capability for rational thought. TR's aggression is certainly a match for VS' tactics, but with the Glue Sniffers, it always ends as a one-sided fight. At least on Genudine."

VS with half the pop of the TR managed to win more alerts then the NC  The TR also won 2 alerts through domination, controlling 85% of the continent and instantly winning  scratch that, TR won 144 alerts, NC 100 and VS 92 ;_; but we have half the population of the other 2 factions, so we are quite good i guess :/"

PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,Ultramarine6,3,Mon Jul 20 13:35:49 2015 UTC,"Cheers, will try it out! Been great fun dropping in 4 infiltrators into a base then getting out!"
PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,EnvenomedKiss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:49:10 2015 UTC,"With squad logistics you don't actually have to land. Fly over the landing pad and drop. Although this loadout is TONS of fun. Pilot needs to be an engineer, 2 rumble seats need to be an engineer, have each rumble seat engi throw ammo packs onto the rumble seat, the other 2 need to be heavies with locking launchers. The 2 rumble engies can repair you midflight. With this set up the valkyrie goes from cert pinata to fearsome engine of destruction. I've taken liberators out mano y mano :p"

PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,NasoLittle,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:26:42 2015 UTC,"I've been using the Valkyrie in my tactics for my outfit. It's not a galaxy, it's not a liberator. I fly low to the ground and hug mountains. Rarely will I openly engage an enemy.  It's faster and more agile than a Galaxy, smaller profile, and it is FASTER. It can also squeeze into small spots, fly under things to avoid flak, and so on.  It doesn't have the firepower of a liberator but again, it is much FASTER and more agile.   It allows me to transport 5 squad members to a location, drop them off, then hide behind a mountain or under a tree. If the enemy has some form of strength you can respond in kind.  If they have sunderers, you drop 5 people with C4 and GG. Also, taking 5 heavy assaults with Lancers on a cliff and letting them kill every single air and ground vehicle within 600m works as well.  Dropping infiltrators off on towers, bases, etc.  Being a spawn point for dead squad members and then being able to deploy them to a location. When a battlefield is constantly changing, it helps.  We use a lot of other tactics but I'm not going to spew them here. Hope you can find a use for the Valkyrie!"
PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,RiffRaffDJ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:01:27 2015 UTC,"Valk's are great....in the hands of an experienced pilot. The other night I was being pursued by three Scythes at once. I managed to evade them and even managed to get one to crash while trying to chase me down. ESF's aren't as agile as a Valk, they are however faster, so you MUST use the Valk's agility to your advantage, otherwise you're a cert pinata. While trying to chase me down and being unable to keep a good line on me, one of the Scythe pilots tried to use his speed to close the distance to me, he didn't make it. Keep close to the ground, use foliage and mountains to your advantage, keep obstacles between you and the enemy. However, terrain is a harsh mistress, one wrong move and you're a grease stain on a rock face, it's not for the feint of heart."
PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,spambot5546,0,Tue Jul 21 04:55:57 2015 UTC,"The thing that it nominally does, being a light transport, it does poorly. The galaxy is better for that.  It can be decent for providing close air support and a spawn point, but the galaxy does that better.  With the default gun and a skilled operator it can tear ESFs up pretty hard, and I'm told the AV weapon can take out MBTs with one magazine. But the liberator is better at both of those roles.  But at least it's not as useless as ESFs!"
PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,Ultramarine6,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:38 2015 UTC,"that was my point, we've already got Liberator and Galaxy pilots and was hoping the Valkyrie could act as a fast moving drop ship but the armor is terrible. I would of preferred no weapons and the ability to boost armor or even stealth like the flash."
PS4Planetside2,3dxzfl,TheRealNattyIce,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:18:29 2015 UTC,The galaxy is also a giant immobile whale of a target that's easy to chase off.  Valkyrie's mobility means it can make passes and mitigate damage.  Stick an engie in the back and you've got free repairs too.

PS4Planetside2,3dvvrr,kezwick,2,Mon Jul 20 07:15:19 2015 UTC,This is sooooooooooooo helpful!   only 1 thing i would like to know - at big bases you have the SCU and Gate diffuser gens but there are sometimes other symbols with sheilds around too (one was 3 lines and cant remeber the other)
PS4Planetside2,3dvvrr,kezwick,2,Mon Jul 20 09:26:42 2015 UTC,"Vertical and Horizontal Shield Generators are the second line of defense on Amp Stations and the first line of defense on Tech Plants. These generators are paired with one another which means you must control both to control the facility. The shields they create also show the generators working in tandem with one another and will even flash one symbol if one of the generators is destroyed. These generators can be found on opposite sides of the two facility types by their two icons on your 3D HUD and minimap. The shields powered by these two generators block all attacking forces from firing through it or moving through it.  Tactically speaking, the generators are extremely important and can sometimes make or break an attack or a defense. In an Amp Station, for example, you cannot even get to the capture point Icon A without taking down both generators. This is very useful for a defending faction as getting a single generator repaired when the assaulting faction isn't looking can allow defenders to rush into the central area from both the SCU room, and from outside and retake the point.  In a Tech Plant, these shields can be used to allow the defending team to place Sunderers within the Tech Plant itself allowing them potentially up to three main spawn points by placing one in the central bay, and in the vehicle bay on top of the spawn in the main spawn room. However, if the attacking faction can use these generators to their benefit it can make the same tactic work to their advantage and make it much harder to retake the control point in the center of the building.  You can use a Gate Shield Diffuser to get pass these shields on a Sunderer or a Harasser.  SCOURCE: PS2 Wiki"
PS4Planetside2,3dvvrr,diamondwing,2,Mon Jul 20 10:21:48 2015 UTC,you good sir are a god!!
PS4Planetside2,3dvvrr,thingeek,2,Mon Jul 20 10:34:17 2015 UTC,"Its probably the shield gens at the larger bases, in particular amp stations and tech plants. At amp stations there are 4 gens, 2 of them control the gates on the outer walls that stop vehicles, and the other 2 control the shields that block the point, which prevent all enemies from entering, including infantry (note: not all amp stations have their point behind these shields, though they all have the shields regardless of point location). in order to remove the shields, you have to destroy both of the generators, which on the minimap have a symbol of 3 parallel lines. on one of the gens the lines are vertical, and the other they are horizontal, hence why they are commonly call horizontal gen and vertical gen.  om not sure what other type of symbol you could be talking about, the main types of generators you really get are SCU's, tank shields and horizontal/vertical gens. there is another type of gen mostly found on hossin that protects point buildings and has a very short detonation time, but I dont remember what its symbol is."

PS4Planetside2,3dvvrr,rolfski,3,Mon Jul 20 09:49:19 2015 UTC,"XM98 ORBIT has the most "" bang for bucks"" though the Parallax VX3 is better at ranges beyond 350 meters and has a higher bullet velocity, which leads to get hits on moving targets easier.  On the pc i used to shoot at moving targets more then i do on the PS4, since it's harder to lead your target on the PS4. With that said, you are probably better off with the XM98 and save your certs for other useful abilities."

PS4Planetside2,3dwpj3,Dark_Jinouga,2,Mon Jul 20 09:46:52 2015 UTC,"I've found that you need to follow a specific formula when paying Spotify music with this game. I personally love playing a Star Wars space battle playlist (named: Imperial TIE Fighter vs X-Wing)  After some trial an error, I've found it best to follow these steps:  Before starting the Planetside App, open Spotify. Choose your playlist and start playing it.  Head back to dashboard. Hold down the Playstation button on the center of the controller and then hit X on the music player to pause the music.  Start up Planetside and go through the process of spawning into the world.  Once you're in, hold down the Playstation button again and hit X on the music player to begin playing the music again, then return to the game.  For me, this works best and I don't have any issues. Trying to load up Spotify while the Planetside app is already open can cause an issue because it forces you to suspend the application, so this work around has been effective for me. Essentially, you want to avoid opening the Spotify  app while the Planetside app is running, so make sure you're happy with the playlist before starting Planetside and just adjust the volume/change tracks/pause the music from the  menu that opens when you hold he Playstation button.  Hope that helps."

If I want to change the song or playlist, I get on the spotify app on my phone, make sure it says it's connected to PS4 (should prompt you to do so, not sure if its based on same network or same account), and you can change it without effecting your Planetside 2 game."

PS4Planetside2,3dvcpl,Ultramarine6,7,Mon Jul 20 21:45:38 2015 UTC,"The better solution is to grab an AP prowler from a different hex and just bring it over. You don't always need to spawn at that same base. Pull back (especially if you're not playing solo) grab armor, a sunderer, or whatever else you want and counter the assault from outside.   TR has a real problem with never being able to break encirclement, and this is one of the easiest ways to do so."
PS4Planetside2,3dvcpl,Terradyne,4,Sun Jul 19 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"Its not just TR. I have yet to see NC make an armored counter attack, but I have seen TR. Every body just wants to stay in the same battle and doesnt think. Hey a two minute drive from a base where the enemy team isnt camping the vehicle spawn with antivehicle weapons might actually be worth it.   Now that I'm getting in with a cohesive squad, that might change though."

La is by far the easiest IMO. for Ha you can hit and hide with launchers, while with la it's easy to get above a max, now if the max is a noobs who can easily be baited into following you, then that kind of max is hardly a threat and would most likely die from normal infantry fire..  But a max defending a spot, or one that doesn't go ""oh look I can kill a guy that shot me and ran off!"" will be more problematic without LA/HA.   Also, big tip, don't leave a dead max until it despawns, medics can revive them.. If I know there is a high possibility of a medic revive I throw another c4 and retreat to a safe spot where I would be able to see the max, if a medic is reviving or has revived I detonate the second c4."
