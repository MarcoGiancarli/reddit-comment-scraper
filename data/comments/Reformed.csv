Reformed,3e3bou,BSMason,2,Tue Jul 21 17:11:14 2015 UTC,"The idea of blessing and judgment being a “worthy receiver” of the Supper comes from the Apostle Paul’s teaching in 1 Corinthians 11:27 where he warned the church in Corinth, “Whoever eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord.” Very clearly, the warning annexed to the words of institution of the Supper necessitates some sort of “fencing of the table.” In vv. 29-30, the Apostle explained that “he who eats and drinks in an unworthy manner eats and drinks judgment to himself, not discerning the Lord’s body. For this reason many are weak and sick among you, and many sleep.”   Why does 1 Cor 11:27 necessitate fencing the table at all? This is something that if done in a manner unworthy, it only hurts the recipient."

How are we to respond? In churches where “fencing the Table” is taken seriously, a disturbing practice has sometimes emerged in this regard–sometimes called “closed communion.” Elders will intentionally pass people by when distributing the elements. If someone has not been examined by the session of that particular church, they are not welcomed to come to the table. It is understandable the an elder pass by someone who is currently under the process of church discipline (see BCO 30-3 for an explanation of this practice), but passing over those visiting is utterly contrary to the idea of the “communion of the saints.” So what are we to do if an unbeliever is visiting and they partake of the Supper? My course of action has been to give the words of institution, the warnings and the invitation, and leave the rest to the responsibility of the hearer. Elders should not consider themselves to have erred if someone partakes unworthily after we do what is required on our part for the preserving and protecting of the sacrament and the people   I agree with this.

Reformed,3dyxen,J0llyRoger,3,Mon Jul 20 21:10:53 2015 UTC,"tl;dr Smith's essay had some good things; however, the essay is ruined by some irrational thoughts and academically dishonest practices.  Long Answer:  Well, it's mostly just three big ones.  First of all, I think slavery, without an adjective, is a good thing. I am a slave to Christ, just as, hopefully, you, robertwilliams, BSMason are slaves to Christ. This is good and supported by Scripture.  Of course, most human-on-human slavery is not so good (especially Euro-Arabic and American style chattel slavery), but to say that Christian orthodoxy and tradition is against all kinds of slavery everywhere anytime without citing at least a theological book if not Scripture for support is the kind of analysis driven by ""culturally driven ideals"" that Dr. Smith complains of. Btw, this is one conclusion I agree fully with Smith, even if I think he retroactively contradicts it in the essay.  Second, I agree that the South seceded because of slavery and that it was one of the primary causes for the Civil War. Yet, the Civil War has seemed to me like God sending a pagan Babylon to deal with apostate Israel. Neither side was truly in the right. The North was certainly not a bastion of Christian orthodoxy and orthopraxy. So Smith ignores the one major complaint many neo-Confederates (like Douglas Wilson or not depending on who you ask about his views), Northern Civil War critics, libertarians, and people like me continue to argue about the War: Lincoln's, the Untied States', and many Northern denominations' actions and words immediately before, during, and immediately after the war are the indirect causes for societal sins and church heresies far, far worse than the practice and defense of chattel slavery. And Smith never addresses this, at all, even when comparing slavery to gay mirage.  Finally,   Why did southern Evangelicals (and Catholics and Christians of all sorts) disregard years of Christian orthodoxy and orthopraxy and embrace pro-slavery ecclesiology and theology? The short answer is that they wished to engage the culture.   This random and unsubstantiated pot shot at any and all Christians who think culture can and should be changed is uncalled for. It's a ""Hitler did it too"" argument. Simply no reason to be in this essay.  Edit: Made this answer less harsh. Just a little.  Edit 2: Cleaned up grammar and spelling"

Reformed,3dyxen,robertwilliams,2,Mon Jul 20 22:27:13 2015 UTC,"I don't know what American slavery was like.  But the form of it that's commonly imagined - cruelty, rape, breaking up of families, etc., - certainly is inconsistent with Christianity.  I don't know how common all that was, and how much was just propaganda.  However, it must be at least possible to have a form of slavery that is consistent with Eph 6:5-9 (and other passages) or else it would not be permitted and regulated in Scripture.  I don't know quite know what that would look like.  I was under the impression that the majority of abolitionists in the US were not what we'd think of as orthodox Christians though, which seems contradictory to the notion that it was gospel faithfulness that led to the abolition of slavery in the US."
Reformed,3dyxen,prolixus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:25:33 2015 UTC,I agree that the tolerance and regulation means that one can't say that all slavery is completely sinful -- otherwise it would be forbidden. Also I know that a lot of abolitionists weren't good Christians or even good people in general.   My view is that it was permitted as a consequence of economic and social realities in a fallen world. Binding oneself to lifetime service to a master is a better outcome than total destitution since the reciprocal duties of the bond require the master to provide for the slave.  But I also think that societies can advance by common grace to a point where that becomes less and less necessary.

When we talk about our inability to seek God, we mean it in a moral sense. There is no physical restraint on us that prevents us from seeking him, but as sin has corrupted us to our core we are unable to have faith without a regeneration from God. Our moral ability has been lost.  I think AW Pink expesses this well here: http://www.the-highway.com/pink_freewill.html. Is that of any help?"

The solution is this: Moral ability is not a prerequisite to accountability. Natural ability is. ""All inability that excuses may be resolved into one thing; namely, want of natural capacity or strength; either capacity of understanding, or external strength"" (p. 150).  But moral inability to do a good thing does not excuse our failure to do it (p. 148). Though we love darkness rather than light and therefore can't (because of moral inability) come to the light, nevertheless we are responsible for not coming, that is, we can be justly punished for not coming. This conforms with an almost universal human judgment, for the stronger a man's desire is to do evil the more unable he is to do good and yet the more wicked he is judged to be by men. If men really believed that moral inability excused a man from guilt, then a man's wickedness would decrease in proportion to the intensity of his love of evil. But this is contrary to the moral sensibilities of almost all men."

Reformed,3e2z3x,krackocloud,5,Tue Jul 21 21:21:19 2015 UTC,"T-- ""Total Depravity"": I reject Total Depravity because I believe it to be unscriptural, after reading Romans 2:13-16; Acts 10:2-4; Acts 10:34-35; Acts 17:27-29.  Acts chapter 10 makes it clear that God favored and listened to Cornelius before he knew about Jesus or believed in Jesus.   Actually, under our theology this makes way more sense, because if he calls upon the Lord and is saved, that means Cornelious was an elect; that's why God heard him.   Paul said in Acts 17 that God is close to all people in all nations and desires people to seek Him.   Yes, the same way He desires that all men keep the law, do they? No.   Romans 2:13-16 shows that unbelievers with good morals will be judged by Jesus based upon how well they obeyed their conscience.   This is a missreading on your part, Paul is agruing that even those that do not have the written law, they have it written in their minds and conscience, hence they are without excuse and they will be judged by Jesus on the final day as unworthy. Unless you are pushing forward the view where we can have access to God w/o Christ.   U-- ""Unconditional Election"": I reject Unconditional Election because I believe it to be unscriptural, after reading John 12:31-32; 1 Timothy 2:4; 2 Peter 3:9. Those Scriptures make it clear that God desires all humans to be saved, and that's why He patiently puts up with sinners.   1 Timothy 2:4: check my response to your second point under the T  2 Peter 3:9: Again, you are missreading:  ""The Lord is not slow about His promise, as some count slowness, but is patient toward YOU, not wishing for any to perish but for all to come to repentance."" NASB  I ask you, to whom is the Lord patient? is it to everyone? or is it to the group of people that Peter is addresing?   In John 12:31-32, Jesus declares that He will draw all the people in the world to Himself.   So, you are a Universalist? And if not, has Jesus failed in His purpose?   L-- ""Limited Atonement"": I reject Limited Atonement because I believe it to be unscriptural, after reading 1 John 2:2; Hebrews 2:9; 1 Timothy 2:6. Those Bible verses say Jesus died for all humans, and the whole world, and every person.   Hebrews 2:9: If you keep reading the passage you'll find quite the opposite of what you are arguing:  ""For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things, and through whom are all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the author of their salvation through sufferings. For both He who sanctifies and those who are sanctified are all from one Father; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brethren"" Heb 2:10-11 NASB  The passage goes on to proclaim that those for whom Jesus tasted death, they will be brought to glory; that is a consistent theme through all Hebrews.   2 Peter 2:1 even declares that Jesus died for those who become false teachers and disown Him!   This is a situation similar to Judas; he was apparently part of the disciples of Jesus, yet he was a son of perdition/destined to perish (John 17:12)  I'll now let our Lord make a POSITIVE case for L  ""Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. You are My friends if you do what I command you."" John 15:13 & 14  Is all the world friends of Jesus? nope, the Bible says they are actually His enemies; He loves them of course, but that doesn't mean he died for everyone of them.  ""I am the good shepherd; the good shepherd lays down His life for the sheep... I am the good shepherd, and I know My own and My own know Me, even as the Father knows Me and I know the Father; and I lay down My life for the sheep. The Jews then gathered around Him, and were saying to Him, “How long will You keep us in suspense? If You are the Christ, tell us plainly.” Jesus answered them, “I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in My Father’s name, these testify of Me. But you do not believe because you are not of My sheep. My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me; and I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish; and no one will snatch them out of My hand. My Father, who has given them to Me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father’s hand. I and the Father are one.”"" John 10:11, 14-15 & 24-30  Here Jesus explicitly says that there's at least one group of people He is NOT dying for, because they are not His sheep.   I-- ""Irresistible Grace"": I reject Irresistible Grace because I believe it to be unscriptural, after reading Acts 7:51; Matthew 23:37; Romans 2:4-5; Ezekiel chapter 18. Those Scriptures show that the Pharisees and Sadducees were resisting The Holy Spirit and that Jesus wanted to save them, but they rejected His salvation. Romans 2:4-5 says God is leading people to repent, but they are stubbornly fighting against it and storing up wrath for themselves.   It nowhere says that He is leading them to repentance, it says that people, witnessing the mercy and kindness of God should lead them to repentance, yet they refuse because ""men loved the darkness rather than the Light, for their deeds were evil."" John 3:19b   Ezekiel 18 has God pleading with sinners, telling them that He hates the thought of punishing sinners, and His strongest desire is for them to repent and be saved. Why can't God fulfill His strongest desire? The answer is free will.   Again, you are pulling the verse out of its context; Yahweh is addressing a particular group of sinners:  ""Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, each according to his conduct,” declares the Lord God. “Repent and turn away from all your transgressions, so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you. 31 Cast away from you all your transgressions which you have committed and make yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! For why will you die, O house of Israel? 32 For I have no pleasure in the death of anyone who dies,” declares the Lord God. “Therefore, repent and live.”"" Ezekiel 18:30-32  However if you fast forward a few chapters you can see this:  “Therefore say to the house of Israel, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “It is not for your sake, O house of Israel, that I am about to act, but for My holy name, which you have profaned among the nations where you went. I will vindicate the holiness of My great name which has been profaned among the nations, which you have profaned in their midst. Then the nations will know that I am the Lord,” declares the Lord God, “when I prove Myself holy among you in their sight. For I will take you from the nations, gather you from all the lands and bring you into your own land. Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean; I will cleanse you from all your filthiness and from all your idols. Moreover, I will give you a new heart and put a new spirit within you; and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. I will put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes, and you will be careful to observe My ordinances. You will live in the land that I gave to your forefathers; so you will be My people, and I will be your God. Moreover, I will save you from all your uncleanness; and I will call for the grain and multiply it, and I will not bring a famine on you."" Ezekiel 36:22-29  And then this:  ""The hand of the Lord was upon me, and He brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me down in the middle of the valley; and it was full of bones. He caused me to pass among them round about, and behold, there were very many on the surface of the valley; and lo, they were very dry. He said to me, “Son of man, can these bones live?” And I answered, “O Lord God, You know.” Again He said to me, “Prophesy over these bones and say to them, ‘O dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.’ Thus says the Lord God to these bones, ‘Behold, I will cause breath to enter you that you may come to life. I will put sinews on you, make flesh grow back on you, cover you with skin and put breath in you that you may come alive; and you will know that I am the Lord.’ ”So I prophesied as I was commanded; and as I prophesied, there was a noise, and behold, a rattling; and the bones came together, bone to its bone. And I looked, and behold, sinews were on them, and flesh grew and skin covered them; but there was no breath in them. Then He said to me, “Prophesy to the breath, prophesy, son of man, and say to the breath, ‘Thus says the Lord God, “Come from the four winds, O breath, and breathe on these slain, that they come to life.” ”So I prophesied as He commanded me, and the breath came into them, and they came to life and stood on their feet, an exceedingly great army."" Ezekiel 37:1-10  Did the Lord God asked the people to know if they wanted a new heart? No, did He asked the dry bones to know if they wanted to be alive? No; seems pretty consistent with our reading of Ephesians 2.  Sorry if I come across as snarky, but many of your arguments have been debunked forever.  Edit: Formatting"

Crown Financial has some cheaper options too.    I cannot recommend it for a few reasons. I discovered that for one, it makes you think of money and wealth a lot. Not bad per say but personally, I found that money became the focus of EVERYTHING (going to go out to eat...wait, that costs money, what would Dave say? Need to buy some new socks...wait, that costs money, I didnt budget for, that will ruin everything...). Second, there are some areas that were not realistic. We have a large family and need at least a minivan to haul them around. Try getting a 1-2000$ reliable minivan (as Dave would want). We spent at least that a year trying to keep one on the road (the year we finally dumped it we shelled out close to 3 grand keeping it going, in the name of FPU). We bit the bullet and FINANCED a car with a warranty. Oh, and the payments cost us less per year than keeping that old van on the road.     Finally, it puts making money above pretty much everything. Dave thinks working three jobs to be debt free for a couple years is better than spending time with your family. We did this for about two years and I about lost my mind. I missed my family, I missed moments that mattered to me, I missed large chunks of them (my kids) growing up. I was an absent father in the name of being debt free.

The basic principles of the course are rather intuitive, but as the one who does the finances I didn't really know where to start (should we save X amount, first?; how much debt should we start with knocking-out?; etc.). This really helped because you realize that it's easier than you think. And when it came to investing I had no idea what a Roth-IRA was, or even how a 401K worked.   Like you said, there's actually a good number in our church that can't handle their finances properly and right now it's a huge speed bump for ministry.

Reformed,3dwkue,DrKC9N,2,Mon Jul 20 13:13:24 2015 UTC,"I think that part of the issue relates to how we use the term ""forgiveness.""  In English, at least, there seems to be one of two meanings.  There's forgivessness, in the sense that we need to forgive our neighbor/brother fully and completely, regardless of the other person's repentance or remorse. [Matthew 18:21-22] with the ""70 times 7"" lesson and the ""Love keeps no record of wrongs"" from [1 Corinthians 13.4]  This is the sort of forgiveness that even non-Christianity-specific morality teaches, right? ""Forgive them before anger and hatred consume you..."" that sort of stuff.  I guess that for the Christian, this sort of love can prompt the Believer to ask God to have mercy on those who have wronged us unfairly?  Then there's the forgiveness that we talk about, mostly in regards to God forgiving sinners. His forgiveness (I suppose it's really closer to ""pardon"") only comes when there is godly sorrow that leads to repentance. I suppose this is more judicial or legal forgiveness.  I think it's important to keep the different nuances in mind (though now that I look at it some, it seems that the two are linked somehow), otherwise we end up with theologically difficult situations like God not being able to ""let go"" of his anger and unforgiveness unless he's appeased in some fashion, when that sort of behavior is described as characteristically unloving for the Christian.  /u/versebot"

Pilate ordered his execution to please the crowds and so he wouldn't be accused of not being a friend of Caesar. The soldiers didn't know or care, they were doing their job.  The question is which ""they"" was he asking for? The Pharisees knew that he did miracles and they attributed them to Satan. Jesus said this was the unpardonable sin so he wasn't asking that they be forgiven, he'd already told them to their face that they couldn't be pardoned (Matt 12).  He was most likely speaking of the rest. The crowd were all worked up by the scribes and Pharisees, Pilate didn't want to have anything to do with it but his hand was forced, and the guards were just doing what they were told. All of those sins could be forgiven."
Reformed,3dwkue,J0llyRoger,2,Mon Jul 20 14:24:23 2015 UTC,"My answer is quite simple, and influenced by preterism : by forgiving the Jewish leaders, God would have forfeited or withheld some of the judgment upon them that was due for killing the Son of God let alone an innocent man, and the events of AD 70 would not have occurred or the emperor Titus would not have thoroughly destroyed Jerusalem as it truly happened.  But because history happened as it really happened, it's safe to assume the late addition to Scripture is a mistake by well-intentioned yet foolish scribes.  Oh, and Jesus said to forgive those who ask for it, not just for anyone willy-nilly. You certainly cannot figure a society that thinks they're right for an innocent's death. (""His blood be on us and on our children!"" Matthew 27:25 ESV)  And this should be a lesson: things that sound and seem Christian (like Christ supposedly forgiving the Jewish leaders on the cross, or various lovey-dovey platitudes and devotions), but contradict even the smallest of Scriptures, is certainly not good Christian theology at all.

Reformed,3dwkue,BSMason,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:54:09 2015 UTC,"I am so very ignorant when it comes to theology, but I would like to propose that ""they know not what they do"" may be referring not to their ignorance of killing an innocent, as you mention, because the law is written on them. And even if they knew, it would be suppressed, as Romans chapter one states:   18For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth. 19For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them. 20For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world,g in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse. 21For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.    So reading this in light of the crucifixion, the suppression of the truth of the onlookers and soldiers can be understood as foolish hearts that had been darkened.  So maybe Christ was referring to something else...this ""doing"" that Christ refers to. I do not want to add to the meaning of what he said, but perhaps he is referring to God's point of view, not the persecutors. Meaning, none could see the spiritual death and forsaken state he was experiencing in becoming sin. They would not have known that they were staring right into the very wrath of God being poured out, blind to the fulfillment of the redemptive plan, cursing him and condemning themselves.  Couldn't we all admit that His words could apply to us too? I do not know the full and eternal destroying power my seemingly ""small"" and ""secret"" sin actually does. The sins of omission especially. The bible teaches that one sin is enough to destroy the universe and send Creation into hell. We would be mortified if we knew how deadly our sin really is, ""big"" or ""small"" you break it all!   As others have mention, he was living out his obedience: to love his enemies, to forgive those who trespassed against him, to utter mercy on them and not unto himself. I see him also setting an example for his disciples and us and for the soldier who would see the truth. Surely, he would know that these words would echo down history to us.   Sorry if it's not answering the question as I am not knowledgeable enough about reformed theology to know how it fits in with depravity, election, and the like. But him dying as our only mediator (1 Timothy 2:5) in his last breaths is a comfort to the saved and a warning to unsaved."
Reformed,3dwkue,BSMason,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:20:46 2015 UTC,"So, I do think they knew they were killing an innocent man. But I don't think they knew that they were killing the Son of God.  That's my take on it, anyway."

He was in the beginning with God. All things were made through him, and without him was not any thing made that was made.""  Col 1:18-17, ""He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation. For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities—all things were created through him and for him. And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.""  So yeah. It's more precise to attribute the title ""Creator"" to the Godhead, and not just to one Person of the Godhead (Father). God creates, not just the Father. Each Person of the Godhead is God, and is thus involved in the work of creation."

And usually, a ""tool"" is something lifeless, without volition, and is just used to create an effect. So the effect created is attributed to the user of the tool (an agent), rather than the tool itself, since the tool cannot will to effect. Rather, Christ is an agent in creation, as he creates by willing with divine power. So, Christ has to be ""creator"" also, as he is the agent of creation. Again, creating is a divine act, so it belongs to the Godhead, and not just one Person."

Reformed,3dsw72,EvilAbed1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:53:03 2015 UTC,"Those missing verses are missing because modern translators use older and more accurate manuscripts than they did in the 1600's.   Older, yes, but what makes them more accurate?   The manuscripts that the modern translations use are mainly based and represented by the Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus, two of great uncial codices, representatives of the Alexandrian text-type, are considered excellent manuscript witnesses of the text of the New Testament. Most critical editions of the Greek New Testament give precedence to these two chief uncial manuscripts, and the majority of translations are based on their text. Nevertheless, there are many differences between these two manuscripts. According to Dean Burgon: ""It is in fact easier to find two consecutive verses in which these two MSS differ the one from the other, than two consecutive verses in which they entirely agree.""  Without counting errors of iotacism, 3,036 textual variations between Sinaiticus and Vaticanus in the text of the Gospels alone. Codex Sinaiticus has been corrected many thousands of times, making it one of the most corrected manuscripts in existence The Sinaiticus is extremely unreliable, proven by examining the manuscript itself. John Burgeon spent years examining every available manuscript of the New Testament. He writes about the Sinaiticus:  ""On many occasions 10, 20, 30, 40 words are dropped through very carelessness. Letters, words or even whole sentences are frequently written twice over, or begun and immediately cancelled; while that gross blunder, whereby a clause is omitted because it happens to end in the same words as the clause preceding, occurs no less than 115 times in the New Testament.""   Although Sinaiticus is old, it has been heavily edited. Kirsopp Lake says there were three groups and even a four groups of correctors that altered the codex. First, there were the ""post Caesarean"" possibly even those ""at the monastery of St. Catherine's on Mt. Sinai."" Second, there were ""the intermediate correctors, of which certainly the earliest, and possibly all belonged to Caesarea. They are probably no earlier than the fifth nor later than the seventh century."" Third, there are the early correctors, all probably ""belonging to the forth and certainly no later than the fifth century."" Finally, the latest correctors altered the manuscript probably in the twelfth century.  Does any of this make you question the claim that they are accurate?  Oh and Erasmus had access to Codex Vaticanus by correspondence with the Vatican library with a friend by the name of Bombasius."

Reformed,3dqvf5,robertwilliams,3,Sat Jul 18 17:16:57 2015 UTC,"Not really a summary but some observations,  and I'm ignoring the 4 sentences rule.  Verses 1-3  The church and the world have been at odds since Genesis 3.  There, God declared war between the Seed of the woman, and the seed of the serpent.  This division is a recurring theme throughout scripture.  Sometimes it's personal, sometimes it's corporate, sometimes it's both.  Often the church is the ""underdog"" in this fight.  Examples:   Cain (older brother) vs. Abel (younger brother) Noah vs everyone else Ishmael (older brother) scoffing at / opposing Isaac Esau vs Jacob Joseph vs his big brothers Israel vs the nations   This separation / distinction continues in the New Testament.   Christ's parable of the wheat and the tares Come out from among them and be separate - 2 Cor 6:17 Friendship with the world is enmity with God - James 4:4 Dragon vs the Woman in Rev 12   Christians should not be surprised when the church is persecuted or when we seem to be losing.  Verse 4  God is both the cause of the separation/persecution, and our deliverer from it.  Verse 5  It is righteous to cry out for God's justice on the wicked.  Verses 6-7  Clearly a picture of the same thing Christ alluded to in the parable of the wheat and tares  Verse 8  We must not in any way teach or imply that God is pleased with the wicked.  It is wrong to pronounce God's blessing on those outside His people, the Church.  EDIT  In the discussion of the separation between the church and the world, I found this bit from the Matrix to be very helpful.   Morpheus: The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it.   [Neo's eyes suddenly wander towards a woman in a red dress]   Morpheus: Were you listening to me, Neo? Or were you looking at the woman in the red dress?   Neo: I was...   Morpheus: [gestures with one hand] Look again.   [the woman in the red dress is now Agent Smith, pointing a gun at Neo's head; Neo ducks]   Morpheus: Freeze it.   [Everybody and everything besides Neo and Morpheus freezes in time]   Neo: This... this isn't the Matrix?   Morpheus: No. It is another training program designed to teach you one thing: if you are not one of us, you are one of them."

Reformed,3dovhd,ovidius007,3,Sat Jul 18 01:16:24 2015 UTC,"I guess I might be a little more 'liberal' than John Piper. If someone asks me to call them 'she' when they are actually a male, and they're not a Christian, I will.  It's not that I don't have a problem with it, but the first foray into speaking about God and his laws seems that it should be to share the gospel.  I would rather get them to recognize that they have sinned in a way that they can agree with then spend time arguing (or rather being shut out more likely).  Piper makes a good point, but I don't really see it as lying to refer to someone as 'she' when they are male or vice versa. Should I?  I don't know - it seems to be that if you want to even engage in conversation with a transgender person, this would be a big deal to them. And if you don't, you won't be able to speak with them at all. At the moment, I see nothing sinful in using their preferred pronoun, but mostly, I would just use their preferred name.  What do you guys think?"
Reformed,3dovhd,terevos2,4,Sat Jul 18 14:11:44 2015 UTC,"I think it's pretty clear — ""You shall not bear false witness against your neighbor."" If a friend, in their rebellion against God, asks us to lie to them, for them, and about them, so that they can feel more comfortable in rebellion, I do not see this as being something that helps our communication of the gospel.  Is referring to a female as a male a lie? Well, if we were asked to testify in a court about their gender, what would we say? Would we hold a higher standard of honesty for a man-made court than we would in everyday life? In his command, God uses the court term, ""bear false witness against"" to apply to our everyday life; so it's applying that highest standard of honesty to everyday life.  The first foray into God's Law is not the Gospel; I believe Scripture shows it is the reverse. We will not accept or feel the need for salvation unless we admit we are living against the law. Christ always presented the Law before he offered salvation from its judgment. Thus, the first foray into the Gospel is God's Law. Certainly, denying that Law by lying to accommodate someone in their rebellion is not a foray into the Gospel.  For someone who has mutilated their body and is living as a perverse mockery of the other sex, referring to them by their true gender may indeed further alienate them from receiving the gospel. But, that process is part of the function of the gospel and God's word. It is a two-edged sword: to some it saves, and to others it brings further judgement. If they harden their hearts like Pharaoh when we like Moses speak God's truth to them, we are no less fulfilling our role in witnessing than we are when saving souls. God has chosen to harden their hearts unto their own destruction.  We may enjoy saving souls more; but ultimately that is up to God. We are called to speak the truth in love."
Reformed,3dovhd,locustsandhoney,8,Sat Jul 18 15:09:59 2015 UTC,"So first, I appreciate your perspective on this. This is important stuff to think about. Let me respond from the other perspective. I don't have strong opinions on this, but I'd like to continue the conversation.   Is referring to a female as a male a lie? Well, if we were asked to testify in a court about their gender, what would we say? Would we hold a higher standard of honesty for a man-made court than we would in everyday life? In his command, God uses the court term, ""bear false witness against"" to apply to our everyday life; so it's applying that highest standard of honesty to everyday life.   Sure. But that's not really the same as saying 'she' when referring to a male. If they asked me to refer to them as female, I would not. The pronoun doesn't communicate quite that level of assertion, though.  If someone asks me (in seriousness) to refer to them as 'human' and never use a pronoun, I'll try to do that.   The first foray into God's Law is not the Gospel; I believe Scripture shows it is the reverse.   Right. But wouldn't you rather start with a sin which they would recognize as sin? Or at least one that they're more likely to recognize as evil/bad?"
Reformed,3dovhd,terevos2,3,Sat Jul 18 15:41:52 2015 UTC,"If I understand you correctly, you're saying you want to divorce gendered pronouns from having any gender meaning so we can use them in this way. The reasoning being, that if we take away or ignore the gendered meaning, then it's not referring to a person by a specific gender, but just by a word they're comfortable with, and not a problem for Christian conscience.  There's two problems with this. First, the ""transsexual"" is not thinking the same way you are. A man asking to be referred to by ""her"" and ""she"" is not divorcing these gendered pronouns from their gender meaning. He is embracing the gendered meaning, the female one, and trying to apply it to himself, and asking you to as well. Should we support him in this?  Secondly, divorcing gendered pronouns from gender is lying. The pronouns are gender indicators by definition. Scripture uses gendered pronouns as indications of gender; it is their very function. But even if Greek and Hebrew didn't function that way, English does.  As a transsexual is very pleased to know, gendered pronouns are indicators of gender, and therefore referring to him as a ""her"" is the same as calling him a woman.   But wouldn't you rather start with a sin which they would recognize as sin? Or at least one that they're more likely to recognize as evil/bad?   I would definitely rather start with an easier issue than this; but if it's presented, we don't really have a choice. I could work alongside a sinner of any kind without saying anything, and there's often nothing wrong with that. But once they turn to me and ask me to support and affirm them in their rebellion, God has placed that before me to witness to, and it's no longer up to me what I'd rather start with.  Jesus confronted people on their sin, often based on their sin that was present in the situation at the time, or based on what sin was most egregious and prominent in their life. Our topic certainly fits both those criteria.  It's really uncomfortable, and it's going to cause problems for us who won't go along with the state's newspeak. Sadly, there's no question the sexual and gender revolution is leading to persecution of Christians who insist on speaking truth."

Reformed,3dovhd,pensivebadger,3,Sat Jul 18 15:59:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not very familiar with this; is that outside the situations he addressed in the article, where he suggested genetic testing (presumably to look for at the XX/XY chromosomes)? Someone with this syndrome would still have biological sex determined by chromosomes, right?"
Reformed,3dovhd,locustsandhoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:07:15 2015 UTC,But is sex determined by chromosomes or by genitalia? I don't think that's something answerable by scripture.
Reformed,3dovhd,terevos2,3,Sat Jul 18 17:20:32 2015 UTC,"I think, as Piper outlined in the article, sex is determined biologically. This is not limited to genitalia, as there are plenty of examples of eunuchs in Scripture which are still identified as male. So the Bible does point to a biological level deeper than genitalia. Obviously it doesn't outline genetics, but our modern scientific understanding is that gender is fundamentally determined by chromosomes. While not specified in Scripture, it is concordant with it."
Reformed,3dovhd,locustsandhoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:16:45 2015 UTC,"gender is fundamentally determined by chromosomes   Well, gender is mostly determined by chromosomes. There are cases where the genitalia is in disagreement with the DNA.  And if someone has male genitalia, would you not consider them male regardless of chromosomes? And if someone has female genitalia, would you not consider them female regardless of DNA?"
Reformed,3dovhd,terevos2,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:16:56 2015 UTC,"What case is there where the genitalia doesn't agree with DNA? There are cases where outward appearances don't match the gender of the chromosomes, but you can't develop sex organs that belong to a chromosome set you don't have.  There are physical disorders though, certainly. But I don't think it's wise to base our view of biological sex on rare biological disorders. In any case, genetic sexual disorders are a result of chromosome disorders, so it really only goes to show that sex is indeed determined by chromosomes."
Reformed,3dovhd,locustsandhoney,0,Sun Jul 19 03:56:14 2015 UTC,"Obviously it doesn't outline genetics, but our modern scientific understanding is that gender is fundamentally determined by chromosomes.   I agree that it covers the vast majority of people but one can be XX and develop as a male or be XY and develop as a female.  In addition one can be XY and develop androgynously, XXY and mostly male with some female characteristics, or a handful of other possibilities where one's chromosomes do not match one's appearance."
Reformed,3dovhd,pensivebadger,0,Sun Jul 19 03:08:38 2015 UTC,This is a picture of people with androgen insensitivity syndrome. They are XY by chromosomes and develop as women without surgery or hormones.   https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c0/Orchids01.JPG
Reformed,3dovhd,pensivebadger,2,Sat Jul 18 17:39:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'd be curious how Piper would counsel them as well. It's quite a different situation than individuals who have a clear biological gender and are trying to change it, so we do have to be careful when people try to conflate them; not to let it confuse the moral issue. In the case of androgen insensitivity, it's obviously a physical disorder and a much more complicated issue.  EDIT: Looking more into the article, with my limited and very possibly incorrect understanding, I'm not sure what you're saying is accurate.  For one, it doesn't say that the people in that photo have XY chromosomes. Women (with XX chromosomes) can have this disorder as well.  I'm also not sure it's accurate to say that people with AIS and male chromosomes ""develop as women,"" as they do not develop female genitalia. They are biological males who have a disorder which prevents normal expression of their masculine genitals, and gives them a feminine appearance, but not female sex organs or other internal developments.  So, those in the photo are not biological males who developed as females, but may be a mix of biological males and females, the males of whom have an external female appearance but not a female sexual system.  Of course, correct me if I've misunderstood the article, again I'm not familiar with this."
Reformed,3dovhd,locustsandhoney,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:28:53 2015 UTC,"For one, it doesn't say that the people in that photo have XY chromosomes. Women (with XX chromosomes) can have this disorder as well.   A person with AIS is far more likely to be XY than XX.  This is because the mutated androgen receptor gene responsible for AIS is on the X chromosome.  In order for an XX child to receive two mutated copies of the AR gene, both parents would have to carry the mutated AR gene which is a much more unlikely event than an XY child which requires only the mother to pass on the mutated AR gene.  This is similar to how colorblindness is far more common in men than women.  However an XX with AIS is even more unlikely than this because it requires a fertile XY AIS parent which is also very rare.  So most if not all of the people in the photo are XY.   I'm also not sure it's accurate to say that people with AIS and male chromosomes ""develop as women,"" as they do not develop female genitalia. They are biological males who have a disorder which prevents normal expression of their masculine genitals, and gives them a feminine appearance, but not female sex organs or other internal developments.   They typically do develop external female genitalia, while testes develop internally instead of ovaries because of the presence of the SRY gene on the Y chromosome.  That's because this process takes place independently of the androgen receptor pathway that controls ones external sexual development (including external genitalia).  Interestingly, XY persons with mutations in the SRY gene usually are externally female in appearance, as well as having externally female genitalia, a uterus and fallopian tubes, though the gonads do not develop into either ovaries or testes.  So that is a completely different genetic condition where XY people present as females."
Reformed,3dovhd,pensivebadger,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:36:58 2015 UTC,"Jesus spoke directly about ""eunuch's who were born that way"" and it wasn't in judgment.

Summary:   First, he explained, ""share the gospel clearly ... and call people to count the cost of following Christ."" Once that is established, ""Tell them following Jesus will cost them their life…and tell them Jesus is worth it!"" Next, the believer can ask the person if he or she has any questions and then ask if the person would like to repent and believe. Then when giving the invitation to call on the Lord and be saved, ""you don't necessarily need to tell them the exact words to say at that point,"" Platt noted. The believer should also be willing to let the person be alone with God, in some cases. Finally, once that person repents and believes in Christ, the one who shared the Gospel should continue to lead that new believer.   In the end, Platt remains cautious of the ""sinner's prayer"" as it can be recited without a full understanding of the Gospel and of the life they're committing themselves to.    I would sooner encourage them to faithfully attend a gospel-preaching church than pray the sinner's prayer. Teach them how to pray, not exactly what to pray.

First, they need to be able to understand Christianity and why the message of Christianity is a desirable alternative to their worldview. Then you can get into the philosophical arguments, where you utterly destroy their worldview. I personally love using arguments from morality. If you get them to contradict themselves enough times, they actually might start to doubt.  The hardest people to witness to are nihilists, though. Because their worldview is actually mostly consistent. But hey, at the very least, you can plant the seeds of the gospel in them. Whether or not they grow is not up to you.  Also, get them to church.

I'd probably prefer to just give them a copy of the ESV, but if need be I'd be happy to give them a ""Roman Catholic Bible"" (I assume by that you mean one with the Apocrypha).  I'd also give it to a believer - very few protestants have read the Apocrypha and they should.  Bear in mind two things:   The Apocrypha has historically been included in printed protestant Bibles as a separate section.  It was in Luther's Bible, the Great Bible, the Geneva Bible, and the King James Version.  It wasn't until the 1800s that protestant Bibles stopped including the Apocrypha. In general, the Reformers approved of reading from the Apocrypha in church, just not of granting it the infallible authority of scripture.   Belgic Confession Chapter 6:   ... The church may certainly read these books and learn from them as far as they agree with the canonical books ...    Second Helvetic Confession 1.9:   Apocrypha. And yet we do not deny that certain books of the Old Testament were by the ancient authors called Apocryphal, and by others Ecclesiastical; to wit, such as they would have to be read in the churches, but not alleged to avouch or confirm the authority of faith by them. As also Augustine, in his De Civitate Dei, book xviii., chapter 28, make mention that “in the books of the Kings, the names and books of certain prophets are reckoned”; but he adds that “they are not in the canon,” and that “those books which we have suffice unto godliness.”"

A bible is a bible, just as preaching the gospel is preaching the gospel. From my husbands NAB Phil 1:15-18, Paul's perspective:  ""Of course, some preach Christ from envy and rivalry, others from good will. The latter act out of love, aware that I am here for the defense of the gospel; the former proclaim Christ out of selfish ambition, not from pure motives, thinking that they will cause me trouble in my imprisonment. *What difference does it make, as long as in every way, whether in pretense or truth, Christ is being proclaimed?

Reformed,3dopp6,VerseBot,2,Sat Jul 18 04:12:04 2015 UTC,"Let me attempt to paraphrase (with the help of /u/versebot):  Christ is the ""messenger of the covenant"" ([Malachi 3:1]) with Abraham (found in [Genesis 17:7]), and not the Covenant of Works, or the “legal administration” (that is, the covenant with Moses), for 3 reasons:  1\ Christ is identified as the “offspring” of Abraham in [Galatians 3:16].  2\ Christ was sent to fulfil God’s covenant with Abraham according to [Luke 1:72-73].  3\ Christ was sent so that the “blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles” ([Galatians 3:14].  This must be so, because the covenant with Abraham (which was reiterated to David – [2 Samuel 23:5]) is “everlasting.” Whereas the legal administration was fulfilled entirely by Christ. (Note, there are occasional temporal/physical additions to the covenant with Abraham, but these do not alter its fundamental eternal/spiritual nature).  Christ was “servant to the circumcised ... in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs” ([Romans 15:8]). This is a specific reference to the covenant with Abraham, in which God promises to be God to Abraham and his seed ([Genesis 17:12]), so that everyone who was descended from Abraham physically, and who “lay hold on” the covenant was confirmed and sealed into it. The people of Israel were not participators in the covenant simply because they were physically descended from Abraham, but because they had been sealed into it by the external sign ([Exodus 24:7-8]). The people, and their children, were bound by this.  The covenant with Abraham therefore extends not to his physical seed, but to his covenanted seed, who stand on the terms of the covenant. One of these terms is that children would have an equal share in the covenant with their parents ([Isaiah 65:23]).   Since the covenant with Abraham was for believers and their children, and since Christ came to extend the covenant with Abraham to the Gentiles, to deny that children have a part in the covenant is to deny Christ’s fidelity in fulfilling His office.  It may be said that while children have a right to the covenant, they should not have the initial seal (baptism) of it. This cannot be, for 3 reasons:  1\ If they are part of the covenant, it is either in grace (election) or administration (the outward sign). If they have grace, then the administration must follow. If they have neither, then they have no interest (part) in the covenant. But they cannot have one without the other.  2\ Whoever has the covenant should also have the administration of it ([Acts 2:38-39]).  3\ The truth of God’s promises cannot be confirmed if the sign is denied, because the reason Abraham (and those after him) could believe that their children were part of the covenant was because their children had been given the sign. If this fact had been taken away by Christ, then Abraham’s faith (in the fact that his children were included in the covenant) would be overthrown, and the promise weakened (in such a way that it only applies to those who have faith and obey, not those who are elect children)."

Including works (by use of ""faithfulness,"" ""obedience,"" etc.) in the very definition of faith. Failing to affirm an infallible perseverance and the indefectibility of grace. Teaching baptismal regeneration. Denying the validity of the concept of the invisible church.

The grace of faith, whereby the elect are enabled to believe to the saving of their souls, is the work of the Spirit of Christ in their hearts, and is ordinarily wrought by the ministry of the Word, by which also, and by the administration of the sacraments, and prayer, it is increased and strengthened.  II. By this faith, a Christian believes to be true whatsoever is revealed in the Word, for the authority of God Himself speaking therein; and acts differently upon that which each particular passage thereof contains; yielding obedience to the commands, trembling at the threatenings, and embracing the promises of God for this life, and that which is to come. But the principal acts of saving faith are accepting, receiving, and resting upon Christ alone for justification, sanctification, and eternal life, by virtue of the covenant of grace.  III. This faith is different in degrees, weak or strong; may often and many ways assailed, and weakened, but gets the victory: growing up in many to the attainment of a full assurance, through Christ, who is both the author and finisher of our faith."

Faith alone is the hand which is given to us by God so that we may receive the offered grace of God. Justification is God's forensic declaration that we are counted as righteous, with our sins forgiven, for the sake of Jesus Christ alone.  We deny that the faith which is the sole instrument of justification can be understood as anything other than the only kind of faith which God gives, which is to say, a living, active, and personally loyal faith.

Reformed,3djb3a,prolixus,2,Fri Jul 17 16:55:12 2015 UTC,Which Presbyterian churches do you know of that baptize the children of non-members? If it's a communicate member's child then the parent/s have been examined by the session to see if they have a credible profession of faith.
Reformed,3djb3a,injoy,2,Fri Jul 17 16:58:24 2015 UTC,"I do mean members, but surely you believe there are tares among the wheat, even in Presbyterian churches?  And surely sometimes it's pretty obvious (but not to the point of church discipline) if you know someone that they basically just show up on Sundays... and show no fruit, no sign of change, just totally ""cultural"" Christians?  Or someone with ongoing sins, which maybe the elders don't know about, or maybe aren't flashy enough that anyone has bothered to follow up with discipline yet?  The communicant member interview can happen in childhood, decades before the infant baptism following.  A ""credible profession of faith"" doesn't mean ""will endure to the end.""  And in Presbyterian churches, you could become a communicant member in a more liberal church and simply transfer membership to a more conservative church, too.  Lots of possibilities for unregenerate parents having their children duly baptized."
Reformed,3djb3a,valdixj,2,Fri Jul 17 17:37:06 2015 UTC,In the circumstances you're describing I wouldn't try to judge someone as a tare just because their outward display of piety is insufficient.  But even assuming you've judged them correctly this isn't a problem because our belief about their children's salvation is derived from the objective aspect of the Covenant. If the parents are objectively covenant members then the children are objectively covenant members and we don't doubt their salvation unless there is cause to believe they're rejecting Christ.
Reformed,3djb3a,SortaFlyForAWhiteGuy,2,Fri Jul 17 17:44:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm not saying we can renounce someone as de facto a non-believer without sending them through the entire church discipline process.  But there are surely times when we know someone much more than the elders do, for various reasons, and have never ever seen any evidence that they are Christians, evidence which the NT tells us should be plainly evident.  I'm not talking about an outward display of piety, I'm talking about forsaking sin, being kind, the fruit of the Spirit, etc.  Actual holiness.  Not a display.  (Now, should we have initiated church discipline because someone never showed any sign of love for Christ or evidence of the Spirit? That's a good question, but beside the point, when the person is already standing in front of the congregation going through the baptismal ritual.)   our belief about their children's salvation is derived from the objective aspect of the Covenant   But the WCF says it only applies to the children of believers, not the children of those who were once baptized or who go to church.  It also says the assurance only applies to godly parents, not churchgoers."
Reformed,3djb3a,valdixj,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:51:35 2015 UTC,"I'd say it is 100% equivalent to how Baptists give baptism, what they require, and with the same level of certainty. In this case it is just given to them and their children."

I heard a pastor actually pray for the soul of the departed that God would have mercy on it.

Christ fulfilled the ceremonial law.  However, we are commanded in the NT to sing ""psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, making melody in your heart.""  Therefore, we have both a warrant and a mandate to continue singing psalms.  (There's some question as to whether ""hymns"" and ""spiritual songs"" are different from psalms.)  There is no such command to continue using instruments, incense, and so forth, so they are forbidden.

He talks often about the anabaptists and how we should kill all of them or something. I identify as a credobaptist, but I am trying to figure out if my beliefs fall in line with what they believed then and what someone who's considered anabaptist now believes"
Reformed,3di6fs,superlewis,6,Thu Jul 16 15:42:34 2015 UTC,"Anabaptist at the time of Calvin would have had a wide variety of applications. There were crazy anabaptists who would be more like a cult today. There were also some that were more inline with where a modern Baptist would be.  Modern Baptists have their roots in English separatism (John Smyth and Thomas Helwys would be the earliest modern Baptist theologians). However, there were certainly Anabaptist influences on them. The amount of influence is a matter of controversy in Baptist history discussions.  Modern Anabaptists follow a different lineage. It's kind of like the two paths diverged in the early 1600s. Today there are theological differences and similarities. Amish theology teters on the edge of works-based salvation although an Amish person would disagree with that characterization. Mennonites have a wide variety of practices. Some would be like the Amish while others would fit close to mainstream evangelicalism. Neither would be considered Reformed.

Reformed,3di6fs,Dying_Daily,2,Thu Jul 16 16:13:24 2015 UTC,"Anabaptists are generally not Calvinists or Reformed and often don't consider themselves part of Protestantism (though they reject the RCC). They do however affirm the gospel and historically have a high view of Scripture. They come from the lines of the Mennonites, Amish, Nazarene, Church of God/Christ, and others.

Reformed,3di6fs,hinnomaki,3,Thu Jul 16 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"On the surface, and strictly going by the definitions ( google, wikipedia, etc. ), they seem very similar to me as to ""delaying baptism until the candidate confesses his or her faith"".  But, if I had to come up with something, I would say Credobaptists might be more inclined to baptize someone who ascents to a belief, whereas a Anabaptist might be inclined to baptize someone who, along with ascent, practices and lives out that belief."
Reformed,3di6fs,Dying_Daily,2,Thu Jul 16 14:03:26 2015 UTC,"Credobaptist and anabaptist are very general terms. Credobaptist technically refers to the baptizing of believers only, so all anabaptists are credobaptist. You need to be more specific with your question."

Reformed,3di6fs,robertwilliams,2,Thu Jul 16 16:06:44 2015 UTC,"The ""ana"" means baptized again after infant baptism, not rebaptizing multiple times, just to clarify.  They rejected the title.  Originally there were Calvinist anabaptists, but as far as I know all the modern groups still using the title are Arminian, but believing the same basic things about baptism that we do as far as I've seen (e.g. symbolic, etc).  (We use Conservative Mennonite curriculum for homeschooling in early elementary so I've been pretty inundated with their theology to see what to be on guard against teaching, and read heaps of their Anabaptist history books, e.g. Martyrs Mirror, etc.)  That said, there were a lot of heretics who had the label ""anabaptist"" very carelessly applied to them, a lot of lies tossed in the anabaptist direction by the ""church"" authorities, and of course the lack of central anabaptist authority meant there were heretics genuinely under the label like the Münster Rebellion.  There were accusations that some anabaptists kept on re-baptizing, but I'm not aware of any groups that actually were, and the confessions speak of baptism as a one-time event after reaching an age of awareness."

Reformed,3di6fs,BSMason,0,Thu Jul 16 17:00:41 2015 UTC,"A credobaptist doesn't 'rebaptize' anyone. That which people call 'baptism' which are considered illegitimate by credobaptists are not called 'baptism'.   That certainly includes infant baptism, but can possibly include Catholic baptism or other churches that are not considered legitimate churches.  An anabaptist is one who rebaptizes. Maybe you were baptized legitimately in some other church, but you might need to be baptized again if you join their church. Typically anabaptists are looking for some serious evidence of being born again before they will baptize.  But there's a whole range from one extreme to the other with no clear line in the middle between the two groups.  EDIT: On second though, I know nothing about anabaptists. Talk to /u/Dying_Daily about it."

Complaining undermines our witness.  I think the whole thing revolves around how you answer this question: Is God fundamentally good to me during this time of suffering?

Someone was sharing their struggles in raising this child, seeking advice, wisdom, counsel, etc. and you simply said (  to paraphrase ) ""stop yer whining and get on with it"" and tacked on a verse.  ""Do all things without grumbling or questioning"", ""Do all things without grumbling or disputing"", ""Do all things without murmurings and disputings"".   Murmurings, grumbling; as in an internal ( to self ) or within a small group of individuals, secretly debating why this and so is occurring. Questioning, disputing; again, the inward or vain reasoning reflecting a troubled doubting heart, possibly directed towards one another.   I take the verse to be more inward directed; inward to the individual and inward towards the goings on of the church because I think this has a more ""church"" directed focus than a ""oh, woe is me"" focus, so I don't think you are applying the verse correctly.  The verse after the one you mentioned says ""that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.""

You disregarded OP's obvious pain   I wasn't talking to the OP, I was replying to reformedscot.   and u/reformedscot's encouragement   I literally said, ""Great reply""   Your continued defensiveness seems to indicate a lack of humility and teachability.   Show me where I implied all these things you said that I did. This is why I'm asking the question in the first place. I don't know why people took my comment the way that they did.  My first thought was that /r/reformed thought that complaining was somehow ok, hence this post.  But then I have come to understand that at least some people thought I was replying to the OP and saying that she was complaining. When I asked people to re-read the thread, they do see that I was not doing that.  So now there are others, such as you, who after that clarity, still think it was wrong of me to reply.  To follow up, why do you believe it is wrong to offer correction to someone who offers good advice but also encourages someone to sin in their otherwise excellent advice?"
Reformed,3dhx7e,AClegg1,6,Thu Jul 16 15:36:00 2015 UTC,"OP: This post is partly just me whining.   reformedscot: Whine away - it's cathartic.   You: Do all things without grumbling   You were (wrongly) ""correcting"" reformedscot for approving of OP's behavior.  Which necessarily means you were correcting OP's behavior.  And everybody knows it.  You're just adamant to justify yourself.  It's the same attitude that you manifest when you blame people for their own mental illness."

Now I understand why people thought I was addressing the OP. Thank you.   It's the same attitude that you manifest when you blame people for their own mental illness.   Yes, I'm well aware that you think there's no place for the church to care for the depressed. And trying to help people who are depressed means that you're 'blaming them'.

Reformed,3dgu3c,terevos2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:40:34 2015 UTC,"From Thomas Vincent's commentary on the Westminster Shorter Catechism...  Q. 4. What is it to enjoy God?  A. To enjoy God, is to acquiesce or rest in God as the chief good, with complacency and delight. ""Return unto thy rest, O my soul."" --Psalm 116:7.  Q. 5. How is God enjoyed here?   God is enjoyed here, when people do settle themselves upon and cleave to the Lord by faith. ""But cleave unto the Lord your God."" --Joshua 23:8. When they taste the Lord's goodness, and delight themselves in the gracious presence and sensible manifestations of God's special love unto them. ""O taste and see that the Lord is good."" --Psalm 34:8. ""Because the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost."" --Romans 5:5.   Q. 6. How will God be enjoyed by his people hereafter?  A. God will be enjoyed hereafter by his people, when they shall be admitted into his glorious presence, have an immediate sight of his face, and full sense of his love in heaven, and there fully and eternally acquiesce and rest in him with perfect and inconceivable delight and joy. ""Now we see through a glass darkly, but then face to face."" --1Corinthians 13:12. ""There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God."" --Hebrews 4:9. ""In thy presence there is fulness of joy, at thy right hand are pleasures for evermore."" --Psalm 16:11.  Q. 7. Why is the glorifying of God and the enjoyment of God joined together as one chief end of man?  Because God hath inseparably joined them together, so that men cannot truly design and seek the one without the other. They who enjoy God most in his house on earth, do most glorify and enjoy him. ""Blessed are they that dwell in thy house; they will be still praising thee."" --Psalm 84:4. And when God shall be most fully enjoyed by the saints in heaven, he will be most highly glorified. ""He shall come to be glorified in his saints."" --2Thessalonians 1:10.  Q. 8. Why ought men chiefly to design the glorifying of God in all their actions?   Because God hath made them, and made them  <16>  for this end, and given them a soul capable of doing it beyond irrational creatures. ""Know ye that the Lord he is God; it is he that made us, and not we ourselves."" --Psalm 100:3. ""The Lord made all things for himself."" --Proverbs 16:4. ""Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name."" --Psalm 103:1. Because God doth preserve them, and makes provision for them, that they might glorify him. ""O bless our God, O ye people, which holdeth our soul in life."" --Psalm 66:8-9. ""O Come, let us worship before the Lord, for we are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his hand."" --Psalm 95:6-7. Because God hath redeemed them, and bought them with the price of his Son's blood, that they may glorify him. ""Ye are not your own; for ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God's."" --1Corinthians 6:19-20. Because he hath given them his Word to direct, his Spirit to assist, and promiseth his kingdom to encourage them to glorify him. ""He showeth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and judgments unto Israel. He hath not dealt so with any nation. Praise ye the Lord."" --Psalm 147:19-20. ""Likewise the Spirit helpeth our infirmities."" --Romans 8:26. ""Heirs of the kingdom which he hath promised to them that love him.""--James 2:5.   Q. 9. Why ought men chiefly to desire and seek the enjoyment of God for ever?   Because God is the chief good, and in the enjoyment of God doth consist man's chiefest happiness. ""There is none good but one, that is God."" --Matthew 19:17. ""There be many that say, Who will show us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us. Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that their corn and their wine increased."" --Psalm 4:6-7. Because God is but imperfectly and inconstantly enjoyed here, and men cannot be perfectly happy until they come to the eternal enjoyment of God in heaven."" We know in part; but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away."" --I Corinthians 13:9-10. ""Not as though I had already attained, either were already perfect; but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that  <17>  for which also I am apprehended."" --Philippians 3:12. ""In thy presence there is fulness of joy."" --Psalm 16:11.   Edit: Formatting"

Reformed,3dee9f,Trashosaurus,17,Wed Jul 15 16:53:54 2015 UTC,"I work in the medical field - specifically in the area of developmental disabilities. I have people on my case load from the ""mild"" young man with ADHD and fetal alcohol syndrome - through to some of my medically challenging cases  that need a 24 hour nursing facility to survive day to day.  Through all this, my perspective would be to give you hope. Hope that a covenant God keeps his promises and children are part of that covenant promise. Hope that He is a merciful God and delights to save - especially those that are weak. He loves to show strength in weakness, and bring glory by doing the impossible.  Your daughter will have a harder row to plough than many of us. But people will be there to support you and her as this thing goes on. Making and keeping friends will be harder for you and her, but that doesn't mean it can't ever happen. People also say dumb stuff. Even people who work in this field say dumb things to me on occasion. It's fear and ignorance and unfamiliarity - but if you are patient, forgiving, and big hearted (As your child will undoubtedly teach you to be) you can overcome these things and have meaningful relationships that support you and her.  You will need to help people with realizing that this is not something that will be 'fixed' and not something to be afraid of. A big part of her future successes will be how you view her future. Is that person really being 'cruel' even if unintentional? Or are they just out of their element and seeing something they don't yet have the framework to deal with? Should you avoid the Mommy groups or just show up and help the other women love you and your daughter. It's not binary - it's a process that you all will need to grow through.  I know my state has lots of help and opportunities for people with disabilities. I would encourage you to plug yourself into these as much as possible. Not all are Christian, but you can see your evangelism blossom there, with Moms and Dads who can be discouraged like you. You will understand their struggles in a way far more meaningfully that any one else and can sow hope into their lives.   To be honest, you'll invite people into your life who will react negatively. Some will not cope with the situation and be distant and removed. Some will get it straight away and become friends and allies. Some will be like the first group to begin with, but will grow into the second. Take risks and chances and they will pay off. Not with everyone and not every time - but you'll know that the friends who are happy to come to dinner in the midst of your chaos are true friends.  Whine away - it's cathartic. But realize that there is hope for you and your daughter to know joy, friends, success, and Jesus - even if it doesn't always look the same way as other people's knowing these things.   Isn't there a /r/reformedwomen sub? I'd encourage you to drop in there and start sharing (I'm assuming you're female from your 'other ladies' remark - forgive me if I'm missing something...)  I don't know what I can do, but if you want to PM me with your state, I'll see what resources I can scare up that might be useful for you."

Reformed,3dee9f,terevos2,8,Thu Jul 16 12:05:53 2015 UTC,"Man, this is another tough one. I cannot express care for you and your family over the internet that I wish I could. And what I will say is going to fall short of what you need to hear, but here goes.   What could our daughter possibly learn about the Savior when she is intellectually an infant? And will likely remain so? How are we supposed to ""train up a child"" who cannot progress past a certain point emotionally, spiritually, physically etc.   That part is admittedly very difficult. But it's really no more complicated than with a 'normal' child. Teach her as best as you can. Pray for her. But at the end of the day, her salvation is 100% dependent on God, the same as any child.  I believe that severely disabled children can have faith. You might not be able to observe it though. But whether the child can have faith or not again doesn't matter so much as whether God has elected her. You face a similar dilemma as those who have lost a child in infancy - like King David, I believe God is merciful and you will some day join together in Heaven. And she will thank you for your care for her when she was disabled before the resurrection.   What does it mean to teach a developmentally disabled child about Jesus?   Tell her the gospel story. Tell it to her over and over. Tell it to her simply. Tell it to her in more depth. Pray with her (not just for her). She needs to be taught about Jesus just as any abled child does. Don't neglect this teaching just because she cannot respond.   Any thoughts on this are appreciated. My church is extremely young, so this is new territory for all the leaders we encounter, and they never really know what to say when we ask them questions like these.   Your leaders might not know answers. But they care for you. Keep talking with them about these things. Ask them to get counsel from other bigger churches in the area and from CCEF and/or get counseling from CCEF yourself.  Do you lack faith? Maybe. But ask them to pray for healing if they have faith.  Lastly, we've found it incredibly helpful to write down the issues. Explain the situation as best you can in written form, but succinctly. Then ask the people you interact with to read it over and to ask questions."
Reformed,3dee9f,terevos2,9,Wed Jul 15 18:01:27 2015 UTC,"Thankfully (so thankfully!) God's grace to us is not on the basis of how fully we understand him.  I wont pretend to understand your struggles, but I will say that we have several children in our congregation with various mental ailments (autism, Down's, etc), and through conversations with those parents, what seems to be important to me is (besides prayer for healing) to pray for strength for you and her to ""give thanks in all things"" and to grant wisdom to all involved.  Personally I feel like experiencing Jesus through worship is a very important part of our learning about him, and thats not something thats restricted to our ability to cognitively perceive it.  One theologian friend of mine has a wife who struggles with advanced cancer. It's difficult to deal with, but he often has said ""Perhaps God granted this burden to her, so that someone else won't have to bear it."" That's not something we can be systematic about or even prove, but we are called to bear the burdens of the world, and it may be that the way you proceed through this heavy burden will give hope and inspiration to others.  I hope this helps. I will be praying for your family."
Reformed,3dee9f,srm038,3,Wed Jul 15 17:52:03 2015 UTC,"I am so sorry to read this.  I don't know what to tell you.  RC Sproul Jr. had a severely disabled daughter, who has since passed away, and he wrote and talked about her quite a bit.  You may find him helpful.  Here's one article:  http://rcsprouljr.com/blog/the-kingdom-notes/unbearable-lightness-shannon/   What could our daughter possibly learn about the Savior when she is intellectually an infant?   The promises are to you and your children.  He will be a God to you and your descendants.  Believe it.  Our Savior was adamant that the little children could come to Him.  He would not break a bruised reed or snuff out a smoldering wick.  Why would you fear that He would turn away your daughter?  Tell her the story of Jesus.  Sing the songs of the faith with her.  Pray with her.  Do what you can, and trust our Lord.   Her behavior is also distracting, upsetting and generally difficult for others to understand.   Then this is an opportunity for your church to grow in grace and love.  If they don't love the least of these brothers and sisters of Jesus, well, you know the rest.   The world is an extremely scary place for my daughter, and everything can set her into a fit of panic.   It seems to me that you should bear with her weaknesses here.  Don't feel like you need to go do the normal 21st century Christian stuff like have Bible studies at coffee shops.  What does the Bible command you to do?   Love your husband Love your children and teach them about Him Manage your family Do good to others as you have opportunity Don't forsake corporate worship   That's just about it.  Don't feel guilty because you can't do the churchy stuff.  In fact, it seems to me that it would be very important for you to scale way back on your family's activities so that you have some time for yourself, and time for you and your husband to be together.   Am I faithless because I don't expect her to be healed? I've been accused of that also.   I would say what I think about those accusers, but I don't use that sort of language."

I am so sorry you are going through this and that your church is making it harder, however unintentionally.   What does it mean to teach a developmentally disabled child about Jesus?   I think they can love Jesus in as much capacity as God gives them, and what that looks like varies intensely, but is underscored by the immense grace of God.  Thankfully we aren't saved by our ability to understand theological concepts, but by God's ability to change our hearts!  Praying for your little girl, that even in all her inability, she would have a tender heart.  God called John while he was yet an infant in utero; even then, the Spirit can move."

Reformed,3dee9f,moby__dick,2,Wed Jul 15 18:51:34 2015 UTC,"I am only 25 and have no children of my own so I can't begin to put myself in your position.  I can't imagine what it must be like to have to raise a child and see that they aren't going to grow up ""normally"".  What I can tell you though is that when I was born my parents already had a child, eleven years my elder, a daughter who was born with severe mentally disabilities and a condition generally referred to as a brain injury.  From my perspective there was nothing more ""normal"" than having a sister who had trouble walking, was difficult to understand when she talked and often made lots of loud interrupting noises in public and in church.   Your concern that struck me the most was that of training up your child in faith.  My father, a pastor, and my mother are my greatest roles models and biggest heroes beyond any shadow of a doubt.  For 25 years I've watched them raise a girl, who suffers from much of what you've described, with unshakable faith in God to be her savior.  I don't remember one night they didn't say prayers with her before she went to bed. Within her ability they helped her to learn and memorize questions and answers from the Westminster children's catechism.  They read from the Bible to her and me.  In church every week when my dad was up front preaching and my mom was playing the piano, my grandparents and I would help her find the hymns in the hymnal to look at and read as she couldn't sing.  Often times we would have to take her out to the foyer if she would make too much noise and be disturbing to the worship service.  My sister needed to be treated like a child when I was growing up and still needs that same treatment today.  But what my parents showed me is that they will always treat her as a child of God and a blessing from God.  They continue to do their best to train her in the Christian faith as much as it is her ability to absorb (and oftentimes we are unaware of how much she really may understand).  And they trust Jesus as the one who saves to be able to save anyone regardless of our perception of cognitive affirmation of faith.  We don't need to worry about doing the work of saving my sister because God is the one who saves, and his elect were written down before the beginning of time.  What we can do is be faithful to a faithful God and teach and pray for those like my sister and your daughter who are burdened by the effects of a sinful world.  Our congregation and our community accepted my sister because my parents didn't try to hide the fact of who she was.  She wasn't kept at home, barred from church, but was brought faithfully each and every Sunday morning.  I know it was difficult for others to accept who she was and understand her, but over the years people realized that she was just as much a part of God's kingdom as they were.  People are apprehensive about what's different, that's just a reality of life.  But true Christians will seek to treat and understand those who are different and accept them.  I know that in our church dozens upon dozens of people over the years have grown in patience, kindness, gentleness and other fruits of the spirit because of interaction with my sister that would not have occurred in the same way without her.  God can and does use everyone in mysterious and magnificent ways.  One of my greatest sources of joy on this earth is the thought of my sister's future glory and perfection in heaven in light of what she must deal with on this earth.  I trust God for her salvation because of the way my family has raised and taught her.  I pray God's blessing on you and your family for the strength to do the same for your daughter who is a mighty gift from our great Father."

Almost every Lord's Day I am blessed by one particular sight.  The pastor's wife has an infant, and she's often busy walking with the baby to keep him quiet.  They also have a daughter - maybe 4.  The daughter sits with an older couple who look after her during worship.  They aren't her flesh-and-blood family, but she loves them and they love her.  The man is a stodgy Dutch Reformed wear-a-suit-to-church sort of guy.  And after service while we're breaking down (we meet in a school) he sets up little plastic bowling pins so he and this little girl can play.  This is one reason I'm so opposed to the practice of separating the congregation during worship - nurseries, children's church, youth services, etc.  Because we are a family and we belong together."

Sovereign Grace does not vest any authority whatsoever when it comes to nominating elders, with the congregation, but rather allows them to ""give input"" which can then be completely disregarded without any explanation from the elders. It is therefore a misuse of the term presbyterian to apply it to SGM. I believe their model is closer to episcopalian polity. I realize that you disagree with me there, but I would suggest that you at least qualify the term. There should be no shame in describing the polity accurately if it is founded on a biblical conviction.  2) It's a disingenuous, uncharitable, and unnecessary speculation. You would know as well as anyone that it is unwise to do things in haste and many, if not all, of those churches were waiting to see how things shook out before making any rash decisions. As things, which included much more that the book of church order, developed, it became increasingly clear that many churches could no longer associate with SGM in good conscience. There are many many close relationships between the various churches of SGM and that is one of it's strengths. It seems almost bitter to question the integrity of those who left because of the slowness with which they came to an extremely difficult decision. Surely if they had done so quicker, they would be open to the charge of making a hasty, rash, thoughtless, and wreckless decision. But such is often the way criticism goes from those who don't seek to understand their opponents (""John came neither eating nor drinking"" and all that).  It's also worth pointing out that many of the churches that left, most notably Covenant Life, left the episcopalian leaning polity of SGM by way of congregational vote (in CLC's case with over 90% in favor) rather than by the decision of their supposed celebrity pastors.  Finally, I'm still curious to know who you think the celebrity pastors are that left? Other than Harris, who has since stepped down to pursue seminary (strange thing to do for someone who relishes the limelight), and maybe Altrogge, who are the celebrities among the 40+ churches that left?"

Reformed,3dh5pv,soladeogloria,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:11:59 2015 UTC,"1) Care to articulate how you define presbyterian polity? I'm guessing it's simply A) a hierarchical structure of authority starting with the elders of the local church and B) a plurality of people at each level.   A quick Google search should show you that the general understanding of the term consists of more than that.  From Wikipedia on church polity   The minister of the church (sometimes referred to as a teaching elder) is a member of and presides over the session; lay representatives (ruling elders or, informally, just elders) are elected by the congregation.   From Wikipedia on presbyterian polity   In contrast to the other two forms, authority in the presbyterian polity flows both from the top down (as higher assemblies exercise limited but important authority over individual congregations, e.g., only the presbytery can ordain ministers, install pastors, and start up, close, and approve relocating a congregation) and from the bottom up (e.g., the moderator and officers are not appointed from above but are rather elected by and from among the members of the assembly).    From Theopedia on church government   ...elders are typically elected by the congregation on a periodic basis (usually a term lasts about 3 years). Sometimes elders are elected by the drawing of lots.   Even Yahoo Answers acknowledge congregational nomination   ...the general rule is that they appoint deacons, and ordain two forms of elders, the ""ruling elders"" which are otherwise laypersons that are elected from a church congregation to represent them, and the ""teaching elders"" which are the clergy of the denomination and serve as pastors, chaplains, etc. Presbyterians elect their own members to speak for them to the denomination on an increasing scale.   To say that SGM is presbyterian is a hijacking of the term, similar to how Mormons call themselves Christians. It's not the same and it'd be helpful for everyone to just knock it off.  2)   Leaving because of Presbyterian polity is not a sin, nor do I mean to portray it as such.   That's just it though, if you really think that's the reason so many have left, I don't think you've bothered to listen. But then in elder-rule (not just ""led"") episcopalian polity, there's no reason to give ear to the unwashed masses."
Reformed,3dh5pv,terevos2,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:48:38 2015 UTC,"1) I don't disagree with your definition.  2)   That's just it though, if you really think that's the reason so many have left, I don't think you've bothered to listen.    That's just it. All of the churches that have left stated differences in polity as the reason given, but haven't really spelled it out, unfortunately. Not that they're required to. But I'd love to listen to their reasons. I'd love to learn what the real and detailed reasons are, but they haven't shared them (at least not with us regular old pastors).  And never did any of them suggest any issues with Presbyterian polity or elder-ruled churches. Only CLC adopted congregationalism as far as I'm aware."

Reformed,3dfiuo,jerijtanner,0,Thu Jul 16 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"Everyone who agrees with the RPW would agree that temple worship and new testament worship are fundamentally different.   Those who would argue that instruments are not allowed in new testament worship would argue like so-     The old testament identifies musical instruments as an ordinance/ institution of God. This being so, God is clearly regulating there use within old testament worship. Where in the new testament has God relinquished their regulation in worship? He doesn't so God logically still regulates instruments in worship within the NT. The command (not allowance) to use instruments in Worship within Old Testament, being a command of God, must either be moral or ceremonial. The exclusion of a command in the new testament to use instruments within worship is significant do the the use of instruments being severely limited within old testament worship (Instruments were only played by levites, in the temple, during animal sacrifices).    Many of these are analogous to psalm singing, however due to the command to sing psalms in the NT, their use is expanded to all areas of the church. Thus Psalms are moral rather than ceremonial. The Psalms had been restricted under the Old Covenant to only levites under ceremonial law, that law has been stripped away, but the Psalms continue in their morality. Because the command is repeated singing the Psalms is not shown to be limited to being ceremonial law, but instead moral law.   Because their is no new testament command freeing the use of instruments from moral law, they have not been expanded to the members of the church. No NT command frees it from ceremonial law, thus it perished with the previous dispensation."

Granted, he was a prophet, and that's what prophets do. They preach repentance unto forgiveness. The article says ""without crossing over into a role to which we were never called"" but that is exactly what John did, no? When he said in Matthew 14 verse 4 ""for John had been saying to him: “It is not lawful for you to have her.” Herod was guilty of breaking at least two of the commandments and John called him out for it.  I take a bit of issue with the article...they seem to be painting the picture of 'gentle Jesus, meek and mild' as if Christianity doesn't have any teeth to it.  The article says ""We were never commissioned to demand that secular culture reflect biblical principles."" Well, yes, I can't expect my unchristian neighbor to act or obey Christian principals...even though many western cultures did this for centuries. But as a Christian, I am to seek out my neighbor's good and that may require me extending the reach of my beliefs into the earthly kingdom. Pushing for legislation, laws, that are for the overall benefit of my neighbor. Which, I believe at the end of the article, they are asking for in ""seeking justice"".  And I think the early Christian church had this sort of impact with regards to the role of women and children. We don't simply show the world ""see we treat our womenfolk and children better than you heathens"" and say you continue to do as you please. Rather we seek the good of my neighbor and if some law, or ruling, is contrary to Scripture ( which would always prove detrimental to my neighbor ) then we should be against it. Or promote laws and legislation that are for the common good.  All of the five bullet points are certainly true. Jesus ate with sinners, he met them where they were, he slowed down, but he kept moving, yes yes, all true. But those truths don't negate the fact that he told his disciples to shake the dust off their sandals of those that wouldn't receive them as a testimony against them .

The state cannot grant a biblical divorce to me or my wife.   It can grant something it calls a 'divorce', but that's not necessarily legitimate in the eyes of God. When the state grants a divorce without meeting the biblical criteria for it, then the marriage contract is still legit even if the state does not recognize it.

Reformed,3de24t,robertwilliams,8,Wed Jul 15 21:07:08 2015 UTC,"That's so frustrating.  I'm not frustrated at you, but at the awful theology which is destroying you.  The guy in the video you linked to is wrong.  You deny the faith by... denying the faith.  That's what Hebrews is talking about.  You don't deny the faith through your actions, unless your actions are to literally refuse to believe the gospel, and to literally renounce Christ.  Look, let's just consider Hebrews 10 for a second.  Let's just read it.  I've added emphasis here and there.   12 But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God, 13 waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet. 14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.  15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,  16 “This is the covenant that I will make with them     after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts,     and write them on their minds,” 17 then he adds,  “I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more.” 18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.   These are not rhetorical questions.  Answer them.   Has Christ, or has Christ not, been made a single sacrifice for your sins? When Christ died, how many of your sins were in the future? Has God actually promised to remember your sins and lawless deeds no more? Do you believe God, or are you calling Him a liar?   Let's keep going.   19 Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus, 20 by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, 21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God, 22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.   More non-rhetorical questions:   On what basis do you have confidence to enter the holy place?  By Christ's blood, or by your own repentance and victory over habitual sin? Why does the Scripture say our hearts need to be sprinkled clean from an evil conscience?    23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. 24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works, 25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.    What is it that we're supposed to hold fast to?    26 For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, 27 but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.    Given the context of verse 23, and the entire rest of the New Testament, what's the most likely meaning of ""going on sinning deliberately"" here?   Denying or renouncing Christ - throwing away ""the confession of our hope"" Habitual sin    28 Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses. 29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?    Here, the Scripture contrasts Moses with Christ.  What's the most likely meaning of trampling underfoot the Son of God, profaning the blood of the covenant, and outraging the Spirit of grace?   Rejecting / renouncing the very covenant of grace which Christ died to establish Habitual sin    ...  35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.    How does one throw away his confidence?    36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised. 37 For, “Yet a little while,     and the coming one will come and will not delay; 38 but my righteous one shall live by faith,     and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him.”   If the righteous live by faith, what would be opposite - the equivalent of ""shrinking back""?   Rejecting / renouncing your faith in Christ Habitual sin    39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.   How does the Bible say we preserve our souls?   Keeping our faith Living in victory over habitual sin   OK just a few more questions.   Where does the Bible say that proper repentance only consists of sadness at having displeased God, and not fear of Hell? Jesus told us not to fear the one who can destroy the body.  Who did He tell us to fear? What is the victory that overcomes the world? What did Jesus say is the work that God requires of us? If you could actually lose your salvation by habitually sinning, does that seem inconsistent with the rich grace God lavished on us in Christ? If your habitual sin indicates you're not actually converted, what should you do?"

Has God actually promised to remember your sins and lawless deeds no more?   Yes, if I'm saved.    Do you believe God, or are you calling Him a liar?   I believe God intellectually. Deeper down I have trouble. I don't mean to call him a liar. But I'm kind of torn. On one hand I don't want to deny something that Christ did for me. But on the other hand I don't want to presume and say ""well of course my sins are covered. I mean why wouldn't they be?""    On what basis do you have confidence to enter the holy place? By Christ's blood, or by your own repentance and victory over habitual sin?   We can have confidence from Christ's blood, but we are supposed to have victory over sin, are we not?    Why does the Scripture say our hearts need to be sprinkled clean from an evil conscience?   Sorry, I'm not sure I understand this. Isn't being cleaned of an evil conscience what salvation is?    What is it that we're supposed to hold fast to?   The faith.    Given the context of verse 23, and the entire rest of the New Testament, what's the most likely meaning of ""going on sinning deliberately"" here?   I'm not trying to be complicated here, but it sounds like it could be either to me.    Here, the Scripture contrasts Moses with Christ. What's the most likely meaning of trampling underfoot the Son of God, profaning the blood of the covenant, and outraging the Spirit of grace?   Well, I would say Rejecting / renouncing the very covenant of grace which Christ died to establish   How does one throw away his confidence?   If one drifts from Christ they can lose a great deal of confidence I imagine. But to throw it away I imagine would mean that the person has made the choice to never return. At least that's how it sounds there.    If the righteous live by faith, what would be opposite - the equivalent of ""shrinking back""?   Rejecting faith in Christ. But habitual sin shows a lack of faith does it not?    How does the Bible say we preserve our souls?    Keeping our faith. But again, doesn't living in victory over sin signify that we have faith?    Where does the Bible say that proper repentance only consists of sadness at having displeased God, and not fear of Hell?   Well, I can't find it explicitly. But didn't Esau regret giving up his birthright? Didn't he want to repent, but couldn't? I'm sure he was deeply afraid of hell. Pharaoh also comes to mind. It says God hardened his heart. Is it not safe to say there comes a certain point where God says ""ok, you take your sin then"" and cease to work with them?    What is the victory that overcomes the world?   I'm not sure I understand?    What did Jesus say is the work that God requires of us?   Repent and believe?    If you could actually lose your salvation by habitually sinning, does that seem inconsistent with the rich grace God lavished on us in Christ?   I don't believe you can lose your salvation. I'm saying that I'm not sure if I ever was, though I am beginning to highly doubt it. I don't believe it is simply sinning habitually that condemns someone in this way, but a continual choosing of that sin over the Spirit's work - which I feel I have done.

Thus, the State contends that, because its miscegenation statutes punish equally both the white and the Negro participants in an interracial marriage, these statutes, despite their reliance on racial classifications, do not constitute an invidious discrimination based upon race.   Same insidious argument in Loving v Virginia.  Loving v Virginia decided that, with regard to interracial marriage, who a person marries is a matter of individual liberty and the state has no compelling reason to interfere, and the court has said that again in Obergefell v.

Reformed,3d8u3h,reformedscot,9,Tue Jul 14 12:10:09 2015 UTC,"The point is that not all particular instances of a universal command apply in the same way to all believers.   For example, it is clearly a sin to poison your neighbor by putting arsenic in his steak.  Any pastor could preach, ""Thus sayeth the Lord, thou shalt not poison your neighbor by putting arsenic in his steak""  But what if we abstract this large principle to a more particlar idea.  There are some who say that eating steak is bad for you (that you might as well be poisoning your family by feeding them steak).  Worse yet, if the cow was fed a poor diet and pumped with hormones the steak is even worse for you.  In this instance can the preacher say, ""Thus sayeth the Lord, thou shalt not eat non-organic steak""?   No one is suggesting that you should not obey the Bible.  That is not the point here.  What he is saying is that it is not possible to make fully explicit what the Bible teaches only implicitly and then force that which you have made explicit onto the conscience of others.  I think this is why the Pharisees added so many laws.  They were trying to make explicit that which, by its nature, cannot be made explicit and universally applicable at the same time.  Consider a woman from India who comes into your church and teaches your women that they should not wear suit pants, and they must wear saris instead.  Her reasoning is that pants are informal and not appropriate for worship.  She is taking a universal command (Whatever you wear, wear to the glory of God) making it explicit (therefore I should wear a nice sari) and then applying that to burden the conscience of others (your suit pants do not glorify God, you instead should wear a sari)."

I doubt that you'd find any believer today who actually disagreed with that statement.  The problem, of course, is that we disagree about what things are implicitly taught, and which are either explicitly taught or are good and necessary inferences.  Where you see an implicit command, I see an explicit one.  This is where we disagree.  Not on whether one must ""bind the conscience"" of others on extra-biblical matters.

You (and I and the author) agree.   But he affirms that the applications are not absolute. You disagree.   I can't be sure, but are you confusing interpretation with application? That is, each passage has a single meaning to the original audience. A truth (or idea) that the author (with God's special guidance, called inspiration) is communicating to his audience--that's a single, real, idea that does not change.   However, when you move to application, you can draw from that core truth several legitimate applications. Theological (what does this teach me about God), existential (how should I act right now), emotional (how should I feel/be loving God and my neighbor?), redemptive (how did Jesus' death impact this?) and so forth.   Applications are not absolute in the sense that there are many appropriate, biblical, healthy directions to go with the proper interpretation.   You get to the proper interpretation through observation of the text. You get to the proper situational applications (plural, and subjective due to differing times places circumstances) through proper interpretation.

Reformed,3d57mf,zip99,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:43:44 2015 UTC,"A big difference is that, aside from the obvious cases, the exact terms of biblical vs. unbiblical marriage are disputed even among churches that are known for being biblical. As you likely know, even some verses relating to the issue are disputed as being not genuine.   Responding directly to your OP point, I think we can probably draw a level of practicality out of Paul's letter to the various churches of his time, where he focused on bigger ticket items, that were more likely to tear churches apart and away from God than others. Another point is that I think facts and circumstances would impact whether it would benefit the spiritual growth of any single person to admonish them for this kind of thing. For some, it might be extremely beneficial. For others, the timing in their spiritual growth may dictate that it's not the best idea. Love would guide the choice, with an understanding that the behavior they are endorsing in in fact sinful."
Reformed,3d57mf,CowboyBigBoss,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:52 2015 UTC,"Well, I come from a denomination where it isn't in dispute because we have a confessional standard for divorce:  ""Adultery or fornication committed after a contract, being detected before marriage, gives just occasion to the innocent party to dissolve that contract. In the case of adultery after marriage, it is lawful for the innocent party to sue out a divorce and, after the divorce, to marry another, as if the offending party were dead."" -WCF Ch. XXIV, Art V.  I may alter the tone and character of my admonishment toward this hypothetical friend based on whether they're a member of my denomination, but I wouldn't applaud a remarriage for someone whose divorce was not allowable by the above standard.

To clarify the point of my question, the heart of it is whether or not a display of the rainbow flag, if it indeed is in approval of sinful behavior, is a subject for church discipline. The process of discovering that is the first part of church discipline, the approach of the individual to the subject for question and clarification. I don't mean that churches whose members display the flag ought to simply announce that they're kicking out everyone who did it."

John Piper, for example, has a different view than many others within the reformed community.    I don't mean that churches whose members display the flag ought to simply announce that they're kicking out everyone who did it.   I wasn't suggesting that you meant that admonishment means automatic expulsion. I was saying that, perhaps, admonishment of this sort should be exercised on a person by person basis even if the various persons all took the same action (e.g., displaying the gay flag). I would expect a different form of admonishment for (a) a long-time member of the church who attends Bible studies twice a week and has struggled with and for years has received counseling in respect of the matters for which the flag represents, than I would for (b) a 16 year old female who accepted Christ a month ago and joined the church yesterday. For the latter, it might make sense to simply preach on the issue to the group at large or perhaps provide reading material. Or even temporary silience on the issue could be reasonable."

The Biblical prohibition is solely against homosexual activity, that is, gay sex. (Now most homosexuals that I know sin in a myriad of other ways- lust, pride, immodesty, etc- while still being virgins in a common sense view of the word. Also worth noting that one can make a consistent argument that unless sexual activity or lust has occurred even someone who is ""openly gay"" hasn't actually committed this particular sin.)  The Bible (and cultural tradition) also defines marriage and its purpose, unfortunately secular govt also uses the term ""marriage"" when talking about civil unions. ALL the Supreme Court did is make it so the gay unions can get tax benefits. However because of how our society views legality as morality, and because the LGBT community's efforts, what happened was essentially a social shift in how we view gay sex.   It's like how lying and divorce are socially acceptable now despite the Word of God being clear.   The issue isn't love or ""marriage"" in a strict technical sense, but the society making gay sexual activity acceptable since people only consider it ""premarital sex"" instead of the own category that the Bible puts it in."

I'm also toying with the idea that a non-sexual relationship dating relationship could be unwise or setting the stage for temptation depending on the person and the circumstance, but not immoral in itself.  My response was more to the idea that ""Premarital sex is bad. Gays can now get married. Therefore, they're no longer sinning if they're married and have sex.""

It would be a silly way of expressing that opinion, but to say its a sin would be a little extreme to me."
Reformed,3d57mf,Ubergopher,0,Mon Jul 13 21:56:15 2015 UTC,"I know people that posted it having no clue what that meant    I just can't believe that, honestly.  I clicked it at the time to see if there were other options or something, and there were too many confirmation pages and information around it.  Facebook wasn't trying to trick people, they were very, very clear what it was about.   I don't think its a sin for a Christian to support the SCOTUS ruling believing that biblical morals should not be the sole basis of our government's laws.   Of course not, and I don't think so either!  But it specifically says ""Celebrate pride,"" not ""yay SCOTUS."""
Reformed,3d57mf,Frankfusion,3,Mon Jul 13 23:15:35 2015 UTC,"""I just can't believe that, honestly.""    Ok. Believe what you want, but it happened.    But it specifically says ""Celebrate pride,"" not ""yay SCOTUS.""    Yep, think we agree on this one. Thats why I said this...    ""It would be a silly way of expressing that opinion...""   Really sounds like we share a similar opinion... I just don't care as much about a facebook picture and its already taken more of my attention then it deserves...  Edit: formating"

Reformed,3d57mf,davidjricardo,1 point,Tue Jul 14 13:22:56 2015 UTC,"Saying something publicly while not reading what you said is foolishness, not idiocy.  And Proverbs has harsh words to say about foolishness; it's definitely a sin.  Again, I'm just talking about people who used the profile picture generator, not people posting rainbows in general.  The generator said what it was for numerous times in giant letters.  To say we can't judge people who said they ""celebrate pride"" is mind-boggling to me.  It'd be like saying we can't judge someone caught in adultery because maybe they got mixed up and thought the person was their spouse and we can't judge their hearts until we ask, maybe they were just being stupid.    I don't get this whole conversation."
Reformed,3d57mf,jpkjpk,2,Tue Jul 14 13:29:35 2015 UTC,"It'd be like saying we can't judge someone caught in adultery because maybe they got mixed up and thought the person was their spouse   If the spouse had a twin, that could be a legitimate time to withhold judgment immediately. It's still a significant problem, but first you ask questions.   I don't get this whole conversation.   Me neither. What is so wrong with asking questions first? If they're in sin, you will determine that very quickly."
Reformed,3d57mf,jpkjpk,3,Tue Jul 14 13:48:57 2015 UTC,"To clarify, the start of the process of church discipline is an individual going to the subject in person and addressing the issue. If clarification or repentance follows there's no need for ecclesiastical intervention. However, if the individual determines that the subject was giving public approval to sinful behavior (same-sex mirage) then I think it's appropriate to bring that to the elders."

Reformed,3d57mf,jpkjpk,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:49:59 2015 UTC,"I'd say it's cause for concern, and an informal talk. If the person is willfully going against what the church is teaching, then it is something to look into disciplining them for. Obviously, they should be VERY aware that the issue is not the rainbow flag, but the fact that they are endorsing it, in spite of church teaching."
Reformed,3d57mf,prolixus,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:46:32 2015 UTC,"Absolutely not.  I'm sure those who change their phot don't see it as sinful behavior.  It's an interpretive disagreement over a non-essential issue (and non-confessional for that matter).  Do we really want to create an environment where church members are not allowed to disagree in any way from church teachings?  Lookout all you credobaptists in PCA churches, you're next!"
Reformed,3d57mf,lower_echelon_peon,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:29:16 2015 UTC,"It's an interpretive disagreement over a non-essential issue (and non-confessional for that matter).    I disagree on both points. It's a Gospel issue because it strikes at the heart of whether or not we can define what sin is. It's also a confessional issue, at least in the confessing Presbyterian traditions:  ""Marriage is to be between one man and one woman: neither is it lawful for any man to have more than one wife, nor for any woman to have more than one husband, at the same time."" -WCF Ch. XXIV Art. I"
Reformed,3d7w6e,irock20012001,6,Tue Jul 14 05:08:03 2015 UTC,We are already in the end times since the resurrection of Christ.  Or are you talking about millennial views or dispensational/non-dispensational views?
Reformed,3d7w6e,buzz_bender,4,Tue Jul 14 05:35:07 2015 UTC,"I think the current dispensational premillennial obsession is profoundly unbiblical.  Beyond that, I tend to be amillennial since that seems to make the most sense of what the Bible says.  But, I can see some justification for a Postmillennial view and to a lesser extent a historic Premillennial one. Practically, I'm not sure it matters.  The ethical implications of eschatology can largely be gotten from all three."
Reformed,3d7w6e,davidjricardo,2,Tue Jul 14 12:23:52 2015 UTC,"I'm non-dispensational because believers come out of the tribulation and dispensationalism promotes a false gospel.  I'm amillenial because I find it to be the most consistent.  That being said, I'm decidedly new to eschatology."
Reformed,3d7w6e,firielazer,2,Tue Jul 14 07:47:17 2015 UTC,why does dispinsationalism promote a false gospel?
Reformed,3d7w6e,superlewis,2,Tue Jul 14 09:27:27 2015 UTC,I'm going to guess he's referring to the false notion that dispensationalism teaches salvation apart from faith in Jesus.

Reformed,3d7w6e,superlewis,1 point,Thu Jul 16 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"Some early dispensationalists were sloppy in dealing with salvation in the OT and implied that OT saints were saved by their obedience to the law, namely sacrificial law. This is not the position of any dispensationalist I know, and probably was not the position of the guys who wrote things interpreted as saying this. However, covenant theology guys have latched onto it like a Doberman to a peanut butter coated t-bone and will not let go of it."

Looking through them...  Pascal's Pensees, Gulag Archipelago Vol 2 and 3, Bondage of the Will, Calvin's Institutes, Burke's Reflections on the Revolution in France, Weber's Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, Something by Dr. Samuel Johnson because he's quoted everywhere, Wealth of Nations, Augustine's Confessions, Edwards' Freedom of the Will.  There's never enough time for reading!  EDIT: But now that I reread your OP I guess you're getting at those sort of monolithic 'bucket list' books. Hmm... Not sure if I have one of those. For my wife it was reading Don Quixote in the original Spanish. For me... Maybe the History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire by Gibbons."

To list them all here would be frustrating from both a typing and a reading standpoint. A couple examples, though, are: Turretin's works, Death of Death... By Owen, Beale's Revelation Commentary, James White's Mormonism books, Evangelical Reunion by Frame, and Kruger's canon books."
