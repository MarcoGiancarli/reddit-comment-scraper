Or will I still be able to find exceptionally clean S2000's in 2017?    Now is not the right time for an S2000. And honestly, I'd wait to see what it's successor is going to do. Assuming the new NSX comes out soon I wager the S2000 replacement will come out sometime shortly after. You may be able to buy a brand new one of those...   I'm willing to spend 35k if it has less than 25k miles, silver on black, AP2 > 2005, and one owner non-smoked in.   People paid less than that brand new, you would honestly be stupid to pay that much for an AP2 - especially Silver/Black (one of the more common color combos). Maybe for the 1 2009 GPW CR, sure, or the 8 2008 GPW CR's. But for a base silver/black? Throwing your money away."
S2000,3e72hm,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Wed Jul 22 14:08:33 2015 UTC,"If you are willing to pay that much, I am going to go out on a limb and say you can probably find what you want if you are searching nationwide. That's a crazy amount to spend on an S2000 though. I'd start looking well in advance and then you can afford to be exceptionally picky. Don't cave and buy something too early. And eventually you will find the perfect car. The car you want is not always on the market when you're looking to buy, so having a long time line will net you a much better car and a better deal. The car you want shouldn't cost over 30k tops."

S2000,3dynz6,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:22:19 2015 UTC,"This is a hotly (pun intended) debated mod, with questionable effectiveness.   The key proof against it is that not only does coolant flow through the intake manifold, but the studs also transmit heat as well.   Another rationale for why these do not perform as advertised is that the airflow through the manifold does not have enough soak time, and the walls of the manifold do not provide enough surface area enough to effectively transmit heat to the air prior to ingestion.   Personally, I remove them whenever I work on a car with them and return it to the stock gasket."

S2000,3dynz6,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 21:48:03 2015 UTC,Any reason you return the stock gasket instead just keeping the spacer?
S2000,3dynz6,IcameforthePie,2,Tue Jul 21 23:37:35 2015 UTC,"In short, I am a stock purist.  I disagree with the concept of what they are, and they do not fit well on the OEM studs. I feel the factory metal design will perform better (less weight, better fitment, better ability to deal with constant expansions/contractions) on a lifetime level due to how the engineers designed the mating surfaces and the testing done with the OEM materials. Also, the cheap ones melt/warp and cause leaks. I return the vehicles with them to a known good/known reliable state."
S2000,3dwbm7,FloaterJones,6,Mon Jul 20 01:57:59 2015 UTC,"Laguna Blue Pearl is generally the most desirable color as aside from the CRs, it is the rarest overall color. I think the reason you see that white '07 going for so much despite having damn near 100,00 miles is because there are only 556 Grand Prix White with a Red/Black interior in the US. So it is rarer exterior/interior combination than Laguna Blue, even though Grand Prix White is a more common exterior color. The unofficial count shows 4,594 white cars (not including CRs) and 1,810 blue ones. So the dealer of the white car isn't wrong pricing it there based on the rarity of the color combo but they aren't necessarily going to get that as $19k is a lot of ask for a car with that many miles. The red interior will chase some away too. Ultimately, it's your preference.  As for what to look for, read this. It contains basically everything you should look at and do.  I also pulled up the Autocheck for both cars. The '06 LBP has had 5 owners all in New Jersey or Pennsylvania. No accidents or other title issues like rental use. The mileage was accrued pretty quickly at first and has since leveled off greatly. The '07 GPW has had 2 owners in California and then New York. Again title is clean and mileage was built up quickly and then falls fast, dropping to barely 3,000 miles over the last 2 years.  For my money I would go blue. I couldn't deal with the red interior personally. Also seems like it is a bit cleaner from the pictures."
S2000,3dwbm7,CygnusOmega,2,Mon Jul 20 03:55:30 2015 UTC,"This.  Plus it depends entirely on the condition of both cars, which you can only ascertain with a viewing/test-drive, following the advice in /u/CygnusOmega's second link.  My personal opinion, of the two, I'd go for blue all day long.  But then again I probably wouldn't buy an AP2, but that's just personal preference."

S2000,3dp61a,TheMuffnMan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:50:50 2015 UTC,"2004 Taillight Conversion Wiring   It's not anything crazy, but you have to cut out the portion where the bulbs are on the car to expand it. And people mostly do it because they like the look better.   I wouldn't be surprised if the car had AP2 front lights too, but those are direct replacement and the owner could have easily sold those in favor of the AP1 lights.   The bumpers are definitely AP1, and from the one picture it doesn't appear to be fitting too poorly. If you take some more pictures of the rear I can give you a better idea.   Another thing that looks like it may be showing its age is the elastic straps on the soft top - those can be replaced fairly easily and will help the top retract further down than it is.   Convertible Top Fix  If you also end up getting that Top Fix, I'd really recommend this little guy, Glove Box Organizer I seriously don't know why I put off getting it. Makes the little glove box quite a bit more organized and it isn't expensive at all."

From my build thread at trackjunkies.org... things I ordered this weekend:   Modifry ""Convertible Top Fix"" -- there is some elastic that is crucial to the function of the top that wears out. Mine is worn out badly. VTEC Solenoid Upper Gasket from Ballade Sports -- These gaskets often leak on high mileage cars. I think mine may be. You usually can't buy the gasket alone, but they had some made or found some or something. I ordered two. Slime 70005 Safety Spair 7-Minute Flat Tire Repair System -- No spare in this thing, don't really want one. This looks pretty nice and will do the job. If not, I've got roadside assist... 25 Honda Door Trim Panel Retainers Clips -- Door panels need a little help!   It definitely has the AP2 headlights, as well.

AP2 headlights look like this  Glad to see you already grabbed some parts, including that convertible elastic! I'd also recommend getting some ShinEtsu grease from your Honda dealer and use it on all the rubber seals around the door, windshield, and soft top. Helps rejuvenate it quite a bit. It's part number is 08798-9013 looks like a toothpaste tube and one tube will last you forever.  Also could look into getting some Urea grease (Part number 08798-9002) and regreasing your shifter.

Very twitchy car and difficult to drive fast.  A wing/splitter will quiet the car down but you should probably get fast without it.

I have a lot of friends that either have S2K track cars or have had them in the past and nobody has mentioned that to me.  I don't really plan to track this thing much or very hard. I have my Miata for that. This will probably see the track when I'm bored on a weekend morning and want to make a quick run to the track. Or when I'm out at the track coaching and want to show the student something or just want to have some fun before I leave. That sort of thing.
S2000,3dp61a,stahlgrau,2,Sat Jul 18 03:38:40 2015 UTC,I have a Miata too.  The S is 3x more cost to run on track.  Miata is more fun but the Honda is faster.

My worst fear driving through that corner is that I'll accidentally drop a tire at the outside before turning in. Do that and it's straight through the grass into the very close tirewall (and in front of everyone eating snacks at the cafe.)

S2000,3dez19,kyroglyphic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:27:23 2015 UTC,"Generally, I've noticed the lean towards a 17"" rim or higher on AP's, so lowering on 16"" might be too low? I mean I only want to lower a little bit but I wanted to know if going low with a low size rim is a good idea.   I had a DA9 lowered really low and it got stolen, when I got the car back I had some donuts (stock dummy ) rims I had to put back on when I got it out of the tow yard. And my car was so low i had to raise it, it was a hassle getting around town with a size 13"" rim.   I'm just asking for advice but I think you might have already answered my concerns."
S2000,3dez19,kyroglyphic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:50 2015 UTC,"Well when you change the size of the rim you don't really change much of the size of the wheel as a whole (or rather you should try your best not to as it messes with the speedo and telemetry). Take for example the AP1/AP2 wheel size. Front wheel on a AP1 is 205/55/16. This works out to a wheel diameter of about 25"". The AP2 has 17"" rims but a lower profile (225/45/17) and this calculates out to 25"" as well.   Generally people go with 17"" because the low profile on the rubber makes it look nicer but it shouldn't matter about what rim size you want and potentially rubbing from being too low...go with what looks good for you...here's a quick diagram illustrating what I'm talking about  Edit: Rubbing as in scrapping because you went with a 16"" instead...you can still get rubbing by going too wide."
S2000,3dez19,remembermereddit,2,Wed Jul 15 20:20:35 2015 UTC,"I'm not a fan of lowering cars, but going from 16 to 17 changes the looks quite a lot!"

S2000,3dez19,kyroglyphic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:34:45 2015 UTC,What's your budget?
S2000,3dez19,kyroglyphic,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:51:30 2015 UTC,"Just finished paying off the car, so about $315 a month extra for doing stuff.  I expect to save up until maybe next Feb and combined with income tax and what not I should have wheels and suspension installed."
S2000,3dez19,snaaaaaaaaaaaaake,0,Wed Jul 15 21:11:54 2015 UTC,If you're not too performance minded then the Tein S would probably be a good spring to go with...if you're not dropping it more than an inch I wouldn't worry too much about the shocks right away.  I know everyone always says coilovers are what you need but personally I've found those are more bragging rights items. If you're not spending at least a couple thousand you're just buying junk. Might as well spend < $300 and get the look you want and know they're not the best springs than spend $1000 and get the look you want but have worse shocks than stock. That's at least how I rationalize it.
S2000,3dez19,snaaaaaaaaaaaaake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:38:54 2015 UTC,"I can understand that, but my shocks were bad when I got the car 5 years ago.  So I need shocks, I just want coils as well."
S2000,3dez19,snaaaaaaaaaaaaake,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:06:52 2015 UTC,"Ah...if that's the case I would recommend the Koni Yellows. Great performance shock, takes abuse, works well with lowering, also offers an adjustable spring perch so you can drop the car about 0.5"" without changing springs. About $700 USD for all four corners. Pair this with a set of springs at around $300 and you've essentially got unadjustable coilovers for half the cost and same performance of KW V3s."
S2000,3dez19,motonaut,1 point,Wed Jul 15 22:58:58 2015 UTC,Are adjustable tien? springs also good with this method ?
S2000,3dez19,ukrainianS2000,2,Wed Jul 15 23:48:10 2015 UTC,Take the money you were going to spend on shocks. Put it towards a track weekend. Marvel at how wonderfully the car handles when its stock   Adding lower and stiffer springs while keeping the same shocks will make the car handle worse. You want shocks and springs. I wouldn't put anything less than KWv3's or Ohlins DFV's on the car. Anything cheaper than that will likely handle worse than stock.
S2000,3dez19,thekush,0,Wed Jul 15 21:02:44 2015 UTC,"This is an 01 and I am not the original owner. The current shocks are shot to shit and have been since I bought it , I'm going to lower this car because it has been my dream to modify an S as I have been modifying every vehicle I've ever owned , the only reason I'm doing it now and not 5 years ago was paying off the car and life is taxing.    I'm upgrading the suspension , the question is what brand.  So you recommend KW  , isn't that a very expensive kit with the Megan brand literally being made in the same shop?  I could be wrong , I'm just going by what my friends at my parts shop told me when I said I should get KW."
S2000,3dez19,tagrav,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:08:15 2015 UTC,"Megan racing is not the same as KW. Megan racing does rip off other companies' designs though so I could see the confusion. They don't make bad stuff. I have their rear bump steer kit on my car. If they made coil overs I wouldn't buy them though.   If your shocks are bad already, then I'd definitely not recommend putting stiffer springs on the car. That will make the shocks wear even faster and you're not going to be happy with how the car handles.   If you can't afford Ohlins or KW coil overs (they are around $2,100 last I checked) I'd say pick up used but not worn out stock shocks.   I understand wanting to modify the car, but if you cheap out on the suspension, you're going to be paying money to have a worse car. Honda did a great job with the handling setup of the car from the factory."

That's something I'd like to change."
S2000,3d9ohc,ErikFalsed,3,Tue Jul 14 16:19:13 2015 UTC,"Welcome fellow Canadian. The 2008 you listed seems way over priced but I guess it all depends on your location. Where I live that type of car would go for a bit less.  I would recommend AP2 2006+ because it will have VSA which could save your butt in a sticky situation.  However being 21 and your first car purchase, I like everyone else will probably recommend you NOT purchase an S2000."
S2000,3d9ohc,themikewoo,2,Tue Jul 14 16:56:53 2015 UTC,"I dont disagree with with some of the points made by mikewoo, I just think sometimes some of us in the S2000 community give the car, dare I say... too much credit.   I have an AP1, I love it.  Especially since I grabbed it with 74K MILES and 10K USD less than the one you're looking at.  The visual styling differences are miniscule, head lights, tail lights, bumpers are the biggest differences, then a handful of smaller things.  I honestly prefer the AP1 headlights, but the AP2 tails are pretty awesome.  Here's what I recommend.  -Lower miles is more important than newer model year, to me personally.  -Yes 06+ have VSA which doesn't hurt by any means, but to me, its not a make or break benefit.  -Clean title.  Many have been rebuilt, and are just fine, but a clean title just has a feeling of freshness to it.  A rebuild will make you think its the end of the world any time you have a small issue with the car.  -If you wait, you can usually save a good chunk buying at the end of summer as opposed to early to mid summer.  But then you gotta wait to drive it.  -With that said, don't drive it in the winter.  -Get another junker or Daily Driver as most car folks like to call it.  Use the money you saved by getting an AP1 or earlier AP2 to buy a car for bad weather if you don't have one already.  My S is my 3rd vehicle.  Technically 4th with my work truck.  -Be patient, if you want this car for a long time, make sure you take your time picking one out.  I looked at at least 10 or 11 others before buying mine.  -I would recommend 02 or newer, as this comes with the glass window factory soft top.  -Take care of the car, religiously.  They are a special little car.  I've owned some awesome cars, but this thing just never gets old.  I drive it much more often than my Terminator Cobra, my Jeep or anything else I've owned.  As I mentioned, I have owned some wickedly fast and capable cars.  Maybe my scale of what's difficult to drive is a bit higher, but this car is nothing but a pleasure to drive.  Yes, taking an on-ramp can get a little squirrelly if your trying to power into the apex, but at the end of the day the car isn't a Dodge Viper or something, it does have some manners.  Respect the car.  Respect the road.  Respect the people around you and you'll be just fine."

Probably overpaid for it. I daily it, but I'm planning on buying a cheap beater to keep the S2000 out of the winter weather. I'd recommend an AP2, 06+ if you can afford it. Not because of the VSA, but because the 06+ is just a little bit nicer than the 04-05 AP2. One of my friends has an 01, and another has an 04. I like mine the best.  I say buy one. Get a clean one and keep it clean. Drive it but take care of it. Don't do stupid stuff in the rain no matter what year you get, and you will be fine."

Get all new O-rings and gaskets for the V-tec solenoid and TCT. Next remove your tct and stretch the springs so that they're about 1.5"" or ~ 4cm longer than when you took them out at resting tension. Next clean out all the oil passages. Use a paper clip and just poke around in there, there's 3 oil holes two on the body of the TCT and a oil feed in the bolt on the maintenance cover, hose it down with brake cleaner after you poked around. Clean it real good, then air dry it, let all the components soak in clean motor oil for a bit. Put it all back together with new O-rings, then reinstall the TCT. 96% chance it fixes it. There's plenty DIY's on how to remove and re-install the TCT. DO NOT! waste your time trying to sand the worm gear, it's completely useless."

S2000,3d64s1,stahlgrau,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:53:22 2015 UTC,Haha I figured. Do insurance rates really go down noticeably if you're not financing the vehicle? I figured I'd just finance it for a long time  with like 5-8k down because I can get 0.99% APR through my bank.
S2000,3d64s1,stahlgrau,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:37:32 2015 UTC,If you finance a car the bank requires they be protected so make you buy collision insurance.  That part is over 50% of the insurance cost.  Call Geico and tell them to remove Collision from the quote and tell me how much it is.
S2000,3d64s1,trinhsetta,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:42:30 2015 UTC,Not that I'm planning to be reckless with the car but I'd feel a bit irresponsible if I got 0 collision coverage. You never know what happens and what % fault the insurance companies may rule. But I just did a Progressive Quote with very reasonable collision coverage and it's putting me at $160 a month which is something I can stomach.
S2000,3d64s1,tagrav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 01:54:26 2015 UTC,Not bad but still $2K a year. Good luck.  There's a reason half the S2K's have salvage titles. Car is not powerful but easy to spin out.  It does not like to drift.  Careful of wet conditions.  Beast of a car for a young driver. I recommend doing a car control day or auto cross in it.  So you can really whip it around and learn the limits of the car.

S2000,3d64s1,redoctoberz,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:51:54 2015 UTC,"there's not.  you look up insurance companies and get quotes.    it's better if you call a agent than just search online.    biggest problem is you'll get callbacks after you do this.    Call a State farm agent, Nationwide, Allstate, Progressive, etc.   Get a quote from a agent, if you rent you can mention that and see if you can get a renters insurance bundle.    I've had geico before when I was your age, they would constantly raise my premuims even though I was a good driver with no faults.  I shopped around and Immediately save $35/month at progressive.  then a year later saved that all over again with state farm.    it pays to shop around on insurance every few years, people like to stick with their same ole same ole but these companies want NEW CUSTOMERS so when you call them all they gotta do is give you a lower price than current and BOOM they got you.    it's really easy to shop around for insurance if you spend the time calling around asking for quotes and don't mind having someone try to sell you extra shit you don't want that you have to listen to and decline."
S2000,3d64s1,tagrav,1 point,Tue Jul 14 11:59:25 2015 UTC,"called my parents Allstate agent when i got my s2000 at 20 and he told me 275 a month but recommended  to call infinity insurance which ended up being 235 for pretty decent full coverage. put that bitch into a ditch, car needed minor repairs but they wanted nearly 500 a month after that. i called progressive with one accident and had them set up a nice policy for 210 a month. i have already seen a drop in price upon renewing hopefully they do it again!"

S2000,3d64s1,redoctoberz,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:41:37 2015 UTC,"the best thing you can do is call as many insurance companies you know and get quotes.    It sucks because of callbacks but you'll probably get a lower quote.    I'm 30 and I've been insured by Nationwide, Geico, Progressive, now state farm.    they all hike your rates up after a while and if you can get things to bundle in like RENTERS INSURANCE it will drop your total insurance bill, trust me it sounds stupid but it works a lot of times.  It pays to shop around but yeah you're gonna be a bit hosed because of your age."

It's a basic as fuck drivers car that's awesome at moving, and evokes a feeling within the driver that can't be written on paper.  That said, I'm sure there are some current or slightly older than new cars that outperform the s2000 in every way, AND provide many more creature comforts, but then it wouldn't be an S2000, and there's the rub.  My S2000 is not a daily driver, it's a summer toy.  My other car is a 2015 Jeep Wrangler which has plenty of creature comforts.  If your S2000 is a daily, you might want something comparable that has more to offer, like a used 128i or a 328i or something."

Maybe if it was just a toy then I would enjoy it more. It's just is the cost of running S2k + a daily better than just chopping it in and trying something else? Been thinking about this for a few months now and I'm still no where closer to making my mind up. haha
S2000,3d5zzi,cryogen,2,Mon Jul 13 20:28:14 2015 UTC,"I used to own a 2013 Audi TTRS as a daily driver. It had an APR Stage 2 tune and downpipe and had almost 450awhp.  It was comfortable and hella fast.  But it made my commute unbearable, having that much power and not being able to use it ANYWHERE in my commute made the car not worth owning.    I got rid of it and bought 2 other cars and I'm much more happy with it.  I'm not saying to but 2 cars, just buy something you can have fun with and be comfortable with on your daily drive. There are lots of options out there, hell even a Civic Si would be a great idea."

With a daily I could track it more without worrying about how to get to work if I crash it.. heh"
S2000,3d5zzi,umadbr4h,3,Mon Jul 13 20:41:30 2015 UTC,I've had an AP1 for 6 years. It has a Comptech SC on high boost. Recently I started obsessing about selling it and getting a C6 Z06. Then last night I discovered the Vtec solenoid had been unplugged. Reconnected it and fell in love all over again. I'm keeping mine at least one more year and then getting a Z06.
S2000,3d5zzi,Tommy_J,2,Tue Jul 14 00:16:08 2015 UTC,"I had a AP1 for about 3 years, fell out of love and sold it to buy a C6 and modded it to 559 rwhp. Then I sold that and bought my current AP1. I would not go back to a C6 even if one was given to me. Those things are like driving an RV compared to a S2000. That and the T56 transmission feels like youre trying to drag a stick through clay compared to the s2000. Many more amenities in the corvette, but the driving experience was so poor comparably. Now, an ls3 in the s2000 would be a fun concept."
S2000,3d5zzi,umadbr4h,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:36:23 2015 UTC,Hey thanks for the data point. I bet I'd feel the same about a base C6. But what about the Z06?  Its only about  300 lb more and 427 power is so impressive.
S2000,3d5zzi,Tommy_J,2,Wed Jul 15 01:38:04 2015 UTC,"It's true the Z06 is more tuned for racing than the base and the LS7 is a beast (although there are several reports that the LS7 is not very reliable), but my base was making more hp than a Z06 and I had most of the Z06 suspension upgrades. Sure, straight lines the C6 is a fantastic car, even in some corners it can be good, and the LS1/2/3 series sound great and are super reliable. But the C6 is a lot heavier than an S2000 and you will definitely feel it in corners, even if youre not on a track. If youre looking for something thats more comfortable, sounds great, and is great for touring, then the Z06 is probably for you."
S2000,3d5zzi,Alcubierre,2,Wed Jul 15 14:46:01 2015 UTC,I've been thinking about your points and they ring true. Maybe I'll keep the S2000 two more years. That would be 8 wonderful years with a boosted S2000. Then I'll move onto a boosted Z06 ;)

I enjoyed them both, but honestly, the noise, the ride, and no space made them hard to live with.  They were great fun, especially on a weekend on a back road, but (and maybe I'm getting old), I guess just ""too much.""  I recently bought a 2014 Focus ST, and absolutely love it. I've got nav, USB slots, heated seats, and a place to store more than a soft sided suitcase. It's my first car with forced induction, so I bought a tuner, plugged it in and got some pretty serious power in a matter of minutes.  Would I trade back? Nope. Do I want both at the same time?

Buying a new part was worth much more than resurfacing the worm gear of my old part. How to replace the TCT. Replacement is easy and relatively quick. It took me longer to take off and put back on the airbox than it did to replace the TCT, itself.  Very important: the two bolts which hold the TCT in place are brass, and very, very soft. I broke the head off one when I was torquing it down to spec, and ended up replacing both with steel ones from my local hardware store. If I had to do it again, I'd replace the bolts with OEM ones (because they must have used brass for a reason, right?): my local Honda dealership sells the bolts for $1.27 each.  Also check your valve clearances, since those start to tick when they get out of spec.  How to adjust your valve lash  I hated this job from start to finish, mostly because of my lack of experience with in-engine work and because it was a huge pain to actually get the valve cover up off the damned engine. Unless you've done this before, you'll want to get both of the tools suggested in the link; they made the job MUCH easier.  I strongly suggest checking the clearances twice: once to adjust, and again to confirm (after you've done your first pass). I had to redo my first few valves (cyl 1) because I didn't do the job right the first time. Learn from my mistakes!  The engine feels smoother and my gas mileage actually went up a bit, so it was definitely worth it."
S2000,3cu3xu,Vrikshasana,1 point,Fri Jul 10 20:51:08 2015 UTC,I actually had my valves adjusted at 36k when I bought the car a few months ago-made a big difference!  I may just go buy a timing chain tensioner and get this job out of the way for piece of mind. That's a relatively cheap part.
S2000,3cu3xu,tagrav,1 point,Fri Jul 10 21:34:45 2015 UTC,be careful with steel bolts.  steel and aluminum don't mix well with corrosion.  you might be better off just buying new OEM bolts.  you'll notice that no bolts going into your head/block are bare steel.  most are the brass look (not actually brass) like you said or they will be steel but coated with a black type paint.

Try and pass the same wall at 20mph, then at 40mph to see if the noise is speed dependent. If it is, it could be one of the metal shields by the driveshaft/brakes that's come loose.   If it's not speed dependent, and it's not coming from the engine, I'd say it's a loose engine shield flapping in the wind."

S2000,3cu3xu,godlameroso,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:25:00 2015 UTC,I thought sandblasting was the (temporary) fix for the TCT. Is there another way besides sandblasting or buying a new unit?
S2000,3cu3xu,remembermereddit,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:30:50 2015 UTC,"If you take your TCT appart you'll notice that the lower half of the TCT worm gear has a different finish than the top part. All this means is this is how far the TCT worm gear extends to provide tension to the chain guide. The sand blasting is to add drag to the worm so that it resists retracting. Eventually the finish gets polished away and you're back to square one.  TCT noise is caused by 2 things, lack of adequate oil pressure getting to the TCT and weak springs in the TCT. By fixing these issues you eliminate TCT noise for good. In fact Ballade and Billman's TCT are modified to fix this issue. Ballade installs stronger springs, Idk exactly what billman does with his.  For myself and my customers, I simply stretch the springs and bore out the oil feed hole just a cunts's hair wider diameter to allow more oil to flow. I also replace any o-rings on the vtec solenoid, and all the o-rings on the TCT, because leaks in that area of the head will reduce oil pressure to the tensioner."

S2000,3cpwl0,LeeKumKee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:15:25 2015 UTC,My 2005 did that for a bit but come to think of it I haven't noticed it happening recently.  I got a valve adjustment back in February and definitely noticed it after I had it done but I don't think I've noticed it in the past three or four months.  Never noticed any negative effects of it so I was never super concerned but I will keep an eye on it to see if it happens again.
S2000,3cpwl0,TrippyJesus,1 point,Fri Jul 10 14:44:02 2015 UTC,"Mine does the exact same thing. Like RPMs drop to ~700, car shudders for a second, then it's normal. It sounds to me like the clutch isn't disengaging and I'm trying to stop with the car in gear. But it'll do it if even if I take it out of gear. I changed my plugs to see if that's help, no dice."

S2000,3cpwl0,yoitssean,3,Sun Jul 12 03:43:20 2015 UTC,You need a valve adjustment. I had the same symptoms when I found out the exhaust side was too tight so I had them adjusted from my mechanic.

S2000,3cm745,devilsephiroth,2,Thu Jul 9 17:12:57 2015 UTC,Welcome.  Make an introduction thread on s2ki.com.
S2000,3cm4oi,NHartz,10,Wed Jul 8 23:52:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going to have to go with: ""Please don't.""   It isn't a great beginner car, particularly AP1s are tail-happy, and you are very likely going to have some level of accident in the next few years (just as your insurance agent). It would be better for everyone if that happened to a lesser car. At 16, having saved 21k is very impressive, but I personally don't see the need to spend that much on a any first car, especially given what I said above. Not that you need that much to buy an s2k, but you also should factor in maintenance costs, planned and otherwise, fuel, insurance, not being completely broke otherwise.  They aren't very practical for an only car (I have a truck in addition to mine), and are more of a raw driving experience than say a GTI, where the responsibility is on you to react (or not react). Maintenance costs will be higher than some other, more reasonable first cars, though they aren't outrageous by any means.  I won't say ""No, there is NO WAY a 16 year old can handle an s2000 as a first car"", since there are always exceptions, but I don't think it is a good idea for you or the remaining clean s2ks in the world. I get that you love them, we all do, but you don't even have enough driving experience to appreciate why. If I were you, and I'm assuming you don't live in LA or somewhere it is paramount to show your status with your car, I would buy something for $5k or less and drive that through high school, and then look at upgrading. You can find a 240sx, mr2, miata (cough), bmw e30, etc, etc tuner car that you can learn on while still having fun for that price range, and it would be a smoother and less expensive learning curve."
S2000,3cm4oi,speede,5,Thu Jul 9 00:31:36 2015 UTC,I can't second that enough.  The kids at school with the nice new shiney cars are just using them as status symbols while the kids that were given the turd buckets with a 5 speed and smoky exhaust learn love and appreciation for their first cars.    You can have just as much fun with a $3000 beater econo box with a 5 speed and not be depressed when shit happens.    Plus high school parking lots are the most dangerous places for a nice car.
S2000,3cm4oi,tagrav,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:10:04 2015 UTC,"Yup, clean s2ks are hard to find. I was originally planning to spend half as much as I eventually did, but all the ones I saw had damaged alloys and other problems that were really noticeable. First car I saw that looked perfect I tried to buy, but I made the mistake of thinking on it for a night and it was already sold when I phoned up. Every perfect car sold before we got to it. Then one came in to a garage one day we drove an hour or so to go see it and bought it there and then. Would have missed it otherwise.  The idea of my car in mine or my husband's hands is a scary thought sometimes, and we are very careful about where we park it. The idea of a new driver driving it is tough."
S2000,3cm4oi,CarlsVolta,17,Fri Jul 10 21:04:16 2015 UTC,"Bear with me, but..This is possibly the worst idea ever.  S2000 is not a noob car. I've had two. An ap1 and an ap2. If you push an ap1 past your driving ability it has a tendency to try to kill you and itself. Although an ap2 is much more tame, its still not a car for a beginner driver.  Not saying all kids crash their cars. But if you don't have very strong discipline and skill you will be a statistic with an s2.  That is, unless you plan on putt putting around like a grandma.. Which isn't believable anyway.  That being said, If you do get one, I recommend that you seek an advanced driving school at a track near you, or autocross.  Be safe and smart!"
S2000,3cm4oi,xxmonsterx,2,Thu Jul 9 00:19:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with you.    The only reason I haven't destroyed mine so far is because I grew up with sport ATV's and the learning/wrecking with a light 50/50 snappy ATV.    the car is a shit idea for a daily driver especially for a 16 year old.    My first car was a Lincoln Continental and the things I did as a stupid kid to destroy that car.    furthermore this guy is going to treat this car like a baby, and then he's going to take it to school everyday and some other stupid kid that doesn't give a shit is going to ding it up all over both sides.    don't get me wrong this car is wonderful and amazing and fun and everything! but idk, maybe i'm just being a asshole here.  but I am glad I didn't have one as my first car.    21,000 saved up for a first car! holy hell that's a lot of money.  My honest opinion is to buy something just fun enough and cheap enough to have a good time and not be at a total depressive loss when the shit hits the fan.  hell you'd be surprised how much fun a D series civic can be for a kid learning his first stick.    seriously, buy some cheaper tuner car.  a FWD MK whatever golf, or civic, or integra or whatever you want that is sub $10,000 and has a stick you can learn on,  trust me understeer is wayyyyyyyy more forgiving than snap oversteer.   there's older nissan 240 options if you really need rwd or even something sexy and older like a E30.  don't put tons of money into modding it because you won't get it back out of it.  treat it as your first car, fall in love with it, appreciate it for everything it is and everything it isn't.  then a few years down the line when you've matured a bit as a driver and learned how to drive a stick properly and you're going off to college or whatever.  then maybe look into going for a s2k.    you're in one hell of a position to have 21k saved up but that's quite a lot of money that you'll probably appreciate not blowing on your first car.    TL:DR   Don't buy a s2k buy a turd car with soul it didn't get from the factory and love that car.  get the s2k some other time."
S2000,3cm4oi,tagrav,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:07:30 2015 UTC,This.  I have had a sporty type of car since i have had my license and a background in motorsport since i was a child.  I have been driving for 12+ years and am considered by myself and anyone I know to be a skilled driver.  I still snap oversteered my ap1 into a curb.
S2000,3cm4oi,xxmonsterx,6,Thu Jul 9 19:09:09 2015 UTC,"why not get a Miata? It has the drop top and it's a great first car. Slow enough so that it won't kill you, and analog enough so that you can really learn how to drive a sports car. Plus, when you get bored of it there is a huge mod scene and a turbo will give you the kick in the pants that a stock Miata won't.   Or, when you feel comfortable with it, resell it for about what you paid for it (as long as you take care of it) and then get your S2000."
S2000,3cm4oi,Eastside2010,4,Fri Jul 10 13:01:33 2015 UTC,if you're dead set on buying a s2000 then no one here can stop you.  drive very conservatively and don't push the car even if you believe in your abilities (that are or aren't there).  get a bigger front sway bar if you're buying an ap1 and don't lift off the gas so easily mid turn.   best of luck to your brother to teach you how to drive it and how well of a job he does plus your demeanor.  i hope you can afford the insurance.
S2000,3cm4oi,klin_,4,Thu Jul 9 01:54:02 2015 UTC,"Most are right.  Although I think some are going overboard with the AP1.  I have an AP1 myself and its not that bad.  I've also driven drag spec 10 second N/A notchback mustangs, Terminator Cobra's and a handful of other very fast vehicles.  Don't spend crazy money on it.  If anything, and considering your bro knows cars... look into getting a cheaper one, possibly with a rebuilt title.  Just make sure your bro looks it over and that its certified to drive on your local streets.  Its never ideal to buy a rebuilt car, but a lot of times these cars get into minor accidents and because of the insurance level expenses that your agent would pay to have it fixed is not worth it so they total it.  Someone else comes along, buts that totaled car and fixes it with whatever parts necessary and its back to being a very nice drivable car.    So why do I recommend a rebuilt S as your first car...?  Well simple.  Even rebuilt it will hold its value.  These things are getting rarer and rarer by the season.  As mentioned elsewhere, with it being your first car, statistically, there is a great chance you get into an accident because of your age and probability.  With that said, its no guarantee you will get into an accident, and more often than not with new drivers, its at low speeds if and when it happens.  Respect the car.  Any car.  Remember its not just your life you have in your hands, but the life of others around you as well.  Respect the road.  Understand that that on ramp you taken 100 times before could randomly have gravel spilled on it one day, or that that blind corner you take a lil too quick could have a biker coming around it.  Do your most intense driving in a controlled track environment.  And take good care of your car, so it can return the favor."
S2000,3cm4oi,Hi-Standards,3,Thu Jul 9 03:55:55 2015 UTC,"I'm with the picking up a nice, cheap rebuilt title s2000 if you're dead set on getting one. Depending on where you're at you can easily find a nice one for 8k or so and then possibly get a nice practical car as a daily and only spend 13 or so.   Insurance is going to end up being the big thing if you end up with one because chances are it's going to be astronomical."
S2000,3cm4oi,scottylike,4,Thu Jul 9 13:15:58 2015 UTC,"IF you end up buying an S, be very careful. Back in the day, when I was 19, I bought an IROC as my first car that I had bought with my money. I had driven my parents' vehicles up to that point. A lot of people tried to talk me out of it and a lot of people had me scared to death. Even the salesperson told me to be careful because it was ""alotta car."" So the first few months I drove it like a grandma and it's likely saved the car and maybe even my life. Not to say that I didn't drive it like an idiot eventually, because I sure did, but those first few months taught me how to drive a RWD car with some power. So please take it easy if you buy an S.  All that said, I'm very impressed you have saved up that amound of money at your young age. I look back now and sometimes wish I had saved my money better and bought a more resonable car than my IROC, but it was the favorite car I've ever owned and I have a lot of great memories of that car.  Be safe!!"
S2000,3cm4oi,UncleFlip,8,Thu Jul 9 16:11:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah im gonna jump on the band wagon and say please don't. I'm 26 now and picked up my s2k about six months ago and it's like learning how to drive all over again. Seriously. People aren't joking around about how these cars can be a handful.   I've driven tons of different cars and bikes. I've been riding for 7 years and driving for 10 now. I'm a competent driver but every time I drive the s2k I have to respect it as much or more than my yamaha r1. I'd rather ride my bike then drive the car if it's raining. The car really is that tail happy. It's a whole different beast compared to a typical car. It demands respect or else it will bite you.   It is also a terribly impractical car. No joke. So for a first car and only car that you're going to DD, it's a terrible choice. Insurance will be expensive as well for a 16 year old so factor that into your consideration."
S2000,3cm4oi,tc110407,2,Thu Jul 9 00:58:21 2015 UTC,"These threads are always a shit show.

Get it but be very, very, VERY careful, especially if oyu listen to people on forums and get summer tires"
S2000,3cm4oi,Kriskobg,2,Thu Jul 9 18:14:00 2015 UTC,"When I was 16 my dad bought me a beat up '89 civic that wasnt running and a service manual and told me that if I wanted to drive it I would have to fix it myself. I learned a lot about cars in general from that experience. I agree with a lot of the other comments in this thread, the s2k is not a beginners car and although some do use theirs as a daily, its not the best idea. If youre dead set on a rear wheel drive roadster as your first car, I would suggest you buy an older miata and spend some time getting it road worthy and learning how to drive manual. You will learn a lot from this experience especially if youve never driven a rear wheel drive car. Then you should invest the rest of the money for your education or buy an s2k in the future. Youre 16, with $21k, buying a rear wheel sports car is not the best thing you could do at this stage in your life."
S2000,3cm4oi,umadbr4h,3,Thu Jul 9 20:23:20 2015 UTC,"I had your same mind set bro and was really hard headed to listen to anyone but I'm glad I did because I own a Miata now and have had some spills in it because of the RWD. Most people say the S is like a Miata on steroids and if I couldn't handle a Miata after two years of driving around in my moms car Ik for a fact you can't handle an s2000. We're both young (I'm 18) and Ik I surely want to mess around and with a car like an S you will get the temptation to take a corner hard and if you're not experienced with RWD you best believe snap oversteer will kick in and get the better of that pretty s2000. Do yourself a favor buy something more predictable like a Miata or a 240 learn stick,how the car reacts to driver input, and the limits of the car. At the end of the day if you get in a wreck you will be glad it was a cheap little Miata or 240 instead of a clean  and expensive s2000. Also please don't think I'm being a dick or I'm being pessimistic, I just don't want the car and especially you to get hurt, you have the rest of your life to own an s2k just wait till you're more mature and experienced"
S2000,3cm4oi,mrweefee,2,Thu Jul 9 14:39:34 2015 UTC,i had a friend get a ap1 in high school.  the car didn't graduate with him.  it died by snap oversteer and a tree.    he even came from a snappy turbo mr2.  it's just not a good car for a young driver and that's the bottom line.  Easy to say today as im approaching 30 but when I was 16 this car was my dream.
S2000,3cm4oi,tagrav,3,Thu Jul 9 16:14:07 2015 UTC,"It's still my dream to own one, but right now I don't see a purpose to own it for a couple months and potentially wrap it around a tree.

Get something that is RWD with low power so that you can establish a good foundation on how to handle a RWD car.  I've heard too many stories of people moving from Civic SI's/SRT-4's type cars to the S2K or BRZ and almost immediately crashing them.  This made a lot of sense to me because someone who learned to drive aggressively on a FWD would developed driving habits that become dangerous in a RWD.

Read that again TORQUE SPEC ON OIL FILTER  once you make contact you need to turn it another 7/8ths turn or 15-18ft lb.  This car has super high oil pressure.  If you just hand tighten like every other car and you drive this thing hard you risk the oil filter backing itself off and your engine spraying oil all over the exhaust manifold causing a fire.  the OEM Oil filter even has markings to help you got 7/8ths  I was lucky enough to read about that about 1000 miles after my first oil change and I when and checked and it was barely snug definitely less than hand tight which was really scary.
S2000,3cl0yt,tagrav,3,Wed Jul 8 23:19:50 2015 UTC,"If you're going to continue to DIY your oil changes, consider holding off a few days and ordering a Fumoto drain valve. It'll allow you to do future oil changes without jacking up or getting underneath the car and the oil drains straight down with no mess of retrieving a drain bolt from your catch pan.  Get an oil filter socket. The filter needs to be torqued down to 16 lb/ft but I find using the 7/8 of a turn method to be more reliable with no risk of over torquing the filter."

S2000,3cl0yt,Sashieden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"A lot of people will recommend the Honda oil filter, but Pureolator Pure-One filters are a good off the shelf alternative for an oil filter.  I've been using them for about 25k miles and have not noticed any particulates in my oil whatsoever.   Any 10w30 FULL Synthetic (I also run synthetic bend if I'm strapped for cash) will work well, but I've heard of oil burning issues with Mobil One, although I have no experience with that."

I for one would never risk that by buying pureolator, which really isn't all that fantastic anyways (or any other aftermarket filter) for the s2000 I owned.   Oem or bust"
S2000,3cl0yt,dandan97,2,Thu Jul 9 02:18:18 2015 UTC,"There is no proof to that statement.  Purolator filters are some of the best off the shelf you can buy.  They also don't break the bank.   For example this is a broken open oem honda [filter].(http://www.tobycreek.org/oil_filters/honda.shtml)  If anything you could argue that in this case the purolator looks to be a better design with larger amounts of metal holding the filter in place.  This is a Purolator filter.  This is a fram filter.   Fram filters have always been shoddily constructed.  But saying that using another well made filter will break your car is just asinine.  It's the same argument as using a certain oil will destroy your motor.  It's completely false misinformation being spread by people who don't want to admit they either a) bought a lemon or b) didn't service their vehicle.    ""there are horror stories of the oil filter failing (splitting, bursting) under high pressure during vtec""   lol what? Show me some evidence.  Sounds like someone bought a bad filter and are blaming the brand entirely.  Honda does not put any extra money into filters, they don't even manufacture the damn things themselves.  My friend actually did some research and Honeywell makes both Subaru filters and Honda filters, which are literally the same designs, just painted blue and badged as Honda or Subaru.  Also Honda and Subaru were both buying filters from Purolator before they switched to Honeywell.  The highest reported oil pressure under v-tec I've seen is 125 psi.  If you're oil pressure is high enough to blow any filter apart you have more problems to worry about than buying aftermarket filters."
S2000,3cl0yt,FusionCola,1 point,Thu Jul 9 00:45:31 2015 UTC,"Honda filters are made by filtech. You can also get the green hamp filters. The main point is that at 80psi at 3,000 rpm you better have something that can be well tightened or modified to not move. As little as 4 seconds with low oil pressure will destroy these motors. Any name brand synthetic is a good choice. Getting a used oil analysis of the drained oil can give you an idea of how long you can go per oil change."
S2000,3cl0yt,godlameroso,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:32:55 2015 UTC,"Any time with low oil pressure can destroy any motor.    I've been daily driving my car, on my own oil changes, HARD for five years now (Auto-x and hard mountain runs).  I have used OEM Honda, Purolator, Mobil 1, and K&N filters.  I have never seen any particulates come out of my motor, nor have I seen any of my filters back off of the threads.  Proper care while tightening sounds like the problem people are having.  Like stated before 125 or 80 psi is not nearly enough pressure to back off a properly tightened filter (or blow it apart)."
S2000,3cl0yt,FusionCola,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:27:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying I've seen it first hand or know someone personally, these are just horror stories I've came across during my time of owning an S. Some people have had problems with them backing off, some people have had worse issues like oil spraying the engine bay, and so on. I'm fairly sure there is a couple threads on s2ki about it and a comment from billman somewhere saying something about that stuff and OEM being the best if not one of the best options.  Either way, I liked the OEM more than the few off the shelf options I saw/were readily available, most of which being smaller than the S filter. They aren't even that expensive in the first place at Honda.   I took care of my S all the way up until getting rid of it."
S2000,3cl0yt,dandan97,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:50:01 2015 UTC,The OEM filters are excruciatingly expensive at my local stealerships.  You get the same results from a off the shelf filter.

S2000,3cmnqg,trinhsetta,2,Thu Jul 9 02:25:53 2015 UTC,"the grinding noise when you let off might be pitted cv cups (if this is the cause then you need axle spacers) if your car is lowered but without more specific details i'm not sure.    the s2000 transmission tunnel gets pretty warm so anywhere along the center console (cup holder area) will feel warm.    i've never encountered the fuel cap issue, but check out s2ki forums as they have a lot of information and you may find your answer there."

Yours might be different, wait for it to blow a code and then scan it to see what's up. Unfortunately to fix an EVAP issue at the garage is $400 or so (that's CAD, may be cheaper depending on where you live).  As for the throttle-off grinding...I'm thinking clutch chatter but you have an 06 so it shouldn't be that. Ideally if you could record a video (with the top up please ;) ) of the sound so we can diagnose it more that'd be great."

I took another rubber hose slightly larger and connected the missing section and never got the light again.    you can clear the code but after ~ 100 miles it'll come back until you figure out what's causing the evap issue.  it's really not a issue that is fun to diagnose if the gas cap doesn't solve it."

Idk the validity of it but billman on s2ki has warned against free revving the engine like that saying it can cause damage.    i assumed he attributed it to the same issue as dry firing a bow and arrow that the swift amount of power/torque going through the engine with nothing to offload on could cause internal failure.    who knows if he's right or wrong but just a maybe don't do it often kinda thing.    got a video of you driving by someone in vtec range?

S2000,3ccpsw,TrippyJesus,2,Mon Jul 6 22:00:53 2015 UTC,"it's into the clear coat which is I suppose ""bad""    Your best option to fix this is two first two bucket wash the area and clay bar it so you can get all contaminates out and truly see all the chips.    there's a product called doctor color chip http://drcolorchip.com/?gclid=CP6MveyMycYCFQoLaQoddZkNWA  the kit will run you ~$60 USD but will be color matched to your car.  you'll get the chips back to ~75-90% with dr color chip and they will bring back a protective layer you lost in the clear coat chip out.    Here's a small album after I applied colorchip to my front bumper/hood You can still see the chips in closeups and this is after a single application.  You can apply more coats if you want and the lower part of my bumper was heavily chipped and I applied the paint with a piece of old cotton t-shirt and smeared it across the paint http://imgur.com/a/B7ppV  You'll get back the near perfect look from 5-10ft and perfect from 10-15ft with 20/20 vision.  but you'll never get them looking 100% perfect from up close where my last few pictures are taken.    my best advice,   STOP RIDING PEOPLES ASSES ON THE ROAD.  it'll greatly reduce the amount of chips you accrue."
S2000,3ccpsw,tagrav,2,Tue Jul 7 13:21:36 2015 UTC,Dr.colorchip is great I definitely recommend it for OP. The previous owner had long commutes which left tiny chips all over the bumper. I went a little overboard and just coated the whole bumper with it rather then just trying to get individual chips but it came out amazing. Planning on doing the whole hood next.
S2000,3ccpsw,ArtisticAquaMan,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:51:22 2015 UTC,yep put some on a shirt and just smear it and the seal act will clean it up.  thats how i did it on my bumper and the results speak for themselves enough i would've done more but I really dont like driving without wax/sealer on the paint so maybe I'll do more after a winter time wash/strip

S2000,3buc6h,scottylike,1 point,Thu Jul 2 06:00:03 2015 UTC,That's awesome. Try and bring it down to $8k. That baby still has a lot of life left. My only concern would be the rear axle/differential. They tend to be weak and I'm sure an impact like that wouldn't have done it any good. Good luck to you and I hope you find the S2K for you.

I had an r title em1 and I had not a single problem with it and despite what I read beforehand I didn't have any problem getting rid of it.

S2000,3bjoln,bl0nd33,4,Mon Jun 29 19:47:50 2015 UTC,OEM is the only top.. or Authentic Mugen. I don't know that I'd get a replica only because I've seen so many and the fitment is never as good as OEM.
S2000,3bjoln,z4ckm0rris,3,Mon Jun 29 21:23:55 2015 UTC,"I second this sentiment. No matter what people say, replica tops are noisy and leak water and air. OEM or authentic Mugen is the only way. Mugen uses OEM seals and hardware making its fit and finish second to none."
S2000,3bjoln,Mack21,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:55:33 2015 UTC,I have all OEM hardware on my Mugen rep and it is as quiet as an OEM. Still paid less than half of the cost of authentic Mugen.
S2000,3bjoln,Mack21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:40:26 2015 UTC,I guess for some it's a risk worth taking. By the time you spend 2k + the cost of OEM hardware you're in the price range of an authentic Mugen FRP. And at that point you're not buying a product that's molded from an already molded product. I could go on and on about why it's still better to buy Mugen or OEM but to each his own
S2000,3bjoln,Mack21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:28:24 2015 UTC,"FWIW, Mugen shaped tops take a time hit on NASA TT too. OEM shaped do not."
S2000,3bjoln,KoocXela,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"Sure. You can go on and on, but it's really a matter of diminishing return. I have a double sided carbon replica with oem hardware and seals and partially painted on the outside. I daily drive and have no issues at all. All of that cost me significantly less than half the cost of a new authentic mugen carbon top. At some point, I'm going to buy an OEM hardtop for winter driving (glass and defroster) and that will just barely push me over the cost of an authentic mugen carbon."

I have a full carbon mugen replica from forbidden usa that I'm fond of but I'd scoop up an oem one if I had the cash. If anything I would suggest getting the oem style mounting hardware regardless of what type of top you end up with. I have solid rear brackets and it's a little noisey if I don't make sure its 100% seated right, in the process of remedying that currently.   http://imgur.com/FObBB5G"

S2000,3bd4tl,NeutralSteer,3,Sun Jun 28 02:20:41 2015 UTC,"Front fender rust is most likely from normal wear and tear. The front wheels kick up rocks and debris, there is no mudflap to protect the fender. On S2ki.com there are a couple of DIY which I recommend.  Only way to tell if it was winter driven would be to look underneath and check for signs of corrosion. If you can't get underneath then look at the control arms and suspension system for signs of corrosion.  IMHO the car is a little on the expensive side. I would say try to get the price down to around $21,000.  Does the purchase come with any sort of warranty?"
S2000,3bd4tl,themikewoo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:47:37 2015 UTC,"The dealer did actually put it on the lift for me, and all of the a-arms had surface rust on them along with some of the other uncoated bits too. Same with the uprights and other suspension components near the tires. I guess a car that hasn't even been driven in the winter would have very minimal surface rust?  Unfortunately, the car is being sold ""as is"" so no warranty at all."
S2000,3bd4tl,tagrav,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:16:18 2015 UTC,surface rust is superficial at best.

S2000,3bd4tl,kyroglyphic,2,Sun Jun 28 02:25:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I went through that entire list while looking at the car. Spent a good hour and a half doing so too, and basically everything checked out other than what I mentioned in my original post. I do still need to get a pre-purchase inspection done though, but I'm just looking for more specific details/opinions about what I did see since I've never owned an s2k before."
S2000,3bd4tl,ascendant512,2,Sun Jun 28 02:30:39 2015 UTC,"I drive mine in the winter but we use a type of salt on the roads here that doesn't corrode the metal. The rust that's on there is normal...I have a bit of that on mine. Just ensure it doesn't spread. Looks like it's hit a few parking blocks on the front...if they spray it that'd be great but I'm not too confident they'll do a good job...might be best to use that as leverage to get a better price and then do it yourself. It's actually not too hard.   All that said $25K is ridiculous (especially if that's USD) but it's from a dealer so I'm not surprised. I would offer $18K and even then you're overpaying what you would pay privately. They won't take that offer either mind you...they'll laugh you out of the store.  For comparisons sake I bought mine for $21K CAD private with the same mileage, same colour and a year newer two years ago. They expect you to pay half two-thirds the MSRP for a ten year old car? I don't think so.   Edit: Sorry I'm thinking Canadian MSRP...that was $50K. $35K USD is what I'm seeing for the states. That's even more crazy.   Edit edit: rereading this I know it's not really answering your question. If you want to pull the trigger on it Id start negotiations at 20K and see how they go. I wouldn't offer more than 21K. It's not worth it...that said ball is in their court; they know some sucker will pay $25K for it if they hold onto it for long enough."
S2000,3bd4tl,themikewoo,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"I definitely appreciate the advice. I figured dealers would overcharge a bit, but I didn't realize you could get S2000s so cheaply through private sellers. I'll have to start paying a bit more attention to the listings over at s2ki. I've seen lower mileage examples (~5k miles) with asking prices just below MSRP which is pretty ridiculous for a 10 year old car.  Starting out at 20k is a good idea, and I'll limit myself to 21k. I figure they won't budge much for the reasons you said, and I'll end up having to walk away. Either way though, it seems like buying private is the way to go."
S2000,3bd4tl,cryogen,-1,Sun Jun 28 15:10:36 2015 UTC,"I saw a car similar to this listed at 24K last year.  It had half the mileage, was 2006MY and was the light blue (suzuka?) color rather than the less desirable yellow.  It was snapped up in a week, but replaced immediately with a beat-up AP1 model - someone traded their old one in towards the new car and presumably didn't pay close to the 24k asking price with the trade-in.  I doubt that they got a good deal, even so."

S2000,3bd4tl,redoctoberz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:52:00 2015 UTC,Wish i had taken some. It was mostly surface rust but it seemed like all of the noncoated components had it.  Good to know. Thanks for the help!
S2000,3bd4tl,mvmntsofthemind,2,Mon Jun 29 00:49:57 2015 UTC,I say don't bother. Look from a private seller. Rust is a pain to deal with and their price is way too high. Any dealer is going to screw you on the price. I just picked up a 2000 in near mint condition for 13650 with 50k on it. If you check private listings then compare their asking price to nada and kbb prices you have something to bargain with.
S2000,3bd4tl,redoctoberz,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:13:40 2015 UTC,Very true and thanks for the input! I guess the search continues on.
S2000,3bd4tl,Stonebag93,2,Mon Jun 29 00:51:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's just our respective areas, but I've seen several cars like this but in superb condition, no rust. I don't think you could get them to come down enough to make it a good price. But hey, it's a dealer, and you may have a hard time finding rust free s2ks in your area, I don't know. I think you could do better.  I paid 22k for a 06 with 22k miles in excellent condition a few months ago. Get financed through a bank and find a private seller. It'll be worth the work."

S2000,3b1wyc,dlennels,2,Thu Jun 25 18:25:15 2015 UTC,if you're doing it by hand you'll be fine. Just be careful with orbitals.   I had a friend use an orbital and it looked great until you saw all the orbital streaks in direct sunlight. He did not use a polishing ball and his berlina black had more swirls than cinnamon toast crunch.

S2000,3b1wyc,dlennels,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:48:08 2015 UTC,"only use compound on areas that need it. If you just have light swirls all you need is a heavy polish at most.   On areas that need the heavy cutting pad you will also need to follow up with a polish, and then a wax (in fact you should ALWAYS wax after a polish). That means you need a medium polish pad, and then a finishing pad with wax. do not use high speed for anything but the cutting pad, and apply light pressure. You dont need to push hard at all.   I don't know any videos at the moment of the top of my head, but if you're feeling anxiety just try it on a lower part of the car in a small area as a test. You'll find its a lot easier than it seems, you just have to be meticulous and patient!"

S2000,3b1wyc,Mack21,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:51:35 2015 UTC,Compound is harsh enough to get 99% of basic swirls out of paint. Polish gives you an insane shine. Do a 1x1 foot test on your trunk or hood. Do the entire process on that one section to see what to expect before tackling the entire car but by bit
S2000,3b1wyc,scottocs,1 point,Tue Jun 30 23:45:52 2015 UTC,Will polishing remove swirls too or should I do the compound then polish?
S2000,3b1wyc,Mack21,1 point,Wed Jul 1 00:11:04 2015 UTC,"Test with the polish first. You only have so much clear coat and the goal is to take away just enough. You'll probably end up going to the compound since it's the first time detailing it.   Do the 1x1 foot test square.   Also a tip, you can always go to the next level with detailing. You'll find how far you're willing to go. Don't worry if it's not 100% perfect. That might not be a feasible goal. If that makes sense"

S2000,3avbql,Lygrin,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:17:02 2015 UTC,Hard to find 11As now. I tried. Price difference isn't so much. If you're Canadian you'll get screwed on the exchange rate when buying from tire rack but it's still < $300/corner. That is if you're buying 255/40/17 or less. The OEM size is actually about two or three hundred less than a plus size.   Edit: you could try 1010 but they didn't have my size in stock. Difference of less than 100 anyways.

Things I plan on doing/replacing soon: Replacing soft top Polishing ap1 stock wheels and installing them Source and replace interior carpet, has tear on passenger side. Removing windshield surround tape Removing fugly oem spoiler Replacing pads+ disks all around Replacing shocks+ springs maybe with coilovers if budget permits Replace oem noisy chain tensioner"
S2000,3aodhq,UberDuper1,4,Mon Jun 22 04:34:20 2015 UTC,"Good lookin s2k. IMHO before you do anything else, replace the valve spring retainers with ap2 parts. And get the bumper plugs. You're looking at about $100 for parts and tools to do the retainers, plus you get a probably needed valve adjustment out of it. While you're in there, pull the throttle body and IACV off and clean those out. The TB gasket is ~$5.  I'd keep the windshield surround tape. Just my opinion, but removing that only looks good on GPW cars.  Congrats on the car. It'll bring you much joy."
S2000,3aodhq,sheptarbar,2,Mon Jun 22 05:19:27 2015 UTC,"Hmm good idea I'll definitely plan on doing that as well. As far as the windshield tape goes, the car has seen quite a bit of time in the Florida sun, so to be honest the tape isn't in the greatest shape and really takes away from the car once you see it up close, so it is definitely coming off. Overall though the car is in good shape and with some TLC I think it will be perfect."

Still much cheaper than any GPW car, let alone an ap2 engine. No regrets.  Oh and the ap2 engine only had 50k miles. And I took the time the time to change the clutch and everything. All in all I got a car perfect with low mileage engine and I know everything that it needed and what got done."

Tighten them till they stop turning and then torque. Don't just get them snug and finish it off with the torque wrench.

S2000,3a49vi,klin_,1 point,Sat Jun 20 04:44:47 2015 UTC,"i haven't wrapped my s2000, but i have wrapped some cars (his rsx & evo 9) with my friend when we learned how to.  he now works at a shop wrapping exotics and the like.  it'll be a major pain in the ass if you're starting out but the s2000 is relatively easy to wrap since it has large flat panels everywhere.    the most difficult are thehandles/mirrors/certain bumpers.  buy quality vinyl (3m, avery) and a heat gun.  make sure to prep the car and that it is completely clean or you will have a bad time.  pre-cut the vinyl before installation instead of trying to use the roll and wrap it at the same time. adequate pulling and laying down the vinyl as one big piece  helps a lot instead of trying to lay it at the corners and just randomly push the vinyl down in attempt to clear the air bubbles.    it isn't too difficult but very time consuming when you first start.  my friend can now wrap an entire car in about half a day to a whole day's worth of work (dependent on size and vehicle panels)."
S2000,3a49vi,vwmikeyouhoo,1 point,Wed Jun 17 09:37:55 2015 UTC,I helped with the install on mine.  My buddy who is a pro and owns his own company that does full color changes ect. said the s2000 was one of the toughest cars to do because of all the contours and angles.  Things I noted.  He made seams on the front bumper and hardtop to avoid the material being massively stretched.  There is no way in hell I would do this on my own without having done several other cars first with someone who does know what they are doing.    I know some people that have done it themselves and honestly it looks like shit.  Its also a huge time investment.  With me helping my buddy we easily invested 30 hours to make the car perfect.

S2000,3a367o,tagrav,5,Wed Jun 17 20:02:06 2015 UTC,First thing is you need to figure out what the cure time is on that paint job and do nothing to it until it is fully cured which might take a while  You keep it outside?  You mentioned a car cover and idk I'm not a huge fan of them but I understand the want if it's outside.  I just feel like they are a better chance of dragging dirt across the clear and scratching it or creating swirls.    I'd get the paint corrected once the cure time has passed.    then have some kind of protection applied either synthetic sealant or wax or both.    and then just maintain it with regular maintenance 2 bucket washes.    you don't have to have brand new paint corrected but it's really that going the extra mile step and will make the paint pop like it's in a showroom.

Hope it isn't too expensive, considering I need to get a new top ASAP!  Thanks again"
S2000,3a367o,sheptarbar,4,Wed Jun 17 20:03:51 2015 UTC,Keep it out of the Sun.  Wax 3-4 times per year.  Clay bar every 3rd time.  Paint is 30% and clear is 70%.  UV rays cook the clear coat.  Always wax on the car is the key.  I wash 3x per month.  Wax 4x per year.  Clay bar once or twice a year.  I've had plenty of 10 year old cars that look brand-spanking new.
S2000,3a367o,CalebMars,2,Wed Jun 17 01:12:57 2015 UTC,I argre with stahlgrau on this and had similar success with previous cars.   Wash on a regular basis inbetween waxes.     Always wax on the car is the key.

S2000,39tnxh,tagrav,2,Mon Jun 15 16:26:14 2015 UTC,"holy fuck man, get that paint corrected.    What are you washing it with a scrub brush and steel wool?    2 bucket wash with grit guards, clay bar, polish/compounding/finish, and don't do whatever you've been doing to it.    are you washing it with a crappy brush, dirty water, and drying with a waterblade/shammy?   somethings scratching the crap out of that paint job.  It doesn't look unfixable but it's in bad shape man.  holograms and swirls all over that thing.    proper paint correction will cost you professionally $200+ unless someone wants to cut you a deal.  Doing it yourself will cost about the same unless you already have the proper tools product/da/pads/GOOD microfibers.      if you don't do anything at least start washing it better than whatever has been happening to it you can extend the paint job and greatly help the overall looks and resale.    if you wanna learn how to do all of that stuff spend a week on this youtube channel to learn techniques https://www.youtube.com/user/Junkman2000 it's a great resource."
S2000,39tnxh,tagrav,5,Mon Jun 15 14:47:20 2015 UTC,I appreciate all your advice but I think you are looking at the residue on the clear bra that's over the front 1/2 of the car.

S2000,39tnxh,solitarycheese,2,Mon Jun 15 16:08:02 2015 UTC,I agree. The original owner had installed years ago. Any ideas on the best way to remove it? The actual paint is pretty pristine but I don't want a line across my hood showing the different wear.
S2000,39tnxh,tagrav,1 point,Mon Jun 15 16:36:47 2015 UTC,"is just the front end covered?  you might get a missmatch in color from the covered area vs the uncovered.  that all depends on the level of care the rest of the car got.      I've never removed a clear bra so I'm of about no help other than watching youtube videos and researching what to do with it.  I would expect to have to do some sort of paint correction once the bra is removed however.    I would imagine you'd wanna try the less abrasive method first.    probably something like a steamer to heat up the material to peel back,  if you don't have access to that maybe like a hair dryer,  I think a heat gun would be too aggressive.    And i'd avoid any kind of scraping or whatever some youtube at home videos might show you just from the first one I found.  It might work but why risk adding scratches to the paint underneath.     I would youtube/google methods and see which one you'd go for first but off the top of my head I'd say go least aggressive first so probably something like a hair dryer and IPA (rubbing alcohol) diluted to ~10-20% for glue cleanup if that exists.    I saw one video recommending gasoline and that just seems too aggressive to me.  WD-40 would probably loosen residue WD40 and I'd recommend using a good plush microfiber to remove any residue with whatever product you want.    this is probably one of the least aggressive methods the show it for a split second on this carrera Gt with a steamer https://youtu.be/uDWWtk-XVtQ?t=47  Here's one kinda just showing it being peeled back with a heat gun.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQ6Rg6yd_PA  (They go into wet sanding the line left and then paint correction with a rotary tool, I wouldn't attempt that stuff if you aren't a professional detailer DA polisher is a tool that while you can burn the paint job it's a lot more forgiving to a beginner)    I'd probably try with a hair dryer first and see how it does and then if I was leaving tons of residue on the peel back maybe move to a heat gun on low.    You should expect to need paint correction work done once the bra is removed, which kind of sucks but if the bra did it's job you shouldn't have any chips on the hood or front bumper."

S2000,39tmg2,Mack21,2,Mon Jun 15 21:59:48 2015 UTC,"CRs did not come in red in the U.S.  If anything, this would be modeled after the Type-S in Europe and JDM."
S2000,39tmg2,aram444,2,Tue Jun 16 00:02:34 2015 UTC,"It's an NFR AP2, the owner simply added a CR trunk that he had painted in NFR and same with the CR front spoiler."
