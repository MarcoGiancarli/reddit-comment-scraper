This time got in a bit early but I'll be below 50 on the cost basis next week from rolling this next call over.  I think RIG is a solid long term drilling bet.  SDRL is worse off on debt, they have some finance restructuring to do,  but RIG can ride the next year on receivables and cash if they have to.  The price fall is due to a ~5% oversupply.  Even if nothing changes natural demand growth erases that ~5% in about two years."

Do you see a scenario where the Euro appreciates faster than the USD?  China's correction is a relative joke and they haven't had a recession in nearly 3 decades. You can't continue to ride the catch-up effect when you're already the strongest economy in the world and China knows this.

wallstreetbets,3e30xo,Not-so-bad-,3,Tue Jul 21 20:36:16 2015 UTC,I really think that playing apple today is a bad idea. I do not think that there is any sort of news that they will come out with that will move the stock price. Especially with an implied move of 6%...   I see the premium sellers making out like bandits on this one.
wallstreetbets,3e30xo,Not-so-bad-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:12:58 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, premium sellers are making a lot of money, but if they're wrong I'd really hate to be on that side. However, no one will ever do naked puts with out anything to cover losses. I'll probably hold out of AAPL until dividends are paid out."
wallstreetbets,3e30xo,jcarmona24,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:19:26 2015 UTC,"Ya premium sellers wouldn't lose, they would just lose on gains past their recognized gain (not quite sure how to word that).

wallstreetbets,3e30xo,Not-so-bad-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:27:36 2015 UTC,"Nah, it's when someone writes a put. Basically sell to open a put, you get to collect the premium on the spot and every day that goes by you collect the theta. If you get assigned then you are usually in big trouble."

wallstreetbets,3e30xo,Not-so-bad-,2,Tue Jul 21 16:43:17 2015 UTC,"The quarter being reported is an insignificant quarter, but people are worried about Apple being a one trick pony. With all the bad press around the Apple Watch, I really doubt that they are going to come out with great watch numbers. Without great watch numbers, it will not matter if they meet or slightly beat expectations in all other areas.  Basically, Apple is always expected to blow out expectations and that is already priced in. They will have to blow out expectations by an unreal amount in order to cause a significant move tonight."
wallstreetbets,3e30xo,masterbatts,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:08:49 2015 UTC,I don't think the watch market is ever going to develop.  Humans are too restricted to operate on the wrist when we have absolutely amazing smartphones that we can take full comfort with as we have two hands to use them.

wallstreetbets,3e30xo,Not-so-bad-,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:28:58 2015 UTC,"I think that you are right, at least for the time being. The smart watch market is not where it needs to be for Apple right now. But then again, the smartphone market was not fully developed when the Iphone first came out either."
wallstreetbets,3e30xo,JamesAQuintero,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:01:39 2015 UTC,"I believe Apple is popularizing the market. The only people I knew with smartwatches prior to announcement of Apple's were a small group of the 'techies' rather now it's a 'cool' product.   Smartphones were primarily made for businessmen, techies, and people who could justify the expense of one for their job. Apple's iPhone popularized it and now look at the smartphone market.  Hopefully the watch will increase competition to lower the pricing and get more people into the products.  Short-term: the watch is not an apple success story  Long-term: I can see the watch happening."

That is a legitimate reason to worry, I am still bullish on Apple, but what if another company came out with an insane smartphone that everyone wanted now. Apple would be washed away overnight... Their only safe haven is their cash reserves, granted that it is a ridiculous amount of cash..."
wallstreetbets,3e30xo,Areumdaun,0,Tue Jul 21 19:00:31 2015 UTC,Lol you're talking like someone can just build a smartphone that instantly the whole world wants. Even a phone with some revolutionary feature would just be instantly copied or bought out by Apple. This is a non scenario
wallstreetbets,3e30xo,detain12,2,Tue Jul 21 19:39:09 2015 UTC,I bet you said the same thing about microsoft when Apple was nothing. Have you heard about Xiaomi? They are supposed to become the next big competitor to Apple. We'll see if that ever happens. There will always be a more innovative company just waiting to take over the market. Apple just needs to make one critical mistake.

Targeted radiation therapy is where the industry is headed and their drugs are best in class from what I've read.   Plus, they've got Dr. Frost (billionaire doctor/investor/advisor) on board who has a solid track record of taking small biotechs to the big leagues.    They aren't making money, but that's not uncommon for for clinical stage companies and they don't have a ton of debt or unreasonable dilution looming.    There's a decent chance they get bought out in the next year, but if they partner up instead and remain under their own control, I wouldn't be shocked to see it at $50-60 in a couple of years.

wallstreetbets,3e2e8p,aspiringanalyst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:52:47 2015 UTC,"Having used a verity of 3d printers, I personally prefer their printers to the others. Also I like their business model of acquiring vast amounts of other comapnies. This is all a crap shoot I know, but I like them. Also, they are up 3% in half an hour today:D making money"
wallstreetbets,3e2e8p,aspiringanalyst,2,Tue Jul 21 13:54:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed. People often forget 3D printing has been around longer than consumer internet. It has been used quite a bit in industry but lately speed/QA expands the market ten-fold. Consumer 3D printing might be a fad; bubble chased that. Metal printing (still has QA issues) and medical fields (implants, devices, prosthetic) lends itself really nicely to DDD, which has made significant headways. This is also why I pick DDD over SSYS anyday (making a bet on Makerbot and hence consumer was the wrong bet IMHO).  The big concern with DDD is declining profitability and a silly number of acquisitions (that are guaranteed dilutive). There's just no way a company can ingest 50 acquisitions in the span of 2 years, especially if you want to incorporate some of the tech. At the same time, it's trading at below bubble levels even though revenue grew substantially over that time period."
wallstreetbets,3e2e8p,aspiringanalyst,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:09:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like its a long term investment. I believe they will be able to take in all the tech from their acquisitions, its just not a short term possibility. Getting in right now can almost promise high returns"
wallstreetbets,3e2e8p,dicksdicksdicks1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"I agree it's oversold and undervalued right now given its operations.   As someone who's worked on acquisitions for companies in-house. I'd say most acquisitions fail. Makerbot has already been written down 30%. The good thing with DDD is their acquisitions are smaller, which are easier to ingest people-wise, but technology is still difficult to implement into new systems (at least software-wise). I can go into a whole slew of reasons why acquisitions fail, but would rather take it offline since it gets long...."
