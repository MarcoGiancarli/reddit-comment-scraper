It's hardly preachy for a professional comedian to fight for the right to do his job well."
DailyShow,3dbbjy,violatedchimp,2,Thu Jul 16 07:49:46 2015 UTC,"Comedy is designed to make people laugh. If you choose to push boundaries, you may. If you do, people may push back. No one is obligated not to be offended. Also, the comedian retains his right to do his job just as the audience retains the right to like and dislike what they choose."
DailyShow,3dbbjy,ademnus,2,Thu Jul 16 12:50:32 2015 UTC,"You can't make people laugh consistently without pushing boundaries.  Laughter comes form the unexpected, and creating the unexpected from the boundaries of common society is almost impossible.  Any comedy comes from an observation or an event that isn't standard, so boundary-pushing is fundamental to comedy as an art form.   If you choose to push boundaries, you may. If you do, people may push back.    That is some puritanical thinking right now.  If an artist chooses to push a boundary by expressing or denouncing an idea, this in no way is justification for people ""pushing back"", which from experience includes people trying to destroy the artist's career, reputation, etc.  You're justifying attacking a person with the justification that he first attacked an idea because somehow you've conflated the two.  If ideas aren't fair game, then not only can comedy not thrive, but society isn't free to express itself.   Also, the comedian retains his right to do his job just as the audience retains the right to like and dislike what they choose.   Obviously an audience can dislike whatever it wants.  It becomes a problem when the audience then tries to remove the artist from a position of prominence despite the artist being well-enough liked to be there in the first place.  A lot of people like Trevor Noah.  If you don't like him that's perfectly fine.  But trying to make Trevor Noah disappear because you don't like him is how you get more and more bland comedy -- the type of comedy that doesn't upset anybody and is just there for cheap laughs.  If you're offended, find someone who doesn't offend you.  A lot of people, though, want to see comedy that pushes boundaries rather than ""comedy"" that panders to the perpetually offended."

If an artist chooses to push a boundary by expressing or denouncing an idea, this in no way is justification for people ""pushing back"", which from experience includes people trying to destroy the artist's career, reputation, etc.    Tak about the slippery slope. We're talking about audiences who are not finding the material funny getting up and leaving, which is their right. You have somehow turned that into ""ruining their career."" An entertainer is made or broken by their audience and that's who you play to. If you are offending or pissing off your audience, you don't know what you're doing."

I'm talking about spearheading a campaign to get the comedian fired or, in the case of Trevor Noah, preventing him from getting a job on the Daily Show.    And trying to offend people is its own genre of comedy, so yeah I think they know what theyre doing.  If your audience doesnt like being offended then you need to wait until you get a following of people who dont mind.  If you change your whole personality into what you think people want, then you just become generic.  Oh, and slippery slopes arent necessarily fallacies.  Just thought I should add that"

I realized that this is probably a big reason why he's leaving. I don't think he could stay anywhere near objective and would just get too pissed off if his candidate loses.  Looking back on the reactions to '00 and '04, I think there was a feeling of betrayal that he had a hard time keeping out of the show, and a lot of people called him out for it."

I just remembered recently that we got HBO Go and I've been marathoning during the current DS break - John Oliver fills the hole and is even BETTER because he has no obligation to self censor due to FCC restraints or advertising restrictions.   Shit is REAL.   edit to add: I'm not trying to say that John Oliver himself is better than our beloved Jon Stewart. The content of the show, however, beats Daily Show far and wide now because it is achingly obvious how many pained interviews with movie stars Jon Stewart has to bullshit his way through halfheartedly. There's none of that on Last Week Tonight."
DailyShow,3ct4zq,Slashgate,6,Fri Jul 10 17:42:46 2015 UTC,John Oliver is great! I haven't missed a show yet. But he will never have the reach and influence of JS.

DailyShow,3ct4zq,limeade09,2,Thu Jul 16 11:37:42 2015 UTC,"Well, to put it into perspective... in 2003 (4 years into Jon Stewart's run), The Daily Show was averaging ~1 million viewers. As of 2013 it gets ~2.5 million nightly viewers.    Last Week Tonight's first episode, had 1.1 million viewers. 1.4 upon a second showing. Last Week Tonight is currently getting ~4.1 million weekly viewers.  I'd say he is poised to be at least as big as Jon Stewart if he sticks with it, not to mention that HBO is now expanding their service to cable-cutters."
DailyShow,3ct4zq,filmantopia,2,Thu Jul 16 18:41:22 2015 UTC,"I was counting down the days for LWT ever since I heard Oliver was getting his own HBO show. I fell in love with him when he filled in while Jon was filming Rosewater.  But I don't think it's near as good, even without commercials and no obligations to censor. He makes a specific point to completely avoid being partisan, even though we all know he's a die hard liberal. You can argue it's barely even a political show.  Also, I disagree that the content is better. So many of the issues that are dedicated to the main segment would be better served in a 2 or 3 minute segment. Plus the way he uses constant metaphor after metaphor after analogy after metaphor after analogy gets realllllly old."
DailyShow,3ct4zq,critically_damped,2,Tue Jul 14 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"I love Last Week Tonight, but it's less suited to cover the nuances of the day-to-day election news. Not only because of it's weekly schedule, but because the show seems less determined to harp on the republican party all the time, and more interested in covering a broad range of topics as well as international affairs.  It'll be interesting to see if the election and absence of Jon Stewart calling out the perpetual right-wing bullshit invokes a pivot in the show's choice of material."

He had his own 'fair and balanced' problem for so long, and even to this day he maintains a streak of arrogant conservatism and forced even-handedness that makes me want to scream.

I love him, but he's great as a comedian, not a journalist (not to say that he and his staff don't turn out excellent journalistic segments). When he does get people who need to have their feet held to the fire, he's kinda gun-shy. Some of that is format, obviously - TDS doesn't have the cred to allow such grillings and still get big-name guests - but it's there.  If you want to see good interviewing, check out some of the more hard-nosed British political programs. They put their politicians through the wringer over there, to an extent that Americans often find shocking.

Why do we have a voting system that allows for multiple candidates to have such a spoiler effect?  We are systematically punished if we support the candidate we like best.  If we don't vote the candidate we hate, we risk helping to elect the guy we hate even worse.  In the primary, we also can't support the candidate we like best because we have to worry about whether or not he is viable in the general election.  What we should do is replace all party primaries with a single non-partisan primary that uses approval voting (voting for all the candidates you like instead of just one).  The two candidates with the highest approval rating would face off in the general election.  Voters can always support their favorite without fear because non-viable candidates won't make it in the top two.  Also, approval voting would assure that both candidates aren't too bad."

DailyShow,3cdvwy,Tytillean,-17,Tue Jul 7 04:30:26 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  He twisted Trump's words into something else entirely instead of listening to what Trump was saying.  If people would listen to Trump, this shit wouldn't happen."
DailyShow,3cdvwy,Tytillean,6,Tue Jul 7 13:22:32 2015 UTC,That's completely irrational.
DailyShow,3cdvwy,judahlow,5,Tue Jul 7 18:27:41 2015 UTC,Found Trump's account.
DailyShow,3cdvwy,malonkey1,6,Tue Jul 7 21:03:25 2015 UTC,That depends. Is a sample size of one enough to prove anything?
DailyShow,3cdvwy,Rastiln,-18,Tue Jul 7 04:10:40 2015 UTC,Yeah.  It's enough to prove that Trump was right.
DailyShow,3cdvwy,retconk,6,Tue Jul 7 13:25:14 2015 UTC,"Yeah, except no."
DailyShow,3cdvwy,__ghostpants,3,Tue Jul 7 23:06:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah... Trump was being racist, and not producing legitimate points on border security.  Besides, the overall crime rate within Latino and Mexican immigrant communities is lower than the general population.  They tend to be an economic boon as well as a strong and diverse voting bloc, making Trump's remarks even more ridiculous.  They just bother people because they speak a different language.  And that's not a real reason to do anything but make available more adult ESL classes.  Illegal immigration is a real problem, and it deserves discussion, diplomacy and solution. But no one should ever apologize to Donald Trump.  His method of discussing immigration, illegal or not, is that of a fuckwit.  Also, he seems to genuinely piss on and hate America, her people, and her system of government, so screw that guy."
DailyShow,3cdvwy,n00bsauce1987,-12,Tue Jul 7 06:28:18 2015 UTC,"This is the problem.  You completely agree with Trump and yet you think he was being racist.  Anyone who criticizes Mexico or illegal immigration is labeled a racist.  He never, ever said anything racist.  He was hyperbolic, but the point was that illegal immigration is a problem and that Mexico is doing shit about it.  For some reason, people like you and Jon and Macy's ignore what he said and pretend he was attacking Hispanics and calling all Hispanics rapists.    So yes, lots of people owe him an apology."
DailyShow,3cdvwy,limeade09,2,Tue Jul 7 13:24:37 2015 UTC,"he called illegal immigrants rapists, not all hispanics"

DailyShow,3c5zk9,El_Fader,3,Sun Jul 5 21:36:32 2015 UTC,Maybe she's so unenthusiastic because she doesn't believe in keeping the mountain named after McKinley but has to endorse that for her job?
DailyShow,3c5zk9,bshively,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:07:57 2015 UTC,"I suppose that's a good possibility, but even if that's the case, she should ""own it.""  Otherwise it gives the appearance that her soul is dying a little inside."
DailyShow,3c5zk9,El_Fader,1 point,Mon Jul 6 16:40:38 2015 UTC,"FYI, McKinley does have something to do with the mountain. It was named as political support for him, who was at that time a presidential candidate.  It doesn't make it a better name, and I agree that it should be named Denali, but to say that it's completely unrelated is not completely true."
DailyShow,3c5zk9,winterd,-3,Wed Jul 15 05:27:35 2015 UTC,"Donald Trump defends his ""racist"" remarks.   FTFY.  I wonder how Jon will be apologizing to Trump now that a woman was killed by an illegal Mexican immigrant.  I'm guessing he'll just ignore that and continue to distort Trump's meaning."
DailyShow,3c5zk9,amornglor,5,Tue Jul 7 03:57:31 2015 UTC,"He is not distorting anything, Trump is an idiot who probably did not even realize what he was saying is racist.  There are about 30 people per day shot and killed by someone in the USA, just because one illegal Mexican killed someone does not make what Trump said right.  http://www.romans322.com/daily-death-rate-statistics.php  Not to mention that everyone living in this country now is here because at some point in the past an immigrant came here from somewhere else in the world and settled (and maybe even stole land from and killed Native Americans)."
DailyShow,3c5zk9,DKSArtwork,-2,Tue Jul 7 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"I seriously don't understand how people think it's racist.  Does anyone realize that Mexico is a country, not a race?  And furthermore, he was specifically talking about the Mexican government and Mexican illegal immigrants.  It had nothing to do with being Hispanic.  He said the border was unsecure and that illegal immigrants represent the lowest of society.  Illegal immigrants bring their problems with them, meaning crime, poverty, etc.    I don't even agree with him but I'm fuckin' tired of seeing everyone flat out ignore what he actually said and make up bullshit he didn't say to attack him over."

DailyShow,3c2sxl,mielita,8,Sat Jul 4 05:49:30 2015 UTC,It was a much different environment and culture back then. After 9/11 people's heads were in a different place. Case in point: the 80% Bush approval rate.  There's a reason the Patriot Act was passed despite so many confessing to having not read it.  Jon isn't always above the b.s. He's just a person.  Or maybe he was just playing devil's advocate to spur on debate. I don't know.
DailyShow,3c2sxl,CabbageFarm,4,Sun Jul 5 02:06:26 2015 UTC,This was also when there was still hope that the government might use it to actually find terrorists.

TDS offices were damaged in the Trade Center attacks, irrc. The Daily Show didn't air for a few days afterward.  Words can't describe how happy I was to see it in production again, even if it was mostly replayed pieces and Jon crying in the intro. TDS was back. Can't keep America down."
DailyShow,3c00jz,TheInfirminator,5,Fri Jul 3 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"Offices were not damaged, but the city was essentially shut down. Only TV being produced was news."
DailyShow,3c00jz,sharilynj,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:13:01 2015 UTC,"TDS is based in midtown, they were not damaged but Comedy Central had preempted all programming and instead mirrored the feed from ABC or CBS or NBC for over 24 hours. The Daily Show episode had to have been from the 13th."
DailyShow,3c00jz,sulaymanf,2,Sat Jul 4 03:32:39 2015 UTC,"Now I remember. Most channels were just playing the same news broadcasts, CC included. I don't know where I got the thing about TDS offices being damaged. When I was watching some of those old eps, Jon was heard to remark ""my apartment still has soot in it."" So maybe his home was damaged in some way, and that's what I was thinking of."

DailyShow,3c00jz,star6966,2,Fri Jul 3 15:22:06 2015 UTC,"Wait, did they skip some of them?  I thought it was supposed to be on later today..."
DailyShow,3c00jz,executeordersixtysix,5,Fri Jul 3 15:50:56 2015 UTC,"No (at least I don't think so). Initial estimates on /r/month_of_zen allowed for many more commercials than they are actually airing. At the time the first estimates were made, people were guessing at at least 27 minutes per episodes including commercials and content not already visible on TDS's video archive, but it was actually almost 24 minutes per episode. That basically boils down to an ""extra"" episode of TDS every ~3.2 hours or so, which over the period of a week adds up to several hours of saved time.  EDIT: some people may have also been anticipating that some ""extra"" episodes not currently available on TDS or listed on the wiki might be aired because there are several spots where abnormal gaps are observed, but it seems those were actual broadcast gaps and not phantom episodes."
DailyShow,3c00jz,FullmentalFiction,2,Fri Jul 3 16:00:45 2015 UTC,That's rough.  I was definitely planning my day based on those estimates.
DailyShow,3c00jz,executeordersixtysix,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"Try my MOZ tracker.  I have to keep updating the offset because, yes, they are in fact skipping episodes.  My calculation shows that about 180 of the ~2600 episodes.  If I knew the missing episodes, the tracker would stay on track the whole time... hopefully I can get it 100% working before the month is up.  Here's the link  edit: my math was wrong, it's 180 skipped eps.  http://mtschoen.github.io/month-of-zen-tracker/"
DailyShow,3c00jz,sc0neman,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"I think the only phantom eps are the Summer Spectacular, Daily View, and Steve Carell Salutes Steve Carell. These were considered ""specials"" and not part of the series, even though they aired as such."
DailyShow,3c00jz,sharilynj,2,Fri Jul 3 19:15:04 2015 UTC,They skipped most of the ones that Jon didn't host while he was away acting or having babies or whatever.

DailyShow,3c00jz,Mercurydriver,4,Fri Jul 3 15:52:11 2015 UTC,"You can catch all of the individual segments at the daily show website, the only thing missing from the video archive is the end credits (you're not missing much there). Otherwise I'm sure someone out there recorded it and will be making it available in its full form at some point."
DailyShow,3c00jz,FullmentalFiction,2,Fri Jul 3 16:02:34 2015 UTC,"I guess I could try that. I am just kicking myself at the moment because I have been meaning to watch the 9/20/2001 episode and forgot he went on vacation for the beginning of September, making me miscalculate when it'd play online.  I hope someone has it in its entirety somewhere. But I'll have to stick with manually watching clips and bits at a time."
DailyShow,3c00jz,Mercurydriver,2,Fri Jul 3 16:12:06 2015 UTC,"I got it. I'll have to clip it out of a 2hr chunk of video I took this morning though. I've had it on at my house 24/7, I'm somewhat transfixed and developing a compulsion to archive everything I can.  My hard drives are gonna hate me."

When it began, it was much more focused on providing satire comedy about pop culture events and people.  Jon Stewart did mold it into quite an amazing show, but at its core it has always remained a satirical comedy show. While its viewership does tend to be pretty knowledgable about current events, and they gain some of this knowledge from the show, it shouldn't be a persons sole source of news."
