If I could /r/cringepics the stuff she says I'd be a Karma-millionaire by now. Seriously.  On the other hand, I know exactly how you feel splek. I know odds are that I've been on the same track this long that I'm not going to veer off it. BUT just because I'm foreveralone doesn't mean I can't work on myself, or work towards things that I want in life. Just because I'm stuck inside doesn't mean I can't have a career and friends.   Fuck it. Maybe my life is shit on some levels but it's my life and I've got to do the best I can do. Even if that means doing nothing at all because I'm in a place where I can't get shit done right now. Because sometimes your only job is to wake up that day and that's okay.

ForeverAloneWomen,3e158f,Takei_Me,5,Tue Jul 21 03:54:04 2015 UTC,"I would say that the people I'm attracted to ('Set A') is a subset of the people I find attractive ('Set B'). People that are in Set B but not Set A would be people that I can objectively recognize as being conventionally physically attractive, but have some characteristic or personality trait that I feel would be incompatible with me. Meanwhile, many people in Set A may not be a typical ""hot"" person, but he might have a great sense of humor, or we might have the same taste in music, or he might be just a genuinely kindhearted person, or he might have a sexy voice, etc etc.   So yes, there's more to it than just looks."
ForeverAloneWomen,3e158f,AdventuresInSolitude,4,Tue Jul 21 05:52:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm exactly the same way.  I'll be like, yeah, that guy's good-looking or bad-looking, but whatever.  And then when you like the personality, you're like omg, that guy is amazing. True story."
ForeverAloneWomen,3e158f,JDNow,5,Tue Jul 21 05:30:08 2015 UTC,"I think I may be one of the people OP is referring to.   My feelings aren't conjecture, they're the result of my real experience.    It's a fact of life that looks matter.  Ask any of your male friends who they consider the most attractive girl in the world.  Chances are it will be some celebrity they don't know, but who is really hot.  Ask a woman the same thing- chances are it'll be some tall, handsome, lean muscular man.  That's just the way things are, you can't change human nature.  Looks are the threshold.  You may want an intelligent, funny, kind girl, but first she has to be pretty.  No problem with that, women are mostly the same anyway."
ForeverAloneWomen,3e158f,cimarafa,3,Tue Jul 21 09:48:07 2015 UTC,"I find it a bit off-putting too. I also care much more about personality than about looks. And I don't think I'm FA because I'm a whole 2.5 inches shorter than average or whatever.  That said, looks do come into the picture when you're trying to find a partner. I'm not proud of this, but there are a small number of people who are just so physically unappealing to me that I would not be ready to date them even if they had perfect personalities. It's cruel and unreasonable, and I am really trying to overcome this prejudice, but I haven't managed to yet.  So, since I have this huge beam in my eye, I'm not sure it's my place to contradict people who feel their appearance is an obstacle to them. Without actually having seen someone, I certainly can't say in good conscience that it wouldn't matter to me. It probably wouldn't... but it miiiiiight.  Also because this is reddit, there's a large and very noisy crowd of people surrounding us who actually are totally focused on appearances. I want nothing to do with that attitude, but the noise leaks in sometimes and it's hard to tune it out."

And then I feel guilty because I'm picky about, let's face it, probably more than nine other things.  When I look around me on an average day, most of the men I see are physically attractive enough that I'd date them, if I were looking to date and if I thought we were compatible in other ways.  At this point in my life, I'm not sure I'd even consider dating someone who was conventionally attractive. Why bother? If I could get someone good-looking and compatible with me, I could probably get someone with even more fantastic qualities who was less good-looking, and who would probably consider me more desirable than the good-looking guy would."

ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,coralya,5,Mon Jul 20 18:56:18 2015 UTC,"While it certainly isn't a traditional date, it's still social interaction between two people who could potentially be interested in each other.  Despite being very anxious about meeting new people, I think I would prefer a physical date rather than one on Skype. I think in a way Skype could be more intense, you'd be looking right at the person most of the time. There's nothing in the environment to distract you. If you don't have something to talk about...it could get  pretty awkward."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,GreenSkyFish,5,Mon Jul 20 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"Probably my number-one least favorite thing about dating is having to sit across from another person. Lord, how I wish dates could be conducted sitting on adjacent sides of a table, or even sitting next to each other.  I know that makes me sound ASD as hell."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,coralya,2,Mon Jul 20 18:30:22 2015 UTC,"ASD?   I get what you mean. My first date was awkward as hell, I'll never forget it. It was at a coffee place, the table was longer than usual. She sat at the other end in front of me...it felt like a fucking job interview at times.   What you're wishing for is definitely possible though! Actually, it would be pretty unique and fun, I think people would appreciate mixing it up. There are lots of coffeeshops that have older style seating with sofas and armchairs. If you find a place like that, you could sit next to each other (or avoid a table all-together) and it wouldn't be as intense.   If you live in NYC, I could recommend some places. And by ""some places"" I actually just mean two because I don't really go out that much."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,NerdyNeet23,3,Mon Jul 20 18:41:10 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming not wanting to sit across from someone and look straight at them is an Autism Spectrum Disorder thing (although maybe that's not being fair to people on the spectrum—I'm not an expert).  When I was trying to date, I figured out pretty quickly to suggest that at least part of the date be something (like a walk) that didn't involve staring at each other. But there's still usually going to be a component (like dinner) where you'll be seated at a table, and in my experience people do expect to be seated across from you.  My good friends are all used to my sitting adjacent to them rather than across from them by now, though. Some of them thought it was weird at first, haha, but they eventually learned that my way is better. ;)"
ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,AdventuresInSolitude,2,Mon Jul 20 18:46:15 2015 UTC,"I think the best kinds of dates are active ones like going for a walk, or bowling for example.

ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,splek,9,Mon Jul 20 20:35:51 2015 UTC,Personally I feel like you could hardly call it dating. Chatting? An interview maybe? But it's not dating.

ForeverAloneWomen,3dynlk,Rocksteady717,4,Tue Jul 21 00:18:31 2015 UTC,"I think I get what LurkLurkleton is getting at (feel free to correct me if I'm off). I would argue that being physically present with someone is an important component of a date...or any human interaction for that matter. A lot of communication and meaning is in body language. That could be observed through webcam, but it's no where near the same as two people being near each other in person.   A ""date"" also almost always implies some kind of activity. A ""movie date,"" a ""coffee date"" etc. That reveals that the actual environment and activity being done is a vital part of the date as well. On Skype, that type of context doesn't really exist. That's why in my other post in this topic I mentioned that I wouldn't be able to handle this kind of ""Skype date"" because it would almost feel like an intense one-on-one interview, especially without being able to distract or focus on things in the environment/activity. Meeting someone for coffee involves physical presence, the option of physical interaction, interacting with the environment, it's a lot more dynamic than two people on cam with each other. There in are the differences, which are pretty major.    But perhaps the concept of a ""date"" is subjective. In that case, as long as both the people involved TREAT the social interaction as a date, then it's fine.   Upon thinking about it more, ""date"" really is an abstract term created by society. Therefore, I guess this whole thing really is a moot discussion as it's up to the individual to decide what a date means to them. For a lot of people, physical interaction (or at least the potential of it) IS an important part of a date, but that is not the same for everyone.   Jesus. I've spent more time thinking about the philosophy of the term ""date"" than actually planning dates."

ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,GreenSkyFish,4,Sun Jul 19 20:53:20 2015 UTC,"No. It's kind of difficult for me too, as I feel that society has this notion that men should be more confident and comfortable with physical intimacy/their bodies than women. When you watch movies, it's usually the female characters that experience insecurity in regards to their bodies rather than males. Though this is a pattern that I see is changing, with the ""insecurity"" catching up to men as well which may be a larger reflection of a culture that is placing more emphasis on physical appearance.  I am pretty insecure about my body (despite how others feel about it). I do however really like my face!"
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,coralya,2,Sun Jul 19 23:42:31 2015 UTC,"I have noticed that a lot of men seem insecure about their physique. But the social culture of it is probably different than with women. Women put each other down, of course, but in good female friendships, there is a lot of mutual propping each other up and saying ""girl, you are gorgeous just the way you are."" I tell all of my good women friends how attractive they are on a regular basis. I doubt that happens in male friendships. That's difficult."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,GreenSkyFish,2,Mon Jul 20 19:44:55 2015 UTC,"Hah, you are absolutely correct. Jeez, I have to watch myself here because this could easily turn into one of my essay-esque discussions/rants.   Men definitely do not compliment each other on physical qualities on a regular basis, or at least no where NEAR the scope that women do. It's something I continuously realize as most of my coworkers/classmates in my field are female. ""Your hair looks great today; I love your shoes; that top is really cute"" etc.   With my male friends, I'll be lucky if they notice that I've cut my hair (usually a week after the fact).   Then I wonder why that gender difference seems to exist. Which brings us back to the ""social culture"" you mentioned; women have traditionally been valued for physical qualities, whereas men have been judged based on accomplishment and skills.   A second big part of that, is that women in general seem to be more supportive to their peers. While I don't have access to any evidence to back this up, I am positive there has been research in this. Women have been found to perform better in terms of emotional intelligence compared to men, for example.   Men do not get this kind of positive reinforcement on their PHYSICAL characteristics as women are more likely to receive. But in a culture that places emphasis on physical characteristics, that can have adverse psychological consequences.   To that end, I try to compliment my male friends more, and they always seem to really appreciate it. I think this whole issue was once beautifully summarized in a topic on AskMen asking about how often men get physically complimented.  This one user posted: ""If a girl told me she liked my shirt...I would wear that for the rest of the year.""    Haha."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,coralya,3,Mon Jul 20 19:56:35 2015 UTC,"Well, all your shirts are great, /u/greenskyfish! But you don't need me to tell you that, you obviously know what you're doing, haha.  Admittedly, it's rare that I would compliment a man (other than my father or brother) that way offline, for fear that it would sound like I was hitting on him. Good on you for trying to prop up your male friends more. Hopefully they respond in kind and you'll have succeeded at changing the culture at least within your particular bubble."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,CuredByCupcakes,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:07:03 2015 UTC,"One thing I've noticed is that it's harder to compliment men on physical qualities as frequently because they seem to have fewer variations in clothing, shoes, hairstyles, and accessories. Most men also don't wear makeup so that category gets thrown out completely. It's hard to compliment a man when the only difference in his appearance is that he's wearing a dark blue button-down one day and an almost identical grey one the next."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,GreenSkyFish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:47:26 2015 UTC,"It's kind of a catch 22 isn't it?   Men aren't likely to receive compliments since they'll dress similarly most of the time. Men aren't likely to change up their wardrobe or care too much, since they don't receive compliments anyway.  Though I do agree not having access to the same amount of options is a shame. Once again...that reflects a culture of gender norms."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,CuredByCupcakes,1 point,Tue Jul 21 15:52:59 2015 UTC,"I can't say compliments are what triggers me to dress a certain way, but that probably comes down to whether someone responds more to positive or negative reinforcement. I think men probably receive less of each type of reinforcement in regards to their appearance so either way they aren't as motivated."

ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,chaosakita,3,Mon Jul 20 05:40:50 2015 UTC,"No. As much as I wish I could say I find my body sexy, I do not. I kind of have a lot of hangups about it. I was overweight as a kid, and back then it seemed like I was the only overweight kid at my school. I hated that, and I started to hate my body. I even had an adult woman comment to me about how I had ""big thighs"" for my age (who says that to an 8 year old anyway?!). I feel like I never grew out of being that kid. The stupid part is, when I see old pictures, I don't even think I was that overweight. But almost 20 years later, I still feel like an awkward fat kid."

I want so badly for my body to be sexy but it feels so terribly proportioned and no amount of exercising has seemed to have fixed the way I carry my weight.  I'm pear-shaped so all my weight is in my legs (which I absolutely detest). I can't seem to lose weight in my calves no matter how hard I try they look bulky and disgusting (they look almost the same size looking as my thighs...ugh). However, my upper body is pretty petite but that also means I have little/no chest and no ass to boot.  Basically nothing going for me here. Look at me one way and I might seem petite, look at me another way and I seem fat. I hate the way this looks. I still go to the gym twice a week but need so much more discipline with my eating habits. I ate terribly today and I feel awful about it. Not a good body image day today for sure. :/"

So I try to keep a healthy mental distance from all of it. Not that I succeed, of course."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dvbng,innocent1234,2,Sun Jul 19 23:36:42 2015 UTC,"One of the reasons I just stick with my own opinion is that, aside from not knowing the motivation behind the insult/compliment, they aren't even consistent. Some people like my hair short and straight and hate it long and wavy. Other people are the opposite. I can be too thin, just right and too fat in one day. Who am I supposed to be listening to? If the peanut gallery was in some sort of agreement, I'd consider listening to them."

I believe the only types of people who do this are those who are so insecure about themselves that they have to take it out on others. While I am very insecure about myself I would never shame a person about something so personal as weight.

Before I could go months without thinking about being alone (which is good to some extent, but when years slip by...)  Finally attending to my health.  Trying to take 30 min walks every day (I started doing this the last week of June).  Sort of building muscle with some exercises, but being pretty lazy about that.  Related, I have finally, finally, finally decided to stop eating pasta every day.  I've decided to replace it with eggs and maybe oatmeal (not at the same time, lol).  See if that makes me healthier.  I've also found high-protein, low-sugar milk, so I'm using that.  Also, have gotten pro-biotics.  We'll see if that does anything.  Hopefully all this will change me from somewhat skinny fat to just plain skinny-ish.    Finally, I have decided to see if I can convince my crush to play games with me online.

Looking at dating profiles is a painful experience for me because the only thing I get out of it is that ""my type"" is very unusual.  EDIT: Oh, what the hell, I'll just put the whole list, edited for personally identifying stuff:  Physical:    Grow a beard. (Already done. I think it was a great improvement. I can't quite explain it, but I always used to think I looked like a stupid person. Now I look like a smart person. I'm so much happier looking in the mirror now.) Find a haircut that does the same thing for the top half of my head as the beard did for the bottom half. Find some shirts that lie a little more towards the ""attractive"" part of the comfort-attractiveness space. Figure out a routine that lets me get enough sleep so my eyelids don't droop. (Right now I keep waking up earlier than I planned to in the mornings.) Get into better shape (and stay there). This isn't just a FA thing. I don't want to have a heart attack at 50. Right now I'm at a decent weight and strength, but my endurance is absolutely pathetic.   Social:   Increase my patience with social situations. I need to increase the length of time I can interact with larger groups of people before I want to go home. Work on how I present myself. I think I talk a bit too much about myself. (Can you tell???) I should also be more willing to participate, to a limited extent, in conversations on topics I don't know as much about. Change my schedule to allocate a bit more time to social activities. I can always dial it back if I burn out. Improve my approach to the initial conversation with a stranger. It's not awful, but it could use some work, as it's a little bit too ""fake"" right now.   Dating (offline):   Ask out people who I meet and am interested in. (So far: empty set.)   Dating (online):   Get a few really good photographs taken. There are two excellent photographers in my immediate family, so I have no excuse to have weak profile pictures. (Right now I have no photos of myself.) Make an online dating profile and get it reviewed by someone who understands who I'm looking for and how I'm trying to present myself. Figure out how to write the first message. It's very obvious that 99% of people do not have the slightest clue how to do this, so it's the low-hanging fruit of the online dating world. Unfortunately, I'm in the 99%. Find people I am interested in. [The hard part!] Don't chicken out.   Other:   Clean up my place so I don't have to be embarrassed to show it to someone else. Granted, most of my friends are messier and they are in relationships, but why not?"

Even if I'm not an incredibly attractive or interesting person, I have to think that if I made other people feel incredible about themselves, was super-interested the people around me and exuded a sense of believing the world and other people are fantastic, more people would probably be interested in me, whether it's for romance or friendship or anything else."

I'm financially independent, but I'd like to be even more secure, especially since having a partner is a big advantage I won't have. I'm seeing a dermatologist and working on my skin...this is a lifelong battle for me. It's not perfect but at least now I can go outside without having little kids pointing and telling their moms. I'm kind of doing the opposite of the OP, trying to accept that I'll be FA and I'll probably never date again. It's really sad to think that I'll never have a partner again and scary to think about what the consequences will be as I age. I need to figure out ways to deal with all those things and accept them. I'm also working on hobbies and getting better at them. This doesn't help me become non-FA since I'm sure nobody else cares, but hopefully it helps me as a person.

But just because I'm FA doesn't mean that I have to be the poster-girl for FAness.    Step #1: Being open and honest about my problems. My problems aren't any worse than anyone else's. They're not shameful, they're not moral failings, and the first step to getting better is to realize that I am just as worthy of being on this flaming little rock as anybody else. Step #2: I dropped over 100lbs. I ate my pain for a lot of years, I think I was just trying to find a way to become invisible, maybe it was all the bad times spilling over where everyone can see it. I don't know. But I wasn't happy with it so I started working on it. I still have another 100+ to go, but fuck it. What else am I doing with my time? Step #3: Pursuing my dreams. Yes, maybe I'm weird and I'll never find the person that I click with and skip away into the sunset with... but that's okay. You don't have to have a significant other to be successful, to achieve something in this life. I think I used my FAness as an excuse for so many years not to do anything. The last year I've worked on a dozen games and with a bunch of different companies. It's been scary but the more positive experiences I have, the better I feel about myself. Step #4: Understanding that while I'm lonely, I'm not thirsty for a relationship right now. Until i get myself into a better place mentally I'm not going to try and date anybody, because the last few relationships I've had were just with emotionally unavailable people and it didn't go well.    I've always been pretty social, I'm fortunate that way. I think being able to be open about things with everyone though and not treat it as a big bad secret has been the key to opening up and building new friendships."

I'm not overweight, but not in my ideal shape either.  • Dressing better. I'm stepping out of my confort zone by wearing more than monochromatic outfits. Also, properly fitting clothes make a such big difference.  • Getting braces! I didn't wanted them when I was younger and oh boy, that was a mistake. I don't know if they'll aggravate my FA status, but I don't care. I'll have nice teeth in a couple of years and that's all that matters for now. They'll look better than my current crooked teeth anyways.  • Learning how to do my makeup and hair. Youtube tutorials are really helpful if you're new to this like me.  On the other side, I'm trying to be less of a homebody and going out of the house more often."

ForeverAloneWomen,3dlzny,uh-okay-I-guess,9,Fri Jul 17 16:49:18 2015 UTC,"I think this is a difficult question to answer without touching one of the ""third rails"" of this sub. So I'm just going to go ahead and do that, and hope that the power is switched off.  This is a public forum in which we share very private stuff. I've shared things here that I've never told anyone else, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. It's really easy to do that because most of the regulars are nice, trustworthy people and I have a lot in common with many of you.  But... it's a public forum. Anyone with a reddit account -- you know, the site that is increasingly famous for some really awful shit -- is free to post here. Anyone with an Internet connection is free to read. So some people are here for the wrong reasons. And some people are presumably here for the right reasons, but still make a subset of people uncomfortable because of how they act, or even just because of their gender. (I'm acutely aware that I'm in the latter group for many of you, and I wish there was something I could do to fix that, but there really isn't.)  Like most people, I rely largely on post history to tell if someone is good or bad. I think it's fairly accurate and sensitive. But at the same time, there's the uncomfortable fact that even if I find out that someone is bad, I can't do much about it. They can be banned but they can still read. Or even make a fresh account and start posting again, this time using a deceptive post history.  I think our only line of defense against these people is to make ourselves a really low-value target. You can't make them go away, but you can bore them to death. ""No pictures"" goes a long way towards that, as does ""no dating threads.""  For the same reason, banning or heavily restricting surveys would help too. Personally, I would be comfortable answering a survey if the results were held by someone I trust. However, having the individual answers -- or maybe even the aggregate results -- visible on a Reddit thread seems like a bad idea."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dlzny,chaosakita,-1,Fri Jul 17 16:12:20 2015 UTC,Why does it seem like a bad idea?
ForeverAloneWomen,3dlzny,uh-okay-I-guess,5,Fri Jul 17 17:46:40 2015 UTC,"I think aggregate data is interesting to people with an agenda and would attract them.  In addition, individual survey responses are interesting to those fishing for personal data.  Again, I think there's nothing inherently wrong with surveys (people are generally smart enough to keep their personal information safe), but they may cause more harm than good if they act as ""bait"" for undesirable people."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dlzny,-lost-at-sea-,4,Sat Jul 18 02:28:11 2015 UTC,"I didn't find the recent survey thread invasive, because nobody made me post. It did give me pause because I didn't recognize the poster and because the poster didn't share their own information first. Because my posting on this sub is sensitive to me, I always try to be cognizant of what I'm actually posting on, and what I'm sharing. If I don't recognize a name, or if it's somebody who is posting in a way that's typical of a non-FA telling us ""how things work,"" so to speak, I always look at the poster and try to learn more about them before I participate or respond.   I didn't participate in the survey thread because I personally don't feel comfortable putting a ton of potentially personally identifying facts in one single post. That doesn't mean that others shouldn't feel comfortable doing so. If the survey had been linked to an anonymous, survey-type website I might have participated. I think the information might be interesting. If there are several FAW from the same region, for example, then perhaps those posters might find that interesting.  I trust the mods here and I think the mod team does a good job. I understand that we have a lot of younger posters here, as well as posters who are more emotional and more likely to pour out their souls. It's understandable and just comes with being FA. There are certain things that I can understand banning outright, like picture threads and dating threads. Those things just open up the whole ""why are you FA????"" attack. But I personally wouldn't like to see surveys banned in their entirety. Perhaps the team could just give strong warnings/reminders that anything a poster puts on the internet is out there for all to see.  Or require that all surveys be conducted via a link to a survey/polling website. It's the mod team's decision, and regardless of the decision, I'll keep posting here because I like the community."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dlzny,uh-okay-I-guess,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:32:24 2015 UTC,"the poster didn't share their own information first.   This also seems important to me. Answering your own question is a pretty minimal gesture, but to some extent it indicates a willingness to be part of the community, that you're not just an anthropologist or something worse.  Of course, some questions answer themselves in the asking (e.g. ""Does anyone else...?""), but the questions in this particular survey were not like that.  EDIT: I wouldn't want to make it a rule that you have to answer your own question, though. It's just an indicator of sincerity; mandating it would not have much benefit and would destroy its value as an indicator."

ForeverAloneWomen,3dlzny,GreenSkyFish,4,Sat Jul 18 07:36:49 2015 UTC,"Here are my thoughts. In THEORY, freedom of speech/expression should be the main rule. No one is forced to participate in those threads, but those that WISH to participate can. I recognize that some users might feel uncomfortable/creeped out by that kind of thread. However, isn't that more THEIR problem? They can simply opt to not participate. If others are not bothered by it and wish to participate, then it would be uncouth to disallow those kinds of topics all together. It's odd that use the term ""invasive"" in your post, because people are voluntarily deciding to participate and even the author of that thread stated that people should feel free to answer only if they felt comfortable (and whatever questions they chose to answer).  Having said ALL that, I did find the thread a little creepy because it wasn't a reg around here. The way he/she said it was for their own curiosity was creepy as well.  I would much prefer the moderators or a reg to make that kind of thread, and I think it could provide very useful and interesting community data about the sub. I remember chaosakita did one a while ago and there was nothing wrong with it.  It's your call, mod team. But there IS a fine line between protecting the users and infringing upon peoples' right to freedom of speech/expression."

One of my friends is disabled, and she occasionally complains about the romantic problems it causes. It's pretty heartbreaking to hear to be honest. I'm pretty sure if she hadn't got ill she'd not be alone.  This is probably advice you've already heard, and I apologise if it is, but if you are kind of out in the sticks you could move to a much larger city. The friend I mentioned above is doing this, for work really, but she's said one of the benefits will be meeting other disabled people to do stuff, as at the moment they get left out a fair bit. There's some kind of activity group where I live at the  moment, but I know she doesn't like them, and it's the only one going.  Hopefully they'll be some more options in Berlin.  It's kinda shitty to suggest you focus on socializing with/finding a partner amongst people who are also disabled, but it's probably best from a pragmatic perspective. It's not much comfort, but I'd have thought a very large fraction of disabled people face the situation your in, so they might have good advice if nothing else. Sorry if you've already thought about/tried all this.  To respond to the question; by most standards I had fairly horrible childhood and spent a good chunk of my teenage years in and out of mental hospitals. Even now I can still tell that other people can tell I'm not right. There's a decent chance this wouldn't be the case if I'd had a better upbringing, but it seems silly for me to blame anyone other than myself for my situation. It's not that I go into a great decline about how it's all my fault, it's more that I think it's way to complex to blame any thing or set of things in particular. Regardless, finding fault in anything other than my own actions won't help me to fix the situation, and that's all I care about."

Trying to overcome these things on my own is hard but I am really trying (ie. not worrying about things I can't change, finding time to relax and calm down, pushing harmful memories out of my mind).  The attraction thing is hard because somehow I've become a picky person even though I myself am no prize and I know this. It's not even the physical part that I'm picky about--it's the personality that I'm super picky about.

What I can tell you is that I have, in fact, had the misfortune to fall for numerous guys who ended up going after other girls before I even had the chance to reveal how I felt about them. That or I find out that the entire time they'd had a girlfriend. I just didn't know about her. Until after I'd fallen for the guy. Of course.  The worst was the guy I've mentioned several times on here. I tried my darndest just to talk to this guy (who was single at the time!), but somehow we always ended up just missing each other every single time. It drove me nuts. I'd show up and hear that he'd literally just been there and left or I'd leave, come back another day and hear that he showed up for a little bit just after I'd left.

And if I had done those things, then I'd be able to socialize a lot easier, which means that I'd be able to handle having a romantic relationship.

So if I failed a test, I didn't deserve to sleep in a bed, I should sleep on the floor.  Back then I used to be overweight and I thought I didn't deserve friends, love or food, so I didn't do any socializing even though I was invited to events because I wasn't good enough.

Environment:  Was an immigrant (the only foreign kid in my classes growing up) so I was naturally an outsider growing up  Poor socialization because my parents had to work so much when I was growing up so they didn't really pay much attention to me. I spent much of my childhood alone playing with myself.  Physical/emotional abuse during my childhood from my overworked parents  Grew up in poverty  Was raised with an unhealthy diet so I was fat throughout middle school/high school Parents had the standard immigrant ""us against the world mentaility"" and raised me to distrust people.

I have been guilty of this and it was plain old jealousy on my part.  Not so much saying someone can't be forever alone and more along the lines of ""you are physically fit, attractive and successful in your endeavors - you don't get to have this misery.""  It was a low point of my life and I felt like I ONLY had my misery. This other person had everything that I didn't and they were going to take my misery on top of it all. It was too much.

I'm kind of torn between thinking everyone saying I look good is just being nice and that maybe they are telling the truth and I've just had very, very bad luck instead.  Or both. Maybe it's both.

ForeverAloneWomen,3dio60,thekittydog,2,Fri Jul 17 05:38:29 2015 UTC,"Ha, yeah.   I think people are inclined to say nice things so I don't put stock in what someone says regarding my attractiveness unless they want to date me.    It probably is a sociological myth that there is someone for everyone just the way that it is sort of assumed that everyone wants or should have children.   I really wouldn't bother me so much if I had friends. If I had really close girlfriends to share things with I think I could handle never having a relationship better.

I recently bought a new camera, and the (much older) male sales associate told me about how the camera store hosted an all-day, free photography class for new buyers. He told me that the class was open to customers and one guest, and how I could ""take my boyfriend"" and make a date out of it. I've also been in situations where I've gone out with new friends and someone has said, ""you should bring your boyfriend next time!"" Makes me want to LOL.  I'm very rarely approached by men. One of my problems is that I don't approach men myself quite enough. I'm convinced that maybe that's my problem more than looks or personality, or whatever the ""problem"" is.

ForeverAloneWomen,3dio60,FAWinner,11,Thu Jul 16 20:48:50 2015 UTC,"Looks are one of the reasons most people in the FA mindset can justify being FA and wanting to stay there. Seeing an attractive person in the same mindset kind of sets this off in conjunction with an ""I'm more FA than you because I have it worse.""  It's shitty and generally human nature. Sorry you go through that even in your own FA community or like minded people because they feel like their entitled to their pity, and your troubles are automatically lesser than theirs. I hope your depression and SA clear up eventually."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dio60,I_LIKE_YOU_,7,Thu Jul 16 16:19:23 2015 UTC,"and wanting to stay there   less of a want really, more of the impossible odds crushing down on you like hull of an ocean liner weighed down by and overloa it being extremely hard to fix, the consensus (at least at /r/FA) is that it'd be easier for one to escape if one were attractive.  also the whole loneliness thing has always been a huge dick comparison contest (pardon the phrase) the bullying alleviates the pain a little for bullies so that's why they enjoy it, take the enviable down a peg etc."
ForeverAloneWomen,3dio60,lonesomeloser234,12,Thu Jul 16 17:28:27 2015 UTC,"I feel the same. I've had guys and even girls interested in me in the past, but if you can't flirt, don't understand their signs of attraction and are too shy/withdrawn it doesn't matter how cute or pretty you are, people lose patience and move on. Or they read YOU as not being interested and move on.  So what if I can get someone to turn their head and look at me, even talk to me sometimes, if I can't open up to them, if I can't even feel comfortable around them, they'll eventually turn away from me. They always do. And THAT hurts more I think. Knowing it's not your appearance, which is so easy to change, but your personality that turns people off. THAT is scary shit. How do you change who you are INSIDE? When someone shows an interest in me and then rejects me later on, that shit messes me up. It just reaffirms that I'll always be a victim of my anxiety, and depression. Why should I like who I am when others don't?  Bottom line: Don't assume the grass is greener on the other side, I'd rather have an open/contagious beautiful personality and an 'ugly' appearance than be 'attractive' and have people reject/ignore me over and over after interacting with me for awhile."

I'm not a model by any means, but I am thin, have decent facial features, and know how to apply makeup and wear flattering clothes. People generally react positively to my appearance.   But I've dealt with depression and anxiety my whole life too. Things that come so easily to other women, from finding a boyfriend to just knowing what to talk about, are hard for me. There's a theory that femininity is an act, not an innate thing, and I feel like I've never learned how to properly act like a ""woman.""  I understand how less attractive FAs think we have it better, though. Everyone is judged by their appearance, but women are judged especially harshly. The thing is, I see people in relationships who are overweight and have unattractive features, so appearance isn't a dealbreaker in many cases. Being ugly can't make you FA, but it can certainly help."

They get infatuated, throw themselves headlong into the relationship regardless of compatibility, and don't really have the experience or maturity to know what to do once the warm fuzzies wear off.  And that's fine if they're just looking for a fling, but I never was.

What do you define as ""magic""? I'd argue that first loves are more magical than any love you'll have after.

You can finally relate to those incredibly stupid love songs you've been hearing forever. Even if it doesn't end up being the relationship that will last, you still learn what it's like to be a part of an intimate, private little world that two people can build.  After your first relationship, of course the feelings won't be necessarily new, but there's still a magic to experience because you'll be experiencing these feelings in different ways and creating different little worlds depending on the person you're with next.  Re: Purity  Sharing physical intimacy with someone has always been something I viewed with a certain amount of severity, too. When I let my guard down, I grow very easily attached, so I've never seen myself as being able to partake in the hook-up culture that seems to be so prevalent today. There was no way I wanted my first time to be from a one-night stand. I waited (I was half-way EDIT: 3/4 through college before I lost my virginity), and waiting is perfectly fine. I'd only argue that once you're in a relationship where you feel reasonably committed and emotionally open (I promise there are guys who want such a relationship), then the stakes behind being physically intimate with someone go way down.   TL;DR I guess my opinion is that there's nothing to be ashamed of in taking the idea of being in an intimate relationship seriously, but excessive pessimism about firsts will only hurt you in the long run."

Despite nothing coming of that, I make stories out of my experiences and at least have those to laugh about. It makes me feel less of a loser even if I'm not getting much attention or dates.

And then because of her, my grandpa started thinking it and, well, he's a grandpa. My mom had a long talk with him, let's just say that. I still sort of suspect that he suspects that I'm a lesbian. What can you do.  Nobody else has asked me, but I always wonder if my coworkers also think that since I never mention boyfriends and they've known me a while now. I talk about guys I like or what I think is attractive in a guy and even though I live in a place where LGBT people are fairly well accepted, I still think they think I'm just pretending to be straight.

I would just say something like ""no boyfriend, just focusing on myself/finding myself at the moment :)"" because it's easy for other people to come up with a response, like ""wow cool, you go girl!"" and continue from there.  In many cases, people aren't actually judging, they don't genuinely care because they're just trying to keep up civil small-talk, and if you give them any response which doesn't immediately keep the conversation going in the general direction they planned, when they say shit like ""oh..."" it's not ""oh...you don't have a boyfriend ugh how weird"" it's just ""oh...yeah, i don't know how you want me to respond to that uhh...""

I hate the guessing game so much. It's the worst. But so far I've always been too chicken to move beyond it.  Intellectually, I know that if the answer is ""no,"" then it's ""no,"" whether I ask or not. And if the answer is ""yes,"" I would be much happier to know that, obviously*.  So why does trying to find out still feel so much like jumping off a cliff?  To some extent, I'm terrified that I will be ludicrously off-base to even suggest the idea that someone might be interested in me, that as a result they will be offended or hurt or think I'm pathetic, and then there will be awkwardness every time I encounter them. But I don't have enough experience to know whether this scenario is even realistic. :/  *Or is it obvious?"

It's kind of a weird situation—this is someone who was interested in me years ago, and at the time, I definitely wasn't interested. But really, I barely know him. I ended up having a long conversation with him last week, and it struck me that I didn't know him well enough, then or now, to know whether I'm interested.  The rational thing to do in this kind of situation is just get to know the person and not worry about it. But I'm not very good at that. My brain leaps right to ""what if I'm leading him on, I do NOT want to be that person"" and ""what if I end up dating him and it goes terribly because my dating someone is always bound to go terribly"" and ""aren't I supposed to be given up on dating, anyway, why am I even thinking about this???"""

Regarding someone who's attracted to me physically and personality-wise -- I don't know if anyone's ever been attracted to my personality for a long period of time. The one time it happened, I kind of felt like I was a mystery he was trying to unravel. It makes me sick to think about it, because even if he thought I was fun to be around initially, he clearly thought I was disposable after a while. It makes you feel like literal trash.

When someone is attracted to you, you can forget about all the bad things people have said to you or you've thought (I'm ugly, lazy, stupid etc) and just accept that it isn't true because no one would be attracted to you. Especially if this guy means a lot to you or is excellent in some significant way.  Basically, a big confidence boost.   2.Apathy / pity   This is like when some guy or girl totally off your radar is interested in you. It's not exciting and doesn't make you feel special. Some girls will play into this for kicks or lead a guy on to ""make him feel better.""   3.Disgust  Self explanatory. This is how it feels when much older people or people just way out of orbit are showing obvious sexual interest in you.

You have every right to share your feelings and vent here, but don't just do that. When you can be calm again, talk to your roommate (in person, not on FB) and remind her what you've done and how it makes you feel when she is rude to you. Say you would have appreciated it if she had told you in person rather than making a snide comment on the web. And don't forget to remind them of some of the things you've done to help out!  You probably won't see immediate results -- it takes time. But if you always address these issues head-on, you'll find that they happen less and less often as you develop confident and assertive habits."

It might be slightly annoying but at least there will be a person who can handle the situation more objectively.

Studies have shown that volunteering not only increases altruistic behavior, but it's also associated with improved happiness, self-esteem, and you could even meet people out of it.   I don't think you're a bad person at all. The fact that you included the term ""immoral"" in your title tells me that you experience at least some guilt in doing these things. If you were truly a bad person and that's all you were, you wouldn't feel guilty.   It's funny that in your title, you kind of allude to the fact that shoplifting/taking advantage of others is almost a coping mechanism for you. There definitely IS an endorphin rush to shoplifting, it's probably similar to one you'd get by jogging a mile.   All I want you to do...is be consider the possibility of trying out some other coping methods. It could be something like volunteering 1 day a week somewhere, it could be going for a jog and exercising every time you feel an urge to shoplift. You don't have to strictly follow it...but maybe just give yourself a 1 month ""sobriety trial"" from any shoplifting, and instead do other things. After a month, depending on how you felt about all of it, you can decide which method of coping you prefer."

Because I don't really have a problem. There are worse cruelties that our society perpetuates and that law-abiding citizens knowingly and unknowingly participate in.  One person ITT mentioned H&M. I mean, take a look at that name. It's a multinational company worth billions of dollars. They have absolutely the worst human rights agenda, I don't want to start in detail. This isn't exactly your mom-and-pop ""handsewn-with-love"" boutique.  EDIT: I guess it stems down to whether or not your decision to lift, let's say $100 of merchandise/week really has any significant impact on the lives of the employees. If you had that knowledge then through a utilitarianist lens (total ""good"" vs total ""bad) I'd say you could determine whether it was right/wrong.  Otherwise, I can't be damned to give a shit. Society also teaches us to look down upon or ignore the plight of the homeless, who are innocent by definition (""Get a job! They're all drug addicts and ex-felons anyways!""), so why should we blindly castigate the occasional corporate thief? Both parties, unless proven otherwise, fail to produce noticeable societal harm. Both parties are neither malignant nor indecent.  Another way to look at it is through magnitude/proportionality. If you steal an apple from Safeway, that could be undoubtedly proven as ""morally neutral"" because it has 0 negative impact and creates no amount of pain. 100 dollars, no even 1000 dollars a week is like an apple in a supermarket for corporations like H&M. This is of course, assuming that the employees are not disproportionately punished."

But generally speaking, does the occasional shoplifter's actions really have a huge detrimental effect on the life of a retail worker? It's a matter of proportionality, not simply black or white.  Also, on a tangent, does the amount of litigation and punitive law written against shoplifters (not to mention the obvious stigma that can be witnessed ITT) proportionally match the seriousness of the crime? I've seen peoples lives get ruined over frivolous amounts of stolen goods. Do shoplifting laws and the social stigma against shoplifters serve to protect the blue-collar retail workers or do they instead serve to protect the multinational hegemons who reign over our consumerist society?  Yes I realize that I am full-armchair-philosophizing at this point. Please, someone put me in my place."

Being in a relationship obviously has its advantages as well, otherwise people wouldn't do it.

When I had more male friends, I would see how live, and sometimes it was downright squalorous. I don't want any part of that, nor do I want to be relied upon.

ForeverAloneWomen,3cutqk,NobodyFeelsAnyPain,10,Fri Jul 10 23:22:59 2015 UTC,"Yes, all the time!   When I was in therapy my therapist called this a ""cognitive loop"", basically when you had negative or hard-to-control thoughts going on repeat through your brain, driving yourself nuts because you can't turn it off. The good news is that you can totally stop cognitive loops! You just have to learn how.  Do you have answers for these questions? Have you ever written them down on a piece of paper or in a journal so they're outside your head? Writing these kinds of things down and watching your answers change over time can help you understand the difference between having a bad day and having something that you need help with.  Here's how I answer similar questions in my head (remember, once you complete those trains of thought they can't keep zipping around in your head!) when they pop up. You learn to transform negative thought trains into something that doesn't destroy you when you're in the middle of a bad time.   Do you have a boyfriend? No.  Why don't you have a boyfriend? Because I'm putting myself first in my life right now. Until I am happier with myself, I won't be able to be happy with anyone else. I may never find a lasting, meaningful relationship that I want, but I can have a better relationship with myself. Why are you so quiet? Sometimes I just don't have anything to say or to talk about. Some people may not like this, and that's okay. They're allowed to be as noisy as they want and I can be as quiet as I like! Why are you so weird? I can't be anybody but who I am right now. I'm not the person I was yesterday/not the person when that embarrassing thing happened/not the person when that bad thing happened. I am just me, and that's okay. Why can't you be normal? This IS normal, for me, right now. This may change, this may not. I don't have control over what has made me the person I am today, but I CAN control how I respond and react from here on out. Why do you like such weird things? Because X, Y and Z are just that damn awesome! What's wrong with you? There are many things that I would like to change about myself. If something is ""wrong"", it is something I can fix. If I can't fix it, that means that I need to find help and get the tools I need to fix it. If that still doesn't work, I may need to accept that it's not fixable, and if it's not fixable, it may not be wrong, just different.   The more you do exercises like these, the more you can start changing the way you think about yourself, the people in your life and the world around you. It can be quite terrible honestly (some of those negative cognition worksheets you'll find on Google will make you burst out crying, for real), but you owe it to yourself to gain a better and broader understanding of who you really are, what you can do for yourself and what you need to be happy in this life. hugs You stay strong my friend!"

ForeverAloneWomen,3cutqk,dododod0,2,Sat Jul 11 09:40:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like someone else always brings them up first. I don't want a romantic relationship--the way I am right now, I wouldn't know what to do with one. I have a few close real-life friends and some not-so-close ones. Contact is pretty sparse, but we get together every once in a while and the conversation starts right where we left off. I have a small group of internet friends, some of whom I've been talking to for over four years. I was fine missing friend gatherings, the gossip, the Eurotripping, fine sitting alone at lunch with a novel and fulfilling the majority of my interpersonal interactions over the internet.   Then I got into an argument with my mother and she yelled repeatedly, ""You have no friends! Where are your friends? You're going to end up alone."" Later she told me that in her temper she wanted to scare me into action. I don't think I'll be able to fully forgive her for how she said it. Maybe what I felt before was just complacence, there was no fear of being alone, no regular reminder that other people have loved ones to do XYZ with them, while I'm doing these activities by myself on my own little island. Research has shown that awareness can turn loneliness into a self-fulfilling prophecy, and those words felt like the beginning to mine.   ***although, to clarify, I don't believe I'm clinically depressed. I'm just used to keeping rather loosely-tied relationships, have done so all throughout middle and high school as my mother surely noticed, and to be repeatedly told during a really low point in my life that this is not okay was heartbreaking. In my case, I'll hopefully regain my confidence once I return to a more social daily routine in the upcoming months, but to you, OP, best of luck with your depression. I work in a healthcare setting and see every day the efforts some people must take to keep their spirits healthy."

ForeverAloneWomen,3cr24p,orangine,9,Fri Jul 10 02:19:49 2015 UTC,"I feel the same way. My sex drive was normal when I was a teenager, but now it is pretty much non-existent. I suspect that my hopelessness somehow turned it off. I find it difficult to fantasize about relationships and sex these days - it just seems so unimaginable to me.   I always deactivate my OkCupid on the same day that I activate it. There is a guy that I bookmarked on there a few months ago whose profile I look at from time to time, but I can never motivate myself to message him. It is like I don't even want to give myself a chance.  My low sex drive makes me afraid to try to pursue any type of relationship. Surely no one would want to date a girl who didn't want to have sex.

ForeverAloneWomen,3cr24p,Lonely4eva,1 point,Fri Jul 10 10:50:16 2015 UTC,"I masturbate/have sexual fantasies. What do you make of that?  Most asexuals are physically capable of sex. Some masturbate and some do not. Since masturbation produces a pleasurable sensation, many asexuals choose to use it to take pleasure from their bodies. Some asexuals can only arouse themselves manually (by applying friction to sexual organs), while others can turn themselves on with thought or even outside stimulus, such as pornography or erotic literature.  There is an important distinction between sexual and asexual people when it comes to masturbation: while some asexuals don't think about anything specifically sexual during masturbation, if they do think about other people or view pornography, these interpersonal interactions are only fantasy. If an asexual were actually given the opportunity to be sexual with the fantasized person(s), there would be no sexual attraction, or the attraction would be so low as to be completely ignorable.  Some masturbating asexuals do not have a sex drive motivating them; they just do it because it's nice or to relieve stress. Other asexuals masturbate because they have a personal sex drive (libido) that they wish to take care of privately; they may experience arousal as a biological response to outside stimulus and wish to relieve themselves of it without a desire for partnered sex. Still more, some asexuals may be considered autosexual; they are sexually attracted to themselves and as such take sexual pleasure from their own bodies. The common factor is that all asexuals, masturbating or not, have little or no sexual attraction to other people.  source: Aven"

I am more of a fantisizer who did masturbate constantly in my teen years, but I never actually was able to have that chance. Also, I dont really know if I am asexual because I do feel tingly down there when I see a man I like. So I guess I am not asexual, just FA."

ForeverAloneWomen,3cr24p,DeathMonkeyRobot,1 point,Fri Jul 10 11:57:02 2015 UTC,"Not sure what it's called.  It seems natural to look for a label of the phenomenon.  Really, your explanation tells the story most accurately.  I don't think that reality can ever match our fantasies.  That is so very true.  I think that asexuality, in some cases, might be a form of acceptance that we just aren't going to get any.  In terms of a psychological theory, if we can put a label on it, we reduce the anxiety about fulfilling any unmet sexual needs and desires, as well asexuality is another way to add meaning to ourselves -- to give us an identity."

One time in college, I was studying with a guy that I was taking Spanish with (he and I were the only two people in the class, since it was a special after-hours Spanish class that the teacher had organized for us), and we were making flashcards. I started writing things like ""I love you,"" ""I have a crush on you,"" and ""Will you go out with me?"" on my flash cards. I had a huge crush on this guy and that was the only way I could think of to let him know. He glanced over at my flashcards and then made some excuse about needing to go look at an apartment that he wanted to rent with a friend. Then he ran away so fast I could practically see the skid marks.  So I know that if I had a higher sex drive, I'd still be forever alone. I'm just socially retarded, to the point where I end up creeping people out."
ForeverAloneWomen,3cr24p,markesh0,0,Fri Jul 17 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"Check out http://www.asexuality.org/home/  I just started reading about this a year or two ago,  and figured out this asexuality was most of my issues in relationships for years.   They have a ton of good info there."
ForeverAloneWomen,3cquly,obtrudenomore,7,Fri Jul 10 01:15:32 2015 UTC,"Can it be called being taken advantage of if you go into it willingly? I struggle with the idea of FWB type relationships; part of me thinks I should try it just for experience, part of me thinks I deserve more. But just because I want love, does it mean that I shouldn't try to get experience?"
ForeverAloneWomen,3cquly,orangine,5,Fri Jul 10 02:28:37 2015 UTC,"I think the thing with fwb is that if you go into it just wanting the sex and experience, everything's great! But going into fwb if you are expecting more eventually (""i hope he or she falls in love with me after this""), or only doing it to keep someone as a friend/emotional support system, who wouldn't be otherwise there for you without sex, will only get you hurt and won't really fulfill the right needs or provide satisfaction. You can get experience aside from love, the problem is  if you can emotionally handle the two things being separate. You will need to be sure about true intentions like going in it only for sex vs. going in it for potential relationship.   ...or at least that's what I think, because I never had a relationship nor sex so I don't know much! hahaha"
ForeverAloneWomen,3cquly,kittyinmypocket,3,Fri Jul 10 08:05:09 2015 UTC,"I struggle with this too. lets just say there are two guys one i think i could of handled a FWB he was such a bad idea i was insanely attractive to him but really didn't like him as a human past a friend. the other one i love as a friend and i could see us working out more then just friends and fucking, i don't think i could handle a FWB with out falling hard for him.   I didn't take anyone on there offer and after i felt relived i didn't but at the same time the 2nd guy i'm hung up on, the first one as soon as he moved away he was a thank god i didn't.  I just tell my self i'm waiting till a commited relationship before having sex and i tell them that too and some guys are like oh if thats the case then yea maybe we could be more. and i'm like nope. a relationship shouldn't be an afterthought."
ForeverAloneWomen,3cquly,onelonelytossaway,2,Sat Jul 11 03:00:55 2015 UTC,Yeah I don't think I could handle a FWB relationship with a guy I could see as a boyfriend. So any FWB for me would have to find some flaw that would disqualify him so I don't end up mooning away. I'd probably still wish he had that quality though. This is all a hypothetical discussion on my part though.
ForeverAloneWomen,3cquly,orangine,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:01:07 2015 UTC,oh with me there are people i could take up for that offer but even with slight flaws i can over look and want more it has to be huge glaring flaws and pretty much my mind set would have to be use them cus they are using me but the moment we have anything of a normal friendship my brain goes down the i want a relationship lane.   Though i do have those types of guys around me i'm still forever alone cus i can just see it all ending badly so best not to start right?
ForeverAloneWomen,3cquly,onelonelytossaway,2,Sat Jul 11 23:10:13 2015 UTC,"when i think about it, i always imagine what i would think/how i would feel when i'm 90 and close to dying and whether or not i'd regret not taking a chance. ofc no one knows exactly how they will feel at the end of their lives, but i think i'd feel that chances not taken would weigh more heavily on me. plus, the thing with physical activities like sex is that they become easier, and you become better at them, the more often you practice. so i go into sexual activities with this mindset. no one yet has had an emotional connection with me on which the sexual aspect was built - all of my sexual experiences so far have been purely physical. but i'm still glad for them because what if they are the only chance i will ever have to know what a human body feels like against mine? i don't say that with any trace of self pity, but with a profound appreciation for sex itself. every time i hook up yes i feel a little sad because there's no feelings involved and i do want that. but at the same time, it's still being part of something larger than myself, for however short a time, and i find myself more and more grateful for these opportunities, like little gifts from the universe, like little seeds sown for reaping when i find the one with whom i will share my harvest :)"

A lot of guys aren't going to be turned on by a girl who's had sex with a new guy every other weekend for the last few years, but knowing what you like in bed (and being willing to voice it) and not having to be led by the hand and taught how to do basic sex techniques properly is a huge plus."

ForeverAloneWomen,3cojns,lonesomeloser234,2,Fri Jul 10 02:16:45 2015 UTC,"Well, you wouldn't want to be in a relationship with this guy, right? Or someone with his sense of humor?  That takes away some of the sting imo."
ForeverAloneWomen,3cojns,splek,2,Fri Jul 10 07:35:32 2015 UTC,"I was inclined to think it was the beggars who couldn't be choosers,  a sense of humor seems negatable in terms of a relationship … I think … maybe … not really sure now actually, you don't really learn this by watching people, I think that may be a hands-on thing"
ForeverAloneWomen,3cojns,lonesomeloser234,2,Fri Jul 10 11:54:09 2015 UTC,"You really do need a compatible sense of humor and communication styles to be successful in a relationship. Same thing goes for friendships - you probably wouldn't want to hang out with a friend that told really racist jokes all day that offended you, right? You wouldn't want to be intimate with someone that offended you either (unless that's what you're into!)"
ForeverAloneWomen,3cojns,terpin,4,Fri Jul 10 19:15:39 2015 UTC,"Maybe her jokes don't bother her boyfriend that much. If she really hated Indian people, would she date an Indian guy?

ForeverAloneWomen,3cojns,lnys,4,Thu Jul 9 19:34:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't get it either, she doesn't sound vile to me, she just sounds like someone with an odd sense of humour. Trust me, there are far worse people who are in relationships."
ForeverAloneWomen,3cojns,subarashiisekai,8,Thu Jul 9 20:04:21 2015 UTC,"Same. I find the joke that OP quoted very mild actually. Maybe it's cultural, but I make jokes that are far worse than that. She's making that joke with her Indian boyfriend, so clearly they're both fine with it. Someone actually racist wouldn't be with an Indian man or woman, but it seems that everyone is offended at everything on American boards or blogs, it's a bit ridiculous to me. As we say here, we can laugh at everything, but not with everyone. I wonder what kind of jokes are ok then; you shouldn't mention color, culture, sex, gender, looks, religion etc, so what's left? Stupid jokes about the weather or animals? And even then I'm sure you should be careful or not offending anyone who's a meteorologist or a pet lover.   When I was in uni with a girl in a wheelchair, I once made a joke about her being late, cause she must have been ""stuck in traffic"". Everyone around looked at me like OMG YOU MADE A JOKE ABOUT A HANDICAPPED PERSON GO ROT IN HELL YOU INCONSIDERATE SWINE, but that girl laughed - I was one of the only ones to make jokes about that exactly like I would of any other person's characteristics. Everyone tiptoed around her and didn't make any comments or jokes at her as if she was supposed to be a fucking saint on a pedestal cause you know, cue the pathetic face, she's in a wheelchair the poor thing. I didn't see things like this back then and I still don't. I knew she had a sense of humour about herself and her condition, and I despised the way everyone felt like she shouldn't be the butt of a good humoured joke because handicapped. And if I had a Black or an Asian boyfriend I sure would make jokes about racist stereotypes if he's fine with his ethnicity or culture.   Also, I tend to think that putting on a stern face and declaring something's offensive is the best way to make sure that the real racist or hateful jerks think they're edgy and so un-PC or something. If you want to get the real racists pissed off, laugh at their shit, don't label them as ""the ones that must not be named""."

He's got feelings and a sense of pride and dignity that he's got to look after too, just like she does. Can you really blame him for going cold after being rejected?"

ForeverAloneWomen,3cn6es,sadpegasaur,4,Fri Jul 10 02:23:43 2015 UTC,"I also agreed to a FWB situation with a guy I liked but who rejected me. I thought that if I stuck around long enough and showed him how much I ""loved"" him, he would change his mind and want to be with me.   Even though he said he cared about me and would sometimes chat with me for hours, he was pretty upfront about his overall disinterest, even if I didn't want to believe it.  If I were you I would let this guy go and try to avoid FWB. I know it is tempting to enter into these types of ""relationships"" because as FA people we wonder if we should take whatever we can get, but I think in the end these types of arrangements hurt us more than they help us.   I also think that the reason you might be hanging onto him is that you think if you had agreed to sex with him the first night, you would be dating. Maybe you blame yourself for ""ruining it."" I can guarantee that you did not do anything wrong and it wouldn't have made a difference if you did have sex that night. If he was ever really interested in you, there is no way he would have insulted you by saying he didn't like anything about you.   Please know that you deserve way better.

Just yesterday I decided to go to a social event at the office, but when I got there, I basically walked in the door, looked around, and immediately turned and walked out again -- not because I was anxious or shy or anything, but just because it seemed so pointless. If I talked to someone, I would make small talk about work, or the weather, or where they lived. I would learn nothing and reveal nothing. I would establish no deeper connection. I might make an acquaintance. I would not make a friend.  Then I came home and made this post. It's not earth-shattering or anything, but it reveals my real feelings in a way I would never dare say to anyone in person. Let's just say I would not have 10 upvotes if I said that at an office social.  Who do you think is easier to get to know -- the version of me who makes uncontroversial small talk, or the version who speaks from his heart? Who do you think would make the better friend?  As for you, you seem like a really nice and thoughtful person. I'm not from your country. If I traveled the world to meet every person whose posts I've read that I thought was worth meeting, I'd go broke. But if, instead, you did happen to live in the next house down the road, and wanted a visitor, I'd try to gather up the courage to go over and knock on the door."

ForeverAloneWomen,3cmx3b,CatAndTonic,3,Thu Jul 9 16:09:35 2015 UTC,I can relate. But for me it's probably because people don't see my hideous face online. People with no romantical or sexual interests whatsoever in you treat you differently based on your attractiveness.
ForeverAloneWomen,3cmx3b,zewifi,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:41:25 2015 UTC,"People have seen my hideous face, but still treat me decently (but who knows!) All platonic and people of different genders/ages.

ForeverAloneWomen,3cmx3b,NerdyNeet23,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:37:42 2015 UTC,"Then you're lucky in this respect I guess. I can't help the fact that I always feel like being assessed having less ""worth"" to other people compared to better looking folks. I'm just as much a human being as them. When refering to me people often act along the lines of ""oh... that guy..."". I have the impression that it is funny for them to ostracize me. Along the lines of: sb.: ""Everyone will eventually find love in life."" me: ""Also me?"" sb.: ""Haha, you're hilarious."" (this conversation didn't actually take place, just to illustrate my point) It's like I'm not treated like a normal and average guy but worse before they even get to know me. Not being accepted hurts. Not having been given a chance as well. Hard to put it into words, especially in English. Hopefully you'll get my point."
ForeverAloneWomen,3cmx3b,NerdyNeet23,2,Thu Jul 9 14:30:51 2015 UTC,"In a way, I suppose, it's because of having that similar disposition with these people.  I think that's the major factor here.. many have as low self-esteem... except some of them are actually very good looking (meanwhile I look like a dead toe nail).  I can't say I know for sure that they genuinely accept but, but the few that I do feel affinity with,  is more than enough.  At least online, I can fool myself into thinking that.. I am acceptable, even if I will never really get the chance to spend a single day with these people.    Again in real life, I'm just invisible.  OR people only see me to ridicule me, heck, I'm a grown-up who still got bullied at work (due to being shy and quiet).  I've had few 'friends' but ..no one ever stayed.  But yes, i feel you.  I am sorry people treat you like shit.  People suck so bad.  You don't have to put it into words, I get it."

I'm not a perfect person (how I wish) but I don't think people dislike me because of horribly negative aspects of myself. I am odd and socially anxious, but I don't think I am unlikable as a human or a bad person... I just don't fit in and rather alienated. Hmm.  I suppose it does seem like an alter ego, but it's aligned with who I am offline, except nobody gets to discover due to lack of meaningful friendship, also being socially inept/awkward.

I can get a guy for sex any day of the week but if they want to go further I pull back because I'm so afraid of commitment and being trapped. My relationships tend to last about two years and then they fall apart. I don't know why two years is my magic number but it is. I pushed my ex boyfriend away until he broke up with me because I was afraid I was too messed up and broken and I thought he deserved better.   I was abused in the past, and dealt with rape from one of my daughter's dads. I don't believe any of the guys I talk to when they say they love me, or I'm pretty, or any kind of compliment really.   I'm not manic at the moment but I'm showing some of my manic signs, except I'm weirdly feeling depressed too. I guess it's called a mixed state.   I don't have advice for you, just empathy.

Maybe those people really secretly desire to have the thing they apparently hate?  Anyway, something similar happened to me this summer. A friend of over a decade found out she's pregnant. She always said she would ""drive over a cliff"" if she got pregnant, and even last fall she said she would ""kill herself"" if she found out she was pregnant. She did not want children. She's been with her boyfriend since middle school, and he didn't want children either. But now that she actually is pregnant, they're both ecstatic and very excited. Ultimately it's a good thing they're happy, but I couldn't help but get that sinking feeling in my stomach when I found out. There's no way I'm ready for a child at this moment, but I long to belong to family of my own. My friend and her boyfriend never wanted children, and now they get to have a cute little family. Meanwhile, if I continue down this FA path, I may never be able to have biological children. Or a family. Life just doesn't make sense sometimes."

We're told that strong, smart, cool women are too busy with higher, more ambitious priorities in life to even think much about marriage. That a woman who wants to be married is looking for a meal ticket, etc. My friend has made endless jokes over the years about other women who get engaged ""trapping men.""

I am re-watching the X-files right now because I have been listening to...  Listen - The X-Files Files podcast on my commute. Before that it was WTF.  Music-wise I will listen to anything but I have been mainly been in to Synthwave/Outrun stuff (if that is the right term) recently.  Carpenter Brut, Scattle, Mitch Murder, Kavinsky, Mega Drive, Power Glove etc."

But then I get sad, because I know that doesn't happen to girls like me. Handsome men live in a different world- they can easily find a girl who is as nice and smart and nerdy as me, but who is also very attractive.  And that's fair- I'm not great looking, I have no right to demand it.  But it's fun to dream."

I went to New York Comic Con last year and I just wanted to run away and hide when I saw all the men fawning over and surrounding these beautiful women in skimpy clothes cosplaying. Even at nerd events you are constantly reminded of how inferior and worthless you are as an unattractive female.
ForeverAloneWomen,3c8fkg,chaosakita,5,Mon Jul 6 12:52:34 2015 UTC,"OMG, yes! I was at this comic con, and there were some ladies from Playboy radio there.  They were dressed appropriately, nothing too slinky, but they were obviously thin and beautiful.  The guys flocked to them, as if there was a chance the Playboy ladies would've gotten with them.  Even heard one guy I know, who's maybe 50, always wears a cowboy hat, and pretty much wears jeans and a hawaiian t-shirt every day for the last 20 years, say something like, ""Oh, why can't I get a girl like that?""  I thought in my head -- uh, because you're at least 20 years older than her and haven't changed your outfit in 20 years?"""

We'd be childhood best friends that still kept in touch even though he'd moved away and was busy being famous. Then, something tragic would happen to me, and he'd rush back to our hometown so he could be by my side as I teetered towards death. I'd eventually make a full recovery, and we would tearfully confess our love for each other, and then we'd live happily ever after, etc.  My fantasies now are a lot more mundane, realistic, and technically attainable. Cuddling while watching the sunset, laughing over dumb little inside jokes, snuggly Netflix nights, going on hikes and exploring new places.   For the particular guy I'm crushing on now, I imagine us living together in the heart of the city for a few years. We'll volunteer overseas. He'll propose on a secluded beach during sunset (after typing that out, it sounds awfully cliche lol). We'll get a dog or two, and settle down some place quieter, though I haven't decided exactly where yet lol.   Sometimes, though I don't even know if I want kids, I'll imagine him holding our firstborn baby, and he'll have this look of absolute pure joy on his face as he looks from him/her to me. And I could see it in his eyes that we're his everything."

Seeing the boxer shorts, men's jackets and socks, makes me lonely. There are girls buying that stuff for their boyfriends, and they get to see him walking around the house in the clothes that she bought.

ForeverAloneWomen,3c8fkg,dubstependerfox,6,Mon Jul 6 00:12:22 2015 UTC,"I have an elaborate one.   So I die and go to heaven (Im not suicidal okayyyy). Heaven in this fantasy is really just earth filled with nicer people. So when you're in heavan you can see your other possibilities. Basically alternate dimensions.  So I start watching these cuz why not and I realize really quickly that its filled with a bunch of me's that fell in love married kids and lived happily after blah blah blah. Pretty depressing but whatever. I stop watching them and figure it's like torture to see these other happy possibilities.   Then Women pop up.  Women I knew, women I met briefly. Women I had crushes on or women I don't even recognize.  They start flirting with me pretty heavily. I for the first time in my life (Afterlife) start dating ...   Each time I go out they start talking about their other possible lives. Evidently it was pretty rare, at least for all these women to find happily ever after where in all my alternate worlds, all my possibilities where I fell in love seemed to end in a pretty content life.   I slowly realize that all these women saw their seperate lives and I was the possibility they most idealized. That I was as close to perfect to a life that they can all have. That the content happy love life that was common in my possibilities was uncommon at least for these women. The other possibility  which was one of the best for these women, was pretty average among my happy possibilites.   At first it is great datign these women but i slowly realize I am not really who they see, but an idealized perception they saw in their alternate reality which is both me but not me. More and more everytime I date these women all they want to do is talk about  their other possibility and recreating that life they could have had if we were together. All they talk about is that other possibilty, the kids we never had, the difficult time they had I supported them through. They never seem to see the man that is sitting across from them nor want to create anything new.   Anyways I end up banging my hot neighbor and end up with her (Played by the redheaded chick in the flash) who I initially think is too out of my league but realizing after meeting all these women that really any women would be lucky to have me.  The End.   It's funny cuz this story is just me dating a bunch of women who idealize and are attracted to me  then ending up with someone who actually got to know me. It's actually pretty mundane when I break it down.   Ive got a bunch of these stupid fantasies."

You can Google it to get a better picture.  Anyway my fantasy changes depending on what ridiculous goal I'm trying to achieve for myself.

It's ridiculously dumb, I know, but anonymous interneting has become a kind of output for whatever weird shit is going through my head, and I never really felt like I could truly connect with other people enough.

What really makes her interesting to me is that she's mentally ill like me and she's dealt with a lot of the same issues that I have, like having a hard time getting (and keeping) a job, isolating herself due to anxiety, and living a non-traditional adult lifestyle. Plus, she's a total free-spirit hippie type, which is really different from me.

Whatever the case, I do feel bad for letting him down in such an awkward/shitty fashion. It's kind of funny in retrospect, though.   Since then, I've become a little more confident.

Anyway, if it turned out we weren't compatible, then once I realized that, I would tell her that I didn't think we were compatible, hopefully in a way that didn't produce heartbreak or hurt feelings in either of us.  If we were compatible, the universe would probably implode due to the sheer improbability of this sequence of events.  OK, maybe not, but in all honesty, I would not have the faintest idea what to do if we got, let's say, three dates in and obviously were hitting it off. I would just be completely clueless and lost.

Plus, my friend told me how he hooked up with his female suitemate. I went on a date with this guy, said he wasn't interested in anything long term so that really tore me up back then. I went out with this other guy but mostly to fill that emptyness I felt since I also was jealous at another friend for having a boyfriend and felt like she was choosing him over me."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c518h,HermannHermann,3,Sun Jul 5 02:03:44 2015 UTC,Went on a date two years ago. It kind of let to nothing to be honest. Only have ever had two dates (one date each).

I was a 21-year-old barman and one night at work I swigged a few too many free drinks and asked a girl to meet me the next night for a drink and we did and it was... flat. There wasn't a second date.

ForeverAloneWomen,3c4gey,Vault-B0y,7,Sat Jul 4 18:09:17 2015 UTC,"It depends what you define as settling. I think everyone settles to some extent, they could all keep searching for that perfect person but eventually they all have to settle for someone who is good enough to make them happy, because perfect partners don't exist. However if you're asking if I would date someone I had to attraction to in looks or personality, no I wouldn't do that."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c4gey,NerdyNeet23,5,Sat Jul 4 19:25:03 2015 UTC,Nah I wouldn't settle; I don't think it would be fair to me or the other person involved.  To be honest I don't even know what my type is so the idea of settling doesn't really fit me.
ForeverAloneWomen,3c4gey,DrowningInRealism,3,Sat Jul 4 18:34:08 2015 UTC,"Never. Its unfair to both people involved. Do I think people should have some leniancy in the specifics they want in a partner? Yes. Superficial things like hair color and a few extra pounds, or things that arent relevant to a lasting relationship shouldnt be the core of what you look for. But the most important things like chemistry, and compatibility and integrity should never be settled for. Both people will end up unhappy down the road. Its far better to be alone and wait it out until you find someone who fits you right."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c4gey,StormyLlewellyn1,2,Sat Jul 4 19:44:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the same for me.  When I speak of  'not settling' I mean the important things like connection, chemistry, compatibility. Those things matter too much to me and I feel I'd be lonelier if those didn't exist."

And a lot of them complain about the attention they get , whereas I would love it.

That of course you could get a job by going to an interview and being friendly, that of course guys would open doors for everyone, that of course you could go to a bar and people would buy you drinks and talk to you and help you out in foreign cities just because that's what people did.

ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,uh-okay-I-guess,6,Fri Jul 3 23:01:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I think part of the denial is that it makes them uncomfortable. It's hard for them to accept that a person they didn't know was in such pain, is in such pain. They might think they can convince the FA that ""it isn't so bad"", and the problem will go away. And some of that is that being FA is so alien to most people, they find it hard to wrap their heads around it.  Sadly, that all makes them very unsupportive.

ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,Toridon88,4,Sat Jul 4 05:34:49 2015 UTC,"I completely understand, you are not alone in that. When I explain things to people, even here, they are dismissive as well. They think I'm imagining things. Its funny you talk to people thinking they will understand and even on this forum they will tell you you are mistaken yet they are not there when the things are happening. If its any consolation, I believe you (though I don't know you). I can relate."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,Foliagus,2,Sat Jul 4 03:26:57 2015 UTC,"Thank you, I feel better already.  I just felt like somebody punched my gut.  If there's anything that annoys me, it's that I am being made to feel I am merely imagining this or making up the issue.  Heck even somewhat being blamed for it.    I don't want to be coddled, but I don't want my legitimate experience to be silenced."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,missmango123,2,Sat Jul 4 05:40:38 2015 UTC,"Completely understand and am glad you feel better :). I used to tell some close people about my experiences and they told me it must have been my fault somehow. Ever since then, I don't tell them anything."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,Foliagus,6,Sat Jul 4 11:46:15 2015 UTC,"The thing is, even if you think you don't look good, there's probably someone out there that does think you look good.  The problem I've had is, say I tell you that you look nice.  If you call me a liar, tell me I'm wrong, obsess about how bad you look, then I'll either start to believe it, or maybe lose interest, if I'm looking for a happy or secure person.   I don't think I look good.  My girlfriend thinks I do.  She's aware of my insecurities, and I try not to bring them up, it's got to be bad, right?  She's definitely plush around the edges, but I like that, and she knows I do.    My advice if you'd like it is to go chat with people online, get used to the idea that somebody might want to talk to you for your personality, and move from there.  Building up confidence one step at a time.   I've considered myself FA many times, and I've dated a dozen women :/.  That insecurity doesn't just disappear magically when someone likes you, you have to work at it."

Been made fun of since I was a kid.  Yeah, I get your point, but I don't see myself magically gaining confidence in how I look.  I'm more confident in my intellect, sense of humour, interests, etc., but people don't appreciate that much. To tell you the truth, if any person who is the object of my affection ever saw me and appreciated me as an entire human (looks and personality), while I doubt my insecurity would vanish, but I'd probably believe them a bit because I have never had feelings for people I do not respect.  Oh and I chat with people online. (*well not everyday, but I just mean I do).  I have a lot of online friends."

Who is your enemy, the world?  Or are you sabotaging yourself?  If you want to not be forever alone, that is possible.  If you want to be alone, that's fine too.  The question is what are you getting out of it?"
ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,Under_the_bluemoon,4,Sat Jul 4 04:43:41 2015 UTC,"That's not the question nor purpose of my 'rant'. I may be socially anxious, but I only got worse as I grew older.  I was may more open before.  And no I am not 'sabotaging' myself, people can't seem to grasp that through the years, many FA were probably as normal as most people.  Personally, as I mentioned, the more alienated and rejected I have become, the more I retreated into my shell.   That's not really my 'issue' here, I don't need to defend myself to people that's all.  You make it seem as if people are Forever Alone on purpose, or merely all due to 'sabotaging' myself."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,neuropathica,-1,Sat Jul 4 05:21:51 2015 UTC,"That's your interpretation.  The fact is that regardless of how you got to where you are at, who else is going to change it for you?  No one -- the rest of your journey can be different if you empower yourself by realizing that you are in control of a lot more than you give credit to.  Sure it's scary to admit that, but passing through fear instead of assigning blame could bring many wonderful things."
ForeverAloneWomen,3c1bvq,Under_the_bluemoon,4,Sat Jul 4 06:18:08 2015 UTC,"It's a bit rich for you to come into a thread where someone is complaining about her experiences being dismissed, in order to dismiss her experiences."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,missmango123,11,Thu Jul 2 20:34:00 2015 UTC,"True, but I don't feel that's the norm though. I know plenty of people who are in happy, settled relationships, and I'd like one of those."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,NerdyNeet23,6,Thu Jul 2 20:38:40 2015 UTC,I don't think very many people would not want a good relationship. Unfortunately those don't seem easy to get. Also there are a ton of relationships that seem great or perfect on the surface.
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,Foliagus,3,Thu Jul 2 20:41:45 2015 UTC,"They're not easy to get, but like so many things in life, if you don't try, you miss out on every good moment, even in a bad relationship.  Many relationships do seem perfect on the surface, but aren't, and there are often complications and compromises being made on both party's behalfs.    I view any relationship I've had as learning material, even if there was something wrong, there was something I could take from it, of value.  It helps you refine what you need in a relationship, as you slowly go through them."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,Foliagus,0,Sat Jul 4 00:31:44 2015 UTC,That sounds nice but I don't even have the opportunity for a bad relationship even if I wanted one.

Those are indicative of not willing to take the risk involved in any relationship.  I got involved with an 8 month pregnant woman.  There were huge issues involved, still worth it, I still learned a lot."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,Foliagus,-2,Sat Jul 4 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"I never said that. I looked back on my posts and what I said was ""I hate drama"". Is that so bad? I won't tell you how to live my life and you won't tell me how to live mine. Saying things like ""mmk"" makes it sound like you don't care to listen to what I have to say?"
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,agirlwhonevergoesout,4,Sat Jul 4 03:25:37 2015 UTC,"Sorry, no, that wasn't what I meant to convey.  I'm here to give advice, not to tell you how to live.  My apologies.  I've been FA, and I've dated FA, I know what mindsets pop up, and defeatist/pessimist is the one that always shows itself first.   I was, you're correct, referring to ""I hate drama"".  I was just illustrating that if I didn't take in ANY drama, god, I wouldn't have had my first girlfriend, let alone my last."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,obtrudenomore,-2,Sat Jul 4 03:29:26 2015 UTC,I don't know what makes you qualified to give advice. You don't know anything about me.
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,shbro1,3,Sat Jul 4 03:40:18 2015 UTC,"Ouch, advice doesn't really have to be a qualified thing.  We all come to reddit to share viewpoints, that's all this is, advice.  I'm sorry if I've offended you, I was just commenting on the idea of crazy relationship drama being a bad thing, when compared to not having a relationship at all.  I maintain you have to take the bad with the good, and if you're really looking, then compromises have to be made, to a healthy extent."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,agirlwhonevergoesout,3,Sat Jul 4 03:43:42 2015 UTC,"I have to agree.  I know many people in imperfect but completely stable and happy relationships.  I really wouldn't want to pretend relationships are all drama and trouble just to convince myself that being single is better.  That isnt what this thread is about I know, but it I have noticed it's what some single people say to convince ourselves that being single is better.  I don't think any is better, both have their merits and demerits."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bwvnm,enhancedmuppet,5,Fri Jul 3 04:35:30 2015 UTC,"I think a lot if not most people settle in relationships just to be in one. I can understand the impulse because I've rarely had the opportunity even for that, but it's also that is what the majority of relationships are."

My ""friendships"" are all one sided and it's exhausting. I yearn for at least one person who actually wants to spend time with me and get to know who I am. I'm always the one putting in all the work to maintain the ""friendships"" I have and often times I feel I should just walk away but then I'd have absolutely no one.   My advice is to get out. Volunteer or join a club where you're bound to at least feel some sense of community or friendship for some period of time. It also improves your chances of making friends - or at least that's what I keep telling myself..."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bx0xm,Marie_J,3,Thu Jul 2 22:14:16 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you've gone through all of that. That's all I really wanted to say.
ForeverAloneWomen,3bx0xm,Tgumpsta,3,Thu Jul 2 22:57:12 2015 UTC,"I really relate to your experience. I consider myself an extrovert because I draw my energy from other, but I was shy growing up. I'm not anymore and I have tried relentlessly to make friends. I've had acquaintances but no real friendships where I wasn't putting in all the effort and no real romantic relationships. I understand your pain. I want people in my life, badly. It excruciating for me to come home to an empty house every day and have no one to talk to ever. It's awful that's it's always been like this.    The thing is, I think this sometimes happens to people and it's not that there is necessarily anything wrong with them, it's just the cards they are dealt. Some people just end up alone. It's really hard on people who don't want it to be that way, but I think some people just don't get the life they want despite their effort. I really feel for you."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bx0xm,obtrudenomore,-3,Fri Jul 3 00:01:49 2015 UTC,"Shift your focus inwards. Realize and understand that what you consistently tell yourself in a state of belief, will seek outwards expression.  Forming a new mindset for yourself could prove to be highly successful in this kind of situation; define what these kinds of relationships really mean to you on a deeper level. Yes, everyone wants to be accepted and part of a group, but understanding your motivating factors will make all the difference. Where did your beliefs on this subject of wanting friends come from? Were they your own original design, or were the seeds planted in your mind from a source that doesn't align with your life at all?  What you consistently hold in your mind will seek outwards expression. Always.  Keeping thoughts of loneliness and despair in your mind will produce just that, as you've experienced. Other people notice this too. Shift your thoughts, the only thing in this world you have absolute control over, is your mind.   This doesn't happen in a day. But your passion has been transmuted to me through your words on reddit, and if you harness that into building a more supportive mindset for your relationship goals, you will absolutely get there.  It's going to hard, and there will be thoughts of frustration and misunderstanding, but the only way to solve this for yourself is to think. I know it may sound strange, but you're going to have to think. Meditate. Understand yourself.  Ask yourself questions, questions that will uncover what you really need. Go and use your resources to answer those questions.   Your satisfaction is attainable. As long as you believe it. Best of luck! :)"

I bet these are the same people who email me to say they'll be coming to my office hours, and then don't come to my office hours, and then don't apologize, because in order to do so, they'd have to explain to me that they forgot the appointment or just changed their mind."

I'm sure that some degree of ""ghosting"" (or ""the fade"" as I've seen it called on Reddit) has been around forever. But really...ghosting without a single trace after months (or, god forbid, years) of dating? What makes anyone think this is okay? In one of the comments to the article, a lady said that her husband ghosted after 12 years of marriage and even refused to act like he knew her when they came within inches of each other once in public. I don't even know how a person psychologically recovers from that."

After a year or so, I got back in touch to say I'd been going through a difficult time (true) and that I was sorry I'd behaved the way I had. This person now puts loads of work my way and we have a surprisingly great working and close-acquaintance relationship.   Even if the outcome hadn't been so positive for me (apologising was still the right thing to have done), it's a good reminder that treating people with respect and being willing to go through the hard/clarifying/frightening conversation can lead to an improved situation for everyone involved."

You both are still pretty much strangers at that point and do not owe each other anything.    It is the ones that do it after they are married or in a relationship for years that blow my mind.
ForeverAloneWomen,3bvrqg,chaosakita,1 point,Fri Jul 3 13:01:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think ghosting after one date isn't terrible (although it's confusing and kind of hurtful when it happens after the person made references during the date to wanting to go out again).  But I remember when I had zero experience with dating, the first couple times someone disappeared after 1-2 dates, I took it very personally. I thought it meant I had come off in a way that was so creepy or crazy the person didn't feel 100 percent safe having any more contact with me, even to say ""no thanks."" Hoping to let some other people know if that happens to you, it's nothing unusual."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bunjg,fruitfan,7,Thu Jul 2 08:03:44 2015 UTC,"I'll put it this way: there's a lot of stuff on the internet that I avoid putting in my brain because I want to stay relatively... I guess the word is ""wholesome."" And I completely realize the ridiculous of saying that when I'm a frequent commenter on reddit, but anyway, I just try to avoid consuming content online that I think might make me more cynical.  PUA is one of the categories of stuff I avoid for this reason. So of course, there's a risk that I wouldn't even know if someone was doing it on me, because I haven't learned enough about it to ID someone like that very easily.  That said, I think I'm pretty impervious to negging or someone trying to ""keep me guessing"" or whatever at this point. I've been through enough negative stuff already in my attempts to date that my tolerance for it is low. And I think anyone who was engaged with PUA would probably be put off quickly anyway by my total lack of interest in casual sexual intimacy."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bunjg,coralya,5,Thu Jul 2 10:07:06 2015 UTC,"And I think anyone who was engaged with PUA would probably be put off quickly anyway by my total lack of interest in casual sexual intimacy.   Same here. I never met any PUA men IRL, I think also cause here it doesn't exist as such (most dating stuff comes from English speaking countries), but for me if it's a form of pick up, then I'm not interested. I also consider it usually applies to younger men or men trying to get casual hookups with younger women.   However, I lurked on a couple of PUA related websites, and there are some approaches which are more valid than others for me. I think there is a difference between learning to be the best you possible/learning basic postures or convo icebreakers, which most often stems from a lack of proper socialization, and mimicking someone who makes an abusive use of gimmicks to get laid.   I wouldn't judge a man crippled by anxiety or shyness who wants to improve, and some of these improvement techniques can come from PUA or dating oriented websites. I mean, even some ""how to look better"" guides can be spot on. If it can help men to feel better about themselves, then by all means, I'm all for it.   However, I wouldn't be interested by a guy using a catalog of made up stuff to connect with others. Cause it's not about connecting, it's just about getting in one's pants as fast as possible."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bunjg,lnys,4,Thu Jul 2 10:47:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I originally was going to say I'd be kind of put off by dating someone who even knew a lot about what PUA is, but I decided against it because of that whole crippling social anxiety/etc. thing. When someone is just trying desperately to be socially normal, I'm not going to judge what sources they go to to try to achieve that. But, I would hope their interest in PUA wouldn't go beyond that."

I know a guy who gives off ""PUA"" vibes when he's around women.  He's a very anxious, shy guy, and I'm sure he'd be a total sweetheart to a women who likes him back.  I'd probably try it myself, if I actually believed it addressed the things that are holding me back.  On the opposite end of the spectrum, when talking to self-confident guys who were popular with women, they all seem very convinced they were able to ""talk"" women into their beds.  ""Chicks are easy, bro, you just got to have game.""  I'm not sure their tongue was doing the heavy lifting.  That second group of guys probably aren't using ""tricks"" to talk to women.  Doesn't mean their intentions are honorable.   However, I wouldn't be interested by a guy using a catalog of made up stuff to connect with others. Cause it's not about connecting, it's just about getting in one's pants as fast as possible.

Those of it who are actually in it to legitimately help guys never condone routines, games or anything of the sort for that matter.   The community is more so focused around helping guys leave their comfort zones and take chances with not just women but their lives in general. A little back story, I was seriously depressed throughout high school and my first years of college. I had friends but I didn't really know how to express myself around them. I did not have a single female friend and was deathly afraid of any sort of interaction with the opposite sex. To the point where I would just ignore them and walk away or if I had an acquaintance and I knew I would run into her in some way I would walk the other way and pretend to ignore her just for the sake of avoiding the interaction. I was pretty bad.  Then one day when I was watching some Youtube while waiting for a game of league of legends to load(That was my one and only hobby, I would never go out to parties, barely ever go out to socialize. Just go to school and come back and play league.) I watched this video that popped up on my Facebook from these guys called 'Simple Pickup'. I saw these guys who looked no different than me and sounded no different then me approach random people and have awesome conversations with them. This sparked something in my head, why couldn't I do this shit!? Why couldn't I go out and have meaningful conversations with people I've just met?   So I mustered what little of my confidence I had, that wasn't drained by my crippling depression and gave it a shot. I still remember the first time I approached a girl, my hands were sweating even at the thought. My heart raced like it never did before. Everything in the world including putting a bullet through my head seemed more of a rational decision. But honestly I had nothing to lose so I went for it. Safe to say it ended badly, I asked her for the time, she completely ignored me and my stuttering mouth and walked away. I felt really bad for the first 40 seconds and then realized.....HOLY SHIT I JUST APPROACHED A RANDOM GIRL AND NOTHING BAD HAPPENED.   After I would try this everyday after school instead of going back home to just play league and drown my miseries, try approaching at least 3 or 4 strangers a day. The rejections hurt like the burning depths of hell but I was granted a sense of accomplishment and euphoria each day.   Fast forward a few months to a year, I made friends that I would never forget. Went through many ups and downs, good times and bad with various different girls. But overall became a more confident, positive and overall better version of myself as cliche as that sounds. It taught me girls, the people I've been afraid of more than half of my life are just regular people just like you and me with their anxieties, problems, hopes and dreams. Also you do not necessarily need to look like a supermodel, have a lot of money and be built as hell to meet awesome women. You just have to be confident in yourself.  There are still many parts of this that are indigestible, such as the mass approaching. I would take a different perspective, if there was any other way to improve your social skills without repeated social interactions with ALOT of people, please tell me I'd love to have to stop approaching people. But that's the only surefire way I see to noticeably improve my skills and be at ease talking to anyone, man or woman. And the general stigma of just wanting 'sex' from every woman and not wanting a relationship, I think it's the exact OPPOSITE. Most guys I've met and myself included initially got into this to find that special someone. It's the mindset you come into this with, if you want to get laid that's going to be how this community shapes you. If you want to get better socially, learn to love yourself and meet awesome people, that's what you'll get. If you want to have a meaningful relationship with another girl, that's what you will get. It's the person not the medium. But personally I've been through various relationships going through this. Sadly a lot of them ended due to personal reasons but I regret not one second of any.  Thanks for taking the time to read this it's a bit long so TLDR, Pickup isn't represented by this guy, it's more of a medium for self improvement. My personal story on how it got me over my depression and crippling social anxiety."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bru28,chaosakita,3,Wed Jul 1 17:41:36 2015 UTC,"I'm 100% a homebody. I used to feel sort of ashamed of it, and lied to people about what I did in my free time so they didn't think less of me.  Even though the anxiety that probably started the habit is now nearly gone (meds), I've decided I'm honestly fine with it. I enjoy being able to get back home after a days work and be able to just relax in my own, personal, quiet space. I enjoy having a whole weekend with no plans at all. I'm happy talking to the extremely good online friends I have.  I've thought about what it would be like if I was going out every other night, going to bars/parties social stuff, and I realised that I would be much happier in my current homebody lifestyle than that. It's just the way I am, and as soon as I was able to not feel ashamed of myself for thinking that way it all fit into place. Maybe I'll change one day, but for now I'm comfortable.  The downside of it is that it makes it extremely hard to meet a potential partner who would be comfortable with the same lifestyle - she's at home, and I'm at home, and there is almost no chance for us to get to meet and click."

I definitely get what you mean about fantasizing. That's basically all I did as a teenager, dreaming I had a solid friends group that I'd hang out with all the time. When in reality, I'd spend hours on the computer every day, lurking on forums and reading fanfiction.  When I'm having a bad day (feeling lonely, insecure, and anxious, self esteem is low), I stay the fuck away from Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter. I'm really thankful that social media wasn't a huge thing when I was younger, because seeing everybody's posts about how much fun they were having (without me) would have only made me feel 10000x worse about myself."

Pretty much every other time I'm panicking. But I think the panic is more because I've never had a boyfriend before, rather than because I don't have a boyfriend.   Somebody on my Facebook feed posted one of those '30 things I learned before turning 30' articles written by one of those people who's successful at life. It was filled with things like ""love your current partner like you loved your first bf/gf in high school"", and ""cherish your time in college, when your friends are living only a few doors away"", and ""getting wasted every weekend will catch up to you"". And I was like, ""I never had a high school sweetheart, I never lived in dorms in college, I never went to parties or got drunk. I can't relate to any of this, I will never have these life experiences, I will never be normal."" It just killed me inside. These little reminders, these things that tell me I'm not like other people, they're everywhere. And I hate it.   That said, I'm pretty comfortable right now being single. Sure, it'd be nice having someone to cuddle and spend time with, but I'm used to being alone, and I have my routine. Comfortable isn't necessarily a good thing, though.

It's not a field you can make a living in these days unless you've also got a degree in marketing or law.  Almost all the good research is being done by subsistence level post-doctoral students trapped in academic/industry collaborations.  Everything otherwise is being outsourced or automated to the extent that high school educated button pushers can get things done.     Chemistry knowledge is useful, I guess.  I do real well on relevant categories on Jeopardy.  I also find that it is very useful for getting me frustrated about the general public's ignorance and misunderstanding of the espoused ""deadly chemicals"" found in their food and surroundings.

I was really shy when I was younger, that may have been the main factor in not getting a lot of experience. Although I'm not sure how much that would play into rarely ever being approached by men and I've never had a real true friend. I'm not nearly as shy anymore, but I'm living in an area that is predominately 65+. I also tend to be a bit of a more of a serious person, at least at first and I like to talk about  deep things and that is not the culture where I live.   I'd kind of really love to know if others perceive me as an undesirable partner, if there was a way to get the information that wasn't really painful. I think there is a difference between being an undesirable partner and an undesirable person. I kind of like myself, although I have my moments of doubt like everyone. I think I just need a certain kind of person, like myself for it to be a good fit and maybe that's kind of a long shot.

It's about the experience of being in college and grad school and just not being able to figure out the dating culture.  She's relatively young, of course, and writes in a style that people older than Gen Y might find unpalatable. But, I liked the book for what it was. It helped confirm my suspicions that somehow missing out on the whole teenage/college/early 20s boyfriend experience doesn't necessarily make you a total weirdo."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bp9in,coralya,1 point,Wed Jul 1 09:28:29 2015 UTC,"I agree that it definitely has the tone of coming from a young person's perspective. However I think there is more to her experience than not being able to figure out dating culture.   In the book she calls girls that receive a lot of male attention ""lighthouses"" opposed to girls like her that do not receive any attention. Her assertion is that some girls are just lighthouses and others are not. Interested in what everyone thinks about that concept even if you did not read the book."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bp9in,CuredByCupcakes,2,Wed Jul 1 17:11:09 2015 UTC,"When I was younger, someone referred to me as a lighthouse for assholes, creeps and perverts. I guess that term has been around for awhile.  I do know some women who receive a lot of male attention. They also make friends with women easily. I wouldn't say it's all about being pretty. Their looks vary. One thing I've noticed is they usually have a naturally friendly and welcoming demeanor. They have a resting happy face. Their inherent personality just pulls people in and since they have so many positive interactions with people they keep that natural pleasantness. So yeah, I think some women are naturally lighthouses. Others may be able to alter themselves to be one, but I don't think everyone has it in them."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bo0jp,uh-okay-I-guess,2,Wed Jul 1 03:03:27 2015 UTC,"Same here, I think. Anytime I have to share a room with someone, I rarely sleep well. Waaaay too sensitive to sound and light, so unless the person has the same exact sleep schedule that I have, it can't work.  College was hell for that. I had to share a room all 4 years and I was always a zombie for a reason. I worry I could never be in a relationship because, well, it's just something you do when you're in one, right? I know very few couples who don't sleep in the same room..."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bo0jp,thekittydog,2,Wed Jul 1 04:41:17 2015 UTC,"Not all couples do, but I wonder how you get to that point.  It's not exactly something most people discuss during dating, and saying you'd like to have separate bedrooms, unless the other person is in the tiny minority who would like that too, sounds like a really great way to kill a developing relationship.  I got lucky in college -- I got a single room 3 out of 4 years. Freshman year was horrible and I had to go home every single weekend, even though my roommate was pretty much the quietest guy imaginable."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bo0jp,uh-okay-I-guess,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:19:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's definitely an issue. Like I said, if our schedules were pretty much the same, then it wouldn't really be a problem.   My roommates were also really not that bad all things considered and they were usually pretty quiet, but I had one who would get up between 5 and 6 everyday, including weekends and would always turn on the hallway light, which I would notice and then I couldn't get back to sleep. I'm not a morning person, so that kind of drove me batty after a while. Then the other roommate did the opposite and didn't go to bed until 2 or 3 in the morning and I had to be up at 7-ish to go to class/work, but I could never fall asleep, try as I might, until she did.  It was basically the worst.   I think I'd just have to hope whomever I lived with would have a fairly similar schedule. Or at least was mindful enough to be extra quiet and not turn on the lights when coming to bed later—or getting up early—as the case may be. I'd hate to think that one thing would be the sole reason I'd never find someone. :(  My parents actually sleep in separate rooms because of their wildly different schedules. So, hey, at least one couple I know of does it."

You're telling me I have to find someone who finds me interesting and attractive, who I find interesting and attractive, who is miraculously not currently in a relationship with someone else, and we have to have values and goals and personalities that are compatible enough for a long-term relationship... and then on top of that, they have to somehow be okay with all my weird introvert needs?

ForeverAloneWomen,3bo0jp,uh-okay-I-guess,2,Wed Jul 1 07:47:45 2015 UTC,"I have exactly the same thoughts.

I call it ""pessimist brain"" and it's a record that starts playing whenever it gets a chance.  Or, let's be honest, maybe it's ""realist brain"" not ""pessimist brain."" So, I don't try to tell it it's wrong, because hell, maybe it's right.  I just try not to pay attention to it, and focus on other things instead—positive things, or things I feel like I have more control over than I have over whether ""Man Magically Compatible with Weirdo /u/coralya"" pops out of the ether and I somehow manage to get romantically involved with him."

It's more like...for instance, I like keeping the place cool, even in the winter, so in the summer the A/C is on high and in the winter the windows are often cracked open and I only turn the heater on if it gets to freezing temps (even then I'll just put on a couple of layers and call it good before I think about turning the heater on).

I would be gone all day and night most of the time. He never cleaned...ever. It got so bad, I asked politely if he could discard his pizza boxes and other food, but he didn't. There were horrific things I found that gave me certain complexes now; I have a weird thing about food.  I'm 30 and work from home, so I keep my home really nice. I haven't had a boyfriend since in person since...just online guys that I tried to meet up with but didn't pan out. If I do happen to have one again, and we live together, I really hope he won't be like that guy (not just messy, but other aspects). Sometimes thinking about it gives me anxiety.

I'd have to break it off, even if we were perfectly compatible in every other way.  Of course, presumably your boyfriend was also fairly young then too. I wasn't a good housekeeper at that age, either—I didn't have pizza boxes lying around, but my apartment certainly wasn't clean.

But he was from Europe and went to boarding school, and lived away from home most of his life. I had never lived away from home and I moved across the country to go to school. He literally had towers of pizza boxes in the one gaming room, along with old Chinese box containers that he shoved under the couch cushions, bacon and other foods left in bags and left under tables and seats, open soda containers and cans spilled around under things etc.  He was abusive and cheated on me, so that is what really made me kick him out. But yeah, I really don't want a complete slob if I ever get to be in a serious relationship again. Since I am at home more now (I was gone 6am-10pm four times a week back then), I don't mind picking up some things after my partner.   I honestly don't mind doing the laundry, vacuuming, cleaning the bathrooms...kitchen is one thing that I have a problem/issue with. So I am very clean about that, and clean up right after cooking meals before eating and after. Again, I have issues with food though.   All of my few friends are married now, and I don't talk much with them any more. However, they said a while back that living with their husbands wasn't so bad.

For fun yesterday, I tried doing something different with my hair, thought it looked kind of nice, then later went to take a selfie so I could maybe update my profile photo, was instantly horrified, put my hair back the way it was, tried a couple more selfies, was still horrified, then just gave up.  Like...either I'm just not photogenic at all or that's how most people see me and if it is, well, that kind of makes me depressed. I didn't used to think I looked all that bad, but, well, with no male attention whatsoever...maybe I do? When I see cute guys around these days, I tend to immediately think ""Oh, he's cute, but he'd never want anything to do with me"" and then I forget about him. It's bad. I don't want to think so negatively. I feel like I'm making a self-fulfilling prophecy. So I try hard to be positive...but the negativity just keeps hounding me. I'm still convinced there's not one guy out there that would tell me I'm beautiful.  Or even marginally attractive for that matter.   Such is life."

I take off the eyeliner when I get to the closest bathroom. Don't know what I was thinking."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bjhy1,obtrudenomore,1 point,Tue Jun 30 04:58:48 2015 UTC,I think winged eyeliner tends to smudge quickly. I wear regular eyeliner and I sometimes have to touch that up. I usually carry foundation with me if I'm going to be out a long time or if I have an outbreak because I will have to touch up. I think that's the nature of it. I hate to see you feel bad about it.

ForeverAloneWomen,3bi1j5,obtrudenomore,3,Tue Jun 30 05:01:57 2015 UTC,I'm a girly girl and love to dress up. It does suck that I don't really have anyone to dress up for (I would love that) and most events I go to no one really wants to talk to me and I end up going home early and alone. But as corny as it is I do it for myself as much as for others. It is nice when someone working in a store or something compliments what I'm wearing or something. I really believe it makes all the difference in the world and that you are sending a message to the world about yourself by the way you present yourself.

I can't say I care a lot about my clothes because I dress for comfort... But I do try to look presentable. Hair is questionable...  But I will only go out the house looking like crap only if I'm too depressed to function.  I do it because I like it. And being girly is my thing. But I'm not high maintenance about it.

I also enjoy the artisty of it although I've never looked at it as covering up problems as much as enhancing feature. I really enjoy this kind of stuff and don't have anyone to talk to about it so thanks for indulging me. Does you all like to get your nails done?

For nonwork days I dress ""down"" a little bit more but I still care bout what I have on. While i dont necessarily have on fabulous outfits or anything I also think its important to come out in public looking decently. I would be horrified to come out in flip-flops or yoga pants or in a shirt with my bra showing, etc.  I think I generally look good clothing-wise.  I dont always wear makeup (but Id like to get back to doing it daily) but when I do, its pressed powder, mascara, eyeliner and tinted lip balm.  I actually like having my nails colored a lot but Im also a nail biter and lazy with taking care of them so most of the time, they go unpolished.  And its funny that I would absolutely DIE with wearing open-toed shoes in teh summer if my toes weren't polished. Something about that looks so ""wrong"" to me."

Problem is, I didn't try any of it very hard. I always gave up before the point the average person would say it was reasonable to give up.  Five years after totally giving up, I still wonder if I'm going to look around someday and realize, ""Oh yeah, I'm over the rejection, I'm ready to try again.""  But then I remember the first person I ever went on a date with, and how it dragged out for a few months without going anywhere, and how he emailed me and said he didn't want to make me unhappy so he wouldn't contact me again. I remember trying to get up and walk away from the computer, but I almost fell over because I was close to blacking out.  That was a long time ago, and I tell myself no one has the power to devastate me that way anymore. But the truth is, I've been hurt even worse since then, and maybe I didn't come close to fainting that time, but the pain was worse and lasted longer.  Maybe someday."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bgc9s,coralya,1 point,Mon Jun 29 10:42:18 2015 UTC,That's pretty sad. Do you think this problem is larger enough to see a psych about it? It almost sounds like you were traumatized by that guy.

I'm not thrilled about being single, but I don't hate it either, and it seems more appealing to me than the emotional minefield of dating.  I still run into ""almost made overly intense /u/coralya pass out with an email"" guy occasionally. Not often, thank heavens. For years, it was like getting kicked in the gut each time I saw him. Now it's more like getting lightly pushed in the gut. So apparently I am on a healing trajectory. Just an inordinately slow one."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bgc9s,coralya,1 point,Mon Jun 29 18:42:40 2015 UTC,"I wish people would quit using this ""I don't want to end up making you unhappy"" method of breakup. Some people say this is just a way of letting you down easy, but in reality it only protects the ego of the person initiating the breakup. Instead of them being honest and saying ""I don't see a future"" or ""I'm not interested in dating you""--something that places the blame on them--they have to turn it on YOU instead. The guy might as well be saying, ""I'm sorry, I can't meet your unattainably high standards so I have to split because you're putting too much pressure on me.""   Although I readily admit that I also have out-of-proportion reactions to romantic rejection, this type of rejection just sucks."

Hahaha, in my case he came right out and told me (over email, of course) that I was pressuring him. What did I do to pressure him? I asked, when he disappeared for a month, ""Why didn't I hear from you for a month?""  Wish I were kidding. It gets worse, actually, but I won't drag any of us through the ridiculous details. My only defense is that I was 20 and this was the One and Only Person Ever who had ever seemed romantically interested in me, so I had absolutely zero idea what I was doing and I blamed anything and everything on my own inexperience and shyness."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bgc9s,coralya,1 point,Mon Jun 29 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"Wow, what a coward he was. From the email format to the direct blaming of you, he couldn't own any part of the breakup. Jesus.  I don't know if I would consider a bad reaction to that experience as ""out of proportion,"" because the way he acted was certainly low. It just seems like so many people flat out don't care about other people's feelings. And maybe I'm wrong in saying this, but it seems to be more rampant in our generation."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bgc9s,clfkik,6,Tue Jul 14 22:03:54 2015 UTC,"I'm 28 and divorced. My ex-husband married me because my family is comfortable with money and he wanted to be comfortable for life too. We were together for a year until I found out about his porn addiction, infidelity, online affairs, and his hidden debt. We divorced and he's moved out of state and is cheating on his current girlfriend. I'd dated disastrously before and again after. I'm just really fucking over it. I think that I'm emotionally broken when it comes to picking men because I always pick scum bags and abusers. I grew up in an abusive household and I was molested as a kid and teen. When I date normal, nice guys I just can't get a spark, no matter how much I like them as a person. When I try to get romantic with them I feel revulsion and I can't make myself go through with it. I'm not sure what kind of emotional barrier is there but it's awful.   I went to a therapist and he was super not helpful. When I asked for help breaking my cycle he said ""just avoid the kinds of men you like."" He actually said ""I can't help you,"" when he asked if I was eating/sleeping/functioning and I said yes and that was the end of our therapy session. I should probably try to find another therapist but honestly I don't have much faith in them now.  I'm working on losing weight now but even if I get thin I don't think it will help me much emotionally. I still want to get healthier though. I have my hobbies and I have the money/time to travel a little. I have a decent job that supports me and if I'm smart about it I can go back to school to earn more at some point.  I'd like to have kids, or at least one kid, and am trying to do the single-mom thing with frozen donor sperm but things have gone disastrously so far so I'm not sure if that's going to work out. Honestly if I am unable to have a family in the next 5-7 years I have no idea what I'll do with my life.  I guess I haven't given up. But I'm no longer hunting for ""the one."" He'll have to come find me instead."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bgc9s,I_LIKE_YOU_,2,Mon Jun 29 04:44:06 2015 UTC,"I can't say I tried very much at all, to be honest, and that might be part of my problem. Sure, I put effort into my appearance and tried to learn to be more social, but whenever there was a guy around that I liked, I kind of hung back in the shadows waiting for him to come to me instead of the other way around. I always thought that if I looked good enough and hung out at the right times and places, someone was bound to notice me eventually. But you know what? I learned—too late—that you can't just sit there and expect people to come to you. This was hard form me because I'm pretty shy unless someone puts in the effort to come talk to me and make me feel comfortable. I almost never go out of my way to talk to people I don't know.   So anyway, I watched a ton of my crushes find other girls.  On the other hand, a good chunk of them also ended up having someone before I knew about it and after I'd developed major crushes on them. You can't help that kind of thing, but it still made me feel invisible and unwanted. I didn't think it was fair, either. After all, I didn't even get to have a chance even if I had been brave enough to talk to them.   The one and only time I went out of my way to make sure the guy knew who I was and how I felt, I got shot down. After all the other losses, this one hurt particularly bad and was enough to make me not want to do anything like that ever again. I mean, he was one of those who had a girlfriend before I knew anything about it (this just ended up making it that much more mortifying for me), so it wasn't like it couldn't have maybe worked if he hadn't...it's just. I don't know. I'm so tired of falling for guys only to get ignored or find out they have someone already.   This was also the guy that I've talked about before who couldn't have been more amazing to me if he tried and, no, I don't think I'm idolizing him or putting him up on a pedestal. Maybe I am, but I always remind myself people aren't perfect—he's definitely not and I know it, but he was, well, he was something else, I can say that much.   After that, I think I just kind of gave up. I was so close but was denied yet again and, quite frankly, I'm sick of it. I don't want to get my hopes up only to have them dashed again, so I haven't paid much attention to any guys for...2 years now almost.   It doesn't help that everyone's all married off now anyway so who's there to be interested in? :/"

I can say that I probably haven't approached men as much as I should have. I know that this needs to change.  I'm a naturally shy person, but I have tried to push myself to get past that by joining clubs in university and going out to concerts, movies, and other events. It never yielded any lasting friendships or anything more than acquaintances really. Most recently I've been making efforts to do things like hanging out in cafes, which always scared me for some reason. Haven't met anyone/made any acquaintances that way. In the past, I let a friend ""set me up"" with a guy...the guy she chose was twice my age and had children who were almost my age. So that was enough of that for me.  I'm currently giving OKCupid a try, but I've been rejected on there by the guys I've messaged. I'm not trying too hard with it though because I have some other things going on in my life that are demanding my time. I hope to have a little more success online than in real life, but only time will tell.  I think I'm going to give myself until I'm 30 and then call it quits forever on dating.

ForeverAloneWomen,3bfcpq,CalzoneLayer,2,Mon Jun 29 12:17:07 2015 UTC,"If you do it responsibly yes. You can't live off only steak and eggs forever. It's a balanced diet of moderate protein, natural fats, and limited carbohydrates. The body technically doesn't need any carbohydrates to function. The liver can produce all of the glucose you need. Low carb veggies are encouraged, some fruit is okay in moderation, and no starchy veggies/breads/pasta/rice/sugar/traditional baked goods. Dairy is okay if you stick to full fat cheese and heavy/doubled cream or butter. You must manage your electrolytes and stay hydrated as ketogenesis has a diuretic effect. But yes it's very safe in the long run.  http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2716748/"

ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,upt0wnfunky,18,Sat Jun 27 18:13:24 2015 UTC,"No, I can't say that this is my problem. Even when I was younger and had a healthy self-esteem, guys never liked me. I think being unattractive is my biggest problem."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,viversemrumo,8,Sat Jun 27 20:33:21 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of FA biggest problem is unattractive. I never had low-self esteem until I started online dating.

ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,FAWinner,9,Sun Jun 28 02:13:36 2015 UTC,I agree with that. I am genuinely unattractive and no amount of makeup and dressing up changes that. I still get bad reactions from men no matter what my intentions are. I will say I do think what some of OP comments ring true to me though. I do suffer from these issues when I get approached (which is rare) but I feel that most men only approach me purely for sex.

ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,clfkik,9,Mon Jun 29 06:30:07 2015 UTC,"In my case I feel like it's a mix of both, but I do think that low self-esteem is a large factor, yes. Like, even if I woke up tomorrow and was suddenly supermodel-hot and guys everywhere were interested, I still don't think I'd know what to do with that information.  Even if someone did show interest in me, my first mental responses would be ""why would they like me like that"" ""they must be making fun of me"" ""I don't understand"", which are all more to do with self-esteem than anything else, I think. (Also a history of guys showing 'interest' only to humiliate me afterwards, which is probably part of what caused low self-esteem in the first place.)  I wish I had any advice, but sadly I don't. I could easily see myself ending up in your situation, and I don't know what I'd do about it either. Ideally I'd kind of want someone who could talk me down like a frightened animal until I was more comfortable with... basically anything intimate at all, but I feel like that's too much to ask of anybody and it's my own problem I should be sorting out. Don't know how to do it, though. I sort of hope that should the situation ever arise things would come naturally, but... kind of fear that they probably won't. Who knows! Not me."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,onemorecue,5,Sun Jun 28 02:54:20 2015 UTC,"I think, for me at least, my lack of self-esteem is one thing that has led to a lack of attention from men (and women, too, if we're talking about friendships). I had very low self-esteem as a girl; I was overweight and had a bully. I guess I never really grew out of that person that I was as a kid, despite losing the weight, ditching the bully a long time ago, and gaining some fashion sense in the meantime. I try to go out and do things in public to force myself to not be a total recluse, but I have very little success in meeting people. I've always been afraid that my body language gives a very ""closed off"" vibe, like I don't want anyone to talk to me. I have tried to do better at faking confidence. However, other people still don't interact with me that often. And even when I do make conversation with new people, it rarely goes anywhere (what does a ""non-FA"" person do after they meet someone new--add them on facebook? I don't understand how people make friends with brand new people)."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,-lost-at-sea-,4,Sun Jun 28 04:33:27 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like I give off a ""closed off"" vibe as well, and I'm really only comfortable going out in public and doing things (eating, clubbing, anything) if I have a friend with me. Even in situations where we are meeting new people, I kind of shut up and only make comment occasionally to my friend, and it seems like I don't want to/put no effort in trying to get to know the new people, but I just feel really awkward with larger groups - like who am I supposed to be speaking to? What do I say to a group of people I've never even met before at a place like a bar, where there's no common hobby?  Even so, the way I've met new friends is mostly through existing friends. I really think that making one friend that you feel comfortable around is the best starting point - you feel so much less alone, you can meet their friends, and if you go out with them you have more confidence to talk than if you were just by yourself. When I went into university with no friends, I cried everyday for the first week because I didn't know anyone and was too scared to talk to people and had no idea how to make small talk. After many painful conversations that turned into nothing, I met a guy one night that I really clicked with. He had another friend, and that friend had another friend, and now we're just a really tight group of four. We're all introverts with similar senses of humor and varying interests, but we're in the same course and get along exceedingly well. So I'm glad I stuck it out initiating conversations with random people because I met that one guy, and having him helped me find my other main friends.   In terms of what people do after meeting someone new, it depends on how well we got along, how likely I am to see them again, and how receptive they seem like they would be to hang out (like if they already had a tight knit group of friends and a very busy schedule, or if they were very friendly and was more of a floater, etc). I may ask if they have snapchat or facebook, and add them immediately or when I get back home. If we had something in common that we talked about in conversation, like we were interested in the same hobby, or both said we had wanted to try a specific restaurant, or they mentioned a hair salon/gym/whatever they frequented that I wanted to try, I would message them asking about whatever that topic was."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,-lost-at-sea-,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:37:32 2015 UTC,"I think your advice is great as a general rule, and I have met new people through existing friends. But now that I'm in my late 20s, I find it harder and harder to do that because my friends have settled down more with age. They spend less time socializing with friends in favor of spending time with their SO. Meanwhile I'm stuck alone, doing my own thing (which can be a good thing, but just makes it harder to branch out). We get together less often because of the pressures of work and grad school obligations. Even when we do get together, it's typically not a big event or party so I rarely meet friends of friends. And if I do, it just doesn't seem to go past the acquaintance stage.   I do try to get out on my own and meet people at public events, concerts, etc. I just have a lot less success befriending those people."

ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,UglyKetchup,3,Sun Jun 28 08:03:37 2015 UTC,"Somewhat, but mostly it's my social anxiety and awkwardness. Wearing stuff that actually looks good on me makes me self conscious so I rather not wear those stuff. And I have a hard time speaking to people and saying the right things. Even if a boy does approach me (in school) I drive them away with my boringness and quick replies. I just get so nervous talking to different people."

What you're dealing with now is a mental block it seems and a therapist could help you identify what it is and help you over come it. It is obviously having an impact on your everyday life, so it is something worth taking up with a pro.  And, also, OP, you got this gurl. You have taken steps to push yourself outside of your comfort zone and that is really admirable. Are you where you want to be right now? Of course not. But you know what? That's ok. These things come with time. But that first step is always hard and scary, but you did it! Go you, you're awesome! And I just want you to know that you should be proud of yourself. I know you're frustrated that you're not where you want to be yet, but don't forget to celebrate how far you've come. And you do mention that you feel like you have a lack of experience in social situations. But, you're putting yourself out there and getting some! You're taking active steps to change that. And it won't change overnight, but, like I said, that's ok. You'll get it, I promise. These things take practice, and you're no slouch.  Hey.  Hey.  High five.  You're awesome and you can do this."
ForeverAloneWomen,3bbpff,misfitx,2,Sun Jun 28 14:26:01 2015 UTC,"THIS! This describes me perfectly. In the rare chances that a guy does approach me or talk to me, I just get so nervous that I feel like running away.   If a guy shows interest in me, I feel like they must have really low self-esteem or some kind of desperate need for any type of attention. This can't be true (all the time?)... but it's what low self-esteem makes me think. I don't know how to overcome this either."

Now I have mono and can't try for at least two more months, meanwhile I have to keep paying the monthly storage fee at the bank. It's frustrating and expensive and nerve-wracking.   I have the money and savings to be okay as a single-mom. It will be really fucking hard to balance work and a kid, especially since I can't trust my family to help out. My best friend has offered to help me a lot and she's really supportive but I'm also not counting on that. If you have family that will help you then that will make it all easier.  Having pets does help, especially with depression. You HAVE to get up and feed them/walk them/whatever. They can fill an intimacy void a little. I'd suggest a cat. Go to the pound and find an older cat that's cuddly. They'll come fixed with all of their shots and the adults are harder to adopt than kittens and are often cheaper."

I've watched youtube videos of proposals at hockey games, etc. which show up on the big screen. If the girl says no, she's lambasted in the comments section and met with boos from the crowd. It's not their fucking business, and the proposer was clearly an idiot to put her in that situation.  There was a viral video recently where a guy proposed to his partner with a ring on a McChicken burger. And they say romance is dead. She turned him down, and was again derided in the video comments as being 'high maintenance' and stuck-up, as if she should have been grateful for this generous McProposal. No. Just no.

It's very easy to judge when you've been judged excessively in your formative years. The fact that you've been able to  view yourself objectively means you're likely a pretty decent person. :)  I love Boots products, by the way (and I normally don't give two shits about makeup)! Their Stay Perfect foundation line is excellent. I'm sure you've already done this, but you can get a consultant to match you up with your exact color. I'd also really recommend the Beautiful Skin Day and Night Creams. They do great things for skin tone and blemishes, limiting the need to smother your face in too much makeup, which risks aging your skin prematurely.  It takes awhile to love yourself sometimes, but self care is a major step, I believe.  Good luck and best wishes to you on your journey!"

The saying goes ""The master has failed more times than the beginner has even tried."" You just have to strive to do better the next time and try to have more successes than failures in the long run. :)"
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,chaosakita,7,Thu Jun 25 22:13:11 2015 UTC,"I've used it as a form of exposure therapy. Last year I signed up for OKCupid (mainly because I was putting off studying for finals lol), and couldn't even rate people's profiles. I knew that people could potentially be notified when somebody rated them highly, and the idea that somebody would KNOW that I LIKED them was TERRIFYING. And then what if they didn't like me back? Or worse, what if they DID? And what if they'd... MESSAGE ME?! What the hell do I say, I'm not cool enough for them they're gonna realize I'm such an antisocial nerd with no life experience oh my GOD. Sounds dumb, but that's life with anxiety. You overthink everything!  Then I signed up for Tinder. At first, whenever I'd see a profile is liked, I'd quit the app and do something else. Because again, swiping right means telling them that you liked them, and that's scary! (I must sound like such a dork lol). I finally mustered up the courage to swipe right about a week after getting the app. And then about a week after that I was brave enough to have a conversation with somebody. Progress!  Nowadays I'm fine with rating profiles/swiping, but haven't yet reached the point where I've gone out with somebody. Most conversations I've had died pretty quickly, partly because I don't know how to talk to people, and partly because we didn't have much in common. I've clicked with a few people to the point where I'd consider meeting them in person, but none of them live nearby. There's this one guy who's become like a pen pal, we've been messaging each other for a few months now. So far it's just friendship, but honestly I'm just happy that I've found somebody I have a lot in common with."
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,AdventuresInSolitude,3,Fri Jun 26 06:50:49 2015 UTC,It sucks trying to talk to people when you have no life experience.
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,GreenSkyFish,2,Fri Jun 26 11:54:40 2015 UTC,"That's kind of an interesting paradox isn't it? Talking to people is how you make friends or perhaps even meet a prospective partner, which all lead to you DOING more things which get you life experience.   While it may suck and be uncomfortable early on, all practice is good practice."

ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,oliviabix,2,Sat Jun 27 02:59:35 2015 UTC,"You sound just like me. I think this is the reason I haven't tried any dating sites at all. It's worked out somewhat for some of my coworkers, but I'm still just way too terrified of it. I'm so used to being by my lonesome, I don't think I would know what to do or say if someone actually happened to like my profile back. I'd be too nervous to even open up my messages to see what they said, good or bad!   I never had a problem with that kind of thing in the past, but, ugh, nowadays, I get scared when I see messages in my inboxes. I think I get worried it's going to be something really negative, so a lot of the time, I don't read the message. I have probably missed out on a lot of good ones that way.   I don't know what it is, either. Why that changed for me. Back in college, I would talk to strangers on the internet, no problem. I made a ton of online friends. Now I'm just scared people are going to say awful things, so I either immediately mark messages as read without reading them, or I just don't read them.  I want to say it started when, paradoxically, nothing showed up in my inbox when I'd post something on, say, FB or whatever. I started assuming people thought I was annoying or not worth paying attention to and that if they actually commented on something I posted, it was to tell me to stop because no one cares. This has translated into thinking that if I were to create a profile on any given dating site, I'd either get zero messages or I'd get nasty ones making fun of me or telling me to get off the site.   That or messages like those in /r/CreepyPMs. I severely don't want to encounter any of those, so that's another reason I've never made any profiles.   sigh I want to be brave enough. But my pessimism and anxiety always get the best of me. :("
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,neko,1 point,Sat Jun 27 08:51:04 2015 UTC,"On both OkC (the quick match 'like' function) and Tinder you can't tell who has swiped right or 'liked' you unless you have also said you liked them. I like this as nobody knows whether the person they said yes to rejected them or just didn't see their profile.   The exception to this is OkCs A-list function, where you pay to see who likes you. I don't think that's particularly popular, from why I've heard (though it likely varies between areas)."

Like I had someone in my high school who was like trying to run away with the gym teacher to start a new life together. I just say that story and ask them if they've have a story that's fucked up like that. I mean it's just an example, but it beats talking about GOT or the type of music you like.  Idk lmao that's probably a terrible example, you'd like instantly get called weird don't do it.

ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,heelsintothedirt,8,Mon Jun 29 17:32:33 2015 UTC,"I went on a date with someone I met from OKCupid. Everything went okay, but it wasn't amazing. I decided to go on a second date with him anyway because I was super lonely and pretty stupid around that time. I met him at his house upon his request, and was pretty shocked by what I saw. He was a hoarder, big time - as bad as anything you'd see on TV. I didn't say anything mean or rude whatsoever, but I couldn't help but have a slightly stunned reaction when I saw how bad it was. He was offended before I even said anything, immediately started saying he could tell I thought I was better than him and our date was off. So I also found out he had a very bad temper that day, too.  I deleted my account that evening and basically decided I was done with online dating, but I should probably give it another chance since I work at home, live in a small town, and have few ways of really meeting people."

I ended up with a second date maybe half the time and had third dates with maybe 5% of the original sample. Then nothing. So I don't think I am going to find a relationship through online dating. If I try again, it will be when I lose weight but I should probably try to give myself a makeover to be more attractive. I dress kind of plain."
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,caretaker81,3,Fri Jun 26 03:04:36 2015 UTC,"I'm a guy, but I have used them both, so I'll give you my perspective.  Tinder: I only get a match about once a week, I like about 30% of the girls I see there, maybe 20 girls per day. In other words, very low success rate. I did however meet one girl a few months ago, that turned into a great relationship.  Okcupid: No girls contact me here, it's all on me to contact them. Didn't really have a lot of luck there either. I met one or two girls though, which turned out pretty well.   I think they're both really inefficient for the work I put into them, so I have a lot more success approaching women in real life. I don't recommend online stuff."
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,Human-Clad-Monster,3,Thu Jun 25 22:17:56 2015 UTC,"As a guy, stay away from Tinder/OKCupid. There is just too much competition. Lots of effort writing messages, nearly no responce to be expected.  As a girl, stay away from Tinkder/OKCupid. Your inbox will be filled with junk messages and too much effort to sort out the worthy ones."
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,GreenSkyFish,3,Mon Jun 29 11:02:32 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, I kind of have a long history of creating and then deleting profiles on OkCupid. When I first started I wasn't sure what I wanted so listed myself as looking for other women but that didn't really go anywhere and I lost interest in it. Next time around I switched to guys but found out I was too scared/nervous to actually message anyone or even reply to the few messages I got so I gave up for a while.   My most recent attempt a few months ago went a tiny bit better since my anxiety has improved slightly where I can at least reply most of the time. So I did manage to exchange a few messages with a couple guys but.. I don't know, maybe it's just me but I don't like the pressure of dating sites (or just the ""dating game/scene"" in general). It felt like some of the guys were kind of in a rush to meet up in person and I move at a glacial pace with this stuff so it was kind of too much too soon for me.  In the end I just don't think dating sites are right for me for several different reasons.. They seem more like they're made for people that are interested in casual hook ups and stuff. Maybe if my anxiety was under control I'd feel more comfortable with the idea of actually meeting up with people. I'm not at that point right now (might never be) and prefer to take things slow and get to know someone as a friend first.  Kind of related: I found that one of the guys that messaged me on OKC also happens to posts sometimes in /ForeverAloneDating/, just a little surprised to see him on here too. I kinda want to message him again because he seems like my type but eh, it didn't really go so well the first time.. conversation died instantly pretty much. He would probably think I'm stalking him or something anyway sigh."
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,LilacMoon9,3,Fri Jun 26 17:29:56 2015 UTC,"Just a suggestion about that specific concern of guys wanting to meet up quickly...  I've seen this piece of advice given to men on a NUMBER of different sites/subs, to basically ask to meet up earlier on. I guess the rationale behind the advice is that it's easier to fade away if you keep messaging back and forth, but if you meet in person it sort of speeds up the process and you can interact with the other person in 3D and all that. I think meeting up within a week or so of talking (or relatively early on) actually IS the norm.   However, I actually feel the same way as you. The only difference is that I'm a guy. I have some social anxiety when it comes to women, and prior to the girl I'm dating now, I had never even gone on dates so the idea of meeting up was...akin to climbing a mountain.  In fact, I didn't want to meet up. We talked for months...until SHE mentioned wanting to meet up. That's how 'glacial' I am, to use your term.   What my point is, is that I'm not the only guy like this. It's totally normal for you to want to wait longer until you feel more secure in meeting up with a guy. It's the most normal thing in the world. You should never let anyone guy or girl pressure you into meeting up if you aren't 100% comfortable with it.  I think something that could really help you is if in the early stages of talking to someone or if they bring up the idea of meeting, you express assertively right then and there that you usually wait a while until you're comfortable before meeting up. This may cause some guys to lose interest or fade away, but the ones that you probably want to meet are the ones who won't be deterred by that. Just my thoughts."
ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,GreenSkyFish,3,Sat Jun 27 01:57:04 2015 UTC,"I have used OK Cupid (and some other sites) but not Tinder. OKC was okay, I did express what I was looking for but I don't think some of the guys read what I wrote. I got messages just for sex/hook-ups when I said I don't want that. A lot of the messages seemed creepy, ""Oh you are so beautiful, let's bang"" (but used other language) made me very uncomfortable. I ended up deleting my account. That was just the guys in my area, I'm not saying that will happen to other people.  3 years ago, I did write to some guys that had high % on Match . com, but I never got anything back. One guy wrote me first, but he had a lot of things that I said no to (smoking, drinking, lived 2 hours away) so our % was low. He seemed nice, so I agreed to meeting up. He was a good friend, but we were definitely not compatible. Still, I am glad I took the time to meet up with him those 5 times. It was nice to get out and have some fun with another person, even though it didn't work out. I have no ill will towards him, he is happily engaged now and he is a nice guy, so good for him."

ForeverAloneWomen,3b4i7w,FAWinner,4,Fri Jun 26 13:34:27 2015 UTC,"It's a long story.   First is Tinder. When it first came out and it was all the rage, I couldn't use it as I didn't have data. One of my friends made an account for me on his phone as sort of a half-joke type thing. I didn't expect to get any hits given it was a hook-up app for the most part with a great deal of emphasis on physical appearance (at least it seemed to me). Well, I actually got quite a few matches. Not a crazy amount, but certainly more than I had expected (<2). That kind of...boosted my confidence. It led to me giving OKC (not a dating site with an emphasis on hook-ups) another try.  I had used OKC a long time in the past with no success. Several months ago I decided to try again. Not much real success and so I started looking to just make some female friends instead to get over my anxiety and inexperience around women. I would message girls and tell them that I was just interested in friendship at the moment. Interestingly, I started to get more actual replies to my messages.   Well anyway, there was one person that I talked to for quite a few months. We decided to meet up...realized our chemistry online extended to real life, and that first date ended up leading to my first/current relationship! Son in that sense...I suppose I have 100% accuracy on OKC."

Over 50% of my messages are random carpet bombing for sex, but you can tell the nicer guys from their profile content and actual message effort (if it's them messaging you).   I have mine set up so that the only questions I answered with a strong opinion on their answering were the serious homophobic/racist/jerk ones, so anyone I have an 'enemy' rating with I can just immediately exclude (as they must have given a racist/homophobic/massive-jerk answer to something)."

The only problem is that it seems to have some problem with where I live vs. where it thinks I live, so it brings up results 'near me' for places that are not near me, but that's more of a technical difficulty.  I've sent out some messages and haven't had anything back, most of the messages I get are of the ""how to make a woman uncomfortable in five words or less"" type, but if I was more dedicated to it maybe I would get results. I go through phases of feeling confident enough to look around on there and then phases of getting super-paranoid and shy about everything, but it feels sort of low-commitment enough that it's okay if I drop off from it from a few weeks, or check every day, or whatever I feel like doing."

ForeverAloneWomen,3aspzq,Mlwxnb,6,Thu Jun 25 18:05:00 2015 UTC,"It is natural I suppose. As an asocial you are used to being different, to being on the sidelines of the common social games, and it becomes some kind of an identity, it can become a comfort somehow (as a survival reaction to make daily life bearable, boosted by self-pity). Someone similar pops up and suddenly you have to share the social non-space that, as lame it is, is usually yours alone. Pretty disturbing.  Or maybe, to look at it differently, another FA showing up is basically a mirror imposed to you, showing you things about yourself that you'd rather not see.   It's also a stranger who can see right through you. Unpleasant as hell.  At the end of day, being around normal people is actually more comfortable, because they can't really empathize with you, as they only have a distant idea of what your life is. Mostly, they just don't care enough to consider any of it, which is the easiest scenario.   I don't know, just throwing thoughts based on my own perception. This sounds very depressing I guess, but at the same time reading this sub for example feels really heart-warming to me. FAs can be a comfort to each other, just not too close and personal."

ForeverAloneWomen,3aspzq,TranceKing,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:18:42 2015 UTC,"Well, I know some don't, and those don't particularly bother me.  It's the other ones I'm not sure about.  I always sound very loud to myself, even when I'm just posting words on the screen, and I want to tell myself to shut up.  I can't imagine other people don't feel the same."
ForeverAloneWomen,3aspzq,Naveb,1 point,Tue Jun 23 07:19:24 2015 UTC,"Yes. I too feel that other FA's will not like me if they interact with me. It's not their fault, though. I have many unlikeable qualities. But I had thought that maybe we would get along a bit better because of our situation."
ForeverAloneWomen,3aryt9,coralya,7,Tue Jun 23 01:00:43 2015 UTC,"I'm in my 30s, and rather than getting more desperate, I am actually much less desperate than I was in my crushingly lonely early 20s. I wouldn't date someone I didn't like just for the sake of dating. And I most definitely wouldn't pair off just for the sake of pairing off.  Maybe if you're a real people person who is good at getting along with anyone, dating someone you're not all that into could work, but I've got no illusions about myself. I couldn't be content with just anyone, and I'd probably make the other person unhappy too."
ForeverAloneWomen,3aryt9,-lost-at-sea-,19,Tue Jun 23 11:51:10 2015 UTC,Never. It isn't fair to the other person and I'm not sure I could live a lie like that.
ForeverAloneWomen,3aryt9,LurkLurkleton,7,Tue Jun 23 01:41:10 2015 UTC,Sadly I'm at the point where it's difficult for me to imagine not having any feelings towards anyone who's a good person.
ForeverAloneWomen,3aryt9,fiddlingUnicorn,9,Tue Jun 23 07:48:04 2015 UTC,"Probably never.   When I was 23 and feeling particularly sorry for myself, I vowed that I would sleep with anyone... be with anyone... if I was 25 and still alone.   Well I'm 27 now and nothing has changed, I don't think I could be with someone if I didn't at least like them just a little bit... it would be annoying."
ForeverAloneWomen,3aryt9,agirlwhonevergoesout,5,Tue Jun 23 01:11:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think I will, because I have a feeling it will make me sadder, and neither do I want to ruin someone else's life."

ForeverAloneWomen,3aryt9,Aaaandiiii,1 point,Fri Jun 26 18:51:32 2015 UTC,"I'd consider it right now, but I probably couldn't make myself do it in the end unless things had changed and I began to feel for him in the 11th hour, but that only happens in love stories.  I think the only instance I'd likely do something like that is if it was an arranged marriage of convenience and both parties had the same apathy. But that too is something far removed from me."

ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,herewegoaga1n,7,Tue Jun 23 16:47:17 2015 UTC,"There's a chart for this somewhere. Tall men get the most advantage when it comes to dating. Tall women get the ahem ""short end of the stick"" so to speak."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,2,Tue Jun 23 17:00:21 2015 UTC,sigh I know this all too well
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,Bullmozer,2,Tue Jun 23 17:12:18 2015 UTC,"That's because being short is considered a feminine trait in our society, thus why they're mocked by men taller than themselves and women of all heights. Being short as a man is almost exclusively a bad thing, aside from more leg room on air planes perhaps. They even make less money on average than tall men."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,3,Tue Jun 23 18:24:58 2015 UTC,Most tall women aren't too bothered about dating guys the same height or a bit shorter than them. It's short girls (5'5>) that have preferences for tall guys (6'<).  I'm not even that tall (5'8) and it's a real struggle. Most tall guys want short girls unfortunately.

ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:06:36 2015 UTC,Personally I would prefer taller.
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,1 point,Wed Jun 24 02:11:40 2015 UTC,"Um, okay then. Everyone has preferences, and most short guys don't want a girl that is taller than them.   I'm tall and think thin so look taller than I am, so I'd look ridiculous with a short guy, plus there are other things to consider. My preference is for taller guys and I'm not complaining.   Tall girls have it tough, and unless you've walked in my shoes you wouldn't know. You should look at my other posts then you'd understand.  You guys in this sub are so quick to attack."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,agnoth,-1,Wed Jun 24 07:06:14 2015 UTC,Not so!  Head over to /r/tall and see how much admiration for tall women there is.

ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,2,Tue Jun 23 19:28:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah but that's in your experience. As a slim teenage girl, us tall skinny girls get no luck.   It's all culture based as well; in my culture petite girls are more appreciate. As, as a black girl, you need to have curves otherwise you're fucked. Model types are almost NEVER appreciated.  Also, don't swear, there's no need."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,1 point,Tue Jun 23 19:47:18 2015 UTC,"Do you live in an African country or a western country? If the latter, then the simple solution is to date the men who do appreciate your body type, who are legion. You're just a teenager? You're clearly in an angsty stage of your life, and boys are immature at your age. Trust me, it'll get better as you get older.  It is not my mere experience, but the experience of all the men I know and the women who see more attention. Thinner women between 5' 6' and 5'10' get by far the most attention and have the most success."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,Bullmozer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 01:44:52 2015 UTC,"Western country but I want to date black men/ boys, unfortunately they're not interested in me but that's my preference.   Yeah I know I'm young but it's extremely depressing when other people your age have been in 5/6 relationships already. People aren't even interested in me. It sucks.   I can count on my hands the amount of times I've seen people show interest, but they don't approach me, only look."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,2,Wed Jun 24 07:05:13 2015 UTC,"Hm, have you thought of getting into weighttraining? That's a healthy way to gain weight. I know that there are many subreddits dedicated to women's fitness here on Reddit.  I will say thought that it is much better to be thinner than the alternative in the long run. You will age much more gracefully and will be more desirable as you get older. It's only uphill from here."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,createanewaccountuse,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:55:56 2015 UTC,Trying to put on weight is a struggle; I just don't think I have the body type to. I don't eat that much nowadays but back when I used to eat loads of protein I still stayed the same.   Also I'm 119lbs at 5'8 so I'm a bit of a stick.
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,createanewaccountuse,2,Wed Jun 24 16:59:45 2015 UTC,"Calories in, calories out. Simply eating lots of protein is not enough. You need to be eating more in general when you are exercising and trying to build muscle mass."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,DrowningInRealism,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:04:49 2015 UTC,"To expand on that as somebody studying medicine, there is no such thing as not having the body type to gain weight. Everyone will gain mass (fat or muscle depending on one's activity) if eating enough. It's fundamental science."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,trail22,1 point,Wed Jun 24 17:45:03 2015 UTC,"Plus tall women are fetishized (not saying it's a good thing but it happens) a ton in the media.   In my experience the people who obsess most over their partners height are women, maybe not (hopefully) ones that are FA though."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ard6x,Earcandles69,2,Wed Jun 24 18:02:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for most men height is an afterthought for women they are pursuing.   If anything, there is a preference for women in that 'model range' of 5 6 to 5 10, not for short women.   I will admit though that above around 6 feet, height can starting being a disadvantage for women. That applies to only a tiny tiny percentage of women, though."

ForeverAloneWomen,3anhty,IIMasonator117II,7,Sun Jun 21 23:18:12 2015 UTC,Good idea. There is also a foreveralone kik chat and IRC I believe.    P.S. It would be funny if it ends up only men posting in this thread in the FAwomen subreddit.
ForeverAloneWomen,3anhty,LurkLurkleton,4,Mon Jun 22 02:32:35 2015 UTC,"Maybe we can squeeze into one comment tree :P  There are people here who I would be happy to chat with. Unfortunately, there are also a handful of people who I would definitely not want to chat with because they're super creepy. For that reason, I am not comfortable with going on the IRC, where everyone is anonymous and anyone can listen in. (Obviously that's true here too, but a conversation is different from posting on reddit because here I can take the time to review my posts before submitting them.)  Also, I feel like many people on this sub would not welcome a PM from some random guy asking for a chat, and let's be honest, I'd probably feel too awkward to send one anyway."
ForeverAloneWomen,3anhty,uh-okay-I-guess,2,Mon Jun 22 05:39:19 2015 UTC,"For that reason, I am not comfortable with going on the IRC, where everyone is anonymous and anyone can listen in.   I get that - however, don't hesitate to drop by once in a while, it's a really good way to talk with the regular posters :)   It's not always super active but it's moderated like in here, and we usually kick the lurkers out. If you ever receive a creepy message on irc or on this sub, let the moderators know and we'll look into it."
ForeverAloneWomen,3anhty,FAWmod,7,Mon Jun 22 20:37:58 2015 UTC,"I'm always happy to respond to messages and chat with people, but I wanted to say that this is a great idea to not only practice conversation but perhaps even make friends.  There are some who may think that talking online isn't the same as talking in person. That is certainly true in some ways, but talking to people online is still social interaction. It's easier to some, but for a lot even talking online is a harrowing task.   My breakthrough for my social anxiety came as a result of my experience posting on a number of forums and chatting with others. I had pretty severe social anxiety, and struggled to talk to others or make an impression on them. However, I had a very active social life on the internet/forums. In fact, I was actually really popular on the forums I used. That's when I started to think...if my posts online are just extensions of my real personality/thoughts, and if people LIKE me online...then there's no reason they wouldn't like me in person either! To that end, I slowly started to talk to people more, express my opinion more often, just get more practice. That's when I really started to get out of my shell a little."

ForeverAloneWomen,3anhty,chaosakita,3,Mon Jun 22 15:11:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I like that idea! I'm fairly new on Reddit, but I've also looked at related subs where people post about wanting chat buddies--That could also be a place to reach out.

ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,rainbowsblehhh,5,Sun Jun 21 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"I'm the same, I'm terrible at conversations.

ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,Armon2010,7,Fri Jun 26 03:32:17 2015 UTC,"Often times, when the topic of ""what traits do women find attractive in men"" comes up, three characteristics are almost universally agreed upon:  Intelligence, Sense of Humor, and Conversational Skills.  These happen to be some of my biggest weaknesses.    Intelligence- I don't think I'm unintelligent per se.  I just don't feel that my intellectual strengths are focused on ""romantically useful"" areas, if that makes sense.    Sense of Humor- I'm not a humorless dork or anything like that.  I'm fully capable of finding humor in certain situations and laughing.  My issue is that I can't consistently make others laugh.  I'm just not an inherently funny guy. I think this kind of ties into the intelligence thing I mentioned before.    Conversational Skills- I'm not good at maintaining long and interesting conversations.  I can do well for the first 20-30 minutes, covering the basics, but after that, things tend to get pretty awkward.  I think that this also ties into the intelligence thing I mentioned."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,lnys,10,Sun Jun 21 18:55:54 2015 UTC,"Well, looks would be the biggest thing, but I'm working on it.   I wouldn't be a good match for a guy who likes to go out, party or drink a lot. I don't like to go out much, I don't like loud music or nightclubs and I like to drink but not in a club or whatever.   I'm judgmental and if I find he has stupid hobbies or braindead friends (the frat boy or consumerist types who can only speak about cars/big screen tv and shit like that), I won't bother trying to join cause I'll most likely be a buzzkill.  I can't offer him all of my time cause I need to be alone a good chunk of time a day, to read and all.  I have only one friend so no big group of friends to introduce him to, but I think few people actually give a crap about that."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,AdventuresInSolitude,6,Sun Jun 21 19:34:36 2015 UTC,"The biggest thing I don't have to offer is conversational skills. I'm usually the person in a group who just smiles and nods at what other people have to say. I almost never just text people asking them how they're doing. And I'm horrible at responding to texts right away. Plus there's my shyness/social anxiety, which makes me seem really standoffish and cold when I'm meeting new people.  Next biggest would be experience with intimacy and anything physical. I'm willing to learn lol, but I'm sure most people my age would see that as a red flag.  Other things include no car/license (though I'm working on that!), still live with my family, can barely cook, prefer to stay sober, few friends, generally just a lazy person who spends most of the time on her phone..."

Looks aside, which isn't anything anyone can help, I'm not one of those people who can be cheerful all the time. I'm not even one of those people that can be strong all the time.  I think in our heart we all long for someone we can depend on when things happen. I always read stories about strong women surviving and getting through it all.   I don't think i can be one of those."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,queenofglum,6,Mon Jun 22 00:04:54 2015 UTC,"Ok I'll go. I don't offer much in the way of appearances, but I'm not that ugly either. I'm a terrible conversation partner, I'm very quiet and never know what to say. I'm not interesting, I spend pretty much all my time in my room on my computer (unless you somehow find that interesting). I don't get out much so if you someone to go to lots of exciting places with, I'm not that person. I'm not a particularly happy person either, and I'm prone to anxiety."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,rainbowsblehhh,6,Sun Jun 21 18:34:17 2015 UTC,"It's not that I don't have anything to offer. It's just that what I have is not enough to differentiate myself from everyone else. My stats are okay, but not stellar. I'm college educated, but only a bachelor's. I have a stable, respectable job, but I'm not particularly passionate about it.   Even my hobbies are kinda boring according to the lovely people of okcupid. I'm good at cooking, but it's a skill learned out of necessity because I have to eat everyday and I don't like wasting money on takeout. That and I eat mostly plant based aka vegan, so life is much easier if I just prepare my own food. I love doing yoga, but most people think I just stretch and roll around the floor for 60 minutes and cannot fathom why I would subject myself to such a boring activity. So yeah, I guess I'm pretty boring.  I also have some pretty glaring deal breakers for most guys. If anyone ever found out my history of depression and self harm that resulted in multiple hospitalizations, they would probably make a run for it. I don't blame them though. Also, I don't want kids. That is something I would never be able to offer a man."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,melodrake,3,Mon Jun 22 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I wonder if non-yoga people judge when they see others carrying a yoga mat around, haha. I started doing yoga partly because I didn't have a lot of stamina (I'm kinda anemic), and it's good exercise that doesn't require over-exertion. And being able to cook is always great; like you I think it's a good way to save money (although not necessarily time). When I have too much free time I'd sometimes look for and try out nice-sounding recipes that require cheap and easily obtainable ingredients. And if you bake, you could share whatever you made with whoever and they'd usually appreciate it, even if you messed up a little.   So no, I don't think your hobbies boring. Then again I'm probably pretty boring myself, heh."

I can cook basic stuff but don't really like to that much, I think that'd be different if I lived out of home. Don't really like doing housework very much.

ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,JDNow,1 point,Mon Jun 22 20:36:27 2015 UTC,What about oral? There are guys who prefer that and would be happy without PIV sex if they could still satisfy and be satisfied by their partner. There are guys who would be happy with no physical intimacy at all. Just not as many.

Can't offer stable income, in case he cared about that. Can't offer someone who nerdily knows everything about one subject.  Can't offer the patience to listen to you go on and on about it. Can't offer someone who drinks. Can't offer someone who's going to hop into bed with you right away."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,uh-okay-I-guess,2,Mon Jun 22 18:28:49 2015 UTC,"The few I can think of off the top of my head:   Appearance. I'm average looking and will never be a stunner. Physical limitations. Due to my autoimmune disorder, I can't do certain things for long periods of time, like I can't go out in the sun for over an hour. I can't eat a lot of food, I get sick so I can't go out to restaurants.  Conversation skills. I'm shy and sometimes my anxiety gets the best of me. I blush and can get embarrassed easily. It does get better once I get comfortable with a guy, though. Children. I think that ship is sailing if he wants his own biological offspring. I'm 30 and do not want to even try for kids after 35, due to all the risks. There's always adoption if that time ever comes, i guess."

I'm an introvert. I need a lot of alone time. (But at least during the time we spend together, I won't be on my phone.) I can't offer a whole new social group of fascinating friends for you to meet. I can't offer an insatiable appetite for exciting adventures. I'm not a big guy. I can't pick you up and carry you over my shoulder."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,coralya,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:42:31 2015 UTC,"I don't really like it either. OP said it could be helpful, but I know a lot of the users here have issues in regards to how they look. Just focusing or thinking about that is more likely to just cause rumination rather than motivate change...  Additionally, the way that the question is posed is very suggestive and self-deprecating. There's a significant difference between OP's question and something like, ""What are qualities of yourself that you could change that would make you a better partner?"""
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,my-other-account-,3,Sun Jun 21 20:22:29 2015 UTC,"Sure, if the qualities are changeable.  If you take all the qualities I listed above and reverse them (make me a 6'2"" extrovert with lots of friends and a lust for adventure) I would definitely not be FA -- except it wouldn't actually be me anymore."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,my-other-account-,1 point,Sun Jun 21 20:58:16 2015 UTC,"That's exactly my point though, what is the function of talking about things that we can't really change that much (i.e. height, introversion/extroversion)?  Whereas if the topic focused instead on things that people may not feel great about that can be changed like ""I'm not good at conversation,"" or ""I feel like I have no interesting hobbies,"" both of those can be addressed and people make suggestions."
ForeverAloneWomen,3amd1u,callmeunicorn,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, I knew that this wouldn't be a very helpful or positive post. I just saw the post from yesterday and thought it would be interesting to get a view from the other side. I do tend to be self deprecating to myself so I guess that's why I phrased it that way."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,Prisaneify,11,Sun Jun 21 01:45:15 2015 UTC,"He totally does sound like a pretty mean/cruel person from what you've described.  Having said that, if I may express my honest opinion for a second...I have a feeling that Craigslist for the most part attracts a certain subset of people. I've seen many of the dating ads for both men and women in my city, a lot of it is pretty questionable and the majority of it seemed to be interested in a FWB type of arrangement.  There's nothing necessarily wrong with what you're seeking, but I just don't think Craigslist would be the best/safest place to look. OKC, or hell even Tinder might garner you more success. OR Reddit too actually on the R4R subs perhaps."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,GreenSkyFish,2,Sun Jun 21 03:16:40 2015 UTC,I agree with this Craiglist is kind of full of people who are questionable. :/ You didn't deserve this anyway.
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,Toridon88,2,Sun Jun 21 09:24:23 2015 UTC,"I agree with you. It was a super lonely moment and I've had bad luck on all of those sites.  His whole attitude changed in the span of 2 hours. He was incredibly nice, never asked or pushed for anything. Was super excited to meet me, and then BAM this BS.  I won't be trying this scenario anymore. I'm happy sitting at home and reading and cross stitching quite honestly."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,enhancedmuppet,8,Sun Jun 21 16:26:51 2015 UTC,"Sounds like you dodged a bullet, lending to much weight to the actions of assholes can weigh you down."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,coralya,3,Sun Jun 21 04:48:46 2015 UTC,"Some people are so bizarre about texting. I've heard stories these this before. It seems to be a weirdly pervasive thing to expect people to respond to your texts immediately, and get extremely offended if they don't.  If I encounter someone who expects me to respond to texts or any kind of messages right away, I figure they either are unemployed or don't take their job seriously. How else are you going to be available to answer texts immediately at all times?"
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,callmeunicorn,3,Sun Jun 21 06:19:57 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this. I'm in the same boat. When I DID happen to hop on a dating site, my specifications for a guy were clear. 30-35 males. I wanted someone close to my age to hopefully weed out SOME immaturity. I had this 22 year old guy message me and I was polite and responded but then when he asked for my number I responded no and he told me I was a major cunt.... Exactly my point in why I don't want to date younger people.  I'm sorry you are receiving such hateful texts. No one deserves these.  The IRL stuff doesn't ever work for me. I don't ever get approached, by anyone. Which is okay I suppose. I'm over getting hurt. I love my house, I love my hobbies and here no one can hurt me.   This was kind of my last ditch effort to even make a friend. It just isn't in the cards for me."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,Stenodactylus,5,Sun Jun 21 11:46:15 2015 UTC,"That is just awful. Please know his actions have no reflection on you. Don't try to fill in the unknowns with assumptions that lead you to feel badly about yourself. Aside from all that, woman to woman I think that the Craigslist idea isn't such a good one. I think that you are 99.9% likely to connect with people who are very strange and/or have bad intentions toward you. It's not safe emotionally or literally. I know, to each her own, I'm not judging... just wanted to give you my advice in case it saves you from some heartache or danger in the future."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,LurkLurkleton,1 point,Sun Jun 21 16:38:45 2015 UTC,"The rational part of me knows this. The lonely part of me though figured it was at least worth a shot. Every male I come across has wanted nothing more than sex from me. I don't ever get approached in real life and dating sites are of course for just dating, which I don't want to do so I turned to the only place that might be acceptable for my situation."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,LurkLurkleton,8,Sun Jun 21 06:00:48 2015 UTC,"I totally agree with you. It was so unnecessary and uncalled for. The only good thing that came afterwards was that I was crying at the breakfast restaurant I went to, a nice stranger lady came over to me and was like "" I don't know what is wrong, but I just wanted to give you a hug"" and did.. it made me cry even more but it was so nice."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,NameRetrievalError,5,Sun Jun 21 16:30:33 2015 UTC,Did you respond at all to his morning text? He might have thought you flaked out and weren't going to show. Craigslist is notorious for that.   I think telling someone to fuck off and not ever contact you again because of what seems to be a scheduling miscommunication may have been an over reaction.
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,NameRetrievalError,2,Sun Jun 21 02:00:45 2015 UTC,"Hmm, never heard of something like that. Sorry that person was a jerk to you. Is advertising for a cuddle buddy really a thing? I could imagine a lot of guys seeing that as an ""in"" no matter what the disclaimer."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,Naveb,2,Sun Jun 21 02:18:05 2015 UTC,"It is a real thing for me. I don't know about anyone else. I don't really think it needs to be ""a thing"" for someone out there to want that sort of a thing. More of an exception to the rule."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:57:18 2015 UTC,"When I say ""is that really a thing"" is just another way of asking if that's something that is commonly done. I meant no offense."

I try to do some good in this world, mainly through my love of books but I have a lot of other mental issues as well."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,1 point,Sun Jun 21 18:31:41 2015 UTC,"having seen you, i can tell you that you probably have no idea how many guys think you're super cute, and would never let on because they're certain you wouldn't be interested. i'm sorry you met a crazy person online, but that guy seriously missed out."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,-1,Wed Jun 24 01:11:57 2015 UTC,"Whilst no one deserves cruelty I feel that you don't really understand men much.  You want a man fort everything except sex.  Yet sex is what men like the most.  It's like giving someone a job but not offering to pay them anything.    You can't expect intimacy, romance, commitment or whatever without giving him what he wants most.  It's about give and take.    I can't see huge success for you in the future if this is your attitude to men and relationships."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,4,Wed Jun 24 20:31:54 2015 UTC,"OP advertised for a cuddle buddy and not a date or a fuck buddy so she was honest. If people want more than that, they're free not to answer her ad. By answering to it they agree to these terms."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,3,Thu Jun 25 04:10:02 2015 UTC,"Yes that's fine.  I'm not criticizing OP per se.  It's just saying up front ""no sex so don't even try"" isn't going to get many positive outcomes.    I would advise women to hold off on sex, be careful who you get intimate with but don't say ""no sex no sex no sex"" if you ever want it to go anywhere.  However if the woman in question really does hate sex and never wants it, then yes be honest about it.  (But don't expect a long queue)."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,Naveb,2,Sun Jun 21 23:20:39 2015 UTC,"It's just saying up front ""no sex so don't even try"" isn't going to get many positive outcomes.    It might not on a dating website, but then again, she didn't post on one. It's like you seem to assume that she's looking for an already ""friendzoned"" guy or something.  Personally I don't get cuddle buddies or fwb or many ""modern"" arrangements, however I think that as long as you're honest with your intentions from the beginning, no one can accuse you of being unreasonable or tell you something along the lines of ""that's why they flaked"". No, that's not - that guy was clearly interested by this cuddling session, and there seems to have been a big misunderstanding with one waiting to have a confirmation text and the other thinking they didn't need to send one. That's pretty much it."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,thedonkdonk,2,Sun Jun 21 23:35:23 2015 UTC,"Well, that's OP's prerogative to consider having sex or not - it's kind of off topic. If cuddle buddies exist, it's clearly cause there is a demand for it."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,3,Sun Jun 21 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"You don't know that, and how is that ""rightful"" of them? If you reply to an ad saying ""I just want to watch a movie with someone"" and you try to fuck them anyway, how is that rightful? It's a lame move, and it's dishonest. If you want to do that, you just go on a sex ad website or any corner of reddit/craigslist/okcupid and you're done. It's a lot of work to ""try"" with someone who expressed clearly that they're not into casual sex.  Also, I don't buy into the ""all men are sex obsessed"" reddit mantra, since I think it's harmful both ways. It teaches women to be on their guard, and that ANY male-female interaction is driven by that, and then men complain that women are guarded even when they have non-sexual intentions."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,2,Mon Jun 22 18:25:58 2015 UTC,"Of course, there are RARE exceptions to this rule, such as a man who has chronically low testosterone or something like that.   So you think ALL women, really ALL of them are attractive to ALL straight men? Come on. You never met a woman you didn't find attractive? Either you're like a horny teen either you only think/recall cute girls you were already into, which is very common. EDIT: once someone here linked me that pic, tell me know that ALL of these women would entice ALL straight men they get in contact with: http://i.imgur.com/EsOwgTg.jpg  For the cuddle buddies shit, to be honest, I find that shitty yeah, if you want to fuck someone, go on an appropriate sub/website, don't try to stick it into someone's under false pretenses.

I had male friends, I lived with dudes, I'm unattractive as fuck and still, STILL not every man around is just a drooling beast hooked up on Pornhub looking to get laid like the average redditor likes to paint them. I work with women who have male friends as well, so maybe it's an age thing, but for me you describe something very teenage-y.   Also, I don't know why you like to be so graphic once again, you really don't get that no one here likes to read about how you want to ""blast your load"" into someone's cervix or make them ""take your jizz bombs"". Know your audience, for fuck sake."
ForeverAloneWomen,3akeju,lnys,3,Mon Jun 22 18:18:31 2015 UTC,"Slow down with the graphic stuff, many users here are very uncomfortable with that kind of talk. You can still get your point across without it.  EDIT: I just read your other comments here, you should really check which sub you are on and what it is about, on the right hand side.  Most users here are not interested to read about how men only ""put up"" with women hoping that she'll receive his ""jizz bombs"" at some point. Consider yourself warned."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ak5g3,DrowningInRealism,9,Sun Jun 21 00:08:45 2015 UTC,"People are quick to say how catty and cruel girls are, but those people have never had to deal with how guys who don't find you attractive act. Girls usually have some sort of reason, no matter how petty, for starting crap with other girls. With guys its usually just my dick doesn't like you, so I think I'll make your life hell."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ak5g3,kellygreenkitty,5,Sun Jun 21 02:27:39 2015 UTC,"I dunno. I've seen women be pretty mean to ugly, geeky guys.   Maybe not a gender thing."
ForeverAloneWomen,3ak5g3,trail22,2,Sun Jun 21 05:46:09 2015 UTC,"I get that, I was bullied for years and for me, girls and boys did a different damage. Boys were very direct, aka running after me, shouting insults at me, ""fake"" asking me out before laughing in front of their mates, saying awful stuff in front of everyone, threatening to hit me.. Girls were more, well, not directly bullying me but not helping in any way; some pretended to befriend me when I could give them school stuff or carry their shit around, then dumping me when I thought I finally found a friend or two.   Your social anxiety is somehow ""logical"" but it doesn't make it less harmful. I'm not sure how old you are OP but let me tell you something: there are wonderful, really awesome people out there. Really. I never had a friend until I was like 14 when I met other outcasts, other girls who were also bullied.  And then later on I met a group of friends online and then IRL, and that's when I really connected to other people, men included. I discovered very nice people back then, men who had absolutely nothing vicious or mean or harmful, men who were very nice, fun to be around, who had creative hobbies (one was a graphic artist, a couple were musicians)... I went from being unable to be at ease around men to having week-ends together and sleep in the same room as them. Believe me, it took a lot to overcome the ""what if they're making fun of me"" feeling but it was worth it. This part of my life is behind me now, it's been for years actually but I don't regret it.   Men are not like reddit likes to paint them, aka either predators or bullies or poor sods. Men are not binary beings. I mean, I don't have male friends anymore cause I moved a lot and now work in a female environment, however I really like men as friends. I met some fantastic men over the years, guys who understood my issues, who were fun but gentle and not assholes one bit, and it was a very comforting thing to realize.   You can and will find people who are worth it, really, but you need to recognize that your SA protects you from further harm BUT also prevents you from meeting new people who might add something great to your life."

I'm the child of two people who are still in love (like, romantically still in love) after 35+ years, so I 100 percent believe it is possible.  I harbor a secret passion for video games.

Not that I'm a 50s housewife—my cooking isn't all that great—but that I have a good number of wifely skills and traits. I feel completely lacking in the ""fun girlfriend"" skill set, though, so my chances of ending up a wife were probably always low."

ForeverAloneWomen,3aia2n,uh-okay-I-guess,3,Mon Jun 22 15:19:24 2015 UTC,I agree.  Liking bungee jumping or traveling or going out to the club doesn't make you a fun person.  A fun partner is someone who can make you enjoy a 12-hour airplane flight with no electronics or books.

Also one of the reasons I don't complain about not having anyone be seriously interested in me. I don't know what I'd offer so it'd be pretty entitled of me to be upset about being alone.  I'm only partially motivated about any given task (I've been sporadically trying to work out, gain weight, fix my skin, and get a degree for the past like seven years). I'm a decent listener but that feels like a niceguy trait, not really something that's rare in relationships. I like to cook but I'm no pro. I'm kind of funny and light hearted most of the time. I'm mostly open to trying out new things but nothing too crazy that I could like immediately die from or be serially injured doing. I'm loyal so that's a pro, but again not rare, no one tries to date someone who they know will cheat on them.  That's all I can think of. Pretty pathetic. I don't know how relationships work or what each person usually offers the other aside from vague things like love, compassion, joy, etc."

I find it important to be aware of current events. I want to be socially, culturally, and politically aware. I'm educated, I like to learn, and I love to explore new things, whether it's a hobby, a place, or food. I like to cook and I think I'm quite decent at it. Although I'm an introvert and have some social anxiety, I actually do like people. I appreciate friendships and try to keep in touch with the few friends I do have. I don't rely on social media and I would prefer keeping touch in person rather than online. I don't like to be tethered to a phone, or any device for that matter. I think I have a fair degree of social intelligence and I know when silence is better than an awkward, forced conversation. I wouldn't expect an SO to worship me, nor would I be dependent upon him. I value my own independence. I enjoy simple things like getting coffee and listening to music. I think I have excellent taste in music and I have a deep appreciation for all art forms (visual arts, music, literature/writing).  I try to take care of myself by working out. I'm not overweight (although I could use some toning...working on it). I wear makeup and try to be decently fashionable. I'm at least average in looks (occasionally I'm told I'm pretty, but mostly by family, so I won't count that).  I'm by no means perfect and I struggle with my self-esteem a lot.

ForeverAloneWomen,3agwbo,Von-Val,1 point,Tue Jul 7 01:47:35 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry your life is so painful right now. I'd really like to offer you some assurance. As someone who's dealt with some pretty bad anxiety/depression episodes when things get really low, I'd like to say that I recognize a lot of what you're going through.   When you're anxious and depressed, it's very hard to assume that there are people who genuinely like you and want the best for you. You might even laugh at that thought. I know I still do on occasion.   I know you'll probably hate hearing this, but it sounds like you could use some psychological help. There's no shame in it. Having a counselor can be enormously helpful. They're paid to help give you insight on your life, especially lonely people like us who don't have much of a sounding board. Please look into seeing someone, I promise you it would do you a world of good. You'll probably find you're not nearly as crazy as you think. :)  It also sounds like you aren't doing very much to treat yourself, which is also compounding on your feelings of stress and worthlessness. You are worth nice things. Treating yourself to something nice every so often is congratulating yourself on your progress. You have a job and are saving money. That's progress! Take the time to congratulate yourself.  Is there something in life you're passionate about? Animals? Art? Robotics? Chewing gum? But seriously, you need something to be excited about outside of the general ""Gotta be independent no matter what!"" mindset. But what is it you want? What do you want to do? Find ways to get closer to whatever that is. You may find that quitting your awful job and staying at home may be a wise choice for a little longer if you need to re-evaluate things and choose a path that would make you happier. The fact that your family is even aware of your struggles means they are likely more sympathetic to your case than you'd think.  Sorry for the wall of text. The point is, this is your life and you live in the first world. The sky is the limit (I hate cliches, but I'm a terrible writer so they'll have to do) and once you realize you can choose the direction of your life (you may need some help to do this, which is fine, because it takes many people a very long time), and begin taking the steps necessary to find your happiness, you will be much more at peace."
ForeverAloneWomen,3agwbo,FAWmod,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:26:08 2015 UTC,"Hi there :) I gotta say, just reading your post, you seem to get me. Like you have, many people (well mostly people on reddit since no one really knows what I'm going through in real life) have told me I need therapy. And they're most likely right. The problems I'm facing with getting help is (a) I can't afford it (b) I hear it's hard to find therapists/psychologists who are covered by health insurance (c) my parents can't know about it (they don't understand/sympathize with people with mental illness). I feel like I might benefit from it since I tend to bottle my feelings, but it's really tough having to always lie. I wish there was a way I could get help without them knowing. Like you were saying, my family is aware of my struggles, but they are ashamed that I am this way. They want me to break out of my bad habits and anxiety by making me feel bad about it and not really helping in any way. They only know because some of my anxious habits are involuntary and I might do them in public without realizing. I wish they never knew about them because they only make me feel worse and more ashamed about them :/  Yeah. I always think I don't deserve the treat sometimes. I dislike spending my own money and feel super guilty afterwards. I also don't really like when others spend money on me. Sometimes I think if I lived on my own (i live with my parents now), I'd never buy enough groceries to properly feed myself because I'd be afraid to spend money. Or I'd feel self conscious of buying food and looking fat in the grocery store. Since I'm anxious a lot, stupid things like that would bother me. I do plan to try to treat myself more. I've been avoiding getting my hair cut or buying clothes for a while now. I hope to do those things in the next couple of weeks at least.   Hmmm..I'm not really sure what I'm passionate about. That's kind of been my problem for a long time. I've wanted so badly to have something to be excited about that gets me up in the mornings. But I just don't have it...and it's really frustrating to find that nothing really excites me to live. Having someone interested in me always made me excited but I realized that I must find happiness on my own somehow. But I haven't been able to do it. I mean, I have friends, 2 loving sisters, 2 nephews, a job...things I should be plenty grateful for which I am, but nothing really excites me. It sucks when people ask me what I'm interested in, or what I enjoy doing...I mean, i like what everyone else likes--music, movies, tv, reading, occasionally going to the gym. Nothing big or life-altering.I definitely have that independent mindset. It's just because I want to get away from my family. They cause me a lot of anxiety and stress and I just want to know what I would be like without them. It's like I am who I am because of them and I need to find out who I would be without them. Then maybe things will fall into place. I don't know. That's the only solution I've come up with to my problems. The thing is I still have to save a lot of money to move out so I could be here for a long time :/  Thank you for taking the time out of your day to respond and sorry for my late reply. I do truly believe I could choose my path. I'm just a little confused right now and feel trapped sometimes. Hopefully I can figure it out somehow. Sorry for the rant reply."
ForeverAloneWomen,3agwbo,fiodorson,2,Wed Jun 24 00:29:46 2015 UTC,"Hey there! Now it's my turn to apologize for the delayed response, lol. I know it's a long and complicated process to go through, but if you're under 26, you can still be on your family's health plan. You could also explore the Affordable Care package. Being insured can bring visits down to ~$30 or so, which is nice. I think a lot of insurance companies have become pretty amenable to mental health services, but then, I'm from a pretty liberal state, so it may be different where you are. Do you have a car btw? It sounds like you seem to have a pretty active life outside your home, so just ""going out"" for a few hours each month is hardly something most people even bat an eye at. I'm sorry about the paradoxical views of your parents, though. If they're so ""ashamed"" of your behavior, then they should know that supporting your decision to find help is the first step to helping you change for the better. Is your family's reluctance cultural?  I promise you, and I don't mean this in a mean way, people don't think about you nearly as much as you think they do. When YOU go to the grocery store, what do you do? I'm going to take a gigantic leap of faith and assume you look for food, you find the food, you buy the food, you leave. You may run into someone you know, but do you ever judge people for their food choices? Probably not, and even if you do, you probably forget about it the next day. They have food and so do you and that's all there is. As a former grocery store cashier, I can also assure you cashiers don't give a shit about your food choices. We just want to help you on your way so the next person with food can go, and so on, until the day ends, and we punch out. In short, people are very self-centered. This is both a good thing and a bad thing, but for your anxiety, this is a very good thing.  What about something you've always wanted to try picking up but were afraid to? Assuming that you don't spend very much on yourself, how about investing some money in a new skill? I don't think anyone could accuse you (even you) of being frivolous if you were investing in your mind. Any type of hobby is productive, btw, if only by the merit of confidence building.   Now you've got me rambling! :P But seriously, if you can't rant in your own reddit thread, where can you?"
ForeverAloneWomen,3agwbo,tyzbit,1 point,Fri Jun 26 21:02:30 2015 UTC,"I'm so sorry I thought of my response in my head and never wrote it. I definitely would have to do more research I guess about therapy. I'm from Canada actually, and there are some sliding scale therapists that I've read about but I'm still unsure. I don't have a car, so I would have to ask for the car from my parents and lie about where I'm going. I mean, it's not that big a deal, I typically lie to them anyway when I go out so it's nothing new. It's just because they are judgmental, strict and well, just plain mean. All that and they still act this way towards me even though I'm an adult with a full-time job, a career I'm pursuing and I've never done hard drugs, smoked cigarettes, etc. The reason why my parents are the way they are is complicated. Their parents were either non-existent (death before the age of 18) or complete deadbeats/mentally unstable. Thus, they never really knew what parenting was about. But I don't blame them. My mother keeps telling me when she sees something in the news, oblivious to that fact that I'm dealing with mental health issues, ""you never want to be mentally ill, you can never recover from that, it's uncurable. You're always crazy. No pills can change that."" It's these types of things that make me depressed and anxious and worse. It really sucks feeling so alone.  I like to think people don't think about me. I find it hard meeting the eyes of anyone I walk past because I don't want to see what's behind their eyes when they look at me. I just wish for once I could be good enough for someone. I wish someone would think I was pretty...it's such a pathetic need but I feel like it's just a fantasy. I wish I didn't care so much.   I'm sorry, I should have responded to this when I was in a better mood lol I just wish I had enough money to escape, to just be alone with my own thoughts to figure my life out. I feel so trapped and anxious here. Still, I'm afraid that if I ever move out I'll be lonely. Both my sisters moved out when they had steady boyfriends and had two incomes to afford a house. I won't have that. I'll be alone and trying to afford a place on my own with my student loans and low pay. I just feel worthless and alone and it sucks. It's hard to breathe sometimes. Not literally, but you know what I mean.   lol you wanted the rant, you got it! I appreciate your messages. I really do. It's nice that you would take the time out of your day to offer constructive feedback. I really need to just break out of this shitty mindset. It just gets suffocating sometimes.

I met some of the same early in college, who left me when I was having some especially difficult family problems and was hardly at my best. I went through the rest of school with superficial class-only friendships. As a result, I make it a point to never open to people unless they go first. My life is still a bit crazy, so the most pressing thoughts on my mind tend to be unmentionable to anyone I'd become acquainted with. ""No one likes a downer."" so why should I bother trying to make/keep friends if I'm going to have to go out with a mask that's heavier than everyone else's?

I know I don't know you and I don't fully know anything about your situation. I don't know the right words to say either. What I do know is that I've been where you've been and it was a dark place. I never believed for 2 seconds I would ever see the light again. I remember it started back in high school. I got my first job doing nothing more than bagging groceries, cleaning up the store, and bringing carts back in from the parking lot and I remember very clearly, as though it were yesterday, going out to bring in yet more carts and thinking to myself ""Is this it? Is this all there is? I'm just here to work so I can make money so I can pay bills and buy food and for what? To prolong the inevitable? Everyone dies eventually. And in the interim, what do we do? Try to delay it as long as we can. Why bother?""  I remember at the same time watching the cars driving by on the street at the end of the parking lot and thinking to myself that maybe I should carelessly walk up there and wait for one of them to hit me. What did it matter anyway? It was that or continue working in some menial job I didn't like for however many years until ultimately dying anyway. I wasn't even factoring a relationship into it. I was only around 18 at the time. I hadn't had a boyfriend yet (to date, I still haven't—that was more than 10 years ago at this point), but while I was out there contemplating running into traffic, it occurred to me that even if I had had one at the time, that wouldn't have mattered. Life would still have been meaningless. I thought to myself, what if I did have someone? Would that make a difference? And I thought, well, maybe for a while. The thrill of a relationship with someone would keep me going for a while, but true to my pessimistic nature, I started thinking, ""But it will end after a while. Eventually, we'll get used to each other. And bored. And then what? Do we leave for other people only to repeat the process? How many times? And for what reason?""  Again, I started going back to the conclusion that we all die anyways and regardless of how happy your life was or wasn't, how fulfilling you felt it was or didn't, it didn't matter. Just as the happy, fulfilled person dies, so dies the depressed, unfulfilled one. This and even the happiest person in the world could have their life destroyed in one single moment. Happiness was so fragile and the world had so many different ways to obliterate it if it wanted.   So what was the point?  I say all this, too, even as a Christian. My faith did little to dissuade me from thinking dying would be better than living. After all, I thought, if I died now, I would finally find my peace and not have to deal with all this pain and boredom and loneliness anymore. So I hoped God would be kind enough to let me die, and yet I still lingered.  And, you know, it's funny. I wasn't the first person of faith to think like this. Job did it. Solomon, too. What was interesting about Solomon is that he had everything. He had riches, plenty of women, and wisdom beyond the measure of anyone else and he still wondered what the point of it all was. ""All is vanity and grasping for the wind,"" he says over and over. He contemplates throughout Ecclesiastes just what life is, what it means, and whether it's worth living or not. He understands that his riches will ultimately end up in someone else's hands and then in someone else's after that. What's the point of wealth? He sees that it doesn't matter who you were, what you did, or what you had doesn't matter in the end and there's this sense of hopelessness about it. It really resonated with me. Obviously, I can't say that it will for everyone, but it's definitely a book I keep coming back to whenever I start going back to dark places. I relate to a lot of it. Job, too, though I can honestly say my life has never been as bad as his, thank goodness!  Anyway, I was in a very dark place for a long time. It started around 16, got to its worst between the ages of 18 and...well, I'm not sure. Well into my twenties. Up until a short couple years ago, I was convinced nothing was ever going to change. You honestly could not tell me otherwise. I felt deep down that I was always going to be stuck doing some menial job my whole life and being lonely and alone. I mean, I didn't just feel that. I knew it. With all my heart, I knew this was how it was always going to be and while I never really seriously contemplated suicide, I did often wish something would happen that would kill me. A car accident, sudden death from some mysterious illness that I didn't know I had until it was too late, being the victim of an inadvertent gunshot to the head because I was walking in the wrong neighborhood at night...you name it.   At some point, I just kind of became a zombie. I didn't really want to die anymore, but I didn't see any point in living, but for some reason I just kept going. I don't know why. Maybe it's because some part of me felt like I needed to make a difference before I left. Maybe my life was ultimately pointless, but maybe I could do something that people would remember me by. Maybe I could make a difference, if only for one person. So I just kept going, not even expecting that I would be able to do that because, well, I didn't think I had much to offer.  And then one day, things just changed. I got so sick of my current job because it was pointless and unfulfilling and didn't pay enough to allow me to support myself (I had to live with my parents longer than I wanted) and absolutely no one was willing to hire me for anything else. I applied for so many jobs, I can't tell you how many, and I didn't even get an interview or response on MOST of them. This got frustrating. This contributed to my thinking that I was just stuck where I was and things were never going to change. At some point, I had enough of it, I knew I had to do something. So I quit and moved across the country because what the heck else was I going to do? I had saved up a little money and it was a huge risk because it was going to run out fast, so if I didn't find a job in a few months' time, I was basically going to end up on the street or back at my parents' house and at that job I'd just left. But I did it anyway, fully expecting that I was going to come back defeated and continue working at my pointless job living my pointless life until I died or killed myself.  It's funny how things can change when you completely expect them not to. Within the first month of living in a totally new state in a totally new city where I didn't have any friends or connections, I found a job that, for the first time in forever, I didn't hate. It felt fulfilling. This was a new feeling for me. It was amazing. I began to see other opportunities and things I could based on the experience from the job. And while I'm still very much single, I made some friends. (That's not to say I didn't have friends before, but I have a very, very hard time meeting people and making friends, so I didn't expect I was going to make any in a strange city I'd never been to before.)  For the first time in my life, I felt better. I didn't completely leave my dark places. From time to time, I still go to them. In fact, even after working at my new job for a few months, I was still rather unhappy. It wasn't until I was given more responsibilities (goodness, it feels good to have a job where they actually believe in me enough to give me more and more responsibility—I've never had that before! I was always told this is what you do and that's it.), that I started to come out of those dark places and be kind of content. Not amazingly happy, mind, but not depressed like was either. It helps that the job I do allows me to see that I'm making a difference for some people even if it's just getting their stuff to work like they want. It's really great to make someone else happy by solving their problems, I've found. I've had so many times now where someone has called or emailed saying something's not working for them and they're distressed about it and I go in and figure out how to fix it for them and...just to see the delight when it's finally working again...well, that's something. It makes me happy to make them happy and you might, like me, think you don't have much to offer anyone. You might think that there's nothing you can do to make anyone else happy and it's definitely hard to want to do that when you aren't happy yourself, but you never know. It might take a long time to find what it is you can do, but I think that if you persevere, you can find it. And maybe life ultimately is meaningless. I'm a Christian, so I don't think it is, but maybe I'm wrong and maybe it is. Even so, I feel like now that I've discovered something I can do that makes other people happy makes me happy in return. So even though I'm still lonely a lot and even though I still go to dark places sometimes, I find some bit of happiness and meaning to cling to whenever I make someone else happy and that's often enough.  I also understand, like I said, that I don't fully know or understand your situation, I don't know what you're going through, I don't know the words to say to help you, if there even are any (when I was really depressed, nothing anyone said helped me), and we may never cross paths in real life, but I really hope you stick around. Things can change. I won't say they will, because they sometimes don't. But they can. Maybe holding onto some small sliver of hope that they might could be enough, I don't know. I think that's why I kept going, though I can't say for sure. Either way, well, I really hope things will change for you. I hope things will get better."

ForeverAloneWomen,3ag606,agirlwhonevergoesout,7,Sat Jun 20 20:23:11 2015 UTC,"That's pretty much my life too.  Males don't see me unless it's to hurl shit stuff I already know. I don't even see/meet people anymore since I live online and quite agoraphobic.  I guess, I am a bit of an existential nihilist and have always seen living as pointless. I wish there was a choice to swap my life with those who have terminal illness but wish to continue living, it might have some 'value' that way.  It's true, often I want to just off myself and not prolong my agony, but I try to remember what Emil Cioran said.  “Only optimists commit suicide, optimists who no longer succeed at being optimists. The others, having no reason to live, why would they have any to die?”  I'd rather live now than be called an optimist. ;)   I have always wanted to 'die' since I was young.  This alienation and isolation isn't new to me, the thing is, I just didn't realise being single was going to be forever.  If I knew that, I wouldn't have been so lazy and procrastinated, and already did so the multitudes of times I have attempted suicide. Seriously though, it comes and goes with me.  One day I'd really feel like ending everything, then the next day I try to read a book, or I listen to such good music, or a film makes me curious -- then I try to postpone all my intentions to kill myself because I'm still keen on experiencing these things with or without someone who can enjoy them with me.    I don't know what I am trying to say... I guess it's mostly to find things that make you curious or those that interest you, those alone are little victories."

ForeverAloneWomen,3ag606,DrowningInRealism,9,Mon Jun 22 14:30:38 2015 UTC,"What I've realised is when you have too much time to think, you start to obsess over things; that's what isolation does to you.  I believe there's a strong correlation with a lack of friends and depression. Being by yourself all the time is not good - I should know, I'm the queen of loneliness :).  I think if you had a job it would give you a distraction from your current situation, and you may even make friends with your work colleagues. Even if you don't, you'll still be coming home with money which means you can buy yourself nice things to cheer you up. If you depend on your parents, it will give you a chance to be independent and can raise your self-esteem.  As I'm writing this I'm feeling like the biggest hypocrite ever because I'm no stranger to suicidal idealation; my own life is far from perfect, but I think that you can improve things for yourself.   I know it's hard, especially when you feel like crap and can't see the point of getting up if you just have to spend another day alone, but at least a job will give you a reason to get up."

I have had experience with long term isolation - approximately 11 years of not seeing or speaking to anyone and unable to get a job throughout that time due to illness (which is what left me isolated). Being alone for long periods of time is a horrible experience.  I know that it kind of eats away at a person, but I don't think there is a point of no return. My health has slowly improved over the past few years and I've made several acquaintances that I almost dare to think of as friends. I have similar problems to you.  There is always some hope. Good luck."

ForeverAloneWomen,3ag606,NerdyNeet23,3,Sat Jun 20 10:25:38 2015 UTC,"If your life is valueless, maybe creating some values would not be a step in the wrong direction. You are dependent on the government, so this gives you a certain security. A work that person does is not limited to exchange of it for money. What hobbies do you have? If you don't have any productive hobbies, maybe following suggestion might inspire you to do something in order to make your life more bearable. If you live in an apartment, you could do some gardening in buckets, pots, etc. If you live in a house, setting up a vegetable garden on the front and back yard.  Another suggestion is sewing (certainly you can get a sewing machine). Other suggestions are programming, electronics, automation/robotics, the two of them would require some tools and a working table. If you have an access to a workshop, then woodworking and metalworking is also an suggestion, probably your dad has a workshop so you can use his tools. There are plenty of things.  In your post history you mention that you have no hobbies and no interests, and that you have trouble with concentration. The biggest hurdle in concentrating on one thing is getting oneself to do it. Once you start, it is much easier to continue. Especially if you do something manual. As a disctracted student, when I get to do something manual, I really enjoy the ability to do one thing and not be distracted by distractions.  You wrote you were taught nothing. Regarding skills, it is not late to start learning. Internet offers a myriad of sources to learn from, the knowledge is abundant, there is no scarcity put on the knowledge on the internet, so grab this opportunity. If anything then at least in an effort to make your life more bearable. There is no point in bemoaning your bad life, as this only makes it worse and more unbearable. Sorry if this sounds way too preachy and obvious, but with your posts you made it clear what if your position."

ForeverAloneWomen,3adz6q,callmeunicorn,2,Fri Jun 19 20:56:49 2015 UTC,"Big fat cliche coming your way. You don't like yourself. It's harder for someone to like you when you clearly don't like yourself. There are definitely exceptions to this, it's not the rule. People who don't like themselves find each other and begin a journey toward self-esteem together, or one partner loves the other despite their low self-esteem. I don't think you have to be all ""I LOVE myself omgzzz!"" to find someone - God knows I'm not and never will be! However, if you have a really hard time being comfortable in your own skin it impedes you from connecting with a potential partner. I am not saying you are, I have no way of knowing, but if you come across as desperate that is a big turn-off for many people. I don't think your desire for a boyfriend is desperate at all, it's perfectly normal. But just check your vibe and make sure that's not what you're putting out. Good luck to you."

You are right, they don't. But like a lot of things, figuring people out is a lot of trial and error. It's just something you'll have to get used to. Meet someone, try it out, if there is something very wrong with the relationship it's about having the self-esteem to say ""time to make like an elephant's dick and hit the road"" and get out of it.   I guess I'm wondering if I'm not particularly any of these things, should I seem MORE like these things to attract someone, and then they'd be okay if I went back to my regular apathy.

ForeverAloneWomen,3ad8cj,flavornuts,4,Fri Jun 19 18:53:38 2015 UTC,"You have to understand that procreation is the reason sexual attraction exists, and that it exists in the form that it does. Men and and women are programmed to seek out someone who will be a good parent for their future child.  While it might be attractive for a girl to be adventurous and ambitious, men will want her to mellow out and become more interested in home making and child raising as the relationship progresses and the reality of having children draws nearer.  Likewise, while it might be attractive for a man to be passionate about his hobbies, women will want him to prioritize his career as the reality of having children draws nearer.

My main interests are philosophy and linguistics, and I'm also really into running. A lot of physics students seem to hate philosophy so I usually avoid mentioning if I'm ever asked.  Running is weirdly bad as well. I convinced a guy to come running with me once (quite a few years ago now I think about it), but it soon became obvious that he couldn't keep up at all. He wouldn't turn back though, and ended up pushing himself way harder than was probably healthy. We stayed friends, but he clearly felt totally emasculated and didn't appreciate it one bit.  If I'm being honest with myself though I really don't think it's my interests which are the main problem. I can think of quite a few couples who seem to have practically nothing in common."

There are def plenty of guys who would talk to you about Star Trek but you have to kind of find them (I haven't found many of them either-I like Star Trek too- but I have been to nerdy conventions and seen them there, wishing I knew them).  I can relate anyway. I feel like I want to find a guy with similar interests but its hard."

(Am a guy, sorry for posting in a women's forum, not usually my style)  Maybe some of the problem is a lot of guys and girls that seem this way are mainly introverted, they like to stay inside where they are comfortable/relaxed and that makes it hard to meet up with somebody.  I am the same way, LOVE LOVE LOVE video gaming, reading, card games (Hearthstone is sweet!), and overall am just interested in anything I get my mind wrapped around. . . but (yep the kicker) I also am antisocial at times and feel insecure due to being alone most of the time.  Hey it happens!  I am just an inside person, I love going out to the movies, having a few beers, and walking around with a date but at the end of the day, watching a movie at home would have been what made me comfortable with my date.  It is hard to find like-minded individuals that you feel an attraction towards, so that is what makes us Forever Alone People :(  Someday you will find somebody, just keep your head held high!"

But it's never with any hint or reference to dating or going out with someone. I guess making any kind of comment when someone dresses extra nice is a social nuance almost. It gets a little annoying some times because often I like to dress extra nice...for no fucking reason whatsoever."

I've been lied to and cheated on in almost all of my relationships. Realizing that they were never going to put as much into the relationship as I could or treat me as well as I wanted.

Makes me not want to commit at all to anyone because what's the point? I was in a possessive/abusive relationship and it destroyed me for a while. I never had myself widdled down to so little and he really tried to isolate me from my family. I need a lot of alone time and none of my past partners like that. I'm not a clingy person.

ForeverAloneWomen,3a7d11,ndftba,5,Wed Jun 17 20:19:55 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that this crush is just something you've built up as an escape mechanism. Loneliness makes people do things like that. You found someone whose ideas you liked, so you built him up in your head. He has even interacted with you on facebook, so that helped bolster your mental image of him/the crush.  I hope you don't take this the wrong way, but based on what you've written, I think you should recognize that most of this is you--it's what you've built up in your mind regarding him. It's really not about him, or seeing his flaws, or finding his annoying qualities. It doesn't seem that he has gone out of his way to show interest. I don't know for certain, but it also doesn't seem that there's much basis for believing that he's  afraid of rejection or something. It's just that you've built up the crush, and it's a great escape from reality. I used to do this a lot in my early 20s.  It's probably best to delete him from facebook and remove him from your life. You could try to initiate communication with him on there, but it just seems more likely that you're using him as an escape from reality and you may not truly even like him romantically or as a person (given that you've never even met in person). I just think you'd be doing yourself a disservice to keep holding on to this crush."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a7d11,-lost-at-sea-,2,Thu Jun 18 03:35:03 2015 UTC,"I think you're right about escaping reality. But, it's the hardest thing to let go and cut all ties after 3 years of crushing over someone. I tried and failed multiple times. But I'll try again still. Thanks."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a7d11,lnys,8,Thu Jun 18 08:00:20 2015 UTC,"Sorry to say but this crush sounds very unhealthy. You never met him IRL and you probably never will - so you're fueling a fantasy that's hurting you on the long run. Also, projecting things on him and trying to analyze him or his behaviour is something you should really stop doing. You don't know him, actually, you have a crush but it's very superficial though it feels like a deeper bond. It gives you hope somehow but it's a cruel game, you go from high to low in a minute. The feeling is one-sided and that's all it'll ever be, sadly. I'd cut all ties and try to meet new people IRL if I were you."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a7d11,thekittydog,3,Wed Jun 17 21:09:04 2015 UTC,"It's crazy how often I read something on here that very much reflects my own experiences. It makes me glad to see other people would know where I'm coming from because, sometimes, I feel like I'm the only person in the world who's always been alone. Sometimes, I even feel like other FAs don't understand where I'm coming from, if you can believe that. It doesn't help that I don't have any FA friends to talk to anymore. All my friends are currently married, so, yeah. No one to relate to IRL. They give a lot of bad advice, too. I get they're trying to help, but they haven't been where I am. They don't know.    Anyway, I was going to say I had a very similar experience. I've mentioned it on here before. Basically, like you, I met this guy with whom I instantly felt a connection. I don't know what it was. You ever see Sabrina, The Teenage Witch? There was this one episode early on where she has this thing about how when she shakes Harvey's hand, it's amazing. She then goes on vacation to Mars and meets a ski instructor there that she goes on a date with, but, when she shakes hands with him, she shakes her head and says, ""Sorry. Nothing."" And the guy tries it again, saying it's because they have gloves on, but Sabrina replies she still isn't feeling it. After she gets back home, she shakes Harvey's hand again, and all is right in her world.  Silly as it was, that's kind of how it worked out with this guy. The moment I said ""Hi"" too him and he said ""Hello"" back was very much like Sabrina shaking Harvey's hand. It's not like I never talked to guys either, so I wasn't just instantly attached to him just because he was friendly to me. My best friends growing up were guys and I'd had plenty of guy friends throughout high school and college and at work. No, this guy was definitely different.  So I tried hard not to like this one guy. I mean, I was used to being ignored and I was so done with it I didn't want to like anyone anymore. So I tried finding things to hate about him. And yet, he kept surprising me by being completely the opposite of what I expected and wanted him to be. I wanted him to despise the things I liked, but he liked them too. I wanted him to find my hobbies boring or stupid, but he liked doing those things, too. I wanted him to hate the movies I liked. I wanted him to loathe the people I respected. I wanted him to be militantly opposed to my worldview, my political beliefs. I wanted him to treat people badly, to do...something—anything!—that could make him despicable to me.  Or at least irritating.  But he was the opposite of all of that. He loved the things I loved. Was interested in all the things I was interested in. He had lots of friends and everyone loved him. He respected the people I did. He held the same values and beliefs. His sense of humor was mine. His taste in movies and books was mine. I could not for the life of me find anything wrong with him, so no matter what I did, I couldn't help but fall for him and I hated it because, somehow, I think I always knew he'd ignore me, too.  Then, like you, there were some interesting coincidences about him and me that made me think that maybe it was, I don't know, meant to be or something, but it's apparent to me now that I was just being a romantic even though I tried hard not to be.   Also like you, there was some interaction that always left me hoping for more and disappointed when it never happened. I painted a picture once of something funny he said and handed it to our mutual acquaintance. She took it to him,* returned later and said he was impressed by it and I was, well, I was all kinds of delighted to hear that. There were other instances like this throughout but it all ended in me hearing that—Of course. Why should I have expected anything different?—he had met someone and was now in a relationship with her.  I guess I still don't understand it. After all of that...after everything...I didn't mean anything to him? I don't know. I've never figured it out. Did he ever see me like I saw him? Or was I always just some girl to him?   sigh  There's no knowing now. I've tried to forget about him, but it's hard sometimes. I haven't felt like that about anyone since him and I doubt I'll ever find someone like that again. But it's definitely good to know all this now instead of wondering forever.  As I said in another thread, it's gotten easier over time for me, but it's still hard sometimes. I am able to forget about him more than I used to be, but the whole thing still lingers in my mind. I still hear echoes of the things said, I still see the ghosts of images of the things that happened...  Maybe someday, it will all go away. I hope.  *Long story short here, we always tended to just miss each other, but there was this mutual connection we had through which I had to do a lot of my communicating and it was, um, complicated, so I had to avoid telling her what I thought of him—she was in no way competition though. Trust me on that one.  P.S. Sorry for the long post. I do that. I think I do it sometimes because I vainly hope he'll stumble on this someday and see my story in full and see what the whole thing did to me, see what he meant to me, and see how deeply hurt I was when I heard nothing I did, nothing I said, and nothing about me apparently ever meant anything to him.  See? Here I go trying to be a romantic again. He's never going read any of this."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a7d11,Duckstrut,2,Fri Jun 19 04:51:56 2015 UTC,"Thanks for telling me your story. I read all of it and I truly appreciate you taking the time to write it.   I was thinking about the same thing the other day. The whole thing about having common interests and him being nice and liking the books I read and my Facebook posts but then nothing more than that happens. You know why? Because he's just a very nice guy to everyone, actually. He appreciates other people's opinions and these opinions are what makes him grow and become what he is everyday. He learns from people and this makes him a better person. For him, a like or a comment or a word of appreciation is not a romantic kinda thing. If he likes a post, it's because he likes the post and nothing else. Maybe he likes my personality but that doesn't necessarily mean he wants to date me or anything. It's all in my head because I'm a forever alone woman who happened to like this guy but if I happened to be in any other girl's shoes, I'll probably act differently and there will be so many other fish in the sea for me. I don't know, I'm just trying to guess what's going on here.  What I'm trying to do now to stop myself from thinking and obsessing about him is that whenever I think about him or if I want to check on his profile, I grab a book and read to distract myself from thinking about him. Some people suggested that I cut every ties but I don't think it's a fair thing to do to him. He's been nice to me and  he doesn't deserve this treatment I suppose. I hope my therapy works for me and I think you should try it too. Don't try to obsess over anyone else just to keep him (the guy you liked) out of your head. This is definitely not healthy. Also I found that hating the guy and picking on their annoying habits will not work so just try to distract yourself with work and reading and hopefully someday, you'll forget about him.  Cheers :)"

ForeverAloneWomen,3a6fpl,onemorecue,8,Wed Jun 17 16:25:55 2015 UTC,"I have a close friend who use to identify as asexual—then she decided she was sexual but just extremely low libido. Anyway, during her ""asexual"" period, I remember mentioning to my brother that this friend was asexual, and he was shocked. Said he couldn't see her as asexual at all.  That surprised me, because I thought exactly the opposite—that this friend had always seemed asexual to me, because she never seemed shy or modest or self-conscious in any way around men. Never saw her blush, never saw her primp and preen, etc.  I thought about this for a while and decided that the reason my friend seemed sexual to my brother was because she's very friendly. Always has a smile for people, always makes conversation. I think maybe men, especially, tend to perceive friendliness as sexuality. So it follows that they might perceive a lack of smiling, friendliness, or outgoingness as asexuality.  Maybe this helps, maybe not."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a6fpl,coralya,3,Wed Jun 17 17:42:15 2015 UTC,"I've always been very weird with that; usually I got to know a guy, then developped feelings, and then told him plainly. I was told not a long time ago that I shouldn't have done that, something along the lines of ""you should just hint at it"". Well problem is, when you like men who are not very self confident or just reserved, and when you're looked at like someone asexual, hinting at it feels like shouting in an empty room. I don't regret any of my rejections though, some were really bad and hurt me for months afterwards, but I'm glad I did it and got an answer.  I think overall it's better to learn to deal with rejection than avoiding it. However I also read a r/askreddit thread about women approaching, and some answers from men were so disheartening (aka, some men feel ""deprived"" of something, it's never the cute ones who approach them cause ofc the cute ones don't have to approach men, since they'd be approached regularly, so if you approach a man some think you're desperate or something and they miss out on the ""chasing"" part), that kind of got to me. I guess I have to learn to be less blunt and stuff, but I don't think that's in my character to be honest."

But I have met guys who I suspect are asexual.  But I'm a straight guy, so it's probably because I can see all women as being sexual in some way.

I am just being friendly though: smile at them, look down, then back up. Touch their arm to say something to them. Works great.   Confidence is key.

My schedule is never very complicated: I try to fit in visits to the most important museums/landmarks, a lot of walking around, I always try to bring back a book from where I go so finding a bookshop is something that keeps me busy too.  Also, I usually keep a couple of hours to be alone in my room, just read a book or watch the (foreign) channels, it sounds stupid but for me it's like a real treat, a break from my life. I don't go out here and wouldn't go out when I travel alone either, I usually have dinner somewhere and go back to my room. I would never go to a bar alone."

It helps if you're somewhere like rome or athens where there's plenty to do though.  I also love just walking around in places I've never been, sometimes getting lucky and stumbling on things (like that time I wandered around rome and accidentally found a free concert put on by Coke, with Clean Bandit performing among others. Fun Stuff)"

Events are good to like a concert if you like those or a play, buy a ticket don't back out. Try to find a few other things there that you want to see or go eat at. Trying to plan a little bit of it before you go so you keep yourself active so you won't just be on the wifi at the hotel."

ForeverAloneWomen,3a6qbz,JDNow,2,Wed Jun 17 23:52:02 2015 UTC,"do you have any hobbies? favorite  bands?, love art?, love gardens, hiking? pretty much find something you want to see that your willing to travel to and go to that place then once you pick that place see what else is to do there i use the internet pretty much if it's a big city it's easy also if you don't mind talking to people ask around what people do when they are in a city."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a6qbz,obtrudenomore,1 point,Thu Jun 18 00:29:45 2015 UTC,"Depends where you go.  Don't travel alone to Turkey, for example.  I like to use Couchsurfing, because you can stay with someone for free, and that person can show you around, too.  They also post local events and get-togethers with other travelers, so it's cool.  You can post in the regional groups ahead of time, and learn about sights or events you need to plan ahead for, too."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a6qbz,clfkik,1 point,Fri Jun 19 03:23:16 2015 UTC,I travel alone constantly and did a cross country trip alone. I really hope that any woman who is hesitant to travel alone will try. I've never thought twice about it.   If I waited around for someone to do things with I might never do them and I love travel and hate sitting at home.
ForeverAloneWomen,3a6qbz,FlushableHandle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"I travel alone. I like planning trips and seeing new places. I do photography as a hobby too so it gives me a good excuse to go see some neat places. Basically I look online for different sites to see. Trip Advisor is a good place to start because people rate different attractions/restaurants and you can read reviews. When I meet someone and start chatting with them they always ask me where my boyfriend or friends are and act surprised when I tell them that I'm there alone. That usually gets the response of ""so you're here alone?"" And I just shrug and say yes because I like traveling. And not all trips have to be to other countries or tourist destinations. My favorite thing is visiting different botanical gardens in my state."

ForeverAloneWomen,3a6qbz,lnys,1 point,Wed Jun 17 20:15:02 2015 UTC,"I didn't used to be.   I used to be shy and not know what to say to people and be awkward. I would reflect for days about what a stupid thing I said and replay it over and over.  But you do it enough times, it gets easier. I went from being neurotically shy and self loathing (even carved ""failure"" on my arm with a razor blade) to outgoing and confident and able to strike up conversations with strangers.   Especially when you are traveling and are foreign, people are interested in you. It makes the conversation easier because they want to hear about YOU and ask you stuff about where you are from. It's very different to just going to a bar where you live and aren't that different from anyone else there. Just yesterday I was wandering around a village with a population of 300 and stopped into a pub for a pint. Everyone stopped what they were doing, stared, then when I asked for a pint and they heard my accent, the questions began. Had a great time."

You said in another of your posts that you were quite good looking or somewhat attractive, and to be honest that's the difference between your experiences and mine.   I've been living abroad in various countries for 5 years now and travelled alone a couple of times, believe me, I could spend 4 hours in a foreign bar without talking to a single soul. People are not interested in me where I live, and they're not either when I travel, cause I'm still the same unattractive person."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a6qbz,lnys,-1,Wed Jun 17 20:27:51 2015 UTC,"I didn't used to be attractive either. I was fat and dumpy looking, to be honest. Still could talk to people. It's really the attitude, not the looks, for just befriending people, IMO.   On the 1-10 scale I was a 3-4, now a 7-8."

I figure I have exactly the same amount of experience as anyone else my age; I just have a different skill set. I also have no experience playing the violin, but I don't let that get me down. And I certainly don't feel like a child next to my neighbor just because she has been playing the violin since she was 8.  I'm not ""hopeful"". Having friends or a romantic relationship sounds great in the abstract, but that's mostly because my mental picture doesn't  include all the unpleasant parts by default. And for me, the unpleasant parts have always loomed very large when it comes to interacting with real people in real life.  Some day I may learn to play the violin, though."

That's an interesting way to look at it, for sure. Sometimes I tell myself that at least professionally I'm better off than most of my ex-friends/acquaintances, as I decided to give up the comfort of home for experience, but when it comes to relationships/love life, the gap between my self esteem as a professional and my self esteem as a woman is really too wide."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a2cxu,-lost-at-sea-,6,Wed Jun 17 20:17:29 2015 UTC,"I was where you are at 26. No dates, kisses, hand holding, anything with a man, ever. Men never seemed to even look at me, and I never had anything other than a friendship with a man. As far as I know, no man had ever seen me as a person they'd want a relationship with. I was so depressed and felt like I was carrying the world's worst burden. It was a secret I couldn't tell anyone, because everyone else was lightyears ahead of me. The worst part was when I went on vacation last summer with some family--something I thought I needed, just to get away--and I cried myself to sleep every single night because I felt so lonely. When I was supposed to be having fun and getting an escape from my everyday life.  Then, just weeks before my 27th birthday, I met him. There was an obvious mutual attraction almost instantly. I had never clicked with anyone in that way. He was very sweet to me. Became my first everything. But it lasted less than a couple of months, and when he left, he said he had been wanting to end things for a few weeks, despite his actions and statements indicating otherwise up until that point. This crushed me, because during all my time alone, I had never really considered the possibility that I might actually be used by someone in that way. I was just concerned about being alone.   It has taken me longer than I'd like to admit to get over it and I still think about him and whether I could have done something. And whether my inexperience ran him away. Now that I'm alone again, I feel the same as I did before I met him. Lonely and bitter about not being able to have the happiness that most have. But the best thing I've done to get my mind off of it is going to the gym. It's so worth it, because you wear your mind (and anger) down AND it's good for your body. I've never been able to lose weight with diet alone, but I weigh less than I did in high school now. Exercise helps me not feel depressed.  Sorry for the long post but I do hope you find it helpful. Hang in there!"
ForeverAloneWomen,3a2cxu,wildncrazybestseller,4,Wed Jun 17 04:46:53 2015 UTC,"I remember that post you made, I felt really sad for you but I'm glad you're better now. I wonder I would react if I were in that situation; I never really think that could happen to me, I have this very stupid fantasy that I'll meet a guy I get along with and that'd be it. Of course it won't happen, but I never really think of the pitfalls to be honest.   I'm going to the gym too, and yeah it's a goot outlet for anger and frustration, however at times it makes me even more depressed when I see beautiful and fit girls there, in shorts and tank tops, looking amazing."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a2cxu,thelifeofJ,1 point,Wed Jun 17 19:19:32 2015 UTC,"I guess I really never have had the expectation that I would just meet one person and that would be it. I thought it would be much harder and I'd have to date around. But what really took me off guard was how much it hurt to be built up by someone (he would tell me how he thought I was intelligent and beautiful, how girls like me had boyfriends and he was lucky to meet me, how he was so happy with me and telling his family that he was happy...stuff that made me believe that I really wasn't bound to be FA forever) and then to have that topple down at what seemed like the drop of a hat. He told me that kind of stuff even during the time period in which he was apparently questioning whether he even wanted to date me. It really hurt me. But maybe that's just how it works and I'm naive. I'd like to believe that some men are more honest with their feelings.  I know what you mean about seeing other girls at the gym. I think over time I've just come to not care as much, which is a bit freeing in itself."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a2cxu,kapustnapolievka,6,Thu Jun 18 02:53:51 2015 UTC,"I made it to age 31 with zero experience. Finally met a girl at that point who was 26 and it turned out she also had zero experience. So we were each other's first love, and it was so great to both be coming from the same place. Much nicer than having a first relationship with a teacher-student dynamic, I'd think.   (We lasted a year and a half or so but weren't long-term compatible. Ten years later I haven't met anyone else yet. So at least I have the memories from that.)  I guess /r/foreveralonedating is the main way I know of for FA's to find each other. Maybe give it a shot.  Edit: as for dealing with the lonely/depressed feelings, I guess I just distract myself with the few solitary hobbies I have. I check the online dating sites occasionally, and go to some meetups of a local group that's centered around one of my hobbies. I haven't really met anyone yet through either of those avenues, but I'm still hopeful."

Even if it's the middle of the night I'll go out, I've gone to the gym at 1am before.  Honestly, I don't think I'd be bothered were it not for everyone else starting families. Seeing that has made me realise that this isolation probably isn't just a phase or some growing pains, and unless I make some pretty drastic change this is going to be it for the long run. It's definitely getting harder to take, but I am confident it will bottom out soon, and then things will pick up. I'm 28."

That hit a nerve. I used to think, like most people around me, that it was just a phase. That sure I was messed up but sure, I'll grow out of it and things will get better and maybe I could meet someone? And then with time it's less and less believable and my now ex friends stopped being so cheery or condescending with me, I think they're embarrassed or something."

All my friends have had relationships and many sexual experiences (outside of relationships). I just feel like a loser when they talk about the latest guy they slept with or are dating. I'd rather be in a relationship than have casual sex, but its still hard to hear it.  I am working towards losing weight too. I think it will make a huge difference but I don't know by how much. I have hopes as well that this will change things. Yes, I do feel depressed at times too but I try to get through it by focusing on my goals and what I have to do to make myself happy.

I have never experienced love where I felt comfortable and like I wasn't committing a crime. The bad feelings come in waves.

Turns out I discovered years later that I really like clothes and dressing nicely. It's about looking like a more confident version of myself, not about looking like a model.  I still am a total failure at makeup though, haha. That's okay, though. I spend enough time, money, and effort keeping the acne and the hair under control without putting lots of effort into makeup, too.

ForeverAloneWomen,3a0xvb,coralya,5,Tue Jun 16 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"I think dressing ""better"" is dressing in a way that makes you feel better and more confident about yourself. So, that's probably different for different people. For me, it's jeans and a blazer, or a blouse tucked into a pencil skirt. For Steve Jobs, it was jeans and a mock turtleneck, the same ones, every day.  It doesn't matter what does it for you, really. But I feel like some people give up before they even try to find a personal style, because they think clothes that will make them feel better and more confident don't even exist.  And, of course, some people just couldn't care less. But even for those people, I feel like it's good to learn some about clothes, because then you have the knowledge to get a small wardrobe of stuff together that meets your dress code needs for school, work, church, whatever. Then you can just have your few go-to outfits for different occasions and not have to put too much thought into it."

Even online dating sometimes doesn't help in a lot of these places.  If your career allows it, moving could be an option. I know, I know, it sucks to have to move to have a fucking social life like a normal person (I am about to do the same thing) and it's tough, but it could be an option.   But thanks for sharing."

Also I'll still have the same problems no matter where I live so I don't feel moving would change a lot for me."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a0xvb,JDNow,2,Tue Jun 16 15:57:18 2015 UTC,"Well, I guess if you move to another area you might have an easier time finding a job, too. Who knows. Again, from my own experience, I work in a limited field (in newspapers, and most towns only have one) and so if I couldn't expect to find a job just anywhere.   I'm kind of with you though ... I highly suspect that even if I got to a different part of the country and move to a larger city, I suspect I probably won't have all that many friends. For whatever reason, I don't really relate to people that well (or they don't relate to me).   On the other hand, I know if I moved to a larger city there'd more more cool things to do alone. So there's that."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a006l,IAmShallow,20,Tue Jun 16 03:58:09 2015 UTC,"Like you, I've never been approached.

I'm not doing anything extreme either."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a006l,heelsintothedirt,3,Tue Jun 16 17:24:01 2015 UTC,Thats a good idea. I might do that myself if I get hit on again sometime this year lol. Though  I can't tell when I am being hit on. I am slightly lacking in social skills (to some extent) and I hate when people hint at things in general. I can't tell they are doing that.  Good idea to stay neutral and see how it goes. It is tough though and I understand. :/
ForeverAloneWomen,3a006l,SmaharbaShe,4,Wed Jun 17 06:06:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know, honestly.  I spent a long time thinking my looks had a LOT to do with men not approaching me until I started therapy - then I had to take a hard, honest look at myself and I realized NO one really approaches me. I exude a nervous energy without realizing it sometimes. My resting face looks terribly grumpy, which is naturally off putting to almost anyone. My attitude actually has a lot to do with why men in general don't approach me.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still not the prettiest girl around. But I now realize there's much more to it than that."
ForeverAloneWomen,3a006l,rainbowsblehhh,7,Wed Jun 17 07:14:39 2015 UTC,"Probably.  Pretty girls get hit on, cat called, line of boyfriends waiting. Its very basic,  no attention, definately unattractive."

If it is clearly a player guy or someone who I've seen complement a ton of ladies in a row I may snicker or laugh and then say thank you, but I've gotten pretty good at taking complements and smiling/saying thank you vs. fighting it.

Don't tell her I said that, though...) and I've seen really cute, pretty girls get completely ignored (like one of my college friends! I still don't understand how anyone, anyone could ignore her).  As for myself, I'm in a similar situation. I've had people tell me I'm attractive and yet no guy ever pays me any attention, so who knows. Either they're all lying or there's something else about me they don't like but I can't for the life of me figure out what. Like...do I smell bad? Do I have a grating voice? Is my laugh weird?  Am I too dirty? Am I too flirty? Do I like what you like? I could be wholesome. I could be loathsome. I guess I'm a little bit shy. Why don't you like me?

Many people inflate attractiveness in there, but it's worth doing to see what they think. Sometimes they have helpful comments on your clothes, makeup, demeanor, and such.

I grimly chuckled at your story, because I always went for the philosophy guys in my early/mid twenties. One of my friends joked once that she'd stick with me through 99 philosophers, but that was her limit, so once I got to #98 I'd better be careful.  Next time, try an artist or an engineer. Or something. Anything. Don't be an idiot like me and keep going for the same type of smart philosophy guy over and over and over. They may seem more introspective and self-aware than other guys, but that doesn't mean they're any more mature when it comes to human relations.  I'm not trying to be sexist here, by the way. I'm down on women philosophers, too. I studied philosophy in college, and probably no one should ever date me."

Because, obviously, I am very biased. This is a point on which I can't be objective or fair.  Mainly I just wanted to caution OP against making the same mistakes I did, one of which was, ""Because we connect over philosophy, that makes it more likely he'll be romantically interested me!""

However, it's important to remember that people tend to complain about their SOs to their friends as a way of blowing off steam.  I bet that this girl isn't JUST an emotionally unavailable druggy, but someone who has good personality traits as well.  So, while physical attraction might be a large component of his decision to return to her, it might not be the only component."

People act differently in different contexts.  2nd: Being happy is not the same as being comfortable.  He might have chosen comfort over someone unfamiliar and untested.  People can even be feel more ""comfortable"" being abused than being treated right, if abuse is all they have known, or if abuse is what their abusers (past or present) have convinced them they deserve.  I am not saying that what is happening to your friend is anywhere near that extreme, but  it could be possible that your friend has returned to his ex, in part, because she is familiar.   All that said, I am not denying that appearance could have played a part.  Maybe it played the biggest part.  I am an ugly woman too: I know how it's like to almost always be treated as a friend and not as anyone with relationship potential; I know how it's like to be completely ignored by men, despite my decent personality, because almost every other woman is hotter.  It's a shitty, shitty feeling.  However, even if appearance was a big part of this guy's decision, you have to keep in mind that you don't know the whole story, and it's probably more complicated than it seems."
ForeverAloneWomen,39x77v,glandgames,2,Mon Jun 15 20:31:14 2015 UTC,"Over the last couple of weeks he would complain how she was emotionally unavailable and how she was a bit of a jerk. She is a big partier too and doesn't shut up about drugs.    This is just his opinion of his gf, you haven't seen herself for yourself so you don't know if this is factually true or not. However, if the bf is saying such stuff about his gf, he's telling you that he has been and wants to be with a drug user partier.   Let that sink in for a bit.   He's no loss to you, trust me. Also, when he did compliment you, what did he compliment you on:   He knows a TON about philosophy, and he always complimented how much I knew.    Did he ever compliment you on your physical look? Say that you're cute/pretty/etc... without being prompted by someone else or you asked him about how you look? If not, that's a 'tell' that he sees you just as a friend (note: could be different if the guy has never dated before so he's very shy about expressing things to women but that's not the case here)."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,UglyKetchup,12,Sun Jun 14 22:17:58 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right, op. It frustrates me when I read on the main fa sub that women can't be forever alone. They mistake us being able to get sex with being able to get love. I'm well aware I could make a post on craigslist and in the hour, I'd have some guy twice my age giving me disappointing sex, but I don't want that, I want love. Fuck my life, right?"
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,CatAndTonic,26,Mon Jun 15 23:27:26 2015 UTC,"I think being an unattractive woman,  I can agree that there is less sympathy for the woman. Both have it bad, but for women it's worse because you lose respect from both sexes. Men don't necessarily treat other men that look ugly in a bad way. But for women, both men and women will not respect you."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,Toridon88,4,Mon Jun 15 09:27:34 2015 UTC,"This is a great insight. I never really thought of it that way. I was one of those people that thought women probably have it easier than guys. But now I know that's not the case and that for anyone FA, it's tough going.

ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,Jarn_Tybalt,2,Wed Jun 17 20:37:18 2015 UTC,Thanks for your comment. And I am glad at least that you were able to get out of being an FA. Hopefully I will one day too (most of us do anyway).
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,Toridon88,11,Thu Jun 18 12:30:52 2015 UTC,"You don't even have to be ugly for it to be difficult. I would say I am average, despite the extra 20 pounds I carry (which may be it?) And guys never approach me. They also don't really seem to like it if I try to make a move first. I've just had extremely bad luck in the romance department and almost every time I am attracted to someone, they either have a prettier girl already, or find a prettier girl to focus on while I get to know them.  It definitely frustrates me when guys act like being a girl makes you magically able to find someone at the snap of your fingers. I have always been the one to make a first move, and it has never worked out for me."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,TheKinkMaster,7,Mon Jun 15 14:34:09 2015 UTC,"Same here, same here. I'm average-looking, but can be decently pretty if I put some effort into it and guys still don't approach me. And there's always a girl prettier than me around anyway, so whatever, I guess. I'm at a point where if I were to actually meet a guy who was actually interested in me, I'd constantly fear that he'd drop me for the next girl that came along who was marginally prettier than me. I know anyone who does that is shallow and not worth it anyway, but I'd still fear it. I'd fear that no matter how genuine he seemed, he'd leave me for someone else if she was better-looking than me. Or, at the very least, he'd be secretly fantasizing about her.  I also have had to approach guys and I likewise noticed they don't seem to like it when I do that either, which has taken a toll on my self-esteem. It's like I can either not approach and then go unnoticed, making me think I must be ugly or offensive in some way, or I can approach and get treated like ""Ew. What are you doing talking to me?"", again, making me think I must've overestimated my appearance or that I must have an annoying voice or really bad breath or...or something. I don't know what.  Sometimes, I feel like being FA has really messed me up. I didn't always think like this..."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,thekittydog,8,Tue Jun 16 03:45:24 2015 UTC,"Same, I mean, I don't even think I'm that ugly, but I've never been approached either. I am incredibly shy and my social skills are almost nonexistant, so maybe that's part of it, I don't know. Seeing guys talk about how easy it is for women just makes me feel way worse, because if it really is that easy, then there must be something seriously wrong with me to make it impossible for me."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ujxs,NerdyNeet23,8,Mon Jun 15 16:36:28 2015 UTC,"Its tough to the point where its impossible and not even worth trying.  You're gone the moment a prettier girl gives him a smile.   Always knowing youre likely the most unattractive useless waste of oxygen in the room,  even wondering what its like to be loved should be a crime, punishable by death.  It would be the happiest solution for the ugly, tortured sufferers."

I make friends with opposite gender fairly easily, but I'm no more attractive than a piece of furniture. My friends come and tell me about their latest crush or ask for advice, and of the ones i did tell of my feelings, long story short, they've politely said no.   What I can tell you is that regardless of male or female, we are always interested in more or less the same things to different degrees. We all like food, some form of entertainment (tv shows, movies, books, music), and to a certain extent,  shopping. We're always looking to acquire something new once in a while.   After that, it's a matter of positioning.  Sometimes I'll look up stuff other people are interested in just so I have something to talk about. Sometimes I'll just say, i don't know anything but I'm interested. People like talking about things they're interested in. It's nice to have someone to geek out over stuff.  Finally, we're all somewhat depressed and kind of broken. We wouldn't be human otherwise. We all have our burdens. The most important thing i learned through social pain and suffering is that we each need to carry our burden. We're enamored with the idea that we'll meet someone who will come and take it all away. Nope. Someone will come with their own burden, and you'll need to be strong enough, sometimes, to carry both at the same time.   So don't sweat it. I was older than you before I found someone i really liked, like someone i can name more than 5 non-physical things i liked about them, and the thought of them being with someone else made me sick kind of liked. Engaged now, but that's another story.   My motto is to get prepared in case someone comes rather than ask why they aren't here yet. Better that than be unprepared, and I'm already playing with a social handicap.   Keep at it!"

ForeverAloneWomen,39ubss,Rayna63,4,Sun Jun 14 21:08:14 2015 UTC,"I actually started a similar thread a couple of months ago and the consensus was that starting over in a new place is generally a good experience. I'm moving to a new city by the end of the summer and I'm hoping it will go well. I actually like where I am now, but I don't really have many friends here (mostly acquaintances). I already live away from family, so there's really nothing to lose by going to a new place. My social life has been pretty stale for a long time here.  I've found that making friends and meeting people in general gets harder once you're out of college. I'm hoping that I'll be able to try going to meetup groups and using OKCupid to meet people in my new town. I wish I could share more and be more helpful, but my own journey still awaits!"

Not much, but just enough to pull me out of my depression. It's really awkward when they ask me about my friends back home and stuff though, and idk why-- but I lie about having had friends, mainly because I'd feel like they'd think I was a loser. :/  A new city would definitely give you a chance to re-invent yourself though! I mean, I'm still the same FA ugly girl, but at least I have a few friends to talk to now"
ForeverAloneWomen,39ubss,dizzytulip,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:16:04 2015 UTC,"I moved alone to a different city, about 70 miles from home which is far enough to be inconvenient. I still talk to 3 friends back home that I've had forever but they're busy with their own lives and families so I hardly see them.   It's definitely harder to make friends as an adult, all the friends I have are people I met at my first job here (pizza restaurant) or people I met through them; also a couple people at my current job. In my case I moved from a small, boring town into a big city, so there's a lot more to do and more jobs available so it was a good thing. My perspective on this is moving from small to big town.  I encourage you to think of it like this: You move to a new town, and no one knows you. You can do whatever you want and be whoever you want. If you try, you can meet lots more people with your interests than you can now (meetup.com, and going out alone, which is not strange in the city). People you left behind will assume you are off doing something interesting and many will be jealous you moved. I think for most people it's a good thing to start over just keep in mind that making friends will take time. Have a few hobbies or things you can pursue alone while you get settled and meet people."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ubss,splek,0,Sat Jun 20 07:11:53 2015 UTC,"My friends from college have plans and don't invite me, my childhood friends forgot about me when I moved and still see each other without ever inviting me, the rest are my roommate's friends...and even them are starting to do things without me. Now, I just want to move away from all of that and start anew.   Hm.... Do YOU ever initiate activities? How does that go? Are you just hoping they'll always invite you, or do you ever plan something and invite them?   They're not inviting you as much anymore, but what's the dynamic like, are you always waiting for THEM or do you feel safe asking them to join you doing things?"
ForeverAloneWomen,39ppta,chaosakita,12,Sat Jun 13 15:33:09 2015 UTC,Yup. Every guy I was ever interested in.  All my friends are married now and the only love I know is unrequited.

ForeverAloneWomen,39ppta,Toridon88,11,Sun Jun 14 11:34:40 2015 UTC,"I had been spending a lot of time hanging out with a guy I met playing Magic the Gathering since the summer started, and I thought things were pretty good. I've never spent so much time with a guy before and we were texting like crazy whenever we were apart! He's a lot different than most guys, and I thought I even could have a shot in a few months or so.  However just when I thought things were going somewhere, it turns out he was talking to his ex again. At first he told me she was just talking about personal problems, but he decided to reconsider things with her again.  She is a bit of a jerk but she's much more attractive than I am. She also likes going out a lot more than I do so there's that.  Apparently, she got jealous and now he says he won't be able to talk to me as much anymore. At least he let me down easy.   Has this happened to anyone else before?"
ForeverAloneWomen,39ppta,missmango123,6,Sat Jun 13 15:34:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, and they will tell you a variety of reasons, but they don't really know why, so you'll never really know why.  I've been dumped for someone prettier, uglier,  more dependent, less dependent -- the list is endless.  It's not about you, it's about them. The problem was that you invested way too much in this relationship."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ppta,Thinks_Like_A_Man,6,Sun Jun 14 14:10:13 2015 UTC,"I don't really have enough dating experience to have encountered this particular problem (yet). However, the one guy I've dated moved on to the next lady so quickly that I have a suspicion that he either knew her before we met or met her while he was seeing me. So maybe I have had a guy choose another woman over me.   But...he seemed to go on maybe 1-2 dates with her and then it fizzled out. And it doesn't seem that he's dated anyone since then. So I guess it was his mistake."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ppta,-lost-at-sea-,2,Sat Jun 13 17:49:30 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I feel you on this. I had something kind of similar happen to me (getting strung along by someone much older who was never interested in a steady relationship).  People talk about forgiveness and moving on and all that, but it's really hard, maybe impossible, to do when you still see the person around all the time. I have lots of firsthand experience with this, unfortunately. I know that technically it's a choice I'm making, that if I were really determined  I could get away from this one person I have to see all the time. Haven't made it happen yet."
ForeverAloneWomen,39ppta,coralya,2,Sat Jun 13 18:40:17 2015 UTC,"Maybe the closest I've had to this is a guy talking to me while waiting for my friend to come back around and him immediately turn his attention to her once she appears.  I wasn't really interested in him but I decided to at least be friendly to him because who knows if we become friends and then he has friends and my circle could widen. But nahh, he only cared about her, but she was already seeing someone else."

I can't seem to shake the constantly remembering past mistakes I've made, though.  This is one of the few problems I still have with being alone, not in the sense of being single, but in the sense of being physically alone in my house. I don't mind most things about solitude, but the flow of negative memories is just so much harder to redirect when there aren't other people around."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,GreenSkyFish,1 point,Thu Jun 11 19:24:21 2015 UTC,"That is so interesting. I am the exact opposite. I'm safest when I'm alone. I guess seeing other people and interacting with them is really where the triggers are for me. It could be something so simple, for example I might be having an otherwise normal conversation with some coworkers and in the group I might start to tell a story and someone else interrupts me and goes on talking about something else. That could really activate negative thoughts like ""I'm socially inept"" or ""People don't really like me"" and a slew of consequences that accompany those thoughts..."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,coralya,2,Fri Jun 12 00:45:35 2015 UTC,"It's all about locus of control, right? I could start having negative thoughts about myself in social situations when I feel like I'm not connecting with people, but I rarely do anymore because I'm just used to it. It doesn't feel like it's in my control because I've tried like crazy to enjoy social situations and connect with others, and it just doesn't happen, except with the small number of people I just happen to click very well with. I've decided it's not within my control to become socially adpet except on a very superficial level."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,CalzoneLayer,2,Fri Jun 12 09:49:02 2015 UTC,"I say and think really mean things that are not only mean, but wildly inaccurate -- like I'll say ""slut"" or ""whore"" to myself.  I usually do it when I think of something embarrassing that happened, as a way to get me to stop thinking about it.  As harsh as it sounds, it's relatively new, like within the past several years.  I used to just say something innocuous, like ""birds.""    Very strange."

I'm not good at socializing with others in every sense of the word. Like, I'm very awkward. Not Zoey Deschanel  New Girl awkward. The kind that actually makes other people uncomfortable.

One thing that helped me over-analysing screw-ups was realising how much more attention I was paying to mistakes than to not-mistakes. Learning to be more objective helped my confidence, which reduced awkwardness (still plenty to work on there, though)."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,AtomicNinja,10,Fri Jun 12 21:58:27 2015 UTC,"All the time. Whenever someone says something mean to me, I often think there's nothing they can say that is as mean as the things I say to myself."

I make myself laugh at the thought of them preferring to eat cockroaches or vomit non-stop for 6 hours that have to tolerate my presence. Other than that I just reinforce suicidal thoughts and it's all good.
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,queenofglum,3,Thu Jun 11 06:31:07 2015 UTC,It's usually just a trail of negative thoughts for me. I just now realised I was walking around with my shoe not done up properly sigh
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,GreenSkyFish,3,Thu Jun 11 11:25:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, I think it is because I have no support system in my life. No one to tell me I am a good person. My opinion of myself is so fragile, one mistake and I berate myself. I have had near breakdowns in my car because I left my pass card for work at home."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,UglyKetchup,2,Thu Jun 11 23:09:01 2015 UTC,"Yep. Not everyday, but sometimes. Usually when I'm depressed or angry with myself. It can get pretty violent in my head.  The difference is that years ago when I did suffer from pretty consistent depression, I wouldn't stop myself and would just continue doing it but nowadays I'll try to actively catch myself and argue AGAINST it in my head trying to using logic and evidence. For example, a common thought I have is that ""I'm a horrible selfish person."" When I have that thought, I try to remind myself in a gentle but firm way that I have selflessly helped many people in my life and have often gone out of the way to do so. Usually if I have a negative thought in the first place, it's because of a specific event or trigger that is causing strong negative emotion be it sadness or anger. That's what leads to the mean things I say to myself. But I often forget that there was a trigger causing me to say those things. Being able to identify the trigger, and dealing with THOSE feelings around the trigger help me avoid or reduce the damage from saying mean things to myself."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,conceal-identity,3,Fri Jun 12 00:42:42 2015 UTC,"Sometimes I just read your posts to review coping strategies. It's so easy to spiral down. I have to remind myself to not beat myself up over stupid small things.  For me my negative mantra has always been ""you're stupid."" No matter how well I did in school, I still felt I was falling short. I found myself in a very competitive and selective professional/graduate program after undergrad. Even though I worked very hard to get in, I still felt like I wasn't good enough and of course I dropped out. Luckily, I chose a good undergraduate degree to fall back on. It took me years to not feel like a total failure and realize that I can find other paths to success."
ForeverAloneWomen,39d8nr,innocent1234,1 point,Fri Jun 12 03:02:23 2015 UTC,"Oh it's incredibly easy to START to spiral. The actual spiral itself isn't instantaneous and quick, but very subtle. Equally subtle is the origin of the spiral, many would argue that's the hardest part. It took me several months of active conscious practice to start to become more aware of my thoughts/feelings enough to be able to see what events preceded a spiral. But identifying the cause or the root of it is half the battle already won. The other half is addressing the thought in the first place, whether it's through logic/reasoning, engaging in some other kind of activity, or reminding yourself that you're just human and that no one is perfect."

You'll see it when you're looking for a job, at the job, socializing, etc.   However, it really is the way you react to it that makes or breaks the situation. 'Cause that shit's still gonna be there - the only thing you can control is what you do and your attitude, regardless of your age. It really is about building self-esteem.

ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,Toridon88,4,Tue Jun 9 21:30:48 2015 UTC,"I'm sorry to say this but this does not end in your twenties. It gets much better, but it never stops. I've had old men (like 50+) be rude and immature like that towards me.  I agree with posts saying whats more important is how you react. Don't let them get satisfaction from you being angry or anything,  but ignoring doesn't always work either. Don't let it bother you too much either way because it does get better, just don't expect it to actually end."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,UglyKetchup,5,Wed Jun 10 13:50:24 2015 UTC,"Guys have high expectations for girls especially in my school. They only like a few of the girls in my grade. All the guys try to hit on the same 7 or 8 girls. A guy just has to be loud and  ""cool"" to get one of these girls"
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,onemorecue,5,Wed Jun 10 15:59:26 2015 UTC,"Ugh, I know what you mean, the respect thing drives me mad. I remember when I was in school, I had what I considered a fairly healthy fear/respect of the older kids, because hey, they were older! Foolishly, I thought the reverse would be true...  Far too often I would get boys who were four or five years younger than me jeering at me in the corridors, running up and hugging me because ""omg ur blubberz so sexxxxy"" etc, or would run up to me with a friend ""my mate really fancies you!"" while said mate would recoil in horror. Then if I said I didn't fancy him they'd run off screaming with laugher because omg, you got dissed by the fat bird!  I looked forward to university because hey, we'd be beyond all that sort of behaviour! But no, similar behaviour continued, albeit in different forms. Realizing that it wasn't going to stop just because I was out of school was kind of a culture shock moment for me, I have to admit."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,8,Sat Jun 13 04:06:01 2015 UTC,"Why do most guys just assume that girls will be into them?    Because if they don't they'll be forever alone, as girls never ask guys out."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,6,Wed Jun 10 09:18:42 2015 UTC,"Obviously in a situation where a guy is going to ask a girl out it's different. But I'm talking about when guys talk about or criticize girls, just for the sake of it; what do they think gives them the privilege to do that, why do they think their opinion is important?"
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,8,Wed Jun 10 09:28:20 2015 UTC,Patriarchy breeds narcissistic men with entitlement complexes who can always get a rise out of belittling women as their go-to means for an instant ego-boost. They see women as public property to decide on. The power discrepancy between men and women facilitates it to bully and ridicule women with impunity.
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,-2,Wed Jun 10 10:30:01 2015 UTC,Just reverse the genders and you'll have the answer.
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,JDNow,9,Wed Jun 10 09:37:32 2015 UTC,"No, do not reverse the genders. She's asking about her specific situation. Can you give a straightforward answer without derailing?  The reverse gender things never happens or do you see girls loudly rating stranger guys on the street?! no, because one, they would be beaten up and two, because society doesn't tell women men exist for their pleasure."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,2,Wed Jun 10 10:24:57 2015 UTC,Exactly
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,JDNow,-7,Wed Jun 10 10:43:25 2015 UTC,"Yes, yes I do. Difference is just that we're told to accept it, because women have preferences too. Actually, I experience women talking about men much more often than the opposite, because society expects women to care about looks much more than men, hence why it also expands to their partners. Why else would a woman be so afraid of being shorter than her partner?"
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,9,Wed Jun 10 12:52:21 2015 UTC,"You make ABSOLUTELY no sense whatsoever!  Can you recall the comments that female strangers keep making about you, please? You said height and penis size? Help me understand, girls you've never seen in your life, go around and debate the size of your penis for everyone to hear whilst pretending you're an inanimate object to judge? Surely they make inappropriate comments like ""I would never fuck that beast, he's too short."" Do they? Because that's what we're talking here, most girls here are talked about like that to their face.  FYI, there's some information specifically for men on the side bar. You're engaging in the pity party or pity olympics and that's why I am done here. Have a good life."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,JDNow,-2,Wed Jun 10 13:12:48 2015 UTC,"Yes and yes, I've experienced that plenty of times but I live in Sweden so it might be different here due to more equality."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,JDNow,5,Wed Jun 10 13:38:13 2015 UTC,"Strike 1 - no ""what about the reverse scenario"" derailing, and no pity party olympics, thanks."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,trail22,7,Thu Jun 11 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"Yes!!! I hate it so much when they say ""girls automatically think all guys want them"" when it's the complete opposite, guys think they're hot no matter how unattractive they are.   Just came from /r/foreveralone where they wondered, if girls have been brainwashed into having high expectations for guys' attractiveness by the media facepalm and how if not all guys are seen as attractive, there must be something wrong with girls, and they need to adjust their expectations doublefacepalm Meanwhile a guy has to be really, really ugly for people too agree that he's ugly but any girl who looks different from a supermodel is called hideous or disgusting.   Interesting that you mention the wrong era thing, because I have noticed how in those pictures from the 50's for example, the man always looks attractive and the woman is average at best. You hardly find a woman who is ""hot"" according to today's standards. That is to say, standards for women's attractiveness have risen and those for men fallen over time."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,drunk_fool,3,Tue Jun 9 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"having high expectations for guys' attractiveness by the media   Well, the other argument has been made that the media has inspired men to think all women are skinny as can be and ready to go at all times (see: porn)."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,queenofglum,7,Tue Jun 9 21:06:44 2015 UTC,"Sure, but the objection I had is that  1) women may enjoy the occasional man eye candy but do not demand men look like that in real life, while men literally expect those picture perfect women in real life.   2) all of a sudden, now that guys are being sexually objectified (Magic Mike, hot guys on vine, instagram) it has become an issue for them. For women it has always been a prerequisite to be conventionally hot to be on tv, while for men it hasn't. And now that they are being compared (not even to thedegree that women are) to attractive guys they notice how detrimental it is to their self-esteem."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,3,Tue Jun 9 21:21:07 2015 UTC,"I don't know, having never been a guy, but I think men get a lot of pressure to be buff -- their male peers will make fun of them or something for not being man enough.    In old comic books, the ads in the comics would be stories of slim guys who had buff men kick sand in their face.  Then they'd use the product and work out and get buff, and they'd get to go back and set things right with the buff men.  Anyway, I think that men have pressure to be buff, women have pressure to be hot.  I think right now, though, with Amy Schumer saying she can ""catch a dick,"" no problem at 160 pounds, and Melissa McCarthy headlining a movie that made $30 mill in its first weekend, we may be coming around to some sort of compromise.  At least, that's what I hope."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,queenofglum,8,Tue Jun 9 21:27:16 2015 UTC,"And that benefit of the doubt that you give them, I'd like to see extended to women. Because they think all a woman has to do to be hot is not ""eat like a pig"". Couldn't be further from the truth, but since they have decided it must be like that, it is. Over on that sub, all the FA guys talk about is, predictably only the hot women they're all after, the others are apparently not visible to them.   But I too am glad, that the long-awaited body positivity has come along finally."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,queenofglum,4,Tue Jun 9 21:44:25 2015 UTC,"And that benefit of the doubt that you give them, I'd like to see extended to women.    I'm with you there, sister!   Over on that sub, all the FA guys talk about is, predictably only the hot women they're all after, the others are apparently not visible to them.   Whenever they do a post on ""What are your dealbreakers"" -- almost none of them list physical descriptions -- the only one I've seen pop up a lot is to ""Not be obese.""    The reason I bring it up, is I aggressively hate it when people come in here and call us picky princesses.  I try not to call the guys basically the same thing."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,queenofglum,-1,Tue Jun 9 21:58:20 2015 UTC,"I completely agree. However, as a guy, being buff is the only requirement they need (mostly) to be seen as hot. Guys literally have to have some sort of deformity to be considered as ugly. Just go look at r/amiugly; the women are judged really harshly whereas the guys are mostly told they're really attractive, an exception being if they're overweight but they just get told to go workout. If a girl is fat on their they get a whole load of insults, and maybe 1 or 2 helpful comments.  If a guy doesn't have the best facial features he can just grow a beard. Yes, women can wear make-up, but then men say they don't like too much make-up. As a woman, you have to be this and you have to be  that; there's just too much pressure. And we get judged so harshly; if a guy doesn't think you're attractive he won't even bother to waste his breath on you."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,surfboard_watermelon,5,Tue Jun 9 21:39:26 2015 UTC,"Guys literally have to have some sort of deformity to be considered as ugly. Just go look at r/amiugly; the women are judged really harshly whereas the guys are mostly told they're really attractive   That's really interesting that you say that, because they say the exact opposite on our other sub.  I never visited amiugly cuz I don't like looking at pics of strangers, but it's very interesting how men walk away from it viewing it as a place where hot ladies get all upvoted and get a self-esteem boost, and I guess you and some other ladies see it as a place where women are nitpicked about their appearance.  It's like a Rorschach test... or confirmation bias... or both.  What's your opinion on that study (I think on OKCupid?) that they mention on the sub where women rate like 80 percent of dudes as below average (though the women would still message dudes they thought were below average)?"
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,queenofglum,2,Tue Jun 9 21:47:44 2015 UTC,"What's your opinion on that study (I think on OKCupid?) that they mention on the sub where women rate like 80 percent of dudes as below average (though the women would still message dudes they thought were below average)?   Well, men are judged for things other than their looks, such as what kind of job they do, how much they earn, etc. Which would explain why women would message those men, as they are seen as ambitious, hard working, etc.  A woman however, doesn't have that to fall back on as women in powerful working positions are often seen as ""intimidating"".   The fact that those women would message these men, despite of what they thought of their looks shows how easy they have it. A lot of men wouldn't even spit on a woman they didn't find attractive. A lot of the threads in the other FA sub prove that and make me sick to my stomach."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,chaosakita,2,Tue Jun 9 22:15:36 2015 UTC,"I think its a lie that men can romantically affect their prospects by things other then looks.  based on okcupid, profiles have no basis on how attractive a person is found.   the only thing that males are judged on is looks. People may say differently but the evidence proves that there is no difference for male attractiuveness based on just picture and picture and profile together.   Other evidence for example indian men are judged as the best writters by a writting metric they used but they are low comparably on the reply rates where as compared to different races.   Asian males usually make more money on average then white counterparts yet their average reply rate is much lower then white males.   Saying men can define themselves more then just by looks has been proven wrong at least within online dating. Saying looks arent as important for men is I believe  mostly a complete lie."
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,Noneerror,-1,Wed Jun 10 07:35:58 2015 UTC,"Well, that's just your opinion then."

ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,splek,4,Wed Jun 10 20:03:29 2015 UTC,Are you kidding me? Every guy is told to hit the gym and asked how tall they are so that they can be placed in some sort of attractiveness spectrum that women have.
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,cronumic,1 point,Wed Jun 10 09:29:32 2015 UTC,But that's ALL they need to do. For a guy muscle = attractiveness. And women face height discrimination too; anyone over 5'8 is seen as a giant.  Why do you FA guys even come to this sub; you're horribly biased and ignorant. Don't like what I'm saying? Leave.
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,kanicot,-1,Wed Jun 10 10:21:22 2015 UTC,"I'm not FA, I have a girlfriend. I just wanted to chime in because your own perspective seemed incredibly biased. Any man below 5'8 is seen as a dwarf by women, at least tall women are sought after in the media, modeling etc"
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,cronumic,2,Wed Jun 10 12:44:55 2015 UTC,You seem hell bent on making men seem more disempowered. You're not FA so your perspective isn't genuine is it?
ForeverAloneWomen,396xrc,kanicot,0,Wed Jun 10 17:13:57 2015 UTC,"A requirement aside from being tall, having a low hairline and an above average sized penis."

The only guy I've ever loved was 5'6"" and nearly bald at age 20. But he was funny, crazy smart, and a very kind person. He's engaged to be married now."
ForeverAloneWomen,394n58,uh-okay-I-guess,23,Tue Jun 9 05:53:52 2015 UTC,"People who aren't FA have a hard time making the distinction between ""being single"" and ""never had the opportunity to get romantically involved with anyone (or with anyone you actually like).""  They're right that being single has advantages, that it's important to be able to function as a single person, that some people are better off single than they are partnered, etc. What they don't seem to get is that for FA people, it's about more than just being single. It's about the dejection of feeling like you are a failure when you try not to be single."
ForeverAloneWomen,394n58,coralya,16,Tue Jun 9 12:12:08 2015 UTC,"Also its about choice. If a normal person decides that their relationship isn't very satisfying and they would rather be alone they can easily make that choice and be single for a while until they find someone better. We don't have that option, we are alone whether we like it or not, and that's the worst part if you ask me."
ForeverAloneWomen,394n58,NerdyNeet23,12,Tue Jun 9 12:39:47 2015 UTC,It is kind like me explaining to a starving person in Africa of all the perks of not being fat.
ForeverAloneWomen,394n58,_bluerabbit_,7,Tue Jun 9 11:12:18 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I mean, I'm not very keen on comparing FA to starvation since they are very different things, but it is a good comparison."

ForeverAloneWomen,394ckg,coralya,2,Tue Jun 9 06:06:54 2015 UTC,"This is a tangent, but it's my pet peeve when people justify their lack of desire to have kids by saying it's selfish to have a child biologically when there are kids in the foster system who need homes. God. Come talk to me once you've actually given up your time, career success, money, and energy to foster a child.  I can't tell you how many people I've heard say this stuff who never take any actual, practical steps toward fostering or adopting. Just admit you don't feel like being a parent right now, without bringing foster kids into it! Sheesh.  Sorry. Ignore me. Had to rant.  Edit: To add something a little more constructive, it's true that online dating is a huge time suck. I think it's healthy to try it, especially if you've never found anyone to date any other way, but it's healthy to cut off from it if you're not getting anywhere."
ForeverAloneWomen,394ckg,coralya,2,Tue Jun 9 06:15:20 2015 UTC,Those people aren't saying they're going to go foster a child -- they're just thinking people who actually want to raise kids should adopt instead of popping one out.

(one of the pals involved likes me a lot and has been really into my partner and I possibly not getting along which has not been happening. we have been great )  so I would have considered it a mistake except when I was with one of them, she asked me to text another to tell them when she would arrive there. she said she was cooking for them.

I still feel a sense of missing something (and/or someone), but I look at the people around me and don't see much to envy. I sort of envy people who are happy in their career or their love life, I guess, but it's hard to envy them much if I don't want that particular career or that particular relationship they're in.  In short, I felt like I was missing out a lot more back when I had less experience of life and was imagining what other people's lives were like rather than actually seeing them up close."
ForeverAloneWomen,3903sh,-lost-at-sea-,5,Mon Jun 8 10:25:41 2015 UTC,"Sometimes, yes. The thing that bothers me the most is how I've been unable to connect with people to form friendships. I can't seem to meet people who want to hang out or even communicate with me on a regular basis. I'll try to take the initiative to ask them to hang out, and they can't for whatever reason. But then they're doing stuff with other people all the time. So I know it's me. Generally I only feel bad about it when there's a concert or movie I'd like to see, or a new restaurant. I end up going by myself, so technically I don't ""miss out"" on anything, but it would be nice to have people to share these experiences with."

ForeverAloneWomen,3903sh,queenofglum,1 point,Tue Jun 9 01:32:49 2015 UTC,"All the time. My life is very structured, and I don't deviate much from a set routine. I wake up, go to work, work out, cook/eat, reddit/youtube/ bed. The thing is that I don't know what I'm supposed to do, so I just get by. I do whatever it takes to keep my superiors happy at work. I keep up with my friends the best I can. If they make an effort to come to my city, I make an effort to take them out. I think most of us are either college grads or going through school right now. The biggest difference I noticed post-education is how monotonous grown up life is for me at least."
ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,UglyKetchup,5,Sun Jun 7 05:18:40 2015 UTC,"If I decided I wanted to become a runner, and then I ran today and couldn't run for more than 50 feet, I might say, eh, I'm below average.  But I can practice every day, and I could get to be a decent runner -- maybe even do a marathon.    Anyway, you may not be particularly good at everything, but maybe there's something you enjoy doing enough that you'd do it repeatedly so you get pretty good at it.  The point is do something that you enjoy, and then it doesn't matter if you're the best at it.  It's not a competition -- it's about enjoying yourself."

The greats were great cause they (paint) a lot""  I used to morbidly obese as a kid I lost 90 pounds in high school, it was alot of dieting, hiking, and walking, at first it dropped slowly, climbing was hard, but every day i became better bit by bit and then it happened.   In the past year i gained a bit of weight back maybe 5 - 8 pounds, but this summer i am roadbiking 40km everyday, when i began in April i could only do 10KM, then 15KM, at first hills would destroy me, but now they are getting easier.   Persistent you need to push yourself and not quit, it will take time, impatience is bad virtue, just keep on hitting hard, even if your getting hit."
ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,conceal-identity,3,Sun Jun 7 19:44:28 2015 UTC,Running is the best suggestion I can give you in my limited scope. You get 1. Endorphins 2. In shape 3.

ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,AlcoholicJesus,4,Sun Jun 7 23:57:55 2015 UTC,"It also helps by switching your focus from what your body looks like to what it can help you to do in the world. Being complimented on looks will always ultimately make you feel like less of a person, because it involves being treated as an object. Accomplishing things will do the opposite, because it strengthens your sense of yourself as a subject, an agent."
ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,Under_the_bluemoon,2,Sun Jun 7 10:29:11 2015 UTC,"""Being complimented on looks will always ultimately make you feel like less of a person, because it involves being treated as an object."" This is a blanket statement that's not true for everyone. I enjoy seeing what I consider to be nice-looking people, animals, plants, art, etc, so why should I have to view it as a negative when others express their subjective, aesthetic appreciation of me if they do happen to find me attractive? They get to say what they want, and then I get to decide whether I want to feel like an object or not (...which is sometimes nice).  I agree with the rest of your comment, though. Compliments on looks should ideally be either a bonus or an irrelevance (depending on the person), not the main deal. The main deal is having agency and contributing to the world through that."
ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,CalzoneLayer,6,Sun Jun 7 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"You start as a beginner and practice until you can do it well. Everyone does. Yes, some people are going to have a propensity for certain things. I'm 5'1, 110 lbs. I'm never going to be a professional basketball player or a linebacker due to obvious physical limitations. I really enjoy yoga and have been doing it consistently for 8 months. Do I still suck at it? Yes, but I suck less than I did 8 months ago. I'm amazed at what my body is capable of. I go nearly everyday, and I see students at all levels of practice focusing on doing better. It's an incredibly positive atmosphere.   The only time I feel good about myself is when someone compliments me on my looks.   Okay, then we can establish the fact that you are not ugly. I'm willing to bet that you're actually very pretty, but it's still unhealthy to tie all your self-esteem to looks alone. Find something that interests you and just try."

Pinterest is awesome for this because there is an overload of stuff to do or create and most have step by step instructions on how to do them.   If you're into creative stuff, try loom knitting. Really easy to make cute chunky scarves and it is the easiest thing ever while being rewarding. I'd suggest a rectangular loom, but a lot of people use circular ones and I find those to be less straightforward though they both achieve the same thing. And I wouldn't mind showing you how to seal off the edge the easy way :).  Try writing. I wrote around a 2-4 million words, three full 'novels', and a yearlong break/block before I wrote anything good, and even my work that got put on Project Fiction I have problems with and I haven't written anything great since July of last year. Try mibba, really good community, it'll take a while to get some backing if you're good, but they have a comment system. Even if you don't write, they have chatrooms and blogs and awesome layout makers and even better stories.   If you're interested in looks, ever try /r/MakeupAddiction ? Given, 65% of the top posts are just the top posts because 'upvote the pretty girl', but at the very least they're pretty and know how to apply bomb ass makeup. I've found a bunch of great tips there and now old people call me attractive rather than getting a bunch of 'bless that child' crap. P.S. if money is a issue, Walmart will refund all makeup without question so long as you have the receipt b/c makeup is a bunch of trial and error. I've gone through six or seven different foundations before I found something nice.   IIRC, you're young. Can you drive? I'm 17 and driving was a huge game changer. Sometimes, I'll just drive around just to drive around. I used to take a different way home everyday when I was in school and I've seen some remarkable stuff. I go to all of the local Goodwills on a regular basis, just to look at the bizarre stuff and the clothes, which can be really nice stuff. I've found Versace, Lily Pulitzer, and Dolce and Gabbana in a Goodwill and then I've found a set of IHOP syrup containers and a sex toy in another.   Those are my suggestions, I've dealt with feelings of inadequacy, and still do when it comes to my looks. But, idk, I've kinda let some stuff go and just focus on doing whatever I want. Like if I wanna make a t-shirt quilt, I'm going to do it. I probably won't finish it, but I did it for the sake of doing it."

ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,DeathMonkeyRobot,2,Thu Jun 11 15:43:53 2015 UTC,usually its the moments where you are not doing anything that you feel bad.   So its as much do things that make you happy as avoid doing things or being places (Like alone in your room) that make you unhappy.
ForeverAloneWomen,38vmne,seagasm,1 point,Sun Jun 7 20:49:16 2015 UTC,I'd say shift your focus from just doing things for the sake of doing something to doing what you enjoy or try new things and stick with what interests you. Don't do things just to appear impressive to others. People value different things so focus on pleasing yourself.

Or owning my own style. Learning something new. They're all things that require confidence and courage. I'm good at being alone. The moral of this story is that being good at something doesn't always require skill. It could be anything, big or small that makes you feel good and in control. It doesn't have to be impressive so long as it makes you feel strong and competent. It could be that you made a meal that's totally satisfying. Win! You finished reading a book. Win!

Not brilliant by any means, but I can play most songs I want to learn and I can sing/play at the same time.   I would find something you want to learn/try that you can become better at, even if you suck at the beginning.

When I look back at it now I dont think about the girl who rejected me basically before I started talking to her, I think of the friend who believed in me and wanted to see me happy. He didn't see anything wrong with trying to fix up the short asian guy with the tall white girl.   I don't know if its relevant or if I have a point.

ForeverAloneWomen,3826vh,-lost-at-sea-,9,Tue Jun 30 19:48:01 2015 UTC,"Goal #1: Send a message to a guy on OKCupid. I clicked ""like"" on his profile. It appeared that he hadn't logged in in a couple of weeks. Well, he ""liked"" me back! So now's the time to send him a message, I just need to pluck up the courage. All advice welcome... Goal #2: This one is carried over from May--read a book for pleasure.  Goal #3: Continue lifting weights. Go to a new yoga class (my usual yoga class is out of session, since the student teacher is not here for the summer).   I feel like I could add more goals, but I don't want to overwhelm myself. Goal #1 is most important to me right now.  Update 6/15: So far, I've either failed or faltered with this month's goals. I'll cover the faltering ones first. Here goes:   Goal 2: I think I might just abandon this one. I'm working on a project that is dominating a lot of my time, so I just don't have time for the new reading yet. I hate not being able to get totally immersed in a book, so I'd rather wait until I have more time. Goal 3: Meh. I'm doing okay with the fitness stuff, but not nearly with as much regularity as I had hoped. I'll keep doing what I can. Goal 1: Marking this one as a fail. I thought I crafted a nice message. I referenced a couple of things he had in his profile and tried to start a conversation. That was over a week ago now and no response. I haven't stalked his profile or anything, but I did check once over the weekend and saw that he has been online. He hasn't shown up as a visitor to my page since I sent the message, so I just don't know. I don't think he's going to respond and I'm okay with that. At first I was confused because why would he like my profile and then ignore my message? But even a rejection is experience and I guess I need to take whatever ""experience"" I can get.   I've been on OKCupid for a month now and it's really, really...""blah"" is the only thing that comes to mind. I've received a lot of messages, but mostly ""hi"" or something about my looks/physical appearance. Or the messages will be from guys that I'm just not attracted to at all, which makes me feel even worse (am I the proverbial beggar who is being too choosy? Ugh). And then yesterday I received a message from a quite attractive man who had an explicit requirement on his profile that any lady messaging him be a ""believer in Jesus Christ."" I have on my profile that I'm agnostic (I lean strongly toward atheism). I'm not sure why he's messaging me, because I can't be converted.  I've had conversations with three different men so far. Then I took about a week away from OKC to work on my project. When I logged back in, two of those three guys had either deactivated or blocked me. But I wasn't feeling any chemistry with any of them (but how do you feel it online???). I can definitely see that this is going to demand a lot of my time. We'll see what the rest of the month brings.  Update 6/30: I guess I could say that I gave up on my goals this month, but I actually did most of the things I set out to do. I sent the message on OKCupid, and I continued to hit the gym. I just wasn't very successful at either of those goals. Oh well, here's to a better July!"
ForeverAloneWomen,3826vh,raletta,2,Tue Jun 2 02:37:52 2015 UTC,"Tip for Goal #1. Don't just send a ""How are you?""  Whatever message you decide to send, include a part that addresses something mentioned on his profile that you like or could relate to. It's a great way to start an exchange with someone, talking about something you both know/like.   So for example, when I send a message, I might say ""I really like Bon Iver too! What's your favorite song by them?""  or ""You watch Game of Thrones, what do you think of the season so far?"" etc.   Send a message. If he replies, great. If he doesn't, there are tons of other profiles waiting to be explored. He wouldn't have liked you back if he DIDN'T want you to message him. He's also more likely to be impressed if you take the initiative and messaged him, because in general guys are expected to be the ones who send the first message."

ForeverAloneWomen,3826vh,queenofglum,5,Tue Jun 30 22:47:24 2015 UTC,I'll keep it real so I don't create false expectations for myself.  • Stop binge eating. I think I may have a stomach ulcer (Self diagnosis is bad but oh well) and everytime I binge I feel like someone is stabbing me with a rusty ice pick.  • Lose weight. My BMI says I'm normal but I'll look and feel better if I drop some more kilos. I'm kind of at a plateau so I'll be realistic and expect to be 2 or 3 kilos lighter by the end of June.  • Write on my journal at least five times a week. It keeps me in an overall better mood and helps me keep track of hormonal changes and stuff.
ForeverAloneWomen,3826vh,queenofglum,2,Mon Jun 1 19:05:30 2015 UTC,"Keeping it real is the way to go, thanks for participating =)  Your goals are really good and you'll get the usual mid/end of the month reminders, lucky you!

Well, when I say it's going great... I haven't even hit 5K yet, but my goal right now isn't to run well, just consistently. I'm taking it very slow and easy to make sure I'm enjoying myself enough to stick with it. In the past I would just destroy myself on every run, and it made me having negative feelings about running over the long haul.  But yes! I'm running twice a week, every week, and I feel great. I'd forgotten how much more I feel in control of my life when I run regularly."

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,UglyKetchup,41,Sun May 31 19:27:06 2015 UTC,"True, the double standard is insane. They think attractive women should be able to look past an unattractive guy's looks and see his winning personality. Because you know, these men who constantly complain about being alone/a virgin because hot women don't want  them are such a joy to be around. At the same time, men aren't expected to look past a woman's looks. It's always ""well, looks are important. How am I suppose to date a person I'm not physically attracted to?"". Don't you think some women might feel the same way? Why are women suppose to look past men's looks but men are allowed to judge whether or not they would date a woman solely on her looks?"
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,ihatebeingfa,19,Sun May 31 20:58:54 2015 UTC,"They don't, a man will happily date an unemployed, young attractive woman, and in fact he will be absolutely thrilled.   Is that really still true? At least once a month on OkCupid Reddit someone brings up the topic of how unfair it is that a man has to always pay for dates."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,queenofglum,9,Sun May 31 23:40:27 2015 UTC,"Plus, if she's unemployed and dependent on him, suddenly she's a golddigger."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,JDNow,5,Mon Jun 1 02:46:23 2015 UTC,"Yup, we can't win..."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,queenofglum,12,Mon Jun 1 23:09:54 2015 UTC,What research? Because from personal experience I absolutely wouldn't agree at all  that most women would turn down an attractive guy because he didn't have a good job.   Things like jobs become faaaaaar more important into your 30s but I just don't agree at all if we're taking about people in their 20s.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Somenakedguy,4,Tue Jun 2 02:51:56 2015 UTC,just passing along what I misread.    FTFY.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,JDNow,3,Mon Jun 1 02:08:23 2015 UTC,"Not sure why you got downvoted so much either, however, you can still link to the research you mentioned so that it doesn't come off as hearsay only."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,FAWmod,4,Mon Jun 1 02:11:34 2015 UTC,"""only about 33 percent said that unemployment was a deal breaker that cannot be overlooked""  That's a far cry from 90%."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,JDNow,-14,Mon Jun 1 23:10:22 2015 UTC,"Assuming simaler dress, success level and athletic shape; a short guy who is non white will have a harder time getting a date then the same for a women (Assuming she is not black).   Add to the fact women always talk abotu how important personality, sense of humor, and intellegence is; not how important what  height they are.   Men aren't any worse then women when it comes to looks. Its just men are more honest and things that make them unattractive like heigth and ethnicity are unchangeable but still massivley affect how attractive people see them."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,trail22,16,Mon Jun 1 20:39:55 2015 UTC,"This attitude annoys me so much. But thinking about it, it made me realize that almost every classical story, legend, fairly tale and also modern media like movies and games supports the message ""guy does xy,pretty girl is impressed/saved, guy gets pretty girl"".   I think it is hard for them to realize that the real world doesn't work that way.   I just want to see/read one story were the genders are reversed. Sure there are many stories were the girl is the hero, but she also has to be super pretty or change the way she looks (""ugly duckling turn to swan""-moment) to impress a guy."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,raletta,9,Mon Jun 1 21:36:26 2015 UTC,"Absolutely agree with you. It is an issue. In fact, to try to think of an example...I really had to dig into my memory.  -A Song of Ice and Fire. A user on this very sub once remarked that Brienne of Tarth was the closest literary character to a female FA. Brienne is described to be not ugly, but certainly not attractive. While she initially tries to fit in in a society that values only attractiveness in women, she soon rejects it in lieu of staying true to herself. She's an expert swordsman, fiercely loyal, with strong moral character.   A few characters in the book recognize her positive qualities and her personality, the things that REALLY matter, and do not judge her for her physical traits. Sadly, A Song of Ice and Fire isn't the type of series where there is a ""happy ending"" or a ""guy gets the girl."" But Brienne is the BEST written female character I've ever seen, and she is one held beloved by the fans."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,GreenSkyFish,4,Mon Jun 1 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"That's true. A Song of Ice and Fire has many interesting, less stereotypical characters and character development arcs."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,raletta,-2,Mon Jun 1 23:08:48 2015 UTC,"Try reading malazan, the women in the army are just as equal as the men, and sure they face the same double-standards that women in our age do, but they overcome it with force of will, not through some man coming to the rescue.  Reading about Hetan, a barbarian woman who actively was the epitome of strength and ferocity, being brought down was absolutely heartbreaking.  Can't spoil too hard, but yeah.    A lot of epic fantasy defies classic tropes.  I found game of thrones still had the nobles isolated in their silly struggles, while in Malazan, those people already had their just desserts before the series started :/."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,3,Mon Jun 1 19:17:40 2015 UTC,Brienne is described to be not ugly     She isn't ugly at all in the TV show but described as hideous in the books if I remember correctly.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,6,Mon Jun 1 14:56:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely ugly in the books. She's also less stoic, more pessimistic-disparaging.  Sort of angry at how her life is, so she's pissing in the wind :P."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,JDNow,7,Tue Jun 2 05:22:22 2015 UTC,"change the way she looks (""ugly duckling turn to swan""-moment)   Yeah, I hate that, too.  Like there's always a moment in the movie where she has to dress up for some reason, and then the guy is all like hubba hubba."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,-5,Tue Jun 2 08:42:40 2015 UTC,"Really?  Read the Malazan series, or Game of Thrones.  You actively see the disparity in Epic fantasy, some women may try to live that trope, and some men might, but all the other characters?  They have entirely separate motivations, and equally valid.    Some of my favourite malazan characters were the female heavies, or just some of the infantry.  These women are heroes through their own actions, not being beautiful."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,queenofglum,28,Wed Jun 3 02:43:41 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about this the other day when I was lurking on the other Foreveralone forum. I noticed that one is more active than ours. I see a lot of posts complaining that women are so shallow and manipulative because they only want men that are not just successful, but physically attractive. Lamenting how they'll never find anyone because they are unattractive/unemployed. I don't understand that mentality. What they're basically saying is that they have nothing to offer the other person other than their personality and judging from their bitterness that's not even a valid selling point for them. Dating is like interviewing for a job. You have to have at least some qualities that your potential employer/partner wants."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,breakdownnao,20,Tue Jun 2 11:21:03 2015 UTC,"Yes, their attitudes scare me sometimes."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,breakdownnao,19,Wed Jun 3 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"Its also always ""That feel when no hot GF"". Like, they're hopelessly lonely but ""fuck if i'm stuck with an ugly chick!"" They only see pretty girls, ugly chicks do not exist to them."

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,dat_throwaway8,3,Sun May 31 22:42:39 2015 UTC,"I'm so glad we're doing the monthly improvement thread. It's always going to be easier to wallow.

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,splek,17,Thu Jun 4 13:14:41 2015 UTC,"Because cognitive dissonance is a hell of a drug.  I used to be exactly that. I always complained that all these beautiful girls would never want to date me yet I would always laugh at the girls that did like me. I would pick out all their flaws and their faults so as to prove why I wouldn't date them yet I would get mad at attractive girls for not wanting to date/fuck me.  I grew up. I learned that empathy and sympathy are critical.   The bad part is that the end of that journey is discovering that you will be alone forever. It's really hard to admit that to yourself. It's hard to admit that you will never find someone that likes you as you like them. It'll always be the Shakespearean tragedy whereby those that like you, you do not like and those you like, don't like you back.  In the end, it is the truth and the sooner you accept it, the sooner you move on and do better things. Some of these may include focusing on yourself and being the best you can be for the sheer sake of doing it, not to try and counteract the inevitable."

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,GreenSkyFish,10,Sat Jun 6 10:44:50 2015 UTC,"Because society tells men that women are objects, their only worth is in their looks.  If a girl is ugly she is worthless and trash.  Like someone mentioned even childrens cartoons portray ugly people as bad, and beautiful people are good.  Good looking/hot women are the object of desire.  IF a good looking woman rejects them it makes them extremely angry because it makes them feel worthless.   Resorting to an ugly woman is unthinkable for most men.   THey would have to be extremely desperate.  /negative rant"
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,GeladoBubblegum,3,Sat Jun 6 13:10:31 2015 UTC,"I see this all the time. Lots of guys who think they are the shit when they are out of shape, poor-mannered, etc. and constantly belittle women for not being thin or dressed a certain way, and only want ""hot"" girls.

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,GeladoBubblegum,1 point,Mon Jun 1 23:02:33 2015 UTC,This. I urge OP to remember that Reddit plays host to a particular age group/gender/interests etc.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,trail22,4,Tue Jun 2 03:04:17 2015 UTC,"This really does irritate me. Sometimes I just feel upset and really which to vent but I never know where. I don't even go to the other subreddit because I've noticed quite early on that it is a lot like that.  I never quite got these that blame the others. For me it's logic, it's like if 995 people say you're wrong and 5 say you're right, if you're smart you'll understand that you're wrong, the collective opinion is almost always right. So I don't get why some guys just say that it's women fault. It's 1 vs the entire women population. My only reasoning is that they're the ""I'm always right""  type or they just don't see women as equal and so treat them differently. Being FA (in relationship side) I always approached the issue by thinking what is wrong with me, and never once blamed women. One time that is particularly etched into my head was in the beginning of my depression where I was just thinking about what was wrong with me.   I'll be honest I always feel a bit awkward posting in this sub considering I'm a guy, and even more in these kinds of subjects but I think it's possible to have a more level headed discussion in this subreddit than the other."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,subarashiisekai,3,Sun May 31 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"I guess it feels better for them to blame someone else than themselves. They're falling into a deep dark hole this way, if they don't change their ways soon. Sometimes I wonder where they get this mindset from. I never seen women blame men for not dating them."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,subarashiisekai,2,Fri Jun 5 22:49:04 2015 UTC,"Of course, it's easier to blame other people than themselves. It feels awful to blame ourselves, who likes to admit that we're wrong. Thing is, you don't realize you're going down that path. No idea where it comes from, maybe it's just a natural thing or something from society, a way of thinking.   I've always feared myself going down that path without knowing, so I always said my women friends to ""kill me"" if I ever do. I've seen a friend going down this path."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,0,Tue Jun 2 15:57:26 2015 UTC,I have ... I have seen black women blame men. I have seen succesful women say that men were too intimidated by them.   I have seen women blame men because they never approach less attractive women.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,5,Fri Jun 19 09:22:00 2015 UTC,I'm sure a lot of men would say the same about women.

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,0,Tue Jun 2 05:12:26 2015 UTC,"Some people, both men and women, are going to be shallow. And men regularly complain about how shallow women can be, just as you are complaining now about how shallow men can be. Why bother caring what shallow people think?"
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,mpnsk,0,Mon Jun 1 23:42:27 2015 UTC,"If I wanted to give you the right frame of reference, it would this sort of a diatribe:   ""Why are some women like this?  They constantly bitch that the men they can't get that are shallow all the while complaining about the men they can get, calling them pussies and fatties and nerds.   They think they deserve a rich, handsome man, all the while being unkind and laughing at every guy that asks them out.  Then they moan that these guys don't want to hang out, or go on dates, and just want to screw.  Like no, NOT all guys are like that, just the guys YOU're after are like that.  Just something that was bothering me.""  That's what it's like. Of course, I understand not all women think that way, and the few that do, are dooming themselves.  I don't get angry at them, it's more I'm sympathetic, it's a very lonely thing to do."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,FAWinner,6,Tue Jun 2 00:10:59 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not sympathetic. I'm not sympathetic to anyone who acts like that. It annoys me. I really don't understand what you're trying to argue here.   Don't look at men on certain messageboards as being representative of even a small minority of men, if I did the same for say, some women on tumblr? I'd probably find a way to convince myself to be homosexual.   Huh??"
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,starship7201u,0,Tue Jun 2 07:03:22 2015 UTC,"I guess above all things, I'm attempting to assert that it's a waste of energy to be frustrated at these posts you've seen.  If you want to, there's a lot of stuff to be angry at in the world, or frustrated with.  There's a wisdom in forgiving someone before they ask for forgiveness."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,DrunkGreyhound,4,Wed Jun 3 21:37:59 2015 UTC,So you're telling me not to be angry about things I'm angry about. I'm fine you don't have to worry about me.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,kittyinmypocket,-1,Sun May 31 23:00:58 2015 UTC,"I'm not telling you to do anything, I'm just saying there's wisdom in not getting angry, I'm commenting with my opinion, as reddit is for.   I'm sorry if I upset you, it's a legitimate argument and point you've brought up, I admitted, I've been on that side, being frustrated with the opposing gender.  Probably'll happen again in my life, haha."

ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,trail22,-4,Mon Jun 1 01:38:30 2015 UTC,"I'm not trying to argue, you asked for what men would say, if they had the same sort of angry stance about unattainable women in their lives.    I'm saying that I've seen enough on Tumblr to believe that there is definitely a small population of females that are angry at men, and post very angry things about them.  If I thought these were a representative sample, I may have some angry thoughts towards women myself.    As it is now anyway, I've said ""women are the devil"" maybe twice in the last six months?  I was so angry both of those times at the two women that wronged me, but ironically enough I overheard a coworker at the exact same time say ""Men are absolute idiots"" about her own husband giving her grief, haha.  Everybody has a bone to pick sometimes :)."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,FAWinner,2,Wed Jun 3 02:53:33 2015 UTC,Soooo....?
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,sardinemanR,3,Wed Jun 3 03:01:31 2015 UTC,"The answer is simple: porn.  Men may be believed to be the more accepting gender in the sexual context, but having had 10+ orgasms this week already really skews your perception of attractiveness.  Women, I believe, have less quantifiable signs to look for in a partner than looks.  Ones that are not as easily put on steroids by porn/movies and more readily projected onto the average joe. So I guess you just can't follow their aloof expectations. (Thank God. I can compete with James Deen's height, but that's it.)  In their defense, if what I am saying is correct, they can't help it. Most won't even realize where their standards come from (not their mother)."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,sardinemanR,3,Wed Jun 3 03:06:59 2015 UTC,The answer is simple: porn.     The amount of old/fat/ugly guys screwing gorgeous girls is too damn high. And unrealistic.
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,trail22,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:09:58 2015 UTC,"Everyone on /r/foreverlone complain about all women wanting Chads, even the ""fat"", ""ugly"" - that's why those women are FA, because they feel entitled to a Chad.   I guess we all suffer from confirmation bias."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,trail22,2,Wed Jun 3 03:17:31 2015 UTC,"I would say this happens due to the Patriarchy that we live under in our world. bell hooks talks about this, somewhat, in ain't i a woman. How the religious groups of long ago demonized women and unfortunately a lot of people still think along those lines as far as women are concerned."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,trail22,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:18:22 2015 UTC,"I agree, it is a pretty shitty double standard that some men have and it's one of the reason's I hate the whole ""nice guy"" mantra that a lot of guys use. I've been guilty of thinking like that myself but I usually step back and realize how hypocritical that type of thinking is since I'm technically responsible for ""friendzoning"" a girl because of her weight. Sorry you have to deal with morons who think like that."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,sardinemanR,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:05:18 2015 UTC,"I think this goes past FA, a lot of these sentiments are present in pick-up culture/trp places as well. Whenever anything seen as negative is done by the woman (she only dates for looks, money, sex, whatever, manipulates, dates up/out of league, even has sex...) she's bad, all women are like that, beaches and shores. When a guy does similar things (manipulate, cheat, use for sex or money, whatever), it's just ""part of the game, it's different for a man, you do what you gotta do"" etc. and suddenly it's understandable, somehow more noble. If a woman dates up or can get a lot of sex easily, it's bad, but it's the same thing some men are trying to do at the same time.   I'm not interested in playing these kinds of games, but after seeing some of the vile shit out there, I'm not even mad when either side does these things to each other. Dog eat dog world, and I just want to stay out of it."
ForeverAloneWomen,37znkr,Foliagus,-10,Wed Jun 3 03:07:12 2015 UTC,"Because men are ussually the ones who have to put themselves out there and choose to get turned down.   Ask any man or women who does all the  asking out and goes aout of their way to approach and you will find out that the process of asking people out or even talking to people  with no success or even much friendliness turns people bitter.   At one point I had to stop doing things like speed dating, bars, and online dating. It turns men bitter and a lot of times they become angry because anger and bitterness is easier and many times a better coping mechanism then depression and self loathing."
ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,chaosakita,7,Sat May 30 08:20:46 2015 UTC,"I've been to parties but mostly just family things. Never been to a party like the kind you see on TV or hear kids around school/campus talking about. I've always been curious as to whether they're as wild as they're portrayed but I know I'd be super awkward and wouldn't know what to do if I ever did go to one. Never been to one because I've never been invited. My close friend isn't a big partier and if my other friend even goes to those kinds of parties, I'm pretty sure I'm not the first person she thinks of inviting because of the aforementioned reasons."
ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,tantivywithscissors,2,Sat May 30 12:14:15 2015 UTC,"Same, I've been to family parties but never the college type of party. Even with family parties I tend to stand around awkwardly and not interact much, so I definitely would be too shy to fit into one of those crazy parties."
ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,NerdyNeet23,-1,Sat May 30 13:40:15 2015 UTC,"The wildest parties were always unintentional, usually a halloween party or something that somebody got too drunk at, broke some windows, and shouted at people.  Nowadays, even though I used to throw these kind of parties, we like to just have a few people over to play board games.  Quiet parties are the best parties."

ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,blueblue5,2,Sat May 30 17:33:33 2015 UTC,"The only ""real"" party I went to was boring as fuck. Everyone was drinking, smoking pot and/or eating and generally weren't talkative. I stayed a little, talked to school friends, played with the host's cat and left before midnight with other bored-to-death people. Not my cup of tea."
ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,-lost-at-sea-,2,Sat May 30 22:41:12 2015 UTC,"I've only ever been to a dinner party, which seems to be what the ""college party"" evolves into after everyone is over 25. Although that's based on my assumption of what a ""college party"" is, because I've never been to one of those (never was invited to any).  The dinner party was a potluck dinner, where everyone just ate and caught up on each others' lives. I was only invited because it was hosted by a guy I dated briefly. I sometimes think he decided to dump me after that, despite my genuine efforts to mesh with his friends."

ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,uh-okay-I-guess,2,Mon Jun 1 05:44:19 2015 UTC,"I only ever went to one party of the sort that the verb ""to party"" applies to. It was freshman year and I was curious about frat parties, so I went to the ""it"" party one Friday night.  I was shocked by how boring it was. A few of the guys who were totally smashed looked like they were having a good time, but no one else seemed to be. I don't know, I was a naive 18-year-old and I guess I expected a frat party to be some kind of ecstatic, bacchanalian experience--not one I'd necessarily want to participate in, but still I expected to at least get why other people wanted to participate.  After that I just never bothered with parties of the alcohol-fueled type. I'd always hear people talk about having to take care of their stoned/drunk friends at parties, and I was way too selfish to put myself in a situation where I might have to babysit someone who was throwing-up drunk. Doesn't reflect well on my generosity as a person, I know."
ForeverAloneWomen,37tocs,UglyKetchup,2,Mon Jun 1 05:59:17 2015 UTC,"I've never been to the stereotypical college party, where the point is to be social, dance, get drunk, do drugs, have casual sex, and meet other people who are also interested in those things. That's basically the opposite of my interests.  I've been to ""adult"" parties because it was necessary to remain on good terms with family, but they are still basically the same thing, except with less drugs and casual sex and more socializing. I usually get tired of it in 20-30 minutes, so I try to find a quiet place to sit and wait for other people to start leaving so I can leave too."

ForeverAloneWomen,37ssx6,onelonelytossaway,9,Sat May 30 10:51:32 2015 UTC,I feel like that sometimes. I feel very confused with life and not so much broken as hopelessly lost. I have no clue what i'm doing ever with anyone in my life and i just keep feeling like i'm that clingy annoying person. I feel like i'm failing other people all the time i feel like i'm failing myself on top of that.

The thought of sexual contact and intimacy with a girl actually scares me because I'm convinced that I would fuck it up somehow given the chance. The fact that the movies make it look so natural and easy makes me feel even worse because I wish I could be like them, but I'm not and that just fucks me up inside mentally."

ForeverAloneWomen,37sfb4,UglyKetchup,12,Sat May 30 00:38:46 2015 UTC,I think for women to tell other women that they are pretty it's an easy thing for most of us to do? Like i'm not sexually attracted to women but i can tell when i find someone pretty. But because of that it's easy for me to be like omg your so pretty!!! i wish i had your hair vs girl you look so fine lets make out? those are very different things. I mean how often do you tell men you think they are attractive? now how often do you tell a friend or someone you know thats a female that they are pretty or look really good?   if your like me i never tell men anything and friends and even random women that are killing it with there looks i will say oh you look really on point today or pretty or something along those lines.
ForeverAloneWomen,37sfb4,onelonelytossaway,7,Sat May 30 00:54:58 2015 UTC,"You're probably Girl Pretty rather than Guy Pretty. Girl Pretty is more related to your style and grooming, while Guy Pretty is more related to sexual attraction.   My sister is the definition of Guy Pretty, and I am definitely more Girl Pretty. We essentially have very similar facial features and body types, but when we go out, she straightens her hair, wears sultry make up, and much tighter clothing, while I keep my hair curly, wear trendy make up, and am more focused on looking stylish over sexy.   In my personal opinion, (as someone who went to a women's college and works in the fashion industry) women are a lot more shallow than men. If a classmate who's not your best friend says you're pretty, you're probably actually pretty. If you weren't she wouldn't have said anything at all. You're just probably not sexy, which you can change with clothing and make up if you really want to.    Though, I've noticed the older I get, that being Girl Pretty attracts a much different type of guy than Guy Pretty."
ForeverAloneWomen,37sfb4,bossyfosy,5,Sat May 30 21:09:22 2015 UTC,"Women are not less 'shallow' than men, they just tend to give their female acquaintances compliments more often."

ForeverAloneWomen,37sfb4,GreenSkyFish,1 point,Sat May 30 02:49:33 2015 UTC,Well...I've heard that a lot of women sort of really like that metrosexual kind of look. At least there's that.

ForeverAloneWomen,37sfb4,enhancedmuppet,2,Sat May 30 04:13:55 2015 UTC,"I wanted to comment on this post but I'm not getting the option for some reason, so here's a direct reply instead:  as a guy who frequently browses /r/foreveralone, I have to say that yes: the majority of men are quite shallow and very demanding with regards to physical attraction. Almost all of these posters have been conditioned by movies, TV shows, posters, billboards, magazines, and countless other media to believe that women are either Mila Kunis sexy, Taylor Swift pretty, or downright ugly. They have no understanding/tolerance of the fact that women come in all shapes and sizes, and that honestly sucks. In the end, it's the same problem for both sides: nether is attractive/charming enough to attract the guys/girls they want. I think the only real solution is for people to open their eyes and let go of their unrealistic standards, but idk how to make that happen. Sorry for not being much help, but it's been a big problem for me as well."
ForeverAloneWomen,37sfb4,mightykushthe1st,2,Sat May 30 04:29:27 2015 UTC,I notice a lot of the men on there say they would never date an ugly women but they probably find 90% of women unnatractive

ForeverAloneWomen,37kx6c,bejeweledlyoness,7,Thu May 28 20:51:46 2015 UTC,I would never do it primarily because I don't really want children. But there are other reasons too. I think kids optimally need two parents. And I too suffer from depression and would never forgive myself if I wasn't able to provide the care a child needed because I didn't have a partner to help me.
ForeverAloneWomen,37kx6c,Laurasaur28,6,Thu May 28 17:00:34 2015 UTC,"That's a concern of mine as well. I already feel like I wouldn't be able to vent about any difficulties related to being a single mom to friends and family because it is something I chose. I DIDN'T choose to be undesirable to men, I chose not to let that stop me from building a family.   I grew up without a dad. My parents divorced when I was a year old because he was a POS. Getting married and having kids doesn't guarantee that I won't end up a single mom. Divorce and infidelity rates show that. I'll just be more prepared."
ForeverAloneWomen,37kx6c,bossyfosy,7,Thu May 28 19:31:03 2015 UTC,"I think that if you have the financial means and emotional stability to do so, go for it!   Both of my parents were raised by single moms (both of their dads were alive, just absentee), and they, and all of their siblings turned out to be brilliant, loving, amazing people who went on to find loving relationships (so screw the person who said your kid would be FA as well!)   I also personally know two women who have chosen to be single moms. One is a FA who has  has an MBA and is the VP of a company, and the other is a two-time divorcee who happens to be a director of a major retailer. While these women obviously have the financial means to make single parenthood a bit easier, they still have acknowledged that while it can be hard, they purposely chose to be single moms because raising a child in the loving environment they already had was a better option for them than waiting around for someone to be in a relationship with who might not end up being the best dad in the end.   ALSO, to all the people who are saying children should be raised by a mother and father, what do you say then to gay couples with children? Or widows or widowers who choose not to remarry? Or orphans raised by family members? You have NOTHING to say because that is not a valid argument as to why she should not be a single mom. Just because someone has heteronormative, patriarchal parents doesn't mean they won't be fucked up. Love, support, and stability are what a child needs in a parent. How many there are, and the sex of the parent is irrelevant.   P.S. If I'm 33 and still single, I'm going to be a single mom by choice as well. Having a healthy child and low-risk pregnancy is much more important to me than waiting around for some guy!"
ForeverAloneWomen,37kx6c,queenofglum,2,Fri May 29 18:54:12 2015 UTC,"No, I would not be a single mom by choice. For one thing I never wanted children and also like you I suffer from depression. At my worse I couldn't even hold down a job or remember to feed myself.  Raising a child by yourself is very stressful. Even more difficult if you're struggling with depression. But if it's something you've always wanted and you're taking the necessary steps to ensure that this child will be raised right, then by all means do it. You deserve to be happy with or without a significant other."
ForeverAloneWomen,37kx6c,viversemrumo,2,Fri May 29 00:17:12 2015 UTC,This is something that I would consider in the future. I haven't really looked into it it yet so I don't know how much it costs. How expensive is it exactly?
ForeverAloneWomen,37kx6c,Darlamariexx,3,Fri May 29 18:42:09 2015 UTC,"One of my close childhood friends had a grandma like this. I remember one day asking about her grandpa and she said she never had one because her mother was adopted by her grandma even though there wasn't a ""grandpa"" in the picture. The grandma was a very strict catholic woman who prided herself on her virginity at 70+ years old.. I remember my childhood friend being ashamed of it but I thought it was kinda cool cause she had a grandma/grandpa as one person!

It's just as important to know that there are people out there who don't find romantic relationships easily and that it is not the end of the world. It DOES feel like the end of the world sometimes but at least in this day and age I don't have to let that stop me from having a family.

If it's something you really want I would be like you and saving and start to talk to your doctor NOW !!! like make an appointment now today to go see how fertile you really are. For some having kids in there early 30's is already to late. For some they still have tons of time.

I can appreciate your view and ideally I would want my child to have a father but there is no reason for me to believe that will happen. I don't want to die alone or end up in a nursing home or hospital with no one to advocate for me.

Not all men can be good fathers. Not all men will stick around.    You'll be fine if you watch out for red flags. Most men would die to protect their children.

I have always wanted to be a mother I just didn't expect to never find a SO. As I've said in the main post, since going on meds I don't feel so crushingly lonely. I appreciate the few friends I do have and the great relationship I have with my mother.  I'm in a place now where the timing is right and my job is flexible enough that I can make time for children. I'm getting older and have no prospects. Yes, you're absolutely correct that potentially bad fathers will have red flags but there are no men to screen! (This is FA Women, right?)   I've had contact with my father before and he was a POS, really. He was never anything to me but he tried to control me and set expectations for me and would call me a failure in a hundred ways when I didn't meet them. I cut him off for good and I'm better for it. I don't think I would have survived the lows if he had been my father all my life. My mother never ever ever made me feel like a failure even after enrolling in my 5th college. It's not about having a mother and father. It's about love."

ForeverAloneWomen,37fqut,Toridon88,7,Wed May 27 12:21:12 2015 UTC,"I can relate to that. I mainly get bad looks from men. Girls/women don't seem to ever do it, but men and boys do it. I would have accepted how I look, but they way they look at me and they way they talk to me,  makes it difficult to move on. I don't care that I am ugly but other people do, so they choose to make my life difficult, like with you. The only thing I can say that's positive, is that you're 16 and because of that, there's a chance things can still change. You don't deserve it either way. No one does. For me I'm 24, so I know it's too late. :/ Other thing I can say is that you can still enjoy things in life that you like doing. It's tough but you can. Sorry if that's not so helpful."
ForeverAloneWomen,37fqut,CoquetteClochette,4,Wed May 27 08:49:19 2015 UTC,"I once heard some dadvice that went ""don't let anyone take your picture from when you're 12 to until you're 18."" Puberty is rough on a lot of people. Anyway, your looks don't really cement until you're in your 20s.  It's also possible that you're simply not as unattractive as you think. I had body dysmorphic disorder and thought my face was hideous (the acne didn't help). Honestly, it wasn't that bad, I was probably just average-looking at worst. But seeing pretty girls your age probably makes you feel like a troll."

I've struggled to love myself my whole life and it's overwhelming to think that I could only find someone if I love myself. So I guess I just aim for being okay with myself and hope that gets me somewhere. I find it hard to believe that everyone who's in a relationship truly loves themselves. I'm sure everyone dislikes a part of themselves inside.
ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,amy-gives-advice,3,Fri May 29 23:33:19 2015 UTC,"I wonder if you're running into problems with relative attractiveness. Would you say the friends you go out with are more attractive than you? Do you have one really attractive friend? There's a problem that can manifest if that's the scenario you're in.  I don't like reducing women to numbers, but for the sake of brevity I'll say I have friends who are around a 6 or 7. When they go out alone or go out with other 6s or 7s to clubs and bars they don't have a problem attracting men. However, there's one women in the friend group who is a 9. When a 7 goes out with the 9, the attention from men pretty much vanishes for the 7. It's like there's some giant spotlight on the 9 descending from the heavens. Sometimes they can get men to notice them when the 9 is around, but it's pretty hard. Their solution to this problem wasn't to attempt to get as attractive as the 9. The solution was to not attempt to find guys while out with the 9."
ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,dotsquare_,2,Thu May 28 06:47:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah I do have that one really attractive friend who has no problems attracting guys. She almost never doesn't have a boyfriend/guys falling all over themselves for her. She's tall, blond, thin, extremely outgoing and kind. It's the perfect package. The thing is, I think she really does want me to be happy and find someone but she just doesn't seem to get that it's not as easy for me as it is for her. I told her that I don't find myself beautiful and that I'm kind of not looking for a boyfriend (mostly because I feel hopeless about it and I'm so shy). Although I love her as one of my closest friends, I do get super anxious when we go to a bar/club because I am afraid all the guys will flock to her and I'll be left alone. While that may be part of the problem, I don't always hang out with her so I don't seem to get much attraction elsewhere by myself or with others. Then again I don't initiate conversations with guys often. I know I shouldn't complain because it's my fault. It's hard. I just feel like if I was an 8 or 9 I wouldn't have problems having guys initiate conversations with me or get confidence to talk to them. I'm just stuck here in the average pool of girls I guess."

ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,dotsquare_,1 point,Wed May 27 05:45:46 2015 UTC,"If I'm being honest, I am pretty shy so I don't really make many opportunities for myself, so I should't complain. But at the same time, whenever I go out with friends to bars, restaurants, whatever, I feel like no guys at these events even give me a second glance. I just don't know where to meet guys anymore.   I keep hoping to meet someone through a friend, but that's a long shot. That's how I met my ex. I am finished schooling so no chances there. I do work, but the only guys who I'm interested in at work seem to think I'm invisible. I've tried online dating and it didn't go so well either. Now I've kind of just stopped trying. I feel too desperate now. I tried to talk to a guy I met in an accounting designation class I'm taking recently, and he brushed me off... So needless to say, things aren't going well.

ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,Stenodactylus,1 point,Thu May 28 17:09:36 2015 UTC,"I guess it's partially my fault for the failure with online dating. I didn't take it seriously (mostly so I wouldn't be let down), but the guys I ended up talking to the longest either flaked on me or when I met them, the date went poorly. Maybe down the road when I feel like I've exhausted all opportunities I'll pick it up again and take it seriously. I just don't have the energy for it most days. I know, I know...if I'm not willing to make the effort, how will I find anyone? Also, I'm pretty ambitious when it comes to my future career so finding a guy who is patient and understanding when it comes to my goals is also hard. When I think about the type of person I am and finding a guy who would fit with that, I'm overwhelmed with how I could make it work with someone. I just feel like I have so many weird habits and family issues that would need to be overcome in order for it to work with me. I just feel like those understanding types of people only exist in my imagination. Part of the reason why it works with my friends and me is that they don't know much about my weird habits & family issues. If I had to share it with a bf, it could be problematic. I dunno I didn't mean this to be a sobfest about my life. Just explaining i guess lol"
ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,breakdownnao,1 point,Thu May 28 22:58:59 2015 UTC,"That's pretty normal. It takes time and effort and things don't go great with everyone you meet.   It sounds like you have a pretty good idea of what's getting in your way there. You just need the time, motivation, and energy. Remember that you don't need to share everything at once. We're all a little crazy. Dating is the act of hiding the crazy long enough to bond, and then the crazy doesn't matter so much anymore."

ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,LurkLurkleton,2,Fri May 29 23:29:50 2015 UTC,"I have one question that I couldn't answer for myself by reading through your post history: When you had your boyfriend, were you happy? Was he your boyfriend because you really felt like you loved him and he returned it (while you were in the best times of the relationship, not overall) or was it something where he would say those words and that was all you really got?  I ask because...some parts of what you say I can identify with, others I cannot. I do not have medical depression. I have long-term sad periods for a specific reason. I know this because the one time I had a girlfriend I was so alive. I am trying to save us both a bit of pain because I realize my advise is actually of no/negative use to people with actual medical depression. :/"
ForeverAloneWomen,37eczx,MonotomyFields,3,Wed May 27 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"Hey there. If I'm being honest, yeah I was happy. Happier than I remember being ever. Was it because I really cared about him and he really cared about me? No to both. I don't think either of us really cared about one another deeply--we just liked to have someone to hang around with but I think we broke up because there wasn't really any depth to it--it was just fluff I guess.    It took me a long time to realize it, but I believe I was so happy because I was getting attention I had never gotten before and someone actually thought about me and wanted to spend time with me. It's nice to know someone is eager to see you and is attracted to you. But when that fizzled out because he got bored...it sucked. I went through rough times after (while the relationship was short) because I felt so unwanted.   And to your comments about the depression, I'm not sure what I have wrong with me to be honest. I've never been diagnosed but sometimes I can't see what else could be wrong with me (despite possible anxiety too). Are you similar to me with respect to my feelings about being invisible and relationship-wise? I feel the same about feeling alive when I had a bf. It was the first time in a long time that i could remember feeling excited to live. Which is why I took it really hard after. How are you feeling?"

ForeverAloneWomen,379go0,CalzoneLayer,1 point,Tue May 26 01:37:35 2015 UTC,Is it weird that I'm worried that this cat won't like me? I use to look after some of my friends' animals. Most of them were cats. One took to me very well. Would cuddle with me at every chance and wait for me to come home. Then I had to cat-sit for some of my other friends and they were monsters.

ForeverAloneWomen,379go0,CalzoneLayer,1 point,Tue May 26 11:53:57 2015 UTC,"It's not weird. Most cats will eventually become friends with kind humans, but some only ever bond with their immediate human family members and a few are just jerks. Chances are you'll do well with a random cat, but I'd recommend finding a good shelter in your area and interacting with the cats you're interested in to make sure you get a friendly one. Or, if you're not going the shelter route, get a kitten and raise it with lots of playing. Unless it's one of those rare jerk cats it's pretty much guaranteed to love you then.  If you do that, and make sure you get one that has a good chance of being OK with your living circumstances (e.g. don't get a cat that's used to going outside if you can't let it out much), you should be fine.  Bonus cat tip - get pet insurance.  Ninja cat tip - try the bones and raw food diet instead of standard cat food for excellent cat health (what we tend to feed them is sort of OK but really not great for carnivores whose digestive systems are largely unchanged from those of their wild ancestors)."
ForeverAloneWomen,379go0,CalzoneLayer,1 point,Tue May 26 22:48:25 2015 UTC,"I definitely want a cat. I'm not sure if I could do a kitten, mostly because I want one that already has a fully developed personality. That way I know at least I didn't mess that part up. My best friend's dad is a Veterinarian. So going to her house everyday I got to play with kittens from 3 days to to 6 weeks old. They're were super cute of course, but also very hyper and inquisitive. I kinda want one that would just sit on my lap while I watch netflix honestly.   Is pet insurance worth it? Do you just get the catastrophic kind, or do you have a plan that covers routine stuff like vaccines and check-ups?  I was just going to save up a separate emergency fund."
ForeverAloneWomen,379go0,onelonelytossaway,1 point,Wed May 27 02:17:03 2015 UTC,"I think it's worth it, though not everyone on the internet agrees, I've observed. You should probably look at your financial circumstances, get some pet insurance quotes and then decide. I have basic coverage for ours - this covers illnesses/accidents but not routine check-ups, vaccinations or micro-chipping. I think it's about £14/month total for 2 cats. This is £168/year, so if I put that into an emergency fund, it would take me many, many years to save up the £5,000 or whatever that it might cost if one of them needed surgery, ongoing expensive meds, etc. And if I suddenly became poorish but could still afford the insurance, it would be good to know that the animals would be treated if they got ill.   Don't know what country you're in, but in the UK you can get online cashback/rebates when you sign up to an insurance deal inc. pet insurance, so that could at least take a bit of the sting out of the first year."

My last dog loved me, and vice versa, more than anyone I've ever known. I had a special cat years ago too. He was literally born into my hands. Dogs are more work but easier to bond with. Cats are less demanding in many ways, but in my experience the best bet if you want an affectionate cat is to get one as a kitten and overdose it with affection and play. This is just my experience. I almost always have had rescue animals. The special dog was two and had been very abused, took a year to rehab, but ended up being the best dog ever."

ForeverAloneWomen,3771p6,thekittydog,2,Mon May 25 17:50:05 2015 UTC,"I'd really like someone is somewhat like me in terms of personality, even though that sounds kind of conceited. lol I just need someone who is more introverted and who knows the pain of rejection and fear, otherwise we wouldn't have a lot in common. I'm usually more into geeky guys who are passionate about random things, who have a sense of humor and are smart. I like guys who are compassionate and caring.

ForeverAloneWomen,3771p6,eclba,2,Wed May 27 05:06:58 2015 UTC,"Goodness. There is this one guy—I've mentioned him before—he's exactly the guy I fantasize being with, but I am afraid I'll never run into someone like him again. I really mean that, too. You say that to most people and they just think, ""Oh, you're just putting him up on a pedestal"" or ""You really just need to let him go and find someone else"" (never mind that at my age everyone's already married, so there's really no one else to find) or ""Are you crazy? There are how many people in the world? You could find someone else like that.""  But I can honestly tell you I have not met someone like him before and haven't met someone like him in the years since. People talk about how one true love doesn't exist and I actually agree. However, I do think that for some people there are a small few people with whom they're compatible so it might as well be ""one true love"", you know? Because what are the chances you're going to meet someone like that again when there are so few of them?  To actually answer OP's question: a guy that shares my worldview (trust me, this day and age, they are dwindling at a fast rate), that shares a lot of my interests and can, more than anything else, be my best friend. I know this seems to contradict what I said above. I should explain that the guy I met was all of that and happened to fit all my ""would be nice, but isn't necessary"" traits. Not only that, but he also fit some of my ""haha, not in a million years, but I can dream"" traits. Not only that, but he had numerous bonus traits that I never really thought about before, but that made him even more amazing than I could have ever imagined. (Meh, maybe I am putting him up on a pedestal. Or maybe he really is that awesome. I will never know now.)   In short, he was perfect. For me. And I'm certain I'll never meet his like.  Oh well. :/"

They demean people that hold the views I have and make snide remarks about anyone that sides with or defends them. If not to their face, behind their backs. When people meet me for the first time, they just assume I think the same way they do and they don't bother to hold back from mockery or mean-spirited criticism and I, as a result, never reveal that they are making fun of people I happen to agree with because I don't want to be thought of as ridiculous or stupid. (And also because I'd be alone in defending myself and I'm not really the best at doing that as I'm not a very articulate speaker, especially when put on the spot.)  Long story short, there aren't a lot of guys around here that are very respectful of the political and philosophical views that I hold."

Someone who can make me laugh, who likes to party, and doesn't mind taking cabs to drink or driving my drunk ass around.  He probably needs to be a runner so he can go run with me or have some other kind of thing they work on/train at on Saturday mornings while I'm running even if it's a video game or whatever.  If he doesn't like going out to restaurants then we will probably not get along because I like going out to eat much better than cooking.  It would be awesome if he spoke some Spanish because I spent a lot of time studying it and I really want to go to Cancun, Spain, Puerto Rico, Costa Rica, and Argentina one day, and of course travel works better when you have more people who speak the language and have an interest in the people (not that you really need that for Cancun haha).  If he doesn't like Mexican and Italian flavors he's going to hate my cooking and we're going to spend a shitload of time working out what to eat.  It's probably also best if he understands my love for cupcakes.  He likely needs to be okay with remaining in the southern US, and I have a weird bias against states that are landlocked (ie ideal states of residence would be NC, SC, or FL. Maybe southern CA but that's really far from my parents).  If my friends and/or parents don't like him after 6 months his ass is hopefully getting kicked to the curb.  Preferably Christian or Jewish and active in their church/synagogue.  Probably can't be anyone super picky about spending habits because I like nice clothes and need a lot of expensive running gear.  I also like to enter running races which can get expensive.  If he doesn't like the beach or if he is a ""mountains person"" I will probably be left with no choice but to dump him because I don't like the mountains (I need more to do than hike) and feel strongly that ""vacation"" means beach.  If he's willing to teach me to ski or if I can take lessons we can re-evaluate for a long weekend or week of the winter."

Every partner is a new learning experience, don't worry about it.  Dated a 26 year old girl that was 'inexperienced'.  That naivete didn't last long in the face of communication and desire.   If you're feeling depressed, and people are invalidating your feelings, I recommend not talking to them, but finding someone who will listen, and will respond appropriately.  Guidance counselers can help, if you're in school.  You're not alone, people feel alone and depressed all the time.  I'm 25, and I'll still send my close friend a message if I'm feeling low and I want her to tell me something nice.  She'll never tell me my feelings aren't important, and I'll do the same.   I'll send a hug too.  Life's tough.  You probably have a lot of fun years ahead though, so chin up."

Ideas like that are so foreign to me. After a few years of working in offices I would at times develop some sorta-friendships or close acquaintanceships and I remember being surprised at first to find out that everyone in the office was texting and FB chatting, etc, all the time. I'd previously thought I was doing OK-ish there socially. Some of my sorta-friends would initially assume I was in on this kind of contact and would also seem genuinely surprised to find out otherwise.

(2) Write him a letter about how you feel and what you have, give it in person, and tell him to reply regardless.  (3) Most logical - find someone else to crush over and be with, the only remedy for heartbreak, is someone to fill that void."
ForeverAloneWomen,36cgfs,dizzytulip,18,Mon May 18 07:22:01 2015 UTC,"I have a boyfriend now, but was single for YEARS in the past, and I can tell you that losing weight did wonders for my dating/social life. I lost about 50 lbs and the way I was treated by people afterwards was like night and day. I didn't love myself the way I was when I was overweight because I knew I was lazy and ate crap food all day, every day. Also I knew I didn't want to date a man with similar habits to mine so I had to change.   I guess I mean this post for encouragement. For some women, learning to love their bodies is the key but for me it was not. I am a lot happier at a healthy weight, I'm actually about 15 lbs overweight still but I don't stress about it. Being able to dress well, look nice, run to catch a bus without huffing and puffing, etc., and knowing that you worked hard to accomplish your goals, will make you carry yourself with pride. It's worth it."

Even though I won't be at goal by my birthday so I can have a date, I guess I'll get there at some point. Congrats for getting out of FA-dom lol :)  I don't really care about 'dating a man with similar habits to mine' or any of that stuff. I literally don't care at all what a guy looks like or if he has bad habits. I guess as long as he is kind of nice, that would do. I have friends and stuff and am generally liked, I just don't register as dateable to guys period. I'm working hard to get attractive, but I guess it would be nice that someone at some point didn't think I was repulsive."
ForeverAloneWomen,36cgfs,FivebyFive,6,Mon May 18 18:53:20 2015 UTC,"Losing weight here too. I started in October and lost 55lbs/25kg so far, but I started at a very heavy weight and now it is going to slow down a bit. Honestly I never thought I could be happy looking like that, I feel like a stranger in my own skin. I know I can be attractive to men online/on paper, but I would never attract one and let one in my life looking like I did. Maybe some rare men like very heavy girls but I hated myself and no way I would let anyone get close to me like that. I of course lose weight to get healthier, as I had a couple of medical issues that were worsened by the weight gain, but I also want to try being a young woman for once. I never had a normal childhood or teenagehood, I was already too old somehow - not a cute, easy going, datable chick - and I feel like I missed out on everything. I want to know what it's like to be able to be intimate with someone and feel like I could be attractive."

HUGE change, but had to stop because, obviously it's quite unhealthy.  Went back to 1200, fell off the wagon and pretty much started binge eating because I'm not at all on the track that I wanted to be at 21, got back on again recently, slow going once more.

I don't have an energy issue really, even with really low calories. I have trouble sleeping, so I haven't noticed a change because of that. I wish you luck!

ForeverAloneWomen,36bt9c,viversemrumo,5,Mon May 18 03:13:29 2015 UTC,"Resentful..? Of my own children? No, and I'd be surprised if you met anyone else who would say they would feel that way.   I don't think you'd feel resentful if you had kids either. The parental bond with a child...is in its own category of relationship. Resentment can occur sometimes, but that's usually indicative of other severe problems in the relationship."
ForeverAloneWomen,36bt9c,GreenSkyFish,4,Mon May 18 05:30:38 2015 UTC,I don't think I would resent anything of my kids should I have any. Comes with being a parent I guess.

Only sad thing is that I would not be able to give advice about boys due to lack of much experience with them. I doubt I will suddenly start having many boyfriends anytime soon, so maybe if I find the guy he would be the only one ever. :/  I get what you mean though. Maybe a feeling you missed out in something, or that its not fair. Sometimes I think I would be resentful because I am already resentful towards people who have it easy, but if its your own child,  when I think more about it, having a child it would be hard to feel anything but love for him/her."

I get super wary if I'm getting attention from a beautiful woman, and sure enough, oh she wants me to buy her a drink, how about that.  I get drinks bought for ME by older ladies, thank you very much.    I think it's a big part of just two people making a trade.  A guy will fawn, the girl will give him attention, as long as both parties understand the limits, it's fine.

It was tough to deal with but that's not what ended our friendship anyway. I agree with the other comments. Men complain that women are shallow yet their behavior is just as bad towards women.

I dont really know the reason but now I understand the pains of being unattractive in a world where attractive people are treated like royalty and have everything they want handed to them on a plate.  So unfair."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,queenofglum,1 point,Sun May 17 10:27:36 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I think the best advantage is to just be average looking. Just hear me out, before downvoting me!   Yes, attractive women get more attention, but often it's not the kind of attention they want. Men fawning over women may seem like the best thing in the world, but when it happens all the time, it's hard not to lose your identity in all of it. Most of the time attractive women are treated like a sack of meat strictly there for men's pleasure and amusement. Having that kind of attention can be hard on an individual as a person, the same way it can be hard on a person who never gets noticed.  Men still don't listen to pretty women. Their opinion still doesn't matter because to men they STILL aren't considered a human being. Just  walking set of legs and boobs.  Plus that kind of attention gives those guys the mindset that the pretty girl owes them something now. He was nice to her and now he's entitled to her time, a date, whatever.  Now most of the time this isn't the majority of interactions, but it does happen quite a bit. I actually prefer men not to interact with me unless they are going to treat me like a human being."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,Foliagus,7,Wed May 20 11:02:16 2015 UTC,"Ok, but imagine being treated much better than your less attractive counterparts. Much much better. Most girls at my school don't even care, they enjoy the attention their getting. I never seen them have a problem with not being listened to. I noticed that male teachers listened to them more than they listen to me"
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,rqnadi,6,Sun May 17 16:34:03 2015 UTC,"Just remember that most beautiful people have insecurities too, and often about stuff we don't have to worry about.  They don't know if someone is being nice because they're nice, or because they want sex.  They don't get taken seriously as an intellectual, and often will feel unchallenged and unfulfilled.   Being unnattractive is hard, yes, and many things in this world are.  It can be ok.  It's something to challenge yourself about.  If you're not getting somewhere with looks, maybe time to take up a hobby, or advertise another part of yourself, one you're proud of."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,ihatebeingfa,7,Sun May 17 18:41:30 2015 UTC,"but I have nothing. If I was beautiful I could depend on that, but I have nothing"
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,rqnadi,2,Sun May 17 18:53:36 2015 UTC,"I agree with Foliagus, so what if you're not beautiful? Even if you were, what happens when your looks fade? You'd be in the same position. But that is why you cultivate other skills."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,ihatebeingfa,1 point,Sun May 17 20:40:34 2015 UTC,"You could use it as a crutch*.  I'm sure you have something.  Nothing you're good at, or you feel good that you know?  I took piano when I was little, so music is a big part of who I am, and often I can find people that will relate to that.  Or just being kind and a good listener, you wouldn't believe how many people I adore because they embody these traits."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,Recessinthering,2,Sun May 17 21:27:05 2015 UTC,"That's because their entire life is dependent on the attention they get from their looks. The reason they ""like"" the attention is because that is all they know. They don't know an alternative. Plus after a while they find that there isn't any substance to that kind of life and they either grow up and have a mature outlook on it, or they get consumed by it and end up in a very bad place.    A mature woman doesn't want to be strictly noticed just for her looks. Being noticed just for looks makes someone feel like they are an object. It means the person treating you ""nicer"" for your looks is just a vapid douchebag and it shouldn't fucking matter what they think anyways.    I guess what I'm saying is that the grass is always greener on the other side. Everyone can say a certain group has it better, but honestly we are all struggling in some way. There is no perfect end all answer for everything. Being pretty or attractive doesn't solve all your problems and pretty people have problems too."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,KatzVlad,9,Sun May 17 21:48:09 2015 UTC,"It's not always a ""grass is always greener"" situation. Some things are objectively better than others and it's ok to acknowledge that. Being attractive is objectively better than being unattractive, you can't dispute that. No one is saying you don't have any problems if you are attractive just that looks aren't one of them. People are shallow, looks matter."
ForeverAloneWomen,367jnd,KatzVlad,3,Sun May 17 19:03:55 2015 UTC,"I could say that rich people have it way better than me because they have more money, but the truth is that they have their own kind of issues and having money might not really be better than a simpler middle class life. Me complaining that rich people have it so much better and are treated so much better won't really make my situation better. Me showing others that I am bitter about it won't help anything either.   Same goes for looks.   Not to mention I can say that being average ( not necessarily unattractive) is way better than being attractive. I had great looks growing up, but my social akwardness kind of overshadowed my looks. I still couldn't make friends, and boy still didn't notice or like me. I was still weird. When I got out of high school it got a lot better, because I worked on my social problems. Then I got all kinds of attention from the wrong kinds of people, and guess what... I was still alone. The people that said they were my friends were just fake. And the guys who claimed to like me all wanted one thing from me, and it certainly wasn't a functional relationship. The older I got the more ""Average looking"" I became and I like that a lot better than being pretty. I have also done a lot of work on my negative personality and I am a lot better socially. I will take average over pretty any of the week.   This is just my experience, but I realized being negative and bitter about the things in my life wasn't helping my life get any better. I had to work on me, and then maybe I had a shot at actually not being alone."

Things like the well being of you and your family, your friends, whether you can provide for people who depend on you, whether you're achieving your goals are more important things to worry about in life.   In terms of what will help you solve your problems, I'd worry more about money than being pretty. You get bought a couple of drinks from time to time if you're pretty, big whoop. The number of women who can get by entirely on looks alone is comically small, even if you're beautiful all it's gonna get you is the odd cup of coffee and strangers coming up to talk to you.  I would also think whether you're a good person, how kind you are, how hardworking, how interesting you are etc etc are far far more valuable traits than being pretty in terms of day to day life."

The main thing that helped? More exposure/experience. I had grown up mainly around males, so that was part of the reason I was so nervous/awkward around women. Making more female friends or just being around them more led me to being more comfortable when interacting with them. So practice...as much as you can!"

I don't want to be overly optimistic but if they have been searching for months and have not found evidence of cancer it might be something else entirely. If it was cancer, I am certain they would have found a tumour or a blood malignancy quite quickly by doing the appropriate tests. There are a multitude of other explanations for symptoms and now they would be considering the ""diagnoses of exclusion"", as in the conditions you only diagnose once  you have ruled everything else out.  As for dying alone, I probably would feel okay actually, because it would take away the anxiety and fear of having to be alone forever, if that makes sense. Like, suddenly nothing matters and I don't need to hate myself for not being able to find a relationship, because I'll not be around anyway. Although it would be nice to experience true, happy love, admittedly."

But actually I would rather die alone, than to be in a happy relationship and knowing that you will leave your SO behind. To know you will inflict so much pain in their life when you die and to know that you could have lived a happy life with this person, is probably more painful than regretting that you missed out on something."
ForeverAloneWomen,36150v,raletta,2,Fri May 15 08:02:35 2015 UTC,"This same thing recently happened to me. I knew something had to be wrong, but had to keep going to so many doctor's visits to figure it out. During this time, I put on soooo much more weight (which doesn't help my FA status) because I was so stressed. Finally, after getting the doctor's to take me seriously, they did find a tumor. He said it wasn't cancerous, so they won't operate unless it starts to cause problems. Honestly though, the one thing that kept replaying in my mind was 'I'm going to die at 20/21 without ever being on so much as a date.' Now I'm working harder than ever to not be FA anymore. Anyway, all of that to say OP, I totally understand how you feel. And I really hope you can find out what is wrong soon. Not knowing is the most horrible feeling ever."

My sister was like 25 and got her first boyfriend. She was maybe 5'1 and 160. She was a bigger gal. Dated a bit but never had a BF; and also never had sex (Which are details I wish I didnt know about my sister).   The guy broke up with her after 6 months after which my mistser went on a monstrous process of diet and excercise. She  bought a membership to that thing where they prmake your meals and you eat whetever they tell you to. My sister started training for a marathon (Full) with me when she said before she had never run farther then a mile.   whenever she would plateu in her weightloss she would do this weird tea  fast thing and loose like 6 lbs. Then she would go off of the fast and work out really hard to try to keep 4 lbs of the 6 lb weight loss. She repeated this cycle over and over again.   It got to the point I couldnt recognize my sister from the back and I would get weirded out when she could sneak up on me.   So she ends up meeting her old BF after a couple years. Yadda Yadda Yadda today they are married and have a 6 year old daughter.   My cousin said he doesnt know why she got back with him because  she could have done much better at the time.   I will say before her weigthloss she was always a temperamental and moody person. During the fasts she was very low energy but generally her mood and personality seemed much more stable.   Today my sister isnt as thin or as buff as she was, but she never gained all the weight back and she still diets and exercises although not that intensely.  So take this story for what its worth. Good Luck."

I always wanted to be an ultra feminine housewife who took care of her husband. I now realize this is a fantasy and will never happen.

Because you need to tell them where to stick it.  Part of being a modern woman is the ability to choose your life. If you choose to be a housewife, great. If you choose to have a career, great too.  The housewife role should only be considered demeaning if it's forced upon you (which it clearly isn't), or if you choose to be a subordinate in that role (your family politics are not really anyone else's business, but it could lead to problems down the road for you)."

Straight men tend to be attracted to the most feminine and straight women to the most masculine.  Not everyone is but generally it tends to be that way.  Of course you have to pretend, thats the nature of attraction.  You have to be interesting and draw the other sex to you.  The same way a male bird from a young age begins developing his bird song.

High heels and revealing clothing definitely gets our attention but not a prerequisite.   Surprising the girly bubbly stereotype of a women actually does something to me.

ForeverAloneWomen,35pzs0,LilacMoon9,4,Tue May 12 18:16:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, absolutely. It can be tiring when I force myself to act more feminine than I really am. I have always felt like it would have been better if I had been born a man. It is not so such an extent that I desire a sex change, just that I think I would have had more freedom to be myself. When I am at my healthiest, I accept this for what it is and refuse to compromise on it. I have to weigh the unhappiness of being alone against the unhappiness of being ""liked"" for being someone I'm not. It's upsetting to think that I will always be alone, but it's a slow sort of sadness that creeps in. Submitting to a man and adopting feminine traits that truly repulse me garners a more immediate feeling of disgust, so for now - ""masculine"" it is for me.   As I am bisexual, I feel I may have more luck being myself in a lesbian relationship, but I am from a conservative family (and area), so I have not had the opportunity to try. FWIW, I act more ""feminine"" when I am drunk. If being stupid and easy equals attractive (at least in my case), I would rather be unattractive."

Some of my guy friends when I was in high school liked girly girls, while others preferred tomboys or sporty girls that didn't wear any make up. What about those that are in-between? It might be too much to hope that a guy will like me for me. Maybe I should play up the girly side of things, I don't mind it but it's not exactly me."

I just looked different. It looked like someone had punched me in the eyes.  And yes, a professional makeup artist put it on, and my sister thought it looked fine.  So weird."
ForeverAloneWomen,35pzs0,dharmabird67,2,Tue May 12 18:01:19 2015 UTC,"I meant more in the sense that if makeup is your standard, people will say your washed face looks tired and sickly. You completely lose the wow factor that makeup can have. But I know what you mean, a full face of makeup is definitely something super weird if you're not used to seeing yourself like that."
ForeverAloneWomen,35pzs0,cyber_rigger,2,Tue May 12 18:05:29 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I had a co-worker who wore makeup every day.  I didn't really notice it.  Then one day she came in without makeup, and I was like, whoa.  I think people should be used to seeing your clean face, and then go wow when you're in makeup, not be used to seeing your makeup face, and then go whoa when you're not wearing any."
ForeverAloneWomen,35pzs0,starship7201u,2,Tue May 12 23:34:55 2015 UTC,"I'll go on the record to say, I HATE wearing makeup and I'd rather cut my achilles tendons than wear heels. I'm comfort before cute any day of the week.  I do not conform to ""feminine"" gender`stereotypes roles.   Do I wear makeup? Yes, my professional demeanor reflects on the man I work for. Do I feel comfortable wearing it? Not really. It feels like a false face. I also don't want to be one of those women that people denigrate whenever she's seen in public sans makeup."
ForeverAloneWomen,35pzs0,trail22,1 point,Wed May 13 15:09:47 2015 UTC,"As a guy, I never really found heels to be extra attractive or anything.. I always liked flip flops better.  I guess it is true that I am attracted to more feminine stuff though, like painted nails, bracelets, jewelry, hair accessories, etc do tend to draw my attention faster.  As for on the other side of the fence..  I don't think we guys have this problem to that degree.  I mean, there are effeminate guys out there, sure, but for the most part I think a guy is just a guy."

ForeverAloneWomen,35k4s9,uh-okay-I-guess,3,Mon May 11 03:27:32 2015 UTC,lol thx ;)   I felt really lonely when it was over.   I was wondering about this. I know I shouldn't go with expectations but it can be hard not to and that feeling is the worst.
ForeverAloneWomen,35k4s9,Rook_1,2,Mon May 11 03:39:45 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Well I haven't been social in a while but I remember having great nights out and feeling really depressed/lonely when I came home. May be related to being an introvert idk.
ForeverAloneWomen,35k4s9,uh-okay-I-guess,6,Mon May 11 03:56:06 2015 UTC,"They're not meetups qua meetups, but I have gone to various events with the thought of perhaps meeting someone I might vaguely have some interest in getting to know better (spoiler alert: nope). These include:   Classical music events, where I was treated as an exotic specimen because I was ~30 years younger than everyone else. Being treated that way is not pleasant and eliminates any hope of forming something like a friendship. (I'm not talking about concerts -- the things I have done are more along the lines of ""get 40 people together to sight-read Bach cantatas"".) MTG tournaments. Despite the stereotypes, people there are mostly not stinky... but some people are unpleasantly competitive, and others are socially inept. Now, I'm not trying to bash people who are socially inept, because I am one, but two socially inept people are only going to ""click"" if they happen to be operating on the same frequency. MTG seems mainly to attract people who are obsessed with anime and video games and I don't swing that way. Also, if you are part of the intended audience of this sub, you'll get the full ""exotic specimen"" treatment. IMO, these things are a good place to play Magic, but not a good place to meet people, even though you literally get paired up with a new person every 50 minutes, which seems like a perfect setup. Maybe if you like anime and video games, though.... Various professional events. I thought I would be more interested in people who are in my profession, but actually, while I like talking with others about what I do for a living, that doesn't translate to finding the other people interesting as people. The one or two people I did find really interesting also happen to be very famous, so I guess I'm not alone in that assessment."

ForeverAloneWomen,35k4s9,GreenSkyFish,1 point,Mon May 11 05:13:12 2015 UTC,"It varies, but usually mid-20s is average. Unless the event is at a college or something, you shouldn't be the oldest."

I don't do most of the anime thing, but you definitely see it in some of the people.  Definitely have met some cool late-20's folks though, through the cafe in my hometown.   That's too funny, I head to chamber choirs to meet sopranos sometimes haha.  Classical music attracts some nice clean folks."
ForeverAloneWomen,35k4s9,the_superfantastic,3,Tue May 12 12:49:07 2015 UTC,"Gosh no. I experience enough anxiety as is even going to something like a concert!  I have heard of people who've gone to meet-ups and had good experiences. It's 50% luck, and 50% effort. Sometimes the other people just suck and aren't too friendly/sociable. But the rest of the time, you kinda get what you put in. If you go to one of these and don't talk to anyone, then you shouldn't be too surprised if no one else talks to you."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,lnys,9,Sat May 9 09:27:38 2015 UTC,"That mantra is fucking bullshit. I didn't even really touch my SO until a couple of dates in. Kissing...came even later than that.  Also just a general note...take any dating advice on Reddit with a grain of salt. Or any advice for that matter. Always remember that Reddit is comprised mostly of a very specific population of people (17-25 Caucasian males). Often times a lot of the advice you see doesn't take into account culture, personality, and most importantly individual differences. Don't let the group-think give you the impression that most people in the real world think a certain way.   You don't have to kiss/touch a guy you meet within a certain amount of anything. You should never have to do anything that you are uncomfortable with doing. I'm pretty sure that's like a fucking amendment or something, but then again I didn't pay a lot of attention in US Govt...  I am similar to you in that I am not a very physically affectionate person in general. It's something I struggle with. But with my SO, I was able to slowly push through my boundaries (at a very slow pace). There is a difference between being AFRAID of physical intimacy and simply DISLIKING physical intimacy. People are different, not everyone enjoys touching and such to the same degree. If your issue is more that you're afraid or not used to physical intimacy, then that is something you could certainly explore with a partner one day."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,GreenSkyFish,5,Sat May 9 16:29:38 2015 UTC,"To me they act and believe like characters on TV rather than real humans.   Glad I'm not the only one who thinks that ;-) sometimes they sound like they try to emulate a How I met your mother / Friends episode or something, with neat little labels for everyone and a super codified view of how you should act and speak in any situation..."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,Foliagus,4,Sun May 10 15:21:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not a big fan of physical contact. Before when I used to hug friends I was told my hugs were ""awkward"", so I thought fuck it, never doing that again. Now whenever I hug people who aren't family members I feel like a fool, and will opt for a wave goodbye instead. I guess the fact the most of my friends are shorter than me doesn't help."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,JDNow,2,Sun May 10 15:45:50 2015 UTC,"The wave is a good thing though. I only hug people who are really close to me, but I'm from a culture where you kiss on the cheeks (when you're a girl) people you never met (in friendly settings), and that's really something I don't like."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,KatzVlad,-1,Sat May 9 10:12:23 2015 UTC,"I'm a tall guy, I love hugging short people.  I crush them in my bosom.  Or I pick them up under the arms and life as I straighten."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,JDNow,3,Sun May 10 15:47:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I have the same thing.  I feel like a major part of my problem is that I'm afraid any signal I give off will be some sort of invitation, so if I like someone, I avoid eye contact, etc, just in case.  Probably false fear, but whatever."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,KatzVlad,5,Sun May 10 01:47:16 2015 UTC,it's okay.   my partner and I have been together for 10 months and we still shake hands to greet eachother.   we don't like touch.   I'm a rape survivor.   he just doesn't dig it.   and we are okay.
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,viversemrumo,1 point,Sat May 9 17:25:52 2015 UTC,"How did you guys meet, and how did you communicate that you guys weren't into too much touching?  I would like to figure that out myself."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,TypicalOfaCynic,2,Sun May 10 01:03:57 2015 UTC,"we met in college and I shook his hand instead of hugging him after we hung out enough to the point where people usually hug. do you know what I mean? like when you see someone enough they extend arms for physical contact. we just never did.   I eventually said ""hey I don't like this BC I am a rape survivor"" and he said ""wow I hate that too although I was not raped"" and it is good and we hate it for different reasons but we have a place of understanding.   we managed to have sex immediately when we started dating but like we didn't pet each other or do any couple-y caresses. (play with hair rub shoulder or back) sometimes he'd sit next to me and put his feet or his head in my lap but it was only until very recently we got into touching. we would hug sometimes but it was a formality and pretty awkward for us. we both agreed it was weird so we stuck to handshakes which has people teasing us in public about it but it works y'know.   we didn't really and then one night he just woke me up and said ""will you touch me?"" and I kind of rubbed his shoulders and he didn't cringe and it was good and it felt so mucc more intimate than sex for us."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,queenofglum,2,Sat May 16 07:04:00 2015 UTC,"Yea, I'm exactly the same way. I could never be that affectionate with someone I just met no matter how attractive or nice they are. I think it might be due to never experiencing physical affection."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,geekest_cat,2,Sat May 16 11:19:24 2015 UTC,Most of the people FA types end up dating don't have typical expectations. Someone with the compassion and understanding that it takes to date a girl with anxiety/trust issues would probably be ok with waiting on physical contact.
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,geekest_cat,2,Sat May 9 22:30:26 2015 UTC,"I got teased a lot at my old workplace for not wanting to be touched. They just laugh at me when I push them away and say ""you're my coworker, why do I have to hug you?""  I guess I'm different in that people are very tactile communicators, and I'm not. But to me it seems weirder that you would touch someone that you barely know.  But yes, lnys. I completely agree with how insane it is."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,geekest_cat,1 point,Sat May 9 23:06:28 2015 UTC,"I'm from a Southern European culture and we use the touch normally in many social interactions so I have no problem with that, but when I was younger and was more introverted I also tended to despise and avoid the touching. So I guess it's entirely normal, specially if you don't ""practice"" it often, but you can get used to it, and I guess it depends a lot on your personal mood and disposition towards the people in general."
ForeverAloneWomen,35dpvq,Devil_Nights,2,Sun May 10 02:49:48 2015 UTC,"I live in Southern Europe yeah, and people are very touchy here I think. It was a bit of a culture shock actually, people always putting their hands on your shoulders/back in social situations..."

I found these use to be great places for introverted people to gain security and feel useful, since the entry requirements are quite easy (i.e., just free time), there are people from all ages, and the judging awareness we have is much lower than on any social interactions involving people of our age, for example."

ForeverAloneWomen,354vis,Traumanatrix,5,Thu May 7 03:06:19 2015 UTC,"A lot of times people get into relationships because 1. They are looking for a relationship, and 2. Because you guys seem to have some stuff in common and click.  But, those relationships are often really weak, because there's no special connection. Those relationships only last until someone gets bored, annoyed, or finds someone/something else.   I think those are the relationships you've mostly had. Finding something more special, that'll last, is really just dumb luck. At least that's the experience I've had. You're pretty young still; to just keep trying is all you can really do."
ForeverAloneWomen,354vis,zewifi,3,Thu May 7 17:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not the OP, but I'm curious...why else should people start dating than those two reasons? I guess I'm just confused about defining that ""special connection"" (probably because I've never had it). For me it's pretty rare to find someone that I have things in common with and click with, so maybe it's just easy to confuse that with feeling ""something special""? Dating is hard, ugh."
ForeverAloneWomen,354vis,-lost-at-sea-,5,Fri May 8 01:03:44 2015 UTC,"I guess I'm just confused about defining that ""special connection""   It's really, really hard for me to define as well. The easiest times I've noticed it were when it was with people who were basically the polar opposite of myself.   When you're (I'm) looking for someone to date, things tend to start looking like a balance sheet of acceptability. If they meet enough standards, they're datable. But, sometimes, you meet someone who is just golden. You like them for who they are, and would still like them if they were out of shape, unemployed, or whatever.  This is just what I think, based off my experiences. I also think there's a third type of relationship, which is where you date someone that you 'think' has all the qualities you want in a partner (in a sense that you idolize them). Those relationships are often one-sided, and abusive."
ForeverAloneWomen,354vis,zewifi,3,Fri May 8 04:10:56 2015 UTC,"That makes sense, in that can't-be-defined sort of way. I have always had the feeling that you just ""know"" when you meet someone who is right for you. The hard part is getting that feeling and the other person returning it, which I think goes to your point on one-sided relationships. Maybe some day I'll find the special connection. I try to stay optimistic that I'll be that lucky."

School can be put on the back burner, but try to keep a routine. Get up and get dressed even if you don't want to.

Help that could set you up for the rest of your life. When I was too depressed to be able to go to class, that's when I sought out therapy for the first time because I thought ""man, I need to do something or else this is going to ruin my life."" Totally kudos to you for seeking out help.   An additional resource for you to consider is to check if your college offers free counseling to students. If they don't provide therapeutic services, they should at least be able to refer you to a therapist. Please consider it, and don't be hesitant to ask me or any of us any questions.   Depression is a place where a lot of us has been. You are certainly not alone in that regard, let your friends and family help you."
ForeverAloneWomen,34zumc,petushkoff,8,Tue May 5 22:52:47 2015 UTC,I feel more comfortable around girls because that's who I interact with the most. Guys have mostly treated me like shit in the past so I act very awkward around them; I'm practically like a mute. So I just avoid them. Biggest catch 22 ever.
ForeverAloneWomen,34zumc,darqhunter,6,Wed May 6 09:17:44 2015 UTC,I am not interested in stereotypically girly things so it's hard for me to connect with many women. I've made friends with the other ladies at work but they are just as geeky/nerdy as me and understand.
ForeverAloneWomen,34zumc,I_dontlikeu,4,Wed May 6 00:26:14 2015 UTC,At times I do feel it's harder to connect with girls. I am in a nail polish group on facebook and there are times where it feels very cliquey. That's only online I can only image how much worse it is in person. Being fat and ugly makes it hard to connect with people in general.
ForeverAloneWomen,34zumc,queenofglum,7,Tue May 5 23:18:52 2015 UTC,"I feel like I just don't get along with people in general regardless of gender. But, all my closest friends are female though. Growing up I was jealous of most of my friends and definitely felt like I had to compete with them, but that was really due to my own insecurity. Now that I'm in my mid-twenties I'm thankful that I have such a great group of girlfriends.   Perhaps it's because I'm a feminist, but it makes me sad when women hate on each other. It's counterproductive. And I'm sorry OP, that you had to experience that. But we're not all like that. I got really lucky with my lot of friends. We just want to see each other succeed.   Also, ""failing"" at things you're interested in is part of the process. I love yoga, but I'm terrible at it. It took me a long time to get over myself and just let myself try without worrying about how I look which is incredibly inept and awkward most of the time."

I'm pretty comfortable around the opposite sex. Any crowd of guys just looks like my family to me.  I had women friends in middle school and high school for a bit. My interests became more niche as I grew older and I began talking more to men who readily reflected my enthusiasm.  As for lying and fakeness, well... some of the worst manipulators I've ever seen in social groups were actually men. It's all relative, I suppose. Fucked up personalities are fucked up personalities."
ForeverAloneWomen,34zumc,JDNow,2,Wed May 6 05:36:01 2015 UTC,"I think it's because the guys miss the nuances of girl culture, and will generally be like, ""Oh, person who talks, that's fine,"" while girls will be like -- if I spend time with this person, what does that say about me?  However, I think once it gets into dating, both sides are equally worried about how they will look to their friends."
ForeverAloneWomen,34zumc,viversemrumo,2,Wed May 6 01:04:19 2015 UTC,I have a hard time connecting with both. A lot of the women I've met are always trying to compete with each other for guys/attention.They just want to feel like they are hotter than the next girl. Men act like I don't exist so I never get the chance to be friends with them. I feel judged by both.

As if that was all they were into. Sigh.  I usually get along fine with women. Not that I don't get along with men. Either way I often end up feeling that I am not good enough. With women cause they're prettier / more feminine than me, with men cause they see me as another dude."

In high school most of my friends were online because everyone around me thought I was the weird kid because I wasn't into feminine shit you know?

You either have stuff in common or you dont.  There is no hidden message of attraction or wondering if they like you for you, or just because they want to get in your pants.  So while it may take you time to find girls you click with and have stuff in common with, once you do its nice and comfortable and easy right from day 1."

I was kind of like that too. I would actually get really depressed and anxious during extended periods of free time. Summer/Winter break would drive me crazy. I would get so bored! Now that I have little free time, I enjoy whatever time I have very much. I guess that is a symptom of getting older.  Now since you work full time, I don't think my situation was the same as yours. You live a very productive lifestyle in that you work AND you exercise regularly...AND you read books which anyone would consider an enriching activity. Lazy is certainly not a word I would use to describe you.   Don't worry about what you should be doing, but I want you to really ask yourself...what YOU would like to see yourself doing. It's rhetorical and you don't have to tell me, but just think about it...and make sure it's within reason. I.e. traveling around the world may not be the most realistic. But perhaps checking out cafes/restaurants you haven't been to before, or looking into a dance group that you can join (more exercise, and you learn a new dance) etc. Just 2 possibilities out of many."

I would most likely recommend a really lengthy ass novel by some Russian writer.   But to speak to what you just expressed...if you want my honest opinion, I think most people feel that way. Especially if you have a FB and you see what other people are doing in their life (although it's kind of selective info, since people put the most EXCITING/INTERESTING stuff on FB), it can feel like you're wasting away yours.   I am still guilty of doing it though, comparing myself to others and feeling like I'm way behind. Actually, at some point I really did fall behind. But the problem is since then it's felt like I've constantly been trying to keep up with other people. And there's this rush, some destination or goal that I have to reach and can't rest until I do, yet I don't even know what that is.   However, you should define success ONLY in terms of reaching the goals that you yourself want to reach. Not things that other people have done. 26 is nothing, you're just getting into the stride of your life. But you need to evaluate...what you want, what's important to you, what you want to spend the next couple of years working towards. I need to do that too."

The never being kissed or not having been in a relationship might be a liiittle out of the norm, but not for virginity. That isn't to say that there aren't some people who would judge you for that, but in my experience virginity doesn't really become a concern/oddity until like after 30. But even then, people are generally more mature about it. You wouldn't want to date or be around someone who cared for something as arbitrary as virginity.   I really think you are just placing too much emphasis/focus on the concept of virginity. The issue isn't other people, it's you; why do you care so much about being a virgin? Why do you think it's such an important/vital aspect of who you are?  It's not even something that comes up in the early stages of dating! You don't have to mention it until you start to get physically intimate with someone. There's no shame in it at all, you can have sex when you're READY. Anyone who says otherwise, you don't want to be with."
ForeverAloneWomen,34ov9o,GreenSkyFish,6,Sun May 3 05:14:14 2015 UTC,"That's a good point. The only thing I can think is that it makes me feel really unlikable and reminds me of my problems of maintaining relationships in general. My ""friendships"" are sometimes rocky in the dullest of ways in that there is little fighting, but a lot of apparent apathy on their part. I do most of the contacting and comforting. Aside from when my friends need support in a crisis, it seems like being around me for any decent period of time is a chore for them. Thinking about the fact that no one finds me attractive enough to ask me out makes me feel even more miserable and inadequate. I am not a physically unattractive young woman, so it feels like my personality must be the issue. This almost makes me feel worse, really. Besides my family, it seems like people only value me for what tangible things I can provide them. My co-workers like me because (and only when) I am competent. My friends are only really friends when they want my advice. If I were in a relationship, this compensation would be sex and maybe a kid and financial support long term, and that idea repulses me. So, virginity I guess is tied into my insecurities as an unlikable person in general. That's all I can tell from it."

The whole context of ""skill"" also makes sex seem like it some kind of economic exchange, in which case I might as well just charge money for access to my orifices. Actually, men who are simply DTF wouldn't be a very good option for me at all. I honestly would rather live as a completely asexual nun for the rest of my life than participate in casual sex. I don't think it's immoral; I just wouldn't find it very pleasurable at all, which defeats the purpose of engaging in it in the first place. Btw, I'm not trying to call you out.

Please don't be ashamed of your status or feel like it should in any way affect your qualifications to be on a dating site. I was 23 my first time. I would have preferred to date other virgins at the time. I don't think it should be on your profile, because that would just attract the guys who want the thrill of being your first. If you're not into casual sex don't compromise that. You only get one first time. Just go on dates and when you feel you're in that place and you've gotten to know each other, then you can tell him. Or not, you know. He doesn't have to know. If you're not sure what to do you can try watching some tame porn videos (ignore anything to do with strap ons). Some guys have a third-date rule where if you're not having sex by the third date then she's not sufficiently into you.

Every now and then I think I've found someone as passionate as I am but honestly, they can only parrot popular opinion and having a real deep discussion is impossible. But reddit has more people that have some idea what they're talking about. I'm by no means an expert, but it feels good to discuss or lament with someone who actually cares.  The only things I can discuss with my friends is the normal... Work, food, how tired we are. And even though reddit has like some of the most awesome people on the planet, they're just a bunch of fellow humans shouting into the void. I don't ever see myself making a significant connection with anyone on reddit nor am I aiming to. I've learned not to put a lot of value of strangers' opinion of me.  I have been involved with several other communities, including over a good 13 years with a group of people in an IRC channel who I feel comfortable calling my friends. They're probably the only group of internet strangers I would consider my friends.  I have groups of acquaintances from MMOs that I am friendly with of Facebook and Twitter.

The reason I got into Android was because they were bringing their phones and tablets to me for help and I had barely touched an Android device. I get a few iPad help requests and sometimes I am baffled at how simple things are, but at other times, I'm initially perplexed but I find out how to do it without breaking a sweat in front of anybody. I've always found that by telling them there's nothing they can do to screw up their devices (aside from physical damage) helps them with being more comfortable with using their devices. So far, the worst thing I've encountered was a guy whose iPod Touch screen was permanently zoomed in. They all go to safe websites and don't install any apps (the permission screen scares them) so I feel comfortable with telling them to go nuts. And they know I'm a phone call away around the clock."

I had an old lady actually say it to a friend of hers, when they were chatting about a young boy on a tablet.  ""They're good at it because they aren't scared they're going to break it, like we are!""  Made me smile so hard, I thanked her for verbalizing a theme I've dealt with for a long time :)."

I stopped commenting because alot of people can be very cruel and i would often feel very misunderstood. Which hurts alot because i have so little social interaction, and i always really put my heart into it ;-; so now i lurk on reddit but i connect with people on subreddit chatrooms :)"
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,ihatebeingfa,2,Sun May 3 18:19:48 2015 UTC,"I stopped commenting because alot of people can be very cruel and i would often feel very misunderstood.   Yes, this is the worst.  Though to be fair, when I say stuff irl, people very often misunderstand, too.  Here at least there are no real world consequences to the misunderstanding."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,against_nature,4,Sun May 3 18:45:12 2015 UTC,"I don't know of any other places where people can talk about this. What are some other communities where people can talk about being FA? I like this sub much better than the main sub, I just wish it were more active."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,agirlwhonevergoesout,8,Sat May 2 01:42:30 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's what it's like for me.  I've actually tried to discuss it in other places, and I've either been met with disbelief or, (well-intentioned, I'm sure) private questions as to whether I'd been abused as a child (Absolutely not.)  Our society pretends that life is supposed to be a string of little victories and experiences, that everyone's love life either features a soulmate, or, if not, at least a diverse and numerous group of passionate lovers.  Of course, this is not reality for many people, and I might even say anyone, regardless of whether they are FA.  But apparently the notion that someone might be alone forever is something that challenges that myth like nothing else, and I've found that when people talk about it, they mostly want to dismiss or disarm it."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,against_nature,3,Sat May 2 06:02:14 2015 UTC,"Yes you;re right.. people also like erasing my own experience because being FA is unfathomable to them.  I really hate that,  I already feel unwelcome in the world, and even my experiences of being shunned and invisible is being dismissed.  What the hell.."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,against_nature,3,Sat May 2 14:48:59 2015 UTC,"I like the word 'erasure', as I do think it's the same mechanism that leads to majorities dismissing the experiences and existance of ethnic and sexual minorities--although I'm not quite ready yet to compare being 'FA' to being a minority in that sense."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,against_nature,2,Sat May 2 18:40:09 2015 UTC,"it's the same mechanism that leads to majorities dismissing the experiences and existance of ethnic and sexual minorities   Yeah, and I find some irony there too, for me.  Because I believe FA is in many ways a social justice issue, but as soon as you start talking about social justice, you're one of THOSE people, and you need to die in a fire."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,against_nature,2,Sat May 2 22:35:43 2015 UTC,"Because I believe FA is in many ways a social justice issue   I'm not so sure.  Yes, it would be nice if society stopped assuming that happy love lives and healthy companionship are the default options, because it's not true for many people, especially older people.  However, I don't think most of us need the cooperation of 'society' to fix our problems; we may need as little as one person.   as soon as you start talking about social justice, you're one of THOSE people, and you need to die in a fire.   For a platform that prides itself on providing freedom of speech, the population of Reddit is actually really fanatical about policing behavior based on stereotypes."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,NeverGoesStale,2,Sun May 3 08:37:49 2015 UTC,"Well, there are some co-occurring things with FA that are a social justice issue...  Like if you're FA because of Asperger's, then it's about accepting diverse neurotypes and having greater access to social development resources for adults with this disorder.  Like if you're FA because of child neglect or emotional abuse, the issue there goes without saying.  Life if you're FA because you're profoundly ugly -- there should be an acceptance movement based around that.  Like if you're FA because of poor social skills -- I think this is actually partially a social class issue, and partially an education issue.  One of my frustrations in life is that what we need most to succeed in life is just not taught in schools.  And if you're FA because of depression, it's about mental health care access, and so on."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,donemythyme,2,Sun May 3 18:51:23 2015 UTC,"Well, there are some co-occurring things with FA that are a social justice issue...   True, but social justice - and I'm not completely familiar with all its terminology, so correct me if I'm wrong, seems to resolve around cultural identies that people can't or don't want to change.  Black, gay, fat, etc.  FA people mostly seem to be obsessed with escaping that identity.  I'm not sure you can build a movement around an identity most people seem to want to get out of.   Like if you're FA because of poor social skills -- I think this is actually partially a social class issue, and partially an education issue. One of my frustrations in life is that what we need most to succeed in life is just not taught in schools.   To some degree, English class is all about adopting the mannerisms of a different social class; I'm reminded of this essay by David Foster Wallace.  (It's huge; skip to the part about Standard White English, and his well-intentioned but inconsiderate attempt to explain this to Black students).  This is one of the things that our society was actually better at in the bad old days when it openly acknowledged that social class mattered a lot for your success in life."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,GreenSkyFish,1 point,Sun May 3 19:19:34 2015 UTC,"cultural identies that people can't or don't want to change   Well, you can be part of the lower/working class, and want to change that.  Not everyone stays in the same class they're born in, and is also one of the ideals of the American Dream/whatever.  Also, you can have a mental illness, and want to get out of that, and one of the ways to get out of that is to make sure you have access to adequate mental health care, and can do so without facing societal stigma."
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,Foliagus,2,Mon May 4 07:41:22 2015 UTC,Good point.  Then I suppose the only thing standing in the way of FA as a social justice issue is getting organized.
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,takeyourfill,3,Mon May 4 19:44:21 2015 UTC,"Well I used to post on Imageboards. The complete anonymity is great for insecure people to be themselves, but at the end of the day you don't really connect with anyone. The second you stop actively browsing the loneliness creeps back so you start browsing constantly. Here on reddit is like the best of both world I'm effectively anonymous, but I also have a name so I can pretend that people recognize me and I'm part of the community. It's the next best thing to friends!"
ForeverAloneWomen,34k0s0,Foliagus,2,Fri May 1 21:49:12 2015 UTC,"Exactly my thoughts. I live in a small town filled with close-minded people. On Reddit, you can fall into interesting subs, meet cool people, speak your mind and, even if anyone judges you, you're still anonymous."
ForeverAloneWomen,34fm0u,AdventuresInSolitude,6,Thu Apr 30 19:07:35 2015 UTC,"I'll set 3 goals for this month:  Goal 1: Sign up for driving lessons, for real this time. Borrowing my goal from last month because I seriously, seriously need to learn how to drive. Seriously.  Goal 2: Spend 30 minutes in nature every day. I've attempted this challenge the past couple of years, but have never been able to complete it. 2015 will be the year! I've spent way too much time sitting in my room on my computer these past few months, it's about time I got some fresh air. And being outside always makes me feel better.   Goal 3: Wear a dress or skirt at least once a week. So I can feel more feminine."

My first lesson isn't until mid-June though, so Goal 1b is to practice driving at least twice before the end of the month.   Goal 2: Have I spent 30 minutes outside every day? Yes. Technically, playing on my phone while sitting on a covered patio counts. Too bad my goal specifically mentioned spending time in nature and not just outside. Goal 2b will be to spend a total of 10 hours legitimately in nature, with no electronics.   Goal 3: I've worn skirts twice this month. So far so good."

Have tons of shit due at my internship, papers for my classes, presentations etc. I will get this stuff done...I have to. But I will try to do it gracefully.  Buy 2 new pairs of shoes by the end of this month. I am sure to some of the ladies here, that may seem more like a reward/pleasure than a goal...but when you realize that I literally only have 1 pair of dress shoes (that's cheap and one size too small and caused the heel of my foot to bleed) and the rest of my stock is Nikes, you understand the difficulty. I've been researching shoes/styles though, might go to the mall with my parents this weekend. I've realized that I have no means of personal...relaxation if you will. I am not good at relieving stress. When I play video games or talk to my friends, it's fun and it's a distraction...but I don't really alleviate much stress compared to say something like...therapy or jogging. Thus, I want to begin some personal research into mindfulness and stuff. I can't be arsed to do the yoga, but the basic breathing exercises and being aware of my feelings/stress could help out. I just need to keep reminding myself to breathe a little bit rather than living under this constant cloud of stress."

As for my classes, I had 2 major presentations I was freaking out about but I got through them! I still have 1 full paper to write, and another to revise. I'm close to finishing, I'll be done with my classes by Wednesday.  2-I got one pair of very nice Rockports that my feet have finally gotten used to.

ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,LostCoffeepot,2,Thu Apr 30 04:26:06 2015 UTC,I enjoy conversations with my creosote bush. What kind of plants do you talk to?

ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,trail22,2,Thu Apr 30 17:58:02 2015 UTC,"I thought people hated my personality. Turns out I just needed to know more people. But meeting people in a positive enough frame of mind is tricky. Its best to do it while doing something you love, but finding something you love that involves people that like you...   Well that took me personally a good decade. But it happened; but now it happened I wonder if I should leave them seeing as even though they  make me feel wanted and important;  the group I am in seems to not attract people that are attracted to someone like me."
ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,-lost-at-sea-,3,Fri May 1 01:41:54 2015 UTC,"It's always possible. Sometimes people talk to me when I feel terrible, and sometimes they talk to me when I feel great. I've found that there really isn't a pattern to it, and I'm afraid that I'll fall back into the mindset of having to be ""good enough"" or ""put on a good show"" whenever I'm around people.   Or maybe you just mean not assuming the worst about them. I'm glad you got some results, either way. In my opinion no group's going to be perfect, but respect and honesty between members is essential."
ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,LOW-rah,2,Fri May 1 23:51:46 2015 UTC,"Perhaps a strange comment, but....I like your writing style. Your personality jumps right through in this post.  That said, I can relate to the whole getting-bogged-down-by-socializing versus getting-lost-in-your-hobbies thing. For me it comes down to being an introvert. Socializing takes a lot out of me, and I need so much time to recharge that I often just have to shut down and do nothing. But then I somehow need to be social to some degree to keep going (it doesn't make sense to me).   I used to be very critical of myself and thought that people didn't like my personality. I still think that way sometimes, on bad days. But I eventually realized that it was all just me, and my judgment of how others' perceived me. Now that I'm older, I think it's much more likely that people are either ambivalent about my personality or they don't think much at all about it. That might be a more depressing thought, but I find it somewhat freeing."
ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,LOW-rah,2,Sat May 2 03:22:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks. I really appreciate this right now when I'm coming back from opening up a little to someone and being told they only understood 4-5 words of what I said, and having it laughed off. Not that it was a deeply sentimental topic or anything, but yeah.  There really is a duality to being an introvert that requires a delicate balance between self and other. The older people in my family seem to have found it, being in steady jobs and married with spouses, but it's ones like me and my brother who still seem lost. I know a lot of people are frequent communicators throughout the day with phone calls, face to face talking, texting, e-mail, Facebook messages, etc, but it all seems so busy to me. At the same time, if you're not present who's going to take notice?  It is freeing to think that, at the very least, there's not a hostile force barring me."
ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,LOW-rah,2,Sat May 2 04:11:34 2015 UTC,"You sound like a nice person. In my mind it's very admirable to have strong passion and love for something. It's also good that you have very clear understanding of your situation. Ok, we can agree that maybe you shouldn't incorporate your passions with socializing (unless you would be okay talking about writing etc. online? That way it might be easier to meet someone likeminded and have more controlled conversation). Could you elaborate a little about the socializing part...? What happens?   When struggling to meet people you could focus on yourself first. Other thing you can do is try to figure out why you're struggling and how to fix it or find ways to relieve these problems. To me you sound like a very passionate person and in my experience passionate people can be sort of lone wolves. But once they meet people who understand them they will make friends for life. Not everyone understands these kind of people, for example, with new people I'm more like a calm observer and for me passionate and excited people are a bit overwhelming.   edit. and btw, in everyday life I probably talk more to my cats than to actual people."
ForeverAloneWomen,34d39q,notovertonight,3,Thu Apr 30 05:23:26 2015 UTC,"Oh, trust me, I know that most people don't want to hear about the writing habits of famous authors as a conversation point (although, there's some saucy things you should know about... never mind). That leaves us with mostly lukewarm topics for me, though, and it's hard to make strong connections if people have to hold back parts of what's meaningful to them in life.  As far as socializing goes, nothing happens. I don't get annoyed looks and people walking away, but I also don't make more than surface connections. Usually if I skim advice articles on the topic, all the points are things like ""Are you giving other people room to talk?"" and ""Are you asking questions to keep the conversation going?"" which aren't part of the problem. I'm only slightly uncomfortable in new company (is that even uncommon?) and I'm not a misanthrope who hates all the people around me.  At one point I was so desperate for answers that I asked a couple of online friends I play games with if anything seemed off about my voice or mannerisms. I'd made a friend on a forum who actually lived about half an hour away, and immediately after our first IRL time together he became suspiciously absent all the time. No one said there was anything off. They pretty much concluded that a) he was the weirdo or b) he was a guy hoping for something more who didn't like what he saw -- surprise, surprise.  Maybe there is something a bit off. I don't know if I entirely trust their conclusions. I had speech problems in preschool and elementary school where ""r"" and ""s"" consonants came out as ""w"" and ""th"". Even after speech therapy I tried to normalize my speech and am usually successful. Occasionally people from my own state ask where I'm from, which is a lot better than what I heard in grade school, I guess. I used to volunteer as a peer tutor on campus and I still think that was part of why a lot of the ESL students felt comfortable with me.  Whew, a lot actually wound up coming out of what was supposed to be a short reply. Thanks for responding, though."
