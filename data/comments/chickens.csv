chickens,3e0uaa,chingchongtong,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:36:01 2015 UTC,"I'm no expert. That said, I would expect a rooster to be taller and more ornamental. Were the chicks sexed? I have one I was afraid was sexed wrong for a while, but came to see I was just a worry wort :p"
chickens,3e0uaa,nocomment_owl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:37:40 2015 UTC,"I got all 3 from a Western Feed store. They ""should"" all be female but there is a warning about a possibility of errors.

chickens,3e0uaa,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:41:36 2015 UTC,"What you have is a Brahma, which is considered a large breed. At 5 months old you'd know if it was a rooster. I can't give a 100% definitive answer without seeing the whole bird, but I will say that at that age it has the appropriate head for a pullet."
chickens,3e0uaa,SmallYellowPlane,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"Looks hennish. Look for saddle feathers, long ones on the back, in front of the tail."
chickens,3e0uaa,chestypocket,2,Tue Jul 21 04:26:15 2015 UTC,"If this is a recent development, I would say she is a pullet that is getting ready to lay. Their combs and wattles will grow and turn red right before they start laying. She may also get very squawky (practicing the egg song) and begin to squat when you approach her. Check the whole coop and run (or yard) for eggs periodically. I didn't notice for two weeks when my first girls started laying because they weren't using the nest boxes. Very sad to miss out on the true first egg."

chickens,3dzd0r,ponchothecactus,2,Mon Jul 20 19:32:46 2015 UTC,"Get her some eggs to hatch.  Size shouldn't matter, but she will have to get a couple pecks in to make sure the pecking order is established. Did they grow up together?"
chickens,3dzd0r,SmallYellowPlane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:31:32 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, none of the hens grew up together. I have a rhode island red which is the only remaining bird from my first flock. She was about 75% fully grown when all our other chicks got killed, so we put her in with a fully mature muscovy we got from a friend and they had no problem. A couple months later, we tried to put the silkie in the coop with the other two after our second silkie had died, and immediately the two of them started attacking her. It wasn't even pecking order like I've seen in my other flock, it honestly seemed to me like they wanted to kill her"
chickens,3dzd0r,SmallYellowPlane,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:53:15 2015 UTC,"Do you have the space for 2 flocks? I'd still give the silkie some eggs, let her raise the babies, and once they are big, mash the flock together. Give her some bird-backup.   Or rehome her to someone who can try to blend them with their flock."

chickens,3dqo0q,SmallYellowPlane,3,Sat Jul 18 14:55:00 2015 UTC,"I'm somewhat interested in this, too. I don't know much about turkeys, but I do know that as chicks they can be dangerously stupid. Like, they can drown in a half inch of water in a bowl kind of stupid.  If I had a bit more space I'd still give them a shot."
chickens,3dqo0q,on_a_moose,2,Sat Jul 18 15:28:42 2015 UTC,"Totally did NOT work out. We raised a bunch of Narragansetts. First of all, they're extremely fragile and out of the first batch of 15 poults from Murray McMurray (which is normally just fine), all but 2 died in transit. They sent us another batch free, but about half didn't make it. Then they were too stupid to eat, even though we not only showed them repeatedly, but also put in a couple spare chicks to show them how to do it. Then when the two that were left grew up and turned out to be toms, they were constantly chasing me around the pasture and would NOT take no for an answer. Obviously if yours are contained and you handle them often this won't be an issue, but ours were livestock, not pets. They ate a lot (chicken feed) but were ok as foragers so feed wasn't any worse than the same weight of bird in our free range chickens. We ended up selling those two.  So on a surviving-poult basis, I'd say they're cost effective compared to a pastured production turkey, especially if yours are pastured too. However, given that poults aren't cheap compared to chicks and how many you need to start with just to get some survivors, I'd say it's not worth it."
chickens,3dqo0q,kziv,2,Sat Jul 18 17:57:58 2015 UTC,"We free range on an acre. I'm hoping to start with a couple teens instead of babies, I've got to get to the feed store and see what they have.   Drawing the line between livestock and pet is going to be the hard part, I think."
chickens,3dqo0q,kziv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:07:27 2015 UTC,Getting them as teens may make it easier since the chance that they'll bond with you is much less. Sounds like you haven't slaughtered any chickens yet? It gets easier after the first couple.
chickens,3dqo0q,kziv,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:24:16 2015 UTC,"No, haven't done any of my chickens yet. I've sent of couple mischievous roos to my neighbor, he'll be processing the turkeys for me too.   Did you house yours with the chickens?   And should I be looking for girls or boys or does it matter?"
chickens,3dqo0q,Chickenfu_ker,2,Sat Jul 18 18:28:04 2015 UTC,"Yep, ours stayed with the chickens, but our coop is also large enough that we can walk into it with a full size door. The turkeys often wouldn't go in at night once they got big enough and would usually roost on the coop roof or the fence around the coop yard (that all the birds would hop over in the morning).  I'd go for toms if possible for more meat per bird, but I'd say breed is more important in that regard. Can't really help you there since we went for the heritage breeds for maintaining a flock (HAH!)."

chickens,3d6prb,Twizler73,1 point,Mon Jul 13 23:17:47 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear you took losses, I hope your remaining hens turn up OK. You have three decent options I can see for exclusion during the day.   A sufficiently tall fence around your yard/property. Chain link or whatever would work. An electric fence. Cheaper perhaps, a bit iffy if it can be jumped. A closed run for the chickens, covered with chain link or hardware cloth (chicken wire won't do much against dogs).   For mitigating strays that you catch on your property, you would be within your rights to shoot them if they're an immediate threat to your livestock. It may be more complicated though based on your location, inside city limits, or other factors."
chickens,3d6prb,on_a_moose,1 point,Tue Jul 14 04:54:58 2015 UTC,A fence around all my property might not work. I'll definitely look into getting a (bigger) run though.
chickens,3d6prb,Grimsterr,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:32:10 2015 UTC,"Unless we're home and monitoring them, our chickens are in secure runs, no chicken wire here, chain link and welded wire only.

There's this one little anklebiter that comes in my yard and just barks at me from a distance, but my rooster would kick his little ass so no problem there.  The last time it was dogs from 2 miles away!  From a subdivision even.  They really did a number on my flock, I went from a dozen to 1.  When they came back and were trying to find a way into my goats, I killed one, the other of course fled and didn't return.  This is when I found out first hand that chicken wire will NOT protect your animals, the dogs literally ripped a hole into the side of my coop."

chickens,3d01ul,DERPESSION,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:58:13 2015 UTC,"Gardening gloves work fine, throw a towel over her and put her outside. If she keeps coming back to the roost and is broody you can make a simple brood box with some chicken wire. Basically take a roll of chicken wire and make about a 3 foot diameter tube. Stand the tube up, affix some kind of watering apparatus to the side or bottom. Pop chicken in the brood tube during the day. The open air and sunlight will break their brood after a few days. You can let the hen out at night to go back into the hen house. If she refuses to get off the eggs the next day, pop her back into the brood box. Most stubborn hens will only last two-three days before I break the brood. The extra hormones produced by brooding, is what makes them a little mean. The sunshine and open air of the brood tube, really helps reset their little chicken brains. I get a lot of good info in r/backyard chickens. My mom used to tell me horror stories of her gran making her get eggs out of the hen house and the chickens pecking her little hands! Her gran forgot to tell her not to try and grab the eggs the chickens were still sitting on!"

I lined them with half of a menstrual pad, and they worked quite well once he got used to wearing them.  My two birds now are only part-time indoors. They spend a couple hours cruising around downstairs at night, then go in their indoor cages when I go to bed.

Does the chicken have stress bars in its feathers? If so I would supliment their diet with some un-medicated grower crumble or meal worms.

I would second the grower feed, and or up the meat and proteins that he is being fed. Feathers are made of protein, so it's an important part of the chicken diet.  First guess for breed is a black australorp, however the feathered feet make me think something else... And yes for shelter if you want him to last long."

chickens,3bxfpw,ORDelawares,2,Fri Jul 3 17:01:34 2015 UTC,"With a beard and the feathers on the outside of his legs and especially that bubblegum comb ... I think he is an Olive Egger cross breed form one Easter Egger and one Black Copper Marans (or similar) parent. He was probably dumped near you when his owners figured out he was a cockerel. Lots of neighborhoods prohibit keeping ""roosters"" and people don't have a contingency plan for what happens if one of their cute chicks turns into contraband. Cruel.   If you want to keep him around, feed him ""all-flock"" or ""grower"" type poultry food, NOT food for laying hens. Also water and shelter are important.   If you want to re-home him, then craigslist usually works. Particularly if you don't mind someone eating him. He looks super skinny & ratty at the moment, though. Makes me sad."
chickens,3bxfpw,on_a_moose,2,Sun Jul 5 00:57:40 2015 UTC,"Nice roo. For food, I'd suggest getting a bag of grower crumb (or sometimes called crumble). It's a bit higher on the protein, and a bit lower on the calcium than layer blends, which should help him fill out a bit. A bag isn't terribly expensive, and for a single roo will last forever (any surplus could even be stored for next time, abandoned chickens are very common - especially cockerels - I'm kinda surprised this is your first). A frightening number of people hatch out chickens and then wimp out when it comes time to cull the cockerels.  I can't be much help on breed, hopefully someone else here will recognize and confirm that.  One last concern though is the lack of shelter at night. In all likelihood he won't last all that long, if you have raccoons or other small predators in the area (and you probably do, especially near a pond). Chickens should really be cooped or crated at night, else they're easy prey for coons. If you go this route, keep in mind that raccoons will reach through the bars of anything coarser than hardware cloth, and WILL pull legs and wings out which they will eat on the spot. Whatever you use to contain him at night (if you choose to) needs to be secure against attack, or placed indoors."

I will look into the crumble, the closest thing we have to a feed store is Tractor Supply, would they have anything like it? How much should he weigh, or really what should his chest feel like, he is roughly about 2 ft tall and right now his breast bone is extremely prominent.  Any guess on age or why he doesn't have a comb?   We hadn't thought about predators, I'm sure there are coons around, I guess we had all figured with his giant spurs he could take care of himself. We will start working on a safe place for him soon, right now there are lots of hiding spots and places to get out of the elements, but nothing to escape from major predators."

I didn't actually notice until well after the fact, because it was already healing and there wasn't any blood on it anymore. He still has a bit of a chip in it, but he doesn't seem to notice it, and he acts normally.  Honestly, I wouldn't be too worried. As long as you can prevent pecking, there shouldn't be much of an issue. Apply neosporin (must be UNMEDICATED, medicated neosporin uses the ""-cain"" meds in their recipe which are poisonous to chickens) and Blu-Kote (although personally, I prefer Pick-No-More to Blu-Kote) as needed, and you shouldn't have any problems."

With bullying, you will see feather loss and chasing, often devolving into sores and wounds if left to fester.  This sounds more like a sick or injured hen. You should separate her. A small dog crate in the laundry room, garage, etc. (somewhere quiet and not too bright, too hot, or too cold). Line it with a towel, put it a small feeder and waterer. When you catch her, you need to check over her entire body for wounds or injury. Check her neck, between the wattles, thighs, and fluff for any parasites. If you even suspect mites/lice, buy some permethrin powder and dust her. You may as well also deworm her, since it can be difficult to diagnose internal parasites; use whatever chemical (NOT natural) wormer the feed store has available. If there has been any feather-picking, you should apply Pick-No-More to the affected areas.  You shouldn't be feeding many treats. If you can, buy a higher protein feed at your feed store (grower is a great option, and a good grower will be around 18% protein and non-medicated) and put some Sav-A-Chick electrolytes in her water. Occasional treats are OK, but they are closer to candy than real food, and have little beneficial value.  You should also watch the rest of your flock for any symptoms, in case this is environmental or contagious.  Can you tell me more about your Brahma with wry-neck? What was her age? Were there any other symptoms? What, exactly, did the wry neck look like?"
chickens,3bgptr,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:36:51 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the help.  I have her in a large rubber maid container (without lid) in the bathroom. I checked her over and didn't see anything noticeable. Her butt was kind of poopy this morning, so I gave her a warm water soak and that washed away most of the poo.   We switched them all over to layer feed recently, and she won't really touch that. We also got a small bag of grower feed yesterday and she isn't really eating that either. I gave her some corn I cut off the cob yesterday and today, and she devours that. She also will munch down meal worms without hesitation. I just fed her some plain yogurt and strawberries, which she ate no problem.   I saw two hens peck her in the head tonight, and the my sick one (her name is Yolandi), laid down and didn't move. She then walked slowly into the corner, and another bird sat on top of her.   I don't see any feather picking, feather loss, or sores. She is incredibly small, and I can easily feel her breastbone and ribs. We got all 5 chickens at the same time and all were the same age, she is just so much smaller than the other three are now.  As far as the Brahma, she was also significantly smaller than my three other hens. She was about 3-4 months old when this happened. The night before she was fine, then in the morning I opened the lid to the house and she was sitting on her stomach and her neck was twisted around and her head was on her back looking up at the ceiling. I didn't notice anything else about her other than the fact that she was smaller than the rest, but not as small as Yolandi. I syringe fed her honey water, some Vitamin E, and crushed up food for a few days but she ended up dying through one of the nights. Her neck did straighten out before she passed though."
chickens,3bgptr,GallusLafayetti,2,Mon Jun 29 02:53:09 2015 UTC,"Given that both of your hens were stunted, I'm inclined to think you may have either a contagious disease (with mild morbidity and mortality) or for some reason your flock is experiencing a nutritional deficiency or similar issue.  As far as contagious diseases go, Marek's would be a possibility. Mild strains have a serious effect (death or near death) on only 5-15% of infected birds. It can present with paralysis of the legs, wings, and neck (which can mimic wry-neck or splayed leg) and birds who die usually do so around 3-6 months of age, especially in the 11-14 week window. It also presents with tumors (usually internal, but sometimes present as quarter-sized, fatty, pancake-shaped growths along the back of the neck and spine), lethargy, and weight loss. Can you tell me, what color are your hens' eyes? All of your hens?  It could also be due to poor feeding regimen, including poorly stored feed, poorly formulated feed, (what brand do you use? Do you feed any vitamins or supplements?), or something the birds are getting into that they shouldn't.  Lastly, it could be a coincidence. Sometimes birds develop poorly or fail to thrive, and sometimes there's nothing that can be done about it.  If she does make it, watch your flock carefully for any abnormalities. If you are on a crappy feed (Purina, TSC brand, Walmart brand, and similar ""big-name"" brands all qualify as crappy), switch to a high-quality feed. I can recommend this for those on the west coast (USA), this for easterners, this for Texans, and this for the lucky folks in Washington state. If you aren't in one of these areas, you should ask around your feed store and chat with local keepers about what feed their birds thrive on. And, if you can't find any information at all on good feeds, go for an organic brand - even big brand organics usually use better ingredients than regular feeds. You should also make sure all future birds brought into your flock were vaccinated for Marek's disease, and not allow any contact of bodily fluids or feather dander from your current flock with any new chicks for at least the first 3 weeks of age.  If she does die, you really, really should do an autopsy yourself, or, if you are near a veterinary school (i.e. UC Davis), contact them about doing one - some veterinary schools are willing to do free necropsies on backyard chickens, and email you a report afterwards."
chickens,3bgptr,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Mon Jun 29 03:20:09 2015 UTC,"Thanks for all the info!  I looked at a few papers about Marek's Disease. Picture 4 from this link (http://partnersah.vet.cornell.edu/avian-atlas/search/disease/502#/disease/Marek's_Disease) looks very similar to my brahma, except mine didn't have the beak abnormality. My sick hen's eyes are greenish brown. The pupil is black and circular, and constricts when I shine a flashlight in them. I will check the rest of them in the morning. I don't feel any tumors or see any skin abnormalities.  We feed them Nutrena Country Feed Layer. We don't use any supplements, but are there any you could recommend? The food is stored inside out house, I top the feeder off daily, and remove old food and rinse the feeder out once a week. I also hose out the fount and replenish water every 2-3 days."
chickens,3bgptr,era626,2,Mon Jun 29 04:15:02 2015 UTC,"I've seen some of my sick birds (my flock is diagnosed Marek's infected) have the same symptoms as image 4, and although it was usually paired with leg and wing paralysis, a few have presented with only the curled neck.  Nutrena is not a good feed. It's not a bad feed, and it's better than Purina, but it's not going to keep your birds at their best. I really do suggest that you look over the feeds I mentioned, and see if you can make a switch to a high-quality feed.  I like to use Rooster Booster vitamins whenever I have a bird who's looking down, but I also give my flock a round of it every tenth or so 50 lb. bag of feed I go through (but I go through a bag every 3 days, so you may as well mix it with every bag you buy, since I'm assuming your flock is a lot smaller than mine). I also give all chicks and sick birds Sav-A-Chick electrolytes and probiotics in their water.  I don't do it personally, but some people also use natural supplements in their feed and water; Cayenne pepper powder, garlic powder, oregano flakes in the food - supposedly cayenne and garlic provide intestinal health and fight off parasites, and oregano is said to be a natural antibiotic. ACV (Apple Cider Vinegar) can also be added to the water at a rate of 1tsp/gal., and it keeps the waterers from ""sliming"" as well as maintaining bird's gut health."
chickens,3bgptr,Grimsterr,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:25:08 2015 UTC,We had a batch of chickens that had mites. All of them were smaller than normal and some suffered from signs of nutritional deficiencues. Do your hands and arms ever itch after picking the chickens up? The mites can be very tiny.
chickens,3bcvid,TwentyThreeGaming,1 point,Sun Jun 28 00:43:14 2015 UTC,This does not look like a brooder. I hope you have a lamp on him.
chickens,3bcvid,Marilolli,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:24:27 2015 UTC,"Just got him today, we are picking up a lamp tomorrow."

chickens,3bcvid,snermy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 12:13:29 2015 UTC,You might purchase one or two other baby chicks to keep Nuggie company.  Single chicks are VERY lonely and need the company (and heat) from a few other chicks.  Birds are flock animals and they need others to hang out with.
chickens,3bcvid,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 04:58:52 2015 UTC,"As for company for him we aren't sure where to find any, we don't raise chickens and neither do any of our neighbours, preferably we would give him to someone else but for now he will have to make do with horses and baby kittens for company, he seems to like the kittens and the mother doesn't bother him, so long as the dogs keep their distance."
chickens,3bcvid,GallusLafayetti,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:29:53 2015 UTC,"Where did you get him from? Do you have any idea what breed he is? The body and head looks kinda Cornish Cross-y to me, which could be worrisome."
chickens,3bcvid,GreenCow,2,Sun Jun 28 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"He was wandering and we found him on our property, we don't have neighbours near really some we aren't sure where he comes from. As for breed I'm unsure, we have never had chickens, we have horses."
