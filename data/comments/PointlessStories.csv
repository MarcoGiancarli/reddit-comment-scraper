He'd gone into the street to avoid a trash can that had been returned on the sidewalk instead of the curb by the trash truck. Drowning in a bottle, she'd rant at anyone and everyone in the neighborhood to avoid the same mistake.   Her husband, the butcher-turned-butler, had other ideas for doling out painful safety reminders."
PointlessStories,3dtf20,ScrollButtons,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:21:33 2015 UTC,"The car belonged to Kenneth Averley's son, visiting from college, who didn't even live on their street, but two streets over, where Mark sometimes worked parties and events as a sidejob to his side-job: butlering. But Mark had had it.   He was done butlering the unbutlerable, for the Averley's truly were unbutlerable. Mrs Averley, long suspected of having once made lewd remarks at Mr Ecker, the neighborhood's mailman of over thirty years, while day-drinking with her gardening club fellows in their small but well-kept back yard, was disliked by most, and she often parked in the expectant mother spots at the local grocery store, despite being reminded not to do so by Grandma Tinny, who co-owned the store with her ex-husband, Father Scott, pastor of the church. The reasons for their divorce are a subject shrouded in mystery, but even so, Grandma Tinny kept her share of the store during the divorce, and they arranged a schedule so that they wouldn't bump into each other, though Father Scott sometimes willy-nilly violated the schedule on the pretense of having run out of milk. It was true—he did drink uncommon amounts of milk—everybody knew, especially at Laura's Baked Goods—which coincidentally the whole town had recently been declined the right to pass along a petition to have the store renamed—where Father Scott would order one simple cookie and drink way more milk than was allowed by the unspoken cookie-to-free-milk ratio the bakers had kept in place for generations—but even then, everybody knew he just wanted to see his ex-wife and every now and then ask her to rejoin the church.   No charges had been filed in the death of Little Kenny, and both families seemingly made amends. Averley Jr had long since returned to school, where he was majoring in dentistry and ceramics.   Every Saturday, when the Averleys went out on their boat, Mark would use the spare he had concealed during his employment at the house, to sneak into the living room and partially open the curtain so that the afternoon sun would strike Mrs Averley's prized orchid. It was purple, and Mark thought it disgusting. It smelled fowl, but you could never say that to Mrs Averley. She would scowl at you subtly and then mock you to her gardening club fellows.   Surely, Mark didn't want that.   Four, five, six weeks went by, and the plant was beginning to show signs of wear. The extra sunlight was taking hold of its stupid leaves and its stupid flower and its stupid stem, thought Mark, carefully prying open just a sliver of curtain, so that perhaps an imperceptible ray of light cast just on the plant."

One day I was trying to give myself a pep talk to do something productive, and then some thoughts popped up like ""what's the point, I'm so lazy and irresponsible that none of this matters anyway.""   Then it hit me. Really hit me. I can choose to be a responsible person from this moment forward if that's what I want to be. I don't have to fail at everything just because I've given up in the past.   It hasn't been night-and-day, but I'm slowly getting better.

When I told her I really want to move out when I get a job (who wouldn't?) she told me she really didn't want me to because I do so much around the house. Honestly if the house wasn't such a mess I would consider subletting the top floor.  Right before she moved into this house my grandmother and my great grandmother both died so the house is full of stuff that used to belong to them that no one has gotten around to sorting out. I can't do it as I don't know what we would want to keep. There are two rooms upstairs (Where I am) that are entirely just their boxes. If we could clear out those rooms so I had an entire floor to myself (3 bed rooms, 2 bathrooms, 1 Office) I would consider renting the place once I got a job.

The secret to being healthy is taking fish oil pills! OH MAN, I HAVE THIS SHIT FIGURED OUT!"" When in reality, it's their terrible diet and sedentary lifestyle that's causing their poor health.  These people think that by treating their partners and allowing their partners to treat them like objects, they can protect their own ego and self worth while still receiving the benefits of a healthy, stable relationship.  I just want to hug them all and tell them that they are strong enough to be vulnerable, to open up, to allow someone else to see who they are and be given a chance to be themselves.

What are the risks? Where is the operation taking place?  I'm sorry for all the questions. I had Spinal Fusion of my entire back when I was 18 (April 8th, 2013). I want to hear what another persons experience is.   I had mine for severe scoliosis, but I know Spinal Fusion is done for a variety of reasons.  Over 4 years my minor curvature progressed to severe, and by no rights should I have been able to stand erect, much less live the active life of a high school senior. I just got lucky in that my two curves were in opposite directions and were only 1° different (85 and 86).   I gained like an inch and a half, and I was already tall. That's been awesome. What hasn't been awesome is the frequent pain, inability to get comfortable, and the lack of flexibility. But it's way better than it was. After my operation I had a mild addiction to pain killers, and they were the only thing that got me through each day."
PointlessStories,3cntci,autowikibot,1 point,Thu Jul 9 16:34:48 2015 UTC,"I have fusion of the S1/L5 transverse process and bone going both directions because of a genetic malformation. I have been misdiagnosed most of my life and somehow my old doctors missed it on my previous MRI's and X-rays for pain relief.  http://imgur.com/a/Dc2Ad  The surgery I am getting will be the spinal fusion of those joints completely. Its an anterior L5/S1 surgery so they'll be removing the disc and replacing it with a piece that's about 3/4 of an inch and that will be filled with bone protein so the bones grow together.  I don't know how long the surgery will take but I looked it up and its between 5-8 hours. Recovery will be around 3 months, with it taking up to 2 years to heal fully. The doctor said it will take me a long time to get adjusted to the difference.  It does seem that spinal fusion is kind of a fix all for different things. My particular problem is somewhat rare with them growing not only on both sides but the fusion happening up and down (both lumbarisation and sacralization). A lot of doctors (and insurance agencies) seem to think that this is not a big deal and shouldn't cause issues, but its been found to cause severe pain (called Berlotti's syndrome) after a certain age.  I'm 36 now and I've been dealing with pain for about 18 years. I've been on tramadol for a couple years (diagnosed with SI joint dysfunction but that was incorrect).  After this I'll be getting my hips looked at. I've had severe hip pain for a long time and its our hope that fixing my spine fixes that, otherwise it may be more surgery. Its my hope to just even be in about half as much pain."
PointlessStories,3cntci,WallyTacker,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:53:41 2015 UTC,"Bertolotti's syndrome:       Bertolotti's syndrome is a form of back pain associated with lumbosacral transitional vertebrae. It can be treated surgically with posterolateral fusion or resection of the transitional articulation. Non surgical treatments include steroid injections in the lower back or radiofrequency sensory ablation. It is named for Mario Bertolotti, an Italian physician    Bertolotti's syndrome is defined by a transitional 5th lumbar vertebra resulting in partial sacralization. Of importance is that this syndrome will result in a pain generating 4th lumbar disc resulting in a ""sciatic"" type of a pain correlating to the 5th lumbar nerve root. Usually the transitional vertebra will have a ""spatulated"" transverse process on one side resulting in articulation or partial articulation with the sacrum or at time the illium and in some cases with both. This results in limited / altered motion at the lumbo-sacral articulation. This loss of motion will then be compensated for at segments superior to the transitional vertebra resulting in accelerated degeneration and strain through the L4 disc level which can become symptomatic and inflame the adjacent L5 nerve root resulting in ""sciatic"" or radicular pain patterns. This is a congenital condition and is usually not symptomatic until one's later twenties or early thirties, yet there are cases found where Bertolotti's is symptomatic at a much earlier age. MRI may help to detect this syndrome.     Relevant: Lumbar vertebrae | Congenital anomalies of spine | Bertolotti   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.
