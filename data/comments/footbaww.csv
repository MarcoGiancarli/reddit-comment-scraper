footbaww,2pb7e7,starsend,7,Mon Dec 15 20:36:00 2014 UTC,"It's crazy. I'm sure every team has that one group of guys that they always look back to and can't help but wish to go back in time.   I know for my father growing up it was Facchetti, Mazzola and Herrera, then for me growing up it was Zanetti, Cambiasso and Mourinho. I can only hope the next generation of fans gets a team of that quality."

footbaww,2oyde4,Sir_Raveman,18,Thu Dec 11 07:51:56 2014 UTC,I wonder what they are talking about!
footbaww,2oyde4,ThePeanutCake,17,Thu Dec 11 07:53:01 2014 UTC,or in what language?
footbaww,2oyde4,MLBM100,19,Thu Dec 11 14:45:24 2014 UTC,Spanish?
footbaww,2oyde4,PippoPLZ,10,Thu Dec 11 16:17:04 2014 UTC,Does Zlatan speak Spanish?
footbaww,2oyde4,MLBM100,226,Mon Dec 15 01:34:44 2014 UTC,Spanish speaks Zlatan
footbaww,2oyde4,MLBM100,19,Mon Dec 15 01:49:52 2014 UTC,He lived in spain for a year or two. Having lived in Italie I guess he got it quickly. Because I doubt messi speaks something else than Spanish.
footbaww,2oyde4,EffortlessYenius,12,Mon Dec 15 05:49:25 2014 UTC,"Messi probably also speaks English, being an international figure."
footbaww,2oyde4,TaiChiShrimp,11,Mon Dec 15 14:05:49 2014 UTC,I was looking some videos of him talking in english. Could not find any. I don't think he speaks english very well.

footbaww,2oyde4,mntgoat,10,Mon Dec 15 14:43:57 2014 UTC,"I guess. But money doesn't mean you take lessons. Look at the French president, François Hollande.You'd suspect he speaks good english being president and everything.  Thanks!   I don't understand yours.."
