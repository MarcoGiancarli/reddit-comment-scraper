MtAugusta,3dwe3t,Prof_TANSTAAFL,4,Mon Jul 20 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think we'll be able to make a comprehensive list. The list of reasons that should NOT be valid might be easier to make, i.e. ""I don't like you,"" ""because I can,"" etc.   I favor allowing objections to be made just like they always were, with the exception that a non-owner objection can be overruled by a majority vote of the judges and mayor. A civil court case if you will. My hope would be that there would be very few of these that would even need to be reviewed."
MtAugusta,3dwe3t,Prof_TANSTAAFL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:07:54 2015 UTC,"The list will not need to be comprehensive. The fact is that people usually object to derelictions for the same reasons. But let me explain how my idea works in the case someone comes up with something new.  Say that a person A with a very letter-of-the-law attitude invalidates an objection to dereliction on the grounds that the reason is not explicitly in the constitution. The person B who objected to the dereliction still has an opportunity to rephrase the objection more in line with the law or find evidence to support a different objection. Further the judges/mayor will have the option of validating the objection in an ad-hoc manner by a majority (usually 3/5) vote. No matter what happens, the person B (or anyone from the community) can subsequently make a bill extending the list.  I also prefer that the constitution contain a list of positive things rather than a list of negative ones. Even so, I will think about ways to include your suggestion."
MtAugusta,3dwe3t,Prof_TANSTAAFL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:59:33 2015 UTC,"Feel free to propose a list, but I just feel like it would end up failing in practice. For example, objecting to a dereliction based on the fact that it has sentimental value to one or more active citizens has generally been regarded as reasonable, but if we include that on the list, anyone could list it as the reason for their objection.   I think the threat of potentially having to justify their objection in court will be enough to prevent most people from objecting unless they have a good reason to. As subjective as it may be, it's usually pretty clear whether someone actually cares about the build in question or whether they're just objecting to spite someone or make a point."
MtAugusta,3dwe3t,Prof_TANSTAAFL,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:50:10 2015 UTC,"justify their objection in court   I may have missed something. Is this a part of someone's current proposal?  The only time the list is important is when someone attempts to invalidate an objection to dereliction. Maybe skipping the list for now is the right thing to do, and only introduce it if invalidation becomes annoying to the mayor/judges."
MtAugusta,3dwe3t,volga-river-culture,2,Mon Jul 20 13:32:28 2015 UTC,"I may have missed something. Is this a part of someone's current proposal?   There hasn't been a formal proposal made yet. It was originally part of Dan's list of suggestions. What I'd like to see implemented is what he refers to as the Council Solution. I know a lot of people liked the People's Solution, but I think it would be far too easily abused. Anyone with two friends to back them up could claim every abandoned property in the city, with no way to stop them."

Since it is annoying, people need to put in marginally more effort into pressing the stupid button to get voting rights. I don't care about whether or not it releases information; I don't think it does, though. I like this change because I don't see the point in pressing F3. The same information is presented with a minimap or other mod.   Also, if people try to bring up that people can worldownload the site, I would counter that it is already possible to do that.   Maybe, instead of having to press F3, a third option would be to have the play list open when you take the screenshot."

MtAugusta,3df5qq,WhatSilence,5,Wed Jul 15 22:59:47 2015 UTC,"The tough part is that individuals are often not truly neutral. Even before the recent growth of MA and influx of people from across the server, Augustans were openly voicing their support for/opposition to one group or another. MA's official stance can be one of neutrality, but any conflict is going to naturally create lines of division. Heck, some of the recent posts from Augustans deriding newer citizens as not being Augustan enough were probably as divisive as anything these outside influences have done.   Do we allow these outside groups to further divide us or do we unite as Augustans and stand strong against them?   Instead of closing out the world around, embrace the opportunity to shape Civcraft with MA's ideals for law, justice, and fairness. Two of the most powerful groups on the server have submitted to the MA justice system. The judges have a heck of a task ahead of them, and should be commended for their work, but I don't see how this is not a victory for the things that MA stands for..."

I've lived in Mt Augusta for over 14 months now, have been active almost daily for the most part, and have witnessed the population rises, the falls and the peaks. Basically, I am not just here because there's been a huge population increase, I am here because I want to work for this town and want to see it succeed. I always have been that way, and always will.   here is my reply to shadedjon about my platform which I feel is very clear of my views but to elaborate, I have been here a long time and have consistently helped the city time and time again, and this time I want to help in an official position because I care about this city way too much and I believe I will do a good job as a judge.  I know the duties of the judges very well and I am very very familiar with both the constitution and criminal code having seen and read every single change to it that has occurred over the past year. I will admit I do have very little experience in civcraft politics compared to that of Juz, but my reasoning for that is because until these last few months, I have had very little opportunity to do so. When I joined I was content with the then judge line up, and after that I was very involved with school. I have time now, and that is why I'm running.  If you have any more questions about any thing specific, please do not hesitate to ask. I will always be here for this city if I lose or if I win, MA will be well looked after no matter the outcome of this result."

My sole residence rests is MA and I am active daily.  Upon arriving in MA I read the constitution and criminal code and have stayed up-to-date with any amendments submitted through the reddit since. While in MA I have followed the justice reddit closely, seeing how our great judges, past and present function and the president they have set of which I will follow proudly.  I have been and am a moderator on multiple accomplished servers and I believe this has helped me develop a set of skills that will help with the task of being a judge in MA. While being a judge I'm sure is a unique experience I believe it shares some of the skills I have acquired through moderating. I know how to deal with people in a manner that avoids hostility and helps achieve the goal of seeking the truth. I am experienced in adjusting to the resources available to me to effectively figure out how an event unfolded.  I am a chilled guy and have no grudges with anyone in MA or indeed Civcraft.

I've added him to that staff team, and ever since he's been everything from a reliable right hand, competent partner, to a good friend.

MtAugusta,3dcbr8,littleChubs,2,Wed Jul 15 22:37:47 2015 UTC,"I would ask people involved to sumbit trials for each individual they believe broke a law separately. It would then be a team effort between all the judges to work their way through all the cases, at the end Prof will present a post stating whether all the people trialed are innocent or guilty and what their charges are. A case like this you're going to get a lot of conflicting evidence from both parties involved so it's important to gather as much solid evidence as possible, snitch logs, screenshots, videoss etc. I would also collect a bank of eye witness accounts from onlookers, any patterns in their accounts may be useful as evidence."
MtAugusta,3dcbr8,walkersgaming,2,Thu Jul 16 04:40:12 2015 UTC,"Hi everyone, I'm Juz16 and I've been living in Mount Augusta for a few months now. I've seen the city from the outside and from the inside, and in less than a year I've been very happy with the high levels of activity in the city. After living in many of the server's largest cities Ive found that a capable judicial system, streamlined legislation, and effective dereliction policies are critical to the growth of cities on Civcraft.   /u/ShadedJon, I'll answer your question here since reddit didn't register my last response and it's relevant to the current discussion:   What makes you think you'll make a good judge, what's your platform you'll be campaigning on?    I've served in various government positions for many Civcraft cities that have been famed for their effective governance.   I was a Supreme Court judge in Tigerstaden, the largest city of post-HCF 1.0. After the HCF war, countless hours were devoted by the citiy's judges to process the damage done by the invaders and the countless rogue HCF griefers running around the server after the destruction of the infamous World Border vault. My success in that position led to my election as a member of the 5 man Tigerstadian parliament.  I served as a judge and as the autocrat of Aurora during some of the most complicated political events in 2.0's history. After the Blood Wars, almost all of Aurora's power players moved to Duck City to escape the DRO grief HCF had left behind. This meant that nobody was available to derelict abandoned property to make space for newfriends to join the city. As a judge in Aurora I was able to do what the city needed, and handled the legalities of derelicting property in a city where that was not the norm. After being voted into the position of autocrat of Aurora because of my success there, I removed all but the most basic restrictions on dereliction. My work there in clearing out plots has led to the recent rebirth of Aurora, where a surge of newfriends and oldfriends are moving in.    As you can see, I have plenty of experience with the two aspects of Augustan law that have caused drama in recent weeks. I've dealt with politically charged griefing in the largest city of 1.0, and I've pushed for fair dereliction as a necessary part of growing the city.   My campaign platform is simple: the constitution is a voluntarily signed contract between the city and its citizens, not a work of the divine. Breaking a law that is worshipped leads to blind anger by the masses (the tookio incident), breaking a law that is respected leads to a peaceful and fair resolution by fair and public arbitration.   I'm looking forward to a great campaign, and I'm confident that regardless of who wins the election that Mount Augusta will be in good hands!"

MtAugusta,3dbcz3,Njordomir,15,Tue Jul 14 23:20:12 2015 UTC,"I'll see if I can paint a good picture, without angering anyone by ousting their secret support,  Pro-Eden Camp  -ProgrammerDan: Former dictator and still adored father of the Augustan nation. One of the founding members of Eden, yet is not deeply involved with Eden's members and bears no personal loyalties to members of the Eden militia beyond his role in the group. Will support Augusta over Eden.  -Blue_MuffinBoy: Augustan capitalist, landowner and richest Augustan man. Integral member of Carson, of which many residents joined or have ties to the Eden group or Eden spin-off groups. Has heavy personal ties to many Eden members that may go beyond the scope of the organization itself, rooted in tribal affiliation and ideology. Would tend to support Eden over Augusta, but not by a large margin, especially since many of his personal assets lie in the city.  -ShadedJon: Historical Mt. Augusta member who is part of the affluent Augustan good 'ole boy's club. Many personal ties built up to Eden members that go beyond the scope of the group. Will tend to prioritize Augusta, but never at the expense of his Eden ties.  -Nightwinga: Newish citizen to Augusta, historical ties to Orion. Integral member of Eden, has many friendships with many members in the organization that go beyond the scope of Eden. Not a direct member of the Eden militia. Due to his relative newness in Augusta, it is believed he will prioritize Eden over Augusta.  -Juz16: Historical Carbonite citizen that migrated this past year to Augusta. Tends to publicly support Eden decisions and actions of pan-Eden groups and affiliated entities (World Police, Mall Cops, Riptide Conglomerate, etc). Has some limited ties to members within the Eden group. Will prioritize Augusta over Eden.  -Siriann: Historical Mt. Augustan and ancap. Unaffiliated with Eden directly, but has some personal friendships and ties to members within Eden. Tends to support Eden over Nox when Augustan assets aren't involved. Will always prioritize Augusta over Eden.  Pro-Nox Camp  -Sintralin: Leader of Nox. Recent resident to Augusta, but is involved in local affairs. Trades often in Augusta while using the city as a second residence. Is a staunch supporter of the entire entity of Nox and any officially endorsed satellite groups of the organization. Due to her position as leader of Nox, she will prioritize Nox before Augusta.  -Thymos/XxTBxX/VitaCoco/Papa_Pound: Grouped together as they tend to operate as a unit. Members of Nox frequently active in Augusta for economic and limited political reasons while not officially holding citizenship. Follows orders from Sintralin. These members are some of the integral members and citizens of Nox, and are deeply intertwined with the entity. Will prioritize Nox over Augusta.  -Impulca: Augustan Citizen and member of the independent Augusta-centric Meme Militia who was radicalized and formed a mostly lone-wolf anti-WP group. Still heavily affiliated with the Augustan militias while not deeply affiliated to the Nox government. Will prioritize Augusta over Nox.  -296399/St_Leibowitz: Both integral members of Gensokyo and essentially representing the Gensokyojin government. Publicly outspoken against most Eden-affiliated groups and Eden itself, particularily where the Augusta region is concerned. Bears no personal friendship or ties to any members of the Nox militias, but bears tribal links of friendship to some pro-Nox members of Augusta. Will prioritize Gensokyo, and, in a trickle-down effect, Augusta, over Nox.  -Thoths_Libertarian/Soccer37222: Power citizens of Augusta/ISIS. Bears personal friendships to many members of the Nox government, and also a large disdain for most members of the Eden conglomerate and most satellite Eden groups and spin-off groups. Publicly outspoken against Eden's actions. Engages and has engaged many times in the past in combat when he feels Augusta is threatened by Eden or Eden-affiliated groups. Will prioritize Augusta over Nox.  -GTAIVisbest (Myself): Leader of ISIS and represents the ISIS government while being active in MA and an integral part of the Augustan Meme Militia with heavy pro-Nox ties. Has publicly spoken against Eden actions on the subreddit, and has on a few occasions engaged in combat with Eden-affiliated groups in the past in the Augustan region. Shifted viewpont from ""independent"" to ""pro-Nox"" following the May 13th attacks in Istanbul perpetrated by Eden-affiliated members. Has personal ties to Nox-affiliated players, but also to many Eden affiliated players, a throwback to the Orion days. Will support ISIS, and therefore Augusta, over Nox.    Other people might be pro-Nox or pro-Eden, but these are just the main Augustansters, unless I'm missing anyone obvious. Also, estimating who will put what ties over Augusta was mostly done on the fly so it's probably inaccurate in many cases. Not meant to be insulting. I'll change it if you think it's wrong"

You agree and associate with the generally anti-nox meme militias of your country, but you cooperate a lot with and seem to be similar to Blue_MuffinBoi as well as helping out with ShadedJon's projects. I feel you're  more open to and not as repulsed of the meming militias that have some Nox ties as well as keeping up the tradition of working with certain Edenites that came with the earlier administration.  That said, you're not so neutral as to be unapproachable, as I felt ProgrammerDan was at times (it comes with being father of the nation, at times fathers aren't approachable). It feels like you hold personal relations above neutrality but keep associating with the moderates of both sides and don't associate with extremists from either side to keep your neutrality."

Considering CT is broken you don't know for sure who is hitting you, and it's just as likely as you were fired upon that you fired upon someone else first.   The video really proves nothing.

I am not saying they were dangerous, I am saying there is reasonable suspicion that they did something. Generally speaking this is a vastly smaller timeframe than would be expected if these individuals were pearled privately. Please understand the predicament we are in as foreign groups essentially just staged a mini-war in our city and we are now expected to resolve it through our justice system."

The colors are our colors instead of something super subtle. I thought that a crazy colorful, unique hall better fits with our aesthetic and 'tone'; MTA isn't like other cities, we're friendly, inclusive, and our many origins and backgrounds make our city the most unique on the server.  Colors or materials can definitely be changed. I haven't measured it but it's pretty decent in size. I was thinking this could be the centerpiece to a larger garden (which I could sketch out if needed but I'm leaving today so I didn't know how much time I had). The stairs at the back lead to an underground area that can hold any more 'sensitive' areas like meeting rooms, storage areas, etc.   I can supply all flowers and leaves, some of the clay and stone, but the Redstone I'd need some help with.  I'm open to suggestions! Let me know if you have any questions."

I've been in Mount Augusta long enough to witness some pretty beefy cases and have followed each one closely, examining how the presiding judge has dealt with them. Sometimes even thinking to myself how I would do it differently. I have gotten a feel for the president set my past and current judges and believe I can follow in their footsteps in serving Mount Augusta.  I campaign on the moral of what I would want from Mount Augusta and that is equality and a fair trial no matter who is standing. Therefore i would approach every case with an open mind to both sides and deliver a verdict based on the evidence provided and not on a person's reputation within Mount Augusta."

I'm active daily, I've read and re-read both the constitution and criminal code thoroughly, and as well as this I know the town and the players incredibly well without ever forming any major alliances which could cause me to be bias. I've always wanted what's best for the city and put any and all prejudices beside when dealing with other players. I haven't been involved in any major drama in my 14 months here (quite a feat) and I have constantly been helping the town, whether it was organising and funding the factories with Dan after YB took them down, or just simply showing new friends around and giving stuff away whenever possible. I hope that all this can show you I really do care about this city, but I want to help around even more by becoming a judge."

I am not affiliated with any outside groups or organizations that would compromise my ability to preside fairly over the judicial processes of our city; quite to the contrary, I have had mostly positive interactions with my fellow citizens, regardless of their affiliations or lack thereof.

Since your post is a little unclear, I just want to state for the record that I neither asked you to resign or stay on, since I thought that should be left between you and the voters.

You cleaned up the constitution, made it more accessible for other mayors to edit, and cleared any loopholes that people had been using for months. I do think you were a good judge, but as you said, it would be wrong to continue with your political affiliations. I do hope to see you continue helping Augusta though."

It's rough on those who love the city to see people with dubious interest shout loudly for unnecessary change.   Mount Augusta is far from perfect. Our long history of absolutely peaceful transfers of power from mayor to mayor, of incoming and outgoing judges, should clue people in to something powerful, though -- the system is working.   That said, I hope progress continues on making the city better for new friends. Not just new server friends, but people from all over the world who are drawn to our system of government and way of life. We are a melting pot, a true hodge-podge. There is no ""real augustan"" -- there are just people, afforded equal protections and obligations under the constitution, whether visitor, land owner, renter, or citizen.  We would be wise to collectively remember this at all times, and temper our hatred when those we disagree with attempt to contribute."

They can claim it's for reparations but in reality, how can someone get the materials back if they're stuck in the end or given ten minutes in front of a guard mining in an already completely mined out area.  not to mention that when I tried to discuss repaying what was stolen they immediately demanded it or being in the end for two months (they then quickly changed their minds and decided they wanted both and then an essay written).  Also from the rumors of me being involved with an apparent coup in Iria, the fact that dawgthemelon3 claims I’m with him isn’t concrete proof, don’t treat it as such.  Besides, what else will extraditing me do besides punishing me for something I've already been punished for, this trial has gone for ten days and counting now, I've lost practically all of the stuff that was stolen through muggings and what i had left by being pearled by 567***(yes, i forgot your name, my apologies bounty hunter dude who lives in goodsprings if I remember correctly) now if you excuse me, i'm gonna get me some apple juice aw ye."

I personally don't think it's okay, no. I'd help lobby for your release, if that were your crime. My point is, having some kind of legal system is superior to none. If there is a decent legal system, you will have an opportunity to argue your case, or leverage for appeal. If there is no legal system, you have none of that, and are superfucked. Instead of just normal fucked.   Please use less hyperbole in discussion with me. Thanks."

I live nearby so I've been there quite a lot.  Den Haag is fucking amazing, you should visit the beaches and go to the dunes north of it if you can. I'll be going to uni nearby so totally planning to move there.  Antwerp is p depressing from what I've heard (tbh most of Belgium is) – go to Bruges if you can. It's full of tourists, but by far the nicest old city you'll find in Belgium."
MtAugusta,3corcu,DelegadoCero,2,Fri Jul 10 01:49:53 2015 UTC,"Antwerp is p depressing from what I've heard   Well to be fair, Antwerp was pretty wrecked by the World Wars, wasn't it? Like most of their architecture is relatively new because the cool old stuff was destroyed. Or I could be thinking of a completely different place, idk, I just remember we're visiting a city that was p wrecked.  And yeah, I think we're only taking a day trip to Den Haag but we're definitely gonna visit the beaches."
MtAugusta,3cqy6x,j4ckxandxj1ll,6,Fri Jul 10 01:45:51 2015 UTC,"Pff. While you're playing e-legos with your e-peens in a toxic twelvie community toxic civcraft hcf immature,  I'm  hard at work with the best minds of the country to develop a cure for the world's most dangerous virus, Norovirus, under the sponsorship of Denny's All American Diner (Denny's). Here's a photo of me hard at work (no doxx please) (haha :Pp)  That said. In 7th grade, I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all, it was spur-of-the-moment, I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didn't do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area. Every question of existentialism which I've seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else, the thoughts haven't been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me; I've considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is. Psychology, I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering, there's no aspect of psychology which I don't have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freud's theories.  While I could do a point-by-point analysis of why your self-aggrandizing diatribe is meaningless to everyone but you, it would essentially feed your ego further to dissect your message, which was the whole purpose of writing it out in the first place. Your IQ proves nothing. Your bronyism proves less than that. Your self-reported physics knowledge is likely bullshit, but also useless in forming human relationships."

MtAugusta,3ckvpf,celooooxia,0,Wed Jul 8 19:18:31 2015 UTC,Does sin even brief you on what happens in Nox anymore? This statement is going to look really stupid in a couple of days.
MtAugusta,3ckvpf,advancedkoko,2,Wed Jul 8 19:19:47 2015 UTC,she's been handling those negotiations herself. i'm not interested in any treaties or agreements considering most of eden are incapable of understanding or following any formal agreement and will simply bend it or flat out break it.

MtAugusta,3ckvpf,celooooxia,4,Wed Jul 8 22:57:07 2015 UTC,Whose property is Belial's netherfactory? Belial's or ShadedJon's? How is using a bunker to defend Belial's claims defending ShadedJon's property from aggressors?
MtAugusta,3ckvpf,ProgrammerDan55,0,Wed Jul 8 23:02:42 2015 UTC,"If they are friends and choose to comingle on issues of defense, who are we to tell them they can't? I have certainly issued bounties on behalf of belial's properties in the past, and would do similar or more if needed in the future."
MtAugusta,3ckvpf,celooooxia,4,Wed Jul 8 23:19:55 2015 UTC,"Probably because a bunker like that is an offensive position, not a defensive one."
MtAugusta,3ckvpf,Itaqi,2,Wed Jul 8 23:26:55 2015 UTC,"How do you determine it as offensive or defensive? Bunkers by definition are safe rooms, and safe rooms are used to stay safe when defending yourself."

When we have over double the amount of people voting that can legitimately say they actually live in MA. When more and more players from the two most powerful opposing factions on the server start to join. When these new people immediately start their stay by building fortresses and vaults. Do you really think these long standing players from long standing cities and power structures are just going to assimilate into MA and make it their priority? That they won't swing their server influence to do what they want with this city? Why do you think that people like Mattamattress, nightwings, and roguex7 suddenly are showing interest in this city that has stood here for a year and a half?"

Goods Factories, Nether Factories, and the time/costs involved with everything make things a bit more tense. More drama.  Bottom line - I have no problems with you.

On top of this, he only paid for around half of it himself, the rest coming from other Augustans, ostensibly under the impression the public would be granted access as needed. Sure, securing the spot was a great service to the city, as he was probably the only person here wealthy enough to do it at the time, but that hardly excuses the way it's been managed since then.

I've always taken the approach of ""If you are legitimately interested in participating in our way of life, you are welcome""  I've literally said that to former HCF people who had just recently paid off their reps. I've turned away people who hadn't.   Fact is, Mount Augusta has always been a multiple citizenship town. We welcome all. Even Carsonites. Even Edenites. Even Nox. Even HCF. Even Kohi. Even Shitbirds (legit, no lie).   People from far and wide call Mount Augusta their home. They each come with an agenda. Some are bigger agendas, some smaller, but they all wind up getting absorbed into the greater whole that is Mount Augusta, and they are changed by it, as are we. The resolution is one of joint progress, not domination and control.   This is why I'm in favor of a return to more direct democracy. We are only safe from direct foreign control so long as the mayor maintains neutrality. If only Zaphod had used that as his argument to me instead of ""muh minarchy"" for all these months. :("

There is no longer warrant to allow voting rights right off of the bat. We must make certain distinctions between people who would like to own property and have access to the town, and between those who are heavily invested in the city, consider it their primary or only residence, and whose interests are primarily in maintaining or promoting the economic and civic status of the city.

I have always been apprehensive about the autocracy, and spent considerable time lobbying for and considering ways to carefully define and limit the autocrat, clearly empower the democracy, and yet retain the ability to pivot quickly when required. My lobbying was fruitless, and my own considerations likewise bore no results. Thus, the autocracy continues unaltered. There will be new opportunities to correct this oversight in time. My position is entirely consistent with my attitude both before I was autocrat, during my autocracy, and now after my abdication.

If some nebulous outside power wants to join the mess, they are welcome -- nox/libertas, wp/eden, reformed hcf, communists, anarchists, industrialists -- it matters not.  The forces that have kept this city going help regulate against ""foreign takeover"". For each Edenite, or each Noxijin, there are 2 unaffiliated joining the city, and neutrality continues.

Yes, obviously part of what makes Augusta great is the lack of strict citizenship requirements and ease of entry. However, the problem of foreign influence continues to persist and hopefully we can find a solution that solves both newfriends being able to easily become part of our wonderful community and keeping evildoers who abuse our system for their own personal good.   They don't care for the town or for the citizenry, their only intent is to influence the city for third-party purposes.  We need to solve this. You cannot deny it.

Long before you were involved here we had a serious problem; oldfriends, powerful entrenched foreign interests, dominating our votes.  So we required people to be in-town, and take a picture of a fucking pole, to keep that voice.  It had a remarkable effect. If they want a voice in our laws, they have to be here, and that is the whole goal. If you don't agree with their ideologies, that's fine, argue against those ideologies in the open political forum and prove your superior thinking.  Eventually, if it's just some kind of powerplay shill, they'll lose interest and give up on maintaining the requirements to keep voting privileges, and their voice will be silenced. We even reduced that privilege to 30 days recently.  I can, do, and unequivocally deny and reject your premise. You and others are being entirely reactionary.

Collectively we challenged and overtook the established elite of the day, including zaphod and others. We were seen by them as aggressive upstarts, not truly Augustan, etc. and lacking of appropriate respect for their prior efforts.  It is always scary when new things happen. When new ideas, especially ideas you don't agree with, stroll in to town. Their prior affiliation is far less important then their ideas, but their prior affiliation is the easiest to vilify. In my day, it was my newness. Now, it's ""eden"", or ""nox"", or insert foreign affiliation here. They are simple labels. When these people come to Mount Augusta to get involved, they will absolutely bring new ideas with them, some good, some bad. All will pass through the ringer of supermajority, and consequential most will fail. Don't get so trapped by your fear and hate that you demand and expect others to react the same."

MtAugusta,3cigqr,Nightwinga,0,Wed Jul 8 13:00:50 2015 UTC,"While I understand the concern you have in principle, I personally don't think it's warranted. Celoxia's post cites Shaded's recall as a symptom of this so-called problem yet most of the people who voted for him aren't even Eden and are active citizens in the city. This post  isn't much more than ""muh WP"" fear-mongering.  I mean, You seem like the kind of guy who thinks that any person with any sort of WP-ties joining Augusta is a problem, so whatever, this might be legitimate problem for you."
MtAugusta,3cigqr,volga-river-culture,2,Wed Jul 8 13:13:02 2015 UTC,"It is a problem. I hope it's fear mongering, because there really is a threat. Let's take a look at the Shaded recall. We needed 75% of the vote or greater to recall.  nightwinga - orion judge and eden person  belial - carsonite who profits off of the well being of his fellow men and denies them access to key services  lord_pericrop - pretended to be friends with people and spied on them for a year, supplied information to wp and was anti-hcf  peakman - lives in new danzilona (wtf is he even doing here??)  mongoliannapolean - newfriend who plays once or twice a week  juz - jaded auroran who sided with ancaps and as such aligns himself with wp  generalthomas - cant say anything about this one, this is the second legitimate vote i've seen.   mattamatress - i dont really need to explain this one  aweary - legitimate  kwizzle - legitimate  siriann - uhh legit i guess but he only ever logs on once every half of a year so i can't really vouch for him. we'll count him anyways  Removing all of the foreigners, surprisingly we get a 21-5, which is way over what we required. Even removing the four blatant vote abusers turned it into 75%.   Do you not see how this is an issue? I don't see it as a just WP problem. I think if we implement citizenship reform, it'll force both Nox and WP residents out of voting status and hopefully allow MtA to stay neutral. This will mean I will probably lose voting status, and so will sintralin. But I'm ok with that, as I know it will provide a better future for the city and its citizens as a whole."
MtAugusta,3cigqr,peakman2,4,Wed Jul 8 13:39:12 2015 UTC,"How is it that being an Orion judge and a member of Eden makes my vote illegitimate?   I am living in Mt. Augusta and have been for several weeks. I took a picture of the pole. I meet all the citizenship requirements. Even if they were to become more strict, my vote still would have counted because I probably would have met those requirements. Some of the other ones on there are definitely fishy, but mine isn't."
MtAugusta,3cigqr,volga-river-culture,2,Wed Jul 8 14:17:12 2015 UTC,"You're not a real Augustan. You're just like sintralin. You came here to influence the Augustan system in your favor, especially since it's been so anti-wp recently. Since it's extremely easy to do so due to loose citizen restrictions, there is literally nothing stopping you.   You have no interest in contributing or building up the Augustan community. You will do one or two community service projects (if any) and write some nice posts but overall will contribute nothing aside from gridlock on the subreddit. I do not think you should have voter status because you do not have the best interests of Mount Augusta at heart, you have the interest of your own people. You will use Augusta to further those interests, not Augusta's.   I am happy that you find our town pretty and such a meaningful place to live in, and I'm glad you value the community. Be that as it may, I hope you remain a long-time resident but I surely do not want your influence in my people's politics."
MtAugusta,3cigqr,jQjx,4,Wed Jul 8 14:35:01 2015 UTC,"There is no such thing as a ""real"" Augustan. There are Augustans and there are non-Augustans.

Whether or not I have the vote, this situation will remain the same."

Examples: Thoths, Soccer, Bailey, ProgrammerDan, Prof, GTAIV (isis but he is augustan at heart), St. Leibowitz, AMB, Manure, wearyworld, Ladezkik, esf, me, the list can go on really.   Now ask yourself, what do all of these people have in common? The best interests of Mt. Augusta and ONLY Mt. Augusta at heart. Yes, I support Nox. But I support Augusta over Nox any day.

Whys that?  Has there been some plan, some conspiracy to drastically change the political climate of Mount Augusta that I'm not aware of?   Think of these people as what they are: invaders seeking to quietly gain influence in Mount Augusta   Quite rude considering I know a few of them have contributed quite a lot to what has made Augusta, still don't know what you have contributed to this town but whatever, but to call them invaders, of the political nature with nothing to back it up is rude.   They already have enough influence considering people such as them -- who spend no actual time living in the city -- are the reason why ShadedJon is still a Judge   Unless I'm terribly mis informed, out of those five you listed, only two? of them actually contributed to the 11 total votes in favor of shaded, being that the accounts that voted were  nightwinga  belial  lord_pericrop  peakman  mongoliannapolean  juz  generalthomas  mattamatress  aweary  kwizzle  siriann  Not sure if some of those Reddit names align with their in game names but I do know for a fact that out of your five only nightwinga and matta voted in favor of shaded.  Not much of a power force for one of their own, but maybe there's more eden members than you just listed, enlighten me if so.  Anywho I don't really care about whatever potential power block this group eden might have, Ive seen this happen over and over again, whether its a conspiracy consisting of filthy commies attempting to abolish property rights for shop owners; all the way to ancaps attempting to change the legality of bounty hunting and the legal rights of pearl holders or something along those lines (memory does not serve me well anymore). Either way it never comes to fruition, shit works out in the end.  Its fear mongering  But onto this portion   Moving forwards, Mount Augusta needs to adopt a ""caste"" ""class"" system in order to preserve its culture and heritage (revolving around neutrality).    Part of its heritage and culture has been how open and welcoming it, usually is (where the hell is sami when you need him)   There should be a distinguishing factor between a ""resident"" and a ""citizen"" with that being the ability to vote.   It would never work.  No amount of arbitrary rules or restrictions is going to change what you perceive to be a threat to Augusta.  Like what, to be a citizen you must have   a spawnpoint in town?  voucher from other citizens?

Besides the fact that no matter the restrictions you place, people will and can get around them to benefit in their favor if they want to.  Anything that could even come close to being effective will only serve as a hindrance to new people joining, taking Augusta farther away from what makes it great.  More than anything, its not an issue, never will be, and I can guarantee that.  And ill tell ya why, not because I can see the future, but because if there was a group that was capable of coming to town, and drastically changing the foundations of it for the worse, nobody would stand by and allow it.  People who have been living in this town and care for it would fight.  Written law and such is nice, but when it comes down to it, people would fight for what they see as right, and treat these people as invaders, as celoxia put it."

MtAugusta,3cigqr,RogueX7,2,Thu Jul 9 02:10:02 2015 UTC,"I was led to Mt. Augusta mostly by chance, but I have stayed because of the open, welcoming culture. Outlawing dual citizenship, restricting dual citizens, and attempting to homogenize the political climate are all antithetical to the Augusta I call home.   If we are worried about a small minority being able to block a majority, than perhaps we can look at our policies that require a supermajority and bring some of them back to 51%. The approach you describe is reactionary, xenophobic, and contrary to our national heritage. My Augusta is open. My Augusta is free. When Augusta turns her back on democracy, she will no longer be mine."
MtAugusta,3cigqr,volga-river-culture,0,Wed Jul 8 14:41:39 2015 UTC,"TBH supermajority is what keeps us safe from 51% -- sure, people can deadlock us into no change, but they can't easily sway us to ""their"" way of thinking via laws. Altering that threshold to simple majority will hamstring the desire to keep us free from explicitly external influences :D"
MtAugusta,3cigqr,RogueX7,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:45:23 2015 UTC,"The suggestion was just a response to what happened with Shaded's recall, where it narrowly didn't pass even though there were ~60% aye votes. It is much more likely that a small minority can block action than that same small minority convinces 51% of all citizens. But I agree, no action sometimes is better than having too much action (in laws). Every time I think about improving a law, I run myself in circles and end up deciding the whole thing is better off left alone.  I still don't understand what the Nox or Eden ""threat"" is, tbh. What would a law change that acts in their favor even look like? Even more ridiculous is the notion of enforcement -- would every new citizenship have to get ruled on by a town elder? If a citizen's political ties changed, would we have to ""review"" whether they deserved to stay? Would we have to ban citizens from joining foreign groups? Fascism, I say. Fascism."
MtAugusta,3cigqr,jeffthedunker,2,Wed Jul 8 17:27:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's total bunk. Keep yourself out of that mess or way of thinking, it's a terrible way to deal with people."

MtAugusta,3cf1lk,VisonKai,5,Tue Jul 7 12:13:26 2015 UTC,"Hi there.  As I mentioned in the campaign thread, I have extensive experience when it comes to this sort of thing, and I've proven that I'm capable. I've been a judge before, you can see my best case here, and I've also been a prosecutor. You can find my opening argument in the dragonofsomesort case here, though I invite you to read through that entire thread as a demonstration of my legal abilities.  I'm pretty familiar with the law, having written parts of it myself. I've also helped answer legal questions for everyone, including people who I was prosecuting, showing that I'm genuinely interested in finding the truth at the bottom of every case. If elected, you can expect me to be a judge who is, as I've mentioned before, a proactive seeker of truth. I won't just listen to the arguments provided, process them, and spit out an answer. I will talk to the parties involved and put in the work to find the links between evidence that various people have missed before submitting by decision.  Lastly, I'm pretty active in Augusta and even when I'm not in Augusta I'm usually somewhere in the region, so I am familiar with most of the people and the historical context surrounding events and relationships within the city. I think it's been shown that a fundamental understanding of what makes the city tick is necessary to be an effective judge. Furthermore, I will often be present when various things happen, giving me additional details in regards to the case.   So this all comes down to why you should vote for me. When you vote for me, you can be secure in knowing that if I'm elected I will be a good judge, something I think I've shown pretty well in the past. With others who don't have the same level of experience, they may seem to be qualified and they may in fact make great judges, but it's impossible to know that before they actually begin working.  If you have questions or concerns specific to me, post them below."
MtAugusta,3cf1lk,yourfriendmichelle,4,Tue Jul 7 16:45:30 2015 UTC,sir how do you respond to allegations that you are actually a GIANT NERD?
MtAugusta,3cf1lk,VisonKai,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:59:53 2015 UTC,"See, Michelle, that's a really interesting question because it's a reflection of this societal idea we all share that being a 'giant nerd' is a bad thing. I willingly embrace that label. In fact, in regards to this election, I think my love of 'nerdy' hobbies makes me a much more informed person. For example, it's this quality of being a 'giant nerd' that has caused me to do things like read past supreme court decisions or pay close attention to legal proceedings totally unrelated to me, which give me an element of real-life law experience. Alternatively, my love of other nerdy hobbies like lego politics has caused me to become intensely familiar with the law of Mt. Augusta and what it entails, giving me yet another dimension of experience that proves why I'm going to be a great judge.     yes I know this is a joke  no, we did not plan this."

MtAugusta,3cf1lk,VisonKai,2,Tue Jul 7 18:31:07 2015 UTC,"I just think it's ridiculous how difficult it is to have friends in this city. Biases are human, they're going to be apparent if you want someone who actually knows about the current events and actively lives in the city. I have my biases, you have yours, AMB has his, and Walkers has his, and it's because we all have friends. That said, when you're the leader of an important, server-wide political organization, those biases might be a bit more detrimental rather than one between two friends who have proven that they're responsible, trustworthy people."
MtAugusta,3cf1lk,neondan99,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:50:27 2015 UTC,"Sure, but simply being in an official position while having personal friendships in the city and two judges being (I think?) best friends are not quite the same thing. It's not a huge concern for me in this instance since I trust both of you guys, but surely you can understand that the possibility of cliques within the judicial circuit is a reasonable issue to raise."

You've demonstrated extensive knowledge of the law, but can the citizens be assured of your ability to impartially apply it in a case like that?   I figured this would be a concern of some people. Michelle and I have a pretty strong habit of calling each other out on bullshit, and I don't think that would stop just because we were both judges. I would probably be the first person to tell her she was mismanaging a trial (I have expressed my disagreements with several of her decisions to her privately in the past) and I have every expectation that she would do the same to me. I also am not in any way afraid of some kind of personal consequences for publicly holding her accountable for mismanaging a trial.   Secondly, could you go into more details regarding your current affiliation (or lack thereof) with the DZF? How long has it been since you held an offical position in the organization and have those ties been fully severed?    Sure. I am no longer a Danzilonan citizen, and I have not held an official position in the DZF since September of 2014. I maintain moderately good relationships with most Danzilonans and am very good friends with one of the foreign representatives, Des23 (who is also an Augustan citizen). However, working with them on Riverford was the only time I've actively participated in Danzilonan affairs since we pearled Screenname last December (maybe it was January, not sure)."

MtAugusta,3cf1lk,neondan99,3,Tue Jul 7 13:38:06 2015 UTC,As I am new i have not been personally involved in any great political or pvp events in Mount Augusta.  However i have been around long enough to witness plenty of events within MTA. I've followed this reddit and the justice reddit during my time here and have come to understand how MTA functions as an organisation and deals with the issues it is faced by. I have no association with PVP orientated groups and haven't really done anything much pvp on civcraft. I am some what experienced in pvp though limited in pot pvp. I have no intentions on becoming a pvper in mta as i enjoy other aspects such as farming and resource gathering at the moment.

MtAugusta,3cf1lk,chess-gets-girls,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:01:06 2015 UTC,"Interesting question.  In regards to Civcraft politics I have at times effectively been the manager of all domestic affairs in Aegina when Bees was often on any one of his trips causing trouble, I've been the president of the Danzilonan Federation and showed remarkable ability in conflict resolution during that war (being that I ended it), and I've also been a judge of Mt. Augusta previously, long ago in the distant past. In all three of those roles I showed dedication, patience, and reasonable moderation.  In the DZF, even before I was president I spent a period of about a month participating in conflict resolution and diplomacy on behalf of the Federation. Off the top of my head I rebuilt and constructed embassies in other cities (Pella, Orion, and Istanbul) and I participated in ending the conflicts with Seargent_Pepper, including negotiating borders between him and Syngrad as well as attempting to negotiate borders between him and Gensokyo several times before their mutual desire to go to war overpowered my abilities. I was, however, able to effectively delay conflict for a good few weeks. Domestically, I helped Weishaar and Ed come to terms after their little fight over the metro and I also helped try to calm everyone down immediately after the 'Danzmarket Affair' (though in this last case I was a newfriend and didn't manage to accomplish a significant amount). All this I did without having an official position or the power to negotiate effectively, I managed to do it simply through dedication in regards to the embassies and by being a voice of reason and moderation in regards to the conflicts.   PvP is an interesting thing to remark on. While I'm not sure how it would specifically relate to being a judge, I have some moderate experience in PvP. Back in December/January Thoths, GTA, Soccer, and myself used to do team matches on Kohi fairly frequently and, while I was definitely the worst out of the group, I do have a good understanding of how PvP works and the challenges associated with, for example, chasing down and pearling a criminal. I've also PvP'd with Ed, Trackball, JPEGz, and Des at various times.  Let me know if you need any clarifications."
MtAugusta,3cf1lk,ProgrammerDan55,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:55:21 2015 UTC,"That all sounds great! I should have made it clearer but by PVP I meant things like the WP/Eden, HCF and Libertas, as some people regard them as being PVP rather than political."
MtAugusta,3cf1lk,chess-gets-girls,1 point,Tue Jul 7 17:09:34 2015 UTC,"Ah. Well, I've noted time and time again that I'm very neutral. I like to think I'm on cordial terms with most of the people in both groups. Simply by playing the server for the amount of time that I have and being as involved internationally as I have been in the past, I've had at least passing introductions to a large number of the members of both Eden and Libernox. I don't see myself as having any relationship, either too positive or too negative, that could constitute a conflict of interest should any of them be tried in the Augustan court.  Do you have any specific questions about this issue? I might be missing something obvious."

However, I think that's actually the core reason why you should vote for me. I've shown that, in the past, I've had great success in this role. In fact, in that case, I set a strong legal precedent through logical reasoning as you can see towards the end of the post (there's also a minor clarification of it that can be found here). Essentially, I think you should be voting for me because a judge is not someone who is supposed to have big ideas or do anything new or exciting; their job is simply to seek the truth and dole out justice. I've proven that I'm excellent at both of these things during my previous tenure as judge, I think, and I'd like the opportunity to do it again."
MtAugusta,3cf1lk,MultiRobit2,2,Tue Jul 7 17:11:39 2015 UTC,"I believe the fact that i am new should count towards my case, you can guarantee i will have no bias in any cases as i have no grudges against anyone on civcraft.  Unlike amb i dont have any close friends who are already a judge, i believe it will be preferable to have someone fresh. I believe amb and michelle may be at risk of working together as judges which means 1 less personal opinion as there's will most likely be shared out of natural loyalty. I myself will create opinions based upon personal interpretation and the evidence presented."

Also from the rumors of me being involved with an apparent coup in Iria, I have no part or plan in it although they did offer positions to me so unless you count speaking to dawgthemelon3 as being a world class terrorist/rebel, I am not involved.  besides, what else will extraditing me do besides punishing me for something I've already been punished for, this trial has gone for eight days and counting now, I've lost practically all of the stuff that was stolen through muggings and being pearled by 567***(yes, i forgot your name, my apologies bounty hunter dude who lives in goodsprings if I remember correctly) now if you excuse me, i'm gonna get me some orange juice. aw ye"
