ShittyEarthPorn,3dv9l3,Awkward_Tick0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:39:03 2015 UTC,it's the area code
ShittyEarthPorn,3dv9l3,Awkward_Tick0,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:40:07 2015 UTC,Oh.  So do you live there?
ShittyEarthPorn,3diyso,PunishHerForMeErrol,5,Thu Jul 16 17:28:09 2015 UTC,It's that verdant English countryside I've heard so much about.
ShittyEarthPorn,3diyso,voon,3,Thu Jul 16 18:33:07 2015 UTC,Majestic

ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,ButtersHound,16,Tue Jul 14 20:45:53 2015 UTC,The search continues for an ugly picture of Ireland.
ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,slothbuddy,3,Tue Jul 14 23:30:09 2015 UTC,"I live in Ireland, it's not as pretty it's made out to be.  Mostly fields and mud. Grey skies all day every day"
ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,bassistciaran,1 point,Wed Jul 15 14:43:10 2015 UTC,I'd gladly trade my blistering sun for your green plants.
ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,slothbuddy,2,Wed Jul 15 18:47:04 2015 UTC,"Ill book the flights then!   Where is that by the way?, it looks nice, I'd like that as a change of pace. The constant fear of rain gets pretty tiresome"
ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,bassistciaran,1 point,Wed Jul 15 18:59:41 2015 UTC,"It's Texas, man.  The high is 100 degrees every day of the summer.  There are few clouds for shade.  Come for the dead grass, stay because you have skin cancer."
ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,slothbuddy,4,Wed Jul 15 19:10:22 2015 UTC,"Some call it hiking, many might call it bog-trotting."

ShittyEarthPorn,3darpa,SoManyNinjas,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:31:39 2015 UTC,The path through the marsh? It didn't turn out to be much of a path did it?
ShittyEarthPorn,3d2mah,icantfindadangsn,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:55:33 2015 UTC,I'll be there in september. What's the name? Is it worth drinking at?
ShittyEarthPorn,3d2mah,wtf81,2,Mon Jul 13 03:09:50 2015 UTC,"The view was actually pretty cool. Service was shitty as fuck, but it could've been an off night. It took quite some time to get a drink order (standing at the bar) and no one ever came to the table to offer menus. It's super trendy (read: kinda cheesy, lots of bro dudes and basic bitches). It's called 360 Bar and its on Andrassy u. near the Octogon.  If you go for the view, get a drink and then leave. The menu doesn't even look that interesting."
ShittyEarthPorn,3d2mah,wtf81,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:20:01 2015 UTC,thanks! Any other recommendations or places to skip?
ShittyEarthPorn,3d2mah,JoeyJoJo_1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:28:28 2015 UTC,"If you're weird or like interesting things, go to a ruin pub called Instant. Go see Buda Castle, Fisherman's Bastion, Ruszwurm, other things on Buda side. They're kinda touristy but fun. Sit along the Danube on Buda side and watch the city lights come on. You can skip Vaca utca. It's like the main (shitty) touristy place. Pesti Diszn√≥ was a really good place to eat.  edit: Going to double down on Instant. Do it.  edit 2: Going to go ahead and suggest another ruin pub, Szimpla Kert. Heard it was kinda touristy so I went to Instant first. I happened to be near Szimpla and went and it's also pretty awesome. Instant is fucking weird (which I like) while Szimpla is extremely eclectic."
