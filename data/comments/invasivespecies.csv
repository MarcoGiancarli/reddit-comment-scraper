There probably isn't an objective way to pick ""the worst"" invaders without proposing a list of criteria to rank them by. People have done this in the US (and ranked by economic damage), but that privileges damage to crop and managed systems over natural systems (which are harder to value). Problem is that they are hard to keep updated (invaders keep arriving, and new invaders tend to do more damage, for a while, than ones that showed up earlier).

I would say it is safe to assume that there are a hell of a lot of other factors that would have an effect. Here are a couple of extracts from the article if you are interested.  “The grey squirrel population has crashed in approximately 9,000 km2 of its former range and the red squirrel is common after an absence of up to 30 years.”  “Grey squirrel sightings accounted for less than 8% of animal sightings in [the Irish Midlands], which is remarkably low considering that they are a much less elusive species than either the red squirrel or the pine marten, and are also more commonly associated with human settlements.”  The health and weight of grey squirrels in the pine marten zone is “extremely poor”, while squirrels in an area without martens “are thriving”."

I've read in another study that grey squirrels in areas with pine martens are also thinner. I think I might have actually commented on the exact study that you posted. If I remember correctly, I was speculating if it has to do with the fact that grey squirrels in their native range do not have a similar predator as the pine marten (such as the American marten or the fisher), which seemed to be true.   And I wondered about the situation in Italy. Italy has grey squirrels too, expanding quickly, as well as pine martens - but I do not know the distribution of the pine martens there. Additionally, in Ireland, a possibility remains that the crash is temporary, and that those who survive adapt to pine marten predation."

invasivespecies,3dkg5t,nappythrill22,5,Fri Jul 17 00:08:49 2015 UTC,"Here is some information I got from the California Invasive Plants Council:   Manual/mechanical methods: Hand removal is labor-intensive, but yields good results if careful attention is paid to removing all root nodes and stolons. In Ramsey Canyon, Arizona, volunteers successfully cleared four acres using hand removal over a three-year period. An effective method is to work inward from the perimeter of the patch and pull the periwinkle back in on itself to prevent further spread of the weed between removal sessions (TNC 1997). Repeated removal efforts, scheduled over a growing season, may allow natives to recolonize the area and reduce the chance that other weeds will move into the area following the disturbance caused by removal activities (Mcknight 1993).  Because periwinkle has the ability to resprout, mowing or cutting results in abundant regrowth and is not recommended (TNC 1997).  Chemical methods: Glyphosate (as Round upÂ®) has been tested on large infestations of periwinkle at Ramsey Canyon, Arizona. Greatest success is achieved if plants are cut first and then sprayed immediately afterward. Cutting with a weed whip or brush cutter breaks through the waxy cuticle and allows better foliar penetration of the herbicide. Using the cut and spray method, a 5 percent glyphosate solution gave nearly 100 percent control. To reduce native plant death in the area, a 3 percent solution provides 70-75 percent control and yields good results if followed by spot applications (Bean and Russo 1986). A wick applicator is suggested for spot treatments, and a backpack sprayer is recommended for treating large areas. To aid chemical distribution throughout the plant, use surfactant and apply herbicide during an optimal growing period of good moisture and warm temperatures (70-80 degrees F) usually in late spring or early fall.  Monitoring is recommended. Follow-up on any removal actions is necessary, as any overlooked stem or plant fragments will quickly resprout. Following chemical removal, the population should be checked twice, in early fall and late spring. With manual removal, follow-up should be performed every three months to remove resprouts. After the patch is eradicated it should be checked twice a year in optimal growing seasons."

Here is a good interview where you can find a lot of answers about the zebra mussel problem. This answer is probably the best, as it relates to the issue of mitigation you bring up:   There are several ways that water companies are dealing with zebra mussels. Treating with chlorine is the most effective way to kill them. Other chemicals called ""molluscicides"" are also effective. Zebra mussels can also be killed without chemicals by passing the water through different methods such as electrical current, carbon dioxide, ultraviolet light, acoustical vibration, and heating the water. Some facilities use screens and filters fine enough to stop the small larvae from getting through. Clogged pipes can be dewatered so that the zebra mussels dry up and die, but that can take too much time if there is not an alternate pipe which can be used while the clogged one is shut down. Some facilities have installed pipes made from copper, brass, or galvanized metal which zebra mussels do not like. But that can be expensive if you have a lot of pipes. The insides of pipes can be painted with copper or zinc based paints which again zebra mussels do not like. They also do not like silicone based paints because it makes it difficult for them to attach to the slick surface."

They are called host specificity tests.  Often the registration period is over 15 years.  So yes there are tests.  And just so you know, in the United states there hasn't been any significant off target from recent biological control releases (last 40 years).  It's simply not an issue after they pass the rigorous testing process"
invasivespecies,3c01ur,captainlazypantzz,5,Fri Jul 3 15:24:02 2015 UTC,"That's a complicated ethical question, especially when the non-native plant is hosting a native animal.  These animals made due without that plant, and they can again (though with natives being displaced it again becomes more complicated). By harvesting the non-native unsustainable, you lower the chances of it spreading its seed, and thus prevent it from spreading. A native animal living in/ off a non-native plant has alternatives for food.  I would say you should go back and get the other 1/4 of the berries, and not feel bad at all (unless the bird is endangered or protected or something, that makes things even more complicated)."

In fact, I'd make sure to get the last 1/4 and break all the branches. Same applies to (edible) invasive animals: if you're fishing in Caribbean and catch Lion Fish, by all means catch more, fry them up, and eat the hell out of them til you don't catch them anymore. Do not overharvest exotic plants or animals, especially those that are naturalised but invading. Just because an organism is not native doesn't mean that it's not serving a critical ecological role (this is actually true for invasives as well, but...). It's important to listen to what scientists in your region have to say: check extension reports (for weeds) and the USDA databases if in the US; or check with the EU in Europe. There are agencies which collate and disseminate information on  what species are problematic in what areas (even if they aren't legislatively controlled).    For example, if you check with USDA plants and look at the ""Legal Status"" tab, you'll find that R. phoenicolasius is listed as prohibited/banned in several states in the introduced range. I'd feel free to eat the hell out of it and chop down the rest (as long as you're not on someone's land, etc.). Then again, with brambles... it would be difficult to eradicate it anyways."

invasivespecies,3bxtl4,Magnoliid,8,Fri Jul 3 11:39:51 2015 UTC,Absolutely. Cats have no place living outdoors. It bothers me how controversial that opinion is though even when presented with the evidence.
invasivespecies,3bxtl4,ii386,3,Fri Jul 3 03:43:32 2015 UTC,"Not just ""educate"" cat owners (which has proved greatly ineffective), but restrict the further breeding and sale/adoption of cats, neuter and/or euthanize as many strays and ferals as we can, and legally require that cat owners keep their cats indoors or outside while supervised and make it mandatory for cats to be neutered, and try to eliminate as many cats we can before completely banning them in most areas of the world except in the African continent (where cats are actually native).   As a former shelter worker from a very high intake shelter, I have to agree with you. I worked incoming, where I could get 30-50 cats a day during kitten season. I am euthanasia certified, and have put so, so many cats to sleep, most of them healthy. I have also worked as an adoptions counselor, where my job was to educate potential adoptees and OK adoptions.   Over those couple of years, I learned a lot about pets, and even more about people. I am still very involved in the rescue/animal training world, and from my experience I've found the vast majority of pet owners to be poor ones. Ignorant, cheap and lazy, putting a minimal amount of effort and money into caring for their pets. They also tend to anthropomorphize in all the wrong ways, and rule by emotion - ""I couldn't remove my own balls, I can't do that to Fluffy!"" ""I want to get at least a few babies first so I can make some money."" ""He gets bored inside, he should get to explore!"" ""Everyone should experience the miracle of life, my pets making babies is education for my kids.""   It goes on and on. People just don't give a damn. I wished so many times I could have walked someone back into the walk-in freezer where all the bodies were kept until picked up by the rendering plant, so they could see what their self-righteous ignorance breeds: bodies.  They don't care that 3-4 million animals are euthanized every year. They don't care about overpopulation. They don't care about habitat destruction and the killing off of native species. They don't care that their cat would live a much longer and healthier life indoors.   Being a pet owner is a privilege and not a right, and I wish people had to work much harder for that privilege.  Edit: I forgot to add that there are many, many wonderful pet owners, and of course at a high in-take shelter near a big city I was going to meet the worst of the worst. And also, many shelters have wonderful outreach programs, teach at school, and involve kids heavily. We also have fantastic TNR programs for feral cats, that has helped reduce numbers in many areas. So I do think education is working, but perhaps not fast enough. At least in terms of euthanasia numbers, we have been successful :    Since the 1970s, euthanasia numbers in animal shelters have declined sharply—from about 15 million cats and dogs euthanized in 1970 to approximately 3.4 million in 2013—even as pet ownership has increased steadily."

The wasps being released are Oobius agrili, and are tiny, stingless little wasps that are host-specific parasites of the EAB. So, they are neither terrifying like giant Asian hornets (which are pretty horrifying), nor are they beetles."

Undoubtedly, but a quick study will show most of these are long history. More importantly, have we had major successes with biological control, and is it becoming safer as we study it more and more? Of course.  It is absurd to compare the cane toad to a specific parasitic wasp and consider them equivalent risks."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,forever_erratic,7,Tue Jun 23 13:38:49 2015 UTC,"I'm an invasion biologist. There are, to use your language, ""a bunch of ignorant luddites"" on both sides of this particular issue. While many introductions do not result in new invasions (especially when it comes to highly host-specific parasites), most introductions are completely ineffective. We (and speaking of Universities and Federal Agencies, where I've done most of my work) have spent enormous sums of money on biocontrol 'solutions' that just haven't worked at all, for various reasons.  So, to my mind, you have three major questions to answer for each planned introduction of a biocontrol agent:   Is it host specific (so that it won't have non-target effects)? Is it good value for the cost of introduction? Is it effective in controlling the problem species?   Can't really know the answers to any of these until after you introduce them, so the problem in many peoples' minds is that we've been assured that various 'solutions' will work. And then they don't, or turn out worse than the initial problem. It doesn't require being a luddite to have legitimate concerns about the effectiveness or advisability of biocontrol. Most of us in the actual scientific discipline are moving towards more ecosystem-focused frameworks rather than silver-bullet introductions anyways. Too many years of expensive, ineffective flailing with few measurable benefits (think cheatgrass, various thistles, kudzu, etc.)."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,WRCousCous,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:55:52 2015 UTC,"My main point was about safety, because every comment here before I posted was lambasting biocontrol on the basis of the non-target effects brought about by the cane toad.  As you admit, biocontrol has become immensely safer over time.  And while we can't predict with certainty whether an agent will evolve to take advantage of new hosts, we certainly can know the host specificity of an agent before release. Especially when we choose specialists.  it's already being done. Since you're in invasion biology, you are probably familiar with soybean aphid, and the biocontrol efforts against it. Admittedly, releases of the parasitoid Binodoxys communis haven't yet proven effective (although its too early to judge seeing as how something like 10000 were released to combat a pest numbering in the billions or trillions. We really need to think on the decades or more time scale to calculate success).   However, you are probably familiar with the extensive non-target testing done with the wasp in quarantined facilities. The general idea is simple: if we're talking about an aphid wasp, track down all the aphids in the climate where we expect the wasp to live and see whether the wasp will use the aphid as a host.   As I pointed out, in many cases you can't determine #3 until long after release. And even then, you have to decide what ""effective control"" means. If you're hoping for complete eradication, you will be disappointed.   As far as good value for the cost of introduction, again, value is a subjective measurement. Nevertheless, it can be weighed against alternatives. So for soybean aphid, what are the alternatives? Well, spraying all the time, which is done. Or better IPM, which is fantastic--when you can convince farmers to use it. Or along with this, diverse strips of predator sources near and intertwined with farm fields--again, good luck convincing the farmers.   What about EAB? Cultural control is obviously a failure, it is spreading like wildfire despite extensive outreach on moving firewood etc. Then you can have some preventative measures, like treating ash with imidacloprids pre-infestation, but that brings its own problems. There are some lures, but not good ones. So what is the cost of adding biocontrol to the bill? Grant money, sure. And we can't be certain about its success, of course--history tells us that only ~30% will establish and exert some control. But why not try? What is your alternative?   I find your view of biocontrol to be ignorant of how science advances as well. Of course we still suck at it, we've only been doing it for about a hundred years. Why would that be reason to just give it up? It's an extremely complex science, we only got Lotka-Volterra a century ago, and only started thinking about specialist vs. generalist sixty years ago. It's important to keep trying, IN ADDITION to taking other measures."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,forever_erratic,5,Tue Jun 23 16:28:53 2015 UTC,"I find your view of biocontrol to be ignorant of how science advances as well.   If you want to have a constructive conversation about science, it's often best to not insult a scientist by suggesting he doesn't know how science works, especially in his area of expertise. You'd likely get more engagement (or be more likely to convince people how smart you are, since that seems to be your primary goal here) by not starting with calling them ""luddites."" You may know something about soybean aphids (and for that, I congratulate you), but you clearly don't know much about engaging others in civil conversation.  Have a nice day."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,WRCousCous,-1,Tue Jun 23 16:47:47 2015 UTC,"You claim to be an invasion biologist, but then more or less call to give up biocontrol because it usually doesn't work. It is true that it usually doesn't work, but it ignores how much progress biocontrol science has made. It also ignores that scientific progress moves slowly, and implies that just because we aren't great at biocontrol now means we won't be in the future. That is an unscientific viewpoint, regardless of your appointment. As a scientist (which I am also, not that that should matter for this debate), certainly you are aware that scientists can be very scientific on some points and unscientific on others. ESPECIALLY when it is close to their area of expertise.   By appealing to your position, you imply that your position on the pointlessness of biocontrol is universal in invasion biology, which is provably untrue, and is manipulative to the non-scientist readers of this subreddit who will accept your authority and trust what you say.   Yes, I called the posters who posted before me luddites (and moreso ignorant, in the literal sense), because basing opinions on current biocontrol using specialists on information from the cane toad release is akin to fearing nuclear power because of bombs and meltdown fears from decades ago.  Finally, you talk about speaking civilly, but your post was just as barbed, it simply cloaked its barbs in a skin of intellectualism--a common way for scientists to insult other scientists.   e.g.    Most of us in the actual scientific discipline are moving towards more ecosystem-focused frameworks rather than silver-bullet introductions anyways.    You make a clear, insulting assumption with this statement. At least I'm direct."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,forever_erratic,3,Tue Jun 23 17:59:32 2015 UTC,What is a more apt comparison then? Having only intro biology myself I don't know of a better example.
invasivespecies,3atmsr,ostiedetabarnac,2,Tue Jun 23 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"Probably the best actual comparison with this EAB-targeted introduction of a parasitoid wasp is another parasitoid wasp used in Greenhouse biocontrol. The wasp, Encarsia formosa, is commonly used to control whitefly and is very effective (scroll down to the section named ""Augmentive control of greenhouse whitefly""). Many invasion biologists and biocontrol experts consider parasitoid introductions (insects which are extremely host-specific and prey on larva, usually, of a target species) to be the most effective and least risky type of biocontrol introductions.   They don't always work, sometimes for very simple reasons. The parasitoid introduced to control EAB has to be able to survive the environmental conditions in the introduced range. This isn't always the case, and is one of the reasons ladybird beetle introductions in the Eastern US haven't really worked to save Eastern Hemlocks from the Hemlock Wooly Adelgid. Releases by the USFS and Virginia Tech in the 90s were partially successful in a given season, but the ladybirds couldn't survive the Appalachian winters, and so they couldn't establish stable populations that would effectively control the adelgid. Sadly, the adelgid has more or less doomed the Hemlock in much of its former range."

invasivespecies,3atmsr,iufan,6,Tue Jun 23 13:40:31 2015 UTC,"It's not equivalent. Cane toads are generalists, these wasps are incredibly specialized. The risk of crossover is so, so, so small. It's not like these wasps will go and start attacking other random insects. Without their hosts, they die. It might not work, but the chance of serious ecological damage with a biocontrol like this is not high at all, not even considering the testing that goes into something like this."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,MightyMalugabosh,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"It's not like these wasps will go and start attacking other random insects   Probably not, but host-switching is extremely common in parasitic and pathogenic organisms. Rust fungi, for example, switch hosts so frequently that they can track a new Rose cultivar before it's actually released to the public by breeders. Parasitoid wasps can definitely switch hosts: it's why we observe so many different species and genera of these wasps. Examples in the Ichneumon genus are outlined in this paper. That doesn't mean the O. agrii wasp introduced to control emerald ash borers will necessarily switch hosts (described in the article linked by OP), but it certainly could. It would be more likely if there are closely related beetles to the Emerald Ash Borer in the introduced range; in this case, some of the introduced wasp population might jump hosts successfully if there was a shortage of EAB.   So it's unlikely that ""these wasps will go and start attacking other random insects,"" but they certainly could go and attack insects closely related to the Emerald Ash Borer. Whether this is possible in the situation, or whether it would even be a negative result, I can't say (I'm not a beetle guy and don't know much about the ecology of EAB)."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,WRCousCous,1 point,Tue Jun 23 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"Still, the cane toad is a really inappropriate comparison. There have been many programs that have released nonnative, host specific wasps with no apparent ecological damage. Host switching can certainly happen, in specific situations involving extremely close relatives. It just has never caused the kind of ecological wreckage that our mishaps with vertebrates have.  O. agrili has demonstrated that it is capable of attacking relatives the Emerald Ash Borer, but it shows such a strong preference for the Emerald Ash Borer the USDA has deemed it safe to include in the EAB biocontrol program. In order to pose a threat to native beetles, the insect would have to survive, establish, locate the native beetles on their (different) host plants, and oviposit into them in large enough numbers to threaten their population. Since the wasp is very specific with a clear preference for the EAB, it is probably never going to be an issue. Especially since parasitoids are super unlikely to completely wipe out the host population, which means unfortunately there will be plenty of EAB's to attack in the near future."
invasivespecies,3atmsr,MightyMalugabosh,1 point,Wed Jun 24 16:17:33 2015 UTC,"* tl;dr: this ended up longer than I intended, so I'll stick this up here. I'm in favor of biocontrol research; parasitic wasps are great biocontrol agents; and they can also host-jump fairly regularly, even though they are indeed safer than a generalist like a cane toad.  I agree entirely that cane toads are inappropriate to use as a yardstick for judging parasites. That was not my point at all, and I'm not even really arguing. But to suggest that parasitic insects can't or won't evolve to attack new hosts is, from a biological perspective, resting on faulty assumptions. We haven't been releasing parasitic wasps in enough quantity, diversity, and for a long enough period to know whether they are likely to host-jump through evolution in relevant time-scales. We do know it happens (see below for peer-reviewed examples).   Parasitic wasps of many genera are hyper-diverse, most likely because they evolve so rapidly to take advantage of new host genotypes. Think about it, the Red Queen hypothesis regarding a particular kind of co-evolution suggests that parasite-host coevolution leads to either host-tracking, extinction, or oscillating genotypes in both hosts and parasites. Regardless, all three possibilities of interaction between host and parasite (or pathogen or predators) lead to fairly tightly linked coevolution and rapid changes in genotype of the parasitic organism. From a relevant peer-reviewed paper on the subject:   As a group, parasites are extraordinarily diverse. Even closely related parasites may behave very differently, infecting different host species, causing different pathologies, or infecting different tissues...It is widely appreciated that parasites are prone to rapid evolution, and because of their often short generation times and large population sizes, parasites may evolve far more rapidly than their hosts.    What this suggests is that while generalist introductions have an enormous risk of non-target effects, parasite introductions are almost certain to result (at least in some cases) in host-jumping. Examples include a mycoherbicide (C. lunatus) that has rapidly (and predictably) evolved from a useful biocontrol organism to a serious pathogenic problem in many areas of the world. Another classic example, documented by Henneman and Memmott, demonstrates that introduced parastoid wasps in Hawaii were either not as host-specific as originally thought, or had evolved to be able to ""host-jump"" to native lepidoptera. Almost impossible to say which was which, but it was likely a bit of both (non-specificity and rapid evolution).   Anyhow, I'm still in favor of biocontrol research. Grants to research potential biocontrol agents literally paid for my doctoral program (from the USDA, BLM, and NSF). I can't say that I've successfully developed any biocontrol organisms, but that is my primary area of research. The difficulty with parasitic organisms and their likelihood of host-jumping is exactly why many modern programs in biocontrol research are moving away from 'classic biocontrol' (introduction of parasites/pathogens/predators from the native range of the invasive species) and towards 'augmentative biocontrol' (increasing organisms from the introduced range which control invasive species).  * additional thought: you're right that healthy populations of EAB are likely to keep the introduced parasitoid in check, with one exception. If Emerald Ash Borer becomes locally extinct from biocontrol efforts in ranges where the parasitoid has been introduced or spread, it could very well increase the likelihood of host-jumping. We see this with organisms all the time: if you have a broad distribution that is established long enough to have some genetic diversity, changes in local populations often lead to significant changes in genetic structure. In parasitoids, this often means adaptation to new hosts."
