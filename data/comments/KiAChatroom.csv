Observe:   associated with SJW-tier insanity in the public consciousness   Not only does does the public consciousness have no idea what this buzzword means, but it's also meaningless and used by immature children who have no desire to be taken seriously or to contribute to productive discourse. It's also the common ""slur"" used by racists/sexists/MRAs and so on (coontown literally has it pinned right now). It basically refers to anyone who doesn't think like it's 1860. Whenever I see somebody use that term when complaining online I instantly see some petulant child struggling with not getting their own way.  A buzzword like that hasn't and will never enter the ""public conscious"" because, outside of certain echochambers, no adult is actually immature enough to think that way.

KiAChatroom,3dkosf,FrinkleMcDoo,3,Fri Jul 17 01:24:33 2015 UTC,"Any time people get to decide what hate speech is, they always base it on their own prejudices.   I think the answer to “hate speech”, however one defines it, is more speech (of the opposing kind) not less.  In principle, I believe freedom of speech being “as absolute as possible” up to the limitations recognised by the SCOTUS — defamation, incitement (to murder, riot, etc.), and false statements causing unnecessary panic (“falsely shouting fire in a crowded theatre”) that could lead to immediate loss of life and limb.  That said, I think there are a very limited number of murky situations that cause me to question my absolutism.  The “hate speech” and “Holocaust denial” laws in many mainland European countries, for example, may today be an unnecessary restraint of free speech — if someone wants to deny the Holocaust, the vast majority of historians will correct them — but I'm not convinced that such laws were unnecessary when they were introduced immediately after the War. At that time, there were a great number of “ordinary respectable people” — some wealthy and powerful, some middle-class — in Germany, Austria, France, and other European countries who, if they hadn't outright collaborated with the Nazis, opposed them in a lukewarm fashion at best. In 1945, antisemitism in Europe was as acceptable as racism in the USA.  The laws against Holocaust denial and hate speech meant that one couldn't publicly defend the Nazis by minimizing the atrocities and/or defaming Jews, so the only thing for “respectable” folks to do was accept what had been done and distance themselves from it, which they did, making antisemitism and (by extension) other forms of bigotry socially unacceptable over time. We can only speculate what social attitudes might be today in the absence of these laws, but I think there's a consensus that they were, most likely, proportionate and beneficial overall.   So, while I tend toward the view that, after 70 years, these laws have outlived their usefulness, I can see how laws imposing restrictions on freedom of speech can be a threat to liberty in principle and in the abstract, but be recognised as having been beneficial and appropriate in practise and in historical context.  I think that the situations where such illiberal restrictions on freedom of speech might be warranted are very extreme (such as in the aftermath of the Holocaust), and I'm not defending the cryptofascist cretins who came up with “freeze peach”; on the contrary, I find the New McCarthyism of the authoritarian left “SJW” movement terrifying, and I say that as an unapologetic leftie."
KiAChatroom,3dkosf,scornucopia,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:26:04 2015 UTC,"And now antisemitism is on the rise again in spite of European hate speech laws. They're not just unnecessary, they're ineffective. Because they don't do jack shit when it comes to convincing people not to be hateful. Only open dialogue can do that."
KiAChatroom,3dkosf,ApplicableSongLyric,2,Mon Jul 20 01:23:40 2015 UTC,"It's also a matter of equalizing the economics of speech.    There is an associated cost with the spread of speech, and those with the most money are able to get the furthest, widespread reach, and they're going to generally make decisions and statements that will, in some way, greater benefit their coffers and thus give them further reach until they're the dominant, actionable, opinion.     well, now you're just conflating free as in ""beer"" versus free as in ""freedom""     To an extent, but when you drag the legal system into the discussion that becomes less the case, because in order to protect yourself to make statements, regardless of what they are, they may be able to take action against you for, in the area of hate, racism, sexism, there could be criminal penalties. In statements against corporations, products, branded people, civil penalties.    You would be spending money, big money, to defend yourself, to find some way to worm around to prove the words you say have some legitimacy to be said, all the while you're deprived of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, even if you're vindicated in the end.   That's what makes this so absurd and a tenet of why I think Social Justice, not just SJWs, is such a cancer; because regardless of intent, the lack of protections provided by the freedom of speech would only result in further marginalization of ethic, sexual, religious minority groups and further oppression of the poor.    It doesn't make any goddamn sense."

KiAChatroom,3dkosf,Storthos,2,Fri Jul 17 16:23:24 2015 UTC,"It's not just that - sometimes the ""right"" ideas are the popular ones. Allowing unpopular, distasteful ideas allows those ideas to encounter rigorous opposition in the public sphere. It disavows any illusion of those ideas having any merit or popular support.   Conversely, banning an idea says that you have something to fear from it, that it can survive public scrutiny and become an attractive position, if not for your intervention. It gives a level of vindication to your opponent much greater than from a well-reasoned refutation.   Free speech is important not only for giving opportunity to new, progressive ideas, but also for being the most effective tool for combating the ""unacceptable"" ones."

Bank ABC sees your trade and calculates a faster route to the owner of the 1 dollar XYZ stock and buys it.  Now you can buy that stock from bank ABC for 1.05.  Some trading houses have put in miles of coiled cable in the basement to negate the millisec advantage that Bank ABC has over you.  This is how complex these networks are.  The best computer engineers in the world are working for the NYSE and the big trading houses and banks.  These guys take their security and up time more serious than anyone.  Maybe china has the resources to affect those systems, maybe.  I don't think some twitter hacktivists could do it and stay out of jail.  And I have little concern that any breech happened.  Taking something offline is a far cry from a breech.  I could however see the NYSE pulling the plug the second something looked even slightly fishy on the network.  This money belongs to the people that run the western world, and they do not fuck about when it comes to money."

That said, there's no excuse for the EU vocally suggesting that Greece abandon democracy and replace it with a nondemocratic government."
