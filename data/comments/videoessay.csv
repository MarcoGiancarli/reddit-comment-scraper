videoessay,3e2prr,MaxFischer9891,2,Tue Jul 21 14:33:02 2015 UTC,"Kind of pretentious IMO. while I applaud the notion that being ""told what to think"" is a dangerous concept, & I support the desire to raise awareness of manipulation stemming from pop-culture... His assessment is flawed in at least one way that I can see:    Narrative first comes from the depiction of progression, and second from context. In the scene with the student & the skeptic, the progression was the sequence of events (teacher speaks, is challenged, etc) and the context is whether the teacher and the skeptic are the only two impacted by the situation. The final edit depicts a conflict between two people where a third ignores the conflict (you could say she's already picked a side, but doesn't participate).    This is a CRITICAL part of storytelling. Now this movie might very well fail to expand on the relationship of the student & the teacher or how it impacted her to witness the conflict... but that is easily a critique of editing, meta-narative, & skill... rather than a systemic issue inherent to movies.    His tone also bothered me, it wasn't arrogant (perhaps some might call it that) but I felt it to be presumptive. He'd turn his inflection in some sentences, as if he'd just revealed something to the listener, but he'd do it mid thought, or after stating points that haven't been fully supported. As if what he's said is enough to convince me of the validity of his statement.    All in: his tone, the supporting examples, & what they both say about the subject he chose; leave me feeling less inclined to watch any more of his work."

He became aware of some things that consistently happen in movies and disenamored with them.  I wouldn't be so fast to discard him. I think he's REALLY good.

videoessay,3d26ee,neocow,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:00 2015 UTC,"I feel like Synder often falls too far into the trap of wanting to have amazing visuals without necessarily considering the impact those visuals have on the narrative. You see it in Watchman and 300, but the reason it works in 300 is because the fantastic-ness and surreality of the visuals is specifically woven into the narrative. Less so for Sucker Punch, even less so for Watchmen.  I feel like if Sucker Punch were less intent on being visually bad-ass, the story would have been served better, but it's hard to say because the fantasy is supposed to be wish-fulfillment for the characters."
videoessay,3d26ee,sigma83,1 point,Mon Jul 13 16:56:28 2015 UTC,"I think it serves much better in Sucker Punch.  The whole point is the layers of perception. Without the clear distinction the message of the narrative would falter even more.  I'm not saying it is flawless, by far, it's both far too heavy handed and too focused on layering to try to obscure anything, and the theme of sane in insane world and coping is so fucking cliche.    He is getting better, I think the issue isn't with the surreality, the story, or with the subject matter.   The pacing of sucker punch is probably where the name for it(the movie) came from. It just lurches, and stops and runs around in circles like a little ADHD kid till it runs into a wall, till it gets up running around dizzy and keeps hitting walls.   Heavy handed in the fights ""Hey get that this is a metaphor for what shes going through? haha come on get it, get it, get it.""

videoessay,3cosfi,ContaMontaQuanta,3,Thu Jul 9 20:58:05 2015 UTC,"As much as I'm glad this video draws attention to some of Cezanne's virtues, and explains why he is a fixture on the landscape of art history, The Large Bathers is one of my least favorite of his paintings, and I think this video made a few leaps in the effort of proving it's genius: Comparing some of the figures in the paintings to famous sculptures so matter-of-factly as if those comparisons are givens, rather than significant stretches, or that if you looked at the painting from the central figure's perspective it would look like a classical painting. I'm of the camp that the figure in question is supposed to represent Cezanne himself, especially when you consider the long legacy of artists ""hiding"" depictions of themselves in the painting -- usually the only figure looking directly at the viewer, but if that's true, then Cezanne would also see the post-impressionist scene that the viewer does. The video's interpretation makes for a cooler video, I just don't see the dots connecting in a few places. Although maybe I'm biased, like I said, The Large Bathers is one of my least favorite, and also Three Bathers, a very similar piece by Cezanne, was at one point owned by Matisse, which inspired him to go from paintings like this to paintings like this or this. Clearly the latter is what made him famous, and I also understand why Matisse is a fixture on the proverbial landscape of art history, I just don't think his paintings are all that interesting, or enjoyable. Sometimes you have to look at a given work of art in its context, and sometimes you don't. So if, even after watching this video essay, you happen not to like The Large Bathers, it's not because you're stupid, or can't wrap your head around his purported genius, it's simply that you don't like it, and that's okay."

This. A thousand times this. I linked this video essay just because I thought it was interesting and I liked his style of interpretative videos. But honestly, it's not a favourite piece of mine, and I would agree with you that the direct comparisons of the figures with famous sculptures is a tad a stretch (although I think that the similarities in form are certainly there, just stripped down).   But I think that the maker of these videos would be the first to agree with you, I really love his channel for that reason, he encourages discussion and alternative interpretations because subjectivity is what makes art so incredible.  People are often intimidated by the art world because it appears impenetrable and full of stuck up snobs that look down on those who don't appreciate whatever is in their mind good art. But art is ultimately just about getting the subject to feel something, so some things are going to work for you and some aren't, that's just life, it doesn't make art that doesn't work for you shit, or you stupid for not understanding hidden meanings, it's just not your cup of tea."

videoessay,3bx1vc,latest_lurker,3,Fri Jul 3 07:25:04 2015 UTC,Different guy but I would say try to make the video seem less negative. I don't mean praise Nolan if you have issues with his work but rather keep the focus on the on the good that you see in harry potter and only briefly show interstellar as a way to show what not to do. This was at least my main issue with the video I liked interstellar (Do not thing it's perfect) and it felt like your video came off more as attack then critique. Another suggestion would be to show multiple scenes from harry potter and interstellar to help illustrate the misuse of closeups are reoccurring things that happened and not just cherry picked scenes. While I haven't seen prisoner of azkaban the scene you showed seems to be from Cuaron's famous one takes while Nolan's is far more tradition use of it. Perhaps Cuaron uses a more traditional shot reverse shot in the film but does so in a way that is more creative then informative? I think that if you try to link the scenes shown more it will take away the issue I have with cherrypicking.  That being said I am very happy to have more people making these essays and for a first attempt this is pretty good.
videoessay,3bx1vc,mhallgren5,3,Fri Jul 3 13:43:35 2015 UTC,"I think you're right, the focus should definitely shift to what a certain director is doing right, as opposed to just hating on whoever isn't using their form that well.  However, I'm still interested in breaking scenes down shot-by-shot; I'm trying to get into the heads of the directors I'm talking about. I'm thinking about how and why they place their camera where they do, and what it does for each scene. If I use footage from a selection of scenes then I'd have to really pick and choose shots from them, so the cherry picking criticism is still valid.  Maybe it's about discussing each example within it's own context, instead of criticising Nolan overall when all I'm showing is one scene."

It is a a street, of course, but CGI made possible that so many other things happened in the background, which made it more unrealistic, at least for me. Farther and farther from the real thing.

Don't feel like you haft to stretch your video out though, because it does honestly feel like your running out of things to say. That first minute where you're setting up your idea, keep that pace of new info, because it seemed like you were treading the same ground by the end and it felt like you just showed your examples without fully contextualizing them within your argument. Like, once you set up your idea, which is very interesting might I add, it just feels to me like you're listing off these examples, and they don't add anything to the argument you're trying to present. If you're making a video essay, try structuring it like one so every time you bring up an example, think what it might add to your argument.

videoessay,3a1n7c,Slickrickkk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 14:37:53 2015 UTC,"I think when critics are making assertions about artist intention, it's always a question of whether it truly was the artist intention or whether the critic is just reading tea leaves.  I always like it when the critic builds up a strong case that it couldn't have been accidental and that a specific effect was desired. For example, with the POV move in shot, showing the logistical challenges of achieving that shot with Mookie smoothly stepping out of the way of the camera and then smoothly stepping back in on the track out would have shown it's not an easy shot to accomplish and thus, was deliberately planned to be like that.  Something like the color theory of emotions example though, the police are dressed in blue but does it have some larger thematic significance to the story that they're blue cops or is it simply that that's what a cop uniform looks like and it breaks the color theory? Those are the questions that interest me."
videoessay,3a1n7c,Slickrickkk,1 point,Wed Jun 17 15:04:52 2015 UTC,"Thank you for your input!  In regards to the points about the color theory, it was something that I wasn't sure I would put in the video. Obviously the POV shots are intentional, but I feel like my evidence for the cooler colors representing calming characters was insufficient (at least in the video). The scenes I had to support it were towards the climax of the movie and I wanted to avoid major spoilers of what happens for people that hadn't scene it. I also felt like it would break the flow of the video if I went into a 2 minute discussion of color theory when I only should be discussing two scenes. In retrospect, the ""cool color theory"" is something I should have cut out. However, I will definitely try to incorporate evidence of artist intention in the future!"
