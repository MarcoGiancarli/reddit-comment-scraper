nintendomusic,3dw8ut,ToastyXD,5,Mon Jul 20 03:39:51 2015 UTC,I won't lie I found a MIDI file for it online and then shifted the notes.   But I was sure to make the volume levels as balanced as possible! I did forget to put the source on the tumbler post however I will be doing so when I get home
nintendomusic,3dw8ut,Tdude123,2,Mon Jul 20 04:03:18 2015 UTC,So did you actually change it from a minor key to a major key or did you just shift all minor chords to be major chords?
nintendomusic,3dw8ut,ToastyXD,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:12:16 2015 UTC,"I changed the entire piece. For instance, the original Fountain of Dreams is in C minor (C D Eb F G Ab Bb C), so I changed every Eb Ab and Bb in the piece (in chords, melody, counter-melody, etc) to an E, A, and B respectively, which turns it into a C major piece.  While I'm still figuring out for myself what to do with some parts, such as if an E appears in the C minor piece as an accidental, but I figure if I keep making more (which I totally will), then I'll get the hang of it."
nintendomusic,3dw8ut,AwesomeYears,3,Mon Jul 20 04:20:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, transposition can is super weird/hard sometimes. To get all the notes correct ,you need to look at how the notes are related to one another and what the function is in the chord.   To use your example, the e flat in a c minor chord is the third. When you have an e natural as an accidental, in that specific chord the third is shifted up a half-step. To transpose it into major, take the third of that same specific chord (in the new major key now) up a half step. So that e natural would turn into an f.   TL;DR If the accidental is a flat go down a half step. if the accidental is a sharp go up a half step"
nintendomusic,3dw8ut,BlueScapoop,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:35:01 2015 UTC,Thats what I figured the case would be. Thanks for the help!!
nintendomusic,3dw8ut,Splortabot,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:58:57 2015 UTC,"Okay you did a change of modes and no transposition.   For your problem, I'm not entirely sure either. I've never did a change of modes before and I believe a transposition from a minor to a major key would be easier in this case instead of going from the parallel minor to parallel major."
