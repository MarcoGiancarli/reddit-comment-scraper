Sure a few have been fine but not often great.  It also works the other way to some extent with really poor stories covering what is an extended training area.   Why not drop the price a bit and sell the SP and MP separately but properly."
Games,3dymu7,grey_hat_uk,275,Mon Jul 20 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"Human revolution was great as single player only. There are a few tweaks that need to be made obviously, but I think they found a good starting point and adding multiplayer would take away from that.  At the same time though there are games that were created with multiplayer as an afterthought like gears of war and their multiplayer ended up being great and really popular."
Games,3dymu7,ChedduhBob,160,Mon Jul 20 18:52:50 2015 UTC,"Another example is the oft-maligned ME3 Co-op multiplayer. Many people bemoaned that multiplayer was required (it basically was if you didn't play a perfect ME1-3) to get the best ending for the game, missing out on the fact that it was a fun, fast-paced, mechanically sound mode that was immensely satisfying. Further, the purchaseable random loot boxes (Spectre Packs, etc) paid for every piece of multiplayer DLC released after it, meaning that the community didn't fracture when more DLC characters, maps, and weapons were released. And by all accounts, it was an afterthought, tacked on at the end of the development cycle. Obviously it wasn't flawless (P2P hosting, slow progression, OP and UP characters, somewhat of a power creep, sync-kills) but what we were left with was some of the most fun co-op I've ever played. ME3's co-op is the sole reason I'm preordering (oh the dirty word) ME4."

Also, there are no hitscan weapons in Halo 1. Even the fastest bullets have travel time. I do not know whether this is true for Halo 2 onward, because I only ever made mods for Halo 1 PC singleplayer.  Because Halo is a console series that uses P2P connections instead of dedicated servers, Halo 2 onward uses a system to compensate for P2P lag, a system called ""painting."" What this means is that the game remembers the last part of a target your crosshair was on for a brief time, for several frames.  This basically means you can zip your crosshair past your target's head, pull the trigger about four or five frames later, and you will still score a headshot even if your reticule is no longer on your target's head.

Reach introduced hitscan, and didn't play 4, but I think they retained it as well.  I think the method you described was only really applicable for Halo 2, where the sniper sweep was in effect. If you look at footage in theater mode, especially in Reach, you can see shots homing in on targets (this is especially notable in Reach, where rockets noticeably homed in on ground targets). Perhaps that is also the case for the later games and they removed the sniper sweep."

The real draw was that if you did manage to beat waves 3, 6, and 10, you got paid. Some of the objectives were quite easy, some incredibly difficult, and it led to a bunch of replayability. It was more than simply a horde mode, and it had a defined ending, and that's what really kept me playing."
Games,3dymu7,_Bilas,6,Mon Jul 20 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"The draw is the large number of characters, powers, and builds that were available, and all the ways they interacted. There are a few classes that are just shoot from cover, but the vast majority have very different playstyles."

Before a patch halved the amount necessary to get full access to all the endings, it wasn't just that you had to play multiplayer, but that you needed to maintain a certain level of play in order to keep your score high enough. I think now it might be possible to skip it altogether, but it definitely sucked having to play multiplayer just to maintain some vaguely defined number in single player."

Games,3dymu7,snakesbbq,12,Mon Jul 20 20:30:23 2015 UTC,"It was unbelievably good in it's day and for the platform that it was on.  Back then there weren't a lot of games that even attempted a tacked on multiplayer mode and there were even fewer that included FPS multiplayer of any sort on consoles. It was really the only game in town if that's what you were looking for, and certainly it's novelty and captive audience carried it.  Honestly it just doesn't hold up that well today, and it's still not all that great compared to it's contemporaries.   Quake was already out by the time Goldeneye64 came out - if you looked to other platforms there was already a familiar and established set of standards for FPS multiplayer, the ones that would carry us into the age of arena shooters. Without Goldeneye64's captive audience with nowhere else to turn it likely would not have been well remembered."

Games,3dymu7,IrrelevantLeprechaun,0,Tue Jul 21 03:27:39 2015 UTC,"GoldenEye had a bunch of firsts -- the first shooter to support dual analogue controls, vehicles, and headshots, notably. Headshots really added another level to gameplay, I think. Not relevant to multiplayer, but GoldenEye was also the first shooter to make real efforts towards stealth -- guns had volume levels that would alert enemies within a given radius, and enemies reacted when you entered their eyeline, not when they were spawned or their room entered. There was a lot of innovative first-time stuff in the game, I don't think it's fair to say it wouldn't have been well-remembered without a captive audience.   It's worth noting that Quake released on the N64 a few months after GoldenEye, and that Quake 2 added features id admitted were inspired by GoldenEye (like mission objectives and blood/wound textures).  (Note: Team Fortress is often cited as the first game to have headshots, but it depends on how you count it. Team Fortress released earlier, but GoldenEye had been in production a long time and had demonstrated the feature before it was added to TF.)"

The single player campaign has a vastly different HUD than the multiplayer, and the grenades, while still having some of the same functions, operate very differently.  And if you want to play co-op, the mode for that (Zombies) is also very different and unique to both the single player campaign and multiplayer.

Gamers would no doubt benefit from being able to buy just the piece of a game they want (aka only sp/mp/zombies or choose freely)  and devs would probably benefit since they'd see what part of the game people like/is worth spending most on.

However, it was stupidly fun because it broke all of the rules of multiplayer shooters at the time.

Also didn't feel like bioshock at all to me with the ending and the story felt more sci fi than bioshock.  So any way I found that bioshock 2 was top 10 games ive ever played. So It makes me sad people just skip 2."

I'm thankful that the devs are not willing to tarnish and/or lessen the experience that they want their gamers to have by focusing and adding on a tacky multiplayer mode. It's a refreshing and pleasing announcement for me.   I enjoy my multiplayer games - do not get me wrong - but if it comes at the cost of the meat and bones of the experience they're really attempting to give me then I would rather not.  That said, a standalone fully idealized multiplayer Deus Ex game has the potential to be one of the greatest games ever developed. That sort of title deserves its solitary focus to be placed upon the multiplayer aspect. I hope that they end up making one. Just don't throw in a silly half hearted single player campaign - tutorials is more than enough (for me)."

I played it regularly when it was out.  It used the Unreal Engine so fan mods/levels eventually made it over. It had biotech augmentations and weapons designed to compliment each other. You had to choose between augs like cloak or thermal vision, speed vs damage reduction, etc. EMP grenades could drain your available energy.  The multiplayer was totally half-assed. And I loved it. I'd love another."

They mentioned Mass Effect 3, which is PvE waves like Mass Effect 2 right?  It would probably be best with custom missions though. The objective of most single player levels is just ""get to the other side"" so it would probably just end up as a race through the different branches if you put multiple people through the map. Or worse, one player messing up the other's stealth vibe."
Games,3dymu7,ChaosDent,7,Mon Jul 20 18:13:06 2015 UTC,"I think it's important to differentiate between ""multiplayer"" and ""co-op"" these days.  ME3 has co-op, but it's just horde mode... very similar to what Warhammer 40k: Space Marine had.  I haven't played it, myself, but I'm not really a huge fan of horde mode in games like that.  It's fun in TF2 or KF2, but those kind of games are kind of made for that.    Deus Ex needs a fully functional story mode that you can play with someone.  If it's an add-on campaign, like you suggested, that's fine.  Just don't make it seem like an afterthought.  Saints Row really got this right - you can play the ENTIRE game co-op with a friend.  I had some of the most fun playing games while working through that campaign with friends and sharing laughs and working together to accomplish things.  It's a really great way to share a gaming experience."
Games,3dymu7,theduderman,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:29:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure that the Saints Row method would really work that well with a game that's more story focused. SR has a story, but it's pretty weak and silly, more just there to sort of connect a whole series of individual pieces, rather than something that's actually meaningful.   Some stories are just more suited for co-op than others, and I don't think every game should feel the need to include co-op just because."
Games,3dymu7,shawnaroo,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:52 2015 UTC,"It totally could.  If they took a Dialog system like in SWTOR and tweaked it a bit, then made it so people could interact with NPCs independently of each other, it could creat a very unique but enthralling experience.  I would imagine that it would work kind of like a lot of my table top RPGs.  Players come up to an NPC and they all have their own motivaions for being there and the NPC interacts with the group differently based on who is there, how many show up, and what they say.  Maybe the guy is racist but they want to earn his trust so one guy covers the group or follows another lead while the rest try to bluff their way into some work.    If done right it could create some amazing moments, like if two players have opposing motivations and they end up killing each other or working against each other.  Basically you would take a tighter story focused game like Deus Ex or maybe Skyrim and open it up to like 4 players, and the players don't have to like each other they could totally end up on opposite sides of things."
Games,3dymu7,ztfreeman,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:55:42 2015 UTC,"I think that managing the story design for a project like that would be horrendously difficult. If you wanted to try, I imagine that it would basically take on a life of its own, and trying to integrate it with a single player campaign would be a nightmare.   I just think, if you want to make a single player game, then make a single player game. Don't let multiplayer concerns interfere with making the best single player game that you can. And vice-versa with a co-op or multiplayer game. Decide what you want your game to be, and then make that work. If you feel that your game needs to serve both, then you're really making two different games (that share a lot of artwork), so be prepared to do a bunch of extra work."
Games,3dymu7,shawnaroo,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:30:27 2015 UTC,"I guess if I didn't make the point clear enough, this kind of setup isn't new.  It is what goes down across a table (and now across cyberspace) all of the time in pen and paper role playing games.    Video games have a long history of lifting game mechanics from these kinds of RPGs, and the Bioware and Fallout social systems are examples of this already.  It wouldn't actually be reinvinting the wheel nearly as much as you would think, it would just be the technical work of building a game around it."
Games,3dymu7,ztfreeman,4,Tue Jul 21 13:58:00 2015 UTC,"Pen and Paper RPG's have an actual person running the game, capable of modifying the storyline as necessary on the fly in response to the players' actions. That makes all the difference.  The Fallout games ""social system"" can be pretty easily broken by the actions of a single player. It doesn't take long for you to do things in the game world that make the canned responses by the NPC's seem like nonsense. If you added in more players, you're only expanding and complicating the already huge range of possibilities, and making that problem worse.   Computers are not smart enough yet to respond realistically to arbitrary player actions, particularly within the confines of a storyline. In the fallout games, they've tried to make a flexible system and predict and program in responses for as many player actions as they could. It only kind of works sometimes, but it's not a particularly scalable system. It's just too easy to break, and the larger and more complex and more open your game world gets, the more it breaks. There's just too much that the players can and will do that you haven't accounted for."
Games,3dymu7,shawnaroo,2,Tue Jul 21 14:07:39 2015 UTC,"think it's important to differentiate between ""multiplayer"" and ""co-op""  these days.   I guess I'm ok with just using qualifiers, but I can see how just ""multiplayer"" can be interpreted as ""competitive, team-based multiplayer."" That seems to be the default, but the universe is a lot larger than just that against co-op. I would add Vs., asynchronous and asymmetric to the list of common qualifiers.   If it's an add-on campaign, like you suggested, that's fine.  Just don't make it seem like an afterthought.   It definitely sounds like they get that, given the quote in the title, ""it would have to be the topic of the game itself."" I'd go in for a multiplayer focused game, like a Left 4 Dead or Syndicate 2012 with the Deus Ex rules.   I don't disagree co-op campaigns can be fun, I played the Halo campaigns exclusively split-screen and had a blast. But Deus Ex feels more like Portal than Halo. You can balance Halo for co-op pretty easily because it is focused on combat arenas.  If you played the main Portal 2 game co-op you'd end up with the second player either useless or obviating the puzzles entirely."

Games,3dymu7,TENCHUGRANDMASTER,19,Tue Jul 21 01:01:21 2015 UTC,"I can buy their argument somewhat.   I'd say the bigger argument for keeping MP out is that combat and non-combat are twined together intricately - your successes in the combat sphere or the non-combat sphere effect each other in meaningful ways (you kill people and you lose the ability to take a moral high ground in a conversation encounter). In Mass Effect, conversation/choice is sort of its own separate module that doesn't really mix for the gameplay except as far as what squadmembers you can bring with you. Considering all this, you'd likely need to completely rethink the skill system, to a degree, to ensure the MP aspect was balanced. And that's completely leaving aside competitive."
Games,3dymu7,Dreadius,86,Mon Jul 20 17:14:09 2015 UTC,"I like your point about the greater skill diversity and integrated narrative consequences. One of my biggest complaints about Mass Effect 2 (the last one I played) was how disintegrated the ship stuff, the town hub stuff and the missions were. They were really like three separate games. Conversely I was impressed with how much Human Revolution sticks to the classic FPS-RPG formula. You have friendly characters in mission zones, mission zones blended into town hubs and conversations that can lead to fights.  I do think you could get away with minimal pruning of the skill tree though if you designed multiplayer levels as missions in the style of the single player game. All the upgrades in Human Revolution except the one social booster were directly applicable to the core loop of stealth, exploration and combat.  Due to stealth requiring kind of dumb AI it probably would be best as a cooperative game with some level of randomization like Left 4 Dead's AI."

I'd say there's potential there, but a lot of games since 2000 have stolen it's thunder with modifiable weapons and 'magic' or special abilities, they'd need to be very careful make it worthwhile and not lost in the crowd.  Tomb Raider (also Eidos) was the last game I remember that had a tacked on multiplayer, hopefully that taught Crystal the same lesson, and spend their effort where it's going to pay off, or that if they do want multiplayer they take the same attitude as Eidos Montreal (do it properly or don't bother)."

Your goal is either successfully stealing (or alterating) ata from their computers, stealing/sabotaging the prototype, or destroying the lab and all those involved with it. Or preventing it, of course. Plus there's ""Extracting"" key personnel as well.   It can be built a bit like singleplayer, with multiple ways to accomplish the goals. It'll only rarely devolve into shooting matches and even then that could be a diversion.   It'd be Co-op PvP at the same time. Of course, it could just be against bots and be Co-op.

Those were popular modes at the time, but given DE's combat mechanics there wasn't anything to recommend it over Quake 3 or Unreal Tournament. Even the gadget nonsense you could pull would just be better in Duke Nukem 3D.  I like the idea of fitting a proper multiplayer mode to the new Deus Ex mechanics. They are saying the right things by referencing Mass Effect and the ""themes"" of Deus Ex. That suggests a cooperative, mission based game, which could be really cool.

There are many SP only games I would love to bring in a 2nd person to wreck havoc with. Hell, for some games there are even people making mods to add multiplier and/or coop (Skyrim and Just Cause 2) because they (and others) want it so much. Especially open-world sandbox style games and other games just because why not. Fallout, Skyrim, GTA, Deus EX, Dead Space, MSG, Batman, Dead Rising, Far Cry, Red Faction: Armageddon, Just Cause, and S.T.A.L.K.E.R. are some off the top of my head. I've either already beat the game in SP and don't care about immersion/difficulty in COOP or the game itself is setup in such a fashion another player wouldn't affect much.

When Watchdogs was announced, it was shown off under the pretense that ""everything is connected"" and that included you to other players. Whether or not the final product succeded, I appreciate so much that the developers are only interested in introducing multiplayer if they can use it to drive home their entire package. That's VERY rare in this industry, as most games have a single player tacked on (Battlefield), the multiplayer tacked on (Tomb Raider) or two very distinct but separate modes (and games like this are great, like Call of Duty 4 and Halo, where both the SP and the MP are very strong and stand on their own. Rarely do we see multiplayer contextualize the single player, or vise versa. Dark Souls and Journey are great examples. The multiplayer in The Last of Us drives home the survival mentality, and the tension that the single player also wants you to go through (although it's similar to Halo in that it can mostly be seen as separate)."

Games,3dymu7,tyme,3,Tue Jul 21 02:54:28 2015 UTC,Demon's Souls changed the way I looked at Multiplayer games. Their online system actually made the 'single' player better.
Games,3dymu7,thaumogenesis,4,Tue Jul 21 09:21:58 2015 UTC,I respect that they don't want to divide their efforts. Best to have one great game than two subpar ones. Plus I feel like Multiplayer Deus Ex would just be like Crysis 3's multiplayer.
Games,3dymu7,magmasafe,5,Mon Jul 20 16:54:14 2015 UTC,"Is Mass Effect 3 really the best multiplayer to strive for? I mean, yes, ME3's multi was cool, but it had a negative effect on the single player experience, in my opinion.  (1) Perhaps if the resources spent on the MP were used on the single-player game instead, the game would have been more complete (e.g. a better ending where the choices you made throughout the game/series actually mattered, for example).  (2) The war table thing was cool, but it was kind of cruddy that you could only get it to a certain % by doing all the missions in the game, and had to play the multiplayer to get the % high enough to get a different ending. It's fine if a game has both single and multiplayer, but I really think that one should not effect the other.  So I like the thought of ""it would have to be the topic of the game itself,"" but ME3 seems like a strange example to use in that case."
Games,3dymu7,subterraneanbunnypig,2,Mon Jul 20 19:51:54 2015 UTC,"I loved ME 3's multiplayer, though I decried its addition before the game's release.  They claim the teams were separate and the MP didn't impact the single-player campaign's development.  I don't think I agree necessarily.  I'm of the opinion, like you, that you necessarily have fewer resources for the single player if you're also funding a multiplayer.  Even if those team members wouldn't have been on the single-player game, the funds used to house them might've been.  As much as I enjoyed the MP, I was letdown by the single-player.  Unfortunately, I think a lot of that was direction and conscious choice as opposed to cost-cutting.  I don't think the endings would've been more satisfying with more money.    Maybe the side-missions wouldn't have been almost entirely eavesdropping and fetch item bits?  From the ""making-of"" material though, it seemed like they made decisions that would fly against player-choice mattering early in the design process.  I think that's a more fundamental issue than merely funding.  You're also correct though, that the tie between MP and SP was awkward, and it isn't something I'd want to see replicated again... ever."
Games,3dymu7,Non_Causa_Pro_Causa,2,Mon Jul 20 20:27:09 2015 UTC,"(1) Perhaps if the resources spent on the MP were used on the single-player game instead, the game would have been more complete (e.g. a better ending where the choices you made throughout the game/series actually mattered, for example).   While I know plenty of people speculate on this, it just doesn't really have any evidence. ME3's multiplayer was developed by an entirely different team, and was originally being developed as a standalone first-person shooter. It was meant to be a totally separate game, and it had it's own budget. EA decided to consolidate and had it retooled into ME3 multiplayer, but it still had it's own unique oversight and budget.  Here's footage of the FPS before development was consolidated, for the sake of showing it."
Games,3dymu7,tibby_throwaway,3,Mon Jul 20 20:46:06 2015 UTC,"No, but it is an apt comparison, because both games are heavily story-driven and Deus Ex devs admire how Bioware managed to incorporate multiplayer into storytelling."

Games,3dyws2,Uniquitous,2,Tue Jul 21 12:39:16 2015 UTC,"They are probably switching back for clarity on console games. When you play an EA game on PS4 you aren't interacting with anything that looks like Origin, the PC download service, even if you are behind the scenes.  Part of me hopes that this is the first step in an effort to bring EA games back to Steam, but I know that's probably not realistic."
Games,3dyws2,ChaosDent,3,Mon Jul 20 19:29:35 2015 UTC,"Part of me hopes that this is the first step in an effort to bring EA games back to Steam, but I know that's probably not realistic.   The numbers simply don't make sense anymore for EA to do that; while more hardcore gamers may disagree, EA doesn't lose enough sales by not having a game on Steam to justify giving up the 30% cut that Valve takes from Steam and relinquishing control of the extra content sold in game. Having Steam take 30% cuts from Ultimate Team alone would probably be lunacy for EA."
Games,3dyws2,snozberrydriveby,5,Mon Jul 20 23:26:33 2015 UTC,"It's probably more like they recently had some leadership change and that new person is making his mark with useless changes. Oh, corporate life."
Games,3dyws2,antihexe,5,Tue Jul 21 01:48:34 2015 UTC,EA should put older titles onto Steam. Games like Mass Effect 3 would garner a ton of sales on Steam. I own it on Origin/EA client but I'd love it in my Steam library. At this point in the product's life cycle they'd be making money rather than losing it to Valve.
Games,3dyws2,Steamified,2,Mon Jul 20 23:50:31 2015 UTC,"That would probably cannibalize their EA Access stuff and their Origin On The House, but still sounds like a pretty good idea."

Games,3dyws2,becauseimdumb,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:15:45 2015 UTC,"They do, don't they?  The Sims 3 is on Steam."
Games,3dyws2,Xsythe,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:09:14 2015 UTC,IIRC The Sims 3 came out before EA stopped putting games on Steam. Mass Effect 3 came out after EA decided that from then on they would only release on Origin.
Games,3dyws2,IronicTitanium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:57:08 2015 UTC,EA should put older titles onto Steam.   I was agreeing with that.
Games,3dyws2,Xsythe,4,Tue Jul 21 02:17:44 2015 UTC,"/u/IronicTitanium is correct. Once they decided that Origin would be the only platform that they would release their new release games on they stopped adding games to Steam. For example, Mass Effect 3 and DA2 are not on Steam and they are older games.  I argue that games that are 2+ years of age that are not already on Steam would have reached a low enough sales volume where the benefits of being on Steam outweigh the negatives. The likelihood is that those who were going to buy, for example, Mass Effect 3 on Origin have already done so. However, if you present that title on the Steam library you'll find that Steam only enthusiasts, collectors, etc. would ultimately purchase the game - even if it means that they have a second (or more) copy in their collective gaming libraries.  Another option for EA would be to have their older games added to GOG. Now, I'm not aware of the cut that GOG takes on games but none of the Mass Effect games are available on GOG (or their Galaxy client). It's just another avenue for their games.   I understand the reasoning why they pushed people to their client. However, their client now has a firm position within the PC gaming market. Having their games on other platforms is not going to endanger their client. Current gamers who are welcoming of the Origin client are highly likely to already have it."
Games,3dyws2,Steamified,3,Tue Jul 21 02:33:16 2015 UTC,"EA doesn't seem like the type to go DRM-free to me. I'd be surprised if they released on GOG.   Steam makes sense to me. At this point anyone who hasn't already gotten ME3 on Origin that wants to play ME3 is probably someone who refuses to use Origin. While I personally don't have any issues with Origin and think it's even superior to Steam in a few aspects, I'm not a huge fan of EA and I'm not surprised people are reluctant to use Origin. At this stage the only other people who wouldn't already have ME3 are people who haven't gotten into the series yet or are still playing ME1 or ME2. This actually includes me since while I own Mass Effect 1 & 2 on both Steam and Origin, they're both a part of my infinite backlog.   That said, EA would probably still profit more from people loyal to Steam than they'd lose from people new to Mass Effect. So I think it would be smart for them to release on Steam now.   Same logic applies to other EA games from around that time such as BF3."
Games,3dyws2,IronicTitanium,2,Tue Jul 21 08:18:08 2015 UTC,EA doesn't seem like the type to go DRM-free to me. I'd be surprised if they released on GOG.   While I agree with that there are some very much older EA-owned games that are on GOG.
Games,3dyws2,Steamified,2,Tue Jul 21 08:55:59 2015 UTC,I actually didn't know that. That said I still can't imagine EA would be eager to release even relatively older games like The Sims 3 DRM-free. But I guess anything could happen. Most of GOG is older games and that's the extent most modern AAA publishers are willing to go. Most of them haven't quite warmed up to the idea of DRM-free yet.
Games,3dyws2,IronicTitanium,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:01:31 2015 UTC,"I agree, but EA being EA its probably not going to happen.  I personally refuse to use Origin and I am still annoyed that I must use Steam, but I would like it if I could actually play the Dragon Age series someday."

Games,3dyws2,bicameral_mind,66,Tue Jul 21 10:27:54 2015 UTC,"I think it's because Origin is more associated with PC. So if someone is on an Xbox or Playstation and the game says to login to your Origin account, it could confuse them."

I feel like for a platform like Steam/Origin, you need to your own brand for the platform, so people don't think its just for valve games, or just for EA games.  But then again, Origin is pretty much used for just EA games in most cases. I mean, most of those non-EA games just go to Steam anyway. So maybe they've accepted that their platform is just for their games."

Games,3dyws2,knight666,2,Tue Jul 21 05:16:18 2015 UTC,"Think of a game as a giant lumbering machine. It has a billion moving parts, it's covered in oil and it makes a lot of noise. Text localization is one of the cogs in the machine. It's very complicated as it influences many other parts of the machine. While the machine is running, that's fine. If something breaks, there's an engineer standing by to fix it, usually with some ""percussive maintenance"".  After the game is printed to disc and the obligatory patches and DLC are out, the machine is most likely turned off. It won't be thrown away, because a lot of money went into building it, it just won't be used anymore.  Over time, grease will dry up, cogs will rust and hydraulic tubes will spring leaks. Turning the machine back on is not impossible, it just becomes more and more expensive.  In software engineering, we face a similar problem: code rot. We build our games in programming languages on top of software that runs on operating systems and that ecosystem will change over time. And while valiant attempts are made to preserve software ecosystems, stuff will break over time. After the machine has been turned off for too long, you'll find that it has become rather difficult to recreate the exact environment required to operate it successfully.  Now, in the case of a recent game like Dragon Age: Origins or Dead Space 2, I don't think there will be much of a problem. But there's a chance, however slim, that a simple recompile of the exact same game code with a newer compiler introduces issues so subtle that it would take weeks of their best engineers to figure out. As a game company, are you willing to take that risk? I can see the Kotaku headline now: ""Game Company botches update, breaks game for millions of costumers"""
Games,3dyws2,greyfoxv1,8,Tue Jul 21 13:36:44 2015 UTC,"That would be disappointing if that was the case since their service is great so far.

Games,3dyws2,Bristlerider,37,Tue Jul 21 14:46:10 2015 UTC,EA probably accepts that Origin will never take off and be a new Steam.  Dropping the name at least for the accounts basically makes it very unlikely that other developers and publishers will ever use it.

We're losing out on $Y from lost sales of people who refuse to stray from Steam (or are simply less buy-happer for Origin games). But we gain $Z by controlling our own store and platform. And we gain no profits, but it is beneficial as a company, to run our own platform and maintain 100% control. There is potential profits to be made there.

I love the Uncharted demos because things don't go the way they should, and that to me goes a long way to prove Naughty Dog wants to show that it's a game, things aren't always polished and pre-recorded, and they built a lot of trust with me in that demo for a stupid glitch.  The Mic Trick comes off as total bullshit, and it's easy to see through, which is funny because you'd think the ups at Ubi might recognize that it's not having the intended effect."

Games,3dyy1j,pdog8000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:20:14 2015 UTC,"Wow. So, after the first, ridiculously chatty and corny demo was shown, I pretty much asked precisely for this video, which is roughly the same thing, but with somebody giving us context as to what's going on and explaining what we're looking at and how the game works, and none of that stupid chatter between ""players."" Thanks so much for sharing this."
Games,3dyy1j,HireALLTheThings,94,Tue Jul 21 14:32:13 2015 UTC,"I laughed pretty hard when ""Drops of Jupiter"" started playing over the mic, haha. After playing some GTA Online lately, that was a pretty accurate (if somewhat caricatured) depiction of typical mic chatter. The guy bitching, the other guy screaming, and then some guy with music playing that sounds like it's coming through a tin can with string. Thank god for toggle mute.   That said, is the ""Mic Trick"" really so insidious? It seems to me that it isn't so much a sales gimmick as it is a reflection of the experience the game developer wants players to have. And the Mic Trick isn't the only artificial part of game demos either: the technical/graphical laundry list aside, demos usually feature player movement/behavior that looks nothing like how regular players behave. There's usually very little strafing, and all moves are very methodical as if they are choreographed (and they most likely are). It's like watching someone drive around in GTA obeying all the traffic rules...you know that someone out there might play that way 100% of the time, but for the majority of us that sort of methodical gameplay lasts for an hour, tops. Outside of ARMA (which to be fair is a simulator), I've never seen typical player behavior during gameplay be as ""realistic"" as what they portray in demos. It's like every FPS dev wants their players to pretend their game is Zero Dark Thirty, but in reality it will be played just like Quake."
Games,3dyy1j,iNarr,21,Mon Jul 20 19:02:13 2015 UTC,"That said, is the ""Mic Trick"" really so insidious? It seems to me that it isn't so much a sales gimmick as it is a reflection of the experience the game developer wants players to have.   Yes, because in this case the dialogue they want the players to have is recorded after the fact and optimized for the video they are showing to create the desired narrative that the demo shows. What you have, as an actual player, is real time and even if you and your buddies take it seriously it won't the the forced narrative.   It's the difference between the burger in the ad and the real burger. One is perfected to look good without consideration for reality."
Games,3dyy1j,flybypost,31,Mon Jul 20 20:59:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, but again, is that insidious? Is this tactic being used to consciously deceive consumers so as to bolster sales?  Sure, it's misleading. No one is talking like that over comms, except maybe for guys like this, and the developers surely know that. But I'm not convinced that devs are using this ""Mic Trick"" to sell gamers an experience that they have no intention of providing. They give us the tools, and it's up to the community to use those tools (e.g. mic channels) as they see fit. It's not really their fault that their demographic isn't primarily made up of marines.   I guess what I'm saying is that, whilst the ""Mic Trick"" is a bit cringey and misleading of the gameplay you're likely to experience, it should be expected in a promotional video. I'd really rather not watch E3 demos with players jumping around and teabagging others, screaming through their mics, and so on. And I don't hold it against the developer for choosing not to portray their product in that light; as far as I'm concerned, they should show me the best experience I am capable of having using their product (so long as what they're showing isn't deceptive of the final product in regards to graphics, gameplay features, etc.). Glass half full, and all that."
Games,3dyy1j,iNarr,14,Mon Jul 20 21:28:23 2015 UTC,"I think in general it is disingenuous to intentionally mislead in advertising material anyway, and this is merely another means to that end. A lot of gamers would more likely rather see in engine examples from the actual game, as opposed to scripted settings and vertical slices. Instead we have to constantly walk on eggshells, trying to discern fake from real."
Games,3dyy1j,Fawful,17,Mon Jul 20 22:43:12 2015 UTC,"I see what you mean, but I guess I just think this is less of an issue. Getting a bunch of people to play make-believe Seal Team 6 isn't as bad as, say, the use of bullshots or cinematically enhanced gameplay sequences that aren't representative of the final game. The latter is purposively deceptive, but the former is more in line with known marketing tactics. I see it as being on the same level as kids getting way to enthusiastic in toy commercials...their enthusiasm doesn't really misrepresent the product or its function, but it probably doesn't portray the average kid's reaction to it. It's a best case scenario, really, and somewhat realistic even if it is corny as hell.     The so-called ""Mic Trick"" is definitely cringey, but I think its a relatively minor issue in the grander scheme of things."
Games,3dyy1j,iNarr,8,Mon Jul 20 22:56:35 2015 UTC,"Instead we have to constantly walk on eggshells, trying to discern fake from real.   Are you a newborn foal? You can't discern when an E3 presentation is obviously choreographed to market a product? If you want actual gameplay, it's as easy as waiting till release and watching a match on youtube. I, for one, quite enjoy the whole E3 trailer shit. It's shows me what the devs are aiming for, what they want to create. Anyone with an ounce of critical thinking can look at an E3 trailer and determine what will realistically be represented in the game or what won't. And for all other things, there's youtube. We live in the information era. If you can't find information, you're not looking hard enough. Worse comes to worse, you just don't buy the game."
Games,3dyy1j,Fyrus,10,Mon Jul 20 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"Aliens Colonial Marines was truly easy to see through.  Wait, didn't a shitload of people buy it then realise they were had?   My point is we should not have to make this discerning. What is shown should be more truthful. Vilifying these tactics and the people who peddle them is a good first step."
Games,3dyy1j,Fawful,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:13 2015 UTC,"Well technically Aliens: Colonial Marines' advertising wasn't easy to see through, which was kind of the point of the outcry. A lot of people felt duped by Gearbox because the final game looked nothing like their advertising, and the advertising looked pretty good.   And seeking to ""vilify"" anyone is way out of proportion here. These guys aren't villains because they used phony marine talk in their gameplay demos."
Games,3dyy1j,iNarr,3,Tue Jul 21 00:06:26 2015 UTC,"Yes, but again, is that insidious? Is this tactic being used to consciously deceive consumers so as to bolster sales?   Well, yes, that's exactly what that tactic is used for, at least originally. We're just so used to it after so many decades that it has little effect on us. Maybe the mic trick will follow the same path, but in the meantime it is deceptive and not representative of actual gameplay."
Games,3dyy1j,Psychotrip,5,Mon Jul 20 22:47:07 2015 UTC,"but in the meantime it is deceptive and not representative of actual gameplay.   Sorry to push you on this, but how? The developer really has no way of knowing what its community will behave like. There's a reason why they say stuff like ""Online experiences not rated by the ERSB"" on the box. If you sought out such an experience, I'm sure you could find it. I agree that hopping into general matchmaking it's probably not what you're going to find, but again, this is the game as the developer hopes you will play it. All the tools are there to play the game as they depict it, it's just up to the community as to whether they want to play that way or not.   Quick annecdote: way back when Halo 2 was still around (haven't played MCC), I lucked out and got in with a clan that was full of a bunch of marines. When I'd play with those guys, they'd get pretty into the whole mic chatter thing and speak in a way that wasn't altogether dissimilar from what you see in these promo videos. I haven't played with a group like that since (which says a lot, seeing as it's been over a decade and dozens of FPS games later), but it definitely affects how I view this issue. So it's rare, but you can find experiences like that. And I don't personally hold it against the developer for trying to put their product in the best light possible."
Games,3dyy1j,iNarr,8,Mon Jul 20 23:07:36 2015 UTC,"The developer really has no way of knowing what its community will behave like.    Exactly my thoughts. Ubi won't do anything to prevent or disable or hinder your ability to have that exact same experience as they showed on stage... so how is it misleading?  It's not up to them to decide who plays their game, and how. That's up to the community. And you can easily go online and find people who want to play it a little more seriously and actively communicate with their mics. If you are too lazy to do so... that isn't Ubi's fault."
Games,3dyy1j,JudgeJBS,12,Mon Jul 20 23:40:58 2015 UTC,"Yep. A bit bizarre when you extend the same logic beyond games.    Table maker with an ad of a family eating thanksgiving dinner around one of his tables. Outcry: ""But my thanksgiving dinners never look like that! I've never even seen yams my whole life...it's obvious to me that a chef prepared this food. And it seats up to 12 family members?? Counting grandma, grandpa, and cousin Larry, I only have 7 total! Whatever happened to truth in advertising?""    Bit of a shitty analogy, but the point being that the table serves it's function either way. I don't go blaming the developer because I don't have marine corps friends, and I don't go blaming my table manufacturer because I don't have a michelin star chef to put food on my table. So long as the product works as advertised (in this case, comm channels support as many people speaking as is shown in demos), the end-user experience is ultimately up to me."

But if you and 4 of your buddies all had studio-grade mics, you Could have this experience. Ubi would have done, and has done, and will never do anything to prevent you from having that experience.   If the community is full of obnoxious children, that isn't Ubisofts doing. If you choose to play with randoms in solo q and don't use the mic yourself... again, that's your doing and you are setting yourself up to have whatever experience you get.

I believe there's too reasons why I first thought it might be NPCs communicating with the player int eh Rainbow Six Demo: 1. How cleaned up the communication was and how unauthentic of a representation of 'real people' communicating it was. 2. Because a feature where NPCs communicate in a precise, military way would actually be rather innovative and something worth focusing a trailer on. Aside from the Gadgets shown and the destruction there really wasn't a whole lot interesting about the trailer apart from that. By the way I also thought that this might be a heavily scripted scenario and not some kind of 'free mode'. It also didn't take me long until I realised what was actually going on. So for me the mic trick was more confusing than anything, but had I not realised my mistake I would have probably been more impressed by the trailer than I am now."
Games,3dyy1j,p5yChm1,4,Mon Jul 20 19:13:36 2015 UTC,"How cleaned up the communication was and how unauthentic of a representation of 'real people' communicating it was.   Yeah this is the big beef. It just doesn't sound like real people so it feels forced and scripted in the same way NPC dialogue often does.  They also put these processing effects on them which I think confuses the issue. Sure they are probably trying to make it sound like it's coming from a cheesey little headset mic, but to me it makes it sound like it's part of the game audio."
Games,3dyy1j,shadowofashadow,5,Mon Jul 20 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think the publishers are trying to deliberatly mislead people with it, but they misrepresent the game and render the trailer useless. It really doesn't help anyone."
Games,3dyy1j,p5yChm1,3,Mon Jul 20 21:51:02 2015 UTC,"The first Division demo last year had me confused for the first minute or so.  Until I realized that the dialog was supposed to be player mics, I actually thought it was a pretty cool and interesting choice- having these post-apocolyptic soldiers sound casual and collected, as though they'd been through so much horror and violence that they'd stopped caring."
Games,3dyy1j,artifex0,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:26 2015 UTC,"I watched these trailers on a live stream and noticed multiple comments of people wondering why the voice acting for the characters was so bad throughout the demo.  So sadly, yes."
Games,3dyy1j,MyCoolWhiteLies,155,Mon Jul 20 22:55:45 2015 UTC,Yeah that's new to me too. It felt obvious that it was supposed to be gamer VOIP. Just really cleaned up.
Games,3dyy1j,magmasafe,28,Mon Jul 20 18:59:02 2015 UTC,"On The Division trailer, to player audio is clearly balanced in a way that typical in-game 'comms' audio is. I was confused, and actually quite impressed at the dynamic dialogue before I figured out it was supposed to be player audio. The Rainbow Six trailer was a lot easier to understand."
Games,3dyy1j,captainbuttercream,37,Tue Jul 21 18:03:11 2015 UTC,"Meh, I don't think the ""Mic Trick"" is that bad, it's just cringy as hell and sounds like what it is, a Corporate watered down version of what they think in-game chat sounds like.   It's a dumb trend but I felt Jim was trying to stretch that out to a full episode and I don't see that as a big deal."
Games,3dyy1j,Lightguardianjack,15,Mon Jul 20 18:27:52 2015 UTC,"When you play with randoms you get shit over the audio chat, but when you play with a team you can get communication that's much better than the mic trick track."

There are layers of complexity that go above and beyond the average game but for the vast majority of players it's not that difficult to pick up. The issue (as I see it and is common with any MMO) is finding the right group of players that you connect with in a meaningful way because more often than not that's what will keep you going and endeavouring to be better."

This is extremely key in EVE.  IMO more so than any other MMO.  In something like WoW you can pick up the game and get to leveling solo, and you'll probably have a hell of a lot of fun doing it.  If you try to play EVE solo from the start you either need to be very self driven or the more likely outcome you'll get bored and quit."

Games,3dyy1j,Stanjoly2,5,Mon Jul 20 19:51:25 2015 UTC,"To call this ""a trick"" is actually a joke. Who actually thinks that this is NPC talk in a multiplayer-only game? It is obvious advertisement, they try to create an atmosphere of immersion, tension and cooperation in a coop game.   Anyone who pubbed even for one game in a voice-chat game knows how it is.  Now, one thing i don't get is people calling it cringe-worthy. Obviously no one talks like this, but in the absolute core this is how multiplayer talk works. If you strip away all the banter, ""strong language"" and ""ingame talk"", this is how people cooperate in gaming. It's just, that for the sake of immersion and presantion i guess, they going hard on the professional/military talk.  I mean this is how you play counterstrike. ""2 guys going B, i legged one, one awping middle to the left, let's just split b and fuck em up, so far they have been sucking dick on B. Ready to smoke? Smoking now, popflash me out of catas. One plateu, one at car. Okay, got'em, plant default and smoke doors"". This is basically the rainbow six video, it is just that those companies want to present it more professional, want to create a different atmosphere and want it to be more accesible. Honestly understandable imho. Really not a big deal and i don't understand the fuss about this at all (both that this is a marketing trick aswell as this being cringey)."

Some of us have time to analyze these trailers, even in a cursory sense, and understand that most of those voices won't be in the game. Most of us do not have that time, and most of us still don't realize that the industry is fond of exaggerating what its games are capable of. Scripted trailers can look very similar to demos to people who aren't used to them, thus they give the appearance of in-game content rather than mic tricks or downgraded graphics."
Games,3dyy1j,Rekthor,2,Mon Jul 20 20:31:25 2015 UTC,"""The following sequence is pre-alpha footage captured from a multiplayer match"". Then you see players loading into the game and little mics appearing next to their names and while they talk they CLEARLY break the 4th wall.   I think you're trapped in your own bubble of hardcore gaming   Nah, i am just assuming people can read and have played a video game before.  I mean, if you don't get that those are supposed to be player voices then it is even bad for the company, because the advertisement completely failed. They don't want you to think this is NPC talk, they want you to think that this is how multiplayer game will look like (at their best). They want to show how much cooperation and tactic is involved.

Usually, the average consumer may have an Xbox One or a PS4 as a gift, or may just get one because one of their good friends (Who happens to be a gamer, hardcore or not) has one, and wants to play with them. These people don't know anything that we've become associated with like a second language, and if they have, it's usually been caught secondhand off of a friend, because of bandwagoning. (I.E CoD/BF sucks, Minecraft's for kids, etc.) Once they start looking around for games and see these kinda of trailers online, that's what they start to expect.  These trailers aren't made for us. These trailers are made for the casual gamers that don't go into video game purchases, and research them. It's one of the reasons GotY editions exist for shitty games.

If these were professional players, they wouldn't cheer for killing some random low-level character. That's another layer that makes it cringeworthy. They act all professional, as if they played the game for months, yet seem to be struggling with basic stuff.  Like when they entered the building in the Rainbow Six footage all of the cheered as if the mission was already complete. Ridiculous.  Or the footage from Division:  ""Everybody ready?"" ""Yeah let's see some teamwork."" ""Uh, hold up, behind us uh- other players!"" ""Bastards!""  It's just poor acting. Nobody talks like that. It's simply not good enough. If they wanted to be actually immersive they would've tried to sound more like an actual military force. When I play games like Battlefield for example, I say things like ""oscar mike"" ""11 o' clock"" and ""contact""."

No it really is not. Making cheeseburgers that appear to be worse than on the picture is comparable with graphical downgrades. In this case that is borderline false advertisement and the company is not delivering the promised product.  However, with the scripted conversation it is different, because in the end the company has no control how the community will use this feature. They are delivering the voice-over chat like promised, but they have no influence how the players will use it or how shitty their mics will be.   Now, of course pretty much everyone, the company included, knows that this won't be how it will play out in reality, but they have no influence on that.  i think that is a small but important and noteworthy difference."
Games,3dyy1j,Coldara,2,Mon Jul 20 21:27:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure you fixated on the wrong part of that.  If it makes you feel better, think of it like a skype commercial or that god awful capital one commercial where the douchey guy on his way to a job interview keeps transferring money via phone call and saying ""perfecto"". It is advertising and it is how they envision you using a product, but it also is clearly not how it is going to.   Maybe the little british kid says he wants to use Skype to talk to his grandpa, but we all know he is REALLY planning on getting a snorkel and some lunchmeat and preparing to pay a random russian woman money to do god only knows what. The douchey job applicant is really just going to say ""Alright, cool. Remind me to pay you later"". And so forth.  The product is the mechanism with which to do stuff, and they delivver.

Maybe they used american cheese instead of cheese, maybe the retail version has half the shaders turned off, and maybe Gavin's grandpa keeps saying ""What?"" instead of talking. Again, it is the dream/ideal case versus reality  Also, to be fair, the two pictures you showed are FAR from the worst examples, and the latter could easily just be the former after moving it around in transit. Completely irrelavent, but just a nitpick. Much better examples are like when people got taco bell waffle tacos and left them out for eight hours before taking pictures to say Taco Hell is bad."

I don't love the way they're doing this with phoney sounding players in these games, but also, do we want the game to show realistic voice chat in our controlled demos?   Jim dubbed over the Division gameplay with more realistic versions of voice chat and was it better that it was more realistic? Game devs want to show off their new game, why would they put screaming teenagers and an guy breathing heavily into the mic and eating chips? Or just put no audio, which wouldn't make it clear that you can voice chat at all?   They have to do something and obviously they don't want to make their game look bad, so you get these clearly recorded dialogues during gameplay. It isn't that harmful."
Games,3dyy1j,versusgorilla,12,Tue Jul 21 14:37:31 2015 UTC,"I completely disagree with Sterling as to the point of these things.  They're not meant to be manipulative, and I didn't think it was possible to confuse that dialogue for in-game NPC chatter.  I've played tactical shooters like Rainbow Six co-op with friends, and we're absolutely doing countdowns to simultaneous shots and such.  The reason why they're really scripted and cheesy is because they want to cover as many mechanics as possible in a ""vertical slice"", whereas in an average play session, there will be mechanics or scenarios that you'll never see, because players may have chosen one strategy versus another.  A demo that scripted can be used to show all of them.  Sure, it could all be done with narration instead, and people won't complain about how cheesy it is, but you get a much denser video this way.  More information conveyed in less time."
Games,3dyy1j,gamelord12,3,Mon Jul 20 18:29:32 2015 UTC,"This is my opinion as well. If they're gonna show off gameplay, they should at least show you how to win at it, just as iPhone commercials show off not just the features, but how to use them as well. And to Ubisoft's credit, their gameplay trailers seem to accomplish exactly that, it makes sense that the player is winning because they're using the proper tactics to win(even if they appear to be playing at a professional level), rather than..."
Games,3dyy1j,8-bit_d-boy,2,Mon Jul 20 18:44:20 2015 UTC,"They are manipulative, but not in a bad way. These advertisements are priming their audience for the way these games are intended to be played. The ONLY WAY games like The Division and Rainbow Six are going to be an enjoyable experience are with a tight group that is organized and plays tactically. This isn't Call of Duty/Battlefield deathmatch where anything goes, you're probably not going to be enjoying these games with random pubs either. These commercials show the developers vision of the kind of seriousness expected from the players, I don't find anything wrong with that. Anyone that has played Eve Online or an organized Arma game knows what I'm talking about.

This is a subreddit filled with mostly hardcore gamers: that's three qualifiers already, and is akin to claiming that ""Sharks do not exist because I live in Saskatchewan, and there are none here"". Meanwhile, I'd be willing to bet that the average person who watches E3 is a casual buyer, offset by the hardcores and extreme casuals on either side of them. Not everyone has the time or observational skills necessary to see that these are exaggerations; they just see a trailer and say ""cool"" or ""not interested"" before moving on. It's those players that the mic trick is aimed at."
Games,3dyy1j,Rekthor,4,Mon Jul 20 20:34:41 2015 UTC,"Interestingly, I found that the mic trick had the opposite effect on me. By now, I am well aware of what your average multiplayer lobby group is going to sound like in game, even if its a group of friends, so the moment the dialogue started, I was immediately ""taken out"" of the trailer.   I agree on most of the other points, it is annoying, and cringeworthy, and used to make the game look more dynamic and polished than it may actually be. And yet, the sheer ""professionalism"" in the scripting is what made it so very unbelievable for me. It doesn't feel like authentic dialogue between a group of close friends, the type of dialogue that I imagine everyone who plays multiplayer games is well aware of. And it's that flaw that ruined any so called ""insidious"" or ""subconscious"" effect it may have had on me."
Games,3dyy1j,eveninglion,2,Mon Jul 20 18:26:49 2015 UTC,I thought that what he was saying was that it gives the impression that the dialogue is part of the game world and the characters talking are NPCs.

I don't think anyone (and if they did, it's their fault) interprets the ""mic trick"" as NPC talk. It's clearly showing interaction between the players.   Now, it is pretty much impossible to find a group like that even when you filter down your friends list and hunt people down to play with, and it probably happens less in random lobbies than shark attacks. No one talks like that in games, and if they do, they get drowned out by some kid yelling at his brother and bumping Eminem music. But I don't see that as a ""fault"" or as ""trickery"" by Ubisoft or whoever uses the ""Mic Trick"". It isn't Ubi that makes kids ruin online chat, it's the kid themselves. If you can get 4 other buddies together to play those games and speak intelligently and calmly, well, then you can have that experience and Ubi has done everything they can to give it to you.

Zoom through as fast as they can, speaking in game-code and hitting only the necessary checkpoints and objectives.   This is the shit that ruins game experiences though, especially multiplayer experiences. There's not much that can be done about it but the game devs don't have an obligation to show what their game looks like when it's played by assholes.

If someone were to buy that game and complain that the dialogue they had with their friends wasn't as good as the demo and it completely ruined their experience, I would be tempted to call that person an idiot.

In a more general sense is the Skywind overhaul purely graphical? Or does it have gameplay overhauls as well in an attempt to modernize an old classic? I like the old school dice roll fighting, so I hope it's just a graphical overhaul.  Curious because I've seen a few things here and there about Skywind over the past few years, and it's something I would really like. I enjoy Morrowind (about 40 hours on Steam), but I can't help being turned off by its ugliness."
Games,3dwkmu,wlesnia1,70,Mon Jul 20 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"It is both Graphical and Gameplay. We cannot change the way skyrim does combat without mixing up an enormous amount of the underlying systems for skyrim, So combat will largely stay as it is in Skyrim. However we will be adding our own systems for things such as blocking and Necromancy (Both of those are completed and have been discussed publicly, however I cannot talk about any more of the changes as we like  them to be a surprise)  Graphically, We have replaced almost every single morrowind asset, and the total 'new model' count is up over 2500-3000.

When I first played it years and years ago, and took those first steps out of Seyda Neen to the hill where the Silt Strider is, I was completely blown away. I'd never before played a game of that scope before, and for the first time, I felt completely lost due to the sheer size of the world. I could go anywhere, do anything.

Games,3dwkmu,just__meh,29,Mon Jul 20 21:09:38 2015 UTC,"As an avid fan of Morrowind (literally 1000s of hours put into the game) I have a few concerns. These largely have to do with the spell mechanics and immersion.  Will you be able to enchant items with dispel in order to make use the Boots of Blinding Speed? The freedom to do whatever the hell you want when it comes to enchanting is part of what makes the game.  Are the schools of magic returned to what they were in the original game? This seems like a necessity in order to keep the Secret Masters intact.  Are we getting Jump and Levitate back? Levitate is one of the defining spells of the game and a mage without it is no mage at all.  Will Mark//Recall be in the game along with Divine and Almsivi Intervention? These along with the Silt Striders, Boats, Mage Travel, and Propylon Tubes made the game far more immersive in comparison to clicking somewhere on the map and teleporting there.  How does the lockpicking work? From a roleplaying perspective your abilities to disarm traps and pick locks ought to be your character's skill not your own.  Are the enemies scaled old-school or Skyrim style? Having everything scaled to where you can beat it at your current level is a huge turn-off RP wise.  Are enemies made harder in order to make up for the lack of hit chance in the game? This should be fairly obvious.  Will we have the diversity of dialogue options offered by the original game? The wiki system can go, but walking up to a person in the wild and not being able to ask them about anything is one of the worst parts about Skyrim and Oblivion.  Are quests ""chase the arrow"" mindlessness like they are in Skyrim or will we have to use our knowledge about the world and the directions in our journal to find objectives? Immersion, immersion, immersion."
Games,3dwkmu,thelastoneusaw,16,Mon Jul 20 14:50:26 2015 UTC,Aren't there specific aspects of Morrowind that require levitate (i.e. getting to the ministry in Vivec)?

Games,3dwkmu,Pluvialis,380,Mon Jul 20 16:42:46 2015 UTC,"Oblivion was my first Elder Scrolls game, so understandably the first few minutes of this video brought back a flood of memories. Even with the rightful complaint that the mod isn't fully fleshed out, the sound and look of Cyrodiil's open forests and their ephemeral tranquility is something I'll never forget, and something I'm ecstatic to see is getting a graphical update. In all honesty this makes me want to go back and play the game, even without any graphical enhancements.  There's a certain charm to Oblivion (and to Morrowind as well) in the floaty combat and at times hilarious NPC AI and character models that gets me so damn excited to play for hours on end. The atmosphere and world-building here is so damn strong, and it's why I have hundreds of hours logged in the vanilla game.  If you're wandering into this thread and haven't yet played an Elder Scrolls game for some reason, do it, you won't regret it.  edit: Also the game is worth sinking time into if only to experience the amazing Shivering Isles expansion!

I guess what really sells me is that it is it's own, fully fleshed out game. It is the size of some smaller games, with the humour and depth I have yet to see again in another Bethesda game.  On the humour side, there is a man who was executed for heinous crime of attempting to grow a beard. You find his body more or less randomly on a small platform overt hedge of a cliff. And depth wise, they successfully created an insane god, who was at the same time funny and incredibly scary. There isn't many games or even moves/shows that do that."

I can remember the layout of every single Bethesda city, and even many interior locations, but I cannot remember the people in them. I remember the all the castles of Skyrim, but the Jarls who inhabit them are a blur to me.  If only there could be some unholy union between Bioware, Bethesda, and Obsidian.

I know I have the bias of nostalgia as it was my first time playing a game with the depth of world and content that Oblivion had, but dammit I love this game, and the Shivering Isles expansion was icing on a cake that in my teenage eyes was already perfect.   It's amazing how easily I was able to look past the shoddy elements of the game (and those potato-faced NPCs) but once I did the game world had me by a hook, and it kept me there for a good many hours. I put around the same amount of time into Skyrim, but it never gripped me the way Oblivion or Morrowind, which is a very common experience on r/games"

Why do some beings seem reluctant to help? Why have the gods not intervened?  Who is Dagoth Ur and why is he a problem?

And so he sent Molag Bal tumbling into the crack of the biters and swore forever that he would not deem the King beautiful ever again.  Vivec wept as he slew all those around him with his terrible new spear. He named it MUATRA, which is Milk Taker, and even the Chimeri mystics knew his fury. Anyone struck by Vivec at this time turned barren and withered into bone shapes. The path of bones became a sentence for the stars to read, and the heavens have never known children since. Vivec hunted down the biters one by one, and all their progeny, and he killed them all by means of the Nine Apertures, and the wise still hide theirs from Muatra.""

Games,3dwkmu,LordManders,27,Mon Jul 20 08:13:06 2015 UTC,"What? The imperial city was more massive and detailed than any city in Skyrim, by far."
Games,3dwkmu,PraiseHelmaroc,18,Mon Jul 20 11:02:13 2015 UTC,"If by ""massive and detailed"" you mean the same arches and walls copy pasted into concentric circles, then yes."
Games,3dwkmu,reversememe,9,Mon Jul 20 13:19:50 2015 UTC,Yeah that's a thing that happens in older games. Oblivion's cities and landscape changed and is way more interesting than the tundra that is all over Skyrim.
Games,3dwkmu,Sawgon,17,Mon Jul 20 13:40:20 2015 UTC,"While I don't agree, I see his complaint. Pretty sure the other cities in Oblivion like Anvil and Bravil felt more realistic than the Imperial City."
Games,3dwkmu,Weis,3,Mon Jul 20 14:00:18 2015 UTC,"Probably my #1 complaint with Skyrim was that the regions/cities didn't feel quite as diverse or welcoming. Each city in Oblivion had a very distinct visual feel, whereas in Skyrim, some of the holds differentiated (which was even harder to do this time around because of a more unifying aesthetic) but plenty felt so tiny and insignificant, like Falkreath, Morthal and Winterhold (pretty much a place next to the College). Kind of sad when each city in Oblivion in my opinion at least stood on its own as something influenced by each of the regions it was near, some even taking on characteristic of as yet unseen regions bordering on the central province."
Games,3dwkmu,HeavyTextbook,8,Mon Jul 20 14:50:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, they are both fairly diverse as far as the ecosystems that you could explore. They both had plains, mountains, forests, swamps, oceans, etc..   In fact, I can easily think of more beautiful environments in Skyrim than Oblivion due to the huge amount of detail they gave many of the mountains, the massive underground caves, and the hot springs.   Both games are incredibly diverse, the only real difference is the climate of the two regions.   Edit: And don't even get me started on Morrowind! That was one of the best worlds ever to explore."
Games,3dwkmu,partyinplatypus,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:53:36 2015 UTC,"Oblivions landscape is bland, mostly empty and computer generated, while Skyrim actually has some depth and far higher density and variation."
Games,3dwkmu,Melonskal,2,Mon Jul 20 14:54:04 2015 UTC,"Playing the game for the first time I actually was pretty astounded at the size of the Imperial City. True, it wasn't by any means actually city sized but it was larger than anything I'd seen prior, and everything that was there was fleshed out."
Games,3dwkmu,HeavyTextbook,4,Mon Jul 20 15:19:03 2015 UTC,what? i thought it was epic
Games,3dwkmu,burgerkingowner,3,Mon Jul 20 16:44:49 2015 UTC,"Well, in my view it definitely is an epic game. But I thought the plot was really straightforward and unimpressive. You have to prevent a demon from being brought into the world at the hands of a cult. Feel like I've seen that idea a million times. And I was not really taken by the whole relight the Dragon fires thing. It was something that was completely manufactured to make the plot work, but there was not sufficient lore to immerse me in the plot. I enjoyed the other aspects of the game much more than the central plot."
Games,3dwkmu,niborg,3,Mon Jul 20 09:16:32 2015 UTC,"The main plot, while lacking, had it's moments though. I think visiting Makor Cameron's Paradise is one of my favourite in-game moments. However, saving the world still doesn't hold a candle to my experience with that Dark Brotherhood, Thieves' Guild, or Mages' Guild which often outshone the main questline.  That being said, even though I look at Oblivion with a nostalgia driven rose tinted bias, I don't think that main quest is any worse than Skyrim's."
Games,3dwkmu,TheWanderingFish,2,Mon Jul 20 14:53:43 2015 UTC,I agree except the assassin's guild quests were pretty great.
Games,3dwkmu,SpiderParadox,25,Mon Jul 20 15:44:45 2015 UTC,"You know in most games you get lost and it seems to take away from the experience, you get frustrated because you're not advancing toward your next objective or killing bad guys. The difference between most games and a game like Oblivion and its spectacular expansion is that getting lost isn't a detriment to the experience, it's a core staple of it, and playing it as my first Bethesda game without knowing how to play a game like this gave me one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Here's to getting lost in Fallout 4 in a few months."
Games,3dwkmu,HeavyTextbook,5,Mon Jul 20 18:01:07 2015 UTC,"I share your excitement. I wish I had steam back when I when first purchased oblivion, just to see how many hours I sank into it. I remember at one point stumbling into a cave, to find 2 different bandit factions fighting out. I believe it was the black bow bandits and normal, ""unbranded"" bandits. I sat back and waited for the winner, then massacred them all and sold the black bows for the 200 bounty."

I remember crawling through the dungeons at 3am with the lights off, and that atmospheric ""wind"" sound that perpetuated throughout all of Oblivion's dungeons. I would remember encountering some zombies and a few skeletal archers and shitting myself.  If someone could take me back to those times, with a graphical enhancement and engine update, I'd be happy as shit."
Games,3dwkmu,OneTimeIsAll,3,Mon Jul 20 11:52:28 2015 UTC,FUCK IT IM RE-INSTALLING IT  Plus a graphics overhaul. I'm not sure I can work with vanilla graphics in the game anymore.
Games,3dwkmu,TehHpyfce,3,Mon Jul 20 14:07:04 2015 UTC,"That one quest where you choose what attacks those 3 people, amazing. Great DLC!"
Games,3dwkmu,dbaby53,2,Mon Jul 20 18:16:12 2015 UTC,"And this makes me regret skipping the DLC on my first playthrough on Xbox 360. I just wanted to play the game before I played Skyrim, and having just gotten back from my cousin's place watching him play it, I felt like Oblivion was just in my way.   It's a damn shame. Do you think Skyblivion will eventually get around to the DLC? I tried playing Oblivion again on my PC a while back, but I lost my saves, and haven't touched it since. Just been playing around in Skyrim since I got a much better graphics card that can actually handle the RealVision ENB plus all my other mods."
Games,3dwkmu,LifeWulf,88,Mon Jul 20 14:49:25 2015 UTC,"I may add that 50%+ of the atmosphere and magic of Oblivion is the soundtrack. It was also my first Elder Scrolls game. Getting out of the sewers and hearing this music, while realizing I had a whole world to explore, is one of my most memorable gaming moments. Just hearing the piece now sends chills down my spine and makes me nostalgic. It was the first game where I stopped just to admire the scenery.  Jeremy Soule really nailed it. And the story of how the music came to be, is interesting:    Soule stated that while composing the music he did not imagine any specific characters or events; rather, he wanted it ""to comment on the human condition and the beauty of life"". In a 2006 interview, he related that this desire came as a result of a car accident that occurred during his composition of the score. He said, ""I ended up rolling in my car several times on an interstate while flying headlong into oncoming traffic ... I felt no fear ... I simply just acknowledged to myself that I've had a good life and I would soon have to say goodbye to all of it in a matter of seconds"". Soule sustained only minor injuries, but commented that his feeling during the crash—""that life is indeed precious""—remained with him throughout the rest of the composition."
Games,3dwkmu,A_of,21,Mon Jul 20 15:58:06 2015 UTC,"That's a really beautiful story. It only makes me feel better about the fact that the music has the same effect on me. Seeing white-gold tower and the majestic yet decrepit Ayleid ruins scattered about the shoreline, all such great memories. it also reminds me of the moment when I realized just how large the Imperial City was, and that each of these buildings had interiors I could interact with. Beautiful game."
Games,3dwkmu,HeavyTextbook,17,Mon Jul 20 07:03:36 2015 UTC,"I adore this soundtrack. I remember the first time I had gone into the Kvatch Oblivion gate, it was such a struggle. Finally, I succeeded and tore that gate down. As I was thrown back to Cyrodiil, this track played. I can't really describe it but it was so peaceful after that hell."
Games,3dwkmu,Barney99x,3,Mon Jul 20 07:12:01 2015 UTC,Because I didnt start to play Oblivion until recently I didnt expect I would get much time out of it.  Hundreds of hours later I find that its the music that is the real gem of the series.  So many times I have been walking from city to city and stopped to hear music play.  He captured so much in that music.
Games,3dwkmu,mcdonis,2,Mon Jul 20 07:35:21 2015 UTC,I listened to the Oblivion music for a good chunk of a motorcycle trip across the country. Specifically the parts where we were in the woods.  10/10
Games,3dwkmu,sli,18,Mon Jul 20 17:36:54 2015 UTC,"I agree, Oblivion and Morrowind both with their pros and cons have a ton of charm and heart to them. lots of people are upset and mad at oblivion but I think it's the best evidence that bethesda just bit off more than they could chew with such an ambitious title.  Skyrim just felt very bland generic and kind of lacking in comparison despite superior game mechanics and graphics."
Games,3dwkmu,Partyintheattic,22,Tue Jul 21 00:15:10 2015 UTC,"As a Morrowind player, it's specifically that Oblivion was bland and generic looking that turned me off to the game. Skyrim might be similarly bland and generic looking, but at least everything has cooler designs. No matter which game you dip into, though, the lore is still fantastic."
Games,3dwkmu,234U,12,Mon Jul 20 08:32:14 2015 UTC,"Oblivion felt WAY more generic than Skyrim and Morrowind, I want to see the original jungle Cyrodiil ; ("
Games,3dwkmu,Plastastic,4,Mon Jul 20 12:55:17 2015 UTC,"It was visually more generic but their vision was a paradise fantasy world being torn apart by Oblivion. Remember the quest that transports you to ""Paradise"" when you infiltrate the Mythic Dawn. That was the message they tried to convey.  I won't defend the lack of choice and consequence in the game, but the sacrifice they made for that led to some amazing self contained quests that you rarely see in an RPG."
Games,3dwkmu,Partyintheattic,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:23 2015 UTC,"But... Cyrodiil is just noted for being forested. Valenwood, home of the Wood Elves, is the jungle territory."

The Imperial City  Refayj's famous declaration, ""There is but one city in the Imperial Province,--"" may strike the citizens of the Colovian west as mildly insulting, until perhaps they hear the rest of the remark, which continues, ""--but one city in Tamriel, but one city in the World; that, my brothers, is the city of the Cyrodiils."" From the shore it is hard to tell what is city and what is Palace, for it all rises from the islands of the lake towards the sky in a stretch of gold. Whole neighborhoods rest on the jeweled bridges that connect the islands together. Gondolas and river-ships sail along the watery avenues of its flooded lower dwellings. Moth-priests walk by in a cloud of ancestors; House Guards hold exceptionally long daikatanas crossed at intersections, adorned with ribbons and dragon-flags; and the newly arrived Western legionnaires sweat in the humid air. The river mouth is tainted red from the tinmi soil of the shore, and river dragons rust their hides in its waters. Across the lake the Imperial City continues, merging into the villages of the southern red river and ruins left from the Interregnum.   We were cheated."

Much has been written on the subject of the Uncanny Valley, but I've yet to see an analysis which touches on this aspect: No matter how deep in the valley a particular game might be, we still become familiar with the unique quirks which define its position in the valley, and can even become fond of, or nostalgic for, that uncanny quality."

Games,3dwkmu,merkmerk73,4,Mon Jul 20 19:59:14 2015 UTC,"I feel the same is said of Skyrim now, and I think the complaints are all valid in both cases. Oblivion has many technical downfalls, but once you can see past those hurdles, its a really beautiful experience.  It takes a lack of cynicism at times, and sometimes I wonder how prevalent that is in the vocal /r/games community, because constantly you get games in development with announced features and hundreds of reproachful comments calling out the slightest displeasing feature. It's necessary to be skeptical at times but the level of it on here sometimes gets really harsh."

Absolutely loved the addon since it added the much needed variety back to the game. Until that point it was just forest and snow. They also did a really good job with the Morrowind Addons providing different terrains (snowy Solstheim and almost tropical Mournhold - even though Mournhold was only the city you could feel the tropical heat).   I think Skyrim missed the point here when they added Solstheim. Sure it was a little bit of nostalgia, but in the end it was the same snowy area we had in the main game. They could have provided a completely new area, with completely new architecture, instead they went with this comparably cheap approach of reusing set pieces in a lot of places. I did like the Dragonborn DLC but i really would have wished for a more different environment in the end.   Edit: I should add that i don't count Apocrypha since it is technically not really part of the open world and therefor most of the time not relevant. Kinda like the quest in the picture in Oblivion."

The mountains around it certainly look better than they did in Oblivion which is gratifying. I'm sure the textures inside the city are of a higher resolution, but overall it captures that absolutely magical feeling of being inside it.  The grass looks quite weird though, I think it may be because some of the grass and flora from Skyrim's tundra was being reused, which made everything look weirdly pink."

I still remember staring in awe at the first glass sword I found, imagining what insane stats that green blade in the dremora's hand must have.  Hoping to see a return and reinforcement of some of that with the new crafting system in Fallout 4, if not getting unique weapons from looting enemies, crafting crazy combinations whose function you have no idea about."

Games,3dwkmu,WhyMentionMyUsername,5,Mon Jul 20 17:25:54 2015 UTC,It's almost there they're doing scripting and small items.   Some interiors as well.
Games,3dwkmu,Khiva,9,Mon Jul 20 18:09:09 2015 UTC,"Wait hold on, is Skywind as fully implemented as the Morroblivion?"
Games,3dwkmu,sillybandland,25,Tue Jul 21 16:52:42 2015 UTC,"Nope, far from it, since Skywind aims to re-create all the original assets as well as add voice-acting. It's just a lot more content to make.  You can check out their YouTube channel as well as their blog for more information."
Games,3dwkmu,jianthekorean,4,Mon Jul 20 17:31:50 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised people haven't heard.  I played through Morroblivion about a year ago and had a blast with it.  Highly recommended.  Get yourself some texture packs, crank 'dem graphics and you're in a whole new world."
Games,3dwkmu,WhyMentionMyUsername,10,Mon Jul 20 17:42:09 2015 UTC,"okay, but what if i want to import Morrowblivion into Skywind?? Huh?"
Games,3dwkmu,HypnoToad0,45,Mon Jul 20 09:03:55 2015 UTC,Wait. Are we talking about Morroblivion or Skyblivion? OP's title says Skyblivion.
Games,3dwkmu,WhyMentionMyUsername,49,Mon Jul 20 18:02:59 2015 UTC,Morroblivion. Skyblivion is far from finished as you can see in OP's post. They're working hard on Skywind though.
Games,3dwkmu,Harperlarp,26,Mon Jul 20 07:43:22 2015 UTC,Skywind sounds way more interesting than Skyblivion or Morroblivion. Morrowind's world is just much more alien
Games,3dwkmu,Darrian,22,Mon Jul 20 07:47:07 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree - Morrowind is my favorite game of all time because of the atmosphere. Also the fact that you had to actually follow the dialogue to figure out what to do instead of being spoonfed all the information and shown directly where to go with location pointers all over the place.  The mechanics were terrible, but I still enjoyed the fuck out of it."
Games,3dwkmu,HypnoToad0,18,Mon Jul 20 07:52:57 2015 UTC,"I tried to play Morrowind after staring my ES adventures with Oblivion, but 5 hours in I hated literally everything about it. I'd love to play it through the eyes of Oblivion. It would give me a chance to enjoy the land and story without the mechanics I hated so much."
Games,3dwkmu,ANUSTART942,21,Mon Jul 20 08:00:53 2015 UTC,"Yeah, people who go on about how Morrowind is the best of the series must be thinking purely about the world and story. The mechanics were downright awful and have only improved throughout the series.  Sure, you could do more as far as spellcrafting goes and that's awesome, but there's nothing stopping you from modding that kind of thing into Skyrim, and in fact you have quite the selection as far as that goes.  You can't mod a decent combat system into Morrowind however. It's just broken that bad."
Games,3dwkmu,Democrab,28,Mon Jul 20 08:16:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if Bethesda remastered Morrowind there would be no reason to ever play skyrim or oblivion."
Games,3dwkmu,TooSubtle,2,Mon Jul 20 11:02:20 2015 UTC,Not necessarily. Some people prefer the world of Oblivion or Skyrim to Morrowind. There will always be a reason to play every game in the series.
Games,3dwkmu,theswerto,8,Mon Jul 20 08:08:02 2015 UTC,"Maybe the shitty combat and the like if that was left like it is in the original.  D&D is fun, but not in a video game. I never got why anyone preferred the Whoosh Whoosh Thwack system to the still pretty bad system in Skyrim and Oblivion."
Games,3dwkmu,WhyMentionMyUsername,43,Mon Jul 20 13:57:34 2015 UTC,"Personally the mechanics in Morrowind were what made it so much more engaging. Having the giant mushrooms in the newer version of the engine is pretty cool I guess, but it's a surface level reimagining of what made Morrowind so interesting for people like me.   Morrowind was all about systems and simulations, from the way dialogue worked, to the mechanics behind enemies agroing on you, to the crazy possibilities behind spellcrafting and alchemy. Your character's presence in that world was determined by so many more things than Skyrim's ruleset allows for. I really don't see the appeal in Skywind myself."
Games,3dwkmu,Darrian,4,Mon Jul 20 21:30:10 2015 UTC,"mechanics   Ugh.  No.  The mechanics is the least attractive part of Morrowind. Next to the graphics, nothing in that game is more dated. Have you actually ever played Morrowind?  Most people who reminisce about morrowind have barely played the game, or only read about how good the story was (Yes, best story in the series, best quest design, all of that it deserves to be called). But praising the mechanics?  Skyrim may have dropped the ball by removing the stats, but everything else mechanically in skyrim is better.   You want to swing a sword in skyrim? Go swing a sword, you'll hit something. Never are you going to go swing something in skyrim and watch it hit air when you see it go through your target, that will never happen. Morrowind? Unless you're at max stamina and have a high skill in your current weapon, you're going to be missing a lot. In fact, it's hard to tell the difference between a miss and hit because there is no animation difference, you'll just notice your target doesn't lose hp.   Want to cast magic in morrowind? Well, hope you have time to sit down and learn one of the most needlessly complicated magic systems in elder scrolls. Sure you can get cool funny spells like icarian flight, but to get to cool stuff like that you have to do some of the most pointless grinding and deal with ridiculous magic values, Oblivion was a much less painful version of this.  Stats being gone may sound terrible in Skyrim, but essentially Skyrim still has them, they were streamlined by pushing their effects into the sill tree. A combination of the two would have been far better, but essentially you get the same benefits by selecting hp/stamina/mana each level and throwing some talents in your trees. But then again, stats were barely used to their effect in Morrowind, Oblivion is probably the best example in the ES series of proper stat use due to it having actually stat thresholds.   But yes, let's go full fanboy and ignore the fact that Morrowind is a mechanically stale game that is stuck in the early 90's, even though it came out in 2002.   What is skywind going to lack from morrowind? Probably the conversations are going to be the biggest difference. The possible conversation options in Morrowind, and how long many of them were is just unfeasible for voice acting.   The spell system, because honestly Skyrim's while less balanced is far easier to use. I wish they'd try and implement the custom spell effects of Morrowind, because they certainly are fun, and many spells like that have found there way into mods like Midas Magic (so its hardly fair to say it's not possible on skyrim's system) but I understand completely if they stick to vanilla skyrim spells - for all intents and purposes they do what the game needs.   The weapon system - and good riddance. Using melee attacks in Morrowind was a pain. If you haven't go turn on Morrowind and equip a sword, go run around and try to hit something. You're not going to be able to hit anything more dangerous than a skeever for the first hour or so, and leveling up in Morrowind is more tedious than it was in Oblivion or Skyrim - in fact it was the first time in the series I ever felt I needed to console command to save time because I wasn' getting skill ups from questing and actually felt I needed to grind.   What will be there? pretty much everything else.  You want the factions? Awesome, they're there.  You want the branching paths? Awesome, they're there.  You want the story? There.  You want the locations? There.  You want the characters? There.  The Music? There.  Everything else is there, but the dated and pointless additions, and sadly the unfeasible option of the dialogue."
Games,3dwkmu,Bobby_Marks2,4,Mon Jul 20 08:18:33 2015 UTC,"Those are definitely some of the great features IMO :) The dialogue in particular has an amazing amount of depth into it which just isn't possible with voice acting.  I'm mostly annoyed by combat being based on movement with the chop/slash/thrust and in the early levels where you miss every single hit).  I hope they get the atmosphere right in Skywind, but honestly doubt they can live up to it. I hadn't really thought about them not including all the features/systems that make up what Morrowind really is about, and also dread that they override it with Skyrim logic.."
Games,3dwkmu,CarlTheWagonPriest,6,Mon Jul 20 12:02:49 2015 UTC,"I want a fully playable shivering isles in Skyrim the most. Out of all the main games and DLC's shivering isles was the most fun I had. And like you mention the alien aspect, it's because of just how absurd everything in Shivering Isles was."
Games,3dwkmu,WumperD,9,Mon Jul 20 08:50:39 2015 UTC,"https://tesrenewal.com/morroblivion-faq   Current Status (version 0.64)  Morrowind: 100% of the main Morrowind game has been completed, and is fairly well debugged (details here). There is very little that gets in the way of a complete Morrowind experience.  Tribunal: Main quest is 99% complete (with the exception of some creature models) and playable. Sidequests are 100% complete.  Bloodmoon: All quests are complete, including main questline, East Empire Company questline and various sidequests."
Games,3dwkmu,Darrian,9,Mon Jul 20 10:59:39 2015 UTC,"From what I know, this modding team is currently focusing nearly all effort on Skywind, the Morrowind to Skyrim conversion. That means that just a tiny portion of the team is working on Skyblivion, and so that potion has only been able to do so much - i.e. right now, they're just importing basic things and getting the framework in for a full conversion, which will commence once Skywind is nearly complete. That's why it's unfinished at the moment."
Games,3dwkmu,AngryData,7,Mon Jul 20 15:33:59 2015 UTC,"There is an other ambitious project called Skywind that will probably be finished before the next elder scrolls game. This is not just a simple port, the team is rebuilding Morrowind in the Skyrim engine."
Games,3dwkmu,T_Gracchus,9,Mon Jul 20 06:24:49 2015 UTC,"It's the same people doing Skyblivion. They just have fewer people working on Skyblivion until Skywind is done from what I understand, at which point they'll refocus their efforts into finishing Skyblivion as well."
Games,3dwkmu,Thjoth,22,Mon Jul 20 09:19:48 2015 UTC,"Morrowblivion was playable years and years ago, I know because I played it."
Games,3dwkmu,ofNoImportance,21,Mon Jul 20 11:11:30 2015 UTC,"I agree with you to some extent. According to the description the game is still in v0.2 alpha, so we'll probably never see a full conversion of Oblivion into Skyrim at this rate.  That said, the next Elder Scrolls won't be released for another 2-3 years, so if these guys can get some extra help and dedicate their time to it, I'd wager they could get it to the point where they could add some worthwhile content."
Games,3dwkmu,sunjester,4,Mon Jul 20 11:57:28 2015 UTC,"At Bethesda's current rate it could even be 4 years, with almost exactly 4 years between the release of Skyrim and scheduled release of Fallout 4."
Games,3dwkmu,killthealias,10,Mon Jul 20 05:23:07 2015 UTC,"They don't have to work on one at a time, you know.  Three, maybe even two years after the release of Fallout 4 wouldn't be unreasonable at all as they shuffle personnel from one project to the other; as one game nears completion, staff would be shifted from FO4 to TES6 as they complete their work."
Games,3dwkmu,Proditus,5,Mon Jul 20 06:05:01 2015 UTC,The team size hasn't changed significantly for the last 4 games they developed. There's no reason that the rate at which they produce games should change.
Games,3dwkmu,Darrian,3,Mon Jul 20 07:50:10 2015 UTC,Not to mention the fact that they have a pretty small team to begin with.
Games,3dwkmu,freelancespy87,2,Mon Jul 20 10:57:54 2015 UTC,If anything it'll get longer as fans demand more content out of the games.
Games,3dwkmu,BertitoMio,5,Mon Jul 20 12:32:53 2015 UTC,"I remember an interview from before the release of Skyrim that said they were already well into development of their next game (i.e. Fallout 4). The entire team doesn't work on a single game at once, rather, they work in stages. One team does their part, hands it off to the next team, and then starts the next project.  I'd say that given how close we are to launch of Fallout 4 and how long they took to announce it, the game is probably done by some (Ubisoft) standards, and the next Elder Scrolls game is already in the pipeline. A 2017-2018 release would line up with what seems to be a typical dev cycle of 6-ish years."
Games,3dwkmu,freelancespy87,7,Mon Jul 20 17:43:55 2015 UTC,"Well I don't know. I would imagine replicating the map is the hardest part in all of this, and that part appears to be coming along pretty well from the video at least. It's not like they have to record voices or come up with unique quests. All of that's already done for them. At this point it's about importing voice files and replicating the quests in the editor, and from what I remember dicking around in it myself, was pretty user friendly as far as making events and quests goes.  I'd say as long as they stick with it we'd have a pretty good chance at seeing this before the next elder scrolls game, but that's also assuming they.. well, stick with it. Less ambitious mods have been abandoned."
Games,3dwkmu,BertitoMio,4,Mon Jul 20 11:06:08 2015 UTC,"Personally,  I would love to play it in its current state.  Just to hang around in cyrodill for a while would be nice.  Sometimes I just want to visit a fantastic place without being nagged by npcs or monsters."
Games,3dwkmu,freelancespy87,2,Mon Jul 20 11:08:53 2015 UTC,Pretty much the entire reason I bought ESO was so that I could revisit Cyrodiil.
Games,3dwkmu,foolfromhell,2,Mon Jul 20 06:58:20 2015 UTC,You actually willed yourself to buy that?  My respect man.  I was disgusted really early with it.
Games,3dwkmu,Xylense,2,Mon Jul 20 12:01:18 2015 UTC,It's my favorite MMO and my least favorite Elder Scrolls game.
Games,3dwkmu,thearn4,5,Tue Jul 21 05:10:44 2015 UTC,Funny way of putting it.
Games,3dwkmu,SuperCho,6,Tue Jul 21 11:55:32 2015 UTC,so if these guys can get some extra help and dedicate their time to it   theyd probably work harder if they... got paid
Games,3dwkmu,xChris777,4,Tue Jul 21 12:15:28 2015 UTC,"Morrowblivion was finished long ago. At least in the sense of, you can complete the main quest"
Games,3dwkmu,drakonman,9,Mon Jul 20 07:00:38 2015 UTC,"I'm sure this will be dropped in favor of importing Skyrim into whatever comes next   I'm not so sure, maybe it's just me, but most of the quests and places in Skyrim were actually very forgettable in the end. I have much more nostalgia about the quests from Oblivion. Not everyone may feel that way though."
Games,3dwkmu,Democrab,3,Mon Jul 20 13:26:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm only holding out hope for Skywind at this point, and even that's just like ""Well, this might come out and be good eventually, but I'm not going to get very hyped for it at all."" Skyblivion seems like a bit much to hope for, considering Skywind has taken this long and still isn't out."
Games,3dwkmu,lickmyhairyballs,3,Mon Jul 20 15:14:16 2015 UTC,The next Elder Scrolls title could be out as early as 2017   This is extremely unlikely.
Games,3dwkmu,PugSwagMaster,2,Mon Jul 20 05:58:20 2015 UTC,iv been working with this mod and watching the community for years. saying it will never finish is really discouraging considering how much they have actuality accomplished.
Games,3dwkmu,NotEthosLab,14,Mon Jul 20 17:24:03 2015 UTC,"Ever heard of OpenTTD? It's an open source rewrite of Transport Tycoon Deluxe. It hit 1.0 in 2010, 15 years after release of the original TTD.  Saying ""Skyrims 4 years old"" as any kind of reason as to why these projects would fail shows you have very little idea of the scope and breadth of them. Hell, plenty of games that are reusing tonnes of content from previous titles along with having an actual, full dev team still take longer than that to finish."
Games,3dwkmu,AnOnlineHandle,43,Tue Jul 21 03:18:45 2015 UTC,Yeah I noticed these projects are never finished and I don't expect this one to be either. People will be hooked on the next Elder Scrolls and not even look at this.

Games,3dwkmu,badsectoracula,23,Mon Jul 20 08:29:00 2015 UTC,"This is why I got cranky during the hysteria over paid mods, when modders of some of the most popular mods were saying they could come out of retirement to actually work on the mod if they could fund themselves now.  People went on about this golden fantasy land where mods actually get finished and we couldn't do better with modders actually able to be paid. If somebody actually made a decent full conversion, and Bethesda allowed it, I'd consider dropping a few bucks on it."
Games,3dwkmu,Silvershot335,3,Mon Jul 20 07:48:30 2015 UTC,"While your ""crankyness"" makes sense, it is for the wrong reasons.  If a modder stops working on a mod because he has less time than before due to job/other money making/etc then the paid mods would allow him to spend more time in making said mods. This is basic logic based on good old ""money is time"".  The problem isn't that however (which is why i said wrong reasons). There is plenty of proof of people who once given the ability to monetize their previously for-free work they were able to do more of it and in a much higher quality (see YouTubers as a prime example).  The problem is that we also have plenty of proof that making somethings doesn't mean that people will also buy it. See all those indie games - regardless of what Jim Sterling would have you believe, Steam has only a tiny fraction of the available indie games out there. Yet many of them will not see any sales (especially those outside of Steam).  Considering how many downloads your average mod has and the percentages Steam wanted to give the authors, i doubt anyone but the most popular mods would be making any money near liveable rates. Even those popular mods wouldn't really be that popular anymore - notice in mobile platforms how many downloads a popular paid app has vs a popular free app. In one case is in the tens (or maybe hundreds for the most popular apps) of thousands, in the other case is in millions (tens of millions for the most popular apps). If you apply that ratio to the current popular mod downloads and factor in the expected prices and author percentages, i doubt you'll be left with anything worth talking about."

Just because people can publish ebooks and not everyone will buy them, the market is a failure? :S   Considering how many downloads your average mod has   You're talking free mods, prior to serious work and talent being able to be invested in them.   and the percentages Steam wanted to give the authors   Steam took the same 30% cut that anything sold on their platform takes, and for it the modders get a HUGE amount of benefits which they couldn't replicate themselves for the same money (or even replicate at all, meaning they'd have no product), such as bandwidth, sales processing, auto installation, huge market advertisement reach, etc.  Bethesda took a 40% cut or something, which seems steep, but is far more generous than most IPs give when creating something based on all their work and market building as a foundation (e.g. I think that Star Wars authors get something like 7%, yet it's a super valuable 7% over 100% of their own product, because the other party brings a huge amount of pre-existing work to build on and a huge fanbase market, you're not making your own product, which modders are still free to do if they think they don't need what Bethesda brings to the table).  Modders getting 30% on Valve's games are getting six figure salaries, far higher than the people who actually made the majority of the game which the mod sits atop of (according to Bethesda's blog about the money modders were making even over the first few days)."

That sentence you quoted shouldn't be taken out of context - by itself it isn't a problem, but it becomes a problem when people expect to be able to make a living out of their mods when consider the existing data and trends. Please take the rest of my message in consideration as a whole, not piece by piece.   You're talking free mods, prior to serious work and talent being able to be invested in them.   Which is why i also mentioned the free vs paid apps in mobile and how having a price affects downloads/installs considerably. Again, please read and take the message as a whole, not in pieces.   Steam took the same 30% ... Bethesda took a 40% cut    I wasn't talking about those numbers being fair or generous, this is really not relevant. My post was about mod authors being able to make enough money off their mod so that they can put more time (that otherwise they would put in other money-making endeavors) and the percentage the author gets is a fact that affects directly the viability of this. Being generous or not is a subjective opinion and is up to interpretation based on other conditions, but at the end of the day it is the percentage itself that would be used to calculate what the author gets, not the reasons behind it."

And we sure as hell didn’t run this campaign so we could put that money in the bank, guarantee ourselves a profit and turn out some flimsy replica of a game I’ve made before. You went all in supporting us and we’ve gone all in making the game. Is Star Citizen today a bigger goal than I imagined in 2012? Absolutely. Is that a bad thing? Absolutely not: it’s the whole damn point.""  Source:  https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/14839-Letter-From-The-Chairman"
Games,3dzter,Leknasant,28,Tue Jul 21 00:28:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not a backer of SC personally, but wasn't there an argument recently brought up that most people who contributed to the kickstarter did it for the original sales pitch Chris Roberts made, and not all the additional content that was added due to its success?"
Games,3dzter,BigRiggety,43,Tue Jul 21 02:29:09 2015 UTC,"I backed back in late 2013 knowing only about the intended space simulation aspect of the game.  I am not annoyed by the delays, nor the ambition of the team. Because i backed less than the RRP of most games that get released these days and i had no expectations that i would be playing it any time soon.  If one thing has become abundantly clear over the years it is that the majority of vocal internet gamers do not know how a game is made and will riot at the first opportunity if given the chance."

There's another thing that's become abundantly clear over the years, and that's that the history of video games is absolutely littered with ambitious designs that bit off more than they could chew, made extravagant promises about how awesome the game was going to be, and then crashed and burned. As someone who was repeatedly disappointed in the final years of the Golden Age of flight sims in the mid to late '90s, I'm highly skeptical that an actual playable game will come out of this project. I'd love to be proven wrong, but I'm not betting money on it."

Games,3dzter,InSOmnlaC,4,Tue Jul 21 06:36:17 2015 UTC,"the history of video games is absolutely littered with ambitious designs that bit off more than they could chew, made extravagant promises about how awesome the game was going to be, and then crashed and burned.   I'm not a huge fan of Star Citizen's development model, but its really a stretch to say that videogame history is littered with games that were overly ambitious and sucked. Being overly ambitious and being meh is another argument entirely."
Games,3dzter,TROPtastic,4,Tue Jul 21 06:49:42 2015 UTC,"Fully agree, the MMOs just don't pop out of thin air like that. Star Citizen has been 2,5~ years in development. It's a huge feat considering there is no existing similar games and it's built from scratch.   Development time of other MMOs? WoW 4 years, newest Guild Wars 5 years. Star Citizen is at the halfway point.   Reference http://i.imgur.com/flrVzR9.png"
Games,3dzter,Qooda,-6,Tue Jul 21 09:31:13 2015 UTC,"Or we do know how games are made, and in star citizen's case they've gotten away with stuff no publisher would've allowed. This project would've been canned or changed ages ago due to feature creep.   Star citizen is not a project any publisher would back, and they've circumvented that by taking money from people. The lack of real goals and when the game may actually gain traction is a disservice to every backer. They don't have deadlines because they've already got money. And every person who adds more money is just fueling a perpetual development cycle.  Star Citizen will not release any time soon and when it does it will not be what the backers wanted. Unfortunately the backers can't can the product."
Games,3dzter,VintageSin,8,Tue Jul 21 07:31:15 2015 UTC,"You know there is a reason why publishers shit can projects that exhibit unhealthy scope/feature creep right? Risk. The bigger you go the higher the risk it all falls apart. The cases were it all goes well are rare (literally in the case of golden eye). Duke nukem forever, daikatana,  la noir, and many other game failures took down the studios.  Most successful studio's who put out big games tend to release and increment. Because you tend to make less sweeping changes at a time and you can fix the ideas that didn't go well sooner before you build and interlink stuff into it.  I respect their ambition but i worry for them. I want to play the game they pitched and all the other stuff ia great but at some point they need to lock it down and ship."
Games,3dzter,kingmanic,26,Tue Jul 21 09:17:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not a backer of SC personally, but wasn't there an argument recently brought up that most people who contributed to the kickstarter did it for the original sales pitch Chris Roberts made, and not all the additional content that was added due to its success?   The original pitch was to break molds and make the biggest, badassest space sim ever, bordering on sci fi universe sim:   Let's put high-end PC gaming and Space Sims back on the map!  Star Citizen brings the visceral action of piloting interstellar craft through combat and exploration to a new generation of gamers at a level of fidelity never before seen. At its core Star Citizen is a destination, not a one-off story. It's a complete universe where any number of adventures can take place, allowing players to decide their own game experience. Pick up jobs as a smuggler, pirate, merchant, bounty hunter, or enlist as a pilot, protecting the borders from outside threats. Chris Roberts has always wanted to create one cohesive universe that encompasses everything that made Wing Commander and Privateer / Freelancer special. A huge sandbox with a complex and deep lore allowing players to explore or play in whatever capacity they wish. That universe is Star Citizen.   And some more. Check the kickstarter page, it was never any smaller than it is now. The scale of the project is just more obvious now that it's at full throttle."
Games,3dzter,emmanuelvr,5,Tue Jul 21 04:07:07 2015 UTC,"IIRC the initial kickstarter was a bit light on details, so it's safer to assume that most people were backing for the vision and not specific content, and additional content for the most part rounded out that vision and made it something concrete."
Games,3dzter,TROPtastic,10,Tue Jul 21 06:58:01 2015 UTC,"This is in inherent problem with Kickstarter and Stetch Goals. People buy into the base idea of a game knowing (hopefully) that there are goals beyond the base game and sometimes want those while other times they don't want it.  It's a catch-22 because you want the game funded, but not... too much... just enough; whatever that is."
Games,3dzter,MizerokRominus,-5,Tue Jul 21 02:45:01 2015 UTC,"This has been stopped in the case of StarCitizen.  On the RSI website there were continuous stretch goals over and over after the initial kick starter.   However either by popular demand or administrative decision, CIG stopped making stretch goals.  The reason: Feature Creep was delaying the game too far, and full funding was achieved for the whole of the project and its entirety.  CIG have stated that they ""will bring back stretch goals, when we (CIG) need money for a feature we want to implement."""
Games,3dzter,Artemis317,12,Tue Jul 21 03:02:05 2015 UTC,"Feature Creep was delaying the game too far, and full funding was achieved for the whole of the project and its entirety.   This isn't true. They got rid of stretch goals since there was nothing more to add and it was causing negative PR. The last 15 or so stretch goals were just ships, backer rewards, or hangar flair. There was literally zero reason to continue with them. Feature creep was never an issue.  Also, the current estimate for game completion is around $100 million, from CR himself."
Games,3dzter,303i,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:20:57 2015 UTC,Can they really hope to make that money back with a niche market game though? I can see why publishers were leery.
Games,3dzter,Flutterwander,4,Tue Jul 21 12:20:18 2015 UTC,"Why would they need to make the whole lot back? Everything comes from the crowd, so essentially they aren't spending any of their own money (outside of the first million that CR put forward for the initial demo).  Only purchases past the first full release of the game can be considered actual income/profit."
Games,3dzter,303i,1 point,Tue Jul 21 12:32:32 2015 UTC,"It's not Monopoly money, it still gets spent. A 100 million project is still a 100 million project. If it doesn't make that money back then it proves to publishers that such an ambitious project isn't profitable. If people are willing to throw their money into a hole that's their initiative, but it doesn't magically fill it up to the top."
Games,3dzter,Flutterwander,3,Tue Jul 21 12:40:14 2015 UTC,Valid point I guess. Publishers would never fund something this risky regardless. Not while every generic FPS release brings in millions.
Games,3dzter,303i,-1,Tue Jul 21 13:12:03 2015 UTC,"Don't get me wrong, I think SC is a neat concept, but 100 mil is an obscene level of budget for this kind of game, and I think crowd funding enables that level of spending. I suppose that's both a good and a bad thing."
Games,3dzter,Flutterwander,3,Tue Jul 21 13:19:26 2015 UTC,"It doesn't need to fill it up to the top. Backers didn't give CIG a loan, nor do they expect a monetary ROI. We aren't a typical shareholder. In essence, they have already paid for the game, and expect a kick-ass game in return. What they don't use to finish development, plus any sales after release, would be considered profit for CIG - which can then be funneled into further development.   This is the major difference between publisher and community backed projects. The publisher expects to make money after release. The community wants to play the game of their dreams, and buys into the idea of developing it. The community essentially buys their copy of the game when they pledge their support, which counts as a sale."
Games,3dzter,GreenElite87,0,Tue Jul 21 14:33:51 2015 UTC,If it doesn't make that money back   $100 MM from kickstarter is not the same as $100 MM from a publisher. It is much more akin to actual purchases of the game. They have already made their money back - it was paid for by the consumers.
Games,3dzter,platitudes,-6,Tue Jul 21 17:14:57 2015 UTC,"Same a happened with Broken Age. Game devs promise one thing then deliver another, so feature-creeped and bloated the original neat idea is lost in a mountain of shit."
Games,3dzter,Ezreal_As_lt_Gets,3,Tue Jul 21 06:21:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure most backers spent money to gain advantage over the average player and not just because they liked the concept of the game. Ships, ship equipment, FPS module gear, lifetime ship insurance, in-game currency... Despite all that the devs and fanboys are saying it's very clear that pay-to-win will be very significant in SC and there's no way in hell I'm buying this game until months after the release date - if I'm proven wrong of course, which I doubt I am.  On the FPS module players will be able to acquire better weapons and equipment by spending real money. There is a limit on how much currency can be bought periodically, but that's $25 worth of currency a day right now and that is a shitton of currency.  Ships on the other hand won't be sold after the game is released, however with more than a million backers who spend almost $100 each on average it's obvious that there will be plenty of players flying around with superior ships compared to the ""scrubs"" who only bought the default Auroras for $60 after the game was released. That of course doesn't take in account the possibility of acquiring ship equipment with real money, similar to how it works in the FPS module.  Also, since currency sale will be used to fund the maintenance of servers after the game launches there is a possibility that the developers might force players to have to grind for a long time until they can buy a better ship or equipment in order to encourage players to buy currency with real money. That might not  be the case in the end of course, but right now I'm very skeptical."
Games,3dzter,Synchrotr0n,-3,Tue Jul 21 04:39:27 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I have a group of friends (8 people) who are all very excited for SC and and have all spent at-least $1,000 with some spending more than double that.  Not a single one of them believes that they will have any kind of advantage. They put that much money into it because they want this game to be a reality, and because they are passionate about the project. Will they have some badass bonuses? Yeah, one of my friends owns an Idris. That'll be pretty badass. Will he be unstoppable? Certainly not.  In fact, when I first backed I got a 300i (pretty cheap, not really bult for combat) I think it was, and I kicked ass at Arena Commander (I was in the top 100 in the leaderboards for like, a day).  I upgraded to the Super Hornet so I could do even better and it actually had the opposite effect. I do worse now than I ever did before.  From how AC plays right now, I strongly believe that the skill of the pilot plays a much bigger role than the ship you're in."
Games,3dzter,ProPandaBear,5,Tue Jul 21 08:12:36 2015 UTC,"How buying a better ship and equipment with money not fully implicate in advantages for the ones paying?  When you say skill has a big role that doesn't change the fact that if two equally skilled players play this game the one with a better ship will certainly win more than 50% of the times. There is absolutely no argument against that. Also, combat is not the only thing that will make a player successful in SC, there is also space exploration, missions and a bunch of other stuff that can that can be completed with non combat ships, so pick two cargo/transport ships like the $300 Orion and the $60 Aurora and tell me the first won't grant the player much better rewards over time."
Games,3dzter,Synchrotr0n,6,Tue Jul 21 13:50:42 2015 UTC,"Backers should be worried at that kind of logic being used to defend the feature creep. That post could be copy-pasted to justify adding any number of extra features.   A good test to see if development is healthy is whether they could afford to finish the promised features with the money they currently have. If they're funding already promised features with funds raised from promising additional features, that's called a pyramid scheme."
Games,3dzter,Teddyman,16,Tue Jul 21 13:54:22 2015 UTC,Backers should be worried at that kind of logic being used to defend the feature creep. That post could be copy-pasted to justify adding any number of extra features.    They've stopped adding new features and stretch-goals about 25 million ago.
Games,3dzter,SendoTarget,-2,Tue Jul 21 17:36:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, it is a bad thing. It is feature creep. And people backed Star Citizen because they wanted a great Space Dogfight game, not because they wanted a kitchen sink with every genre stuffed into it.  Also, 80+ million is a shitload of money for any kind of game, but its not infinite. Companies have spend more on JUST a fps game and still didn't get it right.   Just because they are the biggest kickstarter ever doesn't mean they have the ressources to make their everything-game."
Games,3dzter,ultramarine8,6,Tue Jul 21 06:08:12 2015 UTC,"You're not completely incorrect, but people didn't back the game to get a good dogfighting game. people backed the game because they wanted a ""realistic"" space age simulator, and that's what they're currently making."
Games,3dzter,Cayote,2,Tue Jul 21 07:17:07 2015 UTC,"So there is only one kind of people that backed SC? I know a lot of people who backed it because all they wanted was a good, multiplayer space ship game in a sandboxed universe... Let me draw you a translation, EVE Online did what SC did, it was called Incarna, and it gave you the ability to see your character inside your ship, and walk around in it, and other stuff like that. People were fucking pissed off, and the devs themselves admit it was the stupidest thing they ever did. Why? Because the game was not polished enough, they focused on adding more and more features to the game without polishing the previous one and finishing what had to be done. Then CCP (Eve online's company), did a turn about, and started listening to the complaints, filtering what was actually an issue with the CSM (elected players that are very knowledgeable about the game), and then working on those. And because of that, the Eve online quality and subs went through the roof!  Now, what Star Citizen is doing is adding more and more features, while leaving a wasteland of unfinished and broken features, and the core player base isn't exactly happy because you have to put up with a lot of shit to handle the game. I can play the game through a friend's account, and a lot of stuff is unbalanced, or has been put in but is currently in a placeholder form. And this is a pretty common problem when a team uses a bad development method.   The standard development process for a feature in a game is:   Conceptualization and brain storming until the group is set on an idea that will work, and how it will be implemented into the game Designing the various things required, if it's dogfighting, it's designing how the cockpit will look, how fast paced you want it to feel, etc... Programming, this is quite self-explanatory, albeit the most complicated part. This one is optional if there is no level to design, as level design in SC is more like making the entire space Art production, artists will come in and do the texturing required for the designed stuff to look good.   That's the easy, and fun part of making a feature. This is about 50-66% of the time spent for a feature in the development process. Then comes the boring part.   Test features Fix the bugs and issues Polish features, this includes tweaking everything from art design to programing so that everything feels smooth. Expand feature, since you generally work in layers, making sure the basic stuff works before building on it. It's not enough! Go to 6.   This is basically where 75% of Star Citizen's features are. They are in the 7,8,9 area. Lots of neat features were added, a lot of them are unfinished, or simply don't work, and lots of people are hyped for those, but because they spend so much development time all over the place, starting off new features, and never finishing the old ones, or even fixing bugs that have been in the game since the start of alpha, it gets very demoralizing for players. My friends that have SC simply don't play it anymore 'cause it's fucking boring, and all the cool stuff won't probably be usable until the end of 2015, and probably further if SC keeps adding more featurettes.   tl;dr; people aren't mad because of the feature creep, they're mad because SC currently has a dozen of features that are in-game, but unusable and incomplete, and they keep starting off new features instead of finishing old ones. There are seriously only 2 things to do in the game right now."
Games,3dzter,Icemasta,-5,Tue Jul 21 12:40:07 2015 UTC,I backed the game because I expected it to push the limits of the possible... and that is what was pitched and that is what CR is known for. So personally I am glad that there are as few compromises as possible.
Games,3dzter,A_Sinclaire,27,Tue Jul 21 11:36:03 2015 UTC,"I would say you are technically correct in what you stated, however it would be more accurate to differentiate games' budgets based on how much was spent on actual development, and on marketing. Just a quick search finds a list of most expensive video games. Destiny is listed at 140 million (nothing for marketing cost). CoD:MW2 is listed at 50 million dev, and 200 million marketing.   I don't see SC needing a large marketing budget, as all of its 85+ million backers have already pledged their wallets, and the 927,467 Citizens is a large number of people that can spread via word of mouth. Not to mention how many people are still sitting on their hands, waiting to see how it all plays out.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_video_games_to_develop"
Games,3dzter,GreenElite87,27,Tue Jul 21 14:44:36 2015 UTC,"Except those same goals are how AAA titles get canned all the time. The difference is instead of being canned for wasting a AAA publishers money they're continuing to take money from backers to accomplish a pipe dream. By the time star citizen is released it will not achieve its goals. Because it's scope has and will always be too big. This is classic I want the world in a video game, and forgetting the world can't be replicated entirely. But attempting to do so and creating unrealistic expectations.   The project is too big to be released while it's still wanted. It'll end up a niche game that's taken money from a plethora of backers."

If you don't want to dedicate an hour to watching this then check us out here.  http://imperialnews.network/2015/07/10-chairman-episode-60/  (note that the transcript is still in progress because this one is super long)  edit: Done!
Games,3dzter,greenlittleapple,4,Mon Jul 20 23:13:11 2015 UTC,Thanks Dolvak! I had no idea you ran both the subreddit and INN :P
Games,3dzter,Dolvak,5,Mon Jul 20 23:15:45 2015 UTC,A few months ago I realized the subreddit was pretty much on autopilot and I wanted to jump into content production. I pretty much knew the INN guys already from the subreddit so we make a pretty solid team. They are all a bunch of maniacs that put over 40 hours a week into various INN ventures. I dread the actual game coming out because we can barely keep up now.
Games,3dzter,greenlittleapple,6,Mon Jul 20 23:20:24 2015 UTC,"Hehe I just want to say that I appreciate both the subreddit and INN, keep it up! :)"
Games,3dzter,Sawgon,5,Mon Jul 20 23:21:47 2015 UTC,"Hey Dolvak. I have a question. Is there a quick summary on some of the big recent changes? I bought an Avenger over a year ago but I have stopped looking into it so as to not get hyped and have to wait.  Basically, is there a ""This has happened since <date>"" for me to look at?"
Games,3dzter,Dolvak,4,Tue Jul 21 01:28:43 2015 UTC,yes actually I did this last week!  http://imperialnews.network/2015/07/state-game-year-date-july-2015/  This is a summery of every big event this year and we are going to be doing these monthly from now on.  Look at the links in that page for specific write ups on those subjects we did that go farther in depth.
Games,3dzter,Sawgon,5,Tue Jul 21 01:31:59 2015 UTC,"Nice, thanks for the link! Will you be doing something for the ships as well? Like I wrote before, I bought an Avenger. Would be nice to see if it was nerfed or buffed and how it now works in combat. When I bought it, it didn't exist in the simulator."
Games,3dzter,Dolvak,3,Tue Jul 21 01:40:55 2015 UTC,yes sir! we have a ship section that is still being worked on. http://imperialnews.network/starships/  If the info you want isn't there we will add it in time. If you have any requests please me an email at dolvak@gmail.com or a reddit pm. We are always on the hunt for more content ideas.
Games,3dzter,Sawgon,172,Tue Jul 21 01:43:26 2015 UTC,"Man, that's awesome. Great work!"
Games,3dzter,Raddekopp,12,Tue Jul 21 02:04:55 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is incredible! Thank you for that."
Games,3dzter,greenlittleapple,0,Tue Jul 21 09:15:26 2015 UTC,"I think what /r/Games and the Reddit community should notice is that Star Citizen is probably the most transparent and open game in the game industry. They put out monthly, weekly, and even daily updates for the game and its progress that reveal the bugs, development, and inside details of the team such as meeting devs and weekly summaries.  Many people say that ""Star Citizen is never going to come out, it's already been 3 years!"". What they don't realize is that, compared to other titles, they're not even close to being overdue. Others seem to think that delays are unique to only Star Citizen. They don't know that the game industry is full of delays but games don't usually announce them, as many AAA titles don't show their development progress to the whole world, while Star Citizen does.  I'm tired of all the false lies and misinformation about the game and I wanted to help clarify some info. Thanks for reading!"
Games,3dzter,Artemis317,83,Mon Jul 20 23:05:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed, It should be noted that Fallout 4 should be added to that list seeing that this is a title that /r/games is very excited over the announcement and release later this year.  Fallout 4 took 7 years of development that was only rumored through out the years.  After the information of Fallout 4 I would go as far to say that Star Citizen, at its current scope may arrive ahead of schedule seeing all the work that is progressing so far."
Games,3dzter,VintageSin,38,Tue Jul 21 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"Except fallout 4 is a game to be rightly skeptical about. Is it skyrim in the Fallout universe or is it a next gen Bethesda title. We just don't know yet. All of the features we saw had roots in the modding community. So saying that's similar to a game with no series backing it, a lack of a game company showing its brass in game development, and riding it's hope on a dream of a single figurehead is much different.   Bethesda's 7 year dev cycle also include developer shifts and teams moving in and out. Something Star citizen doesn't have to deal with. It's one game with multiple teams on multiple modules. Bethesda game studios is multiple games with multiple teams on a plethora of modules. Bethesda didn't just work on fallout 4. They worked on fo3 dlc, skyrim, skyrim dlc, fallout shelter, and fallout 4. And this is excluding the different modules of each game."
Games,3dzter,seiferinfinitus,8,Tue Jul 21 07:44:40 2015 UTC,Except they kind of have to be transparent considering the amount of money that is funded by the PUBLIC and not the publishers like most other games. It would be a PR nightmare should the amount of money already put forward never show any result. I'm talking these people would never be welcomed in this industry ever again.
Games,3dzter,tinnedwaffles,0,Mon Jul 20 23:11:55 2015 UTC,"Not to mention being transparent does have its disadvantages.  I wanna cite Planetside 2. Early on and throughout had a crazy amount of dev interaction. Weekly peeks into WIP stuff and all sorts. Even until recently before SOE became DBG devs would literally stream them making the bases and maps. You'd see their whole engine software and all the assets and even work in progress prototype visualization stuff with city maps and floating islands and shit that have never (and perhaps may never) come to light again.  But alas all that means jack shit. What matters is delivery. Everything else is just to appease the short attention span of those looking forward to more content. And then theres all the reddit posts and community drama where people drag up old content or ""promises"". After seeing all the drama and the ups and downs of /r/planetside I can safely say I never wanna deal with that shit as a dev lol  Plus.. it sorta takes a lil bit of the magic away you know. That part where you're not 100% sure where the map ends in a game. But I guess spoilers are at ones own discretion.  Of course keeping people up to date is probably more important in Star Citizens case since.. its a lil more light on actual game than one that launched 3 years ago or whatever. How much time and money is spent on keeping the community in the loop though.  But alas I am just a random internet mans and SC has already proved its crazy bizarro system of selling ships whilst they're concept art and such actually freaking works if thats how they roll then it sorta stinks up my whole pseudo suggestion of going dark until launch, an idea that ignores basic marketing statistics, look totally fuckin stupid. Which it is. Which it is. Thanks for reading. Sucker."
Games,3dzter,Trojanbp,14,Tue Jul 21 00:06:54 2015 UTC,"I love Planetside 2 and the team but I agree that they talked and hypothesized too much.  It was obvious there was mismanagement and some questionable priorities.  They cut back on the transparency greatly to, IMO, an acceptable level. Players still demand them to be more open and they give some answers but nothing that's too far out of possibility"
Games,3dzter,Artemis317,10,Tue Jul 21 00:58:46 2015 UTC,"I also agree, as a SC backer, CIG personally chose to be this transparent.  But I also wonder how far along the project would be if the time that was spent writing and recording daily updates and quelling mass community drama, was spent on focusing on building the game and nothing more.  I wonder what would be different if CIG started StarCitizen topsecret like Bathesda did with Fallout4  Would it be out by now? Who knows.  What I do know is, is that CIG would not have been able to secure ~85 million dollars for development if it went with it bieng a private secret project.  Some evil is necessary in any industry, its the way the world works."
Games,3dzter,DougyAM,-5,Tue Jul 21 03:10:43 2015 UTC,"But I also wonder how far along the project would be if the time that was spent writing and recording daily updates and quelling mass community drama, was spent on focusing on building the game and nothing more.   Generally speaking in most games these community relations are done by actual full time PR people who don't/can't work on other parts of the game to speed up progress.  Also keep in mind that a lot of Star Citizen is being sub divided between multiple studios including 3rd parties and most managers would not allow their team to spend too long chatting about the game online when they are missing targets etc.  Meanwhile a PR persons sole job is to keep talking about the game and keeping people interested even if its falling behind in other areas.   I wonder what would be different if CIG started StarCitizen topsecret like Bathesda did with Fallout4 Would it be out by now? Who knows.   As you say it simply would not have generated that amount of funds, SC only exists because the sheer amount of money they have raised from crowd funding. Chris Roberts has said quite a few times that Star Citizen only came around because it was possible to fund the game without having a publisher hanging over his head demanding X, Y and Z."
Games,3dzter,Stalzy,6,Tue Jul 21 03:39:36 2015 UTC,"They don't have to be anything. An idea was pitched by a prominent space game developer. Someone with years of early experience. He's always had the vision, he lives and breathes it.   And I'm just going to assume. 75% would love that fantastical space sim with all the bells and whistles.   People would still back it and continue to follow even if they are quieter. We are all wishing and hoping that this dream comes true."
Games,3dzter,seiferinfinitus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 04:21:32 2015 UTC,"What do you mean ""they don't have to be anything"". They proposed an idea that many people have BOUGHT INTO with their money.

Games,3dzter,kalanosh,10,Tue Jul 21 05:35:09 2015 UTC,"It doesn't matter if its transparent or not. They are already claiming its a scam regardless of how transparent you are. The game didn't spin up development right away, it not even in its 3 year in and people....especially people who havent bought into it but even backers are already complaining. The company made it clear it would take time to develop.   If the past years have shown many on many games...the more open and transparent the more vile and inpatient the gamers are. Also how hypocritical.  We always said developers push them too much for deadlines, take away their ability to make the game they want instead of what the publisher sales numbers are. We always assumed publisher took the control away and put too much pressure to develop games that are already hard work, we criticize companies and their crunch times.   Oh boy but have Early Access and Kickerstarters prove gamers are just as bad, maybe worse. I can't think of one game thats been delayed thats open and transparent that didn't gather a shitstorm. If not gamers there is the media to pick on them real quick to get the gamers upset.   We even demand developer stick around during the weekend if a game gets a quick new build to their alpha on a thursday or friday for hotfixes. We push deadlines all the time and scream for balances, bug fixes, and contents ALL at the same time.   Community as a whole is a damn cesspool. Its redeeming qualities of the gaming community is when a multiplayer game is good...it can be fantastic with other players."
Games,3dzter,____Atlas____,17,Tue Jul 21 05:37:14 2015 UTC,"The Star Citizen community seems alright, it is just the general gaming community that is a bit more negative."
Games,3dzter,Kommissar_Lyus,13,Tue Jul 21 06:52:54 2015 UTC,Not to mention that Star Citizen is technically 2 games in 1. Squadron 42 and Star Citizen. A single player campaign and an MMO.
Games,3dzter,DougyAM,10,Tue Jul 21 03:11:51 2015 UTC,"An MMO with multiple genres within, the FPS section, the Space sim section, planetary exploration etc.  If SC ends up delivering on half the stuff they have set out to do its going to be worth the wait."
Games,3dzter,VintageSin,2,Tue Jul 21 03:44:41 2015 UTC,People say that last bit a lot. On a lot of games. Except every time a game delivers half of what they promised it  is ALWAYS a game that feels incomplete. You can't have a facet be a part of the main design and then not deliver it. Mmos have proven this time and time again.   Star Citizen will not be the game backers wanted when it's released. And it won't be released anytime soon if it's done correctly.
Games,3dzter,hessian_tank,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:39:40 2015 UTC,"Star Citizen will not be the game backers wanted when it's released.   Definitely not, since almost every backer is guilty of theory-crafting every aspect to death.   If CIG says ""You'll soon be able to put a logo decal on your ship"" then the backers will glee about how they're going to be able to find paint in game, mix any mix of colours, design stencils, spacewalk around their ship and paint their whole ship in razzle-dazzle camoflague all in first person.  When what CIG probably meant to say is that some ships have the option of having the ship branded with the manufacturer's logo."
Games,3dzter,hessian_tank,-18,Tue Jul 21 12:49:49 2015 UTC,"If SC ends up delivering on half the stuff they have set out to do its going to be worth the wait.   Unfortunately if they deliver half of each module it probably won't be worth the wait.  I'd much rather 3 more-or-less complete modules than 6 incomplete shallow modules.  That being said, I'd be okay with having the FPS portion be bare-bones if that means that the PU is feature complete.  If I had my way, I'd forgo the squadron 42 stuff they're doing"

Games,3dzter,RscMrF,2,Tue Jul 21 01:17:39 2015 UTC,"I think because it has so much potential and people are so excited about it, whenever anyone speculates negatively about the game, other people get upset about it and over react.  Most of the comments against the game are usually prefaced with, ""I really hope this game does well but..."" People are not against it so much as cautious about the grand promises and wary of the new and outlandish financial aspects and development procedures.   Basically, this game requires a bit of faith, and a lot of gamers are jaded from years of seeing big promises fall flat. Now, here is where someone would say that, CIG is different and all you need to do is watch to see how passionate they are and all that, but everyone claims to be new and different and consumer focused, until they are not.  I really have no opinion personally, I am not buying into it now, because I personally don't have the money or the inclination to finance a game in development, but if I see something I like and want to buy when it comes out, I will."
Games,3dzter,Alagos77,7,Tue Jul 21 01:45:56 2015 UTC,"Is it really a bad thing to be sceptical? Crowdfunding is even worse than preordering when it comes to actually getting the game you want for your money. Preordering at least gets you a game even if it's crap, pledging doesn't and you have to trust the developer to deliver what was promised.    I've backed SC but those that have looked at it and decided against it also have my full support. If it's informed criticism it's really nothing to feel bad about. In the best case scenario they will buy the game when it comes out because they are obviously already interested in it - in the worst case, they won't have wasted money on something they didn't trust.    However, the one thing I can't stand is stupid drama over nothing like what happened in the last week. The game won't be out for another year or two, it would be nice if everyone would just calm down, let them work and see how it turns out."
Games,3dzter,VintageSin,3,Tue Jul 21 13:07:16 2015 UTC,So could Daikatana. We're against it because it's believing  in a hope of a single person along with a new development studio without roots in the current gaming scene.   Every single person  has a right to be skeptical about this game even being decent. And with current events and design goals it's unlikely this game will be anything that the fans expect.

I can't think of very many games that have had tons of hype about their extensive scope and delivered on everything, while many good-but-not-revolutionary examples come to mind.  So I'm more against the hype. I'd rather be surprised by the game's quality than disappointed that it doesn't reach all its incredibly ambitious goals with the level of polish that hype demands."

Seeing all the details of the development, good and bad, makes them even more anxious, and they don't want to wait.  As the top post said, this game isn't even near being overdue and I'm actually surprised how playable it is this early.

It's bad when every time Chris gives out a deadline people are like ""Oh sweet, I can't wait to play it {two months after deadline}"". Nobody is asking him for deadlines, he's willingly giving them out then not hitting them.

During PAX for the updated Star Marine presentation he stated that he'd of like to release it on that day but pushed it back a couple of weeks to polish up some animations then it'd be out.  That was back in March.  Then we knew their target date was April 15th because an employee accidentally left their Gira log in info in a patch and someone screen capped their dead lines and posted it on the SC sub-reddit.  It's now closing in on August and we still don't have it.  I know the reasons for why it was delayed.  I follow the SC sub-reddit and news quite well.  CR had given a deadline though.  And in his recent interview with Game Nexus he gave another fairly narrow ball park estimate for release.

I mean you can be pedantic if you want about ""we were hoping to release"" but the second part ""why we're going to be releasing it in 2 to 3 weeks time."" is definitely a release window.    If you told someone it would be released in 2-3 weeks at the beginning of March and it's now coming on to August?

THAT is why people say star citizen is slow, because it is.   All this time and they still don't have more than just ""modules"" just bits of the game with nothing connecting them together yet, and they are spending time implementing these secondary features, like the FPS, in their space game when they don't even have a space game yet.  And sure SC is working on some ambitious things that ED doesn't have, like planets, but frontier is also working on them, and at the speed RSI moves I'd bet dollars to doughnuts ED will get them first.  And I don't even particularly like ED, but people are annoyed with Roberts because in less time, with less resources an extremely similar game has FAR more to show for itself.

Games,3dzter,Backflip_into_a_star,2,Tue Jul 21 01:46:21 2015 UTC,"Elite Dangerous is arguably unfinished and was released too early. There is barely the background sim we were promised, and the game world is devoid of actual ""life"" to it. The game is literally about grinding for credits so you can get a better ship to grind more credits. They released earlier with a half ass game, with half ass mmo features that still do not work properly. The game can barely be called an mmo because you will rarely ever see more than 10 people in one area unless you specifically meet there, and even then there are sync issues. A huge amount of people play in Solo, because of this and that the game has no compelling reason to play in Open. I won't even get started on PowerPlay, but it was a huge grindy disappointment.  Sure, ED might  get to planets first but the scope of ED is already so shallow in comparison for what is planned in SC. We have already seen some of the planetary areas for SC, and we have seen nothing about it for ED. Sc has shown off actual NPC's walking around hubs, going about their business. They have showed in-game the way landing will work, how the fps will work, etc. The ground work is clearly there. We only recently got pilots to show up in cockpits in ED and there has been no further information about FPS or planets. Furthermore, planets and fps will not solve ED's existing problems or lack of actual content."

Games,3dzter,MinorThreat89,8,Tue Jul 21 01:36:15 2015 UTC,"50k salary is VERY VERY low. You need to also add the additional costs of employment (software licenses, office space, etc).   Normally 100k per employee per year is a better guess. While game decelopment is a sweatshop condition, I still think they are closer to that value than to 50k."
Games,3dzter,DougyAM,4,Tue Jul 21 06:11:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah,overheads can add more than something like an additional 100% onto the cost of hiring someone. Then you have employment taxes, benefits etc etc..."
Games,3dzter,cipahs,4,Tue Jul 21 07:24:51 2015 UTC,"After it gets released the majority of people will already own the game, so they will make a fraction of what they already got.   As Emmanuelvr stated the actual backer count is relatively low at only roughly 1m people, if Star Citizen turns out to be even half of what they have aimed for then there will be a ton of interest from gamers not already involved in the backing."

Games,3dzter,thoomfish,4,Mon Jul 20 23:07:20 2015 UTC,Selling 300$ spaceships is as close to printing money as most games get.
Games,3dzter,Seamalicious,16,Tue Jul 21 00:44:28 2015 UTC,But delivering those spaceships is going to require doing a tremendous amount of work and spending most of the money they've raised. So it's not 'free'.
Games,3dzter,Zohaas,7,Tue Jul 21 02:25:04 2015 UTC,"It's free when you compare it to how people usually raise this kind of money. Usually sums of this size would be borrowed, and accrue interest. Roberts doesn't have to do this. He's literally gotten the money to make his product for free, now he just has deliver the product."
Games,3dzter,Caspus,4,Tue Jul 21 04:25:08 2015 UTC,You mean promising a publisher that you'll do something so they fund you? Seems the same to me.
Games,3dzter,Clutter,2,Tue Jul 21 07:50:00 2015 UTC,"Given the response by the internet to delays and design changes - justified or otherwise - I'm completely confident that very few, if any, AAA games would risk it.  ""Hey, instead of us having to answer to a publishing house, let's make it so a couple million people think they have oversight over us and act like armchair developers whenever we don't immediately respond to their concerns to a degree they are satisfied by.""  I don't understand how people have enough free time and money to be a backer of this game and care so much about every single iota of the development process to the point of getting whipped into a frenzy on a daily basis. It sounds terribly exhausting and I can't imagine having to deal with that kind of stress.  And then there's the sharkbaiting that is games media and, to a certain extent, subreddits like this. My approach to this game, as a backer of the Alpha who signed up intending to test systems, is to go about my business until changes pop up, jump in game, do some testing, provide feedback and go on my merry way. But every viewpoint I see outside of /r/starcitizen concerning this game falls into one of two camps: actively hoping the game fails because of some perceived slight of business ethics or development, and those actively hoping the game fails so that they can prop up their ego by knowing it would fail all along.  It's some of the most short-sighted, self-aggrandizing, low-effort shite I've seen by communities of people who keep saying ""Why aren't developers more open about the game-making process? Why don't they treat us like our voices matter? Why can't we be a bigger part of the development process?""  Because the gaming community is vitriolic, hyper-sensitive, and suffering from a massive inferiority complex. This is probably why Shenmue 3 is being paid for with Sony money as much as with Kickstarter backing: They get all the money to pay to build the game they want without having to deal with reporting to their ""backers"" and dealing with the banality that Star Citizen's team has to on an almost daily basis."
Games,3dzter,greenlittleapple,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:28 2015 UTC,"I don't understand how people have enough free time and money to be a backer of this game and care so much about every single iota of the development process   Right? I've backed a few KS/EA games like Prison Architect and FTL. Bought, toyed with the current build a bit to see if the game was as good as I hoped, and then forgot about them for months. I only ever think about PA when I'm on reddit and someone decides to shit on EA games in general, and I likely won't play it again until 1.0 releases. Who are these people with the spare time and wear-withal to sit on a game subreddit and complain day in and day out for years?"
Games,3dzter,manafount,2,Tue Jul 21 04:47:48 2015 UTC,"I love how almost everything they do (development issues, bugs, works in progress, etc.) is all revealed to the public so everyone gets a clear idea what's going on.

Games,3dzter,cipahs,3,Mon Jul 20 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"I hate to run counter to the overwhelming circlejerk here, but the ""transparency"" they provide to the public is only notable because the game is publicly-funded.  If they were traditionally funded, they would have companies, banks, and investors that actively oversaw the distribution of funds and project deliverables on a day-to-day basis.   Did they have to provide any transparency? Legally, no. Is it nice that they're providing some? Sure. But giving out editorialized tidbits on project status is much closer to a facebook feed than actual oversight."

I'm trying to counter the actual circlejerk.  I'm just saying that I'm impressed with the level of updates that Star Citizen gives, ranging from daily updates about the workday to the monthly, detailed reports on what has been accomplished."

Games,3dzter,manafount,4,Tue Jul 21 03:27:23 2015 UTC,"OK, excluding this thread, in many ""journalist"" sites like Kotaku and PCGamer, and in some subreddits, there has been plenty of bashing of Roberts and CIG as ""cashgrabbers"" and ""vaporware"", especially in the (oh god) comment sections."
Games,3dzter,cipahs,15,Tue Jul 21 03:33:50 2015 UTC,"I guess that's just where our fundamental differences of opinion lie.  I'm of the mind that the onus of responsibility is on CIG to prove that they're capable of delivering their game. Constantly missing deadlines isn't a good way to do that.   Like it or not, SC got to where it was today on the back of the launch and meteoric rise of Kickstarter and crowd-funding. Its success (or failure) has huge ramifications for crowd-funding of gaming projects in the future."
Games,3dzter,ultramarine8,2,Tue Jul 21 03:43:14 2015 UTC,They already have the voice acting done for single-player and the motion capture.   Just the voice acting scenes combined with heavy motion capture is six hours.   For single player.   Plus that leak showed a shit ton of content

Games,3dzter,greenlittleapple,6,Tue Jul 21 06:13:31 2015 UTC,"This is why I laugh when people say the game won't be completed or is delayed indefinitely. If they can have this level of communication in the midst of development it's safe to say the finished product is well on its way.  Whether the game will be all it's claimed is another matter entirely, all I want is fun FPS, really."

Games,3dzter,TehFence,3,Mon Jul 20 23:11:05 2015 UTC,"At this stage it's kind of funny to see people calling a project that's set up multiple studios and released a regularly updated test version as a scam.  Also I'd argue that lots of games now are never finished, if anything adapting the phrase ""a piece of art game is never finished, just abandoned"". Is EVE finished? TF2? WoW? DOTA?  They've been open from the start that the project would be delivered in chunks as they were ready, and being a non traditional project lets them do that rather than needing to hit a normal 'full' release, and if you want a 'full' copy of SC then you can get that if you wait until they've put out something that you're comfortable with."

Games,3dzter,tweeto23,4,Tue Jul 21 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"Star Citizen really highlights that the gaming community truly doesnt know what it wants.  Every time a AAA game is announced, that doesnt innovate much, if at all, and instead just relies on tried and tested formulas, the community rolls its eyes.  But when a company really seems to be trying to do something new, all that happens is people try and tear it down. Especially if it relies on an alternative funding model.  It seems the only way to gain the favour of the community is to be a solo indie dev making side scrolling games. Otherwise youre either flooding the market with yearly releases, or stealing peoples money using kickstarter.  The industry could do with more people like the guys at Cloud Imperium, Hello Games, even Dean Hall and dare i say it, Molyneux himself. Innovation comes with risk, and we'd do better as a community if we embraced the people who at least try to do it, regardless of our personal opinions of the projects."

Then came the crazy macro transactions and p2w/p2p alpha modules which shows how this game will most likely end up,  pay and pay again,  like destiny or vanilla D3 but even worse since they at least release a game first and started demanding money later (or unnecessary features).   I would love to see and other great space Sim,  but this is not it.  It could have been,  once,  but try to be everything and you'll fail at being anything worth mentioning..."

Right now the game comes down to whoever is using a mouse wins. The ship pretty much flies itself, you just tell the ""AI"" where to fly with the mouse - no actual axis inputs."

I think you're probably not going to have to grind for ships, but the expensive ones will be difficult to attain and will be attainable only through actual hard work (like rising to be a leader, being a rich trader, being a really good pirate).  To answer your 2nd question, I believe you can switch the ships for little / no cost as seen in the Aurora variants. In the Aurora trailer they show the customizable parts of the Aurora and basically retrofit it. The internal components like boosters, cargo racks, weapons, and even chairs are interchangeable as seen in the trailer."

What I mean is that you won't be able to buy any unfair advantages or unlocks with IRL money, and while you can buy in-game credits with money, there's a very limited cap on that.   Sounds like grind to me :-)   I worded that horribly, I meant that you don't have to spend hours upon hours wasting away and meaningless tasks doing something to attain a ship, and as /u/Dolvak explained below, you can literally go from a starter ship to the biggest ship within an hour if you find an unlucky person and hijack their ship without anyone seeing."

Progression isn't just getting better ships and gear either; There is too much variety in ships already available for any one to get the crown in ship-good-ness (which is now a word)   If it does take a long time to ""progress"" the real question should be: Is the time inbetween progressions worth it? Or will i get bored and be inclined to spend money to speed things up so i can finally enjoy myself again?   The second answer would be what we do not want the game to be.

Games,3dym2s,Zeholipael,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:25 2015 UTC,It really just feels like more a free demo than a true F2P model. But it's pretty darn close.

You get the base game completely free and 1 free character is on rotation every week, even DLC characters. You want a specific character? Buy them individually for about $5 a go.  Its by far the best and easiest F2P model I have seen. I didn't want all the characters so i got only the ones i want."

Appologies to any Mortal Kombat enthusiasts. I have no idea if that is one of Sub Zero's fatalities because I don't play Mortal Kombat due to above-mentioned difficulties.

I don't really think this analogy works and I don't really agree that having to input things like quarter circles is a bad thing in fighting games. Fighting games don't need that type of input system of course, but passing it off as a bad system seems silly.   Do w/e you wanna do. Game looks interesting and I'll be happy to play it."
Games,3dym2s,biyabo,2,Mon Jul 20 20:34:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, it does work. If you have to move your mouse in a circle to throw a grenade, it means you are physically committed to throwing it and cannot use your mouse for aiming your gun, for instance. In the same way that you cannot be walking back and shoryuken instantly; the motions do factor into gameplay as a means of forcing players to commit to an action."
Games,3dym2s,ArmyOfDix,37,Mon Jul 20 20:19:07 2015 UTC,"Actually, it doesn't work.  You're already committed to throwing the grenade by switching from your gun, and your aim is adjusted to throw the grenade.  Ever seen someone bring a grenade to a gunfight and come out on top?  Trust me, the system already has enough risk vs reward."

It seems like this game is being made as an experiment, to see if a fighting game with a lower input barrier can be as good or successful as a comparable quarter circle, half circle, etc. fighting game. As someone's who never played a fighting game with a serious input barrier, this kind of experiment really interests me."
Games,3dym2s,Hyper_Inferno,3,Tue Jul 21 14:11:00 2015 UTC,"I think the important thing to remember is Seth concedes that there are tactical considerations in motions. He just doesn't think that they necessarily make a better game in and of themselves.   “I don’t know if Counter-Strike would be better if, you know, to throw a grenade you had to do a 360 motion with the mouse,” says Killian. “You could make that game, and it would change the game, and that would have impact on gameplay, but does it make it a better game? Not that I can tell.”   The fact that you have to physically press forward, then down, then down-forward to do a Shoryuken definitely has an impact on gameplay (can't do a Shoryuken while holding down, there's an additional input time when performing the move at neutral), but does that make the game better or just different compared to just being able to press a button and having a Shoryuken come out? For example, Yu in Persona 4 Arena has a two button Shoryuken. Is the game worse because of it, or just different?  Most importantly, simplified control schemes are probably one of the biggest draws to some of the more popular fighting games. Melee and Smash 4 are two huge examples of that. Sure, there's some trick stuff to do in both games (Wavedashing in Melee for example), but that's not stuff that a new player is going to instantly have to deal with immediately unlike trying to get Ryu to do a Shoryuken or even a Hadoken (well, unless they pick Ryu in Smash 4). And with greater popularity means more money, which means more development time to make a better game down the line.  Even with single button specials, you can still get tactical considerations because of the input itself. Balrog in the Street Fighter series commonly has a move that requires the player to press and hold all three of their punch or kick buttons for X amount of time to get varying strengths of an attack. While the buttons are held, he can't do any punch/kick attacks depending. Players in current games have the benefit of being able to macro 3P or 3K to a single button as opposed to having to use their wrist or other hand shenanigans to hold the buttons down. Thus, a single button move that locks the player out of some other options in their moveset.  It's also worth noting that even Street Fighter V is reducing the complexity of their motions likely because they're facing the same issues with players being simply unable to do them. They're not eliminating them full stop, but 360 motions are in fact gone from the game."

I will say that I've taken a lot of people who can't do anything into USFIV's multi-player training mode and had them flawlessly doing the motions after < 10 minutes. Even people that railed on the 'execution barrier' conceded once they were properly 'taught.' People over complicate the QCF or DP motion. It's super easy if you're shown how. In Third Strike using fightcade, I got people that never played fighting games before to low forward into fireball into super fireball in an actual fight in under an hour.   It's easy, you just have to be shown how to do it."
Games,3dym2s,TheMancersDilema,2,Mon Jul 20 19:19:14 2015 UTC,"Not to mention using motions gives you room for more variety for specials and normals. Normal 6 button layouts can give you as many as 30-40 different moves from just a button and a direction and you still get on average 3 variations of special moves for as many 6+ simple motions.  Especially for games with Uniel, Blazeblue, and KoF which use 4 buttons in order to give every character the all the tools you want them to have access too while still keeping a simple button layout that's easy to digest motions are mandatory.  One of the appeals of those games to me is that I have a button for each finger and I never have to worry about shifting my fingers and hitting the wrong button or combination (yeah I stop doing it after a while but I'll still goof it up if I'm out of practice).  At the end of the day, there's  nothing inherently wrong with mapping specials to buttons but there's likely going to be a price to pay in overall variety."

And considering that the various strengths of specials have their own separate areas of usefulness in varying situations (which isn't possible to achieve in smash without using an analogue stick) Ryu by himself has 9 individual specials without touching on EX variations, which some characters have multiples of based on button combinations.  And not a single one of these specials hinders the available buttons for normals. So they still get as many as 10+ normals per button.  Now again, you can go ahead and choose to not give your characters as many options, and that's not going to make the game bad by default so long as it's all even but don't tell me that you aren't giving them up. For someone that likes playing with a full deck of cards if some one takes all the hearts out I'm gonna notice that shit."

Games,3dym2s,gamelord12,63,Tue Jul 21 12:41:20 2015 UTC,"You just assume people can do this, [but] put any fighting game kiosk out on a showfloor somewhere and watch people absolutely fail, all day, every day, to actually do the moves we’ve built the whole game around. So the core of the game, the basic elements of the game, are hidden behind an execution wall, and not like a little execution wall, either. To do it, not in the sense that ‘I have technically performed this move,’ but to do it without thinking about it, which is the way you need to be able to do it to really play—that’s like, for some people, a month, because they’re really talented. For most people, more like six months—between three and six months. And in some cases a year—or never—of playing them a lot, before you have the moves.   It seems a lot of fighting game fans don't understand this at all.  They act as though quarter circle motions are the easiest thing in the world, but they're just not.  I introduced a friend to Street Fighter IV on a fight stick last month (and he plays a ton of games, even competitive ones), and he struggled to pull off even a fireball, let alone a dragon punch.  Hell, I've logged about 30 hours into SFIV, and I still screw up Ibuki's half circle punch about 30% of the time.  Removing the input barrier is something I've wanted fighting games to do for a long time, but they're mostly still stuck in old trends established by arcades in the late 80s and early 90s."
Games,3dym2s,mountlover,21,Mon Jul 20 19:30:29 2015 UTC,"The thing is that the motions aren't arbitrary for difficulty's sake, they are deliberately chosen to represent the risk/reward/execution balancing act of the move. If you do a quarter circle forward or shoryuken motion, or a double qcf, you can't also hold back to block. This is intentional to make you think twice before buffering the inputs (can I execute this move before getting hit?). Charge moves make it extremely difficult to pressure your opponent and use them at the same time, often running the risk of turtling or getting yourself cornered when committing to them too much. Trying to take the advantage with a character like Guile or Decapre in SFIV is a very difficult balancing act of walking forward and finding ways of maintaining a charge. The full circle (and for supers, double full circle) is usually reserved for massively damaging, unblockable command grabs, and forces the player to abandon any kind of nuanced movement for that instant in order to execute. It's essentially the ""hail mary"" of special move inputs, and usually has to be hidden behind a jump or some move with a moderately long recovery animation.  Being able to execute a DP or an SPD at the touch of a button would drastically change the application of the move. Such a game would make it so that you could never try an unsafe jump-in (as S.Kill mentioned) or a non-tight blockstring without eating a 1-button special. You'd have to design the entire game around this in order to avoid opening up a different can of having to memorize frame data and the like.  It's an interesting idea for a fighting game to try to remove the execution barrier (Divekick has already achieved this pretty well), but there's a reason why fighting games have them in the first place."
Games,3dym2s,MyBodyIsReddit,6,Mon Jul 20 16:41:27 2015 UTC,"Many people don't understand that different inputs make a difference in how fighting game characters play. The article The Role of Execution highlights this. Take Zangief in Street Fighter 4 for example. His super and ultras are inputted with two 360 degree motions. This is difficult because moving the stick in a circle causes you to hit the up direction, and will make gief jump instead of doing the super/ultra. So to perform the move, players must ""buffer"" it by inputting it during another animation such as a special or a jump. When Zangief jumps at you, it's very scary because he could be ready to pull of an ultra, because you know he has to buffer the move to make it work.   Another example, which is talked about in the article, is Ken vs Fei Long. When Ken is walking forward, he is much scarier than Fei. While pressing forward, he can easily go into Shoryuken (forward, down, downforward+punch) or stepkick (forward+medium kick). Fei Long on the other hand, isn't as dangerous because he can't do his rekka (down, downforward, forward+punch) or his dragon kick (back, down, downback+kick) out of a walk forward motion.   The issue is that people look at fighting games inputs and think that they're complex for the sake of being complex. That is partially true since fighting games started out in the arcade scene where games were purposefully hard to get more quarters out of players, but it's not the sole reason. Having varied and tricky inputs allows for more variation between character types like shotos, grapplers, charge characters, etc."

Games,3dym2s,HemingwayHeroes,4,Mon Jul 20 19:37:10 2015 UTC,There is a bunch of fighting games with lower execution barriers like Mortal Kombat for example is very easy to play on a pad. Most of the combos are just buffered string inputs into special cancels.

Games,3dym2s,HemingwayHeroes,10,Mon Jul 20 21:25:55 2015 UTC,Plus there is shortcuts for stick inputs. The SRK input for example can be done with a quarter circle and a half quater on a pad.

Games,3dym2s,Kasonic,5,Mon Jul 20 22:22:38 2015 UTC,"It's not about remembering the motions.  I haven't played a fighting game in years and I know all the motions.  It's about remembering that these motions on this character create totally different results and are used at different times from this character and then this guy uses charge moves and...  These create a high skill floor without raising the skill ceiling.  And the more gamers hit 30 and realize they can't spend 10 hours a week working on their Guile, the less fighting games get played.  Things like required positioning and pauses like MyBodyIsReddit and mountlover mention above can be implemented without involving those silly 360 motions."
Games,3dym2s,gamelord12,6,Tue Jul 21 17:42:46 2015 UTC,"That's great and all, but it would be even better if you can implement that risk/reward in a motion that someone could learn in a minute or less.  Super Smash Bros. does a great job of this, and I know the objective and overall design of that game is very different from Street Fighter, but it's worth noting that plenty of companies just looked at Street Fighter and did more of that rather than trying to solve that input problem in a unique way like Super Smash Bros. did."
Games,3dym2s,mountlover,5,Mon Jul 20 23:59:04 2015 UTC,"There are other approaches for this.  Divekick solved the problem in a spectacularly simple and elegant way.  Mortal Kombat has always had more simplified inputs, and the reason they were able to do so was by segregating blocking out into a separate button.  Marvel vs Capcom 1 introduced an ""Easy"" mode whereby any special, super or chain could be executed without having to move the joystick.  Street Fighter x Tekken borrowed from that idea by giving every character a universal 1 button chain combo."

Smash requires no complex inputs to do the actual moves, the complex inputs are necessary mostly for movement and more indept stuff (like DI) that don't really affect the casual crowd.  A casual player might be turned off that he/she can't do a fireball in Street Fighter. But in Smash people are happy to be able to perform any move by the press of a buttom, and won't even know about the existence of wavedashing a l-canceling so they won't care that they can't perform it."

The fact that Melee is still evolving 14 years after release is a testament to its longevity.   I honestly get bored watching Melee. There are only so many Fox matchups I can stand watching.   This has actually improved recently. Samus, sheik, marth, pikachu, fox, falco, puff, climbers were all represented in the top 8. The reason you see so much more variety out of 4 is because the game is new. The meta will settle eventually and the variety will be reduced as happens with every game.  From what I watched also, the game seemed much less offensive and slow. The fact that players only start with 2 lives instead of 4 should be the first indicator of this.

I mean, sure, they probably do for some players, but that's nothing compared to the barrier of memorizing and carving into your muscle memory a string of commands with 1-frame input windows needed to get maximum damage out of a combo. Obviously that doesn't describe every fighting game but I'm pretty sure there's a lot you can do to lower the execution barrier that has nothing to do with any of your points here."
Games,3dym2s,mountlover,6,Tue Jul 21 03:52:53 2015 UTC,"I was only responding to the comment above me claiming that games only have these inputs because this is how street fighter 2 did it in the arcades.  Of course there are tons of other complex systems that stand between casual players and fighting games, but most of them aren't intentionally put in, but rather a consequence of the way the underlying framework for fighting games is designed. You'd have to add complexity to the system to remove this inherent difficulty. For example, with ""Omega Mode"" in USFIV, the developers tested out an experimental automatic input repeating mechanic with the intent of removing 1 frame links from the game entirely, which it's my understanding that they're going to implement as a standard feature of SFV.  TL;DR yes, there are things that can be done, and games are constantly experimenting with them. It's just not a straightforward process."
Games,3dym2s,Karmaze,6,Tue Jul 21 17:37:07 2015 UTC,I don't really think it's the fighting game fans that don't understand this. I don't see there being that big of a pushback on this based on the fact that it doesn't have the controller motions. I think people will give it an honest shot and it'll pass/fail on its own merits.   It's more that it was a necessity to get all the movies using a joystick/controller. Using a keyboard allows for a lot more keys to be used.

L M H a b y  Where alpha, betta, gamma are your selected specials. You also seem to have a larger selection of moves and are limited to 3. The other thing I noticed on the UI was that only the player characters meter showed up. That could just be an Alpha thing but if I can't track what moves my opponent has or how much meter they have that's another issue, and how would local play work for that? It's probably just because it's in Alpha but that's an odd thing.  I'm still not sold on the cool down concept, it's just going to encourage waiting and that should never be something you want to happen."
Games,3dym2s,Ricepilaf,7,Tue Jul 21 03:43:11 2015 UTC,"Special moves are far from the hardest part of the entry barrier, though.  Combos require strict timing and even ones that have no special moves involved are going to be much harder to do than a given special move will.  People who complain about specials being hard are suddenly going to realize that those aren't what was keeping them out of the genre, they just thought it was."
Games,3dym2s,gamelord12,20,Tue Jul 21 05:58:11 2015 UTC,"Combos require strict timing and even ones that have no special moves involved are going to be much harder to do than a given special move will.   You're absolutely right.  I played the Killer Instinct tutorial, and those moves chain together so easily that I felt like a pro by the end of it.  I felt like I better understood how fighting game combos  work in general (and that's probably true), so I went back to Street Fighter IV challenges.  Nope.  Not happening.  I understand how they work, and I understand that there's very specific timing, but it's still not any easier."
Games,3dym2s,SchizoTheWorst,5,Mon Jul 20 21:31:56 2015 UTC,"That is one thing about SF that I love seeing in SF5, 3 frame buffers on all links is such a great thing for the game, motions are one thing but one frame links are tedious and stupid. (fuck you Adon trial 24, un-plinkable one frame link off overhead my ass)"
Games,3dym2s,azuresou1,7,Mon Jul 20 22:40:49 2015 UTC,"I think you're saying this as a competitive fighting game player though. Sure, once everyone can pull out specials on demand, the execution aspect shifts towards timing, and once you have THAT down it's all down to mindgames. But for the VAST majority of gamers, the biggest barrier is executing the move they want, on demand.  My favorite fighter is Tekken. It's nice and moderately paced, the juggle timing is generous, and there's a LOT of emphasis placed on footsies, wakeup traps. Not coincidentally it's also the most popular fighting game amongst my gamer friends. But even in Tekken there's a fair bit of emphasis placed on being able to execute moves on demand. Some characters are literally built around the ability to input a move perfectly. Can't EWGF on demand? Sorry, can't play any Mishima character.   A game that's looking to remove the input barrier for specials is huge for people like me. It's one thing for your juggle to only take off 30% instead of 48% because of poor timing. It's another to miss your entire juggle because you didn't input your uppercut launch correctly. They're two entirely different worlds of frustration."
Games,3dym2s,Tzeentch,3,Tue Jul 21 04:20:10 2015 UTC,"Half circles are the hardest motion, and in SF4 are pretty screwed up anyway! Something about shortcuts in the input system makes them harder than they have to be. I've played SF4 for around 300 hours and I still have trouble with them for that reason, but if I head back to SF3 or Skullgirls, they come out just fine."
Games,3dym2s,gamelord12,3,Tue Jul 21 18:41:40 2015 UTC,"I'd argue that full circles are much, much harder.  Is there a way to even get them out without being mid-air?"
Games,3dym2s,Tzeentch,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:57:33 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that in SF4, the only part that is important is that you hit all four directions before doing the move for it to count as a 360. So instead of a circle, say, you could do down (locking you into crouch animation, preventing you from jumping for a few frames) up, forward, back and that would count as a 360.  But that's pro level speed and accuracy. I still have problems with them, but not as much as the half circle."
Games,3dym2s,LatinGeek,2,Mon Jul 20 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"you could do down, up, forward, back and that would count as a 360.   This is why I have trust issues."
Games,3dym2s,HappierShibe,3,Mon Jul 20 17:05:22 2015 UTC,"It's generally better to start with forward, particularly for 720's this way if you go fast enough you execute from the walking forward animation instead of crouching, giving you the maximum reach.  It's not a big deal for 360's with the fierce attacks, but the light attacks have deceptively long reach already and a few extra pixels of threat they aren't expecting can make a big difference."
Games,3dym2s,c4ndle,5,Mon Jul 20 19:48:36 2015 UTC,"Every character has a certain number of prejump frames where if you press a button, you can finish a special move without jumping. This lets grapplers do 360s on the ground and fireball characters do fireballs even if they end their input with an up forward."
Games,3dym2s,Kairah,7,Mon Jul 20 17:48:26 2015 UTC,I think the idea is to do them when your character is doing an animation that prevents them from jumping.
Games,3dym2s,HappierShibe,7,Mon Jul 20 23:02:37 2015 UTC,"I can do  a walking 720 with about 70% consistency, and a walking 360 with 100% consistency.  But I am one of the aforementioned grognards, and have been playing grappler characters since the early 90's."
Games,3dym2s,SchizoTheWorst,4,Mon Jul 20 17:45:12 2015 UTC,Going from forward and riding the rails to up back and pressing the button at the same time is the easiest way to execute a 360 in SF.
Games,3dym2s,ToadingAround,3,Mon Jul 20 17:45:13 2015 UTC,"And note that in Skullgirls, some inputs are deliberately made easier. For example, if you even suggest that you're doing a 360 motion jumps will not come out, so there's no tricks you need to do to consistently input them.  (And this is only a thing on a single character, Cerebella, other characters won't get this effect because they don't have 360 motion attacks)"
Games,3dym2s,TheBigBruce,4,Tue Jul 21 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"Actually, half-circles are crazy lenient in SF4. They only require ""Any Forward, Any Downward, Back"" for Half Circle Backwards. Down+Forward, Down,Back is a valid HCB motion, as an example."
Games,3dym2s,chudaism,8,Mon Jul 20 23:13:10 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that some of the inputs in fighting games are unnecessarily hard, I don't think this is much different than a lot of other games as well. All games have some level of input barrier. Imagine if CS:GO had a bunch of aim assist or if LoL/Dota removed skill shots. This would be removing a ton of the technical barrier in favour of pure strategy.   I introduced a friend to Street Fighter IV on a fight stick last month (and he plays a ton of games, even competitive ones), and he struggled to pull off even a fireball, let alone a dragon punch. Hell, I've logged about 30 hours into SFIV, and I still screw up Ibuki's half circle punch about 30% of the time.   The issue with fighting games is that the technical inputs do not translate at all from other games. The fact that he plays a lot of other games doesn't really translate over at all. Playing a ton of SCII doesn't really prepare you to play CS:GO at all just like it won't prepare you to play SFIV. You are basically starting in a new genre from scratch.  I think if they start dumbing it down too much, fighting games may suffer a similar fate that arena shooters did. Strafe jumping, rocket jumping, etc are all high level technical inputs unique to arena shooters which have subsequently been removed in a lot of FPS due to their high level of difficulty. This killed the genre for a while and only recently have we seen a mild resurgence.  That being said, there have been some attempts to remove the input barrier in fighting games. MvC3 had a simple mode which got rid of a lot of the technical inputs. The smash series has attempted to remove it, and have succeeded in more recent iterations for the most part. That being said Melee and Project M have had the most longevity in large part due to their high technical skill ceiling."
Games,3dym2s,Razumen,9,Mon Jul 20 23:50:35 2015 UTC,"Comparing it to CS isn't fair, aiming up in Cs You just move the mouse up, it's more or less intuitive. The skill comes in aiming quickly, accurately, moving smartly and predicting the event team's movement.  On the other hand doing a flying uppercut in a fighting game might require a half circle and a button press, half of which isn't intuitive at all."

Games,3dym2s,Siantlark,3,Mon Jul 20 18:19:36 2015 UTC,Things that used to be more prevalent CS such as wallbanging and bunnyhopping are just as useful and unintuitive as halfcircle inputs.
Games,3dym2s,chudaism,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:21:43 2015 UTC,"I am not arguing that it isn't more intuitive, I am arguing that there is still a large technical barrier to CS as there is with any other competitive game.  I also think that it is only intuitive because that is what we are used to in shooters nowadays. When dual analog control was first released, it was criticised for being unintuitive, but now it is fairly simple for most players. FPS also started with keyboard aiming, so it was not completely intuitive from the beginning.  I would think that if VR ever takes over and motion control becomes mainstream, future generations are going to think mouse control is unintuitive."
Games,3dym2s,needconfirmation,24,Mon Jul 20 21:08:38 2015 UTC,"The difference is in those games it's about your reflexes.  In fighting games you need those same reflexes, possibly even faster ones, AND the inputs are extremely difficult.  Nobody has ever played counter strike and said to themselves ""I've been sitting here for half an hour, I'm doing the motion, but I just can't get my gun to reload! I got it once, and I feel like I'm doing it the same way every time, but it's just not reloading""  And nobody ever accused high level RTS/moba play of being easy, but again, Nobody has ever sat down with SC2 for an hour practicing how to get a marine to build out of the barracks, because they just can't get the command to work."

I got it once, and I feel like I'm doing it the same way every time, but it's just not reloading""   Yes, but I am sure there are tons of players who can't snipe well or have trouble getting headshots. I would say that is akin to removing the technical difficulty in fighters. If CS:GO did away with headshots, I am sure there would be a ton of complaints from the community.   Nobody has ever sat down with SC2 for an hour practicing how to get a marine to build out of the barracks, because they just can't get the command to work.   That's making a false comparison I think. Of course no player has struggle to build a barracks, but no player has struggled to jump in a SF game as well. I am sure tons of players have struggled with properly micro managing their units and effectively setting up key macros on the fly."
Games,3dym2s,needconfirmation,42,Mon Jul 20 18:53:56 2015 UTC,"But it is the same though.  Because it's not the skill ceiling of fighting games that drive people away, it's the skill floor, it is orders of magnitude higher than other genres, most people cant do basic actions.  Strategy games are notoriously difficult to be good at, not as much as a fighting game, but still more than most others, but a new starcraft player can very quickly figure out how to build a base, and gather resources, and build units, and order them to attack. Their reaction time isn't going to be as fast as a skilled player, and their strategy isn't going to be as good as a skilled player, but they have the basics down, and as they gain more knowledge about the game they get better at those things they are doing, because there isn't much about a strategy game that is hard to do at all, only hard to do well.  Even higher level concepts aren't going to be beyond a new starcraft player. There's a reason it's called a control group, and not a quarter-circle backwards light+heavy punch group. It's just one button.  With fighting games basic competency is beyond the grasp of most people, because even if you understand the game, and you know what to do that's not going to help you get past that hard input barrier. You can't poorly cast a fireball in street fighter, but there's nothing in counterstrike that an unskilled player will be completely unable to execute."

You can still do some cool things in Quake without strafe jumping, and you can still play through a match of LoL with some cool powers if you only know how to click a mouse.  The only things you can do in Street Fighter if you can't do a quarter circle motion are punch, kick, and jump, which is pretty underwhelming compared to the guy who can pull off an ultra combo on you.  Also,   Strafe jumping, rocket jumping, etc are all high level technical inputs unique to arena shooters which have subsequently been removed in a lot of FPS due to their high level of difficulty. This killed the genre for a while and only recently have we seen a mild resurgence.

In that case, “we’re not really playing chess,” he says, and no one looks at famous Street Fighter matches and says, “That dude totally threw all the fireballs.” Being able to input attacks isn’t what’s interesting about high-level fighting, the way knowing how to move a knight isn't the hard part of chess."

There are so many draw backs to the input system and even the training modes it just puts people off. There is a lot of secret stuff in SF4 that the average user doesn't know about that the game doesn't teach.   -option select -kara throwing -negative edge -plinking -frame data  Then there is the stuff that shouldn't be secret. For example Balrog's head butt into ultra cannot be done via the way the instructions tell you. Back forward punch then down up. That is impossible. Instead the correct way is down-back to up-back. then back foward on the joystick.  I'm not enjoying the game sitting in the training room trying to guess the timing for a combo. Tekken and tobal and so many other games at least tell you the timing for these things so you can usually start enjoying the game rather quickly.
Games,3dym2s,DoctorRimJob,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:06:27 2015 UTC,This thread makes my head hurt. If you want a fighting game with simplified controls play one that advertises that as a feature.

Games,3dym2s,Blueclaw_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 06:32:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I agree with his idea of the execution barrier being a big issue. I think it's fine to have it there, it's not like most other competitive games don't have this kind of execution barrier. Aiming and movement in CS:GO is a physical skill and takes practice. Last hitting and and aiming skillshots in mobas is a physical skill and takes practice. Doing inputs in fighting games is a physical skill and takes practice. It's all the same, really.  I also think that people will get bored of the game pretty quick if there's nothing even remotely difficult in terms of execution. The feeling of satisfaction is completely gone if nothing is difficult to do. Being able to aim properly to land hits feels really satisfying to me in CS:GO because it's difficult to do. If that difficulty wasn't there and we just had aim assist then it wouldn't feel satisfying at all.  At the very least it seems like the combo system uses either a mix of links and target combos or just very easy links. About 40 seconds in dauntless dashes in, lands what looks like a standing hard punch or medium punch, links that into a jab then cancels into a super. After the super finishes he links the super into a special. Maybe that will be enough for people to actually have things they want to practice, but if they're going full force with the whole low execution thing then there's probably a crazy long buffer window in place."

When you learn to play Zangief, you're also removing the execution barrier for T-Hawk, Hakkan, and Hugo.  Learning to play Ryu removes the execution barrier for a solid third of the cast, and Guile or Vega contain the remainder of the execution barrier.  If you learn to do Dragunov's Forward Knee-> Four Point limbreaker thing.  Thats ALL you've learned. It isn't useful for any other characters, it isn't even useful for any of Dragunovs OTHER  complicated short window links.  Learning a tekken character means learning a half dozen or so completely non-transferrable skills to get past the execution barrier for just that one character."

Games,3dym2s,wasdninja,2,Tue Jul 21 05:10:09 2015 UTC,"It's annoying to link, yes, but cancel heavy games becomes massive combo fests where you tap out a novel every time you score a jab. This is much less true in SF4."

Not once have I been able to do the Z motion correctly and most half circle moves slow me down too much that I'm left open. Games like DOA or Tekken are way easier I think. Less complex directional input and a focus on button strings. I tend to discover combos by accident as I play. Never tried KOF, maybe I'll pick it up on sale someday. I gave Skullgirls a try before to and even struggled with the tutorial."

Games,3dym2s,NotJohnStamos,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:47:49 2015 UTC,"I've yet to see anyone mention Soul Calibur in this thread, which saddens me as out of all fighting games, it is my favorite.   SC has this hybrid of SF and Tekken controls, where specials are both just an attack button (or two) plus a direction, as well as a few directional rotations plus attack button. And it seemed with some characters they were weaning away the directional rotations (on fast characters such as Voldo) or reserving them for especially powerful moves.   SC has such move diversity across the characters that you could play high ranking matches and never quarter circle anything. It was all about move reading and reacting. As an Astaroth, you wait for someone to get stuck in an animation that will miss you before opening with back-down+square."
Games,3dym2s,unboogyman,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:17 2015 UTC,"I enjoy SC, haven't played it in ages. The peak for me was SC2, the movement was so fluid, winning was a matter of 3d positioning as much as hitting the right buttons. Dunno why but SC4 and 5 felt so stiff to me."
Games,3dym2s,NotJohnStamos,6,Mon Jul 20 20:20:33 2015 UTC,They kept changing the controls for basic move sets was a huge negative to me. Imagine if every Street Fighter they changed how you performed a hadoken. That's what they did with SC. Combos long memorized would be useless with each release. And SC5 focused more on technical guards and breaks which further enhanced strong turtling characters (looking at you Maxi pad). So the later games slowed down and became stiff because it was about standing blocks and breaks to get in hits instead of specials that moved you into advantageous positions. Its a bad sign when even the most slippery and mobile character (Voldo) became a stand still and strike character in V
Games,3dym2s,Xenotechie,8,Mon Jul 20 20:26:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, for some reason, I could never pull off shoryukens, hadokens and all that crap with any decent amount of consistency.

It's fundamental enough that I'd be willing to say it's a largely unquestioned assumption. He's right to point out that there's clearly something magical in the inputs, given the FGC's continued existence. Dropping inputs though is an experiment that should provide interesting results.  And it's also probably a better idea for a F2P game than a $60 flagship like SF V. F2P games thrive on having lots of players, and this makes it a much more appealing sell to people and friends who aren't normally into fighting games."

Games,3dym2s,SchizoTheWorst,3,Mon Jul 20 19:47:46 2015 UTC,"The thing is this has been done before in a couple different games. I haven't messed around with the simple mode in Marvel but I have in the 3ds version of AE, and holy shit was is wack. Being able to throw out sonic booms and flash kicks without charging and getting guile's whole suite of godly normals is just too much. And that begs the question, how different can you really make the characters in a game where you can press a special at any time without an input? Will fireballs be too much in neutral because of it? It's like taking out the recoil and spray patterns in CS, the question lies in whether or not they can make the game around the inputs."

Games,3dym2s,Ranor,2,Mon Jul 20 20:40:24 2015 UTC,"I like this. It reminds me of how Blizzard approached Heroes of the Storm, they took a popular genre, trimmed the fat (so to speak. In the case of HotS this includes items, last hitting, wards, deliberately avoiding getting kills unlessy ou're a carry, and other things that I personally would call ""fat"" on a genre) to make it more accessible, but kept the core of the gameplay well oiled and engaging.  Call it casual, but I much prefer losing because I know I made poor choices in my gameplay than because the other guy locked himself in a room and spent months honing repetitive motions to the point where he might as well push a button to do it.  It's a problem I've always had in fighting games. The manual says down right up punch, I do down right up punch. But instead of doing an uppercut, my character just shuffles about, jumps, then does a normal punch. I try doing it much faster, they just sorta twitch, I try it slower, same difference.  As much as I love the look of the SF5 trailers, I just get depressed when I realise I'll never be able to physically perform the moves being shown off in the advertising material."

There can still be -depth- in the gameplay in of itself, but the controls shouldn't be an obstacle. It's why I like HotS over every other MOBA (And I'ved played all of them, even Smite).  And, as said, I just can't seem to grasp or 'click' with a fighting game's inputs. The examples I've mentioned occurred years ago when I was young, and -did- spend dozens of hours practising, and had nothing to show for it.  Not to mention it's immediately discouraging when I get constantly trounced by the AI or other players who can perform the techniques I just -can't- do no matter how hard I try or how much time I invest. At least with Rising Thunder I can say ""Oh, I shouldn't have usedt hat move then"" which is what high level fighting game play is, rather than ""For fuck's sake why won't the game let me do what I want to fucking do in the first place?""."
Games,3dym2s,ScizorKick,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:16:59 2015 UTC,"It's really not something that takes hundreds of hours, or really even dozens for that matter. Once you get the motions down in one game you can transition to others fairly easily.   I was really bad when I started playing Marvel Vs. Capcom 3(hell, I'm still not great at it), but I learned how to do fireballs and shoryukens consistently just by going into practice mode occasionally. Now, I'm a solid KI and Blazblue player. It's not like every game requires you to sit down for 10 hours in the lab just to grasp the basics. Motions are practically universal in the genre, and once you can get them in one game it opens you up to most others."
Games,3dym2s,thedddronald,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:40:49 2015 UTC,"The thing is, those ""barrier of entry,"" parts of a moba aren't really relevant until you're at  mid skill level in the game. There is a real barrier of entry in the beginning, but it's based on getting consistent mechanics and having a general awareness of what each character can do. I know for certain that things like being careful not to hog kills, and giving ward last hits to support aren't relevant in league until a much higher level, at which point it's completely reasonable to expect your player to have to do. In fact, although you call these things the ""fat,"" of the genre, it's all pretty intuitive, you figure these things out just by playing a lot and using common sense.  It's fine if you prefer a simpler version that takes less thought outside of playing, but it's a little unfair to claim that people are only winning these games based on execution and arbitrary knowledge when in truth these ""fat,"" systems are intuitive rather than cryptic and add so much to the game.   Most MOBAs come with recommended builds for each character as well. Builds that are almost certain to carry you through lower levels until you get a grasp of what each item can do."

Games,3dxmh6,holydragonnall,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:27:40 2015 UTC,"The ""original"" on PS2 had beautiful sprites and an interesting plot (to me), but suffered from massive slowdowns on several of the bosses and a very tedious grinding requirement that you wound up repeating for every characters.  The differences in the way the characters played was nice, but it was never large enough to make the grinding pleasant.  I think I wound up using a codebreaker to ease the grinding half-way through my 2nd character (yes, I'm a horrible person).  In that way, I subsequently enjoyed the plot a bit more.  Arguably another issue you run across if you play all the characters is fighting the same enemies over and over (same bosses... I guess that's a little more excusable when there's good plot reasons).  At any rate, I suppose I'd hope they'd be able to fix the the technical issues if they're doing a remake (especially for more powerful systems).  Codebreaker-type stuff is less common post-PS2 though, so I hope they're also looking at the grind/design elements that came together to create some tedium in the original.

Games,3dxmh6,MalusandValus,24,Tue Jul 21 07:57:35 2015 UTC,"Man I hope they do Muramasa next, it looks like a great fun game and I fuckin loved Dragon's Crown and Odin Sphere, but I don't have a Wii so never really got to play Muramasa.  Though, guess I could emulate it since I doubt it uses motion controls. Anyway, Odin Sphere revamp sounds awesome, it's a great, neat game from back when PlayStation still was full of all these somewhat oddball games. If you liked it and are looking for more, I'd recommend Squaresoft's old Legend of Mana on the PS1. Fantastic game and still looks great today due to the hand-drawn style of the game."
Games,3dxmh6,laurabaileysirishcre,8,Mon Jul 20 12:29:28 2015 UTC,"They allready did remake/enhance it once for the Vita, I doubt it's their priority anymore."
Games,3dxmh6,pfarly,6,Mon Jul 20 12:32:54 2015 UTC,"Muramasa is waggle free for the Wii, and apparently runs fairly well on Dolphin."
Games,3dxmh6,bigblackcouch,0,Mon Jul 20 13:53:05 2015 UTC,Emulating Muramasa isn't ideal since you're missing out on the DLCs and much improved translation from the Vita version.  I'd love a PS4 port of that.
Games,3dxmh6,seanthemanpie,9,Mon Jul 20 15:37:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's another part of the issue. Plus, I like supporting good companies like Vanillaware. Problem is I don't want a Wii and especially not just for one game, and I dislike handheld gaming so the Vita's out.  Push it out to PS4 though and yeah I'll buy that. Most of all though? A PC version of Dragon's Crown. I have a couple friends that don't own a console and can't really afford to, but we could all play PC together. Plus, goddamn that game was wonderful. I already own a disc version and the PSN version just for the shits of it. I'd buy a full price Steam version in a heartbeat."

Games,3dxmh6,Storm-Crow,3,Tue Jul 21 02:07:50 2015 UTC,"Solution: buy a physical copy of the game, and then play it on an emulator anyway.   PC Dragon's Crown would be awesome, btw."

Easiest way to cheese through the game was to eat at the Pooka restaurant a few times with stacks of the right ingredients."
Games,3dxmh6,Storm-Crow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:56:20 2015 UTC,"If I remember right there wasn't much to it... maybe two plants I would go between.

Personally, I hope that grind is diminished a bit in the remake."

Games,3dxmh6,ApocalypseTroop,0,Mon Jul 20 13:52:11 2015 UTC,Really?  I thought it was pretty easy.  Even easier playing it on an old PS3 (no lag).
Games,3dxmh6,adremeaux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"This game looked absolutely beautiful on the PS2 but it fell into the trap like so many RPGs where it failed to hold my attention by the middle of the game. If I remember correctly, you play as several different characters. This would be fine except the game has you traversing many of the same areas over and over again. The levels themselves are one giant circular area. It can get a bit repetitive. I remember combat being good but not the most deep. I'm not sure I'll pick this one up again. Oh, and it's pretty hard. I think that's the main reason why I quit playing it."
Games,3dxmh6,khakimage,-2,Mon Jul 20 15:56:22 2015 UTC,"It's punishingly difficult, but for many a big chunk of that difficulty came in the clumsiness of the controls. If I recall, even though the combat overall looks very fluid, it feels absolutely sluggish when you press a button for the response to come out. In a game that's all about quick movement and fast reactions, the controls make playing at the level you want to play at a nightmare.  I'm assuming they will be fixing this. Muramasa, the successor, had excellent controls, and Dragon's Crown controls were better still."
Games,3dxmh6,Mnstrzero00,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:11:27 2015 UTC,I particularly recall there being some frustrating stuff where you couldn't jump while the person was doing the 'turning around' animation.
Games,3dxmh6,adremeaux,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:58:51 2015 UTC,"The controls were like Dark Souls, or Minster Hunter, where the character will do the full animation that could be really slow. You have to learn their moves but once you do its a nice feeling."

Games,3dz64u,Net_Bastard,49,Mon Jul 20 18:47:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's the last writer who had been around when Kasavin and the Giant Bomb guys were still at GameSpot.   Watters has been there for a while too. I think he joined a couple years after Kevin."
Games,3dz64u,Rookwood,8,Mon Jul 20 18:54:26 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if he's been there that long.  I distinctly remember him coming to prominence in the wake of people like Kasavin and Gerstmann exiting.  Him and Justin Calvert were sorta like the next generation for Gamespot.   He could have been around before then and I just didn't notice him amongst the others.
Games,3dz64u,SyrioForel,-9,Tue Jul 21 00:15:09 2015 UTC,"Your definition of ""old days"" is gonna be very subjective. Gamespot has been around since the 1990s."

Danny is the main man of gamespot and if cbsi wants to keep both brands as their unique take on games, there is no way they would move the most important man over to the other brand. It's like moving jeff back to gamespot."

Games,3dz64u,rhayadergoestotown,24,Tue Jul 21 13:07:47 2015 UTC,"Metal Gear Solid 4 and Dragon Age: Origins are his reviews that are the most memorable to me.  I still remember watching 2008's Game of the Year and Brian Ekberg's and Kevin's statements about MGS4.  Here it is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2oiFK7jdGM  For me, this is pretty much the equivalent to when Joey Esposito and Ben Bailey left IGN Comics (and formed Assemble After Dark) and when Greg and Colin left (and formed Kinda Funny Games).  There were very little reasons for me to visit IGN for opinionated views because they were entertaining for me and I respected their views.  After Kasavin, Gertsmann and team left, my gamespot usage dwindled, then took a while to get used to the new team.  After Brian Ekberg and Sofia Tong left and then Carolyn and Maxwell entered, I just did not like the atmosphere at Gamespot.  No disrespect but there was something off about how reviews were done, among other things.  Current team is alright but always visited to read and watch Kevin VanOrd's reviews and opinions.  Good luck to Kevin at Trion Worlds."
Games,3dz64u,TheDaliComma,9,Tue Jul 21 08:13:11 2015 UTC,"He was too good for Gamespot, that's for sure.  Hope he lands somewhere better.  Kevin could probably have his own Youtube channel with a mil. followers doing reviews and comments like John Bain does."
Games,3dz64u,rhayadergoestotown,3,Mon Jul 20 21:29:56 2015 UTC,"Lol, did you even read the post? He said he's going to work as a writer at Trion Worlds"

Games,3dz64u,Silverflash-x,15,Tue Jul 21 16:39:36 2015 UTC,"This is sad, he's a great reviewer and videogame writer.  That being said, I'm really curious as to what the process for a games journalist transitioning to a videogame writer must be like. What habits need to be unlearned, does videogame criticism limit or open up your writing, and so on. I'd be really interested if he were to do an AMA or interview to answer these questions."
Games,3dz64u,Toysoldier34,11,Mon Jul 20 20:42:38 2015 UTC,"That's disappointing. I'm a huge fan of Kevin's and his reviews were one of the things keeping me going to Gamespot. I was sort of naturally drawn there over other sites initially because I moderated GameFAQs forums, which were, at the time, merged with Gamespot's. But now I'm not sure what, other than Danny O'Dwyer, will keep me going there."
Games,3dz64u,bakayoyo,12,Tue Jul 21 05:38:38 2015 UTC,"Kevin was the one person keeping Gamespot together. Danny does some great stuff, but the core review side of the site is what Kevin kept strong. Without him and after losing a lot of other key people over the last year or so the site is going to flounder.  The site has already been on a big downhill with most of their content being links and reposts of Reddit content and things on that level. We don't really get much real content beyond clickbait and topics to bring out trolls and fanboy wars to generate traffic.  It is sad to see a site I once visited multiple times every day become a shell of what it was and what I loved. The changes from management to make the focus more profits and views over quality content is sad. They went the course of easy low brow content that we already have plenty of and didn't need in the first place.  Chris Watters is really one of the last remaining long standing well known people now, with Danny being another well known once but a bit newer. I hope the two of them can move onto something that can better appreciate and utilize their talents, because what they were once capable of and where the site has them now really squanders their abilities."
Games,3dz64u,boomtrick,3,Tue Jul 21 10:43:58 2015 UTC,"Too bad, I only really visited gamespot to see his opinion about a game. I guess the era of the video review is now officially dead."
Games,3dz64u,bakayoyo,-2,Mon Jul 20 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I guess the era of the video review is now officially dead.   idk man. i've never really enjoyed gamespot's reviews.especially kevin's.  most of the time the reviews never really bothered reviewing the things i actually cared about the game. Kevin is notorious for this, he focuses way too much on making his reviews personal and treats games like works of art. and thats great and does a splendid job of selling the game but i kind of like reviews to be objective and to the point as much as possible.   when it comes to reviews about games i want them to be the point. whats good, whats bad,while showing what the game is like. thats it  look at the reviews of bloodborne.  kevin's:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zYjuDdBZN18  lots of imagery and does a good job of touching the major points about the game. but thats it....  now look at game trailers review on the same game:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hc2rEIgEaK4  not even close to as entertaining as kevin's and while it goes along the same points as kevin's. it goes into each point in more detail giving you a clear idea of the game's systems and how it affects gameplay. it also does a good job of pointing out the games flaws.  the game trailers review gives me a great idea of bloodborne as a game. i know exactly what to expect and it makes it  easy for me to see if its for me. kevin's on the other hand while not as informative is more entertaining and better written.  at the end of the day though i like my reviews to pack as much info as possible. and kevin's doesn't cut it. not saying kevin's reviews are bad, far from it, its just not my thing when looking for game reviews.  also just because hes quitting doesn't necessarily mean hes out of the game journalism biz."
Games,3dz64u,Rookwood,4,Mon Jul 20 19:55:17 2015 UTC,"Well that's a matter of opinion of course, but in my opinion what makes a review, a review rather than just a description of the game is precisely that personal touch. Not that there is anything wrong with not being enamored with the personal touch Kevin brought to his reviews. Jim Sterling had some fun with the idea of taking objectivity to the max: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMU1_-_4WKg"
Games,3dz64u,Nykteris,-2,Mon Jul 20 21:02:18 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I never cared for Kevin's review style.  Frankly I found it frustrating to watch because he was so nebulous and noncommittal with his criticism.  Everything seemed to be followed by a ""but.""  When he enjoyed something, the review was basically just 10 minutes of him gushing and using the phrase ""makes you feel..."" a lot."
Games,3dz64u,alex2217,2,Tue Jul 21 00:19:15 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  His criticisms of the Mass Effect games boiled down to ""various minor bugs"".  Whether he loves the games or hates them, as a critic he has a responsibility to point out both the good AND the bad.  Don't ignore the ridiculousness of the space ninja or the problems with the ending just because other aspects of the game appealed to you.  You can still give a good recommendation to a game while pointing out what it does wrong.  Take a look at the Previously Recorded video for Arkham Knight.  It's basically 45 minutes of them criticizing the shortcomings of an otherwise very enjoyable game."
Games,3dz64u,boomtrick,5,Tue Jul 21 01:37:10 2015 UTC,"But what if he doesn't consider those things problems? I'm not sure how you honestly believe those are objective criticisms, rather than purely subjective ones. As a critic, he has an obligation to be honest and an incentive to be consistent, but he certainly doesn't have to be objective.   To your other point, regarding long critical videos, that's simply not the Gamespot format, and they don't do video reviews that are that long -- never have done, probably never will do."
Games,3dz64u,joecb91,4,Tue Jul 21 10:01:26 2015 UTC,yep. a great example of this is his DA:I review which was just 5 minutes talking about how awesome it was without really explaining why and ignoring all the flaws.

Games,3dz64u,IdRatherBeLurking,2,Mon Jul 20 21:45:37 2015 UTC,I figured it was only matter of time after Caro and Tom were let go.

But he and Watters aren't enough to keep me going back (Watters is still there, right?). It felt like Kevin kept everything together, and after Caro, Tom, and Brendan were gone, he just didn't have as much passion for the company."
Games,3dz64u,Snow_Monky,3,Tue Jul 21 04:41:16 2015 UTC,"To me, he'll always be the guy who had the balls to tell Insomniac that their Ratchet games had ""too much variety"", which turned out to be exactly what they needed to hear.  Best of luck to that guy."
Games,3dz64u,Maelstrom52,2,Tue Jul 21 06:53:29 2015 UTC,"Greg Kasavin was my favorite reviewer. The passion he had for gaming, the professionalism and care he put to written and video reviews (when they were just coming out), and his overall personality were the total package. Gamespot ended for me when he left. I never liked the others all that much and I listened to Hotspot when I was in middle school along with the 1UP show. Funnily enough, the 1UP show was actually so far pretentious with reviewers up their own assholes it made Hotspot look like a lounge.  Do I miss the end of an era? No, I actually welcome it. Gametrailers.com paved the way after 1upping gamevideos.com back in the mid 00's and their gameplay videos and reviews were enough to gauge what you wanted. It was less personal. Then, we got people like CGRUndertow and others like TB, which show what each game is. I'll still miss written reviews. There's something about old written reviews done right that shows off the level of analysis and detail you will never find in a video review. Honestgamers and Eurogamer are the ones I frequent now."

Games,3dxod4,inspyre,6,Mon Jul 20 11:51:45 2015 UTC,"There are some fantastic people over at http://arks-layer.com/ who put together a custom launcher for the JP version of the game. It requires no real hacking or anything, only that you click a few checkboxes and it downloads some patches before you launch the game to have translations and a proxy if you need one. Though it is only a small team that only runs on donations and does this in spare time so updated translations likely wont be out at the same time as a new patch.  The game is very much playable with this launcher, and i would rather some incomplete text in irrelevant places over playing on an SEA server which has shitty translation to begin with and way less content."

Games,3dxod4,Takadorable,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:39 2015 UTC,"I've had plenty of issues getting into the JP version. Took me forever to figure out how to make everything work and the updater would sometimes freak out for no reason. Since me and my friends aren't able to play together that often, each one of our PSO2 session would start with a main client update, then a fan patch update, then both of us crossing our fingers that nothing wrong happened in-between as we applied the various fan patches (and it often did.) And even then, plenty of text lacked translations which was really annoying especially when acquiring certain items. On my JP account I have a bunch of items that I have no idea what they are supposed to do.  I understand that Arks-Layer are doing the best they can, but I am going to try this english version of the game in hopes that it doesn't have any of these issues. Maybe it isn't up-to-date with the japanese version but I've been waiting 3 years for a proper english version so I already missed out quite a lot of content anyway."

In the Japanese version, costumes can only be acquired either through real money scratchoff prizes or by buying them with ingame money from another player. However they are purely aesthetic and offer no special bonuses whatsoever, so you can run around with the default costume if you want and be at no disadvantage.   This version, the South-East Asia version is a bit different. Costumes give you special bonuses (such as increasing the power of ice magic) and huge stat boosts. The thing is, not only can you only get them via real money scratchoff (I'm not positive but I think I remember hearing that they were not tradable), but the effects expire when the next set of costumes comes out, so you have to go and spend more money to get the next set of costumes to keep your stat boosts. It's a total mess. Just stick with the English-patched JP version."

I am one of those people who likes to get vanity stuff for money though, so the extra layer of pain-in-the-ass that is required to do so on the JP server is another reason I have continued to hope that SEGA will finally bring it over here.

Games,3dxod4,dorkkaos,19,Mon Jul 20 23:36:02 2015 UTC,"Reposting what I said on /r/MMORPG  PSO2JP player here. I'll clear up some common misconceptions and questions from new players regarding the different versions.  Misconception: JP is fan translated, and SEA is officially translated, so SEA's translation should be better!   Fact: Nope. JP has some parts that are not translated, but those are unimportant stuff. Quality is about the same, only that SEA is translated without context, unlike JP. Examples are stuff like Forces being translated as Wizards in SEA. This is the first time an ""official"" translation has called Forces Wizards. Other staples which have been badly translated are Photon Arts, Techniques, Bravers, -mates into Photon Moves, Photon Magic, Samurais, Health Drinks respectively. There might be more that I am unaware of.   Misconception: You need a proxy to play PSO2JP.   Fact: You only need a proxy for PSO2JP if you are playing from SEA. You also (used to?) need a proxy for PSO2SEA if you are playing from outside of SEA. Non-proxy assisted access to PSO2JP and PSO2SEA are mutually exclusive.   Misconception: You will be banned for using English patch and proxy in PSO2JP.   Fact: You can be banned, but that has yet to have happened to anyone I know. I only know of people who have been banned for RMT and botting.   Other common questions-  Is there any content exclusive to either region?   JP has anime/game collaboration items such as costumes, weapon camos, music discs and hairstyles. That's about it. Example anime are Fate/Stay Night and Attack on Titan. SEA has their own exclusive costumes too, stuff like ""I love Singapore"" and ""I love Malaysia"" shirts. Also, some limited quests might not be available in SEA due to licensing issues. The most recent one for example, has Gal Gryphon from PSO as the final boss. Not sure if Asiasoft is able to release it in their version.   Is the game pay to win?   Not at all. AC scratch (RNG box) items are tradeable.  Also, non of the items give direct power boosts. SEA has some costumes with affixes though, and JP has no such thing. The costumes typically come with 200HP and 30 to all resists (the average player has 800HP as a reference). And costumes are either bought from other players, or obtain from AC scratches."

With falling revenue for most of the Japanese entertainment market - a shrinking domestic market, increasing competition and outdated business models - pretty much everyone in Japan has been making huge moves over the last few years to capitalise on the previously, mostly, ignored western market. Some companies do pretty well with this now; SE for many years of course and the likes of Idea Factory and others all jumping on the western money train... and then we have SEGA. Oh SEGA. Poor SEGA.

One of those, ironically, is that I am less likely to try it BECAUSE it is free and almost certainly loaded up with f2p or pay to win bs as a result.

You get priority on lobbies (which are pretty pointless unless you and friends are trying to meet up for server events), more bag space, and the ability to trade on the market place. Literally all content can be done with a free account."
Games,3dxod4,lerobotsexy,2,Mon Jul 20 15:47:49 2015 UTC,"to be fair, there are only two reasons to get premium(subscription). premium block space and recycle passes.   the recycle passes are great simply for getting certain gear easier. the best weapons in the game can't be acquired in this manner, and some of the more niche best weapons can be bought without passes anyway. you can buy anything else without premium, and shop passes are easily obtainable using in-game currencies.  however, premium block(channel) space is ridiculously good. at least in my ship(server), the difference is too great to ignore. for the limited quest i normally get less than 10 minute runs in the better(filled) blocks versus longer than 15 minute runs in the emptier blocks . not to mention being able to switch characters for extra runs for certain emergency quests.  that said, premium is not necessary to 'succeed' in this game; plenty of players do without. just be prepared to play with shitty players."

Now I don't doubt that a few people will poke their head in, look around and think ""Yep this is old as fuck"" then go back to what they were previously playing."

It's missing an entire class (Bouncer), a bunch of balance patches, some levels/missions, three gear levels' worth of weapons (including where a lot of the gear variety comes in)  and the AC costumes are done differently.  On the JP version, they're purely for aesthetics. In the SEA version, AC costumes give timed stat boosts and the game is balanced around having those stat boosts.   Example of the SEA clothing stat boosts: http://i.imgur.com/hv7pflm.png  As far as the skill differences, compare these two links (except SEA has Braver now, as ""Samurai"").

Currently there is Greece, Wales, Monte Carlo, and Germany and it seems that after Finland and Sweden are released there will be no new countries at all. Not even as DLC. If Codemasters could at the very least allow for people to open up the track files it could potentially possibly lead to some form of new tracks, hopefully."

As long as it's kept that- additional."
Games,3dysst,merrickx,2,Tue Jul 21 01:30:43 2015 UTC,"If they could add support for bob's track builder somehow, they wouldn't need to develop the track creation tools.

It would be pretty awesome, but not very likely of course."
Games,3dysst,joshr03,6,Mon Jul 20 20:21:41 2015 UTC,If the real tracks were altered in ways that made them not true to life I could understand.  But the fact that people would freak out over fictional tracks that they are not forced to play in any way is just.. unbelievably stupid.
Games,3dysst,Bluntbows,3,Mon Jul 20 20:22:12 2015 UTC,"Modders are capable of making real terrain at least in theory. Just look at the Arma series where we have (scaled down) reproductions of real life locations such as the entire island of Bornholm. The problem, of course, depends on whether or not Codemasters wants to allow people to open up track files and then maybe possibly modders will be able to make courses using the Race Track Builder which was just greenlit on Steam. I know that's a long shot (a really really really long shot), but it would be nice if it were possible."
Games,3dysst,Thelionheart777,2,Mon Jul 20 20:04:31 2015 UTC,Personally once they have those locations I'd rather the concentrated on making more tracks for those locations. Currently it's a bit tiresome having such a small selection of tracks to chose from for each rally event.
Games,3dysst,dsmx,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:41:05 2015 UTC,"I don't see why they just don't give us a easy to use map builder, so we can make our own maps.

They aren't against modding, they just don't want to potentially risk losing a license that they worked hard to secure. The game is still in Early Access. If, in the future, they work something out with the respective companies, great. They've got a lot more to tackle right now apart from modding. Plus, they don't even have a track editor coded or built. Mods are great, but I'd much rather have a completed game, first."
Games,3dysst,ahrzal,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:06:44 2015 UTC,"Also, the game didn't start with mod support so adding it in might be tricky.

Games,3dysst,ricodued,3,Tue Jul 21 14:55:20 2015 UTC,"Is the pipeline that complicated?   I think it's more the issue of having to develop tools to pack and unpack proprietary data files, a map editor, and various other supporting software. From experience with Arma 3, even without a 3D editor there are a lot of things going on under the hood to enable custom map development."

Games,3dysst,Dusty8,16,Tue Jul 21 00:35:21 2015 UTC,"I think a difference, at least with GTA not sure what other games you are talking about, is Codemasters has a contract with Subaru and Ford and other car manufacturers to feature their cars where Rockstar does not have one for GTA.  Rockstar does not have to worry about any licensing or any breaching of contract with the mods where Codemasters does and has to worry about ruining relationships with car companies that they would like to feature in future games."
Games,3dysst,contrabandwidth,9,Tue Jul 21 07:27:27 2015 UTC,What about games like Assetto Corsa and rFactor? Those developers have licenses with many different manufacturers.

Games,3dysst,claymore5o6,3,Tue Jul 21 16:08:28 2015 UTC,"rFactor has very little licensed content, and I don't know about AC. Maybe they're just less paranoid, or they're not talking to a specific manufacturer that's raising a fuss with Codemasters."

Scratch-made mods are more on the modder for licensing concerns. Some organizations (FOM) are more aggressive in taking down content than others.
Games,3dysst,russlar,3,Mon Jul 20 17:50:21 2015 UTC,"Maybe someone can chime in and give you a better reason than I can.  I would think the publishers of Assetto Corsa and rFactor have less fear of losing partnerships with manufacturers.  Maybe the retail store presence Dirt will have, compared to AC and rFactor, has something to do with the licensing.  Really though, I'm not sure."
Games,3dysst,contrabandwidth,0,Mon Jul 20 18:54:02 2015 UTC,I always felt like these licensing concerns were something they imagine are there but they haven't actually gone and pushed with the actual companies they are licensing from to find out.

Games,3dysst,Ducimus,3,Mon Jul 20 18:11:41 2015 UTC,"Yes, that's the difference between a modder bringing a real car in the game, and a modder taking a real car from the game and customizing it.   Codemasters probably has a deal with those carcompanies in place that their brands must be featured authentic and positively. This also means that they paid money to be in the game, if modders could add new cars in, Subaru and Ford would feel pretty screwed.  I remember in the PS1 / PS2 days that Gran Turismo didn't model damaged cars properly because of those contracts."

The differences in the way the characters played was nice, but it was never large enough to make the grinding pleasant.  I think I wound up using a codebreaker to ease the grinding half-way through my 2nd character (yes, I'm a horrible person).  In that way, I subsequently enjoyed the plot a bit more.  Arguably another issue you run across if you play all the characters is fighting the same enemies over and over (same bosses... I guess that's a little more excusable when there's good plot reasons).  At any rate, I suppose I'd hope they'd be able to fix the the technical issues if they're doing a remake (especially for more powerful systems).  Codebreaker-type stuff is less common post-PS2 though, so I hope they're also looking at the grind/design elements that came together to create some tedium in the original.

Games,3dxr2i,Baldulf,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:23:18 2015 UTC,"I loved the art and uniqueness of Odin Sphere, but the ridiculously abstract and boring grinding, combined with game-breaking slowdown, completely ruined the experience. Here's to hoping that this remake fixes both issues. I'd definitely give the game another shot, since I only made it around halfway through before giving up in frustration."
Games,3dxr2i,Omnifluence,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:56:33 2015 UTC,"People in this thread are talking about hoping they'd make the game less grindy, but it was such a big part of the game that I don't easily see how they could remove it. I mean, just toning down enemy stats so you wouldn't need to grind would probably have ripple effects to pacing and stuff, and would then require touching those parts as well, and create more ripples.  Maybe they could add new areas, so you would still need the same amount of grind, but didn't have to do it repeating the same areas over and over again. Maybe even whole side plots or something so that the grind would turn into more substantial content. Or perhaps these new combat abilities I'm seeing will make it faster to dispose of groups of enemies, so the grind proceeds faster?  It still seems that that kind of major rebalancing would be more effort than remakes usually get."

He was already the 'sixth' character as far as the plot was concerned, I'd have loved it if they could have fleshed his character a bit more and make his dagger one of the crystal weapons.    Oh well.  I'm guessing an entirely new character would have been way too expensive/made the game too bloated."
Games,3dxr2i,DaveSW777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:37:05 2015 UTC,"Some are mentioning it felt grindy, iirc when you use the Alchemy mechanic to level up, it doesn't take any where near as long as if you just killed things ad nauseum.  Given that, the Alchemy interface ruined the game for me.    It took an excessive amount of steps to craft a potion, then recraft it a few times to get effective bonus multipliers for it, then actually use it. The whole process was annoying, slow, clunky and completely breaks the immersion and flow of the gameplay.      Selecting and using the Magic spells was similarly horrid and made the game feel Turn Based, just like the Alchemy stuff; sitting around in menus, combining things over and over.  I did really enjoy the story, art, animation and characters, the combat was slightly varied and you swapped characters enough to keep it mostly fresh.     Playing through the entire storyline was worth it, but man, fuck that Alchemy shit."

Games,3dxr2i,DaveSW777,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:16:23 2015 UTC,"I have a dumb question ... This is such an obscure game, does it have a large enough fanbase to warrant its creators to remake it? There are much more popular games that would RAKE in money if they were remade in HD and ported to Vita, e.g. Chrono Cross, FFXII, MGS1 ... Even The Last Story would profit greatly. Is it not a demand-related decision? Maybe a game like FFXII is too costly to make a handheld port."
Games,3dxr2i,DrSeafood,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:43:41 2015 UTC,"They have the tools to remaster it on-hand, and they're likely using the same hand-drawn sprites. They can lean on the power of the new systems to better framerate. The reward is lower but the cost is also lower.  Chrono Cross would need new backgrounds to be upscaled. FFXII would need brand new textures; so would MGS1. Very high risk for all three.   I think FF7's result will dictate how much effort they'll put into other post-6 FF's as well as other PS1-onwards titles."
Games,3dxr2i,Jebobek,2,Tue Jul 21 11:28:02 2015 UTC,"The reward is lower but the cost is also lower.   That's a good point. I guess I should have said ""remaster"" rather than ""remake"". I don't mean a remake on the scale of FFVII, rather just an HD port like they did for Resident Evil, MGS 2/3, Jet Set Radio, etc."
Games,3dxr2i,DrSeafood,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:35:41 2015 UTC,"Off topic, but if they ever did put out an HD version of 12 I'd hope they change the combat system to be basically the system in FF14, but with Gambits."
Games,3dyslt,JayremyHyoos,50,Mon Jul 20 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"I sometimes feel that I'm in the minority because I love all the Souls-Borne games BECAUSE they are different.  Part of the fun is figuring out what makes them tick and how to maximize your effectiveness in each world (or iteration).  I think a lot of gamers could get more enjoyment out of their entertainment if they would just be open to different things.  Enjoy the game for what it is, and not what it ISN'T.  Dark Souls 1 is a classic and timeless experience.  Dark Souls 2 did some different things and went away from some of the design decisions of DS1.  But, it's still an incredible game."
Games,3dyslt,krunnky,28,Mon Jul 20 19:18:20 2015 UTC,"yeah each game is great and has its own strength against the other games in the series.   overall though, as much as some people hate on it, I've played dark souls 2 more than the rest of the souls-borne games combined.  the built variety and the pvp keeps me playing."
Games,3dyslt,woprdotmil,7,Mon Jul 20 19:45:35 2015 UTC,"Yes, the beauty of DS2 is how diverse and re-playable it is.  For me, that's what makes it special and unique in the series. DS2 is like an amazing roller-coaster where you can change how you ride it in major ways.  I have 5 or 6 characters in NG+ or higher.  I loved DS1 for different reasons: The way the large world inter-connected, the utter hopeless feeling during the story, the feeling imposing fear of the difficult areas.  DS1 was a better story/experience, but not as re-playable.  I have only played through it three times.  But, I've never completed a full NG+ run."
Games,3dyslt,krunnky,6,Mon Jul 20 19:50:22 2015 UTC,"I disagree, I feel that Dark Souls 2, while still a great game, has no edge over DS1 and find the first to be vastly more re-playable. I have 378 hours in the first with close to 10 characters, and 263 hours in the second with only 2 characters. Keep in mind the second had much more content by raw comparison, and I got all the DLC and tried to collect things that required multiple playthroughs. I could write on and on about why I think these things, but mostly all I'm trying to demonstrate is how wildly polarizing the changes to the second game were.  I can see where people like you come from when you say you like them each having their differences though since, in fact, I'm pro change for the series as well. At times during Bloodborne I felt like I had done it already and am hoping for some shakeups to the core formula and/or mechanics in the future."
Games,3dyslt,psykedelic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:36:29 2015 UTC,"Interesting -- I felt that the soul memory thing in DS2 totally ruined replayability -- you are effectively discouraged to stop leveling, which means that any character you play for a while will eventually be able to effectively use any weapon or spell while wearing any armor in the game. In DS1, you really have to think about the type of build you want, and the different builds lead to drastically different game experiences."
Games,3dyslt,BigPoopBreakfast,-1,Tue Jul 21 03:52:22 2015 UTC,"The variety is cool for PvE, but the PvP is utter trash when it comes to variety. Strength weapons are 100% useless against any decent player now. They were just tough to use in 1.  Also invasions are totally ruined with how Soul Memory and invasion priority works.  Did you play DS1 PvP? DS2's PvP is so incredibly inferior to me I just rage quit from the game every time I play it.  Edit: Hey if you guys like it, that's fine. But I think a lot of the older players don't. DS3 is dropping a ton of 2's changes that I and many others complained about."
Games,3dyslt,Damuel,6,Tue Jul 21 02:52:27 2015 UTC,"yep played lots of both.  I continue to do ds2 pvp in sotfs.  both are great games, but I think the majority consensus is that ds2 is superior as far as pvp goes."

Games,3dyslt,Damuel,2,Tue Jul 21 05:24:43 2015 UTC,"epicnamebro for one.  he has repeatedly stated that in his opinion demons souls has the best lore, dark souls 1 the best pve, and dark souls 2 the best pvp.  also most of the souls pvp'ers prefer ds2 for pvp.    factions are better in dks2, and the pvp arena is a plus."
Games,3dyslt,woprdotmil,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:35:26 2015 UTC,"I don't watch ENB honestly.  I meant Oroboro, Peeve, Onlyafro are my main 3, and they all seemed to hate 2. There was also that guy, foxeogames* or something? He made a huge rant about DS2.  I don't see how it's possible most people liked it, if From has been confirming a lot of the changes are going back to the way 1 had it. Honestly almost every complaint I had with 2 changing, is going back to the way 1 had it (though omni roll is staying, mixed on how that will work out).  Greatswords and heavy weapons of any kind are 100% useless thanks to how stuns/poise works. Invasions are almost all ganker squads thanks to co-opers having highest priority. Soul Memory forces you to either go to max level or deal with fighting people 500 levels above you.  I dunno, I can go on and on. The only thing 2 did well was fast match making, and I guess omnirolling though that just became the new backstab fish."
Games,3dyslt,Damuel,3,Tue Jul 21 05:41:56 2015 UTC,"oro, peeve, and yukos continue to play ds2 and upload videos.  like I said, factions are better, and there is way more built variety.  build variety is a make or break component in souls pvp, and dks1 pvp is so laggy that its essentially backstab fishing.  also dks2 lets you reroll your char for different stat distribution and you can use the agape ring to negate soul mem.  shrug"
Games,3dyslt,woprdotmil,-1,Tue Jul 21 05:49:41 2015 UTC,"They play them because they've experienced 1 for ages. They don't really play DS2 much anymore. I still love DS1 far more, but I've played it for 1k hours, I've seen just about everything it has to offer, there's not much reason for me to continue.  There's more options to pick from, but if you're playing against anyone skilled said build options are totally useless.  I've honestly had more lag stabs in DS2, I've gotten facestabbed so many times in 2 I lost count. It's entirely dumb that someone can start a backstab and as long as the punch connects regardless of where you look you'll get turned and backstabbed, especially since backstabs are more painful in 2 than 1.  You can't reroll to remove soul memory.  Rings are incredibly OP, giving up a slot for soul memory is a terrible option. On top of that, I can't get more red orbs with that ring on, or repair items, or anything really. So that's hardly a valid option either."
Games,3dyslt,Damuel,1 point,Tue Jul 21 05:52:25 2015 UTC,"well, I guess you have your opinion and I have mine.  I do agree with epicnamebro regarding dark souls having better pve and dark souls 2 having better pvp."
Games,3dyslt,woprdotmil,3,Tue Jul 21 12:15:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, man I love them all. Bloodborne was so amazing and tight, and that came at the expense of replayabillity - but it was unique for that."
Games,3dyslt,SteadyHamms,2,Tue Jul 21 00:43:34 2015 UTC,"I agree with you, but for some reason DS2 just didn't mesh with me. I could not get into it no matter how much I tried. I played for about 20 hours, got pretty far, but at no point did I feel like I was having fun. It was missing something, and I just couldn't figure out what it was.  I thought I was done with the these games and was prepared to hate Bloodborne, but my god was I wrong. Bloodborne became my favourite of the franchise and re-invigorated my love for them.   I purchased Scholar of the First Sin, hoping I could give it another chance after Bloodborne, but nope, I still hate it. Demon's Souls was phenomenal, DS1 was Phenomenal, but 2 is just missing something."
Games,3dyslt,Bitemarkz,3,Tue Jul 21 13:36:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its the same for me. I can see truth in a lot of the anti-DS2 arguments, and I for one also think that Dark Souls is the superior game (my fav of all time tbh), but Dark Souls 2 is not even close to being a bad game. In fact, it was my favorite game that year."
Games,3dyslt,famousbythename,4,Tue Jul 21 00:14:21 2015 UTC,"Such a great game. The PVP and Coop are fantastic, and it was seriously the best optimized AAA game that came out in 2014. You can run DX9 Dark Souls 2 at 60 FPS on some pretty low spec computer hardware. Scholar is a little more demanding, but it's still wonderfully optimized."

Games,3dyslt,famousbythename,24,Tue Jul 21 02:08:15 2015 UTC,"I think this gives way too much credit to the first Dark Souls game. I mean, for instance, naming something ""Undead Asylum"" is somehow borderline genius - the opposite could be said that DS1 names were uninspired while ""Things Betwixt"" paints an image worth of wonder. Subjective, eloquent, but subjective."
Games,3dyslt,laalaa,33,Mon Jul 20 19:58:37 2015 UTC,The credit here is how ultimately Undead Asylum as a name contributes to the game's overall narrative and lore while Things Betwixt only enforces the unfinished ambiguity of the successor. This isn't really realized though until much later once the player has a better grasp on the two game's story and world so using it as a first 15 minutes point seems like reaching a bit to me but whatever.
Games,3dyslt,myactualnameisloris,11,Mon Jul 20 20:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm still in the DaS1 > DaS2 camp, but this video goes absolutely over the top in exaggerating what one does and the other doesn't. He's reading incredibly far into nothing."
Games,3dyslt,LotusFlare,5,Mon Jul 20 23:16:48 2015 UTC,The difference is that Undead Asylum is a name that actually describes a place in the world while Things Betwixt is just words with whimsy attached.
Games,3dyslt,PacMoron,5,Tue Jul 21 00:57:44 2015 UTC,The comparison was about what these places and their names tell you about the world and the lore. Things Betwixt doesn't tell you anything.
Games,3dyslt,donatboy91,9,Mon Jul 20 23:35:29 2015 UTC,"It kind of does tell you something, though. The start of DaS2 sees you coming from your world or land to that of Drangleic. You start your journey in Things Betwixt - literally ""the things between"". It's a border land, the cavernous place that exists in between the player's world and Drangleic. Devoid of meaningful features, possessing the mere detritus fitting of a land between two worlds."
Games,3dyslt,AlJoelson,83,Tue Jul 21 05:00:47 2015 UTC,"I have a really hard time taking a lot of Dark Souls comparisons seriously because they say ""Dark Souls 2 goes so easy on the player"" and seem completely unable to separate their own experience from the game's difficulty itself.  For example this review glorifies the fact that you have to fight the asylum demon, a boss, immediately, and praises it stylistically, but ignores the reality that throwing a difficult boss at a player with pretty much no experience in a brand new game doesn't foster a feeling of success at odds as much as it forces people away because it's frustrating and unfair and that makes it unfun. A game should not pride itself on how many new players it can turn away with its tutorial level, but some fans apparently believe that to be the case.  I'm probably unfairly skeptical of DS2 critics also because I have a friend who absolutely loved DS1, but played 30 minutes of DS2 and refuses to play the rest, citing all those hyperbolic critiques that call it a disappointment and terrible and not even a souls game. If it's true that DS2 is a disappointment of a Souls game and doesn't stay true to the series, then fuck the series, give me more DS2 games. It was enjoyable, more accessible, had a better difficulty curve, and yet still had plenty of fights that took me dozens of tries to learn and beat. It had problems, yes, but god damn are those problems dwarfed by the number of problems Dark Souls had."
Games,3dyslt,Tuatho,24,Mon Jul 20 18:34:27 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 1 or even Demon Souls wasn't designed to be difficult for the sake of being difficult anyways; they were specifically designed that way to give greater emphasis on the overbearing dark, gothic and lonely presence the games have.  At least that's vaguely what I remember Hidetaka saying once."
Games,3dyslt,Bamith,11,Mon Jul 20 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"I prefer Dark Souls 1 for various reasons, mostly the world design and more memorable encounters. But I still love Dark Souls 2. I got my 1000 gamerscore on 360 (only the third game I did that for and I got the 360 on launch) and when SotFS came out on PS4 I got the platinum once more.   My biggest issues with DS2 was just that the world felt less coherent and didn't meld together with itself as DS1 did and a few idiotic difficulty curves (pre nerf shrine of Amana made me rage). Not that DS1 was perfect either (fuck the bed of chaos).   Edit: And for the people claiming DS2 is just so much easier than DS1. I think its safe to say all the games you didn't play first are easier. I started with DS1 and then went back and played DeS which many people told me was much harder. But being familiar with the game mechanics I ended up finishing the game without any significant difficulties. More recently I found Bloodborne to be very easy compared to any other game in the series and killed most bosses on my first or second attempt (blind playthrough). Probably due to my excessive playing of Dark Souls."
Games,3dyslt,Dragarius,17,Mon Jul 20 20:32:28 2015 UTC,"I always liked the tutorial area of DS1 (haven't played DS2 yet), things like the Asylum Demon are a great learning tools without being overt and saying ""this is what you should do"". You 1st face the Demon with a broken sword, while you ""can"" defeat the Demon with this, it's very hard to do. Players are left a message in the room that says ""Run Away"" and if you do run, you soon discover some better weapons which make the next encounter with the Asylum Demon much easier.    Right here we have a lesson that I carried throughout the game. If faced with something that seems impossible to defeat, maybe it's better to go somewhere else. It's okay to come back to things when you have better/upgraded weapons.      Things like this and other ""unspoken"" lessons are why I love the tutorial area in DS1.    Edit: that's not to say there aren't some things in DS1 that are barely or terribly explained to new players. Or that critics/comparisons of DS1>DS2 are worth your time."

Games,3dyslt,puppymehard,5,Tue Jul 21 03:14:18 2015 UTC,"I agree that part is overt, but the lesson of coming back with better weapons isn't. And I've seen quite a few new-player let's plays where the player doesn't take this in for one reason or another (usually rushing or distracted by commentating). Later on they continually bump up against a wall that could be much easier to overcome with a weapon upgrade.     Plus there are other examples, like unlocked doors and environmental changes (iron ball breaking the wall) persisting through death, which is the game telling you  ""Hey you might of died, but you did this thing and another path has opened."""
Games,3dyslt,canigobacktolurking,74,Tue Jul 21 03:29:47 2015 UTC,"it's frustrating and unfair and that makes it unfun   i liked DS2 and DS1, but if people find asylum demon unfair and unfun then the game simply is not made for them. So you can say  that it perfectly sets the tone for the game. I agree with the video that it is a very cool thing to have such a boss at the start, it makes for an amazing sense of accomplishment if you beat it.   Both games have their good and bad things, and generally i enjoyed DS2 more because i found the gameplay better and gameplay is the most important thing for me. I really don't care much if the map makes geographical sense, if people hadn't pointed it out i would have never even realized it."
Games,3dyslt,Coldara,-6,Mon Jul 20 19:03:03 2015 UTC,What you're saying just isn't true. The Asylum Demon turned me away from Dark Souls but once I played DS2 and went back to it it was more fun because I actually knew what I was doing. It isn't that the game wasn't for me I just didn't enjoy being dropped into a boss fight instantly. DS2 (and Bloodborne) fixed that problem for me.
Games,3dyslt,Freezenification,23,Mon Jul 20 23:05:40 2015 UTC,"So what you are saying that after you beat DS2 you were good enough to beat DS1, because you have become a better player. How is that in contrast to what i said?"
Games,3dyslt,Coldara,18,Mon Jul 20 23:19:17 2015 UTC,"It's a contrast because being dropped into a hard boss in a tutorial level was a huge turnoff for him and pushed him away from the game. He had to go play through a whole different game, helped by a better learning curve, before he felt he could come back and have fun in dark souls."
Games,3dyslt,Rokk017,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:39:47 2015 UTC,"Yes but the 2 games are different, dark souls 1 isn't as accesible and a tad harder than dark souls 2. So DS1 at that time wasn't the game for him while DS2 was, and once he was a good enough player he could go back to DS1."
Games,3dyslt,Coldara,4,Tue Jul 21 08:55:58 2015 UTC,"i liked DS2 and DS1, but if people find asylum demon unfair and unfun then the game simply is not made for them   The game was for me it's just the Asylum Demon made it seem as if it wasn't because it wasn't fun as I didn't even know how to play properly yet. Dark Souls 2 is a lot better in that regard because it eases you in and actually teaches you."
Games,3dyslt,Freezenification,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:59:33 2015 UTC,"Trial by fire.  I had the same experience with Dark Souls, the game beat me, I beat my head against the brick wall and rushed and raged and didn't progress past the shielded knights in Undead Burg, and I bought Dark Souls 2 out of spite, later coming back to Dark Souls and beating most of it easily.  Dark Souls 2 overall was more consistently difficult, but unfairly so as I progressed, enemies had higher poise and health on average, which restricted viable strategies and encouraged cheap tactics, whereas Dark Souls had difficulty spikes, but rarely stacked the odds against you or felt cheap.   I disagree, Dark Souls 2 doesn't teach you anything well, the tutorial gives you a few basics, but it's awkward and jarring, whereas Dark Souls gave you a small tutorial in a linear level format, ending with a very simple boss that demonstrates the importance of learning attack patterns and movement strategies.   The entirety of Undead Burg is a better tutorial than Dark Souls 2's tutorial and Forest of Giants, you are introduced to a series of varied and increasingly difficult enemy groups, culminating in the games first challenging boss, which can be beaten by the same basic strategy as the Asylum Demon, but gives you far less breathing room overall.   The Asylum Demon is the epitome of trial by fire, you can't finish the tutorial until you learn how to manage boss fights, by playing defensive until you learn is attack pattern, and exploiting his vulnerabilities. Dark Souls 2 does not do this, it waits too long, it's tutorial is pathetic, and the Forest forest of Giants ends in a confusingly laid out ruin with groups of enemies that come to define the games main flaw."
Games,3dyslt,Real-Terminal,2,Tue Jul 21 13:42:10 2015 UTC,Not sure how you can even try make the argument that Dark Souls teaches you better than Dark Souls 2 does when you yourself had to play two to get into one. Surely if the original taught you better you would have gotten into it first try? What you're saying doesn't make add up.  Trials by fire are stupid. There is nothing wrong with easing you into something.
Games,3dyslt,Freezenification,-16,Tue Jul 21 14:36:33 2015 UTC,"Because he got dropped into a bossfight with no idea as to what he was doing, died, and disliked it, then got to learn how to play and liked it??  How does it not?"

I personally know of three people besides myself who tried the game, quit because the asylum demon was ridiculous, and then came back later at the behest of our friends and bullied through it to enjoy the rest of the game. That is not a successful or even passably okay introduction.   Not only is it essentially unfair, but it does not set the tone of the game because no other boss is thrown at you at a point in time when you're not even yet familiar with something as essential as the basic controls of the game.  That's a pure degree of unfairness that is never echoed throughout the entire rest of the game where most, if not all of your deaths are going to be learning the mechanics of the fight and acting on that understanding. The Asylum demon requires those, learning the fight and using that learning, plus the usage of new control's flawlessly (Something really fucking hard to do that a lot of experienced players have utterly forgotten), and the frame of mind to persevere through this  difficulty piled on top of a new player as if it's expected and reasonable, something the asylum demon is supposed to be teaching you!"
Games,3dyslt,Tuatho,33,Mon Jul 20 19:18:57 2015 UTC,"I would definitely argue the Asylum demon sets the tone for the game quite well. Especially since the Taurus Demon is going to be the next logical boss.    What new players aren't understanding about the boss fight, and what veteran players know quite well is that its okay to die. Many people's progress through Dark Souls is measured in deaths. The Asylum Demon teaches you one if the primary fundamentals of Dark Souls, and that is to decipher boss fights bit by bit, apply what you learn the next time around, be quick to adapt, don't get greedy.    Frustration comes because new players view death as failure, they don't learn from it. All of us who have extensively played the Souls series, do we always expect to 1 shot a new boss our first encounter? Of course not. The Asylum Demon is there to teach that to new players."
Games,3dyslt,T3hSwagman,4,Mon Jul 20 19:55:45 2015 UTC,"I mean, the game says, ""Get away!"" right in the Asylum Demon boss area. You're not meant to fight him right away, and the game tells you so. If you don't see the door to escape, that's not the game's fault. You just need to be more perceptive.  IMO, Asylum Demon is there to show you what you're up against. And if he kills you, he's there to teach you how death works. And to me, that is the perfect intro to the game. They don't fuck around. They value your skill and never throw anything at you they don't think you're equipped to face. And if they do, they tell you to run away!  Only after you gain your gear and attack him from above does he become a boss. Before any of that, he's just another tutorial."
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,2,Mon Jul 20 19:38:54 2015 UTC,"He's also there because he is the gate keeper. Beating him proves you are a chosen undead, which sets up a lot of the story."
Games,3dyslt,quickmilk,10,Tue Jul 21 08:02:38 2015 UTC,"They value your skill and never throw anything at you they don't think you're equipped to face.   Haha, I just had a good laugh remembering me first time I played Dark Souls, going towards the catacombs (the guy in the shrine told me there was two bells and I wanted to do the bottom one first, so I went down!), and getting wrecked hardcore by skeletons. It took me half an hour of running around Firelink Shrine before finding the stairs to the Burg."
Games,3dyslt,Floirt,4,Tue Jul 21 14:30:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I feel like the ambiance surrounding the game of, ""ZOMG DARK SOULS IS SO HARD. HARDEST GAME EVAR."" kind of hurts the player a bit. Instead of thinking, ""Huh, this area is really hard. I should try another route,"" they continue on the wrong path because what they've heard about the game leads them to believe that the entire thing SHOULD be that hard, and in reality, it's not.  Dark Souls is my favorite game, by far. I wish I could go and experience it for the first time again. :')"
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,2,Tue Jul 21 15:29:05 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. The (very misleading) hype behind Demon's Souls difficulty made me think the games were something like Ninja Gaiden: very demanding of the player's combat skills and unapologetic of that fact. So when I first got my ass kicked by the skeletons near the beginning, I assumed this was how the game was supposed to work. When I went to the stairs to the Undead Burgh and actually got souls for killing things I slapped my forehead and realized that the game had been trying to communicate something to me the entire time. That very first sticking point taught me all I needed to know about Dark Souls: that it wasn't going to hold my hand but rather give me clues I had to pick up to understand what to do, and that it also wasn't a game of throwing myself against a brick wall. There's almost always a smarter route."
Games,3dyslt,Nickoten,7,Tue Jul 21 18:37:49 2015 UTC,"Wonderfully put. Couldn't have said it better myself.   And I feel like Dark Souls 2 kind of lost that grace of game design. The B Team kind of fell into the trap of ""zomg dis game is hard"" and lost the subtlety of Dark Souls 1's teaching mechanics. I mean, there's an achievement for dying in Dark Souls 2 called ""Welcome to Dark Souls"". They're just playing up the inaccurate stereotype."
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,4,Tue Jul 21 18:42:13 2015 UTC,"Hard to commentate for me on that since i don't know you or your friends, but keep in my that every game has its target audience.   Personally me and my friends were kinda challenged by the demon, so it was a really cool experience. I remember when i caught glimpses of the boss (""oh shit, will i have to fight that?!""), then stepping through the Mist. I was kinda blown away, and then winning the fight was such a cool experience and it really imprinted the ""Welcome to dark souls""-feeling.   So yeah, thinking that ""to be more accesible"" we would have to sacrafice this moment is something that i really dislike.   It has been quite some time, but i really feel that you are exaggerating with how hard the demon was, and your friends probably just weren't good enough players. And that is okay, again, games are not made for anyone. Recently one friend was blown away by Bloodborne while an other one gave the game back the next day because he was simply to bad to enjoy the game.  Again, please don't take this as a ""git gud"" comment."
Games,3dyslt,Coldara,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"Not only is it essentially unfair, but it does not set the tone of the game because no other boss is thrown at you at a point in time when you're not even yet familiar with something as essential as the basic controls of the game.   This is actually a good point. Even if you get the first ""run away"" hint and, you know, run; you still end up facing off against Asylum Demon ""for real"" shortly afterwards.  I think Demon's Souls did it better - you're not meant to be able to beat the tutorial boss (though it's possible); and the first actual boss comes after you've fought your way through a number of weaker enemies."
Games,3dyslt,kemitche,5,Mon Jul 20 22:16:05 2015 UTC,"The bosses in demons souls are nothing like dark souls bosses, pretty much all of them were gimicky (not in a bad way) where you had to work out the trick to beating them.   The only ones that were like dark souls bosses, that is big tough enemies that you need to roll through their attack patterns and find opening, are Penetrator and False King (I think). Bosses like Phalanx and Adjuticator were about finding the trick and replaying the game they are very easy."
Games,3dyslt,AFunctionOfX,9,Tue Jul 21 00:27:33 2015 UTC,"Demon's Souls introduction is definitely more deliberately paced, but also consider that Dark Souls does have you fight through at least two waves of enemies before fighting the boss, and also that Phalanx (while brilliant and one of my favorite fights in the Souls games) is a much more demanding boss than Asylum Demon, which basically boils down to strafing and blocking.   I bet Asylum Demon has turned some people away from the game, but it's also been no problem for many other people, including those not that great at games (this is of course anecdotal like any account of Asylum Demon success/failure). I think at some point we do have to accept that any amount of challenge in any game will turn away some portion of the audience, and it's just a matter of how big of a portion you're comfortable with turning away."
Games,3dyslt,Nickoten,7,Tue Jul 21 18:43:39 2015 UTC,The entire point of the asylum demon is to make sure the player has a basic grasp of the game before heading to lordran. Before you fight the asylum the are instructions to the combat and after it there are none. Why would the player not have a grasp of the game before the fight but somehow have it after? If you can't beat the asylum demon you are not ready to progress. Why is this such a strange idea to so many people?   I know games are expected to spoonfeed the player by a lot of people but that's what made dark souls great: it resisted a lot modern design trends that neuter many games and became something truly unique.
Games,3dyslt,Eel_Up_Butt,7,Mon Jul 20 23:24:49 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you here, and I LOVE this series. I've played all four games at least twice, and the intro to Dark Souls is the worst of the series, IMO. Like someone below said, Demon's had a great intro. You fight through a few normal enemies and when you get to the boss you can kill it, but you're not strictly meant to. Bloodborne was similar, you can kill the werewolf unarmed but you're not meant to and he becomes significantly easier once you get your weapons.  It's a great series and the punishing difficulty is a signature I wouldn't change, but way too many fans seem to have that ""hardcore"" mentality towards the intro sequences. Personally, I would like more people to play the game, and an intro that doesn't throw you at rocket speed at a brick wall would go a long way towards player retention past the first ten minutes. It took me a year to get four of my friends into the game after multiple attempts, and I ended up getting them hooked on Demons first because the intro was better."
Games,3dyslt,HansGruberIsTheMan,25,Mon Jul 20 23:04:58 2015 UTC,Sounds like it isn't your type of game. Why are you letting people bully you into playing a game?
Games,3dyslt,Grogel,64,Mon Jul 20 20:12:11 2015 UTC,You don't have to fight it immediately and they set it up so that you can drop his health my more than half with one attack. That's pretty lenient.
Games,3dyslt,Mnstrzero00,9,Tue Jul 21 03:03:31 2015 UTC,> it's frustrating and unfair and that makes it unfun  Maybe for you. DS2 never captivated me nearly as much as DS1. Give me more DS1 games.
Games,3dyslt,Grogel,5,Mon Jul 20 20:11:03 2015 UTC,"Why are so many people convinced that every game has to be instantly accessible to everyone that plays it without requiring anything from the player? It's ridiculous how many seem to entirely miss the point of the undead asylum in the first game.  The undead asylum is a sign of things to come. It does a great job of foreshadowing the rest of the game and preparing the player for the journey ahead. Yes, that means challenging the player. After being introduced to the games mechanics the player is forced to fight a boss. Does this have the potential to be unfair? Yes. Is it? No. If you payed attention to everything the game had told you so far you have the tools required to defeat the boss. It forces you to have a basic grasp on the mechanics of the game while not being challenging enough to be frustrating. It forces to familiarize yourself with the game before the stakes are raised.  That is good, thoughtful game desing, and i don't think it should be given up in favor of casting as wide a net as possible. A game should be allowed to expect something from the player and people need to stop having the mentality that every game needs to appeal to everyone at the cost of quality. In no other media is appealing to the lowest common denominator seen as a positive, why should it with games?  I was in the same situation as your friend when i first played dark souls 2 because the introduction to the game was so bad. I've since given it another chance and quite like the game overall but the tutorial sort of highlights everything that could have gone wrong with a sequel to dark souls. Cutscenes, funneling the played, minimal challenge and nothing to keep you engaged. It felt way to similar to the lazy game design that can be found in so many other modern games. That is exactly what the first game didn't have, what made it such a phenomenon. This is (luckily) mostly contained to the beginning of the game though. The rest of the game is very good, although not at all as good as dark souls 1 in my opinion.  Dark souls 2 would have been much better off if it wasn't called dark souls 2. The name just brings up endless comparisons to the first game and makes it harder for fans of the first game to appreciate as a standalone game. They are two very different games and it's unfair to compare them even though them belonging to the same franchise necessitates it."
Games,3dyslt,Eel_Up_Butt,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:32 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. They are very similar. To me dark souls is awesome character creation through builds and the amazing selection of armor and weapons. I love replaying the game and be like ""yea I think I will use that weapon you find early that takes a bunch of X stat this time"" or ""oh sick these random 4 peices of armor I've never liked much look awesome together"". Also the way multiplayer works with the messages, spirits walking around, bloodstains (omg blood stain piles are hilarious in Scholar of the First Sin), and the fantastic coop/pvp where the builds and diversity really shines. Also the lore, don't get me started on the lore in these games, simply put anything that makes me ask why or want to know more or tickles my intrest/makes me come up with explanations is amazing.  Both dark souls games have all of the above, and I love them both.   Personally though I prefer dark souls 2 because of the changes in poise (I like that daggers and dual small weapons can be used in pvp, it used to all be about poise and 2handers) and the use of the agility stat. Removing resistance as a stat was also a good call in my book.  Also being able to go different routes is always fun in Dark Souls 2. I can go straight to the no man's worf and grab a branch and I have 4 different routes I can go. Lost Bastille, Huntmens Copse, Shaded woods, and the gutter are all open, with any loot I intend to rush to at my fingertips.   Another thing that was big for me was that Dark Souls 1 pc port I first played it on ran pretty shitty and had limited multiplayer (took insane times for matches because of windows live). The Dark Souls 2 port was amazing in comparison and ran smoother than 1. So as much as I loved 1 I didn't have the want to go back to the old system, though now that windows live is dead I bet it would be fantastic. I still love them both have something like 600 hours in both, but I just can't comprehend how someone who says they like dark souls can't find a way to enjoy dark souls 2."
Games,3dyslt,Manbrodude,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:47:49 2015 UTC,"The unrelenting hatred is just the creation of a fanbase that has become soaked up in their own nostalgia and overanalyzing.  The folks want to tear it down because they partially dont understand where the genre came from..  I think youll find many Dark Souls players jumped ship with DS2 when it didnt BLOW THEIR FUCKING MINDS OUT THEIR SKULLS rather than realizing something quite simple : This is a unique 'genre'... its not going to blast your brain out the back of your head like it did the first time.  Embrace the core gameplay, see what unique changes they made to it, and push forward with your dungeon crawl.  Having played Demons, then Dark, then Dark 2, then Bloodborne I go into them with the appropriate expectations.. I think some people played Dark 1, had their brains utterly blown out of their head and wanted that again... Sorry dudes, you dont get to experience ""that level"" of mindfuck twice.. from there you must enjoy the mechanics for what they are... or move on to something else.  EDIT:  I assume Dark Souls 3 will be the true test for the series' staying power.  Either way, I am happy Miyazaki and From got to make us this many.  I still remember booting up the korean version of Demons back in like February 2009 and just having my mind absolutely blown.. and thinking these bastards who made it mustve been utterly bonkers.  Just insane game designers.  For the first 2 days I couldnt tell if the game was fundamentally broken or brilliant lol.    Dark Souls 1 was a nice step up with the open world.. but ya, I think people wanted DS2 to blow their socks off and it just aint gonna happen, ladies and gents.  You 'get it', you understand the core mechanics enough that it will be a game about you overcoming adversity, not being shocked at every turn.  For me - thats plenty, its why I play the shit out of these games... some people need the shock factor.. but I assume we will see what sort of staying power the Souls series has after 3 releases.. which fans jumped ship and which came back to dig deeper into this madness lol."
Games,3dyslt,RockBandDood,5,Mon Jul 20 18:40:25 2015 UTC,"SPOILERS FOR DARK SOULS 2  I disagree, I think you're downplaying Dark Souls 2's valid criticism too much. These past 2 months I've played and finished both Dark Souls 1 and 2 for the first time and I have to say a lot of the critiques hit right on the spot.   A lot of Dark Souls 2 bosses are really forgettable and extremely easy compared to the first one. The ones I found the easiest in no particular order were The Last Giant, Skeleton Lords, Flexile Sentry, Lost Sinner, Ruin Sentinels, Royal Rat Vanguard, Scoprionness Najka, Demon of Song, Magnus and Congregation, Dragonride (by far the easiest) and fucking Nashandra. I was extremely disappointed that I actually got Nashandra on my first try, I was like ""is this it?"", this is supposed to be the final boss?   Also the bonfires were way too many, they sacrificed shortcuts and instead plonked down 3-4 bonfires per level when they didn't demand it, and let's not go down the hole of plain bad corridor-like level design, I couldn't believe how weirdly linear Vendrick's castle was, or how the Shrine was by all effect a curved line on water."
Games,3dyslt,SDStormtrooper,5,Mon Jul 20 18:55:38 2015 UTC,"The thing is that different people find different things hard. I found Flexile Sentry, Ruin Sentinels, the Demon of Song and Nashandra difficult. It just depends on which bosses work for or against your playstyle and build."
Games,3dyslt,ToastedFishSandwich,4,Mon Jul 20 23:56:22 2015 UTC,"Just out of curiosity, what did you find hard about Demon of Song? I found it insultingly easy since its attacks were so slow and telegraphed and always came out one at a time, followed by a lengthy period of vulnerability."
Games,3dyslt,thefezhat,2,Tue Jul 21 01:41:58 2015 UTC,It's hard to say. I'd just always get swiped in the head when I went for its face (plus it took me about two deaths just to figure out that I should be going for the face rather than circling around).

I'm not saying that you didn't find them difficult... But speaking on a relative level, compared to the baseline that most people would expect, I'd say those bosses are definitely extremely easy."

The enemies were powerful enough to kill you in a few shots too. I got around it by just sprinting to the section I needed to go to, but that's what frustrated me about the DLC. DS2 is still great though.  And it's so well optimized too. I don't know if I installed dsfix for DS1 incorrectly, but it's always very noticeable playing 2 after a session with the 1st game. DS2 is butter smooth."

Games,3dyslt,DunderJawa,4,Tue Jul 21 12:30:58 2015 UTC,"But thats exactly my point - the series is going to take each sequel into a somewhat different direction.  This is just speaking for myself : I dont WANT the Souls games to try to do the exact same thing.  I want them to mix it up.  DS2 letting itself not be so confined by 'attaching' all the land areas smoothly allowed it to follow its own flow from area to area without making itself into a Dark Souls 1 retread of ""oh, you will always find your way back to firelink""  Demons Souls was set up like Phantasy Star Online or Diablo - you went into your waypoint and that was your world.  Dark Souls went full open world with everything interconnected to Firelink.  Dark Souls 2 does that as well but with less of an obsession on that and more on pushing forward and outward.. which I thought felt good and made sense with the pace of the game.  Bloodborne is similar to Demon's in that you go back to the ""nexus"" but similar to Dark Souls in that the world is interconnected... although the connections are pretty much you pushing forward through it, not looping around back to FireLink like in DS1  The point im making is - the games are all going to have their own little flare.  Right now the Souls series is finding itself in a place Mario did years ago - Are you people going to enjoy the core gameplay to continue going on these adventures that rely on these core mechanics but mix it up in how the world is presented... or are you all going to get bored because your socks werent blown off like Dark Souls 1 did?  Thats my point.. dont expect DS3 to BLOW YOUR FUCKING MIND - cause its not going to.  None of them will.  They will be an extension of what youve seen with some new variables tossed in to mix things up... what you decide to do from there is up to you, you can embrace the core gameplay and enjoy.. or overly critique a buncha random crap game to game that is there with the intention of mixing it up so you arent getting an utterly rehashed experience.  The choice is yours.. keep going down the pit of the Souls games or just turn around and tell em to fuck off... either option is okay.  I just have been surprised by the fan reaction to Dark Souls 2.. when I really cant list many things they actually did WRONG.. what I can list are expectations made by nostalgic men and women who wanted their socks blown off again, though"
Games,3dyslt,RockBandDood,2,Mon Jul 20 19:13:05 2015 UTC,"I guess then if you use this as a justification for (imo) boring level design then you still have to problem of boring, easy bosses which seem to pop up everywhere and way too frequent bonfires."
Games,3dyslt,SDStormtrooper,6,Mon Jul 20 19:32:28 2015 UTC,"Ehh, I found quite a few of Dark Souls 2 environments to be quite beautiful and unlike anything else in the series.  It seems it all does come down to a matter of opinion - but I walk into a Souls game looking for what makes it unique in series.. I found no particular problems with Dark Souls 2.. you seem to have had quite a few things that bugged ya, to each their own.  Still think you should try it again with the modded version to get the full experience, though.  I didnt even play vanilla for more than about 10 minutes before modding my shadows back in.  Game was amazing.  Some of the dungeons you legit had to use the torch to find your way through and they were utterly pitch black... with lights along the way you lit to 'lead' you for the next time you died, acting as a bonfire that didnt heal you.    That alone was unlike any dungeon crawling experience Ive ever had in a game.. really makes Dark Souls 2 a 10/10 for me with the lighting mods on."

Sure, they weren't as connected as DS1, but honestly I was never too impressed by the mere fact that the devs were able to connect zones, especially since a lot of the zones were kind of a chore. DS2, on the other hand, had quite a lot of beautiful views and places that seemed interesting to me. Sure, it didn't really make geological sense, but nothing makes logical sense in Dark Souls games."
Games,3dyslt,Fyrus,3,Mon Jul 20 20:08:27 2015 UTC,"The not making geological sense is kind of a big deal imo, it just says to me they couldn't decide between having a central hub like in Demon's or having an interconnected world like in DS1. This is especially supported by the game letting you teleport to pretty much every bonfire right from the get-go. The weird non-sensical area transitions in DS2 also shows a lack of attention to detail that the first game didn't have."

Also, teleporting is less harmful to DS1 because bonfires are spaced so far apart. You still have long periods of uninterrupted exploration.  Also, really? Awkward transition areas? Kind of like elevators that go somehow defy logic and go up to a lava fortress? What do you mean by awkward?  I concede that DS1 becomes weaker in overall design after you aquire the Lord Vessel. The game feels rushed and the design isn't as intricate. But, I feel as though you could literally chop the game in half and make O&S the last boss in the game and and I'd still find it a better game than DS2."
Games,3dyslt,PacMoron,6,Tue Jul 21 06:09:28 2015 UTC,"The zones in Dark Souls 2 are not linear pathways.  The amount of bonfires is a definite positive though, there's nothing fun about replaying the same material over and over.  Shortcuts are not a strength of any of these games.  Very minor.  Not worth mentioning.    Awkwardness is about the zone design itself.  The way the eye moves across the terrain, the shape of the terrain, and that ilk.  Dark Souls 1 has quite a few zones that I would describe as having straight garbage level design, such as Anor Londo.  The transition from Anor Londo to Duke's Archives is a tight and linear pathway that is boring to traverse.  Just moving around Anor Londo is a pain in the ass because of how spread apart everything is and how the designers spent all their time on how it looked and not on how it felt to play it.  That's a flaw with Dark Souls 1 that runs through the entire game.  There's nothing fun about Valley of the Drakes.  The enemies suck to fight against, the boss is a laughable pushover, and navigating the zone is boring.  It feels like a half-assed zone strung together just to link a couple other areas.  Awkward and heavy handed."
Games,3dyslt,KarsaOrlong42,2,Tue Jul 21 07:11:24 2015 UTC,I honestly wouldn't mind DS2 so much if they didn't have soul memory or enemies not respawning after you kill them a bunch.
Games,3dyslt,Narrative_Causality,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:39:12 2015 UTC,"And dark souls 2 also had the best boss fight of the series,  Burnt Ivory King.  Its been my experience that most people who complain about dark souls 2 never touched the dlc,  which was far beyond the base game and often better than anything in dark souls 1  Fume Night, Sir Alonne, Sinh the Slumbering Dragon,  all challenging but fun boss fights"
Games,3dyslt,KingOfWeasels42,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:01:29 2015 UTC,Burnt Ivory King.   DS2 DLC was very well done. I would like to note that most people when criticizing DS2 mean the base game as they never went on to play the DLC. DLC included DS2 becomes a very solid game and a pretty good one based on those.   I think DS2 actually showed it's potential with the DLC but I feel that DS2 cannot make the claim to be superior or equal when it's base game suffers as much as it does and can only be supported by those crowns holding it up.

Especially Artorias and Kalameet, which I think had more challenging movesets and more interesting arenas than the stuff in DS2's dlc. I think Dark Souls 1 as a base game is more interesting than DS2 aswell, especially in terms of exploration."
Games,3dyslt,Rinkahsabs,8,Mon Jul 20 19:05:20 2015 UTC,I did play the DLC  in Dark Souls 2 (didn't play it in Dark Souls 1 though because I thought the way to get to the DLC was really stupid) as a matter of fact and really liked it. The Burn Ivory King fight was definitely one of the more challenging boss fights in both DS1 and 2.  Edit: also getting the help of the knights didn't feel like cheesing as much as summoning and I felt like a badass when I stood before the fog gat and they all got their weapons ready
Games,3dyslt,SDStormtrooper,-3,Mon Jul 20 19:03:42 2015 UTC,You're really missing out if you didn't play the Artorias of the Abyss DLC. Imo it contains some of the best boss fights of the entire series.

If you played Demon's, you'll find that the bosses are quite easy, when compared to the bosses in Dark Souls 1. I do agree that the Bosses in DS2 are quite unimaginative, thought (mostly just large dudes with weapons). The boss fights in Demons where by far the most creative ones (not counting Bloodbourne, since I haven't played it yet)."

Games,3dyslt,SDStormtrooper,5,Mon Jul 20 20:57:53 2015 UTC,"You're missing the key part here and a major error Bloodborn also hit /u/SDStormtrooper mention's memorable. Maiden Astraea, is she a hard boss? Is Garl Vinaland actually that difficult? No not really but she's one of the most memorable bosses in Demon's Soul's.   Nearly every boss in Demon's Soul's and Dark Souls is memorable and you take or leave a bit of yourself with them. Even the Taurus demon which is canonically the first has his own tiny element of dick baggery and the area you fight him in is iconic, it's still bright the sun still shines on you, your first triumph out in the open air, wait until your choking in the sewers with what you thought was a little snake..no a crocodile..no a liz..oh god what the hell is that?  The bosses in DS2 had far less story behind them, the bosses were also far more human or human shaped than the DS1 bosses. Human bosses stand out less, the bosses need solid backstory for them to be memorable and thinking back to Demon's and DS1 every human boss had a massive helping of lore behind them, in Queelag's case literally behind them, that was missing for a lot of DS2.   The next part here is level design, a level needs to be memorable as it's also a part of the boss. The DLCs for DS2 were quite good but many of the levels in vanilla DS2 were forgettable with the numerous shortcuts and bonfires. What made blight town so memorable? Fuck blight town is what made it so memorable, just like the Valley of Defilement. The easy free movement and flow of DS2 and Bloodborn led to a greatly reduced feel for the levels, the memorability of them was lacking just because of how they were structured.  All this said, DS2 and Bloodborn aren't bad games they're just not incredible games and we should remember sometimes that that's ok. Not everyone can be a winner."
Games,3dyslt,Skellum,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:33:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree on Bloodborne. Many of the bosses on Bloodborne are amazing and challenging. They instill fear and are backed by great lore. Gascoigne for example. The locations are also very memorable. I love it that you can see 3 bosses just from the first lamp in Yharnam (Bridge of Cleric, Bridge of Gascoigne and the Church of BSB. This is also something DS2 was missing that DS1 and BB did fantasticly: having vistas of the level. Other fantastic locations are Yahargul because of its dense and uncomfortable atmosphere and background music and a forest where you actually get lost in with freakish enemies that foreshadow a huge change in the plot. Other places, like the Upper Cathedral ward (with its vistas again) are also stunning.  I know this has been a very badly structured reply but it's pretty late here. I just wanted to point out that Bloodborne is just as masterfully crafted as DS1 and Demon's Souls, maybe even with a generally higher level of maintenance (DS1 drops in quality after Anor Londo). I don't know how much you played it but it seems like you have a superficial view on the game (no offense). The only critique I can give is that it lacks content, the Chalice Dungeons are horrible and the gem system is broken (even though it is an interesting mechanic). Yet the main game is just wonderful.  P.S. Dark Souls 1 is still my favorite."

I was one of the people who went back to Demon's Souls after playing Dark and there were so many really amazing things about it that I thought still felt fresh interesting even after playing Dark Souls. Then I played Bloodborne and it also really impressed me in its own ways (though it, too, had some things I really didn't like).  I'm not saying Dark Souls 2 is garbage that no one should like, just that the notion that the only reason I could not enjoy it but enjoy Dark Souls 1 would be nostalgia feels like a cop out of an argument with no logical basis. It's basically insinuating that I have no ability to think critically about a game past my first impression of it. That's not an argument, it's basically a personal attack.  I guarantee there are plenty of good arguments someone could make for the case that Dark Souls 2 is a better game than the first two, though I may not agree with those arguments.

My brother is a huge fan of Dark Souls so I let him borrow my Ps3 and Demon's Souls.  He stopped playing after a few hours.  Told me it was like a crappier Dark Souls.

In all reality, if Dark Souls 1 hadnt existed and Dark Souls 2 was unleashed on the world after Demon's Souls... Do we think Dark Souls 2 would have had largely the same impact Dark Souls 1 did?  I think so, I mean, I think DS2 is 85-90% of what made Dark Souls 1 great with some arguably weaker but also some stronger elements as well.  If DS2 had been released and not DS1.. I still think it would have set the gaming world on fire.  And thats kind of the overall point I was trying to make - the games are so similar fundamentally, yes, they mix up some fun stuff like world structure/healing items/etc but largely its the same game, has been since Demon's.  If the core gameplay isnt something the masses can embrace and instead need the have their minds constantly blown.. I just feel like theyre setting themselves up for disapointment.  So far the series has been an evolution we have gotten to see play out before our eyes since Demon's and for me - its fun to see what variables they will mix up for the next one - not anticipating an all out mindblowing sequel cause I just doubt its possible... and thats cool.

Video games don't always have to be fun... I mean, isn't that just such a lazy, non descriptive word? It doesn't really mean anything.. ""I had fun"".   A friend who worked with Microsoft once told me that their focus testing groups used to dread that word if it came out of a users mouth because it means nothing, and at worst it means they weren't even paying attention to the game. If you ask someone to describe a game in one word, fun is the last word you want to hear. In terms of a game like Mario, which some may think is the epitome of fun, you'd rather hear something like ""turtle"" or ""stomping"" or ""goomba"" because that shows your player was engaged.  Are horror games ""fun?"" Sure you could say that some people have fun being scared but that seems like it's proving that that stupid word is used in too broad a sense. Games don't always have to be ""fun"". You even used the word ""unfun"", which isn't even a word.  I'd argue that many players found a lot of enjoyment from the first boss of dark souls because it didn't pull any punches. Sure, it is hard for a first time player, but not that hard. You can even start the battle with a critical hit to it if you read the floor notes. Not many games give you that opportunity.   Why should every game have an easy first boss? Isn't this what sets dark souls apart, and now you are criticising it because of that? I think it's brave of the developers to make the game how they wanted without any real fear that some would not enjoy it. They didn't appeal to the lowest common denominator and yet still gave that audience every chance to ale the fight easier on themselves."
Games,3dyslt,quickmilk,17,Mon Jul 20 21:56:37 2015 UTC,"Which game you prefer depends mainly on what you are getting out of those games. DS1 has a tightly constructed minimalist backstory and setting that does a lot with very little, it has more memorable individual moments particularly early on in the game, and it feels as if its lore tells a more complete story of a world - The holes in the story feel like mysteries instead of actual HOLES in an incomplete tale.  DS2 on the other hand has better polished mechanics, the game gives you more options in terms of how you approach gameplay challenges, as options like dual wielding, ranged weapons and magic are more viable or at least better fleshed out. Character building offers more choice, and character/item progression in the game flows better, since you have room to fiddle about with upgrading multiple weapons and dabbling in different strategies in a single play through. DS2's world design is also less likely to turn players away, as it gives you real choices about where to go in the first half of the game, instead of saving that for a 2nd chapter. This is helpful for players that feel genuinely stuck. It would be interesting to see statistics of how many people quit DS1 after resting at a bonfire in the middle of Blighttown.  Ideally, DS3 would combine the better parts of both games, as both games have their merits."

Play just about any other fantasy RPG and you have your accessible, easy to understand video game. I dont understand why you people have to target the ONE FUCKING GAME that was made for people who enjoy a real damn challenge and turn it into another generic, accessible title just like the rest (which DS2 didn't do entirely, but it was certainly a step in that direction).  Yes, the game is going to turn people away, but there's nothing wrong with that. It doesn't have to be a game every child and their grandmother can ""ease into"".   At least Dark Souls 1 was fair, DS2 never found a balance between too easy and ridiculously unfair. Instead they gave an artificial difficulty where you were swamped with generic baddies and your animations were slowed to a sluggish speed to make the game seem hard, when it wasn't that, it usually just encouraged you to cheese your enemy. I have no idea what people see in that game, it simply isn't good."

DS 2 also isn't bad because it's easier, it's worse than DS 1 because it just not as polished gameplay wise. The difficulty comes from more easier enemies instead of better placement of less mobs which are in general harder. DS 2 just misses a lot DS 1 had going for it. It's a matter of taste and just because it wasn't something for you doesn't mean that other people didn't enjoyed it. DS 2 is already in the process of making the franchise more user friendly and by DS 4 we'll have Tomb Raiser like Souls game and no one should want that.

Games,3dyslt,envirosani,6,Tue Jul 21 14:07:29 2015 UTC,"A lot of people in hear speaking out against those critiquing DSII.  The main problems for me in II were that the level design was just absolutely tragic. Dark souls, and Demons souls set you up to think that the Dark Souls worlds make sense. You find items in places that make sense, enemies in places that make sense, you can tell the best way to approach a new enemy type usually just by looking at it etc. But II throws that out the window. You can either kill 4 of the strongest beings to ever exist, or hop over a small pile of rubble. Of course the rubble has an invisible wall over it so I GUESS WE GOTTA KILL THE IMMORTAL BEINGS. Super lazy.  It also seems the II team completely misunderstood what made DaS and Demons challenging. Tough enemies, good enemy placement, and fair fights. DaS has 2(?) bosses that have multiple enemies, not counting NG+ or Pinwheel.  That number jumps up to somewhere around 10 in II. And that philosophy shows throughout the rest of the game. It's like they chose to force the player to fight more enemies at once. Dark Souls combat so far has been largely focused on 1v1 combat, and dispatching one foe before moving on to another. While DaS II throws a ton of enemies at you at once for pretty much the entire game.  The team misunderstood ""Tough but fair."" and replaced it with, ""Add enemies"".  Dark souls 2 was HARDER, but not for any good reason. Instead of feeling challenged when I got stuck, I felt frustrated. Case in point Shrine of Amana and the last hallway leading up to Velstadt.  Players of the previous games were coming from a standpoint of ""This world will make sense, and I will be challenged"" And I get why a ton of people were put off from the much more segmented, much more ""gamey"" Dark Souls II.  That being said, it was fun as fuck, and I played the shit out of it. And the PvP is insanely better (Even if theres no red eye orb, which is pretty fucking dumb.) It just isn't the masterpiece that Dark Souls 1 was. But that's okay, they did pretty well without Miyazaki."
Games,3dyslt,TbanksIV,4,Tue Jul 21 14:10:22 2015 UTC,"But that's okay, they did pretty well without Miyazaki   They would have done even better if they had never hired Shibuya and had Tanimura working on it from the start. Tanimura essentially had to clean up after Shibuya's mess and salvage the game. If Tanimura was there from the start, we would have the whole game with the level of quality in the DLCs, which are almost unanimously said to be either on par or superior to DS1. I'm very glad that Tanimura and Miyazaki are working together for DS3, which should combine the new blood with the old."
Games,3dyslt,Cappop,5,Mon Jul 20 23:09:44 2015 UTC,Well said. Especially about the difficulty. They just made it harder for the sake of being hard. That doesn't usually work out well. Heide's Tower of Flame was worst for me with that. So many big enemies that i could never get to lure out 1v1. Was a real tough area.
Games,3dyslt,Qrusher14242,2,Tue Jul 21 09:47:39 2015 UTC,"I find it funny that people complain this game is too tough and that their friends ""bullied"" them to finish it. The game isn't about ""hey look how hard this game is"" it's about learning the controls and overcome the difficulty. If you are just gonna say it cheap and not fair and give up the meaning of the game is lost on you and it's not a game for you."

As for your final edit complaining that none of us are talking about Dark Soul 3? Why the fuck would we? Its not at all relevant to the original post, the video or even the topic except for the fact that it's an upcoming sequel.

Games,3dyslt,tashmar,10,Mon Jul 20 23:26:51 2015 UTC,"This pretty much hits the nail on the head in my opinion. I was super excited for Dark Souls 2, and then once I played it, I was severely let down. And then, after replaying 1 after I played 2, it just cemented my disdain for it. Dark Souls was carefully thought out and precise. Dark Souls 2 feels haphazardly linked together. He said it perfectly; it feels like it was made to emulate the 1st.  2 also handled difficulty in a really annoying way.  1: Let's put a bunch of enemies that have interesting movesets, and let's let the player fight them one at a time if they're careful, so they don't get overwhelmed. We'll punish the reckless player and reward the careful one.  2: NO IT'S OK LET'S THROW A BAJILLION ENEMIES AT THEM THAT ALL AGGRO AT THE SAME TIME AND LET'S GIVE THEM BULLSHIT HITBOXES YEAH EVERYONE WILL LOVE IT.

Games,3dyslt,zimbabwe_jim,3,Mon Jul 20 22:15:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, New Londo is a bit shit, but to my mind, that's the only example in 1 I can think of. The poise break on the ghost's attacks is crazy. That's why I prefer dodging to tanking hits. :P  I'm pretty sure every other area was manageable if you were smart about how you approach it."
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,2,Mon Jul 20 22:18:09 2015 UTC,"What do you mean by other way to approach it? Lure them out? You can do that in ds2 too if you know the positioning(maybe that's the difference). Other than that: right in the beginning, the skeletons and dogs like to run at you, the  bushes in the garden are seldom alone, the mobs in blighttown spawn in numbers so do the stupid flies in the area beneath. Bosses tend to not be alone either. I haven't played beyond sens fortress yet because somehow I keep falling through the ground on my savegame so I can't give examples from later on the game"
Games,3dyslt,mtocrat,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:25:42 2015 UTC,"The skeletons are there to dissuade you from exploring in that direction til you have better gear and can decimate them.  The dogs (save for Capra) come at you one at a time, I think maybe there's one case where there are two, but that's not, like, a ton.  The bush people can be aggro'd separately if you take your time, iirc. That, and they're pansies to begin with.  Which boss have you fought that wasn't alone besides Capra? There's only one late game boss that has a ton of little helpers, but he attacks his own guys, so he kinda takes care of them for you. Capra is a unique boss, and his adds aren't other bosses. They're just weak smaller enemies."
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,-6,Mon Jul 20 20:31:23 2015 UTC,"The skeletons are there to dissuade you from exploring in that direction til you have better gear and can decimate them.   Ah, but conversely, the Old Knights are there to dissuade you from going towards the Tower of Flame until you're prepared. So, in this case, DkS1 uses a mob as a warning, whereas DkS2 uses a single, large, powerful knight.  There are just as many occasions in  both games where you could handle a sole enemy, or a mob, or end up fighting multiple sole enemies because you've mishandled mob management. DkS1 focused on single bosses (except Capra, O&S, Four Kings, Pinwheel - think that's all). DkS2 had single bosses a-plenty (running through my memory, the first, second, third, fourth, fifth bosses were solo; Sentinel was the first group boss). There were also times where you'd have multiple bosses, or a boss and a mob - some fun, some irritating.   I dare say that the difference is DkS2 feels like it's more focused on summoning. There's a reason SotFS amps up the summons - I get the impression they wanted you to bring a buddy or two to handle a different situation."
Games,3dyslt,RemnantEvil,7,Mon Jul 20 20:21:05 2015 UTC,"Very good points. And I guess that's part of what bothers me. I like playing solo. I don't like needing to use the co-op. But when you've got all these bosses that aren't 1 on 1, summoning is almost necessary unless you can pull a flawless fight every time."
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,6,Mon Jul 20 20:37:51 2015 UTC,"Use arrows. If there's a bunch of enemies tightly packed and you can see them, only the one you hit will come at you for a fight. It's especially effective for the Capra Demons in the Demon Ruins."
Games,3dyslt,irespectfemales123,2,Tue Jul 21 00:56:59 2015 UTC,"There are tons of examples. Tomb of Giants giant dog skeletons, painted world of Ariamis pinwheel skeletons, New Anor Londo ghosts, the gank when you rescue the Firelink Shrine fire keeper, Smough and Ornstein, The bridge in Anor Londo with the archer BS, Neto, the beginning of the game with the fire bomb ass holes, Capra Demon, and probably more I am missing since the last time I played DS1 was a year ago. People complaining about being swarmed in DS2 have very selective memory. I love both games but lets be honest, DS1 had at least as many if not more instances of this."
Games,3dyslt,King_Kunta_69,4,Tue Jul 21 01:14:28 2015 UTC,"Nito's pretty easy. Use a holy weapon to bring down the initial skeletons and just stay away from the back of the arena. You still have tons of room in which to maneuver.  As for the Capra Demon, that boss tests your ability to pick apart foes one at a time. You're expected to move to the back stairs to kill the dogs before handling the demon itself.  Similarly, Ornstein & Smough are built around co-op. While you can summon Solaire, the battle is made far more interesting when you summon an ally to beat them at their own game.  As for the Anor Londo archers, I've got nothing. Everyone hates those bastards."
Games,3dyslt,ChronicRedhead,-1,Tue Jul 21 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"I don't think the issue is so much that there's these solutions, its so much that a new player to the series has absolutely no idea that going into the Nito boss fight (also making you lose half HP on the drop is stupid) that there were no necromancers to kill or the giant skeletons in the back. The place is dark as shit even with the maggot.  It may seem simple looking back, but I didn't know that I could cheese the boss by staying in the same place I fell."
Games,3dyslt,Johnbot300,6,Mon Jul 20 21:24:45 2015 UTC,"The Souls series isn't about getting through your first try. It's about experimenting and adapting to new strategies. It is definitely unfair at times (Bed of Chaos comes to mind), but boss encounters for the most part are built to be encounters you can succeed at through persistence.  Also, I'm curious as to what kind of build you were running that had you lose half your health in that fall. I mean no ill will; it's just I never had problem. Not to mention you've got plenty of time to heal up once you fall if damage is substantial."
Games,3dyslt,ChronicRedhead,4,Mon Jul 20 21:50:46 2015 UTC,"Besides the example of the pinwheel skeletons and ghosts, all of those are 3 or less, and whenever you encounter them, you have the room to maneuver/never even have to deal with them. And most of those you can aggro one at a time if you want to."
Games,3dyslt,MyOnlyAlias,5,Tue Jul 21 04:39:08 2015 UTC,"Something the first game did better is allowing you to peel enemies from large groups. It's possible to just get into range/agro of one of the enemies, drag them out to a safer place, then fight them there. Then you can repeat this with the others, or just fight the smaller group.  Give it a try. It's pretty much the only way I made it through some spots in the game. This is pretty much not present in DaS2. Almost every enemy that appears to be part of a group will cause the entire group to be agro if you get their attention."
Games,3dyslt,LotusFlare,3,Tue Jul 21 05:17:57 2015 UTC,"I don't see how the tedium of 1 is preferable to the way 2 works? Is it just a function of people being bad at the game and not being able to handle multiple enemies? I got caught out a few times by mobs, but if you're paying attention to your surroundings and using the environment to your advantage it's waaaay more interesting than the broken leashing tactics of dark souls."
Games,3dyslt,Itsweird,2,Mon Jul 20 21:44:28 2015 UTC,"It's a matter of people finding fighting groups of enemies to be more tedious than fighting a single one. Single enemies can feel very different to fight. Groups of enemies all feel the same.   Once there's more than two enemies to fight at once, the type of enemy really doesn't matter because they're now capable of covering each other's weaknesses. You have to do one of two things, and neither of them are interesting or fun. Either circle around them to try and herd them up. Then try to bait them all into attacking at the same time and deal like one strike of damage while they're recovering. Or, pull them all together down some long hallway, try to bait them into attacking at the same time, and then hit them once while they're recovering."
Games,3dyslt,LotusFlare,0,Mon Jul 20 22:35:26 2015 UTC,"Ehh, this guy also played the game Vanilla.  Get the Gedasoto Mod with the right brightness settings and the game is an utterly unique gameplay experience, requiring the torch and really breathing life into this little dungeon crawling genre.  I imported Demon's, bought it again when it released stateside, bought Dark Souls day one, waited some time for do Dark Souls 2 and recently just played Bloodborne..  I can agree Dark Souls 2 has some issues when it comes to pacing but if you want it to be a unique gameplay experience, you gotta try it again with the Gedasoto mod.. and to add to that, I just dont feel like the game is 'bad' or deserves 'disdain'... It was following in the footsteps of Giants and didnt have the original creator helming it.  Its a damn fine product, probably the weakest of the Soul series but that isnt something to be ashamed of.. Its up there with some of the best games of all time.  If you want some quality Souls though - get Bloodborne.  Im about 20 hours into that and there are some nice tweaks to the formula and the setting is just breathtaking.  EDIT: I know its not fair to rate the game based on a mod, but, really, it makes Dark Souls 2 into a really unique experience with the torch if you mod it right.  Check this video out and try it again like this.. its so cool to have the torch work the way it did in the demos  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Mv5fUWOxrU"
Games,3dyslt,RockBandDood,3,Tue Jul 21 14:08:48 2015 UTC,I don't think a game should need mods to be good. You should judge the quality of a game on its vanilla state. Any game can become great with mods.

Games,3dyslt,RockBandDood,2,Mon Jul 20 19:01:17 2015 UTC,"When I say mechanically broken, I mean like, its core. I'm talking about Shrine of Amana. These bullshit sorceresses that have infinite aggro range firing shit at you as you try to progress. I'm talking about the parts where you take one step forward and three guys come at you all at once. Dark Souls 1 always had a way out. If you took the time to look around and assess the situation, you could always figure a way out that didn't rely on brute force. If you were smart, you could aggro enemies and get them by themselves and take them out in a much more calculated way, rather than dealing with guys that stagger their attacks so you have no room to do anything. More than once in Dark Souls 2, you'd get insta aggro'd by everything in the area which made the difficulty come from quantity, not quality.   Plus, the bosses were just plain boring. 1 had so many more memorable bosses. Biggie and Smalls, The Belfry Gargoyles (recycled in 2. They just added a fuck ton of them), Gaping Dragon, Nito, hell, even Centipede Demon was cool. 2 had more giant guys in armor and a sword than anything else. Pursuer, Lost Sinner, Mirror Knight, Velstadt, Vendrick (no armor, but you know what I mean), Sir Alonne, Fume Knight, Burnt Ivory King, Dragon Rider (which was technically two bosses because they used him twice. Which is another problem. Yeah 1 had the Asylum Demon variants, but they all felt like different fights. They had different venues, damage outputs, and new moves. Again quality vs. 2's quantity. There were literally two of the same boss.), and the Throne Defender and Watcher. Another example of quantity over quality. And they did that in the DLC too. The bullshit (3) explorers in the 1st DLC that read your inputs and would react faster than any player ever could, the tigers in the 3rd DLC too. There was the one that was invisible at first which was interesting. Then you traverse that snow area and what do you find? A copy pasta of two more tigers. And then in the 2nd DLC, you find literally a palette swap of Smelter. Like, I get that 1 did that too, but the fact that this was part of a DLC (and you paid extra for it) made it sting more. 1's DLC was awesome. Sanctuary Guardian (completely original), Artorias (hyped up through the main game and another really unique fight. One of my favorites.), Kalameet (Another really cool fight. Unique and memorable), and then freaking Manus (I mean come on, it's Manus).  Sorry for the wall of text. I just feel pretty strongly about this. I've played both games multiple times and feel like I've formed pretty evidence based opinions."

Games,3e0gvl,Leknasant,341,Tue Jul 21 00:30:13 2015 UTC,"You see, I've never really liked all this dramatic talk about ""dreams,"" and how Chris and CIG bill themselves as our knight in shining armor to save us from mediocre publisher AAA games in response to the skepticism regarding feature creep, lack of progress, p2w, or whatever. It has always felt like a standard PR cop-out with a weird cultish flavor to it.  Here's the thing. I pledged at the very beginning of the project under the premise that it'd turn out to be a fairly ambitious space sim, that also has complementary components of FPS, with a Wing Commander-esque campaign and a persistent multiplayer component. That's all fine and good, and I'm totally alright with them expanding the scale and depth of those core components in proportion with their funding.   That said, CIG makes themselves an easy target for skepticism in a number of ways.   ""Feature creep"" is an issue, an excellent example of this is with the recent sale of a transport ship, and the ridiculously convoluted gameplay based around sims-esque mini-games. Another poster on r/starcitizen pretty much summed this feature up.  Or the stretch goal for a fucking pet system. Personally, having backed for the glorious revival of the space sim genre, Diner Dash in space and a pet system that will likely be just as convoluted, are features that I could totally do without. I would rather have those resources go to other parts of the game. And with all these extraneous, and frankly not relevant to a space sim features, it often feels like CIG has completely lost focus. And that feeling of a lack of focus on the core space sim isn't helped much when Chris Roberts has started primarily referring to the game as ""not really a space sim,"" instead coining the wonderfully Molyneux-esque term of it being more of a ""First Person Universe,"" whatever that means. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to see the addition of a fully fledged dating sim. Their business model also comes across as kind of scummy, to be honest. Ignoring the fact that they have sold ships that you cannot lose for use in the PU for insane amounts of money, such as a massive capital ship for $2500,, the concept of buying ships has been most obnoxiously present in the early alpha testing. Meaning, Arena Commander, for the first 9 months of its release was by definition ""pay to win."" Everything from guns, ships, shields or whatever else was available, had to be bought with real money. So if you had a starter ship like the poorly armed and armored Aurora for the price of a standard game, you would have to pay out the ass. Wanted weapons that didn't suck? Buy the Omniskies for $18, multiplied by however many you need. Wanted a ship that didn't suck? Buy the Hornet for $125. What a bargain. It was atrocious for testing, most people didn't play, the only ones playing were those with the top tier, and coincidentally most expensive ships. And CIG's excuse was, to paraphrase, ""if we let everybody fly everything without paying, everybody would only use the best ships,""  which happened anyway. But they fixed that, right? Well, not entirely. They introduced REC, a rental system straight out of any freemium game. Now instead of paying for access, you can rent ships and guns that expire and must be renewed every 7 days with REC, a currency which you must grind for by playing games. For single decent ship with a decent loadout, you can expect to grind REC for about 8-12 hours a week, which may not sound like much, but believe me, it can be painful. So this is of course pursuing the method of ""pay2notgrind,"" which, to be honest is a model that I'm not so pleased about being in a game that I've spent enough on already (lets just say it's >$100), and is especially stupid for an alpha since it actively discourages people from testing or experimenting with anything. They also still lock content behind a paywall. In the newest update, they released the Scythe. Exciting, right? Well, maybe if you're one of the 300-400 people that bought one for hundreds of dollars way back when. If not, you can pay a monthly subscription of $20 for the privilege of being a ""test pilot"" for a whopping 24 hours. But otherwise, this ship will be completely unavailable to 99% of backers for the next few years until the PU releases, and it will receive much less feedback than anything else.   Combined with frequent concept sales for expensive ships that rake in millions after millions, the lack of delivery of content, and a whole bunch of other stuff that looks sketchy, the atmosphere of doubt surrounding the game is in my opinion perfectly valid, even though I remain somewhat hopeful. All in all, I'm still excited for a lot of things about the game, but CIG hasn't done itself any favors. I'm fine with delays and everything, especially for such an ambitious project, but in the context of everything else it does raise an eyebrow. And frankly, despite still being somewhat excited, I'm burnt out. Following this game has been exhausting, whether it's dealing with the constant delays for everything, the constant multi-hundred/thousand dollar ship sales, the constant questionable design/business decisions, or the cultish fanatical fanbase, it's all just exhausting. And cheap, overly grandiose and hyped up rhetoric from the devs like in the OP is just another thing that I've heard enough of. I would really rather hear sound logic or ""real talk"" like Travis Day, a producer who recently left for Blizzard, used to give."
Games,3e0gvl,A_Beatle,24,Tue Jul 21 05:08:05 2015 UTC,Haven't they said multiple times that all ships will be fully earnable in game with no real money required? At least that's what people over a /r/starcitizen have told me

So it wouldn't matter if I waited until release, would it? Because if I wait until release to play it, other players will still have in-game items that would take me hours if not days or weeks of gameplay to unlock?  And, are we assuming they stop selling ships post-release? I doubt that will happen, they will probably continue the model by releasing even more ships and weapons.  I think it's a joke personally, and I'm actually pretty welcoming of alternate funding models. This one just feels wrong to me."
Games,3e0gvl,hessian_tank,7,Tue Jul 21 13:57:58 2015 UTC,"I've heard that the prices of the ships during the alpha are over inflated.  You're pledging your money and you're getting a gift in return.   For example, if a ship costs $100 right now, it might only be worth $20 when the game is released.  Not that you'll still be able to buy the ship at release but that's what its' value will be."
Games,3e0gvl,Moleculor,3,Tue Jul 21 16:47:38 2015 UTC,"Unless I've completely misunderstood the model, do you not get the ships you have paid for in the final game?   Clarification: You're not paying for ships. You're backing the game and they're telling you you'll get a ship in the full game when it launches. It's a minor quibble, but it's an important one.   But yes, you'll have access to ships early on that others might not have access to in the persistent universe.   Whether or not you can use those ships (the bigger ones require two, five, ten, or more extra crew to run properly), have the fuel to keep them flying, etc, is another matter entirely. (And there's some possibility that playing the single-player campaign might earn you some extra bonuses beyond the already stated bonus of citizenship.)   And, are we assuming they stop selling ships post-release? I doubt that will happen   They have stated many many many many many many many times that people will not be able to buy in-game ships with real-world currency once the game launches.   Many. So, so many.  I'm pretty damn sure that CIG and Star Citizen would be a giant flaming inferno of doom if they went back on that promise. I'd be throwing my torch on to the pile if that happened.   There will be a (small) way of exchanging real-world money for in-game currency, but they seem to be planning on limitations for that. No more than a certain amount per week or month, and once you have X amount of currency in game, you can't do it at all. The intention seems to be 'If you want an extra boost at the start you can buy one, but once you're successful, that's it. It all rides on gameplay.'"

This is just mental gymnastics to try and justify the cost of these things by saying, ""I'm just backing the game and the ship is a bonus!""

I've stopped following every update and checking the subreddit weekly, except for whatever headline slips into r/games.  Your comment really emphasizes my biggest fear with ""feature creep"", which is that it takes focus away from the core game, and the core gameplay elements of flying spaceships in space. I remain forever hopeful, since I too have invested my money in this game, and I know that many of the different elements of Star Citizen are being developed by separate studios, but I still feel like the game is so unbelievably out of reach. It seems like CIG are trying to do everything at once, spreading themselves incredibly thin, and not developing the game step by step. They seem unfocused and it makes progress appear so slow. I really want this game to be amazing, and I have a lot of hope still, but as you said, CIG have been making some strange decisions about the game."

Games,3e0gvl,Serakh_Tsekani,1 point,Tue Jul 21 11:52:57 2015 UTC,"My impression is that balance in Star Citizen isn't going to be what a lot of people are expecting. Think less rock/paper/scissors and more supply/demand. There are going to be options that clearly outperform their counterparts, but you're going to have a harder time finding them and/or they will be more expensive.  I feel that the approach of extrapolating real life into a space sim is going to leave a lot of people disappointed. Ask anyone who's played EVE Online, most of the time spent playing the game is downtime and doing chores to enable you to reach the fun content. I quit EVE because I already have a job and didn't feel like having another one. Some people are into that kind of game, but I'd wager that the majority of people out there don't have a ton of free time and just want to be able to sit down with a game that can easily deliver the fun.   As for feature creep, continuing down this path is only going to raise expectations to even more unreasonable levels. RSI has positioned themselves in a weird area where people now expect so much from the game, it will be impossible to deliver. Even if they buckle down and focus on the core experience and tighten it to mechanical perfection, they're still going to find themselves in the Destiny boat where people say it's a mechanically tight game, but that it didn't meet expectations and will look bad in comparison to the grand visions we were given."

Games,3e0gvl,RexFury,3,Tue Jul 21 14:05:22 2015 UTC,Starpoint Gemini?  Not a great example of 'space sim'.
Games,3e0gvl,ArchmageXin,4,Tue Jul 21 14:44:46 2015 UTC,"Well depend on what you look for (I assume we are talking about SG2). It got a map, you can buy ships, upgrade them, and take on various mission types (Escort, assault, capture) etc, keep building your ship, keep trading, smuggling etc.  You could debate if it is a good or bad game, but that ""style"" is pretty much standard sci-fi space sim. I would like it for the first 10 hours then fall asleep. Robert's SC worry me to the same degree."
Games,3e0gvl,jward,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:48:14 2015 UTC,Other MMO's don't compare to EvE for feeling like a job.  I've never had another MMO where I felt like I needed multiple accounts.  Nor have I had another MMO where I was expected to log in and play at 3am at night for several hours.  EvE is an amazing game that can suck you in deeper and further down the rabbit hole than anything else out there.

Yes, I still want Star Citizen to succeed and be a good game, why wouldn't I ? It would be good for everyone if it was a decent product, but I started feeling funny from the start they did that whole PC master race talk and advertising where they kept saying how console couldn't never run star citizen. It baffled me how people didn't see how this was blatantly an attempt at getting initial adoration from the PC community and fanatics and not an attempt as spewing fact (hey, I have a 1000$ PC and Im not a fan of consoles).   I respect CIG's goal which is Star citizen, but my god have they just been so pretentious and arrogant about it, I'm seriously not surprised if Chris Roberts actually viewed himself as some god figure in the games industry at this point, and their later ideas have been really weird (the passenger system as mentioned )"

If it is a con or going to be a flop, well then they did it in an Ocean's 11 fashion and made a crap ton of money. They are either liars, completely crazy fools, or they are actually building a great space sim.   But I don't see how they can develop a decent (successful) product, in a half-assed way?

Best part,  time limited/limited ""run""  ships to increase the hype and pray on the poor bastard who's already addicted.    If they wanted more founding they'd do it like Kickstart er,  or just let people donate.  Not sell ships and new ships and more time limited extra exclusive ships.  Real rewards for real additions to the game (aka nor fake languages or pets,  more space combat or a true prototype).  This game is p2w before it's even launched thanks to these ships,  and balancing them will be a nightmare (forget it), only way to keep people paying is making the grind Jornal and p2w the only way.  Then again,  why even release the game since fools spends hundreds of dollars on nothing,  even an OYUA has more value today then the best ship in SC.   But hey,  send me a Pc when you can play SC with full and functional (and we'll designed/lenghty)  Single player as well as a good multi-player,  balanced and not p2w/buy ships or gtfo.

I would have bought into it a long time ago if not for that.

Games,3e0gvl,Non-negotiable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:43:48 2015 UTC,"""Feature creep"" is an issue, an excellent example of this is with the recent sale of a transport ship, and the ridiculously convoluted gameplay based around sims-esque mini-games. Another poster on r/starcitizen pretty much summed this feature up. Or the stretch goal for a fucking pet system. Personally, having backed for the glorious revival of the space sim genre, Diner Dash in space and a pet system that will likely be just as convoluted, are features that I could totally do without. I would rather have those resources go to other parts of the game. And with all these extraneous, and frankly not relevant to a space sim features, it often feels like CIG has completely lost focus. And that feeling of a lack of focus on the core space sim isn't helped much when Chris Roberts has started primarily referring to the game as ""not really a space sim,"" instead coining the wonderfully Molyneux-esque term of it being more of a ""First Person Universe,"" whatever that means. At this point, I wouldn't be surprised to see the addition of a fully fledged dating sim   To this I say; none of the extraneous stuff has any impact on Squadron 42, the single player space-sim that is said to be like a modern day Wing Commander but vastly improved. You aren't going to be carting people around the universe on a passenger ship, you are in the UEE military. That's why it can be released as a full game before the PU will even be in alpha. They don't need a working economy, don't need to have all of the careers up and running, don't need a background server running the universe, it doesn't even need the netcode that they are fighting with since its playable offline. It doesn't suffer from any feature creep, IMO, and is probably what a lot of people with concerns about the PU are looking for."
Games,3e0gvl,Moleculor,34,Tue Jul 21 13:19:22 2015 UTC,"To this I say; none of the extraneous stuff has any impact on Squadron 42   I actually wouldn't be surprised if this wasn't true, but only in a good way. I could see ""idiots touring hostile space"" as a potential mission where you have to go save said idiots.   Squadron 42 works better with a more fully fleshed out world."
Games,3e0gvl,Non-negotiable,41,Tue Jul 21 13:37:45 2015 UTC,"That doesn't have to involve any of the silly stuff that players would have to do when transporting people around though, which is my point. An NPC carting around a bunch of people isn't going to be the same as players carting around a bunch of people; they don't need to make it interesting/enjoyable/fun for a player. They just need it to happen.   Same with the rest of the careers. Exploration will probably be a part of the campaign but mining, cargo running and things that one wouldn't expect to find in a game in which you are in the military don't need to be functioning for players for SQ42 to release.   It doesn't even need the netcode anymore at launch, as the co-op is going to be a separate series of historical missions instead of being a part of the main campaign."
Games,3e0gvl,Vocith,5,Tue Jul 21 16:12:13 2015 UTC,If you follow the Development closely you notice a pattern.  The SQ42 studio in London is busy building a game while the studios in Austin and Santa Monica are busy designing THE SIMS - IN SPACE.
Games,3e0gvl,Non-negotiable,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:32:09 2015 UTC,"Santa Monica is mostly working on Arena Commander and ships, Austin on the PU (social module right now) which includes all of the careers, UK on SQ42 (while also contributing to everything because they are the fucking bomb) and Frankfurt on engine changes (which effect everything). Plus their contracted studios (Wyrmbyte, Moon Collider, Illfonic, Behaviour, Turbulent). Obviously there's some overlap (i.e. there's people from each studio working on FPS right now, as that's a necessary part of the entire game).   The only one really making what some would call Simish gameplay is Austin. Austin is also working on careers though, such as exploration, SAR, bounty hunting, mercenary work, etc. All studios are working on making the game, or their monthly reports would be a lot shorter."

Every point you made has been addressed by the developers in detail and you are just refusing to listen to them at this point. Forget about the whole thing and come back in two years.  I am a backer from 2012 as well and I feel I've already got my moneys worth (A whopping $35) just watching and interacting with the bucketloads of content about development and lore they've already produced. The actual game (when it arrives sometime in the next decade, pah) will be a bonus.  I don't feel obligated in any way to give them more money, and I think those that do are just a tad crazy, but of course I'm glad they did. I am not glad however when I see those that have invested alot lose their mind over small things because they feel entitled to everything, right now.

Once the game comes out really money CANNOT be used to purchase ships. The reason you can purchase ships now is A) because they need a way to fund the development and server costs and B) so that when the game comes out not everyone starts with an aurora, which sure you are thinking makes the game unbalanced.

Games,3e0gvl,greenlittleapple,2,Tue Jul 21 18:58:45 2015 UTC,"[I posted this in another thread]  I think what /r/Games and the Reddit community should notice is that Star Citizen is probably the most transparent and open game in the game industry. They put out monthly, weekly, and even daily updates for the game and its progress that reveal the bugs, development, and inside details of the team such as meeting devs and weekly summaries.  Many people say that ""Star Citizen is never going to come out, it's already been 3 years!"". What they don't realize is that, compared to other titles, they're not even close to being overdue. Others seem to think that delays are unique to only Star Citizen. They don't know that the game industry is full of delays but games don't usually announce them, as many AAA titles don't show their development progress to the whole world, while Star Citizen does.  I'm tired of all the false lies and misinformation about the game and I wanted to help clarify some info. Thanks for reading!"
Games,3e0gvl,ultramarine8,3,Tue Jul 21 00:41:00 2015 UTC,"Star Citizen isn't amy more open or transparent than they would need to if they were otherwise funded by the public, either.  Stuff like that is still evading the hard question you would get, for example, at a shareholder meeting.  So how much of those $80 million investment money is still left, what are their running expenses and how long can they continue development at their current cashflow without needing more investement capital to bridge the gap to release?"
Games,3e0gvl,strangea,2,Tue Jul 21 06:33:37 2015 UTC,This right here is a good question. Can they put off release until 20XX and still actually have money to pay the people making it?

That's a teeny tiny number if we're looking at the numbers of each concept/shipsale. There are people who buy 10 of those 100 dollar ship for themselves and distribute them in their organization. Each and every sale seems to net them 500k to 2 million every time they do one. They released around 200* limited huge hulls of Javelin (relatively big ships and hulls, not full ships) with a pricetag of around 2500 dollars. They sold out within a day I think."

They can keep that going for 6 years right now and still have 10 mil left over for offices and such.  That is pre-release money, you would expect at minimum 2-3x time post-launch. So conservatively another 200 million over the next 5 years, that is more than enough to support what they want to do.  Also consider, in these coming months, the CIG team will be as big as it will ever get, over the next 3-4 years they will dwindle the number of active devs down to 100-150 (to work on the game when it is actually launched).

The only of those that may have done something remotely close is GW2, TOR, and ESO and all of those were the ""pre-order a few months out and get beta access"" variety.  It isn't so much the delays, it is that they are missing deadlines and STILL accepting money.  Think about it this way: You have a friend who is going to build a taller fence so that you can do nude sunbathing in your backyard and get a proper wang tan. But they keep putting it off and delaying it for whatever reason.  If they haven't taken any money, you are gonna be a lot more accepting of it.

The space combat/exploration/Elite Clone has already been done and has been since 1984.

After it became clear that Sony wasn't going anywhere EA backtracked and said they were working on some exclusive Playstation promo's with Sony.

Not to mention this partnership will involve money being handed over by MS i imagine. They have gained more than lost.  It was Sony who lost here, dont try to spin this the other way.

How much of that was EA and how much was just those studios/games being one hit wonders (or just gaming itself moving forward) is up for debate, but it is easier to blame EA for a sequel of a game we love not being great than it is to argue the devs themselves fucked up/the idea wasn't as long-lasting as we thought it was.  Working conditions aside (although, they have gotten better), for consumers EA has been a great (video game) company pretty much since the early 00s. But we still hate them because they are EA"

Games,3dzlre,taytothief,7,Mon Jul 20 21:56:36 2015 UTC,"The planet where they consistently release great franchise games (BF4 had a rough launch but was good for most folk within a month. Hardline is arguable though), explore new and interesting IPs (Dead Space, Mirror's Edge, and Bulletstorm come to mind), own Bioware (DA2 was  good for the first two acts and TOR was a pretty decent SP rpg... with a monthly fee. But DA:I is the best MMO for cheap loners ever made), and regularly release REALLY good and solid games (see everything /u/Killerx09 listed)  They basically ARE doing everything we as gamers want, but stuff like Madden and past bad-touchings tend to make us ignore the good in favor of the bad. Which sucks because eventually there will be no point in doing the good."
Games,3dzlre,Gundato,-3,Mon Jul 20 22:33:07 2015 UTC,"DA:I was critically acclaimed, while PvZ and TF were very solid games which received good reviews. Mobile games are just following the mobile trend for their audience, while BFH is a mediocre game. Still don't see anything controversal."

As bad of a rep as they get it's an amazing service for the consumer.  $30 a year to get games about 6-10 months after their release and a chance to preview brand new games?  I'm kind of surprised they're still doing it.  If this game sucks and has too many bugs I'll know to stay away after 10 hours of gameplay.  It made staying away from their last release Rory Macelroy PGA Tour an easy choice.

Games,3dzlre,punktual,-22,Tue Jul 21 16:32:17 2015 UTC,"They're not charging money to find out if the game is worth the money, it's more of an added benefit of being a subscriber, and maybe it'll draw more subscribers so they can also play the games they have in vault like the current subscribers do. If you're subscribing to see if you should buy the game or not you're shouldn't be subscribed. It's for people who enjoy the games already offered."
Games,3dzlre,Etsat,2,Tue Jul 21 05:25:36 2015 UTC,"I actually like most of their games and really enjoy the nearly access.  It's nice to use on games I'm on the fence about, games I don't need to get right after release, and trade in games I already once they're in the vault."

Typically these are sports games, but EA is adding more to the list. Titanfall was recently added, and Dragon Age:Inquisition is coming soon. Right now there's sports games and Battlefield 4 as well as Plants vs Zombies (I think). You're really paying for access to all those games."

EA access members get to play EA games for a short time (usually about 10 hours) about a week before release. It just so happens that the only platform that EA access is available on is Xbox.

Games,3dzlre,KingMoonfish,1 point,Tue Jul 21 09:58:54 2015 UTC,"Not a beta though, it's the full release or a limited subset of it, for example the early access to Battlefield Hardline locked you to the first mission or two of the campaign but had the full multiplayer suite available."

Everyone remembers it for the fantastic webslinging physics, but it also had a living city with pedestrians and traffic and a day/night cycle. Random events like high-speed pursuits happened in the populated open world, speeding past bystanders and swerving around other cars as you tried to catch them. It wasn't quite GTA scale simulation, but when a crime occurred and you arrived to stop it, you were saving grateful innocents and restoring the status quo of law and order. And that's definitely a different feel from the Arkham games' world of thugs."
Games,3dz8wy,Cognimancer,-8,Mon Jul 20 20:27:01 2015 UTC,"What you're talking about is probably better explained by showing the complete difference in tone between both Marvel and DC.

Games,3dz8wy,AWorldW-OShrimp,3,Tue Jul 21 02:30:40 2015 UTC,"I'm betting it's more because of the movies and (more recently) the TV shows. Marvel's MCU movies have always been pretty lighthearted and funny, occasionally to the films' detriment (Age of Ultron in particular, arguably the first Captain America as well). By comparison, all of DC's recent ventures are pretty dark, grimy and realistic - obviously it started with the Dark Knight trilogy, but it also includes Man of Steel and Arrow. DC is aiming for more gritty realism in its adaptations while Marvel is taking a more comedic approach to their films. I'm betting most people have seen the movies but not read the comics, so the general impression people might get is that DC is dark and gritty while Marvel is lighthearted and silly."

Injustice seems to be very popular with exactly the kind of Superman hater who can't be bothered to read any of his actual comics and just wants to read the occasional screencap off Reddit. I love Injustice, it's a hilarious ride, but you can't seriously offer it up as a primary example of Superman as a character, even right now, when Action Comics, Superman/Wonder Woman, Superman, Justice League, and JLA all feature the same old boy scout Superman we all know and love.   That's to say nothing of the fact that Injustice itself is pretty hilarious and strives for a great deal of comedy mixed in with the bleakness.

I will grant you that in cinema DC has leaned towards a darker tone, but to claim that marvel (regardless of media) has ""always been the light hearted take on the super hero genre"", or that ""DC is best described as #808080"" is patently false.  Just take a look at daredevil. It can go from something like this, under bendis, to something like this, under waid.  Or just look at the netflix daredevil series, I would hardly call that lighthearted.   DC has similar ranges across story and medium."

This claim is patently absurd, of course. Both major publishers put out plenty of lighter and plenty of more serious fare.   For example, in currently published titles alone I could easily name right off the top of my head Gotham Academy, Grayson, Starfire, Harley Quinn, Bizarro, Bat-Mite and Prez as lighter-hearted or outright goofy series being put out by DC, and I'm probably missing a few. That's to say nothing of the fact that a very wacky and decidedly not gritty take on Harley Quinn has caused a serious explosion in the character's standing with DC as of late."

Games,3dz8wy,AWorldW-OShrimp,12,Tue Jul 21 11:34:28 2015 UTC,"Good writeup.   I can't find it now, but I remember somebody from Rocksteady saying the streets of Gotham are empty because they didn't want Batman plowing through crowds of civilians in the Batmobile. They wanted you to feel powerful when driving the Batmobile so they didn't want to put any invisible barriers, or make you bounce off things like light poles and fences - this is also why a good bit of the environment is destructible when driving it. But obviously Batman doesn't kill, and especially not innocent bystanders. So they came up with this scenario where all of Gotham's civilians have evacuated or barricaded themselves in for the night, and that's why none of them are on the streets.  Personally I enjoyed the Batmobile, although I agree with most that it was probably overused as a gameplay mechanic. I enjoyed the boss fights of the three previous Arkham games, so to see them all replaced by Batmobile sections or Predator scenarios was disappointing, and the heavy integration of the car into puzzle scenarios started to become tedious and predictable less than halfway through the game. But those of you that hated the Batmobile, now you have another reason to: it's the reason the streets of Arkham Knight are devoid of anyone but thugs and militia.   Just as an aside, I don't know where Giant Bomb are based, but this bit right here:   And then the handle turns, and for a brief moment I can see Gotham alive. A city bus rumbles by in the rain. The ambient noise of the diner--spoons clinking in coffee cups, friends bickering--mixes with the low hum of the city. The lights of the signs across the way…   Sounds like this guy maybe should take a weekend off to New York City ;)"

Push in the right tongue and a door might lead you down a staircase into the wall climb. Here, you must choose your next path. You could race up to the observatory, spin the sundial and pass into the room of the golden idols. Once there, push down on their faces to release the doors, that may take you below or lead you into the Shrine of the Silver Monkey. Assemble the statue there and you may be headed for the torch room. If the elevator is up, you could jump into the elevator and descend into the mine-shaft. You might climb up the ladder or plough through the stone wall. Find the key and it may unlock the tomb of ancient kings, allowing you to climb into the spider's lair. If you escape, you may have a chance to sit upon the throne of the Pretender. If the correct door is unlocked, you'll be able to crawl into pit of despair and finally make you way through the cave of sighs, back to the temple gate. The choices are yours and yours alone.

Just because you enjoy the game more solo doesn't make you a majority.

In Japan, the geography of the region—the fact that it's a smaller, denser country—has made the local play really catch on. People, getting together physically and playing the game with a focus on one particular goal: helping each other out. In the West, it's a completely different environment. It's a lot harder for people to actually get together and play the game. With our focus on implementing really good, robust online play in this title, we're hoping that's going to help lower the barrier of entry for people... Whether you're in Japan or in the West, the fact of the matter is playing with other people is a ton of fun."

In every MH thread there's always people complaining about how the graphics are dated and the controls suck, but it's always by people who haven't logged very many hours into the game because they can't get past them.

Games,3dxx43,emailboxu,11,Mon Jul 20 17:15:03 2015 UTC,Stop being ridiculous. Because I don't think the graphics are top notch and I think the  controls are subpar somehow means I must not have played the game enough? Controls are graphics are the input and output. It is how you interact with the game and how the game gets delivered to you. It's a game built around gameplay and do you know how you engage in the gameplay? You use the controls. Do you know how you view the gameplay? You look at the screen and see the graphics. And guess what looking at someone else and them being some fuzzy little blob on the screen can detract from the game.   And I fail to see how making a PC or console version would somehow drop sales on the 3DS version.
Games,3dxx43,mynewaccount5,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"(Responded to the deleted comment below the next one in the series, so as to top it all off. To paraphrase ""fuck you for saying my opinions is bad for disliking controls and not spending enough time"". Which hey is valid)  It's literally not possible (or masochistic) to play at any length with no understanding of the controls. That's why the game is so polarizing: most people either love or hate it.  In any case, you are both mostly using each other as a sounding board.  You want multi platform releases with better fidelity, he expresses how a core understanding to the series takes commitment.  Plus you both completely missed the fact that there are in fact PC/console versions of the game that are Japan/China only and are arguably inferior regardless of the poly count being higher."
Games,3dxx43,Arterra,-13,Tue Jul 21 09:24:47 2015 UTC,"Complaining about the controls is the biggest flag to show that someone hasn't put in the time or effort to learn the game at all. It doesn't take very long to learn them, 1-2 hours at most to get used to them. Also the game is played on a 3DS, so the graphics being ""sharper"" or ""higher resolution"" is pretty much impossible.   Making a PC version means more resources dedicated to making a more demanding version of the same game, thus a lower quality game overall for both. (Edit: I'll also add that a PC is hardly portable and doesn't have easily accessible LAN options like the 3DS does, which is one of the major appeals of the game worldwide, but especially in Japan).  The fact that you refuse to answer how much you've actually played the game makes it pretty laughably obvious that you have either never played it, played the demo and thought ""this game is dumb"", or you bought it, played it for 10 minutes, hated the controls, and threw it out.  But keep downvoting me for actually having played the game despite my qualms about its graphics and controls and discovering its real appeal. You are exactly the audience that MH does NOT cater to, so obviously you hate the game."
Games,3dxx43,emailboxu,2,Mon Jul 20 17:32:32 2015 UTC,"I played pretty much every interation of the game, for hundreds of hours and the controls are not great (specially bad on handhelds).

Of course not, I still love the series and play the crap out of it. But if they were to improve on those factors it would be a better game, again, IMO."

Would be nice if we got the Ultimate versions as $30 DLC or something.  According to Wikipedia there has been one year where they didn't release a main series entry in Japan. That year (2010) they released Monster Hunter diaries, and Xbox got monster hunter frontier. So yeah, every year more monster hunter."

Games,3dxx43,Chrystolis,-3,Tue Jul 21 13:48:18 2015 UTC,"Oh boy this looks super dated. I mean I'm the first guy to say that gameplay matter more over graphics but holy crap. Vita still no Monster Hunter. :(   EDIT: Just noticed the framerate is chugging along in some spots, am I allowed to criticize or is anything Nintendo related just given a free pass?"
Games,3dxx43,brlito,11,Tue Jul 21 14:31:29 2015 UTC,"It definitely doesn't get a free pass, though with video footage of any 3DS game, I find it really hard to gauge the graphic fidelity of the game since what you're viewing is intended for display on a small screen, but is being viewed at a very large size.  Everything looks horridly jaggy, but once you're viewing it at its intended size, it usually looks fine, or even great.  I ran into this with Smash 3DS too, where I thought the game looked pretty meh graphically in videos pre-release, but once I fired it up, I was pretty surprised at how sharp it was.  For what it's worth, a lot of people were saying the same about MH4 prior to its release, though it ended up looking pretty great in my opinion.  MHX is built off the same engine as 4, so it's safe to assume it'll look just as good as, if not improved."

Games,3dxx43,Ryswick,-9,Mon Jul 20 17:36:56 2015 UTC,"The series' appeal lies in its gameplay and social aspect. I suggest you actually try the game with friends who play before judging it.  Not saying that it's visually wonderful and blah blah, but the focus of the game isn't on that."
Games,3dxx43,droonick,3,Mon Jul 20 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"I agree it's a social game, but I also think it's the most visually impressive 3DS game I've played."

I love my 3DS and I fuxking love Monster Hunter on the 3DS but it's a fact that the graphics are dated and look like potato shit because of the system. There's no excuse. Phones have better resolutions. Nintendo needs to update their crummy handheld to modern standards.  Edit: Stop downvoting the guy, it's a perfectly valid opinion. 3DS graphics suck and you know it."
Games,3dxx43,brlito,-2,Mon Jul 20 22:55:11 2015 UTC,"The games look way better on the actual system. I also disagree that it looks dated, the graphics and art direction are fantastic as usual. It's just the hardware, which for sure does not do the games justice (graphically) but do work for it's main selling point (portability). I'd buy a Vita for monster hunter though, also for the better controls.   I didn't see any frame rate issues. What you might be mistaking it for is the slow-down or pause effect the games use on heavy hits to emphasize the strength of impact, a fairly common technique in Japanese (and other) games. If it's anything like MH4U then frame rate dips will be practically non existent on the New 3DS"

Every level felt different, and I found myself playing it from beginning to end multiple times trying to inch out every last achievement.  And I'm someone that doesn't really give a shit about achievements, but I just felt compelled to get them all in HotS.  Story, to me, is just a nice distraction in video games.  If the core gameplay can keep my hooked from beginning to end like that then I think that's a damn good video game.  Not many AAA titles can do that to me these days."

Blizzard has a very long track record of having the best post-release support of any company out there.  Diablo 2's final patch came out nearly a decade after release, for example.  It's not like Blizzard is hurting for money, they are one of the most lucrative game developers around.  There's no reason or need for microtransactions and there's no reason to think Blizzard would abandon the game because they've never done anything like that."

Dota, CS:GO, and LoL all have very fair and reasonable microtransaction systems, and if people are spending money on the game, there's an incentive to develop it further."
Games,3dx8r0,Bluezephr,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:32:58 2015 UTC,"How could that sort of micro transaction system benefit SC2? The units are too small to see any real customization in my opinion. They are trying it in their heroes of the storm game, though I think the prices there are a bit off."
Games,3dx8r0,dispellado,0,Mon Jul 20 19:17:57 2015 UTC,"It absolutely could. Voice packs, announcers(like the adjutant), custom Huds/cursors, and cosmetic skins all would be great. They already have some custom skins that come with the pre-orders on the adept, Ultralisk, and Thor. There are a few bonus ones with their progression system that are the zealot, pylon, overlord, zergling, marine and supply depot. They could easily sell things like that and I would absolutely pay for them, as most of us probably would who play a lot of SC2. You could really make it cool and add a base menu where you could click on your buildings and units and swap the stuff. It would be great.  Edit: and give blizzard a reason to keep developing the game past launch!"
Games,3dx8r0,Bluezephr,0,Mon Jul 20 19:29:32 2015 UTC,Those are some good ideas. It would be nice to see Blizzard do something significant with their games post launch. Even people in WoW are feeling a bit jilted these days.

Games,3dx8r0,Tannon,13,Mon Jul 20 16:28:26 2015 UTC,"When playing RTS games, I feel same as you. I need time to think, coordinate my actions, etc. I usually don't like that 'ticking clock'. But as it goes for Starcraft, it makes me feel the importance of the task - there is no time to waste to save galaxy/whatever and it gives a big chunk of immersion. It has cons and pros but I think that ultimately, it is actually good mechanic."
Games,3dx8r0,Tanvage,20,Mon Jul 20 17:04:19 2015 UTC,"the problem with no time limit missions is that it is often trivial then; simply turtle and build max food army, then go around and stomp things. there are different ways to design missions that don't end up like this (dungeon crawl with limited units is my personal favorite), but without a time limit most missions become tedious in my opinion."
Games,3dx8r0,echelontee,7,Mon Jul 20 18:09:51 2015 UTC,"I do agree with everything you say, makes sense.  While I see the appeal for the majority you mention, that's not fun for some of us.

Games,3dx8r0,Tannon,5,Mon Jul 20 18:47:10 2015 UTC,"They do have some of those, they are relatively infrequent though. You're right though, it's not the majority, and it's definitely not wrong to have those feelings. I think at the time of earlier RTS games, they were marketing towards a different demographic. When we were younger, most of us loved the idea of seeing a giant army battle another one and could get caught up in the moment and use our imaginations. Now, they are marketing towards a much older audience, and more of us crave variation, and puzzle solving to keep us entertained like that.  Comparitively, starcraft is also a lot faster than other RTS's, even in brood war. Rush strategies and aggression were a huge part of what starcraft is known for on the internet. I think they catered to that a bit when designing SC2."

Games,3dx8r0,Tannon,2,Mon Jul 20 19:47:49 2015 UTC,"And it's better overall for teaching the player. People who win in starcraft don't turtle all day, they know the minimum units they need and just go for the attack quickly."
Games,3dx8r0,octnoir,5,Tue Jul 21 04:16:12 2015 UTC,I don't think I have been more pressured than in the one wings of liberty mission where you have to defeat some protoss while outrunning a wall of fiery death right behind you and you have to keep floating your bases.

Games,3dx8r0,Rolder,0,Mon Jul 20 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, nightmares for sure. I understand why Blizzard did it, but maybe remove the time constraints on easy difficulty? Too much to ask?"
Games,3dx8r0,Tannon,10,Mon Jul 20 20:15:52 2015 UTC,"I get the impression from people in this comment section that the ""gimmicks"" are what makes the campaign appealing to people but feel I'm in the minority. SC:BW campaign was gimmicky in an RTS sense. The varying AI in each mission was the gimmick were you could win by finding the back path around their base to the objective building or you could go total warfare knocking down their front door. Or the TvZ mission where there were 6 zerg hives to destroy; each zerg having its own gimmick to defeat....  I still like the oddball mission where you're crawling through an installation with a piecemeal squadron of marines but I still primarily play SC as an RTS game and hope they don't go too far down the RPG wagon to make the campagin offputting for someone who's put the competitive aspect in the past."
Games,3dx8r0,6890,4,Mon Jul 20 15:25:46 2015 UTC,"I especially love the squad type missions they were some of my favorites from Starcraft and red alert 1. In a game of disposable units, those missions are a nice change of pace making you care about your units."
Games,3dx8r0,havok13888,9,Mon Jul 20 15:59:56 2015 UTC,"I was so bad at Starcraft 1 I never tried the sequel, thinking the AI would stomp me even on Easy. Is it worth it now or waiting until all 3 games are on sale? Will I miss out on content?"
Games,3dx8r0,Wandering_Tale,45,Mon Jul 20 11:53:04 2015 UTC,"The campaign can be done at all level, even people with very little skill. The campaign is probably the highest quality campaign in all RTS in terms of design (though Warcraft III campaign and its expansion has better entertainment/storytelling value in my opinion)  The AI is not going to stomp you on easy. It is barely going to attack you at the 10th minute mark. It is actually quite hard to die on medium.  I won't lie, it's unlikely that the multiplayer part will appeal to you, but the $60 for the game and 2 expansions is definitely worth it, and it's unlikely that you will see then on sale before a full year"
Games,3dx8r0,fezvez,2,Mon Jul 20 12:18:54 2015 UTC,"Any time I've played on easy, the computer just keeps sending random troops my way. Because I play defensively, they just keep doing it until they run out of resources."
Games,3dx8r0,Suddenly_Something,2,Mon Jul 20 12:43:19 2015 UTC,"You know you're allowed to attack, right? :)  I always find it fascinating seeing people play from a perspective other than optimization, where people don't do the best possible things all the time, and just want to enjoy.... the process of building stuff. I don't get it, but it's interesting nonetheless."
Games,3dx8r0,Poonchow,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:43:51 2015 UTC,For some reason I love trying to build impenetrable defenses. Only when playing against computers though.
Games,3dx8r0,Suddenly_Something,1 point,Mon Jul 20 22:59:15 2015 UTC,"I love that too. It's like a tower defense game, except with actual strategy.  Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance had the best ""defend until the timer goes out"" missions, I felt. That game was truly massive and epic, and some of the attacks that the computer mounts on you (even in Medium) were absurd. I fondly remember a mission where I built up a massive wall of cannons, artillery, aa-guns and energy shields. They held the attacks well, until the enemy deployed a massive airship (think Independence Day ship). I managed to shoot it down, but it crashed on my front line and promptly destroyed everything.  Wasn't even mad."

Games,3dx8r0,belgarionx,9,Mon Jul 20 13:50:23 2015 UTC,Blizzard rarely discounts a title until at least 6 months have passed since release.
Games,3dx8r0,Labfiend,6,Mon Jul 20 14:15:13 2015 UTC,The new expansion probably won't be out by then. The base game and first expansion will certainly be on sale then.
Games,3dx8r0,pnt510,4,Mon Jul 20 14:27:10 2015 UTC,"There was a 50% off sale on WoL and HotS a month or two ago, putting them at $10 each. I'd be stunned if they got any cheaper than that.  Even if they do, Legacy won't go below $40, and the SC2 Complete package is already $60, so you pay the same if you end up getting Legacy regardless."
Games,3dx8r0,Mitosis,-7,Mon Jul 20 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"No, it is not. Most missions in WoL are rush missions, you cannot even enjoy your typical RTS scheme with slowly build up, arms up and crush.  Another problems was that persistent upgrades force you to play in very specific way for whole campaign."
Games,3dx8r0,Smash83,5,Mon Jul 20 13:38:25 2015 UTC,"Those don't seem like problems, in my opinion.  In a form of a 'campaign', the idea of having to live with what you originally chose works, compared to just swapping out to the most optimal upgrade setup for the current mission.  As for the WoL missions you talk about, if you wanted to enjoy your typical RTS scheme of slowly building up your base, why not just play bot matches? Campaign missions should be where they throw you into atypical situations, compared to what you'd just get playing a bot match."
Games,3dx8r0,BCuddigan,-6,Mon Jul 20 14:38:40 2015 UTC,"I'm of the mindset that any game riding on its multiplayer should be using the campaign setting to teach you to play it.  How I've interpreted difficulties has been: Easy = Content Tourism, Medium = The base game and its basic mechanics, Hard = The base game with enhanced mechanics, Harder than Hard = The game played to be optimized against.

Games,3dx8r0,Spankyjnco,2,Mon Jul 20 15:26:38 2015 UTC,"I'd wait for a sale. I was one of the comp stomper BGH map players in SC1, never did much beyond mass hydralisks or battlecruisers, and I couldn't finish the WoL campaign. Some of the bonus objectives are extremely difficult and you miss out on content if you don't complete them.  For the curious, the mission that I couldn't finish was ""In Utter Darkness"". I'm sure if I went back I could beat it now, but at the time it was far too difficult. Many of the other campaign missions followed the same formula of ""gimmick"" missions that really screw with casual players and mean you have to restart several times until you find a strategy that works even on Easy."

If you just want to do the single player and an occasional bot match, you may want to wait until there's a sale. If all you care about are some occasional bot matches, then all you need is the third. The AI in bot matches can be pretty easy, it just depends on what you want."

Games,3dx8r0,EvilTomahawk,6,Mon Jul 20 13:59:17 2015 UTC,Sentries in the prologue campaign also heal shields   And High Templar have a regular attack!
Games,3dx8r0,jacenat,5,Mon Jul 20 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was pretty neat. Keeps newer players from accidentally sending all their High Templar into the ending army with a careless attack-move.  I think Tassadar's custom High Templar model in StarCraft 1 also had a basic auto-attack. I saw that in a few custom games."

Games,3dx8r0,igncom1,72,Mon Jul 20 09:59:00 2015 UTC,"Why would you want normal maps in a campaign though? If you want normal, you can play vs the AI or play against a real player. I'd honestly be incredibly disappointed if the campaign had more than a handful ""normal"" maps.   I love playing SC2, but I don't play the campaign for the same reasons I play multiplayer. That's just silly."
Games,3dx8r0,Arzalis,22,Mon Jul 20 10:28:50 2015 UTC,"I'd actually prefer a few more normal maps at the end of the campaign to cover all three matchups. By the time I got to the end of the campaign, I unlocked so many cool campaign-only units and upgrades that I would love to play with all these new toys in a traditional sandbox environment. Unfortunately, there weren't as many such missions at the end as I wanted.  Normal maps can be tedious earlier in the campaign when the tech trees are more limited, so the gimmicks did do a good job of spicing things up there. But I think they're ok in a pinch when the tech tree is completely fleshed out."
Games,3dx8r0,EvilTomahawk,6,Mon Jul 20 13:55:53 2015 UTC,"I think I'd agree with that. It's even cooler if the enemies get weird campaign only units as well. There was one protoss side mission in WoL did that pretty well, imo. It was slightly different from a standard map in terms of objectives, but it played more like standard."
Games,3dx8r0,Arzalis,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:42 2015 UTC,"From what I understand through the little info released on it so far, Allied Commanders will allow you to play around in campaign-like missions and level up different ""commanders"" in a Co-Op vs AI game mode, which would not only allow you to do exactly what you want, but to do it with a friend.

Games,3dx8r0,TequilaWhiskey,-2,Mon Jul 20 10:34:10 2015 UTC,I'll have to agree to disagree.  It never feels like i'm fighting a war when each mission is about the McGuffin.
Games,3dx8r0,igncom1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:36:46 2015 UTC,Wings of Liberty and Heart of the Swarm both only contained gimmick campaign missions and they were fine. If you want the more standard build up a generic army and fight they have a Vs. AI mode.

Reminds me too much of HL2 Ep 1 & 2 leading to a never seen Ep 3.  In terms of the ""gimmick"" of the maps. I think you have to mix novelty missions with normal gameplay missions. Which is exactly what Blizzard does. Does anyone remember Starcraft 1's campaign?   It went something like this:   Play a regular game against Zerg Play a regular game against 2 Zerg Play a regular game against 3 Zerg   It got old very very fast. And since most people will be playing the multiplayer as well I don't mind they experiment with the singleplayer.   Edit: Appears I was wrong about the DOTA comment, apologies."

Games,3dx8r0,Broxxiga,10,Mon Jul 20 11:48:08 2015 UTC,That experimentation in the past lead to the Warcraft 3 TFT level where you have to rescue Illidan. That level lead to a mod called DoTA.   wat. DotA is entirely user created and draws origins back to SC1 Aeon of Strife days.
Games,3dx8r0,maverck,4,Mon Jul 20 12:00:09 2015 UTC,"SC2 has been too far to the other side though. WoL was generally 'use this new unit that the mission's been explicitly designed around', while pretty much every level of HotS was a gimmick.  As for experimentation, the community's going to be better at it than blizzard (with a somewhat user friendly editor available, map makers simply outnumber developers), and the number of people playing custom games has generally vastly outnumbered the number of people laddering. Speaking of which, DotA existed before TFT, while similar styles of game existed in the BW editor"

It's understandable that they're going to take some character archetypes over. Dan's just a cheeky dig at former colleagues.  SNK has enough ""heavy fighter"" characters in it's roster that anything Capcom comes up with will always have a counterpart in SNK. May as well borrow back in Nash's case."

These games have themes in their character designs—Street Fighter is ""world warriors"", Killer Instinct is a mix of elemental/fantasy tropes (Glacius, Cinder, Riptor, Spinal) and more recently historical civs (Maya, Kan-Ra, Thunder)—so when they totally break that theme with a character like this it's disappointing."

That's why Evil Ryu's design is very similar to Akuma's design, he's a foil to the regular Ryu.   Akuma also isn't made up. He has a basis in Buddhist and Hindu mythology, combining elements of the Kongorikishi, Oni, and Asura in his visual design and aesthetic.  Oni is also similarly pulled straight from Shinto and Buddhist tales. His name itself is a callback to the Japanese stories of a giant rampaging ogre."

So yeah, I'm fucking stupid.  I know.  PC's aren't something I enjoy using and my PC hasn't seen use in over a year.  PC gaming is not my thing, never has been.  I tried to get into PC games for years.  I've played WoW, Vanguard:SoH, GW/GW2, Rift, Tera, and pretty much every other MMO up until a year ago and with the exception of GW/GW2 I would always quit within a month because I don't enjoy PC gaming.  It's a personal preference, nothing more.  PC's are the superior system but they require some sense of know how that I don't need.  My laptop is only used for Word, homework, and monitoring chat while I stream games on twitch from my XB1.

Games,3dwa8l,Dragarius,18,Mon Jul 20 06:13:02 2015 UTC,They don't make every character with 15 hit combos. Birdie only has a singular two-hit combo. He's all buttons.
Games,3dwa8l,da_brownie,9,Mon Jul 20 06:18:00 2015 UTC,I do remember the casters for the SFV showmatches (or whatever they were) specifying that Capcom wanted to focus less on crazy combos and more on being able to outplay the other guy hitbox to hitbox.
Games,3dwa8l,Zeholipael,8,Mon Jul 20 09:04:00 2015 UTC,No they said they wanted to make links (therefore combos) easier by including a buffer so that skill comes more from the neutral game and there is less of an emphasis on have to pump out one frame links and shit.
Games,3dwa8l,PacMoron,13,Mon Jul 20 09:18:42 2015 UTC,"That change is the single biggest reason I'm hopeful for SF5. 1-frame plinking as the expected mode of play is stupid, especially for getting new players in."

As difficult and ""anti-friendly"" 1-frame links are, they made these combos even more jaw-dropping. People still orgasm to the thought of Daigo doing those insane 1 frame link combos on E. Ryu without breaking a sweat.   Of course, I'll be happy if this works out well. For people like me whom play more simplistic characters like Zangief (Red Cyclone, best cyclone) it allows me to expand my horizons with different characters. At the same time though, it's thanks to playing a grappler that I was able to actually learn how to do combos in SFIV with other characters once I got comfortable with the controls.  It should be interesting to see how SFV will be accepted among the casuals, new-comers and vets.   Edit: a word"

Games,3durl5,ScionoicS,6,Mon Jul 20 14:58:05 2015 UTC,You have to realize. Authoritive servers are a huge trade off. Not just performance but also development time.  They're only beginning to be an option for some games.  Something as fast and action orientated as this title cant do it as easily as something 2D and simple like league of legends.    Take a look at ark. It uses this approach to multiplayer security and mp is basically unplayable because of the lag. Servers cost a lot more to operate when they're confirming every action.  Increased costs means they need to develop the business model to support those costs.
Games,3durl5,ChainedProfessional,7,Sun Jul 19 19:06:45 2015 UTC,"I thought every FPS written after since Quake 3 used authoritative servers and lag compensation?   That's why in TF2 you can't cross-kill with hitscan weapons, the server decides who shot first."

I happen to have a great link by valve bookmarked which discusses the subject from a developer's perspective.  https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Latency_Compensating_Methods_in_Client/Server_In-game_Protocol_Design_and_Optimization  There is a lot of grey area between completely authoritive and completely client side.  You're right to say that it hasn't been completely client side since Quake 3, and perhaps even before this.  I think Tribes was actually one of the first to do something in this field, but Quake 3 was definitely a milestone.    What I was addressing was a system that Ark uses.  Where every single keystroke or mouse action is first confirmed by the server before it goes out to the clients.  This is a lot more intensive then predicting player movement and checking timestamps against a server clock.  Full on authoritive servers are an all around different beast entirely."

Games,3durl5,Sugioh,55,Mon Jul 20 19:09:19 2015 UTC,"/u/Psyonix_Dave from /r/RocketLeague responded in this thread:   Yes, someone forwarded this to us. Let's talk about cheating.  One of the reasons we decided to use dedicated servers was to take control over the authoritative physics for each game so it could not be manipulated by clients. This is a sound strategy that will prevent manipulation of the ball and car physics, even on PC. However, we expected this might require a few refinements to remove any lingering bugs which is probably what is happening here. We have serious doubts that there are very many ways to do this and we can fix them.  Does that mean it is absolutely not possible to cheat once the holes are found? No, but the cheating is limited to client-side information, meaning the same information you already know about the game just by looking around the field. Can this give you an advantage? Maybe a bit but we seriously doubt it will help you beat any significantly better player. It is worth noting that cheating of this sort is not a PC-only issue either. In games like shooters this is a much bigger problem because aim-bots can simply aim and fire for you. In Rocket League you need to understand a lot more about the laws of the physical universe to know what to do. You will be facing the same sort of physics problems that robot engineers in the DARPA challenge face.  On top of this we can add player reporting and statistical analysis to detect ""Player A just did something impossible"". We do this regularly on other games. We're really just getting started here."

If he's the one that made it, it simply from the satisfaction of being able to hack a game. If he's not the one who made it and simply got it off some website, then he's some 7 year old child who likes the feeling of being superior to someone without lifting a finger."

I have a friend who wrote multiple hacks of games for the satisfaction of being able to do it, he never used them in a multiplayer environment.  Because if you do it for the technical challenge and the satisfaction of being able to do it, annoying people online doesn't give you any satisfaction. If it does, then you're exactly the same as someone who just downloaded a hack on a public site."

I don't see how you couldn't enjoy making the hack and using the hack itself for your own amusement. Seems pretty straightforward honestly.  Either way, if you make small time hacks then yes, you don't need to go to online and harass other people, but most hacks exist to work in a multiplayer environment throughout different versions of the game, as well as the hack needs to bypass any anti-cheat software the game might have, which has it's own different versions.   And some anti-cheat softwares aren't automatic or even instant, they just simply transfer the unusual information back to the devs/support team for them to figure out - and because of that you can't just go to a random server for 5 minutes and check if the hacks works, you're required to do excessive testing to see if the hacks is detectable or not. If were still talking about people who sell hacks.  And unlike your friend who most likely doesn't upload his hacks to any where, most people who make and distribute hacks don't exactly give two shits about the people on the receiving end of those hacks."

One specific, first hand case, I used to host a modified/improved GoonMod mutation for PayDay 2 so that there were 5-6x more cops but assaults were much shorter ( 30 seconds, followed by 20 second breathers ) and 1:100 would drop health or ammo.  Still an absolutely brutal experience that a lot of people enjoyed.  Inevitably there would be the occasional joker who would show up and start ""cheating"" by spawning sentry guns or other antics.  Other case are ""trolls"" who go in and deliberately try to wreck games.  They remind me a lot of the script kiddies in the 90's who would knock out whole channels on IRC for no other reason that they could.  The excuse ones go in the learned hopeless bracket.  I have +100 ""friends"" on steam and most of us move like locust from one game to the next, adding/losing people as time goes by so that we always have a community.  We all band together like this to block out cheaters and such, my best guess there's probably a thousand or so people as friends of friends."
Games,3durl5,MIKE_BABCOCK,4,Sun Jul 19 21:41:54 2015 UTC,Competitive people would rather cheat and win than play fair and lose. Especially when they think no one will know it was them. Which is too easy to do in online gaming.   Every single sport has players finding new ways to bend the rules to gain an advantage. Ex. 56% of the last 25 Tour De France winners have tested positive to doping. I think it was in 2005 where the fastest racer never linked to doping came in 23rd or 24th place or some shit.   I do wish Valve would fully ban/disable steam accounts associated with cheating online.

Matches become mostly zone control, as having control over most of the stage means you'll have access to most items first.  Obviously more random and less competitive, but it's not just a dice rolling game."
Games,3dtu3y,riversdialect,20,Sun Jul 19 16:40:16 2015 UTC,"Items introduce a large amount of random chance and can completely change the flow of matches, and Final Smashes weren't made with competitive balance in mind. Having items on eliminates pure player skill being the outcome of matches, which is terrible in a competitive environment. Case in point: Ken vs CPU at Evo 2008 (Brawl with Items on). CPU was a 14yo kid who hadn't been to a tourney before.   ""At the conclusion of the tournament, CPU stated that attending further tournaments was unlikely; at the age of fourteen, he was entirely dependent on his parents for transportation, and that the sole reason for attending EVO was because of a family vacation that took place in Las Vegas at the same time as the tournament""   https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/2xg5nm/reminder_that_in_2008_evos_brawl_tournament_was/  I'm not saying items should never be on. They're fun in casual environments for sure. BUT they have no place in tournaments."

Games,3dtu3y,iceman78772,3,Sun Jul 19 20:22:54 2015 UTC,Was playing PM once recently and items were accidentally turned on. A pokeball spawned and fucking Groudon came out of it.
Games,3dtu3y,Kered13,3,Sun Jul 19 18:16:55 2015 UTC,There is a reason items where banned in competitive play. Back in early Melee west coast tried to to make them work and fell flat and their face for the exact reason I mentioned. Zone control completely based on who gets a pokeball first.
Games,3dtu3y,jodansokutogeri,98,Sun Jul 19 18:24:15 2015 UTC,"I agree. However I want all of that shit for casual play.  Hearthstone introduced 'Tavern Brawl' mode recently and it's just a bunch of wacky rulesets every week and it's a lot of fun, especially for casual players.    I really want Rocket League to be huge and it needs something to keep casual players interested.  In a couple months from now, the skill gap between newcomers and experienced players is going to be absolutely enormous."
Games,3dtu3y,fockface,23,Sun Jul 19 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"Totally true , it needs to keep a healthy base of casuals playing and wanting to watch it be played for it to really take off."

Games,3dtu3y,KingDusty,16,Sun Jul 19 21:56:51 2015 UTC,"These cars have so much potential for other gameplay that I will resent the devs if they only keep them used in fucking soccer. It blows my mind that so many people are against them creating new game modes when these are the most fun cars to use in any game I've played that give you so much control, but then they're being used for the most specific and ridiculously high skill cap rule set.   Without a doubt most players will lose interest in this game within 2 months. There is just not enough going for it.   Also Valve released the DotA editor and now are supporting new game modes made by anyone, so that's a bad example. Or rather a good one, since that's exactly what this game needs."
Games,3dtu3y,symon_says,6,Mon Jul 20 00:10:08 2015 UTC,I do think it needs to be like dota.  A standard  non changing map that is its competitive scene and have the ability to cater to more casual fans through different game modes.

Games,3dtu3y,BeBenNova,18,Mon Jul 20 00:36:17 2015 UTC,"The only issue I could see with this would be fragmenting the player-base. The match-making is already at times not great (I've had Rookies and Pros in the same match a few times), and giving it fewer players to work with would probably exaggerate these issues. With that being said, it seems like a 'casual fun mode' (with mutators/3+ nets etc.) would help keep players who aren't that into perfecting the base game."
Games,3dtu3y,my002,12,Mon Jul 20 02:20:50 2015 UTC,"Are we sure the match-making bases it off the rookie / semi / pro classes and not a skill-based factor (e.g. like in the beta, or was that just a time-played factor as well)? All you have to do to become a pro is play long enough."
Games,3dtu3y,stansteamer,30,Sun Jul 19 17:09:26 2015 UTC,I think having more modes would be great. The core gameplay is really really enjoyable. If they literally stuck only to this map type they would leave casual players who aren't interested in endlessly perfecting their mechanical mastery of the gameplay on one map.
Games,3dtu3y,GuardianReflex,4,Mon Jul 20 02:50:30 2015 UTC,"I'd like different modes based on other sports, like 1v1 / 2v2 tennis with a giant goal behind each team and a netty thing in the middle, or a hockey map with a goal you can get behind, or an American football-ish map with an elevated goal at one end of the arena."
Games,3dtu3y,IICVX,17,Sun Jul 19 12:54:29 2015 UTC,"If they literally stuck only to this map type they would leave casual players who aren't interested in endlessly perfecting their mechanical mastery of the gameplay on one map.   I don't understand peoples mentality that makes them think that casual players don't want to improve their skill in a game.  It's asinine to think that people don't like to get better at what they do.  Everyone wants to get better at what they do.  Just because someone is labeled 'casual' doesn't mean they are mouth breathers who don't have a chance in hell of ever being competitive, so please stop with these type of bullshit statements."
Games,3dtu3y,Jarenien,66,Sun Jul 19 14:57:07 2015 UTC,"I think, generally, a casual player is someone who picks up a game just to experience it and enjoy it at a basic level. Kind of like myself, once I got out of college and got a full time job with on call requirements, I just stopped trying to get good at games. I played Witcher 3 on the easiest difficulty because I don't want to spend time mastering the game, I just want to experience it. Same with rocket league, I'm just here to have some fun whether I win or lose. I think that's the casual mindset.  I've got all this money but no time to dive deep into these games. Most games will lose this casual player base within within a few weeks of peak popularity if they are anything like myself just because there is so much out there and it's not worth our time to play one game endlessly. We don't care if we're labeled casuals and we don't care if we get better at the game, it just doesn't matter to us."

I was just trying to specify a player not interested ONLY in mechanical mastery, which would, in my mind, probably be a more casual player than say, a high ranked player trying to win in tournament play. I wasn't trying to label or slight people, just being specific."
Games,3dtu3y,GuardianReflex,10,Sun Jul 19 13:48:04 2015 UTC,The amount of time a 'casual' player dedicates to improving his skill vs a 'hardcore' player is immensely different.  Hardcore players turn the game pretty much into a full-time job.  That is the only way to greatly improve your skill.  A casual player is someone who can't dedicate that amount of time to the game and therefore have a far lower skill level.
Games,3dtu3y,fockface,6,Sun Jul 19 14:29:52 2015 UTC,"I don't think he means that casual players don't want to get better, just that they don't want to put in the time required get to the same level as a competitive player. I'm sure there are people who play ranked League games casually and are fine with being in silver or gold and don't want to put forth the effort in one game required to get to Masters or Challenger. I know I don't. If I were to eventually get to Masters or Challenger, cool, but I'm not going to play the game for 8 hours + a day for years just so I can be in Masters."
Games,3dtu3y,Normswan,3,Sun Jul 19 19:46:20 2015 UTC,"It was more that there are players who are interested in something other than mechanical mastery, and if that's all the game offers then it will get stale for them"

What's I find great about this game is it's purity: flying across the map in seconds, then having to use nuance to gain ball control. Map hazards or clunky areas (can you image a car pileup?) would slow down gameplay in a bad way since you'd be left fighting over the ball and the map itself. Regressing back towards demolition derby style games seems like a bad decision in this case."
Games,3dtu3y,SuperBloops,9,Sun Jul 19 13:49:34 2015 UTC,Why not a battle mode?
Games,3dtu3y,mizzrym91,6,Sun Jul 19 21:18:11 2015 UTC,"If they could pull it off, that'd be cool. It's just that games in the battle-car genre have a large capacity to be ""meh"", so much so that it doesn't seem worthwhile to try and retool Rocket League into one.   To make the mode work, they'd have to disable dodging and boosts for example, and take out most aspects of the game that attracted people in the first place. I just feel they should let someone else make a proper derby game."
Games,3dtu3y,SuperBloops,8,Sun Jul 19 15:33:16 2015 UTC,And they severely split the playerbase.
Games,3dtu3y,Om_Nom_Zombie,18,Sun Jul 19 14:50:12 2015 UTC,"Honestly? I'm not sure either way. It could either go as you said or it could be hilarious. Imagine accidentally hitting a friend into a lava pit or hitting a ball down under a secret tunnel with everyone wondering where it'll pop up next. It could be great. It could be awful. That's why I'd like them to experiment with it, not like adding maps will remove the old ones."
Games,3dtu3y,Freezenification,2,Sun Jul 19 13:35:12 2015 UTC,But if you play the game with a more competitive mindset you definitely don't want random lava pits and obstacles that slow you down.  And the game is designed to be a competitive game.
Games,3dtu3y,Raineko,4,Sun Jul 19 14:55:44 2015 UTC,"I could see it improving gameplay for some people.

Just make a different playlist for only the normal maps and make one that has only the ones with ramps/tunnels/lava or make one that has both map types."

Games,3dtu3y,Cyrano89,19,Sun Jul 19 22:21:45 2015 UTC,"So far the only problem I have with the game is that after a match is done, unless it was a really good evenly matched game where each team scores at least 3 goals a piece then people just immediately leave and it's hard to get a full room going.  There needs to be a solution to get people to stay in their current room to play more than just one or two games."
Games,3dtu3y,tekmosis,33,Sun Jul 19 16:07:10 2015 UTC,I think the reason for this is that it is actually a lot faster to just leave the room to find a new game.

Games,3dtu3y,PurpleVision,28,Sun Jul 19 16:23:28 2015 UTC,"Stat tracking would be a nice addition, as well as improved (individual player) scoring. Stuff like own goals should be tracked and take away points from your score total.   I feel like tracking saves/assists can be wonky as well sometimes. I feel like there's certain shots I save, that would've gone in 100%, and all I get is ""Clear Ball."" Other times, I get saves for the most mundane shots, that anyone with half a brain could save.  Assists are similarly wonky. There's times I get credit for one where I barely brush the ball and someone scores, and other times, I set up the perfect pass and somehow I don't get the assist."

Games,3dtu3y,stansteamer,8,Sun Jul 19 18:55:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah you do, because goals are credited toward the last attacking player to touch the ball.

Games,3dtu3y,stansteamer,58,Sun Jul 19 16:47:13 2015 UTC,"The core gameplay is amazing, and I believe it has some serious longevity for many people, myself included, especially if they add more cosmetics and free maps. For those that never got to enjoy SSARPBC, it had a couple of awesome* maps. Some possibly fit for ranked play. Others less fit for ranked play, and should maybe be kept to unranked. The game doesn't need more than that, aside from some polish and small additional features like spectator mode.    That being said, I believe the game could benefit from more modes. From simpler concepts like multiple balls in play, to multiple teams (3v3v3, 2v2v2v2, etc), or special gravity. To more complex concepts like an infected mode where gameplay consists of one car trying to infect other cars in an arena, where the goal is the be the last car infected. A battlemode similar to Mario Kart. Maybe an obstacle course race mode, which could utilize RLs mechanics like jumping, boosting, and wall riding. Maybe even complete climbing maps like some RPG tracks in Trackmania. There is some crazy potential. Of course, (I assume) Psyonix is a small dev team. There is a limit to what they can do, but maybe modding tools and/or a map editor is possible?. Time will tell what Psyonix has in store for us, either way, I'm definitely content, just maybe a little hopeful for more.    *edit: I feel like I should make a small correction. I just remembered that the last map I linked (https://youtu.be/DWlGesOnVuQ?t=110) wasn't actually awesome at all, it fucking sucked. I was just trying to think of another odd map I could list next to the horse shoe one, but after actually thinking about it, I realize that the pirate one was the lamest map in SSARPBC. Please don't add that to RL Psyonix!"
Games,3dtu3y,qquestionmark,17,Mon Jul 20 17:35:27 2015 UTC,"Maybe an obstacle course race mode, which could utilize RLs mechanics like jumping, boosting, and wall riding.   This is all I want to do with these cars. I think the  devs would be wasting such an enormous opportunity if this didn't happen. This game would easily draw the Mario Kart crowd and then dominate that game entirely with much more nuanced gameplay where chaos is part of the fun but the player truly has control over their car and how they interact with the map."

The distinction between fall speed and weight is very important in games with physics engines.     For example, in Super Smash Bros Melee, Samus Aran from Metroid is a heavy character but has one of the lowest fall speeds. Fox and Falco of Star Fox are some of the fastest fallers in the game but rank in the lightweight division. A weird perspective is that Bowser, a heavy dinosaur has the same fall speed as Roy from Fire Emblem, an average height male wearing medium armor and carrying a three foot straight sword."

I unbind in game voice and use vent instead pretty much every time I play because it keeps binding voice back on. New maps for casual, and if balanced correctly, for ranked. More customization, namely engine noises.   Things I would not want.   Randomized power ups. A set power up that spawns at a set location (like the full boost) could be interesting but it would be very hard to balance. Really any randomization.

Especially since the training already does that.  That said, I'd love to see more cosmetics, which is something they could add without changing the game play at all. I think this game would eventually benefit from a shift to F2P if the playerbase ever begins to dwindle. Online games live or die by their playerbase and I think they could make some real money off of selling cosmetics.

Games,3dwwzz,jdeart,18,Mon Jul 20 07:20:43 2015 UTC,"Why is it that all these old roguelikes are just unable to create a modern interface?  The main menu looks pretty reasonable, but as soon as you get ingame you still have the same old, terrible, clumsy interface these games had since the beginning. You can't use ""ESC"" to open a menu, even the old ""alt+F4"" doesen't close the game, I had to kill the game in the task manager to close it...  All the information is given in text-form, the key-binds are all over the place and not consistent, you lack all comfort and usability features that became standard for all kinds of application and games over the past 2 decades.  Yes I get that the first release of ADOM was over 20 years ago. But if you want to remake this game and get more than a few nostalgic fans you have to put the work in to create a proper and intuitive interface. No amount of pretty sprites and nice sound-effects will cover up the fact that the game is a pain in the ass to play for anyone that hasn't learned it 20 years ago and no one is going to bother putting the time in now."
Games,3dwwzz,Ari_Rahikkala,19,Mon Jul 20 08:59:09 2015 UTC,"In ADOM's case it's, in part, that this isn't a remake at all - the game code is mostly the same thing that it always was, just using NotEye to slap graphics on it. It's not open source so I don't actually know, but I'm going to bet for instance that consistent support for exiting the game with alt-f4 would have to be coded separately for every single context where the game waits for input (although they could probably make a half-solution by implementing it for the most common contexts). The ESC key is itself a bit of a pain because of how it behaves on some platforms. Still, you're right to expect those features, and I hope TB will come to see it that way, too, because there's bound to be a lot of room to improve this without that much effort."
Games,3dwwzz,kalanosh,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:49:50 2015 UTC,"ALT+F4 is a native windows interrupt that can be intercepted. There are various way to get around it, but programming it in for each press in their loop would be unnecessary. Whatever work around or if they are catching it would just have to be undone.   But if they are preventing it there is probably a good reason for it."
Games,3dwwzz,Ari_Rahikkala,4,Tue Jul 21 02:05:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but that's the thing, my guess is that ADOM doesn't have a message loop. Again, I haven't seen the code, but ADOM started its life as a ncurses program so chances are that when it's waiting on input in some given context (as in a menu, a command, etc.), it's in fact in a call to getch() inside code that's specifically about that context. It might not even be safe to call the game-saving code from all contexts, if invariants that the serialization depends on don't hold within them. Again it's not likely to be an enormous problem to support saving and exiting on alt-f4 (at least in the most common contexts), but it might be just big enough not to be completely obvious."
Games,3dwwzz,chownplus,11,Tue Jul 21 04:15:48 2015 UTC,The depth required from the inputs in ADOM would lead to gnomoria style menu hell where the interface ends up being even more annoying simply because there's too many commonly needed actions than you can reasonably display.
Games,3dwwzz,jdeart,8,Mon Jul 20 09:10:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree. That's always the argument until someone actually puts in the time to create a solution.  And it's not just the inputs, it's also the display of information. I mean about half of all the inputs are only necessary because the display of information is so cumbersome that you need them to navigate dozens of screens to get information that on a modern screen, with modern resolution could be easily displayed at a glance.  Then you have all the context sensitive actions that all require seperate inputs all over the keyboard because the game design is too archaic to allow for contextualized inputs. Just one example you have open and close door as two separate commands, that use separate keybinds, that are always usable, even if there is no door anywhere close. And it goes on like this for the majority of inputs...  It's just a shame because there are some awesome rogue-likes of this era and ADOM is certainly one of them. They would deserve to be played by a lot of people and have some good commercial success. But until someone puts in the work to create a modern interface they will remain a small niche product..."

Just one example you have open and close door as two separate commands, that use separate keybinds, that are always usable, even if there is no door anywhere close.    Let me play devil's advocate here: Contextualized inputs create shallower gameplay expierences. In a proper roguelike I can touch the door, kick the door, throw things at the door, etc. Being able to open a door even if there's no door in sight, allows the designer to include hidden/secret doors, that can't just be 'accidentally' opened.  This kind of interactivity gives a closer relationship between player and character. Why does my character lose the ability to kick when the game arbitrarily decides that there's nothing to kick? ""Guess I don't have to kick to solve this problem"". It reminds me about one of my only issues with the otherwise fantastic Portal 2: They removed almost all white spaces (places where you can create portals) that aren't necessary for the solution.  Allowing all kinds of actions in all situations leads to the unexpected and sometimes hilarious interactions in Roguelikes taht make these games unique: Throwing a melon at a monster because you're out of weapons? Sure! I think I've spent more time reading funny roguelike stories on reddit and other boards than actually playing the games."
Games,3dwwzz,BloodyLlama,8,Mon Jul 20 10:41:21 2015 UTC,I love the mechanic of kicking gray stones in Nethack to make sure it's not a lodestone.  Emergent mechanics like that would never exist if all your actions were hidden behind contextual actions.
Games,3dwwzz,Deathcrow,8,Mon Jul 20 13:12:52 2015 UTC,"Thanks... I had trouble coming up with concrete examples, but I know that these kind of things are almost common place in ""real"" roguelikes (it's something that ""roguelites"" seem to abandon in favor of simpler interfaces)."
Games,3dwwzz,Sigma7,3,Mon Jul 20 13:14:58 2015 UTC,"Contextualized inputs create shallower gameplay expierences.   Roguelikes tended to already have contextualized inputs.  For example, the 'R'ead scroll doesn't work on potions, and 'D'rink potion doesn't work on scrolls.  It got worse with the one game that had you 'u'se a staff being separate from 'z'apping a wand.  The only difference is that you have to declare which action to do first, rather than declaring the item you wish to interact with.  Free style emergence only appears in game that don't restrict sets of actions to a limited purpose.  It can either be Nethack style, where you choose an action and it can operate with a large number of objects, or another method where it defaults to a contextualized input while still allowing the player to throw a potion, or attack empty air, should it become necessary.   Speaking of which, the Roguelike known as Rogue doesn't have all the fun stuff you see in more complex Roguelikes.    Being able to open a door even if there's no door in sight, allows the designer to include hidden/secret doors, that can't just be 'accidentally' opened.   Preventing ""accidental"" opening of secret doors is as easy as making it uninteractable until it is necessary (or ""detected"").    Also, I don't recall that many roguelikes allowing players to open a secret door without finding it first."

As a couple of counterexamples, in ADOM you could throw a potion, or kick an altar, and IIRC (although it's been years since I've played it), there were certain instances in Nethack where you could eat a ring.

Games,3dwwzz,Gundato,3,Mon Jul 20 20:05:54 2015 UTC,"Take a look at Tales of Maj'Eyal. Very much in the spirit and style of the classic roguelikes but with a semi-existing GUI and a lot of quality of life improvements.  The only keyboard command you really need is the auto-explore button, everything else can be handled with the mouse (and maybe that too)"
Games,3dwwzz,Sigma7,3,Mon Jul 20 14:13:44 2015 UTC,"You can't use ""ESC"" to open a menu,   Part of the problem is that ESC was originally used on Unix systems as an escape character, and therefore pressing ESC causes the terminal to expect a second character to indicate which ""escape character"" is going to be sent. Alternatively, you can react to ESC, but get surprised if the user types an arrow key or moves with the keypad with numlock off.    As Dos/Windows handles esc differently, now the roguelike developer has to deal with two different interface systems.     All the information is given in text-form, the key-binds are all over the place and not consistent   It's consistent in the way that the letter is associated with the given action.  It might not result in 1:1 key-action party with other RPGs or Roguelikes, but that's a secondary issue as those other games also have different game mechanics that make parity impossible.    It is doubly hard to do so, as roguelikes generally had to handle HJKL+YUBN as the alternative for cursor keys or on systems that didn't have a keypad.   If you want a modern interface, the best solution is to write a new roguelike (by yourself or finding someone who can do so) and try to see if other's catch on and modernize their interfaces as well.  Until then, developers mostly have to program around the Unix terminal paradigm."
Games,3dwwzz,Rwlyra,12,Mon Jul 20 16:39:14 2015 UTC,"Adom has a pretty simple and intuitive keybinds. They are working on fully integrated graphical interface but the ASCII version really isn't that much of a ""pain in the ass"" especially compared to games like Nethack.  Shift+S saves and quits the game, while Shift+Q quits the game without saving. You would know that if you even tried to read the help section/manual. Killing it in the task manager used to screw up the highscores and saves so I wouldn't advise it."
Games,3dwwzz,jdeart,8,Mon Jul 20 09:36:07 2015 UTC,"But that's exactly my point. There is a reason for interface conventions. If I create a new application for Windows I could use ""alt+d"" to ""duplicate"" something and ""alt+p"" to ""paste"" them, it's not anymore complicated than using ""ctrl+c"" and ""ctrl+v"" for the same commands, but I wouldn't do that because everyone using my application would be used to the normal shortcuts and would get pissed if they have to use different ones just for my program.  Same with games. If you press ""esc"" or at most another key bound to the main menu you can choose the option ""save"", ""save and quit"", ""quit"", no problem. You shouldn't need to lookup a manual to close the game..."
Games,3dwwzz,coatedwater,9,Mon Jul 20 09:49:31 2015 UTC,"But those exact same conventions exist in roguelikes. Stuff like ""x"" to examine, and movement on the keypad for example. These are the same in almost every roguelike. You just sound uninformed."
Games,3dwwzz,Tintunabulo,3,Mon Jul 20 14:29:57 2015 UTC,"What Rwlyra is saying is that in roguelikes Shift-S and Shift-Q is the interface convention. And by and large roguelikes share a great deal of their keyboard shortcuts with each other for the exact reasons you are describing.  What you are arguing for is retrofitting the interface to suit mainstream non-roguelike game conventions to ease new players in, which is fine, but the shortcuts that are there are already a convention in and of themselves. Just like with any game genre, playing your first roguelike game ever will have a learning curve, but once you've mastered that one you can pick up pretty much any ASCII roguelike with relatively little or no trouble. Think RTS or 4x games.  I do agree that pressing Esc to get a system menu with options and an Exit Game button wouldn't be bad though."
Games,3dwwzz,yaosio,4,Mon Jul 20 23:14:29 2015 UTC,"Programmers are notorious for making hellish interfaces.

The introduction of the MG42 so flawlessly broke RO2 that it has to be on purpose. What the game needed was a better DP-28, not an even better MG34.  Now anyone who wants to leave their spawn (or risk being gunned down by the laser buzzsaw of doom) just joins AXIS. All the new players, unaware of how much they have to fight the odds, stay on russia. What you have is a STAXIS of vets with overpowered weaponry facing off against level >20s.   The icing on the cake however is that hero players (players who've played RO2 enough to unlock enemy weapons) cannot get the MG42 on the russian side, pushing more hero players over to AXIS. I have no clue why they did that considering the ONE good weapon allies have over axis (the PPSH) is available to axis hero players.  RO2 has become 32 hero SS aryans wielding the STG, PPSH, and MG42 vs 32 recruits that might as well have never touched a weapon before."

Games,3dub0c,SovAtman,9,Sun Jul 19 21:13:48 2015 UTC,"This is really innaccurate and a perception that is the result of lots of bad history from films like enemy at the gates.  It wasn't a small number of german ubermensch vs a horde of soviet rabble.  The soviets were actually outnumbered on the front for the first 1.5 years of the war.  They never outnumbered the Germans by more than 2-1 until the very end when the German army had been annihilated, and even then at the very end of the war the ratio was about 6-1.  They suffered greater casualties than the Germans, but a lot of that is attirbutable to 2 things.  Just looking at the broader numbers, it was about 10 million soviet casualties to about 5.5 million german casualties.  However, a huge number of the soviet deaths occurred very early in the war, when they were outnumbered tremendously and not in position to fight at all thanks to the ambush.  And furthermore, while 10 million soviets died, close to 4 million (!) actually died in death camps, the large majority of those being prisoners taken pretty early in the war.  Once the eastern front truly was fully embroiled in war, the Soviet forces matched up pretty effectively against the German army.  By the end of the war, the situation had fully reversed and crack Soviet troops were slaughtering a rabble of German irregulars made up of children, the elderly, and the injured.  And don't get me started on the stupid presentation of German vs Soviet tanks that lingers for some reason - the Soviets had the best tank of WWII hands down, and the big German monstrosities like the Tiger were foolish and impractical over-engineered pieces of shit.  The idea of the heroic wehrmacht ubermensch holding off waves of poorly equipped untrained Soviet peasants is German propaganda that the other allied countries never bothered trying to refute because it lined up nicely with the upcoming conflict with the USSR.  USSR casualties were higher, mostly as a result of the disastrous strategic positioning at the start of the conflict, but they rapidly got that under control and ended up smashing the German forces."
Games,3dub0c,hesh582,3,Mon Jul 20 06:12:17 2015 UTC,"So I really appreciate this correction. I knew when I was making that joke that I was appealing to a much more simplistic view of history. I would say that at least mid-1942 you were dealing with a Soviet army that was extremely sophisticated, overcoming the shock of the surprise invasion and early losses of the opening of Barbarossa in June 1941. But you're right to point out that it was only really after their victory at Stalingrad that you started to see a Soviet numerical advantage, and regardless the overwhelming superiority of the design of T34s was evident before then. But the joke was aimed more at the experience of the early battles, if not the tactical reality. The German army outnumbered them, but it was set upon a very broad front commiting a lot of siege and occupy actions. As a result notable battles early battles in Kiev and Smolensk actually had Soviet numerical advantages, though these were parities in design by the Wehrmacht at the time because you still saw them levy their number advtanges in siege actions like Sevastopol and Odessa. And much of the Wehrmacht victory was from encirclement and capture. Basically though I think it was the incongruent casualty rates that gave the popular impression during that war, both in terms of Soviet tactics and the illusion of their volume to soldiers on the ground. I've done most of my reading from what I felt was soviet friendly sources, and human wave tactics were a documented thing. I've seen pictures of soviet bodies naturally log-piled from rushing mg42 positions over the path of their fallen squadmates. I read accounts from early engagements where combined infantry/tank tactics were a completely absent from the Soviet school of thought, and tanks would ride out on open fields getting picked off by German guns while the infantry watches from the treeline. Soviet guns and counterfire were innacurate and uncoordinated. And while I  don't want to overemphasize a harmful stereotype, I've read stories of half-drunk soldiers basically putting the rear of a PPSH into their gut and charging German lines with the trigger down. During this period I think there was truth to the comparative under-equipment of Soviet soldiers as well, owed to the proliferation of some outdated designs and so much captured during the opening days.  In the end the absence of these anecdotes from later in the war doesn't stand out as notably in collective memory. And this obviously got worse before it got better when Stalin angrily flipped the whole command staff and competent leaders languished in prison or pseudo-exile before events like Zhukov's being moved off the reserve armies, or Chuikov's recall from China to be put in charge of the 62nd defending Stalingrad, all in 1942.   The idea of the heroic wehrmacht ubermensch holding off waves of poorly equipped untrained Soviet peasants is German propaganda that the other allied countries never bothered trying to refute because it lined up nicely with the upcoming conflict with the USSR   I would say this is a better explanation for the overall picture. I would also say I kind of feel like Stalin exploited this impression to unbalance the Wehrmacht before launching the Uranus and Saturn counter-offensives. But the problem is that even as the Soviet army began the campaign that would eventually take them to Berlin, even with their numerical advantages their casualty rates stayed disproportionately high, which is kind of the opposite of what you might expect from those battles. I mean decisive battles at Kursk and its aftermath, and retaking Smolensk often had like a 2:1 loss of manpower and 10:1 loss of armour and material. Sometimes higher. From what I know this loss parity didn't really improve till the battles outside Russia proper, in Ukraine and Poland. So I think even the reality of the Red Army's victories that turned the tide of the war in Europe still fed these rumours. Though the reasons for it I think still had to be a matter of tactics, because the quality of supplies, equipment and training were certainly there by 1943. And the larger German armour, while ""impractical"", required a visibly disproportionate commitment to take down, even if it was the expected and obvious tactic.  Basically the problem is that the quality and crucial victories of the Red Army are underappreciated, and making jokes like this really just feed into that. The fact that the Stalingrad battle isn't more widely known and understood is a huge historical crime. But I don't think the proliferation of this impression of the Red Army was invented entirely by propaganda, it's just the counter examples or the reality of the overall campaign were never given a fair treatment in Western history. At the very least most of the SS just sat behind in occupied territory because they were the only ones ""trustworthy"" enough to organize the mass slaughters. That's a rumour I'd rather proliferate. Really I just wanted to make a joke about tracking down RO veterans in Argentina."
Games,3dub0c,SovAtman,7,Mon Jul 20 15:14:15 2015 UTC,"That would be a very interesting take on a WW2 game. I can't think of any shooters off the top of my head that have teams of such different strengths.   Have the matchmaker purposely mess with the teams and give a numerical advantage to the Russians but more skilled, better equipped players shunted to the axis. I really wonder how much of a factor numbers would play into such a game. And how much it would suck to play as the Russians."

Games,3dub0c,namapo,7,Mon Jul 20 09:13:04 2015 UTC,"While I do agree that some of the weapons on certain sides straight outclass their counterparts (ie PPSh 41, MG42, SVT 40, Mkb42 ect) the thing is that RO 2 is a game where personal skill and map knowledge are much more important than the gun in your hands.   I have personally played with some of the best players RO2 has currently active in the US and some simply use bolt actions and still top the scoreboard in kills.   The problem is the same one that ostfront 41-45 had in that some players have been playing this game for so long that they know every nook and cranny to the map, know exactly how/where to move from cap point to cap point, and what to do and when in regards to using weapons and managing sway/recoil. While I prefer to always play attackers, regardless of the map, as I see it as more difficult, experienced players playing on defense can quickly lock down a map because of the hiding spots they know of, and trust me, the weapon they have doesn't matter one bit. It is more an issue of the map favoring one side, the skill of players on a team, or the lack of skill of squad / team leaders that can end a match.   Your tank keeps charging ahead on bridges and getting blown up instead of planting HE shells into machine gun nests? Your commander doesn't know what a radio is or isn't getting any good artillery marks? Squad leaders not throwing smoke and leaving everyone exposed to 32 enemy players where 1 bullet can kill?

If H&D was about controlling a squad, the Men of War/Soldiers; Heroes of World War 2/Whatever The Fuck series is about controlling the army.  That being said, some of the games still have the squad based infiltration. And until there is a digital distribution release of H&D/I can be arsed to go find the discs, that is the closest I will get. Heh."
Games,3dub0c,magmasafe,6,Sun Jul 19 16:25:09 2015 UTC,Eh yeah you can control an army but you can also have smaller missions where you just have a squad. One of my favorite things to do was play with the dynamic campaign mod and start out with one squad of Russian conscripts defending against a german panzer division. I would use molotovs to try and get the tank crews to bail out then I would capture the tanks and turn the tides on the invaders. The fun thing about it was that not only could you capture vehicles and loot corpses/boxes but map changes were permanent over the campaign so you blew up a house or had artillery pot mark the map those changes would stick around if you got pushed back to that map. It was cool seeing a city slowly turn to rubble over time.

Though Men of War: Assault Squad was the popular one in the series but it's more multiplayer focused but it's what the dynamic campaign mod is for.   They're not the best games in the world.

Games,3dub0c,V_Wolf,5,Sun Jul 19 18:15:50 2015 UTC,"It's also pretty sandboxy. I liked taking the ammunition out of knocked out enemy vehicles and making traps. Fill a street with otherwise useless HE shells from that Panzer you took out and, when the enemy approaches for the counter, drop a mortar anywhere on the street and watch people fly as the explosions chain together.  Put a barrel of fuel/rocket/artillery shell just inside the doorway of a building. Lay a trip mine inside of the entrance next to it. When a squad tries to take cover inside the building the whole thing goes up (instead of taking out just 1-3 soldiers) or, if you use a Sturmtiger rocket, it pretty much takes out half the street. Very satisfying."

I just love it.   I love the inventory system,  that you actually have to move magazines from your backpack to your satchel, how the weapons sound, the great mission design, the fact that one of the missions takes place in my home country, and everything op mentioned and that everyone actually speaks in their own language instead of bad accentuated English.   Also I love the mini biographies you get while choosing your soldiers,  the lack of Hollywood heroism.  ""He was a painter before the war,  now he joined the army and is one of the best snipers "" no big deal.   Also i learned something about weapons and the general problem of choosing the right weapons before the invention of the assault rifle.  I always took two primary weapons,  one submachine gun and one rifle, to be prepared for any kind of engagement.  When you finally get the MP44 that changes as it serves a multi purpose role."

Years ago I bought H&D2 on a whim at a supermarket, and boy was it a pleasant surprise. For its time it was pretty damn advanced in a lot ways. The stealth play was also brilliant, when it wanted to work properly. The AI sometimes detects you for no real reason, but when it works its really damn cool to try to progress without anyone noticing you. The amount of weapons and the customization stuff is a lot of fun too. Even has a stat progression for soldiers, but its not that relevant, I think.  I believe it got buried under the other WW2 shooters such as CoD and MoH at the time. Also at launch it was riddled with bugs that made progress impossible. I can't remember how many times that stupid schedule book or whatever didn't spawn on the first desert level. Gamespy was also fucking atrocious with the multiplayer, so I never actually got to try out online. I bet it was fun too.  Still to this day its my all time favorite WW2 shooter, highly recommend it. Now I feel like reinstalling it again.  Still got the inner CD case. Thought the art was pretty cool."

Games,3dub0c,happybadger,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:02:31 2015 UTC,"I've had the opinion that games lost their way when all this big AAA nonsense started. It's a general trend that games now appeal to the common lowest denominator, instead of challenging the player to climb up to the game's level.  The biggest thing to blame is the merging of game studios, the few big ones started buying every studio that put out anything good. With that the emphasize moved from artistic expression to making the biggest buck most efficiently. Instead of original ideas, game studios are now producing games using safe formulas that are kind of entertaining for players and that's the limit of it.  It was made possible when the two now dominant mechanisms were popularized: achievements and leveling in non RPG context (Modern Warfare), and minimizing the impact of fail state (Sands of Time being one significant innovator in this).  With that most games have become steady riding (no real ups and downs), more fast paced, more automation in how the character controls, more grindy, always trickling the bare minimum to keep the player interested. As a result they also become less engaging."

I had always wished that the coop campaign also included the base game levels, and now it apparently does.   Unfortunately I somehow managed to lose my copy and have been putting off getting a replacement for the longest time. Pretty annoying that it's not available anywhere digitally (one would hope that someday GOG pulled a few strings...), but I suppose it's time to acquire a physical copy.  As for the game itself, it was always kind of rough around the edges but like others have said it's so needlessly detailed that it's easy to lose yourself in the overpowering atmosphere. Great music, tense skirmishes, just an excellent sense of place.   I've never played a World War 2 game that really drew me in that way, and I really regret not having beaten the single player campaign back then. Illusion Softworks also did Vietcong if I'm not mistaken, another game that had quite a bit of atmosphere. Shame to see studios like that disappear."

When you walked close to a wall or some obstacle in front of you, your weapon was pointed away from it, making you unable to shoot, like in most shooters nowadays (don't remember if many games did it back then already).  If you crouched behind cover during such a situation and aimed down the sights, you peeked over the obstacle and were able to shoot. Stopping ADS got you back in cover. It didn't work on corners of a wall though (although you could manually lean out for that)."

I guess it was like Commandos, I really wanted to like it but didn't.  I played ""Deadly Dozen"" more, which I thought was like H&D but more shooty less tacticy."
Games,3dub0c,zeroomegazx,2,Sun Jul 19 18:33:41 2015 UTC,"Deadly Dozen   Yeah definitely some similarities there.  Also H&D 2 is definitely more shooty than 1. Especially if you play it on easy. You can say ""fuck it"" and clear on or two rooms alone with your submachinegun, which was impossible in 1 even on the easiest difficulty. (Of course even in 2 you might suffer the occasional headshot)"

There was two on the first Xbox (Earned in blood, Road To Hill 30) and one on the 360, and they are all on steam. Don't know how well they hold up today as I haven't played them for ages, but I remember being very glued to them all the way through. They are FPS games with very basic squad commands, but I would put them up there with the early Medal Of Honor games."

Can projectile from behind you, toss a projectile with an area of effect stun, shake the ground, and a move to leap over the character from across the screen to switch sides.  Which means I can imagine my friends destroying me using him. Hurray...!"
Games,3dv35l,JW_BM,4,Mon Jul 20 08:09:02 2015 UTC,"He does look really fun! I'm still waiting to pick this up on PC because it looks amazing. One thing is I think the leap is a basic move that all characters can do using the environment, isn't it? They just showed it to show the combo string, I thought.   Edit: No you're right, he made a little boulder to do the leap. He has a really interesting move set!"
Games,3dv35l,NinjaBurger101,41,Sun Jul 19 23:17:23 2015 UTC,"I love how far the various ninja characters in Mortal Kombat have come.  From simple palette swaps to each having their own look, personality and fighting style."

Games,3dv35l,Blehgopie,2,Sun Jul 19 23:17:15 2015 UTC,It kills me that Mortal Kombat X severely lacks any cyborg characters. Not even a DLC one. I'd pay for something like Cyrax or Sektor or Cyber Sub-Zero or Cyber Smoke.
Games,3dv35l,HayabusaZeroZ,1 point,Mon Jul 20 07:35:46 2015 UTC,"Too bad they still all use the same skeleton, so they ( almost ) all have the same bodytype, height, and share a lot of animations.  Always been my main gripe with the NRS game. I guess its needed for the X Ray stuff."
Games,3dv35l,Noocta,33,Tue Jul 21 02:46:47 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure most people in the world have the same skeleton structure.
Games,3dv35l,Tacomaster141,-4,Mon Jul 20 01:05:00 2015 UTC,I was talking about the animation skeleton. The model on which they put textures.
Games,3dv35l,Noocta,22,Mon Jul 20 01:43:29 2015 UTC,"What are you on about? An animation skeleton (also called a rig) isn't a model, they don't put textures on the skeleton, they put textures on a model. First comes the model, then then the rig. This is a how a simple rig could look like, the ""bones"" inside the model that make the model move. The outside part can be modified however you like, it's the model. You just have to assign the bones ""weight"" (which part of the model they will move and how strong the influence on that part of the model is), for example this is the weight of a bone assigned to the thumb. How a model and animation looks is completely independent of the skeleton, the skeleton just gives you the ability to move a model, and every skeleton is different because they have to accomodate to the size and proportions of that character, and I guarantee you no one animation in a fighting game is the same on every character.  Sorry for the long winded post but you're straight up giving out wrong information."
Games,3dv35l,SDStormtrooper,-1,Mon Jul 20 02:23:52 2015 UTC,True. I guess they have no choice though. Even Onaga had a similar skeleton.  But the characters are very much different in terms of body type. Tremor has fucking gains and stands as tall or taller than Jason
Games,3dv35l,Kekoa_ok,56,Mon Jul 20 10:02:56 2015 UTC,"Tremor looks way better than the first 3 characters, it feels like they put so much more work into him than the others."

Games,3dv35l,HERRAX,18,Sun Jul 19 20:02:20 2015 UTC,"Disagree. Tremor looks great but the other 3 are a blast. Tanya is the fastest character in the game and has an insane air game, Jason has some crazy pop ups, and predator is so try to form it hurts."

I felt like his fatalities were weak as hell and his intro dialogue, although his character can't speak, was awful. Every character had some generic line when matched against him."
Games,3dv35l,Scorpion8754,1 point,Mon Jul 20 10:37:15 2015 UTC,"Jason wasn't bad, but I definitely think he was the least impressive of all the dlc characters. Each one looks like they got better and better, and it only took two weeks between predator and tremor, so yay for that."
Games,3dv35l,DaneboJones,28,Mon Jul 20 06:12:03 2015 UTC,"Dang, now I'm even sadder that the PC version is an unoptimized piece of shit. I can't run that game even on a stable 30 FPS. Tremor looks like just my type of character."

Games,3dv35l,Hasuman,3,Mon Jul 20 00:13:13 2015 UTC,I think that's because since the awful launch it left a bitter taste in a lot of people's mouths despite all that has been done to correct their mistakes. Even a lot of professional journalists seem to disregard anything Microsoft do.  Personally I got it at launch and loved it. It got so much better when Phil Spencer took over and with backwards compatibility plus a great line up of games this year and last I don't understand how people can ignore it. The only thing it's noticeably worse than the PS4 in my opinion is indie game support but that shouldn't really be a deal breaker.
Games,3dv35l,joem69,-6,Mon Jul 20 01:40:38 2015 UTC,"Pretty muhc what it feels like. Im craving so many games, and most of them are sadly on Ps4 or PS3 such as Guilty Gear or Bloodborne."

Turn shadows low, window boxing off and if you have bad specs turn particle density down. Turn everything else up. The reason it lags is because it runs mainly off of your CPU not GPU. So if you turn graphic-intensive things up, and CPU intensive things down then it will run better. It fixed my FPS."

Games,3dvkhs,lifetimeofnot,7,Mon Jul 20 09:40:22 2015 UTC,That's not the norm. The vast majority of people buy one model and stick to it. System collectors are a niche among those who buy more than a model of the same console.
Games,3dvkhs,fanboy_killer,-4,Mon Jul 20 09:44:25 2015 UTC,I find that hard to believe mostly due to how easy gamestop makes upgrading.

You see it nowadays with kids interesting there parents old cell phones and tablets as well. Upgrading your tech every couple of years is quickly being ingrained in our society. Theres a reason apple releases a new iphone every year, its the same reason nintendo has released so many versions of the 3ds. Most people I know who own a 3ds have owned more than one model. These are adults with disposable incomes who dont mind throwing away $100 when you trade in to gamestop.

One day many years from now ill be able to buy a 64gb card for the same price I paid for the 16gb and ill finally be able to download everything I own. You're essentially forced to be a PS+ member, which is so worth it, just for the online save storage. It's quick and helps when you have to constantly juggle what games you feel like playing.

If so, couldn't Ninetendo offer one NX with a gamepad (for a slightly higher price, though not too high) and then a second NX without a gamepad (for a lower price)? That way, people who already own a WiiU or don't care about full backwards compatibility can buy the slightly cheaper NX, while people who don't already have a gamepad but want to play WiiU games could by the slightly more expensive one. Nintendo could even ensure the price difference was small by just accepting a slightly lower profit margin on the more expensive NX + gamepad combo. Would that work?"

Their manufacturing nodes are even smaller than GPUs now.  Were I Nintendo, I would consider licensing something like an Exynos or Snapdragon ARM chipset that runs in high power mode when plugged in and low power mode when on battery, but the software and hardware would remain mostly the same between the two modes.  Then they could continuously update that platform with higher power backwards compatible devices the way Apple does with iOS.  The hardware would basically look a lot like the NVidia Shield set-top/handheld or the Amazon FireTV, but with exclusive Nintendo software.  Backwards compatibility with the Wii U would be achievable through JIT compiled emulation. Dolphin's ARM port already demonstrates it's possible to do, even if the mobile GPUs are more finicky. They could even make the NX stream to existing Wii U controllers."

Games,3due8l,OccupyGravelpit,2,Mon Jul 20 04:09:22 2015 UTC,"It's worth noting, though, that Dolphin is only able to fully utilize two CPU cores due to limitations of emulation--one core for the CPU, one for the GPU. The Wii U has a Tri-core PPC processor, which means it will line up perfectly with quad-core CPUs, as are the standard nowadays. As a result it's very likely that emulating the Wii U won't be as big of a step up in hardware requirements as you might expect going from one generation to the next."

If they do that Nintendo might as well just focus on mobile games. They can not keep the same Wii U and just incorporate an ARM CPU. They have to develop something that is at least on par in performance to the current gen consoles. Not to directly compete against Sony and MS but at least to provide adequate graphic and power performance for what would be expected with a next-gen console."

Games,3due8l,phazon_pronk,7,Sun Jul 19 19:47:39 2015 UTC,"It dominated the early part of the generation, but for the last few years before the WiiU's release the Wii was consistently outsold by the PS3 and Xbox 360. I think the PS3 was outselling the Wii by around 3:1 for most of that period.  According to VGChartz (which shouldn't be taken as gospel, but gives decent estimates of sales), the Wii only outsold the PS3 and Xbox 360 by around 15 million units. Not really enough to consider domination when compared to the PS2 outselling the Xbox and Gamecube by 130 million units, or the DS outselling the PSP by 70 million.  The Wii did do well considering its lackluster hardware compared to the competition, but it didn't dominate. It might have been able to dominate had it been able to keep up with the competition, but developers abandoned the Wii which lead to a massive game drought and a complete loss of sales momentum. Would that have happened if the Wii was capable of running titles ported from the other systems?"
Games,3due8l,TooSubtle,5,Sun Jul 19 22:10:01 2015 UTC,"Wiis weren't sold at a loss though, which is a big sticking point for Nintendo. For every 1 Wii sold Nintendo were making a profit, for the PS3 they had to sell three or four games to break even, by 2010 the PS3 gaming division was down 4.3 billion in USD. 2011 was the first year the gaming division (which they merged with the more profitable Vaio division in 2010) made a profit after the PS3 came out, it was only a year later that the Wii U came out. So that's one year of profit after five years of massive losses (so in total still down 4 billion) compared to six years of huge profit.  This, and the blue ocean strategy, is probably the biggest reason Nintendo is sticking to lower tier hardware. Hell, the Wii U was the first console they ever made that sold at a loss on launch and I'm not sure they'd want to repeat that.  edit: oh and it wasn't until three quarters of the way through the 360's lifecycle that microsoft had even made back the money they lost on the first xbox."
Games,3due8l,TorchicBlaziken,2,Sun Jul 19 23:11:10 2015 UTC,The point of selling your hardware at a loss is to have a high adoption rate of the system so that you can sell much more volume of software. What's the point of selling one console for a lot of money and selling maybe two games per system on average vs losing a little money per console and selling an average of 6 games per system. Its kind of a risk reward thing.
Games,3due8l,swizzler,-1,Mon Jul 20 04:14:07 2015 UTC,"What's the point of selling one console for a lot of money and selling maybe two games per system on average vs losing a little money per console and selling an average of 6 games per system   Without even including the R&D costs the PS3 never made back the money SONY spent on it, even taking into account all the software sold. Neither did the original Xbox, or the 360 until waaay into its lifespan. There's definitely a big merit to what you're saying but I think the biggest benefit to selling your hardware at a loss is the market presence you get. In every single measurable way besides brand recognition the Xbox was one of the most expensive failures we've seen, but that recognition paved the way for the 360's success.   In a way Nintendo's dwindling presence could be seen as a result of SONY and Microsoft making their own massive investments into their own brands, even if those investments have cost them well into the billions. Nintendo don't have the massive corporate machines at their back like the other two do. They can't sell at the massive losses with other industries shoring up the stability of the company, the blue ocean strategy is really all that they can use to compete."

If anything the only thing AMD/Nintendo would need to account for is how to translate between PPC and X86, but that's doable, esp with the power of today's machines. Apple did something similar when they moved to x86, and that was many years ago."

For example, to access the configuration menu it takes like 10 seconds. We do not need better graphics, but we do need a faster UI and system, so I'm all in for a better processor. I also hope they don't focus too much on being super powerful and end up costing $400 or something like that."

Games,3dv91a,Halithor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:05:32 2015 UTC,I really enjoyed it. The campaign championship is quite huge and I believe the base game comes with a couple of DLC's for free... though I would recommend getting the Season Pass as there is a tonne of additional content in it with lots of themed championship You can pick up the game + Season Pass  for less than the price of a full game and if you enjoyed the PS+ demo it is well worth it IMO.

Games,3dv91a,DarkStryder360,-3,Tue Jul 21 07:56:15 2015 UTC,"Because Drive Club has a well picked list of cars despite it is lesser than most games. I dont think i need hundreds of cars that is filled with mostly cars that I do not want like  Ford Transit Van to enjoy racing game. Also, lesser amount of cars allow the developers to focus more on tuning each car better.  Drive Club provides only the best or most desirable cars from the car industry into the game. The DLCs does add a good list of cars to expand it's roster to offer more than just European cars. In my opinion, Drive Club's DLC is how a racing game should do their DLCs where Evolution did not pad the DLC with one desirable car along with a few cars that I do not want. There are cars they added in the DLC, like Jaguar CX75 are also cars that rarely appear in racing games."
Games,3dv91a,Cheesenium,14,Mon Jul 20 01:42:43 2015 UTC,cars that I do not want   You might now want but plenty of people do. When I buy those games I like variety. I want to be able to drive cars that I see on the streets to hypercars I'll only dream of seeing. Forza has all of those. Variety never hurts.
Games,3dv91a,arup02,2,Mon Jul 20 01:48:10 2015 UTC,Sony already has Gran Turismo for those driving fans that just want all manner of cars to choose from.

Or DLCs pad with cars that I am not really interested in while only have one car that I really want? At the end, most people only drives a handful of cars that they like which do you really need hundreds of cars? I rather have the depth in physics with less cars than having hundreds of cars that drives largely the same.  As you said, variety never hurts, why does Forza Motorsports has so little race cars to offer in it's car list in many of the recent games? Race cars offers a tremendous amount of variety, not just visually but also in terms of driving experience due to rules and regulations in various racing leagues.  Forza has hundreds of cars but somehow it has barely any race cars in the game then proceed to fill the game with filler cars, especially in DLCs. Forza 6 has more race cars , however for now, it feels like they are deliberately holding back interesting cars like Gen 4 GT3s for DLCs."
Games,3dv91a,Cheesenium,5,Mon Jul 20 02:07:37 2015 UTC,I personally don't care if a game has any race cars at all all if I can put a supercharged V8 in a transit van and make it all wheel drive like I could in Forza 4.

Games,3dv91a,Cheesenium,7,Mon Jul 20 02:25:33 2015 UTC,My favorite car to drive in Forza was probably an F40. That's not a race car. I think the race cars are ugly so I don't like driving them. I really don't care about motorsport I only care about road legal cars irl too.

I am not talking specifically about Drive Club. Forza does not have much depth in it's physics too while each car handles almost the same.   Wrong again. So you didn't play neither Driveclub nor Forza. Impressive.    A handful of M3 GT2, Viper IMSA, Indy Car, V8 Supercars or a F1 isnt a lot of race cars in Forza compared to other games. Where are touring cars? Classic Le Mans prototype? Group 5? Group C? I do not want to drive some boring road cars that I am driving daily or see daily or older cars because Forza loves to keep new cars for post release DLCs.   Drive Club does not has any race cars but at least they made it up by putting some really strange cars that barely any games has along with it's impressively built environments. That is enough to interest me to try out that game more than Forza."

At least Forza can make up to the lack of proper race cars with a huge number of cars, all modifiable by the way. Nothing better than getting some old civic and slapping a big engine to it.   It seems like you're just complaining for the sake of it. It's fine to enjoy a game without bringing another one down you know."
Games,3dv91a,arup02,-4,Mon Jul 20 02:38:49 2015 UTC,"Was Drive Club supposed to have race cars? When did Evolution said that they will include race cars?   While for a game that calls itself as Forza Motorsports, somehow it has less race cars and lack of features to do long races than even a small game like Project CARS or Assetto Corsa has more capabilities to do longer races then, it goes and fill the game with tonnes of filler cars with more or less similar physics to other cars. A motorsports game that has barely any cars from motorsports. Why is it like this?  Thankfully, at least they realise that issue so Forza 6 will have some race cars but they seem like they will keep the newer GT3, like Hurracan GT3, AMG GT3 or the new R8 GT3 for DLCs so they can pad the DLCs more with filler cars."

Games,3dyww9,Th3Ph1l0s0ph3r,4,Mon Jul 20 17:39:36 2015 UTC,Simplified controls is a huge selling point for me. I find fighting games really turn me off because there is such a huge level of practice that is required to get to the fun part where you can just focus on strategy.  Cutting out that level of practice is honestly where I see fighting games going. They'll become more accessible and players will be able to get right to the part where they can make meaningful decisions in battle rather than just spamming the only combo they know over and over.
Games,3dyww9,NoMoreBirds,2,Mon Jul 20 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"This looks like something I'll love. I've always been intrigued by fighting games, and I could easily learn the mind games and decision making, just like Heroes of the Storm (Which also ""trimmed the fat"" of the genre, to make it more accessible, whilst retaining the depth in other areas). But fighting games are obscenely picky about -how- I input a move command. I try doing a move, my character just shuffles around, I try it faster, now they just spasm, slower, now they just crouched, jumped, then kicked.  There's a reason why a lot of 'bad' players spam Hadoken in Street Fighter, it's usually the only move people like myself can do. I want to fight the opponent, not the controls which only let me do VERY basic moves whilst I'm getting curb stomped. It's not fun, and it's a big reason why fighting games outside Smash Bros are so niche. And like Smash, I suspectt his game will emphasise decision making, and being aware of move lag (The time between animations), counters, spacing and so on, rather than the usual ""Who can pull off the more powerful move more reliably than the other guy?"" that happens in anything short of EVo tournaments."

Games,3duzwa,ediaz0209,8,Sun Jul 19 19:15:29 2015 UTC,"Replying a little late but own both.  Honestly, both consoles are nearly the same but I consider my Xbox One to be my main console with the ps4 for exclusives.  I just love the Xbox controller much more, and the UI in my opinion is much more faster and smoother. The Xbox support is simply phenomenal when it comes to updates and new features added. Pretty soon the Xbox will be getting a windows 10 overhaul which will provide many extra features and improvements such as DX12 for developers.  The ps4  is still a great console and does have the better hardware in general but by a slim margin (900p on xbox vs 1080p on ps4) for a good amount of games but the difference to me is negligible.   The little things xbox provides over ps4  wins me over in the end but as many others have said, go with what most of your friends have."

I like the controller and with the pending Elite Controller as well as VR it has potential for bigger and better things if Microsoft can use Windows 10 correctly. A big draw is the exclusive content, namely the Halo franchise for me. I would definitely check out the exclusives.(/u/Frankensteinbeck had a good list) Both require a bit of internet strength for the mass that is downloaded games, but also Xbox support has been great to me. Very helpful and understanding when things weren't working. Games run beautifully on both consoles, really I think it comes down to what my friends had, what games I wanted, and the potential that Microsoft was showing.  I really would recommend PC though, it is my ""console"" of choice. Games come cheap, but ports come, well, just look at Arkham Knight. They are trying to making PC more like console while Xbox is trying to make itself more like PC. Plus a good computer can do many things other than play games.also no love for Wii U?"

Games,3duzwa,Kacims,7,Sun Jul 19 22:12:16 2015 UTC,"I own both, each have their pros and cons.   The PS4 has what I consider the better controller, personally I just find it fits my hand better plus I prefer the symmetrical sticks. The PS4 also has what I consider the better games library of the two, although it's pretty damn close and comes down to personal preference. The Xbox One has the better media features, especially if you connect you're cable box to it. I would suggest getting a Kinect version if you do chose Xbox as the general experience is much better with Kinect.   But really, the largest deciding factor should be whichever console your friends have, as at the end of the day I'd argue that's more important than whichever one has the better exclusives or controller."
Games,3duzwa,simuhalo,2,Sun Jul 19 21:19:28 2015 UTC,A big part of it depends on exclusives too. If you find yourself wanting to play Japanese games for example then I'd definitely go with the Playstation.

I have a gaming PC a PS3/4 and several handhelds each have their merits and a weakness or two. But I agree consider PC!  PC - Like nonrg1 said cheap games! Steam sales are wonderful but you have to do your homework to make sure your particlar setup has no issues. Plus of course larger than console investment on the initial pc itself but hey then you have a great PC. Oh and mods, lovely game mods. Skyrim and Fallout mods alone can add hundreds of new hours of life to an old game.  PS4 - Bloodbourne, I know Im biased as a Souls fan but seriously excellent solo player gem. Love everything about it, but I dont multiplay. I also became a big fan of the Helldivers game another PS exclusive that is entirely a team based tactics game. The ps4 as I recall was also a slightly ""better"" system spec wise compared to Xone but that doesnt matter probably in the long run.

Be also warned that both are about 15 (M3) and 20 (CT) hours long compared to LISAs 4.  Western RPGs that have more of the humor and dark kick would be Fallout 1 and Planescape, the Shin Megami Tensei series has that post apocalyptic world that you can lose yourself in as well as the challenging combat from LISA.  Like someone else said LISA is very unique but maybe we might ge a sequel (at least spiritually, if not in terms of story)."

Thank you though, I really am a fan of long plays, and for LISA's shortness, I'm 10 hrs in with no final boss. So I'm happy to dive in to both games.  I guess I could have been less specific, because it doesn't really need to be a traditional RPG. Maybe I'm more looking for that LISA atmosphere, or a game with a dark underbelly, like Hotline Miami. Currently on my wishlist are Westerado: Double Barreled and NOT A HERO, because they seem to have the right feel. I don't know if you've played either, and I know they're a stretch from LISA, but they seemed a little more quirky. Either way, thank you for your suggestions, I will check them out!"

It's turned based combat with a fairly deep job system, and the Brave/Default mechanic really changes the way you approach combat (and makes any grinding a lot more stomachable). The story is pretty cliche (collect 4 crystals to save the world from evil) but it makes up for it in charm. Also the streetpass functionality is pretty amusing if that's something you're into. Check it out! You won't regret it!"

Games,3duzwa,Acterian,2,Sun Jul 19 23:41:27 2015 UTC,"You might try Gladius for the Gamecube or Xbox (or Dolphin!).  While the game itself is rather dated it holds up reasonably well and plays a lot like Fire Emblem with more complex combat.  It places more value in the main story and less on individual characters (besides the 5-7 main characters all your party members are somewhat generic).  Additionally, there is no permadeath unless you fight outside of an arena.    The game itself is quite long (I think ~20 hours for a rush clear and 70+ to clear all content) but it continuously adds new classes and abilities so the combat stays fresh the whole way through.  Another interesting game that is somewhat in-line with your requests is The Last Story for the Wii (or Dolphin...I recommend it actually.)  This game was made by the original developer of Final Fantasy and is very similar in many respects.  The big change is that combat is in real time with you occasionally pausing the game to give commands to your allies.  The combat in this game was some of the most fun I've ever had with an RPG, managing to feel both action-based and strategic at the same time and is possibly my favorite game on a Nintendo system of all time."
Games,3duzwa,xSetax,2,Sun Jul 19 20:47:35 2015 UTC,"Taking a look at Gladius, it does look really dated, although that's never stopped me before (those gameboy FE games waged far worse). It also seems to fit more of my tastes when it comes to combat. Might have a deeper look, however, still in consideration.   Last Story looks interesting. The combat system doesn't really fit for me, but the story and otherwise unique gameplay I've seen might warrant a go."

Games,3duzwa,hmph_,3,Sun Jul 19 19:35:06 2015 UTC,"I second Don't Starve Together. I really enjoy it and it's fairly easy to get together and play it, not too much of a grind either and a bit more challenging. It has a nice, refreshing atmosphere with good graphics and creative story telling. Doesn't bore, can be action packed, can be relaxing, can be stressful. Very complete.  Terraria is also enjoyable and well done, a bit more grindy, a little more challenging, fairly similar to Minecraft in learning curve and accessibility. Simplistic, regularly updated, and fun with friends through easily hosted hamachi or online servers. Good character customization and various modes and bosses giving structure to the generally aimless nature of survival. Very complete with big updates.  Unturned is a good time waster and is free to play on Steam. Simple, impressive for just one kid, unimpressive in any other situation. Not all that intense or action packed, but an easy approach to this genre, but hey, the biggest upside is that it's free. Completion levels: eh.  Project Zomboid is a fantastic game, more challenging, a little buggy, but great art and atmosphere for zombie survival. That said, I've never played it multiplayer but have enjoyed single player very much. Very aimless with very little done unless you are really trying, otherwise it's easy to die. Fairly complete, more work to do.  Personally, though I enjoyed them, would not recommend The Forest, 7 Days to Die or Contagion until they are more put together. (Though I don't know which are regularly updated.)"
Games,3duzwa,magmasafe,3,Sun Jul 19 20:48:58 2015 UTC,Project Zomboid is great but emotionally very dark. 'This is the story of how you died' after all.

Don't Starve is literally designed to make you start stressing like you are in a dangerous psychotic situation. Terraria is blissfully goofy in some of its cheesy sounds and characters Unturned is just simplistic (and f2p) And Zomboid is dark and suicidal   Despite being all shoehorned into one large thriving mulitplayer crafting survival genre, they each have a uniqueness to them that really is what makes the game enjoyable. Each has personality. Alright, so maybe not really Unturned. So I totally agree, and it's why I've enjoyed it more than certain survival games."

It is pretty easy to get into compared to the souls games, and the combat is much more fluid.   It's the type of game where you get out of it what you want. The story and lore is there if you want it, but it's not in your face. Multiplayer and coop is an option, but again, is just an option.

At this point you have run out of pretty much all healing consumables. You decide to look for a different path and make some good progress until you get pounced by three creatures at once from a dead angle. You try to get back to where you died but some NPC kicks you off a cliff.  The question is: Are you still playing or throwing the controller across the room? Because this is what your first two hours, five hours maybe ten hours will look like. And then the game will get punishing.  Yes you will pick up on some of the games meaner tricks. You will learn to properly choose and use a weapon. You will learn the finer combat mechanics and you will level up, but in the end you will be stuck, over and over again."

Games,3duzwa,Acterian,5,Mon Jul 20 21:55:37 2015 UTC,"Dirty Bomb is an interesting FPS in open beta right now.  It plays a bit like team fortress but I find that I prefer it on the whole.  The free to play system isn't terrible, which is also a nice bonus.  Trove is a voxel MMO that I've been having a fun time with.  Its rather hard to describe, but it leans more towards MMORPG than voxel builder (though it features both things).  The game is free to play (and the cash shop mostly just features vanity items) and just released on steam.  If you are interested though, I must warn you the developers are having trouble keeping up with the game's new popularity and there tends to be a queue time to get in.  Hearthstone is a free to play card game by Blizzard.  I'd be shocked if you said you hadn't heard of it already, but its pretty popular and easy enough to learn.  I personally think the monetization of the game is pretty ridiculous but there are a lot of people who would disagree with me.  Splatoon if you own a Wii U you are almost obligated to buy this game.  It has already surpassed Smash Bros as my most played game on the console and the game has quite a lot of content already with more on the way.  DotA 2 / League of Legends / Heroes of the Storm If you have a lot of time to sink into learning a game a MOBA might be right for you.  DotA 2 is the most complicated and punishing but has a good free to play system (all content is either unlocked at start or cosmetic).  League of Legends is my personal favorite and feels the smoothest and fastest of the three.  Heroes of the Storm is the easiest and has some interesting mechanics but features the worst F2P system of the three."
Games,3duzwa,HoochyM,-3,Sun Jul 19 20:35:53 2015 UTC,"Hots isn't easy, and I'm not sure what you mean by it having the worst F2P system seeing as it's nearly identical to LoL."
Games,3duzwa,Acterian,5,Sun Jul 19 20:55:44 2015 UTC,"HotS is far easier than either DotA or League mechanically, but I guess to a degree that is open to discussion.  The F2P system is identical to League except that you earn currency slower and the characters are more expensive.  If you look at the raw income versus time you'll see League of Legends characters, even at the highest bracket, are much cheaper."
Games,3duzwa,Floirt,0,Sun Jul 19 23:27:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, League of Legends and HotS champs need tens of hours to grind in both cases, and the best champs in League are all the very expensive ones that require 50+ hours of grinding. You can get subpar champs easily, sure, and even some good ones, but let's be honest: no one would buy Nunu at 6300 IP, but everyone would buy Rengar at 450. I mean, most people buy rengar at 6300 anyways and never get Nunu..."

(This is just my opinion but w/e)   450/1350  Ryze - #1 Top  Evelynn - #4 jungle (behind Rek, Nidalee, Gragas)   Twisted Fate - #3-4 Mid? (hard to tell)   Sivir - #2 ADC (MS is king imo)  Alistar - #1 Support    4800/6300  Rumble - #2 Top  Rek'Sai - #1 Jungle  Azir - #1 Mid  Kalista - #1 ADC  Nautilus - #3 Support (behind Janna/Alistar)  It's not really an issue of expensive champions being better, it's just that there is more of them.   450 IP = 12 champs. 1350 IP = 21 champs. 4800 = 35 champs. 6300 = 32."
Games,3duzwa,OhZordan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 13:06:24 2015 UTC,"In league the cost is only dependent on the release date and has NOTHING to do with how good a champ is. For every release 2 champs have their price reduced. Lee, Jinx and Gnar are not top tier, Bard and Leona are not even high tier. Cass was not in the meta for like two patches and is only (potentially) coming back because of item changes.  And Fiora... has a very good claim at the top 5 worst heroes in the game. She is pretty much at one level with Garen - a champ from the lowest price range.  And another example to make it more clear: Kalista, from the highest price range, is currently god tier. Then come champs like Corki, Sivir, Ashe, Trist, which are all from low or mid price range, and below them are champs like Lucian, Draven, Jinx, Graves from the highest price range."

It literally took one aspect of the genre and made it a full game.  And the F2P system is similar to lol, except everything costs 3-4 times as much.

Games,3duzwa,HoochyM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:45:27 2015 UTC,"I honestly don't know how to respond considering none of what you said about the game other than the f2p prices being high was true. It sounds like you played one match and then formed your opinion because the game is relatively deep in regards to mastering champions, adapting builds to situations, and map objectives.   Edit: Also, what do you mean ""very difficult to get into if you don't want to spend money""? You never have to spend a penny on the game, and all of my friends that I play with only buy optional skins. Seeing as there's a free rotation of heroes every week (exactly the same as LoL) you can still play a range of champions even if you don't own very many."
Games,3duzwa,OhZordan,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:44:16 2015 UTC,"I have played around 100 games, i have unlocked 5 heroes (I think?) and my Jaina is level 10. I can link you my account if there is a site that has that feature.  I am also a huge fan of the genre and besides playing dota on and off for about 10+ years, league for ~4 and I played a bunch of HoN, Smite and Dawngate.  I watched twitch.tv/gosuzuna stream (i know him as a former league player) and he does not have a lot of variety in his build paths, not even in soloq. I also watched 4 sets of ""pro"" games, to get an understanding what the structured play looks like and it is very reduced compared to the depth of any other game of the genre.   what do you mean ""very difficult to get into if you don't want to spend money""?   It faster to unlock heroes for free and cheaper to unlock them for money. It took me forever to unlock heroes and I didn't feel like I was making progress after unlocking all the gold rewards you get from leveling - and that was playing with a lot of buffs active due to beta closing and launch. I played league for about two years before ever purchasing anything and in Dota I only buy the compendium every year, but in HotS I felt like I would either need to spend some money or give it a rest. And the cosmetics are ridiculously overpriced, like I mentioned, a skin is usually 3-4 times the equivalent of LoL and Dota."
Games,3duzwa,HoochyM,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:47:59 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, it really sounds like you just didn't like the game, which I can understand. The reason the heroes acquisition rate is so much longer is because of the significantly lower Hero count compared to other MOBAs. Also, since beta they've added significant gold bonuses for leveling heroes and your account."
Games,3duzwa,OhZordan,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:24:08 2015 UTC,"I don't like the game because of design decisions - not because I don't like its face or something.  I would have been interested in a simplification of the formula, if it was been done in a smart way.  Other games in the genre have typically 3 layers: You have the first phase where you are locked to the lane, trying to get an advantage through farming and ganking, the second phase where you group up to obtain objectives and the final phase were you siege and split push to break the base. HotS basically removed everything but the objectives/teamfight phase. And you don't make any tactical decisions about the objectives, but more maps tell you when to go for them. Yeah this makes the game more accessible, but it loses soooo much more for it.  Lasthitting might be a bit obscure and difficult for beginners, but it has a very important role. You want to shove your creeps into the enemy tower, but you also want the gold from the enemy minions, so you always have to make the decision whether to pace yourself or to give up resources.  League has Baron, Dragon, tower and maybe jungle creeps as objectives, Dota has Roshan, towers and maybe ancients/runes. So in theory it would have been smart and interesting to add more objectives or have different objectives. The problem is on treasure cove and the raven the objectives are just run here now and fight over this thing and the reward is WAY too powerful. In the flower garden and the spider map the objectives have hardly any interaction with each other and feel like busy work. The mines are a mix of the problems of the first 4. I like the temple map, mostly, although I don't like the randomness and I think the dragon map is the only one that turned out really well. Which is kind of a bummer when queuing up.  I could go on about reduced control effects, the damage balance, the MANY side effects of removed items, the experience balance... - Well long story short, I have thought about this. Plenty.  The game has simplified the formula, but it has shaved off too much for the formula to still work."
Games,3duzwa,Shareoff,2,Tue Jul 21 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"I recommend trying to see if traditional roguelikes are for you because you can sink literally thousands of hours into them if you so wish. They are strategic games, turn based, with procedural generation and perma death, that require you to think and challenge yourself. They're quite difficult and you kind of have to enjoy player-based progression (AKA yourself getting better) as opposed to pure character based progression (which, obviously, gets wiped when you die) Default recommendations would be Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup, Brogue if you don't mind ASCII-based graphics, and Tales of Maj'Eyal if you're looking for a game with a more modern polish with the charm of the traditional roguelikes. Otherwise you can jump over to /r/roguelikes, look at the stuff on their sidebar and ask to find something that suits your tastes!  These games aren't for everyone but I think that if you will like them you will LOVE them and they have really high replay value so they're basically a bottomless pit of time sink :)"

I tire quickly of the meta-game that is building a strong deck/character in grindy competitive games.

If you're looking for something else on twitch you're really just looking at people who specialize in a game like speedrunners or pro gamers.
Games,3duzwa,hoooligans,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:06:40 2015 UTC,"There has to be someone that isn't annoying that streams twitch. I don't want stupid useless commentary, contextually relevant commentary I'm fine with."
Games,3du6c9,Contranine,16,Sun Jul 19 14:38:10 2015 UTC,"The sad thing is that this isn't even a new issue. The Satellaview for the Super Famicom comes to mind, where games would basically be broadcast to Satellaview owners. Even in cases where a broadcast game's rom has been recovered, many Satellaview broadcast games also had live components that will likely never be recoverable."
Games,3du6c9,KnilKrad,26,Sun Jul 19 18:14:52 2015 UTC,"The problem is EA couldn't just release the servers an let the community handle hosting it,.   If they're doing it properly they'd need to invest time and developer effort making the code fit for public consumption, removing dependencies on code they can't redistribute, writing alternatives or documenting what the 'gap' needs to be filled by, remove hooks to other parts of EA's server infrastructure (accounts, download servers, matchmaking, etc), documenting how to set up independent servers, some support or developer contact (Phenomic were shut down by EA and are now working on Spellforce 3 as Grimlore games, owned by Nordic Games), legal probably has to take a look at it, and so on.  So you've got those costs associated with preservation, but the flip side I see is that if EA thought there was value in doing the release then why isn't their value in continuing the servers themselves? For a profit led company, why would EA do something that wouldn't bring income. Even if there was value in Battleforge in another form, reworking the game is also going to require investment."
Games,3du6c9,plank_,7,Sun Jul 19 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"just playing devil's advocate. What if congress passed a new law requiring gaming companies by law to release all code to continue running an online-only game even if the company decided to discontinue it.  Companies could then design the initial server-side handshaking code to to easily remove their own authentication servers / infrastructure at any time in the future, to comply with government regulations.  In addition, because gaming companies know about the new law, they can incorporate that cost into the cost of the game. As an example, the game now costs $51.99 instead of $49.99, or perhaps they leave the price at $49.99 and cut out a few mechanics from the final boss.  My main point is that I completely agree with you, redesigning a game from 6 years like BattleForge to allow private servers has a huge time and monetary cost associated with it, and probably is not worth it. However, if the company designed the code to allow that in the first place (because they were required to by law), then I think the cost would be much less hefty."
Games,3du6c9,revenalt,33,Sun Jul 19 15:25:29 2015 UTC,"That would be a good idea on paper, but its never going to happen.  The industry will never allow this and its not big enough of an issue that anybody outside of the gaming community would care."
Games,3du6c9,Bristlerider,16,Sun Jul 19 16:34:04 2015 UTC,"company designed the code to allow that in the first place   I don't want some laws dictating how I should code something. Coding is hard enough without someone else hand in the jar. Allow one person to do it then soon there will be a lot of laws require things to be coded a certain way.   That could stifle innovation by creating artificial constraints. Can you imagine being an indie dev and releasing your game under such a code. Or people like toady for dwarf fortress where he supposedly just codes and doesn't 'design' his code. So he makes comment about how difficult refactoring is or changing a piece of code is. Would you want to discourage these kinds of people cause they don't know the law or the coding structure is ambiguous?   Simple solution is require server tools or code that allows authentication privately. Very little code would be required and if dependencies is an issue release the tool, community will reverse engine it."
Games,3du6c9,kalanosh,7,Sun Jul 19 19:00:02 2015 UTC,Laws like that would stifle innovation and handcuff the industry more than they would help preserve games. Companies would just move their business to countries where that wasn't required.
Games,3du6c9,MrMarbles77,-8,Sun Jul 19 15:54:56 2015 UTC,"No they wont lol.  The US are still a major market for games, and if a law like this would pass the US congress, there is a decent chance the EU would follow up on it.  If both the US and the EU do this, every major publisher will follow these laws rather than lose their main market.  Its not going to happen because nobody cares and most people are fine with renting games for 200 bucks because they need the ultra collectors edition and all DLCs.  But it could work if done right."
Games,3du6c9,Bristlerider,18,Sun Jul 19 16:36:49 2015 UTC,"I'm not talking about not selling to US citizens, just not having the companies be based in the US.  Are you seriously thinking about a law that would outright ban any person in the US from playing and/or paying for an online game that doesn't follow these rules? That's way beyond the scale of anything that now exists as to be almost unthinkable.  The only reason the US acts so strongly against US citizens gambling online is because they're being ""influenced"" (bought) by powerful owners of brick-and-mortar casinos that see their business threatened. There's no big-money old online game player lobby that's going to cause a whole enforcement bureaucracy to be set up."

Games,3du6c9,mindphluxnet,26,Mon Jul 20 09:24:56 2015 UTC,"I think people need to understand that gaming is and always will be a ""In the moment"" experience in regards to multiplayer.  There is always a golden age, before a game falls off in popularity.  If it doesn't die completely, only the most diehard players remain.  No one can ever relive the early years of World of Warcraft, even if the exact same game were still playable today.  Likewise every  multiplayer game reaches a point where it isn't the same anymore.  Some games cling to life, like Quake 3, but most of them either end up relegated to gameranger or similar community efforts or completely dead.  Your favourite server will die off, your friends will quit playing and the game just won't be the same anymore.  On the flip side, while you may never be able to play Destiny in ~5, 10, 15 years or whatever, video footage of some dude playing the game will exist.  Anyway, I think pirates manage to crack most always online things anyway.  Assassins Creed II will still be playable in some form in 10 years, I'm fairly confident.  Live in the moment, replaying Ocarina of Time may trigger your nostalgia but I promise you going back to a multiplayer game that is a shadow of its former self does nothing for it.  Seeing servers full of bots all pretending to be humans is truly a terrifying thing. (See:  Enemy Territory.)"

I don't particularly believe that's true (and reality shows it not to be due to the numbers of people still playing games like UT04, D2, Q3, etc.) but I also dislike always online for the simple reason of lacking in customizable dedicated servers.  Dedicated servers result in so much more of a community feel for me.  You get to know the regulars, the admins, etc, and it provides much more of a fun experience playing with people I know (who I'm not required to be friends with)."

It would be great if there were some sort of law whereby after they pull the plug on a game with an always online component, they need to release something that makes the game playable - whether by server emulation files, or some sort of P2P workabout"
Games,3du6c9,mengplex,8,Sun Jul 19 15:12:31 2015 UTC,"So what happens if the company is out of business? What about companies not based in the US?

Games,3du6c9,Floirt,9,Sun Jul 19 17:39:48 2015 UTC,"I honestly think that something people fail to realize in this kind of debate is that overwhelming majority of games that are ""old"" do exactly one thing, sit on a shelf or in a box somewhere. People play their game, are done with it, and move on.  The people looking to keep games open for an infinite amount of time are... delusional. The primary reason that game servers are shutdown for online components in things like sports games is either a new game is being released (scummy) or there just isn't anyone playing. Now you might be one of the 200 people playing but... that's just not enough, it's not. It would be awesome for every game to run forever but that's just not reasonable when many of these games have very high reliance on a multiplayer component.  This isn't saying that games that have single-player heavy focus or even components should stop working because there isn't a server to talk to though; because that's probably the most scummy thing a company could do.    If at the end of the day there are enough people that are serious about keeping a game running, the game will already continue running because there are enough people playing the game that would validate the servers to continue running; or... people will find a way to make things work.  This isn't looking or really talking about the companies that are bringing servers down ""prematurely"" because at the end of the day they're the people with the 100% accurate numbers as to how many people are playing at any time during the entire life-cycle of the service. It sucks when a game is shutdown (like Dungeon Fighter Online) but when there are not enough people playing the game then there are not enough people playing the game then there's a good chance that you are not going to have a good time playing the game because it requires a certain number of players to have a stable economy or number of people looking for parties, or whatever there might be."
Games,3du6c9,MizerokRominus,6,Sun Jul 19 21:40:50 2015 UTC,"I think the point is more like, what are we going to do if Blizz decided to being the D3 servers down because they went bankrupt? What happens when GTAV's Social Club shit goes down? Perfectly legitimate SP games won't be playable anymore for no good reason. Or, for example, even in MP games like CS1.6, I can still connect to servers even if Valve brings the metaserver down, same is true for Battlefront 2 right now. If the same happens to a recent CoD game,  you're just boned."

Knowing Blizzard they would probably hire someone to keep the servers up actually, they're actually quite prolific when it comes to people actually playing their games (Diablo 2 as an example, not shutting down the F2P WoW Vanilla servers).  The always online has a pretty grim outlook when companies just shut their things down in favor of their newer games/etc. but so far it's only been the scum that is doing that. What happens when Valve evaporates and your Steam library is gone? Well GabeN himself has mentioned that at least for his companies games they would be deauthenticated and released to the wild but when it comes to the games of every individual company it's up to those companies yaknow?  We all wanna worry about what happens when the worst happens and our games disappear but the way I look at it is that there's probably a much larger problem happening that is probably going to make your games not very important at all."
Games,3du6c9,MizerokRominus,5,Mon Jul 20 01:46:09 2015 UTC,"The issue is that the scummy companies have good designers sometimes, too. Companies with shitty practices make good games all the time, look at Ubi. Sure, Valve games will be okay, but the problem isn't with Valve."

I'm thinking specifically of speedrunning. If something like Ocarina of Time had been online-only, and the servers were pulled after popularity waned, the emulator / TAS scene might have never touched it.   Terribly hypothetical but I understand what you're saying. The answer is that things usually take such a long time to deprecate to that point that it's been in the open long enough to be archived to some extent; in other cases you will just lose that thing, it happens even when things aren't tied to something like servers.   And then would there have been a reboot, if people weren't able to go back and play the original?   Yes.

Games like Destiny, Elite: Dangerous, Diablo 3, the countless MMORPGs out there - they'll be buried in history in no more than a decade, all the money and effort that went into them wasted.

As for LoL, well, unless they implement offline functionality, the game will be just be a functionless piece of code and people will have no reason to pay attention to it. Articles will probably be written about various effects it had on the gaming industry from time to time, but ultimately, since people can't actually go back to it, it's bound to be forgotten.   About WoW - yes, it's a particularly resistant strain of MMORPG, but due to it's nature, it's doomed to oblivion eventually, which might be sooner or later if the subscriber count keeps dropping and Blizzard don't do something fast. Now, due to it's resilience, it will probably be remembered for a while, but still, people won't be able to actually play it decades after the plug is pulled, so it's memory is bound to rot away if nothing but it's past persistence sustains that memory. And what about all the other MMORPGs? it seems like they're dying left and right now-a-days - massive worlds packed with lore, destroyed because of their online-only nature and definitely doomed to be forgotten soon after they lose support."

If you want to play DOTA2 or CS:GO, it's always-online. If you want to play a hollow shell of the games, you can go offline for that. It would be almost insulting to their nature to remember either game using only offline bot matches.  So yeah, for either game I'd argue they couldn't be played offline. Sort of similar to how Centipede can't be played without the ball controls."
Games,3du6c9,adanine,2,Mon Jul 20 01:31:15 2015 UTC,"Again though, some functionality is preserved, which is a lot more than the game becoming a chunk of unusable code because the game doesn't have content that can be played offline. This means that it can theoretically be played indefinitely."
Games,3du6c9,Lolpingu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 02:16:32 2015 UTC,"But what you're playing isn't DOTA 2 or CS:GO. You're not preserving the gaming experience that we associate with DOTA 2 or CS:GO, you're just preserving some chunk of code."
Games,3du6c9,adanine,3,Mon Jul 20 02:48:38 2015 UTC,"Well, if you're REALLY picky, DoTA 2 and CS:GO offer LAN support, meaning that they can also be played using VPNs such as Hamachi. So above the fact that they are preserved as offline games meaning that anyone can play them at any time, they also retain actual online functionality regardless of developer support. As long as they retain that capability, they will be fully preserved in their functionality."
Games,3du6c9,Lolpingu,1 point,Mon Jul 20 03:16:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think I'm being picky at all. The point of preserving games (For me) is to preserve the experience that you get from playing that game, which can lose something if you take it out of it's intended environment.  Easy example: Guitar Hero/Rock Band. Imagine the code easily being preserved into the future, but the controllers and specs aren't. The only easy way to play these games is with a standard gamepad. You've preserved the game code, but not the experience, and I don't think it's really worth preserving the code unless we can also preserve the experience.  So let's apply that to our DOTA/CS:GO LAN equivalent: You've lost matchmaking, which removes the ""Being matched against someone of equal skill"" feature. Coincidentally both games you mentioned may have the highest skill ceiling out of any current online game. It would not be fun to get stomped or be the stomper for 60% of the games you play. Technically both games operated without this at one point, but those are not times I want to go back to.  You've also lost convenience. I've used Hamachi in a similar setup for a few LAN games, and it's just a pain to setup for every single user (WHY THE HELL ARE USERNAMES CASE-SENSITIVE?!). Today you can jump on to CS:GO or DOTA 2 and be in a game in minutes, if not less. That's just not an option as you'd need to organize a scheduled time for 10~ people, which would be hell just as a one-off scenario, let alone recurring enough to get a decent taste of either game.  Finally, there's the cost. Lately with Hamachi you (Or atleast, I) have an awful tendency to get put on a relayed tunnel instead of a direct one. For me, that completely kills any prospect of online gaming (>400ms ping). You can go through a paywall to avoid it though, but maybe that's just a thing that only hits non-Americans (It depends on where the tunnel gets relayed I guess).  Still, losing skill-based matchmaking and convenience is for me enough to significantly hurt the overall game experience for CS:GO and DOTA 2. I wouldn't really call the result the same experience, even if it's technically the same game. It's the same as taking the instruments away from Guitar Hero/Rock Band. It's the same game, but it's not the same experience."
Games,3du6c9,adanine,1 point,Tue Jul 21 08:05:41 2015 UTC,"No offense, but you're getting really petty at this point. True, the game isn't preserved to the last detail, but it's sufficiently preserved to the point where a similar experience can be offered. Saying that it not having every last feature that it had back when it was still supported might aswell be nothing because it's not the exact same experience, as if the game became completely unplayable when the developers pulled the plug is really quite unfair."
Games,3du6c9,Lolpingu,1 point,Tue Jul 21 10:03:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think it needs to be preserved to every detail - I don't think the customizable aesthetic collectibles of either game is any way required, for example.  I do believe that matchmaking and the convenience factor is an important part of what makes those games great though, and preserving the game without preserving those things isn't truly preserving the game. It's not a huge issue, I suppose, but it's better then nothing.  Online games where developers have to pull the plug is unfair, but no one's a winner there. I'm not a fan of games that are monetized by a one off purchase yet have a persistent online experience - because it's just silly to assume that's going to end some other way."
Games,3du6c9,adanine,3,Tue Jul 21 10:19:02 2015 UTC,That's just the nature of multiplayer-centric games. It really can't be helped. If a game is based around your experience with other players in real time then that's always going to diminish as time goes. People move on. It's not a waste of investment either if it finds success even in the short term. They will be remembered. Just because few or no people play an MP game any longer doesn't mean there is no point.

It's as if every copy of a book self-destructed after people stopped reading it and the author stopped publishing it. It's lost information, lost potential experiences, lost documentary of the evolution of gaming, especially since video game developers rarely release source code to the public, so even people with coding experience can't extract useful information from plug-pulled games, so they essentially become useless pieces of code. Something about that is really sad to me."

Nevertheless, since backwards compatibility seems to be a near-extinct feature on consoles anyway, many games that are exclusive to consoles are forgotten because most newcomers to gaming elect to buy consoles of the newest generations and not bother with the older ones. That is, unless they are emulated or unless the person in question has dosh to spare for old consoles."

Take Phantasy Star Universe, it got shut down and if I'm not mistaken people are playing that now.. which reminds me I should go and set that up.   Diablo 2 isn't running official servers, is it?

""Dude the only way you can play it is online! What's going to happen one day when OSI decides to pull the plug on it!"" A lot of what was said? Same things I've heard on here.  2015 not only is Ultima Online still around, however there's a ton of server emulators up and running. By the way UO had people working on those starting in 1999 as well. Those MMO's that have died? Matrix Online has one, Earth and Beyond has one, I'm sure City Of Heroes has one. SWG has one that they have been working on now from the day the Pre-CU game went bye bye.  But hey I know... I'm just talking about MMO's on the PC. A game like Destiny is on the consoles only. If it dies tomorrow it's going to stay dead forever and we'll have to get Destiny 2.  Fun thing to point out... Back in 1995 people believed we'd never see an emulator that would be near perfect for the NES. Then that happened, and people believed we'd never see that with the Genesis/Mega Drive, or the SNES. Same with the N64, Playstation, and a number of other systems and why am I talking about this?  I'm sure down the road we'll see something like that pop up. And I'm sure people will go in and end up getting a Destiny server up and running. Fanbases are like that, more so never ignore the fact that someone can make a buck off things like that.  How many times have we seen Nintendo, Sony or Microsoft redo something and throw it up for sale? Or revamp some old game for a modern system? Hey look at GOG.com they made themselves thanks to people like me dropping six bucks to play Starfleet Command, TIE Fighter and Crusader again.  Over all what I'm saying is this, old games never die. Sure they may not be like you remembered them. However even something that's 'always online' is never going to really go away. People will find ways to get them back up or someone will find someway to make a buck off of them."
Games,3du6c9,masonicone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:23:26 2015 UTC,"But what if the loss of 75% of all silent movies was mainly due to issues with regard to storage and physical degradation? Sure, the issue of shutting down game services is always a threat, but now we can maintain the core of these games for years and years to come with no physical degradation because it's all digital. Server breaks down due to age/catastrophe/company termination? No problem, there's 100 more copies of the files stored in another location that can be rehosted as needed.  IMO, physical media has more of a chance to be lost over time simply due to usage, scratches, losing the disc, etc. It would be a smart business decision (in the far future) to create a company who's sole purpose is to rehost the servers to always-online games who's parent company has had to shut down servers for whatever reason and keep the gaming going. I recognize it may not be that simple (rights to rehost the game on another company's servers would likely be an issue) but I don't believe that once a game's servers are shutdown, then that's a doomsday scenario and you never see the game again.  I agree with you in that this can be a deadly proposition if publishers get it into their heads that they can manipulate the users into buying their next titles by shutting down the previous entries. But looking at all the good that's come from digital distribution in services like GOG and Steam, I can't help but feel that one day, you're going to be able to experience those nostalgic memories of always-online titles even if it's via a different platform. People are always resistant to change at first"

On the flipside, multiplayer can mean the complete opposite for a well made game with support. The problem with this dilemma is hardware as a limiting factor and merging the concept with a single purchase experience.  I hate that I can't do any of the online stuff in white knight chronicles because the servers were shut down - and a fun aspect of the experience was removed.

In fact I've thrown away all my old games every couple of years because I know I will never go back and play them again and I've even begun removing games from showing up in my Steam library because the list is too long.   I think this is something that is mainly a problem for collectors and nostalgics, but collecting digital isn't really the same as physical either and physical is disappearing fast. As for the companies themselves, I think they justify it as combating piracy and are recognizing that people like myself don't really care if an unpopular online game disappears from the face of the planet."
Games,3du6c9,floodster,0,Mon Jul 20 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"You put always online and multiplayer in the same basket. I think these are two different cases. Multiplayer games can't exist without being always online and connected to a server, while for single player games there is no reason whatsoever to be always online. The archiving discussion is a different thing, and as the perception of games is still shifting I believe this issue will be resolved. It is sad to see a game closing down making it a lesson that can never be learned again. Not to mention all the time and passion that players put into that game that is forever lost to them. Now the biggest issue, to me at least, is always online for single player games. This is truly un-consumerism at it's worst. This is the publishers saying ""fuck you"" to their customers. Even though the consumer bought the game at full price he will only get to play the game if the publisher is kind enough to allow it. These are issues that plague the gaming industry and I think the ball is on the publishers side. Even while treating the consumers as thieves and pirates the gaming industry is now the biggest of the entertainment industries. Imagine what it will look like if all publishers will treat the consumers fairly. I think I went off track somewhere and kinda went on a rant of my own..."
Games,3du6c9,alonweiss,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:52:08 2015 UTC,"Multiplayer games can't exist without being always online and connected to a server,   Games such as Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War and Sid Meyer's Civilization III didn't require being always online and connected to a server, supporting LAN play.  The only reason it does now is because the developers pulled LAN support.   Certain games, such as Master of Orion II, work with hotseat.  Even if the game works online, it doesn't even need to be online.   Some games, with the GameSpy server collapse, could technically work by specifying a direct IP address. This allows LAN play without being online.   Also in the very old days, games such as Doom, Quake and others didn't even have a centralized server beyond the host.  Either setup a LAN game wherever, or create a dedicated server.   If all these games can handle multiplayer without being always online, then so can any other game."

There was criticism and it was legit.  I know at least on the giant bomb podcast they lambasted the movement every time they brought the game up.  Geralt would be slow to start moving, but then he'd go from too slow to too fast all of a sudden.  That made predicting your movement in smaller spaces difficult.  Then when he's moving fast, he has the turning radius of a semi truck unless you do a hard enough turn to stop his movement, and then you're back to the too slow / too fast issue.  The movement problems are exacerbated by the unpredictable loot hitboxes and overwhelming amount of close together boxes etc. that you need to loot.  So you're trying to make micro movements to line up with the object so you can get the loot prompt, but Geralt is moving in ways you don't expect.  All that said, you can get used to it to a large degree, but the new movement mode is just a million times better and I give CDPR major props for adding it."

What made the witcher 3 worse IMO is that Geralt went from a standstill to full running speed in 0.1 seconds and there were at least a couple of places it easily caused a death. Also with combat being melee based where as with GTA you tend to keep things at range and shoot em.   Looting has already been mentioned but it really was far more of a pain with the witcher, GTA tended to have snapping towards ladders or being fairly forgiving with interactables, compare it and you have areas with a table/chest/cupboard/torch, etc all in close proximity and you only want one of them, that simply never came up in GTA but was overly common in the witcher."

Games,3dw6jr,mkallday10,8,Tue Jul 21 03:12:44 2015 UTC,It wasn't singled out. Every game that has this issue gets flak for it. The only reason you are noticing it for Witcher 3 over other games is because the devs actually did something about it.
Games,3dw6jr,DRACULA_WOLFMAN,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"I think another reason the issue came up with so many people for Witcher 3 specifically is because it's not at all uncommon to spend 100+ hours overall in the game. After 100 hours of playing the same game, things which should be minor inconveniences will eventually bother you enough times to become notable. One or two deaths from accidentally walking off a cliff because Geralt turns around by walking in a circle? That's fine. When it happens 5 to 10 times over the course of 100 hours, suddenly it'll start to grate on you."
Games,3dw6jr,cardosy,11,Mon Jul 20 03:46:18 2015 UTC,"That wasn't the case for me; quite the contrary. I was replaying Dark Souls when TW3 launched and I immediately felt Geralt very heavy and unresponsive, having a rough time at the beginning of the game, but after some hours I got the hang of it and rarely did something unintended. 110 hours later, I decide to come back and finish Dark Souls and damn, character movement feels so floaty and arcadeish... It's very precise, but at the same time very fake and non-immersive!     What I mean is, I believe it's natural to compare your new game to the previous one you've been playing and that's where most critics for TW3 movement came from, but once you get the hang for it you're fine. It's not exactly bad, just different, and as such requires some time to get used to it."

I haven't played 1.07 yet so no idea how they changed it, but my beef with TW3 was that Geralt ran too fast. He moved at sprinting speed because of the open world, which made running through a lot of areas a chore."
Games,3dw6jr,Spikex8,1 point,Mon Jul 20 08:00:54 2015 UTC,Yeah. I feel like the walk feature completely fixes the issue and that you shouldn't sprint around in doors and expect to not smack into shit. People are just too lazy to hit the walk toggle I guess. I did spend the first 20+ hours never using walk and I finally accepted I need to stop being an idiot and use it. The lighting torches that are all over the fucking place was just bullshit though. There's never even a reason to light the torches it's just a gimmick. The places with torches are already bright enough to see and the places that are actually dark never have any damn torches anyway so you need to drink a cat eye.
Games,3dw6jr,Dullahan3470,6,Tue Jul 21 02:51:59 2015 UTC,To be honest I rarely had an issue with the candles either.

Games,3dw6jr,DeeJayDelicious,4,Tue Jul 21 14:08:34 2015 UTC,"Personally I never had a problem with the Witcher 3's movement. I can understand it might have felt a little inaccurate with a KB+M but it felt responsive enough with a controller.  As to why it was singled-out, I believe it was for two reasons:   The game is held in high regard. There is very little to complain about so even fairly minor issues stand out and become a point of debate. Witcher 3 has a focus on melee combat and is compared to Dark Souls and similar games that place less emphasis on realistic animations and character behavior. And with this emphasis the ""unresponsive"" movement tends to stand out."
Games,3dw6jr,PandaBouse,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:40:12 2015 UTC,KB+M for me was much better than playing on controller.
Games,3dw6jr,ChimpMobile,1 point,Mon Jul 20 12:20:01 2015 UTC,"I can understand it might have felt a little inaccurate with a KB+M but it felt responsive enough with a controller.   It's actually the other way around. I've heard so many complaints with people using a controller due to issues with simple solutions on PC, Geralt's movement in small areas being one of these. On PC, it's easy to just bind a key to Toggle sprinting/walking on and off, which is why I've never had that issue.  I think it's just that using a KB+M allows for more keys available for use. Keys dedicated to doing simple actions make the game feel better overall. The problem with a controller is that it doesn't have nearly enough buttons to bind every action to. That's where I see the controller falling flat when it comes to some of the issues I see mentioned."
Games,3dw6jr,Raineko,2,Mon Jul 20 20:03:54 2015 UTC,Why would you toggle walk if you can just press the control stick slightly for walk and strong for run?  Never had problems with the controller.
Games,3dw6jr,ChimpMobile,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:35:19 2015 UTC,Some people were mentioning issues with the stick being annoying to keep slightly pushed for periods of time and how there is no movement option in between walking and sprinting when using a controller. I haven't used a controller for this game though. I'm not sure if this is all true. It's just what I've heard.
Games,3dw6jr,grendus,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:44:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly, the only issue I had in TW3 related to movement was picking up items that were stacked. If you have two corpses, a basket, and a candle all right next to each other and you want to loot the basket (because the corpses only have rusty swords on them), good luck not igniting/extinguishing the candle 15 times before you can target the basket. A targeting dot in the middle of the screen or a ""toggle through potential targets"" button would have fixed it."
Games,3dw6jr,Raineko,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:38:11 2015 UTC,"There was a (invisible) targeting dot in the middle of the screen, you just had to fixate the camera on the thing you wanted to interact with. Never had the lighting candles problem."

Games,3dw6jr,Infinitedaw,2,Tue Jul 21 14:40:28 2015 UTC,"I would say because Skyrim is a closer point of comparison and that had crisper movement. Also consider how melee is more important in Witcher and Skyrim than it is in Rockstar's games. GTA has auto aim and the character automatically moves when entering cars or grabbing ladders, entering certain doors, etc. this means the heavier movement still works with the gameplay because the game compensates for the heavy movement. When it comes to more medieval style rpg/sandbox there is greater significance place on accuracy and precision of movement."
Games,3dw6jr,TheEldestScroll,2,Mon Jul 20 02:18:15 2015 UTC,I disagree because any time the weightiness was a problem in the witcher 3 it was trying to open doors and walk up and down stairs out of combat. I thought the combat was pretty damn solid.

With the more precise alternative movement, it sacrifices realism for convenience"

The new system is easier and maybe a tiny bit better overall but the old one was still perfectly serviceable. The problem people were having I think is movement being decoupled from camera and rotation based instead of strafe based like most action games are. It requires a different way of thinking about movement compared with most games but thats the only negative (if you even consider it one).  I think a big part of the problem is how incredibly ""samey"" games are these days. <old coot mode>Back in MY day</old coot mode> developers were still experimenting with control schemes, every game you had to learn something different and so for me and a lot of older gamers it's not a big deal. Younger gamers though have basically always had a pretty uniform setup (I'd love to see the look on you kids faces trying to play quake with a keyboard ONLY) and so alternative things just seem ""wrong"" to them instead of just ""different"". I think it's the same thing going on with Deus Ex 1, they moan about the gunplay because it's not ""tight"" like CoD, but it's not SUPPOSED to be, it's an entirely different paradigm based around RPG stats and simulating ""aiming"" instead of some unrealistic ADS crap.   So what do you guys think? Is there something wrong with the movement in TW3 but not in the HD GTA's and RDR, or is this just a case of CDPR trying to make everyone feel comfortable?    It's just CDPR being Broskis and responding to customer complaints, even if they were a little silly to begin with IMO."
Games,3dw6jr,Rednakin,6,Mon Jul 20 06:24:06 2015 UTC,"To me the Witcher 3 was a big disappointment. The movement (constant twitching, the horse AI getting stuck everywhere, unresponsive controls), the combat (poor hitboxes, strategy is essentially ""go into a menu and pick the weapons that work on the enemy best"", sword sponge) and the pacing (The main quest cannot be played without interruption because if you're underleveled the game tells you to backtrack to level up more by introducing enemies that heal themselves, which you wont find out about until you have been trying to defeat the same boss for a half an hour) just killed it for me. If the game is only 2 hours in and the gameplay is already that dreadful, you do not deserve a GOTY award by any means. The story and dialog sounded nice. It's too bad they decided to pick spoiler as the main antagonist but what can you do."
Games,3dw6jr,Clewin,1 point,Mon Jul 20 11:01:10 2015 UTC,"The main complaint that I know of is the movement is console-ish on PC. RDR hasn't been released on PC, so I don't know if they plan to tweak it, but RDR also didn't have locations where finesse jumping was required and it was almost impossible to get Geralt to stop on these, even when you just touched the w key, jumped, and let go - he'd lumber forward a step and jump, then keep running until he fell off the ledge. You pretty much had to start from the back of the ledge and jump to hit the front of the next one. The good news is there weren't very many of these (that I found)."

Games,3e1yeh,Jaywearspants,0,Tue Jul 21 13:51:25 2015 UTC,The lack of voice chat is terrible. It's one of the things that makes the game so frustrating and a lot less fun.  Nintendo made a giant misstep by not including onboard voice chat.

It sounds like that ""review"" was created at launch (I use the word ""review"" loosely here, because they based an opinion on how it ""looks"").

Games,3dusuu,Flukie,4,Sun Jul 19 20:20:18 2015 UTC,"Completely agree.  The last title I played, PGA Tour 2004, was brilliant. It had a progression system similar to this but you also unlocked sponsorships if you played well enough, which gave you access to top end stuff. You also had to earn money through competition placements to actually buy gear, rather than it being automatically unlocked when you ""level up"" like the new iteration. I do like the new level style in that you have to balance different attributes using up to 4 (out of 20 or so) separate playstyles that increase and decrease stas, so you can no longer max everything out, but I do miss the progression of earning cash to buy gear. Also everything, even the ball and grip, used to affect your attributes meaning you had to balance your gear, but now it's just the club heads that do.  Amongst other things that reviewers have listed, RM PGA is currently missing a sense of progression that the older titles had. I've not noticed any differences between winning a tournament and finishing in the top 10 or 20. There's no extra experience, no extra gear unlocked, just a post match message simulating a press release going ""Oh, btw, you won"". There used to be incentive in older titles to win tournaments, higher placing means more cash leading to better gear, but unlocking everything automatically as you level up just feels so hollow. There's quite a bit of disconnect in career mode currently that the older titles had no problem with; I have no motivation to play career mode other than an interest in golf and wanting to develop my own pro.  There's the foundation of a solid golf game there, the mechanics and graphics are pretty good, but that's all RM PGA is at the moment - a foundation. I'm enjoying it because my last PGA game was 11 years ago, but the £40 they're charging is very high for bare bones content. They either need to release a lot of free DLC to bring it up to par with older titles, or it should have a far lower price point.  All of the criticisms it is facing are valid, and EA have a lot of work (either by future expansions/releases or DLC) to bring this game up to scratch."
Games,3dusuu,OldBoltonian,6,Mon Jul 20 10:40:04 2015 UTC,or maybe some of the PC titles even. The golfing thing has entirely become way too formulaic and needs to be looked over... some of this UI though... ugh.

The graphics are not at all close to the trailers I've seen, as texture pop-ins and various graphical glitches occur quite often.

I feel like Dan's overt negativity towards the game is a little too much; as this game really feels like a return to form for the genre with the developers going back to the basics of what a golf game is without any of the flare that you get from a decades worth of tacking garbage onto the game over the course of a console cycle.

Then you need to look over your code so that it works with a variable timestep so that the PC gaming master race won't complain about 30 FPS or the game running at double speed at 60. And then you find out the GPU driver is doing something weird trying to optimise you code and aaaaaaaaaaaaargh.   It's a mess.

This suggests that ceterus paribus PC is on equal footing for sales of games in genres PC players play.   that said: if you target a console first, that console's manufacturer will often provide development support and you only have to test on one version of the hardware.

The bulk of any porting effort is typically going to be porting between the different libraries and SDKs that each platform uses.

Games,3duvgl,ToastedFishSandwich,4,Sun Jul 19 19:18:52 2015 UTC,"tl;dr:   Going from PS3-->PS4 is a huge leap that gets you a lot closer to a PC-like dev environment. The quotes are in that context. Vertical slice mentality drives developers to make games for a single system spec. The PS4 and XB1 both are the most widely owned gaming systems in the world (in terms of a single spec). They even beat PC in terms of a ""single spec sheet."" Going back and making your engine support all system specs is time consuming and hard.   Those quotes are all referring to the jump from the Xbox 360/PS3 to the Xbox One and PS4. And they're not wrong - going from previous gen to current gen definitely made the consoles much more PC-like in their architecture.  But there are still differences, and those differences are still costly.  The big cost is that, when you're developing for a PS4 or Xbox One, you're developing for a single spec and single system that you know millions of people will have. With PC, you have to make your game generic and able to work on a whole host of different configurations and such. You might have a GPU that beats the PS4, but your RAM might not, and developers have to account for that.  A lot of it goes back to the ""vertical slice"" mentality that still dominates game development. If your goal is to create a vertical slice to stay on track and keep getting publisher funds, you'll design for a single system.  It instantly eliminates a whole host of potential errors when the only thing you care about is one or two systems.  As soon as you think about PC, you usually need developers that are going back and refactoring a bunch of code.  One specific example:   PS4 version and texture loading just says ""fuck it, load the texture because I know at this point I'm not using all 8gb of my VRAM yet."" Now, when you go back to the PC, you have to completely change that entire texture loading code segment to deal with computers that don't have 8gb of VRAM (which is most of them).   Anyways, this is a very generic and ELI5 explanation. There will be some holes here."
Games,3duvgl,Mattenth,5,Sun Jul 19 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"Also, PS4 can read AND write to it's memory from both the GPU and CPU at the same time.   B:AK I think screwed up on the PC becasue they just tried to brute force this, which lead to massive (far worse than the worse case scenario on the PS4) during the Batmobile sections because it can't do that all at the same time, causing stutters and large drops as it tried to load in data.   If Iron Galaxy had bothered to tailor the streaming of data from a PC perspective instead of brute forcing it, it would have been much more smooth."
Games,3duvgl,jschild,4,Sun Jul 19 19:34:11 2015 UTC,"Both consoles have GPU/Northbridge integration which is a significant departure from the PC. In short the PC has a bus which needs to be managed. The consoles do not have to use the bus to transfer textures to the GPU. Promoting a software asset to a hardware asset on the console does not require moving the asset to a different chunk of memory.  Because of this the primary technical hurdle of porting, resource management, is still as existent as ever.  This is without getting into human facing issues like interfaces."
Games,3duvgl,G_Morgan,5,Mon Jul 20 10:08:18 2015 UTC,"I think those comments have to be seen in comparison to the PS3, specifically, or previous, more exotic architectures before that. I doubt the Xbox One is all that closer to a PC than the 360 was.   The PS3 had this weird ""cell"" architecture that required a ton of parallel processing to take advantage of any quite little RAM even for its time. Before the PS3, earlier console generations also tended to have very closed-in architectures that were optimized for certain game-related tasks (mostly graphics) but thus also very different from ""general purpose"" PC architecture. I think both of the new consoles have unified RAM (between GPU and CPU) which is something still not really happening on PC.  PCs are always more difficult to program for, for the same reason they're more open. There's no real standards, at least none that can be enforced universally, you have AMD cards, you have Nvidia cards, you have different operating system and driver versions, programs running in the background, different monitors… You essentially have an infinite amount of combinations a potential player could have set up, it's almost impossible to optimize for all of them.  For consoles, on the other hand, both in this generation and previous, it is possible to optimize down to a very stable platform from hardware to software. That doesn't necessarily mean they are optimized, but if Naughty Dog's stuff looks like half a generation ahead on hardware that technically is a generation behind PC, that's because they know how to optimize for very, very specific hardware. Even if the PS4 was literally just a PC with Sony's operating system on it (it isn't, it's still quite unique), you'd only have to optimize for one PC rather than gazillions of different setups, it would still be easier to develop for the console platform."

First of all programming for a console mean that you need to account for a very limited number of hardware combination, codice for pc mean potentially unlimited hardware combinations.  Hardware API, and Development Kit. The API and the kit provided to console programmer allow them to use a good level of abstraction from the architecture without the need to worry about a good number of stuff. on the PC (that is not a game only machine ) you need to code the same stuff the harder way to make it work.  Software: under a console you have his own operating system and that's it. your program will take all the aviable space and the performance will always be stabe. on a pc you need to account for  other softwares running under it and possibly causing a slowdown. on a console you can even code some events forgetting about putting interruptions and they will always run at the same speed. on a pc a more powerful pc will force you to handle the timing yourself.  these are of course only FEW of the reasons why it's so hard to port a game on pc"

The pc port runs just fine if you don't unlock the fps. When you unlock it, the streaming system goes nuts, memory leaks, stutterring, textures loading problems, and so on.  So the point here, the main problem is the core engine not optimized for various pc combinations (Ram/SSD/HDD). If you play the game as it's it will run just fine with the same hardware specs consoles have."

Or if the game is truly complete, with registration card and other inserts. For example a copy of Mega Man X3 from my research goes for 300-800+ USD used based on condition. The boxes really are the biggest cost variable since it is so easy for a twenty year old piece of cardboard to have been damaged over time."
Games,3e0p8a,badsectoracula,2,Tue Jul 21 17:52:05 2015 UTC,"Is there really such a value? A few months ago i wanted to play Gungrave, a PS2 game, and couldn't make it work with any emulator, so i checked in ebay and found a copy there (i just checked and here is one at about 5 GBP which is about $8). I also got a PS2 since i didn't had any around and that was also about $30 (with shipping. There are games on Steam that are more than a year old and still sell more than that.  I've also got a ton of old PC games, mostly from the 90s, and all of them were around $4-$5 each. The only two games i paid more than $10 were Outlaws (and then GOG decided to release it less than a month later :-P) which i got in box (although it was a reprint) and Take No Prisoners that not only nobody seemed to have, but also was released in several languages and i wanted the English one. Even for that the price wasn't really high, but the guy selling it didn't want to send it outside of UK (even though i told him i was going to pay him extra money for that and gave him instructions on how to use a shipping company i had already used at the past) and had to go through a 3rd party.  EDIT: although TBH i can see ""perfect"" (or close to it) condition games to be priced high for collectors. Personally i mostly just want to have the games around in their original (or close to original) form, so i don't mind much of the game box's state as long as the disc is fine and i only care for physical packages for games i cannot find digitally. For example i've bought Raven's MageSlayer in only CD form (yes it was original :-P) and i don't mind that the Outlaws box is a reprint, but i'm sure that a collector would prefer the original boxes in good condition with all manuals, etc included."

Rule of Rose for PS2 for example is one of the last games I am looking for and tends to sell for over 150 USD, the .Hack games as well, I have seen some of them list for over 100 USD at times. Newer generations of games were less likely to be lost or damaged since they were packaged in plastic cases and not as much time has passed, so value on them is just supply and demand, smaller print runs tend to be the reason for higher value as is often the case with more niche titles."

This is something that, in previous games and any other fighting game that I know of, would be real money only.

All you have is a bunch of licenses. Software that you pay for is always being sold to you as some form of limited licensing agreement. If you were buying ownership of the software, then you would take over the authority to sell it to others and the right to sue anyone who distributes or obtains unauthorized copies."

Games,3drwm1,klapaucius,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:39:18 2015 UTC,"So does this mean that I don't own anything that I don't make myself?   When it comes to intellectual property: yeah, pretty much. You could also buy the IP rights from whoever made it, but buying a tangible good that utilizes that IP doesn't give you the rights to the IP itself.   Brand labels are slightly different from copyright - trademark / trade dress protection is a bit less absolute in some ways. Protection is generally limited to cases where the unauthorized use is likely to cause confusion or appears to be an attempt by a third party to 'cash in' on the consumer trust and goodwill that the original rights holder expended time and money to earn. Copyright law is based on the idea that the author of a creative work should both get to reap the monetary rewards generated by said work and protect the artistic integrity of the work, while trademark law is only concerned with the financial side of things and is ultimately designed for the benefit of consumers.   If I buy a piece of clothing with a brand label, I can't start selling clothing with that brand's label or sue anyone for making bootleg versions of it. If I buy a Taco Bell taco, that doesn't make me a Taco Bell franchise. So do I not own that clothing or food?   You own the clothing and the food. What you don't own is intangible and abstract: the intellectual property rights to whatever image is printed on that clothing, and the rights to use the Taco Bell name and logo to sell tacos or other goods that are confusingly similar to the products Taco Bell sells. There's a legal rule called the first sale doctrine which prevents the copyright holder from micromanaging how you use that t-shirt after selling it to you. You're allowed to sell it, give it away, display it in public, destroy it - pretty much the only thing you're still not allowed to do is make unauthorized copies of the protected artwork.   However, the first sale doctrine does not apply to software licenses. It protects your right to resell or give away a physical disc with software on it, but it doesn't prohibit the developer/publisher from taking measures to prevent that second owner from being able to use the software. They can't sue the buyer for having an unauthorized copy of the software, but they can use something like a one-use-only license key (or whatever form of DRM they prefer) to prevent that second buyer from being able to make any actual use of the software in practice. And, thanks to the DMCA, it's a criminal offense to attempt to circumvent that DRM."

Games,3drwm1,MrStruggleSnuggle,2,Sun Jul 19 09:19:52 2015 UTC,"Depends what you mean by ""count as."" Legally speaking, the way intellectual property works is that there is only ever one single owner. To own a piece of software means to have the right to decide who is allowed to use it and how. It is, by definition, exclusive; if I own something, that necessarily means that you do not own that thing. If we both buy copies of the same game, we each own our respective game discs; we each have the legal right to exclude the other from using the disc that we purchased. But neither of us has any right to prohibit the other, or anyone else for that matter, from playing their own copy of the same game software. The publisher is the one with the right to decide who is not allowed to use the software, which is why they get to charge for copies of the game and sue people for making unauthorized copies.   That's not to say you have no rights related to that software you bought, of course. You have a license to use the software, with certain restrictions on the nature of that use. However, the right to make use of a thing is just one of the many rights that, collectively, are known as ownership. You don't have the rest of those rights - the publisher retains those."

Games,3drwm1,AirPhforce,2,Sun Jul 19 09:18:48 2015 UTC,"Exactly - and this is why virtual reality is going to bring back arcades. The average Joe is gonna try VR and be so blown away they'll buy a Vive or a Rift, but they're not gonna buy a $10,000 cockpit simulator that makes you feel the G-forces of your spacecraft. But they sure as hell will pay $2 per game to ""rent"" one."
Games,3drwm1,Pufflekun,6,Sun Jul 19 09:52:46 2015 UTC,"It's not, it's really not. I have serious doubts whether VR is going to actually take off at home, but if you believe that it's going to revitalise the arcade market then I have a nice bridge I can sell you.  Anyone who runs or works in an arcade knows that there's several types of games that consistently do poorly in arcades. Machines that are:   Single player Take up too  much floorspace Closed-cabinet, or hard for people to look over the player's shoulder to watch Priced too expensively, folks would rather spend £1 to play air hockey with a friend than £2 to play a single player game   VR games are all of these, along with a few more issues with them. A cockpit simulator designed for a single player would take up more floor space than pretty much any other machine, even non-interactive rollercoaster simulators, built for two.  And that's the key thing: Pretty much every game in an arcade has to be a two-player experience. We have one single-player game (Mach Storm, and it's the only one we actually advertise with standing banners in the entry hallway) and it has the lowest earnings of any machine in the building. Unless it's a claw or prize machine, if your machine isn't multiplayer it's going to tank badly in takings. I'm not discounting that multiplayer VR games can't exist, but then you're just making the problem worse: An arcade owner has to decide whether it wants two one-player VR machines linked together or two two-player arcade machines. A four-player VR setup would take up more room than machines that can be sold to eight people.  So a VR machine is already at a disadvantage due to a single player cabinet taking up more floorspace than pretty much any two-player machine. What else is wrong? Well, the third point: It lacks the gawker factor. If someone is playing a game, his friends can't stand at his shoulder and watch it happen, passers-by can't look at the screen and watch what the game is like. Arcade machines make money by being flashy and appealing compared to their neighbours. The lone machine where the fat nerd drops in £5 to put a headset over their head to do... God know what isn't at all appealing. Sure, you could always mirror the display on a big monitor, but aside from the additional processing cost of it you may as well just have a standard arcade machine instead.  As an aside, this is the biggest reason why I think home VR is going to fail. There's the idea that video gaming is an insular and unsocial activity, and VR... is just going to make it ten times worse. Pretty much every parent of a gamer complains to their friends that their child spends all his time in his room playing games, partners and spouses can feel like they're second-best to their boyfriend or husband's Xbox. Now we have a gaming system where the player just puts a headset over their face and completely ignores everything around them for hours at a time. Your parent or partner or spouse is just going to love that, especially if you make the mistake of telling them how much it cost to buy the unit or why you had to buy two because of game exclusivity. Anybody who thinks that using VR is a good idea clearly hasn't read the literature that spawned the concept, namely Neuromancer and Snow Crash. A big pervading concept through both stories is that spending too much time ""plugged in"" is a bad thing, and when Hiro goes full Gargoyle in the early final third of Snow Crash it's treated like someone who's developed a harmful addiction and doesn't quite realise it yet.  Gibson and Stephenson both pretty much invented VR, and they both think it's a bad idea.  But I digress. VR arcade games already have three strikes against them, and there are plenty more. For instance... $2 to play a VR game? Nope.  Converting to GBP and rounding down because that's what I'm familiar with, $2 is roughly equivalent to £1 (£1.28, but let's keep prices down to single units for ease). How much would £1 get you in my arcade?  Well, a go on an air hockey table. Air hockey tables are among our biggest earners, funnily enough, because they have a sense of competition. It wouldn't put you on our Pac-Man Smash table, which is £2 a play. £1 is worth a credit on pretty much everything else we have, but again nobody plays our GRID, Time Crisis 4, or motorbike racing games by themselves so unless two or more friends want to play them together they're just occupying floor space. It wouldn't get you on our Typhoon rollercoaster simulator, which is £4 for two players. Or our Mach Storm (the plastic panels are actually darker and make watching the screen from the outside more difficult in reality) which is £2 for one player.  Realistically, a single credit on a VR machine is likely to cost anywhere between £4 and £5, so between $6 and $8; and this price point is likely to kill off any interest an owner is likely to have in a unit. Going back to what I said about floorspace earlier, there are so many more better-earning machines an arcade could put in the space of a single VR unit. Sure, someone who may run an arcade may rent one for a few weeks to get some crazy new-fad honeymoon period cash in, which will trickle over onto earnings at other machines. But any business that keeps a VR machine for longer than it takes for the unit to get visibly scratched is basically keeping a money pit open and uncovered in their arcade.  And speaking of damage, that's another thing. All arcade machines with moving parts require a lot of maintenance to remain running. Your cockpit simulator is likely to be an absolute clusterfuck of moving parts which will require engineers to repair when anything goes wrong, but again that's something most arcades budget to deal with. The air hockey tables and Typhoon may be our biggest earners, but they also require the most engineer attention (and our engineers are an off-site company, so we have to wait for one to come to us for any work to be done). What's behind those two on the maintenance list? Mach Storm, which has been considered as running at a loss since pretty much the day we had it. But Namco really wants us to keep the machine. Any VR machine will also likely be running at a loss; the maintenance overheads would be higher, and I guarantee the headset will be broken more times than anything else on the arcade floor: It's hard to get customers to treat seemingly-rugged-yet-still-prone-to-breaking peripherals like light guns with proper care and attention: It's actually easier to holster a Time Crisis gun than it is to drop it on the floor, and yet people still do it all the time. When we had Guitar Hero Arcade I was constantly picking up both controllers off the floor because customers don't care.  A VR headset wouldn't last a week in those condition. So either you have the headset mounted on a semi-flex support that can still be bashed around, or you have it on a fixed mounting that would make the idea of a fully mobile cockpit simulator impracticable. Or, and this is the most simple solution, you have any VR machines manned by a member of staff who handles putting people in and out of the machines without causing too much damage to the delicate hardware. Guess what that does? Drives up the price to about $10 a credit. So a player has a choice: Either play five games (often with friends) with their ten dollars of quarters, or one single game by themselves.  VR probably is not going to be the home gaming revolution Reddit makes it out to be. There's too many issues and red flags that nobody seems willing to mention out of fear of downvotes. It may happen, but I'm doubtful.  However, it'll never work in arcades. Anyone who believes otherwise clearly has never had to consider just how much work it takes to keep an arcade running and in the black, or is either young enough or has a short enough memory to not realize that pretty much every problem I've listed above were the same problems that killed off VR in arcades during the 90's and that have still not been resolved in the 20 years since."

There's plenty of single people and people with self control that would use it. And even if it's not ideal for children, parents, are couples that doesn't mean they aren't going to partake in it."
Games,3drwm1,Rumpelblumpkins,13,Sun Jul 19 10:05:41 2015 UTC,Arcades are for atmosphere and community. Especially for fighting games.
Games,3drwm1,MrMulligan,7,Mon Jul 20 03:50:16 2015 UTC,The thing is people are willing to pay for arcades for the same reason they're willing to pay bar prices for drinks. It's not about the drinks it's about the setting. Arcades were as much the social aspect as the game itself. Meeting your friends at the arcade after school was an event. Dumping cash into clash of clans doesn't have that social aspect.

Games,3drwm1,Gentlemoth,2,Sun Jul 19 03:45:20 2015 UTC,"My line of thinking is that arcades were a social experience, like going to a restaurant or theme park, so paying for constant entry was more digestible than bringing a game home."
Games,3drwm1,Crankthulu,2,Sun Jul 19 02:57:50 2015 UTC,"I think with arcades people lament the arcade scene more than its business model. I mean, playing with some random name over the Internet just isn't the same as playing with someone who's right there and probably lives in your area, giving you a reason to care about forming a bond, positive or negative, with them."
Games,3drwm1,Gamiac,2,Sun Jul 19 05:34:39 2015 UTC,"Yea for me it was always just being in the arcade with other people. For better or worse, it's how I formed a bond with the people in my own area and learned about my own skill level.   Thankfully there are places that are capturing that experience for fighting game fans. Local tournaments are the new arcades. In my area there is usually a weekly event for Smash, Street Fighter and other games. They usually have big turn outs and it's like the early Arcade years."
Games,3drwm1,SparkyPantsMcGee,5,Sun Jul 19 06:15:19 2015 UTC,"Most people miss arcades because it was a unique social setting. Arcades still thrive in Japan and for that reason the Japanese SF scene dominates over other nations, because the scene is ""closely-knit"". Anyone who wants to improve in Japan could literally go to an establishment designed to give you dozens of opponents to play against in person at any given moment."

Games,3drwm1,bruwin,32,Sun Jul 19 00:24:51 2015 UTC,I don't know how else they were supposed to do it. They want to add 4 new characters/patch the game. How else? Send out an update that auto-downloads next time they logon to the internet?
Games,3drwm1,AirPhforce,23,Sun Jul 19 01:19:11 2015 UTC,"All those updates were gold though. The initial cast was increased from 8 characters, up to 16, and the super combo system was introduced. While the home versions (and international versions) had funky parity issues, the main arcade game followed a pretty logical progression. Not to mention, since it's a fighting game, the characters ARE the game. Going from 8 characters to 16 is literally doubling the amount of game there is. Not to mention, ST allowing you to pick the ""old"" versions of characters, and there was a TON added in each version.  Basically it's really disingenuous to call it ""the same game."" Particularly with Street Fighter 2."
Games,3drwm1,AirPhforce,18,Sun Jul 19 01:47:47 2015 UTC,"Except SF2WW->SF2CE was 4 characters. That were already in the game; the bosses were now just playable.

SSF2Turbo had 1 new character.  I'm not even going to go into further versions of the game."

That was a big deal at the time, but it was a pretty massive gouge, money-wise in hindsight.   It also advertised being able to play as the 'same character' as a feature. This was the dark ages, remember. I legit remember this coming out as a kid and freaking out because 'bosses' were playable, which was like this crazy new concept that you could just 'play' as the last boss and he wasn't super godlike he was just another character so it was fair. I think it was a good version.  Super had 4 new characters.   ST added 'old' characters and the super combo gauge. It was also pretty great and people still play this one, so it's safe to say it was also a worthy upgrade.   While I don't exactly know why I'm arguing about value being added to an arcade game that came out 20 odd years ago, I think the upgrades were fine."
Games,3drwm1,AirPhforce,2,Sun Jul 19 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"But in order to get the upgrade each time, you were spending $60. So if you were fool enough to buy SF2 when it came out and excited enough to get every incremental upgrade, you spent $240 on, essentially, one video game.  In contrast, SFIV had as hefty an improvement and only cost $120 total if you do it similarly. And now SFV, they finally decided to figure out to not do that shit."

One of the nice things about SF is the stability as years pass w/o updates. Shit goes from godlike to never used just because people figure it out.

It all hinges on how this in-game currency is earned and the price of the characters.  Honestly, I'm bummed about there being a roster of only 16 playable characters.  Street Fighter 4 started with 25 characters and it's sad to see that both Mortal Kombat and now Street Fighter have regressed in terms of initial rosters.  That's not to say a fighting game with few characters can't be good, the original Blazblu only had 12 characters but the cast was extremely varied and the game was fun as a result.  Street Fighter is different though, there's a small army of characters to fill a roster and I know with only 16 to choose from: there's gonna be some cuts that hurt.  Some of my favorites will be gone...  Still though, game looks like a phenomenal fighter.  I'm just going to wait patiently and cross my fingers for Sagat."

Games,3drwm1,ItinerantSoldier,2,Sat Jul 18 23:45:31 2015 UTC,Grinding in a fighting game? I dunno. Maybe. It happens all the time anyway if enough currency is earned through multiplayer. If it requires single player that could be iffy as hell though. The computer already cheats enough as is.
Games,3drwm1,RockLoi,3,Sun Jul 19 02:26:51 2015 UTC,I'd be extremely surprised if you required single player to unlock coins. I could see them restricting local play (else you could open yourself to people putting rubber bands on controllers and leaving it on all night) but they could make that work if it's tied in to your post match scores.

Games,3drwm1,Dante2k4,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:35:16 2015 UTC,"Well.... okay. My only gripe with this kind of system is that it can sway the design so as to make unlocking these things without money take longer than it would have if a real money option wasn't there, but... really, I'm gonna play the unholy fuck out of this game, so I'm okay with it on a personal level.  In general, it's kinda iffy, but definitely not the worst system out there. Well, I guess that depends on how grindy they make it, so I suppose we'll see!"
Games,3drwm1,RockLoi,3,Sat Jul 18 21:36:11 2015 UTC,"Well it's only the post launch content, so what happens is instead of a Super Street Fighter V being released you get a free patch with all of the balance changes and then can use fight money/cash to unlock the other content like characters etc.  If the price of purchasing all of the unlocks is comparable to the previous SF rereleases then it's definitively better, and depending how long it is between this content if you play for several months you should essentially get this content for free - rewarding the regular players.  The thing to note is that serious fighter fans will play it all the time, so if you don't have enough in game currency when content comes out because you played it a month or two after launch then you're not the kind of player they're trying to reward."

You could grind for 9 hours a day non stop for 25 days to get 1 fighter, or for a simple micro transaction of 3.99$ you get it instantly.

It could even be something fairly benign that causes bugs, e.g. a game needing access to your data connection so that it can update leaderboards etc. Second, the business model of most free apps gets its legs cut off if you can simply block the permission required to fetch ads when you install it."

You may have seen my Producer letter recently, http://sf.my.com/us/news/announcements/skyforge-producers-letter-welcome-early-access . I was made aware of this post and wanted to come in and comment.   First, I totally get where many of you are coming from on this peer to peer and the My.com client starting when Windows does thing. What many of you are saying makes sense. I can't guarantee changes or when they will come, but I will say that this is something I personally am going to discuss with our team and developers to solve. At the very least I would like some sort of option or check box when you are installing that allows you to indicate if it will start when Windows does (you can turn it off in the settings in the meantime). For the peer to peer downloading, you do need it to download the game/patches but we can discuss some other way to notify players that you can change the settings for this and saving the patch files. The main thing is making sure we are transparent on this.   Second, there seems to be separate conversations here about p2w, monetization, and past comments/statements by Skyforge NA/EU team members. I am going to leave the p2w/monetization discussions to their separate posts for now. Past comments by some team members about using p2w on the forums old news at this point and the one in particular was properly rescinded after by that team member. We want to know your opinions. We read them and discuss them multiple times a day. Your opinions matter to us.   I want us to continue to have an open dialogue and look forward to clearing up moments of confusion, answering questions, fixing issues, and more with you the community.   Thank you,  Aaron aka ""Legatus"""
Games,3ds68c,babybigger,3,Sun Jul 19 05:26:38 2015 UTC,"EDIT: See their reply below. This is a good response from the company.    This is a pretty good PR response from the company, with some good and bad in it.    The good is obvious: they said they will discuss and would like to fix this.    The bad: They did not say they actually would fix this.  Maybe within a few days they will say they actually will fix it. I hope so.    Let's look at some possible outcomes:     They talk about this (as he said they would) and talk to My.com. For some reason, they decide not to change the launcher.  For example, My.com says they do not to change the launcher just for Skyforge. Looking at this post, I can see Allods Team and My.com not actually fixing this. This is certainly the easiest and cheapest solution for them. It seems possible to me this would happen. The result: Many thousands of people download the game to try it. Hundreds of players with data caps over the next few years get screwed over.   They talk about this and it takes a few weeks to code, test, and release a fix. The result: Thousands of people download the game in the next 2 weeks. Many people who have data caps get screwed over. This seems the most likely outcome. Not a good outcome for all of those players though.   They code, patch and fix this very quickly, early this week. The result: After a few days, no players will be screwed over by the launcher.  It seems pretty unlikely they will fix this  immediately, especially since it is My.com's launcher.   Obviously, we don't know what Allods Team will do on this. Maybe they will fix it right away. We'll see. This statement by Aaron was reasonable. But since it will likely be several weeks before a fix is designed, coded and launched, I have a request:    Put on your website, on the download page, a warning to players with bandwidth caps, telling them that they can turn off the p2p sharing.    This is easy to do, and costs very little. But there will be strong resistance from some staff to doing this. It is much easier to be silent about the problem, and not tell players. But, honestly, this is the only ethical thing to do if they are not going to fix this within the next week."

Games,3ds68c,ProbeIke,18,Sun Jul 19 02:21:36 2015 UTC,"Most games are not nearly as bad as you think. Starcraft 2 for instance barely eats 100MB in 4-6 hours. Heroes of the Storm eats about 25-30MB an hour, Diablo 3 is the big culrpit at about 60 MB an hour.  Some games ive had to stop playing, but their mostly un-optimized, badly netcoded Early Access games like Space Engineers, which used almost 150 MB in an hour. I dont play any MMOs anymore, so I dont know how much bandwidth they eat.  Bigger problems are that Mic chat just doesnt happen anymore. You cant accurately track bandwidth usage. ive been in mic chats where ive used upwards of 50-60MB an hour and if your playing a game while doing that, thats double the bandwidth loss.  The real problem is DOWNLOADING games. Steam has become my biggest enemy. I recently got Arkham Knight and was basically scammed by Rocksteady (only 7GB installs from the disc). I take my laptop to the library to download most games but anything 15GB + just cant be done using a library connection, especially using Steams shit downloader.  Honestly, gaming isnt the problem I thought it would be living out in the countryside. Watching Youtube/Netflix and Downloading stuff is basically a no-go, but you get used to bandwidth tracking. Also helps I work a lot so any days I dont game can be tacked onto other games. My normal ration is 650 MB / day, leaving me 2GB at the end of the moth for updates."

Games,3ds68c,TheWheeledOne,2,Sun Jul 19 02:39:13 2015 UTC,"I would shy away from giving anything to seeders aside from cosmetics honestly. Giving people extra in game money for seeding is basically the same as letting them buy that currency with real money, but so many games do this now that I guess it's silly to expect such restraint with regards to monetization."
Games,3ds68c,Utipod,3,Sun Jul 19 05:31:29 2015 UTC,"If the developers are providing a commercial-scale MMO with the same servers hosting downloading, login, and the game proper, then they're already doing it wrong. No amount of offloading the traffic will help.  That said, I highly doubt that this is the case with them. They don't do it to ease load on the server; they do it to reduce their total bandwidth costs. Its a money thing, nothing more."
Games,3ds68c,TheWheeledOne,6,Sun Jul 19 01:13:06 2015 UTC,"They don't do it to ease load on the server; they do it to reduce their total bandwidth costs.   Just for the record, the two aren't mutually exclusive - easing server loads means you can get by with fewer/cheaper servers."
Games,3ds68c,Utipod,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:56:27 2015 UTC,"Not always; it depends how many they've deployed in the first place or if they are using a cloud service like a CDN. If it's in a CDN, your costs are going to be 100% bandwidth.  The equation has changed in the last few years."
Games,3ds68c,TheWheeledOne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:10:12 2015 UTC,"This is true (that's how Reddit works!), but for a large gaming company like the one that owns WoT and several other multiplayer games, I think it's unlikely they're using a CDN. They almost certainly have their own dedicated servers."
Games,3ds68c,Utipod,3,Sun Jul 19 06:15:30 2015 UTC,There's tons of ready-made for use as-a-service CDN's -- Akamai for example. Even Amazon and Rackspace provide ready made access to CDN's.  Your line of thinking is out of date by about 3 years.
Games,3ds68c,LeSpiceWeasel,2,Sun Jul 19 06:19:25 2015 UTC,"Except they do have their own servers and they've been around for a while, so what you're suggesting is they shut down their current centers and switched to a CDN, which isn't a small task.

Games,3ds68c,AticusCaticus,3,Sun Jul 19 03:43:53 2015 UTC,"Wouldnt it be best to keep the limit boxes checked   Yes, it would be advisable to do that.   Most people don't understand that your upload and download bandwidth are linked in a way; saturate your upload to 100% and your download rates will tank.   TCP is an error-correcting protocol. If packets go missing between HERE and THERE, your system can request the missing bits instead of having to redownload an entire file or transmission. To do that, TCP relies on ""ACKs"" - acknowledgements - that are sent out periodically during a transfer. Get a handful of frames in, send an ACK back saying everything's okay. Get another handful, send a retransmit request for part of the missing sequence.   It happens fast, but it must happen for transfers to work. No upstream bandwidth available means you have no overhead to send ACKs out to whoever you're downloading from. No ACK means they'll sit idle 'til you check in (or 'til your connection closes). This is why kids who've freshly installed Torrent software and left the uploads unlimited find they can't even surf the web when they're seeding something, even if they have lots of available download bandwidth from their provider."
Games,3ds68c,Folseit,19,Sun Jul 19 18:05:11 2015 UTC,"God, I hate this sort of thing so damn much. Is it really too much to prompt people upon installation or the first time they run the launcher?

In every single context, no matter how much of a joke or an analysis it was. Their last game (Allods Online) got ruined by p2w. It looked cool at first but after a while they put in HEAVY p2w stuff like mounts which only work if you ""feed"" them with some kind of food which is only attainable with real money.   Really if your looking for a great MMO with the same ""specs"" like this game get Guild Wars 2. Its on sale often for 10 bucks and it is one hell of a MMO, arguably the best one ever made.  Edit: A lot of people seem to disagree with me that GW2 is one of the best MMOs of all time. Though I still think it is one of the best ones because who else is there? WoW has fucked up reaaaaaal bad with the last expansion and the low amount of patches causing it to be meh at best.(also expensive)  FF14 seems interesting though and because I dont know much about the game im not gonna comment.  Wildstar has been a huge letdown  ESO, SWTOR, ArcheAge, Tera and Rift are all great games but dont even come near GW2s popularity.  So despite very big flaws in GW2 I still think it is EASILY top 3 and ARGUABLY the best MMO."

If you don't want to read the whole thing $188.25 for the minimum to compete.  $3243.40 to buy the maximum level of power.  And it's literally just buying extra stats for your character.  That doesn't even cover all the other price gouging aspects of the game, like making the game basically unplayable for hours after dying (you got a huge stat penalty) unless you paid real money."

Allods Team is the same team that put huge disadvantages to non-payers in the form of effects that would make your character weaker on death, forcing you to go into the cash shop to buy a decursing item if you wanted to continue to play. Or you had to wait.  This is the exact same shit that happened in Allods Online, a big block on getting to move forward for anyone not paying, and anyone paying got to actually enjoy their experience. This entire thing disgusts me in the worst of ways. Hopefully now people see that Allods Team is nothing but a greed machine that wants to find any way they can to make your wallet open up.

Trammel certainly didn't help but at the same time it also increased the player base total. Age of Shadows is the expansion that completely changed the focus of the game by making your character's power item-based. I started the game when Renaissance came out so I really don't have a lot of experience with pre-Trammel but I do agree it was better and the game would have been perfect during the publishes right before Renaissance came out.

Games,3ds68c,outofcrapnames,2,Sun Jul 19 07:10:28 2015 UTC,"I'm worried about a NA release. I'm worried they will change the game drastically to appeal more to a NA market, and I am very opposed to this with what I have seen so far in the game.  It's grindy, but it's still fun. There are a lot of things in the game that seem new to me like buying property in town, using workers to gather materials and things like that. Crafting and ownership etc seems so much different than in other games. Then there's the trading system too which is cool, mounts, taming and breeding horses and stuff.  The combat is complex and fun and I just think for some reason they will try to change a bunch of stuff and just fuck it up for NA market. If that happens I'll just keep VPN'ing and playing the Japanese version."
Games,3ds68c,terefor,2,Sun Jul 19 14:39:27 2015 UTC,"I had the same feeling, the cities were big, there are lots of classes, the game tried not to be very grindy, but I got bored after a few hours. The game just never changes, move to this quest area and kill or dig some holes or heal some soldiers, then repeat hundreds of times. The classes also seemed all the same: they had healing, range, melee, burst, damage over time, etc."

Everyone has some kind of healing, damage dealing, tanking ability more or less.  Also, I absolute hate MMOs where you never get the sense of being strong. Going back to lvl10 areas and you get downleveled. Great, so why am I even leveling at all. And then the lack of gear farming. Then what do I do? I can join PvP and get upleveled to 80 right away."
Games,3ds68c,nullstorm0,2,Sun Jul 19 20:08:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, Guild Wars 2 seemed to simplify everything too much with the classes and levels.

Games,3ds68c,Acterian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:09:13 2015 UTC,"That's close to the problem.  Really, GW2 has an amazing combat system, but all of the content is so easy there's no point in using it.  There's plenty of ways to build a great healer, support, crowd control, even tank once the expansion comes- but all of the fights are so easy that doing anything but full damage is pointless and a waste of time.  The good news is, the devs seem to realize it.  One of their lead developers has been talking a lot recently about how the new content in the expansion should give you reason to use the rest of the system- I was disappointed enough by the current game that I'm probably not going to preorder, but I'm watching closely to see if they get it right this time.  Your concerns in the second paragraph probably won't change though.  Mostly because they're not necessarily problems- those are far more subjective than the combat system not even being used.  They want to keep everything at least a little relevant, and for players to reach maximum power quickly with cosmetics (and Masteries, in the expansion) as long-term goals.  Many (including myself) like it, others don't."

It's not so different from what most games that have expansions do.  And honestly good for the game overall.  Whether the expansion is worth $50 or not is an open question."
Games,3ds68c,Makorus,12,Sun Jul 19 02:17:17 2015 UTC,"The problem was in the months leading up to them opening up pre-orders, they flat-out said you'd need the base game to play the expansion, and put it on sale frequently. So all the people who picked it up just for the sale, with the intent of waiting until the expansion anyway, got fucked.  Thankfully they seem to be a decent job of fixing that fuck up with refunds and such, but still. There's more issues there than just justifying the price tag."

I'm the North American Community Manager for Skyforge and I thought I'd step in here just to clarify a few things regarding your comment:   While I personally wouldn't go so far as to say the current issue with the launcher constitutes fraud, we do agree the current P2P system should have its settings tweaked to not use as much bandwidth out the gate. This is something we will be looking into once we return to the office on Monday. Unfortunately this is not true. As with most Free-to-Play games, the discussion of P2W is always present, whether the game be considered P2W or not. When players join a new F2P game many of them often go to the forum to see and inquire about whether the game could be considered P2W. We have never banned anyone for talking about P2W in any context and will never do so.  If you were to visit our forums now you will find plenty of discussions which touch on Skyforge's Free-to-Play monetization and whether it could be considered ""P2W"".     With Skyforge, Allods Team has worked hard to ensure everything in the game, be it related to gameplay or cosmetic, is readily accessible to all players, paying or free. There is no paying for power in Skyforge.  I hope this helps clear up a few things and I'd be happy to answer any other questions in the meantime!

One of the challenges of developing a ""free to play"" is addressing the demands of each party. Once you've formalized and implemented a plan, however, you're still not done.  You often have to communicate with your members and explain the underlying mechanisms of your design – and doing so usually dissipates most concerns and leads to better feedback from players. Over time, both the developers and players grow a better understanding of sustainable commercial practices.  However, these days it's no longer possible since too many people are prone to pasting the term P2W onto pretty much every situation. This behavior is extremely harmful, in the sense that it damages the image of a game before it has even had a chance to reach to its community. One must trust the developers' vision.  It also weakens the dialog between the community and the developers of the game they play.  For these reasons, we will strive to provide answers to our members in need of details regarding our monetization - but in turn, we won't tolerate the word P2W as of today, nor tolerate oversimplification of monetization in topics.  Members participating in the forum this early in the game project ought to allow its community to grow with a sense of responsibility and communication practices that don't undermine their relationship with the skyforge team.  We'll still ask you to respect our rules out of respect for the community that will establish here and align with the developers' views.

Along those lines, I strongly recommend people investigate something like rainmeter for that quick overview. There are some out of the box features that will allow you to monitor your upload and download rates in desktop widgets.  If see unusual activity, take the next step - pop open an admin command prompt on your system and run something like netstat -nbo | more.  that will dump a list of every socket active on your system with the source and destination addresses, a state code (TIME_WAIT means it's idle/doing nothing; ESTABLISHED was freshly used; SYN_SENT, LAST_ACK and similar are active transfers), and lastly, you'll get the PID and .exe name of whatever owns the socket.   An example might look like this:   TCP    192.168.1.104:60799    222.161.250.160:61286  SYN_SENT        2836 [uTorrent.exe]   Take some time to learn what your system looks like during idle times and during normal usage. Get a feel for what your benchmark CPU, RAM, and network stats look like. Understand what apps live in the background, and get to know what they're up to.  Then when your usage takes an unusual spike, you can glance at a list of procs and say ""hm, that's new and/or different"" - you'll be well along to figuring out what's chewing up your connection."

I haven't tried gaming with it but I've streamed youtube from my laptop and phone and it worked pretty well. I haven't really used it much though because I can already watch youtube, netflix, etc. from my xbox. The only extra features it needs to be good for game streaming is the ability to only need to connect from the xbox, right now you need to go through the settings on your phone or pc like regular miracast. The other feature needs to let you control the windows pc with your controller, or your smartphone.  EDIT: if you are a good DYI person then you might be able to get it to work if you have a wireless controller that works for your PC from a different room and get an app that lets you control your PC from your phone.

Or, you could play your PC copies of multiplatform games, which are almost universally better than their console counterparts, but then MS doesn't get the royalties from the X1 copy being sold and the incentive of getting a Live subscription diminishes because you wouldn't be using MS' servers to play multiplayer.

The system has the ability to detect if you're missing a kinect, so it can just block games that require it, or give proper warning messages that the game is not supported.  With PC to XB1, well not every PC game has xinput support. There are tens of thousands of games available for PC and it is hard to really nail down which ones would work well for streaming to the XB1, or even how to adequately import all your games into the windows xbox app. Manually adding each individual steam game to your xbox list would be tiresome and ultimately frustrating if half of them didn't even work. Currently the Xbox Apps system for adding games can't even find games from Steam, Origin or Battle.Net  and there is no option to manually search for them."

The XB1 currently has no M+KB support. If you get stuck on a menu that doesn't support controllers, the game ends there.  Edit: Steam has over 1000 games in the ""Partial Controller Support"" category. The XB1 will have problems with that."

Games,3dro02,SwineHerald,3,Sun Jul 19 01:17:55 2015 UTC,"With Steam's Big Picture Mode, it tells you which games does allow you to use a controller.   Not exactly.  It tells you which games have been marked by their developers as having ""Full Controller Support."" That isn't the same as actually telling you which games you could play to completion without ever touching a keyboard. There are games that Big Picture will list as Keyboard games, but still have decent enough controller support to play to completion: Watch_Dogs being one I've recently played, Big Picture labels it with the keyboard icon yet I played it all from my couch.  At the same time that category also includes a number of unity games which involve the default, unskippable unity launcher, which can't be bypassed with a controller. Sure the game can be played 100% with the controller once you're in the game but you'll need a mouse or keyboard to get that far.  Even then, all that information is based on the games Steam data, which doesn't really help when the Win10 Xbox app doesn't interface with Steam at all. At the moment it won't even allow you to add Steam games to your ""game list"" so you can't use the existing features it provides, such as recording video. Even then, if you could add those games to your app, and it did allow streaming to the XB1, MS has no existing database at their disposal about what games actually support controllers."

At the same time that category also includes a number of unity games which involve the default, unskippable unity launcher   Uplay, not Unity, but I understand what you mean.

Even then, if you could add those games to your app, and it did allow streaming to the XB1, MS has no existing database at their disposal about what games actually support controllers.   I agree that it will be very difficult for Microsoft to get a PC to Xbox streaming service like Steam Stream or Nvidia's Gamestream.

The Uplay launcher is suprisingly well equipped for navigation with controllers, so long as you're set to automatically log in. Even if your game doesn't launch properly, or crashes, it'll usually drop you back to the games Uplay page with an ""A"" Button prompt to restart the game.  The default launcher for games running on the Unity engine isn't so friendly with controllers. A lot of smaller games exclude internal options menus and instead just rely on the default launcher to handle all of that.

Games,3dz23j,TorteDeLini,2,Mon Jul 20 18:15:14 2015 UTC,"I understand the appeal of lessening execution, but one of the things that makes top level play exciting is that there is an absurd amount of execution on top of the strategy.  It's like competitive RTS.  The ability to balance execution with strategy and tactics is a key component of high level play, and more often than not this is what separates a high level player (The guy who just executes other peoples strategies) and a top player. (The guy who makes his own strategies and then practices executing them.)  I'll try it out, but honestly I prefer a little bit of execution.  I liked how Persona 4 Ultimax handles it, there's still execution but it's also  not ridiculous to learn.  Moral Kombat X was alright too."
Games,3dz23j,Dullahan3470,3,Mon Jul 20 18:57:53 2015 UTC,"I would like to imagine that high level RTS play would be significantly more impressive had ""thought to input"" latency due to UI flaws be nearly eliminated.    Stating that the interface should be part of the challenge is like stating leg races should be done on the beach shore.  Sure it can be considered impressive, but I just want to see who runs fastest on ideal turf."
Games,3dz23j,sadicious,2,Mon Jul 20 20:26:47 2015 UTC,"People always say this and I think it's total bullshit.  Execution is part of the game.  The whole point of real time strategy is to force execution upon you.  In a turn based games, execution doesn't exist and it is purely a game of strategy.  But in real time you have to react to things as they happen WHILE still managing other things.  If you remove the mechanical execution, you're reducing the game to the reactionary components of the game.  The whole point is that you need to be constantly having your attention torn in different directions and the player most capable of managing more at once is often the better player.    To take your example, people who participate in leg races spend hours optimizing their form and training their body before competing.  That's no different than training your execution in a video game.  You can't compete on the top level until you've mastered technique, and that is true of every sport in the world. (Which is incidentally why Chess is not a sport.)"
Games,3dz23j,Dullahan3470,3,Mon Jul 20 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree execution is part of the game.  It is amazing to see high level players work with the physical limitations of a limited input device AND work with the challenges of the game/sport.    I'm only stating it would also be great to see ""purely a game of strategy"" in real time.  It already exists for turn based after all.  Taking it from another angle, it would be boring to watch a match if the game had a terrible UI.  If the game intentionally required to to press 3x-10x more buttons to execute the same action as expected by the norm, I'm willing to bet fewer players would bother with such a game.    So where is the normal expected execution difficulty?  Where we just so happen to have placed it back in the 90s with ""Wouldn't it be cool if the player half-circled to produce a fireball""?  If execution is so important to the challenge, why allow custom controllers?  Does having a tournament with people only using the Wii controller sound like a good idea?  Why play FIFA when you can just go outside and kick a ball around?  I'm also not talking about things that would classify as a ""sport"" or otherwise.  I'm not even suggesting we remove the physical aspect of the game.  I'm only suggesting that we strive for the perfect user experience in an activity that is virtual and of the mind.  How we would achieve this, I have no idea; I leave that to smarter people than myself."
Games,3dz23j,sadicious,2,Mon Jul 20 22:05:25 2015 UTC,"I totally agree. When someone like Sako or Daigo lands a 25-hit Evil Ryu combo, it's impressive on a technical level and would be much less hype if it was simply a few easy button presses.   Also, I believe having an execution barrier helps prepare players for the commitment that comes with playing the game. If you can't accept having to build up APM or doing complex inputs, then you probably will be less willing to learn the strategy, fundamentals, and other deep strategies that come with these competitive games."
Games,3dz23j,MyBodyIsReddit,0,Mon Jul 20 19:14:20 2015 UTC,"If you can't accept having to build up APM or doing complex inputs, then you probably will be less willing to learn the strategy, fundamentals, and other deep strategies that come with these competitive games.    First i would not equate apm and fighting game inputs.  Apm determines how fast you can input your desired actions.  All your options are still available .  Fighting game inputs determine what actions you have available. This can lock players out of fighting games by gating essential moves behind arbitrarily complicated commands.   Second, on what basis do you have to make such a claim. There are many games that have necessary fundamentals to and deep strategy to learn that execute commands with a single button press and single direction stick input or mouse click. And more people commit to learning them since they are not hindered in execution by an antiquated input style."

Ah well, I'll leave my entire post here anyway since it's still kinda relevant to discussion ;] */edit*  I would actually argue that this actually makes it more akin to an RTS, since it boils it down to more pure tactics/strategy, rather than obfuscating things behind complex inputs.  I'm having a hard time really putting what I mean into words, since RTS games DO require a lot of execution, but it's the execution of a complex strategy, not really complex inputs for that strategy.  I feel like most fighting games tend to require both complex strategy/tactics and complex inputs, and a game like this simplifies the component that really doesn't add much to the experience except frustration for most people.  Doing so allows a far wider audience to compete at a much higher level strategically, while still keeping the non-execution elements that make high level fighting game play engaging.  It's hard to say if that's going to be engaging enough for high level fighting game players, but I don't know if it's really intending to be.  That said, the vast majority of People Interested In Fighting Games are probably not high level players, and most probably don't bother trying to be due to the steep learning curve.  I think this game is actually pretty intriguing, much in the same way that Dive Kick ended up being a pretty brilliant idea, despite its origins as an in-joke.  Dive Kick was too simplified for me to want to play it as something more than a party game with friends, but something like this seems right up my alley."
Games,3dz23j,Chrystolis,4,Mon Jul 20 22:26:32 2015 UTC,"I certainly think there's a middle ground.  Easy to learn, hard to master is the ideal in my mind.  Have just enough execution so that players can pull off special moves, but it still takes practice to string it together into something useful.  I think Moba's have shown that even casual players will invest the time into learning a punishing competitive game.   I'm also not one to really care about mass appeal.  As a gamer, I don't care as long as there's enough competition to play against.  I realize developers have to consider sales more, but that's why I think there's a way to appeal to both audiences.  For example Persona 4 Ultimax has an autocombo for each character that lets casual players do decent damage, but without being ideal for a competitive scene. (Although they still have their uses as setups for other combos even at high level.)  Likewise having a fleshed out story mode like P4U and MKX have will appeal to people like my sister who hate fighting games but may muscle through the story mode."

The Witcher 3 is hardly the first, and I doubt will be the last game that penalizes too high and too low level quests. That's more a strategy mistake. One I made too for a bit. I ended the game with about 4-5 grey quests still in my log, and having ""cleared out"" about 3-4 of them. By and large, I didn't lose many, but I did mess it up at the beginning."
Games,3dr1q6,SurrealSage,3,Sat Jul 18 20:18:28 2015 UTC,"I don't think penalizing that way is quite fair when quests are such a large part of your xp gains that the end level is basically sure to lie within 3 levels. Plus, leaving some quests for later theoretically makes the game slightly harder overall. I can't say that I support that decision."
Games,3dr1q6,Paremo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:01:35 2015 UTC,Monster fights give very little exp on the harder difficulties too.
Games,3dr1q6,insanopointless,-1,Sun Jul 19 12:28:11 2015 UTC,Maybe because the xp system is only balanced for standard. Death March etc is designed to be rougher on players. The xp scale down is not balanced to provide the best gear.

Games,3dr1q6,calimanread,5,Sat Jul 18 19:26:46 2015 UTC,I thought the same until I tried a main story mission.  It automatically removed the gear from me.  Had to go back to a very old save.

Games,3dr1q6,4524196842,111,Mon Jul 20 05:15:06 2015 UTC,"Here's a video of the alternate movement, from r/witcher.   He shows off the old movement setting first for a comparison, and switches to the new one around 0:55."
Games,3dr1q6,IDUnavailable,86,Sat Jul 18 18:14:44 2015 UTC,So the alternative basically allows for moving directly in the direction you want instead of running curves. While the standard looks better on the eye I lost count of running into stuff because of the standard layout. I will certainly check this out for some side quests I still need to do.
Games,3dr1q6,Srefanius,70,Sat Jul 18 19:43:02 2015 UTC,"It also doesn't have the silly pseudo-inertia kind of thing, which probably is supposed to add realism but just ends up being annoying.  I'll take precision and responsivness over realism, every time. Especially with mouse and keyboard which main advantage is precision, but pseudo-inertia just nullifies it."
Games,3dr1q6,Krokodzl,15,Sat Jul 18 20:19:36 2015 UTC,"There is still an inertia, it's just lower and he changes direction quicker. It's not full on MMO movement but something inbetween. I think it's better than what it was. I stopped playing because I just couldn't use the old scheme.

Games,3dr1q6,Salvyana420tr,2,Sat Jul 18 22:51:24 2015 UTC,"I pretty much toggle walk every time I start up the game.

Games,3dr1q6,SDStormtrooper,2,Sun Jul 19 12:09:23 2015 UTC,"When you say ""pseudo-inertia"" do you mean Geralt continuing to walk a bit after you let go of WASD?  Sorry for being a dolt."
Games,3dr1q6,FuggenBaxterd,3,Sun Jul 19 11:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think they're more referring to inertia in turning, when you press left or right while walking forwards he doesn't immediately start going the direction you pressed but instead sort of carves a quarter circle in that direction."
Games,3dr1q6,CptOblivion,2,Sun Jul 19 16:25:30 2015 UTC,"Oh right, I know what you mean.  I really hate that."
Games,3dr1q6,FuggenBaxterd,2,Sun Jul 19 16:42:01 2015 UTC,The base game was definitely designed with gamepad in mind first. Probably due to a larger market preferring gamepad with offline single player rpgs. It's funny. I love keyboard and mouse to almost every game type. Except rpgs. I want to sit back and relax. I can't do that with a keyboard and mouse. If I don't maintain proper posture it's just a strain. Gamepad though.... It's meant to be in the hands. So I don't need to worry about my neck or back and can just get comfy.
Games,3dr1q6,VintageSin,4,Sat Jul 18 22:22:34 2015 UTC,"I played on my controller after getting pissed off with the mouse/keyboard, and the controls were still awful. Having a noticeable (and extremely touchy) dividing line between walk/run completely negates the reason one would use the thumb sticks."
Games,3dr1q6,Josheru,2,Sun Jul 19 15:28:07 2015 UTC,The more responsive one is also more realistic.  I wish the developers would go outside and run around for 10 seconds; no one moves like they're quickly pushing their way through air made of Jello.
Games,3dr1q6,Josheru,3,Sun Jul 19 15:26:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you try going outside and run for 10 seconds and see if you can sprint corners."
Games,3dr1q6,ultramarine8,5,Sun Jul 19 17:40:51 2015 UTC,"That is absolutely not what I am talking about.  That's quite a bit different from making a video game character ""ramp up"" their momentum to walk to a chest 4 feet away. He doesn't weigh as much as a Mack Truck, and as such, should not have the inertia of one. Couple that with the very terrible black/white design for thumb sticks (so they basically function like a keyboard), and you have a character who is completely unrealistic in his movements."
Games,3dr1q6,Josheru,-19,Sun Jul 19 17:51:44 2015 UTC,"Speak for yourself. I use a controller and the movement feels great to me. I'm glad they put this option in though, so everyone can be happy. I know there was a big divide on what people preferred."
Games,3dr1q6,Khorib,6,Sat Jul 18 20:26:13 2015 UTC,The old style of movement works much better on controller.  Imo it feels terrible on M/K though.
Games,3dr1q6,Sleepy_Spider,5,Sat Jul 18 21:14:38 2015 UTC,Thanks! Even just watching that video I feel much more in control now.   I'd argue being in control of the character is way more immersive than having the character move according to video game physics.
Games,3dr1q6,anononobody,36,Sun Jul 19 01:12:28 2015 UTC,"The new movement is so much better. This is how I wanted movement to work in the first place. Well, I played 240 hours of the game so far. Time to start Death March difficulty!"
Games,3dr1q6,SurrealSage,3,Sat Jul 18 18:26:09 2015 UTC,Whats the difference?  I'm a bit gutted they fixed some of my complaints months after release (I hated the movement) as I've already finished the game.  In future I really need to avoid pre-orders I guess and wait a few months!
Games,3dr1q6,croppergib,20,Sat Jul 18 23:02:06 2015 UTC,"Think of the plus side: At least CDPR listens and makes these changes. Most of us who have known the company for a while expected them to be releasing big patches to fix some of the less liked parts of the game, as they have done the exact same thing for the last 2 Witcher games.  So at least it is getting fixed instead of letting it stay in the state of release.  As for what is different: Movement is -much- more responsive. You remember how if you wanted to turn Left, movement was ""realistic"" in that Geralt would walk forward while turning to make a curve in his movement? Now, he turns immediately left with this new system. It is a lot more responsive.  And yeah, even though with CDPR, you can count on them to fix some of the crap, it is still wise to avoid preorders."

I was getting some nasty stuttering and around 46 FPS on my dual GTX 970 system, but everything seems to be running flawlessly now.  The new movement system is pretty fluid and responsive now too, but it feels like it acts funny while using  your witcher sense. Might just be the drop in FOV while using it, but the camera seems to get hung up on walls and sometimes Geralt feels like he isn't responding right to your inputs.  Overall a great update on PC, haven't run in to any serious problems yet. The movement and performance increases are fantastic and a great sign of things to come in the future of this game."

I don't see it in the patch list, but they were still broken the other day and now they work just fine.  Used to be every single whale I saw would have its hump crest, dive, and then its tail would come out....and freeze.  It would just be stuck there, motionless, water particle effects splashing around it.  It would only start moving again if you actually moved up close to it in a boat.  Once you got within like, 30-40 feet of it, it would continue the animation and disappear.   Now they work just fine; played for a couple hours last night, all the animations went right.  I love the update, lots of great fixes.  I only actually have one complaint.  I think it's really cool that they revamped inventory and all that, and I am really happy they gave us options to sort items in their respective categories, but...WHY WOULD YOU PUT THE COMBAT OILS ON THE BOTTOM?!   I use bombs, I use decoctions, but I use oils way more than any of those.  They used to be on the top!  I swap them out way more than I swap out bombs and decoctions/potions.  Ugh.

In the first scenario you break the illusion that consoles are offering good graphics when the highest setting is normal/medium.

I've found the more graphic intensive games (I close the game apps before hand) will have noticeable frame drops at times when I only rest the console. If I exit it and let my Console rest for 6+ hrs (when I sleep) the Frame drops reduce significantly. It's plausible the ps4 is thermal throttling during long periods game play with out complete power shutoff.

Games,3dr1q6,ImperatorBevo,6,Sat Jul 18 22:26:46 2015 UTC,That is most definitely a placebo effect.  Just make sure there isn't dust in the PS4 and make sure it's in a decent place with good airflow and it's not getting too hot...that's realistically all you can do.
Games,3dr1q6,caribou_doodoo,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:30:22 2015 UTC,That's weird because it is actually the opposite for me. Before the patch it was borderline unplayable for me on PS4 because of the framerate and now after the new update it runs better than ever.

Games,3dr1q6,FrankReynolds,14,Sat Jul 18 22:55:27 2015 UTC,"I'm going to speculate this is because these changes are rather low level, and when you change something very low level, it can be a pain to just release the update via ""deltas"" (that is, only send out the little bits that have changed).  Lots of higher level stuff can depend on things as fundamental as movement, and even moreso on the little changes you can't even see.  It was probably easier and cheaper to just rebuild everything from a higher level and pump that out instead, so it can come down to 5gb even if you only changed very little. the size of your changes was very little.  Kind of like the ripple effect, or maybe more accurately the butterfly effect.  I guess a potential way to test this would be to assess the total disk usage of the game before and then after.  Did the update replace stuff, or did it append to stuff?  Though maybe this wouldn't be helpful since lots of times games keep old versions around just in case.  I'm curious what people who know more about this type of thing think.  /speculative rant"

Games,3dr1q6,DoctorGonzo23,1 point,Sat Jul 18 20:19:33 2015 UTC,Yeh my XB1 update was 7.9
Games,3dr1q6,razzymac,5,Sat Jul 18 20:26:21 2015 UTC,does the new movement change help swimming any?
Games,3dr1q6,SnatchTease,4,Sat Jul 18 22:19:25 2015 UTC,"Okay will someone explain the ""alternate"" movement style to me?  I kept flipping back and forth between them and really couldn't pinpoint any specific differences.  I went back to the standard, because the alternate felt a bit slippery to me, but not drastically.  I really couldn't tell.  What changed?"
Games,3dr1q6,TomPalmer1979,7,Sat Jul 18 23:13:20 2015 UTC,alternative is more direct while the standard focuses more on animation and geralt movement.  for example in standard mode when you stop there is a short moment of watching geralt slow down before stopping but in alternative mode that is a lot shorter and its almost instant
Games,3dr1q6,Blackdeath_663,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:42:28 2015 UTC,Standard is like you're driving Geralt like a car. He has momentum and it takes a second to push him into a turn or make him stop. Alternate has him turn more or less on a dime and he doesn't take as long to come to a stop.
Games,3dr1q6,bitch_im_a_lion,17,Sat Jul 18 19:31:04 2015 UTC,Top comments get deleted if they are under a certain word (or maybe letter?) count.
Games,3dr1q6,SDStormtrooper,2,Sat Jul 18 19:52:30 2015 UTC,What does that alternate movement entail? Is it like a sprint function? New animations? The wording is pretty vague.
Games,3dr1q6,Rekthor,5,Sat Jul 18 21:12:29 2015 UTC,"It's a toggle in the menu. I think it just changes the responsiveness, and physics. Less inertia and momentum. Nothing really visibly different."
Games,3dr1q6,Shosray,3,Sat Jul 18 17:46:08 2015 UTC,Honestly all I've really noticed is the super responsive control. Like before if you moved the stick to the right he would turn himself and then move that way. With this new system you move the stick to the right and boom he's immediately going in that direction.
Games,3dr1q6,Potatoman700,6,Sat Jul 18 18:00:04 2015 UTC,So moving Geralt isn't like driving a car anymore? You don't have to consider his maximum turning radius and inability to stop moving when you want him to?  Thank god.
Games,3dr1q6,netherous,2,Sat Jul 18 18:13:41 2015 UTC,Why on earth would you assume they are shadowbanned? You know mods can and do remove low effort comments.

Games,3dr1q6,Uptopdownlowguy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:46:36 2015 UTC,Great patch so far! Getting 45-60fps on a 970 + 3770k on ultra with Hairworks on all set at 2 AA. Previously I would get drops lower than 30 with Hairworks on. (No INI tinkering).   The new movement might also be a placebo in thinking the frame rate is smoother because Geralt is much more responsive.

This is a huge 6 gig patch that includes a completely overhauled inventory system and an optional alternative movement system for controlling the character."
Games,3dr1q6,RscMrF,5,Sat Jul 18 18:23:06 2015 UTC,"Yes, the patches that have made the front page have all been fairly substantial and this one more than others. I personally visit this sub often, and upon seeing this post immediately knew to open GoG so the patch would start downloading.  There is also a lot of first hand accounts of the new movement which could be helpful to people who maybe stopped playing the game or even uninstalled it because of the movement system.  I did not mind it, but I have heard several complaints that it made them not want to play the game at all.  Finally, the post is clearly game related and violates no rules of the subreddit, so if people want to see it, which clearly we do, then there is no reason not to post it.  No hate from me, just explaining why I think these posts should be allowed. I would not worry about the sub becoming /r/patchnotes if it starts to become that, then maybe we readdress the issue.  Plus this sub is not exactly thriving with new content, posts will stay on the front page for a long time compared to other subs with similar traffic. For the amount of people here, we don't exactly have a ton of posts. Looking at the front page right now, there are several posts that could better be left to other quite popular subs, a post about DOTA international, PSN flash sale, Graphics card bundled with a game, going by your standards even the interview with Chris Roberts should not be here as it is better suited to the star citizen subreddit.   A general gaming sub like this is going to have a lot of stuff that could be found on specific subreddits, but if the community feels like a bit of news is worthy of being here, and it is within the rules of the sub, then that is exactly what this subreddit is for."
Games,3dr1q6,RscMrF,2,Sun Jul 19 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"/r/games is strictly a subreddit promoted for game and gaming related news so it only is natural to post it here. I understand you don't want to see same old names keep showing up but it is the nature of news that it is reported, there is no other way."
Games,3dr1q6,demfiils,0,Sun Jul 19 14:34:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's my point. Its for news and I guess if its an extremely major patch for a game that changes a significant amount, it makes sense, but this is literally a bug fixing patch for a game thats been out for a while. Submissions like this just seem more appropriate for their own subreddits, like /r/witcher."
Games,3dr1q6,breich9,-1,Sun Jul 19 17:25:17 2015 UTC,"Did you even see how big the patch notes were? It's a 5gb update and fixes a lot of problems people had with the game including the addition of a new movement system and performance fixes. People have been waiting for this patch for weeks.

As to the game being unplayable, eh. After finding a .ini tweak, and lowering my resolution, I was able to keep the game smooth and free from crashes. Unfortunately there is still a big memory leak so that only lasts for so long."

Games,3dq8ef,Genesis2nd,19,Sat Jul 18 19:37:02 2015 UTC,That game is good af. It'll get fixed
Games,3dq8ef,gamerexq,22,Sat Jul 18 15:58:56 2015 UTC,"In terms of performance, Arkham Knight have been really hit-or-miss. Either it's buttery smooth or it's a powerpoint slideshow.  Luckily I experienced the former and was able to play the game without a hitch. While the story had its ups and downs, I'd say it was a step up from Arkham City, in terms of story. Even though I was super disappointed at how Arkham Knight, the character, turned out, at the same time I felt that particular villain got sent off in a proper fashion.   Other than that, as you say, it's good as fuck and I'd say a good way of ending Rocksteady's Batman games (ignoring the technical issues, obviously)"
Games,3dq8ef,caribou_doodoo,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:28 2015 UTC,"Yea, it truly is good imo."
Games,3dq8ef,nourez,19,Sat Jul 18 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"Weakest Arkham game in the series, imo and I have at least 50 hours in each game.  Arkham: World of Tanks really felt the loss of head writer Paul Dini.  The story was noticeably inferior to the other games."
Games,3dq8ef,kkeenn123,2,Sat Jul 18 17:35:17 2015 UTC,"I'm not done yet (about 25% so far), and I feel like the story hasn't done all that much to compel me like the writing in Asylum and City did.  Dialogue is good, and performances are great as always.  Also doesn't seem to make as good use of the rogue's gallery as the first two Rocksteady games did (though it doesn't overdo it like Origins either).  Also I'm 98% sure I know who the Arkham Knight is after the first little bit of dialogue he has with Batman.  I'm hoping that it's just a red herring but if it is who I think it is, then they essentially have made no effort to hide the identity bar the cool looking mask.  And I feel like the Batmobile takes some of the fun out of just patrolling the streets and finding random crime scenes and the like.    It's a testament to how much fun the core of the game is though because I'm still enjoying the fuck out of it despite all the issues."
Games,3dq8ef,caribou_doodoo,3,Mon Jul 20 01:54:40 2015 UTC,"Can I ask how the city feels as opposed to Origins? My biggest problem with that game was that the city had no one in it but thugs and wasn't really interesting to look around or explore in, and having to go through the bridge every time forced me to use fast travel, which shouldn't be in a Batman game imo."
Games,3dq8ef,tinnedwaffles,14,Sat Jul 18 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"The city definitely feels more alive in Arkham Knight but both games use really forced plot devices to explain away why the city is devoid of civilians and atmosphere.  It's still just thugs only (and one police car!) in Arkham Knight, except this time you get a bunch of militia tanks and drones patrolling, too.    The other games (including Origins) felt like a Batman story first and foremost to me, but Arkham Knight feels like a video game first and foremost this time around.  It's like they really went for the ""bigger is better"" Michael Bay approach to this one."
Games,3dq8ef,caribou_doodoo,5,Sat Jul 18 18:08:45 2015 UTC,The lack of staged atypical boss fights really takes the punctuation out of the story progress too. Didn't even realize I'd defeated Arkham Knight until the end sequence. Penguin and TwoFace get screwed over so bad/easily it was sorta funny and kinda realistic but mostly disappointing.
Games,3dq8ef,breakingbroken,4,Sat Jul 18 18:50:46 2015 UTC,"The ""Militia Commander"" boss fight was probably the biggest disappointment.  Not really sure what they were thinking with that."
Games,3dq8ef,gyrorobo,2,Sat Jul 18 18:54:43 2015 UTC,"The high point of the game imo was the classic arkham gameplay we got in the studio sequence, the three mini boss battles were awesome. Which is sad because it was like....an hour in length."

Anyways, analysis of one of the trailer seems to suggest there are three ""phases"" of Big Boss throughout the ""Metal Gear Solid V experience"" - the Ground Zeroes Big Boss, a small-horned Big Boss, and a large-horned bloody Big Boss. It'd kind of undermine this slow turn to ""the dark side"" if the game starred a completely different character.  Not to mention that this whole aspect of Big Boss being ""haunted"" by Skull Face would be rather odd if we experienced the story as another character.   TL;DR: I'll take that bet and your monies."

The GPU prices here in NZ are completely fucked this gen and the only viable upgrade for me as a result is the GTX 970, but after getting assfucked horrendously by the frametime issues with my r6850 I didn't want to risk a repeat with the 970s borked memory architecture.   Now that A game I actually want is bundled though... that 970 starts looking a little more worth the risk, it's about the only one that is reasonably priced and is a worthwhile performance upgrade at the same time... saving 15-20% of the price on a game I was going to buy anyway makes it a decent deal. Guess I'd better start researching how stable frametimes are on the 970 when you are sticking to 1080p and if there is a way to limit mem usage (why haven't nvidia just made it a driver option to not have the 0.5Gb addressable, avoiding the whole mess in the first place?)"
Games,3dq8ef,Vitefish,2,Sun Jul 19 00:30:03 2015 UTC,"There are very few games that use more than 3GB at 1080p, you should be fine for a really long time unless devs pull something crazy."
Games,3dq8ef,fiahhu,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:16:40 2015 UTC,"Thats the theory, but that presupposes that devs don't go bonkers now that HBM is giving them silly amounts of bandwidth to play with. Also assumes nVidias drivers are solid and don't throw things on that 0.5gb block at all. Hopefully that is the case."
Games,3dq8ef,Dasnap,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:57:09 2015 UTC,So now the decision: get a 970 for the cheaper price/MGS or a r9 390 for the 9gb VRAM?

Games,3ds0og,Cynicallity,26,Sat Jul 18 22:18:49 2015 UTC,It's much better than having to buy three or four content updates like with SF4.
Games,3ds0og,Cynicallity,6,Sat Jul 18 22:22:25 2015 UTC,"Handling it in this manner seems to put a damper on the possibility of SF5 getting released on the Xbox One in the form of a Super SF5. It will be interesting to see how SF5 evolves and changes, and whether it will remain a console exclusive to Playstation 4."
Games,3ds0og,Hatdrop,20,Sat Jul 18 22:26:33 2015 UTC,Probably not going to happen. (via Capcoms panel today at Evo). It seems like Street Fighter could become a Sony-exclusive franchise as far as consoles go.
Games,3ds0og,Azuvector,22,Sat Jul 18 22:31:23 2015 UTC,"I think part of that is xbox live's draconian network policies.  They will not support any kind of cross server functionality, and from what I recall SF was supposed to be cross server with PC and PS4"

Games,3ds0og,flyingfishcake1,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:52:52 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it's mainly because Sony gave them a fist full of of cash and is co-producing the game.  The cross-server stuff is cool, but it wouldn't stop Capcom from releasing a different SKU on XB1 to make more money if there wasn't some financial incentive from Sony to avoid doing so.  (Then again, Capcom does use the term ""exclusive"" quite liberally... there was a time when Resident Evil 4 was the most rock-solid exclusive money could buy, yet Capcom still found a way to weasel out of their deal with Nintendo and port it to PS2.)"
Games,3ds0og,ukulelej,2,Sun Jul 19 14:49:50 2015 UTC,"The question that needs to be asked is how much grinding is needed to unlock each character. 16 characters at launch is on the lower side for a $60 fighting game. SFIV started with 19, and that was in 2009."

I didn't want to buy Lucas for SSB4 but when I bring my WiiU to a tournament I might screw over a Lucas main that wants to use my set up."
Games,3ds0og,whatyousay69,9,Sat Jul 18 22:55:35 2015 UTC,That's usually not a problem for non-Wii U fighting games. Whoever mains a DLC character can just sign in with their account and download the DLC.
Games,3ds0og,MrPangolin,11,Sun Jul 19 00:01:03 2015 UTC,Isn't it still a problem with cross platform games tho?  What if the person who mains a DLC character has the game on one console while the tournament is on another console?
Games,3ds0og,ukulelej,7,Sun Jul 19 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"Skullgirls gets around this by having a tournament mode which allows you to use any character, regardless of whether you own the DLC."
Games,3ds0og,MrPangolin,4,Sun Jul 19 05:51:39 2015 UTC,That's a really cool idea. But how is it not abused? Couldn't you just turn on the tournament mode every time you play the game? Or does buying the DLC allow you to use them in single player?
Games,3ds0og,ukulelej,16,Sun Jul 19 11:30:22 2015 UTC,"You can't play the characters in Single player (Story and Arcade) or use them in the training room.  Also tournament mode is local-only, so can't play online with them either."

A game played competitively, where people fight, is considered ""fighting game"". Ergo, Sakurai does not get to tell his own community what his game is classified as.

It has none of the improvisational dynamic flow that made Melee a fun and unique fighting game, and instead just rewards extremely safe and defensive play. Yes it's arguably a ""fighting game"" in the loosest sense of the term, but it is ridiculed in the fighting game community for good reason - the matches take way too long and are unbelievably boring to everyone except those who are in denial about how casual and anti-competitive it is. I will defend Melee as a game with competitive depth but Smash 4 is a joke."
Games,3ds0og,komodo_dragonzord,3,Sun Jul 19 16:01:40 2015 UTC,"One thing: could they call the major patch releases ""Super"", ""Ultra"", ect to keep the tradition?"

The last couple months with all the news coming out about it from E3 and Comic-Con made me more and more excited about the game. This? This just seems like icing on the cake. The model isn't exactly new, I know, but I love the fact that you can earn whatever is put into the game after launch.  This might be the first fighting game where I'll actually want to put in the time and effort to get really good at, since there will be new characters waiting to be unlocked if I do (or I can just buy them, but...nah, I like the other way better).   Also, calling the premium currency Zenny...I see that Mega Man reference, Capcom. What are you trying to say?"

I really hope that the amount of grinding necessary doesn't mean that only the most active of players have full rosters.  Rip on the SFIV way all you want, but for localized tournaments it was clear cut and easy."
Games,3ds0og,ShinCoal,2,Sun Jul 19 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"I see where you're coming from but out of everyone at the venue, there hopefully should be enough people with logins to have everyone. Especially competitive players who play the game enough to unlock everyone on their own."

Honestly, fighting games don't really need that many more, but SFIV had about, what, 25 characters? I mean, in the long run, you'll be paying less overall than you would for all the new versions, but it still sounds like they hacked up a bit of the roster so they could sell it to you later. At least you can buy them with in-game currency, eventually...  EDIT: I'm basing my numbers off of this link, since I can't remember off the top of my head how many were in the original game. It looks like 19 for the arcade version, plus six more for the home version, plus Dee Jay eventually, making 25/26. Can people actually correct me instead of just blindly downvoting me?"
Games,3ds0og,MattBahr,11,Sun Jul 19 01:29:32 2015 UTC,"Vanilla SF4 came with 19, not much more than SF5 atm"
Games,3ds0og,EnigmaticJester,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"Arcade versions of SF4 initially had 19 playable characters, but the console releases had 25 playable characters.  16 characters is weak for a modern Street Fighter."

EDIT: wait, I see what you're saying, that old games would be ""16/25 and unlock the remaining 9 by grinding."" I guess so, but you didn't have to grind that for SFIV. It's one of the few fighting games that doesn't lock half the roster and make it unfun for people to, say, buy, and then expect to play with all their friends immediately (like Smash)."
Games,3ds0og,GamerToons,-1,Sun Jul 19 15:09:07 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Do quality game mechanics take precedence over a large cast?  Of course.  That said, I think a core roster of 16 fighters is weak for a series as deep and varied as Street Fighter.  The console release for the original Street Fighter 4 indeed had 25 playable characters.  Street Fighter V is confirmed for 4 newcomers, leaving only 12 slots for returning characters.  At this point, only 5 returning characters have yet to be shown.  There will be devastating roster cuts to which I'm not looking forward.  Hopefully the unlocking process for DLC characters isn't too much of a grind.  As a side note:  God forbid anyone criticizes Street Fighter, apparently."
Games,3ds0og,needconfirmation,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"Jeez, no kidding. Not a single person actually proving what the original roster number was, and two people agreeing with me, but -16 nonetheless. Are they just mad because I pointed out that they hacked out a third of the roster to make you either pay or grind for?  Is this new system bad? No, and I even pointed out that overall, it's a net gain. The fact is you're still having to put in extra time or money (and for anyone out there without a job who has a lot of free time, trust me, the fact that you are able to ""grind to buy, but you don't have to pay any real money!"" isn't really that helpful when you have a job and have so little free time) to get a roster that you got for the base price of the game one game ago."
Games,3ds0og,DocFurry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:26:52 2015 UTC,"Personally this allows them to get the game out there. The way they are building it will allow them to add characters consistently which you can earn just by playing the game.  This adds longevity to a title, creates buzz over time and gets more people into SF.   Its brilliant to be honest and fair for gamers."
Games,3dyim9,_its_ya_boy_,12,Mon Jul 20 15:59:49 2015 UTC,Probably the worst vid ive ever seen.

He could have flown to the darkside of the planet.  He could have actually checked out the crashed freighter!  but nope. Lets do what every other single nms vid does. Walk around.  Im not sure if walking around planets is all ign can do but If their goal of ign first is to create hype then this is not how to go about it.  Still excited for the game though but this coverage is so underwhelming that i would be surprised if anyone that wasnt already hyped will be hyped if they paid attention to ign first this month.  edit: apparently ign posted 2 vids today. this one is a tad bit more interesting where the player actually does something  http://www.ign.com/videos/2015/07/20/no-mans-sky-6-minutes-of-exploration-gameplay-ign-first?utm_source=IGN%20hub%20page&utm_medium=IGN%20(front%20page)&utm_content=3&utm_campaign=Blogroll

Games,3dr52z,Deviathan,12,Mon Jul 20 00:04:25 2015 UTC,I believe Wild Season was coming to PC and looked promising.

Games,3dr52z,GamerToons,6,Sat Jul 18 23:24:35 2015 UTC,I checked this game out but it looks like a crappy flash game and I cant get behind it. It just lacks the art of HM games because of the flimsy iPhone app /  flash animation look of the game.  They could have done a lot better for PC.
Games,3dr52z,Thutman,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:38:06 2015 UTC,"Holy shit, I just remembered Stardew Valley existed. Has the dev said anything about an actual release date for that? I was so excited when they announced it."
Games,3dr52z,raspiz,7,Sat Jul 18 21:59:52 2015 UTC,The dev is hard at work and has regular informational updates on the website.   He wants to make sure the game is solid before releasing and doesn't want to put out a release date yet and then miss it. Be patient and hopefully we'll all get the game we want!

Games,3dr52z,lilmissclicks,-20,Sun Jul 19 04:41:01 2015 UTC,Harvest Moon is coming to PC   emulators brah
Games,3dr52z,Gyossaits,9,Sat Jul 18 18:53:46 2015 UTC,Not the same thing.
Games,3dr52z,the-stormin-mormon,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:19:07 2015 UTC,How so?
Games,3dr52z,lilmissclicks,-8,Sun Jul 19 09:28:19 2015 UTC,How not? Between all the emulators I've enjoyed the majority of the Harvest Moon and Rune Factory series.
Games,3dr52z,matchu,6,Sat Jul 18 22:19:08 2015 UTC,"I think it's a quality thing. Everyone knows they can emulate; they're looking to be fully immersed by using natural PC controls and seeing graphics optimized for their hardware. Most emulator-based experiences have issues that break the immersion.  It's like the difference between watching in SD and HD. SD is perfectly serviceable, but can be distractingly low-quality on an HD display. The idea of an old favorites being rereleased in HD isn't revolutionary, but it sure can be exciting."
Games,3dr52z,lilmissclicks,-14,Sun Jul 19 00:52:21 2015 UTC,"If that's the issue then I'm just not able to give a fuck. That's just silly entitlement. You want better just because you play on a PC. Emulators run perfectly fine, and offer a multitude of options to improve the experience. Just replayed Persona 4 (in anticipation for Persona 5) on PCSX2 which offered great post processing, superb emulation of the controls, and apart from being in my chair and not on my couch was an identical experience.  edit: plus savestates :3"
Games,3dr52z,matchu,3,Sun Jul 19 01:00:13 2015 UTC,"Shrug. It makes more of a difference to some people than it does to us, and it's okay for them to want what they want. Wanting native PC Harvest Moon isn't entitlement. Feeling entitled to native PC Harvest Moon is entitlement.  Like, I'd love for the main Persona line to launch on a platform that I own. I'm sad that it hasn't, but I'm not angry, because that would just be silly. I'm sure some people engage in that kind of silly behavior, but that's a separate issue."
Games,3dr52z,lilmissclicks,0,Sun Jul 19 02:14:57 2015 UTC,"In the case of Persona I'm more empathetic, luckily I have a PS4 for it, but yeah it does bite for anyone else."

Games,3dr52z,AuthorAlden,3,Sun Jul 19 04:02:47 2015 UTC,I still fire up the PS emulator for Back to Nature every few years or so. Love that game so much.
Games,3dr52z,Zeholipael,3,Sun Jul 19 00:28:13 2015 UTC,"Because it's not ON PC, it's EMULATED ON PC. Different things.  I can emulate Symphony of the Night, but that doesn't mean SOTN got a PC release."
Games,3dr52z,lilmissclicks,-10,Sun Jul 19 00:15:42 2015 UTC,"So what? Your argument is that it doesn't say PC on the Wikipedia entry? That just sounds entitled. Talk about a bunch of other series, or genres that can't be played on anything other than 360/PS3 or later and you might have something, but you can play it. The experience is identical. If you want the handheld bit you can play it on a smart phone even."
Games,3dr52z,Zeholipael,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:33:58 2015 UTC,"My point is I cannot buy a CD or download an EXE file and pop it in and just play the game, you're emulating a console environment to play the game. What people want is native support for both mouse and keyboard, a GUI made for PC, and programming that takes advantage of a PC environment, in a file format natively supported by the PC.  I think you know this and are just being pedantic for no reason."
Games,3dr52z,lilmissclicks,-9,Sun Jul 19 00:48:27 2015 UTC,"pedantic   ""Native support"" is pedantic. PC (Mac, Linux, and Android) all support emulators, and run roms/isos just fine. It's basically plug an play. Keyboard and mouse works fine. You can plug a controller in, or you can emulate analog with the mouse."
Games,3dr52z,Zeholipael,3,Sun Jul 19 00:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, I'm sure playing the Console version of StarCraft 1 in an emulator. is the same as playing the Native PC Version, right? Oh wait, no, it's not. The PC Version was clearly designed to take advantage of the hardware and peripherals, and runs as an EXE File without the need for an emulator  Again, you know what I mean. Don't be that guy. If it needs an emulator. It's not on PC.  By your logic, Melty Blood is on the Wii, and so are the Pokemon games. They can be emulated on one. Why do people bitch about the Pokemon series not being on Wii then?"
Games,3dr52z,113mac113,178,Sun Jul 19 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"Marvelous (The original harvest moon devs) had some dispute with Natsume and lost the Harvest Moon developing rights. So they made ""Story of Seasons"". So if you wan't an ACTUAL harvest moon game. Get that instead."
Games,3dr52z,planetarial,87,Sat Jul 18 17:58:21 2015 UTC,Iirc it wasn't a dispute. Marvelous acquired XSeed and wanted to do their localizations internally from now on
Games,3dr52z,113mac113,16,Sat Jul 18 18:02:28 2015 UTC,Ah thanks for letting me know. I'm not the biggest harvest moon fan so I'm not 100% informed with it.
Games,3dr52z,113mac113,17,Sat Jul 18 18:25:54 2015 UTC,Because it mostly is true. Marvelous isn't developing Harvest Moon games anymore. So if you want an actual harvest moon game instead of the crap Natsume is spewing out. Buy Story of Seasons.
Games,3dr52z,th30be,-14,Sun Jul 19 01:46:08 2015 UTC,He wanted to sound cool on the internet.
Games,3dr52z,Kuraito,3,Sun Jul 19 03:00:05 2015 UTC,"Really? I heard that Natsume was pressuring them to make the game more 'minecraft/farmville'y and Marvelous basically told them to stuff it and bailed. I have story of seasons actually, but I haven't gotten to deep into it. It seems really good though."
Games,3dr52z,planetarial,31,Sun Jul 19 02:25:30 2015 UTC,"Back in 1996, a company named Victor Interactive Software (VIS) published a farming simulation game called Bokujou Monogatari. The company then teamed up with a North American video game publisher, Natsume Inc., to release the game in English. Natsume localized the game in 1997 as Harvest Moon.  Since that time, the Bokumono game would be released in Japan, localized by Natsume, and then released in North America as Harvest Moon. During this time, the original VIS merged with another company, Marvelous Interactive, who then merged with another company to become Marvelous Entertainment, then Marvelous AQL, and is currently known as simply Marvelous. Through the multitude of company mergers, Marvelous eventually acquired a company named XSeed Games, which it began to use to localize Marvelous' Japan-published games.  When its latest Bokumono game was published, Marvelous opted to use its existing localization subsidiary to manage the English release of its game instead of working with its long-term partner, Natsume Inc. Because the title Harvest Moon was created by, marketed, and owned by Natsume, Marvelous could not simply name their game ""Harvest Moon"" as it had been the case in the past. The company selected ""Story of Seasons"" as the title for its now self-published series. This allows Natsume to continue to use its ""Harvest Moon"" property to create a parallel series, which it did with Harvest Moon: The Lost Valley.   From here at the bottom of the page."
Games,3dr52z,Kuraito,-11,Sat Jul 18 19:17:34 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, but I will comment that while that may be the 'official' reason, I heard this said back when the split first happened, before the first Natsume only harvest moon. And what did we get in that Harvest Moon?  Minecraft-style terrain manipulation. Something seems screwy."
Games,3dr52z,Samhs1,17,Sat Jul 18 19:40:07 2015 UTC,"It sounds like you're making a kind of crazy leap, going from teraforming being added as a new feature all the way to    ""I heard that Natsume was pressuring them to make the game more 'minecraft/farmville'y and Marvelous basically told them to stuff it and bailed""    It comes across like you're making these weird huge leaps and coming up with a bunch of conjecture to fit some sort of personal narrative. Have you got any sources or proof of these claims?"
Games,3dr52z,Kuraito,1 point,Sat Jul 18 19:45:38 2015 UTC,"Sadly no, this was all forum talk way back when the split happened. Could just be speculation."
Games,3dr52z,pbrand,26,Sat Jul 18 20:42:16 2015 UTC,"Being a Marvelous game isn't even a guarantee of quality anymore. Story of Seasons, while shining brightly in some areas (like the cooking system), revolves around grinding in a way that no other previous Harvest Moon can match, not even the DS games. And of course that's an even further cry from the SNES/N64/PS1 games, which were all well-paced due to the 3 year time limit goal.  It's lost the ""village sim"" quaintness and sadly has gone done more of a Farmville path. You spend the game unlocking merchants with different shipping requirements and the last of two are just plain awful. Shipping 15,000 crops and 10,000 processed goods (like cheese) for one of them is absurd and boring; the other requires you to craft furniture and fences and other shit you probably weren't already selling (as a farmer) which means by the time you realize that there's a merchant linked to these goods, you'll be spending your time grinding them out in your later years.  It's quite depressing since Harvest Moon as a series is both older and more respectable than that. From what I've seen of the in-house Natsume ones, they're ripping off Minecraft instead.   I just really wish there was an actual Harvest Moon coming out, but it seems neither company (Marvelous nor in-house Natsume) is going to deliver on it. Like /u/HereForGames I agree that Stardew Valley is probably our best bet, but I think that they should have Kickstarted and hired an artist. Assuming the design is solid, it's really just the aesthetics that drag it down."
Games,3dr52z,TrustmeIknowaguy,25,Sat Jul 18 20:52:16 2015 UTC,Just feel like throwing this out there. Only the original SNES has the three year limit. In the n64 and ps1 you would be evaluated by your dad after three years and if you did right you would continue on indefinitely. If your dad wasn't pleased the game would end.
Games,3dr52z,dankclimes,7,Sat Jul 18 19:02:54 2015 UTC,"You could continue, but in the the n64 at least all of the story events with the townsfolk were only over the first 3 years so there wasn't much left to do."
Games,3dr52z,pbrand,4,Sat Jul 18 19:18:04 2015 UTC,"You're right, I've edited out ""limit"" in favor of ""goal""  Contrasting these 3 games with Story of Seasons (and most of the Wii/DS versions), there are goals but they're never tied to a time date (a loss condition), but rather a time cycle. Usually what it boils down to is waiting until a certain season in Tree of Tranquility to grow an item for the ""red"" rainbow (like a tomato) or waiting until a certain season in A New Beginning (to forage something like chamomile) to construct a building, which progresses the story/game. The pace is artificially limited by time in a way that the three first entries into the series aren't.   Story of Seasons continues with that frustrating thresholding. I'd really love to see this nifty new greenhouse type that unlocks in Year 4, but it's Year 3 Spring and I'm bored as hell. It's just walled off until an arbitrary time point regardless of how well I'm doing in the game."
Games,3dr52z,LotusFlare,11,Sat Jul 18 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"I'm finding Story of Seasons to be very enjoyable as long as I ignore those insane final goals. I know for a fact I'm never going to grind hard enough to get the Ice or Tropical regions, and I've made peace with that. Pretty much everything else in the game is very achievable in a 2-3 year in game timespan.  Other than that, I'm not seeing any way it's worse than any of the previous games. I'm finishing up my first year and I feel like SoS is consistently giving me new goals, new characters, and new options. I do wish there were more interactions with the villagers I can't marry and a proper place to do some mining, but I'm having fun."
Games,3dr52z,Erzeal,4,Sat Jul 18 19:44:02 2015 UTC,Story of seasons has been the first one I've been able to stick with long term. It just clicked with me unlike the other harvest moon games have.
Games,3dr52z,GRANDMA_FISTER,15,Sat Jul 18 21:04:27 2015 UTC,"I think the harvest moon games are all still perfectly playable nowadays, they've aged really well for anybody out there getting desperate."

Games,3dr52z,nullstorm0,23,Sat Jul 18 19:50:10 2015 UTC,Friends of Mineral Town is good.   Really good.
Games,3dr52z,thejokerlaughsatyou,5,Sat Jul 18 19:58:45 2015 UTC,"Seconded. Some else mentioned it and wondered if it was rose-colored glasses. It's not. My sister took my DS Harvest Moon, so I restarted FoMT on my old SP. I love it sooo much.   Word of warning (and minor spoiler) if you start it, though: if you don't get Cliff a job by the first fall, he leaves for good. If you want to keep everyone in your town, make sure you befriend him asap!"
Games,3dr52z,Vertraumte,2,Sat Jul 18 20:58:33 2015 UTC,I thought you don't necessarily have to befriend him. Just get him the job at the grape place (vineyard? winery?) once fall season arrives.
Games,3dr52z,thejokerlaughsatyou,2,Sun Jul 19 04:53:23 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't remember. :P I always liked him, so I befriended him immediately anyway. When my sister played it, he left her town, so we always thought you had to be his friend to get him the job. Maybe it doesn't matter. You do have to get him the job to stop him from leaving, though."
Games,3dr52z,planetarial,7,Sun Jul 19 08:10:12 2015 UTC,"Not the above commentor, but I liked Rune Factory 4 a ton but it's not very focused on farming (it is a HM/SoS spinoff after all).  Avoid HM: Lost Valley and Hometown Story (made by the same creator as the HM/SoS games), they're not good."
Games,3dr52z,Providentia,4,Sun Jul 19 19:11:04 2015 UTC,"With Rune Factory a viable alternative I'm surprised that people are still sticking to Harvest Moon given how many times the franchise has burned players over the years. Something foul's been festering in it for the better part of a decade now and at this point I don't see any prospect of a cure, whereas Rune Factory keeps getting better and better with every (mainline) installment."
Games,3dr52z,fatchoco,7,Sat Jul 18 20:43:52 2015 UTC,To bad the studio which made Rune Factory has shut down.
Games,3dr52z,planetarial,7,Sat Jul 18 20:55:13 2015 UTC,Most of the staff got absorbed into Marvelous and they resumed and finished Lord of Magna so I'm not completely out of hope.

Games,3dr52z,GRANDMA_FISTER,2,Sat Jul 18 21:23:13 2015 UTC,"I haven't gotten around to playing DS ones, although Rune Factory 3 was really nice (more focused on fighting). My personal favourite is https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvest_Moon:_Friends_of_Mineral_Town   If it isn't too much of a downgrade in your opinion or my rose colored glasses. It's got a very good critics score at least."

Games,3dr52z,FizzyDragon,2,Sat Jul 18 21:47:23 2015 UTC,"I felt so odd when I saw so much praise for Story of Seasons because I almost threw the game away during the tutorial I was forced to go through for the first week of game time.   Then I finally did give up on it when after a few more days of growing I had no money (from buying seeds and whatever) and no way to sell any of my produce because the market was just empty for multiple days in a row. I don't have time anymore to be frustrated for X hours when starting a game.  I mean if people have fun, that's excellent, I was just so surprised that I seemed to be the only one annoyed."
Games,3dr52z,pbrand,4,Mon Jul 20 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"The inability to sell isn't so bad after 1-2 seasons because you eventually unlock more merchants, and they arrive on different days (sometimes on the same day). It's really rough and weird compared to other HMs at the beginning though, when you only have 1 merchant.  It's sad that I was actually okay with the week-long tutorial in SoS because the season-long tutorial in A New Beginning was so overwhelmingly unnecessary. Going back to the days when tutorials didn't exist in-game and players instead flipped through the printed manual to find out the controls would be preferable to me because it wouldn't slow down all of the people who already know the basics of Harvest Moon. I mean, after about 20 years of the series' existence, there are quite a lot of people like that."
Games,3dr52z,thejokerlaughsatyou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:04:12 2015 UTC,"A New Beginning gives a tutorial for a whole season? D8 Ughhhh. I just bought that today and started it, and the moment that old man told me to walk somewhere, slowwwwwwly panned the screen to show me where to go, and then told me AGAIN to walk to him, I wanted to throw the game at the wall.

Games,3dr52z,113mac113,4,Sun Jul 19 07:51:34 2015 UTC,Its a lot of fun. But I recommend trying out the older harvest moon games first as Story of Seasons is a slight departure from traditional harvest moon games.

I've played A Wonderful Life and the first one on the SNES, and that was about it. I liked A Wonderful Life a lot more, but that's for the gamecube. If you can get it and play it, I would recommend that one."

In Japan the series will still be named the same as it is there.  Marvelous did not lose rights to develop ""harvest moon""  They lost the rights to publish Bokujō Monogatari under the name of Harvest Moon"
Games,3dr52z,misterwuggle69sofine,3,Sun Jul 19 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"You can also wait to see what Natsume does with the name and if it looks decent support it because competition can be very healthy for a genre that Marvelous has become complacent with due to having none. The video is obviously from a mobile version, and several folks seem to think the WiiU and PC versions will be a bit more robust. There's really no telling yet.  Natsume's first attempt at Harvest Moon wasn't exactly what I was looking for personally, but it certainly had a lot of promise. From what little we've seen I'm not completely convinced they're going the right direction yet, but I'd rather wait and see than bash it before it's even released and crush any hope of Marvelous having to actually try to innovate.  Having to make a new name for themselves was enough for Story of Seasons, but if they don't have any competition for the future they're just going to go back to complacently pumping out the same shit every year. Everyone praises Marvelous, but only a fraction of Harvest Moon games are actually above average."

As a teenager that would just download art from other people and had no skill whatsoever.  Look, I'm not asking for a graphically masterful game that rivals AAA games or anything, but Jesus Christ when you're making a game in 2015 that has a PC release and you can't even make it look better than the ones that came out on N64 and the GBA, that doesn't say ""it's the art style we've chosen for aesthetic purposes!"", it says ""it's the art style we've chosen because we can make new characters and buildings in no time!"".  The main character looks out of place, like he was ripped out of some random game and placed into this one. If you can't even bother to have some consistency in the art style for your goddamn main character, I can't bother to give you a single cent.  And that's leaving all the other issues aside."

The Main Character is taller than the houses. The proportions are ridiculous. Sure, we have the game-y small houses... but the houses are smaller than the people, they couldn't stand in there, or lay on the floor.   This isn't a SNES-RPG-Worldmap, that's your village! All the houses are the same, the central flowerbed is composed of 1 sprite copypasted again and again, the pinetrees have no texture. And... who would build their house so near to another that the edges touch? Upper left corner of the village. I can slap that together in RPG-Maker in 20 minutes.  This really looks ridiculous."

Games,3dr52z,FateCrossing,1 point,Sat Jul 18 21:02:05 2015 UTC,Uhhh... It's really not a port of the original game. It's completely different. It is very similar to A Wonderful Life.
Games,3dr52z,7thHanyou,5,Sun Jul 19 02:03:32 2015 UTC,"I would say the console games --excluding A Wonderful Life, which is very different (depends on the type of gamer you are)-- were consistently good.  So you have Harvest Moon, Harvest Moon 64, Back to Nature (which became Friends of Mineral Town), Magical Melody, Tree of Tranquility, and Animal Parade.  Of those, you may be happiest with Magical Melody or HM64.  They offer similar freedom to Back to Nature with different mechanics.  Tree of Tranquility is very good, but has a lot of oddities that make it difficult to recommend.  Animal Parade is in my opinion probably the best, but it suffers from slowdown, and it takes a very long time to get things done because the game itself is slow-paced even without the slowdown.  But it's the last one I can really recommend.  I would also say Rune Factory 4 is better than anything in the Harvest Moon series.  It has both farming and action-combat, but the farming itself is great.  I've heard good things about the other RF games but haven't played them enough to know what to make of them.  I'd steer clear of all the handheld HM titles."
Games,3dr52z,Ashpup,6,Sun Jul 19 02:07:55 2015 UTC,"excluding A Wonderful Life, which is very different (depends on the type of gamer you are)   Considering /u/IWishIWasAShoe seems saddened that newer Harvest Moon games don't have a focus on farming, I'd assume A Wonderful Life (For Gamecube) is a game he/she'd want.   In my opinion, A Wonderful Life has the best farming mechanics of the series.  Having to get cows pregnant to produce milk, being allowed to create hybrids, being able to harvest seeds from your plants, etc.  The downside is that the game is extremely long and it takes forever to age/progress (until you get the alarm clock).  This is what puts most people off the game, but despite it I actually think it's the most underrated game in the series.  I disagree that ToT and AP are good, but I'm only here to defend AWL!"
Games,3dr52z,mintkupocream,2,Sat Jul 18 20:46:46 2015 UTC,"Everything you said about AWL is spot on.  I have to say that overall, though, the town itself is depressing:  there are almost no festivals, and by the end most everyone is pretty old, and only one other family ever ends up moving in.  The village itself is dying.    That's where ToT/AP really shine: all your rivals get married, AND have kids. There's vitality in your town.  Your kid even goes to school.  There's a real community feeling going on.  Also, you can ride almost any animal, which is hilarious."
Games,3dr52z,Jexdane,3,Sat Jul 18 22:38:29 2015 UTC,"Not to mention a big contribution to the depressing mood was the graphics; the entire game had a very muted brown on grey colour scheme.  10 year old me couldn't understand why that game upset me so much, but 19 year old me realizes it's because everything you just said is right."
Games,3dr52z,Ashpup,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:41:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah A Wonderful Life went for this weird 'mature' theme.  The animals are all realistic, the colors are darker, and even the story is kind of depressing because it's about aging and becoming old.  I kind of like it, in a novel kind of way.  There aren't other Harvest Moon games like it.  Except maybe Innocent Life."
Games,3dr52z,Jexdane,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:49:11 2015 UTC,"Mm. Also it seemed like it rained a LOT as you got older, which didn't help."
Games,3dr52z,7thHanyou,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:37:43 2015 UTC,"There was a rhythm to farming in most of the games, whereas I thought AWL actually lost the focus on farming and transferred it to the story.  Farming felt less like an organic component of gameplay and more like a really, really slow burn that I didn't have any incentive to pursue.  A good town and good pacing make farming meaningful; for this, I think Magical Melody and Back to Nature are the best in the series, as they give you incentive to farm, farm, farm and you feel like you're gaining autonomy.  And while I think Animal Parade may be the best overall, it's definitely not the peak of the series in terms of pacing.  However, I think A Wonderful Life is worse because I can't plot my own course and don't get an instant reward for my hard work, which is what makes most HM games so addictive.  In A Wonderful Life, I felt like I had no autonomy, but was on a straight track through a very specific design vision.  There wasn't really a sense of accomplishment.  That said, I didn't finish it and haven't played it in 7 or so years, so maybe I'm missing things.  I don't know it too well because the 10-20 hours I spent with it were just boring.  But simply adding mechanics doesn't make for better gameplay in my view.  I don't think it's bad, but as someone who's been playing since HM64, it didn't feel anything like a Harvest Moon game.  It's an outlier.  That makes it difficult for me to recommend."
Games,3dr52z,Raichu52,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:54:17 2015 UTC,The problem with A wonderful life if you are thinking about getting it on PS2 is that the frame rate was ass.

While they legally can do it and I understand why since the company has nothing else really notable to their name, its really shady of Natsume to continue to use the HM name to push out their offbrand shovelware  Oh well at least there's Story of Seasons and Rune Factory (If it's still going after bankruptcy)"
Games,3dr52z,tarekd19,3,Sat Jul 18 22:27:12 2015 UTC,"lost Valley could have been so much better if you could use the giant space they give you to build the village, rather than have all the villagers wander around like hobos. Give some life to the space. I thought the locking of the seasons was actually a cool idea as it gave the player a better goal than ""be successful"" with a clear reward."
Games,3dr52z,ryeong,2,Sat Jul 18 18:00:37 2015 UTC,"I love Harvest Moon but Lost Valley was too much of a change for me. I know some people who could embrace the terra-forming and enjoyed the more isolated appeal (more focus on farming, less on interaction), but I couldn't get past that. I'm already wary of this title and it's just not grabbing my attention. Maybe things will be better when it's closer to release? I'd like to see them succeed and hopefully learn from what people didn't care for in TLV."
Games,3dr52z,maxis2k,2,Sun Jul 19 00:15:21 2015 UTC,"To be honest, the last Harvest Moon game I even enjoyed was Friends of Mineral Town.  And even that game had flaws (clock was way too fast, having to use harvest sprites instead of a greenhouse, missable NPC interactions, etc).  Why is it so hard for them to make a new game like HM64/Back to Nature?  I mean, they can even just port HM64 to 3DS and I'd buy it.  Wonderful Life, HMDS and Save the Homeland were so far and away from what Harvest Moon should have been, I just gave up on the series.  And now there's like 10 new games each gen, so I don't even want to try getting in the series again.  You have a 1 out of 10 chance of picking the actual good game.  If there even is one."

Even the demon that was suposed to be torturing me aked me how could i be enjoying that piece of fresh hellish torture that was Hero of Leaf Valley. I only said it was okay.  They are judging and worrying about a game that isn't even near to completion. If we are going back to top down, i say lets do it, those were the best ones.

A good subtitle should let you play something in another language and let what you hear mix with what you read. Such that you can almost hear the voice actor speaking your own language in your head.  I'd much rather JRPG's put forth some effort in giving me some good subtitles than dub it with JYB, Lowenthal, and Liam ""Akihiko"" O'Brian, AGAIN.

Games,3dqqps,tlneondo,37,Sat Jul 18 15:31:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I don't see why the default for film is subtitles but for games it's a dub, to the point where you have to do quasi-illegal things just to hear a game with it's original vocal performances in most cases."
Games,3dqqps,alttoafault,31,Sat Jul 18 19:13:42 2015 UTC,They dub films/shows all the time too.  With foreign films it's usually a question of popularity.  If the movie even makes it to store shelves in other countries.  Buy anime for example is almost always dubbed if it's picked up to be sold in NA.  It would be nice if more games had dual audio support though.
Games,3dqqps,Dullahan3470,5,Sat Jul 18 19:40:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah I guess it's more live-action vs. animated, and games fit more in the animated category. Also, TV shows are more likely to be dubbed than films I think."

For example, I noticed in playing FF XIV, that NPC text chatter that came up in subtitle-form directly obscured the targeting area on a ""trial"" (boss).  This meant that the delivery of plot/mission-relevant information actively hindered performance in the mission.  Similarly, you can imagine a game like ""Amnesia"" that focuses on an atmospheric and dark experience, right?  Well, subtitles have the potential to mess with things like that too.  What might've been a completely dark screen with just a hint of light then has bright white text overlayed saying something like ""monstrous breathing... oooooo... ooooh.""  Those subs might be completely accurate, but they present an experience fundamentally different than the intended one.  In a film, the role of the viewer is more limited, they need to be able to eyeball the action and then possibly read at the same time.  Even some people that like subtitles sometimes feel they detract from the ability to observe the action.  Demands on games can be more complex. This is less the case in something like a visual novel, but it can be a problem in other genres.  As an aside, there are often legal issues with reusing the same voices from say, Japan."

That's a good point and I can see this being a problem for action-heavy games, but for plenty of games like the SMT series this doesn't really come into play.    bright white text overlayed saying something like ""monstrous breathing... oooooo... ooooh.""    That's more closed captioning, not really what I'm talking about here. That said I totally agree, and Netflix was actually doing this for a while with their English subtitles and it was awful.

Games,3dqqps,alttoafault,3,Sat Jul 18 23:48:53 2015 UTC,"You can find references to it online, but I'm mostly referring to a cost factor.  You can find passing reference of this in wikipedia article on editing of anime, for example:   These unedited DVDs sold decently, being purchased by a subset of fans within the wider anime market, but ran into copyright issues regarding Shunsuke Kazama, the original Japanese VA for Yugi Moto, who was under contract with Johnny & Associates, a very strict studio who would not allow anyone use their trademarks.   Voice acting is a larger and more prestigious/protected profession in Japan (I won't say they're necessarily ""better"" as some claim).  That includes stronger copyright protections on works in which they appear.    So, a company that acquires a license for whatever might have to pay extra to have the Japanese vocal track because international release wasn't included in their original payment for the project.  It's a ""legal"" situation mostly in the sense that they have to be paid, really.

Sadly because the main anime demographic in Japan are made up of young adult males you get a lot of gratuitous sexualisation, often called 'fan service' in the anime community.  Most the stuff I listed are more action related.   If you're looking for a pieces of anime which could loosely be called 'artistic' I'd recommend Garden of Sinners.

Games,3dqqps,tlneondo,4,Sat Jul 18 20:39:49 2015 UTC,"While most people agree on the quality of font/color/outlining, there is a large amount of bickering about this topic, mostly between literal translation and localized translation. Japanese is a difficult language that has many emotional/social cues in their language that radically different than those you would find in English so it's not always easy to make a direct meaning.  Some people believe that the direct approach is best; setting meanings as literal as they could be while still retaining cultural context and often keeping Japanese honorifics (-chan, -kun, -sama, etc) and other terms (Itadakimasu) when there is a term that has no proper English equivalent. I am personally a fan of, and mostly make, literal translations because you can easily ""guess"" the meaning behind what is being said.   Other people like to localize their translations, a popular example would be in commie's translations of steins;gate, where they changed Japanese 2ch memes to English 4chan equivalents and rustled the jimmies of most of the anime board on 4chan. Another example would be in mangastream manga translations, where they insert cussing where it doesn't actually exist in order to convey emotional context. This practice feels wrong to me because they largely ignore the inherent Japanese cultural roots of the material which is most of the appeal for anime and manga.  It is very difficult for an American-born English-only speaker to make a convincing Anime story because of all of the subtle sociocultural context that needs to be understood in order to make it. It's not impossible, but it's incredibly difficult without immersing yourself in actual Japanese culture. When you localize a translation, you're replacing the original context with a more familiar version. While this sounds good on paper, what you are actually doing is layering an entirely different culture onto the work, making it feel more like writing a homage or parody of the source material.  This is also why I don't like dub-only games."

And it becomes even more compounded if the joke or statement isn't throwaway. Since if the gag is referred back to as something to show character. It may not make sense in context of the new scene.    And if 90% of the stuff is true to the literal translations because there were no gag's to replace. Then when that American humor or the like pops up it's really obvious and out of place.  The alternative is to then localize a bunch of shit for no reason, adding swearing and the like to ease off the disjointed feeling.    It would be an easier task to retool a novel for english audiences. But with an anime or Manga you are somewhat bound by the physical representations and associated timing."

Why are there people deciding for me what I can or cannot understand? When there are no subs available and I use Commie I am always thrown off by dank memes, colloquialisms, and the disconnect between the Japanese parts that I understand and the subs which are decidedly United States American in flavor. Who is to say that the joke you make up will be anywhere as relevant or even funny as the original content? A fansubber isn't a qualified authority on the original work and has no place making stylistic changes beyond the font and effects, to assume otherwise just makes it feel like the subber is suffering from a case of inflated ego. As a slow translator, I can appreciate the effort that is put into making these things work, but sometimes it really is not necessary and always detracts from the original experience. One thing we can all agree on though is that it's not a simple problem to address."

Being able to be as funny as the original work is definitely an issue, and not one with an easy answer, but I'd prefer if translators were writers, too, if only casually.   Admittedly, I work with literature, where it's a lot easier to move things around or trim up passages.

Also you have to understand that there are a lot of people who simply dont care for / are actively bothered by some of that stuff.

I feel like if a translator localizes the translation it feels like the content gets dumbed down, like people are too stupid to get that ""-san"" is a honorific, or ""itadakimasu"" is something you say before you eat. It also takes away from the experience a foreign film/show gives you."

I even saw one where it was literally set IN GERMANY with German characters and they still did it. They also use a cringe worthy (not necessarily because they're inaccurate, but because the sounds don't exist in German and thus stick out like a soar thumb) American pronunciation/accent for all proper nouns (imagine if all American anime VAs trilled their Rs). It seems so pointless, you can listen to French dubs and forget that what you're watching wasn't actually made in France, it all blends into the sounds of their normal accent.

Keep clauses together, you monsters!  I was impressed playing Loom the other day with text on. Not only did they align the captions to the speakers, but they used colour for individual speakers - the weaver in yellow spoke in yellow, and so on.

It was subbed, but the subs had various visual effects added.  I'm not certain if the assumption was we would be less likely to see a subbed movie without a gimmick or what.  It was mostly ""normal"", but they added bits where the world blood might turn red or certain words had a special ""dissolve"" effect.  If I'm recalling correctly anyway.  I might be conflating it with Daywatch."

So small that your eyes would unfocus when you went to look at them, and everybody speaks in a bloody British accent so you almost need the subtitles. And, not really subtitles, but the dubbing was off, a lot. Oh, and the menu text was unreadable depending on what the background color of the scene was.

Games,3drmej,10GuyIsDrunk,3,Sun Jul 19 00:31:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely for 30 bucks. You don't really need to play Borderlands 1 for 2 to make sense, and 2 retcons most of the important stuff into the story anyways (like Jack).  If you think you'd like Diablo style loot systems thrown into an FPS that doesn't take itself too seriously and is pretty consistently funny then I'd say pick it up. The story for 1 was mostly nonexistent and Borderlands 2 takes everything the first one did and does it much better.  I'd easily recommend it for 30 bucks. The DLC for both games is actually really good too."
Games,3drmej,PowerfulWizard,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:35:44 2015 UTC,"This isn't a popular opinion around r/games but in my opinion Destiny is a far better Diablo-like FPS-RPG than Borderlands. In terms of a single player story line, I would give Borderlands 2 the win on that. In terms of the loot grind, the gunplay, the PVP multiplayer, and the PVE coop? All to Destiny.  Again, my opinion and again, an unpopular one here. But I wanted to toss the idea out there because I wouldn't pay $30 for the Borderlands collection (maybe $20) but if I didn't already own Destiny I would pay $60 for the version that includes all the expansions (including the big on this fall) without a doubt.  All of the reasons I liked Borderlands, Destiny does better."

Borderlands splitscreen play is a blast, and something I sorely wished Destiny supported in some fashion. I haven't yet played the Pre-Sequel so I picked the collection up on this sale to play with my roommate, but I'm sure I'll end up back in Destiny."

It's not perfect, but it's a good old fun RPG so far. The story so far is okay, nothing exceptional and no characters really stand out, but it does have me intrigued and the sheer number of characters with something going on is quite ridiculous. You seemingly can't walk a few feet without encountering someone else to join your ranks. The combat is quite fun, especially with the large party size, but it does feel somewhat easy at this stage, and each party member can only do so much, though that may change. I also quite like the art style, and that your choices seem to have at least some consequence or are brought up later, which reminds me a lot of the trial sequence in Chrono Trigger. Overall, it's quite fun so far.   I also feel the game is helped by being played on a Vita. I love playing old PS1 RPGs on the thing, it's a much more relaxing way to play them and the suspend function is incredibly useful in games such as this which have long quests and time between saves."

To be honest, I got the game in the first place because it was in the Big in Japan sale and I had a little money left in my PSN wallet.

It's ridiculous how much character (pun most likely intended) this game has. It has it all - war, romance, politics, novel little stories, great 2D graphics, sweet music. The only shortcoming I remember was combat balance, it was too easy throughout the game. Definitely a great JRPG overall."

Games,3drfq5,Shardwing,21,Sat Jul 18 22:31:19 2015 UTC,"I finished Golden Sun for the first time the other day, and it was an interesting experience. Mechanically it was a lot of fun, but the story seemed really weak. At the beginning of the game you start out on this epic quest, but it's never really made clear to you why you're doing it, and you only actually encounter the ""main"" antagonists twice in the entire game and then it ends halfway through what the antagonists were trying to accomplish(for reasons you still don't know). The vast majority of the game is just humdrum travelling through the world and dealing with local people's problems. There are at least two separate points where important side plots are revealed to the protagonists, but like the main plot neither of them even approaches resolution. The whole thing just feels like it's shouting ""buy the sequel!"", which isn't a good thing for a game to do.   Speaking of the sequel, it's really frustrating that The Lost Age has been out on the European (and Japanese) Virtual Console since October and there's still no word of a North American release. I know I could track down a used copy or obtain it by more questionable means, but the former's bound to be an expensive hassle and the latter's something I'd prefer not to resort to whenever possible."
Games,3drfq5,Swanzy888,9,Sat Jul 18 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Golden Sun: The Lost Age   I'm going to confirm that the sequel is worth all of the baiting and for that reason it's a shame that Nintendo doesn't see fit to release it digitally. The game's at least 50% longer than the first, with a stronger plot and setting to go with it, and it has more djinn, more cool items and abilities and your party goes up to eight by the end of it. Mostly, it just does Golden Sun's environmental puzzles better and more often and there are tons of rewarding things to explore and do, especially once you hit the high seas.  I resorted to what you are referring to a couple years back and eventually just bought it when I saw it at a used game shop to replay it in my hands. I don't regret either decision.   I do regret buying the third, however. That game's a bust. Don't play it. You don't need to because The Lost Age resolves most everything well enough at its end. Dark Dawn is worse-built and has more than one frustrating lockout point. It also feels like half a game like the first one, only this time it won't be getting a resolution any time soon."

Games,3drfq5,Thrall_So_Hard,81,Sun Jul 19 19:22:57 2015 UTC,"Rocket League - PC  That /r/gaming post convinced me to buy the game, and since last week my friend and I have clocked over 30 hours each. I was skeptical at first, and though that I was overpaying for a glorified arcade game, but holy hell. This game is addictive.  The best game mode is the standard 3v3, which pits little ""RC"" like cars playing soccer. They can boost, powerslide, and more importantly double jump. Essentially what this can lead to is cars flying through the air trying to hit a bouncing oversized soccer ball (think Top Gear) before their opponent. Goals feel satisfying, as does making incredible saves. The gameplay is fast paced, and real easy to get a quick round in as they're only 5 minutes.  It's great if you have a competent group of friends, though you can luck out with the matchmaking sometimes. The downside is sometimes people just crowd the ball like a group of preschool kids playing soccer. Positioning is key in this game, and you can really separate the good players from the bad rather quickly when you notice people who don't just fling themselves at the ball for the sake of knocking it in some direction.  Lastly, I just upgraded from my nVidia GTX 560ti to an MSI R9 390 which greatly helped with card temps. It's summer time and this game runs HOT. My fan on the 560 was working overtime for something that it should've been able to handle with relative ease. This is something I see PS4 people complaining about as well, so I'm not sure if it's just due to poor optimization. Regardless, the 390 stays cool, and silent throughout play now. Side note, I strongly recommend using a controller for this game if you play it on PC. M+KB just won't cut it.  All in all, for $20, it's a steal, and an impressive game built by a team of only 8 people."

My GPU (560ti) was sitting around 70-80 during gameplay, which caused my gaming room to become a literal sauna. BF4 didn't even do that on high settings.

Games,3drfq5,WiseOctopus,18,Sun Jul 19 14:55:48 2015 UTC,"Virtues Last Reward  I bought this a long time ago bundled with 999 and meant to go from one to the other but stopped after 999. Personally I found VLR to be even superior to 999. I felt it had fewer gaping plot holes and was much more interestingly complex and the morality of the situation was interesting. I also liked that the plot twists have been improved this time, 999's twists were either too obvious or came out of left field, this one had a nice middle ground between the two.  Devil Survivor: Orverclocked  I'm currently going through on new game plus and am trying to get the atsuro ending this time around. Apart from that I don't have much issue. I kinda think the game would have been significantly more interesting if the players had the option of having the exp penalty removed by default, which would drastically decrease the amount of grinding needed and make no grinding runs feasible. In fact I intend to do just that later, which is to say doing a run with only the ""no exp penalty"" new game plus buff.  Darkest Dungeon  I like it so far, the aesthetics are fantastics, the narrator interesting, but I don't feel I have enough options. Everything is far too simplistic for my tastes which only compounds the difficulty. I also feel it has some odd ideas for the insanity system. It seems to operate on Call of Cthulu logic but doesn't replicate it properly I think. Call of Cthulu's insanity system was so varied because the sheer bewilderment and inability to comprehend the horrors broke one's mind due to impossible sensory shit. Darkest Dungeon fails here; just being really really stressed out shouldn't make me a kleptomaniac."

It took me a while to get used to the combat style of this series but once I was and it didnt bother me anymore I started to fall in love with it. The neat thing about these two games is that they have two different dev teams, both of whom I have a lot of respect for, and they both have different styles as a result. I am only 9 hours into Kotor 2 I already am enjoying the difference in storytelling by Obsidian. Bioware knows how to make characters that I can fall in love with (Mass Effect, Kotor) and Obsidian knows how to make bleak and dark stories that make me think. The issue I have with Kotor 2 currently is the overall story feels lacking to me and the companions are a bit weaker. Granted I only have a few companions so far. Also what is wrong with Bao Dur's voice. He seems like a super interesting character but his voice is so weak and almost like it is meant to be a joke.

Games,3drfq5,Sabin2k,22,Sat Jul 18 23:35:08 2015 UTC,"Path of Exile  Tried Path of Exile out a few years ago but didn't get very far. Came back for the new Awakening expansion and got sucked in immediately. A few thoughts:   Lag and desync issues are so much better.  Act 4 is great. The second half is pretty iffy, but Daresso's Dream is amazing.  New things(since I last played anyway) like crafting masters are great for both new and old players.   In all the game has become a lot more accessible IMO while still retaining the depth and complexity that's a huge part of its charm.  That said, Path of Exile is not a simple game and while I really enjoy things like drafting builds and making them work this complexity comes with a burden of knowledge that makes it kinda frustrating at times. Even now I'm not sure I fully understand elements of it like trading & currency, while a lot of the more obscure game and item mechanics(does x happen before y, does modifier a stack with b or not, etc) are only explained outside the game. Thankfully the wiki is very well-updated, but I spent quite a bit of time reading up on the game and I'm pretty sure some people don't enjoy that.  What kept me off the game the first time was the frustration of playing a character for a while only to realize that my build just didn't work well or wasn't fun to play. Now that I know more I know better, but I still think that's something that would put new players off.  And this is more of a personal gripe: I really want to play a melee character but I can't find a skill that I like and want to build around. The melee skills in the game all feel super clunky and dual wielding isn't particularly well handled IMO. Ice Crash seems to be pretty effective, but I hate the way it sounds and feels, which is a shame because none of the other skills I've tried seem to match up to its efficiency.  Skyrim (Requiem)  For anyone that likes Skyrim, I'd definitely suggest giving the Requiem mod a try if you haven't. It's a gameplay overhaul mod made with role-playing and immersion in mind, and what it does is that it makes Skyrim a far more cohesive experience while still making the core gameplay a lot more enjoyable at the same time.  I've always put off on Requiem because as an 'all-in-one' gameplay overhaul it conflicts with many other mods, but after spending a week with it I can understand why. Requiem plays quite different from base Skyrim in a good way, and I'd recommend giving it a shot for anyone looking for something new."

I had a good idea of where I wanted to go, when to expect enemies and security, etc., and what weapons I liked.  What I enjoyed was that the difficulty forced me to strategize in ways that I hadn't before. Plasmids like target dummy and security bullseye became hugely important, hiding and picking my shots, running away, using the environment to my advantage. You've got to research, fight only when you can win, and choose your moment. It's awesome and really rewards resource management and sensible choices.  Overall I'd recommend trying this if you're a Bioshock fan. Vita chambers are just a crutch really - quick saving makes them unnecessary.

Games,3drfq5,AdequateSubject,45,Sun Jul 19 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"Psychonauts – Sometimes it’s great to go back and replay an old favorite. This was my fourth time through this game; the first was on a former roommate’s Xbox, and the second and third were on my terrible old laptop playing with mouse and keyboard, so this was the first time that I got to experience the optimal way of playing it now that I have a decent computer and a gamepad. I’ve gotten a lot better at it each time, but this was the first time that I managed to 100% the game (or rather, 101%, I guess) – some of those figments are hard to find! (I had to use a guide to find the last few stragglers; luckily they are individually referenced in the collection screen so you can look them up that way.)  Anyway, Psychonauts is a one-of-a-kind crazy hybrid between traditional ‘collectathon’ 3D platformer and traditional dialogue-heavy point-and-click adventure game, with Zelda-style equipable abilities and boss fights. Taken as a whole, it’s anything but traditional. You play as psychic child prodigy Raz, who has snuck into a summer camp that serves as a secret training facility for child psychics run by the Psychonauts, a group of psychic secret agents. As he goes through the early stages of training in a hurry before he is inevitably picked up by his circus performer parents, signs of a dastardly plot to kidnap the campers and steal their brains start to emerge, and eventually Raz is the only one who is able to deal with it. The game is structured in a way vaguely reminiscent of the standard Mario 64-esque platformer, with an overworld (the summer camp, and later on an abandoned asylum) and separate levels, in this case the subconscious minds of various different people: the instructors at the camp, and the last few inhabitants of the asylum.   The mind levels are fantastical and surreal, and each one is completely different from the others: for example, one level has you smashing a city as a giant monster in a parody of kaiju movies, one has you playing a board game come to life, and another has you navigating a twisted, paranoid version of 1950s suburbia. However, unlike other 3D platformers, while there are tons of different things to collect in each level (and in the overworld), that’s not the focus: each one has a plot with a beginning, a middle and an end, including several with boss fights. There is a definite goal within each mind, whether it’s completing a training course or solving someone’s mental problems from the inside out. I much prefer this to the open-ended but unfocused Mario/Banjo style. The boss fights typically represent the person’s ‘inner demons,’ so to speak (though there are also a couple of real-world boss fights), and usually you have to use the psychic skill (psi blasts, clairvoyance, etc.) that you learned in that level to beat them, sort of like the Zelda ‘formula.’ You also gain an additional ‘brain’ worth of health (mental health!) upon completing each mind, like in Zelda.  As for the adventure game aspects, there is no pointing or clicking, but the fact that each level has a story within the already elaborate main plot is a big part of this. Some of the levels are very action-packed, while others (like the paranoid conspiracy level I mentioned) are all about adventure game style puzzles, including using a basic inventory of items; others are sort of a mix. Also, it’s really impressive just how much dialogue is in this game; you can go talk to all the other fifteen or so kids in the summer camp multiple times, as they’ll be in different places and say different things depending on how far through the game you are – they are all distinct memorable characters, each with their own sets of friends, or significant others, and some go through pretty interesting character arcs. Some of these little scenes are easily missed, but each time I’ve played this game I’ve seen more and more of them – it helps that several of the Steam achievements are for seeing these scenes. And of course, there is plenty of great humor, with this game having been written by Tim Schafer, known for his crazy ideas and quirky humor dating back to the 90s LucasArts games, and Erik Wolpaw of Portal fame.  Psychonauts certainly isn’t perfect, as much as I love it. The main story is a little silly (how come no one picked up on this plot earlier, since it’s clear something’s been going on for a long time?), and some things are never quite explained. The whole thing about Raz’s aversion to water is odd, and it almost seems like they did that in order to avoid doing a swimming animation, though it is worked into the story pretty well. There are also a handful of minor gameplay issues: the platforming mechanics are functional but far from excellent, some of the collectibles are very hard to get to or even see, and the difficulty curve jumps around, especially toward the very difficult final level where it seems like they didn’t playtest it enough (I think I remember reading about that, actually). There’s also a bit of a pacing issue early on, where you have to run around hunting for currency underground through an annoying button-mashing system in order to afford a necessary item. The game redeems itself, though, by being so incredibly charming and unique that it’s easy to overlook the flaws. As weird as the platforming can be, the levitation floating ability helps make things a lot easier. The optional collectibles (of which there are four types each in the overworld and the mental worlds - !!!) are sometimes frustrating, but they’re worth it for the most part: you get to see some of the person’s important memories and even some concept art, and overall they increase your rank, earning you new abilities and upgrades to existing ones. There’s a convenient section in the menu that tells you how many items you have left to collect in the current area, making it easier to track things down. Also, the ‘emotional baggage’ is ridiculously adorable (and they cry with each individual person’s voice!). I am less forgiving of the final level’s notorious difficulty, which can basically be isolated down to one or two spots in a frustrating escort mission and subsequent rail ride, and then another spot in a platforming challenge where the controls and camera seem to fight with you.   Overall, though, Psychonauts is such an incredible combination of tons of different things that I love that even though it is definitely flawed, it’s easily one of my all-time favorites. I hope someday we will see a sequel (Come on Notch! You’re a billionaire now!), or at least another game this ambitious that manages to pull off as many of the things it attempts as this does. I know the public opinion of Double Fine is not great lately, but I still think they are capable of making something this special again."

It might very well be one of the greatest games I have ever played.  One thing that has been bugging me recently with video games is how the storytelling is often way too drawn out and tedious. But Psychonauts managed to completely avoid this problem by making each level its own self-contained and very engaging story while still keeping the main storyline moving forward.  I was also extremely impressed with how great the game looks, considering that it's now a decade old. Goes to show how far you can get with good art direction.  What else? Creative level design, memorable characters, good writing with several laugh-out-loud funny moments as well as some heartwarming and even scary moments (Milla's nightmare room... holy shit!), fun psychic powers with a good progression curve, great music... yeah. Just an awesome game through and through!"

Will probably divorce myself from Persona for the next game though. I have DDS ready to go, so I'll probably give that a whirl.  As for P4 itself, I'm really enjoying myself. The combat is moderately engaging (Normal difficulty) without being too vague for the sake of artificially making stuff hard (looking at you, Megami Ibunroku Persona). The pacing is slow but steady, which works well given the sheer length of the game. If the action and plot had anything faster than leisurely pacing aside from a few intense moments, it would make everything else feel painfully slow, so the consistent slow pace avoids causing stress or boredom.   They don't do the greatest job of explaining some mechanics like Fusion or Social Links at first, although I had it down by three or four hours in. The naming scheme for abilities is more than a little cryptic.

Games,3drfq5,Dohi64,9,Sat Jul 18 20:19:09 2015 UTC,"I finished Shovel Knight from where I had left off the week before and those last few stages were unforgiving (but Plague Knight's music has been on loop for me for the past few days. I never want to do The Expodatorium again but that music almost makes it worth it). I came nowhere near 100%ing it and I think one day I'll go back to complete that goal. Looking forward to the Plague Knight DLC whenever it comes out. All in all, a very solid throwback to Mega Man and Castlevania and I appreciated it.  Ori and the Blind Forest - Beautiful. Part of me wants to leave it there because that's really the only word I can apply to it, but it doesn't even do it justice. The scenery is amazing, the music is top notch, the platforming is very solid. The one thing I was not expecting that, in hindsight I should have expected, was the emotions. The prologue and the ending... ugh. Even thinking about them now I get emotional. Gut punch. I also didn't 100% this because I stupidly didn't heed the 'hey this is the final area' warning. Used to free roamers like Witcher and Arkham, etc, I thought I could go back afterwards. Nope. Definite replay though. I did find some of the precise and timed platforming sequences really difficult and more often than not needed way too many attempts for them. But I don't think this is a design flaw. I'm just not great at them. And they're supposed to be difficult.  Battleblock Theater - Picked it up during the Steam sale for about $1 IIRC and the humour is pretty hilarious. I figured it was done by the same guys who did both Alien Hominid and Castle Crashers just by the animation style and I was right. The humour so far (I'm only just finished chapter 3) is pretty hilarious - the prologue made me almost cry from laughing. Then I found my first Secret. As a game, I'm enjoying it, and I'd hesitate to call it a strict platformer but in another way I think I'm starting to get burned out. I can only do a handful of levels before I need to take a break, which is different from Shovel Knight (breaks of frustration) and Ori (what breaks?) I haven't tried multiplayer yet since my other friends who have it have been busy, but I'm fine soloing for now.  Heavenly Sword - Despite my PS3 being relatively new (when GTAV came out) I Just finally found this used to pick up, something I've been looking for for a while. One of the titles that came out close to launch, very God of War in a lot of ways, different in others, with female protagonists. I just needed something different after the difficult platformers of Shovel Knight and Ori, and Battleblock, so finding it by luck in a used game shop...well, a good old hack and slash it was. For being early day PS3 it still looks really decent (hair tech aside...the hair's a little bad) and the combat is fluid. The motion controls for directing thrown objects threw me off for a little while until the first level where you really needed to use them pretty heavily, and, having to repeat it a few times, I finally got the hang of it. They're still a little awkward but curving arrows is satisfying when they hit. I'm just starting chapter 4 and by my calculations I have ten or so ""levels"" left so I'm hoping to get it done. It'll make it a relatively short game but I don't think I mind that for the price point I got it at."

Games,3drfq5,Omariscomingyo,17,Sun Jul 19 00:19:44 2015 UTC,"Call of duty 4 on pc  I decided to take a break from CSGO which is the game i play most of the time alongside DOTA2 and chill with another fps game. I have heard a lot of good things about this game and how it is the best CoD game but i never understood why. First off let me say i have played the other modern warfare games and i have to say i had most fun with CoD4. I feel like MW2 was ok and MW3 was a bad console port.   First thing that i noticed was the quality of the maps and how they influence the gameplay compared to the newer installments. First off the maps are larger and have many open areas. There are not many corners and tight areas like in MW3 and this makes camping almost nonexistent. Most of the maps are symetrical which gives a good competitive feeling aswell. Most maps have lots of buildings from where you can snipe, and taking controll of them gives you a huge advantage.  The guns are not many but most of them are quite ballanced all around. There are guns which are easy to use  like the m4 or the p90 and guns which are a bit harder but more rewarding like the ak-47 or m16. The only gun which i found to be quite underpowered was the g36c but in the hands of a good player it can still get the job done. I feel like the sniper rifles are in a good spot. You will get killed 90% of the times if you meet an enemy face to face because of the scope in time but at long/mid range they are quite strong compared to the MW2 snipers which were faster and getter at any range. I found the frag grenades to be quite strong. The range at which you can throw them is huge and you will often get deaths from random nades. The gun attachments are quite simplistic: a silencer, red dot and a scope for most guns.   The perk system is pretty much the same. The first perk gives more grenades/rpg rockets/magazines etc. The second increases health/damage or makes you immune to enemy radar. In the third perk there is a bit more variation so there are quite a few ways to play around them as opposed to mw2 where everyone took stopping power for the 2nd perk for example. Killstreaks are basic aswell. 3 kills and you get a radar 5 and you will have an airstrike 7 and a helicopter will help you with air support.  When it comes to the servers, there are plenty of them. The community seems to stay loyal to the game and with the mod support and dedicated servers, there is a handfull of gamemodes to pick from such as deathrun, highjump, hide and seek, promod.

Games,3drfq5,terefor,7,Sun Jul 19 20:20:25 2015 UTC,"terraria: played about 35 hours since 1.3 and we're getting close to hitting hardmode once again, though there are still sky islands to find and I've only been to the jungle to kick queen bee's ass a couple times, so there's plenty of exploration to do still. we've finally started sorting out the warehouse problem, based on our 1.2 organizing system, adjusting it to work with crafting from chests. then it's biome separation time, then wof. the fucking crimson is slowly crawling towards the ocean on the right as is, and it's pretty well integrated into the jungle as well, so I don't have high hopes. been fishing some more as well, mostly in the ocean, got some golden and iron crates that I'll keep till hardmode.  there's an annoying bug that's been introduced (for me) around 1.3.0.4. I play in my monitor's native resolution in full screen but every time I start this game, it quickly changes the resolution to something much smaller then back, so any open windows need to be resized later.  trine 2: the first game is one of those 'you can't be patient enough' titles. I bought it a while after it came out and it took a few more years to actually play it about 3 years ago, then the enchanted edition came out. no big deal, the game's completed and I'm not gonna replay it, plus it was pretty enough in its original form and I didn't mind not having to collect xp orbs, but like I said, sometimes you can't be patient enough.  the sequel is more of the same, only even better-looking, it's really stunning. oh, and there's goblins instead of skeletons. I'm just gonna try and complete every level and get as many orbs and chests as possible with minimum effort. I don't care for collectibles but orbs help unlock more abilities and chests, well, they're kinda pointless, giving concept art and poems but, surprising myself, I've found all of the latter in the base game, except one in an early level, which I decided to replay after I finish the game. had I missed a couple more, especially on later levels, it would've been out of the question. the camera's a bit wonky sometimes and there are points of no return, so missing a few orbs happened even on the first level but I still had more than enough.  I like how user-friendly the game is, btw. you can reset skills at any time (so less orbs are enough to experiment), save anywhere, return to the last checkpoint without resetting your progress, enable subtle puzzle hints after some time (done by the narrator, so it actually adds to the game) and hardcore mode (that I never understood the appeal of) is available on any difficulty. options, love them. not that many in the graphics department though, have to edit the config file manually for those. though I gotta say, as painful as trine enchanted looked with all the bloom when I tried it, it didn't bother me in this one.  after completing the base game's 13 levels, I think it's easier than the first. sure, it had a few frustrating sections and too many portal puzzles, and spiders and acid and fire, but as I remember, I had more trouble with the original. I remember the bonus level there being completely pointless but all the more annoying with its verticality. now I'm doing the 6-level expansion and I hope it won't up the difficulty too much and lets me enjoy the ride. there's actually a 7th level which needs all the chests in the dlc, so I might have to resort to someone else's save file if I can't get them all myself. at least they have a point here.  edit: looks like I jinxed it. the first level of the expansion is more frustrating than the entire base game. wow..."

And for a game that's 8 years old and is continually lauded as aged, I'm a bit surprised it holds up this well.  People complain about the locales, calling them old and over-used, but they're beautiful. The dialogue is a riot, the gunplay is decent (a bit more challenging then people might suspect), and the platforming is incredibly solid.  I'm not entirely finished, but I'm already looking forward to Uncharted 2 and 3. It's cementing itself as one of my favorite IP's as of late.   Pokémon Yellow  Call me a new kid on the block, or a hypocrite since I'm a huge Pokémon fan (playing competitively with the cards and writing for a Pokémon website), but I've never played Generation I. It's always eluded me all these years.  And you know what? It's pretty fun and holds up very well.   People complain and say it needs to be in a more modern engine, but I like how it runs here. I can see why so many people got bite by the Pokémon bug back in the 90's. It's timeless, and It's one of the few(er) retro titles that actually keeps me playing.

Games,3drfq5,SpaldingRx,14,Sat Jul 18 21:56:31 2015 UTC,"Trove  This game came out of nowhere for me. Heard about it years ago after cube world came and went and suddenly this game is now fully released to the public!  To sum this game up, it is a MMO Sandbox that focuses more on the sandbox than anything really. You spawn into a hub, go to a portal which takes you to a generated open world along with a bunch of other people and you just explore. In many ways it feels very similar to cube world but it does differentiate itself a fair bit.  It's an MMO but only in name most of the time. You see tons of people in a massive hub and when you head off into a the world to explore you see other people spawn in at the world origin point but past that, the chances of finding anyone are incredibly rare because the worlds are just so spawling and massive while only ~10 people end up being in the same world as you.  If I could sum up combat it would be ""lacking"" in that there isn't that much going on with it. You only have 4 methods of attack which you get all 4 by level 5. These are a basic attack, 2 skill, and an ultimate ability. Because of this and a complete lack of enemy variety in their attack patterns, fights just play out the same. With my Dracolyte class it's just, run in with flamethrower, throw bombs, detonate bombs, become dragon, burn shit, use fireballs whenever possible.  You get a dodge but that's a lackluster combat maneuver because it's on a fairly long cooldown. At least longer than a dodge should be. Because of this I just dodge 1 attack only to have to stand there for 3 or so seconds waiting for the dodge to recharge while getting my ass beat. However, despite all this it's been enjoyable enough to make me stick with it so far.  One thing I can't say is lacking is the variety in the dugeons the game offers. There are more that I haven't discovered but the creativity and variety in the dungeons you can explore is amazing. From a dungeon that's inside a giant worm which you enter through it's mouth exposed on the surface to an office space that's been made to scale so you're the size of an ant which then reveals itself to be a fake set inside an evil villains lair with the walls lines with maps for their plans for world domination (at least, that's what those things on the wall looked like). It has me impressed often times even if the goal is never different and it's basically ""kill X big guy or survive 2 waves of 4 enemies"".  I also love the charm of this game. It's just a silly experience all around with the way they designed so much of this game from the little dragon familiar who inflated like a balloon when he has is fireball charged up to the dances your companions do along with you. However the charm isn't all perfect. The game revels in it's silliness maybe a little too much and as a result if you're the kind of person who likes making cool looking characters, this might not be the game for you. There are a good amount of cool looking gear, but most of it is things like ""a tank that sits on your head"" or ""deadpools mask"" or ""a giant burger that sits on your head"" which is all compunded by the fact that hats rest on top of your head instead of actually being worn like a hat so all this makes it hard for me to customize my characters to my liking because everything I have looks ridiculous. Thankfully there is an option to hide the equipment anyways so I've spent most of my game revealing nothing. Premium cosmetics are rather lacking as well with most being re-colors of your starter costume.  One problem that is the biggest among them all is that there's nothing really to explore. You run around and fight dungeons but that's about it. No chests to uncover in dungeons, no special thing you can find at all. Everything drops from enemies and if you try and explore or go the wrong way, you just wasted your time. Not only that, loot just sucks. It's all +HP +damage +HP regen and the like with nothing interesting on even the highest rarity gear. Rarity is also something this game has apparently re-designed since it uses the ""common, uncommon, rare, epic, legendary"" system with a few added on after that yet as you get into further areas the loot you can get doesn't really get much better but instead the rarity just improves so by level 7 epic weapons are all trash. I'm at level 19 and even the rank after legendary is all trash to me and I find it everywhere!  I know it might sound like I'm slagging this game off a fair bit, but I actually quite enjoy it. It's an F2P MMO so  get plenty of updates later on (the devs already said they wanted more skill progression) so later on this game will probably be amazing. But for now, if a lack of combat variety and exploring is a bit of a turn off, you might want to avoid this game for now. But hey, it's free and not a very big download at all so it couldn't hurt to try."

Games,3drfq5,krautkid,13,Sat Jul 18 19:58:28 2015 UTC,"Bloodborne  After getting a PS4 and being a huge fan of the Souls series, this seemed like the obvious choice. I'm roughly a third of the way through, and I enjoy it, although I'm not utterly blown away. It appears to take a different approach than any of the Souls games. Being aggressive and close is rewarded much more, and hanging back and being overly cautious is frowned upon (although, as always, being a bit cautious is important). Running/sneaking past enemies is much more of a viable strategy now, even when you're not making the oh-so-familiar mind-numbing run from the last checkpoint to the current boss. The game looks gorgeous, the aesthetic that it brings is unique and enjoyable, and the enemy designs are excellent.  However, there are a few parts of the game which, while I wouldn't say are horrible, are a bit infuriating. Bloodborne, similar to Demon Souls, makes you rely solely on consumable health restores, but imposes a limit on the amount of these consumables you can hold. This doesn't really make the game any harder than giving you a set amount of health restoration items at every checkpoint, like Dark Souls. It's just infuriating. When you run out of consumables, you just go back to an easy area, farm for a bit, and then get back on your journey.  Additionally, it appears that there are quite a few attacks that bosses have that will just flat-out kill you, even at full health. Not huge, dramatic, ten-second-charge-up-time hyper-beam level attacks, but seemingly standard attacks and combos that don't give you a chance to escape or heal. This might just be me (I tend to put fewer skill points into my health than other skills, but I do have a decent amount of health/armour), but it seems unfair, and repeatedly dying in these scenarios kills the mood for me.  Overall though, it's a great game. Maybe I overhyped it a bit too much for myself and am now feeling letdown (especially since Bloodborne was one of the main reasons I bought a PS4), but if you already own a PS4, I would highly recommend picking it up."

I've never felt so satisfied as I did when I finally beat NG+. I can't recall a game in the last ten years that made me feel like that.   I think there is a nice balance of increasing difficulty though in Bloodborne. That it steadily got your skill up to snuff with each section that it was kind of funny the monsters that used to worry me were just kids play by the end when I went back to farm."

Unlike when I played through Y, I decided to do this one without the Exp Share and found this to be a much more preferable approach.  In terms of PC gaming I only just moved my desktop back to my own place so I've fallen pretty far behind on my Steam backlog.

I can't really pin down the reason, but it may be because I turned off the Second Wave options I was using when I upped the difficulty.  Or because I delayed MECs too long.  Probably the Second Wave thing.  Training Roulette and Hidden Potential are tons of fun and really contribute to the game's tendency for emergent storytelling.

It looks great for a DS game and approximates the look and feel of Wind Waker really well while streamlining itself for the handheld.  Tapping enemies to attack is a little too effective and drawing a path for your boat to automatically travel is a little boring, but distances are short and you're generally given a bunch of things to shoot at with your canon to pass the time. The constant use of DS gimmicks keeps the game fresh and gives you new ways to play with old items. Making notes on your map and marking off secrets you can't get to yet is great and should be a feature in every Zelda game. ZeldaU at least should definitely have it with it's suuposedly huge world.  The Ocean King's temple is the game's one point that is almost universally criticized. The idea of a dungeon where you have a limited amount of time to solve puzzles while avoiding unlike enemies is fine, but every time you beat a dungeon you have to travel back and run through it from the start. Most people's enjoyment of the game hinges on how much that bothers them.  I also adore Linebeck. He's corny as hell, but Nintendo had a habit of having partners like Midna be snarky for an hour or so before playing a smaller role and Linebeck just remains this cowardly jerk who's just using you for most of the game and it makes me smile with how silly his dialogue is."

Just starting it, but slowly building up my troops is fun, and the gameplay system generally seems as close as possible to the console version while making some concessions for the PSP.   The story is well-acted when there's voice-acting, with Hayter making his last appearance before Old Snake (apparently) damaged his skills at voicing Snake. It follows logically on from MGS3. The only problem I have with the story is that Campbell being in it is a bit too far for me.  I've heard common gameplay problems are the awkward camera control and dragging men around to recruit them, but to me, the camera isn't a huge problem and dragging people around can make for some tense moments. Dragging people to your teammates' boxes kind of made me feel like I was really working as a team, and a soldier with the Rescuer stat being a necessity encouraged me to manage my squad. (Though I'm a sucker for base-builder's anyway).  Besides those two problems, why do people dislike Portable Ops so much? Does the endgame utterly fall apart? Is it because Kojima wasn't directly involved in it? Did Peace Walker just improve everything so much that in comparison to it Portable Ops is terrible?"

First off:   Witcher 3 - I'm really enjoying the game and the story overall, but it's so overwhelming, and I must be one of the few guys that don't go out of their way to pick up a quest. True, I do side quests since they are somewhat interesting and unique up to certain point, but I don't really go to a particular place just so I could take a quest with me. For now, I paused my Witcher 3 gameplay since I wanted to wait for new patch - (1.07). I was experiencing ocassional pop-ins regarding NPC-s and some stuff wasn't rendered properly, so I hope this patch fixes most of these problems.   Wolfenstein The New Order + The Old Blood   Played both, finished both. First one is better than the standalone 'mini' expansion, but I liked them both equally nonetheless. Second one has it's own charm, and I enjoyed the story for the most part. However, it felt rather short to me, or maybe I just didn't pay attention to time at all. When people say that it's 12-16 hours long, do they mean with both storylines including Fergus and private Wyatt or what?

Games,3drfq5,Pwnclub,9,Sun Jul 19 03:06:26 2015 UTC,"Long Live the Queen   Not sure if it counts as a game, it's more of a visual-novel/choose your own adventure book, but it's on Steam so I'll talk about it. I kinda like it. It's cute and charming and funny for the most part. I've done two runs so far, and I've died in both of them. How the game works is that you play the role of a Princess, and you must survive 40 weeks of various events in order to be correnated as Queen. To survive, you alter your mood to give you bonuses to classes, which increase your skills. You then use these skills in various skill checks, some of which are guaranteed and some of which change based on your actions and choices. For example, because of my actions in my second-run, I ended up in a war with another nation. Due to the fact that I had a high strategy and medicine skill, we did very well in the war. I then was challenged to a duel by a noble who I ticked off, and got stabbed. Lovely, survive a war to die in a fight. The game is entirely conversation based, with small icons for certain characters. There is no voice-acting, and while that doesn't ruin it for me at all, I do think it'd be funny if there was some intentionally awful voice-acting, over-acted or completely dry or something. The art is anime style, and it's... not the best, but it's serviceable. The actually lore of the world is suprising, there's quite a bit to it - the skills have a 100 point limit, and every 10 skill points, you receive a little tid-bit of information about the skill increasing, for things such as history or internal affairs - you learn about the world you inhabit, and it's pretty cool, especially stuff about magic. Overall, if you like reading and dying, worth a shot.  Mount and Blade: Warband  On the other hand of being royalty, it's impossible to die in M&B, but boy do you fight a lot. This really is a great game, and if you have even a passing interest in medieval stuff, melee-based combat or dynamic worlds you should check it out. To lay the picture, I'll explain the story of my character, which has happened over the course of 2 in-game years. My character was an impoverished noble from another land, banished following the death of family members tragically. He arrived in the Kingdom of Rhodoks, a kingdom of mountain and hill people, well trained in the use of spears and crossbows. There, he assembled a small fighting-force, and sought out justice across the land, killing bandit and looters, and aiding small villages. Despite his noble beginings, he resisted the urge to sign up with the local king, however - after economic downturn, he gave in - he swore himself a vassal to King Graveth, who welcomed him happily due to his skill in arms and good reputation. He was rewarded with a fief of his own, and eventually helped in the conquering of much of Calradia, taking many towns and castles, some of which he was awarded to, giving him a nice steady, income. I just wiped out 2 other factions, having just been made Marshall - however I grew sick of it, I gathered my best soldiers from their garrisons and renounced my oath. Then, I took a very weak factions city, and started my own faction - New Chivalyr, took a few more cities, and now I have my own growing empire. I plan on only letting noble and honourable lords join, but I imagine that as I get larger, things are going to go south fast.  The best thing is, all of that stuff is dynamic - I could lose everything if the other factions decided to work against me, I could lose all my army, all my fiefs - and have to rebuild my entire army over again and re-conquer it all, or just sign up to a different nation and conquer everything for them. There's a demo on Steam, if you haven't you really should try it out."
Games,3drfq5,ApertureLabia,26,Sun Jul 19 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"So I've actually been playing quite a few games this week. Here are my impressions of them.   Sid Meier's Pirates!- This Steam game lets you be a pirate in an epic adventure. There are  several components to this, there's fights that can occur when you attack boats or some special events, there's a dancing mini-game that you do to get information from the daugthers of governors, there's treasure hunting where you have to use landmarks to locate loot on land and there's city raids. Between doing all of this you sail across the vast ocean (the map is actually quite large) and visit cities where you can buy stuff from the merchant, repair your ships, etc. At first, when I played it I had a super fun time. It felt awesome to be a pirate. I was making  good progress, saving my family members and becoming the #1 pirate. You get fame points for doing tasks, and as you can retire at any time (and forced to retire when you're too old), your goal is to get as many points as possible, arcade style. But after around 10 hours into my first game, I started to lose interest. First off, once you've danced and fought a couple times, there's not much else different in the game. Pirates! lacks variety, and you end up doing the same thing over and over again. The dancing mini-game is also considerably more difficult than anything else in the game. During fights I litteraly only have to do the slash attack over and over again to win, while dancing is almost impossible as it requires insane reaction time. Having to sail in the  direction opposite of the wind is a pain, as it slows you down to a crawl. I'm going to try to finish my first game and then maybe try a higher difficulty, but it's not as fun as it was at the beginning.   Grim Fandango: Remastered- This game is a point and click adventure game by Double Fine Studios. I've wanted to play this game for a while as it was considered to be a masterpiece to many, but unfortunately there was no legal way of acquiring it on PC. But now that it's on Steam, I can finally see what I've missed. To keep it short, it's a fantastic game. It's hardly a Remaster though- the only thing updated were the character and item models. Sometimes it's very difficult to figure out what to do because the logic is weird, so I felt no guilt when I occasionally had a look at a walkthrough. But for me the highlights were the amazing characters and the brilliant script. Whenever I have a conversation with someone in the game, I go through every possible option to hear their witty replies. I'm on Year 3 of 4, and I am having a great time. I highly recommend to pick Grim Fandango up if you've never played it before.     Uncharted 2- sigh... I know this isn't a popular opinion at all, but I thought this game wasn't great. Does it have good voice acting? Yes. Is it gorgeous? Yes. Is its soundtrack enjoyable? Yes. But when it comes to the gameplay, I found it to be lacking. The majority of the game is climbing and shooting. The jumping around is very straight forward, and I felt as if it didn't demand skill but mostly involved you pointing the analog stick in the right direction and pressing X occasionally. How I miss games like Prince of Persia: Sands of Time... Then there's the shooting which is mostly done behind cover. At first it's kind of fun, but after the thirtieth time you've done it it begins to lose its flavour. There's not that many opportunities for stealth, so all you basically do is point at the guy you want to kill and shoot. It's kind of ironic how the ""good guy"" murders hundreds upon hundreds of people. The game also has puzzles, but that is barely worth mentioning. There were three puzzles that I counted, and two of them can be solved by looking at your journal and seeing a picture of what you have to do. So overall, by the end I felt it was a chore to finish off the game. I didn't like this one.      Note: I'll add two more as soon as I have time.     EDIT:  Dark Souls- I'm sure you've all heard of this game- it's a third-person metroidvania adventure game of sorts. It's famous for its difficulty, but many reviewers say that it still remains fair. I disagree with this. I think Dark Souls is a brutal, unfair game. There are moments that there's no way you can predict without previous knowledge, for example, after I beat the second boss, I walked through a bridge that a dragon flew at, blew fire, and killed me in one shot, restarting me at a checkpoint far away. If you kill the extremely important merchants and blacksmiths, as well as other NPC's, they never respawn, yet when you kill all the enemies in an area and you decide to reheal yourself at a checkpoint, they're all back. There are important objects behind invisible walls, and there are NPC's that if you do kill drop useful loot. People can leave hints in your world, but 90% of the time they're absolutely useless and are jokes. The ""YOU DIED"" screen will pop up over and over again as you try to get past an area with tons of baddies or to beat a boss, and often you lose a lot of progress as well as the Souls you collect. Sometimes the hitboxes are glitched and you get hit unfairly which results in your death. Dark Souls, is in fact, an unfair and cruel game. But I love it. I really do. I haven't played too much of it (like 10 hours) but I've come to appreciate the great level design and the mysterious backstory to the world you are on. It's really brilliant and one of the most satisfying games, as taking down one of the many truly epic bosses produces a great feeling in you. Some people criticize modern Japanese games, but stuff like Dark Souls and Shadow of the Colossus prove that there are still amazing ones being made.   Rayman Legends- I've been playing this platformer for a couple days. It may seem childish and silly at first glance, but you know what, I really do think it is one of the best games on the Wii U. The artstyle is great, the soundtrack is as well, level design is unique and creative, collectibles aren't a chore to collect but are actually really fun, and it does become more challenging later on. The 2-player mode works very well and it doesn't feel as an unnecessary addition. The gamepad is utilized for around half the levels to help the second player (whether it be human or a CPU), and it feels so natural that I can't really imagine how the versions on the other consoles can be as good. The music levels are AWESOME and are definitely the best part of the game, and work as a reward for completing each world. Rayman Legends pleasantly surprised me, and if you have a Wii U and you don't have this game, make sure to change that!     I have several new games I am planning on playing this upcoming week, so I'll be sure to leave a comment in next week's thread. :D"

Games,3drfq5,JHMRS,2,Sat Jul 18 22:00:33 2015 UTC,"Something hard to notice if you are not looking for it is how excellently remastered the sound and music are in Grim Fandango. That is how it's supposed to be with sound design i suppose^ Like in Alien Isolation, if you pay attention to it you'll notice how important, if not the most important, the sound engineering is - if you take in the game as a whole, you'll not even think about how hard that must've been to pull off.  Dark Souls... I'm 40 hours in and I have the biggest boner about this game. It gives grown-up me those feelings of wonder and achievement that Zelda games gave me as a kid. 10 OUTTA 10"
Games,3drfq5,smileysocks,4,Sat Jul 18 21:53:30 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls is a hard drug. It's really bad for you, it brings a lot of your negative aspects, particularly anger, but the high you get is unlike any other.  There's really no equal feeling to beating a particularly though area, after you've gotten your ass handed to you over and over. It was not the devs that did it, it was not luck. It certainly wasn't your gear. IT WAS YOU AND YOUR SKILL.  So you'll keep coming back to it, even though you hate it, even though IT'S RIDICULOUSLY UNFAIR TO HAVE FUCKING ARCHERS WITH ARROWS THAT FUCKING KNOCK YOU BACK WHEN YOU BLOCK, JUST WHEN YOU HAVE TO TRAVERSE A FUCKING RAZOR THIN LEDGE, WITH NO RAILWAYS, RIGHT AFTER FIGHTING HORDES OF MONSTERS, SO FAR AWAY FROM A BONFIRE, AND YOU KEEP FALLING BECAUSE THE MOTHERFUCKER ROLLING MECHANICS MAKE YOU ROLL AWAY FROM THE LEDGE!!, but you know that when you beat it, ah, you're THE man, they tried their cheapest and their best to literally and figuratively knock you down, and they suceeded for some time, but YOU had the last laugh!  Ahem. What was I saying again? Oh yeah, it's a hard drug.  Git gud you fuckin casul."
Games,3drfq5,Krystie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"The original Grim Fandango had tank controls, no point and click. That is a huge reason to play the remaster in my opinion. It is far easier to play as a point and click."
Games,3drfq5,tmiller3192,1 point,Sun Jul 19 00:11:58 2015 UTC,"About dark souls: Is there any specific point in the game that you're stuck ?  There are superb wikis and guides for dark souls if you're struggling anywhere.  I agree that constantly dying, losing souls and enemies respawning can be frustrating (in dark souls 2 your hp gets lower and lower every time you die). But once you figure out the mechanics it really shouldn't be too hard. And when you level up and upgrade your gear enemies will die a lot quicker. The boss fights are tough, but generally satisfying. Very few of the fights in dark souls have cheap mechanics."
Games,3drfq5,FerralOne,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"I honestly never got the hype about the Uncharted games. I played through the first 3 and I did enjoy them, but they didn't blow me away. The action scenes are cool, some of the locations can be interesting, and Nathan Drake is an amazing character (probably the best part of the game), but it feels very generic. Combat especially."
Games,3drfq5,SirDingleberries,4,Sun Jul 19 12:09:04 2015 UTC,"Bayonetta 2 - Bought it awhile back, started playing the first game that was bundled with it, and quit for awhile after I got pissed at a level about 10 hours in. Started playing again recently, and it's stellar. It surprised me with constant new gameplay mechanics, boss mechanics, enemies, and really just lots of fresh content in general. It never felt stale. Even now, having ""beaten"" the game, I still play to get more unlocks and increase my ranking. Overall worthy purchase and play"
Games,3drfq5,ToomeyTime,4,Sun Jul 19 13:34:12 2015 UTC,"CS:GO - I'm putting in way more time into this game than I was expecting to ever have (112 hours in about 1 month of owning it). I've even bought a few skins that I either liked or found obnoxious looking (Griffin M4 baybay). Definitely looking forward to playing more, and maybe building up a collection of skins for all the weapons I use, and maybe some betting on the side.  Skyforge - Crashes on start up because my keyboard is plugged in. 11/10 GOTYAY+GOTGAG  Wario Woods (SNES) - Was feeling bored, so I started playing this game from my childhood. I've got to wonder how I cleared Round Game (100 levels of increasing difficulty) when I was a kid. When you get into the 80s, it's damn near impossible to clear a stage."
Games,3drfq5,ThePatrioticBrit,4,Sat Jul 18 20:13:47 2015 UTC,"I been trying to play through the games I bought in the steam summer sale, and have been pleasantly suprised by some of the games I bought especially Shadowrun: Dragonfall.  Having never been into the shadowrun lore, or really liked any tactical RPGs, I totally have fallen in love with the game. The combat reminds me of XCOM, and the way that conversations have real affects on how thew story progresses is really interesting. I have have made some teammates hate me, and others love me through my choices.  The story is really interesting, and in away reminds me of Artemis Fowl in the way that technology and magic are part of the world. I recommend that any RPG fans grab it in the next sale, since the game drops to so cheap and is worth every penny.    I have also gone back to Borderlands 2 this week, since when it originally came out I put about 200 hours in console. I almost immediately found how much better this game was from the Pre-Sequel, but I do miss some of the mechanics like double jump. Finally getting to some of the DLC characters like Krieg have really made the game interesting again, and for the six dollars I paid in the steam sale is well worth it."

Games,3drfq5,GeraltSushi,5,Sat Jul 18 20:34:07 2015 UTC,"Crusader Kings IIObviously I got this purely because of the Game of thrones mod, but so far have only used the vanilla map to learn the controls ect.. I had been waiting for ages to dip my toes into this game, but the difficulty of it was so off putting. However, with the recent 10$ sale, it was enough to convince me to go ll i and buy it. Honestly, I only have about 8 hours in this game so far, but it is just insanely deep and complex, and I'm having a blast. I started as a lowly king of Ireland after some advice from /r/crusaderkings2 , and ended up starting a civil between my allies and the other states of the country, with me as a combatant on neither side. I plan on waiting for the war to draw to a close, conquering the victors(weather they be my allies or not) and castrating, blinding, and imprisoning their leaders and extended family to prevent a uprising. It was really entertaining going from total war's simplistic overhead map of moving armies, to actually focusing on relationships and dynasty building. I know these threads are basically ""recommend me a game"", But Crusader Kings II is an amazing game for me. On the flaw side however, 90% of important content like character creation and standing armies are contained in DLC, and if you are looking for a fast paced action orientated game, this is not for you."

Games,3drfq5,gamerexq,8,Sun Jul 19 01:14:23 2015 UTC,"I just got an Xbox One, so I played some Killer Instinct.  This game should be the example that all other fighting games follow when it comes to teaching you how to play the game and how the systems work.  I just booted up Street Fighter IV again, and I still can't finish the trials for any character, even though I think I'm putting in the sequence correctly.  It would be nice if it at least told me ""too early"" or ""too late"" when it comes to giving it those inputs, or if it gave me a general description of what I need to do to pull it off.  After that tutorial in Killer Instinct, I'm confident that I know what I need to do to get better in the game.  On PC, I've been playing Batman: Arkham Knight, and feel about the same about this game as I do about Arkham City, in that the open world is not an improvement over Asylum.  I get that they wanted to incorporate the bat mobile in a big way, but I don't think tank combat was the way to do it.  The bat mobile puzzles and car chases were a good way to go about it, but they rely on those tanks quite a bit, and it doesn't fulfill that Batman fantasy.  I've also been playing The Masterplan, which is pretty close to my perfect heist game.  It doesn't have much in the way of story or characters, and the Steam Workshop and local co-op support won't be in the game for at least a few months, but the levels and challenges this game does have are really fun.  I really wish there could be a game that was a cross between this and GTA V's heists.  That would definitely be my perfect heist game."

Games,3drfq5,ThePatrioticBrit,7,Sun Jul 19 11:56:34 2015 UTC,"LISA PC  Finding this game was pretty random for me. I believe I saw a post here that talked about it so out of curiosity I went to the Steam Store page and noted it had very good reviews. And then I watched the trailer and had to buy it.  It's a 2D side-scrolling RPG set in a post-apocalyptic world where almost all women are gone - and then you find a little baby girl. I won't spoil anything story-related beyond that.   This isn't just any post-apocalyptic world - this world is ruthless and fucked up. You will see some things... some really messed up things. And you will have to make choices where there's no right or wrong - only bad. Then you have to decide for yourself which choice you can live with - and these choices will have permanent consequences. There's little mercy in this world.  The gameplay is pretty simple. Talk to people, find stuff in order to progress, battle messed up people. The battle is quite entertaining - often because of the vastly different characters you pick up along the way, but the enemies are quite varied and often entertaining as well. But the best thing about the game is absolutely the world it's set in. It's repulsive, ruthless, fun and amazing all at once.  I'm quite surprised how well this works and how all-out the people behind it have gone. Also the soundtrack is fantastic. Weird, varied, funky, annoying, and a perfect match for this game.  Seriously, if you like this kind of RPG and is feeling ready for a messed up experience - go pick this up. I'm currently ~5 hours in and have only just reached the second area (out of 3 I think?), so there seems to be a good deal of gameplay time for your money as well."

It's breathtakingly beautiful, and while I thoroughly enjoyed the combat, atmosphere, and lore of Bloodborne/Dark Souls 1, the vivid colors, fantasy book-esque locations, and open world gameplay are really giving me a great new experience. It almost feels like there's too much to do, yet it feels exciting to tackle it all all the same....  Since my rig is starting to show its age, I got it for PS4 though.

I had stopped somewhere in early Chapter 1 and just completed the Chapter 2 Prelude. To be honest, the whole experience is not that great so far. The level geometry is annoying, combat is just roll and hit (I'm playing on Normal), and the VA is just so empty and emotionless. The only characters who appear to have any emotion are Triss and the dwarves. (I did the romance thing with Triss in the elven bath house and man was that weirdly soulless)  I'm not versed in Witcher lore or anything so a lot of the story is going over my head, especially when Chapter 2 started, which means a lot of pausing to go read journal entries. I had no idea what was going on during the prelude - apparently there's some sort of black fog and zombie skeletons are trapped to battle for eternity? Apparently the sun had blacked out but I couldn't tell because even on Ultra the graphics in the cutscene aren't pulling their weight. And there's a dying prince and some sort of Wonder Woman? I have no clue what's going on. Not to mention the fact that the only way to make significant cash in this game seems to be endless herb picking, and it doesn't matter anyway because the merchant charges an arm and a leg for just about everything.

The cutscene just leapt around with no clear distinction between plot points and then suddenly turned to the sky which was supposed to be darkened, but it was just a big patch of blue. I'm pretty sure it's not the graphics settings because I'm running everything on Ultra and I hope it's not bugged because I can't be bothered to do a reinstall."

But TW 3 is an entirely different beast. It's absolutely amazing and does a way better job of clearly laying out what's going on in the universe. I felt much more connected to the events happening in TW 3 then I ever did in 2.  Good luck!
Games,3drfq5,What_Is_EET,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:10:54 2015 UTC,"I'll try to clear up some lore for you while not spoiling anything else. I'm not gonna explain the whole universe but just give you a general overview of the second games story.  You're main area of concern is the big four Northern Kingdoms. There is Redania, Temeria, Aedirn, and Kaedwen. There is also a bunch of lesser kingdoms around them, refer to this map. At the start of Witcher 2, the King of Aedirn is assassinated, which can be seen in this trailer. After that happens, Aedrin(The territory above the yellow Kingdom on the map) is a mess without a proper claimant to the throne so a sort of rogue army is set up made of different races and they are being led by a girl called Saskia. (That is the wonder woman I think you are referring to.) The King of Kaedwen sees this as a chance to crush this rebel group and take the land for himself. The assassin kidnaps your friend Triss and you follow his trial to help her. Then act 2 starts.  The two opposing sides are meeting at the start of Act 2 to discuss a resolution as far as I remember.  Someone activates the eternal battle curse which pretty much resurrects all the souls that were involved in a huge battle years ago, and they are to fight eachother eternally until you somehow break the curse. You will learn more about how this curse was set as you go. If I am correct this was a battle between Kaedewn and Aedrin years prior.  I am not sure who the dying prince that you are referring to though but I haven't played in a while so this is all off the top of my head. Let me know if you have any questions. Sorry if it's all over the place i'm sure I missed a lot of stuff."

Every class is viable and there's a lot of emphasis on gameplay. It's free and so far I've been having a blast. The f2p elements aren't too bad, and for the most part I don't have many complaints. There are a few too many loading screens and phantom is a little too good for a stealth class, but I'm hoping those get ironed out. I hope the game gets more popular!"

I love the new traps and levels, although a bit clunky the ability to share custom made levels is excellent and I can imaging the longetivity it'll lend to the game. I can't stop laughing at some of the more humiliating traps and chaining large trap combos is really satisfying. Scratches both my strategy and puzzle game itches. I see other players finding the quest mode getting tedious, but coming from Blood ties I really like the focused (wining condition & three bonus conditions that'll unlock different abilities) nature of quests. Some good challenges and enjoying the story also."

LOTR: Shadow of Mordor and Batman Arkham Knight   Got Shadow of Mordor with Xbox Deals with Gold for $20. With all the fall games last year I held off on it then. I was halfway through Batman when I bought it. Batman is a great game and I'll get back to it soon, but I've been hooked on LOTR for a week. I haven't gotten very far, it's just a lot if fun.  The player movement and traversal is extremely quick and responsive, and the combat is fun and challenging when facing a lot of enemies. The combat in the games is pretty similar. The Batman series really got something right with the attack/counter/dodge mechanic. The story in Batman is darker, which is great. Graphics are solid. I don't hate the Batmobile as much as most people do, though it does get annoying when you have to fight a bunch of those big tanks that you can only kill by hitting a spot on its back. The freedom in both games is attractive to me. I'm an explorer when it comes to open world games. I love all the small details about having an open world, like the orcs having their own agendas or all the DC easter eggs in Batman(billoards, buildings etc.). These two games will keep me busy for awile."

Games,3drfq5,rxninja,3,Sat Jul 18 21:51:34 2015 UTC,"killer7 - Well, after going through hell and back to get this game working on my Wii with a broken reader over the course of this last week I can confirm that all that effort was worth it.  After being reminded of the existence of this game via this song of the soundtrack I decided to finally check the game out as a personal introduction to Suda51 games. After attempting to play the game for 1 hour with a keyboard using Dolphin (wich wasn't precisely a success, so to speak) I dusted off my Wii, did some *CENSORED* playing the game!  The game plays like a juxtaposition of the movement of a linear rail shooter and the shooting of RE4, taking on the role of the Smith crime syndicate/manifestations of the 7 multiple personalities of a godlike figure/uhhh... on their mission to eliminate a target while being confronted by the terrorist organization/freaky smily things called the ""Heaven Smiles"". You can (most of the time) switch to any of the 6 main assassins, most of which play wildly different and significantly alter your gameplay, like the Revolver using Dan or the knife-throwing Kevin.  Instead of moving with an analog stick through the level, you can only move along preset paths, with your only options being going forward, doing a 180º spin and choosing which way to go when encountering an intersection. While this may seem unnecessarily clunky it instead meshes perfectly with the gunplay, on which you hold the R trigger to enter a first-person view to aim with the analog stick. The game rewards precise shooting, with most enemies having a highlighted Achiles heel that will insta-kill him when shot at, and reward more resources (thin and thick blood, to heal and use special attacks, and to upgrade the assassins respectively) that you would get by just gunning down an enemy. The catch is that the limited movement and the frequent reloads due to the low magazine size of most characters you can get cornered really easily by tactically (and literally) suicidal enemies, who explode on contact and take of a great chunk of health, making good positioning and twitchy aiming a necessity on harder levels. While hard to get used at first (specially on a keyboard), downing a horde of enemies which are literally on your face with a single mag by hitting all the crit-spots is probably one of the most rewarding things on videogaming.  Level-wise the game still manages to make explorable levels with puzzles ala RE4 even with the corridor sistem. Most puzzles require the use of specific items or engravings easily found around the level, and some others require using your characters skills (like jumping a 3 meter wall or going invisible to go through a security sistem). All in all, while fun they are not that hard, and even then the game likes to give hints like it was Christmas, even when you are playing on a difficulty which states to have ""no hints"". The levels itself are varied enough not to be bland but not baroque enough to distract you from the action. The fixed camera angles lead to some interesting angles, similarly to the REmake of RE1.  Story-wise this is probably one of the best, most complex and at the same time weirder stories ever made. Because I don't want to spoil anything I'll just mention that the FAQ which explains all of the game plot probably takes 1 or 2 hours to read, which in itself is pretty ironic (or intentional?) that a game with this simplified control scheme has such a contrived plot. Special mention to the writing of all the characters, with each of the assassins and ""spirits"" you meet having incredibly amounts of personality even when they only get at most 3 lines in the whole game (like Coyote and specially Kevin) or to just server as the best exposition-dump giver ever (like the local MVP Travis which resembles too much that other Travis to just be a coincidence).  The soundtrack is just the best thing ever. Like really, just listen to tracks like the previously mentioned Rave On (which I award the prize for best ""Wasted Song"" of that decade) and Sweet Blue Flag (Spoiler).  All in all this game enters easily my personal Top 10 if not Top 3 of games called Killer7.  Tl;Dr: Literally the best thing to ever grace this planet.  Also, to people who have played other Suda51 games, which one would you recomend me as a follow-up?  Spoiler"
Games,3drfq5,DarkLiberator,4,Sat Jul 18 22:17:23 2015 UTC,"Hohokum (PS Vita)  This game came out a while ago and I didn't have the money at the time, so I was thrilled to see it on PS+ recently. I only recently had a chance to check it out.   I truly have no idea what I'm doing, but it's an audio-visual feast, it's super relaxing, and everything in the game's world feels interactive and responsive.   You play as a...line, I guess? A flying snake? You play as colors with an eye at the end and you fly around. There are interconnected ""levels"" that each have objectives in them that aren't immediately obvious.   For instance, I was flying around this floating city where I could pick up people by flying past them. They would then ride on the flying snake, dancing around and having a good time. After a few minutes, I realized that there were some specific people that wanted to go to specific places. After picking up a few and finding pieces of something, I discovered that I was finding pieces to rebuild a roller coaster. Upon finding all the pieces and putting them back together, I unlocked a thing (I won't say, because I enjoyed that discovery moment and want you to, too) that was clearly the level's objective.   There was no Na'vi or anything telling me where to go and the game barely spent two minutes telling me what the controls were. There was nothing about what the controls really did once they were vaguely explained. The game is pure, magical, colorful discovery with an excellent soundtrack. It's the kind of game where you want to get comfy in a dark corner of the house, throw on some headphones, and get lost for an hour or two.   If you need a guided gaming experience, avoid this one. On the other hand, if you like your immersion to include a lack of a babysitter and a healthy appetite for unknown adventure I'd highly recommend it."

Games,3drfq5,Velenne,3,Sat Jul 18 23:34:25 2015 UTC,"Alien Isolation  I just got it on sale and, whilst I haven't run into the Alien yet, it's really good so far. Visually it's incredible and (minus a few animation glitches) the characters are surprisingly lifelike, enough for me to notice it anyway. The game oozes atmosphere and I've been largely immersed. Rather than searching every nook and cranny like I were playing a game I've been trying to push forward, finding what I can.  Kerbal Space Program Demo  Another awesome space game (though this one is very different). I'm still learning but I think I may well buy the game once I've reached Mun (and probably when it goes on sale). I've already learnt so much about how orbits work and I'm pretty happy with my rocket-building skills (though there are some things which I haven't been able to figure out how to use).  XCOM: Enemy Within  Yet another really awesome sci-fi game. I'm on the last mission now (I stopped halfway through because I was scared for my soldier's lives) but I'm already planning on doing some kind of robot-only run which would entail rushing S.H.I.V.s and MECs then using them exclusively (maybe a single human if necessary). This game's awesome, it's my first strategy game (ignoring the thirty minutes I played for UFO: Enemy Unknown), I've had a lot of fun with it and I plan on continuing the fun with more difficult runs and multiplayer."

Games,3drfq5,lazarus22,3,Sun Jul 19 08:52:21 2015 UTC,"Sunset Overdrive (One)  More specifically I played through the two story DLCs: The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machines. Mooil Rig was okay, but nothing really special, though more Sunset Overdrive isn't a bad thing. I kinda felt the whole thing was also setting up the boss being named the ""DL Sea Monster"". Fallen Machines, on the other hand, was fantastic. It changed the gameplay up in fun ways, it had the best boss fight to come out of Sunset Overdrive, and the new characters were really funny. I highly highly recommend Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machines to people who enjoyed Sunset Overdrive.  Dead Rising 3 (One)  Similarly, I'm going through the story DLC on this. I've finished Operation Broken Eagle and I'm like halfway through Fallen Angel.  After this is Chaos Rising and The Last Agent. Dead Rising 3's DLC is okay, but nothing really super special. It's more Dead Rising 3. If you got the DLC when you picked up the game (the Steam version comes with it, and if you buy it now I'm pretty sure the One version does as well) then it's worth going through. I don't think I'd want to spend $10 on them though.  Zoo Tycoon (One)  I dunno man I just wanted to build zoos. Gamefly sent me this. It's there. I can build zoos which is fun I suppose. Can't play for more than like an hour though because it's boring after that. Probably going to send it back soon.  Lego Batman 2: DC Super Heroes (Steam)  Started this the other day. I think it's a lot of fun sometimes, but some of the levels just draaaaaag. Still, could be worse things.  Day One: Garry's Incident (Steam)  I own this game for some reason. I decided to try it. Got 30 minutes in. Never again. It's not even the fun kind of bad, just the terrible kind."
Games,3drfq5,Pixelated_Piracy,3,Mon Jul 20 00:53:12 2015 UTC,"Dark Souls 2  I played a lot of Dark Souls and am finally getting around to its sequel. I've heard it's not as loved as the first but there are a lot of improvements that I really like so far.   I like how the fire network now shows different areas you've been to in pictures and then organizes them by zone and progression through that zone.   Sliding down ladders is the best.   The bit of distortion that follows weapon swings is pretty cool.   The main hub Majula gives bastion a run for its money for prettiest stronghold.    So far I like the map design.   The game feel more populated then dark souls 1.   I don't particularly like how your health goes down when you die. In dark souls that only happened when you are cursed, but it seems to max out at 50 percent loss where dark souls 1 could be halved 4 times to 1/16th health.   Starting with only 1 estus flask was pretty brutal.   I heard there was some issue with weapons decaying too rapidly before a patch a while back, but now nothing I have seems to experience any decay at all, and I've died a bunch. Its possible I'm doing something wrong or it's only a mid/end game thing one has to worry about.   I started out as a deprived and only beaten the Last Giant, so I'm excited to see what it throws at me."

Plus Archangel's (spoiler friendly now sorry) AI totally refused to take cover during his keep me alive/escort mission and I was forced to change difficulty out of an hours worth of reloading to get past one specific fight, bleh.   It is a fun game and I like the gameplay changes from the first mostly but still miss the expanded loot and level up system from ME1. The selection for gear and skills is just so limited, especially without DLC. Luckily on PS3 a new copy of the game comes with quite a bit of the DLC free. However I wont be so lucky when I hit Mass Effect 3 and its overwhelming tide of DLC that I want."

Games,3drfq5,GobbleMyPot,4,Sat Jul 18 23:45:40 2015 UTC,"Sorcerer King I've put about 6 hours into it and I'm liking it a lot. It's like a more polished version of Fallen Enchantress: Legendary Heroes.  The mechanics are almost the same, but I found Sorcerer King easier to understand, which probably means after I've finished the game I can give Fallen Enchantress another shot.  The graphics are more colorful and overall better and the writing has a lot more humor so the game isn't as dark, and the thing I like most about it is the Doomsday clock.  At first I thought the Doomsday clock would be like the alarm in Invisible Inc., but it's a lot more dynamic than that in that you can advance it or reverse by your actions, and you occasionally HAVE to use it otherwise you'll ending pissing off the Sorcerer King.  Wolfenstein The New Order I had lost interest in FPS quite a while ago, and picked Wolfenstein The New Order on sale, but it's really surprised me by how much fun it is; the level design, the graphics, and especially the stealth mechanics, which if you don't use the levels can turn into nightmare spawns. When I played one level stealthily I only had to kill, like, five Nazis, but when I tried to shoot my way through they kept spawning until I ran out of ammo and died. While the game has quite a few cut scenes, they aren't overly long, nor do they pad the game length, but they do advance the story in a very well done way. I'm only about 11% into the game (prison level) but I'm already looking forward to doing a second replay."

Died about 400 times.   Also been playing Euro Truck Simulator 2 which really helps combat my driving anxiety. Very relaxing and nice to play when listening to podcasts.   Recently beat Arkham Knight. It's fun to play. Batmobile drives perfectly for me despite others' complaints.

The combat is much more engaging and has more options than the first game's combat system, but damn is it tough. I'm level 8 and got killed by a group of Nekkers in like 5 seconds when I had taken swallow, golden oriole, and Brown Oil for my sword. I was playing on normal thinking that would be the standard difficulty but had to switch to easy, which i feel shouldn't be the option someone with as much gaming experience as myself should have to resort to. Also though the combat isn't nearly as boring as the first game, it still needs some work. I spent one battle against bandits just running in circles while my swallow potion healed me and then attacking the bandits one at a time whenever it was most convenient for me. I love the game world (dem graphics), the story is very intriguing, and I enjoy the quests and the game itself, but hopefully I just need to get used to the combat and improve how I play and it will get better.

The story and voice acting were good, but not enough to overcome the awful combat, very limited skills (in both number and use) and weak puzzle aspects.   While I appreciated that it avoided LA Noire's arbitrary and frustrating detective aspect, it did so by making things ludicrously easy, with no consequences for failure.   My favourite was a scene where you have to find a key. Not only does the game tell you how to go about getting to the key, it then presents you with a puzzle to pick it up, where you have to choose between the key, a fork and a spoon.

It's been a hell of a fun ride, and its given me some of the most wonderful gaming experiences I've had recently. Everything from the story to the characters to the locations was all so wonderfully memorable.

Obviously, I couldn't let that slide, so I tracked him down and killed him using his weakness to stealth attacks.

This was the first Grand Theft Auto game I've played since 3 and it didn't fail to live up to the hype. The story was great, the controls felt smooth but could still use some modifications. I ended up using the controller for some parts of the game. Specifically, flying. There's just so much to do in this game and I'm not sure I'm ever going to 100% the game which on one hand is great but on the other hand, it's upsetting because I'm an achievement whore.   I'm currently struggling with golf and I'm not looking forward to the final flying related things I need to do (knife fights and under the bridge's) because I really dislike flying in this game. Other then that though it deserves all the hype it's received. Highly recommended for open world enthusiasts.  After this I plan on moving onto Witcher 3. I've tried it out a little bit (very little) but I'm still not completely sure this is a game I'll love. I've heard many people tell me (a diehard elder scrolls fan) that it blows Elder Scrolls out of the water but I have a feeling the hype will ruin this game for me. I'll be comparing it to Elder Scrolls the whole time and expecting a Game of the Decade contender based on how people talk about it but again, we'll have to see (I plan on at least playing through the main story before making any real judgements on it)."

I really enjoyed the characterion of Nilin, they way for example how she questioned her own action and the interperpectives at the beginng of each chapter, and the art direction. The gameplay was ok and story was decent.   I heard that a lot of people disliked the small number of remixes, but i found the number of remixes ok, since they were very well built into the story.    ENSLAVED™: Odyssey to the West™   I remember reading about the game when i was a kid, but never got around playing it. So when i saw it on sale on in the summer sale i bought it. And i am loving it.

I enjoy the story but the gameplay just gets boring after a while. There's very little enemy variety and the combat is mostly a case of exploiting weakness and using all-out attacks to wipe them out. Outside of the boss battles and the occassional enemy with bullshit one-hit kill attacks, there's virtually no challenge. It's a shame because the actual boss fights can be pretty fun.  I've nearly finished it now though, on the final section of Tartarus with less than a month left in-game."

So is there anything else I can add onto what I said last week. Well my opinion on the gameplay stays the same (it's too clunky) and I don't understand why people like it so much. I won't repeat that opinion any further. What I will comment on is the ending. I won't spoil it... but wow. I reckon that is as bad as, if not worse, than the Mass Effect 3 ending. I didn't even like the game and I didn't pay attention to the story and I still felt let down by that ending. I didn't even realise it was the ending until the credits rolled. It was so abrupt and unsatisfying. I was speechless. But anyway, moving onto more positive experiences.  TellTale's Game of Thrones  This is my third TellTale game and although the community's opinion of them appears to be divebombing, I still love them. I play singleplayer games mostly for story 95% of the time and these TellTale games always deliver. I've just finished Episode 2 and what more can I say? After TWD 1&2, and TWAU - it's more TellTale goodness. Excellent writing, excellent plot, no ""right"" decisions and plot twists! I love it all. The ending to Episode 1 was great although I do have a bit of a problem with it Spoiler but the ending of episode 2 is the second TellTale moment to give me watery eyes (the other being the ending of TWD 1, of course). I'm enjoying myself. I have yet to play a comedy TellTale game but I own the Sam&Max and Monkey Island ones so I'll be jumping into those after GoT.  Games I had a dip into this week  Planescape: Torment  I'm enjoying it. As I said before, I like story in my games and this is supposed to have one of the best so I'll keep at it. I was, however, born the year before the game came out so it takes some getting used to compared to the games I am used to.  Divinity: Original Sin  The rate my friend and I are progressing through this? It will probably be the reason we stay in touch when we go to different universities ;)  Poker Night 2  MOAR TELLTALE!!! The dialogue is funny even if it does repeat and it's a genuinely solid poker game. A lot of fun and relaxing... though when Sam got that surpriseflushthatwassuchbullshit"

Basically, you choose one of 3 ships and choose one of 5 roles.  Captain, Weapons, Scientist, Engineer, and Pilot.  It's a coop game against AI (although you can substitute bots for crew members but they're fairly useless).  Each player has a set of responsibilities while you go out and fight other ships, explore areas, do missions, etc.  It's a blast though.  You actually walk around the inside of your ship and interact with control panels.  Land on planets with randomly generated loot.  Fight fires, turn off systems to cool your ship in combat, shoot enemy combatants both with your ship or your blasters, it's a lot of fun.  333 mb download so it's not winning any awards for graphics or anything but those who are looking for a co-op game with friends that's unique and a ton of fun, I recommend it.

I quite like it, but I actually find the Puzzle & Dragons Z segment to be much easier than the Super Mario Bros. segment, but I think that's mainly because the Puzzle & Dragons Z segment gives you some useful powers such as healing when you need it most and not having to wait for heart orbs to show up in the exact place you need them. The fact that these powers are MP-based helps this (as opposed to the Turn Based powers of the Super Mario Bros. Edition).  I also kind of wonder why they didn't just make the entire thing a Pokemon game. It would have sold a whole lot more with the Pokemon label, and it has a lot more in common with Pokemon than it does with Mario. In fact, you could literally paste Pokemon characters and environments over the Puzzle & Dragons Z characters and environments. Have the game be about earning puzzle badges while stopping Team Rocket from taking over the world or whatever. Instead it's about a kid getting badges of honour from puzzle dragons while fighting the evil Paradox group. As a result, the story comes off as a horribly inept parody of Pokemon, complete with weird fourth wall-breaking jokes (at one point you encounter an old man who can ""turn without moving [his] feet"").

Never played WoW, and even I noticed the copycat syndrome going on, but still, it was Star Wars. With epic music, environments, and at least some epic, cohesive main story lines (that totally don't work in an MMO environment - I wish they would've stopped with the ""you are special"" approach). Dropped it after I reached endgame content and realised it wouldn't get better from now on. Dailies, the same raids... Picked it up for the add-on, played with my main, checked out the raids, and left again. I hate grinding so much. This is where my question comes in, do subscribers get constant xp bonus now? Because if I could play through the main quests of other characters without the (GRMBLLBMMMMRRAAARGH) need to grind I'd probably pick it up at some point or another, too.  p.s. What I still don't understand is all the fuzz about raiding, or at least the way raiding is treated in WoW and the likes. WoW might've been more challenging, but... I mean - you learn your limits and rotations, you learn the enemy's mechanics and then it is basically over for a specific raid. But no, do it every week for the gear. And also the only thing that might get in the way (if you are not sleeping through it) is gear. Never was in a guild, but I had luck with groups a few times, nice guilds that were looking for a substitute for some quick run in a higher raid, and they took the time and explained bosses, while I could still see them for the first time and have a sense of wonder. Then we just... did it. Because I knew how to apply my skills. More interesting than looking the strategies up and hoping that randoms do the same. I get why it might be difficult the FIRST time, as a guild, figuring shit out, the phases etc, but afterwards it quickly turns into a grind again, especially if you are in a guild!? ""If A happens, do B"" is all there is in the end, and it always happens at the same time or in the same location or from the same trigger! It's like playing a big Portal level as a group. Might be awesome to figure things out together, but doing this over and over again every week to get the next tier dong-warmer? Maybe I'm just not made for MMOs."

Games,3dr9q4,Sega_Saturn_Shiro,28,Sun Jul 19 09:17:27 2015 UTC,"The quick version is this:   CIG is completely re-writing Cryengine's netcode. They're using practically zero of the ""default"" engine stuff. This was going pretty decent, until they finished their 64-bit implementation.  Basically, CIG re-wrote Cryengine to completely convert the engine to 64-bit. The engine still used a lot of 16-bit registers for location data, all those were converted to 32-bit. This allows them to go up to maps that exceed 65,000 km aside.   Ships in CIG are horridly complex. They're made up of dozens of parts that all have to mesh and move together. You used Elite for reference -in supercruise a ship in Elite is one object that has a positional accuracy of 30km (or thereabouts). In Star Citizen a positional error of a few inches can cause problems (hence part of the reason to 64-bit, the original engine started to run into floating point errors at both high speed and far distances from the origin).   On top of all that, CIG has converted Cryengine from a client-authoritative model to a semi-server-authoritative model. That means there's a metric fuckton of data that has to be synced back and forth, and because they haven't finished the zone system yet (which will help segregate and segment that data) this is one reason they're running into network divergent issues. Cryengine didn't do that, so CIG has had to write this part of the engine essentially from scratch (with a ton of support from Crytek -they're not going in blind).  I don't know enough about their matchmaker to go into detail on the issues with it, but it's been giving them problems since day 1.   The reason this causes problems for the FPS module is because it's the same game. There's no difference between the FPS module and the Space Flight module. This is a point lost on many, many people who don't follow development of SC. CIG doesn't do themselves any favours by describing the development the way they do, but it's not separate ""games"" or separate program states or anything. The FPS portion of the game is the space combat portion and vice-versa. So problems on the backend will screw up everything.  Another point about Elite. It uses a P2P networking system without validation checks to a server. That has some advantages and some disadvantages. The disadvantages of that system make it impractical for a game like Star Citizen (and very few multiplayer games use a P2P networking system for the same reasons).  Hope that answers your question.  On a personal opinion note, so many people are worried about things like scope creep, how CIG is going to deliver on their promises, etc. etc. It's the netcode that's given them the most problems since the very first release of Arena Commander, and a good chunk of bugs we've frequently encountered have been due to netcode issues. I'd hazard to say it's currently the #1 technical issue for CIG and has been for almost 2 years. I'm not hugely worried though because good, efficient netcode is also one of the most difficult parts of multiplayer game development, and I wouldn't expect them to have it perfect this early in development.  I've been in several MMO betas and even right up to a week before going live they've all had severe netcode issues.  EDIT: They're there their -_-"
Games,3dr9q4,kalnaren,5,Sun Jul 19 16:00:14 2015 UTC,"A huge part of the problem is that they did stupid things like display the HUD a couple of centimeters from the camera instead of super imposing it.

Games,3dr9q4,Vocith,6,Sun Jul 19 17:45:48 2015 UTC,"The ship HUDs are being re-done, much of it being put on the displays instead of on the HUD. You can see this in the Aurora and the Merlin. So that point is kind of moot.  The helmet HUD also works. It makes some things harder but its functional. The current issues with the usability of the HUD have to do with layout and information displayed rather than location. I'm also pretty sure the HUD on the visor is a projected or baked texture (not sure what the exact technical term is), not a separate object in itself. It's also improved a ton over both their original concepts and since AC 0.8. So again, that point is kind of moot. People have been bitching that developers take ""the easy way"" too much.. CIG isn't doing that.. and getting shit for it when things don't work perfectly right off the bat. :/  If you want to use the ""painted into a corner"" argument you'd be better off with the flight control system as an illustration."

Unfortunately, what you told me has given me an even more grim outlook on what to expect from Star Citizen. I mean ok, they're re-writing the netcode with the help of crytek, awesome! That shows initiative etc etc... But then you think about it. This games problems have been network since day one. It's the engines fault. Star Citizen came out if the croudsourcing clusterfuck claiming to be a massively multiplayer game... but the engine they choose to use had problems with anything more than 8 players in an area SINCE DAY ONE. Why did they choose cryengine again? It just seems completely shortsighted to me. Now let's assume they fix all the problems with the netcode: how buggy is the online going to be on release? Probably buggy as fuck. Let's assume it's not and it's amazing, how many years is that going to take? How many other things the devs are working on are going to be scrapped in lieu of getting the most important feature if an mm""o"" to even work in the first place? I honestly don't see how anyone can be optimistic about this game, no offense. Also, what of their budget? If they need to be fixing shit that's inately wrong with the engine all the livelong day, then how long can this last before Chris Roberts can't pay his employees anymore? I'm aware that this game has made millions so far in crowdsourcing but years and years of development hell is incredibly expensive, and is impossible to let drag on forever. I'm afraid at some point they'll just say ""welp, we gave it a good try, but we're out of money now. So let's ship what we got and hope for the best""... and then the game is complete ass.  it just seems to me that Chris Roberts has dug his own high-polycount, fancy moving partsified grave."
Games,3dr9q4,Sega_Saturn_Shiro,13,Sun Jul 19 19:24:24 2015 UTC,"They're using cryengine because, at the time they started the project, it was the only engine that could achieve the graphical fidelity they were going for.  No engine existed that could do the multiplayer stuff they wanted. Not one. They were faced with re-writing a lot of parts of an existing engine, or doing a complete engine from scratch, including renderer, physics, collisions, everything. Again, at the time Cryengine was the best candidate. They'd be a whole hell of a lot further behind if they went from scratch. CIG addressed this point a while ago when lots of backers were asking why they went with Cryengine and not UE4 (which hadn't released in 2012). The game has only been in heavy development for 2.5 years, and even then most of 2013 was spent ramping up the studios. Considering they went from ~5 people in late 2012 with a basic in-engine tech demo to what they have now, their progress is really quite impressive.  With maybe two exceptions, no single thing Star Citizen is trying to accomplish is new or novel. It's all been done before in some way or another, CIG is just expanding on the concepts. The two possible exceptions being the local overlaid physics grids and zone system. Interestingly enough the physics grid system is making good progress and, IMO, is much more advanced than anything they want to do with networking. It will actually significantly reduce the network load in a large environment on top of what the zone system will already do. Their budget is fine. Contrary to the /r/games mantra, Star Citizen is going to have zero budget issues. CIG has already allocated the development budget, a post-release support budget, as well as ""breathing room"" for errors.    I honestly don't see how anyone can be optimistic about this game, no offense   I don't take any offense, so no worries there. However I return to a point I've stated numerous times in the past: People need to stop and think for a second that there may in fact be reasons those of us that follow the game and are well informed of its progress and issues aren't near as worried as those who don't follow the game aren't well informed about its progress and issues. You'll notice the vast majority of the ""worry"" or ""concern"" about Star Citizen comes from people who know almost nothing about the game (seriously -ask them to actually elaborate on what they mean, and you'll get some vague or non-static goalpost response, 90% of the time).  If you hang around on /r/starcitizen you'll notice a lot of critical threads. But the criticism is almost always directed at mechanical implementations, gameplay balancing, and criticisms of project management or things CIG has actually done or shown to be in progress. You'll notice criticisms from outside the community tend to revolve around much more vague statements, hyperbole, or things that can't be backed up with facts. I can sum up most of the arguments against SC in one sentence: ""Nobody's done this exact thing before, thus it's impossible."" False equivalency, but it reminds me of a line from The Cardinal of the Kremlin: ""Nobody bothered to tell the fool it was impossible, so he went ahead and invented it.""  Given how shitty publishers/developers have been to PC gamers over the last decade I don't blame anyone for being skeptical. But if it's criticism, just make sure it's informed criticism.  And frankly, I'm just tired of being so God-damned negative about games all the time it's nice to have a game with passionate and involved developers and a (generally) good community."

Its unknown to me whether this is normal in game development, or the large scope of such a project is starting to show that most of this ambition and promises to deliver may actually not be well grounded in reality of the current technology that is available.  Even I wonder whether all of the things Star Citizen is promising to deliver can even be done with the current technology at hand.  Maybe some more experienced game developers can step in and correct me on this, but, is ""Star Citizen"" too big to be made?  edit: enough with the downvotes, I changed the current information on the 1.1.5 PTU and changed to confirm that 1.1.5 on the PTU is now up thanks to /u/pollomuhku , /u/sirkillsalot .

So they are much farther along and are able to guess easier when it will come out.   Everything they want to do can be done with current technology. All it could've been done 10 years ago. It's not likely they are breaking any ground on hardware.  I work in construction with people have been working in it for 30+ years and they still mess up on dates of completion. It's a balancing issue between 2 different ideas, I want to look good to the customer and delivery faster than the next guy vs I don't want to look like an idoit setting a really aggressive completion date and have to delay it a few times."

Its unknown to me whether this is normal in game development   Absolutely normal to have delays in game development.  Abnormal would be them hitting 100% of their goals on time, especially in AAA game development.  For example, Fallout 4, which was just recently announced, has been in development for seven years now.  Star Citizen has only been in development for around three years.    Fallout 4 had the advantages of starting with a large amount of publisher funding, a large dev team, and a proprietary engine that was developed exclusively for that type of game.  And it still was ~7 years of development time to complete.  Star Citizen had none of that.  They raised their own money with a grassroots style effort, expanded their dev team from ~30 to ~300, and completely overhauled an FPS engine into a SpaceSim/MMO/FPS/Universe engine.  Compared to other games, what Star Citizen has accomplished in three years is very impressive."

I can't speak for GTAV, I didn't play it, but I've heard the same things about it."
Games,3dr9q4,HelpfulToAll,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"Yes I am talking about AC series and yes I agree 3 suffered from all those problems. 4 (Black Flag) on the other hand didn't have anywhere as many of the issues present in 3. And yes Watch Dogs suffered the worst. I am sure you have seen the picture of the 90 degree train tracks.  I can't comment on what you have heard about GTAV but that hasn't been my experience with it. To me the game exactly like another GTA game by Rockstar albeit one more a little more like San Andreas and a little less like GTA4. Well made and  well polished.   What my point was that while having multiple studios can case a range of issues it is not always necessarily a bad thing. Managing a single large studio gets difficult just like managing studios around the world. Both of these methods have their advantages and disadvantages.   Star Citizen has shown both sides. They have even admitted that having multiple studios makes them all somewhat insular and they aren't always up to date with what all the other studios are doing. They are known to not be the most organized and as the content leak a few weeks ago showed they were skipping security measures for ease of access. But on the other hand they get have managed to acquire a lot of much needed talent. Their Austin and Frankfurt studios (Frankfurt is made entirely of ex CryTek employees right now) have many ex CryTek engineers that were either let go or quit during the recent troubles CryTeks faced. These are the guys who made CryEngine in the first place and a game like SC needs as many CryEngine experts as it can get. Similarly the studio in Denver which works on the FPS module has both experience with making CryEngine games and with making FPS games. Getting these groups on board was much easier when you aren't asking them to move thousands of kilometres. Not to mention their biggest studio is in the U.K. which gets a 25% tax break, that's a huge amount of money for a crowd funded game.   I am a project engineer(manager) so I am well aware of the issues that are created when working across multiple time zones with teams you have never met in person. Sometimes it works, sometimes if doesn't. It's not automatically better of worse than having everyone in the same location once you have hundreds of employees. So far CIG has shown good reasons to have these multiple studios but only time will tell if they manage to make it work.   edit for phone typos and formatting"

The frighting thing is that CIG has 4 Offices opened around the world: (CIG Austin, Foundry 42 UK, Foundry 42 Frankfurt)  and then even more offices contracted to handle out sourced work: (Illfonic, Mooncollider)  So with so many offices and also outsourced contracted offices all working on StarCitizen, how many more employees does Chris Roberts have to hire to get StarCitizen finished within a realistic time frame?  To me it sounds like the company would have to grow up to the size of all the studios employed under EA or Ubisoft combined to keep up with the development scope of the game.

The kind of actual content that works as expected and the way they delivered it (delayed like hell while still having game breaking bugs for a long time) in relation to what they are trying to achieve just doesn't look to promising. I have seen many teams fail because of unrealistic scopes and too much ambition, just hope CIG can pull this off.  I also know that many games take 5+ years, but CIG should just stop giving release dates and then failing them big time. From their original pitch the game should be out by now (i believe it was slated for a late 2014 release) and look what we have right now. Release has since been moved to late 2016 but i believe it will be more like 2018."

Games,3dr9q4,badgerlord,0,Sun Jul 19 19:23:34 2015 UTC,"You're right, it is a bad analogy.   A more proper one would be if a washed up celebrity architect came along and promised to design and build an entire new housing complex for thousands of people after working (and having no success in) completely unrelated fields for over a decade.   That architect then secured funding for his new project via a perfect storm of hype sparked by nostalgic fans of the 2 or 3 private homes he built in his glory days and was thereafter fueled by a huge wave of popularity for ""crowd sourcing"", of which his project (by chance) happened to be one of the first to utilize.   [Note: 3 years later, most people still don't even understand the difference between kickstarting (a glorified pre-order), donating, and investing.]  Having secured many times more cash than he originally asked for by selling rough sketches of homes (rather than actual plans), this architect was now free from the shackles of oversight and due diligence that come with investment from accredited investors, loans from banks, and traditional funding sources.   The architect, having assembled under him an array of construction-related companies in the span of a few months, proceeded to miss deadline after deadline to the point where the model home was half-finished by the time the community was scheduled to have been entirely built.   Buyers who had patiently waited for years under the reasonable assumption that they would be delivered a home, just as if they might have with any other architectural and construction company, were openly scoffed at by the fanatical fanbase (grown larger with the addition of those who were now desperately self-justifying laying down many multiples of what they would have paid for another home at market price) as ""not understanding the complex architectural process"".   Media outlets that reported on missed deadlines and offered skepticism were attacked outright by this fanbase. They eventually declared that all architectural media was corrupt and somehow out to get them and their beloved idol.  The architect and his company (sufficiently shielded from backlash by a following more attached to dreams than reality) explained away the deadlines by pointing to ""new and innovative"" designs that would ""enhance realism"", such as genetically engineering wood with a smooth matte-green finish, rather than simply painting the wood.   Other problems, like the inability of their construction process to create floors capable of holding the weight of 2 people, were said to have been ""completely redesigned from the ground up."" While most reasonable onlookers would describe this as a huge setback, the architect was applauded by his fans for his dedication to details.  TL;DR: Star Citizen is a game being developed by unproven and hastily-assembled developers with a scope and set of features that manages to still be nebulous months after its originally planned release date. It deserves to garner more skepticism than any other game in history, but any potential criticism is taken as a personal affront by fans."

People thought South Park:Stick of truth was never going to be released.  Watch Dogs was delayed multiple times.  The Division has been delayed like 3 times I think so far.  MGS V has been delayed at least twice that I can think of.  These are just some of the more recent titles off the top of my head.

When Stick of Truth was delayed, no one had already paid for it by then.    RSI has already been paid for their product, and they've repeatedly failed to deliver.  I honestly can't imagine this ending with anything but a class action lawsuit, very possibly establishing legal precedent that may very well kill the entire concept of crowdfunding."

It is clearly stated in their terms of service what your 'pledge' means.  Actual investors had paid for those games when they were being delayed. You are not an 'investor' because you gifted a crowdfunded project. You are contributing on the hope that they are able to deliver on what they say. You are taking on the risk of an investor without any safety nets. People seem to have a hard time grasping this.  They have been incredibly transparent on the entire development process. Go and take a look at their website and dev blogs.

And it's not going well, either.    So then, if you think that their terms of service protect them from lawsuits(which it probably does not, if they are found to have taken that money not in good faith), what do you think will happen after the inevitable implosion?"
Games,3dr9q4,Kaarous,9,Sun Jul 19 08:39:22 2015 UTC,"You're making them out as if they want to run away with the money, when they have clearly shown they are going to deliver something. And have delivered things already.  You're stretching hyperbole to the point of silliness.  Why do people have such a boner for this thing to fail? It is almost no different than any other dev cycle."
Games,3dr9q4,Zethos,5,Sun Jul 19 08:42:12 2015 UTC,"I honestly can't imagine this ending with anything but a class action lawsuit   ROFL are you fucking serious? This would get laughed out of court by almost any judge. Kickstarter is not an investment platform, it's not a guarantee of completion, and it's sure as fuck not a preorder platform. You are donating money to companies or groups with the hope that you get something in return or that they develop a finished product. All the developer has to do is show that they put a reasonable amount of work into making the product to get a suit like this dismissed, and CIG has truckloads of that all open to the public."
Games,3dr9q4,Arakha,-8,Sun Jul 19 09:17:45 2015 UTC,"So, yet another person saying that the Kickstarter backers just got screwed.  They're not even ""customers"", they're just people dumb enough to buy in Robert's hype, right?   Sounds like a scam to me."
Games,3dr9q4,badgerlord,2,Sun Jul 19 09:21:10 2015 UTC,"Earlier you said   I honestly can't imagine this ending with anything but a class action lawsuit   The FTC can go after crowdfunding projects sure but unless they find the project to be spending money illegally (like for example on vacations rather than on developing the game or even running away with the money) its not a scam.  As we know SC in fact is spending all their money on developing the game. They have almost 300 people across 4 internal studios and almost 200 freelancers and third party contractors working on the game. They don't even spend development money on their youtube videos, community content or the events they go to. The money for that comes from an optional subscriber pool and via sponsors like AMD, Logitech, and etc. CIG pays lower than industry average wages and CR has even put millions of his own money in the game (that's how we got to the kickstarter in the first place).    Sounds like a scam to me.   If they are trying to scam anyone they need to learn how a scam actually works then cause they are really bad at it.   *Feel free to read this article by Ortwin Freyermuth about crowdfunding; http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2014-06-23-how-indie-film-financing-could-shape-the-future-of-games"
Games,3dr9q4,Artemis317,0,Sun Jul 19 16:37:38 2015 UTC,"Game delays are extremely common.   I don't see how this is a valid explanation.  If you are working in the gaming industry, and you know that just about everything being unexpectedly delayed in this industry is normal, then why would announce dates and deadlines that you know you have less than 10% of chance to meet ?  You'd think that after the first few delays, people would stop giving timelines to the public and keep them for themselves. Because of course internally they need those, but why release it to the public since it will only lead to confusion and bad critics ?  Because no matter what you or they say, ""delays are extremely common"" isn't a good excuse to be delayed : just because everybody does something negative to me doesn't mean that I wouldn't be angry at you if you do the same (I'm not angry at all in reality, I didn't back the game, it's just here to explain what I wanted to convey)"

All you have to do is actually look."
Games,3dr9q4,YourTormentIs,5,Sun Jul 19 22:59:01 2015 UTC,After FPS we have multi-crew. I have heard rumors that the mulit-crew portion is much farther along but I expect there to be numerous delays for it
Games,3dr9q4,Artemis317,6,Sat Jul 18 22:49:35 2015 UTC,Multi-crew?  I've yet to see anything that even remotely looks promising in SINGLE-crew gameplay so far.  Been playing AC on/off since November..
Games,3dr9q4,YourTormentIs,7,Sun Jul 19 01:23:52 2015 UTC,"I actually had a ton of fun in AC, and I've been playing it since the alpha release.  I was top 50 in the leaderboards for a little while.  I can understand doubt about multi-crew and the FPS, but I have to wonder why you think the current single-crew gameplay doesn't look ""remotely promising""?"
Games,3dr9q4,Tebrimir,7,Sun Jul 19 03:17:26 2015 UTC,"Some people share the opinion that ship handling is too erratic making flying the ships feel like more of an FPS then space ships dog fighting.

Games,3dr9q4,Daffan,6,Sun Jul 19 03:53:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, that's a valid complaint.  I think it's way overboard, and even unfair, to say that it doesn't look ""remotely promising"" though.  As you said, none of this is final, and CIG themselves have stated they have many changes planned for ship handling.  As early in development as it is, I do find the current system fun, and I'm definitely looking forward to the much delayed 1.1.5 patch."
Games,3dr9q4,kalnaren,2,Sun Jul 19 04:05:58 2015 UTC,"I bough an X52 Pro specifically for SC & E:D.  Right now (and since the patch back in Dec/Jan?) HOTAS in SC doesn't stand a chance in hell of competing fairly with HOMAS or even M/K.  Add to that - the missile spam and many individual wonky ship issues which should really be resolved or redesigned before working on a system to have multiple persons in the same ship.  The current aim-to-fly-to-win gimbals, and bizarre maneuvering (yaw like a spinning top), etc.. in my opinion, should probably be prioritized over adding a multi-crew layer of complexity when the latest reports are still advising very limited multi-player/netcode viability even for internal testing at this point."
Games,3dr9q4,faern,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:59:38 2015 UTC,"It is. Because it's all mouse aimed just like War Thunder. It's just like an FPS, point the mouse on enemy ship and it flies itself almost, especially with the gimbals guns that the mouse aim users get.   I doubt they will ever remove mouse control or nerf it.   For instance, War Thunder had to make a completely seperate game mode where mouse control is disabled, and all you can use is mouse-joystick and a real joystick because mouse-aim is so overpowered."
Games,3dr9q4,magmasafe,2,Sun Jul 19 06:27:46 2015 UTC,"Been playing AC on/off since November..

AC participation right now is the lowest its ever been despite SC having more backers with access."
Games,3dr9q4,faern,6,Sun Jul 19 16:13:40 2015 UTC,"Sigh, i think star citizen developer is massively underestimating the massive multiplayer portion of the game in term of complexity and scope. They should have already gotten an ideas on what they intend on the massive multiplayer gameplay.   Is it gonna be sandbox with full crafting. How complex the crafting going to be, is the player gonna have build factory mines? Is there a predetermined faction, or non-player element to the game. How do pvp even work, do player make their own faction. Is there a player controlled zone.   At the end, the massive multiplayer element will account for large amount of playerbase time/effort."
Games,3dr9q4,magmasafe,27,Sat Jul 18 20:41:41 2015 UTC,No crafting beside kinda tweaking parts apparently.  As a player you yourself can't build anything. The closest you seem to be able to get is owning shares of economic nodes (like factories) and getting a cut of profits. They said they may allow players to build their own favorites and the like post launch though.  I know people compare it to EvE in that regard but it's seems like it's much closer to Elite.
Games,3dr9q4,Artemis317,-15,Sat Jul 18 21:11:25 2015 UTC,so not even full sandbox. Dunno how they going to keep player retention after the initial shininess fade out.
Games,3dr9q4,Jaliu,28,Sat Jul 18 21:19:34 2015 UTC,I don't think they're trying to go after that EvE like demographic though. They seem to be targeting it more at people who played Freelancer online or what to have a co-op space adventure. Seems like the idea is to have the economy facilitate missions for you to go out on and that is what most of the game is meant to be. Doing these missions with your buddies. So long as they can make the missions interesting they should be OK. But if they end up being repetitive dribble then things may get bad.   Good news is the guy designing all this stuff was behind Ultima Online so emergent gameplay through interactive systems is kinda his fetish. He seems to have a whole plan laid out and Roberts just kinda lets him do it.
Games,3dr9q4,magmasafe,3,Sat Jul 18 21:24:08 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day one thing I do hope for is that either the success or horrific failure of StarCitizen inspires space sims to comeback, or space sims to innovate.  So far because of the shortcomings of Elite:dangerous it has the consumer base very much on edge. I know people who have given up on Elite and hope that StarCitizen can learn from its mistakes.  If StarCitizen fails in the same aspects as Elite did then I am afraid that this would be the end of spacesims as much as it was a new beginning.  To back up this claim I will list some of the pitfalls that Elite has put themselves in: Always online (no offline mode), Fractured background simulation from the Powerplay update, lack of player agency (only wings, no corps or guilds), peer to peer networking causing extremely poor multiplayer connection consistency, no multicrew or npc crews as of now, lack of development in a number of areas of the game (smuggling, exploration, mining still need more improvements), Lack of weapon balance, lack of ship balance."
Games,3dr9q4,teerre,3,Sat Jul 18 22:57:40 2015 UTC,"Well, with regards to Elite's shortcomings that you've listed, from what I've heard/read/know regarding SC;    We'll have online and offline (singleplayer) and you can host your own private servers. Dunno what fractured background simulation entails, but is it something along the lines of a persistent universe? (SC has said they'll have that) We already have Organisations/Guilds and you can even join multiple Organisations atm (See point one regarding networking) Multicrew ships confirmed We'll have smuggling/salvaging/pirates/explorations (i think we'll get mining too) Can't speak for weapons or ship balances atm   Anyways, there's no telling how well SC implements these features or whether they get scrapped but the list that I provided are stuff that I remember reading were in development/planned."
Games,3dr9q4,magmasafe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:52:18 2015 UTC,"Well in some ways it already has! For a long time all we had was X and Evochron but now we have Elite Dangerous, Star Citizen, Eve Valkyrie, Rogue Space (DCS in space basically), Void Destroyer, No Man's Sky, The Mandate, and more."
Games,3dr9q4,Zethos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:45:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar at all with the game, so sorry for the possibly obvious question.   What these missions look like? Is it like Destiny? Is it Space fighting? It's like WoW?"
Games,3dr9q4,Stujelmabok,2,Sat Jul 18 23:26:48 2015 UTC,Well the initial plan is mostly 'escort this shipment' or ' move this cargo' but I guess they want to break those up with twists like your escort turning on you or getting a SOS beacon or something. Seems like they want some kind of AI director ala Left4Dead or Rimworld.
Games,3dr9q4,Artemis317,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:40:23 2015 UTC,Er its.. like none of those. The closest recent game would be to Elite Dangerous and even then these two games have some big differences when it comes to actual gameplay.
Games,3dr9q4,Zethos,8,Sun Jul 19 05:43:24 2015 UTC,You need to do more research on what the game is aiming for because you clearly have the wrong idea.
Games,3dr9q4,Getzageddon,-2,Sat Jul 18 21:58:04 2015 UTC,"That is the issue though, the game may be aiming for something more but until we see ""physical"" real progress instead of words and promises most people wont take anything from CIG seriously.  This is called being objective, ""I can promise you that I will throw a lasso around the moon and bring it to you"" in words. But would you care if I told you this, instead of actually doing it?"
Games,3dr9q4,Dullahan3470,6,Sat Jul 18 23:00:51 2015 UTC,"They already have a lot of ideas, you just have to do some research.    Is it gonna be sandbox with full crafting. How complex the crafting going to be, is the player gonna have build factory mines? Is there a predetermined faction, or non-player element to the game. How do pvp even work, do player make their own faction. Is there a player controlled zone.   Its a sandbox in some ways but not a 100% player controlled one so arguably not a 'true' sandbox. Players make up 10% of the active spacefaring population with the remaining 90% being NPCs. As such while players can influence the economy of certain sectors or for certain goods they can never completely break things across the game world. There will be some crafting but in such a limited manner that it can't really be called crafting in the conventional sense. That is to say while players can produce, transport, steal, etc raw materials they won't be producing the end product like in Eve. They can mine, salvage, collect/refine fuel, and all that but they can't do things like produce entire ships on their own for example. They will have some influence on it via owning factory nodes that will produce some of these end goods but as I said players will not have 100% control of the economy. However players will be take these components/ship parts and modify them in unique ways. These modifications can not be acquired normally and must be made by players. That is how CIG's wishes to design their game. Not everyone is going to like it, especially anyone who wants EVE because its not going to be like that.   There will be factions, both minor and major ones. How they act in the game world will change over time depending on player actions and what the devs want to do. For example the human empire referred to as the UEE is said to be stretched thin and is under pressure one side by the alien Vanduul. Internally there are signs of the empire splitting in two (the UEE is heavily inspired by the Roman empire). Player actions will determine how far the Vanduul are able to push, how many systems they are able to invade, whether the empire fractures, and etc. There are also 2 other alien factions the Banu and the Xi'an. The Xi'an are at war with another unknown faction and players may be able to be the one to make contact. There are many other minor factions as well, some shady syndicates, some large corporations, some fanatics, some militaristic ones, and so on. Players will be able to build a reputation with certain factions and this reputation would give them access to specific goods and equipment. Players can also simply stay outside of any of these factions.  Players can make their own corps and these corps can have their own allegiances and wars. PVP can happen almost anywhere but there will be repercussions in high security spaces. Attacking someone will garner a response the local security forces. Killing someone will garner an even tougher response. The speed and strength of this response will depend on the crime committed and most of all at the security level of the system, committing a crime in high security systems like the space near Earth will basically bring the might of the UEE upon you very quickly. Even if they run away they will be marked as there will be a bounty on their head. They will be be able to hide out in the lawless systems but any system within UEE control will eventually be aware of the bounty on the player's head.  Anything goes in lawless systems. Also while there is no territory control in the traditional sense partially due to the instancing system there will be things for player groups to fight over. For example there will be a limited amount of super capital ships like the strike carrier spread throughout the game world. These cannot be bought directly, they have to be stolen from the military or a derelict has to be found and repaired. These strike carriers serve as mobile base of operations and are persistent objects meaning players need to be on board 24/7 to defend it. The devs can simply seed more in the world as they see fit. Eventually they also plan on letting players fight and take over space stations and make them their base of operations.    To reiterate SC isn't going to be a sandbox at the level of Eve Online, its a different kind of game. Even though there may be some overlap of players its not necessarily made for the same type of player."
Games,3dr9q4,Daffan,4,Sun Jul 19 02:20:38 2015 UTC,"There are answers to most of these questions if you'd just look them up. Its a difficult task, but how do you know what it looks like? We've never seen a game like this being so openly developed. Do you think GTAV never had to lose a couple months to big blockers? Its not like someone is making a smal RPG on Unity here.  There are plenty of professionals with good resumes on the staff, and they probably have a pretty good idea of how this is going to work.   I don't think very many people have actually done the research and come to their own conclusions about this project, they just repeat what other people on reddit have said, because that's how you fit in."
Games,3dr9q4,faern,2,Sun Jul 19 02:07:54 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Worse is that because they liberally abused the stretch goal model, they now have a tenuous obligation to force this shit through.  Cutting anything will result in backlash.  What they should have done is made a fucking space sim.  They bit off more than they can chew harder than an amateur mod team."
Games,3dr9q4,Zethos,1 point,Sun Jul 19 03:02:56 2015 UTC,"I agree.  The arena commander and first person module is the least of their worries. Wait until they get to the persistant universe - not only will it be a technical marvel and a massive amount of content - but making it all function together in actual ""gameplay balancing"" will be a nightmare. EVE, Ultima Online, WoW (In certain aspects) have spent decades engineering the balance and it's still off - Just look at Elite, as a persistant universe/sandbox it's pretty horrible, almost a themepark (But the flying is good)"
Games,3dr9q4,muchcharles,0,Sun Jul 19 03:20:15 2015 UTC,"Yep, this sum basically everything on what i'm intended to say. This is the time to slowly introduce those gameplay feature to the player and get meaningfull feedback. Instead we have developer mucking around FPS module trying to reinvent what call of duty/bf already perfected. If you make FPS feature too integral to the gameplay, you end up alienating people who dont want to play fps and if you make it too unimportant people are just going to skip it and it end up being a wasted content."
Games,3dr9q4,barthw,2,Sun Jul 19 04:10:58 2015 UTC,"All these things are being developed in parallel. The FPS is being developed by a studio in Denver. Sure they get some support by a few people in the other studios but not everyone is working on just the FPS module. Most of their Austin studio is working on creating the stuff for the persistent universe that you are talking about.   Also the FPS does need to work at at least some basic level as the game is still played in first person (you walk around inside your ship, you walk around planetside, space stations, etc to get jobs, buy equipment, etc). Until FPS is working boarding mechanics for example can't be tested and boarding is meant to be a core part of the game."

Games,3dr9q4,barthw,4,Sun Jul 19 06:31:18 2015 UTC,The openness of the development has gone as far as inspire people to study game design and software engineering because of it.
Games,3dr9q4,Rhendal,7,Sun Jul 19 10:13:05 2015 UTC,With everyone so involved in the dev process most people will eventually grow tired as the years pass    I backed in the run up to christmas 2013 iirc and i just treat it as a nice little back burner project that i catch up on every few months. £30 back then was less than a night at the pub so even if the game collapses under its ambition and never lives up to its potential then its not like i have lost anything i cared that much about.  For me its all very reminiscent of the old days of mod development when you had the likes of Desert Combat for Battlefield 1942 or Counter Strike before it ever got to 1.6 when you basically played these mods/games knowing it was a work in progress and each update brought some exciting new stuff to mess around with.
Games,3dr9q4,SeasRough,4,Sun Jul 19 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah that is the right mindset to approach it, also similar to mine. But there are still a lot of gamers that hang onto every of CIG's words and spend a lot of time on the hype train. Just hope they won't regret it one day."

Games,3dql4j,Miia-san,11,Sat Jul 18 16:16:48 2015 UTC,Don't get too hyped. I love Shenmue. I just replayed the original on my Dreamcast a few months ago and had a blast. For its time it was an amazing game. I just can't see a modern gamer that didn't play it back in the day really being able to appreciate it as much. So many games have taken what it did and vastly improved on it. That's my opinion. Some may disagree.

I remember getting excited for Jade Empire for the original Xbox because I loved KOTOR even as someone who didn't like turn-based combat, and was hyped to see a new real-time fighting game like my beloved Shenmue. I found the combat deeply underwhelming and didn't bother completing the game even after playing for about 20 hours."

I think that an HD remaster would have been a more honest way to gauge fan interest in a sequal to a 15 year-old series. Don't get me wrong, I'm glad Shenmue 3 is getting made, I just think that saying it will be funded for $2 million and saying they need $10 million to really do it right shouldn't be the way. Fund the game by releasing it in a way that invites new fans into the series, don't solely rely on the few people that played it on Dreamcast/OG XBox to assure us that it was really good and therefore deserves our backing. They may have even gotten fully-funded much quicker."

When Athena comes back as a ghost, she claimed she had ascended or some shit. I think it would've been cool if she had started calling herself Minerva at that point.  I figure, this sets up a whole trilogy of sequels where stuff really goes nuts. Like, GoWIII Spoiler the Pantheon has been revived like Athena was, all calling themselves different names. Something happens that makes Kratos want to kill them all again (it's Kratos, this shouldn't be hard), so God of War IV is spent killing the Roman Pantheon. Then as Jupiter as killed as the final boss it's revealed that Minerva was pulling the strings the whole time, and as Kratos gets ready to rip her a new one, The Egyptian gods appear to capitalize on the power vacuum of Jupiter being killed. THEN in God of War V you form a strained alliance with Minerva to take down the Egyptian gods, but then the Norse gods come in at the end, so like, God of War VI you've got EVEN MORE gods to kill, and the final boss is a fight against Minerva, Osiris and Odin.  Because I don't see any direction for the game to go from here but further and further over the top."

The game may not be huge in scale like GTA, but it presents itself as it is.  Just before the 1 on 1 you were doing an entire stage in, out, and around Gaia, a Titan, as she climbs a mountain.  Replaying GOW3, the game is still impressive by today's standards.   There are few minor annoyances like now being able to adjust the camera but that's part of the gameplay and is used cleverly for secrets and rewards exploration.

You can glitch through walls in some areas of The Last Of Us to get places without passing through where you are supposed to, and you see very basic environments with most textures missing and most of the environment not loaded. There is no surprise that the GOW games and Naughty Dog's games look so good, it's because they are small. Maybe the above poster is a troll but he's right about this one."

You could say the out of bounds area of GTA V is the same way because you are not supposed to go there. No developer says to themselves ""Lets spend time and money to flesh out parts of the environment the player won't see.

A game like GTA cannot be that aggressive with how it culls geometry in comparison with something like Uncharted."
Games,3dq6gq,RadiantSun,3,Sat Jul 18 17:39:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah absolutely and that goes back to your comment about being linear, right.  And the new Uncharted is supposed to offer more branching paths to give the illusion its not linear.  The Last of Us did something similar.   Personally, I don't need all my games to be open world.  Games like God of War and Uncharted have set pieces that seem to only work in linear levels.  GTA and Witcher come close but it seems like they have to use cinematics when the action gets heavy.  God of War and Uncharted have entire levels designed around heavy action set pieces."
Games,3dq6gq,contrabandwidth,3,Sat Jul 18 23:38:51 2015 UTC,"I don't mind linearity either. For some reason, judging by the downvoted and the number of comments just telling me they're fine with linearity including yours, you seem to believe that I'm talking down linear games, like they're something bad. I'm not.  What I'm saying is that these games have the visual edge due to their linearity. God of War's ""sense of scale"" is impressive to look at, but it is not a particularly special technical achievement. Big environments aren't impressive when the camera will literally never, ever have the opportunity to zoom in on them; distant backdrops can range from low poly meshes with low res textures to simply being prerendered. A giant character whose arm Kratos is running around on is not impressive, it takes no additional power to render a character bigger than another when no close up detail needs to be rendered.  Even with multiple paths, the new Uncharted will benefit from having linear environments. They already do the same thing; fixed camera angles and small environments mean you can pack a lot more into each frame. They do it differently than but simultaneously similarly to how SSM does it.  What the original poster at the top of this comment thread said, albeit in a buttholish way, was not wrong. These games are prettyby virtue of their design more than any miraculous harnessing of the PS3's power. As such, they should be treated like achievements in art and design rather than technical achievements."
Games,3dq6gq,RadiantSun,2,Sat Jul 18 23:57:20 2015 UTC,"I'm not a developer, nor a programmer so as to what is being done technically on these video games is over my head.  And I can admit that, while a lot of people on the internet are self-proclaimed geniuses.  I know a lot of tricks were used to give the game a lot of false sense of scale (look at my original comment), I think that can be deduced without any programming knowledge. But what I do think takes a lot of in depth knowledge is the rendering used, the lighting used, etc. if you read the article linked DF and SSM talk about several different technological achievements that went into this game before the E3 reveal up until just before it released. The whole article talks about how they stressed the CPU/GPU of the PS3 for this game and Ascension.  I think that's why the original poster was heavily downvoted on top of being an asshole about it.  No doubt art design influences graphics but the article actually speaks of tech not just art choice.  And for whatever it's worth, I'm sorry you got downvoted.  You aren't trolling or being an ass to be an ass, but hey, whatever, karma points don't mean shit."
Games,3dq6gq,contrabandwidth,11,Sun Jul 19 00:18:09 2015 UTC,"That's what every game of their kind does. It's standard practice game design. And yet their environments and graphical quality are still visibly a notch above everyone else, which is worthy of mention. They look good, but not because they are small - if that was the reason, every other God of War and Uncharted clone would look just as great. Yet they didn't.   Dismissing the thousands of hours of work that a team of engineers spent optimizing the tools and framework to be more capable than everyone else as some random benefit that just came to them automatically because they keep their environments small and gameplay linear is pretty dishonest."

It is even more pointless to try and figure out if one thing is ""more art"" than the other.   That doesn't mean there is no discussion to be had of course, some of the points may even be somewhat valid.   Unfortunately, instead of having an interesting discussion they start with a premise (is pac man ""more art"" than the last of us), both guys pick an arbitrary side and then every point they make is primarily used to prove the other side wrong. They jump between different definitions of art and at some point even admit ""It seems like there is no concrete definition of art itself, so we should probably look at the games cultural significance"". So what, has the question become ""which game has the most cultural significance""? That's a different question.   Maybe the whole concept of the show just doesn't work for this specific question, since this is the first video I've seen of the guys I'll give them the benefit of the doubt. But I don't believe that there is any useful information or discussion about the subject in this video. At best it's a bunch of loosely connected bullet-points.  Oh and then they throw ""Ludonarrative Dissonance"" in there because .. why not I guess. The way they phrased it, they just assume that ludonarrative dissonance is bad for art, which doesn't make any sense to me.

Really, all you're doing is looking at the ratio of functionality to creativity and how much expressive freedom was performed outside of what is required for functionality. It's the type of pointless argument over meaningless semantics that is perfectly suited for places like Reddit and Youtube :D  That being said, I don't think either of them did a very good job in trying to argue their question. Pacman may have required a lot of creativity on the part of the developers in order to create brand new technical solutions, but The Last of Us allowed for a lot more creative expression by the creators.

Games,3dxr7n,pbrand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 14:01:55 2015 UTC,"It's not useless, we use it to describe something. It may mean something else for everyone, but the concept is still the same. We understand what people talk about when they say ""art"", but we don't necessarily have to accept their definition."
Games,3dxr7n,dekenfrost,0,Mon Jul 20 15:20:23 2015 UTC,"It's not useless, we use it to describe something.    What's that ""thing,"" though? You just said it's pointless to define it. What use is a term that is so nebulous and vague that it can be anything and nothing?  That's what I struggle with when so many people throw themselves at the windmill in service to calling video games art. I just don't see a point when it's become a synonym to the word ""thing,"" and everyone wants to sweep definitions under the rug as to not offend others with gatekeeping."
Games,3dxr7n,pbrand,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:28:40 2015 UTC,"Art is anything that expresses something.  I think that most video games don't express anything of value or in a particularly interesting way, but they are definitely art."
Games,3dxr7n,A_Potato_Salad,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:58 2015 UTC,"Well if that's how you feel I can't really dismiss that, but are there no things you would call art? Even if you strictly say ""only paintings in the Louvre are art"" it's still a useful word.   Yes it's very nebulous, but I feel that that's the whole point. No one else can define art for you.  I would personally call games art, no question. I look at every single thing that makes up a game, like the artwork, music, story, textures, models. Even in a game like call of duty many artists pour their heart and soul into it, so how can it not be art?  But on the other hand many people would disagree with that and see a game as the sum of its parts. Even if single pieces on their own may be art, the game is not. It's a product, a piece of entertainment there to be consumed.   And honestly I can't say that's a wrong thing to believe. It's completely valid, I just choose to define it differently.    That's what I struggle with when so many people throw themselves at the windmill in service to calling video games art. I just don't see a point when it's become a synonym to the word ""thing,"" and everyone wants to sweep definitions under the rug as to not offend others with gatekeeping.   It's always silly to try and force a point of view on other people. But I will certainly defend my point of view of calling games art. I try to do that without being condescending, without forcing myself onto others, but that's not always easy."
Games,3dxr7n,dekenfrost,0,Mon Jul 20 17:31:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, arguing whether something is art or not is pointless, since the fact that whether something is art or not is pretty much always a subjective affair. Most art that is considered ""art"" is called so because the majority says it is (or at the least the vocal majority.) But appealing to popularity doesn't make for a very strong argument."
Games,3dxr7n,Razumen,-1,Mon Jul 20 14:03:44 2015 UTC,Well it's not pointless. But this argument is. The argument in favor of pacman are obvious it's in a museum and it's part of culture. But last of us is just not good enough yet to be  as great as the guy defending it is overhyping everything about it to try and make his point. Hes comparing a game to a movie as an argument and that is stupid since game as art can't be film  since they are game. If you feel that the last of us is a good movie it's a bad game imo. BUt aniway last of us would be a bad movie. And that's why it's a game.  Tetris and pacman will age well and already have cultural significance. Last of us not really since better game will come out soon enough in the same style. It's a great blockbuster style of game.
Games,3dxr7n,The_Katzenjammer,2,Mon Jul 20 14:30:22 2015 UTC,"It really is pointless though, what I consider to be art you might not - but both of our viewpoints may still be ""correct"" as we admire each game for it's different qualities. And like I said, whether or not something is in a museum or not says little about something's artistic qualities."
Games,3dxr7n,Razumen,2,Mon Jul 20 15:25:46 2015 UTC,I mean it's a debate we don't need in video game but i believe that if all you can argue toward a game being art is that it's close to a movie. You missed the point. That's all i am saying.  If we want game to be an art form they need to be recognized as art for being game. And gameplay define a game.
Games,3dxr7n,The_Katzenjammer,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:44:24 2015 UTC,"Whether something is art is not really a debate that's really needed anywhere, but I agree that games should be judged as games, comparing them to movies does them no favours."
Games,3dxr7n,Razumen,2,Mon Jul 20 15:59:59 2015 UTC,"Being in a museum doesn't expressly make something art, neither does being part of popular culture. That definition is up to the individual. I don't consider fossils art, nor garments and arms from past peoples. They have historical and cultural significance, and CAN have artistic value sometimes. Same with Pacman-in no way do I consider it art, but I won't deny it's significance. This is a very subjective conversation though."
Games,3dxr7n,HansGruberIsTheMan,2,Mon Jul 20 15:45:20 2015 UTC,but then what is you're definition of art. Does it need to carry a message ? Or doe sit need to spark a discussion ? i mean it does not matter what you believe is true art neither do i. I personally don't think pacman is classical art it's pretty modern and also is very abstract. It make me feel good to play pacman and it's 35 years old. It's an expression of gameplay at it's simplest yet it is fun and engaging. It's art as far as game are concerned. Narrative have nothing to do with art tough. Otherwise everything that tell a story should be art and that's just not true.
Games,3dxr7n,The_Katzenjammer,8,Mon Jul 20 16:35:38 2015 UTC,"This is a terrible debate. The Last of Us is a cinematic experience, while Pac-Man is an arcade classic.

I mean, we all know that Rockstar basically specializes in open world, often freedome-based games, and they have slaughtered many settings already. Modern contemporary with basically all GTA games, the Wild West with RDR, school with Bully, the 40's with LA Noire, etc...  I think a great idea would be is Rockstar developed another game, in a totally new time setting. Theres so many possibilities, but essentially it should be something completely new, that hasnt been touched by Assassinc Creed because they've tackled quite a few settings (caribbean pirates, independance war, french revolution) but it shouldn't be based around a big event, but instead just around an era. For example, I would love to see an open world game based in the 1500's when America had just been discovered and AC hasnt touched that (as far as i know), or something like just a different place, like a south american city and culture (like mexico for example) i dont think they're done that. It would be like GTA but in a totally different place than the usual american city.  Playing around with the eras, they actually have so many possible games, basically 1 for every decade in the last century. the could do new york in the 20's, miami in the 80's (they did in vice city, but you know a new miami vice style GTA would be fucking amazing), they could do the 60's with the hippies, they could do a game based in the 50's with the whole nuclear fear surrounding it (kinda like fallout where everything seems nice but the world is in the verge of nuclear apocalypse, basically what people were going through in that era), etc...."

Anyway, their next game will be either Agent (and that's my dream game) or a new Red Dead. Bully  will eventually come but I remember Rockstar telling that they're happy fans still love and remember Bully, so they will like to go back to make a sequel some time; but for now, I think they're only getting started to write it.

The plot of ""Max is living shittily but stably, before alcohol and his desire to do right kicks in, forcing him to kill mobsters with hilarious dialogue parodying modern trends"" was perfect.  Then, unlike either of the previous MP games, he just folds and runs away to an even worse place."
Games,3dpvai,DaLateDentArthurDent,3,Sat Jul 18 16:48:11 2015 UTC,Totally! Those parts absolutely felt like Max Payne. Him suddenly just up and running was never his thing. He'd beat everything into a bloody pulp before he'd put his tail between his legs.
Games,3dpvai,freshestpr1nce,7,Sat Jul 18 22:01:52 2015 UTC,"I dunno. Having JUST replayed the entire series the last couple weeks, I think with some tweaks Max Payne 3 could have fit right in with the rest. Lots of great Noir stories (and indeed, the archetypal Hero's Journey) have a period at the end of the second act where the hero is at their lowest, and give in to the little voice telling them they've failed, just run away. Having Max Payne 3 lead smoothly into a more traditional Max Payne 4, with Max having learned in Brazil that he has a Batman-esque purpose in life to take the pain for others, would be pretty neat, I think. (Max Payne 4: The Rise of Max Payne is a little corny, but hey, maybe that fits with the aesthetic.)  The problem lies with the subtleties of the narrative in Max Payne 3, IMO. I thought about doing a whole writeup on it, and I might still someday, but basically the places where Max Payne 3 falls short in comparison to its predecessors can be summed up in four bullet points:  1: Everyone treats Max like an idiot. In previous games, the fact that he was able to mow through armies was an anomaly (""May I present to you Max Payne, New York's finest with the highest mobster kill count ever!""). He was a legendary hero in New York -- the mob was afraid to cross him. He had the John Wick thing going on. In Max Payne 3, if he gunned down three hundred mobsters but didn't complete his objective due to some kind of crazy act of God like being sniped from a helicopter during a hostage negotiation, everyone was like, ""You idiot! How did you screw up so bad?"" It didn't make any sense. Even Max does it - he's constantly saying what a bad idea everything he does is, even when it's the only option or even actually a really good idea.  2: No sense of surrealism. One of the big defining features of Max Payne is that it feels like Max has gone ""down the rabbit hole""; strange coincidences everywhere, miracles acting in his favor and against it, a subtle sense of premonition from things like television programs, billboards, and nightmares. It's very important to the ""Max Payne atmosphere"". There's a part in one of the Max Payne 3 flashbacks where you're approaching a crypt during a shootout, and the door opens by itself as you get to it -- a moment later a wounded mobster stumbles out, but in a way that wasn't congruent with the opening of the crypt door. It was perfect. The game needed more of that.  3: Max is incredibly self-absorbed in a way that he wasn't in the previous games. For instance, Max Payne 2 starts off with a monologue about the past. ""The past is a gaping hole. You try to run from it, but the more you run, the deeper, more terrible it grows behind you, its edges yawning at your heels. Your only chance is to turn around and face it.""  Notice the ""you""s. It's in second person because it's not specifically about him, it's a universal truth as he sees it. He overthinks these things because he's cursed with a romantic view of the universe, not because he's only ever thinking about himself. Compare to the beginning of Max Payne 3: ""Here I was about to execute this poor bastard like some dime store angel of death and I realized they were correct, I wouldn't know right from wrong if one of them was helping the poor and the other was banging my sister.""  Which leads smoothly into the fourth thing:  4: Everything Max says is a joke. Compare those two things up there again. The first is moody, heavy, very sad and introspective. The second has a literal setup and punchline. ALL the monologue in Max Payne 3 is like that. Everything Max says is trying to be funny. Max isn't a funny guy. It reminds me of Liam Neeson trying to do stand-up, and it ruins the mood every single time.  But these are all surface things! Max Payne is all about atmosphere, which is easily tweaked by changing a couple lines. And honestly, Max Payne 3 was by far -- far -- James McCaffrey's best voice work ever. It was flawless. If only what he was saying was a little different."

He could've just given up and still achieve the same ending."

They're not EA and Ubisoft, cranking out yearly installations of their titles; it's why the Rockstar label is a hallmark of a good game.  They take years to develop their titles.  GTA games have several years' development cycles, and the result is a series known for insane amounts of polish and packed with attention to detail.  And I'm sure now some skeptics are going to point out bugs and flaws, and sure, they exist.  But you still can't deny that Rockstar games are pretty amazingly crafted."

Yes that was awhile ago but they have been working on their next project for years now at least a small team has. If a new title fails the studio will live on no problem while many others would die. Then all they have to do is announce GTA 6 and they have another huge moneymaker on their hands. So working on a new IP for this particular studio is not all that risky.

Games,3do03y,ILIKETOWRITETHINGS,23,Sat Jul 18 14:16:15 2015 UTC,"It's been a while but if I remember correctly:  Memory leaks are when a program uses memory temporarily, typically this memory quickly becomes free to use later again but due to bad coding or whatever it's possible that this memory is never given back meaning that instead of using the same 4 gigabytes of RAM over and over again it's quickly keeping that, not using it and then taking even more memory until there's simply not enough RAM left for anything to properly work.  Heap fragmentation however means that the memory is divided into blocks (the total being the ""heap"") but the fragments become too tiny to allow for proper allocation. So unlike with a leak all the memory is in fact still there but it can't be ""found"".  Finally garbage collection is the automatic searching for memory that can be freed in contrast to the programmer specifying when what memory can be free in his code. It's basically a little tool to use for lazy people but this can heavily impact performance, it also doesn't help that garbage collection requires memory of it's own to work.  I think I got it pretty much right if I take a quick look at the definitions on wikipedia."
Games,3do03y,mysticmusti,18,Sat Jul 18 14:47:23 2015 UTC,"basically a little tool for lazy people    This is an opinion basically only held by game developers, people writing for HPCs, and people who have never written anything non-trivial.

Games,3do03y,phoshi,2,Sat Jul 18 16:41:53 2015 UTC,"My apologies if it is more widely used than I thought, from what I read I got the impression that using a GC is usually not well accepted for things that actually need to have a decent performance for a long time."
Games,3do03y,mysticmusti,8,Sat Jul 18 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Things like heap fragmentation are a non-issue with a GC.

What you don't get is predictability, which you need for games when each frame needs to take x ms and no more. You also struggle to write extremely optimised code in those cases it's worth trying to out-think your compiler. For 99% of cases, a GC is a solution which uses a little of a resource we have plenty of in return for significantly faster development and safer applications."

Games,3do03y,ILIKETOWRITETHINGS,2,Sat Jul 18 15:48:35 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to add a bit about memory leaks, because I find them interesting.   Memory leaks happen when a program allocates a certain type of memory and then doesn't free up that memory. Bytes of memory on a computers Ram have addresses that serve as a way of finding that information later (eg search in these bytes for this thing). However, when a program causes a memory leak, affected memory addresses become unusable without the computer knowing. The computer can then attempt to store information in those unusable locations without realizing, resulting in some pretty weird errors sometimes. Luckily, memory leaks are fixable by simply restarting the computer/system.   If you've ever had a computer on for a long time and though ""man, this is getting kind of finicky..."", it was probably due to a memory leak somewhere!"

Games,3do03y,mysticmusti,1 point,Sun Jul 19 02:10:25 2015 UTC,Ok that game was kind of fun. Didn't see any performance issues.
Games,3do03y,rantz0,2,Sun Jul 19 11:19:48 2015 UTC,"Let me give my own explanation.  A memory leak is when a program allocates memory but then forgets to free it. As that flawed piece of code is run multiple times during program execution the program uses more and more memory over time. Eventually it'll usually run out of memory and thus crash.  Garbage collection is an alternate technique of dealing with tracking memory allocations. With garbage collection, the program does not explicitly deallocate memory (sometimes doesn't explicitly allocate it either). Instead allocated memory blocks just sit around either used or unused. When the garbage collection thinks now would be a good time, it sweeps through the allocations and determines which are still in use. It frees the ones which are no longer in use. The advantage of this is in theory you cannot leak because you cannot forget to deallocate memory.  The real-world downsides are that it's sometimes hard for the garbage collector to determine that the program is using too much memory and it's time to clean up. Also, it might decide now is a good time to clean up and start doing so, but the process of doing so takes enough CPU time that it causes a noticeable pause in the program that is running while the memory is cleaned up. This is a major reason games try to steer away from garbage collection, because they want to control what is done when in order to maintain responsiveness under all conditions.  Finally, heap fragmentation is when your pool of memory becomes complicated. Memory heaps (pools of memory) tend to use lists of which blocks are allocated and which are not. Any contiguous section of memory that is used or unused only takes a single entry in this list. But if memory is broken up into many smaller sections of unused memory interspersed with used memory, it takes many more entries to represent the same amount of free (and used) memory.  Over time, heaps frequently fragment basically for entropic reasons. The heap tends toward disorder whereas it started out nicely with one big section of unused memory. So memory management becomes slower over time and the program becomes slower over time. It will not necessarily ever crash the program, just take longer and longer to do each memory allocation.  And of course it could be a combination of these. You can have garbage collection slowdown and fragmentation slowdown or you can have leaks and fragmentation slowdown."

Games,3do03y,rabidnarwhals,256,Sat Jul 18 09:07:56 2015 UTC,"Imagine you’re visiting the local library with your two old pals, Bob and Alice.   Bob is an upstanding citizen and custodian of public services. He frequents the library every day of the week, checks out 3 books, and returns them the next day.  Alice, on the otherhand, is a little forgetful. She tags along with Bob and also checks out 3 books each day, but unfortunately only returns 2 of them the following day - keeping one for herself at home. She’s finished reading it, but because she hasn’t brought it back, nobody else visiting the library can check it out. As the weeks pass by, Alice is stacking up more and more books and the library has fewer and fewer to offer.   Alice is Prototype, the books are chunks of memory, and the library is your machine. Somewhere in the event loop of the game, memory is being allocated for objects but not being freed when it’s no longer being used. This leads to slow downs, as “the library” is running out of “books” to lend each time a program visits to check some out.  When you hear people talking about “garbage collection”, it’s intended to mange this."

A single guy could possibly take me out, and my powers don't feel that intense. In fact, most of the time it feels like a simple third person shooter, because your main attack is shooting bolts out of your hands.  In Prototype, you're a beast. You can rip through an army and destroy everything within a block with one move. You feel like a force to be reckoned with, and the combat, while admittedly mindless, felt more rewarding and visceral.  It's a shame this port was so lazy. I've seen a few articles openly shit on these games as if they're shovelware, and it's honestly not really fair. People praise Hulk: Ultimate Destruction for its sense of power and destruction, and Prototype is the continuation of that. They're really fun games, and I think they deserve more than this."

In Prototype, you're doing shit like running straight up the side of a skyscraper holding a dude by the neck then power bombing his ass 70 stories down onto the pavement. Plus elbow dropping tanks so hard they EXPLODE.  Then you have Infamous; where you get to shoot either little bolts of lightning or slightly bigger lightning balls and the dude can only jump like 15 feet.  Lame as hell."

The problem is that in all three games, most of your attack is just some underwhelming melee attacks, and shooting bolts (or one of Delsin's powers) out of your hand like bullets.  Sure you get things like little ""grenades"" and the big powers that you have to build up, but aside from the latter, they just feel like a third person shooter as I mentioned before, and not like I have meaningful power."

With prototype 1, we got a taste of a cool game drowned in a ton of annoyances and problems.  The worst thing was how the game felt inorganic: it was like different teams cared about powers, control scheme, level design, enemies, and they never talked to each other. There was a lot of cool stuff that just had no use in game, and sometimes only a very minor change would have greatly improved the experience.  Prototype 2 just sucked hard. The final boss alone is enough to explain everything that is wrong with that game"
Games,3do03y,hey_aaapple,9,Sat Jul 18 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"I think Prototype 2 was better than 1, personally. The combat, movement, and powers were all drastically improved, and the overworld was less drab and lifeless (that's not to say it wasn't still a bit drab, it was, but it was better). The story might've been bad, and Heller might've been less interesting a character, but I think everything else was improved.  And hating a game for not being as good as it could've been isn't really fair. Sure, you can be disappointed or criticize them, but these games are treated like they're awful, and they aren't.

The glitches it has are slowdown (mainly when starting a new three-day cycle), audio stutters, and random crashes from time to time.  The only thing I can think of that would prevent you from completing the game is if you used a save owl and the game crashed after reloading the save (considering the whole ""temporary save"" thing with the owls and all).  It's definitely the worse of the two Majora's Mask ports (Wii Virtual Console was significantly better performance-wise), but not one of the worst ports/re-releases ever."

The PS4 version seemed to remove all aspects of a RNG system for battles to where it is fully going to play out the exact same (numbers/crits/enemy types/amounts) every time. To where you can load a save, walk 5 steps go into a battle and get the same enemies that use the same attacks for the same amount of damage EVERY SINGLE TIME you load your game.  Then, the music that plays continually in the background resets to the very beginning after each battle, so you end up hearing only the first 10-15 seconds of the track while playing, since it just starts over and over after battles.  Throw in a few other bugs... and it seems like Remastering a remaster that was bugged, and then refusing to do ANY form of patching is a bad idea... yet they still sold that bitch for 50$ or whatever and people ate it up.

Not to mention any extra work that might be required to get the game to run good (unlike Mass Effect)  and patching if the game is to broken/rounds to bad.  Why would and dev/publisher in their right mind allow/want this,  honestly?  EA does because they got a ""special relationship""  with MS this gen (money talks)  and releases some games (still waiting for a battlefield or some big title)  but other pubs like Activision,  Betheseda,  why would they? Dlc sales?  (negligible at best)  At any time they can get a crappy studio to do a cheap port and sell as ""HD remake""  and rake in some cash instead,  just like Activision does here.  The while backwards compatibility thing is most likely going to stay at indies/live Arcade and the odd MS/EA low level title. HD remakes is just a better investment in most cases,  although I'd love to be wrong."

Games,3do03y,acondie13,18,Sat Jul 18 04:47:10 2015 UTC,"Okay, since everyone else is being miserable about this, I'll say it: I like Prototype 1 and 2 quite a lot, and I think it's completely shameful that Activision tossed a great franchise into the freezer, shot Radical Entertainment in the head and then put out this half-assed remaster. Prototype is one of the few games to make getting around its sandbox actually entertaining, which is crucial to its longevity. The combat is mindlessly entertaining, and in Prototype 2, there were actual glimpses of good writing overshadowed by a plot that took itself a lot more seriously than it should have. I don't think it gets nearly as much credit as it should.  But just to pivot, can I raise the point - again - that this is why companies should never make a new console unless they can make the next one backwards compatible? Because now, we have to rely on corporations like Activision and their bullshit attitude towards remasters (we choose the game, you buy it now, we patch it later if we're in a good mood) in order to access our favourite games from the last generation. You drop $60 on a copy of a game you already own just for the privilege of playing it again on a modern system, and suddenly you find out that it runs even worse than before (and we all know Prototype 2 was a low-effort POS when it came to optimization, especially on PC). You're out $60 for a shit game that was better on your old machine, Activision gets a couple pennies along with absolutely no accountability, and the game industry suffers as a whole."

Also, yes, I'm totally blaming the console creators for this as well. I don't care how difficult the PS3 architecture was to emulate: they should not have released the PS4 until they figured out how to do it. Full stop, end of discussion. You can't take away a console with tons of games, replace it with a console with no games, and call that an upgrade. That's completely insane. And claiming that backwards compatibility is irrelevant is akin to claiming that we should erase the English language every half-decade, thus making all the art that came in the previous cycle completely illegible, in exchange for a couple more letters being added to the alphabet."

Not an apt comparison, because literally no one is forcing you to buy a new console at launch. In fact, you can keep your old console if you buy a new one. I still have my PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii. Sure, not everyone can afford that shiny new game system without turning their old one in, but then why not just wait?  I want backwards compatibility as much as anyone else and it really sucks that the PS4 doesn't have anything for that except for the sad excuse that is PS Now. I do doubt that PS3 emulation will be in a Sony console for some time, if ever, because it's a miracle that thing even ran games like GTA V and Uncharted 3."
Games,3do03y,ThatParanoidPenguin,3,Sat Jul 18 02:48:35 2015 UTC,"Sorry,  but no. The main reason Sony shifted architecture was to get cheaper devs and production costs,  as well as making backward compatibility easy next gen.  Emulating ps3 is not going to happen,  they need to rewrite the code which takes time/is expensive,  only way to get good backward compatibility would be to include ps3 hardware in the ps4 making it bigger,  hotter and more expensive (like they did with ps3 or Nintendo with Wii /U).  Last but not least,  few people care for old games, sorry,  last time I checked leas then 10% ever used the feature on their 360 within the first 3 years (when old games till was kind of hot)  and even Sony dropped the feature since so few used it.  Backwards compatibility is nice,  but seldom used by customers,  hence it goes away. If you dislike it,  buy a Nintendo console that's been using the same architecture and hardware for years,  and is quite limited thanks to it,  or buy a Pc.  Consoles are made for playing the games of one specific generation,  anything more is just a bonus..."

You're confusing shitty publishers with remakes in general. If you don't want to buy good remakes (like The Last Of Us, or Banjo Kazooie's 360 release, the Resident Evil remake on GameCube, or Wind Waker HD) then that's your choice, but you shouldn't speak for all of us when we don't all share your view.

Games,3do03y,poehalcho,24,Sat Jul 18 02:41:06 2015 UTC,The combat was shit. They literally removed half the button input on game with 2 button combat. They traded half of the moves for quick ability swapping. It's a trainwreck of a change.  Doesn't help that the map got split in 3 areas either.   Really nothing of the good old Prototype is left in the game (apart from some recycled animations).    The story is horrendous as well. I went into PT1 expecting a terrible story and was actually surprised with it being kind of not bad. PT2 went way lower than that original expectation.   The entire game is just a mess...  The only improvement are the graphics and the jump mechanic (although now you can't abuse the air boost anymore...)
Games,3do03y,TheGasMask4,35,Fri Jul 17 22:13:36 2015 UTC,"I actually think Prototype 2 is much better than the original, and is a good example of K.I.S.S (Keep It Simple Stupid) in video games.  For starters, I thought the combat was better. Prototype felt like an absolute cluster fuck, and the weird combos didn't help at all. Each of the game's five or so weapons had a long list of combos that required long combinations of button presses, pauses, analogue stick movements, and more (At least of what I remember, its been a while). Combine this with the fact that many fights were basically massive swarms of enemies, and the most effective tactic was almost always ""just smash the basic attack until everything is dead"".  In Prototype 2 you could equip two weapons at once and each weapon had two combos each: pressing the button and holding the button. Some weapons could interact with each other (for example, the tendrils can tie down a larger enemy, then a blade can cut off their arm) and it was much much easier to use the combo you wanted at the time you needed it.  As for the story, I feel the same way. Prototype had this weird confusing story that came in unconnected out-of-order chunks on the condition that the player could find the collectables. Prototype 2 had a simple revenge story and a good emotional tie with the main character's search for his daughter."
Games,3do03y,censored_username,6,Sat Jul 18 02:20:59 2015 UTC,"and the most effective tactic was almost always ""just smash the basic attack until everything is dead"".   Maybe on easy, but on hard that would get you killed very quickly in most fights.  Also, how is a larger moveset a bad thing? Prototype had a lot of edge-case moves that were useful in certain situations. Also, the charging mechanic (In prototype 1 it also mattered how long you kept buttons pressed) had a really nice tradeoff between risk and reward.  And really, the list of combo's was really not that bad. For every ability it basically went like this Square(S) - normal Triangle(T) - special SS / SSS / SSSS / ST / SST / SSST - combos In the air (not gliding) T - aerial special While running: T - running special  This of course next to the variety of acrobatic attacks, where the actually interesting things were. I admit that this selection was somewhat confusing, but it was very fun to master.   In Prototype 2 you could equip two weapons at once and each weapon had two combos each: pressing the button and holding the button. Some weapons could interact with each other (for example, the tendrils can tie down a larger enemy, then a blade can cut off their arm) and it was much much easier to use the combo you wanted at the time you needed it.   It however greatly slowed down the pace of fights (since you had to charge to do any kind of special) and the combinations were mediocre. It could've been nice, but there was only one interaction between abilities, being tendrils to lock someone down + any other ability to tear them apart. This meant that in practice you'd always be fighting with tendrils + something. Why not take tendrils out of the offensive ability section and just have it always available.   Prototype 2 had a simple revenge story and a good emotional tie with the main character's search for his daughter.   Maybe I'd been able to appreciate it more if his general dialogue was more advanced than the words ""shit"" and ""fuck"". Otherwise, Prototype 1's story was pretty interesting too once you had made sense of it all.  Of course, Prototype 2 did have some good parts. The dodging/shield mechanic was a lot better than prototype 1, and made melee combat more viable (where hard fights in prototype 1 were usually endless acrobatic spam using musclemass). I just dislike how much of the complexity and freedom from prototype 1 they took away. One good thing they introduced though was the ability to dash-grab something when airborne, because that was incredibly annoying not to have in prototype 1.  If you'd take the good parts from both games, you could make a really nice game.  Keep Prototype 2's dodging and shield mechanics. Take prototype 1's combat, but the ability balance of prototype 2 (prototype 1 had a large problem where musclemass and sword were basically better than any other ability). Keep the way Prototype 1 handles ability charging, acrobatics and devastators. Also, keep the upgrade system from prototype 1 because ""you deal 10% more damage to infected"" is horribly boring and prototype 2's abilities were horribly unbalanced (Destroying helis and tanks in one shot?, being bulletproof?). Take the world from prototype 2, although favourably merge it into one zone. Also, keep the hunting mechanic, although maybe make it more interesting than it leading you directly to the target. Finally, keep prototype 2's bossfights."

They were all the same shit every time.  PT1's boss fights were great. Especially the fights vs Cross, because it somehow actually felt believable that a human could fight him with proper gear and damn good reflexes.   The only things I'd take from PT2 would be:    The graphics (definitely not the designs though) The new jump mechanic with button hold instead of charge release The CQC combat style (dodging and countering) Tendril power. It has potential.   PT2's shield was quite boring... Shields from everything and you can't move. It's just a shell.  PT1's mobility shield that bounced back bullets but ate explosions was much better. And I really miss the fullbody armor. It just looked totally badass. And combining it with musclemass you could jump on top of people and make them explode in a pool of blood, just like in Mario :D  edit: wait with shield you meant the counter mechanic, yeah that's ok. we can keep that too :P"

I liked fighting mercer's lackeys though, because they actually made the melee combat fun. The problem with prototype's bossfights on hard mode were that melee was basically useless. The only way to win them was to musclemass throw objects at the bosses, use vehicles or devastators, because getting in melee range was certain death. In pt2 however getting into melee range was useful because they were too fast to catch using throws or vehicles.  And I guess the pt2 shield was a bit too strong. The counter mechanic it had was nice though, but that it blocked basically EVERYTHING was a bit ridiculous. It should have only had the split-second functionality, then it would've been nice."
Games,3do03y,poehalcho,7,Sat Jul 18 17:35:10 2015 UTC,"I'm positive the combat in the prototype consisted mostly leftclick spam combo and right-button holding. There wasn't much mixing involved at all, the combat was extremely simple, similar to SSB's.  left click -> chain of 'regular' attacks with w/e weapon you are using at the time.  right click -> weapon's special cool abilities like claws charge, or throwing yourself into the distance with those big anti-tank arms.  There were a few minor abilities required directional input. The only 2 I can remember were a shoryuken and a football kick.  All the stuff was extremely easy to memorize and execute. All you had to do was read the move list in the menu."

Games,3dn3hl,kurisu7885,815,Fri Jul 17 18:32:15 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest, I'm not sure how I feel about the dialogue options being changed. You could have up to 10 responses to a character and possibly more in Fallout 3 and NV, depending on your stats. But 4 options that are bitesize to read, yet come out completely different to what you wanted to say? It was an issue I had with Mass Effect too, You see an option for ""No"" and it comes out for hyperbolic example -""I hate your entire family and especially your cat! so I will have to politely say go die in a hole, but no thank you."" The most famously misleading version of this is with L.A Noire, Where you don't quite trust someone, so you click ""doubt"" to which you'd expect more questioning, but in reality, Cole starts ranting and insulting the person.  I hope/wonder if this will be optional, I do absolutely appreciate the voice over work, but I personally still prefer the silent protagonist with text based dialogue options. I guess I'll just wait and see.  It also appears like power armour is going to be a special occurrence rather than loot in your inventory, not sure about that either."
Games,3dn3hl,LolFishFail,165,Fri Jul 17 18:29:51 2015 UTC,"I don't think four button means four options tops. Other games that share this same quick dialogue system almost always have one option that isn't a dialogue option but rather a sub menu with more options whenever more responses are required.   That said, the quick options are often misleading in games. Even in this short trailer that one line about food really threw me off with the line that was acted versus my expectation from the option. Bioware uses emotion symbols to give more indication of where the option is going, adding those might help explain what these two word option really are. Alternatively, I don't see why they couldn't still have the old full text menu (complete with first person rather than cinematic camera angles) as an option even with voice acting addition."

In Fallout 1 and 2 power armor was hard to get because it basically made you invulnerable to all forms of small arms fire. 3 and NV it was really no different than the other armors and you didn't feel like a hulking mass of destruction. Personally, I think they got that part of power armor right here. My only gripe is that it seems to slow you which was never the case in any of the previous games."

Games,3dn3hl,JonBanes,33,Fri Jul 17 23:26:21 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's an issue. It'll probably be the biggest issue the game will have, honestly. That and the usual onslaught of bugs obviously.   I'm kinda conflicted about it. To be honest, I'm not the biggest fallout fan  (even though I've played most of the games) - so such a big change doesn't really bother me that much. But for people who actually who enjoy roleplaying in this series will certainly feel shafted. Despite what some optimists are saying, I don't think the main character's voice will be togglable (that just doesn't make sense from a dev perspective, especially when you take into account the cash they dumped for the voice actors). From this little dialogue snippet we've seen with Mr. Handy, I also think it kinda cements the idea that there will only be four options given (some others assumed that selecting one option would open into four more additional options to choose from). I don't know... to me, that's something that'd they would probably introduce a little earlier into the game if it was even an option? But from the intro to here - there's nothing. If such an option did exist - I'm certain they would have demonstrated it in the initial trailers.   This is obviously to be expected when you bring in a voice actor and you're trying to tell a more coherent story. I'll probably play the game just fine. But you'll almost certainly need a mod to disable the main char's voice if that's what you want - and even then you're still left with a gimped selection of dialogue options. This, and the suspected new skyrim-influenced ""skills"" system has me thinking that Bethesda want to broaden the market a bit with FO4. And I'm sure that a huge wave of angry fans will crucify them for attempting to do so."

They did an alright job of DC in Fallout 3, but the destruction and colour of the buildings all looked very samey. Everything was washed out grey, I have to believe there was some sandstone buildings or something but hey there you go.  The look of the main city in Fallout 4 looks pretty amazing. I'd like to see more gameplay of that. I'd also like to know if we have to go through arbitrary gates from ""the outside world"" to ""the inside the town world"" or whether the newer hardware allows us to have seemless transitions into towns and buildings now."

My only real complaint about the asthetic was that the destruction and worn out look of everything was exactly the same no matter where you were in the wastelands. But I think a lot of that had to do with the limitations of PS3 and XB360 as well, much easier to keep 150mb of textures that are applied to 90% of the surroundings in memory than constantly load something different for different corners of the map."
Games,3dn3hl,GameStunts,15,Fri Jul 17 19:30:12 2015 UTC,"Yeah looking back, I'm amazed they were able to do as much as they did. As much as the assets look the same, there is always something to be looked at. You are always rewarded for your efforts.

Games,3dn3hl,Trackpad94,390,Sat Jul 18 04:20:13 2015 UTC,I'm not at all excited about the dialouge system. I don't care if the character's voiced. I'd rather he wasn't so that the character you play as can be whoever you imagine in your head. Also the previous system where you select word for word what you're going to say is better. None of this vague one word clue with no hint of tone that can lead to you doing something you had no intention of doing like in Dragon Age 2

Games,3dn3hl,tonequality,56,Fri Jul 17 21:37:48 2015 UTC,"The robot asked if he wanted food, so the character's response made sense to me."
Games,3dn3hl,Zaemz,66,Fri Jul 17 22:59:27 2015 UTC,"But you gotta admit that the first impression that maybe comes across when you see the command is ""Oh! Food sounds good!"" not ""What the fuck are you on about?  Sure, whatever, get some food.""  That's kinda how I interpreted it.  I guess we're also kinda missing a little bit more context for the situation, unless all that was shown was it, really."
Games,3dn3hl,Volundarkvioa,14,Sat Jul 18 02:54:50 2015 UTC,"I think what Yomoska is saying though is for them ""get food"" would translate into a response like ""oh god, yes! Please! I am fucking famished!"" or ""Yes, Codsworth. Please get me some food"" instead of ""food? I-I'm trying to figure if my wife and kid are alive. But...But I guess some food would be good, yeah"".  (Keep in mind those are obviously not exact with what the protagonist said or exactly how Yomoska read it, but what I think they are alluding to is the way the PC addressed the question is different from how they interpreted the PC might respond to it)"
Games,3dn3hl,maverck,44,Sat Jul 18 03:41:58 2015 UTC,This is what i loved about the original dragon age. You saw EXACTLY what your character was going to say. Then they dropped that system for future games and it frustrated the hell out of me.

Games,3dn3hl,Heterohom,35,Sat Jul 18 02:41:57 2015 UTC,"It was originally ""Force"". The devs changed it to ""Doubt"" because test players rarely chose ""Force"" because it sounded like an aggressive option with no benefits to them, while in actuality it was meant to be the best option for when players doubted a suspect's statement but had no evidence to back up their suspicions. But they made the decision to change ""Force"" to ""Doubt"" so late in development that they had to keep the aggressive and accusatory dialogue of the ""Force"" options."

Mod creators will probably make do, but now they're going to be limited in what they can do with the player dialogue. They probably won't be able to have you ask questions about new locations or people, and it'll probably reduce the number of snarky comments you can give.  Also the issue that my soldier, cowboy, assassin, nerd, psychopath characters all have the exact same voice, which might annoy me a bit.  Not gonna stop me playing mind you, but I think I'd prefer no voice-acting, at least for most runs. Maybe there will be a toggle?"

Games,3dn3hl,DerFelix,953,Fri Jul 17 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"Confirms what I thought. It looks like the feel and movement is going to be very similar to Fallout 3. Yes, the animations are improved somewhat but it still looks like the enemies are just entities that soak up damage (with no real reaction, except for exploding in the end). The movement in first person still looks like you are on a perfect plane, just hovering over the ground.  All of this is not enough to make this an undesirable game to me, but yeah, it's very Bethesda."

Games,3dn3hl,Volcanicrage,97,Fri Jul 17 20:13:07 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if they let you try out Power Armor early on, but make you wait until you get training to actually run around freely in it.  Power Armor is too damn iconic to the franchise to limit to set sections, but, like you said, I highly doubt you'll get it early.  That said, this may be a bait-and-switch- the power armor segment could just be from the part of the game where you finally get it, and have nothing to do with the clip preceding it (note the weather change).  It'd hardly be the first game trailer to show two segments chopped together."
Games,3dn3hl,mdp300,44,Fri Jul 17 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"That's kind of what they did with the Fat Man in FO3. You can get it really early and use it on the Behemoth, but you only have like 3 shots with it, and it's in super bad condition.   Maybe you get a set of power armor relatively early, but it breaks, and it takes a while to fix it."
Games,3dn3hl,givesomefucks,26,Fri Jul 17 23:00:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that also explains why you have one in the garage.  Yours gets fucked up after the firat time you use it.  Instead of waiting for training you wait to get parts.  If they keep the drop in, maybe have it on a cooldown when your done, and only available when youre outside."
Games,3dn3hl,Jaon412,9,Sat Jul 18 00:48:51 2015 UTC,"With all the references to the male protagonist being a Veteran, he may have already had power Armour training in Operation Anchorage or any other war, which is why he's familiar enough with the t45d suit in the trailer. It likely gets damaged / its power core depletes and it becomes a quest to repair it."
Games,3dn3hl,superhobo666,4,Sat Jul 18 05:40:42 2015 UTC,"Well he did put a new core in before climbing into the armor. It also looks like the armor actually works like lore, you can see how it enhances your strength and such (taking multiple hits from deathclaws, and that high jump)"
Games,3dn3hl,Frostiken,9,Sat Jul 18 07:54:57 2015 UTC,"Power Armor is too damn iconic to the franchise   To be fair, I've always thought how power armor worked in FO3 / FNV was complete shit. It was just strong armor. It didn't even carry its own weight, it did nothing special whatsoever. There were a bunch of mods that improved the experience (some for FONV added all sorts of technogizmos like thermal vision you could use, FO3 had one where you had to keep it fueled with fusion cells).   I also kind of like having my own unique 'style' and running around in a generic power armor suit that looks like everyone else was deeply unsatisfying."
Games,3dn3hl,Xciv,29,Sat Jul 18 04:22:55 2015 UTC,Hopefully it's just a taste so you know that power armor is something to be pursued. I thought they said they were giving you power armor customization? That wouldn't be a thing if it were just a set piece.
Games,3dn3hl,TheWinslow,19,Fri Jul 17 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"They didn't just say it, they showed the power armor customization during E3. You can change each arm, each leg, the head, and the torso independent of each other."
Games,3dn3hl,codeswinwars,5,Fri Jul 17 21:54:26 2015 UTC,"They also show the player calling in a vertibird at one point with a flare. My personal theory is that Power Armour will be an asset the player can call in when necessary but that they're not going to be marching about in all game. This would explain how it could be useable and also have a physical presence in the game world. It makes sense that way, then it's more like a rocket launcher or the Fat Man. Something you're going to want to use but it's also incredibly powerful so there are gameplay restrictions preventing you from using it all of the time. Of course this may be a big turn off for some people but I'm okay with it. In the Fallout lore Power Armour was so powerful that it basically won the US a war, it makes a single soldier into a walking tank. In the recent games this has manifested as a bit of extra damage resistance and some stat bonuses, it doesn't quite fit and this sidesteps that issue by making it powerful, functional but limited. Hopefully that will also make it feel special."
Games,3dn3hl,Maschinengewehr,8,Sat Jul 18 00:52:51 2015 UTC,"yeah, I thought it looked pretty cool. The HUD is a cool idea, and maybe power armor will be more than just a set of armor. Hopefully other helmets/armors have different HUDs too"
Games,3dn3hl,JamSa,311,Fri Jul 17 19:56:39 2015 UTC,I prefer games that don't have headbob so you aren't walking around like a drunken sailor. Valve games do it and I never want them to change it.

In Bethesda games it always feels like you start and stop moving instantly, but still delayed. It's weird.  Edit: Oh and something I forgot was the movement of weapon models. You can't really see that in this demo, so maybe they improved it, maybe not..."
Games,3dn3hl,tropicalfroot,116,Fri Jul 17 19:42:30 2015 UTC,"I've always expressed this as one of the reasons I don't like bethesda games (Not to say they're not good). When most of the game is exploration and movement, I feel that poor movement doesn't do everything else justice. It's always felt like the game is having to recalculate where you've actually stopped after you stop.  Though I am glad they've gone away from the 180 head turn to talk to someone conversation style."

Games,3dn3hl,Feet2Big,97,Fri Jul 17 19:45:47 2015 UTC,"Headbob takes away from immersion for me. The world doesn't bob around when I walk in real life (or at least my brain corrects it on the fly). Also, when I talk to someone in real life, the rest of the room doesn't go all blurry. I hate when games force my view on something, they might as well just stop rendering background altogether."
Games,3dn3hl,sdpcommander,71,Fri Jul 17 22:23:37 2015 UTC,"This. I don't see why headbob is seen as more realistic. My head stays relatively still while I walk, and even if it does move, my eyes can stay focused in one direction."
Games,3dn3hl,DubiousDrewski,51,Fri Jul 17 22:53:25 2015 UTC,"The thing is, a game can have good or bad bobbing. In real life, your head bobs, but your eyes effortlessly stay fixed on where you want to look - unless you're running. If the walking head-bob in a game doesn't model this, then it feels distracting and unnatural.  But in my opinion, a perfectly smooth glide is MORE immersion breaking by far."

Games,3dn3hl,Tokentaclops,164,Sat Jul 18 01:57:46 2015 UTC,"how long is that going to be a viable excuse though? The game is arguably starting to suffer for it and eventually, whether it be now or in a few years, they're gonna have to upgrade."
Games,3dn3hl,LagrangePt,32,Sat Jul 18 03:38:13 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to cost / benefit analysis. ('A' refers to using a different engine, 'B' refers to continuing to upgrade Gamebryo)  First consider internal costs:  A)  License the new engine, train up all employees on using new the engine, re-write tools, game systems, AI, etc from scratch.  Also probably have to pay the engine's developers for support.  Possibly higher content creation cost for more complex animation systems / whatever.  (This will either delay the game's eventual release by at least a year, or shrink the overall content in the game by something like 25%).  B)  Employee an engine team that can keep upgrading the creation engine and creating new tools to speed up content creation. (This costs enough money to employ 5-10 high end engineers full time.)  Then consider the impact the decision will have on revenue from the game.  A) Game will run smoother, less bugs, animations might look a bit better.  Probably less content, cause your devs spent time learning the engine rather than making content.  Modding (a core attraction for your previous games) will take years to become really good.   B) Game will be a bit better than previous games, but not quite on par with AAA games with huge budgets and limited content requirements.  Modding scene will be good within months of release (when you're still charging full price for the game).  As long as their engine team can make the engine good enough to prevent huge losses in sales due to the drawbacks, the investment required to use a new engine will never be worth it.  If they really want to catch up to the highest quality AAA games (almost never worth the money to do this), they'll probably be better off pouring money into upgrading their current engine than converting to a different engine."
Games,3dn3hl,APeacefulWarrior,23,Sat Jul 18 04:12:33 2015 UTC,"Game will be a bit better than previous games, but not quite on par with AAA games with huge budgets and limited content requirements.   This is something I think some people don't really get about Bethesda's games:  They will never, ever be on the same level graphically as other AAA titles.  The amount of interaction and live scripting makes it impossible.  That's why so many AAA games are basically on-rails, so every sequence can be optimized to its fullest potential to make for super-shiny graphics.  When they're having to really render a live world, in which the player can go to pretty much any vantage point and NPC actors may be doing emergent things a mile away that the game has to remain aware of, that cuts deeply into the hardware budget for great graphics and awesome particles and all that stuff.  (Not to mention the insane amount of terrain.  You can see for literal miles in every direction, especially in Skyrim.)  Like you, I think I'd prefer that Bethesda stick to working with what they know, and refining those techniques, rather than trying to start everything over from scratch."
Games,3dn3hl,shrogg,32,Sat Jul 18 07:52:07 2015 UTC,"Im one of the devs working on Skywind and my god Gamebryo is horrible. The thing with Bethesda game studios is that they don't even use modern rendering techniques. The amount of shortcuts they take is astounding. The .nif file format is as archaic as it gets (Seriously, when will they move on to something vaguely modern like .FBX)  It goes as far as a lot of the assets in Skyrim were set up for a Physically Based Rendering setup, however they ended up going with the standard Diffuse, Spec and Normal map pipeline.  Its not just the fact that the engine is ancient, Its that they have to use old workflows that really do not fit in with a modern studio environment. Imagine what they could do, say if they were using UE4, They have source code access so that any engine-specefic changes are easy to make."
Games,3dn3hl,Frostiken,10,Sat Jul 18 09:50:06 2015 UTC,"a ton of the mods for each bethesda game are just ports of popular mods from the previous games   Not true.  Besides, the biggest problem with the current setup is their fucking scripting system. These games are infamous for becoming slow, stuttering, crashy, buggy trainwrecks if you install too many mods, and that's almost completely caused by Papyrus logjamming up. God help you if you ever want to remove a mod.  We shouldn't even need the 'script extenders', but we have them for every game since Morrowind."
Games,3dn3hl,panglacticgarglblstr,4,Sat Jul 18 04:17:03 2015 UTC,"There haven't been too many mods that were ported between Bethesda games, except in the case of Fo3 and NV, and there certainly won't be any mods from previous fallout games ported to Fo4, besides raw assets or really rudimentary scripts.  What would be affected by an engine change is that the skills for modding carry over to the new version of the game engine at each iteration and a radically different game engine would slow down the modding scene, but only for a short time.  If I know how to script for a mod in NV, I can script for skyrim too.  It's the same language with more features at each iteration.  The plugin files and assets work the same way with each version of their game engine too, and developers can more quickly write tools like TESEdit to modify those plugin files."
Games,3dn3hl,ieverin,23,Sat Jul 18 04:05:42 2015 UTC,"My comment here gets into why Gamebryo (called Creation Kit for Skyrim) isn't necessarily the best modding tool. I guess if you're talking about porting content between Bethesda games or supporting the advanced/established modders who have direct experience with their engine, that's true. However, not evolving your technology simply because your modder userbase is too well acquainted with dated software is kind of absurd and a bad position to put yourself in.  I respect Besthesda for having one of the most usable modding tools out there, I wish more companies were more open to releasing their editors and assets to the public so that modders and starting developers could get experience working on games they love. However, having worked with their editor, I'd only recommend it because it's pretty much one of the only options out there to get developer modding experience on a shipped title. A few classes of level design students can attest that it is not a joyous experience working with it. Contrast that to the fact that when I open an editor like Unity or Unreal Engine, I'm pretty much always excited and happy about it."
Games,3dn3hl,Frostiken,25,Sat Jul 18 02:14:29 2015 UTC,"People talking about it being 'modder friendly' aren't talking from any standpoint of actually modding it themselves, whatsoever. They're just making shit up to defend Bethesda.  The scripting engine in Gamebryo / Creation games is a completely pain in the ass."

Games,3dn3hl,irotsoma,69,Sat Jul 18 00:06:10 2015 UTC,"On the plus side it looks like power armor is going to feel more like wearing a walking tank rather than it not making much difference in feel from wearing nothing at all.  I always thought power armor was way overpowered simply because it didn't have any disadvantages like it would in reality.  Like more deliberate movement/stiffness, limited turning speed, limited use of small arms due to the size of the glove fingers, power constraints, etc.  Agility modifiers really don't make that big of a difference compared to the advantages.  It doesn't look like they've done a lot, but maybe enough that mods could deal with the rest.  I always like the Powered Power Armor mod for New Vegas, but it didn't deal with the stiffness and feel of wearing something like that."
Games,3dn3hl,MrManicMarty,60,Fri Jul 17 20:10:39 2015 UTC,"Well, Power Armour isn't really much of a hinderance, like there aren't many actual down-sides to using it. Your not going to be any slower, it's hydraulic so it'll carry it's own weight, and I think it should make you faster honestly (in-lore, not sure though) - that said I do hope it's balanced alright."
Games,3dn3hl,irotsoma,17,Fri Jul 17 21:51:43 2015 UTC,"Faster, yes.  But it's never going to be as flexible or agile as the human body.  The body moves and absorbs shock in many ways beyond simple hinge or ball joints.  There is a lot of flexing of the torso for example or shock absorption by the bones.  So even if we assume that the power armor parts can react nearly as fast as a human muscle, there's still going to be a different feel even to walking, definitely to running or turning.  Anyway, I haven't done a great detailed analysis of it, but I think especially the heaviest armors with solid plates in the various bone sections would be pretty cumbersome regardless of joint flexibility.  Some of the lighter ones with various plates might compensate enough to feel like almost nothing."
Games,3dn3hl,JakalDX,8,Fri Jul 17 22:08:10 2015 UTC,One could argue that's why you have to get trained in Power Armor use before you can use it
Games,3dn3hl,Volcanicrage,24,Sat Jul 18 02:20:11 2015 UTC,"Maybe it'll nerf the piss out of stealth (or even render it impossible)- power armor in the past hasn't done nearly enough to limit sneaky gameplay.  It also appears to limit movement speed, although that could be the gatling gun."

Games,3dn3hl,elguapo1991,6,Fri Jul 17 19:40:24 2015 UTC,"They also put the ""(Y) perk chart"" prompt off the Pip-boy screen   Maybe because it's implying that the ""real"" button to take you to the perk screen is on one of the non-visible sides of the pip-boy.  A more plausible explanation is that the perk chart is in the pip-boy somewhere, but after finalizing the interface, they decided they wanted to give players a quick way to instantly get to the perks screen no matter where they were in the pip-boy.  If this is true, it may be evidence supporting that perks are more important than they were before, and the theories that perks and traditional stats have been merged might have weight.  All wild speculation of course. Either way, it doesn't really bother me."
Games,3dn3hl,The_Dirty_Carl,17,Sat Jul 18 02:49:44 2015 UTC,"Plus, the Pip-boy UI was pretty bad in FO3 and FNV, and it doesn't look like they've improved it much."

I have an idea though and it depends on that massive power armor with the complimentary laser gattling gun that comes with it that we keep out back.

I guess the whole sequence with the little band of survivors, power armor and Deathclaw was like a tutorial, something ""epic"" for the player to do early on and be introduced to a few things.  I wonder what the ""core"" bar in the power armor is for, it didn't move once in the trailer, maybe it's the charge of the armor and it's just ""infinite"" for the sake of that introduction. (After which it promptly failes...)  It's not uncommon for games to give the players a ""taste of power"" early on before taking it away.   And that little band of survivors could be good tutorial buddies I guess. One of them instructing you to find or craft a certain item, another suggesting building a shelter, or traveling together to the first major hub.  But that's all speculation.   I really like the weapon stuff though, these cobbled together rifles and guns, looking for individual parts instead of the whole weapon."

If you're looking for entertaining matches with lots of action and lots of kills (or untraditional drafts), I can recommend following Cloud 9, Team Empire, Fnatic and Natus Vincere (also known as NaVi).

Not that Valve need to care much about losing those viewers since numbers will be insane nonetheless - but it's a bit sad to know I won't be able to follow this year's TI.  On the bright side it looks like the prize pool has been distributed a lot better this time around -- and fighting for $6mil is going to make it an insane tournament.  Hope that there's some place in the GC convention center where they stream this... Not that I'd have time to attend during the event itself :(

Not just the combat and in-flight stuff either, but nearly every menu-based action is done on a menu in your cockpit that your character looks at to interact with.  Or, in the case of VR players, they actually look at where the menu holograms are located and they spring to life. In fact I think the greatest triumph of their UI is having solid VR integration that's still just as effective and immersive on a standard screen."

You could make any HUD you wanted, you could see through the ship itself, you could even use a variety of different wavelengths to build your image, rather than just visible light. Also, of course, the HUD would head track with you, so vital flight info was never out of view.  I'll never understand why space sims cling to such a low tech representation of technology, and such an uninspired view of what such future life will be like. Its like they're still trapped in the 70s as far as sci fi go."

Conduit for the Wii allowed you to move every element of the HUD around to put it wherever you wanted it on screen. Battlefield 4 allows you to customize the colour, opacity and size of the HUD elements. Many games allow you to turn off certain parts of the HUD. What we need is a game that combines all of these ideas so that every part of the HUD can be moved, turned off, made more or less transparent and have the colour adjusted to something more to your liking (especially important for colourblind players). Don't care about your ammo count? Get rid of it and use the space for something else. Hate looking in the bottom corner for the minimap? Put it right on the edge of the screen. While not being a developer myself, I can't imagine it being too hard to put these customization options into the game (with the possible exception of moving HUD elements around, but Conduit still managed to do that)."

That particular example looks hand crafted.  The general point is valid though, UI modding and some self awareness is a good teacher of what makes a interface, what the game needs to communicate to you, and what you need on screen to control the game.   I found the trick is to put up only the information that you absolutely need for your role, and that your ""visual processing bandwidth"" is limited. If you put up too much you'll never pay attention to it all, and you certainly don't need everything all the time, but perhaps you need to be able to get at everything, and maybe later (which isn't the same thing)."

Don't forget target and focus bars, as well as your own health bar. Lots of downtime too, so bring chat forward as well.

Games that have more going on during active gameplay (as opposed to things you really only deal with directly while in the menus) have a harder job to do if they want to present all the necessary information in an equally clean fashion. That includes several of your examples. It also includes most other RPG's and most MMO's. You can't make a HUD that's so simple it doesn't serve the game well (and many would argue that Skyrim in fact fails that test)."

Skyrim can have a small minimalistic hud because  There is no requirement for a map, there is no party system, no raid bars, no ability bars (WoW needs these to be shown at all times due to how many spells you have).

Games,3drrtq,theseus1234,12,Sun Jul 19 05:31:54 2015 UTC,"I think one of the reasons to display information on the bottom right is to keep the player's field of view clear. Especially in shooters or games with competitive multiplayer, moving information to the bottom right has the advantage of not blocking the left side of the screen. If your target is to the right, it's already tough since the target has to pass through the gun as you adjust the reticle and you may lose track of it partway through readjusting. Having a target to the left offers no such disadvantage and developers may want to keep that side clear.   I may be way off base, but that's just my impression."

Ammo in current weapon I rarely check, mostly guesstimate and I'm going to reflexively reload at some point any way. Total ammo for weapon is also rare since it only becomes an issue after minutes into a life.  Health, probably the most important info from that area, so yeah I do check more, but only if I've been shot.  Even then hit feedback - sound, full screen redness/pulse, low health sound is enough to let me know I'm at a bigger risk without needing to know the exact number.  So I'll mostly check if healing up under pressure and gauging whether I'm happy to make my move. Don't need to look when I've healed to full health because there's an audio cue."
Games,3drrtq,MisterDeclan,3,Sat Jul 18 21:55:46 2015 UTC,Also I think having the ammo counter on the right makes sense as the gun model is on the right. So looking right below my weapon to see the ammo counter seems intuitive.

DBM bars is a requirement as well, for example.  What are you going to do to show all that info? Flickering screen colors and other random stuff? You need that information in hard text or numbers, or else it is too hard to put into use.

This is what i mean by the information is pretty much REQUIRED to be on screen at once, and in some cases is hard to understand because it's all numerical and text.

Games,3drrtq,Kangalooney,2,Sun Jul 19 11:28:04 2015 UTC,"Eye tracking starts top left of the screen. This is pretty independent from reading direction but the presence of text will bias the starting point.   For active and on-screen motion the eye will tend to track the action on the screen resulting in the centre of the screen gaining the most attention in games. This is why many game developers are looking at alternative ways to present the information.   If the eye does track away from the middle it will typically be towards the bottom middle and then scan towards the right.   The eye won't tend to track back to the top corners unless there is something to engage they eye and actively grab the attention such as an animated counter, even then the eye tends more towards the right than the left (once more, written language has minimal impact on this)..  There is a huge amount of research on this very topic and most of the games that put the HUD along the bottom make significant use of this research and experience.  Some starting points.  Kill Zone 3 eye tracking  XBox and Kinect  There is a lot more available but the best ones that I know of are behind paywalls for print journals."

The other way you can have is the player has to be able to make good assumptions about the state of the hidden UI. i.e. if the game hides the health bar when it's full, it needs to be consistent about it so that ""hidden=full"" assumption always holds true. It can communicate state without displaying anything.  Another option is to keep the information displayed, but less prominently when it's not needed, for example putting a shadow behind text and increasing the size of the UI element when it's important."

Games,3drrtq,Thedutchjelle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:25:25 2015 UTC,"I think the Civ games do a pretty damn good job at presenting a nice interface. Sinds the game IS pretty much the interface. There's a TON of information regarding the world, but I never felt confused or limited by the UI in either Civ 4 or Civ 5.    I find that the minimap on the left-corner is a thing they should never change, as that's kinda the standard by now. I'm used to it being there in games, especially FPS/RTS.  In my view, the minimap is more important in any shooter. Atleast in BF3, I never really cared about my ammo count."

It is also highly moddable, allowing you to add new pieces of HUD for information not displayed otherwise (such as glider attitude meters) or replace parts of the HUD with something slightly different."

All those things let me know the situation, what's going on, and it feels more like I'm commanding troops with data intel coming back to me.  Some games can do fine with minimalist approaches, but I hate the overall trend to minimalism, especially when there's crucial information I'd rather know by at the very least an icon somewhere then to just die only to release I'd be poisoned but didn't know it because of some stupid interface decisions."

Now, I'm not saying that every person has the required attention span to play this game for years without getting bored, and the number of players online will undoubtedly dwindle over time as the hype for the game dies down.

The beauty of Rocket League is that it is nothing like a traditional sports game:  it's extremely easy to get into; there's no complicated rule set -- it's basically, hit ball with car into the opponent's net; the five minute matches hit the sweet spot in terms of game length; and even though it is a simple game, it has a high skill ceiling.

But the problem with that comparison is that this would also be true for those games as well. Except they avoid that by:    A.  Appealing to a non-gamer crowd that doesn't play games as often and therefore doesn't get tired of them as quickly. and... B.  Releasing a new game each year with an updated roster and slightly updated gameplay.    Rocket League can do neither of these things.    Hell, that isn't even including the fact that creating games to compete with madden, fifa, etc is impossible in every single way.      And sure, pretty much every single game has peak activity near it's launch window. That isn't a comment on whether or not Rocket League has staying power, but rather a comment on how few other games in the industry have much staying power either.    You want an example of games with staying power, look at something like LoL, Dota 2, Counter Strike, TF2, Minecraft, any Blizzard game, etc. Few of those games had their peak activity near launch.  They started small and then kept growing larger for various reasons.

A major beef people have is that it's the same mechanics on the same map, over and over. The fun doesn't come from the map, it comes from the players. Flipping around and trying to hit balls might not sound fun, but it's a thrill setting up the perfect goal, or saving the ball with a bycicle hit. I would certainly recommend playing with at least 1 friend, since the fun really comes from trying to coordinate these crazy moves with people, especially since controlling the ball is so challenging.   While it all seems repetitive, think about soccer. Its always the same rules, same field. But it's the players and skill, along with the desire to hone these skills that make it all worthwhile.

These maps were never aimed for competitive use but instead as a fun alternative.   I agree the map concern isn't to bad, but since the first game had this variation it makes it somewhat valid.

Eventually Lirrk will go play another game, northern lion may keep it in his rotation with isaac and a few party games.   Really we need a spectator client. Tournaments will be the lifeblood of this game, and it will bring it up to a static 8-9k average during non tournaments, with spikes of 15k+ during tournaments.   The target for twitch is above minecraft, which generally sits 7-10k. The reasoning for this, is minecraft is usually middle to the last game in the game list for page 1. Games below (click to show more) will never be popular, and are propped up by spotlight or paying for promotion. Games on first page have ""I don't really want to watch a moba or fps, why is X here, might as well check it out."" And if Lirrk or another popular streamer isn't the top result, then your game has long lasting force.

It had a lot of different maps, the same 'complex and skilful' gameplay (even some different gamemodes), yet... It died out almost instantly (you could look for matches but you'd only ever find like two other people searching games). It was fun while it lasted but it really didn't last long.

I mean, don't get me wrong, there will come a time where no one is playing Rocket League anymore but boiling it down to flipping cars is like boiling down football into guys kicking a ball around."
Games,3dp9g3,Paz436,1 point,Sat Jul 18 06:29:48 2015 UTC,"I agree.  While it's refreshing to see a FotM game that ISN'T an early access survivalfest, I don't see it having particularly lasting power.   It'll be popular for a couple of weeks before simmering down significantly."

I'll definitely be adding it to the list of perennial multiplayer games that I play. It's great playing by yourself and it's even greater playing with friends. Shit this game even has split-screen. It's awesome."
Games,3dp9g3,Arsalan85,5,Sat Jul 18 06:27:31 2015 UTC,"I'd say the main appeal to me is the big effort put into the multiplayer : cross PC/PS4 check, offline local check, local + against other people check, 1v1 check... etc. I'm pretty sure games like towerfall would have been wayyyy more popular if they had this effort put into the choices of multiplayer. It's awesome !"

If you keep waiting then your fear of it going old will definitely hold true.  I doubt this game will be half as popular in a couple of months.    The fact that you're even asking this question probably means that you know a bit more than those who think that this game's high skill ceiling is going to keep it popular forever. This is just another FotM twitch game and half a year from now you probably won't hear it mentioned at all.      If you buy it now though, I'm sure you'll get your $20 worth though.  Stop wasting time and just pick it up to have some fun."

Games,3dp9g3,Fraugheny,2,Sat Jul 18 07:57:31 2015 UTC,I could see it being more fun with friends but that's kind of the case with anything. I don't know. I like the core mechanics but I'm already a bit tired of the lack of variation. Physics based stuff can definitely extend the fun of a game by adding in more nuance and randomness but with this it's almost all it has.

If anything I'm just now starting to feel really confident in my ability to play--getting timing down for a high bounce or bicycle kick is tricky at firs, but once you get it down you feel like Ronaldius Prime, so incredibly satisfying.   I would say there definitely needs to be more content. More customization for the cars, perhaps other maps with other environmental hazards/elements. If something like that gets added (I'm sure it will, the game is super new) I can see this game having LONG term staying power.   As for now, it's incredibly well balanced and skill based, so I can see this game even in its current state having excellent staying power for competitive gamers."
Games,3dp9g3,AtlasRodeo,-1,Sat Jul 18 14:28:54 2015 UTC,"this seems to be only getting bigger and bigger. Defintely not the same staying power as LoL or mobas, because it's more casual. But it certainly has a lot more staying power than Splatoon and shooters. Essentially because it offers more at a lesser price. (free on PSN+ and $20 on PC) Which also means the player base will spike radically every Steam sale, because it has cross-compatibility PS4 + PC like FF XIV"
Games,3dp9g3,ManateeofSteel,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:23:05 2015 UTC,"At the end of the day, you're playing cars that can flip on essentially one map.   Fifa games are still popular online, but at the end of the day you're using guys to kick a piece of leather across one map. This game has enough skill depth to keep it going online, plus you have a combined player count from both PS4 and PC (also I heard Xbox One is getting this game, so maybe they'll be joining in). Honestly, this game has players hooked. I doubt it will die down any time soon.  edit: Downvotes?

This also sort proves the point that having a game delayed for PC is much much better than having it released when it isn't ready. Had Rockstar refused to delay GTA V so many times, it would likely have turned out significantly worse than it is currently. Even though the community started hating them and getting angry with them for the delays, they did the correct thing.   Warner Bros should have delayed it in the first place, as should ALL companies porting a game to PC when it isn't ready. A broken shell of a game is much worse than waiting a few more months.   And I am speaking as somebody who bought it on launch day and can't pull above 20 FPS."
Games,3doglu,_BreakingGood_,83,Sat Jul 18 00:49:22 2015 UTC,"The thing is for a series so popular we should not be having this issue at all.

I hesitate to recommend it, because I know it's antithetical to our enthusiast community, but if you wanna try the game out, consider lowering the resolution. The game held up well for me at lower rez even with my equipment being several tiers off what's current.   The story in B:AK is really good and if you're a fan of the series, you're probably going to have a really good time with your playthrough. Whether it happens now or happens in August, I hope you're looking forward to the journey. =)"
Games,3doglu,wingchild,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:14:10 2015 UTC,Yeah I know how great the game really is which is why I am going to wait until the patch is released before I play it. I want to experience it at it's absolute best when I finally give it a real try.
Games,3doglu,_BreakingGood_,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:23:05 2015 UTC,"I have to wonder how big is the impact of holiday season on PC.  I am guessing there must be some, but I would also be it is nowhere as big as the impact it might have on consoles.  Releasing a broken game on holiday season is probably worth it on consoles in terms of revenue, just because of how many teens and kids are getting them as birthday gifts. But now with Steam Refunds I think it might be worth for publishers to skip it, I doubt there are nearly as many PC games being given away as gifts and I think its overall easy for the PC crowd to stay informed (steam is basically the front page of PC gaming and the reviews at the bottom will immediately tell you if a product is broken)"
Games,3doglu,pereza0,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:46:23 2015 UTC,"This also sort proves the point that having a game delayed for PC is much much better than having it released when it isn't ready. Had Rockstar refused to delay GTA V so many times, it would likely have turned out significantly worse than it is currently. Even though the community started hating them and getting angry with them for the delays, they did the correct thing.    I really don't mind botched launches like this, because it means I can get steam keys on grey-market websites for 20 bucks. Let them reap what they sow."

I've put 25hrs into it and I fucking love the game, I'm a little disappointed with the lack of brawling boss fights (like Deathstroke & Bane from previous games). But its a great entry in the series, and easily beats Arkham Origins, I'd say its just under AC personally.  I really miss the difficulty in the challenge maps, they just feel so bare bones."
Games,3doglu,tarishimo,0,Sat Jul 18 15:57:25 2015 UTC,"It's contentious, but ""Now I get to play Arkham Origins"" is not a super great consolation prize"
Games,3doglu,SonicFlash01,20,Sat Jul 18 00:57:09 2015 UTC,"For as much hate as that game gets, I found it to have a better story than both Asylum and City. Haven't finished Knight yet, so I can't make a call on it. I think a lot of the problem people had with Origins is that it didn't really do anything new; for the most part it was just more of the same. For me though, I was happy to have it. I think these games are phenomenal. I also think people didn't like the fact that someone other than Rocksteady made it. This is their franchise, their baby, so it wasn't a ""real"" Arkham game. Oh, and Origins has the best boss fights in the whole series (with the exception of Freeze in City, an mayyybe Sacrecrow in Asylum, but I don't think that counts) hands down. That's one area where Rocksteady just can not figure it out, and it's almost become the Achille's heel of the series. For as flat out brilliant as the Mr. Freeze battle is, and I think it's one of the better boss fights in ANY game, I struggle to name even one other decent boss in any of their 3 games.  I'm only 70% of the way through Knight, so maybe they have a trick up their sleeve, but seeing as how I've yet to fight even one boss so far, I'm not so sure."
Games,3doglu,spdbump08,5,Sat Jul 18 02:00:59 2015 UTC,"I'll give you that Origins had the best story. Largely because AA didn't need one or bother with it and AC was weird. However AO also had the least reason for the city to be blanketed by criminals and supervillains. AA and AC were actually prisons and in AK the city is in a state of riot, looting, and crimes of opportunity. But in AO it's just Christmas Eve.    AO blew its strongest boss right at the front. Deathstroke was probably the hardest part of the game. They also gave you the grapnel boost right at the start when it was an experimental prototype in AC, and one of the audio logs asserts that someone died in a car accident several years before cars were commercially available. It was a good game, but it has brothers that are very good."
Games,3doglu,SonicFlash01,5,Sat Jul 18 02:19:37 2015 UTC,"They sort of side stepped the grapnel issue. In Arkam City it was the Grapnel Boost. In Arkham Origins its the Grapnel Accelerator. The Grapnel Accelerator was slower than the Boost, so it canonically sort of makes sense and can be handwaved by the Boost being a prototype with speed improvements that Batman hasn't tested yet."
Games,3doglu,Blackadder18,3,Sat Jul 18 05:29:30 2015 UTC,"Oh it definitely has it's flaws. I won't argue that. And like I said, I absolutely love the series as a whole. I think every one of the games is incredible. 8 year old me could only dream of games like these; something that puts you so convincingly in the cape and cowl. I think they're the best superhero games ever made, and anything else is a very distant 2nd place. I just see Origins get hated on a lot, and maybe it's because I went into it with really low expectations, but I thought it was great. The entire time I was playing it I kept saying to myself, ""I don't know what everyone is talking about. This is really, really damn good."" Just my two cents, anyway.   Edit: Grammar"

Games,3doglu,pottyaboutpotter1,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:45:57 2015 UTC,But in AO it's just Christmas Eve.   And there's a city wide curfew in place because of how bad the crime in the city is after dark.  The police are practically a paramilitary trying to keep control though it's heavily corrupt.  Of of which makes sense given that this is Batman's origin point.

It didn't have any real gameplay improvements, but there isn't anything wrong with the gameplay. It's basically Arkham City: Part 2. The story was great, just like the other 3, and younger versions of Penguin and Joker were fun to see.   Also, it was the only game with good boss fights."
Games,3doglu,Wombat_H,2,Sat Jul 18 02:12:13 2015 UTC,"but there isn't anything wrong with the gameplay.   AO is definitely my favorite in the series, story wise, but I got pretty frustrated with the combat at times. In the other games, hitting the counter button would always interrupt your current action, but in AO, you couldn't counter in the middle of an attack. It wasn't so bad once I got used to it, but I preferred the interrupts for sure."
Games,3doglu,GnarlyNerd,2,Sat Jul 18 04:06:27 2015 UTC,That was so frustrating in origins. Sometimes it even seemed like I would attack an enemy before they would attack me but they would still end up hitting me first because there was no way to interrupt some of batman's long attack animations.
Games,3doglu,Stealth528,0,Sun Jul 19 03:03:42 2015 UTC,How is that a bad thing? It means you have to commit to a swing instead of being able to go backsies whenever you want.

Batman wouldn't stand there and get hit so he could finish taking a swing; he'd divert his attention to the attacker.

Games,3doglu,GnarlyNerd,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:53:44 2015 UTC,"Mr Freeze in AC was neat, and AA had some variety (last boss notwithstanding). AO had Deathstroke at the beginning, and it was challenging, but that was basically the hardest point in the game.    They've grown comfy in the Arkham formula. AA was fresh and new and wonderful, AC added a bigger overworld (which changed it from a Metroidvania to an open world thing and added gliding, which was something I enjoyed enough to overlooked the crappy story. AO added nothing, really. Still snowy, bad guys littered about for no real reason, same gadgets retconned into the past, etc. No new mechanics.    AK isn't much better, honestly. They had to knock a lot of ""sense"" out of the way to drive the batmobile through. None of the puzzles make any sense anymore and the major ""keys""/upgrades for the puzzles don't seem to work like you think they should. Some Riddler trophies exist before the related story component activates.    Would I be less impatient about AK's faults if my nerves hadn't been worn down a little with AO? Possible, but that's unfair. I guess I just feel that AO didn't innovate; it just held the fort until AK."
Games,3doglu,SonicFlash01,5,Sat Jul 18 02:31:05 2015 UTC,"I guess I just feel that AO didn't innovate; it just held the fort until AK.   This was always the plan and you set yourself up for disappointment expecting otherwise. However having said that, considering I traded in the game after the Batmobile made me lose all replayability, i'd rather there wasn't much more innovation to be honest.   If and when WB Montreal do another Batman game, it'll be better than Arkham Knight to me if they get rid of the tank."

I had optimizations in place that let the secondary weapon bars fill after just a couple tank kills, so all I had to do was do a few dodges while putting shots through the turrets of the smallest drones, and boom - secondary weapons are up.   Being able to turn 2 or 3 enemy tanks to my side at a time was a big help, and I deeply under-rated the multi-lock missiles for much of the game. (Couldn't figure out that I just had to spam X on the gamepad instead of individually trying to lock targets.)   The EMP burst was handy, but didn't last very long; multi-missiles and enemy conversion were much better for my style."

Also make sure your constantly moving, as soon as they all line up their shots, use the boost to move back the opposite way. USE THE DRONE HACKER (holding 2 is the default), it takes over as many drones as you have secondary power levels built up, I'd say its the most useful gadget in vehicle combat.  I didn't have too much trouble with them, had to retry the last few a couple times."

Also if you use it on the small tanks' tiny, slightly purple lights you get perfect shot, though it can be hard to hit them. I only did it to get a trophy and get higher score on the challenges.  There is way too many tank missions in the game.  SPOILER (I'M ON MOBILE):  The Deathstroke battle was a let down. A stupid tank battle. I got exited when he jumped out of the tank. Was looking forward to a fist fight, then Batman just got him and put him in the Batmobile in a stupid cutscene."

This is a situation where WB Games would have been far better off delaying the release and doing proper QC on the PC port - they'd have encountered less ire, wouldn't have 8k negative reviews on Steam from enthusiasts, etc. While their first-week sales were good their first-month sales tanked hard due to having to pull the game from the Store page. That could have been avoided.  I think WB is learning - they got in front of the problem fairly quickly, acknowledged their fault, said they're changing how they review port quality, issued an apology, then set a concrete date (even if it's not immediate) for the release of a patch. That's good stuff - they're setting expectations, giving people something to look forward to.   All they have to do now is actually meet those expectations. That will go a long way to making things right for folks."
Games,3doglu,wingchild,2,Sat Jul 18 16:10:00 2015 UTC,Remember how they delayed this game by almost a year so that it would come out right? I do.

Those aren't the individuals that they are trying to win over. They made an incredibly smart move by pulling it from the store as fast as they did. A lot of people who didn't preorder didn't even have the opportunity to buy it because it was down so fast. When it goes back up, there won't be anything to say other than the game was broken. Something that most new consumers won't even think twice about.  This isn't about trying to win back people who already moved on. It's about trying to convey goodwill to the individuals who didn't buy the product when it was busted."

I agree, but this ""they will never be forgiven"" disposition is a real thing in the gaming community. Just look at the treatment DA3 got from people on boards like this. So many people stating ""they fucked up DA2 too bad for me to care about this"", ""they had such bad writing on ME3 how can I even play another game they make"", or ""Bioware just rushes their games out for EA deadlines"", but Dragon Age 3 was a game that distinctly made fixes based on fan complaints. The world is large, open, and sprawling, the story has a lot of consequence points based on previous games, and it in no way felt rushed. Still ""we can never forgive"" Bioware because they made an average game and a game with a bad ending. Seriously, every side of the gaming community is just turning so shitty."
Games,3doglu,megatom0,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:19:32 2015 UTC,"I think over-reaction like this is a good way to show the publisher that we really don't like what we are doing.  I mean. Honestly. We are all keyboard warriors on reddit. Do you really think noone will buy another WB/Batman game because of this? hell no. We just say it because we really don't like it. What people say with ""never be forgiven"" is generally actually more along the lines of ""I really wanted this game, but it wasn't up to my expectations.

Games,3doglu,Po0zleP0under,5,Sat Jul 18 06:51:20 2015 UTC,"That they released AK in the piss-poor state it was and will never be forgiven.   To me this is a major issue with gaming right now. Companies make mistakes, but they should also have the opportunity to make up for those mistakes. Granted I think WB should give the PC gamers a bit more than pretty words. But if they said they would be offering free or discounted DLC I would accept that. I mean Bioware was in this position because they had some under par writing for ME3, and now they ""will never be forgiven"" even though they went to lengths to change this. Not to mention you still had people shitting on Dragon Age 3 over DA2 and ME3, where DA3 was clearly addressing issues that fans had with both series."
Games,3doglu,megatom0,-1,Sat Jul 18 04:14:22 2015 UTC,"The problem isn't that just that people didn't like what WB did. They knew it was in this terrible state and thought ""Eh, screw it."" I'm sorry, but that's a company I'm not gonna put much trust into as a PC gamer."
Games,3doglu,Ultimatenut,6,Sat Jul 18 04:18:52 2015 UTC,"I will agree that they definitely knew it wasn't in a great state. I don't know if they knew how bad it was. I honestly, don't feel like I have a good perspective on how bad it really is because the game ran fine for me, and a lot of the issues I read about came from unlocking the frame rate.   Having said that I feel like their reaction was appropriate, and I feel like it is them taking steps to rebuild trust with the PC gaming community. I feel like some companies would just say ""fuck it"", but they are doing something to make reparation. I do think that this should be approached with caution though, as only the treatment of their next game's port will really tell (that is if they actually bother with porting another of their games)."
Games,3doglu,megatom0,-2,Sat Jul 18 04:31:16 2015 UTC,"If they just said ""eh fuck it"" there would be a class action lawsuit happening, no if ands or buts.

That's not to say I think they should have done better and gone the full self-flagellation route (I'm waiting to see what the end result is before deciding anything), but it's not especially worthy of praise either."
Games,3doglu,TNorthover,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:31:42 2015 UTC,"Really they should give some free content for this, some free costumes would b e fine IMO. Also as someone who owns the game and beat it to 100% completion with no issue, I would hope for something because the season pass I paid for has only given me like 4 new costumes, on release day I had like 8 but apparently when all this shit went down they removed a bunch of the alt costumes.

Whilst inspecting this new found equipment he is ambushed by another ork. In reflex of his new target the guardsman points the shoota at his foe and the gun fires, killing the ork dead.

IIRC it doesn't quite work like that anymore.  An ork can't just pick up a broomstick, think it's a gun that can blow up a moon and then immediately fire it. But if his shoota has parts that should by all rights have broken ages ago, or a defect which means it should have exploded the first time it was fired, it won't.

Games,3dmc9i,Harabeck,66,Fri Jul 17 15:01:25 2015 UTC,"It manifests more as their magic.  IIRC the shamans act as WAAAGH lightning-rods for the orc army, the larger and more energetic/bloodthirsty the army the greater the shamans magical power.  It's because they don't use ""real"" magic but essentially crazy fucked up telekinesis/telepathy.  I can't remember where I read it but I think this can also account for things like Gork/Mork apparitions (their foot stomping an enemy), it's just really, really focused tele-magics.

Games,3dmc9i,Resentful_Toucan,42,Fri Jul 17 14:04:15 2015 UTC,"Well, the human empire in 40k starts on Earth, as in an alternate version of the real world, where Fantasy is clearly some other place. The humans 40k all originate from that empire as colonists, and I don't recall anything about the Fantasy lore that could be used to support the humans being colonists at some point (though my Fantasy lore is lacking). I've heard people say that Fantasy takes place on some backwater in the 40k universe, but I've never seen lore to back that up."
Games,3dmc9i,Harabeck,17,Fri Jul 17 14:13:10 2015 UTC,"That was my assumption to be honest, that the world that fantasy takes place on is one of the millions of planets in 40k."

Games,3dmc9i,OrbitalStrikeBadger,12,Fri Jul 17 14:42:03 2015 UTC,Would that explain why every race just so happens to be on the one planet?
Games,3dmc9i,Resentful_Toucan,38,Fri Jul 17 14:47:18 2015 UTC,"Not every race is there, but it can explain a lot.  We can assume eldar and humans got there a long time ago. Dwarves may be native, they have no 40k equivalent anymore. Chaos could come and go to a degree even with the warp storms, and they could have tracked some ork spores with them.  It works if you take a bit of creative license."
Games,3dmc9i,OrbitalStrikeBadger,12,Fri Jul 17 14:53:15 2015 UTC,Pretty much It's sort of hinted at (in older lore anyway) that the Slann and Lizardmen are a product and servants of the Eldaar who brought them there (and possibly other races) through warp gates before that system collapsed.

There are two distinct classes, orks and gretchin. Orks are the big guys, who only get bigger over time. Gretchin are tiny goblin-like creatures who do all the heavy lifting/repair/squig(pig) stuff for the orks.  Orcs are more of fantasy orcs, with sharp pointy bits. The army also consists of Giants, Trolls, Squigs, Dire Wolves, Dire Boars, and pretty much anything else greenskins can goad into battle. Think of it as the 'stereotypical enemy list' from most RPGs.  Universally the bigger Orc(k)s are the meaner ones, moving in size from boy to nob to warboss.  If you have any questions I can most likely answer them."

I was more thinking about what the different was between them as beings? Like when /u/ShinCoal said Orcs are not Orks?

I am one of the biggest fans of the total war Franchise but they have done a terrible job supporting and appreciating their fanbase. The last straw for me was Rome 2. Such a letdown. Nickle and diming the customer with things like ""Blood Pack DLC"" and new factions etc.  I dont mind paying for additional content if it merits the price, like say expansions. And they have made some good ones for sure. Fall of the Samurai is still one of my all time favorite Total War products."

I probably put twice that into the original Medieval. The real-time part seems to stay about the same with fancier graphics, but the strategy part seems to be getting worse and is less accessible. I also didn't like the map art direction they took starting with Shogun II (which I have about 60 hours invested). I skipped Attila entirely because the series has lost the fun.

Shogun 2 Total War seemed to be relatively well done overall. No major complaints from me.  Rome 2 total war really hit home for me because I felt deceived. The game did not live up to the promises they made. But it sounds like they did right and brought it back up to speed. If they can learn from their mistakes on Rome, I think they can totally hit it out of the Park with this new one. It seems like they are having a lot of fun with the material."

Example: I play as the Geats, and I wipe out a ton of the estern german tribes. I don't have the money to settle them, so I raze them to prevent more enemies from coming out of there. For reference  its about 10k gold to resettle a razed province. I do this and get like 6-7 empty provinces. Meanwhile some 2 province minor power who is my Vassal state begins settling them. So I now have a vassal state, who pulled 50k gold out of its ass to become almost the size I am."

Each faction is lead by a legendary leader who cant die, but has his own ability trees, quest arcs, equipment and upgrades etc... and then you have other characters that CAN die but also level up and gain strength and abilities.  These characters act like agents on the campaign map but unlike agents in the other Total War games they also fight and can join units on the battle map.    They basically said the lack of a family tree in this one is because no one dies from old age in Warhammer."

Games,3dmc9i,DundonianStalin,9,Fri Jul 17 13:53:09 2015 UTC,I don't know about that. Seems the trailer is trying to show how the total war stuff can work within the high fantasy setting. So in the end it does show something...  Though my gripe is that this isn't the trailer they had behind closed door at E3. That showed off more units and spells from both the orc and human sides from what I have read.

You can even drop your stuff in one region, leave said region, and come back later to get it (did this after the Kaer Morhen main quests in Act 2)."
Games,3dnd8d,MisterSlickBack,9,Fri Jul 17 20:01:35 2015 UTC,I still keep stumbling across a bunch of useless letters and papers I dumped early in the game somewhere in Velen.
Games,3dnd8d,TomPalmer1979,5,Fri Jul 17 21:07:23 2015 UTC,"Gotta deal with gaming tropes though. Its plenty common in games for stuff on the ground to get culled, or to be locked off from areas. Chests are the standard answer to this, so people are only going to feel comfortable with that solution."
Games,3dnd8d,CutterJohn,2,Fri Jul 17 21:39:08 2015 UTC,I'd like to hear this from OP.  why are they a pain to craft? I haven't made any since I need to be like level 37 and I'm level 27.
Games,3dnd8d,Cryse_XIII,3,Sat Jul 18 08:47:10 2015 UTC,"Not OP but I've made the mastercrafted feline set on two different files. It's largely a pain because you need to get the upgrade diagrams from several different locations scattered across the map. At times many diagrams will be in the same chest, which is convenient, but you will still need to seek these diagrams out for each tier of your gear (enhanced, superior, and mastercrafted).  So it can be time-consuming with that in mind. Adding to that, you'll need the necessary crafting materials on hand as well. This usually isn't a problem if you're meticulous in picking up everything you find, but you can still find yourself short a material or two, which you may need to acquire through dismantling, crafting from scratch, or purchasing.   It isn't a terrible process, but it can be a bit of a drain on time as well."
Games,3dnd8d,LostLozenge,4,Fri Jul 17 20:06:43 2015 UTC,"yeah but the diagrams stay forever once you have them, so why make all of that stuff spread out and keep it when you can make what you need, one at a time and then once you have everything can do all of it in one go."
Games,3dnd8d,Cryse_XIII,2,Fri Jul 17 20:21:37 2015 UTC,Each set of Witcher Gear has different stats and strengths. I would assume players carrying multiple sets on-hand like experimenting with those. I preferred finding one that suited me and sticking with it but I can see where others are coming from as well wanting to switch things up every now and then. The new stash addition should make that more viable than it was.
Games,3dnd8d,LostLozenge,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:32:59 2015 UTC,"I don't. Anything other than bleeding and/or burning is a waste IMO, since bleed is a better poison and burn has the property to stop any animation the enemy is currently doing plus ridiculous amount of damage rather than the slowdown that freeze causes. And the other stats are just to compare higher numbers, mainly the attack value. stuff like armor piercing or extra EXP seem useless to me since I haven't noticed a difference in damage due to those values.  Other than that each weapon has the same attack-animations, so there is nothing to switch up."

Is it some weird contract where if they say the same exact line of dialogue, they don't have to pay as much?

Games,3dmsty,Apathy_is_Death,30,Sun Jul 19 21:31:43 2015 UTC,"Even though 13,000 lines of dialogue is a lot I'm still concerned about the dialogue in general. From what we've seen from the gameplay videsos it seems most of the options include a good/neutral/bad and maybe an exploration-based response.  This is similiar to what ME had but it was fine there because Shepard was an established character pretty much, he had his own backstory and you didn't really RP your own character. Fallout is known for its open-world and freedom of choice, does this mean we're going to be ""locked"" into a certain personality?  I hope there's still dialogue responses that require skills, perks, etc. kinda like what New Vegas had."
Games,3dmsty,CutterJohn,3,Fri Jul 17 19:17:15 2015 UTC,"Unless you're able to read more subtlety into a line of text than I am, the rest of TES and FO games have pretty much had a good/neutral/bad personality in dialogue options as well.   I really don't see this changing much."
Games,3dmsty,ofNoImportance,6,Sat Jul 18 08:23:32 2015 UTC,"I should've clarified a bit more. Those options are fine on their own but if they are the only options you're basically following a linear path more or less when it comes to dialogue. That said I think most of Bethesda's dialogue was usually some kind of info dump, you asked a lot of questions and got a lot of responses. You weren't really lead into a certain personality role by the developer itself.   I'm not saying either option is bad or good, but going into ME style dialogue might limit some part of the roleplaying you can do with your character.   NV dealt with this a bit better because certain skills influenced a specific dialogue branch, it lead to more outcomes. It meant your choices in skills/perks which defined your character also influenced the dialogue. I hope to see this return."

There were, as far as I can remember, no skill/perk dependent dialogues in Skyrim/fo3/obsidian, other than the speech checks, so I wouldn't hold my breath."

Lady killer / black widow is an example. Child at heart is another. I'm not aware of any full list, but there definitely are perk-dependant dialogue options.   And no, Elder Scrolls games have not had that feature. But just remember until recently Elder Scrolls games didn't have perks either so the lack of perk-dependant dialogue options isn't irregular."

And no, Elder Scrolls games have not had that feature. But just remember until recently Elder Scrolls games didn't have perks either so the lack of perk-dependant dialogue options isn't irregular.   TES games had skills, though, and they could have easily linked dialogues to those in suitable situations."

Games,3dmsty,dedoha,10,Fri Jul 17 20:24:38 2015 UTC,Skyrim actually had over seventy voice actors. The problem is that they used certain voices waaay too much.

Games,3dmsty,Thutman,3,Sat Jul 18 03:24:03 2015 UTC,So there's only one male and one female voice actor for the player character? Well that could be quite immersion breaking if you don't like the voice your character has or doesn't fit the character you're playing as.  At least Saints Row lets you pick from several different male and female voice actors and each has a different style of dialogue.

I think one of the reasons I enjoyed 3 over New Vegas is that your choices have more weight in NV even if they still lead you into one of a handful of endings.   I just hope that the karma system is either made more complicated or done away with because it felt too black and white in a world that tries to present itself as shades of grey."
Games,3dmsty,Smashguard,3,Fri Jul 17 18:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah but let's be honest, Bethesda has always been about quantity over quality so throwing numbers at me isn't very impressive.  Fallout 3 wasn't popular because of a tightly knit and intricately woven plot.  No, people like it because 95% of the game has nothing to do with that plot."
Games,3dmsty,Raziel66,6,Fri Jul 17 17:51:11 2015 UTC,And some of us would rather have a better plot. Considering that's the only thing they continue to do like shit since oblivion. I mean come on we know they can write. And we know they can make choices matter. Morrowind and prior exist. We don't need fallout skyrim edition. We want Fallout 4 the next generation open world Bethesda game. If we get Skyrim in the Wasteland with voice acting then what the fuck is the point.
Games,3dmsty,emmanuelvr,3,Fri Jul 17 22:03:16 2015 UTC,Glad to hear this. I will never support mute protagonists unless dictated by story. Give some character to your games and stop hiding behind 'player agency'.
Games,3dmsty,GeekAesthete,-3,Sat Jul 18 05:34:11 2015 UTC,"I don't remember reading anything about it yet, but your character is still silent in this game right?  Edit: Sorry for asking a question."
Games,3dmsty,emmanuelvr,14,Fri Jul 17 16:22:38 2015 UTC,"No, he was voiced in the gameplay video back in e3. I think it's only one voice (per gender) too.  Even worse news, it has a stupid dialogue wheel system."
Games,3dmsty,needconfirmation,16,Fri Jul 17 16:24:12 2015 UTC,"Even worse news, it has a stupid dialogue wheel system   Personally, I prefer the silent protagonist, but if they're going to have the protagonist speak, I think the dialogue wheel is one of the better options. Otherwise, you have to read the line, then hear that very same line spoken after you choose it, which would get repetitive really fast.  I'll wait to pass judgment. I was upset that Dragon Age 2 was going to add a voiced protagonist, but among the many things that disappointed in that game, the voicing was one of the things that I think was a better choice; now, the awkwardly quiet avatar in Dragon Age 1 always sticks out to me. Granted, the Bethesda games are a different animal, and use dialogue in a different manner, but I'll wait to see whether they make it work before I get ranty."
Games,3dmsty,GeekAesthete,9,Fri Jul 17 17:35:47 2015 UTC,"The implementation of the wheel in DA2 is quite possibly the worst of all the examples I can think of. At least Mass Effect had the excuse of having Paragon/Renegade as part of its gameplay system, however the way DA2 pigeonholed what was a game that previously managed to not be obnoxiously obvious on what each dialogue's intention was and offer a range of options that felt natural into Good / Neutral / Evil and Pacifist / Joker / Violent was a complete downgrade.  DAI at least improved that and stopped looking down on the player by having a stupid icon. Yes, I know that if I choose ""I want to be a dragon"", it's a joke bioware. Thanks for the dialogue being completely random from an arbitrary pool of responses based on an obscure system too.  I've played from DAO to DAI twice (four times DAO actually), and DAO absolutely has the best implementation of choice and dialogue in the franchise (Albeit DAI has some interesting things, despite the Dialogue Wheel)."
Games,3dmsty,emmanuelvr,5,Fri Jul 17 17:50:03 2015 UTC,"You know the shape that dialogue options are dispayed in has nothing to do with the quality of those options.  DAO had better options not because there were no circles on screen but because they were better options. They could have had a dialogue star, or a triangle, or even a fucking sphere that you'd have to rotate to find the option you want and it would have made no difference as to what those options were."
Games,3dmsty,mbm7501,0,Fri Jul 17 18:19:25 2015 UTC,"I wasn't talking about DA2's wheel, just the fact that I had been upset to hear they were changing something about the dialogue system -- adding a voice actor -- but ended up agreeing that the choice was the right one."
Games,3dmsty,emmanuelvr,4,Fri Jul 17 17:56:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, the problem with that is that the only good Hawke is female sarcastic Hawke. Male is subpar voice acting, and the rest can create some awful tone disparity if you fluctuate too much between options.  There's always this too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AkmLN5lY8mw"
Games,3dmsty,levelboy14,6,Fri Jul 17 17:58:13 2015 UTC,If the dialogue options were presented in a list format would it really be that much different? Witcher 3 gets a lot of praise but the dialogue options are very short in that game too.
Games,3dmsty,Roundy210,4,Fri Jul 17 16:59:37 2015 UTC,"Has it never happened to you that in Dragon Age or Mass Effect you wanted to say something like ""Dude shut up"", and your character goes ""If you don't shut up I will fucking gut you"" (hyperbolic but quite possibly accurate example)?  The thing with Geralt is that he has a set characterization and it works more like a CYOA than a roleplaying game. You don't really get a choice on his personality, just the choices he'd make within his personality, and subsequently, his dialogue always has a tone similar because his character is predefinided. It's pretty much impossible to compare it to a white canvas character where you build up the personality yourself, as such the range of tones and choices gotta be clear and ample enough, which the dialogue wheel simplifies and obfuscates."
Games,3dmsty,anononobody,2,Fri Jul 17 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Witcher 3 is a different case when it comes dialogue choice since Geralt is already a character with a set personality. One example I had when I was playing during the Bloody Baron quest line and the Baron told me to find is daughter once I knew her location. The two choices I had were basically ""Yeah I'll go check on your daughter"" or ""No I can't do that"". I was gonna choice ""Yes"" but hit ""no"" on accident. The scene that unfolded was still amazing and Geralt response was just amazing I didn't care I picked the wrong one."

This demo however runs at 3024x1680 with 90 FPS, that's about 457 million pixels per second. Ten times as much! While it is a good looking VR demo it doesn't really show what Source 2 is capable of in a regular 2D game, where they have to render a lot less pixels."

Yes, it costs about $2000, I can afford it (with min wage job and proper savings), I understand other people can't spend that kind of money but I can and I don't mind ... that doesn't mean that the graphics of The Order are the best in gaming ... again, I can probably suggest a build of about $600 and still get better graphics than that game .. it's not a slight against consoles or the game devs (they've done a very good job squeezing everything from the ps4 which is a feat onto itself) it's just objective reality  Yes, the order is probably the best looking game made for a console, but it's not the best looking game of all time, that's a little naive ..

Games,3dof42,plank_,2,Sat Jul 18 16:20:56 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are that ""VR games"" might take a while to have the right design behind them, even Valve aren't sure what a VR game might be yet. A 'good VR game' certainly won't be a quick and easy port of an existing 2D display popular game type.  What I think is the potential with games is that 'VR experiences' logically have a lot of synergy with visual technology that gets used in games, so there's a logical cross over in developers. It wouldn't surprise me to see names you might associate with games being seen in the 'new media', also why companies like MS/Sony are interested as they can easily be the ""VR player"" for the home if/when it takes off."
Games,3dof42,CutterJohn,-1,Sat Jul 18 16:24:40 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Looks like a normal demo that would be perfectly playable on a normal setup, with alterations to the controls, of course. But then the controls didn't even do anything special."

VR is not all that it's cracked up to be, its not even close. We still have a good 3 or 4 years before VR is worth buying for actual use and not just for tinkering around with demos. Hell, imo after using the Oculus for a long while, head mounted displays in general will never replace a monitor or provide a better experience overall.

Games,3dof42,Unavillafied,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:27:19 2015 UTC,"The flaws that come with any type of HMD will translate to all regardless of their specs. The final release Oculus will have the same shortfalls I have experienced with the devkit, because there is no way to fix them due the nature of physically strapping a screen on your face.   I can confidently disregard refresh rate and resolution in my judgement completely and it will still be a pass due to the numerous and un fixable other annoyances."
Games,3dof42,Heaney555,-1,Sat Jul 18 11:06:55 2015 UTC,"And what are those specifically, that you consider unfixable?"
Games,3dof42,Unavillafied,2,Sat Jul 18 10:15:16 2015 UTC,"Lets start with the most simple, obvious and unavoidable. Being blind to the world. Its the entire point of using a HMD, but in practice is so incredibly clumsy that it becomes one of the major downfalls and annoyances of actually using a HMD for more than 20 minutes at a time. This in and of itself will cause a large portion of people who buy VR to throw it into the closet and forget about it, I am sure. Its made me do it several times over already.    *Simple actions like grabbing a drink or anything on your desk becomes an ordeal, bathroom breaks, calls, smoking etc. It doesn't seem like such a big deal and it didn't to me before I bought and used a HMD, but it most certainly is. In addition to that, taking the HMD on / off will cause its own problems. Some of these may be alleviated to one degree or another but doubt it will be completely. Things like condensation / fog on the lenses, which will lead to you wiping them, which will lead to particles on the lenses (even with a lint free rag), which will lead to a 5 minute process of meticulously cleaning your lenses before putting the HMD back on else you deal with magnified dots and smudges obscuring your vision...  *Webcam attachment may be a hotfix for interacting with RL to a very limited degree, but I can see it exponentially increasing the already terrible motion sickness most people get from using VR for extended periods of time. That is without taking into account added cost and issues related to viewing from a cam / actually swapping between the webcam and in game video. (Alt tabbing out of game with a HMD on is like getting punched in the gut after drinking someone elses vomit.) *   Cables are not going anywhere anytime soon for gaming VR (unless you are using a HMD with a phone but that has its own list of problems and drawbacks). Even in this video you can see the guy if left unattended would eventually wrap himself in cable and or pull down his PC. Wireless Oculus streamed from PC may be in the next 3+ years if it makes it that far but don't expect it anytime soon and expect a new host of problems from that implementation to be added. Til then you are tethered to your desk, which limits your head tracking to essentially front right and front left. This cuts one of the main reasons for using a HMD in half. But it gets even worse than that. Using the head tracking to even half its ability gets tiresome and makes motion sickness worse. After being inside the rift for longer than 15 - 20 min, you pretty much stop swiveling your head entirely, instead resorting to very minor (if even) movements, resorting to using the controls to move the camera just out of necessity. That has been my experience and what I have observed in most people who have used mine for extended periods of time. This is the main selling point of HMD's... Dark room with big monitor wins by leaps and bounds imo.  Heat / straps / sweat / condensation / comfort etc. Either way you slice it, head mounted display is a head mounted display. Its a screen, enclosed in plastic, that is front heavy, that rests on your head for extended periods of time. Specs won't change that. They might alleviate some of the discomfort but will never make it as comfortable as nothing. For people who game lightly, this might not be a big deal, for people who game hours every day, it is.  The disconnect between the avatar and your body is a serious problem that cannot and will not be addressed by any feasible means. Barring thought controlled devices, which needless to say, is not coming anytime soon. The solutions we have and will have in the foreseeable future are grossly inadequate. Connect level motion controls is what we will get. I don't really need to explain that. This disconnect is also the cause of much of the motion sickness I experience, not screen resolution or refresh rate. Running in game, while seated irl and feeling no inertia is sickening.   Treadmills add yet another layer of complexity and annoyance to the mix. In addition to plastic strapped to your head, you are now strapped in by your waist to a treadmill, but also you have controllers too (is all that really feasible? Not imo). Good luck taking a piss after rigging yourself and all your peripherals to that abomination of science. lol    For games where you are always seated, like flying / driving sims. I can see a HMD being usable. This due to the fact that they have their own custom peripherals that may match the in game controls. But even that is being extremely generous.   There is so much more that I either don't feel like typing or can't remember. Essentially HMD's are more trouble than their experience is worth and most of those troubles aren't from specs. I prefer my surround setup + TrackIR even for sims, which is where I think HMD's will be most useful, so even at their most useful, I still think they will be inadequate for some time to come."

Passthrough camera already exists on Gear VR, and this can be done so that it's a simple button press on the side of the HMD.   Webcam attachment may be a hotfix for interacting with RL to a very limited degree, but I can see it exponentially increasing the already terrible motion sickness most people get from using VR for extended periods of time.   No it won't, because you compensate for the latency of the webcam by having it spatially delayed.  Here's how Gear VR does it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZbZ_3QqO8k&t=22s  And Gear VR is a primitive HMD using a single smartphone camera.  In a real HMD, you'd use 2.  Here's a prototype of this + AR interfaces: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxM4vN_4jJY  So no, passthrough camera does solve it.   without taking into account added cost   Smartphone cameras cost ~$20.   actually swapping between the webcam and in game video.

(Alt tabbing out of game with a HMD on is like getting punched in the gut after drinking someone elses vomit)   Extended display mode, a mode used on the developer kit you bought, is not being used in the consumer rift.  Direct to Rift mode only, wherein alt-tabbing will keep the game you were playing on the HMD in focus but just pause it until you tab back in (but you'll still have head tracking).   being inside the rift for longer than 15 - 20 min, you pretty much stop swiveling your head entirely, instead resorting to very minor (if even) movements, resorting to using the controls to move the camera just out of necessity.

The feasible means is body tracking. Not exactly science fiction, it's just about 5 or 10 years of advances in computer vision.  For input now, we have Oculus Touch on the horizon, which has had reviews like this:  ""He started to explain the controls. Why, I have no idea—because I was already reaching out and grabbing things with my hands. My hands. Not a magic wand or a tractor beam or a portal gun. When I closed my real-world hand to grip things, I gripped them in VR. I didn’t need to use an iota of conscious thought, no “hey I wonder which button I should press?” to do it. It was freaking awesome.""   There is so much more that I either don't feel like typing or can't remember. Essentially HMD's are more trouble than their experience is worth and most of those troubles aren't from specs.   Essentially, you bought a developer kit with terrible ergonomics and user experience, because it's a fucking developer kit, and now you think that this applies to all HMDs.  Newsflash: the consumer Rift will have a proximity sensor so that the instant you put it on your head, you get a VR interface. It has completely redesigned ergonomics (watch what I linked above), and reviews of it from E3 have been excellent."

That looks exactly how I imagined it to be, and exactly as disorienting, like I said a hot fix with its own drawbacks (one that will likely not even be implemented in many HMD's no less). When I say ""alt-tab"", I didn't mean just the physical act of alt tabbing, I meant the changes on screen inside of the HMD in-game-> out of game ->real life. That is nauseating and disorienting.   This is BS. I play Elite and ETS2 on the DK2 every day, and this does not apply at all.   No its not, your examples are the simply the exceptions. As I specifically stated, flying and driving sims are the only games that I see any reason for using an HMD, tracking ships / viewing side view mirrors are reasons to swivel your head. I still prefer TrackIR and surround setup over HMD's. At least I could see my keyboard and my peripherals. In the vast majority of non sim games swiveling your head any more than slightly is not only completely unnecessary but simply causes fatigue.   Actually, yes they will: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ixQ7aY93BjU&t=9m45s   It might be more comfortable than the last iteration. But that's not saying much at all. Its still a bulky plastic device attached to your head.   The feasible means is body tracking. Not exactly science fiction, it's just about 5 or 10 years of advances in computer vision.    Body tracking isn't going to solve the problems with interacting in the virtual world. To be more specific, you will still be blind to the RW, but now you are standing. Walking, running and jumping in place. Flailing your arms about. Turning in all directions (assuming cables are not a problem) etc. This does not seem feasible to me. Perhaps in a warehouse. Not in any room in my house, and I have a big house.   For input now, we have Oculus Touch on the horizon, which has had reviews like this:   The Razer Hydra had similar cherry picked reviews as well after its release. The Hydra is pretty mediocre all things considered and I really don't have any reason to believe the Touch will be leaps and bounds better. They are essentially the same things, touch being a bit more advanced.  ""Playing Portal 2 with the Hydra should be the ONLY WAY people play the game. The portal gun controls are smooth and navigating the various levels eventually becomes second nature thanks to the 1:1 precision."" -Gaming Shogun   That's a load of bullshit of course. Much like most of the coverage of nearly every E3 I have ever seen.   Essentially, you bought a developer kit with terrible ergonomics and user experience, because it's a fucking developer kit, and now you think that this applies to all HMDs.   No. What you are doing is simply white knighting a plastic device against ""the bad person who is critical of it."" VR has this cult following of fanatically dedicated people who refuse and actively try to deny anything beyond ""VR is the greatest thing ever to be made and is amazing with not even the slightest of drawbacks!"" Its the same tune Ive heard since DK1, its bullshit."

Games,3dns6t,Tayzay,40,Fri Jul 17 23:52:45 2015 UTC,"My hope would be that it is a perk, that you still get normal crits based on luck, even in VATS. But then to get a Perk that gives you a manual use critical hit when you want/need it."
Games,3dns6t,TheBeardomancer,12,Sat Jul 18 01:01:05 2015 UTC,That sounds good. I do hope that it really is some perk rather than replace the critical mechanic with something that requires just a push of a button.

Games,3dns6t,Gary_Burke,24,Sat Jul 18 03:18:13 2015 UTC,They were never officially uploaded before now.
Games,3dns6t,bill2401,3,Sat Jul 18 06:34:58 2015 UTC,"Well, the Bethesda E3 conference where these came from was. Videos like this are just clips from the show."
Games,3dns6t,WhiteZero,7,Sat Jul 18 07:11:48 2015 UTC,Yeah but these are better quality and lack the audience noise from the panel.
Games,3dns6t,bill2401,20,Sat Jul 18 19:29:25 2015 UTC,The gunplay looks amazing compared to 3 and New Vegas.  It looks like they actually made a proper shooter with an RPG setting.  Can't wait.
Games,3dns6t,NateTheGreat14,34,Sat Jul 18 19:33:34 2015 UTC,"If I recall correctly, they actually enlisted the help of a few guys from Bungie to get the shooting mechanics right.  And if there's one thing that Bungie actually got right with Destiny, it was the gunplay."
Games,3dns6t,A_Hard_Goodbye,6,Sat Jul 18 04:59:06 2015 UTC,"Never heard that before, might sharing a source?  I'd love to read more about their collaboration."
Games,3dns6t,georgito555,6,Sat Jul 18 09:45:05 2015 UTC,Sure.   Combat is receiving a major stimpak thanks to some consulting with id Software to improve the second-to-second shooting. Bethesda's goal? To have the shooting stand shoulder to shoulder with the other great options on the market. The studio even hired away some Bungie talent to help with this remodel.   http://www.gameinformer.com/games/fallout_4/b/playstation4/archive/2015/06/17/19-new-details-fans-need-to-know-about-fallout-4.aspx
Games,3dns6t,A_Hard_Goodbye,-24,Sat Jul 18 17:51:23 2015 UTC,"The gunplay looks extremely consoleized to me. Maybe it's just because they were clearly playing it on a Xbone, but it was pretty obvious how the player would aim, fire, and not even move a little between shots, even while giant hulking melee bullet sponge charges at them. The kind of way you'd do things if you were handicapped by thumbsticks."
Games,3dns6t,BasqueInGlory,21,Sun Jul 19 00:30:33 2015 UTC,"While I agree, I was mostly talking about how the guns seem more like guns than like water guns or airsoft guns.  They actually kickback, have impact, and cause a reaction in enemies when they are hit by bullets or lasers."
Games,3dns6t,NateTheGreat14,2,Sat Jul 18 07:23:31 2015 UTC,"Unsurprisingly developers tend to lead development on the control method that most people use. Bethesda games sell more on consoles and many PC users prefer to play with a controller, KB+M is a minority choice so receives less precedence. It's the same reason that TW3 was clearly designed for a controller. The mod support for the game will cover the bases for that kind of thing, Bethesda's job is to make the best game for the most people and that means console priority."
Games,3dns6t,codeswinwars,-2,Sat Jul 18 07:39:07 2015 UTC,"i use controller whenever possible.  i concede the point that the mouse is better than the controller, but the controller is far, far superior to a keyboard."

Things like that give PC a lot of options. But yeah, for 99% of games, or the ones that are popular, anyway, the buttons on a controller are more efficient."
Games,3dns6t,The_Ambrosian,0,Sat Jul 18 13:23:57 2015 UTC,"I'll second the other poster. Controllers are best for third-person games like Dark Souls, Witcher, Batman. Even in DS2 when the game was optimized to use the KB + M the game is nearly unplayable without a controller. On the other hand, FPS or RTS games practically require KB + M. Can you imagine playing Command and Conquer with a controller? I tried it on an N64 back in the day, and it was a nightmare.   Personal anecdote: For years, my only experience with CoD was restricted to the random dude night where everyone wanted to hook up their consoles and play Black Ops all night. I never did well at those and I just walked away assuming that I just wasn't very good at CoD. I played a free weekend of Ghosts, however, and did SO MUCH BETTER because of using a KB + M."
Games,3dns6t,momuse888,-3,Sat Jul 18 13:36:42 2015 UTC,The mod support for the game will cover the bases for that kind of thing   Customers should not have to rely on third party mods to unfuck a poor design decision to cater to an inferior control scheme.
Games,3dns6t,Kaarous,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:14:30 2015 UTC,"I am definitely not a fan of the interface geared towards consoles, but I don't necessarily fault them for optimizing the game for the platform where they will maximize their profits.

Games,3dns6t,momuse888,8,Sun Jul 19 09:10:52 2015 UTC,Anybody else worried that they have dumbed down the RPG elements?  I don't see any skills in that menu. I do see the stats....  Having a character that couldn't shoot but had a speech skill of 100 is one of the things that makes fallout... well fallout.
Games,3dns6t,Kardest,5,Mon Jul 20 19:22:30 2015 UTC,"Yeah, so far it really doesn't seem like they're prioritizing non-linear storytelling or RPG elements. The only stuff they've shown of either of those things are mostly downgrades rather than improvements.   And I'm sure someone will say ""We've only seen a couple dialogue bits, it will be better than it looks!"" Well first of all, there's no changing the dialogue UI. We're stuck to the ""choose a button that vaguely corresponds to a response"" system. That's a bad thing that won't be changed. Second, they'd have pull something off brilliantly to not fall into the trap of simplified dialogue with the new system. And finally, the fact that Bethesda hasn't shown or said anything about this shows a lack of priority for it, and that worries me."

Games,3dns6t,drury,4,Sat Jul 18 23:57:42 2015 UTC,Graphics and shooting sure but I think the dialogue system looks terrible
Games,3dns6t,BogusSoup,0,Sun Jul 19 10:47:34 2015 UTC,"Graphics could be better though. I've never really played any of the games that do use that dialogue system but it does seem exciting. It's more cinematic, which is what F1/F2 thrived towards with their dialogues, but F3/NV didn't see any extreme progress in that department... I'd say it was actually a bit of a downgrade.  What exactly is the problem there?"
Games,3dns6t,drury,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:27:21 2015 UTC,"F1 and F2 were cinematic in their dialogue?  What?  When you spoke to someone the whole screen changed so you could read through the long ass and many choiced dialogue options.  Not short lines that roughly correspond to the feeling or content of what's going to be said, similar to so many games these days.  This is mass effect/dragon age inquisition dialogue, not Fallout dialogue."
Games,3dns6t,i_am_shitlord,0,Sun Jul 19 16:41:49 2015 UTC,"The whole screen changed so you could see the character's face in high quality graphics, that's pretty damn cinematic for that time. There were also pre-rendered cinematic cutscenes in the games. Cinematic experience was a high priority.  I don't think it's a bad idea to progress in that direction now just because F3/NV didn't."
Games,3dns6t,drury,1 point,Mon Jul 20 04:58:25 2015 UTC,But now we're losing out on the detailed and more complex dialogue
Games,3dns6t,BogusSoup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:14:11 2015 UTC,How so?
Games,3dns6t,drury,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:15:06 2015 UTC,"The voices dialogue interface with reactions/summaries instead of what you're specifically going to see is a huge detriment to good interaction where you're supposed to be able to be very particular with what your character does. It's one thing in mass effect or the witcher where you have somewhat pre-made characters and a partially linear story, but for a game like Fallout you should have more direct control. Then again maybe it'll just be like Fallout 3 and only have two outcomes for everything anyway..."
Games,3dns6t,BogusSoup,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:22:32 2015 UTC,"Well first of all, there's no changing the dialogue UI.   I disagree. Look at what modders were able to achieve with the Skyrim UI and the insane MCM. As long as we can create new UI elements and nullify others, then you can definitely create a mod for classic Fallout dialogue options.    Second, they'd have pull something off brilliantly to not fall into the trap of simplified dialogue with the new system   Yeah, I agree with you there. I was playing the Witcher 3 over the weekend and selected a dialogue option that sounded like a simple ""No"" to in my head; Geralt basically responded with, ""Fuck you! Die"" Whoa, talk about understated dialogue options.   the fact that Bethesda hasn't shown or said anything about this shows a lack of priority for it, and that worries me.   They haven't really shown much of anything at all so I wouldn't be too worried. Unlike other companies, Bethesda doesn't show every mole and hair on their asscrack before they release a game (cough* Ubisoft)."
Games,3dns6t,momuse888,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:43:32 2015 UTC,Changing the UI for dialogue all depends on whether we can easily transfer the subtitles of the a player's dialogue to the UI. I hope someone can do it

You see them flying in some of the other footage and though it's not entirely canon, Fallout Tactics has the Midwestern Brotherhood of Steel using them extensively. Given some people have speculated that it's the MW BoS in this game and not Lyons' Eastern BoS, it would make a lot of sense that they'd have airships and would also explain why vertibirds - particularly BoS vertibirds - seem to be so prominent since you'd have to have a method to get to the airships."

Games,3dns6t,MadlibVillainy,-5,Sat Jul 18 15:31:14 2015 UTC,"No, they're not. They were produced in finite numbers by The Master on the West Coast then Fallout 3 did some asspull in order to rehash them on the East Coast because Bethesda's a bunch of uncreative cads with no attention to the lore (exactly the same goes for the Enclave)."
Games,3dns6t,AlJoelson,5,Sat Jul 18 18:13:29 2015 UTC,"Well 40 years pass between fallout 2 and 3. That and it's never really specific over how many mutants were made and how much FEV was available. Plus there is at least one vault where more mutants were made with additional stores of FEV, who's to say their aren't anymore. All the mutants need are tanks of FEV and living humans to make more of themselves. Vault-tec obviously had a hard on for the things."

Games,3dns6t,thoomfish,-32,Fri Jul 17 23:57:14 2015 UTC,The bit around 0:41 confirms that I'm still not going to like it. Pumping a bunch of shots into a standard humanoid enemy's head and watching them just shrug it off and keep shooting at you is a feel-bad moment.
Games,3dns6t,thoomfish,59,Fri Jul 17 23:58:08 2015 UTC,"Well I mean... that was a robot, man.  Besides Fallout is an RPG first and foremost. Level-up weapon related perks and stats and use the best weapons (use stealth for extra damage) and I guarantee a lot of enemies will go down in one hit to the head."

This is the other thing that bugs me about RPG/FPS hybrids. You can somewhat ameliorate the bad combat by pumping stats into guns and making it mercifully brief, but that reduces your capacity to take advantage of all the cool non-combat options (lockpicking, science, speech, etc.). But on the flip side, taking non-combat skills generally doesn't excuse you from having to deal with the combat unless you want to skip 90% of the game.  That's not the sort of choice that I find fun, personally."

Edit: On reflection (and after /u/Mrdooperbob made a very good point), I think ""RPG"" and ""FPS"" might be imprecise terms for what I mean. Let me rephrase: vertical progression and action/twitch mechanics are what are basically incompatible. Because if all your skill at playing the game is offset by the choices you make while leveling up, why even bother including the element of skill?"

Games,3dmia1,Sca4ar,29,Fri Jul 17 14:25:51 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't recommend it. Even if you're using ActionScript 3, it's still difficult and you'll have loads of issues. We just released Divide By Sheep on Steam and it's Flash AS3 -- it runs great and all that, but it's mostly a mobile game. For a mobile/steam game Flash can work fine. For a console/steam game -- I'd think twice about using flash."
Games,3dmia1,NotSafeForShop,4,Fri Jul 17 14:30:01 2015 UTC,"One thing I've observed is that if there's a free version of it online, no matter how much more work and effort you put into the Steam version, people will complain about having to pay for it(unless it's still free). I've seen a lot of great games like Haunt the House: Terrortown get derided because a simpler, free version already existed. Then again, I think you can find someone complaining about pretty much anything on the Steam forums."

You can always get super enthusiastic with all these ideas, how great it can look/feel/play/whatever -- only to realize this will take 5 years to make with the resources you have.   The most difficult part is finding what you can do right now, that'd have immediate positive impact, and keep on finding those things. That's how you can quickly iterate and shift around."

We are working on an API for Unity games that makes it incredibly easy to pass certification on PS4/XBO, and has all Steam features integrated. That's what we're doing alongside porting Lovely Planet (also a Unity game) from Steam to Xbox One and PS4.   The idea is so that our devs (and our studio) can just drag and drop this component in, you'd hook up achievements/controller support/cloud saves/all that once -- and it'd export to all the different platforms. There's also a set of requirements for consoles (codenamed certification abyss) that we want to make easier.   So ""EVENTUALLY"" is your answer :)"

Games,3dmia1,tgunter,16,Fri Jul 17 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"Oh great, I love talking about Lovely Planet!  First off, I didn't create it -- nor did anyone at tinyBuild. Lovely Planet is the brainchild of Vidhvat -- https://twitter.com/_vidhvat  We found the game I think at a showcase or something, and when I saw the gameplay video I knew we had to partner up. This was the first game we ""completed"" with a developer. We helped on all fronts - spent an extra 4 months on polishing the game up, building the marketing around it, and pushing it to the media on release. I don't even mention the incredible IndieBox that was done for it.   So on behalf of Vidhvat, on the inspiration behind LP  He was really into anime when designing it. Wanted to make a ""pure"" FPS, something that drills down to the essence of a shooter, and make it really hardcore. So you'd fail, and instantly respawn to try again. Fail, repeat.   What's more insane is when we were like ""LETS PORT IT TO CONSOLESSS WOOOO"", and Vidhvat was like ""this will neeeever work"".   We eventually got controller support in with a ""toggle"" to lock onto nearby enemies, and we beat the game with it. I'm really curious how many console gamers will beat the game. There are levels where you need to do a 180, aim-shoot, 180, aim-shoot, jump, land, hit a moving target, and avoid bullets from 2 enemies. Good luck guys, good luck!"

If life happened differently and you never got into game development, what might you be doing for a living instead?    Thanks!"

We've had several situations where things weren't going right. Mostly logistical - you know, when you're doing an event, have no clue what/where/how - and if we were to not make proper decisions on the spot, our whole show could collapse. In general terms, when you feel like the whole world is about to collapse in on you -- your blood is rushing, adrenaline spiking, hands shaking -- the best thing to do is take a deep breath, and step back from the situation. Odds are you're in tunnel vision and don't see all the possible options. It also helps to talk with your trusted partners about it, and figure out what to do.    We've had a few emergency 3am meetings like this, and it always helps to relax, take a breath, and look over all possible options.

Games,3dmia1,1magus,8,Fri Jul 17 15:37:35 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is down to whichever platform is most responsive to a game -- for example, Xbox has been super helpful with No Time To Explain, hence the game coming to Xbox first. Elsewhere Nintendo has been really excited to help us bring Lovely Planet to their platforms, so that is coming along more swiftly. If we get the sense that a platform holder is more excited about our games, then we're more likely to work with them first, because we feed off that energy.  RE: The Wii U, I actually gave a sales figure talk earlier this year, which you can watch for free here: http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022321/The-Turning-Tide-Independent-Game  I discuss the Wii U, and sales on the Wii U, in great detail, so it's worth checking out"

Something that'd be similar to how Galcon was just base-on-base warfare, but with more flexibility and control of the units, and multiplayer focus.   The name BOID is actually from an algorithm of bird simulation, how they flock together. A similar algorithm is used in the behavior in BOID and that's where the name came from as well."

There's frankly next to no reason to preorder something these days but with the addition of better consumer practices in the form of refunds (something that we really didn't have in the past as a promise other than from very few vendors) I could see more people preordering to get fun little items due to their being less risk with buying a faulty or broken product."

For example, in Canada Fallout 4 is $79.99 plus tax (so around $91 in my province) for all three platforms in retail stores, but on steam it's $69.99 including taxes. One might be worried that Steam will raise its price once they realize that's what the market is now here (almost all new preorderables for this year on Steam are $79.99). If I preorder the game then I won't have to pay the extra money. Alternatively if it goes down in price I get some money back.   Seeing as I'm going to buy F4 100%, and if anything is drastically wrong with it I can refund it anyway, there's compelling reason to preorder it. In fact I'm probably going to do so with my next pay check!"

Games,3dupie,SylverV,1 point,Mon Jul 20 05:47:09 2015 UTC,The main point that people bring up when preorders are brought up is the message it sends to the publisher of said game.
Games,3dupie,MizerokRominus,6,Mon Jul 20 16:31:38 2015 UTC,"However, the fact that a pre-order ""guarantees"" you a copy of a game at launch is a very strong pull for certain consumers, who may not want to wait for the game longer than needed.  This comes from years ago, and I haven't seen it apply recently at ALL. I'm in my mid 30's. I've been a lifelong fan of KOEI's Historical Simulation Series. When I was young, if I didn't go to Gamestop and Pre-order the newest Romance of the Three Kingdoms game, I couldn't buy one. Gamestop would only get pre-ordered copies of the game, or, once in a great while, they'd get 3-4 copies to sell without pre-order. Now, I can't think of any games you'd run into this problem with...especially with digital downloads. Couple that with the fact that any decent sized release is almost always available at a 24 hour a day Walmart at midnight on release day, and there's no point in pre-ordering...unless you want the day 1 DLC that gets thrown into almost every single game nowadays, even the ones so buggy it boggles the mind to think that it had day 1 DLC."
Games,3dupie,TemujinRi,-1,Sun Jul 19 18:11:20 2015 UTC,"Should be noted that some Gamestops would sell ""your"" copy of the game to other people after something like 24 hours of holding it which is - frankly - not a lot of time."

Of course, because of how short sighted and selfish most people are, this is completely unrealistic   But answering your questions:   I think they will only increase. Propaganda is a very strong tool and it will only get better with technology.  Of course it does. Regardless of how many 10$ you save, you also tell companies actually making good games is not very important, the important thing is making them look good. No, I doubt it will change consumer behavior. Most people don't care about actually important things like politics or economy, let alone games.

Games,3dupie,teerre,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:47:01 2015 UTC,"I preorder literally every single game that I am willing to pay full price for. Only once was there a time that I was disappointed by it and I knew full well going into it that I would be. It was Duke Nukem Forever.   I'd waited for that title since I first saw the original screenshots back in 1998. Year after year I waited and wanted. I knew half a decade before it launched that it couldn't possibly live up to expectations. I knew that DN3D was likely to remain the pinnacle of the series. When Gearbox acquired the franchise from the remnants of 3DRealms, I knew it was the last nails being hammered into the coffin. I preordered anyway, because I simply could not go through all of that waiting without playing it and finally closing that chapter. So I did just that.  It remains the only disappointment I've had from preordering and I knew full well it would be. Games aren't a mystically unknowable product before purchase. There are ample signs whether or not a game will be good prior to launch. Just how they conduct their marketing is a sure sign.  There are also specific developers that never truly disappoint. For all those developers I trust and I truly want their game, I preorder. For everyone else, it's steam sales at best. I will only buy a game full price after launch if I am buying it as a gift for a friend who didn't know about it or didn't have the cash on hand, such as I did twice for GTA V right after launch when it turned out a couple friends didn't have the funds.  All that said, I can honestly never see preorders going away. They remain useful to gamers. Some gamers on tighter budgets would rather drop the cash when they have it rather than hold onto it for launch because other tempting things between now and then might get in the way and they miss out initially. It's just easier if the cash is gone from the bank account and you know what is left. I'm not one of those people as I don't have any shortage of cash."

Games,3dpgng,srslybr0,14,Sat Jul 18 08:05:34 2015 UTC,"The reason they changed appearance of Lara was to make her look more like the voice actress (Camilla Luddington) that is playing her. From what I've read it makes facial capture easier.   Edit: This is how they did the facial capture for Rise: http://i.imgur.com/cL7iGBP.jpg   normal motion capture uses dots placed on the actor's face for points of reference (about 90 points, according to Luddington), Mova, a performance facial capture company for feature film and games, uses a fluorescent paint that is sprayed all over, resulting in more than 7000 points of reference."
Games,3dpgng,wazups2x,-19,Sat Jul 18 19:44:26 2015 UTC,"Agreed. She even somehow looks younger in this game. I also really liked her older look as she seemed to have a sort of diversity in her ethnicity, not just standard white Ellen page look alike."

And while England is more diverse than let's say Poland (87.1% White compared to a 93.8% ethnical population), her being from an old British aristocratic family would mean that she's a standart white Ellen Page look alike.

Games,3dpgng,Orfez,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:20:44 2015 UTC,"This series is kind of completely detached from the old games. In the original Tomb Raider (Or Anniversary), Lara didn't fight/kill any humans until the very very end of the game, at which point she was reluctant to do it, and there was even a cutscene afterwards where she hallucinates her hands covered in blood and tries to clean them off. Even a boss fight against 2 douchebags after that one she still doesn't want to kill (and they kill each other anyway), and then the final cutscene of the game she voices her regret about how she feels different etc.  In new TR Lara is the inverse of the T-800 from Terminator 2. I don't think it'd be possible for her to be upset over killing one person after she's mowed down what amounts to literally an entire island nation. Plus who knows how many more people she's going to blast away in the sequel?  Having said all that...I miss Keeley Hawes."
Games,3dpgng,bigblackcouch,9,Mon Jul 20 13:38:09 2015 UTC,"What I think will be interesting as development goes on on these aspects of game characters is how the game uses those characters.   TR2013 was more grounded than previous games, but it still had you doing exceptional feats all the time, and that's the core TR gameplay. Lara Croft is to a certain extent an action hero, the duracell bunny who just keeps going after scaling a huge cliff, traversing around a tomb, after a combat section, etc.  It'd be interesting to see if they could work in the limits of exertion into the gameplay rather than just being in the cutscenes, as though there's a divide between gameplay where she's a game character and cutscenes where she's human.  There's a certain amount of player investment or suspension of disbelief into the game reality that's required."

Injury, starvation, exposure would certainly add a new awesome layer of realism to the game, however CD would have to carefully adjust that mechanic so that is does not interfere with the plot, and those conditions would have to affect cut scenes. These mechanics work best with open world games, I guess."
Games,3dmkls,Lazanje,251,Fri Jul 17 14:17:18 2015 UTC,"Randy Pitchford consistently misses (and downplays) the point of the entire issue in the article. It isn't about making a subpar game, it's about fundamentally misrepresenting what said game looks like. If there are differences between what was once shown and advertised as ""this is how the gameplay will look"" and the final retail version of the game, you are supposed to show how the game looks that people will buy, not the vertical slice you've made years before!  As far as him ""losing"" money goes: The story I've heard before goes like this - SEGA pumps way too much money into the development of the game and Gearbox just colossally mismanages their funding and Pitchford has to use his own money to actually fund what they had already been paid to do."

Games,3dmkls,gregg-nyu,21,Fri Jul 17 23:16:51 2015 UTC,"The missing blood and flashing light examples he gives, I have no recollection of them.   Here's the video I think he's talking about.    They start by showing the difference in the umbilical scene.  They don't even mention the blood inside the umbilical.  They talk about the lighting and how the grass cracks when the body hits it.    Pitchford explains why they might have gotten rid of the glass cracking:   ""There was one that went around calling out these ‘massive changes’ and it’s like, okay. Here’s a video of a player going down the umbilical cord from a demo we did in 2012 and you look up and a soldier smashes through the glass then he falls and gets up and keeps going. ...  ""In the final game, there’s no blood on the ground and no glass shattering… and that’s a scandal. Like, the tiniest thing! ...  ""In the case of the shattering, it didn’t make sense,"" Pitchford explained. ""Later, you see the umbilical buckle and all the glass was fine, so it was a logical problem. ...""   Look, if it had been only the glass shattering, that might have been a ""tiny thing.""  But the lighting was completely different.  There was dynamic lighting in the demo, which wasn't present in the final game.  There was shadowing in the demo -- both along the corridor and along the ship in the background -- that wasn't present in the final game.  The demo was in higher resolution than the final game.  And in my completely subjective opinion, the demo looked way, way better.    He also addresses the lights hanging down in the 2nd room, which starts at about 1:09 of the video I linked above:   ""The next one was in the very next shot in a room where originally there was one of those long halogen tube lights that was swinging and it looked pretty cool, but in the final game the level designer decided a klaxon would be better so changed it and suddenly that’s a scandal! It went from a swinging light to a spinning light and all those things could have been either way and it wouldn’t have affected the results. ...""   Again, that wasn't the real issue.  It was larger than just changing the swinging light to a klaxon/siren light.    Take a look at the left side of the screen when the character enters.  In the demo, there are flames shooting out, and in a separate area, there are sparks shooting out.  Those both create their own lighting and shadows.  You've got steam shooting out of a pipe to the left.  None of those effects were in the final version.  So, again, it's a much larger issue than what Pitchford suggests.  The demo had dynamic lighting and more effects.  It also had higher resolution.  In my opinion, it just looked much, much better.    Don't get me wrong.  I don't think graphics are the most important thing in a videogame.  I'm old, and some of the most fun times I've had playing videogames were some of the oldest, worst looking games you can imagine.  Hell, I played Combat on the Atari, so I don't need good graphics to enjoy a game.    And I loved Borderlands, and I thought highly of Pitchford.  So I really wanted to like this game.  But in the end, I decided not to buy it for 2 reasons: 1) The reviews were brutal.  It apparently just wasn't a fun game to play; and 2) I didn't want to support a game that was marketed like this one was."

He acts like it's just a matter of changing a light here or there, when the entire lighting of every scene was far less complex (and pretty poor), the AI had significant issues and didn't do what was in the demo, entire sections of the demo were not in play (setting up turrets, etc), atmospheric effects and fog where not in the final game... you can go on and on. It's pretty clear that they had performance issues that they needed to work past, although it's unclear why they had to make their game look so much worse in order to work at all. Additionally, the issue is that the Sulaco and Hadley's Hope were the best parts of the game, and that as you go through the game, the fidelity and general quality gets worse and worse. Finally you get to the end section, which is both a joke and commonly script breaks.  This is before you even go over the fact that the story of the game is bad and handwaves things in order to even justify characters being in place.  Thank god for Alien Isolation to get the bad taste of this garbage out of our collective mouths."

Since they choose what their people are working on, well it was their call... and they called for borderlands, and aliens was left alone, up to when they got very late and just released something that wasn't polished at all and half assed.

Nope, they wrapped it up, shipped it out, and expected people to buy it when the correct response was to actually make a game people would want to buy and play. Pitchford and Gearbox deserve 100% of the blame of the DN:F debacle because they had ample opportunity to ensure that it wouldn't end up as one."

I think he's a man of hubris and a blight to the game dev community.    It's simply a comment regarding the historical aspects and corrective of your comment ""his own creation.""

Dude's a multi-millionaire apparently. I see two possibilities:   The guy so badly mismanaged his own money he put $10-$15 million (how do you have a $5,000,000 range of ""I don't know if I lost it or not""?) towards a game and then just let the people he hired do whatever they wanted without oversight He actually provided oversight into how his money was being spent, and still green-lit the epic pile of shit the game was anyway.    I'm sure he's crying about it, but he can dry his tears with the other millions he undoubtedly has.   Also, is it just me or does the article's quotes read like Pitchford is raving a bit? Like, bouncing from one bullshit thing to another without rhyme or reason, or completely ignoring the actual issues of the game and focusing on stuff that, while criticized, weren't the core issues the game had?"

Games,3dmkls,Tezasaurus,16,Sat Jul 18 11:10:29 2015 UTC,"THis actually puts a lot more perspective about what happened with A:CM.  When you have inverstor money, you don't really care about it besides ""Not going over budget"" and ""Release Milestones on time""  if the game tanks it hurts, but it was investor risk to begin with. If it does awesome.. then AWESOME!!! and all that.   However I've been trying to put myself in Randy's shoes (not in the defensive way but trying to understand why he did what he did) and seeing about him losing his own money makes a lot of sense in many ways.   First there was the money mismanagement, they managed money and  ran ut of it, this (if the rumors are true) could put Gearbox right in the crosshair of a lawsuit by SEGA. So at this point he thinks ""Well I'm sure Aliens will sell well so we'll be profitable, I'll put some of my money in there to finish funding and get it back from sales""  Now this is where the problems started happening. I'm thinking that they realized they didn't have the manpower to finish borderlands and A:CM at the same time, but they couldn't drop or suspend development from either (BL is they main money maker, A:CM probably has legal ties with SEGA).   So they probably went the ""Mercenary"" route. Outsource part (or whole) of the game for cheap and it can be finished on time while we work on BL and finish it on time. (At this point he has personal money riding on this so he really really really needs to make this back).  Then the game comes back from the ""Mercenaries"", it's a pile of shit. He knows this, everyone knows this. He starts Hyperventilating, 15 million down the drain, piece of shit product and 15 million of his own personal money riding on this (they probably ran out of funding again which would explain all the cut assets and contents in A:CM).   Now Randy is freaking out, he has effectively nothing except a promise to SEGA for a game that's shit, and 15 million less in the bank account. Revenue from BL won't come quick enough to fund more into the game and he's basically looking for stuff to make his money back at least. Keep using some old footage, lie on some interviews, block people that ask the wrong questions and basically play dumb until release date because he knows Steam doesn't give refunds.   And here we are.   See, people think of EA like this business that only cares about money and does anything to anyone just for some extra cash, and people are right about that. EA is a company and their goal is to make money. But EA is a public company, if they lose 10 million $ , nobody really gives a fuck unless it messes with your earnings call and makes the Stock go down in price.   HOWEVER when personal money gets involved, like in this case with Randy. That's when the truly sadistic shit happens. That's when someone will do ANYTHING to make it work or make it back, like it happened this time with Randy."

If I had to give this phenomenon a name, I'd call it 'democratic censorship'.

""And I will make a review (understand : no judgement, just copy pasta from your PR department) of that shitty game you still expect to sell at least a bit to cover the costs.""

If there's one issue that's actually legitimate criticism of games journalism, it's that journalists as a whole are far too cozy with publishers. It's not uncommon for publishers to invite pundits to Seattle or LA or New York for a few days, put them up in a hotel with all the other gamers, give them tons of free food and ask them to play, livestream or test their in-progress games. It's not exactly bribery, but it's clearly buttering them up; you're in a great hotel with food, drinks, a brand new game and in the company of people who you love and share your hobbies.   Worse yet are the companies that deny you access to review copies if you don't attend those events.

At the end of the day, when you spend money on something, you can't spend it on something else. So when the wallet got dry and Alien was nowhere near done despite SEGA having given a lot of cash... well money had to show up somehow.

The content that those people produce, they profit from views. I get it, and it’s part of our world but dude…I mean, I still see videos from people suggesting 9/11 is staged and they’re very convincing but… I mean I’m just grateful that people care enough about our stuff that it’s a worthy enterprise for them to spend that kind of time.

Games,3dmkls,handwavium,10,Sat Jul 18 12:35:25 2015 UTC,Well it serves him right for releasing a shitty product.  CD Projekt in contrast used 15 Million $ to create one of the best games ever and here Pitchford is whining about his shitty investment. What strikes me though is that Pitchford simply can't admit that Colonial Marines is an objectively poor product. It seems impossible for him to admit they screwed up. This isn't subjective or a matter of taste.
Games,3dmkls,DeeJayDelicious,58,Sat Jul 18 05:16:14 2015 UTC,"Going off topic here, because I see this incorrectly stated way too much.  The Witcher 3 actually cost about 67 million. 32 was development costs and another 35 was marketing/PR.  I don't know who started the rumour, but I think originally the budget for the games development was meant to be 15 million, but after countless delays it snowballed into something much bigger. If TW3 hadn't sold as well as it did, CDPR would have been in a sticky situation financially. Kind of ironic using it as a good example of budgeting. :p"

Games,3dmkls,Malhavoc430,10,Fri Jul 17 17:28:26 2015 UTC,"Even then TW2 shipped in a slightly rocky (but playable) state, and they continued development for big v2 and v3 patches that paved the way for the console release a year later.  It would be interesting to compare budgets of both TW2 and TW3 when developments mostly stops on both of them."
Games,3dmkls,plank_,3,Fri Jul 17 15:47:01 2015 UTC,"Nowadays, I honestly don't know how any AAA games can be made with a development budget of less than, say, $25-30 million.  This is especially true of open world games.  Those motherfuckers cost a lot.  Here's my hamfisted attempt at putting development cost into perspective.  Let's say you have 100 people working on the development of a project.  Open world games typically require many more than 100 people working on it over the course of their development, but we'll just go with 100 for now.    Let's also say that the world is an equitable place and the studio's employees are paid an average of $50,000 USD annually.  (We won't even get into things like health insurance and other benefit costs.)  So each year of development costs the studio $5 million in wages, alone.  The Witcher 3 took at least 3 years to develop, right?  That's at least $15 million in wages.  We haven't even attempted to look at rent, utilities, equipment, software licenses, etc.  Now look at a game like Grand Theft Auto 5.  That game reportedly began development in 2008, and was released towards the end of 2013.  That's at least 5 years of development, and I wager that game had many more than 100 people working on it.  Even if we lowball Rockstar's wage estimates at $5m a year, that's a hefty $25m just to pay its staff throughout the project's development.    Video game development is a fucking expensive endeavor.  Even though this industry tends to pay its workers significantly less than what they're really worth, it's still absurd how much of a money vacuum it can be."
Games,3dmkls,TJ_McWeaksauce,6,Fri Jul 17 16:07:43 2015 UTC,"There's also a difference in location. CD Project for instance is a Polish developer, where average income is a lot lower, hence why they could transform the amount of money they ultimately had into a lot more game than what you'd get in a location like San Francisco.   Of course, a lot of game devs are also very much personally invested in their jobs and love what they do, so they are more likely to tolerate a below-average income."
Games,3dmkls,SilverhawkPX45,4,Fri Jul 17 15:56:15 2015 UTC,"Let's also say that the world is an equitable place and the studio's employees are paid an average of $50,000 USD annually.

Games,3dmkls,Vocith,3,Fri Jul 17 16:14:14 2015 UTC,Interesting that the Witcher 3 actually cost more in marketing than actual development.  Really says all you need to know about the current state of the game industry. Imagine if that $67m was pure development.
Games,3dmkls,caster,5,Fri Jul 17 16:38:57 2015 UTC,"If that was the case, then no one but the diehards would have bought the game--certainly not the sales volume needed to recoup the game's development costs.  Like it or not, marketing has always been a part of gaming, especially when the publisher is trying to hit sales volume in the millions."
Games,3dmkls,yfph,2,Fri Jul 17 16:34:42 2015 UTC,"Although that is the prevailing wisdom in the industry, I am not entirely sure that is true.  I for one mostly learn about games (especially which ones are worth buying) from other people and not from promotional material. It could be that if you make a really, really good game that people will want to play it with their friends and market it for you. In a sense quality is its own marketing because everyone wants to play really good games.  Now, if you need to hit that sales target quickly then you have a problem. If you absolutely need your first week's sales to be X million, then this is totally not going to work. You absolutely need to market before launch or that is just impossible.  It seems to me that the primary purpose of such heavy marketing is to get a lot of sales in a short period of time. Especially very soon after launch. Which leads us to the current situation where a lot of people preorder or day 1 purchase a title only to discover it's actually terrible. Aggressive marketing gets people to buy your product sight unseen, allowing you to slip a weak title past people. We have all had this happen to us.  You also need to factor in the goodwill behind the brand name as well. The Witcher 3 is likely an unusual title in that a lot of people trust CD Projekt Red and The Witcher brand. Arguably they didn't need to market it as aggressively as various other publishers who are more known for trying to screw with their customers, releasing shoddy sequels, and various other shenanigans.  That trust and goodwill is literally worth actual dollars in reducing the need to aggressively market the product."
Games,3dmkls,caster,3,Fri Jul 17 20:50:29 2015 UTC,"You may want to apply for a job at Coca-Cola. They pay millions each year for Super Bowl commercials, but you seem to know more about marketing than people who do it for a living, so you would be a shoe-in for the job."
Games,3dmkls,Malhavoc430,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:06:39 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that CDPR knows about some of the consumer goodwill on the internet yet why did they, the companies with whom they partnered, or both decide on a marketing budget that eclipsed the game's development costs?  You argue that they didn't need to market it aggressively, yet you offer ephemeral notions of consumer goodwill and an n of 1 (personal anecdote) to support your argument.  Do you have any more substantial numbers or additional facts to make your argument at least convincing?"
Games,3dmkls,yfph,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:31:41 2015 UTC,"There trying to expand. Witcher 3 is targeted at the Skyrim market - to cut into a fanbase that's both incredibly large and has been completely unserved for four years.

Games,3dmuil,Traiklin,3,Sat Jul 18 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the part where it would get nasty.  Like, let's say you started off running a Windows XP box from within Windows 7 or 8 as a virtual machine in VMWare or something.  No problem.    You can even set them up to have a common shared folder through some devilry.  And XP box could be running a Dreamcast emulator like NullDC, since there was a homebrew DOSBox port for Dreamcast.  But to use it, you'd have to create a virtual disc image to run in NullDC.  Do it in 64-bit mode, drop it in the 32-bit shared folder, and load in NullDC.  So, let's see...  That might could run DOSUAE, a Commodore Amiga emulator.  Which has its own virtual disk format.  So, um...  OK, you'd have to first run UAE on the 64-bit side to generate a hard drive image that you then would burn onto the Dreamcast CD to load into DOSBox, etc etc.   You could probably do a C-64 emulator below that, maybe through VICE, which would mean pre-prepping a C64 disk image in Windows VICE to go into the Windows Amiga emulator to create the Amiga drive image for DOSUAE that goes into the Dreamcast CD that goes in the shared folder that Jack built.    And so on.  From there...  I'm not even sure what a C-64 could run as a virtual machine.  Ooh, wait.  Infocom games!  Their entire schtick was that they used a global virtual machine system to standardize the game format and make porting simple.      So you could (maybe) go through all this -six layers of VMs- and end up within a Z-interpreter on the C-64 running through UAE on DOSBox for Dreamcast running on Windows XP within Windows 64... playing Zork.

MK9 brought a good amount of depth to Mortal Kombat making it a legitimate fighting game. MKX has so far expanded on this and is actually a fairly deep fighting game experience, with a pretty high level of execution. It is not as deep as SF or KOF and such in my opinion but it is still hella fun to watch and play. In fact, last years EVO for both Injustice and MK9 did pretty well considering MK9 was a few years old especially with Sonic Fox taking first in both games.  I would definitely recommend for you to at least check it out while the streams are on. It is currently on SRKEVO4 on Twitch. Watch for players like Gross, Sonic Fox, DJT/MIT, Tyrant, Chris G, Pig and others that will be putting on high level play. I think at the very least, as a fighting game fan, you will find at least some appreciation for the game. Cheers!"

Games,3dm346,Ezreal_As_lt_Gets,85,Fri Jul 17 13:46:19 2015 UTC,Sounds like Brutal Legend and Broken Age. Psychonauts and Grim Fandango were the exact opposite of what he just said.
Games,3dm346,sirhatsley,113,Fri Jul 17 14:06:48 2015 UTC,"Grim Fandango was a Lucasarts game. Although Schafer was project lead, I can guarantee he had someone higher up (not Lucas) making sure the project was perfect. Can't explain Psychonauts."
Games,3dm346,ZombieNinjaPanda,89,Fri Jul 17 14:18:32 2015 UTC,"Maybe he's just good at designing games, but not good at producing them. Pretty sure he was more of a producer with Brutal Legend, and he kinda had to be both with Broken Age."
Games,3dm346,sirhatsley,12,Fri Jul 17 14:22:28 2015 UTC,"That's the whole thing with Tim Schafer, he's extremely awesome in making games and the whole creative side of it. But it seems like he's just very very very bad at Project Management.   Which is not really an easy thing and sometimes companies even hire people completely unrelated to the field as project manager so they can focus on Budget/Time without being biased towards the art."
Games,3dm346,daguito81,35,Fri Jul 17 18:17:03 2015 UTC,That's what I believe. Love Tim but he can not handle budgets and other stuff. Hope Kojima does better when he goes solo.
Games,3dm346,DragonEevee1,7,Fri Jul 17 17:06:31 2015 UTC,"Would he even go solo? I don't really know where to check but I believe most of his projects have run even or made a ton of money haven't they? Doesn't it seem rather possible that he could just waltz into sony HQ, say he wants to make a game that will bring the ps4 into the spotlight, and get all the money in the world thrown at him? Little exaggeration for sure but Kojima doesn't disappoint a lot, he's a fairly safe bet and if they agree beforehand to put some restrictions on the amount of money he can use i'm sure he can deal with that."
Games,3dm346,mysticmusti,4,Fri Jul 17 17:52:21 2015 UTC,"He's definitely been getting emails from people but it's really up to him what he wants to do. No matter what he's going to choose what he thinks will make him and his audience happiest, and I think that's going to  be him having as much freedom as possible, especially since he got tied down at konami to MGS for decades. So I can see him going indie or going to a company."
Games,3dm346,Pkacua,5,Fri Jul 17 18:02:52 2015 UTC,I think Kojima has enough of a name to leverage that in contracts to have all the freedom he desires without having to deal with everything he doesn't want to.   He could probably go to an studio or a Sony First Party Studio and say he will make PS4 exclusive games but he will make whatever he wants. Sony'll probably go for something like that and fund/market giving him a lot or even total freedom in the process
Games,3dm346,daguito81,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:19:18 2015 UTC,"Honestly I really don't see him going Indie if for the simple reason that his games while absolutely wonderful also require a ton of money, Shenmue 3 ended with 6.3 mill which is fucking huge for a fan funded game but I don't think I see Kojima bringing in more than that which he would definitely need, maybe co funded by both fans and a company but that would probably piss a lot of people off."
Games,3dm346,mysticmusti,2,Sat Jul 18 14:52:52 2015 UTC,"Yes. It sounds extremely plausible.  I can picture the call now. ""Hi, SCEA? Yes, my name is Hideo Kojima.

Games,3dm346,ILIKETOWRITETHINGS,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:01:38 2015 UTC,"I think there's a higher chance Kojima will try to go to a third party publisher like Square before going to Sony. He's said in the past that he really wants everybody to be able to play his games, no matter what system they play on. That's not to say he won't take Sony if they give him the best deal/options, but it seems like Kojima is going to start a massive bidding war between publishers."

I think somebody who didn't know what they were talking about said ""Tim Schafer is a good artist but he needs a producer"" one day and everybody just thought it sounded good so they all started repeating it.  Tim Schafer was the writer and director of Broken Age. Greg Rice was the producer. Double Fine even has a separate guy who is responsible for handling the finances. Maybe this is just a function of gaming being popular with young people and always pulling in more people who just haven't had time to learn how things work yet, but we really need more visibility for the realities of game development, because otherwise people make assumptions and those assumptions become ""the general consensus"" without anybody taking the time to figure out if they're actually true."

Games,3dm346,frostedWarlock,22,Fri Jul 17 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"Psychonauts gets super tough near the end, I'll give you that. I still haven't beaten the game, since the final level is evil, but other than that, the latter half of the game is more interesting.  I hear a lot of people say that Grim Fandango loses its charm after Year 2, but I personally disagree. Year 2 just sticks with people since it is convoluted and massive, so many gamers probably spent a majority of their time there. The climax to the game is excellent though, and you would be hard-pressed to find somebody who disagrees."
Games,3dm346,sirhatsley,6,Fri Jul 17 15:39:08 2015 UTC,since the final level is evil   I believe the versions on Steam and GOG got an update that eased the difficulty on the meat circus.

On the flip side, shortly after launch I got a 'free' copy via Xbox Gold. So now I have two copies (PC and Xbox One), where i wouldn't have bought one if I had known i'd get a free copy.  So now I'm in this weird place where I don't want to provide support in the future because ...  a) risk funding kickstarters as they fail/under-deliver quite frequently, and   b) more often than not, the games are available at 75-90% discounts a year after launch and/or get given away for free by platform owners (Sony/Microsoft/Apple)."

They started the Massive Chalice Kickstarter in May, 2013, then the infamous ""we ran out of money for Broken age"" update came out in July. I'm not saying the intention was to funnel the Massive Chalice money into Broken Age, but the timing sure as hell made it look that way."

Games,3dm346,veevoir,10,Fri Jul 17 13:13:47 2015 UTC,"Have you watched the Broken Age documentary? I know it's easy to throw around the idea that Tim Schafer doesn't understand the word budget, but it's not as easy to run a studio in San Francisco as you might imagine.   As for the dates, February 2012 was when the ""Doulbe Fine Adventure"" game was launched. May 2013 was when ""Massive Chalice"" began crowdfunding. September 2014 was when the ""Spacebase DF-9"" announcement was headed toward full release."
Games,3dm346,QQNoodles,31,Fri Jul 17 13:33:21 2015 UTC,"I might imagine, but it's not like they didn't know their studio is in SF beforehand and it came as surprise, suddenly weighting hard on the budget. Didn't watch the documentary, so if that was the case - it would prove the point even more..  And that budget was multiple of what was asked. Sure, they added stretch goals that increased the size of the game - but it is also a question of budgeting - don't suggest stuff you can't afford to make.  The fact how both Broken Age and Spacebase have fallen out kinda proves DF has issues with proper budget management. A lot of KS companies have (or at least had with their first project), but nobody had so much success (cash vs original goal) connected with such suction for additional funding to finish the game."
Games,3dm346,veevoir,6,Fri Jul 17 13:44:29 2015 UTC,"Watch the documentary if you haven't seen it. It's free on youtube.  What they asked for doesn't really matter much when they received ten times the money.  Personally I don't think SF has anything to do with it, their budgets seemed fine and well thought out from what we saw on the documentary. I think it all came down to them getting ten times the money they asked for, so they aimed for a game to match the money. If they had not done this, people would have been just as angry with them."

Games,3dm346,vattenpuss,8,Sat Jul 18 07:38:44 2015 UTC,"The idea, originally was to make a much shorter game. The way Doublefine works has different teams working on different projects at different times. So when a project that was blocked out for a few months suddenly turns into a multi-million dollar project it requires some massive changes. How big should a $3 million game be? How long do you make the game? How long will it take for the programmers to make sure everything is working properly? How soon can you get the next stage of development going? Tim Schafer fully admitted the game could be a total mess but he also allowed the process to be documented so people could see what game development looks like from the inside. Warts and all.   If you have the time, the Broken Age documentary is on youtube and it's certainly worth a watch."
Games,3dm346,QQNoodles,3,Fri Jul 17 14:05:00 2015 UTC,Is there anything in the documentary to justify or explain why part 2 was 95% recycled locations and characters?
Games,3dm346,reversememe,2,Sat Jul 18 00:40:33 2015 UTC,"My assumption is that that was the case from the game's conception. It makes sense to me. You start with characters in one context, and then in the second part you have the same characters in each other's contexts. Maybe they didn't execute on it as well as they could have, but the idea is sound.  Oh well. Never underestimate the modern gamer's unquenchable thirst for ""new content."""
Games,3dm346,bvilleneuve,1 point,Sat Jul 18 12:10:18 2015 UTC,"This modern gamer's been playing games since the Apple II.  Broken Age was a classic point and click. These games always relied on novelty for progression, and usually ground to a halt if you missed the one thing that could bring progress.  There are a few exceptions like Quest for Glory that actually included dynamic gameplay / combat to give you something to do. But the main thing is to see what's next, meet characters, enjoy a story and some nice art.  Either way, BA pt 2 is a compete bait and switch, not only in terms of content, but in breaking its own logic too, with the two leads coordinating through telepathy it seems for no reason other than to satisfy video game logic and stretch out an already very thin plot.  My impression of pt 2 was that they changed their minds about a few plot points and tried to play it off as if that was the plan all along. The fact that all of this is done in the first 5 minutes of pt 2 is a pretty strong hint they painted themselves into a corner."
Games,3dm346,reversememe,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:50:34 2015 UTC,"It doesn't justify it, but it does explain it. Tim Schafer overruled everyone telling him ""No"" time and again, and tried to tell basically two separate stories (Bella and Schay) on a budget that could barely cover one game."

Some areas are still expensive to live but overall the cost of living for people is much lower than San Fran. On top of that Seattle and the Eastside (Bellevue, Kirkland, Redmond, Issaquah and Sammamish) probably has one of the highest concentrations of game developers in the country AND we've got one of the most prestigious gaming schools in the country.

That's the consideration I'm making when I'm wondering if DF could survive a move.

With Broken Age/DFA the separation of Backer and Public information really bit them, misinformation was very easily spread and they couldn't quickly release the full information without betraying the expectations set for the backers. This article for example is a compilation of quotes from the last episode of the Double Fine Adventure documentary and is misleading due to being poorly worded. It's intro says   Tim Schafer says studio put nearly twice as much into crowdfunded adventure game as it raised on Kickstarter, ""will just about make that back""   i.e. Doublefine spent about 9 million dollars on the game  Then the relevant quote is:   ""With Kickstarter, the risk is gone of losing money on it, so you know you've broken even if you just make the game to that amount of money. But we made it [for], like, twice as much almost as we got in. Or more. So we will just about make that back.""   i.e. It cost about twice as much as they brought in, about $6-7 million.

I had only played Grim Fandango and Psychonauts, but when I picked up DF's Humble Bundle, I decided to play through everything the studios done. Problem is a started with the delightful Stacking and the pretty good Costume Quest, and ended with the disappointing Brutal Legend and the downright bad Spacebase and Hack 'n' Slash. After having mixed feelings about Broken Age, I decided to take a break from the company for awhile, though Massive Chalice sounds perfect for me on paper."
Games,3dm346,Madazhel,2,Fri Jul 17 22:18:06 2015 UTC,"Having followed development the whole way through, it's honestly a shame that Broken Age's development problems (which occurred in the middle of the Kickstarter campaign) probably interfered with the size of the budget they ended up with for Massive Chalice.   I think it would have been interesting to see what they could do with a larger budget, but they made a pretty tight game with some interesting ideas with what they had."
Games,3dm346,zherok,4,Fri Jul 17 23:59:08 2015 UTC,"Yes it is. The tactical combat is really satisfying and I enjoy trying to manage the strategic layer, building/researching, sorting out partnerships and dealing with random events.  The combat looks superficially like XCOM, but it is fundamentally different. In XCOM you are dealing with exclusively ranged attacks, moving from cover to cover and using overwatch to manage enemy mobility.  In Massive Chalice you need to manage line of sight. You need to try to move cautiously and ensure that the enemies that can see you are stunned or otherwise unable to engage you in their turn. There is no overwatch or cover bonus so you can move around a lot more freely and use corners and the ability of some of your heroes to stealth to your advantage.  But the thing I like most about it is that it embraces the inevitability of death. Your heroes age and die, you cannot get too attached to an individual hero because eventually even if you play perfectly they will die and you will need to move on. I am the kind of player that will save/load to avoid deaths in XCOM, but in Massive Chalice I can accept even the deaths I accidentally cause in battle from friendly fire and keep going. I think this is kind of a sticking point for some people though, because they find it harder to get attached to a family line rather than an individual."

How can such a relatively simple game such as Broken Age have gone over its large budget by twice its amount is beyond me. Especially considering this is a studio with pedigree in the genre.

Neither managed it well, it seems. The current person in that role, Justin Bailey (who handles Business Deveopment as COO), seems to have just been bullied into funding Broken Age. All the awesome deals they've scored to remaster and re-release older games or put games on new platforms just wound up funding BA, which, at best, will now break even? That's got to suck for him, given the amount of time and effort he went into to secure that extra money :-/"
Games,3dm346,2Cuil4School,8,Fri Jul 17 13:29:49 2015 UTC,There was a producer over Tim. Also he had a large meeting with all of the major people in the company to determine what to do when the game started stretching it's budget. They decided to extend the budget and split the game into two Acts.  Tim did not act alone and rampage with cash.

I don't doubt that Tim intends to finish the projects he starts, even if he can't keep the scope realistic enough to do it under budget and on time.   With Molyneux, especially with his last game, he seems content to just move on once the luster comes off. It's not his money, but he definitely had a hand in shifting development to the more lucrative mobile platforms. And when the money ran out, he left it to a literal ascended fanboy to finish, and then surprised even his own employees with the announcement of a new project. Also, I think he would prefer people see him as just a doddering old man who dared to dream too big, rather than a pathological liar who just wants someone to fund his ideas until he gets bored and wants to move onto the next one."

Literally just a dead end cliff face that screams ""we ran out of money"" at you.  And in the final ending area, you don't even get off your bloody ship. You get 5 seconds of a cutscene shown out of the ship and that's it and you leave.  The plot twists came out of nowhere and didn't even feel fully resolved. I can't even remember what happened to the major villain who suddenly appeared on the TV monitors 5 minutes before the game ended to spout exposition at us.

The idea with DF's Kickstarter was to employ a team that would otherwise have been laid off because a publisher cancelled a project that DF was commissioned for. They got so much money that it automatically expanded the scope of the game, and then they had to expand the team with more hires, to not make it take even longer to make.  Now, the controversial aspect then is that the creative team, Schafer included, found out relatively quickly that the ideas they had were beyond even the expanded scope of the money they had gotten. So they decided to throw in their own money and more time to try and make the game stand out, as there was a lot of pressure riding on it since it was the first big breakout Kickstarter game. The decision to make the game episodical (still just one purchase though) was to try and get some money in the middle of development to finish it off.  This is their own explanation from the documentary, as I remember it anyway."

Games,3dm346,veevoir,5,Fri Jul 17 12:58:47 2015 UTC,"The other side to that is if the ks is offering cheap versions of the game - if everyone gets that price then you're reducing your income in the long term, so it makes sense to tail off the incentive to buy early (no more stretch goals) and some people will wait until the full priced final release to buy."

Here is the original lowest tier reward:   The finished game in all of its awesome glory DRM free on PC, Mac, and Linux, or via Steam for PC and Mac, exclusive access to the Beta on Steam, access to the video series, and access the private discussion community.   Nothing at all about iOS. It was a PC game and documentary first and foremost. They didn't announce mobile support until much later in the cycle.  It was also never supposed to be retro, Tim said to Eurogamer early on in the Kickstarter:   it's not a museum piece or just a nostalgia piece.

I'm not watching the whole documentary to find a quote, if you can't be more specific then I'm just going to assume that you agree that it wasn't really said, other than perhaps a passing comment, perhaps not even from Schafer. I'm not just trusting your memory.  $400,000 is not a small budget, Tim is just bad with money. FTL raised half that. On the other end of the spectrum the original Witcher game was only $7 million, the second was $10 million.  How could Schafer not afford to make a cheap point and click adventure for $3.3million? Why can Daedalic make 11 similar games for the price of one much shorter Schafer game? Why could Schafer make Psychonauts for $13million but he couldn't make this simple game for $3million?  But don't take my word for it, this guide says that big mobile game budgets are around £250,000 ($380,000). This was never going to be a complex game, its just a point and click. I would be shocked if complex recent point and click adventure games (I'm thinking Machinarium, Deponia had budgets around that size. If it was going to be a pixel art mobile game then it would have had a much lower minimum goal than that."

As our first adventure game, watching the documentary helped us out a ton because we knew what had happened to create the game, absolutely amazing.

Games,3dm346,lobjawz,46,Fri Jul 17 22:51:21 2015 UTC,"I think this shows us several things. Double Fine, either due to it's location in cost prohibitive San Francisco or simply it's poor management, can't really do all that much with $6 million. That with that kind of money the best they can do is make an average point and click game with a metacritic score of 73 and a completion time of 10 hours. I would strongly urge those willing to open their pocket for Tim Schafer in the future to consider this when they inevitably low ball their projected cost of development. That said while I was writing this I looked up how much Pillars of Eternity raised and holy shit they made a 40 hour isometric RPG only raising $4.2 million. So if Obsidian asks for money in the future you're much safer putting your money there."
Games,3dm346,Cbird54,39,Fri Jul 17 14:25:07 2015 UTC,"We know that Pillars raised $4.2 (prior to fees), but that does not tell us the budget of the game. I haven't found any official announcement regarding its budget, just people who used the funds raised to say they made the game for that amount.  As we have seen with other kickstarters, the amount raised and the amount spent on development are not necessarily related. Devs can have other sources of funding including:   Publishers (Pillars did use a publisher for distribution at the very least) Other investors Their own funds"
Games,3dm346,Ranneko,4,Fri Jul 17 12:56:34 2015 UTC,Let's try this another way:  My $20 gave me a certain amount of value when I gave it to Double Fine Adventure. Other people's $20 gave them a whole lot less value than that when they gave to things like Spacebase DF-9.  Another $20 that I gave to Obsidian (or was it $35? I can't remember) gave me a whole hell of a lot more value than the same amount of money given to DF.
Games,3dm346,ILIKETOWRITETHINGS,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:24:34 2015 UTC,"It depends on the conversation you want to have. If I want to have a useful informed discussion about game costs and development like the one this article suggests then what matters is the actual budget, not the amount raised on kickstarter.  This isn't to say that crowdsourced money isn't a factor in these conversations, but it definitely isn't the whole of it. It is really important to remember that crowdsourced money does not necessarily equal the whole budget and I see people making that mistake repeatedly.  It is also worth noting that crowdfunding results in voluntary price discrimination. I paid a lot more for Pillars than I did for Broken Age. I don't think I got as much value as one of the key elements I paid for (monuments) were handled in a way I frankly feel was lazy and completely undercut the idea.  Finally you are comparing very different games, if I was after a point and click adventure and you said ""Go buy this fantasy RPG instead, it is better value"" I would be somewhat irritated by the response."
Games,3dm346,Ranneko,4,Sat Jul 18 04:17:27 2015 UTC,True but we do know several things. They raised enough money to complete the game in one go without breaking it into several acts. According to the amount of owners just on Steam they made close roughly $19.5 million enough to justify making expansion packs.
Games,3dm346,Cbird54,22,Sat Jul 18 06:54:13 2015 UTC,"Yes, Pillars of Eternity is very successful. But that is not relevant to the question of budget. We know what the budget for Broken Age was because that information as been released. We do not know the budget for Pillars. Comparing them is not very useful, especially when you factor in the completely different genre, story, style and audience. A 40 hour point and click adventure would be incredibly difficult to make as an entertaining product.  It is really really important that we remember that a crowdfunding projects goals or results are not the budget. Without that we end up with completely unrealistic expectations as to how much it costs to make games."
Games,3dm346,Ranneko,35,Fri Jul 17 13:51:51 2015 UTC,$6m is enough money to run the game studio I work for for about 6 months. We are bigger than BF but also in a cheaper market. The fact that they did this game for $6m is pretty astounding. Same with Obsidian and Pillars.
Games,3dm346,Jandur,15,Fri Jul 17 13:57:09 2015 UTC,Yeah people grossly underestimate how much it costs to really build a game.  Just in salaries/benefits alone you're looking at millions per year for a small studio.  I worked at one place with 6 full-time employees and maybe 4 contractors and our burn rate was ~200k per month and we were in a super low rent office and everything.
Games,3dm346,Antidote,6,Fri Jul 17 14:28:40 2015 UTC,"Obsidian is also in California, mind. And they ended up fronting their own money into the game. As did Wasteland 2. And D:OS had a money on the side from the start."
Games,3dm346,Krokodzl,8,Fri Jul 17 18:09:07 2015 UTC,"While Orange County (where Obsidian is located) isn't the cheapest place in the world, the cost of living is much lower than it is in San Francisco (where Double Fine is located)."
Games,3dm346,PossesseDCoW,23,Fri Jul 17 14:19:00 2015 UTC,"This is the frustrating thing about when people talk about Double Fine.  When people talk about Double Fine they think they are experts on running a business and understand game publishing. The things they say echo big AAA video game publishers, saying the game should cost this much, not a dollar more. If Double Fine didn't show any of their money information out to the public you would have no problems with how they do things, just like you have no problems with Obsedian. Pillars budget is more then what they get from Kickstarter, but they don't show that to the public because people will start going on about how they suck managing their money.  Here is the thing, almost every game you have ever played has gone over budget, because that is how the creative process works. Unless it's a yearly release like Assassins Creed, sports games, call of duty, ext, it is really hard to exactly budget a game from the start. Almost everything is unknown when you sit down to make a game, especially a new IP. The budget can change throughout, and that isn't a bad thing, as long as the business can support it, which DF did. So no, they didn't mismanage anything, all DF did was show you the inner workings on their studio in detail, and the general response to that was to treat them like a AAA publisher would."
Games,3dm346,BARDLER,5,Fri Jul 17 14:48:28 2015 UTC,"In the same vein, CIG raised $85 million and after 2.5 years they've released an arena space shooter.  (Note: I'm a huge Star Citizen fan, but the project is going through tough times right now.)"
Games,3dm346,Baryn,2,Fri Jul 17 16:31:52 2015 UTC,"Purely speculative, but I suspect management is probably a factor at studios that rely on Kickstarters.  Say what you will about shitty publishers like EA, Activision, and Ubi, but they have the development cycle well in hand in a way that cowboy studios probably just don't."

Games,3dm346,Cbird54,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:29:24 2015 UTC,"That sounds a little slow. I 100%'d the game (piece of shit incorrectly designed OP dragon et al.), read everything I ever came across, and listened to all the voice acting and clicked through all the dialogue except the backer NPCs, and Steam claims I had the game OPEN for 46 hours.  With that said, they were 46 glorious hours, and I never walked in circles for three hours because I failed to realize that they expected you to sit there and wait for literally 130 seconds of looping dialogue about a snake choking you.   Act 2's puzzles were not good."
Games,3dm346,ILIKETOWRITETHINGS,3,Fri Jul 17 13:42:37 2015 UTC,"I'm pleased, because it was a lovely experiment and I'm pleased they did it, but holy smokes did that second act ever confuse me. There were four or five ""seriously?"" moments in there that just didn't need to happen."
Games,3dm346,ILIKETOWRITETHINGS,12,Sat Jul 18 04:20:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly all the mismanagement and public controversy just makes me sad. Broken Age was meant to be a love letter with fan support and it became this massive inconsistent mess.  I loved the first half of the game, liked the second half, and loved the documentary. It's just a shame Doublefine and Broken Age had so many sour notes to what was meant to be a joyous release."
Games,3dm346,punster_mc_punstein,11,Sat Jul 18 04:00:56 2015 UTC,"I honestly think the biggest problem is that the game ultimately just wasn't very good and didn't match up to people's hopes of what a modern point-and-click game would be. I don't think it's down to unrealistic expectations, either, just them deciding to go in a different direction than people wanted.  Still, breaking even isn't bad. Not a great result if you're a shareholder seeking profits, but a whole bunch of programmers and artists got paid to create something and there's certainly value in that."
Games,3dm346,halo,9,Fri Jul 17 13:32:26 2015 UTC,In the end looks like that publisher were right few years ago when they stopped funding point and click games.  This business is not profitable at the production levels that DF wants.
Games,3dm346,bubman,20,Fri Jul 17 13:52:48 2015 UTC,"See, there are still Point and Click games coming out to this day. They still make money and look pretty good. It's just that the project was mismanaged."
Games,3dm346,magmasafe,16,Fri Jul 17 13:20:59 2015 UTC,"There are many companies doing profitable point-and-clicks, they just tend to keep down both costs and production values (i.e. Daedalic).  I don't think we are ever gonna see another point and click with costs comparable to broken age."
Games,3dm346,bubman,5,Fri Jul 17 14:24:30 2015 UTC,"I suspect a studio running in a cheaper area (e.g., Stardock in Michigan, or CD Projekt in Poland) could manage to make AA-level entries in the genre just fine. Pay across the board is lower, rent/taxes are cheaper, and there's often even tax incentives in less ""traditional"" (e.g., outside of LA/SanFran/NYC/Boston/Austin/Raleigh--the major US game development hubs I'm familiar with) spots.  Of course, a studio that can nail down and stick to a budget and featureset is also important. Tim's a huge dreamer and creative, and with his position in the company (he owns the damn thing), I can't imagine it's very easy for the money people or development people to reign him in when necessary."

Games,3dm346,TweetsInCommentsBot,6,Fri Jul 17 14:38:08 2015 UTC,"Even if you look at the 'break even' level, that's possibly not so good. To me breaking even means there was no gain out of the endeavour, that they came out of it no better or worse than when they went in, and that the time might have been better spent on another project.  The non-financial exceptions to that would be the output of the game itself, or if they grew the studio in a way that lets them perform better in future."
Games,3dm346,plank_,3,Fri Jul 17 14:38:13 2015 UTC,"that the time might have been better spent on another project.   One of the main points of creating the kickstarter was that the team had been working on some contracted work for a publisher, but the publisher cancelled the game they were contracted for. If not for Broken Age, those people would have been laid off."
Games,3dm346,Clevername3000,2,Fri Jul 17 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"I didn't follow Broken Age development but they might have broken even and finished building / getting used to a new engine, have enough experience working together that their teams would be more productive on future projects or maybe the fact that they showed they were able to produce a decent game will allow them to raise more money in the future.  I mean, you'd have to work in the company to know but the 'break even' level of their future projects might be lower than BA, still, if a game that did as well as this one was barely profitable, you have to wonder how other less-known projects are doing."
Games,3dm346,MelonMelon28,1 point,Sat Jul 18 02:30:04 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that the issue is with the genre itself, but rather the studio. Broken Age suffered severely from feature creep and poor planning, which is evident from the Kickstarter updates that pretty much said that they finished up the story after the original release date. I understand that they had to change the release date after the scope of the game changed so much, but not even having finished writing the story before the original deadline is pretty telling, and might explain why the second act of the game was such a clusterfuck."
Games,3dm346,SteamingDuck,4,Fri Jul 17 14:56:17 2015 UTC,"The second half of Broken Age made me smile.  It was fun, and everything I wanted Broken Age to be.  If I was in it for a plot, I might be disappointed.  You get all the necessary information, but it's rushed and optional, in infodump form near the end.  But I'm in adventure games for the puzzle design, and in that regard Broken Age was incredible, teaching concepts that built on top of each other and avoiding the ""drag everything to everything"" mentality.  The two characters solved their problems in different ways, allowing you to ""turn off"" one part of your puzzle-solving brain for awhile to go to the other character.  Act One was dull to me, but because the split created Act Two, one of the best experiences I've had in recent years.   I'm happy."
Games,3dm346,SegataSanshiro,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:57:39 2015 UTC,"The second installment took too long to produce, and was filled with feelings of lost potential.   I admit I have lost trust in Double Fine."

Games,3dm346,ControversalWalrus,3,Fri Jul 17 14:10:35 2015 UTC,"The game didn't go into any development until after the Kickstarter ended. Most Kickstarted games are already well into development before they're kickstarted. So Broken Age was a $3 million budgeted game. You also have to take into account that they had to spend 400k of that on backer rewards, taxes, and fees to Kickstarter. Also, another 100k went towards 2Player Productions filming their documentary.   So basically what happened was they were given a larger amount than projected, so they gave the game a larger scope, but aimed too high. A lot of people are trashing Double Fine for that, but they don't seem to realize that this is exceedingly common in game development, on or off Kickstarter."

Games,3dmz6r,johnyann,9,Fri Jul 17 17:39:27 2015 UTC,"That saddens me, because College Hoops 2k8 is outstanding, outside of the gameplay which is really dated.  It's the best college basketball game and I know quite a few places that still update rosters and have franchises that are 10+ seasons.    As well, NCAA Football 14 was a great send-out for the college football game.   While it had it's problems, it was a really good college football game.  I'll miss the college sports games because it was hard to keep a dynasty going since you always lost key players every year."
Games,3dmz6r,Ice_Cold345,5,Fri Jul 17 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"The NCAA games have always been the best football games out there, but unfortunately, that's not saying much. EA cut down the quality of football games dramatically when they exclusively owned NFL and NCAA football licences. It's not even like they don't have time to improve the engine/features because 2k pumps out NBA games yearly and they make pretty nice changes.   Hopefully, with the loss of the NCAA titles, both studios can come together to make a great NFL game. Hell, I love the NFL but haven't bought Madden since 2010."

Mind if I ask you a question though(i know you probably don't know everything about a project, but worth asking)? Why did the NCAA team seem to make more improvements to gameplay modes? How come things like myplayer, coach mode, etc. are so much better in NCAA? Did they have a larger team to accommodate for all the content?

Is this correct?   If you were indeed making that joke, I just have to add that if we do continue seeing NCAA games that probably tells us that they were already making crazy profit and paying the players wasn't actually going to affect their profit by too much."
Games,3dmz6r,RippyZ,12,Fri Jul 17 20:56:17 2015 UTC,The problem is that the NCAA doesn't allow players to be paid.  So EA might be fine with paying players for their likeness but they can't.

Combine that with the increased cost of paying royalties to over 4000 players, and that is assuming your only putting in current players, and there is no reason to devote extra resources to the game.  If anything they might do even less now and try and minimize the cost to maximize profit."

If you were really exploring the galaxy, most of the planets would be completely barren and devoid of life. If the life bearing planets were more rare and hard to find, it would reduce the chances of you finding the same planet twice and make for a much more enjoyable experience.   I don't want to explore bland fantasy planet #2341, I want to fly into the eye of a giant storm on a gas giant. I want to explore the icy crags of a frozen world far from the sun. I want to traverse the vast baking desert of a planet orbiting a red giant. I'll pick up this game regardless, but the fact that they decided to make every planet look like a fucking final fantasy world is a huge turnoff for me.

Of the 10 percent that do, 90 percent of that life will be primitive and boring. The tiny fraction of garden worlds with more evolved life forms on them will thus be almost as rare in the game universe as they ought to be in the real one. This scarcity is part of the delicate balance that Hello Games is trying to strike between its idealistic commitment to the science of sci-fi and the inherent need to keep players entertained.""     http://www.theverge.com/2014/7/1/5856718/no-mans-sky-preview    1% of interesting inhabited planets seems low though, I hope there's a way to detect them."
Games,3dmxr4,xChris777,7,Fri Jul 17 19:57:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it is a tough balance to find. I hope for something like that you gradually get better at detecting planet types, so that you at least in the beginning will have to take your chances. And some incentive to actually visit barren planets - for mining rare metals or something."
Games,3dmxr4,Maldron_The_Assasin,2,Fri Jul 17 20:17:18 2015 UTC,They said that planets without life will have more resources
Games,3dmxr4,NoMoreBirds,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:25:55 2015 UTC,That give me a lot of hope for the game. I really do hope they put gas giants and more space based exploration in there as well.

At one point Sean said it would on average by every 20+ planets before you found any life at all, much less a planet teeming with life. They crank up the probability of finding a planet full of life for the demos to make it more interesting, which is why we haven't seen many barren planets so far."

I don't care what kind of wizardry they're claiming to employ, that's literally impossible. True, you might not find the exact same combination of something twice, but there will be alot of: ""Oh I remember that grass and those trees from that other planet"" moments.   Hell, most real planets are pretty similar and can fit into certain categories."

This whole series is pretty meh; while I've probably followed this game closer than most people because I'm really interested in it, I'm learning nothing new from any of them and a lot of it is rehashed info from previous videos with slightly different visuals. These five planets were even that varied. I'm still interested in the game but a lot of the games promotional material and info seems padded because they don't want to give away too much info about the game; and that is fine, but I don't see any of IGN's videos informing or swaying prospective buyers."

Games,3dmxr4,Tezasaurus,34,Sat Jul 18 14:31:14 2015 UTC,"considering one of main complaints has been ""all planets look the same"" then yes it is. the vid shows you that there IS variety and how the procedural algorithms determine whats actually in the planet based on certain factors i.e distance from the sun."
Games,3dmxr4,boomtrick,2,Fri Jul 17 16:19:54 2015 UTC,They've already said that in many other interviews and videos though; and these five planets weren't even that visually unique from each other. IGN is rehashing info that's already out there.
Games,3dmxr4,Tezasaurus,0,Fri Jul 17 17:50:59 2015 UTC,"what does that have to do with the title?  they are showing 5 ""new""(i guess that they mean by new is that they haven't officially named them? lol) planets. so why not have the title say ""heres 5 new planets""?  i don't understand why thats hard to get.   these five planets weren't even that visually unique from each other   except that they kind of were.  you had a yellowish, foggy planet that  rained alot and had beehive looking things .  you had a bright normal looking planet with a completely different set of wildlife.  next you had a planet with huge diamond floating(??) rocks.  then next you had one with red grass and egg looking things.  i fail to see how these things are not unique from each other.  unless your making the complaint that all planets have the same artistic theme i.e soft color pallettes, voxel based objects, etc. well no fucking shit, the theme of the game is going to be the same throughout, thats how games work lol.  for example each area in bloodborne was different from each other. yet each area had the same theme across each area. i.e each area was dark, worn down, bleak, barren, etc.   you didn't magically stumble into a field filled with flowers and sunshine and rainbows in the next area. the game was thematically consistent throughout."
Games,3dmxr4,boomtrick,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:39:09 2015 UTC,"You are coming off as excessively defensive. Are you a dev or IGN employee? :P  All I was saying is that there is no new information in this video, we already know and have seen that planet environments are affected by their distance from the sun, and if there are millions of planets then ""This one has different colored grass and this one has strange looking rocks"" is not exactly compelling. Earlier videos showed much more drastic variance between planet environments.  I'm a defender of this game amongst cynics and I can't wait to pour tons of time into it, but this video felt like a waste of time."

Games,3dmxr4,boomtrick,3,Fri Jul 17 16:46:17 2015 UTC,"I don't think anyone said that all planets would look the same but rather that planets will become repetitive after you have seen dozens of them.   i don't really understand your problem with the number 5   If we'd see repitition in 5 planets chosen at random that'd be a VERY bad sign(or we'd just be REALLY unlucky), not seeing that repitition is no sign at all . If we'd see no repitition in a hundred planets it would be a good sign."

I'm starting to feel like there just isn't much else to it, whereas I think their intention is to make it a mystery.   The Souls games are also shrouded in mystery, but the developers do a much better job at showing you the game and showing you how things will work. I remember when I was super hyped for Dark Souls to come out because I loved Demon's Souls so much, and watching developer previews and things like that. They actually showed fights, areas, mechanics. Dark Souls went from consumable healing items to the Estus Flask system, a huge change, and it was shown and explained. The mystery and mystique should come from the deeper aspects of the game, not from such a shallow level that if we see how crafting, trading, upgrading, or levelling up works we'll be put off or spoiled.  /Rant over"
Games,3dmxr4,unforgiven91,6,Sat Jul 18 07:02:39 2015 UTC,"As hyped as I have been for this game, I think the way they are keeping us at arms length at all times from any information about the game is ruining my interest overall.    I completly agree. I know it's a marketing tool to try and get players hyped and excite for a product shrouded in mystery. However, it is starting to feel like they are misleading us.  Clearly there is a large part to the game we have not been shown, such as:   What lies near the center of the universe Upgrading your space suit, ship, blaster What you can do with these materials, crafting? What the game is like when you meet another player. Is it like Journey where nothing really changes but you have a companion or are there more features. If 1% of the planets have these ecosystems like these 5 planets in the video, what can we extract from these oddities? What are the factions for? What is trading like?   Before I continue, this month of No Man's Sky on IGN is going to tell us a lot, if it doesn't Ill just assume there is not much to the game."

Looks a lot like destiny's interface you can combine materials and craft new alloys and sell them for money meeting players is considered a statistical impossibility. but they have a journey-like idea in place. a player will not be marked as such and there are no interaction features unless this has changed, but i don't think so. the other 3 i don't know"
Games,3dmxr4,Gundato,3,Sat Jul 18 12:47:05 2015 UTC,"Your example isn't right for this case though, as you said you loved demons souls it's natural to know what to expect. We really haven't seen such a large scale exploration game before,  it's difficult to grasp the concept of a game solely based on exploration..  But i do agree,  the way theyve been simultaneously hyping the game and keeping you away is sort of offputting. But maybe there really isn't much to show other than this,  that this is really the game.  I try to manage my expectations."
Games,3dmxr4,anononobody,2,Sat Jul 18 12:52:55 2015 UTC,"Actually, we have seen lots of large scale exploration games over the years. Hell, Elite Dangerous is under active development and has many of the same properties and even does a fair amount of procedural generation (the recent newsletter commenting on the real world pictures of Pluto touches on this). Greater emphasis on combat, but exploration is still a huge part and may become a bigger one in future updates (I'll believe it when I see it).  Or, you know, every single minecraft clone.  But it is like I say every time this pops up: Show me a vertical slice of gameplay. As of late, the NMS devs have finally started to do that, but it is still a very small subset of the vertical slice (no sense of progression and still primarily exploration with no real details on the enemy ships and guardians that have been ""teased"").  Going by the Souls example: Generally the trailers/demos show only glimpses of fights and one or two bosses, and generally those are actually tweaked anyway. Hell, the Dark 2 demo, for all the flaws that game had, was pretty much perfect as you got to try out all the new mechanics:   Revamped magic/miracle/whatever system Heavy emphasis on dual wielding and power stances New healing mechanics   And it ALSO hid concepts such as hexes (I think) and pyromancy (which was actually kind of plot related as to whether it would be in)."
Games,3dmxr4,Gundato,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:08:55 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to say NMS is doing something no one has done/attempted before because I have not played every video game ever, but I think it's safe to say it has to be doing something really unique or else it wouldn't have received the attention it has: the procedurally generated worlds making sense (as opposed to Spore) is such an exciting promise.   I don't think Elite nor Minecraft are ""exploration"" games; it's part of the sandbox gameplay, but it never was the focus. Yet NMS gave me the impression that all this space stuff was built around the act of exploring this computer generated universe. I can't imagine anyone not doing exploration and play as space trader for the whole game, simply because if you're into sandbox games, there are games with more robust systems out there.  But I understand your concern about the vertical slice part. It's easy to be cynical when we're being hyped not about the actual game but the POTENTIAL of it. I often feel like I'm one of the very few people who are expecting a Proteus-like game and are perfectly content with it."
Games,3dmxr4,ChaosDent,0,Sat Jul 18 13:17:19 2015 UTC,"I think it's safe to say it has to be doing something really unique or else it wouldn't have received the attention it has: the procedurally generated worlds making sense (as opposed to Spore) is such an exciting promise.   Not really. It is all about timing and marketing. Case in point: People credit Halo with the infantry/vehicle hybrid FPS. Or Valve in general who haven't ever really had an ""original"" idea, but are so good at market analysis and polish that they pretty much have the quintessential game in a BUNCH of genres.  Or look at Elite Dangerous VS Star Citizen. As of now, both do basically the same thing (Elite actually does a LOT more, but... yeah) with the former costing a lot less (but still having microtransactions, heh). But I would argue most gamers don't know what Elite Dangerous IS, whereas EVERYONE knows what Star Citizen is and views that as THE space game. And Elite is the pseudo-sequel to the game that started that genre (and NMS's, heh)  In terms of timing: This is a game that seems like it is REALLY technically taxing (it isn't) that was announced at the start of the current generation.  In terms of hype: Sony have pushed this VERY heavily in pretty much all their major public press conferences.  But yeah, if the devs would just say ""This is only about exploration"", I would have no problems with it: Not my cup of tea, but I would probably grab it in a bundle or steam sale.  But every time they discuss it they hype up the ""you are trying to reach the center"" and hint at stuff like the combat (which, correct me if I am wrong, we have yet to see any sign of AI. Either combat is avoided or the enemy barely reacts to getting shot) and progression. Neither of which they show.  If the devs insist on constantly talking about the stuff that isn't there, that is alarming. Because, let's be honest: The pseudo-vertical slice they showed over the past month didn't actually show us anything that wasn't in the original teaser, it just showed that it isn't entirely pre-rendered."

And yeah, in a universe this size there will be repetition which you might get sick of.  BUT  This game in my opinion looks awesome!  I used to play a lot of Minecraft which started with infdev and still pick it up from time to time and obviously there's a lot of parallels.  I'm 33 with a busy job and not many hours to sink in to games, and these types of games really appeal to me.  Whilst it has action elements, for me these games are more of a meditation. I can pick them up, wander round for an hour or so, make some small progress, marvel at some of the sites, and just chill out.  This will be the game I buy a PS4 for and am thoroughly looking forward to cracking open a beer after work, derping around in space, exploring planets, and just relaxing.  There is definitely a market for these types of games. Again, look to Minecraft and its myriad clones.   For me games are about escapism and this ticks that box pretty hard."

It seems like they are heavily investing into marketing to try to build up hype for a game they know will not do well in the long run.   The game just doesn't look very fun or interesting. But they sure do try to sound excited about it. In some of the previous videos the people at IGN went ape shit over the ship taking off and I'm thinking ""wow you're making a big deal out of a ship taking off? this game must suck""  It just looks like all fluff and no actual solid gameplay.  I will certainly give the game a shot as I like exploration games but no way I'm preordering this. I want to see streams and reviews before I purchase it."

Games,3dmxr4,teaminus,2,Sat Jul 18 15:09:29 2015 UTC,"Actually coverage is determined by Hello Games' press cycle which has always been every 6 months or so and usually includes a major event, gameplay videos, and exclusive extended coverage by a major gaming outlet. They try to limit press in between so they can focus on the game but every six months coverage is the opposite of sparse.  December 2013: VGX reveal of the game. 1 gameplay trailer. Extensive coverage in the media including interviews but no exclusive extended coverage.  Rest of cycle: Articles mostly about the flood, some about the game, an appearance or two at conferences by team members, but HG is mostly dark recovering from the flood, getting the game back on track, and readying for E3. Interesting here to note that Sony offers to help them after the flood, probably with a lucrative deal, but instead HG just asks for promotion, which is why at E3...  June 2014: Sean presents the game on stage at Sony's E3 conference. The first time Sony has done this for an indie game. 2 gameplay trailers (+ some extra leftover footage from making the trailers) and a behind the scenes video about HG from Sony. Gamespot has exclusive extended coverage with 4 videos. Numerous articles with interviews with Sean.  Rest of cycle: A few articles with mostly rehash, an appearance or two by team members, but mostly dark and working on the game for...  December 2014: PSX in Las Vegas where Sean presents on stage. The next night a special concert called A Night Under No Man's Sky with 65daysofstatic, Sean's favorite band and the music in the trailers and the procedural soundtrack for the game, for PSX attendees and those of us who watched online. Video interviews Sean, 2 gameplay trailers, and numerous articles. Game Informer gets exclusive extended coverage with numerous articles and videos.  Rest of cycle: A few articles, The New Yorker article is especially good but mostly rehash, an appearance or two by team members, but mostly dark until...  June 2015: E3 2015 Sean demos the game at Sony E3 conference. 1 gameplay video + extra footage. Also appears at PCGaming conference and announces simultaneous (later says ""as close as possible"") PC & PS4 release. Release date announced soon™. Numerous articles and interviews. IGN gets exclusive extended coverage and here we are!  So not ""sparse"" just only every 6 months or so when they do press!"
Games,3dmxr4,Orestes910,1 point,Sat Jul 18 11:10:49 2015 UTC,"Hey, great post. There's just one thing that stood out to me.   June 2014: Sean presents the game on stage at Sony's E3 conference. The first time Sony has done this for an indie game.   If you mean that they presented one at E3 specifically, then it's possible NMS was the first. But Sony's push for indie games to be in the spotlight started a while before that. They showed the trailer for The Witness on stage at Playstation Experience in February of 2013."
Games,3dmxr4,fgdncso,1 point,Sat Jul 18 09:26:17 2015 UTC,That's what they said so I assume they meant the developer actually presenting the game on stage in person.
Games,3dmxr4,DirtbagDaryl,-10,Fri Jul 17 16:48:10 2015 UTC,"You and I have very different definitions of the word sparse. I've no desire to collect the countless interviews, trailers, and gameplay clips, so I'll just take my down votes and go."
Games,3dmxr4,Plexicraft,3,Sat Jul 18 04:15:39 2015 UTC,"I didn't downvote you and I'm not sure why anyone else would... anyway: VGX 2013, e3 2014, Playstation Experience (2014?), Gamespot month long coverage, NY times piece, e3 2015 and finally IGN first. These are really the only times the game has been covered in a direct way (interactions with Hello Games, new footage, etc.). Seven times is not that many for a game announced more than a year and a half ago. I do agree that they should have announced it later than they did, but Sean Murray got a chance to showcase the game on VGX and he took it. Hopefully at the end of IGN first they'll finally announce a release date."

Games,3dmxr4,brlito,0,Sat Jul 18 07:29:35 2015 UTC,I hate being so cynical but I'm with you. This looks like it will be another ocean with the depth of a puddle. I can't for the life of me figure out why everyone is losing their mind's over it and grabbing up every new piece of info possible. Is this what's exciting in gaming these days? I feel like this is an indie game that will be compared to AAA stuff like Skyrim and fall short with a lack of depth. To each their own I guess.
Games,3dmxr4,Renegade_Meister,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:25:46 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is an indie game that will be compared to AAA stuff like Skyrim and fall short with a lack of depth.   Yup. Expect mixed reviews from people who loved the exploration or gave it extra points for creativity in generating everything with an algorithm, and lower scores from people who get bored of doing the same five things in slightly varying ways. I'm personally very excited for the game because I love the aesthetic and exploring unexpected/procedural worlds, but I think it's a mistake to be pre-emptively hyping it up so much."
Games,3dmxr4,thoomfish,-7,Fri Jul 17 18:33:48 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty boring, plus not a big fan of this multitool that collects resources Ratchet & Clank style.  I'm still waiting for a demo though, I really want to experience this game first-hand before judging."
Games,3dmxr4,Glass_Leg,5,Fri Jul 17 20:55:06 2015 UTC,"Looks pretty boring   When you look at slow pan non-action clips where gameplay isn't actually shown, I can understand how it could seem like that.  Open universe space games aren't for everyone, as it requires an inherent interest in exploring planets, solar systems, or space stations as well as an interest in resource mining, pirating, spaceship warfare, or trading.  For those people who don't have that interest, they'd be better suited for a game centered around space combat.  I will say though that this game seems to has a better shot at being more engaging & appealing to more people than the procedurally generated space trucking MMO called Elite: Dangerous."
Games,3dmxr4,bvilleneuve,8,Sat Jul 18 11:19:45 2015 UTC,"When you look at slow pan non-action clips where gameplay isn't actually shown,   Every clip we've seen of the combat shows the weapons autoaiming to a ludicrous degree and not having any feeling of weight or impact to them. My hope is that it will be possible to get through the game with a minimum of fighting, because the fighting looks dreadful."

This is implying that he doesn't want that type of game and taking the argument of ""you just don't understand it"".

Games,3dmxr4,theampersandrew,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:57:32 2015 UTC,"It's certainly much more beautiful than Elite: Dangerous. I'd probably dig Elite if it was simplified and if it looked cooler, and that seems to be exactly what No Man's Sky is offering."

Its totally possible that the trailers don't do its ship-to-planet views justice - Its just tough to tell given the pastel-ish nature of most of NMS' procedural color schemes for planets."

Games,3dn0pn,azknight,38,Fri Jul 17 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"When I was a kid, I fully completed nearly every game I owned, mostly because I only received new games for holiday. Now, as an adult with a steady income, combined with more opportunities to get games on the cheap, I find that I am much more likely to play a game for a few hours and set it aside for something else. It's not that I don't enjoy these games, but rather I just lose interest at a faster rate, and feel that there's no huge loss if I don't return to a game I spent $5 on.  However, for the first time in a while, not only did I fully complete a title that wasn't a 2-3 hour indie, but it was Persona 3, one of the longest games I've ever played. I really haven't been able to pinpoint why, but there is something about that game that just dragged me in, kept me entertained throughout, and gave me a genuine feeling of accomplishment upon completion (something I feel that modern games have difficulty with).   Have you guys recently played ""that game"" that drags you back in and brings back the same feelings as when you were younger (especially the proud, accomplished feeling of beating it)? What did it do differently that allowed it to hold your attention."
Games,3dn0pn,ReeG,20,Fri Jul 17 20:26:46 2015 UTC,"The Witcher 3 is definitely that game that brings me back to the days of getting extremely sucked into a single game like I did when I was younger. Like you I'm older and I tend to buy a lot of games on sale that I hop back and forth between and may or may not finish but The Witcher 3 is the first game in years to completely consume my attention.   I think the difference TW3 has from other similar games is the thought and care put into making everything interesting. Next to nothing comes off as filler just to extend playtime around the main story the way it does in games like Skyrim or DA:I. Every quest and objective is filled with memorable characters, dialog and moments that keep me hooked."
Games,3dn0pn,azknight,5,Fri Jul 17 16:50:13 2015 UTC,"I really want to get The Witcher 3, but I don't have a next-gen console yet and I'm pretty sure my computer would explode trying to run it.

The series is pretty good so far, but I totally agree with the jankiness comment of Witcher 1, if it's not fun at all, I'd suggest just skipping to the 2nd game, they clean up quite a bit in the combat department."

If I felt that the game was not worth it, I'd refund. I kept a few games yet to be played and refunded others. I started to look at my backlog and just tried Dishonored. Damn, I already finished the game and the DLC. Also, I did DLC on low and high chaos. I'm not sure what exactly dragged me to the game, I'm not really into FPS but I like stealth games. I guess it's just an awesome game and with more options, we're more demanding for good games."
Games,3dn0pn,T3hSwagman,11,Sat Jul 18 01:57:57 2015 UTC,"The games that do that for me now are Dark Souls. I love trying out every build, nearly every weapon and just make sure I check every last dark corner and crevice of the world.

Games,3dn0pn,dispellado,4,Fri Jul 17 17:38:11 2015 UTC,"Well, I just stopped buying every game that came out or was discounted. The discounts will come back or be even better in the future especially if it is on Steam. Try to be a bit more discerning in what games you purchase since your time is more limited. That's how I have handled it and it is a pretty good system. I tend to finish my games."
Games,3dn0pn,Alinosburns,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:12 2015 UTC,"Well it depends whether or not your goal is to finish the games or to have fun.  I can think of a couple of games that I dropped solely because the only difference between where I was at and the end was going to be repetition of the same stuff. Story wasn't gripping me so there was little reason to move forward.    I do think avoiding over indulging on the discounts is still wise don't get me wrong. Because otherwise you can end up with the wall of games and you never start anything because it's daunting.    Also depends what you term finished, Did you finish Arkham Knight because you made it through the story, or because you got every riddler trophy and saw the 5 extra seconds of footage.  Because kid me, That fucker he got ever statue in all the Spyro games, That fucker would have loved the collectathons that exist today, if only because they would have added another afternoons play."

Games,3dn0pn,peanutmanak47,6,Fri Jul 17 16:32:13 2015 UTC,That's what is one of the most important things about being good at this game.  You have to be in the right position.

The ending was emotionally satisfying but doesn't seem to make much sense when thinking critically about it. I'd recommend this to anybody who hasn't tried it yet.  I recently bought a Gamecube after giving mine away and started playing Gladius. God I loved this game when I was younger and would be extremely happy if they ever released a polished sequel but that seems highly unluckily now.  I tried looking for Pokemon Colosseum on craigslist and at all the local game stores but I've had no luck - the prices online seem ludicrous so I guess I'll have to keep looking or wait for someone to list theirs :(.  edit: Forgot to ask if anybody had recommendations for other gamecube games (Already have Melee).

In the United States, Mexico, Australia, Argentina, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Pacific Island nations, and English-speaking Canada, the dollar or peso symbol precedes the number, unlike most currency symbols. Five dollars or pesos is written and printed as $5, whereas five cents is written as 5¢. In French-speaking Canada, the dollar symbol usually appears after the number (5$), although it sometimes appears in front of it, or instead may even be totally absent.   A country even once put their dollar symbol in the middle of the number/total."

Maybe I just suck at it real bad but I keep getting absolutely annihilated by bandits and such. I'm level 18 and I still can't get through a certain group of bandits on the quest to find Quina in the Witchwood (failed it now, I progressed ahead too far). It seems like the bandits increased 20 levels in the 50 feet between them and the last group which I slaughter. This problem arises in quite a few sections of the game (at least as far as I am)- like while trying to find the grimoire for that dude in Gran Soren. The bandits in both sections get REALLY good after a while. It doesn't help that there's no recommended level on the quest log as far as I can tell.  I like what I can actually get through, climbing huge beasts is great and satisfying but getting to the next fun segment seems like a slog sometimes.

Games,3dn0pn,Yserbius,5,Fri Jul 17 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"Can I just give a shoutout to the Close Combat series?   This is a series that started when hard-core wargames were mainstream and game stores were full of them. In the past decade or so, most wargames have been delegated to a niche. Matrix Games/Slitherine has picked up on it and really ran with the ball, developing series after series of low-graphic high-technicality, yet high priced, games to cater to their audience. For reference this game currently costs 80 bucks, came out last year and is never on sale.    Now where does that leave Close Combat? When it first came out in the 90s, it was published by Microsoft and sometimes touted as a Command and Conquer killer. It was a AAA game and had ads and reviews in all the major magazines. Years past and MS was no longer interested in the series so the rights went to Matrix. They knew their audience and did what few other developers can do. They continued developing the series while keeping the mechanics, gameplay and graphics identical to the original. How many of your favorite series have been ruined by adding an unnecessary third dimension? Or by focusing on multiplayer? Or removing major gameplay elements? Now how many series do you know that you loved in the 90s and the current iterations are identical, except for added better features? I can think of two: Civilization and Close Combat."
Games,3dn0pn,Glimmerglaze,4,Fri Jul 17 17:05:54 2015 UTC,Civilization is almost the poster child of a long-running series that constantly re-invents itself. You sure that's a good example?

Games,3dn0pn,NeoShweaty,2,Fri Jul 17 18:48:35 2015 UTC,"I can see that.

Is it Earth a million years in the future? Why is everything so...off, different, weird, etc? I think the second book is much, much better because you get a sense of why Roland is doing what he's doing and they introduce other characters to stand in for the reader and ask questions that we need to know. I should say other than Jake. I didn't like his character in the first book."
Games,3dn0pn,puppymehard,2,Fri Jul 17 18:17:27 2015 UTC,"King is definitely one of my favorite authors. As for what I'd call essential Stephen King, I'd go with The Shining, IT (which you've already read), Salem's Lot, and The Stand, if only because these are probably his most popular books. They're also all fantastic.  But I've yet to read a King book that I thought was bad, and I've gone through at least 15 (not counting the Dark Tower series). My least favorites thus far have been Cell and Insomnia.  As for a recommendation that hasn't been mentioned yet, check out Misery. It's quite an entertaining read. The elevator pitch is that a famous author gets in a horrible accident and is found and treated by his biggest fan ever.  P.S. If you finish The Shining and want more, check out the sequel. It wasn't at all what I was expecting from a sequel to The Shining, but it was still quite good."
Games,3dn0pn,brandonw00,12,Fri Jul 17 18:22:26 2015 UTC,"I'm so tired of the Arkham Knight PC debacle. I put together a great gaming PC this summer (Core i5-4690K OC'ed to 4.2 GHz and a GTX 980) specifically for Arkham Knight. The Arkham series is one of my favorites, so I wanted to be able to play the best version of the game on the highest settings.   I switched to PC gaming from consoles five years ago. While I love PC gaming, I am so tired of big publishers treating their PC ports like shit. They just put out a half assed version of the game because they know people will buy it. Good on Valve to introduce the refund policy. Maybe this will make some publishers put extra money into their PC ports. My guess though is that you'll see less games get ported to PC because of the risk of losing money from refunds.   I know more often than not, the PC version of a game is fine. It is the big name ones that really stand out, but you would think the big companies would have money to throw at a good PC port of their game.   Here is where I should say ""I'm never buying the PC version of a WB game ever again,"" but I can't make that promise. I love video games too much to not put up a restriction like that. I will not purchase a WB game on the first day it is out, but if after a week or so people say the new Mad Max game is a good port and is a good game, I'll consider getting it."
Games,3dn0pn,Dante18,3,Fri Jul 17 23:22:16 2015 UTC,I think that soon developers are going to put more work on PC ports for games because of the introduction to the steam machine.

Hopefully developers realize that PC is catching up to consoles now.
Games,3dn0pn,brandonw00,4,Fri Jul 17 17:38:33 2015 UTC,"As much as I want the Steam machine to succeed, I don't think it will put that much of a dent into the console market. Console gamers are weary of PC gaming. Even with the appeal of cheaper games, free online play, better graphics, the ability to play with the same controllers as the consoles (I use a Xbox One controller for almost every game on my PC) and even more media features than their current machines, the comfort of a familiar system is much more appealing than something unfamiliar."
Games,3dn0pn,Dante18,2,Fri Jul 17 17:52:09 2015 UTC,I guess your right although its a shame. I think the steam machine is an amazing idea and if executed correctly can be an amazing success.

Games,3dn0pn,magmasafe,3,Fri Jul 17 19:54:47 2015 UTC,Evangelion is referenced a lot more in pop culture. Full Metal Panic is mostly just a high school comedy that kinda features mechs now and again.

Games,3dn0pn,yumcake,2,Fri Jul 17 18:16:51 2015 UTC,"Evangelion isn't one of the best animes, but it is definitely a cultural touchstone that you'd want to cover if you want to feel versed in the subject.

I'm enjoying it a lot, in fact it's really the only currently running show that I'm watching week to week, but the first season was just so fantastic I don't know how they would have met expectations with season 2.   I'm just taking it for what it is and I'm still hooked. I'm just looking for questions to start getting answered and hoping they finish strong. It's a larger cast of major characters than the first season, and I think that's why it's felt like it's been slower going so far, but I think there's the potential to build to a really great payoff."

For me it all went wrong with the casting of the characters. Watching Vince Vaughn always play the goof or hilarious persona, its hard for me to separate all his past roles and now see him in a very serious role.   Besides that, maybe its that every character is the same in that they all seemed fucked up and I can't relate to any of them, but i don't know. Guess I am just disappointed but I wish I could be excited for new episodes like season 1 because season one had some amazing cinematography! Just my 2 cents"
Games,3dn0pn,trilogique,3,Fri Jul 17 16:42:01 2015 UTC,"I don't see it. Horrifically? Come on, that's overkill. You really think it's that bad? It's certainly not mindblowing, but to say they fucked up horrifically feels like an exaggeration. And that's honestly how I feel most of the hate this season gets is. People read the initial reviews, those opinions spread and people have had that on their mind since the pilot. I hope next season they don't send out review episodes and let everyone judge it on their own, rather than be predisposed to disliking it by critic reviews.  Not to mention the continuous comparisons to season one as if every season needs to have a dynamic between a nihilistic pseudo-intellectual spouting off philosophy and a grounded, everyday family man. I loved those two characters in tandem with each other - it was an excellent twist on the buddy cop genre. But it's not how every season needs to play out and I'm glad that even if this season fails, they didn't try to recapture the magic of Rust and Marty.   I dunno, maybe I'm not being fair to you or other detractors. I certainly agree with some of the criticisms of the plot being unnecessarily convoluted, the rocky pacing, the characters being hit or miss and the spotty acting now and then, but to me I just don't see how this season is a horrific fuck-up. The way people are criticizing this season you'd think it was CSI or something, which it clearly isn't. I'd never rank it up there with Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones or whatever, but it's solid. Maybe it just hits all the right notes for me and not others."

I have never played a Total War game before but this one has me really excited. When I was younger I played a lot of Age of Empires, Warcraft and Command and Conquer through the entire series (except C&C, ain't noone got time for that no more) and love them. I also played console games with my favorites being MGS, Final Fanasty and most recently Mass Effect.  And one of my most recently loved games, Divinity Original Sin, that I never thought would be a game I would like but the trailers, dev walkthroughs and pre release let's plays got me hyped enough to pre purchase. I was entranced in a slow paced game that required me to take the time to read everything, make slow but precise tactical decisions and get immersed in it's lore enough to almost 100% the achievements. This is a game type that I thought I would never like and I absolutely loved it, now I am half way through Pillars of Eternity, purchased Wasteland 2, finished both Shadowruns and am anticipating Tides of Numenera and Sword Coast Legends. So I was wrong.  Now enter Total War. You can see that I love story driven games, RPG's, strategy and a certain amount of sci-fi/fantasy setting and for that very reason (even if I am uninformed) Total War never clicked with me enough to take the dive because I saw no story driven gameplay, it wasn't far enough from reality for me and most of all the gameplay seemed incredibly slow in comparison to most games even though it was very tactical. The price here (New Zealand) for the games have always been somewhat high too which makes taking a dive on a game I am not sure on even harder not to mention the general consensus is swayed on the more recent games and it's hard to pick just one to try and have missed out on an entire franchise because I tried the one game that didn't resonate with me.  But Total WarHammer looks like it could really do just that. So here are, finally, the main questions. Does this game, to the masses, look like it will be a flop being a licensed GW game? are there favored developers of the Total War games and do they often swap per releases or is this a new dev team altogether while being branded as the same? are there any fantasy and story driven Total War games up till this point or is this one the furtherest from reality so far? how much do the more popular games cost in your region and what is a good price on discount normally?

I played the beginning of the DS version before realising that I should probably play the PC version, lest I have the entire experience ruined.  You're right, it's like they ported it without thinking that maybe they should redo the visuals, or compress the sound a bit better, or fix some of the many, many bugs. The real kick in the teeth is the addition of features that are useless - the notepad that's like a typewriter; if you make a mistake, you have to backspace through everything you've written.

They kept saying over many years that no company would put up the money for the game even though they tried, so this deal with Kickstarter funds for development, Sony paying for marketing/the PS4 port and 'traditional sources of funding' (investors and/or loans probably) seems to be the only chance, though some people dislike it."

There's a wide variety of classes and weapons: there's a dino-tank, a suicide-bombing dinosaur, a flying dinosaur ; a rocket launcher, flamethrower, shotgun, semi-auto rifle, snipers... Each class has its own weapon, speed, accuracy, stamina and some have special skills that can be activated so they all play differently. There's a lot of strategy when it comes to class selection, for example if the Nazis use a lot of flying dinosaurs, then you should play as the flamethrower-guy because he's the most effective against them.  I like that you can respawn quickly and the maps are small but very well designed. There's always a lot of action with no downtime.  The game has a lot of personality: there are fake news report of the war against dinosaurs, fake newspapers articles during loading times and each character has its own lines of dialogues. They're small but important details.  My only complaint is the time-to-kill, which is very low (you can die in 2 bullets of a semi-auto rifle), and the low number of official maps (I think there are 5)."
Games,3dtmyd,balne,49,Sun Jul 19 09:58:28 2015 UTC,"You picked maybe one of the weirdest examples you possibly could have for a discussion about grinding. There is pretty much no grinding whatsoever in Fallout 3. The only thing you could really compare to grinding would be purposefully power leveling by cycling through camps where enemies respawn or using glitches. And if you were going to cheat why not just open the console and type ""rewardxp 1000"" repeatedly. Why you would want to powerlevel in FO3 though I have no clue, seems like a good way to ruin the experience."
Games,3dtmyd,10GuyIsDrunk,13,Sun Jul 19 11:16:14 2015 UTC,I was wondering that myself. The Fallout series in general requires next to no grinding; you level dynamically as you play the game. You get small amounts of XP from kills compared to completing quests so completing quests is the best way to level; that's not grinding.  Honestly I don't even think about levelling very often in Fallout; after the first couple of levels it just happens. A nice surprise after a quest or killing something.  I think OP thinks grinding just means levelling in general?

Games,3dtmyd,illredditlater,4,Sun Jul 19 14:09:11 2015 UTC,"No, there aren't. What OP said doesn't make sense.   a game which i think does grinding really well is Fallout 3- it introduces new and unique items in a way that is interesting and pretty non-repetitive.   As in, going over to where they are and picking them up. Unsure how this is grinding in even the smallest way. And I'm not saying this to ""defend"" FO3 or something, I don't personally have any problem with grinding, I'm just pointing out that it doesn't make sense. I don't think OP knows what grinding is or has a very odd personal definition of the word."
Games,3dtmyd,10GuyIsDrunk,8,Sun Jul 19 14:23:07 2015 UTC,"It's become a bigger deal to me the older I've gotten, to the point where I usually outright refuse to play games that require any significant amount of grind. My time didn't mean shit to me when I was a kid but now I value it a lot more and try to maximize my spare time and gaming time as a result. It's the same basic reason behind why I'm so sick of open world games. Both mostly seem like padding/filler to me and my time is worth more than that. Gaming shouldn't feel like a chore, nor does it have to. Lost Odyssey, to pick one example out of a hat, was an excellent JRPG in a genre notorious for grinding that not only wasn't much of a grind but actually got to the point where you couldn't realistically grind much because it capped your XP against enemies/XP able to be earned in that area (I forget which) and kept pushing you forward. I liked that a lot."

It's a fun game and I still come back whenever they release a huge update to do a few runs with friends and I really enjoy those moments but it doesn't take long until we all get bored of the game and go back to other games.  It's not a problem of having to put too much effort into the game to get what we want, it's not knowing if we're actually making any progress at all since every Prime that has been recently introduced always has one or more parts that have a 1-5% droprate.  You could play a mission once and get it easily or play it a thousands of time and never see it, there is no control over your progression. At best you can sell other parts you got and buy the one you're missing but haggling and trading directly with players isn't fun for all players."
Games,3dtmyd,MelonMelon28,1 point,Sun Jul 19 11:08:39 2015 UTC,"Grinding shouldn't exist, the word shouldn't have a place in gaming discussion. Isn't ""grinding"" just playing the game the way it was intended to be played? The destination can be a great reward but the journey there doesn't have to be an awful experience. If a game's regular gameplay can be considered grindy, then it's simply a bad game. Once you reach your goal, your unlock or whatever, then what do you do with it? Grind some more for the next unlock? Then what's the point of ever even playing it?  This is all just a personal opinion of course. I understand that there needs to be a timesink, or some work involved with progressing in games, especially those F2P games. The gameplay as you progress though should never feel mundane, tedious, and loathsome."
Games,3dtmyd,wafflesundae,12,Mon Jul 20 06:44:46 2015 UTC,"I think grinding is never good. The word itself already describes a bad mechanic or better it describe a common mechanic used in the wrong way. It is like ""bullet spongey enemies"". Giving big and harder monsters more hp is really common, but ""bullet spongey enemies"" describe a bad balancing. If a player is not going for a very, very, very, very specific build (WF & buriza ama, ranger paladin, windowmaker assassin, etc) he should not need to grind for progress. I think many games although lack a good amount of parallel progression and overlap.   Hero specific loot made it practicly impossible to find awesome mid&high tier weapon for a new character run with a different class or concept.*  On the topic of Warframe i already tried the game 2 times. First in the early beginning and last time this years spring. I gave up, after i did not found the last batches of material for a new helmet after 2-3 days of grinding 3hrs each. Sorry, but i have better things to do. With 9hours grinding of Pindle/Baal-hell i could rund 3-5 new character concepts in Diablo 2 or make a high level char a lot more stronger. In Warframe i got 47 mats of that and 29 nano fibres of this and my default start equipment got +1. o______o   *i.e. PoE has really good progression system, D3 does not and most mmos."

How I imagine game devs discussing this:   ""Our game only takes 30 minutes to finish. That's not nearly worth the price!"" ""Oh I know, let's lower the drop rate of every important item to 0,05%!"" ""Brilliant! Now it'll take them hours to even finish the first quest. And they have 3 whole quests after that!""    Especially in online games this sucks.

Free to play games are meant to be grindy so you spend money on gaining items and levels faster. That's the main reason I don't bother with F2P's much. The feeling that they only make it grindy as hell so you spend money just puts me off. I would rather spend my money on games like Deus Ex and Fallout, a month or two of pure enjoyment without the pain of freemium grind. saying that I'm sure it wont take long for it to creep into single player games as some F2P games make a shit ton of money."
Games,3dtmyd,Redan,1 point,Sun Jul 19 14:26:31 2015 UTC,"It varies based on the game. I think that an accecptable model is the one warframe and gw2 have. You can grind briefly to get perfectly acceptable, and very close to equivalent gear to the best stuff you can get (leveling a single warframe to 30 or getting exotic gear in gw2) but if you want the best, it takes far more effort (time).  Warframes gameplay is unique compared to most MMOs. Where as many have you do less enjoyable things via grinding, in order to access or do better the more enjoyable content, what you do in warframe is the same throughout. With the exception of s high level form of grinding that proves more mediocre than the lower level grinding.  In any case, what warframe does when it adds new content is create items to intentionally give high level players who have all of the weaker, easy to get items something to do. Some of the droprates are a shame, but prices go down and the void is getting reworked and or removed soon anyway."

I reached a pretty decent point in warframe, beyond grinding out mastery for weapons/suits i'd done all there was the only way to 'get better' was to farm towers to get parts to either sell/craft or max out mods, even then the only thing i was increasing was how long i could sustain a tower pushing towards repeated C rotations for the best drops."

Games,3dtmyd,Uptopdownlowguy,2,Tue Jul 21 05:04:04 2015 UTC,"The thing about grinding for me is that as we have more access to various videogames, the less acceptable grinding is for me. Often times, for singleplayer games I used to grind even the most grindy games (Dark Cloud 2 for example) because thats all I had to play. However, if I play a game on steam and it feels grindy, I feel compelled to simply quit out and play something else. Perhaps I'm alone in this, but just my two cents. Games that are grindy that I've managed to see through are guild wars 2 and LoL. Perhaps its the feeling of achieving and obtaining new levels, abilities and champions (also rank) that has kept me grinding, but for me those are the two outliers"
Games,3dtmyd,GameStunts,2,Sun Jul 19 10:54:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like grinding in games is fine as long as you have a sense of progression. I'd like to use Hearthstone as an example here, where you can earn 100 gold per day at most, by winning 30 games. That's a lot of wins for 100 gold and so it feels like a grind, while each win feels pointless since you're only rewarded with 10 gold every third win.   In addition the game has a daily quest system, where you log in every day and get a bigger gold reward for completing the quest. Once that's done, your incentive to keep playing is completely gone outside of having fun.  What I usually like about games is how I'm continuously rewarded for playing, usually by leveling up and unlocking new skills. The so-called ""grind"" becomes less tedious and it feels meaningful to some extent. Can't say that's the case for Hearthstone where playing a few matches ""for fun"" will do my card collection no good."
Games,3dtmyd,Daffan,4,Sun Jul 19 11:43:02 2015 UTC,"(I haven't played Warframe)  Generally it's just a trademark of the model.  People sometimes see Free2play as a free game, or a challenge to see if they can play without ever paying anything. The truth is these companies are giving you access to a game that actively costs them money for servers/admins/developers.   I've always seen the free players (the ones that stick around) as the population of the game. They keep it alive, provide opponents and make the game fun.   Then you have someone like me, who will play a game for hundreds of hours, but has disposable income and is likely to drop a few dollars into a game I like. I don't see it as a challenge to try and play for nothing. But ultimately I'll move on.  For me, I may buy that next weapon, or the XP boost to get to it in 1 hour rather than 10, because I'd like to get there, and my enjoyment with it will be more reward than the 10 hours I would otherwise have lost.  The grind is really there to try and encourage people to drop some money in to pay for the running and development of the game.   If we take your example of Fallout 3. Disregard it's single player. If it was free to play, but they sold in game guns and xp boosts. If I could level up and play the story as I do now, I'd never need to buy a gun or xp boost, because generally the game is fun, rewards exploring, and I'm going to level up for every 1 - 3 hours of gameplay (during which I'm having fun).  So they would have to change the gameplay. You'd need to play for 5-10 hours to get a level, or buy an xp boost. Weapons would be harder to find, and maybe tend to wear out faster, to encourage you to buy weapons. And maybe fast travel would be something that was sold as a 10 pack for a $1 or something, since I could be in the middle of DC, decide I want to offload my inventory (which I've paid $5 for an extra 50 weight capacity btw) I just fast travel to Megaton and sell all the stuff, then fast travel back to DC with zero inconvinience. The free players could loot the same place in DC as me, but they'd have to fight their way out to get back to megaton, maybe 30-40 minutes work.  Ultimately you'd end up probably spending the same on the game as if you'd bought it, but in smaller chunks.  Fuck knows what my original point was now, but in general I'd say if it's free2play you can expect to work for your rewards. Props to games like Smite which offer an all in one one-time purchase of all their content, wish more free2play models would acknowledge some people don't want to be nickle and dimed forever more.  Suitably bored/confused? I end my rambling here.  TL:DR Free2play's model makes it's money by making it inconvinient/lengthy to get ""that next thing"" so that people with disposable income and less time help pay for the game."

Games,3dtmyd,Hapistoric,2,Tue Jul 21 05:05:10 2015 UTC,"Grinding is totally acceptable as long as it's fun grinding.   If everything was handed to you instantly, or after 1 monster kill in an MMORPG. There would be no player retention.  However, asking players to grind a monster that requires no effort, skill or fun to beat is bad.  Two examples i can think of.   Elite Dangerous has a bad case of grinding. The enemies are ridiculously easy, and you need to kill 6700 of them to hit max combat rating. You legit just fly in, target the enemy and hold down the trigger and they explode - now repeat this 6700 times.  On the other end of the spectrum, WoW started hating/removing on difficulty / grinding for the average player and many people can finish the game (LFR for them) very easily - prompting way less player retention as the game is completed faster - I know many friends who quit after beating the raid on LFR in 1 1 day - as they felt it was ""over"" for them.  Without grinding (It doesn't have to be killing monsters over and over to be grinding), you'd have to hand craft content out the wazoo (Imagine having pure quests to level in Runescape, you'd need thousands) and it's just not feasible for a lot of games - or have some insane sandbox design."
Games,3dtmyd,dagla,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:09:44 2015 UTC,"The basic idea of grinding is doing things again and again for minimal or low probability gain. Leaving the explanation as it is leaves a bad taste in your mouth until you get the context of individual games.    I personally did not like the grind in Terraria for endgame <1% drops, but it is understandable if you take into account the sheer amount of enemies you slay throughout it all.  As for my holy scripture called Monster Hunter I recognize that while there are sufficient chances for those <1% drops per quest true RNG can simply screw you over and there is nothing to do but keep grinding.  Grinding itself is not inherently bad, it's just that it is usually associated with monotonous repetitive actions. If you are having fun you are simply less likely to call it a grind."
Games,3dtmyd,2dose,1 point,Sun Jul 19 10:39:22 2015 UTC,"I like grinding for good rewards, when it's worth the time and if it's enjoyable  For example, I used to play Ragnarok and spend hours grinding, killing the same ennemies over and over again, sometimes just to try to get a rare card (each monster could drop a card) that had a 0.001% chance to drop, but the combat was fun, taking a bunch of monsters and killing them all at once was fun, that's all I cared about"
Games,3dtmyd,Chosenwaffle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:01:22 2015 UTC,"Warframe is a loot/grind game, just like Diablo 3 but in third person with ninja combat.  I think you should only play these types of games if you enjoy their gameplay provided by the core combat and movement so much that you could play it excessively. If you don't enjoy it, there is no point, as stuff does take some time to obtain and level until you reach a certain pont with almost endless crafting materials and unlock the levels that give the best XP.  For me Warframe feels like one of the best PC games with precise movement controls (I come from Counterstrike so I expect things happen exactly as I want with my character), really great feedback for shooting, gibs, a lot of variety with 20ish different classes and all the different weapon types. I can kill some enemies solo, or do something hard with a team. Join a random team and race them to slice up the enemy, or help new players do their quests. No matter which mission I pick, I just like the way it plays. I liked it so much I played it for over 1000 hours now, and I still enjoy the grind for the new stuff they put in time to time. In this time I've obtained almost all of the available items, without paying for a single one of them, but supported the devs with some cosmetic purchases. It's been a true F2P experience for me. Also this game has some amazing content update support ever since I started 1.5 2.5 (its been a long grind :D) years ago, I would say they are almost at the Valve-level with that, but with a few more bugs that need hotfixes regularly."
Games,3dtmyd,thoomfish,2,Sun Jul 19 12:05:33 2015 UTC,Grinding has it's place in MMORPGs and ARPG games because that what the game is revolving around. It becomes a challenge and it feels rewarding to finish a raid or kill a boss. Bad implementation of grining is in online pvp games and especially competitive games. It makes playing the game frustrating because you got killed by a guy with a better gun or with a more op character. Games started to abuse the freemium model a lot lately and i think it needs to stop. Instead of making a f2p game where i need to grind for years to unlock content necessary to play the game give it a 20 or even 30$ price tag and make everyone have it all from the start.
Games,3dtmyd,PC-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 12:43:40 2015 UTC,"If you enjoy the grind then its not so bad. For example, a lot of games with good multiplayer are a blast, even though they are grindy (Diablo III, Trove, Borderlands, etc)"

The only series in which grinding works for me is Monster Hunter, because it keeps me consistently challenged and engaged while I'm grinding. By the time a monster isn't a threat to me any more (because of improvements in my knowledge/skill), I've almost certainly got the drops I need already."
Games,3dtmyd,PC-,1 point,Sun Jul 19 19:41:27 2015 UTC,"I think the game does well and the gameplay for the most part makes up for the grind, but I think the grind isn't that bad in that aspect, but I think the problem is that there are too many materials and not enough information on them without looking it up on wikis. That, and the LONG timers really just made me slowly play less and less. Long timers means you have to just do repeatative shit while the game ticks down an artificial timer, or just stop playing the game so it can do what it's trying to do. If the timers were not there or were much shorter it would be fine, I think maximum like 12 hour timer."
Games,3dtmyd,Decoyrobot,2,Sun Jul 19 10:36:17 2015 UTC,"Out of curiosity, what timers? Last time i played Warframe the only timers i saw were ones for crafting/researching items which i couldnt really care about because all the work was done. Its probably the least of the issues WF has to do with time, for the most part you can just farm mats, its just the blueprints and other part drops from towers that leave you at the mercy of RNG."
Games,3dtmyd,PC-,2,Sun Jul 19 14:02:49 2015 UTC,"Basically crafting of anything useful. Weapons, Warframes, warframe parts, sentinels, waiting for Kubrows to grow up, finding a Kubrow egg(not a timer but long as all hell took me a full week, then gave up, came back after a few days, got two in the first ten minutes). That kind of stuff, and the fact that the real money currency is so difficult to get and/or the fact that if you want to collect warframes/weapons/sentinels/anything you need the platinum (is it platinum?)  Either way, the platinum situation if that's even the right name of the currency, it is fine, you can get some eventually but it is really slow and the platinum is too necessary if you want to collect anything.  Edit: And that later on you get these supply mining vessel things.. probes? Anyway, they just were done all wrong, you have to have conquered an entire planet(discovered everything) and then you have to wait something like 8-14 hours to find out if you got like 1/3 of the possible materials from that planet, and then if you don't take the materials out it just stays there and doesn't keep mining. Which if it kept farming then I'd have reason to check back every now and then. Not to mention they can be destroyed or damaged meaning you have to make another one."
Games,3dtmyd,Conyeah,2,Sun Jul 19 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"I've heard kubrows are really bad, the upkeep for them sounded insane so i avoided it at all cost beyond completing the initial introduction quest, after that back in the box it went.  You are right platinum is the paid currency, but in a way im kind of split on the platinum situation, if you out right want plat and buy it its a complete rip off IMO, but if you wait for the daily rewards (i hate those) you can get 50-75% off, which makes it fairly reasonable considering how much time you might dump into WF.   Once you hit a certain point you basically farm tower keys/do runs to get more parts/prints that are basically junk to you to sell to other players so in a way if youre willing to put time in an endure the repetition you can sustain yourself to fund inventory expansions and the rest.   That sort of point though is where i hate grind because during that time you might not be visibly progressing much, weapons/frames to craft but no inventory space to keep them in, needing the plat to buy the slots, etc and to sell whatever weapons you've already crafted can feel like a waste of time due to the time you sunk in to get them initially.   IIRC the longest craft time is ~3 days for a warframe without paying to speed it up. TBH for me i dont really mind that wait because thats it, no more running a void tower endlessly hoping for the final part to drop, no more sitting in trade chat hoping for a good offer, etc. But i can see how some want the instant gratification of getting their reward asap (i think its about 50-75plat to rush?).   With the extractors i wouldnt worry about them theyre just there to offset some of the farming for materials - again pure RNG and low quantities. Personally i dont think clearing the map of a system is that much of a bad thing besides how repetitive the mission types get, but i think theyre working through improving them, last i saw was spy missions being improved on. Clearing a planet is the closest to some form of completion WF has and most missions can be cleaned out in <5-10min leaving you to end up revisiting 1-4 sectors in the future for farming a specific resource over and over and over and over again."

He mentions The Witcher 3, and I think, that you can put GTA V in the same category. Rockstar have given away every single part of the updates (with new clothes, cars, weapons and so on) for free since the game released for Xbox 360 and PS3, and they continue doing so. I haven't played the game for some months, but knowing that there will be a bunch of new stuff to play with makes me happy. And it keeps the player base intact. They chose to sell ingame money in order to make due for the free content, and they will without a doubt charge me for story-based DLC in the future. It's a great combination however."

Games,3dl8ug,kochpittet,25,Fri Jul 17 16:43:40 2015 UTC,"I like his point most about multiplayer DLC like Call of Duty. Charging for maps is ridiculous because you inherently lower the value of those maps since not every player has access to them and therefore you'll only ever get to play with a subset of the audience --- even among your own friends, since now they'll all need to buy the map packs too so you can all keep playing together.  Map packs should be free, cosmetic stuff should cost money, story-based stuff can cost money and that's fine by me if it's worth the price. Sounds like this Batgirl stuff just plain isn't worth the price and would be better positioned as a ""taste"" for players -- an incentive to stick around, keep your copy, buy the more substantial DLC coming down the pipeline.  I swear, the short-term greed some companies display that actually cheats them out of money in the long-term is baffling."

I don't think they always make the smartest business decisions, but I think your comment is a bit polarizing. As gamers, we will high-five and throw money at the developers when they give us good DLC and cry out for blood against the ones who don't. At the end of the day, both  companies exist for the purpose of making money, some just do it better."
Games,3dl8ug,momuse888,2,Fri Jul 17 23:45:50 2015 UTC,I agree. I think the problem that is focused shouldn't be if they charge money. DLC isn't any more free to make than the base game was. If we want more games they have to make money somehow. All that matters is if its worth it. Some dlc by nature won't be worth the price but we shouldn't ask for more free dlc jut because someone didn't hold up to standards. We should just not buy that dlc. Of course I wouldn't turn down free updates and they are great when they happen but I don't want hardworking devs to be expected to always do it either.
Games,3dl8ug,Try_Another_Please,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:26:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but to me, the only reason to charge for something like map packs is short-term greed — ""We have to charge for them to guarantee we get the money from it."" I totally understand that mindset (it costs lots of money to make maps) but you have to play the long game when it comes to multiplayer. Give away free content to keep people coming in, expand your player base, and charge for smaller things that people can live without but people who really like the game will want to buy a lot of.  It always bums me out when a game I like gets a paid map pack because now they've gone and fragmented the player base. There's no good scenario there. If I buy the map packs, there's a small subset of people who will have them, so I don't get the benefit of the large community I had before; not to mention that my friends need to buy them too else we can't play the new maps together (which means I'm not playing the maps I bought). If I don't buy the map packs, the player base for the base game is lower as well because now some people will have flocked to the new maps, that's where the attention for the developers will go, and now I feel like I'm playing the old shit while everyone else is off playing the new shit.  It just doesn't make any sense — unless they don't want to build an online community and would rather just cash in early. But at that point, just don't make a multiplayer game.  It's like charging for fighting game characters. It's ridiculous. Now not everybody has them and you've upset the balance of the game, thereby making the entire game less valuable. That's why at tournaments like EVO they ban all characters but the ones in the base game. Like, yes, making new characters is extremely expensive and you need to guarantee you'll get your money back, but make it back by building a thriving community of satisfied customers willing to pay for incidental stuff that will enhance their experience a little bit rather than the big stuff that fragments your game and hurts it for everybody."

The combat and predator stuff felt kind of weak in this one too — way too many options for how to take guys down to the point where I ended up just going for speed over creativity, something I've never done in this series.  Pros: It's still a Rocksteady Batman game, and it's still fantastic. I've seen a lot of complaints about the story, but I liked it a lot, actually; it felt very personal and very high-stakes. The Batmobile was fun for chases and getting around the city. Gorgeous game. They do some really really smart but subtle changes in how you traverse as Batman.  I got platinum trophies in Asylum and City, but didn't even finish all the side story content in Origins. Knight is somewhere in between. I might platinum it eventually, but I don't feel nearly as passionate about it because so much of it is such a grind. Still, it's definitely worth playing if you're a fan of the series."

If you have 100 players and 30 of them buy the map pack and want to play on the new maps, then the player pool for everyone else just shrunk by 30%.

Games,3dl8ug,kochpittet,8,Fri Jul 17 14:50:28 2015 UTC,"But its buying power. I don't get why shark cards get a free pass when in Dead Space 3 there was a completely optional microtransactions to buy more materials now so you could get better armor, weapons faster. That was a singleplayer game with co-op and people fucking lost their minds and accused EA of gimping resource rates (even though it wasn't true and there was a glitch resources would come back if you exited the game and come back in and EA knew about it and kept it) and resources were plentiful.  When Rockstar does it any asshat can buy the best cars and win races easily or complete missions buy themselves because they have the armored car. Its legit buying power like shitty mobile apps and korean MMO's."
Games,3dl8ug,payne6,3,Fri Jul 17 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"I'm fine with being able to buy resources, but the grind in GTA V is ridiculous and the balance is all out of whack so that extra cash can give you a huge advantage.  1.5 million gets you a tank, the armored car is a troll's best friend, and the assault shotgun is ridiculously OP to name a few of the more glaring problems."
Games,3dl8ug,TheWinslow,2,Fri Jul 17 17:15:42 2015 UTC,Season passes also stop some people from buying the game too. I love the arkham series but knowing that their is a 40 dollar season pass  doesn't make me want to buy the game knowing that their will be a complete or Goty edition thats goung to have all the dlc. Why should I buy something when it feels like you are telling me im not getting a finished product

Games,3dl8ug,lazy-shell,37,Fri Jul 17 14:45:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but its doing the same thing OP suggested. My point wasn't that it's DLC, it's that it's content that extends gameplay.   And not for nothing, but it's confirmed that they will eventually put out free DLC once on disk content is used up."
Games,3dl8ug,chipyip,6,Fri Jul 17 12:41:43 2015 UTC,"Does it really matter if it's on disc or on server? The content is made before you play it. They're not charging you for it, so all they're doing is saving you the time of a download.  All sorts of games come with cut content shipped on the disc (Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines, Knights of the Old Republic 2, Super Mario Galaxy, Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time...) and they never unlock it because it was deemed unfinished. Sometimes it's buggy (VTM), others it's incomplete (KotoR2) and other times it's unintended for players to get to it (SMG, LoZ:OoT) because it was debug/testing data."
Games,3dl8ug,FallenWyvern,5,Fri Jul 17 14:26:13 2015 UTC,"Does it really matter if it's on disc or on server?   I would like to see any, and I mean any examples of someone using this logic on a non-Nintendo game."
Games,3dl8ug,AverageTheJam,9,Fri Jul 17 14:36:57 2015 UTC,"Didn't I just? V:TM-B was a game I bought on disc that wasn't a nintendo game. KOTOR2 as well. And I said it was fine with Splatoon.  The thing is, intent is important. Are companies greedy by locking down content and making you double dip? Yes, and that shit can fly right out the window.   Splatoon they've put the content on disc and unlocked it over time to keep interest in the game with their user base. Warframe updates and every time it does, I play it for a good week or two before playing other things. If they weren't updating the game, I wouldn't stay interested. GTA 5 was like that (before I stopped playing it when my free Gold month went away).  Does it suck that they put it on disc? Maybe, but I just think it doesn't matter since they're not doing it for greed. If they were charging you for those items, it would be another story all together. Now if they want to maintain that interest, the game has to either be well balanced for competitive gameplay (like Smash Bros) or it has to keep updating so eventually when it runs out of content on the disc to unlock they'll have to patch in new content over the net. Otherwise it's just a crutch to give a little more longevity to their game."
Games,3dl8ug,FallenWyvern,2,Fri Jul 17 15:01:22 2015 UTC,"Splatoon they've put the content on disc and unlocked it over time to keep interest in the game with their user base.    Well its having the opposite effect on me. I am bored to goddamn tears. There aren't enough maps and it gets stale quick. I am burning out much quicker on this game than any multiplayer shooter I ever played. The smartest thing to do with this game is not buy it until everything on disc is finally ""unlocked."" I don't care how some people spin it this is a very stupid idea. Want to keep a multiplayer game active? Release all your maps and weapons at once, have proper map rotations, some type of rudimentary voice char system (even pre written things you can tap on your tablet like ""go left"") and then continuing supporting it by adding the events, maybe have a weekend dedicated to getting a certain weapons, maybe have boys vs girls squid game, add the octo kids from the single player game and have a squids vs octo kids, have horde mode. Some of these could be free and charged real money. There done. Instead they are slowly dripping content and the game feels so small and not a full $60 purchase."
Games,3dl8ug,payne6,6,Fri Jul 17 15:30:26 2015 UTC,"For myself I agree with all of your points. What's amazing though is that I've watched my 7 year old daughter really embrace this game and become really good at it as a direct result (I think) of nintendo's dribbing and drabbing out of the content and arenas. There's never been so much content so as to overwhelm her, and as she's gotten proficient at certain splatters and arenas they throw out a couple more to mix it up. Now I can barely compete with her in the dojo co-op stuff (which is where I wish they'd focus some new content!) and it's fun having your kid kick your ass in her first shooter game! Just saying that Nintendo is ""different"" and their use of locked on-disc content really did, in this case, serve a purpose. I just wish her proficiency with the gyro controls had some use in other kid-friendly shooter types like Portal and maybe the new Zelda."
Games,3dl8ug,Gallandz,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:32 2015 UTC,"On a smaller Indie related note, Terraria has been doing this for awhile.  Frankly each of the 3 major updates had enough content that they could have probably been 4.99 DLC or something.  Ideally I suppose Minecraft did/does that every once in awhile too I suppose."
Games,3dl8ug,Bamith,2,Fri Jul 17 15:41:36 2015 UTC,It's an interesting point. I didn't think of other games than GTA since I only just started having an interest in this topic of the gaming industry. But if more of the big studios insists on giving away smaller things it might help the industry to change. Maybe.
Games,3dl8ug,kochpittet,3,Fri Jul 17 16:39:46 2015 UTC,"I remember Epic releasing new content for the Unreal Tournament series of games.  They released 4 bonus packs for the original Unreal Tournament, which included new mutators, characters and maps.  They also released extra content for Unreal Tournament 2004 as well as Unreal Tournament 3.   This was probably because a lot of modders were creating extra content on their own (new maps and game modes).     Games like Burnout Paradise released several patches and updates, including several free ones that added in motorcycles, as well as (additional) challenges for online play (along with other paid DLC).   Retro City Rampage, FTL and Terraria have included multiple updates with tons of extra free content. Maybe its because they are smaller studios and less concerned about the bottom line.  Hard Reset released Exile, a fairly big DLC for free for all owners.   Goat Simulator released its MMO expansion for free, but then offered up its zombie mod as paid DLC.  However it seems like most games pay for any additional content. Borderlands and its sequels have tons of skins and DLC, all at a cost. Killing Floor has a long record of releasing extra content for its game, at a cost. Same with Payday/2. A lot of the Lego games has released extra DLC, again at a cost (Lego Batman 3, Lego Marvel). Orcs Must Die, Magicka, Worms, and Dungeon Defenders all include a decent amount of paid DLC. Sometimes you may be able to get some of that DLC for free, like during its first week or so out (like with Skullgirls).   So, with the above, its not always just the small studios that release extra free content, and its not always just the bigger studios that charge for extra content, and its been happening for years so its unlikely to change (either way) anytime soon."

If so, while sort of expensive, I could see $7 as a ""new character"" DLC rather than $7 for ""one mission"" DLC.  Not great, but more extensive than most cosmetic DLC (as there are new attacks / animations, presumably).  edit: I do think from a public relations standpoint, Batgirl as free DLC would help, at least for PC version.  From what I heard it was pretty unplayable for a while.  I could also see it provoking ire from certain feminist gamers down the road as the female character is gated behind extra payment, leading to more bad PR."

In fact, having pre-ordered it with season pass for PC, I'll be furious if they don't give us anything.  However, Rocksteady made a good decision by deciding to concentrate on fixing the game rather than spread themselves thin trying to port the DLC as well.  WB Montreal made that mistake with Arkham Origins and they were crucified for it.

I feel that the gaming industry is the only one were consummers actually defend shitty products... I have seen people on facebook doing the daily countdown for AC: Unity release.  Sharing every bit of marketing shit ubisoft was posting...  And then crying that the game was broken.  Few months later, AC : Syndicate announced. What did I see ?  ""ho looks so awesome, can't wait, omg""  :/ :/  It's like the boycott L4D2 group, the day the game was released countless people that said would boycott the game were playing it...  Studios and publishers pull off that shit because it works, so when we insist on giving them a free pass for this they have no incentive to stop doing it.  Was it the guy from activision that said the people shouting the most on the forums were their best customers ? And that they didn't mind seeing them cry on the forum since they were very good customers ?  People cry, but they don't know what's good for them.  HOLD YOUR GROUND, VOTE WITH YOUR MONEY.  Skip a game if needed, when the studio see it's revenue go down, they will man the fuck up.  Look at battlefield hardline fail... we will see if DICE took a hint from it with battlefront. We shouldn't pre order battlefront either, and wait for reviews to know if it's properly done.  Based on actual data, make and educated choice. And if it's not good enough, then skip the game entirely.  Maybe you will miss a few games, but you are winning in the long run :) And I feel it's the only way to get games to be of good quality.

Would it be wrong to say that I'd rather have Rocksteady handle the DLC for their own game than outsource it to another studio? It didn't turn out so well when they did the same thing with their PC port.   If they continue to have WB Montreal to handle it, it's safe to bet the quality gap between the base game & DLC will reflect how it was between Origins and the other Arkham games. WB & Rocksteady are getting enough shit as it is (rightly so), but it'll continue if they keep releasing mediocre DLC that's not worth the $40 season pass.   WB Montreal made that mistake with Arkham Origins and they were crucified for it. For anyone who doesn't know, Origins had many bugs for the PC, but the devs came out and said that they wouldn't fix any of them because they were working on DLC. And those bugs are still there.   Also, to be fair, I don't think WB Montreal had much say on whether or not they could continue patching Origins. That was pretty much up to their publisher who decided to spend its budget making DLC that will generate money than ""wasting"" it by continuing to patch the game. That's probably the same case here with AK's DLC though, by outsourcing it instead of delaying it."

I don't really think that's the case. The kinds of people that are going to line up to buy this DLC are the kinds of people that don't give a flying fuck about a game's reputation, they just want to play as Batgirl. The most that will happen here is that WB will reconsider the costs of similar DLC (or not, if it sells well enough). Kain's speaking just as a gamer here, and there's nothing wrong with that but his article isn't really confronting the reality of why DLC exists to begin with and how making it free, regardless of length or quality, undermines that."

Games,3dl8ug,dekenfrost,23,Fri Jul 17 07:01:36 2015 UTC,And I did not expect a $7 DLC to be this short and underwhelming. Especially from a $40 Season Pass.
Games,3dl8ug,Cheesenium,4,Fri Jul 17 07:25:36 2015 UTC,"yeah I mean the season pass is a whole other issue too. I personally don't buy season passes, because I never know if I'm still interested in playing the game once I played through the story.   I'm still not done with dark knight and I have no idea if any of the DLC is going to be really good. DLC can be really good, but it can also be absolute throwaway content."
Games,3dl8ug,dekenfrost,9,Fri Jul 17 07:32:52 2015 UTC,That still does nto excuse them for charging a $7 DLC with so little content. I do not buy Season Passes either but whatever Warner had been doing with their games this year had really put me off from buying even the core game.

No-one's saying that Arkham Knight isn't worth the money, they're saying that the Batgirl DLC isn't.   The Batgirl DLC isn't packed full of content so it's really hard to argue that you are getting your money's worth."

Games,3dl8ug,Cranyx,6,Fri Jul 17 14:20:05 2015 UTC,"Yes we can agree on that, but I would argue that means it should be cheaper, not free."
Games,3dl8ug,dekenfrost,13,Fri Jul 17 14:54:31 2015 UTC,What does it matter when they worked on it? They should be able to split up and charge different prices even if they had it ready before launch. It's their product..
Games,3dl8ug,gregg-nyu,8,Fri Jul 17 06:46:18 2015 UTC,"Completely agree. I think it's unreasonable to ask game developers to give away their work for free just because it was completed sooner rather than later.  If we keep complaining about this, developers are just going to withhold the content for a few months (even though it's already complete) just to make it look like they spent time on it after release. It will be the same amount of content for the same price. Is that what we really want?"
Games,3dl8ug,aveman101,5,Fri Jul 17 12:18:28 2015 UTC,"Yup and this DLC wasn't even made by Rocksteady, it was made by the Origins crowd. If the main game has enough value and feels like a full product, they should be allowed do whatever they want with the surplus, they made it. Gamers are so entitled."

I pay 15 dollars for a movie ticket (midpoint between non-3D and 3D). That's 1.5-3 hours of entertainment.    I pay 7 bucks for the Batgirl DLC, which is one hour of entertainment. From either metric it seems like a good deal to me."
Games,3dl8ug,vivvav,5,Fri Jul 17 15:17:27 2015 UTC,The comic book isn't an equitable comparison. It's a physical good that you can hang on to and give away or sell later. That can't be said about the movie experience or the DLC.

Games,3dl8ug,vivvav,3,Fri Jul 17 17:14:18 2015 UTC,"I'm honestly more bugged that Rocksteady didn't even develop this DLC (WB Montreal did IIRC). If I bought the season pass for AK, would it be wrong for me to assume that the same studio who handled the base game would be making the DLC for it as well?  Even if Rocksteady is too busy fixing the PC port right now, I'd rather they delay the DLC releases so they can develop it themselves. It seems like a better option than putting out mediocre content that's not worth the asking price (to me at least)."
Games,3dl8ug,MisterSlickBack,4,Fri Jul 17 12:36:57 2015 UTC,"I'd rather they delay the DLC releases so they can develop it themselves   You might rather have the DLC delayed, but they have to make money and a steady stream of it for investors and future projects which they don't get by spreading out DLC further and further from release when the interest is still there.  It makes complete sense why they'd use a different studio for the DLC, because most people who are going to buy the season pass already bought it so even if it's mediocre that isn't changing their bottom line that much anyway."
Games,3dl8ug,OHeyB,7,Fri Jul 17 13:58:22 2015 UTC,"I might be in the minority but I think that the price is fine. $7 for an hour long DLC with collectibles and trophies/achievements is an okay deal.    Granted, I didn't buy it, haven't played it, nor do I want to do either of those two, but I don't see the problem here as long as the DLC doesn't suck (I've seen mixed reactions, most negatives come from length of the DLC, rather than the experience). Heck, Gone Home took me 45 minutes to finish and its a $20 game"
Games,3dl8ug,IamSofakingRAW,2,Fri Jul 17 17:49:13 2015 UTC,My one complaint is you can't use the characters in challenges like you could in Arkham City. Replaying those challenges for the three stars with different characters was a huge part of the game for me.   Now it's a lot of car racing. :/
Games,3dl8ug,GUI_VB_IP_Tracker,4,Fri Jul 17 19:51:20 2015 UTC,"I think saying it should be free is going too far. It's new content, new ideas, and a new character. It's just extra stuff. It costs money to make and should cost money to buy."

Games,3dl8ug,geoper,2,Fri Jul 17 20:05:17 2015 UTC,"I like Paradox Interactive's take on this idea with CK2.   When new DLC is released, all the content is put into the base game, but much of it is gated off. This means when the map has been expanded, it's been expanded for EVERYONE. When a new faction or gameplay style appears it will be present in your games in AI form- adding more variety and new ways to interact with AI players.  Buying the DLC basically lets you play as those new factions."
Games,3dl8ug,Evis03,2,Fri Jul 17 19:27:56 2015 UTC,"If each DLC came with AR challenges, then fine. I feel like I hardly know any of the character's move sets besides Batgirl as when you're Red Hood or Harley, your the last big fight requires to fight a very specific, repetitive way.  Either pressing counter and another button at the right time or vaulting so you can attack someone with stun batons from behind.  Arkham City and Origins did it right by having challenge maps right there with each character. Even characters you didn't originally fight with at all like Robin or Nightwing.  A pity things had to happen this way. Do you blame Rocksteady or WB Games for this?"
Games,3dl8ug,Eman5805,5,Fri Jul 17 20:40:13 2015 UTC,"It's a two hour DLC featuring a new character and it's 7 dollars.   7 Dollars.   That's less than minimum wage in a lot of places. I get the PC version is pretty bad for some, but the game performs fantastic on the consoles. And it's 7 dollars.   Not two hours of 3-5 story missions in Destiny with it's 25 dollar experience packs. 7. Are we seriously going to complain about something so cheap?"

They may get some kind of bonus from that, but that's all. And yeah, a free piece of miniscule DLC is absolutely the very least WB could do as kind of an olive branch to PC gamers. WB has screwed us HARD on their last few PC releases. MKX is still a mess. Arkham Origins is still a crash - riddled mess. And now Arkham Knight, which was an unmitigated disaster on PC at launch, won't be fixed for a few months. Yeah, I think WB can handle giving away a single piece of DLC."

Games,3dl8ug,noah3302,8,Fri Jul 17 19:04:20 2015 UTC,"All right, here's the expanded version:  The free DLC that CD Projekt RED and Colossal Order have for their games are also extras to complete games. Being an extra piece of content does not automatically mean it has to cost something to the customer so that the developers benefit; free DLC extends the long tail of sales for the game and can be put in place alongside bigger, more content-rich expansions.  The DLC programs of each game seem to highlight the attitudes of the developers/publishers towards their customers. CDProjekt RED and Colossal Order make smaller stuff in the attitude of ""this stuff is cool small additions we didn't feel comfortable charging you for, but the big DLC will be worth it because we're adding 10+hours of the same quality content as the current game"". There is no debate on here that everything CDProjekt RED has said about their DLC will make it worth $20.   Batman: AK's DLC feels like they had to have preorder bonus and season pass DLC, so they put in the minimum amount of content to qualify."
Games,3dl8ug,GUI_VB_IP_Tracker,2,Fri Jul 17 19:21:51 2015 UTC,"Though free dlc is great for PR and great all around, you can't fault a company for charging dlc, they would be losing money if they did. Like how CDProjekt RED is most likely losing money. Also WB is lately been pretty bad with the dlcs. Like MKX and Arkham Knight. Rocksteady and Netherrealm were probably forced by WB to have all these shitty pre-orders. Where as CDProjekt RED is independent. Free dlc is nice, but 7 bucks for an hour is fine. Maybe compared to Fallout's dlc its overpriced, but if you really like the game, its worth it."
Games,3dl8ug,noah3302,4,Fri Jul 17 19:44:04 2015 UTC,"Someone took time and money to make this content.  If you don't like it or don't feel it was worth $7, thats your thing, but don't for a second say it ""should have been free"" just because you didn't think it was long enough.  That devalues the work done by the artists, programmers, sound designers, actors, etc who all made this expansion.    Even a short experience involved months of work on top of the base game, and we all know from it being explained by developers a thousand times over that DLC does not fall within the base game's budget.   if you want something for free, you deserve nothing.  You're telling all those people who worked on the Batgirl mission that you would appreciate it if they still made the game but did so without accepting any payment for it.  You know what?  I didn't like that Godzilla movie that came out last year.  It was a pile of shit.  But I didn't think it should be free just because I didn't like it."

And I agree with that. Do I think it should be free JUST because it was short? No, you and I are in complete agreement on that. However, I think making this relatively minor and relatively cheap little DLC free for people who bought the game when it was still a massive piece of shit would have been a nice move.    EDIT: Just remembered that the Batgirl DLC isn't out on PC yet. Duh. Anyway, besides my idiocy, I still stand by what I said. We'll just have to see what WB does with the PC release of it."

As an Xbox One player, they have nothing to be sorry to me for, nor my friends on PS4.  from the article... (bold emphasis mine)   The downloadable mission, which lets you play as Batgirl, is the first installment in the Arkham Knight season pass. You can read Paul Tassi’s review of the content here. He finished in 55 minutes, which is comparable to one of the shorter side mission segments in the base game. If I had to guess, I’d say that taking down Two-Face and his bank robbers took me about an hour. It was a fun hour, but I wouldn’t pay seven bucks for it.   ERIK KAIN DIDN'T EVEN PLAY BATGIRL YET.  He's basing this ""it should be free"" argument on the idea that his colleague told him it was 55 minutes.  What could possibly have gotten him so upset about the supposed dollar value of this game?   Note: I purchased both the base game and the season pass for Batman: Arkham Knight in order to review. I often receive review code for video games I write about, but for some reason, even though I was supposed to receive a review copy, I never did.

I remember with Rome II there was a particular amphibious landing battle trailer that everyone assumed would be how the game was like on launch.  Like with a lot of trailers for games it ended up wide of the mark.  I guess they're trying to nip that in the bud from happening with Warhammer."

Games,3dm4pq,Faldric,9,Fri Jul 17 12:50:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe it's been a while since you played that historical battle. Let me refresh your memory with this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92PLZHcIBsQ  Enjoy it with all its low draw distance, low texture details, missing smoke effects, ...... Totally in the same league as the video above. Because the final version will look far far better than this, right?"
Games,3dm4pq,balanceofpower,3,Fri Jul 17 14:38:16 2015 UTC,"C'mon dude, look at his shadows. It's obvious he's playing on reduced settings (those shadows I'd wager are on high, certainly not ultra) no doubt to reduce stutter while capturing video, as Carthage is a very demanding map, performance-wise; it's hard to tell as well if he lowered texture settings along with other features to reduce stuttering but it's not out of the question.  My point is that the video you're linking is not an accurate depiction of Rome 2's graphics at its highest (ultra) settings.   While I agree that the presenter oversold Rome 2's final state by saying it's going to be ""way way better than this,"" what we're shown is not at all dissimilar to what we see in Rome 2 now. The biggest difference beyond that cinematic lighting is Carthage's lacking paved and narrower streets; it's difficult to say if it was an intentional design decision or an attempt to reduce performance issues (Carthage as it is now is already pretty demanding) or pathing issues, or a combination of all three.  Either way, most of things we see in that pre-alpha demo is representative of the final product minus the gameplay changes (dat rocket artillery) and the aesthetics mentioned above. Are we really going to grouse about the layout of streets? The game still plays 99.9999% similar to what we see here.  I don't think that's something to get up in arms about.  edit: I went back for  a second viewing to see pre-release Carthage's layout at 4:53. Look at all those narrow streets. I can't imagine the bottlenecks every siege would turn into if they'd stuck with that layout. Yeah it looks ""good"" on screen, like that rocket artillery, but looking good and playing good are often two different things. So I'm now wagering this was as much as a design decision as it was one to reduce performance issues."
Games,3dm4pq,Bior37,3,Fri Jul 17 19:27:24 2015 UTC,That's more or less what the game looks like though...
Games,3dm4pq,Carighan,-6,Sun Jul 19 00:36:55 2015 UTC,"Yes but really, if you need to explain this, what does that tell you about where your reputation and the trust in your company and especially your PR/Marketing is at?  Trailer vs Gameplay should be a trivial distinction, not something which needs to be explained."
Games,3dm4pq,momuse888,16,Fri Jul 17 17:26:56 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good step.  It says a lot about the industry as a whole, IMHO, not just CA.  Even CD Projekt RED, who are arguably one of the best developers for consumers, had a gameplay trailer that turned out to be better looking than release.  Of course, in an ideal world you're right this wouldn't be an issue but it is.  Again and again and again by various developers.  I applaud CA for trying to be as transparent as they can."
Games,3dm4pq,DougyAM,8,Fri Jul 17 13:36:22 2015 UTC,"I agree. It sounds like CA has had a few decent retrospectives since R2 and they've been working hard to address complaints from the last iteration. It's kind of a shame that they have to idiot-proof their advertising, for all those people who fail to do their own research before throwing down money and complain when the game doesn't live up to their expectations. Concerning graphics, it seems like there is always a huge outcry from the gaming community when the initial trailers look better than the final product. Most people will disagree with me on this, and that's okay, but I think it's pretty silly when people get angry that the Witcher 3, or Watch Dogs, or Rome 2 didn't look as good as the trailers shown. ""They should be fined for false advertising!"" I hear people say. Well, if that's grounds for prosecution then most commercial companies in the world probably need to be sued as well...those Big Macs definitely don't look like they do in the posters. Bugs and gameplay, of course, is a completely different story and R2 definitely had its own issues."
Games,3dm4pq,jpjandrade,21,Fri Jul 17 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"It is good that they are being up front about this not being a true rendition of what the gameplay will be, they got a lot of flack for Rome 2 regarding the Carthage video and hopefully this is the start of better communication between the fans and the developer so that nobody gets led up the garden path on the way to release with false expectations."
Games,3dm4pq,Warhawk_1,4,Fri Jul 17 18:06:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, as I said, it feels like they're trying to nip any ""carthage-gate"" in the bud this time by clearly labelling their videos."
Games,3dm4pq,DundonianStalin,27,Fri Jul 17 12:49:44 2015 UTC,"I am glad that they are taking steps for this type of clarity, but it's all pointless if the game comes out half broken.  I was fully absorbed by CA's hype machine during Rome II, watching every trailer, following the daily screenshots they were putting out. After that, never again.   I will forever be interested in their games, but I don't think I have it in me to be ever hyped for another release."
Games,3dm4pq,DarkLiberator,4,Fri Jul 17 14:50:49 2015 UTC,"I am glad that they are taking steps for this type of clarity, but it's all pointless if the game comes out half broken.   That's true.  I think CA have tried to do better, though.  For example, Attila was a much smoother release.  Although I feel like this controversy over trailer VS release gets brought up again and again and isn't something specific to CA.  I think if more developers adopted a similar transparency we'd get less of the ""expectation VS reality"" posts that always come post release."
Games,3dm4pq,DundonianStalin,7,Fri Jul 17 12:51:10 2015 UTC,"The problem though is that Attila fits the pattern for launches.  Empire was mess, Napoleon more polished.  Shogun 2 was decent-ish, but Fall of the Samurai was fairly polished  Rome 2 was a mess, Atilla is more polished.  As such, I'm fairly concerned that a repeat will happen with Warhammer."
Games,3dm4pq,Wozzle90,2,Fri Jul 17 14:57:10 2015 UTC,I'm the same I'm always interested but seldom convinced since Fall of the Samurai. I didn't buy Rome 2 on release and I still haven't bought Attila. I played a fair amount of both on the free weekend and I just went back to Shogun2.
Games,3dm4pq,dracarys20,2,Fri Jul 17 21:46:45 2015 UTC,"Would love to see a Victoria age Total War if they ever go back to that era. FOTS I loved because the ways to kill your enemies got brutal, like machine guns, long range rifles and naval bombardments.   Of course depends if they can put it together. I'm convinced Shogun 2 went smoothly because it was focused on a smaller area with less unique factions."
Games,3dm4pq,metal079,2,Fri Jul 17 13:30:01 2015 UTC,Yeah some people said the factions all kind of felt the same but it worked better I feel for that reason.   They had the option with Attila to go back there but they didn't take it.

Games,3dixcv,PharmKB,206,Thu Jul 16 23:27:14 2015 UTC,Skyrim has made roughly a billion dollars total so far. Fallout 3 made over 300 million. I don't think We're in danger of them shifting their business model any time soon.
Games,3dixcv,dgrimm121,132,Thu Jul 16 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"The big problem with mobile games is that they have proven to be more profitable than big budget titles.  Skyrim cost around 100 million.  So with a 1 billion dollar income, that's a 10X gross against cost.  The mobile app has 5 million in income in just a few weeks, so in order to match or exceed Skyrim for level of income compared to cost, it only needs to have cost $500,000 to make.    That's an average of about 6 people for a year using really rough industry income averages.  Given much more time, the 5 million will of course be much higher as well.  It's not even out on Android yet, which is 70-80% of the mobile market.  I think there's a really good chance that Fallout Shelter may well be the most profitable product they've ever built."
Games,3dixcv,TarmackGaming,104,Thu Jul 16 20:51:40 2015 UTC,"Most profitable by percentage, perhaps. But I'm going to assume they're smart enough to know that they're not going to keep building succesfull games like this repeatedly. I'm sure they know that the success is very largely to thank because of the Fallout 4 hype, and without it, it wouldn't have nearly raked in as much money.  On the Android comment, I seriously doubt it will rake in as much money simply because most of the hype for the game has already passed, and by the time the Android version is released, the majority simply won't care anymore."
Games,3dixcv,showmeyourprivates,10,Thu Jul 16 22:20:19 2015 UTC,"On the Android comment, I seriously doubt it will rake in as much money simply because most of the hype for the game has already passed, and by the time the Android version is released, the majority simply won't care anymore.

Games,3dixcv,naryn,14,Fri Jul 17 06:45:57 2015 UTC,Yeah but I'm sure this cost a fraction of what Skyrim or Fallout cost to make. So let's say it cost $100k to make (that's probably a little extreme - but cost for art assets and man hours). That ROI is insane.
Games,3dixcv,sag969,39,Thu Jul 16 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"There's no way it only cost 100k to make, I'm sure they still made a great return but that's a very low estimate."
Games,3dixcv,mbdjd,31,Thu Jul 16 21:22:51 2015 UTC,"True, but it also trades on the brand name that the more expensive projects earned.

And they've already announced their second mobile game, that Elder Scrolls card game."
Games,3dixcv,ducttape83,182,Thu Jul 16 18:17:11 2015 UTC,"According to this article from the Washington Post, the game had been in development since 2008 and was largely seen as a side project to their main developmental work. I'd make the argument that the development of Fallout Shelter was an endeavor to see what would happen if Bethesda made the game that they (the developers) wanted to play without making the same mistakes that other mobile developers have made."
Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,176,Thu Jul 16 18:25:25 2015 UTC,"It being a side project is beside the point. They spent little resources on it to see if it was a viable market to enter.

Games,3dixcv,ducttape83,35,Thu Jul 16 18:36:01 2015 UTC,The fact that Fallout Shelter was a side project is entirely the point as Bethesda created the game to see what would happen if they expanded into the mobile market.

Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,20,Thu Jul 16 18:47:48 2015 UTC,"Which wouldn't be awful, or anything.   I haven't regretting buying anything from them, yet, and their corporate leadership not only has a long history of building games, but understands how very annoyed with gimmicks gamers can be.  For me, Bethesda is showing the kind of honesty about wanting to make things so good you want to buy them that a solid firm does.  People buy shares of Berkshire Hathaway or other explicit index funds because the fundamental premise is ""Yeah, this guy wants to invest money you're giving him, but he has skin in the game too, and isn't exactly dishonest about what he wants to do with it""  http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/owners.html  A Message from Warren E. Buffett, Chairman and CEO  January 1999  ""Although our form is corporate, our attitude is partnership""  ""In line with Berkshire's owner-orientation, most of our directors have a major portion of their net worth invested in the company. We eat our own cooking.""  ""Charlie and I cannot promise you results. But we can guarantee that your financial fortunes will move in lockstep with ours for whatever period of time you elect to be our partner. We have no interest in large salaries or options or other means of gaining an ""edge"" over you. We want to make money only when our partners do and in exactly the same proportion. Moreover, when I do something dumb, I want you to be able to derive some solace from the fact that my financial suffering is proportional to yours.""  Good business practice and consumer satisfaction relies on this level of trust  The reason BH posted revenues of nearly 200 Billion, the reason a VC firm like NEA can raise 18 billion from people to invest in technological companies, the reason people will day in and day out buy Chipotle and Coca Cola is because there is trust.  Trust that the company wants to do what it takes to deliver what you want.   Coca Cola wants to be sure that they can, however they can, make your experience of drinking their stuff as good as it can be, so that you give them money.  Warren Buffet wants to be as transparent as he can be, making sure your expectations about return on investment aren't unfounded, so that you give him money.  Bethesda seems much the same way - - - they understand their purpose is having people give them money, because the experience you get for buying their games is so goddamn good that you'll trust them.  Maybe they'll suffer some stupid corporate decisions in the future.  Who knows.  But for now, their track record is such I'm not worried and will continue to buy their stuff."
Games,3dixcv,lolmonger,5,Thu Jul 16 20:01:05 2015 UTC,You raise an excellent point that Bethesda by comparing them to the model that Berkshire Hathaway utilizes and the trust that both companies have fostered with its consumers/partners.

Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,3,Thu Jul 16 19:02:45 2015 UTC,And what's the issue with that? They aren't going to cancel everything and only do mobiles you know...

Games,3dixcv,mcdonis,15,Thu Jul 16 18:57:38 2015 UTC,"Well those sort of scenarios typically happen more if you have a public company, and there's a big disconnect between the money flow and the product, but Bethesda is owned by ZeniMax who is private, and has only has 25% ownership from outside capital.  Making their two big IP's are still profitable, there's no reason to downsize to just mobile, especially when they're mobile game did so well because of the brand recognition and hype it received from the full RPG game it's known for.  I suspect we'll see more mobile games but I doubt that you're going to see any less of what they're known for, especially since they're synergistic."
Games,3dixcv,damendred,26,Thu Jul 16 19:37:59 2015 UTC,Steam used to be a side project.
Games,3dixcv,ItsMeCaptainMurphy,16,Thu Jul 16 19:13:17 2015 UTC,"You really only have to look at the direction blizzard is going to see what happens once a big developer starts making bank in the ""Free* to Play"" market.    Yes the Shelter app might have been a side project, yes the profits are most assuredly going to tail off. But when they consider the return on investment that mobile game made, then people start imagining what you could make if you catered it to be even more ""free""."
Games,3dixcv,T3hSwagman,11,Thu Jul 16 18:54:25 2015 UTC,You know what else was a side project? Hearthstone. Now it's making Blizz a shitload of money. I think Fallout Shelter might be Bethesda's Hearthstone.
Games,3dixcv,jackpg98,4,Thu Jul 16 20:27:25 2015 UTC,"Does shelter have the same staying power though? I played it a lot for a few days, but got bored of it pretty quickly. I never spent a dime, so maybe I am not the target user, but once you have your economy going and some guns to prevent bandit raids, fallout shelter is pretty boring. Hearthstone has challenge and new cards coming out, and seems pretty interesting"
Games,3dixcv,docbauies,7,Thu Jul 16 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"without making the same mistakes that other mobile developers have made.   The blinders are on full, the game is just as cash grab garbage as the rest of 'em"
Games,3dixcv,lenigod,11,Thu Jul 16 20:25:37 2015 UTC,How is Fallout Shelter as much of a cash grab as Candy Crush or Angry Birds? There is one in-app purchase (IAP) in the game which is entirely optional to the overall game play whereas Candy Crush and Angry Birds will outright halt your ability to progress in the game without purchasing content. Fallout Shelter may have generated an incredibly large profit for Bethesda but that does mean the game is a cash grab.
Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,6,Thu Jul 16 20:27:49 2015 UTC,"I see it more as shades of grey. While it doesn't necessarily wall you off from content with micro-transactions, it still features encouragement for players to buy more of those lunchboxes. It will inevitably ask again, and again, in perpetuity. Maybe that's a small thing for some but it's still just a feature purpose built for continual monetization. Sure feels rewarding to open those boxes, eh?"
Games,3dixcv,towcools,6,Thu Jul 16 21:31:32 2015 UTC,The game will continue to ask if you want to purchase more lunch boxes but I feel like the lunch boxes are already plentiful enough that you don't really need to purchase them. I recognize that we are debating different shades of grey as you suggest but I think this game proposes an interesting dynamic in the mobile marketplace. The purchases were pretty much optional and the game was still incredibly successful. Do you think that this success could permeate to other developers such as King (Candy Crush) or Rovio (Angry Birds) which would result in a significant change in their models?
Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,4,Thu Jul 16 21:36:04 2015 UTC,Newer developers will likely take notice of this. And I think that's the more important thing.
Games,3dixcv,towcools,20,Thu Jul 16 21:47:35 2015 UTC,"merely ""to see what would happen.""   Yes they do. Especially creative companies, like video game studios. Bethesda has earned A LOT of leeway with Zenimax, since it saved the company back with Morrowind and has consistently made games that have sold really well.   I do believe them when they said that they wanted to try making an app as a side project and not focus too heavily on it. The idea was already discussed back when they made Fallout 3 as you can see the idea behind Fallout shelter in the fallout 3 e3 trailer."
Games,3dixcv,Jcpmax,5,Thu Jul 16 18:27:39 2015 UTC,They have already made several mobile games. The success of it is the only new part.
Games,3dixcv,stylepoints99,17,Thu Jul 16 18:35:33 2015 UTC,It was the perfect storm of success. Fallout 3 and New Vegas were several years ago and very well loved. People have been frothing at the mouth for a new Fallout game. The shelter releases on the heals of the much anticipated and predicted Fallout 4 announcement. I doubt they could have seen this kind of success at any other time. They could have been sitting on this idea for years waiting for Fallout 4.
Games,3dixcv,Neato,9,Thu Jul 16 21:12:59 2015 UTC,I think your view is a very interesting take on the success of Fallout Shelter and I am inclined to agree with you. I think most of the success of Fallout Shelter stemmed from the rabid desire for new Fallout content by the fans.
Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,3,Thu Jul 16 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"I mean, let's be honest here, it's not like it's a complex and riveting game by any stretch of the imagination. It's far less nuanced than even Sim City, which is an exercise in frustration and watching paint dry."
Games,3dixcv,callius,2,Fri Jul 17 02:54:28 2015 UTC,That doesn't seem to refute the notion that they may move towards the market.
Games,3dixcv,Skorpazoid,4,Thu Jul 16 19:43:36 2015 UTC,"When you say ""move towards the market"", do you mean a focus shift from their current developmental focus on RPGs like TES or Fallout to spend more time on mobile or to add mobile assets to complement their existing developmental plans?"
Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,3,Thu Jul 16 19:58:03 2015 UTC,Well you argument was meant as a counter to what Titan771 didn't want. As he describes:   I REALLY hope this doesn't have any affect on their business model/focus. I just want awesome first-person RPG's.   So I was saying your comment did nothing to refute the idea that this could have an effect on their business model/focus.
Games,3dixcv,Skorpazoid,2,Thu Jul 16 20:06:00 2015 UTC,I honestly think the success of Fallout Shelter will not impact Bethesda's model in a significant way that would degrade their RPG development because their design philosophy is to make the games that gamers and their developers want rather than trying to maximize their profit.
Games,3dixcv,dethandtaxes,6,Thu Jul 16 20:12:24 2015 UTC,"I doubt it will. There is probably some arguement to be made that the 5.1m was a great ROI in terms of what it cost to develop, but at the end of the day they have bigger fish to fry. Skyrim sold what, 20m copies? Brought in hundreds of millions of dollars for them.  If Shelter had somehow turned into a Clash of Clans and was printing them 500m a year, then sure maybe they would pivot. But this isn't anything worth pivoting for."
Games,3dixcv,Jandur,11,Thu Jul 16 19:16:42 2015 UTC,"Hrm, I don't think they can do this too many more times. Fallout shelter is apparently a fairly mediocre game and its sales are very likely because of the brand. Maybe they can put out one of these with each big release but the fans will get tired of it eventually unless they innovate a bit."
Games,3dixcv,Zandivya,5,Thu Jul 16 19:38:58 2015 UTC,"I dont think they intend to move completely into the mobile platform. Most ""gamers"" use mobile as a supplemental platform in America, not as a standalone. People just want their gaming fix on the go.   It seems like a great business move to use your IP to make little spin-offs of main games that will instantly attract fans of that franchise. It could potentially help build customer loyalty, a fan base for the franchise, or draw completely new fans from the mobile platform to ""main"" platforms.   Im not a mobile gamer so I could care less about the game content, but if it helps Bethesda generate money they need to release a better final product quicker, I'm in favor."
Games,3dixcv,jackp0t08,2,Thu Jul 16 22:08:20 2015 UTC,"Wise words. When people fret over Nintendo's future strategy with mobile, I think they overlook your observation.

Games,3dixcv,lajiggyjarjardoo,19,Fri Jul 17 00:05:10 2015 UTC,"Mobile gaming is not a fad and it's only going to keep growing; it's the only system the player has on them all day long.  I haven't touched my 3DS in about a year, yet I play every single day on my iPhone and/or iPad.  What it does need however, is to evolve.  F2P needs to go away, it limits fun by design which the whole point of gaming.   I think Bethesda is missing a huge opportunity and market not re-releasing Fallout 1 & 2 with a streamlined touch interface.  Look how well Baldur's Gate 1 and 2 have done on iOS, same goes for Shadowrun Dragonfall and even XCOM.  As for Fallout Shelter, I'm not surprised those are the first two week numbers and I wouldn't be surprised if those numbers didn't crash and burn after that.  I've been playing since week 1, haven't spent a cent and I have a thriving vault, I think that's great.  However, it's barely a game, it's more like an interactive ant farm.  What's the end game? Assume I have 200 vault people, fully equipped with the best gear...so? Where do I go from there? Send them out to the wasteland to grab more gear? Why? It's not like it's a fun mini-game that I can play; now what? I just open the game and tap a couple of times and move on?  The game itself is just completely pointless, I'm still playing it since I have yet to unlock all the rooms and I want to see what they look like, but it's not fun, it's mind numbing and pointless.  If they do release more original stuff in the future I hope it's more of a game and less of a click and wait 10 minutes interactive fish tank.  I also hope they do consider releasing all their classics with a touch friendly interface; even Fallout 3 and NV would probably run on current and last gen iOS devices."
Games,3dixcv,LetsDiscourse,6,Thu Jul 16 20:03:15 2015 UTC,"You're right, the endgame is 100% stale.  I have 200 vault people.  I'm in the process of raising their stats up to max.  Why?  Nothing else to do.  Gets quite stale.    It needs to have a little more dwarf fortress in it, by making it possible for mature vaults to die.  More raiders?  More incident types?  Basically increase the challenge somehow.    The only catch is that if you make it possible for a vault to wipe, then people will lose the lunchboxes that they have purchased.  If Bethesda can figure out that design challenge, then they will have a game with staying power."
Games,3dixcv,killotron,2,Fri Jul 17 00:39:03 2015 UTC,"F2P isn't going to go away until people start being comfortable paying 15-20 dollars upfront for a game.  The price is set so low compared to the costs of creating a game that people have to find alternate methods to recoup the costs and make money.  The consumer isn't willing to drop enough up front, but they will give you money over time so its really the only option if your game has a decent level of budget.  Its sad in a way, but thats the price culture that was set in motion."
Games,3dixcv,Indetermination,2,Fri Jul 17 00:21:57 2015 UTC,The problem with mobile is all the controls obscure the screens and that it doesn't feel very responsive. It will be interesting to see what happens with Gear VR and similar hardware where you just slot your phone into the VR set though.  I agree with you on the direction of mobile games such as FS it's like smartphone gaming has a weird MMO mindset of never ending gameplay.
Games,3dixcv,floodster,2,Fri Jul 17 03:13:26 2015 UTC,"I find that the best mobile interfaces are the ones where the game is top down and you just tap on a spot and your characters move there.

Games,3dixcv,LetsDiscourse,2,Fri Jul 17 06:06:26 2015 UTC,"Maybe there are some titles that pull that off, but even the ones that use that control scheme that I've played are a little wonky since it's a big fat finger that can easily miss it's mark on the screen."

I had a lack of weapons which meant I was using all my stimpaks to fend off raiders and keep alive radroach fighters, ending up creating a negative cycle.   I read some tips at the subreddit and figured out that it's pretty much a matter of slow, steady growth. I took my time in the first sub-50 dwellers to let them slowly train and become better at their SPECIAL, sending out regular explorers to collect weapons, outfits, and caps so that I'm constantly able to keep ahead of the curve.

Games,3dixcv,DoktorSoviet,8,Thu Jul 16 19:17:09 2015 UTC,"Yup, something like 95% of the revenue generated by most mobile games comes from about 1 - 2% of the player base.

I haven't paid anything towards Fallout: Shelter, but if someone else wants to, that's their choice. It's not like the game forces you to pay money to advance or anything, like many mobile titles do."
Games,3dixcv,Ultrace-7,51,Thu Jul 16 18:18:59 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  If I find I'm playing a f2p game a lot and enjoying it, I spend some money on the game.  I feel the developers have earned it from me.  If the game constantly begs for money or makes gameplay unfair or tedious without spending money, then that's usually not fun.  As such, they don't earn my money."
Games,3dixcv,paleo2002,22,Thu Jul 16 19:08:55 2015 UTC,Exactly. People make fun of me all the time for spending about ~$60 on Clash of Clans over the year and a half I've been playing it. I spend $60 on a video game that I play for a month. The amount of time I've spent on CoC has made it very worth the $60.
Games,3dixcv,jlopez24,15,Thu Jul 16 21:23:32 2015 UTC,"Well the problem I have with clash of clans and other similar games are that they're designed to force you to pay money. Making you wait days to get that new cannon or upgrade your archer just to move up the ranks a bit. Or, instead of waiting a few days, you can spend 2 bucks now and you're good to go! That's a cheap business model and a terrible way to profit off of cheap content."

The only time you're waiting for long is when you're training dwellers, or sending them out into the wasteland. Rooms are built instantly, and resources are gathered every 30 seconds to a minute (slightly longer if your dwellers aren't suited for the room they're assigned to).    There's nothing you can do to speed any of the above up.   You could argue that because you need caps to construct rooms, and caps are found in lunchboxes, that could be considered ""waiting"", but nobody is buying lunchboxes for the caps. Getting 500 caps in a box  is considered a dud. People want legendary weapons, outfits and dwellers."

Games,3dixcv,BreeBree214,3,Thu Jul 16 20:03:29 2015 UTC,"It is just like a hotel manager simulator, except with vaults. It is pretty much the only game I play in my iPad just because of these two reasons:  1.- It is one of those ""wait-and-play"" games where you do something (like sending a dweller to explore the wasteland) and forget about it for a couple of hours. For example, when I wake up, I play and level up my dwellers, collect resources and send some dwellers to the wasteland. That's all I do in the morning. Then during the day, I boot up the game once more to see how the dwellers are doing, level them up again and collect a few resources. By night, I boot it up once more to call back the dweller from the wasteland, collect a final batch of resources, and that's it.  2.- It requires no skill to understand it. The game explains everything on the fly. Other things are pretty self explanatory. Are there a lot of dwellers in your vault? Build a dinner! Did you build a lot of rooms? No problem, just build a few power generators. Also, sometimes, it can get extremely difficult if your dwellers can't stop a fire, a raid attack or a roach infestation.  TL;dr it is one of those games that you can boot up, play a few minutes, and forget about it for most of the day. I play it around 4 times a day, waste around 20 minutes of my day in it. It isn't your regular ""hardcore"" game. You just play it to have some fun for a while"

Instead I got a tamagatchi with micro transactions and huge wait times. The most interesting interactions I can think of are forced on you (designated studs, anyone?) and have no consequence. The least that could have happened is meaningful amount of genetic lineage of SPECIAL attributes, but since everything is run at baseline 1, 2, and 3 that means nothing.   I've heard so much hand waiving towards this game's quality as ""it's good for what it is"" or ""it's just a mobile game"" but those are awful excuses.

I would guess that over 90% of mobile games are either (often shitty) ports of old low graphic games, or stuff like this.  The only reason mobile gaming even exists is due to games exactly like this and other ""Farmville clones.""  The reason they make so many like that is because they make money, and they make money because they are extremely low-budget and don't take very long to develop compared to games for other platforms.

The platform it uses is no excuse for the quality of the title.  Even if we go into the Free2Play mobile craze, I would argue there is more depth to Clash of Clans, Kingdom Rush, The Mortal Kombat and Injustice spin off titles, etc. Fallout Shelter takes the base aesthetic and simplest mechanical approach to their title and as a result, is about as thread bare as any of the actual garbage on the storefront.

Also, despite having a dozen or so special dwellers, only one shows up on my list.  Screen responsiveness and lag has improved. Lvl 50 people now appear in your people vault list after you sort on lvl.  caps are maxed at 999,999. unless you pull more caps via lunch boxes, then it will tick over the max amount.

Even if a paid-mod works for the current version of the game, there is no guarantee that a paid-mod will continue to work with next game updates.

Even at $1 a mod, is spending $5 (1 success, 4 fail) worth my arrows equipping and unequipping as I equip my bow? Would I want to buy half a dozen house mods at $5 each to decide which one I want?

They range from simple texture improvements for a single item to total overhauls of core game mechanics, and add everything from a simple dagger to a whole new locations complete with missions and voice acting.  The nature of modding is that every few months some of them get abandoned and are usually replaced by a newer, better version made by someone else.  On top of this, in many cases the new version is just a fork of the old one when the original developer abandoned it.  Many of these mods have been edited by me or have to be loaded in a specific order to function correctly.   Making mods paid totally changes things.  Now when a mod gets abandoned it might stop functioning on the next patch, but I'm not going to get a refund. If I want to replace it with something else I have to pay for that too. Now I've paid twice for the same modification.   On top of that, licensing issues make it a real problem to fork paid content, so the idea of someone ""taking up the torch"" to continue an abandoned project is basically out of the question.  Now throw in mod dependencies. I want Mod X, but in order to use it I require mods A, B, and C. All of them cost money, and in order to use B I also require mods D and E which ALSO cost money.  It's a rabbit hole of nightmares when you make mods paid without enforcing quality control and compatibility."

And as you say, if someone were to ask me to name 10 mods I cannot live without I might be hard pressed to do it.  You install them because each one is a little improvement.  You take the burden of technical support primarily on yourself, and hopefully the modder has some words of wisdom or reports of other mods theirs conflicts with.  You pay the price of using the mod with your time and effort spent learning the intricacies of the mods.    Unless they can vouch for full technical support so I just plug and play every mod, which I doubt, I don't see this working anytime soon."

Actually that reminds me of another thing paid modding ruins: Collections and Megapacks.  There are some in the community who take it upon themselves to package up a bunch of other mods and release them as a single package for you to download and install.  These guys handle all of the issues you'd normally run into yourself; They fix compatibility problems, merge everything together to prevent load order problems, clean up bloat, and more, all so you can just install and forget. It also lets you get around the maximum number of installed mods.  For example, you'll often see ""hair packs"" where someone has taken the top 10 hair pack mods and merged them all together into a single ESM library. In the process he removed the duplicates and prevented three of those mods from clobbering each other when they are installed simultaneously.   This is a beneficial service that cannot happen with paid mods. What if one of the mods in the pack is paid? What if the guy who packaged them all up wants to charge for his work?  There are a lot of difficult questions once money (that wasn't donated) is involved."

But I sincerely believe that paid modding for Bethesda games can work. I think the ideal system is that most smaller mods, like a paltry puddle retex, will stay free and most of the bigger mods like Falskaar, Skywind, or Endereal will be able to take advantage of the paid system and generate income for the people that work on those projects."

Legal issues because gamers are bringing copyrighted assets into the mods? Pirating from content from other modders? Broken mods that are no longer supported? Strict curation solves many of these issues. So, in case you haven't paid attention to gaming history, there have been lots of mods that were at first free, and then went behind a paywall when they had reached a certain level of progress. To name a few Counter-Strike, DayZ, Black Mesa, Stanley Parable, G-Mod...

In statement A, you seemed dead-set against the idea of any mod being paid for, whereas in statement B you gave me several reasons for why these mods were successfully ported to becoming a releasable product. So are you saying that creating a dedicated storefront for these mods is somehow different than having them available separately on Steam? Some clarification would be nice.   Not sure what ""strict curation"" even means.   It's not difficult to understand. Any product that is readying for commercial release undergoes simple checks to ensure that the product doesn't violate any copyrights laws or other potential issues. Systems are also in place that help people protect their own work if if assets are stolen or if piracy was involved. Valve did the complete opposite and decided to let mod authors and consumers figure out their own problems--and we see where that went.    It kinda sounds like you're describing the two sides as having equal evidence to support them when they really don't.    Hmmm, I would personally never be arrogant enough to assume that the other person with a different opinion couldn't give me something new to think about; but the choice to be ignorantly close-minded is certainly your right as a human being.     there's other ways besides foisting an out-of-place business model on a sharing-based economy.

There are valid arguments for it being more, less, or the same,"" Bethesda said back in April. ""It is the current industry standard, having been successful in both paid and free games. After much consultation and research with Valve, we decided it's the best place to start.""   So basically they're using modders as an excuse to ask for more money from the consumers, while actually giving modders the smallest cut. I'm certainly sympathetic towards modders who spend a lot of effort on their work, but this has fuck all to do with supporting modders and everything to do with furthering monetization.  I'm unsure what's the best way to financially support modders. A donation button certainly wouldn't hurt, but I doubt that's going to do all that much. I wouldn't pay for any mods as I'm not all that wealthy myself, maybe only chip in with Steam Wallet leftovers for massive fan-made expansions."

Skyrim stuff ranges from simple skins, yes, to complete overhaul of the certain parts of the game engine. There is a world of difference between the work required by both.  Furthermore, because of the mod community being an actual community, people discuss to make their mods compatibles with others. They adopt certain methods of implementation that will make their items work with other stuff.   Once you go paid, you don't really have to give a shit about others, actually, its in your best interest that your mod isn't compatible with others if it is more popular, and then you can release your own version of other mods that are compatible with yours.

Devs were free to make products with it, and if they monetized it, they did not have to kick anything back to Epic until their sales hit a certain threshold.  Freely distributed games were never a problem.  Perhaps this could help to keep everyone happy, although it doesn't address the issues of quality control and stopping the shit-tier cash grab mods that would flood the market."

This is just a way to monetize a previously unexploited section of the gaming public.    Bethesda could force this through, and they would probably even see a profit.  I'm betting they see a major loss of good will though.    As you say, I'm sure a number of the modders have paypal accounts and donate buttons, maybe even patreon nowadays.

If modding was a significant factor in the sales do you not think that games like Skyrim and Fallout would have a disproportionately large sales share on PC relative to consoles? The estimates puts only slightly higher on PC than games like Bioshock Infinite, Tomb Raider, Borderlands, most of the other big releases. It's more likely that's due to double sales from legendary edition, but even then it's insignificant.   Where are all the people who binarily buy for the modding? If they represented a significant part of the consumer base, why is not reflected in the sales? Don't get me wrong, I'm all about the modding too, but any of the games I have modded, I would likely have bought if mods didn't exist. Is hat not common sense too?

Even if that means you only give $0.50 from those stupid trading cards you've been selling, it's still money in the pockets of the creators. (Speaking of which, the split they used was ridiculous. Minimum 75% needs to go to the content creator.)  It would also be nice to have a ""Mods queue"" where you can see your recently installed mods and review them / donate to them.   It's not a perfect system, but unless modders are prepared to set up customer support, offer refunds, stay on top of compatibility patches both with the official game and with other mods, and all the other things customers expect from a paid service, it must remain a donation based system."

If the % for Bethesda was any lower it wouldn't be worth it. If Valve changes their rate it might make things complicated on their end (which is something a storefront doesn't need). Modders are 'earning' a variable rate more than their old 0%, so I don't see the problem. You're sidestepping a lot of contractual problems and get to be seen. That's amazing. And who knows, down the line they may open a program so that true talent could get recruited. That could create a whole new little sub market for gaming.  A lot of the concerns gamers are speaking of are just downright silly. The paid mods weren't scrapped because they weren't liked, they were pulled because the plan isn't even finished. I'm sure they are still working on it with the feedback given by the community and I applaud them for it.  Sometimes you just have to take a leap of faith. If people don't like the end result it will be changed anyway, so again, I don't see the problem. Just wait and see how this turns out."

Furthermore, unlike TF2/DOTA2 skins, our work goes in the hundreds if not thousands of hours spend. The current steam workshop system works because it's skins. All you do is make a skin for an existing weapon, you don't have to do animations, all you have to do is make sure it's really cool, high quality texture. That take time, yes, but I've actually made skins that have been sold of TF2 when I was in that part of learning that took me less than 10 hours of work.   The reason why it failed was because it was receiving no support from the modding community. 2 mods from the 11 released were taken down because otherwise they were gonna be DMCAd, they were using assets from other mods without asking for permission (Art of the Catch was using fishing animation from another mod, the thief one was using meshes for hair from another mod, and the voice actress agreed on a free contract, the contract becomes null and void when you stat making money). There are no mods that were made by a single person. Some of the biggest mods were made by content/texture packs done by animators/3d artists, backbone rework done by groups like SKSE, integration of the implemented changes to the game and UI by programmers. It's huge, communal work. Nobody does everything on their own, it's too long, too time consuming. I think Falskaar was done by a single guy and it took him 2600 hours of coding, and he used content/texture packs from other modders, used free voice actors, etc... If you start charging, you gotta start splitting that money to those other people, as well.  Valve and B$ did just that, they took a leap of faith and got burned. I'd say now that the modding community recovered, but after all the debacle, there was a complete staling of mod development on nexus mod. We lost about a third of our content/texture makers, which would make new swords and what not for other people to integrate in the game."

Obviously those people who worked on the patch would like to be paid for their effort, yet Bethesda feels they not only deserve a chunk of that, they deserve the largest chunk.  Let's make this clear, this is literally charging money for a bug fix patch. People make jokes all the time about how they expect EA to start releasing patches as paid DLC, but this is what actually did/would happen when it came to Skyrim's paid mods. If all of the money was going to the people who made the patch then I would be fine with it, but I'll be damned if I'm going to give Bethesda money for a community made patch that fixed shit they couldn't be bothered to touch before abandoning all development for the game."

Bethesda deserve every sent they earned in sales, not in modding. If Bethesda goes and develops a continuing support system for modding akin to Nexus or Steam Workshop, sure they can charge for access to that (as a modder or customer) but 45% is way too much.  I can't fault a studio for charging for a game or for modding tools that aren't part of the game, but I will certainly do so for attempting to profit off of other peoples' (non-employees) labor.  Edit: Let me add, the 45/30/25 split would have been between Bethesda, Valve, and the modder. Presumably for the mod to be listed and sold through the Steam Workshop. Bethesda claimed they deserved 45% for doing no additional work, merely ""allowing"" the mod to be listed and sold."

Let me quote myself:     I can't fault a studio for charging ... for modding tools that aren't part of the game   If that's insufficient, I'll share some of my personal history re. modding.  I participated in the Skyrim modding community (through Nexus) as a user. There were a large number of interesting, creative mods available. A number of those used the official (free) mod tools. A much smaller number did not, requiring additional tools e.g. SKSE. I used maybe 50 mods (mainly from the latter category) to alter the way the game played and have a new experience. I did not purchase any DLC, nor did I donate to any of the mods. I know they took much time to make, but they were officially free, and I took that deal. Had the mods cost money, I would have either ignored them or been far more critical of the experience offered.  I participate in the GTAV PC modding community as a creator. I have three released mods (and more I'd like to make) that actually do stuff (aren't texture replacements.) I maintain and enhance them where possible. There are no tools from Rockstar. Rockstar has taken numerous actions that either directly or indirectly make PC modding difficult (likely to preserve the online component and possible revenue from it.) Actions like referring to the in-game functions using pseudorandom numbers instead of legible names. Modders have to guess, infer, and work from context to document the functions. Every bit of knowledge about modding has been discovered by the users. I have spent many hours (200+ I suspect) researching this knowledge, discovering more, and applying it to my mods. I do not ask for donations. I do not have donation buttons on my mods' pages. I do not expect to make any money from my efforts. I do not expect to be attributed should someone use my mods to create something popular. I create because I love the game, enjoy the challenge, and want to make something cool."

I remember modding Oblivion and F3 and if you install certain mods it can destroy the fps, not a huge issue on a decent PC but on a limited console it would make many mods just not work.  I think console players imagine they'll see all the cool stuff that Skyrim modders were able to do without understanding they can't, there is no way they will allow code injection mods like script extenders or ultra hi detail texture to come so I don't understand what they are expecting to be allowed through."
Games,3dltxo,DundonianStalin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:37:48 2015 UTC,"Mods for consoles will, likely, be the same as ""skins"" of the past.  It will be texture replacements. Instead of walking around with dogmeat now you get to walk around with a dogmeat that looks like a Ninja Turtle"
Games,3dltxo,contrabandwidth,6,Fri Jul 17 13:55:00 2015 UTC,"Even that would be limited because of video memory on the XB, why would PC modders limit themselves to the texture resolution and poly limit of the console when there's no such restrictions on the PC beyond optimisation.  It's a nice idea and if they can pull it off then brilliant but I remember the last game that has this ability (Just Cause 2, though not native) was extremely limited."

Games,3dltxo,Fallens218,20,Fri Jul 17 11:41:53 2015 UTC,They're not going to announce or talk about it before the game is released due to how much controversy surrounds it. They don't want to reduce the hype or tarnish the image before they've even sold the game to people.
Games,3dltxo,DarknessAnOldFriend,3,Fri Jul 17 13:30:27 2015 UTC,"I think that part of their problem here is that if they want to implement this kind of feature, they really HAVE to announce it before the game's launch. If they announce it shortly after release then they'll simply piss off their customer base anyway and, if done within two weeks of launch, might actually see a fair amount of Steam refunds  If they do it further down the line they'd run into the same problem that Skyrim had, in that it'd be interfering with an established modding community"

Like /r/Dota2 they wanted people to vote for 1 character for a model update that character never made it past first round voting and it happened again and again untill the charcter who got it was one that didnt need it.

It just has to be handled very carefully.   One big issue - my main issue really - with the Skyrim mods was the fact that Skyrim was, frankly, broken in many ways. Modders made the core game better, which is why that mod community is so highly respected. The extra stuff - high res horse genitals and all that random shit - was just that, extra stuff, which is fine... but they were profiting from the goodwill created by the people who helped to fix Bethesda's wonky coding and design choices.  I'm not saying modders who make extra content for games don't deserve to be paid for it, but the Skyrim modding community was a bit different. There was definitely two different sorts of modders at play here, and one group was more hungry for profit than the other.  But as you say, the system itself was stupid, unfair and anti-consumer. They put little thought into its execution."

Games,3dltxo,DeltaSparky,4,Fri Jul 17 19:03:11 2015 UTC,"Doesn't feel right to me still. I always considered mods to be passion projects and practice for aspiring developers to get their feet wet.   Plus we already saw how fast people jumped to protect their own stuff, with loads of mods that used other modders assets cutting them out. For Elder Scrolls atleast it's always been a community thing."
Games,3dltxo,Elementium,5,Fri Jul 17 18:35:00 2015 UTC,"This was my opinion in the /r/pcgaming thread.   If Bethesda wants to have paid mods, they have to take the mod in house, pay royalties, sell it as DLC - maybe as packs, and support it so that updates don't break them and they don't have mod incompatibilities with other paid mods. Put a price on something and you expect support and you expect them to just work with the paid products. Somewhat similar to how Valve does with community maps in CSGO and TF2.   Mods are wildcards in compatibility which should not be the case for a paid product. If they want to have paid mods which conflict with each other, they need to have a better built in mod manager that would flag and prevent conflicts of the mods they have adopted and can now manage. Paid mods should never lead to the game crashing. Their system should detect conflicts and prevent launching the game. If someone installs open market mods then there's nothing Bethesda can do, but if they're selling the mods, Bethesda should be expected to support it properly. If a mod is to be paid for, an update to the base game should never break it and it should be comptatible with any future game expansion which doesn't sound possible unless Bethesda takes over development of mods as Bethesda DLC.   The way they tried to monetize mods was lazy. So many mods that are sold not by the original creator or using someone elses content in their mod without permission. Paid mods with no curation is a horrible idea. You'll get a bunch of people ripping others off."
Games,3dltxo,MythicalBacon,14,Fri Jul 17 20:55:11 2015 UTC,"At the end, the whole paid mods in Skyrim was done terribly. I do not think the standard game industry 45-30-25 model would work for modders because modders mod games as a hobby, not a full time job. The way that Steam distributes the fees to modders is fairly ridiculous too with the money deposited into Steam wallet. I think it is a good initiative, it is awfully implemented. Modders deserve to get paid for their work, especially high quality mods that rivals or outdone the developer's work.  IMO, I think there is one game that does it correctly so far that benefits both developers, community and modders. Assetto Corsa does paid mods in a different way where the developers, Kunos, contract modelling and various art to talented modders to finish it. A typical car in a modern racing game takes 2 to 6 months to complete so the developers will save some of their modeller's time as AC's team is pretty small. Kunos only has 18 people in their studio so far while most racing games studio, like Slightly Mad Studio has 120 or Turn 10 has 400+ employees. So outsourcing modelling work to talented mod teams make a lot of sense for them.  The first Assetto Corsa's DLC was released with at least one car, Corvette C7R being built by modders. The Corvette C7R car model is made by a mod team, United Race Designs who had been doing stellar mods for some time where Kunos paid them a straight up payment in exchange for the use of that car model in the game. I think the DLC's Nissan GTR GT3 is also made by the same mod team. Interestingly, the same C7R model was released as a free mod in another racing game called rFactor 2. Assetto Corsa's developers, Kunos, had also contracted modelling work to other mod teams, like the upcoming Lamborghini Countach is being made by the GTR2 Power and Glory mod team and another Shelby Cobra mod by the_meco was patched into the core game as official content last year.   At the end, the modding community in AC was not fragmented like Skyrim's awfully done paid mods. Modders still could release their work for free while the talented ones are being rewarded with a contracting work for the developer and gain professional experience by working with a real developer. At the same time, the developer is still making money via DLCs with development time saved. Gamers, on the other hand, still getting new content via DLCs and I think AC's DLCs are quite reasonably priced.  I know Microsoft did hire the team who did Forgotten Ages expansion mod for Age of Empires 2 to port the old Essemble games to Steam which it was mostly beneficial to everyone. Relic, the developer of Company of Heroes and Dawn of War had also helped some of the best mods from Company on Heroes 1 to get on Steam as an official mod. Mod teams needs professional endorsement from publishers and developers so that they could further pursue their career in games industry. Not putting a beautifully modeled sword as a $2 paid mod which I doubt it will help the modder in gaining a position in game industry much.  If it were up to me, I think Skyrim or Fallout 4 mods should be done in a way where Bethesda converts some of the best content of the modding scene, like how Skyrim's Falskaar could easily be a full DLC into official content. At the same time, Bethesda could offer the best modders in the community with consultations on some of the difficult to solve bugs, some art assets or voice acting that is more difficult to find in modding scene. Instead of the awful paid mods that Skyrim has. I wont complain if Falskaar becomes another official DLC with professional polish and voice acting."

Beth and Valve decided to unravel something that didn't need to be unraveled. They saw an untapped revenue stream and decided to cash in. I may be sympathetic to modders getting a little cash for their stuff, but the big guys are just using this as a shield for their real intentions.   Bethesda would still expect to get a cut of the revenue   Of course. Compare this to the $0 they were getting before."

Games,3dltxo,yaosio,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"I believe that a big part of why a modder today can become so popular is because the mods they made were free to begin with.  There is a hint of selfishness, in my mind, for a popular modder to subsequently demand payment.  ""Paid mods"" is a useful trojan horse for a publisher to throw out because the concept of being paid for effort is seemingly a logical one.  But quite frankly, given mods have been free up to this point, monetary reward has never been the primary goal of a modder.  A secondary goal perhaps, with paywalls, ads and donations, but no guaranteed money.  It's true that modding has indeed helped some games have much longer lifespans than first-envisaged.  I think it's true that some modders would be able to make more and/or better mods if they were compensated for their efforts (although it doesn't mean they will once compensated).  But the most obvious thing to do then, surely, is for the publishers and/or developers to compensate the modders?  Something like Bethesda paying the modders who make the most popular mods or have proven to be devoted members of the community, or by hiring them for small, short-term contracts to make their mods better.  Or something like for every X thousand downloads your mod gets, you get $1 credit in some virtual store so you can get cheaper games in the future.  Paid mods are nothing more than the publisher or developer trying to get the customer to pay for it (and them getting a bonus cut) - but this has consequences (i.e. quality control, patch compatibility, being flooded with low-effort cash grabs, copyright concerns, loss of mod experimentation, etc.).  Whether the consequences are worth it or not - when a profit-making company is involved, for some reason I doubt the moral questions will be answered."

""It's sort of like having the world's largest ball of yarn and deciding you're going to unravel it"" -- Hines ""Our belief is, 'We made the game, we made the game you're making a thing for.' So just like anything else, there is some kind of involvement that we're going to have in that,"" he said.   I think they could adjust the percentage a little bit more to favor the modders.   Last time:   Bethesda - 45 percent  Valve - 30 percent  Modders - 25 percent   What I would prefer contributing toward:   Bethesda - 15 percent  Valve - 10 percent  Modders - 75 percent   If I'm being more realistic, maybe 20% to Bethesda, 15% to Valve, and 65% to Modders but that's as low as I would want to go.  I know myself and many others only ever bought a second copy of Skyrim (after having it on console) to experience mods. If there were a way to track how many bought a PC copy exclusively because of mods, I think you'd find a number that suggests Bethesda has already made enough money off of modders' hard work.   45% to Bethesda when the mod author only gets 25% just seems greedy, unless Bethesda is going to handle all of the troubleshooting for the mod.

When there's so many great options for small-time game developers to make their own thing independent of a game (i.e. not a mod) with free development tools, and get rewarded for it, why would they stick around? Why should SureAI make their TCs on top of Bethesda's greatest, when it's probably not too big a push to go fully independent.  The distinction I see is the foundation mods are built upon, both the game world and in the specific case of Bethesda's games the tools to make the kind of game they do (quests, scripting, the ability to inject content into the existing game). Big ambitious mods can probably go their own way, but smaller mods (either modifying something already in the game or layering something new on top of the game) wouldn't go away, but then again no one would pay for a ""sword of icy apocalypse"" mod anyway."

Apparently engines like Unity, Unreal, and IdTech all run delta time and various loop methods.    All common engines support arbitrary framerates as far as I am aware, and it seems extremely shortsighted and silly to design your engine not to because it's really not much more work.   It's not a matter if the engine can do it, it's a matter of the developers and publishers choosing graphics over gameplay.   This doesn't make sense on PC though. We don't have fixed hardware, one persons 30fps could be another 300.

When an engine says it supports distinct physics simulation rates, that doesn't necessarily mean all of what is needed for gameplay. Physics simulators are often independent of what you might think of when you are talking about things like Mario running along, picking up speed, jumping, falling, etc. since such interactions frequently don't follow a real-world idea of physics. Under normal circumstances, you will have some kind of act function for all of your objects (actors) which you'll be running regularly... usually as frequently as you are rendering frames, but in some games it runs more regularly than that. I've heard it said that the Forza games run 360 simulations of the driving mechanics per second while the game renders at what I would guess to be 30.

Well, suppose you have your physics/mechanics targeting its own independent framerate and suppose that framerate is 60 while the graphics frames themselves are unbound. What happens when your framerate climbs above 60?  Well, for a while you start having aliasing... suppose your framerate is 90 for instance... you hit your rendering cycle after the first frame is processed, then 2/3rds of the way into the next physics frame being processed you are ready for another rendering cycle, but nothing has changed. Do you want to render again anyway? There's no point to it, but if you do you'll have another physics frame ready shortly after you finish rendering the first physics frame a second time. You'll start seeing some frames being rendered twice while some are rendered once and this leads to an effect much like the judder seen when doing 2:3 pulldown between 24hz and 60hz framerates (playing a 24hz recorded movie when you are watching on a TV that only does 60hz video).  That's why a lot of games tie the physics rate to the rendering rate and simply render each frame once the physics processing for that frame is done. If they still want framerate to be independent of the action speed of the game, they'll have their physics/mechanics simulation take the time between frames into account... so if 100ms has elapsed between a frame, a character will be moved twice as far during that frame as they would if 50ms had elapsed.  Of course, this can get complex when considering aspects of the physics simulation... if enough time passes between frames, the player can essentially be teleporting large distances and if you don't account for that, they could walk right though certain small obstacles.  So yeah, there are a lot of complexities that rise out of decoupling the mechanics from the rendering framerate. It's not always as simple as 'get better programmers'."
Games,3drj7o,DeeDoubs,4,Sun Jul 19 00:22:08 2015 UTC,"When an engine says it supports...   Yes, thats all basically repeating what I said ""or if they don't, support running as a separate thread at a fixed framerate so while physics simulation is fixed your rendering and other systems don't need to be.""   What happens when your framerate climbs above 60? Well, for a while you start having aliasing   I didn't say it was a perfect solution, but it is better than being capped at 30. I'd take a little juddering from temporal aliasing over crippling input latency any day.   The thing about framerates is that there are diminishing returns as you go up, once you get above 125 fps (lowest rate for USB polling) it's all very small differences from there. The thing is, 30 FPS is the BARE MINIMUM spec. To be honest if developers were writing thier games with fixed framerates of 125fps I doubt pretty much anyone would have a problem with it (well, except the people who couldn't run it at 125 fps and got slow motion games). The problem really isn't so much the fact that framerates are fixed, it's that they are fixed WAY TOO FUCKING LOW. A 60fps cap isn't ideal but I think most would find it an acceptable compromise. A 125fps cap would be a good one, it gives you that USB polling sync, there are negligible improvements above that in terms of smoothness and input latency and it means you can do stuff like run freesync/gsync on a 144Hz monitor to full benefit without gimping your framerate or worrying about hitting the cap and getting vsync delays or tearing."
Games,3drj7o,jojotmagnifficent,3,Sun Jul 19 01:15:18 2015 UTC,"Oh hey, I agree, a 60fps target is what should be the standard if you are going to bind mechanics to the framerate. It only makes sense given that it's the standard refresh rate of most monitors, and for a very good reason... as anyone who has ever dealth with mouse motion in 30fps should be able to attest."

Games,3drj7o,kalnaren,2,Sun Jul 19 03:17:56 2015 UTC,"Apparently engines like Unity, Unreal, and IdTech all run delta time and various loop methods.    As i mentioned on the other thread, i'm not sure which idTech you have in mind, but Doom 3 (idTech 4) seems to use fixed time steps at 60Hz. This method is called from the main loop to update the game state right before rendering happens. The actual update loop happens at line 2720 at the end of the function (most of the above is figuring out how many times the game needs to be updated). Also note that com_ticNumber is a volatile variable that is increased at a 60Hz rate from another thread and the lines around 2587 use it to lock the main thread at 60Hz (or less, depending on the minTic value which normally is just lastTime + 1).  Interestingly this also means that Doom 3 is locked at 60 FPS because of that loop. Although removing the loop wouldn't change anything if the game updates at 60Hz (except perhaps choking the timer update thread :-P). The whole engine seems to be set around fixed 60Hz updates."
Games,3drj7o,badsectoracula,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:39:26 2015 UTC,"Locking code to graphics doesn't  make the graphics better or the frame rate worse,  it has nothing to do with ""barely hitting 30,720, or 60 FOV"" is just easier code, especially when working with console because you have no reason to go above 30 if that's the frame rate the game runs at"

I don't know what happened after that as I left.  Seems like they didn't make it too far though or the project fell apart for other reasons.

Games,3dmfd8,Kintobar,9,Fri Jul 17 13:31:23 2015 UTC,"I've been playing this for the last couple of days. It's pretty fun card game. There's some room for improvement, but the core mechanic is solid.   Protips:  Bruiser->Barbarian and Apprentice->Alchemist are the two better classes. The other two trees so far are a bit meh.  Expanding the Loot tree is how you get stronger in the field, since that gives you stronger equipment drops. Pick one class to buy, then buy all the Loot options before buying more classes/blessings.  How equipment works is that the characters have skill trees (Fire, Armor, Holy, Arcane, etc) that all start out at 0 and with each point on a piece of equipment you get a point and a progressively stronger card in a tree/trees. So if you've got Arcane I, Arcane II and Arcane I on three different pieces, you're at the max of Arcane IV and get four cards, the strongest of which gives you three health and two draw. So you want to pick a couple of trees and max them out each play.  You can farm gold, if you really need to, by staying on one of the maps without the time limit at level 4 and just dropping a monster and a level 3 gem, cleaning that, picking the gold option, then doing it again.  If you're in one of those maps where the boss is coming at you two spaces at a time and you're running away from it one space at a time, if it's in a corridor, you can actually put monsters in front of it to make it move one space at a time as well, giving you time to get good gear."

Having first strike on every physical attack pretty much overrides a lot of the difficulty. You can beat level 2 enemies right at the start with no loot or levels gained.  Everything else you've said is pretty solid.   Edit: Game is great btw, and I'm having a lot of fun with it."

Games,3djsj9,alphageek8,65,Fri Jul 17 01:33:24 2015 UTC,"Okay so, here's my personal guide to what to watch at EVO 2015. Some Kappa might leak.   USF4 is stacked this year and there's a lot of drama and new blood involved. Last year's winner was a french Rose player named Luffy. He won versus Bonchan's Sagat after a bracket reset (yes, we still have those because fuck e-sports). Along the way, he won versus a lot of killers in the loser's bracket: Momochi, Gackt, Snake Eyez, Fuudo... Oh, he won the whole thing using a fucking PSX pad!  Anyway, a lot of people been calling Luffy overrated (shoutouts to K-Brad) and said he won because nobody played Rose back then so nobody knew the match-up. If you watch the replay, Bonchan was super clueless about the matchup. Japanese players were trying to coach him and UK's own Ryan Hart was translating what they said to Luffy without them realizing what was going on.  This also lead to a 10k moneymatch FT10 happening on Sunday 11am on Madcatz stream, between Luffy and Santarouman, a Sagat japonese player. Santarou isn't that strong and personally I believe that this is free to Luffy but you never know what will happen at EVO.  But enough of last years. A lot of players have come through this year and you should be on the look for them.    Mago, a japanese Yang player finally decided to play and win tournaments. He's the #1 on CPT's standing right now after winning SEAM 2015, the most stacked tournament of the year, and. He got 17th at EVO's 2014. Kazunoko, a japanese Yun player that was kinda slept on. He's won some majors and was recently picked up by Zeveron. He's #4 on CPT and he's a favorite to take the whole thing. He placed 13th last year. 801 Strider, an Abel player that placed 2nd at CEO and made a lot of upsets. He was recently picked up by Winterfox. He's also a B U F F B O Y. Smug, because this is the year. While I don't think he will take this, he will make a lot of upsets. His matches are also super hype. Hopefully he learned how to fucking block.   USF4 is all day on friday. Last year, they fucked up and we had to rely on people on twitter and on commentary to give us match results and watched a lot of salty losses on YouTube because EVO only had one stream (thanks McRibs). This year, we will have two streams but personally I think a lot of great matches won't see any stream time. Most importantly, expect blowups. It's the best part of friday. There's nothing better than watching an upset.  But real wrap, fuck sleep fighter 4. It's M A H V E L time baby. In case you've been on a coma for all these years, or you've never been exposed to the true light of hype, let me tell you about this shit. This game is broken. But it's fun to play and watch. It is also dead, because Capcom's license expired and they can't patch or sell the game anymore. Last year, the winner was Justin Wong over Chris G. It was remarkable because Justin hid his tech until GFs and surprised Chris.   Marvel is a game that people are now in a very late stage. It's the stage where players do the refinement of their game. People stopped whining about Vergil and learned how to deal with it. Doom is still overpowered but players are used to it by now. Mixups are dirtier than ever. New blood is on the scene. Old fools stepped up their game. Gods aren't so dominant anymore.  That being said, personally I think this is Chris G's year. He only got 3rd at CEO 2015 but he's super smart and I think that if he stopped messing around with fucking League of Legends and grinded the lab he can take this.  Players to look for, as always, are Justin, FChamp, Jan, Clockw0rk (clock pls BabyRage), Rayray, Flux, Cloud, Yipes, etc. You probably know who they are by now.  A player that should give players a run for their money is CEO 2015 champion Full Schedule. He plays C.Viper/Doom/Amy and he uses a stick that is a hybrid between a stick and a hitbox. There was a lot of drama around it last year, at Final Round 17 (if you got the time, check the matches), and if I remember correctly he couldn't use his stick at EVO 2014, but now it's legal. He's really hype and puts in the work. If there's somebody that I would bet is going to make upsets, it's him.  That's it for me for main events. I'll probably watch MKX because I love Aris but I don't care that much. I think SonicFox will take it. PerfectLegend is a ducking bitch. Get blown up by Spooky. Hold that L. Hopefully Lord Tom Brady will get top 16 and we will get more audio clips in the soundboard.  For side events, I'll probably watch Skullgirls, KoF 13, CvS2 and some T7 on Saturday. If Yatagarasu sees some stream time, i'll be there too.  Oh but wait, it's not over yet. There's a lot going on after hours. It's pretty much a tradition to have salty suites. They're hotel rooms where people plays money match, play casuals, get fucked up and we, stream monsters, watch get hype and have laughs. It's part of the EVO experience and I definitely recommend it.   RedBull is having a really fancy one for SF4 and Melee. SF4 is going to happen at Art's channel and I recommend you guys to check it out.  Last time I checked, Team USA is facing off against Team Japan in Marvel. It's going to be Friday after SF4 at bifuteki's channel.  There are probably a lot more but you know how people are. You should keep an eye on Twitter, /r/StreetFighter, /r/MvC3 and /r/Kappa.   tldr: shinakuma666 eliminates daigo, melee takes 3 hours over time to finish, europe gets bodied on their sleep schedule again, combofiend goes on stage before marvel finals to announce tvc2."

Games,3djsj9,SchizoTheWorst,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:03 2015 UTC,Catherine is dope. The messing with opponents and the people trying to speedrun it adds some hype.
Games,3djsj9,Sweetnsaur,-2,Sat Jul 18 06:57:31 2015 UTC,I'm more weirded out to see Smash being such a big presence. Like a third of the registered players are for Smash (although I guess the overlap between the two versions is huge).
Games,3djsj9,vattenpuss,14,Fri Jul 17 09:24:59 2015 UTC,"The overlap isn't that huge.  A lot of Melee players dislike Smash 4 and a lot of Smash 4 players have never played Melee.  I don't recall the exact numbers, but the overlap is smaller than the SF4/MvC3 overlap."
Games,3djsj9,ifiposttellmetostop,3,Fri Jul 17 12:43:39 2015 UTC,Just over 500 players are overlapped.
Games,3djsj9,GogglesTheFox,0,Fri Jul 17 17:55:41 2015 UTC,Keep in mind that there are people that registered for both.
Games,3djsj9,Statisticc,5,Fri Jul 17 09:49:36 2015 UTC,"Fucking hype! As a LONG time (20+ years) Street Fighter fan, I've been in and out of the scene competitively, and EVO is my favorite major gaming event every year, no questions asked. I've met some GREAT people though the scene. Show them some love!"
Games,3djsj9,Trashboat77,15,Fri Jul 17 01:53:43 2015 UTC,"It's the first year I'll really be focusing on it, and I'm looking forward to it. I'll mainly stick to Smash, but if I've got time I'll try and see a bunch of other games too. A little disappointed that Smash 4's on Saturday rather than Sunday, but I guess 2 Smash games is a little much and I kinda feel like Melee's ""earned"" it more."
Games,3djsj9,zellisgoatbond,27,Thu Jul 16 21:15:43 2015 UTC,"I'd recommend checking out the top 8 for each game if you can, even if you don't know the game. I just happened to watch BlazBlue on Sunday last year, which turned out to be the most exciting finals of Evo (imo). The schedule is set up in such away that no top 8's overlap, so you should be able to catch them without missing too much of anything else."
Games,3djsj9,Cynicallity,9,Thu Jul 16 23:07:39 2015 UTC,I've never watched or played BlazBlue before but that Top 8 was the most amazing esports finals I've ever seen.

I may watch some of the other fighters even though I don't play them as much.  This is going to be a big year for Melee. It's a bit of a toss-up between a few of the top players for who takes it. A lot of people are rooting for Mango to take home his third EVO in a row, but Leffen and Armada look like they could easily take it home too.  I'm rooting for Hbox since it's his last hurrah before he cuts back his Smash time to focus on his career. It's a little more of a stretch for him to win but I think he's got it in him."
Games,3djsj9,Un0va,7,Fri Jul 17 02:06:08 2015 UTC,"Can't count out PPMD, who came down from recluse several months ago to win Apex. Although HungryBox winning would be a fitting ending to his upcoming semi-retirement, the slew of foxes will be extremely difficult. I hope he plays out of his mind and clinches a high placing though. Not enough Puff representation near the top."
Games,3djsj9,PutNameHere,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:59:03 2015 UTC,I haven't been following PPMD as much but I know people are getting hyped for him too.  Hbox definitely has an uphill climb ahead of him but I could see him getting top 4 for sure. As far as winning altogether yeah the Fox players at the top are going to be unbelievable but I'll be rooting for him either way.  It's always interesting when someone in the top 8 plays an underrepresented character. Fox dittos are always hype as hell just for the speed but Puff changes everything. Plus his Rests are hype as hell.

Games,3djsj9,Teenbasketballstar,7,Mon Jul 20 06:53:45 2015 UTC,"Well, the overlap from Melee to 4 is a lot larger than 4 to Melee. I don't mean to start the whole skill argument again, but I think we can agree that 4 has a lot less game-exclusive tech skill than Melee, where knowledge of things like wavedashing and l-cancelling are necessary to compete.  In comparison, Melee players who are impartial to 4 will still play because they can still play and have the possibility to win, even without devotion of effort away from their main game. This doesn't even factor in reasons like ease of switching from old to new rather than vice versa."
Games,3djsj9,ElfieStar,7,Fri Jul 17 00:15:34 2015 UTC,"While this is true, most Melee fans don't care about Smash 4 and would rather focus on one game. Mr. Wizard himself even said that the crossover from each game isn't as big as you would think."
Games,3djsj9,TheGoldenSSTicket,2,Fri Jul 17 10:57:57 2015 UTC,"The difference in entrants doesn't have much to do with technical skill, but more to do with accessibility. Melee is much more difficult to play as you need the game ($50), a GameCube/Wii, and a CRT. Melee players can always direct you to the nearest thrift shop. Even installing 20XX is a large barrier for many people. Smash 4 was just released and is owned by practically everyone with a Wii U. It is even played by many people with no interest in playing competitively."

Games,3djsj9,alphageek8,2,Thu Jul 16 21:45:08 2015 UTC,I thought Tekken was much more popular. Are the low numbers due to people not wanting to compete on a lesser known entry or am I out of touch and people don't like Tekken that much?
Games,3djsj9,Dudensen,22,Thu Jul 16 22:06:03 2015 UTC,This Evo actually has the highest number of entrants for a Tekken game ever.
Games,3djsj9,neurosx,4,Thu Jul 16 23:32:33 2015 UTC,I don't follow the tekken scene but from what I know it's a mix of things. Like the number of tekken entrants has been slowly declining for EVO but maybe that's because Final Round is the bigger Tekken major. Some people are saying that they are 'dumbing down' T7 and making it more noob-friendly. And maybe there's low numbers at EVO because no one wants to compete at a game they don't know yet.
Games,3djsj9,iamnotapenguin,5,Fri Jul 17 01:29:25 2015 UTC,I guess the fact that the game isn't even out on consoles yet has a lot to do with it.

Games,3djsj9,homer_3,2,Fri Jul 17 02:01:09 2015 UTC,Tekken is hugely popular in arcades but it's never really been that big in the west.

The move lists aren't that different from most fighters and their inputs are pretty lenient.  I'd put Melee or Marvel as one of the hardest to play. Melee requires consistent, extremely fast, and extremely difficult technical skill to play. For Marvel it's llike, you either play perfectly or you lose."
Games,3djsj9,barrierstobridges,1 point,Sat Jul 18 07:58:43 2015 UTC,The problem is that Japan has had Tekken 7 for a pretty long time in Arcades and the only way anyone in America had a chance to even try it was by travelling to a very select few places that have Arcade cabinets.  Tekken 7 is basically going to be Asian players completely dominating.

KoF13 had a good three year run at Evo but unfortunately the amount of plays has steadily dropped for it over time due to a multitude of factors (zero developer support, balance issues, game difficulty, and the games age are some of them).  KoF14 could probably see the return of KoF at Evo but at the moment the developer (SNK Playmore) seems to have a lot of money issues so sadly we might never see it."

Games,3djsj9,GogglesTheFox,12,Fri Jul 17 01:11:51 2015 UTC,Evo side tournament turnouts for Skullgirls hasn't been the best last year was pretty low with around 140 entrants so it doesn't make a main event cut where the lowest is 397. It still has a side tournament this year with a $1000 pot bonus. But Even without two smash games I can't see Skullgirls being next on the list over Blazblue(508 last year) or KoFXIII(319 last year).

Games,3djsj9,LyfeBlades,8,Fri Jul 17 04:21:39 2015 UTC,"Melee: This is going to be the most exciting Melee tournament, possibly in history. For almost the whole of Melee history, a single player or two will dominate the entire scene. Usually people would know who was likely to win before a tournament started and upsets were rare. The game is just VERY skill stratified.    However, this year, there are FOUR people who could take the whole thing home, plus one dark horse threat. Each of them have a really cool narrative.    Mango - The Self-Proclaimed Greatest of All Time (GOAT), Mango has won the last two Evos. If he gets the ThreEvo, his claim will be solidified. Known for his brash, aggressive play and charismatic trash talk, Mango has at the top of the Melee game for almost seven years now. But it looks like people finally have his number, and he hasn't won a tournament with more than one top player there in almost a year. Can the aging veteran pull out one last win to cement his title as the GOAT?    Armada - The Beast, The Swedish Sniper, the only player with an all time record to rival Mango's, Armada dominated the Smash scene from 2011 to 2013, when he retired on top. He returned to the game in 2014, to prove that he was still the best, and while he dominated at lesser tournaments, he choked at every major. If he can win at EVO, he will cement himself as at least equal to Mango as the Best of All Time (BOAT).    Armada is known for his unbelievable consistency - he hasn't lost to a non top five player since 2010 - and his brutal brutal punish game - if he hits you once, he'll kill you dead. He's going in as the number one seed, but can he clutch it out this time?      PPMD - PP has spent the better part of the last two years battling crippling anxiety and depression issues. As such, he's been largely absent from the Smash community, attending only six tournaments since 2014 - winning four. After a six month hiatus, he came out of nowhere in January to sweep to victory at Apex, the largest Melee tournament of all time. No one has seen him since.    A major wild card, PPMD is known for his outstanding ability to adapt to his opponents, download their tendencies, and just make them look utterly helpless as he anticipates their every move. He's proven he can beat any player in the world, but can he overcome himself? If he wins EVO, he'll be the undisputed number one player in the world.    Leffen - Until 2015, no player outside of the five gods (the three players above plus Hbox and M2K) had ever won an American major tournament. Until Leffen. The villain. The heel. The Vegeta of Smash, spiky hair included. The Godslayer - the first player outside of the five gods to defeat all five gods in tournament - Leffen represents the new guard of Smash. And he's just won the last two majors in a row, making Armada and Mango look like push overs. Leffen is coming into Evo looking unstoppable.        His play is brutally efficient and fast. He just melts away opponent's stocks in the quickest and safest way possible, and looks utterly dominant. But his win streak is still fresh, and he's coming off of a six month slump. If he can win at Evo, it will mark the end of the era of the gods, and the beginning of a new one - the Era of Leffen.    Hungrybox - The Dark Horse. The Floridian Jigglypuff player has been a top five player for many years, despite playing a character that in any other player's hands gets completely destroyed by Fox, by far the most common character in today's meta. Because of his character choice, Hbox has to work INCREDIBLY hard to keep up with the other top players - a single mistake which would cost most players just a few percentage points will often cost Hbox a whole life or even a whole game. But Hbox is really really good at not making mistakes, and last year, in a huge upset destroyed the Evo bracket, rolling all the way to second place.    Hbox is known for his impeccable spacing, insane mental fortitude, and brutal punish game. But in order to win, he'll need to overcome a huge gauntlet of Fox players, including Leffen and Armada. When Hbox is on fire he can destroy all of them, but if he's off even a little bit he'll make an early tournament exit.    And then there's Mango. Mango is Hbox's wall. His mountain. His Everest. Hbox has played Mango more than 20 times. He has only won 2 of them. Hbox took Mango to last stock, last hit game 5 Grand Finals last year. He's announced that EVO 2015 is his final tournament before he retires to pursue his engineering career - can he finally take down his nemesis on the biggest stage there is?    I think all of these stories would make a good sports movie. Melee top 8 should be a really really good watch."

In Smash 4 this guy called ZeRo is currently undefeated and we're looking for who will finally take him out. Currently in a good position is Nario the Zero Suit Samus, ESAM the Pikachu, and Mr. R the sheik. Also EVO is the biggest Sm4sh tournament to allow custom moves, which some consider broken.

They will also be doing the SaltySuite which is super super hype. It's basically just fun money matches set up between two players who either call each other out or just some fun history between them. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqxihDQJWQI GIMR explains it there.  As for USF4, last year IGN uploaded lot's of games, I believe it was all streamed games. You can find the full top 8 sets uploaded by other users.  Unfortunately I don't know where Melee is being streamed or uploaded to, I would have assumed VGBC so I guess wait and see.  If you are on snapchat, there is a guy on /r/smashbros who will upload stuff from EVO on the go through out the weekend, his username on it is Nick.Evo This worked really well for CEO and was a lot of fun for people who couldn't attend.  I have no idea where the other games will be uploaded as I have little to no interest in them sorry."

Games,3djsj9,decross20,17,Thu Jul 16 22:18:55 2015 UTC,I think it's because it's xbone exclusive while persona is ps3 and xbox
Games,3djsj9,jordanb18,5,Thu Jul 16 22:51:00 2015 UTC,It probably has to do with KI being 90% American and P4 being 80%.  Both games are getting the same number of entrants from America but KI has 8 from 2 countries (Canada/Japan) as rounding out slots 2 and 3 while P4 has 44 from Japan and 16 from Canada as 2nd/3rd.  Being Xbone exclusive kind of kills it in foreign markets for a global presence.

Games,3djsj9,DragonEevee1,0,Fri Jul 17 00:18:54 2015 UTC,"Hearsay: Most of the core FGC finds combo breakers to be an unenjoyable system. You have to learn more combos and combo routes in order to bypass or stop breakers from happening. KI offers fundamental gameplay very similar to what SFIV offers, except with more labwork to be done, a drastically smaller local playerbase (Most in the FGC don't own an XB1) and a smaller roster.  Generally speaking, the game should be pulling a large amount of interest from SFIV players, but it doesn't give SFIV players a good reason to leave SFIV.  I predict the PC version to cause a huge spike in local player numbers for a while, which will be healthy for the game."
Games,3djsj9,biggameover,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:20:15 2015 UTC,"You are describing why its not more popular with tourneys. You may have a few fair points but I still disagree about it. /u/jordanb18 is saying that the way actual game plays is bad, which is just flat out wrong.  I don't get why people compare it to SFIV. They really aren't similar at all.   KI is much faster and most of the chars have their own unique styles. Sure every char can do the same Opener --> auto double --> Linker --> auto double --> Ender combo, but that is the very basic stuff of its combo system. After you get used how to do those combos, move on to counter-breakers, and then you move on to manuals, and then you move on to set-ups that are unique to your char.   Most of the chars have abilities and tactics that are unique to fighting games. You can't play with Kan-Ra, ARIA, Maya, Omen, TJ Combo, and Spinal like a SFIV player."

Games,3djpwp,hellodontmind,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:31:43 2015 UTC,"It's why I think Collector's edition's need to be divorced from platform.  Instead of having the Xbox One Collectors Edition, The PC Collectors Edition, the PS4 collectors Edition.  Have it be an upgrade. You buy the PS4 version and the Collectors Edition Pack. or the PC and the Collectors edition pack.    That way instead of being like, Haha you play on PC well we didn't bother to release a pack for PC LOL. Everyone gets a chance.  It also means that if your a PS4 or Xbox One player, you aren't necessarily going to miss out because your local retailer got 10 copies of each, and the PS4 ones sold out while there are still some Xbox One versions or vice versa.  By making it an upgrade pack that can only be purchased in conjunction with the base game you then ensure that the fans who got there first actually get the chance to get the goodies they want. And don't just miss out because their platform sold out or wasn't supported.  It becomes slightly harder when you have download codes for games. Since they are generally platform specific. But the easy way to deal with that is simply to have the user go online to a website type in a ""DLC code"" and then choose the platform they want to play on. At which point the website then spits out the corresponding code for the platform that user wants to play on."

You know how you notice how loud the disc and fan are during a games loading screen or something? It really ruins the moment sometimes. I like to go all out and turn the place into a dark, silent home theater, and it's really obvious when the film is quiet.  It feels silly sometimes to leave the BD's on the shelf but if it's between a quick file open on the desktop or a noisy PS3, I'll stick with it.  I'll probably be doing the same for Fury Road."

You would probably also think that the student age demographic  would be one of the largest for console gaming. I can tell you that around 98% of people I know that have moved out don't have any sort of TV subscription, and the ones that still live at home only have it for their parents, I.e. No tuner/receiver in the room they play games in. I have never once heard of anyone I know using their XB1's TV features.   Netflix is huge here, and copyright laws are much less strict than in the US so piracy is relatively popular. Why get TV when a sub can be up to $150 for a decent selection/HD receiver, but unlimited internet is $60 and Netflix is $10, with the convenience of working on tons of devices (anecdotal prices I'm sure it varies around the country)."

Also, you can plug something else into that port and use it that way - like a Chromecast or media PC.   Sure, you don't have the functionality that is present in the US, but that kind of thing happens for various reasons. For example, Microsoft released the USB TV tuner first in EU.

Then you potentially get Final Fantasy Cross platform(No idea if that was them or Square wanting a bigger slice of the outside japan market) But that isn't really a positive to buying your console if it's still on the console with all the other games you want.  So here you are sitting almost 15 years later with a console that has bugger all brand presence in the country and little in the way of appealing titles.

It's basically a management sim but there's never enough resources to come anywhere close to winning it. The challenge is seeing how long you can survive.  I got up to about Day 12 before seeing everything the game has to see.

Not ""win"", I don't believe the purpose of the game was to ever be possible to ""win"" as a civilian in a war zone.

This is exactly what I want to see more of in video games, especially ones that surround war.   We need to shake off this idea that killing another person, even in self defense, isn't going to have some heavy emotional and mental repercussions. Especially so for a game like this where the characters are not trained soldiers.  In an industry that has plenty of games that completely ignore the real effects of killing someone, it's nice to see more that address it.   Call it preachy if you want, but I call that realistic.  I'm debating picking this up for iPad. I've already gotten far more than 10 hours out of the PC version, so I know I'd enjoy it, but $10 for a game I already own might be too much for me."

We contacted some museums and some foundations that helped those people and we told them what kind of game we were doing.  “But it’s hard to get people to speak because they want to forget. They lost their relatives, they lost their homes.

EDIT: Don't get me wrong, it's fine if you didn't like the game, but minimizing the message that the game is trying to convey as they use real world examples of the atrocities of war, is just ignorant and wrong.

Like I said above, it is OK if you don't like the game; different strokes and all that.   But to call the character's actions in this game inaccurate to what would happen to untrained civilians, who were raped, beaten, and killed; who had no idea if today was going to be there last day alive; who were forced to steal from and murder their former neighbors in order to scrape together enough resources to survive, shows a complete lack of understanding of the real life consequences of war.   Please read about the four year siege of Sarajevo.  To say that it was awful and horrific is an understatement.  War is not just armies facing off against each other.  The city was blockaded for four years, and thousands of civilians died inside to  starvation, gunfire, or freezing to death in winter.

You can also try to rob instead of kill, or try to get by without taking from others.

Games,3djzm3,Jeccems,13,Mon Jul 20 08:52:34 2015 UTC,"What is the general consensus on the amount of the game people have been able to play? the game looks amazing in my opinion and is the main reason (now, add FF7R to it) that I want a PS4.   So, is good? bad? mediocre? I also understand that the amount people have had access to is very limited, so I get it if the impressions are vague at best."
Games,3djzm3,portrait_fusion,35,Mon Jul 20 23:24:07 2015 UTC,"my personal experience (bought a PS4 pretty much for Bloodborne, KH3, RB4 and FF XV. RB4 isn't looking good, but so far, I'm loving my ps4), anyways, back on topic:   it feels like a more ""mature"" KH (gameplay-wise) the lock-on and camera were improved heavily in 2.0, so no complains there I think I was the only one, but I actually got worse framerate after the demo 2.0 came out can't speak much about the story, but if it's still the same one, it's fairly interesting the character interactions are great. Randomly fist-bumping after a cross combo felt so good, because it felt so natural, really hope they explore more into their friendship and why they get along so well the ""brodeo"" idea doesn't excite many people, but I for one, am very excited. FF games are great, but usually follow a somewhat similar formula. This seems to break with that stereotype and explore something new, which interests me gameplay-wise: as fluid and fun as KH. Can't judge everything because there was no magic in the demo, but what I've played sure as hell is promising it's surprisingly hard, like old Final Fantasies. But it feels weird because you're fully in control of the situation unlike in other FFs. But the second you get cocky... bam, you're dead my god, the soundtrack is amazing overall it's good, but it could learn more from Type 0's combat so it doesn't get too repetitive"
Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,5,Fri Jul 17 13:57:00 2015 UTC,How does the combat compare to crisis core if you've played it?
Games,3djzm3,Im_French,12,Fri Jul 17 00:28:00 2015 UTC,"Crisis Core is a lot faster and in a closed environment, whereas XV is in an open environment where more and more enemies can join the fight, sometimes making them 5-8 minutes long if you don't flee. XV has a lot more weight in its characters, you can feel how strong every hit is, but it's therefore, depending on the weapon, a bit slower.  I enjoy XVs combat a lot more than CC though, for not using this weird memory-wheel-thingy alone.  I disagree with everyone who says that XVs combat is similar to KH - maybe at one point it used to be, but they changed it so much that the only common things both games have is that they are action systems. KH is still menu based, XV features direct inputs for everything."

Whereas I have heard a lot of mixed reviews of Crisis Core. What I can say is: if you're into KH's Action/RPG/Hack n Slash gameplay, you'll love FF XV"
Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,2,Fri Jul 17 07:05:49 2015 UTC,"Nice, I was asking because crisis core has similar gameplay, which I like so much more than turn based combat, a mainstream final fantasy game without turn based combat is all I could ever ask for. I've always found turn based combat boring unfortunately, and had to ""endure"" the combat to enjoy those games like FF and pokemon (altough it is largely compensated by everything else, and the games are still great overall), and crisis core was the first FF game where I found every aspect of the game enjoyable, not being able to dodge attacks is just too annoying for my ""perfectionist"" playstyle in games."
Games,3djzm3,Im_French,-12,Fri Jul 17 08:03:35 2015 UTC,The most surprising part of this comment is that the soundtrack is amazing.  I hope that's true because FF music has been complete trash since the departure of Uematsu.
Games,3djzm3,Blehgopie,11,Fri Jul 17 02:54:08 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say it's complete trash. Say what you will about the FFXIII trilogy but its OST is amazing.
Games,3djzm3,jette_lag,-1,Fri Jul 17 02:59:43 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Theatarhythm games just pick the absolute worst tracks from all the FFXII games, because every time I have to play a song from a game newer than X I'm either wanting to gouge out my ear drums, or I'm just plain bored."
Games,3djzm3,Blehgopie,5,Fri Jul 17 04:53:47 2015 UTC,"Meh, I really enjoyed FFXIII's soundtrack. It was different and the battle music was awesome."
Games,3djzm3,DrProfessorPHD_Esq,0,Fri Jul 17 07:10:09 2015 UTC,"I can't say I loved FF XIII, it is indeed one of the worst soundtracks of the franchise, especially FF XIII-2 (even if it has a Nobuo track) but I wouldn't call them complete garbage"

Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,9,Fri Jul 17 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"I hope that's true because FF music has been complete trash since the departure of Uematsu.   Uematsu still returns to do work. He did the entirety of XIV 1.0's soundtrack, and did the main theme for ARR's expansion, Heavensward. Masayoshi Soken's been doing the rest of the music for ARR, and it has been absolutely phenomenal.  And while it polarizes a few people, much like every other aspect of the game, Final Fantasy XIII's soundtrack is considered to be pretty darn good. Masashi Hamauzu having helped Uematsu with the soundtrack for X."

Games,3djzm3,Rokk017,3,Sat Jul 18 11:42:20 2015 UTC,"oh yeah for sure, I mean I'll be getting a PS4 when any one of those titles drop. I was really tempted to make the dive with Bloodborne so I'll most likely pick that up when I do get a PS4"
Games,3djzm3,portrait_fusion,2,Fri Jul 17 00:35:45 2015 UTC,"Yup, as much as I'd hate spending about 600$ for 4 games, bloodborne, FF15, KH3 and FF7remake make it more tempting everyday. I gotta say, exclusives are a pain in the ass but damn they're working."
Games,3djzm3,Im_French,-9,Fri Jul 17 00:50:13 2015 UTC,"the trailer said ""play it first on ps4"" so it's likely that's coming out for xbone too.   highly unlikely. The original was PC/PS1, so they probably meant timed exclusive for PS4 then PC"
Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,6,Fri Jul 17 00:52:52 2015 UTC,There's no way that would be the reasoning for no Xbone release. If they're putting both XV and KH on the One they're going to put the VII remake on it too.
Games,3djzm3,TheDWGM,2,Fri Jul 17 02:45:14 2015 UTC,time will tell. It would be cool because the last FF game for the Xbox was FFXIII-3
Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,3,Fri Jul 17 01:58:47 2015 UTC,The only games to come out since then were remakes weren't they?
Games,3djzm3,TheDWGM,3,Fri Jul 17 02:10:32 2015 UTC,I meant sequels. Xb1 missed FF XIV. Which is apparently one of the greatest MMOs out there
Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,3,Fri Jul 17 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"FFXIV wasn't on Xbox for server reasons. Microsoft wouldn't allow cross-play servers, and from what Yoshida has said they want it hosted on Microsoft's server, which was a no deal for him."
Games,3djzm3,Deloused_,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:44:35 2015 UTC,"Ah, I forgot about XIV. I seem to recall the dev team saying that they would only release it on the MS platform if it could be crossplatform with the Sony one (which obv didn't happen)."
Games,3djzm3,TheDWGM,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:51:56 2015 UTC,"Considering every iteration of ff13 has been multi plat, KH3 and ff15 are multi plat, many other games by square Enix are multi plat, and they're remaking FF7 from the ground up, I would highly doubt it's not coming to xbone."
Games,3djzm3,Rokk017,-4,Fri Jul 17 03:28:27 2015 UTC,"I played the demo and I was bored out of my mind. They have since said they plan to change a lot of things but the targeting was awful, the hack-n-slash not new or interesting, the characters all felt like the same ridiculous archetypes square have produced since they could make 3d graphics resemble humans, and it just seems like they borrowed the worst parts of many types of games and took none of the good ones (for instance, the world is huge, but you get tired after jogging for a few seconds, over and over and over)."
Games,3djzm3,kilmore_trout,14,Fri Jul 17 04:15:35 2015 UTC,I really hope it gets announced for PC.  I've seen a lot of gameplay of the demo and even after the update it runs pretty badly.

Games,3djzm3,ManateeofSteel,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:14:00 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  Well maybe that will change in the future. I could see licensing being a valid reason for never releasing the HD collection through downloads, because if it was simple enough to do then they would have done it already, but maybe if they go into KH3 with the intent to make it downloadable then they'll have an easier time of it.     They seemed to have gotten the mobile port of the web game approved for downloading, and downloading games straight to drive is pretty much standard nowadays so I'm sure they'll want it for KH3, so maybe we'll see them put more effort/money into making sure they have full digital distribution rights for all of KH3."

I might just stick with my Wii U / PC and sell off my Xbox 1 if FFXV comes to PC."

Lit candles in Skyrim tombs that apparently haven't been visited in thousands of years is another example.  It's one little thing, but crates are an example of a world element that can easily break immersion if the player does notice something wrong, when they notice something wrong, they're no longer thinking about the game or creating their own weird twisted fiction to make it work."

Even though I was frustrated at some combat sequences, lacklustre story, and countless falls because I jumped 0.1ms early, it went in the direction where other companies were churning out cash-grab sequels. Speaking of Mirror's Edge, I believe I am due for my annual playthrough! Will definitely watch out for those crates though!"

The lighting in that game is still incredible, and the whole atmosphere is fantastic of course. The music too. Can't wait for Catalyst, I hope they don't make it too ""crowded"". The trailer has a few parts where there are a lot of people around. I liked being completely alone above (or below) the city for most of the game."

Their role is to just regurgitate information in a way that'll match the current community voice and to mitigate any potential fallouts.

Games,3diic9,bcGrimm,21,Thu Jul 16 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"I played for the first time since like October last week to see what they've done with it. The game has actually removed content  since launch because they lock you out of some of the most lucrative activities if you don't have the DLC.  I'll agree they've made a lot of cosmetic changes to the grind by adding a bunch of new currencies, but they haven't made the game any better and they've made it worse in the process. As far as I know they haven't announced any plans to add new classes or weapons that actually play differently, new planets, or make an attempt to fix the leveling system that's tied to loot.  It seems like they're content to churn out palette swaps for weapons with new names and some sub-classes for the ones they already have."

That's a bit deceptive. You don't lose access to any content - all the strikes, raids, and missions you own are still there for you to play. You just might not have access to that day's/week's buffed up version of a mission/strike if it's one of the ones you don't own.   As far as I know they haven't announced any plans to add new classes or weapons that actually play differently   TK has a new subclass for each class, and HoW introduced the sidearm weapon type, the scorch cannon, and some exotics that behave rather uniquely."

Pretty unique designs at that and far from previous alterations.  Add a new questing system, raid, story, quest-lines etc  At a quick glance today, with HoW, you only see the minor cosmetic changes. Functionally though, a lot of the much criticised grinding to get weapons and then unlocking upgrades and getting materials to actually upgrade them has been made much simpler and faster. There's also added color blindness settings, audio settings, more ways to make your characters unique. Stuff that all players have access to, whether they bought HoW or not."

Yesterday there was a giant thread about people who were burnt out on the game and stopped playing because they were tired of playing the same content over and over.

They put any of those situations in megathreads to de-clutter the subreddit, for one. And I have not seen practically any censoring besides to quell witch-hunts on that sub.  I hardly think Cosmo was in Bungie's pocket the entire time, if at all.  edit: not to mention he stepped down as head moderator once he was publicly announced for this job because he knew that could cause issues on either the mods or community's side."
Games,3diic9,SkaBonez,11,Thu Jul 16 18:12:59 2015 UTC,"Duplicate posts aren't necessary, but separate posts about different negative aspects of the game should certainly be allowed.

Games,3diic9,Ultrace-7,15,Thu Jul 16 18:38:49 2015 UTC,"But... That's actually how it works. Threads on different issues are allowed but, if need be, condensed to relevant mega threads.  Only time I've seen multiple issues compacted into one thread was with regards to problems related to one specific patch, and only after Bungie issued a statement confirming what problems said patch was causing. The mods over there have done a mostly terrific job. Much better than many other subreddits I subscribe to."
Games,3diic9,astromek,13,Thu Jul 16 21:14:01 2015 UTC,"And they are allowed. At least once a week there's a post calling for weapon balancing (excluding all the top comments about it in other posts), there's posts about glitch abusing with PVP every so often, and many posts about vault space, shader management, etc. that are on the front page often.  I've only seen megathreads about singular events, such as the expansion reveals, TTK pricing issues, the red bull campaign, etc. And even then, as long as you don't post directly about something in that megathread, you can still post about the topic outside of it."
Games,3diic9,SkaBonez,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:36:14 2015 UTC,"They put any of those situations in megathreads to de-clutter the subreddit, for one   Not really. There was a post by an ex-mod from pics a long time ago that detailed why mods use megathreads. There's only 1 reason: to quell all discussion on a topic. The fact is, megathread or not there's going to be duplicate threads. The ex-mod pretty much said that putting up a megathread didn't lower the number of reposts one bit and they still have to delete threads anyways. It only ever game them a shield from a community backlash because technically gave the community a place to discuss certain things. However with how reddit is formatted with there being multiple threads on top of one other that break down to numerous other threads, after a certain number of posts any intelligent discussion breaks off because only a couple people ever search past a few levels of a thread that isn't at the very top."
Games,3diic9,InnerSpikeWork,3,Thu Jul 16 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Hm, I've been a subscriber and daily visitor of that sub pretty much since it's been up and haven't seen anything like that. Source?  and I didn't say that it prevented anyone from ""reposting"". I've been on the receiving end of a totally legitimate post removal due to a megathread twice now so I know about that. But if you visited the ""new"" and ""rising"" sections back in the day when PSN and XBL where getting ddos-ed often, the ""I can't log on, can anyone else?"" or similar posts where stifling any other legitimate posts so much it was ridiculous. That situation needs to be prevented so those other posts can thrive instead of getting buried and megathreads are how you do that. The mods cant fix how Reddit works past that besides encouraging users to sort comments by other means instead of just ""top""."
Games,3diic9,SkaBonez,6,Thu Jul 16 19:58:40 2015 UTC,He was referring to the destiny subreddit specifically. And they definitely do use megathrEads extensively. New update? Mega thread. Any times content has it's own mega thread. Weekly reset? Megathread. The mod team on r/destinythegame is very good about using megathreads to keep the subreddit from becoming cluttered about a singular topic on any given day.
Games,3diic9,BMEngie,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:24:45 2015 UTC,But that's my point. The post literally outlined that megathreads DO NOTHING to stop clutter and constantly posting them gives you an excuse for why you're deleting every thread. Megathreads don't deter people from making their own threads. The mods are removing the exact same amount of duplicate threads if there's a megathread or not. I'm not sure what you think megathreads do. Do you think megathreads automatically delete duplicate threads? Because the mods still do that regardless
Games,3diic9,InnerSpikeWork,14,Thu Jul 16 19:31:14 2015 UTC,"What I see as a regular reader of /r/DestinyTheGame is that the megathreads do in fact stop the clutter on the sub and accomplish the goals they are created to achieve. While I see your point, I do not think a post by an ex-mod of a different sub is at all representative of what happens regularly over on the destiny sub. There you have a very impulsive and reactionary user base (reddit in a nutshell lol) which also happens to be very active during brief frenzied ""big events"". I have yet to see a single instance of the mod team censoring or otherwise interfering with the discussions on the subreddit unless they violate the rules of the subreddit. I'm an active Destiny player (gasp), and the game has a ton of problems but the sub mod team isn't one of them in my experience."
Games,3diic9,ZimMeisterFlash,3,Thu Jul 16 19:53:47 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's what I was trying to say. The megathreads allow for most of the posts to be discussion about various other activities. While lately a lot of posts have been about the horrendous  (imo) state of pvp, there has been plenty of other posts that wouldn't make it to the top if it weren't for the (almost) daily megathread.   The guy you replied to seems to think that similar Posts get deleted, but the mods tend to let the community decide what rant(s) of the day gets up voted rather than only allowing a single post on each topic"

Games,3diic9,Gruntoncoffee,25,Thu Jul 16 16:57:20 2015 UTC,"No, if the Destiny community was tired of hearing about it than the threads would have been downvoted.  Reddit is literally community curated content, the audience dictates what they fucking want to see so if the front page is filled with negative shit than guess how it got there?"
Games,3diic9,Falcker,7,Thu Jul 16 17:01:41 2015 UTC,"You got it. As long as the submission is within the rules (and criticism of the game is) and isn't low effort, it's supposed to be fair game.   I guess it's hard for people to grasp that something they don't want to hear is allowed."
Games,3diic9,Doomspeaker,-4,Thu Jul 16 18:14:58 2015 UTC,"Yes except when the inevitable ""controversy of the week"" rolls around, game-specific subreddits get absolutely brigaded. Now you have hundreds of new people who are motivated by principle, don't play the game, or really don't want to see it succeed, commandeering the narrative while the subreddit regulars get drowned out. And that's allowed, it is just really annoying. Most of these new comments are duplicative and low-effort, and belie a desire not for serious discussion, but for more exposure. This is also how I feel about a lot of criticism of megathreads. The people who hate them the most do not care about discussion, they care about making sure they can saturate the market with a specific viewpoint. Again, not against the rules, but holy crap does it turn a subreddit sour."

Everyone was complaining about it in the megathread, nobody wanted it and yet there it was to force the conversations to die.  Which it did.  Reddit is a community content driven website, people vote on what they do and dont want to see on the front page and thats how its supposed to work, its not up to the mods to decide what they want to see the front page look like."
Games,3diic9,Falcker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:14:03 2015 UTC,The Destiny community is the one generating the negativity because they are upset with the decisions Bungie is making.

So its very apparent that the job offer or talk of a job offer was during or had occurred prior to the controversy situation.   Whilst the whole pricing thing was going down we were getting messages left right and centre about making a megathread and only did so after it started getting out of hand.   So if I start making enough requests to get the circlejerk shit posts of the front page you'll ban all mentions of them outside of a mod mandated megathread? Is that how it works?   We wanted it to be discussed but people were making new accounts to spam our subreddit as if that will get the price down or something.   Thats not why the megathread was made, and the megathread didnt just ban pricing discussions it was an all encompassing ""complaints dump box"" for you to hide any kind of negative discussion.  http://img0.joyreactor.com/pics/post/auto-suggestion-box-paper-shredder-197329.jpeg  Thats your megathread, it was put up quite literally to stop people from talking about all listed subjects anymore and thats exactly what it accomplished.  https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/3aa7nj/pricingpackagesacronymsnicknamesvault_space/?ref=search_posts   No more making individual posts about the following topics:  The Taken King pricing  The Taken King packages  Sub-class nickname ideas  Vault Space suggestions, complaints, etc.   And the entire thread was filled with Destiny regulars talking about censorship.   ""This is the most vague, and generally dumbest excuse for a megathread.""  ""Yeah, let's lump together an assortment of unrelated topics to fuck up discussion and ensure it falls off the front page.""  ""I understand the point of megathreads, but this kind of feels like we are being silenced.""  ""Imo this megathread is the wrong way to deal with the (multiple) complaints. The sub should be flooded with them until Bungie reacts and comments.""  ""stupidest mega thread""  ""This is a terrible idea. Having a megathread that covers this many issues insures that Bungie/Activisiom don't have to see critisicm where it is rightly deserved.

""This does kind of feels like a bit of a ploy to bury the discontent to be honest... Getting the complaints off the front page and tucked away in to a multipurpose thread - rather than a stickied ""Taken King Grievances"" thread kind of dodges the point of people making threads to begin with.""  ""If this stuff is important to the community why bury it in a mega thread that bungie will never read?""  ""Oh good, so if Bungie happens to check here to see if people are pissed over their dumb decisions they will see no posts complaining about anything. Must mean everyone is happy!""  ""So this is the ""all the stuff we don't want to hear anymore about"" megathread? Im still pretty discontent with the digital collectors edition pricing. I want that extra stuff without rebuying the whole game.""   I'm sure all these people were ""making accounts to spam the front page"".

""those megathread are the best way to make a topic die quickly and to bury important informations forever...""

Games,3diic9,Falcker,-6,Fri Jul 17 11:52:19 2015 UTC,No it's because if they did allow it the whole sub would be constantly full of all the problems the game has had since launch that Bungie has shown no interest in fixing not to mention all the disgusting shit they've pulled on the business end of the game. This way when people go to the sub it looks as if all is well with the game.

Almost every other PVP clip has a ""thorn needs nerfing"" or ""the meta needs rebalancing"" in the top comments, the inside jokes about Luke Smith or the constant patching at the beginning are still there, etc. And I have yet to see those comments be censored by mods."
Games,3diic9,SkaBonez,11,Thu Jul 16 17:44:04 2015 UTC,Suppressing content about it? No. It was all over the subreddit and eventually mods probably contained it to just a couple threads here and there if that's what you saw. They never suppress controversy there.

Games,3diic9,astromek,2,Thu Jul 16 17:21:53 2015 UTC,"In my experience, that applies to pretty much anything on Reddit. I see this even on the small sub I moderate, people are fishing for the front page by downvoting everything new but their own posts. The behaviour is all to common.  Upon that, you also have Reddit's built-in vote fuzzing that will keep posts at weird points, often zero for a while after posting, to make it harder for bots to calculate whether their votes or posts have an effect or not. There is changes to this being argued in the Reddit beta as the question ""why am I being downvoted"" is all to common when it's just the anti bot system kicking in.  Then you have the effect of people downvoting posts to similar to those already on the rising, popular or front since there is already a good discussion going on there.  I also see posts about the lacking social aspects of the game prey much every day on the front and popular pages, meaning they cannot all be downvoted into oblivion.   Edit: damn autocorrect"
Games,3diic9,astromek,2,Thu Jul 16 17:26:03 2015 UTC,"The fuzzying will keep posts at zero for some time, but votes are still registered and later displayed. As for downvote fairies, in my experience there's both trigger happy and karma thirsty humans and their robotic slaves. The bigger the sub, the larger the effect. And DTG is a big sub. There's scripts for automatic downvoting of all but your comments as well. Both for Reddit and Imgur and for what? A slightly increased chance of more virtual points?"
Games,3diic9,astromek,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:32:04 2015 UTC,"No disagreement there, the downvote brigade around the social issues can get out of hand.  I do like how they opened up the weekly to matchmaking, I'm personally ok with the raid and higher PoEs not having it, but thats only because having had played WoW for longer then I care to admit (just recently kicked THAT habit) Once they implemented the LFR it had to be dumbed down SO MUCH, that it just became another dungeon, not really something that was engaging anymore.

Here's the text for those who are too lazy to click:   Hello Guardians. I created this sub back in December of 2012 when all we knew about Destiny was what we saw on some leaked concept art. Once the sub got traction I knew that because it was a Bungie game the community that would eventually build up around Destiny would be large and vibrant. I had certain expectations of what /r/DestinyTheGame would become. I never dreamt it would blow up to what it is today.   I've always said that this place's success is a mixture of the talented team that works so hard to keep it running, as well as the amazing users the supply the content and comments that draw so much attention.   I'm stepping down as top moderator of this subreddit and passing on full control to the team who will be lead by /u/K_Lobstah. Why is this happening? Well that is the exciting part. I have joined the team at Bungie as their new Community Manager. Don't worry, /u/DeeJ_bng isn't going anywhere, he will still be writing the weekly update and wearing his funny jacket on Twitch streams. If you want to know more about what I will be doing, my role is laid out in my introduction post.  I am handing off full control of /r/DestinyTheGame to the mod team. This subreddit has always operated independently without having to worry about keeping Bungie best interests in mind - and it will continue to do so. Because of this, as an employee, I shouldn’t remain on the mod team here. It’s been a lot of fun helping run this place over the years. You will still see me around, but I won’t be influencing the decisions being made here.  It’s been a pleasure to help build this sub. I am excited about serving the community in my new position. Don’t think of this as a goodbye to a head moderator, but more hello to your new Community Manager."

Games,3diic9,voidzero,9,Thu Jul 16 20:04:31 2015 UTC,yup. I suspect that recent events and Deej's absence from the community to attend E3 and other expos and conferences had a part to play in getting another hand on the community management.

Bungie treats /r/destinythegame like a fan site and its not a good thing to have their biggest fan site going nuclear on their game the week following an announcement of a bunch of new shit for sale.  The whole megathread derailed the community outcry completely and hid it away til it died out, we still have no answers to the majority of issues people had and yet the discussion is dead because the mods forcefully put a gag order on it.

Love Arma, love WW2. Tighten and simplify the control scheme to be more like Road to Hill 30, but keep the open-ended sandbox of war.   There's a WW2 mod for Arma 2/3 Iron Front Liberation that, while it has its janks, has come closest to my ideal WW2 game as well. For instance, your objective is to scout the Normandy countryside and it's Hedgerow Hell. You and your squad move through the grassy fields scouting for Germans, stumbling upon patrols and machine gun nests, and--oh shit--a Tiger tank. In typical Arma fashion, take the objective any way you can.  If it went totally story-driven as well, placing you in the role of a non-comm who works his way up through battlefield commissions, allowing you to eventually command a platoon or company, you could really flesh out the story from a OIC's point of view rather than shooting what you're told to shoot as a faceless, voiceless grunt. This is where I think the hard decisions would shape the narrative--ballsy, bloody actions get you promotions and all the benefits that command brings, but might result in huge loss of life and resentment from your men. Think Nick Nolte's glory-hound character in The Thin Red Line. Books and movies have explored this side of war a ton, but with games we're too preoccupied with making the player the hero."

Games,3dl3dc,Vgvgcfc,20,Fri Jul 17 03:36:15 2015 UTC,"I just wish they would speed up the movement animations and pull back the camera;  ever since the series moved to 3D, it played so slowly and you can't see much."
Games,3dl3dc,OhUmHmm,3,Fri Jul 17 04:42:36 2015 UTC,"The camera has been a definite complaint of mine in recent games of this genre. Usually there's two squares below your location that you can see as opposed to the three or four from previous games. If an enemy just offscreen moves up as you move down, you're suddenly in direct contact with a baddie you didn't even have a chance to plan for. It's limiting, strategically."

Its easily regarded as one of the best ones in the entire series. If you really want to start from the beginning then you can start with Red/Blue Rescue Team. They aren't as good as Explorers of Sky, but they are still really good games. After Explorers, if you want, you can play Gates to Infinity. Gates to Infinity is usually regarded as the worst one in the series. I personally enjoyed it though at it is still a good game regardless. Hope this helped. :D"

Games,3diip3,Piemonkey,20,Thu Jul 16 15:30:01 2015 UTC,"For anyone wondering, I'd call Chaos Gate easily one of the best tactical games I've ever played (and is one of the reasons I've tried to play as many as I can since first finishing this in the 90s).  Think larger-scale Final Fantasy Tactics style turn-based, squad-level, grid combat.  A pretty faithful single-player Warhammer experience (as in, even for as different as it is, it still ""feels"" like tabletop 40k) too.  And the solid story and atmospheric music totally tops it all off as well.  A very strong recommendation here for any fans of either 40k or the tactics genre.  So glad to see this back in the fold."

Where does the lore come from that these games share? The RPG books? I've never seen an RPG book but I assumed they just had data and maps or something, descriptions and terminology, but all these warhammer games seem to have a solid lore behind them and I keep seeing warhammer fans using names and phrases that suggest there's something more.   As much as I love FFT I don't think I can move past those graphics, especially for $10. I'd be super into getting some books or something though, I just don't know where to start. Do I just get whatever RPG book is current? Are there non RPG books?"
Games,3diip3,dorkrock2,3,Fri Jul 17 00:44:10 2015 UTC,"I would check out /r/warhammer and /r/warhammer40k. 40k is the science fiction version of Warhammer. I wouldn't call it the same ""universe"" but there are fan theories about the Warhammer world existing somewhere in space and time before or during the time of 40k.  The RPG books have lore, the tabletop army books have lore, Games Workshop has their own publishing house that does lore, they love the lore. It's so deep."
Games,3diip3,Squirmin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:16:25 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't necessarily recommend getting into the miniatures game of WH. It is known for continually getting worse and worse pricing (when it was already expensive) and I believe they recently overhauled the rules to something really ridiculous. You are probably better served by the RPGs or playing board games that Fantasy Flight makes using the license.  Warhammer: Diskwars would be cheap to get into, as it is essentially a lighter version of a miniatures game, where you flip cardboard disks to move your units instead of buying expensive models. Seriously that whole game I linked costs less than a small portion of a WH miniatures army."
Games,3diip3,SoupOfTomato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:37:41 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't have any intention of getting into the tabletop or RPG aspects, not really into that kind of stuff but WH has some of the coolest art and concepts, that's more of the side I'm interested in. I didn't realize there were actual non-RPG books about WH before this thread, so now I at least know what type of media I'm looking for.   Collecting the figures seems like it would cost more than MTG considering how many figures are custom made and hand painted (judging from the WH sub)."
Games,3diip3,dorkrock2,3,Fri Jul 17 03:49:34 2015 UTC,"Your best bet then is definitely books.  I don't know that much about the series myself, but Horus Heresy is a big event in the timeline with a lot of books, and it shouldn't be too hard to figure out the proper order to read them. Seems like it could be a good point to anchor yourself to starting out.  The whole world's a bit too grimdark for my taste overall, though. :)  And collecting figures does cost an arm and a leg, yeah. It's infamous for that. Which is why if you ever get interested in playing something on the tabletop (and please do), the Diskwars or other board games are a much more affordable format."
Games,3diip3,SoupOfTomato,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:56:22 2015 UTC,"I'm into Warcraft lore so the grimdarkyness coupled with knowing WC was inspired by (and lifted elements directly from) warhammer makes it highly appealing, refreshing even after the direction WC has gone, I just never knew where to start. Thanks for the info, I'll probably find a reading order and pick some books up this week. Dunno if I'll ever be into tabletop but anything's possible, maybe if the books hook me."
Games,3diip3,dorkrock2,2,Fri Jul 17 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"Definitely look at the Horus Heresy series then. The first three books in the series are amazing, and I rate The First Heretic as one of my favorite novels.  The other series I really like is Eisenhorn series. Worth a read for sure."
Games,3diip3,TetrisIsUnrealistic,2,Fri Jul 17 05:08:54 2015 UTC,The Eisenhorn trilogy follows the adventures of an inquisitor who investigates the enemies of the empire. It's quite actiony and fun. There is a sequel about his apprentice Ravenor.

Games,3diip3,MisterKetchup,14,Fri Jul 17 03:59:48 2015 UTC,Why isn't Dark Omen on that list? Probably the hardest game I've ever beaten.
Games,3diip3,abuttfarting,10,Thu Jul 16 16:41:02 2015 UTC,"Both Dark Omen and SotHR were amazingly difficult.  You pretty much needed to ace the earlier battles in order to have enough cash and units to survive the later ones.  It really doesn't let you know how necessary this is until its too late.    Pretty much need perfect cannon/archer/mage placement to minimize random troop losses.  And since every battle has about 3 surprises and a lot of hidden items, it requires you to memorize the field and learn it."
Games,3diip3,modix,5,Thu Jul 16 17:26:48 2015 UTC,"Its been a decade, but this sounds right. SotHR on my PS1(egads) I made it to the doors of some dwarven city, and then overwhelmed every time."
Games,3diip3,jashugan777,3,Thu Jul 16 17:30:02 2015 UTC,"My recollection is a bit fuzzy...  but if that's the one where you get warp unit skaven coming in from about 18 different directions in a colleseum in order to make it into the city to join the dwarves.... nasty nasty level.  I think I even took a ""win"" where several units were fully wiped.  That level was ALL about the cannons and you needed to get quite lucky (like routing a couple units with the same fire).    THat was one of the hardest levels in the game... and if you survived it with a decent about of troops, I believe it was easy to regroup afterwards.  You get a pretty overpowered dwarven melee unit that I loved after that.    [Edit - Grumm's gate apparently.  Thius is the one with the Caravans and all the goblins attacking?   You need to be masterful with your calvalry (both Grudgebringer and Ragnar's), and flit back and forth between them.  Need to get lucky and break the night goblins.  Rough level.  ]"

In addition, Final Liberation is as close to the Epic 40k tabletop as you will get, with resource limits, turn based combat and those sort of elements translated directly.  Shadow of the Horned Rat is quite fun but beware it isn't very easy.  Chaos Gate is a blast from the past and if you want to accurately play an old edition of 40k, this is your chance.

Games,3dinlk,gabriel191,127,Thu Jul 16 16:05:44 2015 UTC,So this basically just sounds like the Harley bit; incredibly short with no replay value or real purpose at all.
Games,3dinlk,heffergod,129,Thu Jul 16 17:25:32 2015 UTC,"no real purpose at all.   Of course there's a purpose. They need to deliver at least something for all the cash they already banked selling Season Passes...  But since it's already paid off, quality is not the main purpose. As we saw with the PC base game...."
Games,3dinlk,vgrezende,22,Thu Jul 16 17:43:26 2015 UTC,That DLC price is why I refunded the base game before it came out...Made no sense that since all their dlc from before has been mediocre at best that this game was a big no-no. Trusted the force on this one and BOOM goes the death star.
Games,3dinlk,Cheezelog,45,Thu Jul 16 17:56:29 2015 UTC,I'm confused. You didn't like the DLC presented so you refunded the base game?

Games,3dinlk,momuse888,12,Fri Jul 17 04:41:20 2015 UTC,Well I had been on the ropes about it and after I had already pre-ordered they came out with the $40 season pass and MK X was such a disaster for me I thought it was gonna be the same thing...Horrible launch and an expensive dlc pass. So I took a queue from some people who said they'd rather wait for the goty edition for less and after the bugs should be fixed. One time I do that it paid off.
Games,3dinlk,Cheezelog,5,Thu Jul 16 21:34:37 2015 UTC,"Plus, there will probably be a ""GOTY"" edition eventually anyway."

Games,3dinlk,Cheezelog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:00:36 2015 UTC,Good. The ending was a major disappointment and one of the DLCs is set to have events after the game and maybe that will expand more on the ending we got.

Games,3dinlk,Tomhap,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:23:01 2015 UTC,Depends on how you define massively broken I guess. Right off the bat in Skyrim the opening wagon sequence can fail to even complete if your frame rate is over 60 resulting it not even being able to start the game.  During the main quest line I encountered a bug which resulted in not being able to continue. The fix which I found via Googling was to go into the game directory and unzip a sound file which was suppose to be unzipped during installation. Without that sound file the quest giver wouldn't open a door which you needed to get through.  And that's just the tip of the iceberg. And let's not even mention the complete shitstorm that was the PS3 version.

Games,3dinlk,bookerdewittt,-1,Sat Jul 18 18:23:02 2015 UTC,When you mean DLC from before did you mean Harley's Revenge and Cold Cold Heart from the last two games? Because I found those two fantastic. It's too bad Arkham Knight somehow lost 25% of the quality the last games had.

Games,3dinlk,Cheezelog,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:24:36 2015 UTC,"It's still an awesome game. Saying its a bit worse than the rest of the series means it's still very good, it just doesn't invest you like the others did"

That being said, I did have some hope that this DLC would be good quality, considering it was developed by the devs of Origins and, by extension, Cold, Cold Heart, but it appears that it instead ended up down with the mediocrity that makes up the rest of the series' DLC"
Games,3dinlk,ShadowStealer7,7,Fri Jul 17 07:47:06 2015 UTC,"Considering how quickly it came out the chances are this was finished well before the game launched.  Even if they didn't, I think Rocksteady is just kind of bad at DLC, they had a year to make Harley Quinn revenge for arkham city and it wasn't much better than this is, slightly longer, but not much better."
Games,3dinlk,needconfirmation,8,Thu Jul 16 19:01:55 2015 UTC,"Different studio actually, it was the guys who made Origins. Good chance they were making the DLC while Rocksteady was making the main game."
Games,3dinlk,TheGasMask4,22,Thu Jul 16 21:09:20 2015 UTC,Well it's three times longer and actually has a plot. Not a great plot but probably passable as an ummemorable episode of The Animated Series. The theme park is built on an oil platform so visually there's a bit of something. But yeah this is still not up to the quality of the main game by any means.  Also Batgirl is hot and Harley is in her proper outfit versus some Lolita nightmare. There is that.
Games,3dinlk,BlueHighwindz,9,Thu Jul 16 19:23:12 2015 UTC,"It's pretty much one level of the main game: 3 or 4 main objectives, a few rooms with a bunch of bad guys to beat up, a few stealth sections and then a boss (thankfully not a tank battle)  Batgirl also feels different than Batman, she's quicker and I really liked her hacking gadget during the stealth sections. Her moves are way cooler too.  It's longer than the preorder bonuses (Harley and Red Hood) and it's only about 8 bucks..I really don't see why people have a problem with it"
Games,3dinlk,jjeeper,4,Fri Jul 17 00:22:40 2015 UTC,8 bucks is a lot for what you just described.
Games,3dinlk,MrMulligan,6,Fri Jul 17 04:34:55 2015 UTC,It's DLC. It's purpose is to give more content to people who want more content. That's all.

I've said it in a couple of other threads already, but why the hell can't we use these extra characters in challenge maps? Harley, Red Hood and Batgirl are only playable in their own extremely bare bones story missions. This wasn't the case in previous games - but then again, they also gave a shit about challenge mode in previous games. Here it's just a couple of highlights from the main game at one difficulty level. Why are there only three predator missions available?  But more importantly, why can we not use Robin, Nightwing and Catwoman outside of the main story? There's no excuse for them, they're in the game, they should be playable. The only explanation for this is that they're again planning to sell us pieces of the game we bought as DLC.   I'm hoping this is just WB's usual bullshit instead of Rocksteady themselves."
Games,3dinlk,RequiemEternal,30,Thu Jul 16 19:00:50 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised there hasn't been a bigger stink about this, without the challenge maps the Batman games have zero replayability and creating all those characters but not letting you play the challenges with them is just mind bogglingly stupid.

Games,3dinlk,Ponce_In_A_Blue_Box,4,Thu Jul 16 19:17:56 2015 UTC,"Ironically, the PC version of it is probably the only place you will be able to mod those characters in and play with them."

Games,3dinlk,jjeeper,9,Fri Jul 17 00:25:58 2015 UTC,"but why the hell can't we use these extra characters in challenge maps?   Well to do that, there would have to be actual challenge maps to begin with.   Those half assed AR activities are not challenge maps as we know them from previous games."

Games,3dinlk,littlestminish,65,Thu Jul 16 21:12:31 2015 UTC,"I don't really get some of the complaints:   While the Harley Quinn pre-order Arkham Story didn't have any cutscenes, it at least had a unique look that played up to Harley's character; Batgirl's HUD is just the same as Batman's, only recoloured slightly.   Was anyone really expecting otherwise?  It worked for Harley because it was more of a glimpse into her mind.  When you enter ""Psychosis Mode"", the idea is that you're seeing your surroundings through her ""psychotic"" eyes.  Barbara works with Batman, and it stands to reason that they have access to the same tech.  Not much they could have really done on this front.   Batgirl herself controls almost exactly like her mentor. She's essentially Batman on a budget - packing explosive gel, a line launcher, grappling hook, Batarangs and a remote hacking device. And that's about it, really. There are no upgrades, no new gadgets, and no unique vehicles or skills.   Eh, given the aforementioned relationship I think it would follow that they have similar fighting styles.  As long as it's different enough and not a carbon copy, I'm good."
Games,3dinlk,Stupid_Moogle,68,Thu Jul 16 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"I beat this DLC with a friend the night it came out. It took us about 45 minutes; for comparison, the Harley Quinn and Red Hood packs took us fifteen minutes apiece. Batgirl plays nearly identically to Batman without upgrades (no armor and no knife takedown, for example).   The map is very small and there is no exploration; it is basically divided into contained sections that you visit in a specific order, have a combat encounter then leave for the next on the list. Off the top of my head, I believe there are two brief predator encounters (both of which feature nothing but gun-toting goons) and four brawls, which have more enemy variety but are ultimately no different from anything you get in the main story.  There isn't really any puzzle solving or platforming, unless you count the ridiculous trial-and-error carnival games that reward you with audio logs explaining how the small theme park was built. The boss battle at the end is just another brawl with added QTEs.   The DLC has no story implications or revelations and the dialogue is about as clunky as the other DLCs (""Grab her cape and spin her around!"" vs ""Are you ugly? Is that why you wear the hood?""). If you're hoping to glean some insights about the main story, you can skip this one.  EDIT: I'd like to clarify that the map is fully open, it's just very small and there's nothing but respawning thugs unless you come at the right point."

Games,3dinlk,CertusAT,4,Thu Jul 16 18:40:07 2015 UTC,"It really depends on how much you like the moment-to-moment Arkham gameplay because it's just more of the same. There are no new gameplay mechanics, just an increased emphasis on hacking environmental objects to distract enemies (making carnival attractions start flashing or turning out the lights for a few seconds, for example).  Personally I didn't pay anything for it, my friend preordered the game and season pass on PS4, I just go to his place and play it. I'm not invested, and that makes it hard for me to say it's bad. It was actually really good background while we talked about the new Star Wars movie."
Games,3dinlk,kalebmcc,7,Thu Jul 16 20:47:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah I definitely have my reservations after the Harley Quin DLC.  It was fun, but way too short and had no incentive to go back to it.  If the A Matter of Family DLC just amounts to 45-60 minutes of drudgery with boring audio logs being the only replay incentive I'll likely skip out.   the dialogue is about as clunky as the other DLCs (""Grab her cape and spin her around!"" vs ""Are you ugly? Is that why you wear the hood?"").   This really just comes with the territory for Arkham games at this point.  They go for the ""brainless thug"" thing so the dialogue is about what I'd expect."

Games,3dinlk,i11remember,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:24:19 2015 UTC,"I'm disappointed that the A Matter of Family DLC is pretty short, but I can see how it would be. I mean, with Arkham City's Harley Quinn's Revenge DLC we had a reused map and some new interior locations, along with some altered enemies, etc. It also allowed to play as Robin even though he had already been available to play with in his own Challenge Map DLC.  With Arkham Knight's DLC, we aren't seeing a lone expanded scenario with one character (Robin in HQR). We're seeing three scenarios each with their own playable character (Harley Quinn, Red Hood, and Batgirl) and each has completely new locations that are not reused from the main game (I actually don't know if this is the case with Red Hood though since I don't have his DLC yet).  So how do we even look at this fairly? Instead of a lone expanded story DLC like Arkham City's Harley Quinn's Revenge or Arkham Origins' Cold, Cold Heart, we have three separate ones for Arkham Knight. It kind of makes sense why the three of them are so short. If all three were combined I'm sure they would have added up to the length of the DLC's in previous Arkham titles. Pricing comparisons are up in the air right now though since Harley Quinn and Red Hood DLC's aren't available outside of Pre-order bonuses and Season Pass yet. But I know HQR's was $9.99 and that AMoF will be $6.99.  Plus, if anyone is feeling ripped off by buying the Season Pass, you can always look at this to see what upcoming DLC content will be."

Games,3dinlk,ERMF,2,Thu Jul 16 21:26:06 2015 UTC,"This is absolutely true. Especially for Dark Souls. I supported From Software's decision to port it to PC by buying it on PC (I waited! never played it before I bought it on PC!) and was severely underwhelmed by what I got. There's a difference between tweaking your settings to get the best possible fidelity and having to look up a manual for the keyboard controls because they didn't bother mapping keyboard/mouse prompts for PC and just kept the damn 360 controller buttons in the HUD and tutorials (looking at you, DS) and hardly any mouse support. When I complained about it when they ported Dark Souls, reddit told me to ""get over it and download the mouse fix mod that will probably come soon"" or ""use a controller instead"". No.  If your computer meets the minimum requirements the developer gave you, then it should work out of the box. Especially for $60."

Games,3diamv,Not_a_Zaku,2,Thu Jul 16 23:16:31 2015 UTC,"If games seriously started doing that, Steam would probably just adjust the ""demo"" timespan to match.  It's not like the ""two hour"" thing is written in stone.  And they can manually offer refunds past two hours anyway; that's just the cutoff point for the refund being automatically given.  Besides, that's not necessarily going to be beneficial to games with technical issues.  If it front-loads the first two hours with all the best material, that's also likely to be the most system-straining material.  So they'd hook in more people with good rigs, but lose sales from everyone else who booted up the game and got 20fps."
Games,3diamv,APeacefulWarrior,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:14:35 2015 UTC,Logically speaking it should stop broken games from being released at least on steam that is. Although we need too wait and see exactly how logical the games industry is.

Games,3diamv,AntiCitizenJuanMWO,4,Thu Jul 16 21:20:06 2015 UTC,"No one remembers a lot of Gearbox initial reveals. They do have a tendency to overpromise with their first reveals, but usually they're good at scaling that stuff back for the second pass.  Borderlands was supposed to have a procedurally generated map that fully open world, for example. The random guns was originally just a sidebar to the world generation, applying the same tech they'd hoped to use for the world to the weapons. Funny how a nifty gimmick from a larger system became the main selling point, and the initial goal for the tech was completely forgotten.  The big difference with Aliens: CM is they continued to pretend that initial reveal was the game right up until release, and they released a game that didn't even glimpse at what they'd been promising."
Games,3diamv,SwineHerald,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at least Borderlands 1 has the excuse that they were legitimately trying to make a game that was a bit different and mashing-up elements from a few genres that hadn't really been combined before.  So I'm willing to be more forgiving specifically because it was more of an experiment, and we saw the game evolving.   The change to the comic bookish artwork late in development would be another example of this evolution.  If they're doing a game in an established genre without too many twists -like A:CM was supposed to be- there's far less excuse for having early gameplay demos that look nothing like the final game."

Games,3diamv,HappyVlane,11,Thu Jul 16 17:36:19 2015 UTC,They completely ruined HW1 by porting it into the HW2 engine. The HW1 campaign is unplayable and the whole game in general is pointless since it's just HW2 with slightly different ships. The first game was such a deep tactical experience  because of the formations and the refueling system for fighters. Putting the game into the second games engine completely removed all of that. So as someone who played homeworld 1 long after homeworld 2 came out that remaster was just a slap in the face.  It was just more misleading BS from Gearbox because the first game was not remastered at all. They basically gave us what amounted to a mod for the second game that added in untis from the first game.

Sure  it could have been stronger but it was still good. BL2 tried to hit the high notes of BL1 100% of the time until it was just a loud mess of internet humor and crude jokes that fell flat. Mechanically BL2 was a superior game though."
Games,3diamv,Limond,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:29:54 2015 UTC,"While the humor may have been hit or miss, the other elements and mechanics of the writing were vastly superior in BL2.  The fact that it had a concrete plot and actually character development while still maintaining the stylistic choices (like the 3 trait characters) was rather impressive actually.  They managed to fit quiet a bit of depth of story into a world that by design shouldn't allow deep stories lol  People judge it harshly because they didn't like the humor, but ignore all other aspects of the writing.  I'd still argue that BL2 had better writing than most games that have come out since.  The dragons keep DLC being a shining example of that."

If you dont like that type of game play, you don't like that type of game play.

Games,3diamv,StaplesofDoom,68,Thu Jul 16 16:49:41 2015 UTC,"Oh look, another Gearbox ""vertical slice"" target render  featuring a bunch of things that never happen in the game dressed up with a fake UI! Thanks, Randy! What? You want more Vertical Slice Target Render Internal Preview Not Intended To Be The Final Product? Well, sure! This one is nothing but stuff that never happens in the game!   Man, the sad part is, I'm a HUGE fan of the BiA series. That Furious Four they previewed a few years back was a fucking slap in the face to every fan. Looked like they were tried to ape Inglourious Basterds, which was hot at the time. While I'm happy we might get to see Baker's story to it's conclusion, I'm so fucking pessimistic about Gearbox after that whole Alien: CM debacle."
Games,3diamv,ShaolinSlim,25,Thu Jul 16 15:06:18 2015 UTC,"Fuck. Those videos brought back terrible memories. I remember seeing that early E3 ""gameplay"" walk-through demo for Hell's Highway and being pumped for it. Then the actual game was nothing like that at all.  I loved the first 2 BiA games but I don't trust Gearbox with anything after their recent track record. Hopefully they can prove me wrong."
Games,3diamv,RappinRandy,21,Thu Jul 16 15:22:21 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed Hell's highway.  That first video made it look like an On-rails shooter, which is a big no no. Still pumped for a new one.  Been missing out on a solid squad shooter."
Games,3diamv,ggrove91,5,Thu Jul 16 15:40:36 2015 UTC,Yeah the first video looked odd but seeing that second video I thought Hell's Highway was going to be amazing.  I thought Hell's Highway was okay overall but not nearly as good as the first two. I hope Gearbox can learn from their mistakes because if they can make a solid BiA game set in the Battle of the Bulge I would be ecstatic.
Games,3diamv,RappinRandy,3,Thu Jul 16 17:25:58 2015 UTC,"Me too, Hell's Highway is one of my favorite games. It looked great when it came out and the story was top notch.

There will likely be direct quotes from Mr (Fuckwit) Pitchford saying how much he ""cares and enjoys"" the series and that the graphics will ""look amazing and almost lifelike"". Considering the praise he dished out, and still continues to dish out, believe it or not, for Colonial Marines (aka WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT the game) I would take the word of Andrew Wilson (CEO of Electronic Arseholes) more seriously than I would Pitchford's.

And the historical accuracy is gone too. In the extras for the first two games you can see that they tried to make the levels a copy of their real life counterparts. In the third, levels feel gamey and the cool extras were replaced with ""recon,"" which just gave a little information on the battle as a whole. They threw out the super authentic locations for standard video game levels, which caused the game to lose the charm and appeal of the first two.

Games,3did61,Matthew94,15,Thu Jul 16 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"intellectual   I wouldn't go that far.  It's the same as /r/gaming just with a different tone.  Instead of going ""dark souls is the best game evarrrr, le dark souls amirite??"" it's just ""Dark Souls it unquestionably the best game ever"" and if you disagree you get ""you don't understand but i'm not going to explain"" and downvoted to shit.  It's the same shit just with less shitposting and more passive aggressiveness.  I remember when Bioshock Infinite came out and I said the ending was shit and gave reasons.

It set itself up as if it had a smart, thoughtful message to tell.  A large part of what we got was things like ""constants and variables"". ""Constants and variables"" really just boils down to the game saying that players will share a core experience (constants) but will have differences in how they play the game (variables).  This is such an obvious concept with so little merit that I kind of felt insulted that they included it as a key theme. It was even more embarrassing when people on here went around parroting it as if they'd had some kind of revelation.   At first I had thought that I didn't understand it but after the dust had settled I realised that I was right, that the message was indeed that shallow."

I feel the rules as a whole should be looked at carefully and consolidated a lot more.  I can argue that Rules 13 encompasses Rule 1, 3, 14, maybe 15, and now 17. Or Rule 13 is too vague to be a rule.  Rule 10 is awkward to read and I feel too limiting. Maybe some clarification on this rule is needed. Does this imply that we can not post updates (like KS updates) when the project changes / expands / exciting news is announced? Does it imply only direct links with the specific intent of posting about it initially and when its nearly done are part of the rule? Are general discussions allowed? Are news articles allowed for it?  Rule 16 is way too vague for the sidebar. That one should be fleshed out more for easier access to information.  Rule 2 is already apart of reddit.com/rules for personal information and the rediquette  Rule 4 is already apart of reddit.com/rules for spam  Is Rule 11 really necessary? That should be common sense from the name and description from the sub itself.  I realize these are all for driving the quality of posts, but I think it is seriously stifling valid content from users that are unsure if falls within the 9,000 characters worth of rules and don't care enough to see if it will conform the this subreddits rule set."

This isn't just the only case, it happens all the time now. /r/games used to be a good place to get news, but now the mods rule with an iron fist over stupid things so it really isn't a good place for news."

We'd love to have a simplified rule list but it's just not possible. I'll explain one by one as per your distinctions.   I can argue that Rules 13 encompasses Rule 1, 3, 14, maybe 15, and now 17. Or Rule 13 is too vague to be a rule.   Rule 13 is about regulating self-posts. The rest are link submissions. It's very easy for someone to argue ""but I'm just trying to ask a question, it's not a banned submission!"" They're just certain topics people tried to get by even though they're outside the scope of the sub just because they're tangentially related in some fashion.   Rule 10 is awkward to read and I feel too limiting.   This is mostly about keeping a handle on the lesser known Kickstarters, not stuff like Shenmue. It's mostly in the spirit of keeping things from becoming spammy or begging threads. It's also a WIP--it was updated just two weeks ago and some of the others are feeling out if the changes are better or worse. But the spirit of the rule is to prevent crowd-funded submissions from getting out of hand (e.g. a submission every day for the ever increasing DOTA2 prize pool is ridiculous).   Rule 16 is way too vague for the sidebar. That one should be fleshed out more for easier access to information.   It's one of the few rules with a link to the rule page. It's hard to neatly stack a list in the sidebar. It could be reworded better there, sure.   Rule 2 is already apart of reddit.com/rules for personal information and the rediquette   For the longest time, it wasn't enforced by reddit proper so we had to emphasize it. It may be more of a relic after recent events but there's no real rush to remove it yet.   Rule 4 is already apart of reddit.com/rules for spam   Blogspam isn't the same as spam. See this thread to see how various reddit mods across a few subs define it. We're especially strict on it because we've seen article misrepresent entire stories before and cause pretty big snafus. This is probably the rule we gun most for, after 1 and 3. In this industry, blogspam is a huge problem.   Is Rule 11 really necessary? That should be common sense from the name and description from the sub itself.   How we wish it was unnecessary.    I realize these are all for driving the quality of posts, but I think it is seriously stifling valid content from users that are unsure if falls within the 9,000 characters worth of rules and don't care enough to see if it will conform the this subreddits rule set.   The only rule that should give anyone pause is Rule 4, really. And that's just because they're either not familiar with the term ""blogspam"" (we didn't define or choose it, I swear) or they have to double check that their article isn't almost fully sourced elsewhere. It's pretty easy to avoid tripping any of the other rules as long as someone is submitting an article (with its proper headline) or posting up an opinion. Those were the two things this sub was made for. Everything else is just to avoid stuff like rumour mongering, customer service stories, memes, spam, bad titles, illegal content, and personal benefit."
Games,3did61,Shaleblade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:48:54 2015 UTC,"Rule 11 is to deter posts about youtube and twitch celebrities that don't directly correlate to games. It's one of the better rules IMO because there's already too much of that shit posted, drama involving gaming figures but not concerning games, shit about salaries or policy changes for web platforms, there's just a LOT of SHIT people try to post for either karma or drama that has nothing to do with games.  Rule 2 is definitely covered by reddit and unnecessary as a sub rule, but rule 4 is specifically to prevent blogspam. Gaming ""journalism"" is virtually all blogspam, and most of it is people trying to make a quick buck with ads and clicks. I agree it is probably sorta bullshit that kotaku blogspam is allowed but Random Joe Gamer #6109 blogspam is prohibited because 9 times out of 10 they provide the same level of journalistic effort, but I think the rule does more good than bad.  I hate rules and mods and authority but this list isn't arbitrary. Even the ones that don't belong exist to cite directly, with clarity and precision, why someone's submission was removed. And it works pretty well, at least for regulars. People occasionally pop in the IRC channel asking why their post was removed, and we can usually take one look and tell them exactly which rules it broke. That's probably 90% of what the mods do behind the scenes, telling people how to submit their content with good titles/real sources/good effort, and so forth.  That said... it's because of those reasons that I think 3 and 13 need revising with clearer language because low effort means many things to many people, frequently it's used to describe shit you just don't like, it's like an exclusive super downvote for mods. And the banned topics list is some of the most vague shit you could possibly ban, ""questions too general or looking for a solution"" What. I don't know how to make it better but you don't need to know how to fix something to tell when it's broken."
Games,3did61,Shaleblade,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:33:29 2015 UTC,"Rule 11 is to deter posts about youtube and twitch celebrities that don't directly correlate to games. It's one of the better rules IMO because there's already too much of that shit posted,   If /v/ adhered to Rule 11 its quality would skyrocket a hundredfold. I really appreciate that /r/Games has this, out of any of the rules. I really do hate this e-celebrity shit creeping up on this wonderful hobby with the rise of Twitch/Youtube LP/Hitbox and all that. It's just gossip and cults of personality."
Games,3did61,Shaleblade,4,Sat Jul 18 12:18:08 2015 UTC,Welcome to a medium size sub.
Games,3did61,Shaleblade,12,Fri Jul 17 01:42:12 2015 UTC,No Direct Links to Old Content.    Does this hold true for things like the link to TCRF from earlier in the week? It's been around for a while. Or is this just for the kinds of things that would turn up on a games journalism site?
Games,3did61,DubTeeDub,9,Fri Jul 17 15:49:26 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure what you are referring to with TCRF, but I think the goal is to prevent articles that are over a year old from being posted. Let's say someone writes a review for a game, and that review over a year old...It's old news."
Games,3did61,DubTeeDub,5,Thu Jul 16 15:06:20 2015 UTC,"This post. If it's basically just a ban on old news, that's fine, but it makes it sound like anything that didn't debut within a year is relegated to a self-post."
Games,3did61,Alinosburns,4,Thu Jul 16 16:58:37 2015 UTC,"The rule applies to content itself, not what it's referring too. An example another mod gave was that a review recently written about a game 5 years old would be okay."
Games,3did61,DubTeeDub,5,Thu Jul 16 17:06:23 2015 UTC,"Right, but this example's a grey area. It's been around for over a year, but it's constantly getting new content. However, the link was just to the homepage, not to specifically new content. The rule is simple and sensible in the context of news, reviews, and stuff like that. How does it apply to less straightforward stuff like this?"
Games,3did61,NotSafeForShop,3,Thu Jul 16 18:03:03 2015 UTC,"Personally I'd like to see the link go to whatever the new content is, but otherwise that's okay. I mean....We have to use our best judgement. If someone is posting a link every week because a new page on the site was created....Obviously it's going to get out of hand. If something old gets new content, or receives an update, that wouldn't violate the rule. Terraria received an update but the game is well over a year old...Obviously we are going to be okay with that information being posted.   Again I think we are focusing on old news or information that hasn't been touched in over a year. New content or news related to something old is fine.  I want to make sure I'm understanding your concerns correctly, let me know if not. I hope this helps."
Games,3did61,DubTeeDub,0,Thu Jul 16 18:16:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think that's fair. I think it's a good rule for news, I just wanted to know whether posts like the one I chose would be targeted. Even though the site's not new, I liked the discussion on it and there's not really a convenient way to point people at new content in a user-friendly way. Basically, in cases where something could be argued as either old or new (e.g. wiki-esque sites) I think it would be more constructive to learn towards allowing, or at least taking it on a case-by-case basis."
Games,3did61,NotSafeForShop,10,Thu Jul 16 18:35:56 2015 UTC,"Great update.  Thanks for changing around the weekly discussion threads.  I look forward to the new format.  I would like to make a request that the Rule 11 rule be changed or at least made a bit more lenient.    There are a number of great industry analysis pieces and op-eds that get removed due to this rule and I think it does a disservice to the subreddit to keep them out.  For instance, this week Polygon did this large multiple chapter piece on EA called ""How EA Lost its Soul.""  http://www.polygon.com/a/how-ea-lost-its-soul  The piece got posted here and removed under the Rule 11 restirction.  I dont really see how a piece like this qualifies as ""non-gaming pieces on industry figures.""  It is an expansive piece digging into the history of one of the largest game publishers today.  Is there anyway that you all can allow more of these types of posts here?"
Games,3did61,DubTeeDub,9,Thu Jul 16 19:35:28 2015 UTC,"Hey, this was actually me who removed this particular article.  It felt pretty borderline to me, and I talked with a couple mods before I did it as I was going back and forth on it, also the web page isn't really loading correctly for me on Chrome but that's a seperate issue.  Looking at it further I think I actually made a bad call on this one as it's a pretty good read overall. Sorry about that and if you want to repost it I can approve it. The title seemed a little sensational but overall I think it's ok."
Games,3did61,Lmaolikeacow,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:47:08 2015 UTC,Hmm.  It's not letting me submit it on my phone app since it's already submitted.  Oh well.  I do think you think you guys could be more lenient with industry analysis and other articles like this.  I appreciate you responding and but it would be nice if you all relaxed that rule or restricted it to certain topics like gamergate as originally intended.  Thanks.
Games,3did61,Tchaikovsky1812,1 point,Fri Jul 17 02:21:39 2015 UTC,"I do think you think you guys could be more lenient with industry analysis and other articles like this.   I would just point out that I'd argue that piece is an oddity amongst the norm. Most articles aren't that fleshed out or lengthy.    ""What cause the Downfall of THQ?""  ""UDraw""  I mean that's simplifying things and there are some decent articles out there in the web that detail an opinion of someone they interviewed of what went wrong.   But again those long form pieces aren't what makes site's cashola and as a result they tend to be rare occurances. Which makes it harder to deal with since the rule is supposed to stop the day to day trite that makes the rounds. And these articles get swept up as collateral."
Games,3did61,Alinosburns,2,Fri Jul 17 02:29:35 2015 UTC,Exactly.  There are not a lot of those long-form articles and I would like to read them.  I think it is silly that they are potentially all getting removed due to the overuse of the rule.
Games,3did61,DubTeeDub,2,Fri Jul 17 10:11:00 2015 UTC,"While you're right about the Polygon article being removed being a problem, I believe the rule is designed to keep that Kotaku-In-Action junk out of the sub, which is an absolutely welcome approach. Good to see the mod admit they made the wrong call on the longform article. That was a really excellent piece of journalism."
Games,3did61,trimun,2,Fri Jul 17 11:29:00 2015 UTC,"I just think if a piece of journalism is getting caught up in the rule then it is too broad.  I agree that the twitter posts and digging into personal lives doesn't belong, but if that's it then change the rule so it's more accurate to the intent."
Games,3did61,Piemonkey,2,Fri Jul 17 15:25:48 2015 UTC,In the specific case you cited I think the mod was just wrong about the rule being applied. He said so himself. No need to change it.
Games,3did61,notjawn,4,Fri Jul 17 15:40:03 2015 UTC,I've seen the same thing apply multiple times to op-eds / analyses / etc.  That was just the most recent case.
Games,3did61,mulholland,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"The few cases I remember using that rule for articles, it was over articles based solely around going after someone else's thoughts on a matter, not over anything to do with a game or gaming situation.  This is the same thought process that /u/That_otheraccount erred on the wrong side with. He felt the article was more about the people behind EA than the company itself. But this is moot, as you can see that he recanted his judgement on the matter. But for many of those others, it's a simple question: is this about a game or about a person?"
Games,3did61,notjawn,2,Fri Jul 17 16:25:59 2015 UTC,The less polygon gets attention the better
Games,3did61,Sca4ar,11,Fri Jul 17 20:50:43 2015 UTC,Good articles should get attention regardless of source and clickbait should be ignored. These news sites are driven by page views/revenue
Games,3did61,turikk,5,Thu Jul 16 19:10:19 2015 UTC,Yup which is why the article span's multiple pages to drive those page clicks up.
Games,3did61,Bartiemus,6,Thu Jul 16 19:38:12 2015 UTC,"Okay, well say that the piece came from Eurogamer or Escapist.  Why prevent these actual investigative journalism pieces from being posted here?"
Games,3did61,BrianX44,4,Fri Jul 17 10:11:32 2015 UTC,"I think the popularity of the subreddit has turned it into a hypetrain/viral marketing hub. Its still the best sub for gaming discussion but I find it hard to believe that, for example, all the recent Warhammer hype has been 100% user-generated."
Games,3did61,creesch,3,Thu Jul 16 19:14:45 2015 UTC,Warhammer has always been super popular on this subreddit. And they've definitely chosen a very specific moment in time to unleash this deluge of Warhammer stuff. There hasn't been any strangeness with the voting or comment ratios on any of those Warhammer posts--they're all quite normal.
Games,3did61,creesch,5,Fri Jul 17 15:25:15 2015 UTC,Just want to give my thanks.  You guys have really turned the sub around a new corner and its finally a proper /r/gaming replacement after it became a meme dump.
Games,3did61,Shadic,3,Fri Jul 17 21:00:16 2015 UTC,Really?  I've unsubscribed from Gaming for about 2 years and still think despite some bandwagoning this sub has been really awesome.  I hope that despite it's popularity it never becomes a default because no number of mods can keep up with that level of shit content and comments.
Games,3did61,TimeLordPony,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:21:17 2015 UTC,Gaming was awesome until they started allowing memes.  It had a bigger following than gamepro and some other major gaming websites.

Games,3did61,picflute,9,Tue Jul 21 12:19:37 2015 UTC,"Either rules need to be more clarified, or mods need to be less delete heavy.   Rule 11 is vague and is often used to remove any post without another word."
Games,3did61,OhUmHmm,4,Fri Jul 17 22:14:45 2015 UTC,"I think Monday is a fine day for the retrospectives, since some are probably busy during the weekends and could use the discussion as a catch-up for the news they missed.   On the ""state of the subreddit,"" it's not uncommon, for me at least, to find people on other gaming related subs who find /r/Games ""pretentious."" It doesn't really bother me that standards are kept as far as content and comments go, but I wanted to know what you guys thought about that. I personally find the moderation and content here just fine, so I'd like to hear differing opinions."
Games,3did61,KingMoonfish,13,Fri Jul 17 22:21:28 2015 UTC,"As an off the cuff opinion regarding that, I feel like ever since we first announced the creation of /r/Games and it's focus on ""higher quality"" content there have been groups of people voicing their opinion that they thought we were pretentious. Personally I think this comes from groups that tend to gravitate more toward the lighter gaming content (screenshots, quick humor, etc.) and the thought of dedicating a subreddit to more in-depth content would seem like the people there would be taking a hobby that can be viewed as purely entertainment/time wasting way too seriously.  I can see where they're coming from, especially since we've felt that we need to exclude most of the lighter content in order to encourage the more in-depth content - it's easy to take a quick glance, see a group of people that removed all of the light humor for ""serious talk"", and think that they're taking it way too seriously and end up being pretentious.  I don't agree with them though - I think that most of the community here still likes a lot of that lighter content at times, but we also like the more in-depth stuff and having a space that works hard to encourage the more in-depth content without letting it get choked out by quicker, more broadly appealing content is important.  As a side note, we've been having some internal discussions on additional more ""fun"" community things we could do, which I think could help with some of the perceptions that we're a ""pretentious"" group. Hopefully once things with our mod team settle down a bit we can get those ironed out and announced, but we're not ready to say much more yet."
Games,3did61,Forestl,5,Thu Jul 16 15:35:45 2015 UTC,"Honestly, why does it matter if other users think the sub is pretentious, so long as it isn't prohibitive to new posters? I rarely post here but read the sub a decent amount, and have never felt like I couldn't post a comment about something."
Games,3did61,KingMoonfish,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:32:27 2015 UTC,"Personally I think this comes from groups that tend to gravitate more toward the lighter gaming content   Personally I think it's because the people on this subreddit are very similar to said people from those communities. The ""depth"" they appear to present is very shallow which is why /r/games has the reputation.  Most of the opinions on here are usually just groupthink and any dissent is downvoted."

I think that would be so awesome, and a lot of people were down for the idea.

The puggie, nine times out of ten, is someone literally below level 5 who attempts to try and repair shit with the mallet, for those that regularly play engineer (AKA, me), this is insanely frustrating, especially as these players never listen if we use the in-game voice. And god help us if the puggie is a gunner or pilot.  Additionally, the game seems to have swapped out the server browser for automated matchmaking, which takes fucking forever even at peak hours. Not only that, but we are -always- set up against teams twice our level, and as said we tend to be dragging in a puggie who is almost always an obscenely low level. The opponents also tend to share clan names, indicating they're a full pre-made of 4 or even a full TEAM.  In-game, ignoring the puggie derping around and doing nothing to actually contribute, we just get spawn camped. Over, and over, and over. We spawn, then we get blown up in mere seconds, I don't even manage to reach the hull to repair it before we're dead. According to the forum, we were getting ""meta'd"", in that the other teams found the perfect combination of weapons and know our spawn spots.  When it was heavily populated, I enjoyed GoI greatly, we all did. But now? I honestly can't enjoy it anymore. I'd like to practice and get better, but my friends are rather casual gamers (For lack of a better term) and will straight up not play something if they get too frustrated, and I don't blame them. Why should we smack our heads against a brickwall for hours and hours before we start having fun, when we can just play something else and have fun right away? It seems GoI's playerbase is predominantly veterans now, as every single match has followed the exact same pattern. Anyone who isn't a top level veteran with hundreds of hours is someone who bought the game recently in a bundle and likely just had their first match with us, before most likely uninstalling the game. Then you have me and my two friends, who are a notch above noobs, but we definitely don't have the skill or co-ordination of a veteran full pre-made, and matchmaking simply can't find -any- midrange players to match us with, it's either with noobs, elites, or nothing."
Games,3djhxv,Ranor,3,Thu Jul 16 21:22:52 2015 UTC,"I think you might mean ""pubbie"" which is the slang term for a player in a public match.  Guns of Icarus always felt clunky to me. The UI isn't great and the ships just felt too ""floaty"" (no pun intended) - it's like the ships have no mass."
Games,3djhxv,ReactorW,13,Fri Jul 17 05:19:42 2015 UTC,"Pug is a term, that as far as my knowledge goes, originates from MMOs: Pick Up Group. A puggie, then, is a member of the group who has been randomly picked up somewhere. I'd say that is appropriate here too."

But basically they use the thing which induces a MASSIVE repair cooldown on the component they just hit, usually the one I'm repairing with the -correct- tool. This makes it take even longer to repair as they're repeatedly mashing it (Ignoring the fact there's a fucking cooldown) with the wrong tool, and usually it's something like one of our main guns, engines, the hull or balloon."

Games,3difid,AzurewynD,18,Thu Jul 16 16:36:59 2015 UTC,I've come to terms with the fact that your choices in Telltale games are always going to be a little meaningless. That being said the Game Of Thrones choices have seemed a lot more transparent than their other games. They did a lot better job of masking it in TWD/Wolf among us. Kind of disappointing.
Games,3difid,passworduno,5,Thu Jul 16 22:32:15 2015 UTC,basically all of their games each and every time
Games,3difid,zsajak,-7,Thu Jul 16 23:46:42 2015 UTC,And they're better for it.    Edit: I swear to god people give this game so much unwarranted shit because it's not the game they misunderstood it to be. TellTale have stuck to this formula for a long time; it's you lot who don't understand this and think they're tricking you or something.
Games,3difid,DontGetBit,0,Thu Jul 16 20:25:45 2015 UTC,Why is it better to make your choices not matter?
Games,3difid,Damuel,19,Fri Jul 17 06:21:22 2015 UTC,"They DO matter. They completely change your emotional experience with the game. You decide the character's motivations and responses. In TWD you can make Lee a loving father figure with a heart of gold, a cold pragmatist, or a hotheaded asshole. They all fit in to the same plot structure, but you the player/viewer get a personalized experience.    Like someone else said; Ethan dies in ep1 no matter what. But how you play him changes your perspective a lot. You can make him a shortsighted prick who 'had it coming' or a promising ruler tragically murdered before his time.    Your changes matter because they change the tone and the motivations of the entire story."
Games,3difid,DontGetBit,5,Fri Jul 17 08:09:04 2015 UTC,"Good response! I'm a little sick and tired of people complaining about ""illusion of choice"" in Telltale games. The choices you make in these games might not change the ultimate fate of your character or other NPCS, but they still do matter. And there is no ""illusion"" to them."
Games,3difid,MattDobson,4,Fri Jul 17 08:52:12 2015 UTC,"The way you phrased it made it sound like you were saying the game was better for forcing you down plot lines. Agree to disagree on the choices mattering, it changes how YOU view them maybe, but characters will provide generic responses for almost every outcome anyways.   In TWD I can also side with Kenny on every thing except killing Lily's father and he will absolutely hate me despite being my best friend up until then. And he forever dislikes me for ONE disagreement despite constantly looking out for his family.    Say what you will about Heavy Rain's story/writing, but they at least fairly allowed you to effect the plot of the game. Killing off the entire cast early, leaving specific members alive, missing the final showdown with some, etc. I would prefer if Telltale went more that route.  AND, to your other point about people expecting something different, you have to keep in mind the way Telltale presents the games. ""Hershel will remember that"". Meanwhile two minutes later he kicks you off the farm regardless. Telltale's descriptions of how their games work definitely seems to imply different outcomes, when they clearly are not. I genuinely don't understand why they keep throwing in these ""X will remember that"" scenes with the character dying seconds later though."
Games,3difid,Damuel,2,Fri Jul 17 12:28:28 2015 UTC,"People don't get this sometimes. It's the journey, not the destination. Sometimes in games your choices lead to a very similar conclusion,  but the path taken towards that conclusion shapes your characters."

Games,3difid,DontGetBit,35,Sat Jul 18 05:18:53 2015 UTC,The biggest thing with a lot of these type games is the illusion of choice. In the end so many things end up being irrelevant.
Games,3difid,sidious911,12,Thu Jul 16 16:39:51 2015 UTC,"It depends how connected you are with the game. You don't have control over the events, but you have control about how those events happen. You control who likes/dislikes you, who's in charge and who's a side character.  Example, Episode 1. No matter what you do Spoiler However, whether that's a sad moment about the tragic loss of a character who was starting to come into their own, or a moment of relief that such an asshole got killed off is entirely your choice.  I've never played a game without illusion of choice, that includes the Witcher and Mass Effect. Sure, you can choose something, but if you choose ""wrong"" (e.g. Kaiden Alenko in Mass Effect or Triss Merigold in Witcher 3) the game treats your choice as insignificant.  At least your choices have good illusion of choice in GoT. After I chose Iorveth as an ally in Witcher 2, they killed him off in Witcher 3. I would put a spoiler there, but Iorveth is only mentioned once in Witcher 3, and it's by a random npc that you can go the entire game without hearing.  Irrelevant is a matter of perspective."
Games,3difid,WumboWombo,8,Thu Jul 16 20:00:32 2015 UTC,"What bothers me most about Episode one isn't that I can't change the outcome, it's the the ""big"" choice in that episode seems to be completely irrelevant to how that outcome happens.  They make a huge deal out of choosing to fight or diplomacy.  I chose to fight, yet my people made zero effort to fight. We just let them walk in, the leader of the army wasn't even in the scene. It was literally like I had selected diplomacy, except for the fact that we didn't really do much diplomacy either, we just let them do whatever they wanted.   Spoiler"
Games,3difid,pragmaticzach,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:05:02 2015 UTC,"That depends how you characterize ""fighting"". Spoiler  Fighting, in that game, involves standing up for yourself and not backing down. Diplomacy involves taking minor losses in order to achieve victory Spoiler  It's not always about who's better with a sword. Sometimes fighting can be as simple as refusing your master when he asks for your seat."
Games,3difid,WumboWombo,2,Thu Jul 16 20:17:58 2015 UTC,"That would make sense if the army leader guy hadn't made a big deal about having the men ready to literally fight people.

Games,3difid,pragmaticzach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 12:48:10 2015 UTC,"With how much I hear his fucking voice actor, I refuse to believe Iorveth is dead in W3 until I've seen his rotting corpse, despite what some random squirrel might say. I believe he'll be in an expansion. Also, it's worth noting that roche, unlike iorveth, was super important in both potential witcher 2 paths, and plotwise makes more sense to show up in witcher 3.  While I was disappointed by the lack of a iorveth appearance,  I understand why they gave precedence to Roche."
Games,3difid,huntimir151,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:00:03 2015 UTC,"It does make the choices meaningless. You know that the outcome is going to be the same no matter what, so you never have to play smart, or think critically about your decisions.   Like when that whitehill guy was kicking rodrik into the ground, and telling him to stay down, or when his dad was threatening to kill your younger brother. I know that since it really doesn't matter what I do, I always choose the risky, defiant option, and I know I'll never be punished for it."

Games,3difid,tiger66261,39,Thu Jul 16 16:54:44 2015 UTC,"Because the choice-making mechanic isn't about changing what the characters do but, rather, why they do it. TWD season 1 ends the same way no matter what, but you can make Lee a saint, a cold pragmatist, or a hotheaded asshole and it makes for completely different emotional experiences."
Games,3difid,DontGetBit,15,Thu Jul 16 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"I tend to agree. Part of these games for me is constructing the story. Most of it, really. It's interesting to me that a lot of people seem to demand that there be noticeable consequences in the game for every choice, other than just knowing that you were a dick or knowing you did the right thing. I would say that if no choices had any impact on anything that would be overboard, but it is somewhat realistic to have situations where there would be no true consequences for being a dick aside from dealing with your own conscience."
Games,3difid,NotClever,8,Thu Jul 16 20:48:22 2015 UTC,Are you sure these games are for you? I don't mean that in an offensive way but if you don't care about the characters or why they do things what is there really that drives you to play the games.
Games,3difid,Seared_Ash,5,Thu Jul 16 21:41:49 2015 UTC,"I love interactive fiction and Game of Thrones, so yes, this game is for me. Or at least, it would have been (much more) for me if I was still under the illusion of choice like I was during TWD Season 1 & Wolf Among Us. Back then I was led to believe choices and consequences was a major pillar of their games, and that contributed greatly to my enjoyment of character and story. Now everyone (both Telltale and their hardcore fans) are saying that pillar never existed/doesn't need to exist.    what is there really that drives you to play the games.   Now that the illusion is broken, nothing. GOT will likely be the last telltale game I buy unless they greatly improve their formula."

I don't know, I think you're being unnecessarily weird about this guys comment, but whatever.    EDIT - Actually wait, he does imply that.  He's obviously played games prior to GoT by Telltale and that didn't stop him.  He's also been playing GoT, and is using the present tense instead of past.  I think the exact word I would use would be imply, in fact.  Funnily enough, the only thing not implied here, is the thing you have a problem with.

The writing is...okay, the dialogue sounds like it's written by an angry fourteen year old (Soooo much unneeded swearing, not even the shwo got to this level), and the graphics/engine are terrible. It looks and runs like something five years ago. I'm fine with how TWD looked, since that came out in 2012ish. But three years later, with a massive boost in popularity, you'd think Telltale would make their games look...better.   And unfortunately, I never enjoyed the Borderlands game, so I'm not sure if I want to jump into the Telltale game (Also knowing that the engine will probably run/look like GoT, although hopefully with less disgusting, muddy backdrops.)"

I'm giving the tales from the borderlands a chance since my brother and a couple friends are highly recommending it for the story. My brother and I have similar tastes and we don't play FPS games since we don't like it and have never played the Borderland series or even know the story besides it has something to do with vault hunting.

Games,3difid,A_Confused_Cocoon,5,Thu Jul 16 15:52:05 2015 UTC,"It's good and bad, if you'd like a slightly more detailed answer, here ya go:   The writing and characters are solid. The core family (The Forresters) feel like they fit in the world of GoT and their relationships to each other are distinct and interesting. The twists are pretty shocking and interesting. They got me good a few times even in the first episode. The Forresters are a ""good guy"" house like the Starks or the Tullys, it's fun to see good guys again so far into the story.   The downsides begin...   The Forresters are basically shoehorned into the world. They are supposed to be loyal Stark bannerman, but are barely mentioned in one line in the most recent book. Even tho they are hardly mentioned in the book (and described as little more than a ""hill tribe.""), the house in the game seems important with a big family and important resources and an awesome keep. You would think they would have played a more prominent role in the books if that were the case... The cameos from characters from the book seem mostly shoehorned in to say ""Look! celebrities from the show!""   The Walking Dead Season 1 made a good decision to set the game in a different locale with a different cast than the comics. The cameos in WDS1 were minimal and unintrusive. Enough to tie it to the world without feeling forced.  Maybe they were forced to put in actors from the show in order to tie it the show properly. If so that's unfortunate. Telltale has good writing and character ideas here.  Also the engine is really starting to show its age. It makes sense that they want games that work on mobile, but the game is super sluggish on my iPhone 6. The graphics and animation look super stiff. It's about time Telltale invested in a new engine.  All in all, I think Tales From Borderlands is a much better story because it isn't shackled in the same way that Game of Thrones is. TFB has awesome characters and good humor. And this is coming from someone who is NOT a fan of Borderlands and a huge fan of GoT. It's a shame because Game of Thrones is such a rich world, yet Telltale was forced to tie it so closely to the show.  Despite all my complaints, the underlying story is still good. The writing is still good, and the episodes are pretty damn enjoyable. If you are a fan of Telltale or the show I'd still reccommend checking it out.  7/10"

Games,3difid,Hiroaki,9,Fri Jul 17 02:07:03 2015 UTC,"As a huge Game of Thrones fan, it's fun, however I haven't felt compelled to play the last episode, I kind of lost interest."
Games,3difid,drd0ctor,14,Thu Jul 16 16:03:59 2015 UTC,I thought the last episode was the best one. At the very least it was the most well-paced one. It also has me dying to play the next episode.
Games,3difid,g0newick3d,4,Thu Jul 16 17:18:42 2015 UTC,"It did a really good job of making you feel ""weaker"" because of one of the main characters, its not often that a video game gets that sense of danger across.  Even in previous telltale games you never really expect your character to get wrecked, but playing GOT and how they have handled things definitely raises the tension as far as how vulnerable you are is concerned."
Games,3difid,DougyAM,4,Thu Jul 16 18:00:53 2015 UTC,"It's a decent story, but the choices mean nothing. You rarely even get different dialogue."

Games,3difid,UniversalSnip,2,Fri Jul 17 18:07:28 2015 UTC,It's not an adventure game. It's a story based point & click game where you have to make decisions which will have an impact on the story.
Games,3difid,Espada22,10,Thu Jul 16 15:52:31 2015 UTC,It's a story based point & click game   That's exactly the definition of adventure games.
Games,3difid,gullale,6,Thu Jul 16 16:41:55 2015 UTC,"These are much more linear than traditional point and click adventures.  You never back track, don't really solve complex puzzles and such.  Its pretty much like watching an episode and every now and then you get to interact with it a little bit.  I actually haven't played the GoT ones specifically but this has been my experience with pretty much all Telltale games post BTTF."
Games,3difid,MadZane,4,Thu Jul 16 18:18:07 2015 UTC,Well learned something new. I always thought adventure games were  the same as action games.
Games,3difid,Espada22,3,Thu Jul 16 17:45:41 2015 UTC,Except that the decisions don't impact the story
Games,3difid,WeCanEatCereal,23,Thu Jul 16 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"They do and they don't.  They do: affect how characters react to you and generally impact the tone of the story.  They dont: drastically change settings or let you play with a totally different cast etc.  Someone playing as a compassionate player will have a different experience from someone playing as a dick even if the end goal is much the same outcome.  Telltale games really stick to the idea of ""its the journey, not the destination that matters"".  If you are the type of person who will only do a single play through then the lack of drastic differences wont matter much if at all to you.  I only have one playthrough with previous telltale games and TWD is not much different from those in terms of what changes you can make to the story, and i have thoroughly enjoyed them all. (albeit TWD 1 and TWAU remain the strongest from a writing point of view)."
Games,3difid,DougyAM,2,Thu Jul 16 17:58:38 2015 UTC,"Plus, if you really think about it, if you had lets say 1 decision per chapter that had a majorly impacted the story, and the game is 6 episodes long, by the end there would be 26, or 64 different major branches of the story. It's insane to actually expect them to have THAT many major differences in the story. They would essentially have to write 64 different plot lines, increasing the amount of voice acting 64 times as well.  Life is Strange did it slightly better, having one chapter where you either save a character or let her die, but even then it almost immediately goes back to the same point."
Games,3difid,PostNuclearTaco,2,Thu Jul 16 19:48:01 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying it.
Games,3difid,Steellonewolf77,-4,Thu Jul 16 16:50:38 2015 UTC,"They're okay in my opinion. However, it's not worth the price tag if you ask me. Most if not all of the decisions make no significant impact on the story. You can try messing around with the few dialogue options, but inevitably you'll end up striking the same conversation anyways.  My suggestion would be to pirate it once it's complete, or watch a playthrough on YouTube. The outcomes are going to be the same no matter what."
Games,3difid,Ongobotoborotaan,-7,Thu Jul 16 17:53:10 2015 UTC,"No, not at all. I'm really confused as to why people pay money for them. They're nothing more than a choose your own adventure book, calling it a game is disingenuous."
Games,3difid,brokendown,6,Thu Jul 16 20:22:28 2015 UTC,It's a thing that you get to play on a video game console with a video game controller that you can lose at by playing bad or win at by playing good. How is it not a game?
Games,3difid,MisterParagon,-9,Thu Jul 16 22:36:35 2015 UTC,"Not gonna click it since the only one I played is the first episode for free, but it's really frustrating how long these take to come out. I wish they'd just all release already so I could buy the collection and play them all at once."

Games,3difid,TheJoshider10,12,Thu Jul 16 16:57:49 2015 UTC,"They are relative fast with GoT, Borderlands takes much longer to come out. But I rather have them work on an episode longer if that means the quality is higher."
Games,3difid,Pluwo4,-3,Thu Jul 16 17:05:48 2015 UTC,They've always been slow with releases. I remember when TWD season 1 came out it had a 1 episode per month thing and then there was the odd delay or lack of confirmation on release dates. After that I just wait till they're all out to get them on sale.
Games,3difid,TheJoshider10,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:07:56 2015 UTC,The reason Walking Dead took so long is because they had to completely rewrite episodes. I think it was like someone actually guessed/leaked(?) the plot and Telltale didn't like that so they just rewrote it.
Games,3difid,Rachet20,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:55:31 2015 UTC,That's what I'm waiting for too. Loved The Walking Dead but hated how long it took between each episode.
Games,3difid,BlankJebus,-1,Thu Jul 16 19:23:43 2015 UTC,Found the books slow and plodding. Couldn't be bothered with the shows. Thought the free download on Xbox might get me into the story better... Maybe give me the interest to try the shows.   Horrible action prompts in the first episode leave me frustrated and annoyed. Die over and over again although I'll be damned if I'm not doing what it wants. Dislike the series more now than ever.  Daughter backs me up.

However, refunds were introduced, and disaster struck."

Another example (that you did not mention) would be Sega/Creative Assembly with regards to their Total War titles, Rome 2 was widely considered terrible on release and for all intent and purpose it was seen as released a good 6 months too early at the very least. CA has since issued dozens of patches, released tons of free content and shown with the release of Attila since then that they can and will polish games before release now.  Yes it is important to call out companies when they fuck something up and release turds like BF4 or Rome 2 (at release), but it is also important to acknowledge when they try to make up for that and look to be trying to turn over a new leaf."
Games,3dg7ct,DougyAM,227,Thu Jul 16 04:57:38 2015 UTC,Not surprising.  I was figuring it would be 2-3 months for the game to be fixed due to how much needs to be done and tested before it is released.
Games,3dg7ct,Jarenien,68,Thu Jul 16 04:55:25 2015 UTC,I'm just glad I got the game free via the nvidia gpu promotion so I can sit back and laugh at the absurdity of the whole situation instead of being pissed off.
Games,3dg7ct,blankemp,19,Thu Jul 16 06:11:59 2015 UTC,"Same here it is still a great deal in my eyes was buying the card anyways, so will it just be patched in September?"
Games,3dg7ct,Deadcellz,10,Thu Jul 16 03:48:33 2015 UTC,"so will it just be patched in September?   At the earliest, it seems.  Since they only say ""Spring,"" AKA Northern Hemisphere Autumn, it might not be up and running until Thanksgiving.  Neither is more likely than the other, I'm just pointing it out to head off the inevitable posts from some folks on September 1 saying things like, 'WE WERE PROMISED A FIXED BATMAN BY TODAY, WTF?'"
Games,3dg7ct,sighclone,3,Thu Jul 16 04:41:09 2015 UTC,But have you ever thought of the card's real price if it wasn't bundled with the game?
Games,3dg7ct,MadmanGoneMad,27,Thu Jul 16 05:05:47 2015 UTC,It would not change.
Games,3dg7ct,mrstejdm,4,Thu Jul 16 05:10:47 2015 UTC,Last year there were 970s available without the game offer for £20 less at Scan.
Games,3dg7ct,CarltonLassiter,5,Thu Jul 16 08:07:34 2015 UTC,So we still got one amazing game (TW3) and one soon-to-be great game (B:AK) for half the price of a single game.
Games,3dg7ct,AndrewBot88,3,Thu Jul 16 07:27:18 2015 UTC,umm my card i bought was already on sale with a rebate and a free copy of the witcher 3. Newegg and other retailers were cool enough to throw in a free copy of Arkham knight after they started giving those away on June 1st to people who bought before then.
Games,3dg7ct,blankemp,88,Thu Jul 16 03:25:02 2015 UTC,This whole fiasco has been unbelievable so I wouldn't be surprised if it takes that long for them to make the game as good as it should've been when it was released.
Games,3dg7ct,Hurinfan,11,Thu Jul 16 04:10:42 2015 UTC,This whole fiasco has been unbelievable so I wouldn't be surprised if it takes that long for them to make the game as good as it should've been when it was released.   There is nothing unbelievable about it. People keep pre ordering so these companies have no insensitive to fix the game because they already have their money. The only reason this changed was because of refunds from steam. Pre ordering is idiotic.
Games,3dg7ct,Leknasant,3,Thu Jul 16 04:29:19 2015 UTC,"You know, I honestly hate that ""refunds forced their hand"" line. This is Rocksteady's last Batman game, but it's not their last game. If they had chosen to leave it as-is, they would have left a bad taste in everybody's mouth. That's the last thing you need if you want to keep selling games.  Also it's stupid to say that they only did it because of money. I mean, games are only developed to make money. No developer goes, "" let's make the best game we can, but doesn't make us money""."
Games,3dg7ct,DemonKnight,2,Thu Jul 16 07:35:13 2015 UTC,Incentive*(sorry)
Games,3dg7ct,trollsamii99,2,Thu Jul 16 06:25:24 2015 UTC,The still haven't fixed Origins from what I've heard. They could've done the same thing with AK. AK still sold well despite the bad taste Origins left in many people's mouths. People don't care as much as you'd think they would.
Games,3dg7ct,SageDivinity,3,Thu Jul 16 00:54:48 2015 UTC,I bet they would have gone back and fixed those games if Steam's current refund policy had been in place. There's not a lot of incentive for them when they already have your money. That changes real fast when the customer is empowered to get it back with a few clicks. It changes immediately when the returns get so bad that Valve pulls your game off its shelf.  It's going to be a very interesting year for PC publishers (unless you're EA and don't release games on Steam anymore).
Games,3dg7ct,Captain_Midnight,4,Thu Jul 16 06:48:23 2015 UTC,"Well, Origins was done by WB Montreal, not Rocksteady, so there's that. From what I've read about Origins, WBM only fixed bugs that prevent permanent progress. This is a pretty big contrast to AK, where Rocksteady is stepping in for their porting studio. The way i see it, AK sold well because it was the end of a good story, was done by a reputable studio, and had good console reviews.  I don't think that a good enough number of people care, but I think there's a bigger issue. I think that the problem is that now people aren't putting everyone necessary under the gun. Iron Galaxies did the port and WB was the publisher. Where's the blame for them?  I think it's unfair to say people don't care either. I know I'm going to have second thoughts about future Rocksteady games. I also know that there's others out there who feel the same way. Understand though, that not everyone is going to change at once and that makes it feel like no one cares."
Games,3dg7ct,DemonKnight,331,Thu Jul 16 07:24:40 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this whole game (console and PC) should've been delayed until October. The Halloween setting would make sense, it'd be more in line with the releases of the other Arkham games, and they could've added some actual boss fights, or maybe take out some tank fights"
Games,3dg7ct,Sormaj,35,Thu Jul 16 13:27:24 2015 UTC,"That was the initial plan.  The game was originally supposed to release in October 14th, 2014.  Then it was delayed until June 2nd and finally pushed back to June 23rd.  I imagine the fact that it had already been delayed twice for over nine months contributed to WB forcing the PC version out the door despite knowing it was a mess."
Games,3dg7ct,Tattis,162,Thu Jul 16 07:25:47 2015 UTC,"Honestly, this whole game (console and PC) should've been delayed until October.   Hold your horses, the console version ran just fine. Not worth it to delay a perfectly fine game for four months so that the dates line up."
Games,3dg7ct,youpostyoudie,70,Thu Jul 16 07:33:47 2015 UTC,"I mean, the thematic release isn't as much my concern as it is just the lack of boss fights and the way the challenge maps feel so uninspired, along with most stealth sections in the game"
Games,3dg7ct,Sormaj,51,Thu Jul 16 07:41:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think waiting an extra four months would have added any more Predator sections or bosses.  I'm not saying the game couldn't use more, they certainly could, but what we got looks to be what Rocksteady wanted to make.  I guess it could have given us more challenge maps, but I'm pretty sure they would have been sliced up for DLC, which apparently is what happened with most of the challenge maps."
Games,3dg7ct,cyberpunk_werewolf,11,Thu Jul 16 13:35:08 2015 UTC,"It's not so much the amount of challenge maps and predator sections as much it is the quality. This could be just me, but I found the stealth sections this time around very poorly designed. In Asylum, you had to think your way through unique stealth challenges that felt thought out. Now, they blend together and feel pretty uninspired.  And I guess with the challenge maps im mainly peeved that you can't use the other characters, where as in City you could. That's irritating."
Games,3dg7ct,Sormaj,15,Thu Jul 16 08:45:49 2015 UTC,"It's pretty bullshit, but I don't think extra development time would have led to more of what we want is all I'm saying."
Games,3dg7ct,cyberpunk_werewolf,6,Thu Jul 16 01:00:20 2015 UTC,"I guess I get that. I mentioned this in another comment, but I just feel like there's a better game hidden underneath the one we got."
Games,3dg7ct,Sormaj,14,Thu Jul 16 16:12:08 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are this: in general, pretty much everything from the original Arkham Asylum is improved in some way.  The Freeflow Combat is better and more responsive and the environmental takedowns are awesome.  Predator sections have all sorts of cool new toys to use and they give you better control over the encounter, as well as much cooler ways of dealing with enemies.  Also, the new medics and brutes add a lot of cool stuff to both types of combat without being cheap like Arkham Origins did.  Unfortunately, the game doesn't really utilize this very much.  I don't hate the Batmobile, because I think it's an okay version of Epona, but they really overuse it.  Battank is cool, but doing it over and over again wasn't fun.  Also, most of the militia sidequests are boring, and the boss fight at the end of them is a waste.  I'm not a big fan of that character (actually, I hate him), but I would have at least liked to have handed him his ass on a plate again instead of fighting another bullshit tank."
Games,3dg7ct,cyberpunk_werewolf,6,Thu Jul 16 17:29:24 2015 UTC,"The side missions are basically boss fights. And most of their past boss fights have been pretty awful, so did we really miss out?"
Games,3dg7ct,Tre2,4,Thu Jul 16 19:12:24 2015 UTC,Read his whole comment...
Games,3dg7ct,RippyZ,2,Thu Jul 16 18:02:10 2015 UTC,You know they would have taken that time to add a few more tank fights or tank puzzles.
Games,3dg7ct,ThePrinceMagus,15,Thu Jul 16 20:01:40 2015 UTC,"Arkham Asylum: Aug 25, 2009  Arkham City: October 18, 2011  Arkham Origins: October 25, 2013  Yup, seems like a good time, why not be consistent and release a decent quality game, at a time consistent with prior releases, and NOT ruin your reputation?  Fucking hell I'm fucking sick and tired of franchises being raped like this.   Sometimes I'll buy an original title. A lot of times I'll buy the sequel. I won't bother with anything past that anymore. Companies that pull this bullshit are on my ""fuck them, do not buy"" list. They only care about money, and being denied exactly that is the only way those greedy shits will ever learn.  It's a fucking shame how these assholes are so rampant in this industry now."
Games,3dg7ct,LeonProfessional,23,Thu Jul 16 18:35:12 2015 UTC,"Origins wasn't even made by Rocksteady, which means they were probably already at work when Origins came out, so they had even more time to make it right"
Games,3dg7ct,symbiotics,12,Thu Jul 16 02:47:11 2015 UTC,Rocksteady did not make the PC version of Arkham Knight.
Games,3dg7ct,vagisectarium,5,Thu Jul 16 05:24:44 2015 UTC,"no, but I'm assuming they already started work on the main game while Montreal did Origins, though yes, they did wrong in handling the port to an external, inexperienced company, even without the flaws, I don't find the game too compelling, a bit repetitive, and so far the dlc seems unimpressive"
Games,3dg7ct,symbiotics,63,Thu Jul 16 04:52:44 2015 UTC,"Ok, calm down.  Arkham Origins has been developed along side Arkham Knight.   The development time on Arkham Knight is actually almost 4 years.  It WAS supposed to come out in the fall of 2014 but was delayed a whole year to improve the games quality.  Arkham Knight had almost a whole extra year of development to ensure that it didn't disappoint.   And it doesn't. Critics and players alike agree that the game itself is great. This isn't about the game. It's about the PC Port. THAT is what is shit and that is where the issue lies. It doesn't take 4 years to make a proper PC port."
Games,3dg7ct,Unfractal,12,Thu Jul 16 05:07:06 2015 UTC,"A 12 man team Iron Galaxy Studios (PS Vita Borderlands 2 port among other console ports) did the PC port of Knight. They don't have any other PC ports on their resume, so it seems like whomever went to this studio to outsource the port chose poorly."
Games,3dg7ct,havocssbm,24,Thu Jul 16 05:16:40 2015 UTC,"Has this actually been confirmed? When shit hit the fan initially, people pulled out names of Iron Galaxy workers from AKs credits, assuming Iron Galaxy handled all the porting, but I never heard if this was confirmed.  It really is weird when companies like warner save money on this kind of stuff."
Games,3dg7ct,Unfractal,7,Thu Jul 16 05:22:27 2015 UTC,"Giantbomb said that they just helped, and didn't do the entire job."
Games,3dg7ct,hotweels258,18,Thu Jul 16 05:24:08 2015 UTC,Sounds like no-one did the entire job.
Games,3dg7ct,ChunLiSBK,7,Thu Jul 16 05:49:00 2015 UTC,"A 12 man team is more than enough for a pc port, You only need programmers, not artists or level designers.  It's much more likely the issues where caused by scheduling (12 men are still going to need 12-18 months to port) or the main studio simply not caring enough.  Edit: Actually you could consider 12 men to be large, like you threw 12 men onto it 4 months before launch. I'd be much happier with 6 men over a longer timeframe."
Games,3dg7ct,phire,8,Thu Jul 16 05:55:12 2015 UTC,And we all know how good that BL2 port turned out to be... Doesn't surprise me if they did another shitty port.
Games,3dg7ct,becauseimdumb,6,Thu Jul 16 11:39:03 2015 UTC,"It WAS supposed to come out in the fall of 2014 but was delayed a whole year to improve the games quality.   What the fuck was it a year ago, an MS Paint Slideshow?"
Games,3dg7ct,ERIFNOMI,13,Thu Jul 16 08:21:13 2015 UTC,"Probably more or less the exact game they released. The difference is in the performance of the game and various tweaks here and there to streamline or enhance the games mechanics and story.  I remember Giant Bomb doing a piece on it a couple months before it was delayed in 2014. It looked great but the performance was abysmal at the time. Obviously, Rocksteady realized they couldn't fix it before the release date so it got pushed."
Games,3dg7ct,Unfractal,8,Thu Jul 16 18:45:30 2015 UTC,I disagree. Have you seen how many games are out around this period? Star Wars; FO 4; NFS as well as the yearly sports games. A mid-year release would be much more attractive to the studio for sales.
Games,3dg7ct,mpg1846,2,Thu Jul 16 04:31:23 2015 UTC,Chill out. The game is excellent on console. The PC version alone should have been delayed.
Games,3dg7ct,laddergoat89,7,Thu Jul 16 04:55:20 2015 UTC,Witcher series got better with every game.
Games,3dg7ct,TruckChuck,17,Thu Jul 16 05:05:50 2015 UTC,"Arkham series too, IMO."
Games,3dg7ct,hotweels258,4,Thu Jul 16 05:47:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I thought all around Asylum was a stronger game than City. City was just too wide and the story really falls apart in the second half to me.  I even prefer Origins over City.    Haven't beaten Knight yet, but it definitely seems to be the best (albeit without any damn boss fights so far)."
Games,3dg7ct,SteveRudzinski,6,Thu Jul 16 06:31:34 2015 UTC,I've only played a few hours of the PS4 version of AK so I can't comment too much on it but I'd have to say that AO is the weak point of the series.  I found nothing to drive me forward in the game and monotony seemed to set in incredibly quickly.  Definitely agree with AC>AA though.
Games,3dg7ct,Wauughlord,1 point,Thu Jul 16 05:08:17 2015 UTC,"I disagree. I only played Arkham Asylum and Arkham City, though.  Asylum was a sharp experience with a great storyline and nice progression. City was the ADD of games, it was all over the place with no clear concept, and if there was any cohesive story, it was lost in the hours of travelling around the city doing nothing but looking for edges to attach to."
Games,3dg7ct,anlumo,2,Thu Jul 16 05:15:02 2015 UTC,"I'd agree that City was weaker than Asylum, too unfocused, but Knight for me is far and away the best of the 3. I'm only about half way through though so that may change but I'm feeling that it's one of the best open world games I've played in general. I particularly love how the side quests are handled, they give you the location of the first part of each but you have to find the rest yourself by listening to the enemy chatter and looking for clues as you're travelling round the city. Not to mention that the side quests are all fun and unique."
Games,3dg7ct,Cleave,5,Thu Jul 16 05:29:27 2015 UTC,Yeah no.  I'm more than glad it came out in the summer for console people like me. Summer is a drought for games and it ran perfectly on consoles.  And I loved the tank fights.   A late release on pc would've been fine though.
Games,3dg7ct,ReservoirDog316,2,Thu Jul 16 07:21:59 2015 UTC,"October is a slaughtering ground. Batman would probably do ok since it's a huge brand and Rocksteady already has a pedigree, but it's also a pretty big risk."
Games,3dg7ct,Phelinaar,30,Thu Jul 16 10:59:06 2015 UTC,"This is a big disappointment.  While I'm not too affected by this since I thankfully just started playing The Witcher 3 a month ago (and probably won't be done till around September anyways) I remember buying this on release day excited to play it.  Once I heard about the various problems it had I quickly shoved it in my back burner of games to play.  I really want to play this game, I just hope the wave of upcoming open world titles don't wash it away."
Games,3dg7ct,werdbird465,31,Thu Jul 16 08:26:55 2015 UTC,"It is a good game. I suffered through it, and put 40 some hours in. I still have riddler trophies remaining. The story is well done."
Games,3dg7ct,hoodie92,25,Thu Jul 16 05:46:24 2015 UTC,I've heard it's a great game.  Which is why I don't want to touch it till it's properly fixed on PC.  Don't want my experience to be ruined by poor optimization.  That being said I have a friend who played through it on PC and said he ran into almost no problems.
Games,3dg7ct,Maltbrew,13,Thu Jul 16 06:42:01 2015 UTC,I wish I had your self control. I've played about 35 hours on 800x600 resolution.

Games,3dg7ct,sergregor,3,Thu Jul 16 05:07:13 2015 UTC,I did the same. Unfortunately I wasn't so lucky. I suffered through it for 20 hours then hit a gamebreaking bug and lost all my progress. Now I am ignoring the game and anything related until it gets fixed then will replay it from the beginning.  I am a little happy that its August-November expected but I imagine it will be longer. Its not great but at least it shows they are taking steps even if its sideways for now. Should have been delayed in the first place and properly QAed.
Games,3dg7ct,Zakkimatsu,2,Thu Jul 16 13:27:09 2015 UTC,The tendency people have to buy games on day one without even thinking about it is what enables publishers to get away with shit like this in the first place.
Games,3dg7ct,blolfighter,2,Thu Jul 16 05:43:30 2015 UTC,"That's true, and I'm usually very cautious.  Rocksteady was a developer I had a lot of respect for though so I decided to buy day one.  I've learned my lesson now and I'm probably never going to be supporting them again on day one."
Games,3dg7ct,Heavenfall,72,Thu Jul 16 07:24:18 2015 UTC,"Not to feel entitled or anything, but I feel WB should offer something for the wait. People who bought it, played it, weren't able to refund because they played it, and got stuck with bugs now have to wait months for the game they bought to be playable. Not to mention the distrust that was created in the form of a slap in the face to the PC gaming community. They should see now that we WILL refund millions of dollars back from them and will be VERY skeptical of future purchases."
Games,3dg7ct,RequiemEternal,9,Thu Jul 16 20:30:02 2015 UTC,"weren't able to refund because they played it   Are we talking Steam refunds? Because while they'll give a refund for any reason if the game was purchased less than 14 days ago and has been played less than two hours, that is not the only reason they'll give a refund. Crippling technical issues in a high-profile game like this would be a good reason."

Games,3dg7ct,Wildperson,5,Thu Jul 16 13:27:32 2015 UTC,Judging from what I've heard about the game I'm going to subscribe to /r/patientgamers on this one. Problem now is that if that release has one single glaring bug it'll be stomped on mercilessly.
Games,3dg7ct,Juzziee,14,Thu Jul 16 04:48:38 2015 UTC,Thing is September to November this year is completely packed with AAA releases that an Arkham Knight re-release can't hope to compete with. Shame a famous franchise like this one has to end on such a sour note.

Games,3dg7ct,coolgaara,4,Thu Jul 16 07:26:46 2015 UTC,Funny thing is is that this game was supposed to be released last October and got delayed. What's the point of delaying it if it still came out like shit for some platforms

They said they wouldn't patch the game because they we too busy making DLC for it (which really shouldn't have taken as long as it supposedly did). It is only because of Steam refunds that they are even bothering to patch Arkham Knight at all. However, they'll take their sweet ass time doing it, as patching will cost money. Furthermore, the game was a commercial success, and they deifintely don't consider themselves liable at all to PC fans of the series."

The combat is so simple by today's standards since it has been immitated so much since. I personally found the Asylum less interesting than Arkham City, but I'm sure more people would disagree on that. City feels like a big step up from Asylum, even if it can be a step back in some places (as it loses some focus in going open world). I personally think it holds up much stronger, and better showcases why people love the games."

Grappling around the city toward your objective was a nice way to add space between what you were doing, and it was way more engaging that walking through hallways in Arkham Asylum."
Games,3dg7ct,Lavalampexpress,0,Thu Jul 16 14:17:04 2015 UTC,Even though that's the part that makes you feel the least like Batman (with the grapnel upgrade that basically let's you fly from one end of the map to the other without ever landing on anything.)
Games,3dg7ct,howtojump,2,Thu Jul 16 17:25:14 2015 UTC,"I like that aspect in the later game periods. Since there's no quick travel, it's good to be able to do one or two big grapnel boosts to reach a destination."
Games,3dg7ct,youpostyoudie,5,Thu Jul 16 14:38:58 2015 UTC,"I agree, City is my favourite of the series. Even better than Knight imo."

Still a great game, but I doubt I'll be replaying it."

Games,3dg7ct,CancerousJedi,5,Thu Jul 16 02:20:52 2015 UTC,"I've actually played some of City as well (played quite a bit of Asylum, a decent amount of City, and a few minutes of Origins, but beaten none - odd, I know), but even the open thing didn't grab me entirely. I'm not sure what it is, but the game somehow manages to feel full of content yet devoid of depth to me. There's always something going on, but it never seems to interest me much.  But hey, I'm no game reviewer. What do I know?"
Games,3dg7ct,HonkyMahFah,3,Thu Jul 16 13:46:43 2015 UTC,"Dude I felt the same way the first time I played Arkham City! It was cool, but just didn't make me want to keep playing. Then I got Asylum, finished that, and my 2nd time around ended up loving Arkham City. Gliding around in the open world, solving mysteries, felt so cool and liberated compared to the first game. Whereas the first time around it just felt too open, like there was so much to do but no reason for me to care about any of it.  So maybe try finishing Asylum and then giving City another chance, it might end up being one of your favorite games."
Games,3dg7ct,CancerousJedi,12,Thu Jul 16 15:27:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly if you're at all interested in the type of combat, I really recommend Shadow of Mordor.  I had far more fun playing that (disregarding glitches, framerate issues, whatever) than I have in Arkham Knight.  I can't remember all the gadgets and what every last LT+button combo does, nor why some of them work at some times and not others.  The Batmobile is pretty neat, but being able to ride a freaking Caragor into battle then diving off it onto some guy and having the mount attack stuff on its own is glorious."
Games,3dg7ct,konspirazytheory,17,Thu Jul 16 11:50:21 2015 UTC,I have to respectfully disagree. Mordor is way too simple and as a player you are more or less invincible whereas in Batman on higher difficulties you have to work hard to stay alive.

Games,3dg7ct,samsaBEAR,4,Thu Jul 16 05:43:50 2015 UTC,"It's probably the fact that it will be pushed to the release of Fallout 4 and frankly, anyone with a slight interest in FO4 won't have time to touch another game for some time."
Games,3dg7ct,WendysOrBust,6,Thu Jul 16 03:15:29 2015 UTC,"Maybe just not the biggest fan of the series.

Games,3dg7ct,siphillis,10,Thu Jul 16 04:31:09 2015 UTC,"So you've presumably waited for a good year and a half to play this since it was announced, but an extra two months is the cut off for you?"
Games,3dg7ct,Lambpanties,8,Thu Jul 16 04:54:52 2015 UTC,I really wanted to wait and play it on my PC but I figured I played the first 3 Arkham games on a console and I still had a great gaming experience. I ended up buying it on the ps4 this past Friday and already have 12+ hours into it. Such a good game with a polished story line and tons of engaging side quests. I think I will eventually pick it up for the PC when it comes out but I just couldn't wait.

Games,3dg7ct,myblindy,3,Thu Jul 16 03:54:46 2015 UTC,"What's the difference? To someone who only has PC, in a few months, Arkham Knight will be a full-fledged release too."
Games,3dg7ct,B_Rhino,3,Thu Jul 16 03:20:26 2015 UTC,"I'm having a hard time understanding this logic. Well, maybe you think Fallout 4 or something is going to be a better game and will occupy all your gaming time this year, that's fine. But if you're ignoring Batman because after two months of release it's ancient history for you, then this is very much the crux of the problem with modern gaming. Gamers have an attention span of a few weeks, during which a new game has to sell millions, because after that nobody cares, everybody is busy getting hyped over some new release like it's the Second Coming."
Games,3dg7ct,SoloIsGodly,4,Thu Jul 16 03:53:32 2015 UTC,Take a moment to consider that the entire company considered this a fully complete game worth 60 bucks months ago.
Games,3dg7ct,MaxDaten,2,Thu Jul 16 03:56:11 2015 UTC,I don't believe this [or any] company gives everyone a veto on releasing products.
Games,3dg7ct,Weltall548,6,Thu Jul 16 04:35:15 2015 UTC,"Honestly this thread is just full of massive hyperbolic discontent, much of which is coming from people who don't even own the game.   From a guy who's put 40+ hours into the game on PC so far and am only about 65% through, I'll say that I'm loving this game. I would recommend it to anybody with a mid to high level PC as it's probably the most beautiful game I own to date. Regarding the performance issues, as I said in another comment on this thread:   As far as the actual game goes, I've had no issues with it (on my admittedly very powerful rig including a 980Ti that the game came with) and I would have been rather annoyed if they delayed the PC version just to account for people with less powerful PCs. If anything they should have been more knowledgable and up-front about what the specs needed to run the game are, since even ""normal"" textures require 3GB of video card RAM (which most cards don't have at this time).  So, the product wasn't remotely ""failed"" to me. I already put 40+ hours into this game and fucking love it. When playing the game I absolutely see why less powerful PCs would have an issue with it because Rocksteady pulled no graphical punches and when outside there's constantly rain, pollen or other environmental factors across the whole city/sky. Further, the biggest issue for most people seem to be the Batmobile scene entry and actual BatMobile usage which I also understand, as that thing is a graphical beast.   From my understanding only people with a high amount of RAM (16GB) are getting the best performance out of this game which definitely suggests that memory leaks are in play, but once those are fixed and the game is re-released I couldn't recommend this more to fans of Arkham Asylum/City."
Games,3dg7ct,lonelypanda,3,Thu Jul 16 05:45:42 2015 UTC,"If anything they should have been more knowledgable and up-front about what the specs needed to run the game are, since even ""normal"" textures require 3GB of video card RAM (which most cards don't have at this time)   In combination with the texture loading problem it's a clear hint that the game is wasting or even leaking vram. Compared to Arkham Origins or Arkham City the graphic hasn't increased in that scale to match the raised recommended specs. Additionally the specs are raised only hours before the release. And it's not normale for a game to deliver only 'Normal' settings for textures, regardless how good they are looking. All together it's reasonable to assume, that they couldn't fix the problems last minute, so they have to cap the fps and in general the max settings and rise the specs. It looks like a disaster."

Games,3dioxt,ancientGouda,8,Thu Jul 16 18:16:42 2015 UTC,"I was never a very big fan of jumpscares, at least not when it's the only thing they use to make you scared. It looses its effectiveness so quickly that they just need to up the intensity of the jumpscare. But what they often end up doing is just make the jumpscares louder, which I absolutely hate.   So I'm glad to hear that they seem to be going for psychological horror and grotesque themes in addition to the inevitable jump scare every now and then. That seems much more interesting to me."
Games,3dioxt,Doomspeaker,3,Fri Jul 17 09:23:49 2015 UTC,"Also, think about all the times you were scared in real life, and how many times ""jump scares"" were involved in that. In my opinion they're just a cheap effect exploiting uncontrollable reflexes. Like, tickling my arm pits might make me laugh (involuntarily), but that doesn't mean the person doing it is humorous at all."
Games,3dioxt,dorkrock2,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:56:37 2015 UTC,"yeah that's a good analogy.   Making someone jump out of their seats is easy. It's not a problem to put people into a situation where they can't expect what's coming. Couple that with a loud scream and the scare is almost guaranteed.   But making people feel uneasy, without exactly knowing why is much harder. It's one of the reasons PT was so successful. Yeah it had some jump scares too but it didn't rely on them. The atmosphere was dripping with terror with all the subliminal messages and the subconscious clues.   And then there's games that don't really ""scare"" you, but rather present a story or a situation that is just deeply unsettling, like ""I have no mouth and I must scream""."
Games,3dioxt,OBrien,2,Fri Jul 17 07:52:11 2015 UTC,I'm on the same boat. Jumpscares just get tedious after some times and there's only so often a can flinch until I get bored.  I was hopeful that the game would go to this weird nice of horror with all their trailers and it seems they will deliver on that. I'm lookign forward to wondering where the fuck that sound came from or what exactly I am looking at.
Games,3dioxt,IamtheSlothKing,3,Fri Jul 17 08:02:18 2015 UTC,"I think deep down, even in spite of the universal dislike, people secretly like jump scares. Five Nights at Whatever is just a game of jump scares and it's huge. I don't know of a horror game without jumps so I don't have any basis for this claim, but I think any game without jumpscares would be tossed by most people into the same boat as Gone Home--a ""walking simulator"" that would be panned critically for not being scary.   Personally I think the atmosphere is more important than anything, and jumps/chases cheapen the experience by essentially cheating to make you anxious/panicked. You give me an amnesia game without chasing or jump scares, I'd probably be 100x more into it. Soma looks great but I can't help but be disappointed in the chase mechanic, just like every other horror game announced with chasing/hiding. It's cheap."

Games,3dpnio,jim8508,40,Sat Jul 18 06:00:01 2015 UTC,"I pledged $40 on Kickstarter. My opinions about Star Citizen:   Star Citizen's fans are loveable crazies. The sheer amount of video/text content CIG produces every week borders on insane. Selling $400+ ships is going to end in tears for someone. Either the people who paid $400 are going to be pissed off when their ship turns out to be hilariously easy to acquire in-game or they're going to butcher the reward/earning structure of a game in an attempt to placate their big money backers. I rate both options as equally likely. A lot of the design for future features seems really pie-in-the-sky and like the product of Chris Roberts fantasizing about his ultimate realistic space sim without stopping to think if any of the things he's talking about would actually be fun. Prime example: the recent piece on how civilian passenger ships would work. Absolutely nothing described in that document sounds fun. ""You can play this dumb mini game to mix drinks for your NPC passengers! Or you can hire an NPC to do it for you while you stare at the autopilot!"" I think pretty much everything other than ship/FPS combat (e.g. cargo hauling, ""planetary exploration"", charting wormholes, running a passenger liner, etc.) is going to turn out to be phenomenally dull and repetitive. For similar reasons, I'm skeptical about how fun any role other than ""navigator"" or ""gunner"" will be on a multi-crew ship. The roles described here sound like they'll boil down to tedious minigames pretty quickly. I'm deeply skeptical about how 'persistent' the persistent universe (PU) will be, given the heavy instancing. I don't see any way for player factions to have any significant conflict with each other, as the instancing pretty much precludes fighting over turf or setting up any sort of blockade (which other players can just turn the PVP slider to 0 to avoid). I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed when their own personal fantasy scenario (""I'm going to stow away in a cargo container and then hijack the ship that's transporting me!"") turns out to be impossible in practice. I foresee unforeseen technical issues pushing pretty much every major milestone back multiple months. If we see a PU alpha before 2017, I'll be pleasantly surprised. I will be completely satisfied with my purchase if Squadron 42 turns out to be a fun single player space sim. If, against all odds, the PU turns out to be good, that's icing on the cake. I hope they do a good job with VR support, because a space sim is basically the ideal genre for it."

Then there were a few mods that even worked in multiplayer and in general it was a solid game if you like to fly stuff with your mouse. Other than that, it was just a space game.  Star Citizen will be just another space game. It aims high and with it's current state, it looks like a fun dogfighter. If the egoshooter part will be like they show it off, then it might be way slower than the dogfighting currently is, which is personally no real fun over time.

It's a lottery.  Fallout 2's interface is functional and you can achieve everything it's supposed to do, but that doesn't mean it isn't utterly shit by today's standards. Skyrim has a list that for unknown reason starts in the middle of the screen, uses font that is visible from orbit, shows like 10 items at once tops, has no icons, no sorting and every single thing you want to do with it takes much longer than it should (ex. comparing 3 different items you just looted consists of: finding name of the first item on the list that you may not even remember, remembering stats of the item, scrolling through entire list to find second item, and so on). Inventory has like 60% empty space, with huge model taking half of the screen. Selecting dialogue options with mouse is broken - if you don't reselect the option you've got your cursor on after NPC stops talking, clicking will result in selecting default choice. Bethesda isn't a newbie in RPG field, it's not a great mystery, it's been done just right dozens of times (ex. in Morrowind), they aren't some indie 15-year old developer experimenting in unknown field. INTERFACE SUCKS BALLS. It is embarassing and they should be ashamed that a single person fixed most issues in less than a month for them.  Ok, difficulty is a strongly subjective topic, but just let me 3-hit this dragon or just watch 5 naked peasants kill it with their paper daggers. All dragons have melee attack + breath while flying + breath while on the ground, a true challenge requiring strategic mind. Dragons suck and are ""meh"" at best after the novelty fades.  I never said they are necessary to enjoy the game. Average games are ok, some people enjoy certain titles more and so on. It just could be a much better game if someone put some brians into design of basic features like skill trees not being deadly boring (ex. magic), overpowered (ex. enchanting), useless (ex. lockpicking)."

Games,3djqwk,frogfoot420,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:47:00 2015 UTC,Shout out to my boy Dark Souls II: Scholar of the First Sin! Hands down one of the best games I've ever played. I envy your fresh experience of such a game.
Games,3djqwk,TownieMesiah,3,Fri Jul 17 13:47:50 2015 UTC,"Well I've played through dark souls 1 several times, and from what I've heard is that its not as good as ds1 but still pretty good."
Games,3djqwk,frogfoot420,2,Fri Jul 17 14:00:19 2015 UTC,"Naw, people who say it's not as good (I've played through both multiple times) are just Dark Souls hipsters. The story and atmosphere in DS1 is stronger but DS2 is leagues ahead in technical terms.  The controls are tighter, combat better, multiplayer more responsive, and visually much more appealing (technically, DS1 still got that dank atmosphere).   Both games excel in their respective fields; when I want to go back and play more Dark Souls it's ALWAYS #2 that I start back up on. Plus the DLC's are just phenomenal and the community is still super strong."
Games,3djqwk,TownieMesiah,2,Fri Jul 17 14:03:55 2015 UTC,"DS2 world design isnt even close to godlike level design of the first game. Also the game is much easier and bosses are re-used several times in a playthrough for no known reason. Its still a very good game though, it just needed more Miyazaki."
Games,3djqwk,pazza89,2,Sat Jul 18 11:09:37 2015 UTC,"World design I'll take, but the boss rehash is totally a cheap shot given how many Dark Souls 1 bosses were pulled right from Demon Souls. I'd also argue that the only reason Dark Souls 1 was harder was because the controls and camera were much more difficult to effectively use. I don't even know why I'm arguing! Both games are incredible!"
Games,3djqwk,TownieMesiah,1 point,Sat Jul 18 13:24:13 2015 UTC,"They are incredible, I am by no means suggesting otherwise. I haven't played Demon's Souls, so I couldn't have noticed that it had similar bosses. I meant that you had to fight two-headed-pirate-swordsman like 5 times in the game where he was just a random enemy on the way and Pursuer so many times that it wasn't even funny, we joked with friends that once we will open the fridge and find him there. I played DS1/2 using KB+M, I had no issues with camera because of that I guess.  I think that DS1 had more instances of stun-locks (like Artorias' triple-short-jump) and strong hits that weren't possible to block or just wasted 90% of your stamina - you could block only one hit and regen was lower so it took longer to block another one without stagger. I replayed DS1 shortly before SotFS and I was stuck on S&O for like 8 hours again, then I played DLC for the first time on NG+ and I was stuck on Artorias for like 10h. I played SotFS (without really playing DS2 before) and most bosses died in first/second try. There were exceptions though, like Gargoyles where I spent like 3 hours (probably because I did it underleveled) and Ruin Sentinels where I died like 10 times. But the areas themselves were much harder from me, mostly because of me being stubborn and playing exclusively dual curved swords (haven't used shield even once) and leaving VIT and VGR at 4 points each. I finished the game with over 1150 deaths, the only DLC I finished was Frozen Eleum Loyce (which I felt was really similar in design to DS1, died there like 200 times). I finished the game in 80 hours, it felt like it had much more ""content"", but you spent much less time in each area.  About map design - if you check videos analyzing world in MapViewer, you'll see that many areas clip through each other, the distances and proportions are all wrong and some areas appear out of nowhere like the Drake-sky-islands area. That's why there are no shortcuts between area, which were a huge part of DS1.  I am mentally preparing for SotFS NG+, I'll respec into something that makes sense and use shield this time though."

Granted but your examples of games that look good in Unity, don't even look that good.   The Forest looks better than quite a lot of crytek/UE indie games.   Aren't you comparing the worst of UE with the very best of Unity here? The average Unity games does look a lot worse than your average UE game.  We all know that Unity is often lacking in the visual department due to it's poor optimization which is exactly what he is pointing out in the review ""it doesn't look that good, and it also runs pretty poorly"".   UE has rolled out their new licensing terms finally making it affordable for indie devs so the reviewer is probably wondering why devs use Unity. It would be fair to counter that with ""Because it's a faster dev platform for beginners"", however I don't think it's fair to counter with ""The best unity games look better than the worst UE games""."

Blaming Unity for someone's inability to craft a decent game is like blaming a violin because someone makes it sound like a tortured cat.   The reason Unity is so often used for indie games is because it is free, easy to use, has great support, and has a brilliant asset store. The reason so many games made with Unity look like crap is because the people who made those games are devoid of talent.  Keep in mind that Wasteland 2 and Kerbal Space program (as well as a lot of other great games) were made with Unity.   DISCLAIMER: I don't work for or have shares in Unity."

Missions to do on your own or with friends, as well as various open spaces to explore, a central hub area, a designated PVP arena (The Games), and some endgame PVE stuff as well that requires a little more teamwork than usual like the Destiny raids.

Games,3di89u,miked4o7,125,Thu Jul 16 14:07:10 2015 UTC,I would be curious to see almost the exact same study performed but with the woman voice replaced with a male voice that has a studder or other noticeable speech impediment. I wonder how similar or different the findings would be.
Games,3di89u,Mournhold,80,Thu Jul 16 14:40:40 2015 UTC,Agreed; I dont like how the study instantly jumps to something like male superiority or even mating behaviour. Much more believable would be that the women receive more harassment simply because being female is an assailable trait to the jerks. I would bet that black men or gay men would receive about as much harassment (the latter probably the most) but those traits are simply not identifiable over voice chat.
Games,3di89u,73INVC,39,Thu Jul 16 17:47:31 2015 UTC,being female is an assailable trait to the jerks   I suppose the obvious question is: why is being female an assailable trait to the jerks? Couldn't that be desire for male superiority or even mating behaviour?
Games,3di89u,jellyberg,27,Thu Jul 16 21:09:23 2015 UTC,"I don't think that it's being female in specific, they're probably looking for something distinguishing and different to belittle them about. Since they're sucking in game, they need to find something they can feel superior about, and its hard to insult someone similar to you and feel superior."
Games,3di89u,CharlieBobson,10,Thu Jul 16 21:52:52 2015 UTC,"That's generally the case when any group of people is 'out-grouped' by some people for some inherent trait they have.  When those instances happen to be due to gender, that's kind of the definition of sexism, isn't it?"

Games,3di89u,TheDdevil,43,Fri Jul 17 01:40:48 2015 UTC,"I think it is mostly because they are a minority in games. Because less women play games, people believe they are worse at games which leads to people harrassing them."
Games,3di89u,NitrousOxideLolz,7,Fri Jul 17 02:57:21 2015 UTC,"Certainly sometimes people will attack someone because they think they are ""lesser"".

Games,3di89u,Randommook,3,Thu Jul 16 22:00:57 2015 UTC,"I think its more just ""something different to yourself""ism that's the issue. People get frustrated because the game isn't going there way and blame anyone other than themselves, so focus on things different to them like ability, behavior, how they talk etc   Saying its sexism is both right and wrong, because in some cases they are being nasty because they are girls... but its not really because they are girls, its because they are different (as in , something different to the person whose angry). In these situations its entirely possible that any sort of difference would be focused on in anger.  Hell it wouldn't surprise me if there were insults about nationality if someone had a heavy accent. had someone tell me during a game to shut up as he was better (we were beating them) because he was american and americans made the game we were playing. Its even better than that, as the game was world in conflict, which was made in sweden :p"
Games,3di89u,TheDdevil,6,Fri Jul 17 08:23:31 2015 UTC,I suppose the obvious question is: why is being female an assailable trait to the jerks? Couldn't that be desire for male superiority or even mating behaviour?   For the same reason that age or race is. Because it is very effective at elliciting an emotional response from the other person.   If you decide to try to insult someone for being a completely vanilla white male what are you actually going to say to them that is actually going to get under their skin? Not much. You need a sore topic that you can prod them with to piss them off so if they sound young you can go after them through their age or if you happen to know that they are gay you can go after them through that but the goal of most assholes on the internet is to piss off the other person and to do that they need something they can use to get under the other person's skin.
Games,3di89u,Stealth_Jesus,3,Fri Jul 17 14:22:11 2015 UTC,"Because it's something obvious, something that can be easily attacked and used to see how you react. It goes along the same lines as someone who stutters, a boy who has a high pitched voice, a bad mic, or simply bad skill level at the game. Easy ammo that you can constantly use the entire game to annoy someone.  People mock you just to see your reaction, maybe you'll get annoyed or mad or maybe you'll say something just funny. Being a woman is just easy ammo used to mock you, you're usually either a girl or a young boy which both are perfect ammo for trolling.  I guess you could chalk it up as superiority sometimes, though I wouldn't call it male superiority. Women pull that stuff all the time too. To just say it's ""superiority"" is too simplistic, lots of people like to annoy people just because they can when at the sametime they don't have any opinions regarding the person. For example, someone can be constantly saying ""Go back to the Kitchen"" when a girl talks in a game yet at the same time they don't think anything less of women who plays a game or whatever."

There should be more info really in the article. The stuff about title was because in the /r/science thread the title was basically ""Low status males more likely to bully women"".... yeah it was that terrible :P  ""Its still a impressively bad title considering the methodology, as its not even taking into account other factors like frustration. There's also no indication of what the person was saying down the mic when using the man or women's voice (for all we know they said different things, its not specified what was said). Its also not said as to what constitutes negative. the phrase ""well done there"" could be both positive or negative depending on when its used (a perfect sarcastic comment to use if you have just blown yourself up with a rocket launcher for example). Does that count as positive or negative?  The conclusion at the end as well ""The one thing that is still quite intriguing is the result that the highly skilled men were more supportive towards women than men."" can you really draw that from this. It entirely possible that the highly skilled players are simply less frustrated at losing so have nothing to say, no reason to vent, this is again not factored in .  With the medias (both gaming and standard) habit of grabbing studies like this regardless of what they actually say, how accurate they are with their conclusions and the methodology used to come to the conclusion, simply to push agendas I would kind of hope the people DOING the studies would learn to headline them a bit better.  I can already imagine a few sites are happily typing up something right now as its proof that men are terrible!!!! Silly thing is there are plenty of better done studies that show there is a problem, but since this shows a dramatic difference in reactions despite the rather far reaching conclusions it goes for (and the terrible headline and dodgy data collection methods) it will be championed :/""  Now the article has been crossposted to here I give it 3 working days before the normal places start cherrypicking :P"
Games,3di89u,ninja_throwawai,63,Fri Jul 17 07:04:39 2015 UTC,"I wish the study had a way to correlate age. I imagine that the lower skill is quite often directly associated with age, and it's been my experience that younger gamers are much more likely to be negative towards females."
Games,3di89u,ArchmageXin,43,Fri Jul 17 14:18:41 2015 UTC,"I have a totally different experience and I wonder if it's based on where you play games the most. I only play on PC and I've found the jerks online tend to be 20-24ish, both in games and on forums, Reddit, etc. The most abusive, needlessly negative comments on games I've made have also been from people in that demographic.  Also, they're ALWAYS guys.   However, on Xbox, the demographic is probably younger. Both my cousins were Xbox gamers when they were kids, and only switched to PC when one of them got a job that allowed him to afford a real nice PC. Both of them have always raged a LOT in games, but they're both in their twenties now, so you wouldn't hear them raging over Xbox Live, you'd hear it on PC instead. IF this is representative of a trend, you'd see younger players being the more aggressive on consoles, and older ones being worse on PC.  Personally I've found that younger players tend to forget they were mad pretty quickly, whereas the early-twenties group will never, ever let something drop, no matter how small an irritation it really is. Additionally, the older group tends to intentionally do their best to frustrate other players, IMO. It's rare to see a kid go out of their way to ruin someone else's time if they're enjoying themselves, but it's pretty common to see adults trolling just to show off their ""superiority"".   In terms of the skill gap, I think there's skilled and unskilled players in every age group. But I tend to see more kids who are aware they're bad at games and want to learn how to play better, compared to early twenties-ish who don't know they aren't good players and don't want to learn. Many adults also play after a beer or two, which massively degrades their skill level.  However, none of this has much to do with female gamers specifically. I think it's great that the study has looked at that, because it's something I'd never even considered before, but there's scope for so much more research into this."
Games,3di89u,stoutcarrot,6,Thu Jul 16 14:24:44 2015 UTC,"One possible reason is guys who are older usually have limited amount of game time. I usually didn't give a shit back when Dota 1 is out and I play 16 games a day.

My theory is simply the whole 26 is too old to play esports logic is mostly to do with people that age having to look for real careers instead of having the luxury to focus on esports at this current state of the sport.   When does a person's mechanical skill actually start to fail them?  I think the jury's still out.

Games,3di89u,Hnefi,-2,Thu Jul 16 17:55:20 2015 UTC,"The pacing of SC2 is downright glacial compared to SFIV and the reaction requirements much lower, as well as the input execution barrier.    No, just, no, I know sf is extremely technical but you must not know anything about starcraft if you think that's true, starcraft has the highest key per minutes rate out of any competitive game, everything goes lighting fast and you need to think strategically on top of it. Street fighter is way more about the neutral, footsies and reads than it is about reaction times and fast inputs."
Games,3di89u,trias_e,14,Thu Jul 16 19:05:33 2015 UTC,"SC2 certainly has higher APM, but that doesn't translate to game speed and it has nothing to do with reaction speed. SC2 is a very demanding game, but it can't compare to a fighting game when it comes to reaction time requirements and precision input requirements. Like you say, SC2 has a larger strategic layer on top of it which SFIV lacks; part of that also ties into its lower reaction and execution requirements. SC2 requires more complex decisions, but not as fast ones. It's part of the basic design differences between tactical RTS's and fighting games."
Games,3di89u,Hnefi,-7,Thu Jul 16 17:59:27 2015 UTC,"Frankly, you have no idea what you're talking about.  SC2 at the highest level has immense reaction time requirements and they are at least on the same level as any fighting game, not to mention games lasting far longer (so you have to be at peak speed performance without a break for much longer).  It's no surprise that  older brood war progamers (MVP, Nestea) dominated SC2 at first with their experience, but over time the best-in-the-world scene has skewed entirely to young players with a fraction of the experience, but who are simply faster."
Games,3di89u,trias_e,8,Thu Jul 16 18:04:22 2015 UTC,"Just because you say it's so doesn't make it true. And your claim doesn't make any sense. Why would SC2 have the highest possible requirements for reaction time? The aim of that game is not to be a twitch reaction game. It's a tactics/strategy game with a lot of micro.  Look at it this way: if you are issuing a build order at your base while your army, en route to attacking somewhere, gets ambushed, it will take you at least 100 milliseconds - likely more - just to center the screen on that army. Does that mean you instantly lost that engagement? No, of course not, because reaction times, while important, are not that crucial to SC2. But in SFIV (or any fighting game, really), an added 100ms delay to your normal reaction times simply means you failed to react to an attack and have now lost that engagement, meaning you get hit by whatever combo the opponent had in store.  In SC2, you can still win an engagement with slowish reaction times. You don't need good reactions to micro and the game is designed to allow you to focus on various parts of the map; you don't gain an unsurmountable advantage in any engagement a particular army encounters if you constantly babysit that particular army. That would have been a stupid design for an RTS. Instead, the game allows you quite a lot of leniency so that you're not instantly screwed just because you happened to be giving build orders when your army was attacked. In practice, this is implemented by units moving and firing relatively slowly, units being able to act and respond while under attack, and units being resilient enough to live through a couple of enemy hits.  In fighting games, things are different. Most attacks are significantly faster than human reaction times, which means that it's not possible for pure reactions to win the game. But each frame of reduced reaction time gives more opportunities for punishes. This is especially important because getting hit once in a fighting game often means you lose a third of your lifebar. Getting hit once in SC2 is not even a notable event, your guys will get hit hundreds of times during a match.  Basically, fighting games are built in a way that focuses on reaction times:   The reaction ceiling in fighting games is far beyond human capabilities The punishment for failing to react is very harsh The reward for reacting in time can be very high There are no distractions and very little overall information flow, allowing players to always focus on reacting to the next attack   Conversely, in SC2:   Units move and attack slowly The punishment for reacting a few milliseconds slower than you might have is mild, since your army won't be incapacitated or wiped out within a few milliseconds from the start of the engagement The game has a lot of distractions going on with a high amount of information the player needs to handle across the map   SC2 does not require as strict reaction times (and input execution, but that's another topic) as games like SFIV. This doesn't make SC2 a lesser game. It just means that SC2 has more focus on other skills, such as planning, micro (APM), situational awareness and so on. Stop trying to pretend SC2 is the twitchiest game in the world, because it isn't and it isn't trying to be."
Games,3di89u,neohellpoet,0,Thu Jul 16 19:50:37 2015 UTC,"Part of this is perhaps the definition of 'reaction speed', because I would consider in-battle micro absolutely dependent on reaction speed.  Honestly though, I have no idea why you wouldn't.  ""Look at it this way: if you are issuing a build order at your base while your army, en route to attacking somewhere, gets ambushed, it will take you at least 100 milliseconds - likely more - just to center the screen on that army. Does that mean you instantly lost that engagement? No, of course not, because reaction times, while important, are not that crucial to SC2.""  Actually, yes.  If you're two of the best players in the world, and one person is faster to engage, that person is definitely favored to win.  It may not be an instant loss like in a fighting game, but in SC2 if one person is consistently slower, they are just going to get farther and farther behind.  SC2 doesn't 'require' strict reaction times, as in the game progresses and shit happens unlike counters in fighting games.  But at the top level, it absolutely does require blisteringly fast reaction speed to win.  Think of it this way:  When two players both have totally refined strategies, the differentiating mark is in execution, which boils down to tactics, speed and accuracy.  ""Conversely, in SC2: Units move and attack slowly The punishment for reacting a few milliseconds slower than you might have is mild, since your army won't be incapacitated or wiped out within a few milliseconds from the start of the engagement The game has a lot of distractions going on with a high amount of information the player needs to handle across the map""  I agree with the last part.  The second part is based on a misunderstanding, because you have to be constantly reacting during an engagement.  It's not just about how fast you look at your minimap and move your camera to the engagement.  The first part is irrelevant because you have to control so many units.  Controlling 30 'slow' marines well is insanely hard.  If you were talking about LoL or something, I could understand.  Here's an example and also a demonstration of the reaction speed ceiling in SC2, which is far beyond human capabilities (300 APM PER marine).  Computer reaction speed:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mrbYd4OFrWE  Some of the best human beings in the world: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBxHTfMhxIs  The most marines a human being can optimally control is 3-4.  Pretty bad in a game where in end game you'll have 100 of em."
Games,3di89u,Hnefi,-3,Thu Jul 16 20:19:50 2015 UTC,"I think you're confusing casual rts play with high level play. A casual player builds an army, sends it to the opponents base and points everything at a target hoping for the best.  High level play requires that every one of your units be handled  individually. The player needs 30 different units to do 30 different things, makings sure they're being optimized. Most games end with nether player making a mistake, rather one operated at 93% efficiency while the other was at 95%.  A fighting game has hundreds of possible game states (where are you in relation to your opponent, what can he do to you, what can you do to him) where as SC2 has tens of thousands. Fighting games present both players with complete information. You know as much about your opponents fighter as your opponent. SC2 hides information. Fighting games demand far fewer button inputs as even the most complex of combos are still tied to giving commands to a single fighter.  Imagine a fighting game where both you and your opponent controlled 3 fighters. Each was fighting a 1 on 1, all were displayed on one screen. You have to toggle between each one and while an animation is executing you switch to someone else and fight with them for a split second before going back to the first fighter or moving on to the third. That would be a fair approximation of a SC2 game."

Your description of my alleged understanding of SC2 is something you've invented yourself; I've certainly never claimed anything so inane as what you describe.  If you actually read what I'm writing, you'd see that you're just agreeing with me while trying to argue against me. I've already pointed out that fighting games have less information flow; that's part of what makes my central point, that reaction times are more important in fighting games than SC2, correct."
Games,3di89u,Giblaz,1 point,Thu Jul 16 22:09:22 2015 UTC,"But that's just it. They're not. If you're reacting in a high level fighting game you lost. The limited number of game states means you should never be reacting, rather, you anticipate what your opponent is going to do, prevent that or do something pro active. Your ability to read game states, make the correct decision and execute it are far more relevant than pure speed.  Basically, since there are so few possible outcomes and actions you can do in a fighting game, you need to be thinking 2 steps ahead, only ever acting, never reacting."
Games,3di89u,Hnefi,-5,Thu Jul 16 22:22:48 2015 UTC,"Basic design is an ambiguous non-term that doesn't mean anything in this context.  In SC2, minutia of your micro makes an incredible difference in how cost effective your units are. The player who can produce more actions across a greater area of the map will have a massive advantage.  Compare that to a fighting game where you have only one opponent to be concerned about, and you're not always engaging with. There is a lot of ""sparring"" in fighting games where the players are simply testing each other and not actually performing any actions. All of the Starcrafts will oftentimes have multiple engagements going on simultaneously, all of which require the players precise attention & micro to successfully execute within."
Games,3di89u,G_Morgan,6,Fri Jul 17 06:56:19 2015 UTC,"I expand on what I mean by what elements of design makes SC2 less reliant on reactions than fighting games in the post after the one you replied to. Try reading that.  And you say it yourself: fighting games have a lot less going on, which means players can always be focused on the action which they need to react to, thus raising the importance of reactions as opposed to other skills such as, for example, planning and microing. Issuing a lot of orders across a large map and keeping situational awareness across that space is a difficult skill and makes SC2 an interesting game, but it's a different skill than fast reactions, which is the entire point I've been making."
Games,3di89u,Doomspeaker,2,Thu Jul 16 20:50:49 2015 UTC,SC2 is grinding but doesn't require anything like the reaction speed of SF.
Games,3di89u,Gundato,3,Thu Jul 16 20:55:54 2015 UTC,"So the ""lower skill"" players could easily be 12 or 30.   Which instantly makes not having the age of people you gather data from (well, if they recorded random people it's impossible, but they gloss over this for the sake of pushing some weird superiority theory) a bit problematic to gather any good data, because it's supposed to be a game for the age of 15+."

So they drew conclusions based on the information they DID have available. Science. Well, as close as you can get with the social sciences as actual proofs aren't really feasible.  And having skimmed the article: It seems fairly decent. They are definitely pushing their agenda, but it falls within the realm of testing for a hypothesis as opposed to outright trying to prove a hypothesis.

Females are a great target since they're still somewhat rare in gaming and seem to care more about what random shitheads say (use mute button).  Although raging teen hormones might be part of the problem for these kids.  I agree that with age and experience the rage over bad teammates lessen,  you get used to playing with horrible people who doesn't seem to know what end of the gun to point at the enemy.  However,  I personally have never talked bad about a girl for being female,  I judge by skill and not sex.

Anyways, another user found the resubmission 16-18 hours ago, in the comments users pointed out it is a ""field test"".  That means they had a player in game using either male voice clips or female ones and collected the reactions.  As can be easily imagined, that kind of test is so easy to skew it is not even funny: different player pools, different amount of players interacted with, different content of the audio clips, different contexts (saying ""take that"" after you kill an enemy is different than saying it after you teamkill half of your team) and that is without even considering intentional manipulations."
Games,3di89u,ngwoo,0,Fri Jul 17 13:44:11 2015 UTC,"So if I'm understanding you correctly, you're saying the researchers could have intentionally or unintentionally manipulated the data in the original study (because keep in mind, this study was based on data collected for another study) by changing how the player played when there was a male voice vs a female voice being used.  Yes that is a possibility and there is no way for us to know one way or the other without seeing the raw data.    However, if they intentionally manipulated the data the researchers would be risking their reputation and their careers because that kind of academic dishonesty is not forgotten.  If it was unintentional or intentional the peer-reviewers do have access to the raw data and should be able to recognize any kind of manipulation or even potential for manipulation.  That is their job.  I would assume that the researchers designed their method in such a way to remove that kind of bias.  It would be quite easy.  Off the top of my head, you could either making all male and female voice comments during the games completely random, or use a standard list of events that would trigger a certain comments (for example, teammate makes a kill and the voice saying 'nice shot!' is played).  Through enough encounters with players, game context would be equally randomized and so you'd have a roughly even number of appropriately and inappropriately timed comments for male and female voices.  This info might be included in the original study but quite frankly I don't want to pay the 30.00 to access it.    Now as to the other concerns you brought up, player pools, number of players interacted with, and content of the audio clips, all that is documented in the study.  Players they played with were randomized through matchmaking.  82 games were played by female voiced player while 81 were played by male voiced player.  They only used teammate comments and of those, female voice received 82 comments while the male voice received 65.  All of the prerecorded audio clips used the same script for the female voice and make voice.  I'm not seeing a problem with any of this...  When evaluating the quality of a study you do need to keep a critical eye out for problems with the described methods or size of the study or dubious practices such as data mining, however, to assume without evidence that the researchers are manipulating results and that the peer-review process of a reputable organization is too incompetent / corrupt to identify that is a little bit much.  Bad studies do happen but they are usually published by bad publications or can usually be identified as flawed by reading through them and there is nothing obvious to me in this one that says it is just a bad study and should be dismissed."
Games,3di89u,arup02,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:22:22 2015 UTC,"To be accurate, ""manipulation"" is not the right term.  Even assuming the researchers were 100% honest, accurate, and unbiased on their own, they might have simply not imagined that some uncontrolled (and sometimes uncontrollable) variables could skew the results.  For example, they played roughly 80 games each, right? But how many players did they interact with in total? Match size can vary wildy from instance to instance, depending on the game.  For example, battlefield 4 has both 64 players matches and 16 players matches (also 48, 32, 24 and a few others), planetside 2 can go from hundreds to a couple depending on the area you are in, and MMORPGs are even worse.  That should be easy to account for tho.  A more subtle bias, how many of those players were taking part in the conversation? In most games I play only a very small fraction of the playerbase uses chat, and even less use audio chat.  Another possible problem, different servers can have very different communities: some are almost milsim levels of seriousness, others are very relaxed, some are basically 4chan central...  And context: making comments completely random would be silly, trying to tie them to in game events could be a better idea but the devil is in the details.  The reason I am very skeptical about this study is because not only it was removed from /R/science once, but TWICE (even the link I was PMed is now removed), and the time I got to read the comments they were along the lines of ""another uncontrolled field test. Mods ban plz"" and ""how many comments did they edit out?"", which is not exactly a nice sign (last time I saw shit like that was the cellphone and cancer link study)"

You are right. There are undoubtedly variables outside the control of researchers.  That is just the nature of this kind of study.  It makes that correlation-causation link more difficult to prove but their hypothesis seems sound, so again I see no reason yet to dismiss this study.

I'm not exactly sure what you mean here.  You do know that the only game they used in this study was Halo 3 right?  Specifically 4v4 team deathmatch.  They stated that they wanted to use a skill based game where there was a low population of female players (ie a male dominated environment).   and the time I got to read the comments they were along the lines of ""another uncontrolled field test. Mods ban plz""   If these were really the types of comments on the article then I'm sorry but /r/science is not the bastion of scientific wisdom that you think it is.  Comments like this are just profoundly ignorant and even violate the first rule of commenting in /r/science.  Yes it's a field study and yes field studies by their nature do not control for all variables in an experiment, however, they are still a valid research tool and are used quite often in social sciences.  If the submission wasn't deleted, I'd gladly call them out on their bullshit.  Laboratory studies and field studies each have their pros and cons but for studying something like sexism, a field study has clear advantages.  Although laboratory studies have better control over all variables to isolate the one you are testing, the setting for the experiment is contrived giving it a lack of external validity as well as introducing artifacts that impact the results of your experiment.  In this case, a laboratory study would certainly have introduced what's known as the social desirability bias.  Basically, if you recruit people to take part in an experiment, they are much less likely to engage in anti-social behavior (ie sexism) than they would in a natural setting.   The reason I am very skeptical about this study is because not only it was removed from /R/science once, but TWICE (even the link I was PMed is now removed)   As far as I can see, this article hasn't violated any of the submission rules for /r/science.  Do the moderators routinely delete articles that meet those rules without explanation?  If so then that's a problem in my view, especially if it leads people such as yourself to jump to conclusion about the articles they delete. They are supposed to be moderators, not curators of the subreddit.  Even if a deeply flawed article is submitted, it would be a better scientific and skeptical practice to explain what is wrong with the research then to delete it without explanation."
Games,3di89u,arup02,0,Mon Jul 20 08:05:38 2015 UTC,"The transcripts from the audio data they recorded was completed by an independent transcription company that was blind to the purpose of the study so there's not any opportunity to for the researchers to introduce bias at that point.  So all audible comments were therefore recorded as data points. Now the only opportunity to introduce bias would be in categorization of each comment as being either positive, neutral, or negative.  From the example data they show the positive comments were clearly positive, the neutral comments were usually just questions or comments that were neither encouraging or discouraging, and the negative comments were clearly negative.  Granted, they could have been selective with the sample data they showed and we'd have no way of knowing without looking at the raw data, but that's where you have to trust in the peer-review process to look at stuff like that. The researchers also pointed out that there were two users with 10 or more negative comments that they chose to exclude from their data because they would have skewered things too much (even though it fit with their hypothesis).  So it really seems to me that they were trying to do a good study. The only issue I can see is that it's a bit on the smallish side.  And one study doesn't prove that there is a link between sexism and player skill.  It would have to be repeated with larger studies and maybe controlled for other factors such as age, education level, etc.  But there isn't any reason to dismiss this study outright which was my original point."
Games,3di89u,phunkphorce,-4,Tue Jul 21 08:16:56 2015 UTC,"by an independent transcription company that was blind to the purpose of the study   I don't see how that fixes any of the unintentional bias sources I pointed out. It does not normalize for amount of players interacted with, it does not normalize for the content of the audio clips, it makes impossible to take game context into account.  Again, saying the same exact thing in different moments can get you very positive or very negative answers: saying ""well played"" after some impressive display of skill is not like saying ""well played"" after a teammate fucks up."

Games,3di89u,DeeDoubs,26,Thu Jul 16 23:05:16 2015 UTC,"Seems like a loaded study to me. All this is showing me is that females are generally a lot more positive, and it's not like people aren't going to be assholes regardless of gender.    We hypothesised that female-initiated disruption of a male hierarchy incites hostile behaviour from poor performing males who stand to lose the most status. To test this hypothesis, we used an online first-person shooter video game that removes signals of dominance but provides information on gender, individual performance, and skill.    People don't like to lose? Shocking. I can't tell you how many games I've won only to have the other presumably male player tell me to go fuck myself because he might be feeling inadequate. Would I experience this a lot more if I were female?"

I can't tell you how many games I've won only to have the other presumably male player tell me to go fuck myself because he might be feeling inadequate. Would I experience this a lot more if I were female?   The study does seem to show that low skill players are more likely to be assholes to females than males. Take a look at the tables included for a very clear few of this.
Games,3di89u,huntimir151,10,Thu Jul 16 14:19:42 2015 UTC,Would I experience this a lot more if I were female?   Absolutely.  A lot more.  You don't need a study to know that.
Games,3di89u,Doomspeaker,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:24:39 2015 UTC,"I think the distinction was in this:   While playing with male teammates, men generally follow rules associated with navigating hierarchies. Skill did not moderate focal player positivity towards a male-voiced teammate, but higher skilled individuals were less negative. In addition, when performing poorly, players increased the number of positive and neutral statements (Table 1), and were generally less negative towards a male-voiced teammate (Fig 3). As decreased cooperation or behaviours that lead to failure are often punished by teammates [35,36], the increase of positive and neutral statements and relatively less-frequent use of negative statements suggests poor-performing, lower-skilled males are demonstrating submissive behaviour towards a male-voiced teammate.  Males behaved in the opposite manner when playing with a female-voiced teammate. Overall, the female-voiced manipulation experienced a greater frequency of negative comments, but female-directed negativity decreased as focal-player performance improved (Fig 3). In addition, focal-player skill further moderated player behaviour with the lowest-skilled males behaving less positively towards a female voice. Focal players also increased the use of positive statements as their skill increased (Figs 1 & 2). Taken together, these results suggest that it is lower-skilled poorer-performing males that are significantly more hostile towards females, and higher-skilled focal players are more supportive."
Games,3di89u,Sixstring7,9,Thu Jul 16 14:23:13 2015 UTC,"Hm, that's not the conclusion I thought they were building up to in the first paragraph! When I read it, I thought it would be that since players are making fewer negative comments when performing poorly, that they are becoming less likely to say negative things the ""closer to home"" the comment gets. I was a little surprised they jumped straight toward ""submissive behavior"" in a hierarchy, although I'm sure they know better than I do. Really I can only draw on anecdote here.  It makes me think of plenty of games in which everyone is picking on everyone else, with the usual ha ha, you suck kind of thing, until the team actually begins to suck. At which point, the non-constructive comments vanish, and are replaced with either positive, encouraging things (the idea that happy, supportive players play better) or just focusing on communicating important facts (neutral things) about the game in order to turn it around. If they gain the upper hand again, then there's more wiggle room for faux trash-talk. In this case, we aren't collapsing into some kind of default hierarchy, we're filtering out noise for an advantage.  But maybe this has more to do with the sort of people I play with."
Games,3di89u,AgeMarkus,-22,Thu Jul 16 14:23:31 2015 UTC,"it's not like people aren't going to be assholes regardless of gender.   They removed outliers from the study, so they controlled for assholes."

But the biggest issue alot of people are ignoring is why the ""study"" organizer is so concerned with the girls being treated unfairly while blaming the ""low-status,low-skill and imasculated males"" That's the problem with feminism here,it's not about equality it's about dominance and control over others who are  deemed not useful. It's basically saying women should be free to put men in seperate boxes depending on their usefulness to themselves but men can't do the same to women or complain about it."

Games,3di89u,fb39ca4,11,Thu Jul 16 15:23:30 2015 UTC,"I think the point was that a subset of male gamers will, if they feel they aren't dominant, do something outside the competitive environment of the game to try to re-assert their dominance. And as it turned out, many of them feel more able to assert dominance over a female than a male.  Whether the cause and the correlation are the right way round is open for speculation. Perhaps aggressive players are low status because they drive others away an ddon't have the ability to improve their game or form social bonds. Or perhaps unskilled players are aggressive because in many areas of life, aggression makes up for skill or finesse."

Not a comparison because blacks in the 60s are universally agreed upon to not have been equal in retrospect, while the current position of woman in the western world is just interpreted as subjugated by feminists.   Feminists do push for both sides.   And that's why feminist found all these studies that show misbehavior of the other gender? Things like denying sexual dysmophism while simultaiously wanting lowered entry criteria for various jobs such as firemen for woman only?

Games,3dhjgo,Herlock,-1,Thu Jul 16 12:54:34 2015 UTC,"Also, Dirt Rally is PC only, a platform they are very familiar with. F1 2015 is their first game for the current gen consoles. I know the PC version seems to be the most broken, but that's possibly a side effect of spending most of their resources on the new platforms."
Games,3dhjgo,shadowofashadow,7,Thu Jul 16 12:10:46 2015 UTC,Well the current gen consoles are closer to PCs than you would think. Id guess it was just lack of QA time or resources in general.
Games,3dhjgo,Teyooo,3,Thu Jul 16 12:19:43 2015 UTC,Just because the console hardware is x86 doesn't necessarily make porting easier as evidenced by the large number of shit ports recently
Games,3dhjgo,dogdiarrhea,4,Thu Jul 16 12:24:58 2015 UTC,"Well it is easier for sure though. It is x86 that has been around for 20 years and it has a target to aim at. The QA just works so much easier since if it doesn't work on 1 it wont work on them all, while on PC it could work perfect on an AMD system for instance but not on Nvidia or Intel. So it is easier for sure to develop on consoles."
Games,3dhjgo,crow_bar,0,Thu Jul 16 12:27:51 2015 UTC,Consoles still use custom APIs that are targeted to their specific hardware and pretty different under the hood than PC APIs which have to account for many hardware configurations. The end result being x86 machine code doesn't have a lot of relevance to how much platform specific development time is required.
Games,3dhjgo,OneManFreakShow,2,Thu Jul 16 12:42:55 2015 UTC,"It's certainly way easier than with previous gen and their super specific API's AND hardware.

Games,3dhjgo,nothunder,3,Thu Jul 16 14:39:14 2015 UTC,After Dirt Showdown Codemaster took a survey of all of the Dirt fans and we overwhelmingly asked for a return to classic rally and more realism.  It's as if they realized Dirt was becoming something it shouldn't be  and decided to bring it back to its roots.  With F1 it's as if they've gone on autopilot like these other big companies do when they find themselves trying to make a new version every year.   The quality of the two products speak for which style of development is better.

Games,3dhjgo,bradamantium92,15,Thu Jul 16 11:51:08 2015 UTC,"It's weird. For me this is the best F1 game by Codemasters by far, even though there's more stuff wrong than there were in previous ones. However the core gameplay is ten times more fun than in earlier ones. The handling model has improved a lot but the biggest thing is AI. It's actually challenging now. You can actually battle with them. They won't just give up their position and when you are the one being slower ahead, they can actually overtake. You can do a defensive move or two and the AI wont just give up like they did before. Super fun.  In every other way the AI has gone backwards. AI sometimes pits on the last lap for no reason and lose positions. AI doesn't give a flying fuck if you are on your qualifying lap and they are going slow on an in or out lap, they won't let  you overtake. AI is terrible at overtaking slow cars, pretty much in every race one of the lead cars will take itself out trying to lap a slower car. None of these things were an issue in the previous games.  And it's not just the AI, the whole game has a lots of stuff missing or just not working properly. I have a feel these are caused by tight deadlines and just not having enough time. You can't see the weather for other sessions than the one going on already (you can't change the setup after the practice session, so good luck trying to guess if it's going to rain in quali or the race and preparing your setup accordingly). Although it's technically possible, you'll never get penalties for corner cutting, no matter how much you the game usually just doesn't care, and if it happens to care you just get a warning and nothing more. You can't create an open custom lobby in multiplayer, only your friends can join. You can't actually see how much fuel you got left. Pro Season mode has all the assists locked on atleast for some people. The after-qualifying cutscenes are all missing if you have chosen short qualifying. Resolution resets to a wrong setting everytime I alt-tab. The list is endless, I could seriously go on for pages on this stuff.  Career and some other game modes are missing. Now, I wasn't much of a fan of the other modes except career which was the only mode besides multiplayer I ever played. Before release Codemasters said that they are really focusing on the presentation of the new season mode, and promised that it would outweigh the loss of career mode. Well, in reality that means a few lines by two real F1 TV-personalities and a few new animations, which you'll see and hear in every race all over again. They are kind of cool the first time you see them or hear them, but after that it gets just annoying like you would've guessed. After like 3 race weekends there's no more to see or hear for the first time - except the short voice lines about each track - everything just repeats and repeats. So all in all the new career mode is just a bit cool but only for a really short while and certainly wasn't worth the time they have had to put to creating it.  Also to my eyes the graphics appear to be worse or at best equal quality compared to the previous F1 games. I don't really care, but the recommended GPU is GTX970. What the hell?  After all this, like I said, I still like this game a lot more than the earlier games. The core gameplay is fun and battling with the AI is amazing. Believe it or not, I don't regret spending my money on this one."

Games,3dfp50,justfornoatheism,710,Wed Jul 15 22:22:37 2015 UTC,"EDIT: I posted this before Lore elaborated on how the queue system works. kthx  For those unaware, currently the PvP scene is dominated by Alliance, the top few thousand players are 95% Alliance, and about 65% human. With Horde players being in the double digits.  This all started a few years ago when racial abilites got reworked, notably the humans gained 'Every Man for Himself', which breaks ANY form of Crowd Control (Stuns, roots, polymorph, etc). This meant that whilst every other race would have to use one of two trinket slots to do the same thing, humans were free to use BOTH trinket slots for damage orientated trinkets as the anti-CC and EMFH racial shared the same cooldown.  A lot of people claim that the racial alone won't win you games, which is true for casual play, where it becomes a case of skill or whoever spent more time gear grinding in extremely casual play. but the top plkayers, those that want every edge possible, were practically forced to go human. The fans of these players also went human to mimic them.  As more people went Alliance, Horde players gradually struggled to get decent partners for arena teams or battlegrounds, as all the players that wanted to be the very best had made humans. This led to -more- people re-rolling Alliance, not for the racial, but just to have decent players to play with. This point simply rinses and repeats, as more and more Horde moved sides just to be able to have competent partners.  Since Mists of Pandaria, the last expansion, this had begun reaching dangerous, game affecting levels, but in WoD it's straight up become critical mass. On one hand, the Horde gets instant queues into Battlegrounds and Arena, but their winrate has become 30% between the US and EU, and on Alliance, queue times go from 15 minutes to 40 for a BG, and over an hour for Ashran (The open PvP zone).  In the past, people have always whinged that X faction was dominating, but at best the ratio was 60-40 or thereabouts. not ideal but not unplayable. Now however, with a monstrous amount of faction imbalance across the globe, not just one region, both sides are having their enjoyment hampered.  Some more short-sighted idiots love to go all ""Whoo Alliance time to shine cuz Horde always dominated lelelel XD"". Now ignoring the fact the ratio never broke 60:40, it's worth noting that while there was mild imbalance leaning towards the Horde in the US, the EU has always been Alliance biased. So I myself have never had a moment where the Horde had the numerical upperhand. And even then, the 90% and over ratio is just absurd.  Onto this... ""fix"".  It's a band aid, nothing more, and it might not even fix anything. Until I know how it works, all I can assume is that Horde players will play as Alliance for the easy wins, and Alliance... probably won't budge, because they win the vast majority of matches (In my experience, 20 matches on either faction since the last patch, Alliance won 20/20, Horde won 1/20. Other players have reported similar cases. Basically Alliance have to wait much longer but are almost guaranteed a win. Horde player morale is also rock bottom, as soon as things go wrong, people just say 'gg' and AFK, or go 'Welcome to Horde' -then- AFK). I mean... why would the Alliance be Horde? Quick queue times followed by a rapid loss?  If anything, this fix will make Alliance queues -longer-, as everyone still playing Horde will just jump over for the easy wins, more than likely, and the OP human racial which Blizzard -refuses- to fix for some asinine reason. You can't even claim it's for the race change money, as everyone's a human now anyway. The only people not playing humans are PvE folk, diehard Horde fans and peoplep laying classes humans can't be. If humans could be druids, I'm sure they'd go from 60% to 90%, as an example. They claim that people still disagree on how potent the human racial is, which means it's balanced... but I've not seen one person say the racial isn't any good. Anyone who comments on it straight up says it's an incredibly good racial that blows the other races out of the water. The additional DPS trinket can add a massive chunk of damage, and with PvP being burst damage orientated, every bit of damage is crucial.  Personally I'd rather they gave every race a CC breaking racial like EMFH and give humans something else, something more interesting and preferably not as straight up required if you want to PvP seriously beyond casual play."
Games,3dfp50,Ranor,89,Thu Jul 16 00:16:36 2015 UTC,Good write-up on the history and what lead up to this change. Although I believe I read that you can only Mercenary when your faction has a queue.   EMFH needs to go. Whether it is balanced or not the perceived imbalance has affected the whole game just as you said. This is all the result of Blizzard neglecting PVP balance for so long.
Games,3dfp50,KajiKaji,16,Thu Jul 16 00:59:33 2015 UTC,"The only allusion to them paying attention to the racial is giving the anti-CC trinket a shot in the arm, granting them a massive stat bonus, but I seriously doubt that will compensate for the lack of a DPS trinket entirely. Additionally it was mentioned they don't want to overhaul classes and races mid-expansion, forcing people to re-learn how to play. Which sucks, but it implies they may pay racials attention again come the next expansion.  As someone horribly disappointed with WoD, I just want this expansion over. I can only hope their supposed 'doubled team' was sent to work on the next expansion instead..."
Games,3dfp50,Ranor,7,Thu Jul 16 01:30:50 2015 UTC,I can't say I was completely disappointed in the expansion. It had some great content but it was devoured and the repeatable content wasn't interesting enough to keep me playing. I hope they really learned what went wrong with this expansion and are able to fix it.
Games,3dfp50,KajiKaji,4,Thu Jul 16 01:49:16 2015 UTC,"Unless and until they bite the bullet and separate PvE and PvP, I have zero faith that the next expansion's ""fixes"" will be anything remotely close to actual fixes. The community seems overwhelmingly in favor of a complete division between PvP and PvE mechanics; they may disagree about everything else, but that's really one major sticking point where Blizzard just isn't listening to either reason or the mob vote.  Would that move alone solve all the class/spec problems? Of course not! But man would it make a huge difference. I can't even count the number of times a seemingly-PvE- or seemingly-PvP-motivated change to an ability totally fucked over the other crowd.  Then again, I've also lost count of the number of changes that have made no sense at all, period - and frankly, WoD has contained more than its fair share proportional to how long it's been out."
Games,3dfp50,frogandbanjo,2,Thu Jul 16 10:05:54 2015 UTC,"No, they should merge more PVP and PVE mechanics, not separate them further. It's the separation that leads to ridiculous changes that hurts one or both sides. They need to add more control mechanics and movement into raiding and make being a tank a viable option in PVP, however that may be. I want to see every spec of every class be useful for both activities, and I definitely think that can be done.  One of the main things I'm seeing is that every class has been given fairly homogenous abilities like dispels and CC. This seems like a change that was implemented for PVP balance, but it actually made PVP worse. They need to make the classes more unique so they all have their own roles in PVP and then their damage can be wherever it needs to be for PVE. For instance, Ferals shouldn't have cyclone, but they should keep their damage and stun.   And really, the balance shouldn't be changing so much every time an expansion comes out, they need to lock the specs into a role and leave them there. If they aren't meeting the needs of that role, buff them, and so forth."
Games,3dfp50,ThinKrisps,16,Thu Jul 16 17:31:47 2015 UTC,"EMFH needs to go.   I agree. I mean, just look at WotF after its nerf.

Games,3dfp50,TheExtremistModerate,4,Thu Jul 16 09:15:36 2015 UTC,"It doesn't. Blizzard just don't give a shit about PvP. They've clearly shown that for months. 6.2 balancing buffed two of the most overpowered PvP classes to do more damage (Frost DK, and Feral Druid) because they were weak in PvE. Instead of separating the balance, Blizzard just don't care.  People have warned them about faction balance for years and they have never listened. It's now bit them in the ass and they've released yet another band aid fix, because they never learn from their mistakes."

Games,3dfp50,ITellSadTruth,142,Thu Jul 16 09:51:24 2015 UTC,"It seems like an incredibly obvious and easy fix would be to just give ""Every Man for Himself"" to all races (but rename it to ""Every Troll / Orc / Dwarf for himself"" depending on the race,) and then hook humans up with another, hopefully less influential passive to maintain the balance of racials. Obviously you know this, but why doesn't Blizzard?"
Games,3dfp50,DRACULA_WOLFMAN,14,Thu Jul 16 01:10:13 2015 UTC,Honestly I think the whole idea of having a trinket/racial to remove crowd control is incredibly outdated and a side-effect of a fundamentally messed up system.  In MOBAs CC is much more sparse and comes with a lot of trade-offs.  This is because being crowd controlled is both frustrating and a detriment to the overall skill level in combat.  In DotA or League you get crowd controlled for being out of position/failing to dodge a choreographed ability but in WoW a lot of crowd control is instant and can be strung together.  I honestly think that all crowd control needs to be scrapped and redone from a blank slate - for both PvP and PvE.

Also, I'd like to see Blizzard offer all human characters a chance to change race (same faction) if they do change the racial but I'm pretty sure they won't."
Games,3dfp50,lacke,26,Thu Jul 16 02:26:00 2015 UTC,"I love that in Star Wars: The Old Republic everyone got a EMFH past a certain level. This adds the obvious skill element inside PvP, but also creates compelling gameplay in PvE. Some raids you are required to rotate to use the ability in order to make sure you have enough people that are able to perform a certain task.  I do not think that EMFH for everyone in WoW will be a fix for the faction imbalance that came from EMFH being human only - but instead of removing it or making it obsolete for humans, I would like to see it being added as a way to spice things up."
Games,3dfp50,Kanro,9,Thu Jul 16 03:40:42 2015 UTC,I'm not sure why it's not simply a trinket that requires x arena rating. I mean technically that's what it was in vanilla. Except no arena rating. It was a PvP trinket. Why did they ever think making a trinkets ability a racial was ever smart.
Games,3dfp50,VintageSin,6,Thu Jul 16 06:53:24 2015 UTC,"I actually think it's a good idea. The CC removal trinket is used by every character in pvp except humans. It's a non-choice.

Games,3dfp50,Benbulthuis,17,Thu Jul 16 05:13:45 2015 UTC,For the same reason people bitch about the human racial now - balance. It's hard to have unique and interesting aspects like that while also keeping everything fair. There are a lot of people calling on Blizzard to remove racials entirely just to make things more balanced.
Games,3dfp50,fakeyfakerson2,2,Thu Jul 16 07:49:21 2015 UTC,"But thats only because of the extremely poor balance.

Games,3dfp50,xPerplex,10,Thu Jul 16 05:32:21 2015 UTC,"Because no one will switch back to Horde especially if they spent time/money rolling Alliance. It's not as simple as rebalancing racials because they need to account for the fact that simply rebalancing racials will not fix the faction imbalances itself on its own. If I just rolled Alliance and all my friends rolled Alliance and all their friends rolled Alliance, why would we switch back into Horde?"
Games,3dfp50,Paz436,7,Thu Jul 16 06:44:28 2015 UTC,"They need to fix the racial so the incentive to roll alliance stops. If they don't, it will still cause massive issues."

Games,3dfp50,Shenkey,12,Thu Jul 16 07:30:52 2015 UTC,Because the faction population is already way too fucked.  Now there is a severe inbalance in skill between horde and alliance because everyone who is skilled in playing PVP switched to alliance. Competitive arena never had a problem with queuing because you could already queue against same faction there.  Even if they made the racials equal now there would still be this imbalance.
Games,3dfp50,Valnar,2,Thu Jul 16 04:34:54 2015 UTC,"Make racials equal and proceed with cross-faction PvP anyhow. In time, the queue-times will even out."

So you don't need to give every race anti CC as a racial, you can also give them a racial that can compete with the damage trinkets."
Games,3dfp50,Guanlong,10,Thu Jul 16 05:02:07 2015 UTC,"So you don't need to give every race anti CC as a racial, you can also give them a racial that can compete with the damage trinkets.   The racials don't scale with gear. So it is better to have more slots available for gear, since gear do in fact become better every season and every new encounter. If you have a racial that increases attack power by 300, it will still be 300 after a year. While a trinket that increases damage will be buffed every seasons, going from 300 to 600."

Games,3dfp50,monkeyjay,29,Thu Jul 16 09:36:01 2015 UTC,"I haven't played since the end of Cataclysm and I'm absolutely floored they haven't changed EMFH yet. I didn't PvP at much of a hardcore level(only ever got to 2k in 3s) so it wasn't a huge deal not having it, but I know the PvP people in my guild whined constantly about how dominant Humans were. I figured for sure by MoP they'd fix it.   I'm glad I don't play now. It was a nightmare to recruit for Horde guilds in Cata, I can't imagine how bad it is now if basically all the good to great PvPers are Alliance, along with the overall playerbase shrinking still."
Games,3dfp50,Dolgare,3,Thu Jul 16 02:28:50 2015 UTC,"Ya and before EMFH, humans had the OTHER most OP racial in the game, Perception. As a rogue it was a such a clearly obvious fucking advantage that every alliance team had with a human guaranteed to be part of literally every skirmish in BG's or arena. Perception was finally removed but it took like 4 expansions before they finally caved and realized it was a glaringly huge advantage for alliance over all horde stealthers."
Games,3dfp50,fupa16,7,Thu Jul 16 07:07:57 2015 UTC,"Onto this... ""fix"". It's a band aid, nothing more   They said exactly this. The mercenary system isn't meant to be the solution.    and it might not even fix anything. Until I know how it works, all I can assume is that Horde players will play as Alliance for the easy wins, and Alliance... probably won't budge, because they win the vast majority of matches   It doesn't work like that. Whichever faction currently has queue times will the the faction that is allowed to mercenary. Which means (supposing trends continue as they are) it will be in the direction of Alliance -> Horde.  The blue post: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300613290?page=2#28   Only the faction that is currently experiencing a long queue will have the option to act as a Mercenary, and only when those queues reach a certain point (which is still being determined). In the current environment, we expect that to generally be Alliance. Since queues have to reach that threshold before Mercenary Mode becomes available, we don't anticipate an increase in Horde queue times."
Games,3dfp50,unentitled_gamer,7,Thu Jul 16 15:19:49 2015 UTC,"That blue post came out after my post here, just FYI."
Games,3dfp50,Ranor,11,Thu Jul 16 18:46:51 2015 UTC,"The reason they want to keep racials as they are is because they 'want each race to maintain some individualism and choice beyond just a cosmetic change' which is all well and good but has no place in competitive play, especially when some are so much more powerful than others so that choosing the wrong race is even a thing.  In my opinion, racials should be either cosmetic/homogenized or simply disabled in rated pvp and the highest level (mythic) raiding to prevent this asinine faction and racial bias in the long term."
Games,3dfp50,Zapph,13,Thu Jul 16 01:14:47 2015 UTC,"I don't mind racials, I do mind them when some are blatantly more powerful than others. GW2 made racial skills rather subpar to actual class skills, which, while not ideal, is better than making a particular race overly desirable."
Games,3dfp50,Ranor,14,Thu Jul 16 01:33:00 2015 UTC,This is also the worst* possible solution. It actively rewards those who transferred over and started this land slide to begin with. Now there is absolutely zero reasons to PVP competitively as a horde. There is nothing but upsides for PVP as alliance now. Alliance get to have their cake and eat it. typo
Games,3dfp50,Eficent,12,Thu Jul 16 01:10:47 2015 UTC,"I'd rather all CC-breaking trinkets and EMFH be removed from the game.  It just becomes a requirement and nuisance in PvP combat.  Reduces player choice.  If CC is overpowered, fix it by fixing CC.  Don't fix it by adding a countermeasure, especially one that is not equally-available.  But I haven't played that game in close to 5 years, so whatever."
Games,3dfp50,admiralteal,13,Thu Jul 16 04:21:42 2015 UTC,That sounds absolutely terrible.   Did the other races get anything close to EMFH? Is WotF still how it used to be? Only some CC?
Games,3dfp50,AirPhforce,35,Thu Jul 16 00:38:51 2015 UTC,"Nope. Forsaken used to have a decent racial, as did dwarves, but they got nerfed for being too powerful... riiiight. Most racials even remotely similar only break specific types of CC, some racials are just horrible for PvP. Take tauren's war stomp. it's an AoE stun. Which -sounds great. But it has a castt ime, that when taking damage can have it's cast time extended up to 1.5 seconds, which is bad. But it can also be interrupted, and requires you to STAND STILL. And it stuns for a tiny amount of time, AND it influences diminishing returns of other stuns (In that the stun time of other stunning abilities gets shorter when cast one after another) which can just stun for much longer, at range, and instant cast."
Games,3dfp50,Ranor,6,Thu Jul 16 00:46:36 2015 UTC,"Are dwarves really that bad? If I'm not mistaken, their racial should remove most kind of cc. Unless it shares cd with the PvP trinket I don't see why everyone wouldn't switch to dwarf if they nerf/remove EMFH.  Stoneform (dwarf racial) in-game tooltip says:  Instant, 2 min cooldown   Removes all poison, disease, curse, magic, and bleed effects and reduces all physical damage taken by 10% for 8 sec."
Games,3dfp50,lacke,11,Thu Jul 16 02:31:12 2015 UTC,"IIRC from when I played at the start of WoD, it doesn't share a cd with the pvp trinket but you also cannot use it while hard CC'd. so while polymorph or hammer of justice are magic effects, you can't use stoneform to remove them. It's still a very good racial though, almost certainly the best defensive one."
Games,3dfp50,pimpguin,3,Thu Jul 16 02:46:40 2015 UTC,Thanks for the info. I was a little bit confused why no one is discussing the dwarf racial because it seemed imbalanced as well.
Games,3dfp50,lacke,11,Thu Jul 16 02:55:01 2015 UTC,"It's much more imba in pve. That shit is a free cleanse against bosses with an ""oh shit"" button damage reduction baked in."
Games,3dfp50,Kaghuros,2,Thu Jul 16 03:44:36 2015 UTC,I'm still upset about Treasure Finding racial being removed! Also Stoneform only being reduction vs physical damage now.
Games,3dfp50,Limond,6,Thu Jul 16 03:46:50 2015 UTC,"Forsaken used to have a decent racial   20 seconds of CC immunity was a little stronger than decent, same with 5 seconds. The instant break of some CC was overpowered until EMFH was introduced at which point WotF did not need to be nerfed and probably should have been buffed... but it was nerfed."
Games,3dfp50,geeca,5,Thu Jul 16 04:17:19 2015 UTC,"20 seconds made a lot more sense in an open world PvP context, which is all that really existed in the early days. If you see them pop WotF, just run away or draw out the fight for 20 seconds, which was very doable before every single class was given ranged stuns and roots.   Blizzard's main issue with balance has always been trying to take skills and balance them across open world PvP, battlegrounds, arena, and PvE when all of those lead to very different combat scenarios."
Games,3dfp50,textbooksforrent,9,Thu Jul 16 13:36:27 2015 UTC,"Up until fairly recently, i forget if it was this expansion or the last, the horde was still competitive because their racials were better for burst.  This caused the horde to be noticeably better for PvE content for a long time. It took about four expansions, but they eventually equalized that. They are balanced for raids, but you can still see the social remnants of the old imbalance- something like 90% of the world's top raiding guilds are horde.  Unfortunately, this meant that the alliance was now crazy overpowered for pvp. They've avoided getting rid of every man for himself because theoretically it can be balanced. Additionally, they've nerfed an iconic spell like that before- will of the forsaken- and the response was awful. To this day it is still listed as one of the default options in the 'why I am unsubscribing' survey form.  It's kind of funny, because humans didn't have this ability until wrath, because the alliance needed a little body to compete with undead in pvp.  Lastly, even if they do fix the racials, just like how raiding guilds still gravitate to the horde even though the factions are balanced, the good pvp players will be staying on the alliance for a long, long time.  It really is amazing how much I can rant about this game."
Games,3dfp50,RudeHero,4,Thu Jul 16 04:12:53 2015 UTC,"They've always had issues balancing the factions. In the early days Alliance was way better for PvE because Paladin auras absolutely outclassed Shaman totems in every way, and Dwarf Priest's fear ward made so many raid bosses a cake walk. Then they just let both Horde and Alliance be both classes, and removed the Priest-racial abilities. But then the actual racial abilities got out of hand. They gave WotF a much needed nerf but then go and create the human version.   Their balance decisions are so perplexing at times. It's always 1 step forward, 2 steps back kind of thing."
Games,3dfp50,textbooksforrent,2,Thu Jul 16 13:38:45 2015 UTC,"WotF is similar to EMFH. It's now a 3 min CD, shares a CD with other trinkets, and does not make you immune for X seconds anymore. However, it only removes Fear, Charm, and Sleep. Whereas EMFH removes everything."
Games,3dfp50,TheExtremistModerate,7,Thu Jul 16 09:17:33 2015 UTC,Wow..reading that make me feel like it's 2009. EMFH has been imbalanced for AGES I can't believe it's still an issue.
Games,3dfp50,DeeJayDelicious,3,Thu Jul 16 05:55:30 2015 UTC,"If you read the post, the option to fight for the other faction will only be available when queue times are long, presumably due to an imbalance of queueing.  Considering there are always more Alliance queueing than Horde, I doubt the option will be available to Horde very often. It's not like it's ""hey just play whatever faction you feel like whenever."""
Games,3dfp50,TreeFiddy1031,4,Thu Jul 16 12:02:47 2015 UTC,"Alliance players say the same thing though. The only BG we ever seemed to win was AV and IoC. Everyone is convinced that the odds are stacked against them.  Most of the top PvP realms are entirely dominated by horde. At least in the EU realms.  In fact, nearly all the high population realms are swung one way or the other. We're talking 15,000 of one side, and maybe 100 of the other. The overall imbalance is high enough to just warrant picking a side in the queue. I'm just surprised it's taken them this long to realise it."
Games,3dfp50,blackmist,5,Thu Jul 16 08:03:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah, It's the snowball effect. When a server reaches a population tipping point where one side starts to outnumber the other. Eventually you have those players dry up. Either because they are sick of being ganked, or because a server becomes known as being pro-one side and hence if you want to play horde you roll on a horde dominant server.  Cross realm stuff in a way aim's to offset that issue, as were the battlegroups."

Games,3dfp50,lazylearner,2,Thu Jul 16 12:34:16 2015 UTC,"and the OP human racial which Blizzard -refuses- to fix for some asinine reason.   Because Blizzard will NEVER admit that they were wrong.  This is present in ALL of their games dating back to WotLK and probably before that.  Remember Colossus Smash?  I was part of the Cata beta and I mained Warrior at the time.  Pretty much ALL of us were putting tons of posts in on the beta forums, telling Blizzard ""dude you are balancing our damage output around 6 second windows, this is going to break PvP.""  These are like fucking essays high-profile players - players that were directly invited to the beta, not part of the random grab-all mass email invites - are writing, complete with screenshots, videos, etc, showing how much damage a Warrior can produce in those windows, and how hard it is to do anything about it.  Blizzard doesn't care.  It goes live, and soon after we get to watch Arms Warriors globaling full-on tanks inside of a Throwdown.  Colossus Smash gets PvP-nerfed in the next major patch.  Were you in the SC2 beta?  There were so many broken things in that beta I can't remember which ones were the biggest, but I think Reapers were a big one.  Again, players pointing out that these units are problematic for gameplay balance and need to be addressed, providing detailed posts supported with videos, replays, screenshots, etc.  Blizzard ignores it, game goes live, cue up all of the tournaments dominated by relatively low-skilled players beating relatively high-skilled players with Reaper cheese builds because it's just about unstoppable when played moderately well.  You shouldn't take Blizzard games seriously as competitive games anymore.  It's very clear that over the past several years, they've shifted from a company that's focused on making good games, to a company that's focused on making good money.  Now, that doesn't mean their products are bad.  Argue about how ""skilled"" or ""unskilled"" the gameplay is all you'd like, Blizzard still consistently produces very high-quality products.  But as far as playing them competitively?  You're wasting your time.  Blizzard doesn't care."

I don't think its just that simple, not only mechanically but things like class individuality and cohesiveness.

It may be difficult at first, but once the game is clearly segregated into two categories, they can stop fucking over one to fix the other.

Games,3dfp50,KevinLee487,2,Thu Jul 16 05:02:22 2015 UTC,They already do it with some spells so the technology is clearly there. The only reason they don't do it is because they think it makes the game 'too complex'.
Games,3dfp50,Stiryx,2,Thu Jul 16 13:54:42 2015 UTC,"Which is silly, since, for the most part, pvp and pve already use entirely different builds/skills/talents/playstyles/gear.

Games,3dfp50,CutterJohn,8,Thu Jul 16 15:23:29 2015 UTC,They started this - but than slowed / stopped. Some abilities already do less damage in PvP than PvE - should of been like that for everything that needed balancing.

Most of the differences come down to religion and who started the Rift's and historically the races have worked together in the past/lived together.  I like the PvP being mixed in Rift but they removed racials and made them more fun/movement based not combat based like WoW they pretty much planned for mixed PvP. Blizzard needs to make their mind up on how they handle PvP at least this is something?"

Spoilers on:  I have no clue what the fuck is happening with the story. One minute Garrosh is in prison. Then not. Then removed from plot in a pretty weird way that makes his involvement almost unneeded. While his not-dad Grom is all about some invading and avoiding demon influence, which is what made them originally invade anyway. But Guldan gets his demon influence. BTW Archimonde wasn't dead. Grom 'frees' the orcs again, and everyone's cool with him in like 5 seconds. Oh and Khadgar is back, looks 30 years younger, has med'hivs staff and seemingly is level of power. All the while in a past version of Draenor that is explicitly not the one we went to.  Far as I can tell, this whole expansion was an excuse to introduce the old horde for the sake of the movies. Which will just confuse the WoW only players more, if they've never played the old games to get their story in the original way.  So many questions. But not ones that are interesting. Just ones that don't make sense."
Games,3dfp50,TequilaWhiskey,2,Thu Jul 16 16:28:05 2015 UTC,"Well, that certainly DOES sound like a clusterfuck. I played a bit of WoD, but I never really cared about story after Cataclysm to be honest."
Games,3dfp50,creepymatt,57,Thu Jul 16 20:20:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's the angle they seem to pursue for PvE story-telling (since they obviously don't want to make 2 different versions of every raid).  But even in PvP I've felt players care less and less about factions. At this point any separation is arbitrary.  Edit: Not nearly as controversial but just as important was the introduction of dual specs and easy build-switching. Suddenly you no longer played a build, but only a class. All classes were expected to fill every roll available to them. Your preferred spec became irrelevant."
Games,3dfp50,DeeJayDelicious,42,Wed Jul 15 23:44:04 2015 UTC,"I feel a lot of this stems from launch and pre-battlegrounds. Ganks, counter ganks, getting a band of 30 people together cause those fucking horde keep ganking us from warsong. There was a lot of animosity between the factions on PvP servers because we kept killing each other. Battlegrounds severely reduced that effect and it was mostly just people remembering how it used to be.  Considering battlegrounds are like... 9 years old, I can't imagine many of the original playerbase is still around to keep that old rivalry going."

I joined this guild during Pandaria with the promise of raiding, as a Holydin. I never DPS in raids. Like, ever. So I joined up with them, and it went great. We cleared the first tier of content together and all seemed good.  At least for awhile. I noticed after about a month that I wasn't getting raid invites on my calendar, and I asked the girl that invited me if there was an issue, as I'd caught them talking about planning a raid. Up until then, I'd merely thought they were on hiatus or something.  Well as it turned out, their old healer came back to the game and they simply gave her my spot without even telling me.

Games,3dfp50,AvalonBright,20,Thu Jul 16 01:11:32 2015 UTC,"What?  The ""alliance"" at ICC was held together with shoestrings and gum.  The Argent Crusade held a tournament over who'd be allowed to go in the first place, since they refused to work together amiably.  And the other faction breaks that agreement, leading to the gunship fight at the end of the first wing.  In the Alliance version of the instance, Saurfang is only barely allowed the leeway to collect his son's body, at the behest of the king himself.  The tournament itself nearly came to blows in the stands when the Crusade's idiot warlock lost control of Jaraxxus."

Games,3dfp50,sleeplessone,3,Thu Jul 16 03:20:08 2015 UTC,"I don't accept that argument. Some of these changes were major quality of life fixes like Minipets, Mounts and Tabards.  I remember back in Classic having multiple Mini-pets was a pain because it denied you so much inventory space. I enjoyed embracing the ability to collect mounts and pets around the time of LK.  I would be hard pressed to believe that change reduced interaction.

Games,3dfp50,Daffan,4,Thu Jul 16 03:50:47 2015 UTC,"For a long time in Classic/BC I would have a forum presence. Often the idea of 'Paid leveling' came up and my response would be that leveling was the social and mechanical training wheels that taught players how to play. Back in the earlier days, if someone hit level cap, they definitely played a good amount and were at least decently competent (barring paid power leveling)  A big part of the difficulty problems are due to gear scaling as well. When you start making multiple bands of difficulty, you're decreasing your player population. Combine that with the more geared get into the lower ones, they can allow players to skip or ease past the earliest, lowest difficulties.  I think they fragmented the difficulty curves a bit too much, meaning that the weaker ones fail to serve as gear checks and learning opportunities, resulting in less skilled players.  You can only make your game so forgiving before you're doing a disservice to your players ability to learn your game mechanics."

If you're not in a dedicated pvp guild with people vested in not just giving up then you would find people just hiding in parts of the map just to get the time to pass. I remember like 6-7 years ago people were already calling for a 3rd, independent faction to emerge to help balance it out but its tricky to implement in the world theyve built. Its far better if they just ignore factions for pvp, randomize what team you join and just play for the objectives with whatever mix of players you have. This way if the better alliance players get teamed up with even average horde players, at least theres a chance for a decent match at that point instead of the typical steamroll."

Blizzard has created a situation where the severe majority of people want to ""set it and forget it"" for organization. I picked a month of WoW back in 2012 after stopping in 2006 to see what was going on and most people played looking for raid which was insanely easy. People queue for pvp, for instances, you just press a button and get into the action.  People don't want to spend 2 hours organizing a world pvp event and raiding a city, for a long time cities were cross-faction anyway which eliminated the sense of raiding a capital city, you were raiding some empty place with no one inside. People get mad now when pvp impacts them in a tangible way in pve, such as the controlled pvp areas in Burning Crusade.  It's lame but pvp now, even on the pvp servers, is just a contained element."

That'll move some people. Some of those moved will drag friends or entire guilds along, adding more people. For the last bit of people, maybe those who switched from Horde to Alliance initially get a free exclusive pet or something for switching back provided they switch to Alliance within some timeframe. The pet will be exclusive at first, then everyone complains, then they'll sell the pet after telling everyone they won't do that. Sounds scumbag, but that's a free pet for switching if you're a longtime subscriber who left Horde because the PvP was just sucking too much and hated switching."

Games,3dfp50,basketofseals,29,Thu Jul 16 02:46:55 2015 UTC,"The idiot ball has been bouncing for a long time now. From a lore perspective it has continuously made less and less sense that they are at war.  In vanilla we can take it for granted that it made sense. It's where the story ""began"" and the world felt huge enough that the strange other faction was scary and enemies were encountered in the open world -- something which has never happened again. Raid bosses are mostly theoretical threats who we stomp after wandering into their lair.  In Burning Crusade we'd been fighting over the same battlegrounds for a while, and went through the Dark Portal together. This was a hostile new world with different factions to align ourselves with, so it's only natural that the war continues. Again, raid bosses are just kind of hanging out in their lairs when we get around to killing them; they're not huge looming threats that force us to work together. Nonetheless, we share Shattrath.  In WotLK, the Lich King has clearly presented himself as a global threat and starts out untouchable; in fact, all future bosses are presented this way, as an omnipotent uberthreat. We HAVE to work together to stop him. Dalaran becomes the base of operations and everyone is working closely. Actual alliances form between the Horde and Alliance. At the same time, a dumbshit warmonger has been installed as king of the Alliance who does his best to rip it apart.  In Cataclysm, Deathwing is clearly and directly threatening everyone. He blows Stormwind the fuck up. Despite this, we find an excuse to be dicks to each other and Blizzard even admits that they intentionally separated the factions again to avoid seeming chummy. A dumbshit warmonger has been installed as warchief of the Horde to butt heads equally so that Garrosh and Varian can argue about nonsense. The open world has become an abstract concept; the world is there to explore, but it is largely empty with little reason to go anywhere other than the specific locations reserved for high levels. There's no feeling whatsoever of a territorial conflict.  In Mists of Pandaria, we are introduced to a neutral race which transcends factions and bludgeoned over the head with the message that peace is the way and we are stupid for fighting. Nevertheless, the Pandaren are forced to choose sides at puberty and never look back. Battlegrounds and Arena have by now become entirely separate from the world and dungeons/raids have had to take measures just to get you to leave the capital. The capital which is in the same zone with symmetric but separate faction shrines because the peace message isn't getting through. The expansion culminates in the siege of the Horde capitol and the unseating of their power-mad Warchief by an alliance of both factions, which for some reason go back to killing each other.  In Warlords of Draenor, I've honestly lost track. At this point we've time traveled to fight the alternate-reality past Horde buddies of the guy we killed in the previous expansion. Why the fuck are we fighting each other again, let alone over the same ditch in Warsong we started slapping our dicks about at 10 years ago? Why did we decide to fight over a supposedly resource rich area on an island in the middle of nowhere? The entire expansion is a really cool excuse to revisit some old characters (and content) but is desperately unoriginal in doing so.  Lore has to stop being an excuse for faction separation. More and more it's what makes the least sense for the story."

Not to mention the numerous joint ventures saving the world in WoW.  Clearly the Horde are evil.  I still don't quite know why the NE joined the Alliance.  Probably game balance.

If you need 10 million to make the game you want why did you only ask for 2 million? I heard that sony plans on providing more money after the kickstarter, but if that is true why the fuck did they even do a kickstarter? ""to gage public interest in the game"", they said. Why didn't they just announce it and gage that reaction. Also, can we all agree that the footage that we have see so far is very sloppy.

It is looking like they'll raise 5 million when it closes.  So 5 million is about 500 person-months. For two years that is 20 employees. That is a decent sized studio if we assume they do a lot of outsourcing and abuse temp employees.  But wait, checking the KS, we have 11 big names (in addition to peons), which is gonna increase costs: Those folk aren't working for shitty salaries.  So yeah, without Sony helping, I personally see no way this would have ever been remotely done. It is just way too big for crowdfunding.  But instead, we have a mysterious backer... Sony. So the devs have shown they can make 5 million in revenue just on hype alone. So Sony can comparatively safely throw in the rest.  And it isn't so much that the consumers are paying for 5 million bucks of development. It is more like the publisher (Sony) is giving the devs a 5 million advance and just pretending they made that 5 million during the first week of sales... in two years."

Shenmue 3, OTOH, has additional investors.  This arrangement basically means that anyone who helps kickstart Shenmue 3 is technically a 2nd class citizen compared to these other investors. They can make decisions. The backers cannot.  They can profit from sales. The backers cannot.

Now, I get why they dont make these games, like Psychonauts, even though people want them. Games are expensive and are very risky. Psychonauts was very abstract and didn't sell well. Mirror's Edge was abstract and didn't sell that well.  But, if Sony is comfortable enough to say they will spend money on it, why dont they just spend money on it? If we know one thing about publishers, they aren't smart.

Consoles don't have upgradable components because it's more profitable to make people buy a new one every 5-6 years. HD remakes are a hit or miss. Sometimes they are called lazy. And why would Bethesda or anyone want to remake something while they are still hugely popular and want to make new stuff that people are going to eat up like candy anyway? FF7 and Shenmue are pretty old games that are pretty hard to convince a company to spend millions of dollars on. Yes they have their fans.

Anyways, Remakes can sometimes be a hit-or-miss venture for a publisher. HD remake of the first Fable? Was a big risk and didn't pay off. Remaster of Conkers Bad Fur Day? Fairly risky, but somewhat paid off. The announced remake of FF7? Printing money. Sure about 85% of kids below the age of like 20 or so probably have no idea what FF7 is. But, a census recorded a few years ago said that most gamers are between 18-30~, and I bet most of those people remember FF7 very clearly. Remember about a year ago, at GamesCom I think, they announced the FF7 port to PS4 and for a few minutes people thought it was a remaster? Everyone in the fucking room lost their shit and once everyone figured out it wasnt anything new they lost their shits again. And when the actual remake was announced people lost their shits for a third time. That game is going to sell like fucking mad. Many people assume that the people who buy the most games are kid, but that is very far from the truth. Most people buying games are over the age of 18 and remember Shenume, FF7 and Morrowind. The S3 kickstarter was very poorly handled and is basically Sony dropping their dicks on the table and saying ""were making this shit, but how about you give us a suck before we start to thank us for being such merciful gods"". My biggest gripe was the whole ""I need 10 million to fully realise my idea for the game"". We all knew it was never, ever, ever going to get 10 million. Sony knew it. Yu Suzuki knew it.

I am fully aware of how stupid that is. But that's just how the market is with remakes.   As far as the 18-30 market goes, I'd be interested to know how much of that is mobile and how much is actually sitting through a 30-40 hour game.

While I agree with everything else, the Kickstarter seems, like in previous cases, to be a gauge for actual interest. A gauge of prospective value.  Shenmue is a long dead IP. It was produced/published by Sega, a practically dead publisher, almost exclusively on a platform/console that has been dead for like 15 years or so (yeah, I know it had a port or parallel release on another console). Kickstarter/similar funding methods seem like a decent tool (sometimes) for a larger publisher/producer to apply some risk mitigation. I think that is the main reason for the Kickstarter- that and it was probably a requirement for Suzuki to prove to Sony that this should happen.   Also, can we all agree that the footage that we have see so far is very sloppy.   Yeah, I agree, but it seems obvious that there probably is not any significant development behind the game yet. It looks like they're just throwing some cutting room floor stuff out there to appease an eager audience. I think there's a lot of potential, but I think it will require a lot of funding, particularly from Sony, to realize it. Otherwise, we might just get a janky sequel to what was previously thought a dead IP. It may, or may not do the previous games justice.  In any case though, I don't even really care that much- it's just amazing to me, to see something that I was convinced was permanently dead, just pop up out of the blue like that. Even if the final product is meh, I'll just be happy seeing Ryo again."

I haven't backed it.  I hope it's good but I'm not convinced, why can't Suzuki put together something more impressive than this?  It seems like they had the idea no sooner than yesterday's lunch hour and just through something together, and got me thinking maybe there are good reasons the third game never dropped.

Sometimes the developer just doesn't want to make an other game, or dont have any ideas for it. Sometimes there is a good reason for a game to be a standalone story. Would it be fun to explore the world of Brutal Legend, Psychonauts or Shadow of Colossus? Hell yeah! But, would it be fund in the people making it weren't fully invested? No, it would feel like a forced husk of a game. The reason Shenmue was able to be so amazing for its time was the budget. I believe it cost around 40 million, completely unheard of at the time. Now, games like the Witcher 3: Wild Hunt can be made on 15 million and games on the scale, relatively speaking, of shenmue like GTA V coast nearly 130 million. For this game to reach the expectation of that most people have it would take over 200 million"
Games,3didw2,ThatPelican,-5,Fri Jul 17 03:42:15 2015 UTC,"Sony knew they could get gullible fans to bank roll the game due to it's pre-established fanbase itching for a new game. They didn't do the kickstarter because they needed to, they did it because it was free money lying on the table and no one was going to stop them from getting it. You're getting a large portion of the costs associated with developing your game from people who aren't even investing, they get no share of the profit whatsoever. And yes, knowing you have some of your production cost comped by the consumers further justifies making the game, because making a sequel to such an old series and not a reboot is a pretty risky move."

Set your goal as what it takes to make a minimum ""complete"" game, and work from there. Shenmue 3 really didn't do that, which means that they are going to get the cash to not even make the project they planned to make.  Honestly, this reminds me a lot of Destiny. It is a game by devs people love (admittedly, Bugnie had a better track record) doing a game they should have no problems making, but they are ignoring what everyone else has done and are making countless ""rookie mistakes"". Bungie ignored Borderlands/Diablo/Guild Wars, and the Shenmue devs ignored every other KS."
Games,3didw2,Gundato,2,Thu Jul 16 15:14:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I agree with you. I've wanted Shenmue 3 for years. I imported Shenmue 2 on the Dreamcast just so I could play it (this was before it was announced on Xbox). I thought for sure the second it showed up on KS that I would put any spare money I could into it. And yet I ended up not pledging at all, even after the physical PS4 copy showed up. Maybe I'm just adverse to putting money down on something I'm not even sure will release, but I don't feel like the KS did anything to really assuage my fears. And even if Sony is only doing the marketing, there's nothing stipulating that that won't change during production.  I'll fully support the game when it releases and I'm very excited for it. I just couldn't get behind the KS at all. Kudos to those who did, though."
Games,3didw2,you_me_fivedollars,11,Thu Jul 16 19:42:57 2015 UTC,"I felt like the entire thing was shady as hell. They announced a kickstarter at E3 for starters and said nothing about it being a tool to gauge interest or that Sony would be funding it, which, by the way, is an incredibly scummy thing for a multi-billion dollar company to do. There are plenty of valid methods to gauge interest, don't give me this lazy excuse to get free funding. They simply announced it and then rode the hype train.  To make it worse, they didn't even bother to properly plan the thing. The footage they showed was 100% trash that was thrown together in a week tops. Not to mention those pathetic stretch goals of needing hundreds of thousands of dollars for subtitles in multiple languages, literally the most pathetic stretch goals I have ever seen.  The cherry on the cake? Now the creator says he actually needed 10 million that he didn't ask for. So where does that leave us? Are we getting a shoddy sequel because they didn't raise enough money? Is Sony funding whatever else is needed since people were very obviously interested? Nobody knows, and it's infuriating."
Games,3didw2,Kryslor,5,Thu Jul 16 22:52:53 2015 UTC,"Isn't this subreddit always preaching ""vote with your wallet""  This is EXACTLY what a Kickstarter like this is.   Who gives a shit if the game is partially funded by Sony, the game is a huge financial risk, no company in their right mind would fund it without a guarantee of a roi.  I guess we could boycott kickstarters like this, and let the game industry know we have no interest in games that break the mould.   I for one was happy to pledge $60 on Shenmue If paying for it early means it gets made at all. Unless the game ended up being the next Superman 64, there is a very good change I would be buying it regardless."
Games,3didw2,micredable,1 point,Fri Jul 17 01:06:56 2015 UTC,"This is what I was thinking. We talk about how companies don't take as many risks and how they tend to build on sequels more often and take the safe route all the time. Sony find a way to release a risky project whilst reducing the risk factor and everyone just bitches because it's Sony being a big company. You have to realise, from Sony's point of view, Shenmue isn't a massively popular series. It has a cult audience. The series literally has a history of not managing to break even. Why on Earth should Sony, a business, fund that all themselves just to please a small group of people, many of whom will still just get it on PC instead of buying a PS4 anyway.  Personally I'm not a fan of Shenmue but if I could 'kickstart' so as to speak projects from big companies that were near impossible to make successfully otherwise then I would happily do that."

I based my statement on the fact that there are plenty of other games that have done what Shenmue did better in the last decade or so.   If the 3rd Shenmue game fails to be made, it won't because people were afraid to try something new or different; Shenmue isn't any of those things now. Shenmue would fail to be made because of lack of funding from a major backer/large publisher. I believe the fans have done their job, it's time for Yu Sazuki to get some major funding.

There hasn't really been a game like Shenmue since Shenmue 2. People who point to games like GTA are partially right, but those open world games still don't convey the sense of a living breathing city that Shenmue was able too.   GTA has a vast populated world, but the NPCs that inhabit it are for the most part randomly generated, and unless a mission dictates it, they don't really have daily schedules, character traits, or unique dialog.   So in that sense it is different. It is also a much slower paced game than the majority of games today.  It is also hard to say that Shenmue 3 won't be innovative, we know almost nothing about it right now."

What I meant was there are a many different games out there that have similar aspects to Shenmue but focused on those individuals gameplay elements and built a full game around it. I suppose the difference with Shenmue is that it combines many different gameplay elements but many games have combined separate elements before."

For me as a Shenmue fan, i'm glad that we are getting Shenmue 3 but I wish they were more transparent by getting a proper English PR spokesperson for it.   All that's left for me is what Sega would do with Shenmue 1 & 2. I hope to God that they will release the HD remasters that they have shelved for 3 years now."
Games,3didw2,NorrisOBE,3,Thu Jul 16 22:36:05 2015 UTC,"I predict Shenmue III sales will not be great and that Sony is not putting as much money into this as people think.  A lot of games get kickstarted thanks to a small audience, then word of mouth gets them additional sales if it works out.   But Shenmue III was announced at E3.  Almost anyone who would be interested in a sequel to Shenmue II has probably heard about it.  Now, some fans are going to sit back and see how it turns out, but the market is just not that large.  I think Sony is smart enough to figure that out.  The multiplier for Shenmue III will be much smaller than say FTL or even Hero Generations.  So most people interested in paying for a full price (or even $30) copy will get one through KS.  Maybe it sells an additional 50,000-100,000 units but that's not going to warrant much investment from Sony.  (Edit: of course, if reviews are great enough that it breaks into 'mainstream', then all bets are off.  But I don't see that happening, even though I backed it at $29.)"

Then there is the utter disdain for historical accuracy brought about by the Viking Forefathers DLC. The entire DLC culture surrounding Attila is disgusting; pre-order DLC followed by a paid DLC just weeks after release, and finally another DLC adding factions to the British Isles that should have been there from the start. We also got the customary Blood DLC which they allegedly can't include in the game for rating reasons. I can't be the only one who thinks 2,49€ is pretty expensive for a feature that wasn't included to get a lower rating.   Creative Assembly, or their SEGA overlords, have been determined to screw over their customers for years now. Transparency regarding trailers doesn't change the fact that they want to swindle you out of your money by making you pay for your game in pieces."

Games,3dpvqt,Gnome_Chimpsky,3,Sat Jul 18 11:43:07 2015 UTC,"The problem with the Viking Forefathers is that they're basically just vikings, but they're about 400 years too early. In Sweden the period before the vikings is the Vendel Era, lasting from about 550 to 793 (when the Viking Age formally begins with the sacking of Lindisfarne off the English coast).   Based on archeological evidence in Sweden, primarily from two places called Vendel (giving name to the era) and Valsgärde, we have a vague idea of what their armour might have looked like, for example this helmet from Vendel and this one from Valsgärde. The problem here is that Total War: Attila starts another 150 years before the Vendel Era even began. The inclusion of vikings is nothing but pandering to people who don't know any better and think vikings are so cool. It's a marked step away from history, and while CA never have been 100% accurate (Egypt in RTW comes to mind) it's still disconcerting."
Games,3dpvqt,LionoftheNorth,2,Sat Jul 18 12:55:33 2015 UTC,Tack för infon ;) They should just have made the whole expansion about that era (550 to 800 or something) and focused on northern Europe. Would have been a nice lead up to Medieval 3.
Games,3dpvqt,Gnome_Chimpsky,2,Sat Jul 18 13:20:02 2015 UTC,"At the risk of going off-topic, the craze for all things ""Viking"" goes beyond video games and movies. In academia, it is hard to publish books on anything even tangentially related to medieval Scandinavia without the publisher trying to shoehorn ""Vikings"" into the title somewhere, even if the content of the book deals very little with norse raiders. It really has become a marketing buzzword, and it is deployed frequently to lure in fans of that subject matter.    Anyway, I think a lot of people think poorly of developers and film directors for their use of historically misplaced vikings, but knowing what I know from the behind-the-scenes of academia, I wouldn't be surprised if publishers/producers have a hand in forcing that stuff into the games/films. Making mistakes about correct armours, etc. is maybe a separate issue, but adding in historically irrelevant vikings just for the hell of it? That's not unique to Creative Assembly by a longshot."

Rome 2 was not only very buggy, but it dumbed down the gameplay compared to previous games in the series and most importantly compared to the original Rome. They added back some of those features later on, especially with their Imperial Edition one year after release, but yeah it took a while (and lots of people just used mods) to make it feel more fleshed out. They kind of just tried a bunch of things that just really didn't work well or made the game feel restrictive.   You are also right with how it isn't the only super buggy game on release. Every single one of their recent Total War games have been incredibly problematic and buggy on release. We had Empire, Shogun 2 and Rome 2 (with Rome 2 and Empire being by far the worst releases). All three of those had expansions, Napolean, Fall of the Samurai and Atilla, that are often considered significantly better in terms of stability and just generally very well done, but that is because they are using the same engine and have often had at least a 1 year of post-release work with the engine, and concepts, already.

CA destroyed their own brand image by releasing a shitty and bugged Empire Total War with a ton of DLC that should have been included in the base game and only fixed those issues in Napoleon Total War, Shotgun 2 also had many issues and some infamous dlc (like you have to pay to toggle blood and violence ON), Rome 2 was probably the worst one they released and I haven't played Attila so I can't comment on it but it doesn't seem revolutionary.  Yeah, people don't look forward to the next TW but let's not pretend we don't have any reason to be cautious or even skeptical about the quality of their future releases since their recent releases have been such a rollercoaster of mediocre-good-amazing-terrible-mediocre games, they dug their own grave."

You can't get burned by a bad game if you wait until it's released to decide you will buy it. In cases where game reviews are not embargoed you can even decide not to buy it before release.   For the record, I've loved Creative Assembly since Total War: Medieval. Empire and Rome 2 are the only ones that could be considered bad games, and both have been improved considerably since launch.

I'm not cynical and jaded when a car company produces a luxury car that is ludicrously expensive for what it is, because if the value requested was the same as the value I deemed it to be I'd happily purchase it. That's how the free market works. I don't sit there unhappy that I've bought something that wasn't worth the money.  I wouldnt expect you to complain if you bought a book missing half its pages, because that is on you. If they make bad products, stop buying those products, then they will stop making bad products and you will stop resenting them for giving you bad products.

You're right just in the general sense, though. This sub is overwhelmingly negative and tends to brandish the pitchforks first and ask questions later.  I made a similar thread a couple of weeks ago that was surprisingly well received when it came to votes, but whose sentiments were mostly refuted by commenters. It complained a lot about the propensity for upvoting drama this sub has, which might explain that disparity. I also received some charming PMs calling me a faggot among other things, which really only validated the way I feel about this place.   Either way, it was the response to that thread and the fact that nothing has even slightly changed since that convinced me that this sub is a lost cause for anyone who hopes for improvement in those areas.

Not only do I hate ads, but I hate the Free2Play ""Buy Coins/advantage"" model even more. I just want to buy the game, and own it. Not have ads thrown in my face, or what's basically ads to buy advantages.  Because I like Angry Birds, I think it was up until Star Wars I bought them all without even thinking. ""Yeah, fun mobile game for a couple bucks. I'll get my money out of that."" Then about the time of Star Wars II, they did away with the paid apps... I think they even kind of reverted older Angry Birds into ""free2play."""

And they are constantly updating the game with new plants and new worlds, the daily challenges are fun and pretty easy.  Out of the 72 plants in the game I think 12 are real money only, which means you have about 60 plants to use for free and to keep it interesting.  There's no limited continues, no limited ""retries"", no impossible levels (there's one frustrating world though - the beach one), the ads are not intrusive (they happen during load between levels and can be immediately dismissed - no timer).  And there's entire features (for free) that I never even used that would make the game easier, like the Zen Garden.  To be honest, in this case I'm not even sure if I would prefer a single pay game, because I got to enjoy it all for free."

From what I've heard from mobile app developers, there's far more money in only offering an ad-supported app, then offering the choice to purchase or run ad-supported. Especially with an App like Angry Birds, where you can constantly rely on people opening the app more then >5 times. Hence why it was done.  This doesn't apply to indie developers, but those guys aren't making money either way from the app store, so it's not really worth pointing out."

Games,3di1ch,adanine,3,Thu Jul 16 16:45:19 2015 UTC,"But that's because people are willing to suffer through an ad-supported app in order to save the $1 to $4.

Angry Birds is old news, more or less, and there's no denying that.  It's definitely in a slump compared to its heyday.   But the brand hasn't really dissipated as much as adults would like to believe. Angry Birds has its original game, a kart racer, a 'bubble pop' style game, and variations based on Star Wars and Transformers. Many of these have toys you can purchase and scan into the game. There's also been Looney Toon style cartoons which are actually kinda fun.  And more is on the way."

I know I got quite a few pretty nifty items; and you can always sell excess loot to buy upgrades.  In my opinion, their F2P model was at least decent, if not commendable. I stopped playing though, but not because of the business model.  Might actually take a look again, it was noticeable how much work and love for the genres went into the game.  Also, I found PVP in this game to be tough, but quite rewarding. AND you got good rewards for playing PVP, iirc.  tl;dr: Played it 1 or 2 years ago, found the F2P model fair, definite recommendation to try out. PVP multiplayer."

It has some nice art, it's just the game around it feels... shady."
Games,3dga17,LightPhoenix,20,Thu Jul 16 02:37:28 2015 UTC,"The reason it feels like this is because Card Hunter, ultimately, is not a tactics-style strategy game.  Card Hunter is a deck building game, and that's where the strategy is.  Sometimes you hit a brick wall, and you have to grind for cards because you don't have an answer.  Sometimes it seems like the only thing to do is be reactive, because you don't have the cards you need in hand (or at all)."
Games,3dga17,BI_Joe,5,Thu Jul 16 03:35:09 2015 UTC,"When do you start hitting a brick wall? I played up to level 6 or so and it's seemed pretty balanced so far (I haven't failed an adventure yet and the only lost battles I had were due to avoidable tactical mistakes).  Then again, I did use the free pizza given early in the game to buy into the club program instead of getting a new figure, so that might affect the difficulty curve (though honestly the club rewards haven't helped at all yet)."
Games,3dga17,LightPhoenix,5,Thu Jul 16 05:09:09 2015 UTC,"I didn't find the club rewards overly useful either.  I generally don't think it's worth it unless you have pizza/money to spare.  Where you hit walls is going to be somewhat based on RNG and on your experience.  For me, it happened around levels 7 and 15ish.  The former was mostly tactical, the latter was when I realized the game's strategy is in deck building.  The game badly needs more comprehensive deck management tools, and the idea of changing my load-out every battle discouraged me from playing.  The early levels were much more difficult in beta and IIRC early release.  Shieldhaven Prison in particular I remember being brutal.  They went through extensive balancing to make those earlier levels a little easier.  I would love to see those harder levels return in a challenge mode though."

The enemies wont come to you so you basically have to run at them which resulted in us being gibbed 3 times in a row.

The ability to play and share the experience with friends is always a plus in any game IMO. The game has a very nice Dungeons and Dragons aesthetic and looks very polished overall.  I haven't delved too deeply into the game, and it's possible that some grinding will be required as I progress further... But I think some grinding is acceptable for a loot-based game like this. Card Hunter definitely has one of the better F2P models around, and I really recommend you try it out, even better if you do it with a couple of friends in co-op."

You can check the amount of current players by visiting the community hub on Steam. The performance is quite good now, certainly not like it was back during the Alpha and Beta. Patches have primarily been for balancing the monsters and hunters that were considered over-powered or under-powered. Most players are now max level but that doesn't really mean much. I have over one hundred hours on the game and personally I'd say give it a miss. Not enough content to warrant the sale price still and the low player count makes getting into a match take longer than I'd like."

Games,3dmce2,lv426a,2,Fri Jul 17 14:53:01 2015 UTC,"The only problem with the business model was that they A) charged $60 for it instead of $40, or B) they didn't include a single player campaign to make it feel like you're getting more value out of a primarily multiplayer-only game.  People took a quote out of context before release saying that they ""built the game from the ground up for DLC"" to mean that it was a way to squeeze money out of people rather than the truth, which is that they designed it to not segment their user base.  It's a very good game, but you really can't get away with charging for a multiplayer-only game anymore.  Look at any of the arena shooters that have come out on Steam over the past few years, optimistically assuming that if the game is good, people will pay for it.  That's just not how it works anymore.  Free to play multiplayer games ensure that people who are not paying for the game are adding value to the game for people who are paying just by way of having more people to play with."

But even if they didn't have any paid DLC and just released everything post-launch for free, the game still cost $60 and didn't have a single player mode to pad out the value of the box.  That was really the big misstep, even though that game definitely has $60 of value; their job is to communicate that $60 of value, and they failed to do that."

When I load a twitch stream and see an ad for Red Lobster I just laugh and wonder how ineffective those ads are.  The difference between the NBA finals viewership of 26 million and the esports viewership of 32 million is most of the 26 million are interested in the majority of other programming ESPN advertises. They're more likely to watch SportsCenter after the game and the 30 For 30 film or even the Soccer/Tennis match they're advertising during the NBA Finals. When ESPN2 shows League, a few million people might watch on TV instead of twitch, but the advertising is as ineffective as a Red Lobster ad to a European viewer.   So yes, ESPN does show things like Poker and the Spelling Bee. But those are things their regular viewers like to watch. Its not like they're trying to capture the Spelling Bee enthusiast market.

I feel like a nontrivial percent of the ""eSports community"" is constantly pining for some sort acceptance. Like they're all just projecting childhood insecurities. Personally that's what really gets on my nerves. No I don't think video games are the same as physical sports. Yes I think they can be competitive. Yes I think they can be spectator activities (anything can as long as you have spectators). No I don't think they need to share the same stage as normal physical sports.  It just makes no sense for ESPN to start showing CS or Dota or whatnot. It's not the same audience. Like just imagine the reverse, you're watching your favorite SC2 stream and then they just start showing a game of football. I bet Twitch chat would explode in rage. If the only similarity is that they're ""competitive"", well, that's just not enough! How is that enough of a similarity that people are practically crusading for eSports.

With Dota 2, I know a lot about the game, so me and my friends can have informed discussions and actually get excited about certain ""plays"" and what not.  It's a nice way to socialize and relax.

Games,3dn1qc,HappierShibe,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:29:46 2015 UTC,"Yes I completely agree.  Honestly, I think it happens anytime a new something in gaming gets big. Just like all the 3D platformer clones in the 90s and or all the WoW clones in the late 00's. Everyone scrambles to be part of the big upward trend and cash in and lose sight of what made that movement popular in the first place.  I think Dota is a great case study for a successful eSports game. The game basically made itself out of nothing. Because it was a community driven mod, it didn't answer to investors or directors or a company, hell, Icefrog (the current developer) doesn't even answer to his audience. None of the game mechanics or design was made for it to ""be esports"". It was just to make the game fun and interesting. It became an ""eSport"" on its own just because people liked playing it so much. Enough that people were competing against each other and other people were watching. It grew itself into an eSports. Nobody made it into one.  Now of course, once Valve got to remake it, they added all sorts of UI functionality which helped it become even bigger than before, but they didn't compromise any of the core mechanics. All the balancing and design is still left to Icefrog who still is as stoic as ever, silently changing his game.  BUT, now in the real world people are designing games to become eSports. They're not just designing games to be fun (R.I.P. Mr. Iwata). It's hugely disappointing for me and I find myself laughing and disgusted every time a new game is demoed with an ""announcer"" trying to play by play call the game to create an ""esports feel"". Ugh.... It just feels so.... cheap."

Maybe it's because I enjoy more of the sniper role and Mordecai just had a good feel.  I'm on the side that personally felt like the weapons in BL1 were better as well.  There were some very powerful combinations that fit my play-style in BL1 and I just couldn't find any builds in BL2 that made me go: ""This is for me."""
Games,3ddeam,ChefExcellence,218,Wed Jul 15 13:37:04 2015 UTC,"I hated the weapons in BL2. I very rarely found a gun that felt great, it was always just good enough. The manufacturer specific traits they added weren't a great idea either, I feel like it ended up reducing variety rather than the other way around. Too often I'd find a sniper with great stats but it was useless because it was stuck on burst fire."
Games,3ddeam,Xet,19,Wed Jul 15 14:13:28 2015 UTC,Too often I'd find a sniper with great stats but it was useless because it was stuck on burst fire.    Oh god bane of my existence in that fucking game. It felt like the high damage decent snipers were more likely to be burst fire than single fire.
Games,3ddeam,Volcanicrage,17,Wed Jul 15 14:55:27 2015 UTC,"Its because most of the sniper rifle manufacturers are rather weak.  Hyperion, Maliwan, and Vladof rifles are all on the anemic end of the BL2 weapon spectrum, so only Jacobs is reliably making stronger guns (meaning about 60% of sniper rifles will tend to be weaker, and only 20% will be stronger).  edit: wording"
Games,3ddeam,we_are_sex_bobomb,99,Wed Jul 15 18:58:52 2015 UTC,"That's my problem with the Borderlands games as well... there are hundreds of guns but most of them are super dysfunctional. You always have to choose between a pea-shooter that shoots in a straight line, or a gun that shoots in crazy zigzags or super slow bullets or some crap, that does decent damage. That's a choice between garbage and crap.  ...But now I kind of want to play again..."
Games,3ddeam,S3nnex,39,Wed Jul 15 20:36:39 2015 UTC,Anything from Atlas in BL1 was pretty much amazing. Everything from BL2 felt like a sad gimmick.
Games,3ddeam,GooeyGungan,32,Wed Jul 15 15:49:28 2015 UTC,"That's because Atlas was supposed to be the highest-end manufacturer in BL1. In the lore, they're far and away the best guns. Gearbox decided to have them not appear in BL2, for whatever reason. I guess having a manufacturer whose trait is being ""the best"" is boring.  Edit: I remember now that they left for lore reasons. They were pretty soundly defeated in ""The Secret Armory of General Knoxx""."
Games,3ddeam,PaperCutsYourEyes,9,Wed Jul 15 18:45:21 2015 UTC,Anyone else get that gun where the bullet sound effects were replaced by incredibly obnoxious high pitched screaming?

Games,3ddeam,Kellervo,39,Wed Jul 15 21:58:40 2015 UTC,"The idea of manufacturer specific traits was neat, but poorly implemented. It basically meant that there were only two viable manufacturers for each weapon category because they dealt the most damage.   Bandit, Dahl, Hyperion, Maliwan, Tediore, Vladof guns were useless 95% of the time because their manufacturer perks couldn't beat straight up damage increases."

Games,3ddeam,Cogwork,15,Wed Jul 15 19:24:54 2015 UTC,Manufacturer specific traits were in BL1. They were just handled much better. Nothing felt truly gimmicky  (looking at you exploding reloads).  Also the guns felt truly random. BL2 guns were just reskins with slightly different stats. I was really disappointed.
Games,3ddeam,TwilightVulpine,9,Wed Jul 15 19:03:03 2015 UTC,"I felt the exact opposite. BL1 manufacturers didn't really feel different in a meaningful way. They had slightly different numbers in a game where you are already getting random numbers for each gun you get, I couldn't tell them apart from each other."
Games,3ddeam,Cogwork,9,Wed Jul 15 19:03:39 2015 UTC,"I think it was more subtle, but it was enough for me.  Jakobs was super accurate, to the point of sniper shotguns, which by the way were amazing, plus that sweet ass wood furniture.  But I can see where you're coming from BL2 were very specific mechanic wise, but like someone else said, it rendered all but 2 guns useless for each manufacturer.  My opinion, they can't please everyone after all."
Games,3ddeam,PrionBacon,26,Thu Jul 16 00:34:18 2015 UTC,"In the pre-sequel, Aurelia (one of the DLC player characters) is very similar to Mordecai with a skill tree focused on sniper rifles and an activated ability that launches a homing frost tiara.  However, the flow of the pre-sequel is quite different from BL2 so it definitely feels different. Maybe wait until the base game and the season pass gets on sale before committing to it."

Games,3ddeam,Seraphtheol,12,Wed Jul 15 14:32:44 2015 UTC,"For me it was the last 1/5th of the game that completely killed it for me. I absolutely loved BL1 and 2 (with hundreds of hours invested in each game), and until the last part of the Presequel I was enjoying the game; not as much as 1 and 2, but it was still good.  Then in the last 1/5 of the game though it felt like they threw absolutely everything out the window; plot, enemy design, level design, humor, etc. Now I'd never recommend the game to anyone and I don't plan on playing it again."

Games,3ddeam,Jaegunn,38,Wed Jul 15 21:38:46 2015 UTC,The pre-sequel was made by an entirely different studio (2k Australia). so unless that studio is also doing BL3 it shouldn't resemble the pre-sequel too much.

Games,3ddeam,scientifiction,15,Wed Jul 15 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"The biggest issue I had with the Pre-sequel (and why I still have not bought it) is that it was more or less a reskin of BL2, but still had the new game pricetag as if it was a completely different game.  The only way I'd be convinced to buy BL3 (if they do make it), is if it took as big of a step as BL2 did from BL1.  Until then, BL2 is still a perfectly good game that I can keep going back to."
Games,3ddeam,Jaegunn,9,Wed Jul 15 14:24:43 2015 UTC,BL3 is not going to be a reskin. they have already said they have to do significant work to even get their BL systems working on the new consoles. so if anything BL3 will be the biggest leap graphically and mechanically.

And if you're just genuinely trying to create a piece of entertainment, yes you will sometimes fail and yes people will sometimes dislike what you made. This is true in any form of entertainment and you need to be able to ignore this to some degree and keep on working, otherwise it will distract you too much from what you're trying to do.  However, this does not work if the majority of people tell you that what you did is bad and that the way you did it was deceiving. If you intentionally showed ""gameplay"" trailers that were completely unrealistic. If you told people to their faces how invested your whole team was in this game and its story and then turn around to blame all problems on a different developer. If you do all of that and then try to wriggle your way out of responsibility and not once apologize to the fans, then you sound like a complete ass when saying things like   ""I read it in this way: we moved those people, we touched them – even the person who hates [your game] so much, you’ve affected them. That’s why we fight, we’re creating emotion and experience - and some people thrive on that type of feeling, some people are sadists.""   After performing a magic trick based on the Three Card Monte street scam, the industry veteran told attendees that, while many spectators would quietly appreciate any entertainment act, a small percentage would be critical and would seek to validate that by attempting to convert others.    Why did he choose exactly this trick? I understand the point he's trying to make, but this specific trick is traditionally used to deceive people. Sure, you can also just do it as a fun magic trick, but it is still being used to this day on the street to fool people out of their money. It's a scam, not an entertainment act.  So his point is people should just stand by idly, appreciating a scam?   I'd love to see the actual video because I would like to know what the hell he was thinking."

Look, Dragon Age 2 was a bit of a mess but people still bought DA3 - and the developers said they learned from it. Borderlands 1 was buggy on PC, they improved and Borderlands 2 became a hit. People love that Gearbox brought us the remastered version of Homeworld.  There are many, many examples of people being more than willing to forget past mistakes if developers fix them and step up their game, especially if they do a mea culpa.  Backtracking and admitting you were wrong might hurt your pride but seriously? Whether as a person or as a company, man up, swallow your pride, learn from your mistakes and vow to do better!"
Games,3ddeam,EnigmaticChemist,61,Wed Jul 15 12:33:58 2015 UTC,"Borderlands 1 was buggy on PC, they improved and Borderlands 2 became a hit.   BL2 was awesome on release, and then it felt like Gearbox forgot what made 1 so fun. The drop rates were the worst offense of all, as in 1 i found new guns to use all the time. Blue weapons were sometimes better than legends, it was fun to find and toy with guns.   And then they sucked the fun out of BL2, IMO, with nerfing and changing mechanics (Bee + Shotguns was fun), the abysmal drop rates making grinding become the same raid bosses over and over again with low chances of getting loot (Member Crawmerax on 1. That was a damn lootsplosion), and then they messed with the loot raid system again removing vendor items and moving them to the loot pool, and one of the worst DLC nickel and dime model i had seen in a while.   Season pass, was 1/2 the non-cosmetic DLC basically. To this day I still think they had to do it to make up for the losses they took on A:CM.   Honestly i spent more time in BL2 cheesing for legendary and up gear. I spent BL1 killing with friends for fun and finding amazing gear wherever we went."
Games,3ddeam,grendus,19,Wed Jul 15 13:17:08 2015 UTC,"I feel like that was the biggest improvement in the Pre Sequel. The Grinder made even trash loot fun again. In BL2 I usually ran around with maxed out money. In TPS I was scraping the bottom of the barrel because I tossed all my guns into the Grinder for a chance at good loot (which, given that I has less trouble finding decent guns in TPS, was a good strategy)."
Games,3ddeam,EnigmaticChemist,17,Wed Jul 15 13:44:44 2015 UTC,"TPS is something i have avoided. $60 Moon DLC for BL2 is how i have seen it described when it was released, and a lot of friends i played 1 and 2 with grabbed it, played a little, and went back to other shooters quickly.   They complained about the stupid gravity issues with lootsplosions, the damn running back to get air mechanic, the missions basically making you walk the same areas back and forth again (apparently a whole host of fetch missions like 2 as well).   The grinder adds some aspect of fixing the broken loot system, which is neat, but the game seems as if it was pushed to market really quickly for a cash grab. IIRC it was not even released on next-gen consoles at release, because they wanted to continuing use the BL2 engine and not updating it to be used with the new consoles.   TL;DR: TPS just was not happening for me after the way 2 was handled. It felt like a cash grab quick game that should have been a pricey DLC for 2 and not a $60 game."
Games,3ddeam,Tulos,17,Wed Jul 15 14:21:28 2015 UTC,"TPS is, on the whole, a worse game than BL2. The quests are largely fetch quests, that are intentionally drawn out to artificially extend gameplay time.  Even playing it with a set group of 3 others didn't make it worth it - we all had enough and quit only 5 or so hours into the game."
Games,3ddeam,rubelmj,15,Wed Jul 15 14:30:16 2015 UTC,"This is also purely subjective, but I think the story and humor were much worse in TPS as well. Jack's rise to evil, which was the centerpiece, wasn't compelling in any way. Because of the amount of fetch quests you don't have the same quality of NPCs, Nurse Nina just wasn't as entertaining as Dr. Zed, they awkwardly shoehorned in the sexuality of characters you met for 45 seconds to make sure you know how diverse and progressive the game is... I could go on but you get it."
Games,3ddeam,grendus,4,Wed Jul 15 14:40:03 2015 UTC,"Honestly, having played it I'd say it's the weakest of the series but all three are neck and neck. The grinder fixed the loot issues from the second game, and the air mechanic wasn't really an issue - it was mainly there to discouraged constantly boosting and slamming around the battlefield (which I did anyways, because blitzkrieging for air canister drops is a viable tactic dammit).  It was a full release. Some studios do smaller games (Wolfenstein: The Old Blood, for example), but TPS was about as large as BL2 in scale and had some great levels, great characters, a pretty good story, and the laser guns were a blast to play with. I have no regrets about the $60 I spent on it, it was worth every penny."

One great example is how he kept telling a story of how he won the name Gearbox in an 'epic' poker game with Gabe Newell on a riverboat casino. Pitchford claims that he and Newell were discussing ideas for company names before and / or during the game, and when they ended up being the last two players, they decided to play for the rights to the name 'Gearbox'. Pitchford beat Newell in an amazing showdown.  Legendary story, right? Yeah, except Newell and everyone else Pitchford claims was there says nothing like that ever happened. The game itself didn't happen, there was no discussion about game company names, etc.  I like Borderlands somewhat, but even there, Pitchford pulled some sleazy crap. Gearbox ripped off the artist that created 'Code Hunters' when they redid the first game's whole aesthetic rather late in development (after contacting that artists and telling him they wanted to work with him, but then refusing to return his calls and emails)."

Games,3ddeam,mmencius,13,Wed Jul 15 18:06:05 2015 UTC,"Oh come on Randy, this is ridiculous. So you guys made a really bad game. You misled people with false advertising. You quite possibly screwed over Sega by misappropriating their funds.  If you make a bad game under shady circumstances, you deserve some criticism. Clearly you don't deserve death threats against your family or anything nuts like that, but you're trying to get sympathy points over very justifiable criticism."
Games,3ddeam,bigfloppydoodles,16,Wed Jul 15 18:17:42 2015 UTC,"All this stuff about Randy being mentioned again makes me want to say a few things that generally get forgotten about him and Gearbox.  Some of the best ones are the time he licensed a Duke Nukem 3D remake to a bunch of fans in Denmark who got to the stage that they were preparing to release a multiplayer beta when Randy turned around and said that their contract said they could work on it but never said anything about releasing it and then two years down the road when they were preparing to release their first commercial project which they had been working on for free (they had absolutely no funding, a good example of this is the marketing guy sold his house to fund events for the game) Randy came back out and said that they could release it and that he had never said they couldn't (another lie from Captain Dickface) which of course would be impossible for a company that is just about to release its first commercial project because it isn't exactly viable to pay people to work on a game that was going to be released for free right when you're on the edge of turning into a proper commercial developer from a group of fans working for free.  Another great example is when the same Danish company (Interceptor Entertainment) announced that they were working on Duke Nukem Mass Destruction after an investor that they were affiliated with purchased 3D Realms from Scott Miller (previous 3DR owner, had a lot to do with Prey, Max Payne, Duke3D). A fact not many people are aware of is that 3D Realms had permission from Gearbox to work on this game and were well within their rights to.  When 3D Realms had sold the Duke Nukem intellectual property to Gearbox they retained a bunch of rights (movie, tv show, rights to all game before Duke Forever and a couple of games in dev at the time + more). Duke Nukem Mass Destruction was the title decided for one of the rights 3D Realms retained, a tentatively titled game called 'Duke Nukem Survivor (see: http://i.imgur.com/Fppy11Z.png Legal docs with excerpts of the contract Gearbox agreed to and confirming this are here: http://www.scribd.com/doc/264073349/Response-Objection)  Guess who upped and sued them?! That's right! Gearbox and Mr. Pitchford! Unfortunately everyone seemed to blindly take Gearbox Softwares side saying 3D Realms had sold the Intellectual Property without bothering to read into what rights 3D Realms retained.  Not to mention the whole CodeHunters fiasco, or Brothers in Arms blatant bullshots and footage that looks a million times better than the final game...another thing forgotten in the past..not to even mention tearing the Duke Nukem Forever mod tools out of the game, disabling the console and just removing any real way to modify the game even though mod tools had been promised all through development...and the fact that the game 3D Realms were working on and what was released were apparently radically different (confirmed by former dev during interview here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQLqjm_njhk and some more people here: http://www.nowgamer.com/3d-realms-duke-nukem-fans-a%C2%80%C2%98saw-through-manipulationa%C2%80%C2%99/ apparently Gearbox added a bunch of stupid shit to the game, wrote a new narrative..yep, the old references and dick/shit jokes were Gearbox Softwares work not 3D Realms and just stitched together what was finished, its barely similar to what 3D Realms design plan for the game is)  Just one more to top it off: the time Randy lied about where Gearbox Software got its name: http://www.engadget.com/2009/08/17/whats-in-a-name-gearbox-software/  tl;dr: Randy is a lying manipulative dick."

Judging from his tweets, he seems to think that criticism of Colonial Marines and it being different from the promising demo is entirely subjective, and he can deflect it all by disagreeing with it. As well as that it seems like he's imagining that he, Gearbox, and Colonial Marines are the subject of some co-ordinated and concerted trolling attack by critics and gamers, and that if everyone was just honest with themselves for a moment, they'd see it as a perfectly good game."

I don't mind him defending Gearbox or even the game itself, but the game came out years ago, get over it.

Blowing off a little steam around people who understand where you're coming from isn't unusual. Only, these days, everything you say and do in public is recorded and reported on in savage detail.

It’s typically a less sophisticated mind. There’s a dark part of us all that likes the idea of crushing a sandcastle, but most of us will respect it and let it be.""   Pitchford is so far up his own ass at this point he could give himself a colonoscopy. Aliens isn't a sandcastle, it's a fucking garbage pit, they knew it was a garbage pit before they released it, and they still tried to milk as much cash from it as they could.

Aliens: Colonial Marines is the prime example of how far Triple-A studios will go to make a quick buck off of naive, hopeful gamers. Not to mention all this recent news was originally sparked up by comments made by Gearbox themselves.   Jim Sterling explains it better than I do"
Games,3ddeam,wingchild,3,Wed Jul 15 13:55:11 2015 UTC,"His analogies work on an artistic level.  But what he failed to mention (didn't watch keynote, just basing this on the article) is that they are also in the business of making money.  People are going to make critical assessments of a product (artistic or otherwise) based on their perceived value.  The perceived value of Aliens: Colonial Marines is low.  A better analogy would be two ""artistic"" house builders.  One just wants to make unique houses.  It doesn't cost the people critiquing it anything.  The other is done by an artist who wants to generate a profit.  He employs some shady tactics that misleads many people into believing the interior is better than the reality.  Then, when their houses stop selling, they call out the buyers claiming that they are just part of a vocal minority.  You built a shitty house/interior.  They choose to release the game in the state it was in.  Borderlands 1 & 2 is amazing.  A:CM is abysmal.  Learn from your lessons and make better games in the future.  tl;dr - Don't be upset when you mislead people and learn from your mistakes."
Games,3ddeam,qmznkrv,3,Wed Jul 15 14:02:36 2015 UTC,"I understand and empathize with Pitchford's comments if they're divorced from the current context, and are instead presented as part of the Games as Art narrative. He uses the word ""entertainment"" (possibly to avoid the great debate of our age), but I kept hearing ""art"" anyway. Art moves people to a response. Art will be liked by some, hated by others, and the most vocal may go on the attack. While Pitchford sees that as regrettable and inevitable, I see it as both normal and beautiful. I don't think there's anything out there worthy of absolute universal acclaim. I love that someone will always find something to snipe about, however trivial - for dissatisfaction with What Is drives folks to make alternate content, to bring about What Will Be. It's a necessary thing to keep culture from stagnating in the long run.   But I absolutely agree with your point - this is the CEO of a for-profit company that released an absolute stinker of a game. While Pitchford's comments resonate with me in the grand sense, holding them up as a screen to try and defend the intrinsic value of A:CM is very self-serving. But what else might we expect from a chief executive? Nobody's asking him for his grand social commentary; they're asking him to get strapped to the prow of the ship that is Gearbox and to defend their work publicly even when it's poop. We're laughing at his perspective but Pitchford might be doing exactly the job his team needs. Gearbox isn't publicly held, so they don't have investors to placate, and they're not a subsidiary of a larger company so there's no grand corporate master to please - maybe Pitchford's function here is showing his team that he goes to bat for them no matter what. Maybe defending even their worst work in public is simply a way to show faith in them, to help build morale and retain esprit de corps."
Games,3ddeam,weenus,3,Wed Jul 15 14:54:40 2015 UTC,"Maybe defending even their worst work in public is simply a way to show faith in them, to help build morale and retain esprit de corps.    That would be in line with a lot of his other actions. I've seen ex-employees speak highly of the company, and how it stands behind its workers, provides good benefits, et cetera. If defending the work done on A:CM keeps him at the tip of that spear, and attracts talented job-shoppers to the studio, I suppose it's worth the transient consumer backlash."

Games,3ddeam,JudgeJBS,3,Wed Jul 15 17:00:26 2015 UTC,"He went on to use an analogy of building sandcastles on a beach. While some people will walk past and either admire or criticise the construction, others will want to attack it – a veiled reference to vocal critics on games forums.   Ok, but here's what you did... On a beach that has hundreds of well-crafted sandcastles you stood up and said ""Look at our awesome castle!  We built it just for fans of the Aliens franchise!"" and then pointed to what appeared to be, from the angle you've presented it at, a wondrous looking sculpture built with real effort and a deep love for the art of building amazing sandcastles...  Then we went to look at it, and discovered that it was more like a Hollywood studio set than an actual sandcastle.  All the work had been done on the front side that you were to be pointing at when you started calling attention to it. Everything behind that facade was made of mud and leftover animal waste you found lying around. Behind the shining gates you were advertising we found that your walls were dripping and your towers collapsing under their own weight and shoddy design.  The person who kicks that sand castle is not doing it just out of spite.  They're doing it because it looks like ass, and makes the beach less of a desirable place to bring your friends.  They're doing it to tell you, the guys who built the castle, ""Don't waste my time until you can do this shit right."""

It teaches you what you need to know, but then transitions into the main game seamlessly.  So I never felt lost with the mechanics, but there was still tons to discover about the game.  Shadow of Mordor was another really well done tutorial, where it integrated it into the story.  You were teaching your son how to fight, while learning yourself.  Really great presentation that made it enjoyable either way, even on second viewings.  PlanetSide 2 (PS4, don't know about PC) is a great example of a game that has a terrible tutorial, probably the worst in history actually.  It starts off and you think you're going to be told useful things, but you're not.. within seconds you're left on your own but don't realise it.  That coupled with their terrible GUI and lack of in-game information make it have an unnecessarily steep learning curve.  You're then put in a 'starter' zone at the beginning, which honestly lacks almost all the features that make this game stand-out above other shooters - it's a mind-boggling decision to give new players the worst experience the game offers.  When you finally get the game though, it's incredible.. one of the most fun games I've played.  But I can see that so, so many people will never see that.    So, it depends.  It can be done well, but it tends not to be.  I prefer it where help is there when you need it, but it's never in your face and never becomes an obstacle to having fun."
Games,3dj3vm,vampatori,5,Thu Jul 16 18:14:33 2015 UTC,Planetside 2 has a tutorial on the PC version but it's missing from the PS4 for some unexplainable reason.  It used to just drop you on the largest fight and let you figure it out on your own.
Games,3dj3vm,Cup_O_Coffey,2,Thu Jul 16 21:55:20 2015 UTC,"You couldn't be more right about Planetside 2. I started it and couldn't figure out what the fuck I was supposed to do. The entire map was empty, so I drove to the one red spot in the top corner and it wouldn't let me in. There was literally nothing to do. Judging by everyone else in the server driving ATVs in circles and crashing into each other I think I wasn't alone. I said fuck it and that was that.  Maybe I'll try it again one of these days."
Games,3dj3vm,ketchupthrower,15,Thu Jul 16 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"As long as the tutorial in integrated within the story/gameplay mechanics, I see nothing wrong with teaching the player step by step, especially for some complex games.    In my opinion, trial and error is by far the most enjoyable way to learn a game.    No, it's not. For simple games, that may work. But for games with complicated mechanics, it's more just time wasting and a good way for new players to build up bad habit without knowing how the game works."

Games,3dj3vm,hbkmog,19,Thu Jul 16 18:46:50 2015 UTC,"Um... it's quite easy to get into to be honest. The basic mechanics are quite simple and that's why it's popular among young kids. Yes it can get complicated if you want to do complicated things but if you just want to have a 30min short session, there's no problem for a new comer to get into that, which cannot be said for truly complicated games like, for example, Paradox games."
Games,3dj3vm,A_t48,-5,Thu Jul 16 18:49:38 2015 UTC,"Right, and what I'm saying is that that's the best way to teach the player. Tell them the basics and then let them figure out the rest.  For example, in AC, they could have just told the player how to attack, counter, and climb stuff, and that's it. Then the player would start running around exploring, attacking dudes and climbing stuff. Then at some point they'll start pressing other buttons to see what they do, and they'll figure out that Y places a smoke bomb or whatever. Then they'll wonder what they need to do to replenish their smoke bombs, and eventually they'll stumble across the answer to that question.  I don't think there's any need to have a game explain all the details of how everything works. It's boring and it's not fun. Games never used to do that in the past, and I don't think there's any benefit to doing it now. I know there are some really complicated games for niche audiences where the game has no choice but to explain everything, but the majority of games are not like that."

However, something arcadey or something the player should already be intimately familiar with has no excuse to not have gameplay right away.  My favorite game intro was Dead Rising. The game starts you off with a camera taking pictures of the chaos going on to establish the scene, and then after a short break you're thrust into an un-winnable situation where your very fragile character."

Its not ""handholding"" to teach a player how to play a game.  However, I think all games need a ""THIS ISN'T MY FIRST RODEO"" option.  What that is, is you click something, and all tutorials are turned OFF.  The game plays normally without pausing or anything.  All VO teaching isn't played, no overlays, just go straight into the action.  IIRC, Gears of War 1 had this built into the narrative:  One path was the tutorial path where you teach a rookie how to fight, and the other is the ""Fuck it, I'm going my own way"" path.  Worked well IMO.  More games need this.  If you can't do this, then do what Deus Ex 1 did and have a separate Tutorial section in the main menu that's seperate from the main game.  Also a quick reference guide (with videos) in the options menu for anybody needing a refresher of some of the game mechanics too incase they haven't played in awhile.  I've seen some games do this and I like it.  TLDR:  Have tutorials, but have the option to turn them off before you start playing."

Twilight Princess is one of the hardest games to replay for me because the first few hours are just so mind numbing because it's an overly long tutorial.

They just get on my nerves...  The biggest offender for me is Resident Evil 6, as soon as you start the game for the first time, you are forced to go through the tutorial level, and I mean forced in every single way, no chance to check options and get my game into a sweet spot, no chance to check for subtitles, no chance to check the control scheme to see if i'm happy with it, oh no...

Games,3dj3vm,ArtKorvalay,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:52:10 2015 UTC,"Some do it well, many fall short I feel. Cutscenes I think are to set the stage and try and make you feel like you have a connection to the characters within the game and get you into the story. But there's nothing saying you can't do that through gameplay. I recently watched a friend play the start of the new Killzone game and all I could think was 'What the fuck is going on!?'. Funny thing is Fallout 3 did something VERY similar and yet I think did it well. Get ready for some loose and fast novice game theory but here's my thoughts:  In the Fallout  introduction it was broken up with small bits with gameplay were you built your character's stats and get a little taste of vault life. You also got to meet a bunch of characters who you will later interact with in the game. You got do a little father and son/daughter stuff with this guy so it becomes clear he's your dad and you spend a large portion of the game looking for him making there be a connection. It feels important to you to find him.  In the Latest Killzone  I get that these are two very different styles of game from different studios. But the fact remains the Fallout intro it didn't feel like it was TRYING to make me like the characters and their enviroment, its not telling me its important its putting me in there and letting me live it myself. Killzone just sorta sat me in a chair, strapped me down and said ""You care about these people because reasons"". Now I'm starting to think I missed the point cuz both these games have playable sections in their intro so everything I say could be moot.  Edited for spelling derp"
Games,3dj3vm,DivineEmbers,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:59:10 2015 UTC,"New players were very likely to die, but that's okay because that makes the player determined to try again and prove to the game that they can do better.   I don't think this is necessarily true.  This is the old school train of thought -- hardcore gamers wanted to play games.  So yes, they'd play a game until by hook or by crook they beat it.  But the current day game model is going for the wide range appeal, which includes the dreaded 'casuals'.  If you throw a casual player in a game and then they die a couple times because they have no idea what they're doing -- they're going to put the game down and go play something else.    Now on the flip side I, personally, hate long intro sequences.  Most games I play fall into a set genre like FPS.  Yes, I know how to move my character.  All I had to do was look at the key bindings to find 90% of what I needed to know to play the game.  Most of all, if I like a game I'll probably replay it numerous times.  So there needs to be an autosave or something after the tutorial so I never need to play it again.  As long as that's in place (and maybe a 'skip tutorial' feature while we're at it) I'm fine with an intro sequence.  Just don't make me replay it."

Nothing hurts replayability more than lengthy intros or such.

I liked how metal gear rising did their tutorial though, probably one of the better ones to date. You get an option to run through a tutorial virtual reality type thing to learn even the most basic of controls, OR, you just jump into the game and theres a few reminders on attacks and blocks. In fact after clearing the first area you're already met with the first boss, game doesn't wait.   I wish more games did it like that. In fact I think games used to do that."

Games,3dhcgw,Tartantyco,32,Thu Jul 16 10:10:09 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. Part of the reason why games like Divinity: Original Sin, Wasteland 2 and Pillars of Eternity did so well is because they took the fundamentals of old-school RPGs and refashioned them to fit modern standards. People always seem to crave new entries into beloved old franchises or genres, but they want the atmosphere and design philosophies more than they want the graphics and gui. Aside from that, the market changes over time.  One of the best examples of a game that played into nostalgia and got the short end of it is Wildstar. WoW has changed so much over time that people reminisce over what the game used to be with rose-tinted glasses. As such, you would think there's demand for a new title that implements these ideas like in the old WoW days. When it came out, people played it and realised that they didn't want a game with those mechanics, they wanted the feeling they had when they played a game with said mechanics. However, the industry had advanced to a point where certain design philosophies had become outdated to better account for the ever-changing demands of gamers, and as such the game sort of fell flat on its face."
Games,3dhcgw,EmpireSquared,9,Thu Jul 16 11:34:58 2015 UTC,"While the old mechanics may have turned some players away, Wildstar failed for other completely different reasons. I would not use that game as a crutch for an argument against old mechanics.  If anything, the recent massive surge of players on Nostalrius, a Vanilla WoW private server, and the growing anticipation for CoreCraft, a BC WoW server, indicate to me that if done properly, there is definitely a potential market for games with older mechanics. Problem is, the only game that tried it got in over its head and flopped, so now everyone uses that as THE example of why older mechanics no longer have a place in games."
Games,3dhcgw,cr1t1cal,2,Thu Jul 16 14:54:24 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember Vanguard trying a similar approach to what Wildstar did; a reversal of many of the changes that WoW made to the EQ formula. Didn't work either.  Even with throwback private WoW servers we're still dealing with a popular IP with a lot of traction, and a base game (whether it be fully patched Vanilla or BC) with more content than most new MMOs ship with.  I think even if you have the money to compete with an older version of WoW, you're still creating a niche product if you do a throwback to those older versions. There's a reason why FFXIV is the second largest subscription MMO at the moment. It's not really practical to draw in millions of players in 2015 if your game demands they play like they did in classic WoW or EQ. Having the ability to play it in small chunks and being able to make meaningful progress matters. Having content to do that isn't preparing for raids or actually raiding matters."
Games,3dhcgw,zherok,2,Thu Jul 16 17:13:21 2015 UTC,"I'm not claiming that reverting to the old formula will bring in WoW numbers. Only WoW brings in WoW numbers. I do, however, firmly stand that a game that reverts to the mechanics of old (to an extent) can be a very successful niche title. The problem is that these new MMOs like Wildstar think the old formula is hardcore raids and time sinks. That's not the case at all. In fact, I firmly believe WoW was so popular because it was tuned to be easy. You could waltz into Molten Core with 39 other people in greens and blues and still be successful. All you had to do was listen to that guy telling you to stand over here and throw frostbolts. WoW was the perfect social platform, not the perfect game. Games like Wildstar are coming out with exhausting combat that does not promote social interaction and are confused as to why they are unable to sustain any sort of casual crowd. The casual crowd wants a way to interact with and make friends while working toward a common goal.  Why do you think FFXIV is doing well? Slower combat promotes social activity during combat. Plenty of content for the casual player and a constant carrot in front of your nose."
Games,3dhcgw,cr1t1cal,2,Thu Jul 16 19:02:47 2015 UTC,"Is there really a market for niche MMOs? Subscription MMOs in general are struggling, with the few outliers like WoW and FFXIV pulling it off, while many others inevitably ""collapsing"" into F2P while simultaneously slowing content production down.  Even vanilla WoW had a lot of content relative to some other major MMO releases, and producing that amount of things to do isn't cheap. And plenty of MMOs have died due to a lack of things to do at end game (and you still can't ignore early game because of how important that first impression is.)  When it costs a lot of money to get enough content out to the market at launch, it's a hard sell to purposefully only design your game for a certain niche gamer."
Games,3dhcgw,zherok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:20:15 2015 UTC,"Games like FFXI and EVE show that it is possible to maintain a niche MMO. You don't have to release a powerhouse. People think MMOs need to have the latest graphics and newest tech to be enjoyed. I have anecdotal evidence from playing private vanilla WoW servers with coworkers that shows that you can have fun with a game created in 2004. Think how easy it would be to make a game like the original WoW today with the processes and technology we have. It's all about game design. If you don't have a fun game, it's not going to be fun no matter how much money you throw at it.  Look at some of these indie games these days. That Rocket soccer game has been exploding and it's not because it took millions and millions of dollars to make. All you need is a good idea and good design. When Runescape came out, it was one guy and his brother with a good idea. It's possible."
Games,3dhcgw,cr1t1cal,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:31:58 2015 UTC,"Both of those are long-running MMOs, released during the early or peak years of subscription MMOs, not just niches. They weren't made to only appeal to a certain kind of gamer when they launched.  There are plenty of genres and subtypes of games that support niches, but releasing an MMO explicitly designed to only appeal to a particular kind of player seems like shooting yourself in the foot.   I have anecdotal evidence from playing private vanilla WoW servers with coworkers that shows that you can have fun with a game created in 2004. Think how easy it would be to make a game like the original WoW today with the processes and technology we have.    I don't think the fact that some people would find it fun is in doubt, but I'm not seeing why it would be easier to do. It's not like programming that stuff would be. And producing a lot of 3D models and animations (which still have to be good, because WoW even then still played and looked smooth, something that often offset it from other MMOs of the time) is still time consuming too.  If we're talking about making an SNES-style JRPG, then yeah, you don't need to have guys banging it out in assembly, constrained to the limitations of the original hardware. But I don't think it's radically different producing what was then a huge MMO for 2004 in 2015.   All you need is a good idea and good design.   The problem is when that idea includes ""is an MMO,"" because of the overhead the genre inherently requires. You can't do a little quirky indie MMO really, because Massive is literally in the name of the genre. You still need the servers, the content, the end game concepts, the early game processes, and that all takes lots of time and effort. You can't sell a subscription on ""good idea"" if you haven't put the time and money into the execution of that idea."

I think that kind of design mentality wouldn't fly today. Immersion is all well and good but I'm not subscribing to an MMO where I can't do anything of consequence in less than a few hours. Classic WoW was practically a job if you raided. But since then it's far easier to play MMOs casually, and spend as much or as little time as you'd like; there's at least SOMETHING to do."
Games,3dhcgw,zherok,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:00:59 2015 UTC,It did have long distances between places but at the same time it wasn't really a theme park MMO. It was much more of a sandbox and dungeons tended to just be places in the over world with mobs was super cool to see a huge castle in the distance and then be able to explore the whole thing without a loading screen. Not really scripted content like wow dungeons. Plus the game had a huge focus on crafting. It was sort of like Everquest meets Asheron's Call.

It's not nearly as slick as Divinity is in its presentation, but on a scale showing the modernity of RPG titles I feel like it's a bridging step between something like Baldur's Gate and Divinity: Original Sin. It's definitely in the more hardcore end of the spectrum though."
Games,3dhcgw,EmpireSquared,2,Thu Jul 16 19:09:13 2015 UTC,"One of the best examples of a game that played into nostalgia and got the short end of it is Wildstar.    I agree with your conclusion but not your reasons. I think Wildstar had a theme/aesthetics/marketing mismatch from its mechanics. To take this to its extreme, here's an example: a game with Dark Souls or Ghosts n' Goblins mechanics but it's stylized as My Little Pony or some such thing. Would it drive away potential players, even if mechanically it were the most glorious thing ever to be conceived at that point in video games as a medium? Definitely.  But I'm saying this as someone who played the the beta (I forget if it was closed or open, sorry) and was immediately turned off by its theme. The slapstick tutorial was quite hand-holdy and I felt like I was being pushed through the motions. Not to mention a lot of the sound effects and visual effects gave me this ""themepark"" Disney vibe, and that's not even considering the genre implication of the word ""themepark""! It was quite strange to have my mouth's palette contaminated by the theme so severely at a time when everything I heard about Wildstar from other people was that it was being designed from the ground-up as a game focused on old MMORPG values of hardcore cooperation, sandbox (not themepark) exploration, freedom of activity, difficult party content, etc.   I don't think design philosophies can really ""go out of date"" quite as easily as you assert. There's desired behavior (""we want players to cooperate with each other to enjoy our game's content"") at the root of every design decision, regardless of whether a game is an MMORPG or a fighting game or a city builder. The example I gave of behavior is pretty much what MMORPGs revolve around, but there are many paths to reach it."
Games,3dhcgw,pbrand,1 point,Thu Jul 16 18:04:38 2015 UTC,"Having also exclusively played Wildstar during its beta, my frame of reference is quite limited as to what its become post-release, after it's had some time to settle into the market.  I believe there's a place for those philosophies, because there's a niche for just about everything. However, I don't think you can deny that the gameplay loop of WoW for example has changed over time. With WoW having had the monopoly over the MMORPG market for an extended amount of time, people have had very little choice but to adapt to the ""new flow"" of WoW, if you will. The addition of garrisons and dailies, as wel as tons of changes to the raiding mechanics that people had to soldier through because there's not a lot of games that can hold a candle to the amount of content and the userbase of WoW. As such, the standard for MMORPGs in that sense has advanced beyond the mechanics that Wildstar tried to bring back. There's an audience there, but it's hardly one sizeable enough to sustain such an ambitious game.  I'm not saying that it's the sole reason for Wildstar's ""downfall"", but it is one of the issues with the game that I feel is very close to its core, and had a big part of the future of the game riding on its reception among players."
Games,3dhcgw,EmpireSquared,5,Thu Jul 16 19:02:30 2015 UTC,"I don't know why developers don't understand this.  There is a glut of indi games on steam that just have terrible graphics, optimization, features and interface.  There is a huge difference between minimalism and ""old school feel"" and a severe lack of talent/effort on the parts of developers.   It's like with modern art. People will joke that their kid could draw some of those paintings/sculptures but really the artist is making some sort of statement. The problem comes when some huckster doesn't get the joke and actually puts paint smears on a canvas and tries to pass it off as art. That's the feeling I got when I saw this game vs compared to pillars of eternity."
Games,3dhcgw,cromwest,3,Thu Jul 16 16:42:19 2015 UTC,"A severe lack of talent/effort? Having played it for a dozen hours, it blows my mind how two people made a game comparable to Fallout 1 on a budget of ~$28K. A crazy amount of care, talent and effort was involved in making this.   But I'm not citing the budget as an excuse. This game is really deep. It's like the child of Baldur's Gate (1) and the original Fallout, and it makes several smart design decisions that Pillars of Eternity could learn from. You could base an entire game on just the Linguistics skill system. It has great worldbuilding, a completely open, nonlinear narrative, interesting combat systems and monster design, and puzzles tied to the lore that really challenge you.   It's a pity you can't look past the actually quite good (and consistent) pixel art graphics. The interface is not slick, but it's definitely not old-school.  I gave up on Pillars shortly after reaching Twin Elms, but I can't stop playing Staglands. If you like isometric RPGs, you should try the Staglands demo before jumping to conclusions."

Games,3dhcgw,cromwest,3,Fri Jul 17 13:02:27 2015 UTC,Well the reason why games like this have such poor interfaces and graphics is the teams are so small. There is only so much most people can do with limited resources.

They may often have been ambiguous in the skill descriptions yes, but to say they spit in your face for not being one of the designers is a comical and completely off-base exaggeration; if anything they did a better job of introducing you into the game before you ever started up the executable than any modern game does."

There hasn't been much marketing for this game outside of that circle, I recall two or three posts made by the devs in /r/rpg_gamers, and I read a few articles and tweets on RPG Codex. It takes a lot more if you want to reach the ears of the mainstream.  This game was made for rpg players in mind, it's good that they targeted that core crowd, instead of the mainstream. Hopefully the game will be successful.   This has been on my radar for a few months, but I have such a huge backlog of RPG's, I won't touch it for a while."

I played all the classics in the 90s when I was 12. In 2015 I have neither patience nor time to deal with all that archaic bullshit.   The reason why Pillars/D:OS/Wasteland2/Shadowrun were so succesful, is how they match oldschool experience with modern design sensibilities. Pillars and D:OS had stunning graphics for isometric game, for example. Wasteland has reactivity that's unheard of in oldschool titles. D:OS brought the turn-based combat to a completely new level, and Shadowrun nails the atmosphere of the setting absolutely perfectly. These games aren't just recreations of the old formula, a lot of thought and work went into improving them."

Games,3dmezt,BinThereRedThat,18,Fri Jul 17 13:27:49 2015 UTC,"Personally, and I believe a lot of gamers share this sentiment, I do not necessarily have a problem with DLC as a whole. If the content is meaningful and adds something worthwhile to the game I'm all for it, even in a full priced game. The problem is when the DLC is bad or seems overpriced for the amount of content it gives. That's when you see the most backlash. Otherwise it's a useful way to get more content out of a game you already love, when done correctly."
Games,3dmezt,maachun48,4,Fri Jul 17 13:39:27 2015 UTC,"I think OP's question is that even if the DLC is worthless or completely necessary to enjoy the game at all, isn't it still justified because a ""full priced game"" is actually half of how much it would cost in a sane world. As for me, I don't care. I buy the complete GOTY XTREME edition of games 2 years after they come out for $5 on Steam and get all the DLC that way. There exist more games now than I could ever play. If devs want to stop me and others from buying their games like this, then they can stop putting them on sale."
Games,3dmezt,filterforshit,2,Fri Jul 17 13:49:19 2015 UTC,"Exactly, few complaints are about DLC in principle. Almost all of them are about poor implementation, either as day 1 DLC, on disc DLC, low-effort DLC (like useless fluff), instant gratification DLC or simply poor value for money.  Just look at the recent Arkham Knight DLC for great examples of poor value for money. When your main game costs 50$ and offers 25 hours of content, just how do you justify selling an additional 2 hours of content for 9$?  DLC is fine when it adds meaningful content post release. Unfortunately real expansions have become a rarity as developers would rather save all meaningful content for the sequel."

Games,3dmezt,adriardi,5,Fri Jul 17 13:41:32 2015 UTC,"My thoughts on the subject can be summed up thusly: video game developers are fucked unless something significant changes.  This is particularly true of AAA game development, whose costs are spiralling out of control.  Incoming rant; It'll be a long one  The Problem with Pay  I've worked in the video industry for about a decade.  My most recent experiences in game development have soured my opinion on the industry so badly that I'm currently taking a (possibly permanent) break to do contract work in other industries.  One of the things that has soured my opinion this much is that as a video game professional, I was paid way too little for a job that entailed way too much stress and way too many hours.  I'm a trained, experienced project manager.  A project manager with my background can make well over $60,000 a year in non-entertainment software development.  But in my last, shitty job, I was paid $45,000 a year to work 60-70 hours a week on a problem project.  Due to the studio's mismanagement of finances and eventual shutdown, I didn't even get paid the full $45,000 I was supposed to get for a full year's work.  I'm just one frustrating story in an industry full of such stories.  There are artists, designers, programmers, and producers working these supposed ""dream jobs"" at high-profile studios like Infinity Ward or Treyarch who are paid a fraction of what they would be paid if they worked in the film industry, TV industry, enterprise software, etc.  Yet folks like me continue to flock to places like Los Angeles and willingly accept less money to work in an industry with notoriously long hours and appauling quality-of-life across the board.  As a former video game professional who regularly reads complaints on the internet from gamers who are enraged that they had to pay $5 for DLC, I get a little miffed.  And I wish that the folks doing this complaining would stop for a moment and consider that not everyone in the video game industry is a money-grubbing, millionaire executive cackling as he and his cronies plan on making the next horse armor DLC premium.  A majority of the video game industry comprises people just like you and me who live paycheck to paycheck and who wonder if they'll have a job after release day.  Future of AAA?  Fuck if I know  I honestly don't know how AAA game development is going to survive if it continues going this way.  Indie game development will find a way to survive, for sure.  There's no shortage of talented, creative people who can make fun, engaging games by themselves or with a small team.  And right now it's surprisingly easy to get your original game released on Steam, GOG, iTunes, Google Play, whatever.  (It's easy to get your game released, but getting people to buy it is an entirely different challenge.)    I'm not saying that video games are going anywhere; developers of the smaller games can and will survive.  But the blockbuster, AAA game segment is in dire straights.  Devs are already getting paid peanuts; I don't see how the big companies can reduce costs anymore than they have already without turning game studios into sweatshops.  Since reduction of cost doesn't seem to be a viable option, then their only option is to raise prices.  But when a company charges $5 for a AAA game's DLC - fuck, when a mobile developer has the audacity to charge $0.99 for their app instead of making it free - someone anonymous internet user gets all up in arms about how game developers are greedy.  Something's got to change."
Games,3dmezt,TJ_McWeaksauce,2,Fri Jul 17 16:45:32 2015 UTC,The way I have always looked at games and dlc is this. Is the base game worth the price I am being charged? If yes buy it if no don't buy it. Is the dlc offered worth the price if yes buy it if no don't buy it. I will never be one to complain about on disc dlc or day 1 dlc or any of the other stuff people complain about because they feel entitled to it. If it was never advertised as part of the base game and you buy it that tells me that you as a consumer felt the the game was worth the cost without the dlc.
Games,3dmezt,tonyal18,2,Sun Jul 19 12:23:35 2015 UTC,"I would rather have smaller, complete, games. The real problem is that developers are being forced to go bigger and better and do too much at once (incredible graphics, cinematic story, addictive multiplayer, massive open worlds, hundreds of hours of content and much much more).  I don't mind larger expansions made after the fact. Expansions like the Dark Souls DLC and XCOM: Enemy Within are awesome. It didn't feel like they took away a part of the game to make more money."

And if you look at some of the broader trends in the game industry, especially the tendency of most AAA developers to make sequels or other safe titles, it explains that too. If publishers were allowed to charge more for games, say 80 instead of 60, then more niche titles could be made, because they would need fewer sales to be successful.

My only 'condition' would be that if they're going to sell the base game (or perhaps 'lite' game) separately is that it doesn't feel like anything is missing, what is there is complete with itself.  If anything it's interesting when people pine for the old days (when a SNES cart was $70 in old money) and packed to the gills with side content, yet a comparable option is available today.  My main counterargument to the logic of game+DLC=price is that if they're doing it the costs of making it are already paid, so why not just offer the higher price. The counter to that though is the same reasoning why we have sales, to get the most out of buyers at a range of price points, you'll be missing out on people who only think it's worth the lower price, so give them a way to give you some money with the option of more later (DLC)."

Games,3dmezt,contrabandwidth,-1,Fri Jul 17 14:20:12 2015 UTC,"I am not sure why this is a question? Paid DLCs existed for . . . how long?  Your argument is big flawed, however.  Even though the cost of game development increased, there are several other factors. The games are far more main stream now and more people are purchasing games than ever before. Video game industry is growing faster than any other entertainments. Furthermore, cost to manufacture the games plummeted due to mass production & digital distribution.  Downloadable contents didn't exist not because companies were profiting without them. DLCs didn't exist because there was no solid digital platform to sell them."
