I think stories about those cruelties should be shared broadly with everyone... because we can still see it happening today although in a lesser form.   I have visited Auschwitch and Mauthausen within the last 5 years. I'm 29 now. Auswitsch was huge and incredible... but Mauthausen made me shiver more (and I'm not the most sensitive guy). It just gave a nasty feeling being there. jak!   And indeed... recently they have found that Mauthausen was so much more than thought: Lost nazi underground weapons testing bunker  Terrible place to be..

I'm personally not a fan of authors editorializing their subjects' feelings on whatever they're researching, especially for such an intimate part of the subjects' pasts.

All the mannerisms and emotions she doled out to main characters were cited from journals or first-account witnesses. I'm fine with that, and The Guns of August is one of my top ten books on WWI.   What I don't understand is why readers or even the 'historian' or history enthusiast themselves would gain from botching historical objectivity, especially on a subject like this that people already don't know much about.

But, yes, it is only claimed without any facts backing it so i may be wrong there.  There was a huge discussion in germany when hollywood came here to turn a crucial episode of our history into a blockbuster. Which ended up being better than many people feared. You just have to suppress historical knowledge while watching, when for instance Stauffenberg meets Hitler, Himmler, Göring and Göbbels at the Berghof (who were never there simultaneously) and then even gets Hitlers signature for the Valkyrie document (which in fact he didnt). While Tresckow is portrayed as one of only two co-heroes (who actually didnt fly to berlin to get the bomb back, which is a long sequence in the movie) all the other conspirators are portrayed as lame, cowards even. This is especially unfair towards Olbricht and Fellgiebel, brave men who died for trying to end Hitler. And then there is the ridiculous stuff like Stauffenberg's glass eye in the whisky glass that probably makes good movies but has nothing to do with what happened.  Sorry, im not in the mood for a tl;dr, but just consult the internet. There must be an uncountable number of historians who have listed each and every inaccuracy in the movie, and i assure you, there are plenty.

Certainly the movie has flaws due to trying to reduce a highly complicated plot to a two-hour runtime, but I think we can both agree that it could have been a lot, lot worse. I was recommending the movie as an introduction to Stauffenberg (I'll edit my original post) and it's a good movie in that respect - much better than something completely fabricated like, say, Braveheart or The Patriot as a jumping-off point."
history,3dx0jg,arminius_saw,2,Mon Jul 20 21:28:13 2015 UTC,"Sure, I agree, it could have. As I said, I enjoyed watching it, more than once even. One important difference to Braveheart or The Patriot is that there are still people among us who remember nazi time. I felt with them when the Olbricht family publicly resented the filmmakers for what they did to their father/grandfather.  You totally got me with the two movies you quoted. I know waaaay too little about scotish or american history to be able to judge these two from a historical perspective. I liked both of them as well, but more for being action packed popcorn drama for a saturday night. With all the black and white and very little grey in there it seems obvious that both movies dont attempt sophisticated storytelling with a substantial historical background.   Ok, whatever, let me just add i envy you for having the chance to study at McGill and having seminars with guys like Peter Hoffmann. That is something i would clearly prefer over watching Valkyrie for a 3rd or 4th time ;)"

Antony and Octavian then clearly shared power and worked together to suppress Caesars assassins followed by a war between Octavian and Antony in the late 30s B.C. Its not until 27 B.C. that Octavian (now Augustus) can claim to have inherited Caesars power as sole ruler of Rome. For nearly 20 years it was not at all clear that Octavian would emerge as the sole ruler of Rome like Caesar.   By contrast when Augustus died Tiberius was already recognized as a co-ruler and power passed from one to the other immediately and peacefully. It took the Senate about a month to confirm Tiberius's claim to sole power as opposed to the 20 years between Caesar and Augustus."

It was Diocletian who ""regalized"" the image of the emperor and styled himself as a living deity.  It might be because Augustus career was somewhat short on personal military victories as he tended to delegate the fighting of battles to Agrippa."

Diocletian came some 300 years later, remember, and really the change from princips to dominus was cosmetic more than anything else-- it's not like emperors like Caligula, Commodus, Helogabalus, etc., were anything but autocratic, self-aggrandizing tyrants already, and also styled themselves very much as living deities."

Augustus did away with the Republic and established the Roman Empire, making him the first emperor under Roman law."

history,3dx925,GwayneRoyce,5,Tue Jul 21 16:50:51 2015 UTC,"The problem is in defining exactly what we mean by the word ""emperor"". The title itself, unlike later empires, did not exist. So we cannot point to some grand coronation ceremony that clearly marks the ascension of the first Roman Emperor. Therefore it is necessary to go through a few of the possible candidates and access their claim to the title ""first Roman emperor"".   Julius Caesar: Often cited as Rome's first emperor Julius Caesar was almost certainly not Rome's first emperor. Although he held the title ""Dictator Perpetuo"" (dictator for life) he did not establish a method of monarchical succession. Furthermore a permanent dictatorship was nothing new as one had been established a generation before under Lucius Cornelius Sulla, albeit with a much more long winded title: dictator “legibus faciendis et reipublicae constituendae causa” (dictator for the making of laws and for the settling of the constitution). Furthermore Caesar's method of rule by the sword was pre-dated by both Sulla and Gaius Marius.  The one real argument in Caesar's favour is the fact his heir, Gaius Octavian (Augustus), did establish a permanent system of monarchical succession. This was probably in line with Caesar's wishes as he seemed to have monarchical ambitions. But the title of “Dictator Perpetuo” was never inherited, nor was it inheritable, and much of the work of establishing the inheritance of power had to be done by Augustus. Lucius Cornelius Sulla: If one is to seriously consider Caesar's dictatorship an equivalent to “emperor” then one must also consider Sulla. Sulla is an extremely unlikely candidate however as he specifically attempted to make a permanent monarchy impossible through his constitutional changes, specifically the introduction of the cursus honorum. But Sulla has many of the characteristics of an emperor, he led a military dictatorship that he acquired via civil war and brutally slaughtered all of his political opponents. But, and this is a huge but, Sulla resigned his dictatorship voluntarily and allowed the republic to resume. If Caesar is to be considered and emperor then Sulla must be too, but both candidates seem extremely unlikely candidates for that title. Augustus: A consensus has grown around the idea of Augustus as the first emperor. At no point did Augustus declare himself king but he is the first to establish a new title which was inherited: Princeps Civitatis (first citizen). The title was entirely honorific but Augustus' personal power, wealth and the sheer number of constitutional titles he acquired gave the office the power and majesty we would normally associate with the title “emperor”. Later the honorific “Augustus” (revered one) would come to basically mean “emperor”. There are a few of problems though. Firstly, Augustus was never constitutionally imbued with monarchical power, although he wielded it in all but name. Secondly, Augustus actually shared absolute power during the early period of his reign with Marc Anthony and Marcus Lepidus. This means there is a decent argument that Anthony and Lepidus, or probably just Anthony, should be considered early emperors too. Overall however, it seems the title of Princeps Civitatis became the real prize and signifier of imperial authority. The fact that this title was wielded absolute power, was inheritable and successfully inherited means it fits the criteria for “emperor”. This means that Augustus is almost certainly Rome's first emperor by any reasonable definition of the term.   Conclusion: Augustus is almost certainly Rome's first emperor. Apart from those listed there are a few other potential candidates, such as Diocletian (the first long term emperor to embrace divine monarchy), but for simplicity's sake Augustus makes the most sense and is most commonly cited by historians as Rome's first emperor.  tl;dr Probably Augustus. Might have been a few other guys but probably not."
history,3dx925,svarogteuse,3,Mon Jul 20 13:03:48 2015 UTC,"Caesar was a continuation of the strong man seizing personal power in violation of Rome's laws and Constitution that had been going on since the fall of Carthage. While he got himself named Dictator for life but he wasn't changing the structure of Roman politics like Augustus did. Caesar was just continuing the tradition of a victorious general with a personally loyal army seizing power.   Augustus once he came to power did things very different, he changed how the government work and he passed that power immediately, and peacefully to his heir, who passed that on, who passed that on. There is a clear continuation of a new form of government after Augustus that didn't exist with Caesar. As well as the near 20 year gap between Caesar and Augustus when it was very unclear Octavian (Augustus) would even come to sole power. Under Caesar the power lay with the Senate, except when a strong man with an army forced his will upon it. After Augustus the power lay with the Emperor however weak he was. Men who could never have seized power on their own (Caligula, Claudius, Nero) were handed power and the Senate was second fiddle to them from the start. This is very different from how things were before Augustus and why we recognize Augustus as the first Emperor but Caesar as just a Dictator.   Being Emperor wasn't about being in sole power, it was about the structure of government in and around that man that was substantially different than the structure that existed under the republic."

history,3dx925,Alundra828,2,Mon Jul 20 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"Caesar probably technically was the first emperor of Rome. But it's more of a point of view problem.  See, Caesar held power that was originally elected to him for life. Which would make him dictator, not emperor. But the power was given to him under the impression that he would be an emperor.   So you could see it as him becoming an emperor (albeit for a short time) and then became a dictator. But some sources cite that Caesar has no intention of ever giving up his power from the get go, so unofficially made himself a dictator.   You've also got to take into account that this whole system of government was relatively new in the area. It basically fanned the flames for more and more advanced forms of feudalism in Europe with his famed Claudian dynasty. So as a result, the Roman people did not consider Caesar to be an emperor, they considered him dictator. And if the general roman populous thought that, we probably should to.    typed this on my phone, so i'll likely get sources later"

history,3duvdg,Who_Is_Mike_Jones,16,Mon Jul 20 05:38:46 2015 UTC,"ITT: Mormons telling you to ""go to the source"" and get information directly from the LDS Church and its college. If you want good information about the church you will need to balance any official sources with sources from outside given the long history of the church ""lying for the lord"" and sanitizing history to ""be faith promoting""."

history,3duvdg,PhilosopherBat,3,Mon Jul 20 06:00:08 2015 UTC,Depends on if you want their current views or their perspective at the time.
history,3duvdg,byeberlin,4,Sun Jul 19 23:52:49 2015 UTC,"Ex mormon here. To be honest, the LDS church does keep a shit ton of records open to the public that if you know what you are looking for you can find it pretty easily. Even stuff that doesn't agree with their current day beliefs. The LDS church really does have a hard on for history and preserving it for the future generations."

history,3duvdg,falsecognate,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I would contact a librarian at the University of Utah. They would know of good sources. There's also a military fort, Fort Douglas, on the U of U campus that you could contact and find more information."
history,3duvdg,SmittyTheDank,4,Tue Jul 21 16:01:39 2015 UTC,"You might also want to take a look at  ""The Great World of the Spirits of the Dead: Death, the Great War, and the 1918 Influenza Pandemic as Context for Doctrine and Covenants 138.""  (George S. Tate) in BYU studies quarterly.  Rather than looking at the role of the church in the war, he looks at the impact on the war of the development of the ""Vision of the Redemption of the Dead,"" exploring from the perspective of a believer how the war shaped the doctrine of the faith.
