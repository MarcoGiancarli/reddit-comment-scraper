I now expect the timely return of stolen Feralis property, which includes:  2 diamonds  Diamond pick with Efficiency II  Several stacks of charcoal  All of my food  Lots of other stuff I can't remember at the moment.  They also harvested half my wheat without replanting, and they attempted to steal my ship but it seems they were unable to navigate the mouth of the bay. Various structures have also been damaged, though not severely.  I am also very surprised to see a certain individual associating with these raiders. An explanation would be appreciated."

TheRealmsMC,3dvujt,Dnessen,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:37:09 2015 UTC,"Don't worry about dying when you start out, that might happen.  Getting established is the hardest part, once you find a nation you're comfortable with it's a lot of fun.  Dnessen is correct in that it's probably best to tell us your preference in play style, good examples of things to note are what size nation you'd like and if you prefer a certain building style.  For instance, Brauden is a smaller nation which has the benefit of being easier to have a bigger role nationally and globally in politics but also there will usually be less people on when you are logged (although you could always visit Hanaq!).  If you are patient enough, it might even be good for you to visit every nation and see what suits your tastes, or you can just browse the 3d map."

TheRealmsMC,3dvsvh,NOTredtao,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:44:34 2015 UTC,"I'd download voxel map. Since we have a limited world in terms of how far out you can travel, knowing where everything is is very handy. I'd also get acquainted with the 3D or flat map, found on the right sidebar, so you can further figure out where you're at. Talk to people via private messaging (/m or /msg), they're pretty nice.     We have a lot of custom plugins, so there's some unique features that aren't on other servers, so I'd read the tutorials for those. The biggest thing to read IMO is the citadel and namelayer guide, as that's how you'll protect yourself from raiders, and ensure your items are likely going to be there tomorrow. It won't stop a determined raider, but it prevent you from being raided by someone just passing by.    In terms of roleplaying, I'd create a character. Decide if you want to participate in a religion, figure out a profession, and see what nation your character meshes with. If you like to brew, I'd recommend checking out St. Germain. If you like ships, Britannia's got an amazing collection. If you like the desert and the sun and animals, Salinas is pretty chill. If you're more a fan of the north and living in the mountains and those new granite blocks, I'd talk to Hanaq. There's a bunch of other nations that I didn't mention because I'm lame, but you get the idea. :) You should also jump into teamspeak and chat with some people, we'll be able to better help you that way!"
TheRealmsMC,3dvsvh,submissivehealer,2,Mon Jul 20 00:23:15 2015 UTC,I'd recommend joining a nation first. Even if you're not planning on staying you can atleast get yourself tooled up. Due to the plug inns getting by on your own is tough at the start.    Evidently I am bias as the King but Hanaq is always looking for new people!

You claim a country, then play that country in whatever time period the specific game is set for. /r/WorldPowers, the biggest, original, and one I play, is set in modern day, and goes up to about 2070 or so. It's semi-realistic. /r/empirepowers, the second biggest, takes place from 1500 onwards, and it too tends towards semi-realism. /r/Globalpowers, one of the first spinoffs, is also set in modern day, but it tends towards a stricter realism.  There are x-powers subreddits of all kinds. You just try to find one that suits your interests, and preferably has an active community. I suggest you try /r/WorldPowers first, as it is, in my experience, the best one for beginners."

TheRealmsMC,3dkxys,Shadedjon,2,Fri Jul 17 18:56:25 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with your sentiment, Megans. When i saw the list of Comanche players I thought aww shit, this is the dudes who just ran around killing in civex, who gave the entire server ultimatums backed by violence and generally played the part of some sort of evil empire, all based on the fact that they don't invest time in building as much as everyone else and rather spend time preparing for and executing war. There is a reason HannibalK used a different account when he came here. Cause we all know him from civex as a shit-stirrer just for the sake of it. We gave him shit for not building in civex. So now he's built a vault and a wall. Consider me not fooled.  I don't mind conflict, but the reality is, a lot of us work, and in different timezones. These dudes are just willing to dedicate themselves to violence and pvp, while I frankly don't have the time to do that AND build a nation. And I can tell you... I don't play minecraft for the coolpvp.  If there is war between nations, there is war between nations. But this is more like a slowly growing army of orks under the Tower of Saruman than anything."
TheRealmsMC,3dkxys,Skolanthropy,4,Fri Jul 17 15:53:49 2015 UTC,"However, you made a post that implied you were going to war with a great deal of post and made a claims post that one could say was absolutely just there to stir up trouble, considering part of the land claimed belonged to another nation.   That's how civ servers work though, right? Banning an entire nation for doing something that is part of politics is a little counterproductive for a ""civilization RP server""."

TheRealmsMC,3dkxys,daddo69,-5,Fri Jul 17 03:08:23 2015 UTC,"I joined them cuz they're my friends and asked, fire nation was raided to non-existence by drama lovers in its first day though, never got to show the server all the nice builds we had planned. The only time I did anything pvp related was kill Quaksy because I was dying of hunger, and he wouldn't let me farm, sleep, or give me food, and was generally cancerous.   If you're talking about civex, no, I  Fought them, but was displeased that admins attacked them while in god mode and told me where there base was and where they were."
TheRealmsMC,3dkxys,littlebird16,3,Fri Jul 17 03:15:42 2015 UTC,Do we just ignore the fact that you were the one who made the Fire Nations claim on the reddit?
TheRealmsMC,3dkxys,daddo69,0,Fri Jul 17 03:54:06 2015 UTC,"Do I have to be a leader to draw on a map?  Sorry everything doesn't happen ""the Quaksy way"" all the time."
TheRealmsMC,3djpd8,fluffytigerguy,2,Thu Jul 16 20:39:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, this is such bullshit.  Someone should go vassalize Comanche for a couple of days, see how they like it."

TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,Highboy16,6,Thu Jul 16 21:13:46 2015 UTC,"Timeline   I____I is on Brit land harvesting sugarcane like he often does. Hears members making a plot to kill him. One of those members stops by our land and lies about his intents so we pearl him. Other conspirators stop by Comanche land, pressumable for the same reason but refuse to talk to us to explain. I follow one back to Brit who still refuses to explain himself. Brit hole in their castle and kill me with tnt after I refuse to leave. Again this is because I want an explanation. After I die a team of 3 returns to recover our gear, that offer is not taken seriously. Fights break out, we leave with 2 pearls."
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,HannibalK,3,Thu Jul 16 21:17:07 2015 UTC,My IGN is SCope13 and I was with eswanson777 at the time we entered Comanche land. He doesn't have a reddit account.  First off let me explain eswanson777:   he is my brother he has dyslexia so in game chat is difficult for him we were on skype at the time   Now let me move into what we were doing:   it started as a legitimate exploration mission with no end goal just looking around we ended up in your land not knowing it was yours we simple rode our horses through with no harm intend we were then met by verbal hostility from the members online eswanson777 fled I was met with more hostility and when I was off your lands with no weapons drawn 2 of your members kept following demanding to see eswanson777 I stated I did not know where he was which was the truth. He went into the jungle that is all I knew and he himself didn't know where he was. He simply ran. I then saw a drawn bow so I got back on my horse and ran.   Then the aggression at britannia started. If we wanted to kill you we had our chance to strike. 2 of your members had their back turned and we could have stuck. instead we talked and came into view. After being met with hostility I lied about my nationality (which technically I did claim Eslor as my own).  Now a key factor as to why you are so upset about eswanson777 was the fact he drank an invisibility potion. Now I'm not sure why he did this. But he was on a horse so it was obvious someone was there and I was right next to him. You also obvious have snitches so you could tell there was two of us.  We did not strike first. If you which for a further explanation I will be happy to give it during the peace talks
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,swanyMcswan,3,Thu Jul 16 22:06:15 2015 UTC,"That's all reasonable, I appreciate your input, thank you.  We were just on edge because we were expecting an invasion force from brit to be landing any minute. The second we saw you two we thought it was game on.  That's why I followed the swan man back to Brit and demanded to speak to him to hopefully either confirm/deny a plot to kill me/invade us.  The peace talks will mostly just be redrawing borders. We're reasonably guys."
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,HannibalK,4,Thu Jul 16 22:08:36 2015 UTC,Time line   I___I after declaring a big nation that is agresive to all other nations  comes and casually picks Sugar canes with out noticing any of the members Of Britannia.. Sounds legit...

TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,IrishWolfy,3,Thu Jul 16 21:23:21 2015 UTC,The time is yet to be decided. The government of Britiania will decide the time so they can be better represented at the talks.
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,Dnessen,2,Thu Jul 16 21:33:09 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would prefer to see the time, so we can have some representatives from the UNS there."

TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,HannibalK,4,Thu Jul 16 21:44:03 2015 UTC,Lecter has invited people from Civcraft to raid and PVP. And that they will do.
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,Skolanthropy,4,Thu Jul 16 21:15:46 2015 UTC,I've been playing hard here for well over a month. Recently some friends expressed interest so I invited them over to join my nation. We expanded land accordingly and that was met with aggression and plots to kill me from Brit.  If Swanson and LordSaad wouldn't have refused to talk to me/tell the truth it never would have escalated.
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,aposii,6,Thu Jul 16 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"You annexed someone else's land. That is aggression. Aggression was met with aggression, man."
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,HannibalK,3,Thu Jul 16 21:58:33 2015 UTC,"Well, you've brought friends over and now say that you will make everybody submit to your will. You are the HCF here"
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,aposii,-1,Thu Jul 16 22:43:46 2015 UTC,We're sorting all the issues out tomorrow via peace talks/resolutions and are not currently raiding Brit. Probably the worst comparison I've ever heard.
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,HannibalK,3,Thu Jul 16 22:48:12 2015 UTC,"No, you brought some friends who come from a different server, to our server, then proceed to take it over and eliminate all that stand in your way. No difference, just admit you're the bad bully who's using religion as a lame exuse for raiding people."
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,littlebird16,-4,Fri Jul 17 00:55:52 2015 UTC,Calm down lol.
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,HannibalK,2,Fri Jul 17 00:57:29 2015 UTC,"They are right. You have chosen the wrong person to mess with. I've had it! This is the last straw. If my people are targeted one more time I will fight till I cannot anymore, then I will leave. PERMANENTLY."
TheRealmsMC,3djtxu,littlebird16,-4,Fri Jul 17 01:07:29 2015 UTC,"That wasn't a very scary threat haha, but either way you'll be satisfied tomorrow."

TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,IrishWolfy,5,Thu Jul 16 21:06:30 2015 UTC,Last night I was on later than everyone else and designed a banner for our nation. I thought it looked cool and proceeded to make more and put them up around our city. When others logged on they pointed the similarity out to me. We decided we would still leave it as our nations flag. I personally apologize to anyone I may of offended.
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,Highboy16,5,Thu Jul 16 21:42:10 2015 UTC,It is a great looking flag. Regardless of where it came from.
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,Chloride,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:54:38 2015 UTC,But you have no right to place them in another nation.
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,littlebird16,2,Thu Jul 16 22:17:35 2015 UTC,I've taken the confederate flags down. Not sure who put them there.
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,JTRaccoon715,2,Thu Jul 16 21:27:52 2015 UTC,"You should have left them up for now, just to be safe until someone could come and look at them."
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:37:55 2015 UTC,I'll give them back if someone asks for them.

TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,Dnessen,2,Thu Jul 16 21:08:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but they might look at what someone has placed in the past too, and said."
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,daddo69,2,Thu Jul 16 21:09:26 2015 UTC,During the Civil War the South said they were just using House Bolton flags?
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:19:29 2015 UTC,Was referring to what Daddo has done haha
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,daddo69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:20:49 2015 UTC,You can't put stars that small on MC banners. The is The closest they can get to the Confederate flag

TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,daddo69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:17:15 2015 UTC,"Ah, they look the same, maybe that's a symbolism thing since the confederate flag represents rebellion. Maybe there are rebels in Woodstock."
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,littlebird16,2,Thu Jul 16 21:18:33 2015 UTC,"I might be blind, but the Bolton flag and Confederate flag look completely different ahaha"
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,daddo69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:21:28 2015 UTC,"Really? Bolton just looks like a confederate flag at a diff angle to me  In minecraft you can't make it look like a person being flayed, just a few rectangles, which unfortunately looks like a confederate flag."
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,littlebird16,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:28:34 2015 UTC,But the coloring is completely wrong to be a bolton flag.
TheRealmsMC,3djsyr,daddo69,1 point,Thu Jul 16 21:31:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, someone should fix that, or else they might be misinterpreted to be rebels, instead of Bolton sympathizers."

TheRealmsMC,3djnl7,LordSaad,0,Fri Jul 17 00:08:38 2015 UTC,well back then you did not have a nation that threats all of the other nations..

TheRealmsMC,3djnl7,littlebird16,2,Thu Jul 16 21:58:09 2015 UTC,So you were eavesdropping and spying on Britannia first then I see. That seems like a pretty aggressive move for Comanche. I don't think you're the victim in this.
TheRealmsMC,3djnl7,littlebird16,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:31:31 2015 UTC,Farming sugarcane. Our nations had been trade partners. I've farmed sugar cane here often and often stayed to chat.

TheRealmsMC,3dktvj,littlebird16,3,Fri Jul 17 02:15:25 2015 UTC,I think that this can be easily solved. Just ask the Moderators why you have been banned and for how long.  /u/Quasky   /u/submissivehealer  /u/The_Zantid

TheRealmsMC,3dktvj,KortexVortex,0,Fri Jul 17 03:27:09 2015 UTC,"Let's be honest, it's a survival server now. Civ-esque still implies that it has civilization qualities. A big part of civilizations are land disputes, take that away and it's just a server to build on. Both parties claim that a peaceful solution was in the making, so I don't see why Comanche should be banned.  On the topic of my ban, I did speak with them. I did it the day I was banned. I had a nice chat with how I wanted to still play and all that."

As it was pull along in the storm, several maelstroms formed along the adjacent sea. The captain tried his best to navigate through them, but it was too late. The vessel was sucked into the maelstrom. As the crew awoke to the sounds of waves crashing on the beach, they saw new land. The place seemed foreign everything that they had known had changed, the air had different smells, the foliage was different, and voices rang out in several of their heads. Each one a different voice, all welcoming them to the world known as Spera, a foreign and mysterious land, filled with many treasures and untapped resources. The voices rang out in their heads, Terra, Lux, Erebos, Tenebris, Gleichia, Fulgur, Ellatrix. They sent a cry forth that split the large crew of the passenger vessel into different groups, each following a different want and need."
TheRealmsMC,3dgz2u,MavellDuceau,4,Thu Jul 16 04:58:13 2015 UTC,"Of those groups, five were struck by Fulgur's call. One so strongly that the storm flowed through his flesh, soaking his skin a rainy blue and striking lightning in his head. Another heard the thunder roar through his bones. Together they clambered across the trees, grass, and stone, scrabbling to reach where the storm danced and the thunder sang the name of the eldest of the child-gods.  After days of trekking, ceaselessly towards their goal, the mountains rose before them. And Fulgur heard their coming, and branded them kings. The blue-skinned Lightning king worked the earth, and crafted the very first terrace of their kingdom. And the Thunder king built the first halls, and dubbed it Hanaq, to reign above the land in the thundering name of Fulgur.  ((yo any other Hanaqis wanna add on, go right ahead))"

Light seemed to fade from where he was, further hiding him from view. A twisted cruel smile crept across his face as maniacal laughter filled his very being. Slipping away from the group he headed North East, killing animals and foul creatures alike. his clothes became tattered and a mask was made to cover his twisted visage. Erebos had claimed him as his vessel and through him his will was brought into the land of Spera."

I think screen shots would be good to show off a bit of whats been built as well, seeing as that would indicate a somewhat ""civilized"" server with people who do stuff."

Maybe play a bit off of the custom professions a bit too to show that each person can make a name for themselves in their own nation and be a service.  Definitely bring the Gods into it to, bring up the events that are held too.  I'm up for helping with shader picks if people want to point me to nice locations, Nations or natural."
TheRealmsMC,3d9sgy,xizion,4,Tue Jul 14 20:49:19 2015 UTC,"It's a late Friday evening, and you've just finished a long day of work. It wasn't a particularly difficult day, just long and tedious. You contemplate what to do, but you know there's really no question: You're off to the finest bar nearby: The Terran Tavern, located just that away, two hundred units past the big tree, and a left after you hit the old oak tree that used to be there (Get it? Because you don't know where a tree used to be after you've cut it down? God, I'm so funny).    Of course, the drinks there are quite simply the best in Spera. It's always worth going, the bartender, Jack, has this way of making sure you always get buzzed and when you get drunk and pass out, he always manages to make sure you wake up in your bed in the morning. He's quite skilled: it's even rumored the bartender can make elixirs originally crafted by the Gods!  Jack is a follower of Terra, and believes in utilizing the best possible ingredients for his brews. No expired wheat or burned breads. He even has a secret strawberry garden in the back, tended to by his wife, Anna. Anna is probably the sweetest inn keeper you've ever met, and you've spent at least several nights in one of her many rooms. The best part? She has a cure for hangovers. Lovely, lovely lady.  Quite prepared to get absolutely plastered and wake up without a headache, you're ready to make the journey down to Terran Tavern. It's a long boat ride away, but you've decided you're going to ride in style in your hot air balloon. It's got a new-fangled creation in it, to make sure it can make the long distance, one that your best friend Jeremy spent ages creating: an engine. Oh-ho-ho boy will the boys at the bar be jealous of your beauty. A bit of wool and wood and your engine, and you'll be able to take them around the globe!   With an off-thought on how awesome it would be to get drunk on your aircraft, you start to pack your supplies. A few emeralds, a set of iron armor (just in case. Can't be too careful!), an enchanted bow that your ex-girlfriend Susan spent time writing runes in, a handful of arrows, and a few loaves of bread. You pause, and decide maybe you should be extra prepared and grab a golden apple, just in case you see a dragon on your way. You're not usually superstitious, but your neighbor Carol swears on his mother's life that there was a dragon that had flown by not even a week ago, and you don't want to be shot down from your aircraft. Just in case, right?"

TheRealmsMC,3d9sgy,Dnessen,1 point,Tue Jul 14 18:35:37 2015 UTC,"I think a short, infographed explaination of the most recent ""war"" and the political/ religious repercussions would do well to get people excited about the potential of the server. Religious conspiracies, renegade tyrants, secret mercenary actions, violence, massacre, and religious zealotry, destruction of nations, emergence of new ones. Despite all the drama, this episode is one of our strongest selling points. An animated gif map of the war ala ww2 movies would work well.   Edit: we need to name it too. Religious war? Tiny's Upheaval? War of Lux's Demise? Erebos' Ascendancy? War of Dark and Light?"

TheRealmsMC,3d9sgy,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:54:47 2015 UTC,"You awake to find yourself in a tavern, groggy, and with no recollection of how you got there. The table your head was previously resting on is littered with bits of bread and mugs of ""golden apple cider"". The chatter starts to fill your ears as you come to a little more. You can pick out words here and there but some seem unfamiliar like Spera, or Lux and Erebos. It all makes no sense to you but it seems that people are picking up after a drawn out ""civil war"". You gather your thoughts and muster the strength to leave. The Tavern owner nods at you from the bar as he stands there idly cleaning out a mug. The day is just dawning and you can see the sun just starting to rise from the tops of the trees. You only then realize you have an important choice to make. knowing you have no supplies should you stay nearby? or should you chance it and head off in search of a new adventure in the great wilderness beyond. A chill runs over you and a great shadow approaches. But, just as you start to run, the cheerful visage of a man named Z floats into view. Thinking nothing of your previous fear you bow shortly and say hello. In an equally cheerful way he tosses you a stone sword, some bread and a few diamonds. With that he leaves and you make up your mind, adventure awaits you in this new world..."

We may not always get it right, but we were a team that prided our selves of working together to do what is best for the members here. This included showing you the respect of giving you a second chance and not judging you despite how disrespectful your first actions were here.

Honestly I think this style of minecraft just takes too much time to play right. Its always going to have a hard time keeping good players playing for long.  Anyway if we had a reset, Astronomica would likely not return. We bailed on civex after putting in lots of work, hoping to invest in a world here. We don't have all the time in the world to just keep rebuilding places... Hell we aren't even done with Astrograd.   I vote hard no on a reset. It doesn't matter to me that you are willing to rebuild, I can't get my time back and I've already wasted too much, this is a game after all.

TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,NOTredtao,5,Sat Jul 11 15:45:27 2015 UTC,"Phase 1 Complete:   Have bunch of people from the other server come on and build nations  Phase 2 Complete:  They all quit due to this not being a ""civ server"", leaving living breathing ruins of actual nations in their place.   Phase 3 in progress:   Recruit non-otherserver peeps who care more about the nations than the petty ""civ server"" drama, and have them explore and marvel at the ""ruins"" of nations come and gone, picking over the remains for ancient artefacts and treasure. With which to forge their own future from the ruin of others.   Phase 4 Planning:  Bring the world they've come to understand crumbling down around them... leaving players as the last bastions of true survival on the server...   /s      (Seriously, just to make perfectly clear.. the above really is just a joke though I'll explain more below).       I'm loath to have a server reset, mainly because people really have put in a bunch of time, loyal, awesome people who have done nothing but stick to themselves and enjoy themselves on the server - away from the drama. I can name at least 5 who I see regularly playing who I've never seen cause any drama, and generally manage to have fun with the world and plugins all to themselves in their own little nation. I don't want to reset because of them - what have they ever done to deserve to have a nasty Admin come along and say ""Right folks... looks pretty but.. do it again!""   Secondly.. I really could build a new map, make a bunch of ruins to put in it, place some treasure chests, write a whole bunch of lore for each ""dungeon"" and each location.. but screw that. The lore we come up with Gods wise, are forever and constantly changing and always based around the world I see you lot make and change. Seriously, I could never make a ruin feel more ""real"" than walking through the abandoned structures of a nation now long dead.   As a new player.. walking through the empty streets.. looking in the buildings.. seeing the stairs down into their mining tunnels.. looking and salvaging resources to make a build their own house. Looking for treasure long forgotten by others in vaults half broken, or secret rooms now nothing but something to be discovered by a new owner..  I could never build a world full of ruins than the like that can only be generated over time. I could never make a living breathing ""map"" of nations, past, dead, alive, building, like that which occurs over the life time of a server like this.   Nations, Empires, cities grow, they fall, they grow again - they get forgotten, they get written about, they are then re-imagined and rebuilt.       You're right, we are separate from the other server, and you're right - we're very different and as such we should, need, and wish, to attract a very different audience; but why can't someone enjoy both? Don't get me wrong.. I LOVE mint choc chip icecream.. but I also enjoy a little vanilla every so often. I don't ever want people to feel like it's ""one or the other"" because, I think as humans that's just not the way we work.   But in general, yes, our ""audience"" for this type of server is very different. The key thing to remember though... is that I'm not here as an ""experiment"" I'm not here as a ""I want this server to be bigger that mineplex!"", we never made this server to compete in any way with others - we find ""competing"" highly silly, even more so when all that competing would do is stroke some internet ego rather than anything else. This server was built as the type of server ""We'd enjoy"" - and because of that, it may not ever get a huge player base, it may never be the biggest server on reddit; and I'm perfectly okay with that. I'd rather play on a server with 30 decent, great, enjoyable people who I know aren't going to ""cry"" or cause drama when we RP together and one of us ""loses"" by spending a few days in the end. I'd rather that, than a server of 400 whom bitch, cry, whine and cause drama because they want to ""win"".   If anyone has ever played D&D, or any type of roleplaying table top game in general, there is no winning as an individual in those lore based games, there is only expanding and telling a story, and building up as a group - over time to make a story of epicness and memories in which in 10 years you're sat looking at your buddy across a pint and say: ""Dude... remember that time Dessan jumped into the volcano to ride the dragon.. yes. that was freakin' sweet"".      I kind of waffled.. I'm sorry for that.      However, do expect a post from us shortly, we'll be detailing ways in which everyone can get involved with things like advertising (I know there are the few of you who have messaged and text asking for how to help, well soon you can! :) ), a long with the direction, and our thoughts on things. Sorry for the super long post here :("

TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,AllesAlex,3,Sun Jul 12 02:44:17 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear you're leaving. I do agree that the server deserves a re-launch with a more stable bug/ plugin basis (and with bastions, a necessity) so that it doesn't feel like a slap in the face if something or several rules are changed. The server has grown kind of stale, and the amount of drama that has happened over the last week and a half is proof of people having nothing better to do other than building their own nations.  I've always disliked the close relationship this server has had to CivEx, especially since people tend to come from there to purely raid on TheRealms and never do any RP or nation building. Because of these types of raiders we do tend to lose a lot of people that aren't even on both feet yet. In general, the plugins are overwhelming to newer players, and many probably get turned off from the inability to get basic resources. (There definitely needs to be more plugin tutorials for newer players)  As for your lack of interest in playing, I don't know what to tell you to remedy that, yet I understand the hard hits of losing all your items can be. However, those hard hits seem to be warranted after you raided Mikoto completely with people that were hardly active for the past week or two (with xHippo getting the ban boot on that again). War seems to always have the worst consequences when you live in different time-zones.  In any case, I wish you safe journeys in wherever you go, and hope you find a server that picks up your will to play again."
TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,AllesAlex,-1,Sat Jul 11 15:03:32 2015 UTC,"I'm glad someone agrees with me. I think you wrote it better then I did though. Bastions are already apart of the game, you can craft them using the FactoryMod.  I was originally planning on doing a series of tutorials for people, but I honestly can't be bothered to. I'm just tired of all the drama and stupidity.  I'm not upset over the fact, that Mikoto stole my items. In fact, I don't think they stole anything of great value from me, that would upset me. I'm annoyed because they popped the chests, to simply let my items despawn. They also wrote dix 'dick' on my farm, in replanted carrots and they griefed a little. Also, I'm pretty sure most of the Mikoto Empire is in North America, meaning their very close to being in my time zone. They even got on and ran off.  I honestly hope things work out for the better here, I'd hate for all the work that Zantid and Megan have done, to go to waste."
TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,AllesAlex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 23:50:24 2015 UTC,"I really don't want a reset, not any time soon. New people can just occupy the claims and buildings of in-active (or quitted) players. I really don't feel the drama where I live, and I believe that this is just part of the server; people who leave, and people who come.  However, it's not cool to see you go. I admired you for your great empire, and your cool maps. But it's not my call to tell you to stay, it's your own decision.   Good luck, Ehini.   Alex, Eudora."
TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,AllesAlex,0,Sat Jul 11 12:24:02 2015 UTC,"I'm not suggesting a reset, simply because of all the drama.

No offense to the current ones, of course."
TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,AllesAlex,2,Sat Jul 11 12:26:43 2015 UTC,"I don't really think that new players will come because of a reset. Removing current in-active/abandoned nations would be enough. It would also create some space for them to create new nations.  I agree on improving the mod-team, but by adding new mods. I would like to have more mods, for creating better and faster interaction, also by solving problems. The current mods are doing it great, but I feel like they need some back-up."
TheRealmsMC,3cwmiy,AllesAlex,1 point,Sat Jul 11 12:34:36 2015 UTC,"The whole appeal of servers like TheRealmsMC and CivEx, is that your actions matter. If I joined something like CivCraft, nothing I do would matter. Nobody would even know who I am, or what I do. I'm not saying new players don't have that capability here, but it's certainly harder, now that there are already established nations. There's also problems with the current map, which is something a LOT of players dislike. (i.e, lack of ore generation, leaves not despawning, the map is essentially stolen, and the fact there aren't any caverns)"

TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,The_Zantid,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:02:27 2015 UTC,Is there a reason why noteblocks are allowed but not jukeboxes?
TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,Shadoulin,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:29:06 2015 UTC,"Probably so you can reinforce jukeboxes inside the ships, so then you're snitching and keeping the ship from moving."
TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:32:27 2015 UTC,"You can reinforce everything. Also, noteblocks can be reinforced as snitches too."
TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:34:04 2015 UTC,"Well, you can reinforce any material, but as soon as the ship moves, it's no longer reinforced, that's why you hide blocks that cant be moved inside your ship, then reinforce them."
TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"Really? I thought you could reinforce a block and it would stop a ship from moving, no matter what block it is."
TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Thu Jul 9 17:38:03 2015 UTC,"Nope, only certain blocks, that's why emerald reinforced obsidian is common on ships, since you have to break the obsidian to be able to move the ship"

TheRealmsMC,3cp23j,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 18:10:19 2015 UTC,"Elevators are a platform that you can make like any normal Movecraft ship - but they only move in two directions: Up and Down. (allowing you to have them as an elevator in a tower for example).   Portcullis are the gates you'll see on castles, the barred entrance ways. Again, they can be made like any other movecraft ship and can only be moved up and down."

Basically the world is split into 3-ish main continents, each with the same capabilities. I say capabilities instead of technology as they differ in how they go about making things. The biggest continent, Anocia, is highly magical with advanced systems like levitating ships and giant complex structures (even working on teleportation/ dimension jumping, this sort of ties into the story) while the second (smaller, but not by much) continent, Vallitoria, is technologically advanced in the traditional sense, if traditional sense is steampunk. The technological capabilities of both are somewhat akin to industrial revolution era tech, with obvious deviations (Magical flying vehicles + Giant steam powered mechs). Oh wait yeah, the third 'continent' is less of a continent rather a large string of islands in between Anocia and Vallitoria. Named Aiteronia it's technological advance-ness has come from the washed up remains of Anocian and Vallitorian tech. They're sort of a Polyneisa like area, but with patchwork peices of different tech.    My god that was a horrid wall of text. Spoiler- Anocia and Vallitoria go to war which ends up not being good for Ateronians.  I should post in /r/worldbuilding sometime.    Quick edit- I should mention the continents are home to their own countries, but are all drawn together to war eachother. May have to steal some names from you guys for countries..."

TheRealmsMC,3clfta,littlebird16,4,Wed Jul 8 22:35:53 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if you're going to lock enchanting to only researchers and lock repairing enchanted gear to only blacksmiths, I'd would rather you let people be able to retain 2 professions (being able to switch between only 2 unless risk losing 1) so that 2 man nations have a chance of actually maintaining their items. This will also combat the issues of adding new professions in the future (Server population isnt as high as well, so that will also be another factor for smaller nations)  XP is also still a huge complaint from people, but I think it just needs some slight adjustments to get rid of the monotonous grind of it all.  I am also currently vomiting from the smelting fix... I just switched to blacksmith from lvl 10 researcher after both of our nation's blacksmiths quit. I didn't know that the smelting thing was a bug, I thought our blacksmiths just had that ability from the get-go :(....  I would almost rather that you keep smelting for lower leveled blacksmiths, but only let them smith items in tiers (lvl 1-9 stone, 10-19 gold, 20-25 iron and 26-30 diamond) with the final product at lvl 30 being the smelter which will allow everyone in your nation to be able to smelt their objects down instead of just you. Additionally it would also be nice to be able to smelt down chainmail items to maybe coal or some other useful material."
TheRealmsMC,3clfta,NaarbSmokin,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:44:10 2015 UTC,"That sucks that you had to loose all that researcher experience, I know from personal experience how hard it is to level up."
TheRealmsMC,3clfta,littlebird16,5,Wed Jul 8 23:28:02 2015 UTC,"A huge yes on the blacksmith and researcher idea lol and ive noticed that repairing stuff on yhe anvil does not reward any exp could be a bug? And as pokefanyush mentioned,  anvils are crazy expensive so it would be nice for a blacksmith to use either something else or be able to repair anvils at a fraction of what it takes to make one (like what factories do lol)"
TheRealmsMC,3clfta,CptChaos3201,2,Wed Jul 8 23:16:56 2015 UTC,The key being make is cheaper for blacksmiths not harder for regular players. Right now there are few if any high level ones and you don't want to cripple the economy.

TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,xizion,5,Tue Jul 7 20:33:14 2015 UTC,So why is my sentence increasing when all I have done is sit in the end? You are punishing me for the actions of others. Seems a little unfair to me.
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,ItsCookieMonster,3,Tue Jul 7 21:51:15 2015 UTC,They wanted you mate..
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,GizmoGear_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 21:56:01 2015 UTC,I understand that. The thing is I had nothing to do with it. This just makes me think that I should have pearled people when I killed them instead of instantly releasing.
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,ItsCookieMonster,3,Tue Jul 7 22:06:18 2015 UTC,"They wanted you specifically, I can't help but believe that there was some kind of alliance between you and them.  You requesting a public execution and then this happening soon before it with their desire of your pearl makes it seem even more likely.  I'm sorry but I can't risk you teaming up with them."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,ItsCookieMonster,2,Tue Jul 7 22:02:52 2015 UTC,They know me from when I was in Mikoto. We do have a history and I am glad to call them my friends. I still had nothing to do with this. It was their own decision to do this. I wanted the public execution for the RP reasons and thought it would be something fun for everyone on the server.
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,NaarbSmokin,4,Tue Jul 7 22:13:25 2015 UTC,Right... so Mikoto griefing St. Germain had nothing to do with you getting pearled by a member of St. Germain? And 911Leila raiding Britannia had nothing to do with your execution? I'm gonna say you're closer to Mikoto than you ever were since you left it....  You're simply a cookie that can't escape the cookie jar it seems....
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,ItsCookieMonster,3,Tue Jul 7 22:31:41 2015 UTC,Who is a member of st.germain? I am guessing Gizmo. I haven't talk to any member of Mikoto since the pearling except for veggiemonsta. If are simply punishing me for the fact its possible I had something to do with it. I honestly have nothing to do with what they did with st.germain and their other actions today.
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,VeggieMonstaa,0,Tue Jul 7 22:56:01 2015 UTC,"Nah. If Mikoto had wanted to release him, we would have dug out his pearl ourselves. He had no bad blood with St. Germain after his pearling and accepted his fate peacefully. He wouldn't have asked for the public execution if he didn't want it."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,NaarbSmokin,4,Tue Jul 7 22:36:47 2015 UTC,"A public execution would save you the trouble of having to dig in the vault for 10-30 minutes, seeing as you can kill the executioner during the event in just 2, no?   As much as I want to say Itscookie isn't associated with his old Mikotan mates, recent events have largely stated otherwise:    Mikoto ironically raiding Salinas with cookie.  With Mikoto raiding/griefing St. Germain the same day cookie gets pearled, right after making a silly Sun Tsu quote that war should not be 'prolonged'.  Now a former Mikotan member comes within an hour of Cookie's execution killing an unarmed attendant and me after I tried chasing them down [I suck at pvp and hate minecraft pvp TBH]   I suppose it would have been a good parlour trick (in a perfect RP fashion) for cookie to give his speech and have the Mikotan maddened remnants attack everyone (or cause a diversion) and free him like he were Jack Sparrow in Pirates of the Caribbean. I feel another hole in the fabric is that Zantid knew the plan (or had gut feelings about it) and said he would be avoiding the event as a result.  Instead now there's no execution...  Damned pirates...."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,ItsCookieMonster,3,Tue Jul 7 23:04:48 2015 UTC,That's fine I can understand not taking the risk of a public execution. The problem I have is the fact you want to increase my punishment for actions I didn't commit.
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,The_Zantid,3,Tue Jul 7 23:17:55 2015 UTC,"lol I always have a gut feeling about Public gatherings (I'd been asked whether I was attending multiple times, which directly tipped me off on the ""Hold up peeps.. you're trying to get me to attend this whole thing rather much.. I think it's best I stay here in my bunker"")  Plus, lets be honest.. Every, every, social event on a server like this turns into a blood bath. Pickle's wedding. Blood Bath. And what gets more peaceful than a damned wedding?! Not to mention any other such gatherings. Way more comfortable avoiding the crowds and many sharp swords itching for ""some fun"""

TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,KortexVortex,4,Tue Jul 7 23:11:30 2015 UTC,"Well Naarb, the glorious thing about this whole situation is the fact that yes we asked for peace, but did we get any? No. We were raided by Rident (who quit) and hippo (who only gets on when shit goes down). We were up for just letting it go, no point in starting another war, when Nerd started demanding reps and borderline control over Mikoto. In the end, enough was enough.we weren't going to just lie down."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,NaarbSmokin,3,Tue Jul 7 23:13:54 2015 UTC,"Thanks for explaining this, but what did St. Germain have to do with that?"
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,KortexVortex,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:15:38 2015 UTC,"Our original contract stated that we were supposed to pearl Dnessen. He wasn't on, so I raided him instead. The farm grief IMO is based off of a fuzzy line on the anti-farm grief rule. It states that you must leave enough to replant, so I thought that leaving one crop per field would be enough, but I guess not."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,Dnessen,2,Tue Jul 7 23:18:51 2015 UTC,"But you didnt just raid me, since my house was more or less untouched. You raided people who lived in a peaceful nation, also you even said yourself that they part about me on the contract was removed, thus making you now look the part of a liar. Also, you left no carrots or sugar cane, so you saying that you left enough to ""replant"" is bs."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,littlebird16,1 point,Wed Jul 8 01:10:23 2015 UTC,"I have a quick Question. This Contract, is it the same one that called for the pearling of TwistTheCat?"
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,littlebird16,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:20:45 2015 UTC,Damned pirates....   Too funny
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,ItsCookieMonster,5,Tue Jul 7 23:09:31 2015 UTC,"I understand what you're saying but you've got to see my point too, you're good at PvP. As are they. At the moment they have dissolved Mikoto and can pretty much do as they please, releasing you to them would just make things worse for the rest of Spera.  I'm sorry the public execution had to be cancelled and this result has come out. I have been the one in favour of keeping your sentence short, some others have been encouraging me to lengthen it.   I will try to make this as fair as possible. You will be pearled for 18 days, if after today and until that point the raiding, pillaging and aggression towards Britannia and other nations ceases you will be released.  If they are good friends of yours and they want you released sooner rather than later they will stop this aggression."
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,KortexVortex,2,Tue Jul 7 22:21:18 2015 UTC,So now its because I am good at PvP. If I was terrible at PvP I wouldn't be under this new punishment? You are still using others actions to punish me.
TheRealmsMC,3cgvyr,VeggieMonstaa,2,Tue Jul 7 23:00:47 2015 UTC,"I can confirm that Cookie had nothing to do with it. Mikoto had a motto ""Once a member, always a member."" Their attempt to free him was on my command."

They stole from him and he was merely retaliating.  Edit: It's pretty aparent after this recent raid of St. Germain, that KortexVortex doesn't intend or want to play anymore. I don't see why his ban is only a week. He literally wrote dix ""dick"" on my farm. Scratch that, I thought he was in violations of 3 rules."
TheRealmsMC,3cfedk,Ehini,3,Tue Jul 7 14:24:29 2015 UTC,"xHippo has been banned twice before for griefing, he only signs on when there is something for him to raid or kill. While I understand he may be a member of your nation, I really do, how often has he signed in? What has he been building? Where has he interacted with people on the server that hasn't lead to him griefing or killing for the sake of it? I like Hippo, he's fun to hang with in TS, but I think it's clear he doesn't wish to play here from his previous actions and his not signing in until he can kill / raid.   That, coupled with his previous punishments has led to the current one. :(  Edit: Kortex has played on the server for a long while signing in regularly, Mikoto has a bunch of lore they created, and this is his first infraction. As I said, it's a minimum a week, and if Kortex does not wish to play here again I'm sure he'll go his separate way and find somewhere else he'll potential find more enjoyable, or he'll modmail at which point a discussion will be had with him. (Which is why we ask people to Modmail before their unbannings, it's so that we can have a straight up honest sit down and discuss things)"
TheRealmsMC,3cfedk,Ehini,2,Tue Jul 7 14:28:33 2015 UTC,"Hasn't xHippo only been banned once before? and Dnessen was forgiving of him for doing that. He's not much of a builder, which is why I set him up in Gizmo's old place, until I could build him a more permanent location.   From what I understand, he originally intended to build a dwarven nation in the volcano, but that proved hard to do, since ghasts would spawn in the caverns and because there was an issue with overheating. That's when I asked if he would be a guard for my nation, which he gladly accepted. Also, if it truly is his second banned, then wouldn't it only be for a week? since rule 11. states his second ban would only be for 1 week."

Maybe go so far as making these subreddits unaware that they are on the same server.

TheRealmsMC,3c88la,large_hippo,1 point,Mon Jul 6 06:18:49 2015 UTC,I have an offer for you. No war or criminal act is involved.  I am willing to train one or more people of your choice in the arts of medical care. I just need time to recover my books and other supplies. I extend this offer because I know that you have a difficult time with the pox disease and overheating.

TheRealmsMC,3c88la,littlebird16,0,Mon Jul 6 03:42:08 2015 UTC,"I want you to never accept a contract again.  That was the start of the conflict, and that's where it will end today.  You all said that you killed and pearled members of Salinas as if you had no choice because of a contract you accepted, but it was your choice to accept the contract in the first place.  Since you seem inable to judge between reasonable honorable contracts and ones that cause you to prey upon the weak and innocent, it cannot be allowed for Mikoto to take contracts anymore."
TheRealmsMC,3c88la,NerdOctopus,4,Mon Jul 6 07:03:11 2015 UTC,"That's a bit over the top don't you think? They've been honest the entire time that they're mercenaries, I don't think anyone should've been shocked even though I believe they probably could've conducted themselves better."
TheRealmsMC,3c88la,SlyIsSpooky,2,Mon Jul 6 09:35:40 2015 UTC,"They act as if they had no choice in accepting the contract they were given, as if it made them faultless.  They could have declined and conducted themselves with some honor, knowing Salinas had not deserved the actions their contract stated.  No, it must end with at least some sort of terms to restrict the methods with which they take jobs."
TheRealmsMC,3c88la,NerdOctopus,3,Mon Jul 6 10:05:28 2015 UTC,"I agree that they shouldn't hide behind the contract as an excuse, but a jobs a job."
TheRealmsMC,3c88la,SlyIsSpooky,0,Mon Jul 6 10:07:36 2015 UTC,"If they are going to take jobs like that then I believe they are little better than raiders as a whole.  If one person took diamonds to pearl people then the server would pearl him.  If a group does the same they should be punished as well.  If you are going to RP as mercenaries with no care for which contract you accept and how right or wrong it is, then I will RP as the justice you deserve."
TheRealmsMC,3c88la,NerdOctopus,3,Mon Jul 6 10:11:15 2015 UTC,"Alright then, that makes sense  Still think demanding no contracts ever is a bit much tho"

TheRealmsMC,3c5cw8,IronWolf209,3,Sun Jul 5 08:29:37 2015 UTC,"Hey there, Jay.  The reason you have not received a flat out answer from me and the reason I have avoided answering you in general is because last time we spoke, you said some very rude things to me, and I didn't want to be scolded about how I was running my server again.    You're right. Advertisement was missing on day 1. My attempts to advertise after one week were criticized by you and Raxus, and you insulted how I went about it. The advertisement, I thought, was a decent one. An advertisement is better than no advertisement, even if it was done in about twenty minutes.     You were not in teamspeak, by the way, in this meeting. Raxus and I spoke about ways to go about this. We talked about increasing building and increasing the lore in the server. Raxus, in fact, was very adament that we cannot start lore from nothing, people want to explore the lore of the world that was already built and so we should encourage players to create that lore. That is why I went with a lore-building competition first, rather than a building competition.   Raxus asked for his girlfriend to have fly powers so that she could fly around and record, telling me that she would be able to help with this. I honestly thought that it went okay, she was given fly powers and I spent several hours in teamspeak trying to help her install shaders before we realized that they really didn't work on her computer, since it was a Mac and they - for whatever reason - weren't compatible. I offered to help record, since I could get shaders to work. I didn't realize that I would be the only person recording. I took quite a few videos, not all of them usable. I was trying to be helpful.  :/  I did not know Raxus would not be available for three weeks until maybe a day before he was supposed to be gone. I don't have specific dates, because I never thought that it would be brought up into this big of a deal.   In regards to the video quality, I told you that I didn't have video recording or viewing software on my computer. I didn't know what I was doing, I was taking advice from you, while working on doing other, more pressing things. I thought you guys were recording too, I didn't think I was the only one. Can't stress that enough.  You asking if you should bother advertising felt like a slap in the face. After such a long delay, it felt like you didn't care about the advertisement, especially since my/Zantid's questions about advertisements went pretty much unanswered, except when Zantid asked about the MCservers ad. It wasn't until after that, that you asked for the videos. I thought you had them the whole time.     Reading your comments about what you thought of all the hard work that's gone into the server made me very, very disappointed. ""pissing around for six weeks"". Fixing bugs, adding new content, working on a lore event for the server to give people something to do. If trying to improve things for people on the server is considered pissing around, maybe it's not worth it, for me to bother improving the server. That's what you've told me.       I don't want more arguments, I think they're detrimental towards the moral of the server and it forces players to pick sides and just makes things worse. I don't know how to fix this, I don't think this can be fixed. There's too many hurt feelings between the two of us, and I just wish you the best on your new server."
TheRealmsMC,3c5cw8,submissivehealer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:16:08 2015 UTC,"My response can be found ere in this other thread in which you insulted myself and megans and told us we'd put no effort into the server in the last six weeks :(  http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRealmsMC/comments/3c3dtq/tfw_raxus_hasnt_signed_in_but_posts_memes_here/css7m48  Am glad you made a decision of your choice though. As the  said in my other thread, ""forcing"" you to complete something you don't wish to, is not my intent and would be good for no one."
TheRealmsMC,3c5cw8,The_Zantid,2,Sun Jul 5 00:52:21 2015 UTC,This sums it up.
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,Dnessen,6,Sun Jul 5 00:48:04 2015 UTC,"I view it as, ""Our enemy is online, we're online, lets get on our ships and take the fight to them."" I want to see things such as castle sieges, sea battles, dog fights, city wall sieges. And then once the other nation has been completely pearled, then you start the pillaging of chests, but no griefing.   Everyone wants that. And yet - when it comes down to it - they don't.  This has nothing to do with the Realms and completely lies in risk management.  Stepping completely outside of any Realms drama, here is why that admirable wish is so difficult to pursue:    People naturally want to win an opposed conflict, so they look for any way to help stack the odds in their favor.  Attacking where your opponent is weakest is one of the best ways to do so.   In real life and in Minecraft SMP, you try to bring as many people at a time and place when you are facing the fewest number.  While the concept of ""offering honorable battle"" is romantic, it is rarely pursued without significant social pressure.    So, if you don't want ""night-time raids"", you need nations of a size that ensure they are never seriously unmanned.  You need communication and dedication at a level where people can be called in to rush to the battle at any time.  You need enough military intelligence to have enough advance notice to call said players into battle before it is ended.    Some games, like Evo, are able to meet those prerequisites and have giant pitched battles.  Most Minecraft servers are not, at least not without server rules in place to limit conflict.     TL;DR: The goal of a conflict is to win, not to simply have a giant pitched battle."
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,TinyEmperor,2,Sun Jul 5 03:43:20 2015 UTC,"Well said.  When it comes to total war, as it often does, and especially when I am the smaller party:  I'm not here to make you feel good."
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,NerdOctopus,0,Sun Jul 5 04:51:42 2015 UTC,"But, how does one 'win', when all their doing is senseless raiding? If someone is not willing to fight, then their just being cowardly. The Novigradian empire attempted to offer an honorable fight to the Mikoto empire, but instead, they ran like cowards and retaliated when nobody was on."
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,Ehini,7,Sun Jul 5 03:53:31 2015 UTC,"Winning a conflict generally means your opponent is unable or unwilling to continue to fight.    I suspect you may have ""winning"" confused with ""acting like a romantic honorable storybook hero."""

It was terrifying, there was a good chance we might loose everything. But it was not a case of ""let's go grief land"", me and about 10 other people in Kūren built a huge wall and barricade and stayed put untill a threat came past. It was practical chaos, but it was amazing, one of the best experiences I've had in minecraft. Granted yes, I did leave CivEx but not entirely because of the war- Sure most of my friends were moving here but I didn't really like some of the stuff that happened there, plus the RP on here is better!    If I'm going to war, it needs to be full on siege mode. If I should loose then yes I will be upset, but I can work that into some form of RP!

TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,submissivehealer,1 point,Sun Jul 5 01:15:46 2015 UTC,well I think civ servers are inherently RP because we are RPing as nations.
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,submissivehealer,2,Sun Jul 5 01:27:08 2015 UTC,"True, although on here, it seems like lore and roleplay are a larger focus, along with nation building."
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,The_Zantid,2,Sun Jul 5 01:57:00 2015 UTC,"True, but I personally believe that when a server designates itself as RP, it has a certain goal in mind.  Back on the CivEx server, the RP was totally unnecessary and it was up to the players to make anything up on their own. Kind of anarchic and completely free to all.  Here, players have a base where you can develop upon the known lore and each individual can contribute to making it more complex and interesting.   I feel that the focus of this server was upon the RP and how individuals live within the community constructed world. Civ serves focus on the politics and even psychological impact of people living within an environment with potentially limited resources. Or at least that's how I perceive them both."
TheRealmsMC,3c5lal,TwistTheCat,2,Sun Jul 5 02:00:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, this server does allow for politics and psychological analysis, but it also allows for individuals to create rich stories that help to improve the experience. I feel like books on here would be amazing."

TheRealmsMC,3c555g,GiantCarrotMan,7,Sat Jul 4 21:55:51 2015 UTC,"Well, it's more of an RP server, and was advertised as one rather than a civ server.

No one will miss the complainers   Yes I know this will probably end at the bottom of the thread with a -2 score or something because you know I am right. I am guessing you have not seen the actual damage done by these raids. Taking /u/Littlebird16 as an example, she worked extremely hard to make Salinas what it is today, but to go off on a camp and come back to see what you have worked so hard on, get destroyed in front of your eyes. That hurts! She has also been forced out of Salinas due to being forced to convert Gods. As someone said in the another thread    it's crazy how they are acting like Terrorists in the Middle East, They capture you and force you to follow what they follow, or face death   Can you actually STOP AND THINK who you will effect if you post this. I left Salinas to get a fresh start. I am however hiding with TwistTheCat, planning to resurface in a few days time and start work on the construction of Woodstock. You see, Twist and the other ""exiles"" are fearing surfacing, due to people like ItsCookieMonster attacking them again.    ""This is a CIV server"" What a poor excuse!

However, they should stay out of major dramafests, and not do anything which may introduce bias or try to influence the world beyond the level of a normal player. RP Not a problem with the server per se, but some of the player base. People were excusing their dickish actions by claiming its 'RP'. Just because you tack some gods to it doesn't mean its RP, even in real life, modern or medieval or whatever, if you cross the line too many times, you wont get respect. Its as simple as that. This is worse, and less realistic  than anything on CivEx since NerdChops days - I feel like this server is just another Civ server with a all too thin veneer of aar pee"

I also agree with your point about ""RP"". We've had one guy blow up Xhakúm because he was worshipping ""Allah"".

TheRealmsMC,3c555g,Skolanthropy,2,Sat Jul 4 23:40:55 2015 UTC,I concur with the throat thing. We joined a religion because it seemed interesting and unique from an RP perspective. We worshipped Erebos because it was new and had a energetic leader behind it who created great lore. I expected make-believe theological debates but not straight out religious intolerance and fear-mongering war chiefs.

TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,Schmiggety,2,Sat Jul 4 13:17:34 2015 UTC,Please post personal opinions as a reply to this comment.
TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,uselessdoodler,2,Sat Jul 4 13:18:15 2015 UTC,"I see player retention as one of the largest issues for now, since we have already seen some Britanians and Novigardians quit over recent events. The only way I could see this changing is if we designated some nations as totally noncombatant. This would allow people who really don't want to be raided to build in peace. We could have repercussions for attacking said nations, meted out through a United Nations. If you want to, you can draft up a list of 'war crimes', and enforce those to make raiding less frustrating.  This segways into the issue of wars. Yes, people on the losing side are going to be upset. I don't think there's anyway we can avoid that. If we want to minimize hurt feelings, we could try to cut back on gloating in the subreddit. Mikoto was guilty of this, with my 'Empire Strikes Back' post, but if we conduct wars in a businesslike matter and leave the gloating ingame, we can hopefully avoid upsetting those who lose. Rules of conduct for war would also help.  As for perma-pearling, what was the greatest amount of time anybody has ever spent in the end? Pearling for the sake of pearling would make you a serial killer or rampaging murderer ingame, and should not be tolerated. To prevent lengthy sentences, we could either up the amount of gold needed to keep someone in a pearl, or create an international body to negotiate for their release. Human Rights Commision, maybe. RP can easily justify keeping someone in the end, and it should be up to the players to contest that. Maybe any RP pearling could require a lengthy post on the sub about WHY they were pearled?   That's all I can think of."
TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,Shadoulin,6,Sat Jul 4 13:40:40 2015 UTC,"What does it cost to keep someone pearled? Is it possible to have the cost increase over time, to make it harder to keep someone permapearled?  I think some people are forgetting that by pearling someone, you are effectively banning them from the server. That's fine if you catch someone griefing and need to stop them from doing further harm, but to just go in and pearl an entire nation for up to a week? When the server already enforces a longer respawn delay for PvP deaths? That seems a bit excessive. It shouldn't be surprising that some of those players might not want to stick around, especially if the conditions for being unpearled involve leaving behind everything they've worked to build.  RP conflict is expected, but remember these are real people you're interacting with. Don't make the game unplayable for them."
TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,VeggieMonstaa,2,Sat Jul 4 17:19:18 2015 UTC,We did not pearl a nation for a week nor say we were going to. The only person who would potentially have been pearled for a week was Twist.
TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,Shadoulin,2,Sat Jul 4 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly have no idea what actually happened, as I had left Salinas the night before this all went down. Not spreading propaganda, just confused and wondering what the hell I've gotten myself into with this server.   What is considered an acceptable duration of a pearling, when it's done for RP reasons? I still think a week is excessive, but that could be normal for all I know."
TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,submissivehealer,1 point,Sat Jul 4 18:23:04 2015 UTC,"The cost is 16 gold per day, per pearl. So for four pearled players, it would take a stack of gold ingots a day."

TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,uselessdoodler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 15:56:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I second that. Frankly, it's impossible to stay out of conflict. If you give refuge to someone being sought by another country, that's already breaking neutrality. I think a U.N. would be a good idea, so we could look at every conflict individually."

TheRealmsMC,3c3mxf,uselessdoodler,1 point,Sat Jul 4 16:34:21 2015 UTC,"Well, you could impose sanctions, right? Not sure how effective that would be, but biome-exclusivity can cut some nations off from resources. You could also make a U.N. task force, or something like that."

TheRealmsMC,3c2ylb,KortexVortex,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:24:10 2015 UTC,"we announced the attack and even did it at a time where they could counter the attack   The Mikoto member facinglol overheard the plans of of the attack and decided to alert the nation. You even admitted in teamspeak that you didn't realize that he was listening. I was told and then I hurried to Mikoto as fast as I could to see if I could help defend. They had two members on compared to Novigrad's five. As far is attacking at night. That is the time when a lot of their members were on so of course that's when we take action.    ItsCookie wouldn't even 1vs1 one of us, he just kept running.   I was supposed to fight a person that is decent at PvP and equipped with a gapple? That would just plain out stupid to try.    I recommend you revise the rules in the future, before you grief another person's house   This is funny coming from a person that did the same exact thing in Mikoto hours before. Unlike you we didn't slaughter all animals to only leave one behind. The damage we left is minimal and would take no more than a couple minutes to clean up.   Sad to see you go because of a  war. You honestly have the upper hand with more players and resources. You did a lot for this server with all the work you put into it. You will be missed."
TheRealmsMC,3c2ylb,KortexVortex,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:30:58 2015 UTC,"Where do you guys keep getting this fifth player from? There was only four of us raiding at the time. It was just coincidental, that allliiisonnn logged on while we were on our way to Mikoto. She didn't even get involved.  Not all our members had gapples and there was only three of us who could actually PvP. NerdOctopus was simply along for the ride, since you were at his place taunting him.  The only animal, that there was one left, was a donkey and that was unintentional. You guys purposely left pillars of dirt and holes in my floor and don't try telling me you didn't kill anything, you pillared up to my Iron Golem farm and killed at least 14 of my 16 villagers. I'm not upset you killed them, but don't try making it seem like you didn't kill anything. You also popped chests and let items despawn, we didn't do that to you."
TheRealmsMC,3c2ylb,KortexVortex,3,Sat Jul 4 23:04:40 2015 UTC,In that case it was 4v3 with veggie and facing not ready for a fight . Why would we fight that. You guys also left 1 rabbit and stole the head of a statue. The pillars of dirt and holes in the floor were so we could go between floors. It makes more sense to break stone reinforced floors than a emerald reinforced trap door. It literally took a entire 2 minutes for me to clean it up. You're acting like we tore down your buildings. Please stop acting like the victim when you initiated this conflict. I am so sorry we didn't play the game by Rident standards.

TheRealmsMC,3c2ylb,The_Zantid,0,Sun Jul 5 01:43:39 2015 UTC,He felt threaten by ItsCookie and he wished to aid us in the attack.
TheRealmsMC,3c2ylb,NOTredtao,0,Sun Jul 5 01:51:11 2015 UTC,Then why not go after Cookie? No reason for him to attack Mikoto
TheRealmsMC,3c2ylb,InsanePigeon,0,Sun Jul 5 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"Again, let's be honest, Cookie is still apart of Mikoto. He even admitted, that he would help defend you guys, if you were attacked."

TheRealmsMC,3c2c9f,Curlysnail,1 point,Sat Jul 4 11:28:57 2015 UTC,"lol WW1 was before my time. For an actual overview - this was from Dnessen:   Basically Britania attacked Erebos, using the Gods event that was going on as a way to ""Rp"" the attack, then suddenly Tiny was trying to force the people of Erebos off their island, Zantid went rp and was trying to free Yusheng, then Mikoto was hired by some follower of Erebos to enact revenge on Twist for giving a guilty verdict, and they wont release him until he denounces Lux and followers Erebos. Which is mostly CookieMonster doing this.   To add to it: Twist and others agreed to worship Erebos in return for their freedom. Salinas crown was given to Kypore. Rident was like ""Guys stop bullying the most peaceful nation"" and waged war on Mikoto (though mainly on Cookie to try and have him serve endtime for his crimes). Mikoto then raided Rident when he was offline.      I think that covers the basics.. OH! ""And Fulgur peeps chilled out in the mountain with beer"""

As a believer in Erebos I can say that RP wise I'm pretty certain Erebos' vengeance has been sated by now; but it's up to whoever ""hired"" Mikoto to make that judgement I guess.

I mentioned it to Zantid, since we were on skype together. I went onto the test server to try to replicate it with no such luck.     I have to know what causes it to be able to fix it, and even then there is a chance I still couldn't fix it. The drama went down at Wednesday. I was asleep and then at work. No time to even think about fixing it. Zantid was at work. How was he supposed to fix it? The other moderators didn't even find out until the morning.    It's barely been a day since we found out, and we've been quite busy. Can't get a fix that quickly."

In fact a bit of drama here or there is great, it keeps people interested, gives them something to read (Lets admit it.. we all LOVE reading a bit of drama and forming our own opinions on it and then discussing it down the pub after a few pints)."

TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,NaarbSmokin,6,Thu Jul 2 18:48:06 2015 UTC,"But you miss the point that this would have never happened on CivEx. Tiny and Britania went on a religious war. Be it right or not that is RP. What would Britania, arguably the most powerful nation on the server, gain from the land? Nothing? Damn right."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Curlysnail,4,Thu Jul 2 19:04:27 2015 UTC,"I actually found the response to be identical to conflicts in CivEx.  People immediately dropped RP and starting taking things personally.  Admins got involved and picked sides.  Some people took it as a chance to cause chaos, others wanted to get revenge for something.  People left.    Yea, same old same old."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,TinyEmperor,3,Thu Jul 2 19:46:10 2015 UTC,"Fair point, I was refering to the begining of the conflict. From an RP standpoint I condem the conflict, when in reality I think it was a good RP situation and that is why I prefer this server."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Curlysnail,2,Thu Jul 2 19:59:09 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure how to respond to half of this thread. Most of it is Tiny throwing around posts of old and calling me names. The other half is people trying to have a semi discussions, and then you have people chiming in who have either shown no interest in playing on the server, or don't play on the server lol.   I guess to even attempt to dissect that will merely cause those people to yell and stamp their feet even more about the situation - if people wish to read exactly what was going through my mind at the time of this entire thing then they're free to read the post I made. I'll make one thing very clear however: Even if it wasn't Erebos, I'd have 90% for certain done the exact same course of actions. And for those of you who have either 1) been given aid out of my own personal stuff in times of need, or 2) Actually had interaction with the Admin team via modmail or any sort of like... I'd hope those two groups of people would very much know my ""Help people"" attitude.  (You can also look to my past actions as well, when it has come to the Aid of those who have been attacked by Raiders. When Andrema was picking people off on the southerncontinent - I instantly picked up my stuff when I found out and went looking for the chest containing the pearls of innocent bystanders. Or my pearling of PoisonedPig when I caught him raiding a Britannia Store house. Or when I was on my way back from mining and saw Cookiemonster and a few people from britannia camping a raiders log out position in the middle of the ocean, I offered them my sword and help if they required it. I was passing by, and they had been attacked by a raider, ""Turning the other cheek"" is not something anyone should do. ""For Evil to succeed all it takes is for good men to do nothing"")      With that out of the way..      Realms != CivEx.   If people want to play CivEx go for it. If people want to play Realms go for it. If people want to play both go for it. But I have said before, the Realms is a very different server, ran differently, with different goals and different intent than CivEx.   I'm not going to sit here and bash some of the CivEx admin staff, because that's really not necessary. This ""Us or them"" attitude from everyone seems so.. barbaric :(   I personally will never log into CivEx ever again, even with 2.0; but that's because my issues are with the Admin team who sat and defended Nerdchops and Personthatisreals actions via Modmail and told me they wouldn't do anything about it. (Apart from you Defmork, you know you're my favourite ;) )   But that is my personal opinion, and does not reflect anyone else, and if people want to sign into CivEx let them. CivEx is chaos. It's Raiders. and it's ""CivCraft"" just with different players :P   Realms is more RP, more lore based, and that will be even more evident when we finish up the Gods event and you've seen the type of ""events"" we'll be having in the future.  Is it possible to enjoy both? Yes, very likely. But the fanboying (from both sides) can become pretty hard and doesn't do anyone favours and just makes everyone look like an ass.   People can play both, people can play one or the other, or people can play none. It's like saying ""You can only play Skyrim and not Fallout"" or vice versa. Well.. why can't someone enjoy both for different reasons?   With that aside. We have the God event to finish up when people calm down and people take their fingers off the trigger (Is their a sword version of that? :S). That'll give you all plenty of new stuff to kill that you've not encountered yet ;) (Along with offering various possibilities for more player vs player interaction (not necessarily ""I'll kill you"" - to me PvP can be done via manipulating markets, or trade, or propaganda)"
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,The_Zantid,2,Thu Jul 2 21:19:29 2015 UTC,"Tatis never said that he was going to CivEx. Also, the new version isnt going to change much as far as servers, since they're already running out of hype. Also, Zantid was being a player at the time that he killed you, he was defending his God that Britanians were trying to suppress. If you honestly think that CivEx 2.0 is going to be any better, you're a fool, since all the tensions from 1.0 will carry over.    Also, there is a large amount of players who werent from CivEx, so I'm not worried about that, I mean take Rident for example, he was banned under false pretenses and have yet to unban him, for 2 months, so if you want to go to a server that is that cancerous, be my guest. I'd rather stay here, where the admins arent breaking my armor, sending my cords to other players, spawning dragons, and banning people from the reddit for posting things that cast the staff in a negative light."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,5,Thu Jul 2 18:56:42 2015 UTC,banning people from the reddit for posting things that cast the staff in a negative light.   hahaha. I made a post a while back full of the most toxic bullshit against the admins and it wasn't banned

TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,5,Thu Jul 2 20:22:50 2015 UTC,He was recently deprived of most of his mod rights and privileges due to this and the dragon controversy.
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Defmork,2,Thu Jul 2 20:39:40 2015 UTC,"Yes, I've read that, and I posted the other admins response to GAG's actions, saying it wouldn't be dismissed. He was also involved in the dragonspawning controversy the most, so you shouldn't necessarily tar all the admins with the same brush."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,novov,1 point,Thu Jul 2 20:25:26 2015 UTC,"Not that I like bringing stuff over, but nothing is really carrying over so far. Hell, LionHeart is teaming with some Feds-Wyck people, I've personally no plans to pursue any wars with them; and the server is taking on a house / clan / knight vibe to it. So saying its going to be the same, or transgressions carried over, I'd think   would be false."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,GetNGoingV-1,0,Thu Jul 2 19:03:34 2015 UTC,"There will always be the unconscious bias, the admins will still be the same, a new map changes nothing. I mean, honestly Robby will still want you, Faer, and Bliss dead. Things wont change, and plus if I remember Person threatened that if he was ever banned spawnerco would get let loose on CivEx"
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,4,Thu Jul 2 19:11:25 2015 UTC,"Of course there will be, but we've shown on realms / and other servers that we can mostly be civil with each other and whatnot, I personally think everyone will just kinda leave everyone alone for a long while, at least. And I can't argue the admin thing, though they seem to be slowly getting better about being organized, in addition with Mbach getting more time on his hands.   As for SpawnerCo, can't say much other than Person really hasn't talked about him / them and CivilEx, so I kinda assume they're dicking off somewhere else."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,GetNGoingV-1,2,Thu Jul 2 19:17:39 2015 UTC,"For the spawnerCo part, what better time to hit a server than when it's vulnerable with a new map, he did this when civex first started off, so I wouldn't be surprised if they're off biding they're time, since as we've seen. Person can hold a grudge for a very long time."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,-3,Thu Jul 2 19:21:15 2015 UTC,"Tatis only told Britannia his actual intent, which is to probably follow me back to CivEx.    You are completely right, some of the admins abused their power in CivEx.  I left CivEx because of that.    However, at the first nation-on-nation (one-sided) conflict - Zantid lies and sneak attacks BEFORE publicly announcing that he is leaving his admin-neutrality that he officially announced as part of server creation?    Better to admit to have issues than to be free to rewrite your own rules on a whim.  Also, CivEx actually allows more moderators to join and the possibility of a moderator to get overruled."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,TinyEmperor,4,Thu Jul 2 19:14:57 2015 UTC,"How did Zantid lie ? Does he not have the right to be a player ? He might be a developer, but all that does is keep the server running with new things. Also, the last part is bringing up personal information about Zantid, so you my want to redact that."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:19:29 2015 UTC,"The lies part involved him claiming innocence in-game before striking.    As for his rights...    From the introduction of the server staff     To stay as unbiased as possible, they - although allowed to play and build in the world - cannot join a nation, participate in politics, or refuse to sell to particular players    That statement alone sold me on the Realms.  There are servers where admins player and servers where admins don't play.  I prefer the second, but understand the balance struck by Zantid's statement.  This would allow the nations to interact without worrying about the admins from coming down from upon high and and getting messed up in things.    Is Zantid free to change that?  Of course he is, it's his server.  He can totally make the change that allows admins to get involved.  Am I allowed to be upset about it?  I would hope so.  And I allowed to be upset that he acted first and spoke second?  Damn right I would think.    Also: Advice taken, thank you."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,TinyEmperor,2,Thu Jul 2 19:27:30 2015 UTC,"He wasnt involved in politics, theres a difference between roleplay and politics. He felt from a roleplay stand point that his God was in danger of being suppressed, so he reacted, while as a player, not in gamemode as someone from CivEx would do."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,3,Thu Jul 2 19:31:46 2015 UTC,"Though, he shouldn't have gotten involved at all. If you honestly believe he'd do that if it was another nation other than Erebos, you're kidding yourself. I consider that biased.   I like Zantid for the most part, seems like a cool dude and works hard, but saying what he did was just because of RP is ridiculous."

TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,0,Thu Jul 2 19:43:41 2015 UTC,"Actually it seemed less of against a nation, and more of against you, people just got in his way. If it wasnt Zantid, then it would have been Cookiemonster, or another nation that I know could easily have put Britania down, this was just Britania trying to flex their muscles after the whole Hippo incident that made them look weak. And since it failed, you might as well start trying to push the severity of how people reacted to it onto others. Zantid literally was Roleplaying as a follower of Erebos, while you decided to roleplay as someone who was out to destroy the God, so of course he's going to do this."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,TinyEmperor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:51:18 2015 UTC,"I'm afraid you missed the point entirely.  I am unhappy about Zantid's choices (and his accusations about me, but that's not here or now)    I don't even know what Hippo has to do with it. You've completely lost me with your train of thought."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,Dnessen,1 point,Thu Jul 2 19:55:13 2015 UTC,"If you want to know what will fix the problems yesterday, then look at the people who claim that they are leaving the server, yet they stay on the reddit just to sit there, causing shit, those people need to leave."
TheRealmsMC,3bwhef,NerdOctopus,6,Thu Jul 2 19:54:57 2015 UTC,"Then let them leave, ignore TinyEmperor's posts for the time being because there's not really much for him to do until CivEx actually starts up again.  I mainly want this to be a discussion about how to go from here instead of pointing 11 fingers (you've only got 10 if you're human) at people for the burden of the blame.   As far as I know those who have no interest in improving the server should just get out of this discussion."

Also: Is worshipping Erebos a crime? If so then all of Astronomica is a criminal enterprise per Britannia law and we should be pissing in our boots.

Whatever Tiny wants?  Anyway, I know all you did was participate in the show trial. Wish you hadn't done that. Wish Britannia hadn't done what they did.

Erebos is powerful enough to carry out his armageddon by himself, he doesn't need mortal men to commit acts of evil for him. All he requires from us is our devotion, our prayers, and our sacrifices.

TheRealmsMC,3buaxg,TinyEmperor,9,Thu Jul 2 05:21:47 2015 UTC,Can you really blame admins or mods not wanting to play the game as well? You cant really expect for them to make the server and just sit there while everyone gets to play and have fun. Specially when they put so much time into making this server and plugins for everyone to have a good time. If they honestly never get the chance to play this server as it was ment to play then how long u think it will be before they loose interest and not be around to help out? remember they are only human. Why are you saying you would not play on a server that has admins and mods who play but also say you will be on civex 2.0? no offence but you just sound salty as hell because you didn't have the upper hand in the battle so you ran away and just quit the server. This server is 100 times way better then civex and so is the admins and mods. I don't see any of them using their powers for evil. Its not like zantid flew over to you and rekt you in god mod or something lol. Or did he? Zantid! anyways hate to see a player quit over something like that. You had to know that when you come out of neutral mode and want to fight theres going be players who fight back.  Edit: lol really I got a downvote for this? ok I guess
TheRealmsMC,3buaxg,IronWolf209,3,Thu Jul 2 06:42:20 2015 UTC,"Can you really blame admins or mods not wanting to play the game as well?    Yes.  It was specifically announced that way.  It was one of the strongest differences between Realms and CivEx in my view.  With that difference removed, I choose a group of mods (CivEx) over a pair of mods with romantic attachments.    Other servers can have non-playing admins.  It's not unknown."
TheRealmsMC,3buaxg,Quasky,6,Thu Jul 2 15:59:52 2015 UTC,"I do feel bad for this whole ordeal effecting the server so. I do agree with you in some aspects, however you must understand a few points.    In regards to Zantid's intervening. He is a player. Yes a dev, and perhaps a mod, but you have to remember he wants to experience his world that was created. Depriving him of that is a bit harsh. Although he has remained silent so far, It was only a matter of time before they were going to actually become a ""living"" member of the server. Can you blame him?    Should he have ""snitched"" on the exploit? No (I think that was a little low of a blow). But I do not believe he should be chastised for his actions joining Erebos.    While dealing with Yusheng for not leaving your claimed land, can you blame him? What would you do If I gathered a group of players, came to Britannia, killed you, and said ""You have to leave, because I don't want you using the bay in Britannia. Deal with it.""    As I and others do not approve of your claims/actions, They are your own. You are responsible for those actions and their consequences. I spoke to you and asked you to retract the claims and to end this conflict.    Amist seeing as this as escalated so far; I am sad to see you go."

You chose to bring along someone who you 'can't control' which makes him just seem like a scrapegoat for whatever the hell you guys think you're accomplishing."
TheRealmsMC,3btlff,RaxusAnode,5,Thu Jul 2 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"I personally say no. With Tiny leaving the server most of Britannia will most likely follow. I know that isn't the majority of the player base, but it is a large chunk of active players. If conflict is going to tear the player base apart like this, then there is little hope for it's future."
TheRealmsMC,3btlff,HappyCrow5,3,Thu Jul 2 01:17:35 2015 UTC,"We check for one half of a split fucking second on the subreddit, and a world war is happening, one in which the owners/moderators/dev team are a part of   To pass judgement without context seems rather uncharacteristic of you :("

TheRealmsMC,3btlff,KortexVortex,4,Thu Jul 2 01:58:06 2015 UTC,"One of the things I specifically said was ""don't be CivEx"". I said this in the beginning, and I said it when you subtly started playing as moderators in addition to devs - something I had a problem with on its own, because I was told that the two moderators on hand would have the major ability to moderate. I was a firm supporter of separation of those powers to prevent the staff problems CivEx had at the time.  Now, one of the reasons I wanted to play here was because it seemed like both moderators and admins would stay clear of petty politics. It also seemed like the staff would query the community regarding additions to the server. Since AndreMa2000, the former has been turned back on, and the latter has been proven false with increasing frequency.  Now there is a war - that is to be expected on a Civ server, yes, but it's a petty war brought about because of yet another sudden staff addition.   And in addition, the smiley at the end feels similar to the appeal to emotion you used the last time we brought up advertising when you claimed we were rudely attacking you. Can we think with our brains, and not our hearts this time?   In short, I want to care about this place, but the admins have made it increasingly difficult - doing the very things I worried about before the server was live."
TheRealmsMC,3btlff,MrJay235,3,Thu Jul 2 02:26:31 2015 UTC,"It seems like this is hardly the time for this conversation considering the Drama, but I'll do my best to respond.   You have brought up the past which is very difficult, as the further time goes forward the further details get muddied, it happens in all things in life - though I'm sure a quick search would likely find the relevant posts so I won't go over the whole Andre thing.    something I had a problem with on its own, because I was told that the two moderators on hand would have the major ability to moderate   They do, there are, however, two of them. Which means, as a fact of life, not everyone can be online at all the times. Covering our bases in terms of time online has been a big help. A lot of the major issues have been related to Tech and Abusted (I'm sure there are multiple people reading who can chip in and say the times in which I've replied to their questions with a ""Hmm I'm not sure, best to ask Tech and Abusted"". Their role is moderation, and they've been doing a fantastic job at it. We couldn't have asked for two better moderators. Myself, and Megans, step in when they're busy (which generally means when they're asleep!) and I think this has been evident and helped greatly by how quickly our responses to people via modmail have been on average. When they're unable to get to a computer myself or megan can, and when we can't Tech and Abusted are right there.   A lot of what myself and Megan do on the server gets blurred rather quickly between the lines of Moderator and Dev.   ""There is a bug on the server that has eaten half your house and allowed X person to do what?""   ""Okay, let me sign in.. check where the bug is.. restore your house by rolling it back""   ""Oh and while you're here, our cows right here were fully griefed by x person""   Now we have two choices here. I can either say ""lols sorry mate, you'll have to wait the undetermined amount of time for Tech and Abusted to get online"" or I can say ""Sure let me take a look.""   In general, their fix or need for a moderator is generally something simple that really doesn't require a ""Log entry and database input along with Notes on how the issue was solved"" - and is often a 2 minute fix. To ask them to wait for a possible 3 or 6 hours (depending if Abusted or Tech have just gone to bed) for what we can personally do, without issue, in 2 minutes... is kind of unfair; and generally makes me feel like shit for ""abandoning"" a player for something that I know I could fix without issue.   Once it's fixed, what happens gets put into the hangouts we're in with Tech and Abusted and everyones sees them. for more major issues, things get put in there and everyone discusses them. Long before a decision is made - unless it's a quick decision that needs to be made (For example: Tech and Abusted are asleep. A Hacker joins the server and starts no scope headshot sniping people from across the map. Saying ""Sorry guys.. that's Tech and Abusted's role"" is hardly fair to our players).   I would hope, that those who we have helped fix and sort there issues, generally have a great ""Customer server"" moment, whether it's Megan, Myself, Tech, or abusted who are dealing with them - and I can assure you everything is spoken, discussed and relayed to the others.      If we're to turn to your comments about us getting ""too involved"" politics wise, I wish there was someone else who could chime in and actually make a comment on Myself, Megan, Abusted, and Tech's actual log in time over the last few days (in fact if I get stats working - they've been recording since.. erm.. I can't remember, and we'll be able to see individual play time). Generally.. we don't get time to play. My days consists of:   Midnight: Wake up 1am: Breakfast, Wake up, Shower. 2am: Talk to Megan as she gets home from work.  2am - 5am (3 Hours) = Modmail, Working on Plugins, Building the Event + any other personal activities like talking to friends outside of my internet existence (I know.. I have them! Honest!)  5am = Work 5pm = Home from Work 5:15pm = Fall asleep Midnight = wake up   I don't tell you that stuff for sympathy (though please, 12 hour days SUCK BALLS) I tell you to merely let you know just how little time I personally get to ""play"" the server, when most of my time is spent doing stuff ""for"" the server Admin wise (Those who have been online for the server regularly, and attest to the fact that they never see me ingame or hardly at all on the Teamspeak due to my crazy hours).   To then say that I'm getting ""too involved"" in politics, is really hardly fair, I'm not online enough to be :(     If we turn to you telling me I was emotional the last time you discussed advertisement with us.. Well I was. I can't lie about that, I was damn well emotional - because I'd worked my ass of for the server every day doing as much as I can, helping people as much as I can; and generally fixing stuff. We, as the Admin team, then made a single Advertising post on a subreddit that allows you to basically spam you post every 2 weeks. To which yourself made a rather harshly worded subreddit thread about how we'd done it wrong. How our effort to draw in players wasn't good enough, and how our post was ""evident it had been done hastily"". (or something along those lines).   Yes, I was emotional - because all I wanted to do was make a small, select few people, aware that we existed in a hope to get you guys more ""play mates"" to make nations with, wage wars with, and generally RP with. To hear that doing something we presumed was good for the server (more players) was somehow amazingly negative from you - hurt. Yes, I was emotional. I'm sure anyone would be.   We then sat and discussed it in hangouts. Had an argument. Made up. Decided on a course of action and then said ""okay guys, you really want to do it, and we're all here to make the server better and to make it great, please if you'd like to get involved go for it!""  This resulted in you guys wanting to make a video, to which we even gave fly powers to one of your friends to film the areas (Something I was strongly against when I found out, but something you two had said would be needed for the video. And the video sounded awesome).   And then we didn't hear anything for a long... long time. The hangouts went dead. Both of you went MIA, and a lot of other players messaged us via Modmail (or posted in the subreddit) of ""Oh man when are you advertising"" to which we had to respond ""Well we have people working on it!"" and that kept happening. Then we got private messages of people offering to post advertisements on our behalf because they wanted to get the word out. We had to tell them ""Sorry guys, we got some people working on it who seemed really enthused about it all and had some kick ass ideas!""      Then you guys made a post of ""Should we even bother"" - without at all attempting to contact us on Hangouts, or personal messages. After we'd turned down lots of outside help because we didn't want you two to feel offended we'd gone elsewhere, or for you to feel your opinions weren't important to us. We turned down a lot of people who wanted to help because you guys said you really wanted to do it.. and then you make a post asking if you should bother (after being gone for such a long, long period of time)   [INFO] Player MrJayElectro has been offline since 9 days 2 hours 6 minutes. [INFO] Player RaxusAnode has been offline since 10 days 8 hours 22 minutes.   Real life sucks - I know, as you can see by my work day above. So I really don't blame you or hold it against you for being gone so long. That's just a simple fact of life and internet gaming. ""Real Life comes first""  But the first thing we hear back from you guys in almost that length of time is ""whether you should bother""  It sucks."
TheRealmsMC,3btlff,The_Zantid,2,Thu Jul 2 03:07:29 2015 UTC,"With regards to the moderator vs dev issue, the point stands. They are two people, yes. Were there zero other options before you and Megans decided you needed to moderate as well? Even CivEx held applications.  But I'm not here to argue about the lack of moderation on the server. I'm here to discuss the advertising.   And then we didn't hear anything for a long... long time. The hangouts went dead. Both of you went MIA, and a lot of other players messaged us via Modmail (or posted in the subreddit) of ""Oh man when are you advertising"" to which we had to respond ""Well we have people working on it!"" and that kept happening. Then we got private messages of people offering to post advertisements on our behalf because they wanted to get the word out. We had to tell them ""Sorry guys, we got some people working on it who seemed really enthused about it all and had some kick ass ideas!   You act like we didn't give you nearly three weeks of warning. Raxus was working from 6:15 am - 8:00 pm from the beginning of June until three days ago. He warned you about this in the middle of May. I asked repeatedly for a few video clips from Megans. Due to slow response times, the usable clips we sifted through have a timestamp of June 5th. Raxus left on June 6th. I was not sent these videos until June 24th, despite asking three times and offering my email address each time (every time I saw the ad get mentioned in the Hangout, actually).   Our original goal was to have it finished by June 5th, and on July 1st we have had merely one week to even view the files, and three days to work on them. You were told this would happen if things were delayed. Much like the original advertisement that spawned this discussion, the effort simply was not there, and we didn't get the tools we needed to have to do this.   Frankly, we thought you had given up on the advertisement. Despite the queries in the Hangout, your actions did not reflect any solid desire to advertise with us. Between Rax's absence, my new hours, and the apparent lack of commitment, we slowly lost interest in playing. The numbers were dwindling and we were not given the aid to fix it. We did not want to put more love into a server that the leadership did not seem to want to revitalize, besides the lip service in the chat.  That's not saying that we aren't going to do it. We won't be the ones put to blame if the server dies - that will be solely on you.  Our question still stands - is there any point in doing this advertisement? The server seems to be in shambles. Britannia - a staple of the server - more or less quit. The playerbase seems to be torn. You said yourself that the moderation team is bare-bones and has little time to work on this. Is it worth the effort?"

TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Skolanthropy,4,Thu Jul 2 02:30:31 2015 UTC,"Why have RP at all if IC actions don't bring IC consequences? I don't think anybody needs to be perma pearled or have their things totally torn down, but the world reacts to events. Erebos threatens the land and we aren't allowed to deal with his cultists or their land. What are we supposed do then? Sit on our hands knowing that evil walks the earth and we can't fight it for arbitrary reasons? Could there not be some sort of compromise where Yush is held for a few days and released a little worse for the wear, his church boarded up and slightly damaged after the raid against Erebos?  Please draw line between RP and being mean, otherwise this sort of situation is going to happen again and people aren't going to risk reacting at all."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,fin600,8,Thu Jul 2 01:21:04 2015 UTC,"Yusheng poured himself into construction, typing up lore, and worked really hard building this religion. A reaction anything along those lines would have been great. Or diplomacy. Or at the very least some sort of communication.   I'd hope that our toolbox for ""reactions"" is not limited to violence."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Skolanthropy,-3,Thu Jul 2 02:26:38 2015 UTC,"He built up an 'evil' religion though, a religion now being taken as a serious threat. Of course it's met with violence. Diplomacy was had with 2/3 of the major other religions present and they wanted this new 'evil' religion purged. That's a natural response. Not everything can be flowers and cupcakes all the time."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,fin600,7,Thu Jul 2 03:08:05 2015 UTC,"So wait wait wait. Let me get this straight. ""Diplomacy"" is when all of the allies talk together without talking to the ones they have disagreements with?  No wonder the shit has hit the fan."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Skolanthropy,-2,Thu Jul 2 03:12:13 2015 UTC,They had a trial about whatever misgivings they had. Is that not diplomacy? I do agree Tiny going back to pearl him again after was a bit much.
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,fin600,5,Thu Jul 2 03:16:56 2015 UTC,A trial is not diplomacy.
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Skolanthropy,3,Thu Jul 2 03:26:19 2015 UTC,"I don't know if you were there for the trial, but there was absolutely no meaningful discussion there. It basically consisted of the judges saying what they believed was wrong and then them saying yosheng was guilty. Yosheng spent the entire thing caps locking about erebos. Calling that diplomacy would be a stretch"
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Schmiggety,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:39:10 2015 UTC,"It seemed pretty hastily done just from the reddit post, but really. A cultist is convicted of heresy and put to 'death' in a pearl for a little while britannia roughs up and condemns the church (definitely not annihilating it..). That's what should have been done and then ended at. Tiny going back and Erebos hiring goons after the judges and their nations is much. Yush acts like any and all punishment for RP is a crime in and of itself."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,fin600,1 point,Thu Jul 2 04:48:54 2015 UTC,"I agree. This should have stopped a long time ago.  However, to my knowledge, it isnt the nation of Erebos hiring people to hunt the judges. Its somebody going around in the name of the god Erebos. Yusheng and his nation are not necessarily affiliated. The god Erebos has many more followers than the nation has members. I feel like many people are having misconceptions here and pointing fingers where they don't belong. Naurally, this doesnt make either side in the right. Both sides here have been going way overboard and need to stop."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Schmiggety,1 point,Thu Jul 2 05:11:57 2015 UTC,"It'd probably help if Yush's nation wasn't also named Erebos, just like the god and the religion."
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,fin600,0,Thu Jul 2 05:13:59 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Only hazardpike and yusheng are members of the nation, while the religion had like 11+ followers last time I looked. Its an easy mistake to make"
TheRealmsMC,3btgrx,Schmiggety,2,Thu Jul 2 05:16:02 2015 UTC,"One of the things you said clicks with me; I do not support the victim-blaming sentiment of saying you can freely ""annex someone's land because they are too weak/poor to protect it"". While of course you can do that, I've seen it on many instances be used to support imperialistic actions, acting as some sort of viable casus belli when in reality it is not. Of course it is a political server and if a group is powerful enough to take over another than of course it will happen, but repeating the quoted statement above any time such a battle breaks out does not inspire good politics or fun on the server.  This isn't really talking about any specific instance here, but I'd just like to point that out before any small nation falls victim to such a warfare culture on the server that is inspired by that idea."

TheRealmsMC,3btxzc,TinyEmperor,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:12:18 2015 UTC,"I wanted to role play as a member of a nation that was going to stamp out evil cultists and then valiantly try to secure the evil altar from them while the God event was going on.  Hence the attack, the trial, and the claim.    I caught flak for being a large nation attacking a smaller one. Yea, expected it. Had people try to backstab me. Expected that too.  I've been in CivEx, I know the backlash.    Found out an admin was upset for messing with his God event enough for him to get involved in nation politics. Did not expect that.  Had him call me a rule breaker while not speaking as a moderator. Totally didn't expect that. Had him pull out private chats of shit that he didn't feel the need to tell me about before.  At that point, I've given up.    After that, people started acting irrational.  Cookiemonster goes on a rampage. Mikoto attacks salinas. Clearly this nation to nation conflict is bigger than we thought."
TheRealmsMC,3btxzc,Amodii,1 point,Thu Jul 2 03:19:35 2015 UTC,This entire conflict deeply reminds me of how World War 1 started. Infact i think its incredibly similar
TheRealmsMC,3buimu,NOTredtao,3,Thu Jul 2 06:55:53 2015 UTC,"While I agree there was an overreaction to the RP war, I also think diplomacy could've been used first."
TheRealmsMC,3buimu,Arpeggias,4,Thu Jul 2 07:30:35 2015 UTC,"Yes Hello. No.     TinyEmperor played this conflict to see if you guys can have a proper RP war.     Alright, RP war. Now you can't get mad when we will retaliate against you. Not just Erebos, Everyone. Quite a few people are not happy with the way this was taken."
TheRealmsMC,3buimu,Quasky,2,Thu Jul 2 07:54:24 2015 UTC,"For real. This was handled in probably the worst way possible. Any ammount of communication would have gone so far. Maybe doing something like messaging beforehand and asking if this kind of thing is okay.   If you go and ambush somebody and annex all of their land, getting mad when nobody agrees with what you did is so absurd. RP is fine if everybody involved is having fun. The moment RP means preventing somebody from playing the game is the moment it stops being RP and starts being bullying.   Tiny could have taken many steps to ensure that this would be a proper RP war, but didnt take any of them."

On one hand they did RP as a shadow nation destined to inherit the earth, but does that justify attacking them as if they actually followed through on those intentions and started attacking other people?  I don't know what would have been wrong with the Brits posting an ultimatum, it's not like a nation of their size requires the element of surprise..."

Foul creatures.    STEPPING OUT OF CHARACTER    Seriously, what did you expect?  That people would happily love a group of guys that keep posting stuff about ending the world in darkness and all that?  That they would happily let slide large claims made by two people?  That all nations are required to talk and talk and talk on reddit first?  I'd find you woefully naive, except for the following post:    As you said about your claims, ""As an added benefit, it took a quiet message board and added some spice to it.""    You wanted spice, you got the spice.    Also, we didn't touch your chests and are letting you take your stuff with you.  We just want the altar.  That a whole lot better than typical annexations on the other civilization servers.  Normally, you'd find yourself stuck in the end while people steal everything you own.  Not trying to rub it in.  I'm just trying to show you that we are restricting this to RP and not your wealth."
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,TinyEmperor,4,Wed Jul 1 18:04:57 2015 UTC,"No screw that, I thought it would be fun to make a wild claim and not up hold it. those lands are still empty and we have no intentions of moving in on them. further more, I refuse to leave my lands. the two of us have built a great deal. This is utter crap. and from a role play stance all we really do and by we i mean ""I"", post little bits of story. so if your claiming to be so straight forward and annex land just because of stupid claim"
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,InsanePigeon,-1,Wed Jul 1 18:09:14 2015 UTC,You don't have to leave your lands. Being protectorate of Britannia actually won't change anything. You don't have to pay taxes to us.

TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,KortexVortex,3,Wed Jul 1 18:19:12 2015 UTC,Killing players and taking their things is not griefing. It's called raiding.
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,TinyEmperor,2,Wed Jul 1 18:29:02 2015 UTC,"No, I'm saying that he ""thought it would be fun"" to make a claim and is now upset about people taking it seriously.    And killing other players and taking their things is fine as long as you aren't only on the server to do only those things.  This isn't a peaceful server"
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,Schmiggety,6,Wed Jul 1 18:21:43 2015 UTC,"I know this is not a peaceful server, however there are still limits and an extensive section of the rules to define them.  Taken straight from the rules:  No griefing alters  and No griefing - Griefing is considered anything that destroys players design.  I believe I saw you specifically mention something about taking hte altar. Additionally, I'm not sure what could destroy a players design any more than taking literally all of their property"
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,TinyEmperor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:06 2015 UTC,"If the server punishes me for taking someone's land, then the whole idea of nations is right out and we're just playing a creative server.    We didn't touch anything while we were there other than kill Yusheng.  We aren't planning on destroying the buildings, and are giving them plenty of time to take their treasure.  How much nicer can we be and still call this a conflict?"
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,Schmiggety,4,Wed Jul 1 18:33:02 2015 UTC,"You could perhaps just not take the land. Or maybe just take the desert that seems to have got so many people upset. I understand that this is a nations things, but that doesn't mean you should go around bullying people for adding flavor text to it. Just because you can do something, doesn't mean you should. Even if this is within the rules of the server, people are still going to be upset about it. It's a shitty thing to have happen to you. Suppose some overwhelming force came and took all of Britannia away from you? I'm sure you wouldn't be to happy about it either. That would be a bit excessive, just as your actions here are a bit excessive."
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,TinyEmperor,-2,Wed Jul 1 18:42:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying they should be happy.  I just believe I didn't break the rules of the server.    Also, this ain't about the land.  We wanted the cultists tried, sentenced if guilty, and to drive them from their evil altar.    If you consider this bullying, I'm afraid you may be disappointed in the future."
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,Schmiggety,2,Wed Jul 1 18:45:18 2015 UTC,"If it isn't about land, then why take it?"
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,NerdOctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:48:21 2015 UTC,Couldn't you have just asked them to give up most or all of the claims?  Surely they would have complied?
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,TinyEmperor,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:34:30 2015 UTC,"From a RP standpoint, Britannia could no longer and watch evil cultists bring about the end of the world.  You missed the world events yesterday that indicated the start of that.    This ain't CivEx, nations do things for more than just additional land and treasure.  :)"
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,NerdOctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:39:47 2015 UTC,"I got the RP reasons, no worries there.  I just think pure RP isn't acceptable for attacking someone who stays to themselves.  Just my opinion."
TheRealmsMC,3brx1w,InsanePigeon,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:49:59 2015 UTC,I have a solution. We take away a part of your empty territory and you can keep your city and everything else.

Though Andre did actually kill people, he claimed it was all in good fun and RP. You've publicly announced that your god encourages the killing of other nations, so I don't see what's wrong with the Erebos Massacre.

TheRealmsMC,3brqxx,KortexVortex,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:07:04 2015 UTC,No one disputed Erebos land claims. They just talk in secret and attack by suprise.

TheRealmsMC,3brqxx,KortexVortex,1 point,Wed Jul 1 17:15:42 2015 UTC,Sorry. Maybe I didn't pay attention long enough. I didn't realize there was such a verbal protest. I guess I just don't understand why this wasn't handled diplomatically and not by surpise attack. Don't mean to obfuscate events.
TheRealmsMC,3brqxx,Skolanthropy,3,Wed Jul 1 17:31:29 2015 UTC,Consider them disputed.    A claim without warning begets a dispute without warning.  Never assume a post made to a subreddit somehow carries weight based on the replies or lack of.  The truth only lies within the game.

TheRealmsMC,3bqquq,GiantCarrotMan,1 point,Wed Jul 1 14:38:06 2015 UTC,Enderpearls all the way. Another reason is players who are committed to this server will always have more than raiders because of their extended time to gather.   Make the anvil recipe more efficient. Encourage factory mod use.

I mean your nation might not like it but let's not play this meta wise.  If you don't like it denounce the nation, don't do trade with them. Set embargoes or some shit"

TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,CptChaos3201,4,Wed Jul 1 19:32:48 2015 UTC,"I understand what you are saying. But does this mean we should pearl everyone new to the server for they might ""declare holy war"" in the future? Why dont we just wipe out all the small nations for they could ""claim more unnecessary  land"" in the future? Why don't we raze the forests for the resources there could be turned into weapons?

TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,NerdOctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:44:10 2015 UTC,"If they worship a god and claim that their god should wipe out all the nonbelievers, then yes, I do believe we should show them the errors of their ways.  And if a nation claims land that's too big for the size of their nation, yes I do believe we should inform them about it. Mikoto has one of the smallest claims, is one of the bigger nations, and has been on the server for one of longest times and have still yet to use all out land and we are quite developed too. I've never been a fan of massive claims if there is no need for them."

TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,NerdOctopus,1 point,Wed Jul 1 19:21:27 2015 UTC,This is only going to limit the amount of RP that happens on the server when everyone has to analyze the stories they make for potential causes for war by others.
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,TinyEmperor,2,Wed Jul 1 18:56:28 2015 UTC,"I doubt you could.  RP is a dangerous thing, you could say that Britannia was RPing the attack. If you want to RP as a villainous group, then you should be willing to face the ""heroes""."
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,HappyCrow5,0,Wed Jul 1 19:00:44 2015 UTC,"Disclaimer: this is the opinion of myself, not of Estercrest nor any of its other inhabitants lol"
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,NerdOctopus,5,Wed Jul 1 18:47:09 2015 UTC,"This is my biggest hang-up:  couldn't Britannia just have told them to give up the claims?  They almost certainly would have complied, and that seems to be the only real reason to attack them, unless you count the gods plug-in which feels flimsy at best."
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,NerdOctopus,4,Wed Jul 1 18:36:55 2015 UTC,"Many players were upset with the land claims when they first happened, and they didn't say anything about giving them up. They claim that since they didn't make a follow up post about it, that that proves they didn't want the land anymore, which is ridiculous to believe"
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,NerdOctopus,2,Wed Jul 1 18:40:16 2015 UTC,"What if Britannia isn't in it for the land?  What if we did it because of RP reasons?  You've got evil cultists and world events indicating that they might be successful.    Seriously, let's not descend into CivEx.  We didn't even pop their chests."
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,NerdOctopus,2,Wed Jul 1 18:41:57 2015 UTC,To my knowledge no one in Britannia wishes the players from Erebos any ill will. I even offered to personally replace he items that were lost in our attack. I have no desire to see anyone leave the server. I will however continue to roleplay even if that leads me into conflict with others.
TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,aposii,2,Wed Jul 1 18:44:16 2015 UTC,"If it's just for RP reasons, I feel it's even worse.  I feel that by having this discussion we haven't descended to any sort of chaotic civcraft stuff.  But isn't the latter the server that's all about attacking others?  I feel like attacking me would have been more reasonable than this.  I don't know, I guess I'm trying to say actions speak louder than words, and I didn't see any sort of terrible earth-shattering action with these guys."

TheRealmsMC,3bs49r,ArsenalOwl,1 point,Wed Jul 1 21:22:10 2015 UTC,"If you have to put limits on RPing, then what's the point of it? Because a nation is bigger it's not allowed to RP a war against a smaller nation? Get out of here."

TheRealmsMC,3bn4fj,Curlysnail,2,Tue Jun 30 15:37:42 2015 UTC,"Incase you can't be bothered to follow two links ;)     The Twin Crown of the United Hanaqi States   A state is governed by the Cumulonimbus. The Cumulonimbus has the following powers:    -May run the state as they see fit -May freely build and order to build anything in the state without prior King consent -May recruit people into their state (as a member of Hanaq) -May trade and invest for the benifit of the state -May have a state army -May declare war on another nation*    The Twin Crown may over rule the Cumulonimbus if they do not agree with the state. The Twin Crown ALWAYS has this power.     The Cumulonibus is NOT allowed to:    -Expand the state borders**  .Not into Hanaq territory  .Not into unclaimed territory  .Not into existing territory    -Declare war on another state -Merge with another state -Create another state -Become free from the Twin Crown -Opt out of a nation widewar***    As always the Twin Crown always has the power to halt any wrong doing. Any Cumulonimbus suspected of breaking any rules declared here or going against the Twin Crown will be removed.    *A state may declare war on another nation however this does not mean the Twin Crown will agree. If the Twin Crown feels the need to stop a war the Twin Crown will act. Inaction from the Twin Crown DOES NOT mean we support the war. States may ally and side with other states in a war.  **Expansion of Hanaqi borders is a power reserved to the Twin Crown. Should a state wish to expand, they may contact the Twin Crown.  ***This will be covered below  =WAR=    Aside from a war between State and Country there are two types of war the Twin Crown will be in.     ""Small war""   A Small war is where co-operation of a States army is not required in the war effort. The Twin Crown is  alowed to take resources for the war effort as it would anyway. The Twin Crown may require a certain State to enter a war, in this instance a State may not refuse however this is likely a rare circumstance. States may join if they wish, though are not required.   ""Nationwide war""   A Nationwide war requires all States to help during the war effort. The States army and resources will be required. Participation is not optional.  =Resources & Labour=   For the most part States have full controll over their resources and labour. States and their members are however expected to help Hanaq in any way they are required, though usually this is just by helping the State."

Since your claim would've been essentially adding to an existing nation, it isn't eligible.  As such, my offer mostly extends to new players who wish for a central location on the map."

TheRealmsMC,3bjdam,NerdOctopus,3,Mon Jun 29 18:55:40 2015 UTC,Brauden needs to recognize it can't horde all that land and not do anything with it.  I dislike the idea that he's reserving that huge swath of land saying that big thibgs are a-comin'.

An inactive player with an inactive nation three times the size of a decently active and populated nation doesn't want to give up an unused area in the corner that is probably about 1/15 of his land, the vast majority of which also isn't built on, and what little construction there is isn't remotely near the claim in question?

TheRealmsMC,3bcf8t,NerdOctopus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:17:43 2015 UTC,"As long as it is just the farm, that's acceptable, but it would have been extremely easy to message me beforehand to ask whether that would be okay.  I would ask that you pay me for the segment you take, however."
TheRealmsMC,3bcf8t,_Rosseau_,3,Sat Jun 27 23:28:12 2015 UTC,"The farm has been there for a month, and for you not to notice it in your land is a sign that you need to limit your claim."
TheRealmsMC,3bcf8t,NerdOctopus,1 point,Sat Jun 27 23:43:17 2015 UTC,"Following that logic, if I were able to hide farms and mines in your claim, would you then cede that land to me?  I doubt it.  I understand the hard work you put into the land, and don't disparage it, but I have to admit at the very least I feel slighted that I wasn't asked beforehand.  If I were to set a precedent by giving this land away for free, then everyone would get the idea, whether true or not, that they could develop any project they want on my land and then claim it as their own since they had existing structures there.  I of course don't want such a notion to exist, and as such, an exchange must be made.  I hope this makes it clearer I have no intentions of destroying your work."
TheRealmsMC,3bcf8t,NerdOctopus,2,Sat Jun 27 23:48:38 2015 UTC,"Well, it isn't exactly hidden...  And it's a free use international farm too..."

The farm was part of the reasoning behind the claim, but if it's for everyone, I don't see the need to claim the land around it."
TheRealmsMC,3bcf8t,Ehini,2,Sat Jun 27 23:57:48 2015 UTC,"So then we can make bigger private farms, hanaqi administered roadways, hanaqi administered canals etc."

TheRealmsMC,3bcf8t,NerdOctopus,-1,Sun Jun 28 00:18:01 2015 UTC,"And what if I were to build it underground?  The point being you seem to be trying to enforce more a more aggressive de facto claim rather than de jure, which is disappointing to say the least."

TheRealmsMC,3azvqt,TwistTheCat,5,Wed Jun 24 22:19:48 2015 UTC,"More teamwork recipes - like how cannons require blacksmiths and engineers.  Maybe make them cheap, since there's plenty of really expensive things already out there. Examples:    Farmers + Researchers can create a version of wheat (maybe from hay) that drastically improves the breeding rate of animals (does not help ones at 0%)  The Researcher can create it from hay bales and the farmer is the only one that can use it.    Farmers + Alchemists can create a version of bonemeal (maybe from 9 bonemeal) that actually works on all plants. But only if the growth percentage is not 0%.    Engineers + Researchers can make improved rail lines that use something other than iron or less iron.  Researcher craft them and engineers lay them.    Give farmers an improved fishing treasure chance.  In fact, anything you want to use for a fisherman profession, just put in farmer.    Since we now have unique mobs with rare and unique drops, how about a ""soldier"" or ""guard"" profession that gets a small bonus to mob drops?  Say 5% at first going up to double drops by level 30?    Two words: Splash Alcohol.    Provide a speed boost to horses on cobble/stone/etc to actually make roads special.  Or a special block with that effect to be put into roads.    SubAirShip and SubAirSkiff.  It's in vanilla Movecraft.  A man can dream, right?

TheRealmsMC,3aws2r,submissivehealer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:44:37 2015 UTC,Pretty much. I'm sure a handful of nations would love for you to join them :)
TheRealmsMC,3aws2r,submissivehealer,1 point,Wed Jun 24 03:51:59 2015 UTC,"Hey there! :D I recommend grabbing voxel map first and foremost. On a server like this, knowing where you are is super crucial.    To download voxelmap, you'll need LiteLoader. After you install it, you should see a mods folder in your .minecraft folder. Here, you'll place the voxelmap (remember to grab the 1.8 version - won't work otherwise). Restart your game, and the next time you go on a server, you'll see a minimap in your top right corner. :) It's fairly customizable, but amazing to have. You can compare it with the 3-D map to figure out where you are.    The server limits chat range to a 500 block radius from where you stand. It will tell you if there's no one nearby. Even if you can't talk in the global chat, you can still /msg someone privately. I know that if I'm ever on the server, you can always shoot me a message asking for help. :D    As for the first things to do in terms of gameplay, when you actually get on the server ... I would do something similar to what Br1tt said, and explore the rest of Spera and see and meet people. Maybe spend a few days as a nomad until you find someplace you just know you were meant to build in, or people that you just get the right vibe from. :) The world is absolutely huge and there are some incredible views (espeeeeecially if you have shaders <3).         There are several unique elements to the server that are good to know, too (if you haven't checked out the tutorials on new game mechanics, I'd recommend checking them out here ).     To protect blocks, we use a program called citadel, which basically allows you to reinforce a block with an ore/jewel/stone, each item giving it's own level of protection. This means that if someone wants to break your chest, and you have reinforced the chest with say ... iron, that person would have to ""break"" the chest 250 times for it to actually break. Reinforced noteblocks and jukeboxes are labeled snitches (if you ever hear someone talking about a snitch!). They are ... well, snitches. What they do is make it so that if someone walks within the radius of a reinforced noteblock/jukebox, it alerts the creator/group of the reinforcement that the person did so. Jukeboxes also will tell the creator/group if they interact with any blocks in that radius! It's a great way to ensure your safety of items and supplies. :)  Another neat mechanic is the saddles plugin. If you have a horse and a saddle, you just need to open your inventory while riding the horse and take the saddle off (without shift clicking). As long as you were the one to tame/place the horse, you'll be able to capture it in the saddle and call it out (by right clicking the saddle against the ground) any time. :) Doesn't even eat the saddle up!    The last one that I think is kind of crucial to know about is our Diseases plugin. If you've logged into the server, you probably saw the scoreboard on the right side. The plugin adds two things - diseases and temperature. It helps to make the world a bit more difficult. You'll find that temperature is far easier to manage now, though. Temperature is based on what's around you, and what you're wearing, as well as any possible illnesses you may have. If you're in a cold area at night, be prepared to be slowed or blinded a few times, unless you wear warm armor (leather!). Illnesses have cures (which can be seen on the tutorials page), but have nasty side effects that - if not cured - will kill you.     I ... totally just rambled way too much, so I understand if you didn't read all that, haha. ><  I'm sorry! Let me know if you have any questions!!  TLDR: Getting VoxelMap is good, exploring the map is good, talking to people is good, and checking out the tutorial page is good. Edit: AND TEAMSPEAK! Teamspeak is good to join too, if you have that! :D"

I could go ahead and write up and do something myself, but they seemed rather keen to do so, and thus I've not been making too much of an active effort to make those more ""targeted"" ads, and instead stuck to the wide sweeping mcservers stuff.

You should give the pearl to whoever is willing to keep him and has a secure vault for free.   It's an assumed risk to keep a pearl, the risk that someone may try to bust them out. There is also a variable material cost in gold to holding the pearl.  Don't act like you're owed anything for the pearl. Unless someone had put a bounty on the individual you're not."

TheRealmsMC,3ab3b0,NaarbSmokin,3,Thu Jun 18 18:09:33 2015 UTC,The selling part is because kitten will message EVERYONE on the server asking to be freed.  And we have to explain over and over again.  Think of the price as how much it will cost someone to free someone else.

TheRealmsMC,3aayoh,KortexVortex,1 point,Fri Jun 19 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"He wanted to join us because everyone kept saying MoP was the one who broke him out. He himself had no idea who did that.

If you like beer and a good cuppa, we're the place.    We are large for the server (22 citizens), which means there's usually a few of us online at any given time.  Also very active - most members are online every day or two.  Britannia is also established enough that some of our citizens have been able to specialize in their preferred roles if they wish.  We've got shipwrights, brewers, dye merchants, diplomats, bounty hunters, enchanters, and even a DJ.  Currently, we're looking for a doctor who wants to explore and treat the myriad of diseases found in the lands.    Our leader is King George. But he's mad - not to mention fictitious - so we're left being a straight democracy.    I'll be honest: If you're looking to help form and plan a new, undeveloped nation, we're probably not a good fit.  But if you like having people to talk to and interact with, or want to be able to have a large labor force to help you with your dreams, give us a shot.

The government isnt a democracy per-say, and more of a direct group, where all members have a equal input as to what goes on within the nation, this creates a sense of freedom and allows for citizens to take their own initiative when it comes to the nation. As such, the goal when the nation was founded, was as a peaceful haven from the war and disease of surrounding nations. It had always been planned to be able to manufacture enough vaccines so that newer nations that would otherwise have trouble with disease could flourish, while as of late we have been moving towards international projects and groups, such as the Metro Rail system (Formerly known as D6) and The Rangers of Spera (A Dragon Hunting group)."

TheRealmsMC,3aawfm,InsanePigeon,1 point,Fri Jun 19 04:25:52 2015 UTC,Would there be any interest in a Fun Question <weekday> like the one on a certain other server?
TheRealmsMC,3a89e0,pellksar,6,Thu Jun 18 00:28:12 2015 UTC,"Perhaps related: During the first week of the server, several members of Britannia visited all the biomes on the map and dug out multiple ""core samples"" to see what sort of ore would be found.  Those were usually nothing more than vertical shafts.  I believe most were filled in with dirt, but I would believe that others may have done the same thing.    It's my understanding that the best way to spot an xray miner is for the mods to merely check the mining statistics.  Xrayers will have a much higher ore/stone break ratio than other people because they are going straight for the ore rather than working through mounds of stone."
TheRealmsMC,3a89e0,TinyEmperor,2,Thu Jun 18 00:53:02 2015 UTC,"Okay i get your point on the Britannian visit but, as the entrance hole was very close to our houses, i saw it wasn't there the day before. :/  Well, actually, maybe the hole was old, and the torches marking it were recent and made me realize it was here, but i doubt about it.  THOUGH it was crossing one or two travelling shafts, those shafts were very precisely aimed, as you said, apparently going staright for the ore, if there is any way to check such ratios , it would help. :D    Edit : Forgot ""maybe"" in the sentence."
TheRealmsMC,3a89e0,Ehini,1 point,Thu Jun 18 01:03:01 2015 UTC,"That's not necessarily true. I remember early on in the CivEx experiment, a member of Nexus finding a vein of 80+ diamonds, while another only discovering 4 diamond ores. It's quite honestly just luck."
TheRealmsMC,3a89e0,TinyEmperor,1 point,Thu Jun 18 04:48:15 2015 UTC,"That's correct and one should never place their trust in a small sample size like two people.  But after a few days, if one really stands out from everyone else, the mods could certainly shadow them and watch for obvious xraying (zigzagging directly to ore, etc)"
TheRealmsMC,3a89e0,ToastedMantras,2,Thu Jun 18 05:00:15 2015 UTC,"Thats why we're asking questions, its obvious zig zagging to ores... Its speculation but it looks bad... That what pellksar meant"

I much reduced the amount I was going to claim. You can keep the coast as yours on the map, I don't really care about land claims. You can claim all the land there for your nation, as long as I can operate independently and build there. I simply need that location as it's central to my river improvement plans.

We're heavily involved in politics, capturing a multitude of criminals for other nations who either weren't strong enough to capture the person or just didn't have the time. Our nation has our own god, Touma the true god of Thunder (though many believe that Fulgur is the original, you can check the original post for Mikoto, Touma was there first).  We'd love for you to at least come and check us out if this giant ass paragraph doesn't convince you, hopefully our ingame interaction would swing your vote. :)  If you do plan on visiting, message VeggieMonsta, ItsCookieMonster or myself in game.

TheRealmsMC,39v105,SuperWizard68,1 point,Mon Jun 15 06:43:51 2015 UTC,I recently visited the port of Leo Islands (that belongs to Midgard right?) and I saw 2 stolen boats and a copy of a stolen boat. Can you please explain that?
TheRealmsMC,39v105,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:39:22 2015 UTC,"None of those boats are stolen, I can confirm that. The Galleon was based off of LivingPutin's ship and the others were original builds. There's also a massive ship just off the coast of the Midgard Empire, that Holy made for Lionheart."
TheRealmsMC,39v105,Ehini,1 point,Mon Jun 15 11:53:58 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure that you're wrong by saying that none of them were stolen. The two smaller ones had exactly, and i mean EXACTLY the shape of one of my boats (an original build of mine that had been stolen earlier)."
TheRealmsMC,39v105,StunningShogun,2,Mon Jun 15 15:11:51 2015 UTC,So your saying you lost a boat that looks like both of mine? Accusing me of stealing your boats is not a good thing. If your the one who took one of my boats theres going be hell to pay. I spent hours building those damn things. atleast 2.5 hours for the smaller and 4 hours for the larger one. They have been sitting there for weeks. so don't accuse me of stealing your boat that came up missing just because you seen mine.
TheRealmsMC,39v105,IronWolf209,1 point,Tue Jun 16 01:44:57 2015 UTC,I don't have it by the way.
TheRealmsMC,39v105,StunningShogun,1 point,Tue Jun 16 06:04:36 2015 UTC,"The boat went missing a couple of weeks ago. I think it's rather odd that two different People came up with the exact same design for a boat. I also think you're rude and aggressive, there's valid reasons for us to suspect you stole that boat."
TheRealmsMC,39v105,lagiacrus2012,2,Tue Jun 16 16:04:22 2015 UTC,I'm rude and aggressive? Maybe I'm aggressive because I'm being accused of stealing and pretty much being called a liar.
TheRealmsMC,39v105,IronWolf209,1 point,Tue Jun 16 18:40:02 2015 UTC,"There is valid reason for me to do so. But this discussion is only going to lead to conflict, which I would like to prevent. So just Keep your boats. -May Gleichia guide you."

TheRealmsMC,39v105,Ehini,2,Mon Jun 15 11:55:04 2015 UTC,No idea. I just know that during the time I lived Shōtaku-chi a boat was stolen and those small boats looked exactly the same. Ceadeus8 and I definitely can tell because he built it and I saw it being built. Maybe Lionheart stole it and tried to sell it?
TheRealmsMC,39v105,lagiacrus2012,1 point,Mon Jun 15 18:36:37 2015 UTC,Odd because I saw Lionheart build the smaller boats. Perhaps he got a schematica of your boat? I know that's what he did for LivingPutins and then he just added his own little things.
TheRealmsMC,39v105,Ehini,1 point,Mon Jun 15 23:13:32 2015 UTC,I like you. You're not immediately threatening Ceadeus8 like Lionheart is.

TheRealmsMC,39s44j,submissivehealer,2,Sun Jun 14 13:49:05 2015 UTC,"Hey there. :) You'll need to download a program, teamspeak. It's a voice chat program, that allows lots of people to talk to each other while playing Minecraft (or any other game!).     Once you've downloaded and installed teamspeak, when you open it up for the first time, it should set up a few things for you, like if you're using a voice-activated system (so that you don't need to push any buttons to be heard) or a push to talk button (where what you say only is sent to everyone else if you're pushing a button - great if you've got others nearby).     After that, you'll be able to connect to our specific teamspeak server by clicking [Connections] > [Connect]. This will bring up a pop-up. In the Server Address box, put: ts.therealmsmc.com. In the Nickname box, put what you want others to see your name as. We don't have a server password, so you should leave that box blank. From there, just hit connect. :)"

TheRealmsMC,39ppty,mcWinton,5,Sat Jun 13 17:08:41 2015 UTC,"Thankfully, most of the unique plugins are optional to play.    For the essentials, you've got ores in specific biomes (Iron is the rarest here by far) and RealisticBiomes for food growth.  Citadel exists like CivEx, but you need to use the NameLayer commands to get a group going.  JukeAlert is unchanged.   Brewery is here too.  Diseases are generally deadly if caught by new players, but at least you can check with the command ""/disease check""  They're mostly found in the jungle, desert, and snow biomes.  Temperature is based off a variety of conditions instead of biome and height like CivEx.  Finally, there's a lovely, official 3D Map that is updated regularly.

Just the reinforce plugin here is different than I've ever used.  I recommend the Midguard Empire, it has great architecture, and consists of several large islands with large populations. Also, most of the guys from Brandywine live here! :P"
TheRealmsMC,39ppty,SuperWizard68,0,Sat Jun 13 16:52:24 2015 UTC,Ya you know you're welcome in the Midgard brother. For the most part we stay neutral. Unless there is raiders out and about. Then for the safety of the server we Pearl them to keep them from even stepping foot in our nation or friends nations. We have 3 city states under us and are very active.
TheRealmsMC,39p1zs,NOTredtao,7,Sat Jun 13 11:06:47 2015 UTC,Nice shipyard. I love how much Britannia contributes to the Movecraft element of the server :)

They'll also go back to dropping their heads and rotten flesh/brains once I do so. I don't know how the heads disappeared as items, however, that should not have happened (the plugin affecting the pigmen has nothing to do with the heads). Are you positive someone didn't move them from the vault who was in the snitch group?    In terms of the pumpkins, that shouldn't happen. Good news, you don't need to babysit them - realistic biomes works so that plants grow even if you aren't in the area. Bad news, makes me worry that nothing is then working in the Mega Taiga.

TheRealmsMC,39md0v,submissivehealer,9,Fri Jun 12 19:22:58 2015 UTC,"Just so people are aware:  These are the reasons we're not releasing their names:   I refuse to glorify people who think coming onto a server they don't wish to play and destroying it for their own pleasure and to make themselves look good in front of their friends is an okay thing. I'll not them be able to link here and brag ""Look what I done!"" They have never spoken on the subreddit, nor have they ever modmailed or said anything in chat.  This isn't just a case of griefing, this is a case of specifically hacking the game and breaking our server making it impossible for our players to join:- this is by far one of the most serious bans we have given out.        The people who sign in to our server expecting a safe, mature, enjoyable environment to escape from life, or to merely explore, are the important people. Your dedication, hard work, play time, caring and attitude has made this server into so much more than what I expected. It astonishes me every time I read a lore post you write, every time I see a build you've made, every time I take my ship out for a little spin and visit lands I've never seen before.   I am forever, and constantly, impressed by each and every interaction, action, and build you guys (and girls!) make.   The people who do these types of things to servers, and people, aren't worth the post to inform everyone that they've been banned. We will never accept that attitude upon this server."

TheRealmsMC,39muax,Dnessen,3,Fri Jun 12 22:07:25 2015 UTC,"Heya! I sometimes get that error too, something about an invalid session?   It generally happens from time to time when you lose connection to the Minecraft Auth servers (These are the servers that make sure your account is actually a Minecraft account, and not just a pirated copy) - because it has lost contact, it can't communicate then to the server to let the server know that you're on a valid session (Logged into a valid MC account) and thus throws an error.   Usually this can happen when the Minecraft Auth servers go down to maintenance, or sometimes just randomly. Best bet is to close Minecraft completely, all the way, so that all things to do with MC are closed. Then restart it and log in again from scratch."

They let you know who entered, who looked into chests, who broke which block in your land.

And finally. MODMAIL, I cannot stress this enough, modmail. Attach those screenshots, let us know the location, give us a heads up about who, why and where. Give us the screenshots so that the Staff can narrow it down, and not spend longer than is needed in not only 1) fixing stuff that you can't, and 2) dealing with people who either haven't taken the time to read the rules, or are clearly here to be assholes."

If they did, you might want to talk to them about it, unless you're feeling up to taking it by force.  Claims are just what a nation can enforce here - no mods or plugins set that.  Some claims are abandoned, but the map rarely reflects that.    Finally, put a post here on the subreddit so everyone knows about your nation and your lands.    There's no such thing as public domain.  However, claiming certain rare areas might displease other nations.  But most will let you know right away."

Then open the map up in paint or whatever you want and draw your claim on the map. Once you have that, a nation's name, government, etc. you're ready to make a post on the subreddit announcing your nation and claims. Then if other nations recognize your nations claims then you're good to go!   And yes, the volcanos are typically referred to as public domain and not many nations, if any, will recognize that claim.

TheRealmsMC,3936b9,trollbusted,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:41:37 2015 UTC,Just out of curiosity what did they grief? Because from the picture it looks like they broke a few blocks to get into a room. I'm not saying they where in the wrong or the right. I'm just curious.
TheRealmsMC,3936b9,IronWolf209,2,Mon Jun 8 23:12:19 2015 UTC,They killed all of the animals in 3 separate locations. Broke random blocks on a house in one nation. Also left no wheat behind in the farms.
TheRealmsMC,3936b9,IronWolf209,2,Mon Jun 8 23:16:58 2015 UTC,O ok. I was just wondering because from the snitch logs posted only 3 animals where killed. One horse and 2 pigs. Plus only the outer edge of the wheat farm was farmed up and the middle left untouch. Far as the building it looked like they may have broken blocks to get in it but ran into a chest and hand to break around it. But I can't see everything a mod can and there was probably a lot more then what was posted. That's why I was curious.
TheRealmsMC,3936b9,mcWinton,3,Mon Jun 8 23:27:47 2015 UTC,"I can't attest to their other actions, but they broke a hole through the side of my house when the doors were all wide open and the wall was only 1 block thick (so there was no chance anything was hidden inside/behind it). That alone wouldn't be temp ban worthy, but it illustrates their willingness to just bash holes in people's builds for no reason."

I don't mean to sound like a dick, because I love everything else you guys are doing (and am continually amazed by it), but it seems like you only want us to follow these gods and lore. I like the perk of donating and getting a god in this pantheon, but what about rival pantheons? Religious evolution too? There's a reason animism and almost all polytheistic religions (minus hinduism for large religions) have gone the way of the dodo.   I like these gods and their lore, but wish people had some freedom in it. The mods are suppose to be a neutral party but this way you obviously endorse (as a group and as the acting force behind the server) a certain group or a certain of playing on the server.   P.S-This has been spurred on mostly by the ignoring of non pantheon gods/religions by the community and watching S5 of GoT. Watching R'hollor and the Seven have even bigger impacts but conflicting ideals makes for some super interesting sub-plots."
TheRealmsMC,392od3,ekez_666,3,Mon Jun 8 21:48:35 2015 UTC,"Bare in mind these are mearly overviews of each God. The rest is up to the players. I do agree that having to donate places restrictions on the powers of other Gods though what is to stop a nation creating and worshiping their own God even though they don't ""exist"". FULGUR was once ""non-existant"" in the code but we still worshiped him."
TheRealmsMC,392od3,Curlysnail,2,Mon Jun 8 21:57:33 2015 UTC,Erebos was created in HIS unholy name prior to him being able to gather the strength and gain foot hold on the land he now claims for his own.
TheRealmsMC,392od3,pokefanYush,3,Mon Jun 8 21:59:46 2015 UTC,"There is a need for some restriction, I was an admin on a server that had the gods, and as much fun as this plugin is. For people to create their own gods on a whim was more bad than good. We even restricted RL beliefs as we didnt want real religion to cause an issue with players. But then there were people creating gods just because, or creating gods with player names. You name it, they tried it. Furthermore, it became very difficult to keep control of. So in the end leaving it in a more restricted sense keeps the peace for the most part and really allows the players to explore and create the lore of Spera.   May Erebos continue to let you tread upon the lands"
TheRealmsMC,392od3,pokefanYush,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:58:25 2015 UTC,"There is a large distinction between what are ""Gods"" in terms of the Plugin we have in game for Gods and what are ""Gods"" in terms of player made up gods.   What you have listed above, are Gods that currently work with the Plugin for Gods. We do not force this lore upon people, nor force them to follow that lore in their own RP; people are more than welcome to follow their own religion beyond the Gods Plugin (I can name Touma as one of those).   The difference, however, is for me to come along and go ""Oi, Touma people, your God decided that you need to do X!"" wouldn't be taken very well because that would be me overstepping my bounds into a RP I had no part in stepping into; however, those who donate for their God to be added to the plugin, also have their God and his Backstory and ideals, woven into the cloth of story and detail that we can influence. (They don't have to; we never forced them to, we suggest they do - as it not only fleshes out their God and makes them feel more alive with all the interconnected stuff, but also fleshes out ""our"" pantheon even more. In fact, almost every person who has come to Donate a God has already stepped forward with ""This is Son of X"" or ""This would be the God of Death, though I don't know how we'd fit that with Y plugin God already - what do you think"" (It's the reason we ask people to Modmail long before they donate :) )  If I were to try and keep track of every religion ever worshiped in game, it would be nearly impossible - and even more impossible to have them mesh into a tale of lore and story and progression world wise that I can influence and guide. There would be no common link between them, there would be no common thread; they're like two different tapestries, one a work of impressionism and the other a work of naturalism (merely two art terms that offer very contrasting types of art); to throw those two together and attempt to make them blend doesn't work.   ""But Zantid, you can't add -THAT- Mob, that mob doesn't exist in my Gods back story""  ""Oh and Zantid, PrisonPearl totally isn't okay because my other God over here decided to ban all prison pearls with his power""  To acknowledge every instance of a person using a God, would make it impossible to forge a living world. But we do not stop you from making them, nor do we wish you not to make them. We urge and encourage people to make their own Lore for their world, their RP; and if others love it, you'll see them starting to adopt it more and more (Look at Hanaq's Qs). It's just 1 detailed Lore post away from a person to make :) and all it requires is the dedication and love of a core group of people, and you have yourself a living breathing God all of your own, that you never needed to donate for to get the perks of an ""altar"" and having them added to an ingame list in which people can brag about ""who has the most"" :)"
TheRealmsMC,392od3,The_Zantid,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:15:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I know what you're saying. I don't want them added to the plugin (too much work/the reasons you stated/you guys have better things to do) but what I meant was that there is this pantheon endorsed by the  mods would seem to be the ""official"" pantheon. Perhaps instead of labeling the posts lore, you label them Gods plugin lore or something.   Here's an example of what I mean- I saw you guys before launch off of my friends from CivEx and was like ""Sweet. Lore and rp galore"" but then an official (well, perhaps not official but mod endorsed or appearing so) world name and god pantheon. My ideas plummeted for gods and religion. I felt they didn't really matter. (Suggestion- Perhaps a spotlight on lore or nation every week? So people can see and hear others more clearly and new players can see these clearly) Speaking of new players, I feel this is who is effected most by these. They could have the same reaction I did to the server's premise but then see some sort of official looking pantheon and world name when they look at the sub for the first few times start to think ""Oh... am I supposed to fit into this or..?"" And like me after asking questions and getting the clarification of ""No, create any lore"" they may still feel disheartened now theirs isn't this sort of official lore. Btw, sorry for the word official, I know it's not the best but with these posts it sort of feels like it.  I just want mod recognition of other lores so people treat them all on the same playing field and we can have a richer world. How boring would GoT be with just the 7? Or just the old gods?   I guess my suggestions are:   A different title to the posts for gods added to the plugin A god not in the pantheon added to the plugin A spotlight for nations, gods, and lore also not apart of the plugin that's stickied for everyone to see, especially new friends"

TheRealmsMC,392q3q,GiantCarrotMan,2,Mon Jun 8 20:47:26 2015 UTC,"The reason why experience costs are so high is because ideally, I want it to take you months to level up. I don't want someone to reach level 30 in a month - there's no challenge to it, it makes being a master at your skill not worth as much.     That being said, you're right. Enchanting is extraordinary difficult to level, and farming is way easier. I'd be willing to change the exponential factor, if people are interested, on enchanting only. This probably wouldn't take effect until the new classes are added, though."

TheRealmsMC,390z6y,TerribleCat,2,Mon Jun 8 13:28:58 2015 UTC,"Welcome to the server, Melsky! I knew there was something I forgot to do.. I'll get started on the tutorial, sorry about that. :c sleeping in a bed stops the random spawns, so the next time you spawn, if you're anywhere on the southern continent, I can find you and get you a bed.     My recommendation to you is to check out the flat or 3D map and figure out where you are and try to get to a city or town near you. Most people are pretty nice and will help you get food or torches and a few basic supplies. You'll be able to find coal in almost any biome, it's just pretty rare. Savannas have more plentiful coal than most biomes, so I recommend mining in a savanna to get the necessary supplies when starting out. They've also got some iron, which you can use to trade with other nations for food and building supplies.    Once you've got enough supplies, your best bet is to get to a piece of the map (that I recommend be unclaimed) that you like, circle the area in paint, and make a message on the subreddit saying you claim the land. This tells everyone else that the land is your land, and nations can choose to acknowledge you or not, though if you're reasonable, I don't think that will be a problem. It's also where you can ""declare"" a nation, if you are interested in that.     If you don't want to go through the trouble of building your own place, and want the advantage of joining people who have already gotten started (or like belonging to a group!), you should join a nation! There's a ton of them and I'm sure they'll all eager for members. c:     In terms of location an area of he map to meet people at, you should open up the claims map and the flat map and locate the cities of those towns. Some of them, like Britannia, are super noticeable while others, like Hanaq, are a bit smaller (but just as beautiful!!). You can also message anyone online - I'd like to think we're all pretty friendly!"

TheRealmsMC,38zipz,NOTredtao,2,Mon Jun 8 04:01:40 2015 UTC,"Deep sea mining:       Deep sea mining is a relatively new mineral retrieval process that takes place on the ocean floor. Ocean mining sites are usually around large areas of polymetallic nodules or active and extinct hydrothermal vents at about 1,400 – 3,700 m below the ocean’s surface.  The vents create sulfide deposits, which contain valuable metals such as silver, gold, copper, manganese, cobalt, and zinc.   The deposits are mined using either hydraulic pumps or bucket systems that take ore to the surface to be processed. As with all mining operations, deep sea mining raises questions about potential environmental impact on surrounding areas. Environmental advocacy groups such as Greenpeace have argued that seabed mining should not be permitted in most of the world's oceans because of the potential for damage to deepsea ecosystems.

I have a very young sister and my parents left the country and I am babysitting. I worked on it this morning when I woke up, and I'll work on it again when I get home. I can't fix things that quickly, especially because I don't want to nix the entire plugin.     Diseases and temperature are the same plugin. Temperature has had a lot of issues, in more than one file and area. Fixing one issue led to a memory leak. Fixed that, it still didn't fix all the issues, as you've encountered.    Right now I'm rewriting part of the main class so that there is a cap on the temperature. Your temperature will ""cap"" at +/-150. That part I do have completed. The next thing I have to work on is to completely rewrite how temperature changes. Currently, it is based off a config file. If you are in a ""freezing"" ambient area, your temperature is supposed to drop far more quickly than if you're in a neutral area. I am rewriting this entirely, even though the logic in the file is correct, because clearly it is not working as intended.     I know we haven't mentioned too much on it, but it is being worked on."

It adds immersion and uniqueness to the server, likewise the Gods plugin."
TheRealmsMC,38vczd,TwistTheCat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:58:01 2015 UTC,"Well, the reason is that me and braan were just at the nether. I got up to 123 degrees, him 50. We sat in an ice throne for like half an hour. Our temperature went down a grand total of 0 degrees. Earlier today, Twist had a temperature of 750. That tells something."

TheRealmsMC,38vczd,ArsenalOwl,5,Sun Jun 7 03:48:58 2015 UTC,"Twists Temperature was that high because he didn't go out of his way to do anything to cool down. He specifically done everything possible to get his Temp that high (There's even a screenshot in which he mentions he's attempting to break his record).   That isn't the plugin being broken - that's one player specifically wanting to see how high they can do.   As for your throne of Ice Issue. You're in the Nether. The Biome is literally called ""Hell"" - Just saying :P   With all that ice, why don't you craft Bottle Ice Water instead? Drinking those lowers your temperature. The Nether is a hell hole. It's a horrid pit and a bitch to endure.   Remember to stay more than 5 Blocks away from any Lava Sources and remove your armour. Apart from that, I have, in all complete honesty, not once had any issues with the Temperature system that everyone keeps mentioning.   Once you know how to manage your temperature it becomes really easy"
TheRealmsMC,38vczd,The_Zantid,2,Sun Jun 7 03:56:42 2015 UTC,To reach that high of a temperature by simply standing outside in the desert is improbable in real life - 750 on any scale is hotter than any reasonable natural temperature would reach. Some sort of logarithmic or square root ramping factor on temperature - making a soft cap on it - would at least add some realism to the system.
TheRealmsMC,38vczd,TwistTheCat,1 point,Sun Jun 7 07:00:58 2015 UTC,"I do wanna say, iin regards to the Hell thing, in the picture they posted on the sub the chat shows that the ambient temperature was -99.  So their body temperature should have gone down.    I personally have managed to cool down in the nether simply be walling myself off from nearby sources of lava and ditching my armor.  I suppose the plugin has been tweaked since then."
TheRealmsMC,38vczd,The_Zantid,2,Sun Jun 7 09:45:35 2015 UTC,"Nope, the plugin hasn't been tweaked in any way since then except to add in a couple of cold blocks. 99% of the code isn't ours, and instead is the simple base plugin that we've neither touched nor changed."

In real life, I'm pretty sure I would cool down sitting in god damn ice. Why do we have to bring the ice water when I can sit down on a throne of ice? Removing armor and staying away from lava does jack shit also."

And also add weather/seasons if possible.  The addition of three/four new professions: Yes! But I don't have much in mind for abilities. I think Knights and Defenders should be separate, for sure, and Defenders should be the direct counter of Knights. Perhaps they get resistance/regen while they are within their home area? Something like that."
TheRealmsMC,38u4lw,Candlepup,5,Sat Jun 6 21:28:25 2015 UTC,1: Just Sprint speed.  And very little. 2: Yes. 3: Yes.  Diseases are just random death sentences to most. 4: Sounds good - but I prefer for the professions to stick with custom recipes instead of active abilities or buffs.  I would also combine the gatherer+farmer+fisherman into one single profession centered around producing foodstuffs and materials.    How about adding the Meeting Room Plugin for private conversations between a group of people without having to all use TS?
TheRealmsMC,38u4lw,TinyEmperor,4,Sat Jun 6 21:38:29 2015 UTC,"Armour weight: I'm not completely sold on this one, I could see it getting kind of annoying for travelling through the nether and other PvE situations.

Disease removal: I like the diseases plugin currently. Although if it's such a mess of code maybe another option would be better.  Professions: I like the idea of these new Professions and then new abilities it would bring, could I selfishly ask that the Alchemist skills are looked at again though as well. Specifically the extra night vision potion which isn't useful because of Gammabright."

Higher rate of enchanted items. Very low chance to get materials from all classes. Gatherer gathers plants and materials. Slight chance of duplicating drop.

TheRealmsMC,38u4lw,SlyIsSpooky,2,Sat Jun 6 21:27:38 2015 UTC,"The reason why there's talk about diseases going away is because the plugin is written fairly poorly - I've already made several changes to the plugin, and there's still a lot that I would need to do to make it better - like with the immunity issue. :( I do think it adds something unique, though."

On CivEx, they pretended to start a warlike nation, immediately claim the land of others, and then raided nonstop until they were banned.  All the while claiming innocence and persecution on Reddit.  Sound familiar?  Same stuff they posted here until their posts were removed due from too many downvotes.    There's a right and a wrong way to try to atone for your past misdeeds and show that you have changed.  I____I has shown an excellent example of the right way.  Daddo & friends have not.  I still hear the same tired song from them claiming absolute innocence that they used in CivEx.    Go ahead daddo. Please, sit and refute me line-by-line.

Britannia has zero tolerance for banned raiders hopping servers in hope to continue their actions. He made a direct and completely pointed claim on a large part of another nation's land.  When confronted, he refused to back down.  What would you do if someone refused to stop claiming your land and threatened armed conflict to those who disagreed with them?     Britannia responded to the request for assistance from this nation and initiated war against Bashbog and his friends.  If you claim the lands of others and threaten conflict, how can you act surprised when you are attacked and pearled?    Finally, this isn't a faction server Bashbog.  LFF = Looking for Faction.  I believe the HCF servers are that way.  You will probably find a warmer welcome there.    UPDATE The pearls have been delivered the aggrieved party as per our arrangement with them.  So the same nation that Bashbog and friends tried to claim land from and threaten has their pearls.  Contact Lionheart if you want them now."
TheRealmsMC,38ufp7,TinyEmperor,2,Sat Jun 6 23:32:58 2015 UTC,I talked to the people who we claimed over on teamspeak and we worked it all out

Looking at what happened, if he was in fact the one who made the claim over someone's land, then he is in the wrong, if it was one of ho's friends doing that then bashbog should not be punished because his crew is awful.  And isn't all this a little hateful?"
TheRealmsMC,38ufp7,TinyEmperor,3,Sat Jun 6 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"He made the actual claims    Lionheart confronted them about it and his friends didn't back down    He was heard to have boasted over TS that he was going to nonstop raid TS.    I personally have given second chances to raiders that have shown sincere effort to reform.   I have seen no sincere effort so far from him, only accusations that my nation has violated rule 11.    So, no, this is not hateful.  This is me refusing to listen to the same song that they sung on CivEx."
TheRealmsMC,38ufp7,BigxXxDaddy,2,Sat Jun 6 23:50:07 2015 UTC,"Claim was legal. I just want to know why you felt the need to confront him on his claim? That seems awfully hateful to me.  As for the second points, the fire nation deserves to be beaten a bit for infringing on land claims. Understandable reason to dismember the nation.  I ain't gonna defend him on the team speak because if he is truly dumb enough to say that then he deserves it. But idk how much of it i s true.  As for the accusations I didn't see any accusations but only saw home post ""This is what is happening to us"" and you getting confrontationally defensive. Not just defensive, but defensive like you have a personal vendetta, and that's not fair to him.  It is hard to take all your points however as you were immediately confrontational"

TheRealmsMC,38t7r6,daddo69,5,Sat Jun 6 17:04:09 2015 UTC,I believe its because the first days quan and roguedark where on here they attacked someone and started calling him a nigger. They where ban for it. Then after ban you guys all come on here and those same two guys are stating they are the fire nation and are going raid and attack others. That seems to be the main reason to be on here from our eyes. after claiming a small chunk of the desert they decide to claim all the desert which included my small claim of the desert. When I told them they have claimed part of my land their they made it very clear they wasn't going respect my land claim. You yourself said in TeamSpeak that you plan to build a nation and go out and raid others from time to time. So this is all the nations response to threats of raiding. I mean really what did you expect? If you come on here talking about raiding people and have had a history of it you cant expect other nations to sit there let you build up a force and raid them.

You will find a variety of posts describing the ways we build, expand, help, or even confront people in a manner that is approved and encouraged by the staff.      Regarding your specific issue: We are assisting friends who were threatened and encroached by your nation.  Your nation clearly, and in no uncertain terms, made a claim upon another nation and did not back down.  In both of the other Civ servers, as well as here, that can mean armed conflict.  We assisted that nation in a manner approved by the staff: nation vs nation war.    But I strongly suspect that was the motive you were hoping to use yourself just like you used in CivEx.  To be able to point out that you were just RPing a ""warlike nation"" and fighting over land conflicts when confronted with illegal raiding accusations.  That road runs both ways though.  Your group attempted to bypass the illegal raider restricting by appearing as a nation of raiders who claim the lands of others.

TheRealmsMC,38olol,TinyEmperor,5,Fri Jun 5 16:03:35 2015 UTC,Both of these suggestions are golden.  Maybe make the enchantment one for a researcher?  Gives an incentive for cities to have researchers to better equip their soldiers. And also the researcher cannot benefit directly through combat because of their XP loss!   It balances and encourages cooperation!
TheRealmsMC,38olol,_Rosseau_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:05:23 2015 UTC,"I agree wholeheartedly with this comment. there is already an enchantment but increases move speed as part of the enchanter profession. it should be pretty easy to edit the files to make sure it can't occur at the same time as protection.

Once upon a time a couple years back I participated in a Civ minecraft armour weight plugin, I was utterly destroyed by a fellow tester with a wooden sword and naked (he was just proving a point) against my iron armor and sword trying my hardest to kill him.

TheRealmsMC,38olol,_Rosseau_,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:01:51 2015 UTC,But then what about regular armor wearers who actually play on the server and people who just come into the server to fight/raid/kill with wooden/stone swords?
TheRealmsMC,38olol,SlyIsSpooky,1 point,Sat Jun 6 10:55:58 2015 UTC,"Well it comes down to tweaking the speed downfalls significantly.  The test server had it at ridiculous levels where Iron was Slow II -_- It was impossible to maneuver the way they had it set up.  I want just a bit slower, but not be crazy slow.    If said situation were to happen in my eyes, one in diamond should be putting out punches harder than the stone/wood user to be able to fight back against.  Also assuming both sides have bows, diamond will win pretty much every time in a tick for tack fight 1v1.  When it comes to group fights with armor diversities to become interesting and not just diamond kit toting clone troopers."

TheRealmsMC,38olol,_sar,0,Fri Jun 5 18:05:17 2015 UTC,"This will never work. Either one of the following will happen:  Diamond will be so slow that it is useless. People only use chain armor (btw its a four shot kill)  Diamond is slowed but still good enough that the other armors are useless. At that point it's just a nuisance, this is the same thing we have right now."
TheRealmsMC,38olol,Sharpcastle33,1 point,Fri Jun 5 16:15:03 2015 UTC,"The second one isn't quite ""the same thing we have now.""  The biggest difference is that it gives non-combatants(in lower armor levels) a chance to escape in PVP situations.  Getting raided would still suck, but at least you got away, and didn't lose your valuable equipment."

Some however, who we now refer to as the cloud demons, wished to stay in the dance of the untamed storm and rebelled against FULGUR.     FULGUR waged war on the sky demons, his great army of Hurricane chariots, Thunderbeasts and The Great Tornado Leviathan of the Sky tore through the pitiful army of the sky demons, sending their forces flying and scattering across Spera. From what we loyal servants to FULGUR have observed it appears that some sky demons still lurk in the night, across the highest peaks of Spera.     FULGUR has called to us to finish the war. We are his soldiers now. The songs of storm roar through us like the thunder that echoes through the night.

TheRealmsMC,38ftzk,CptChaos3201,5,Thu Jun 4 00:09:24 2015 UTC,"Totally not Dragons   MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM. MMMMMMM!!!!  If you want a lore mob, for Lux there should be a creature that can emit bright flashes of light like the Ender Dragon does when you kill it. Maybe a creeper that does this before it explodes, inflicting blindness?  Alternatively, have you ever seen the Game Theory episode discussing how creepers could possibly be plants rather than animals? Sphagnum moss, specifically, which in reality bursts to release its spores/seeds into the air to plant them elsewhere. The long and short of it is that creepers explode to either spread their spores onto something that can then carry them and deposit them elsewhere (if you survive) or to make an excellent decomposing host for the baby moss creepers (if you die). So I think Terra could do something good with that. Perhaps something like the mod that added more creepers and they could explode into all different things. In the case of the Moss Creeper, perhaps wherever they explode they leave a circle of leaves, tall grasses, ferns, and flowers?  I also humbly request things such as legendary horses. Think like the fire horses that draw Apollo's chariot being tied to Lux, gorgeous shining-white mounts that run like the sun across the sky. The earthly mounts of Tera, the elusive and deadly horses of Tenebris. Horses that can call thunder, if that's at all possible, for Fulgur/Touma. Some odd  horse from Ellatrix that can play tricks and give gifts or something? I don't know much about the lore of Ellatrix and the thunder gods.  Also rideable dragons pls. But seriously, if you ever want creative ideas for dragons and such, hit me up. I'm a huge nerd for dragons and I'd rattle off ideas now but this post has already gotten long."

Maybe make all zombies connected to Tenebris?   Have mobs that spawn in the desert that are hostile only to non-followers of Lux(dunno if that's possible) and they only spawn at high heat during the day.    Yeti's spawning in icy biomes.  Camels? Just like horses but have a speed bonus over sand?  Amphibious mounts that can be ridden over water?  Werewolves, that can pass the condition on to you?  And on the full moon you become a wolf and don't have access to your items... okay, that one's crazy, probably you couldn't do that.    I don't know how many of these are actually possible or plausible, just throwing out some ideas."

TheRealmsMC,38ftzk,MavellDuceau,1 point,Sat Jun 6 11:21:53 2015 UTC,"I think certain mobs like Zombies and Creepers are too classic to ""replace."" However they could use buffs to make them a bigger threat and give players an incentive to product their property from mobs.  For Zombies I'd be super cool to not only buff their speed, but also give them the ability to put slowness on players when they deal damage, as well as boost the % that attacking one would spawn a random zombie. This would make zombie hordes a much deadlier threat and people would think twice before deciding to fight.  Creepers could benefit from maybe biome specificity. If we're being honest certain biomes are just better and more useful. A small little tweak would be making certain mobs like creepers harder to kill and more dangerous in certain more desirable biomes. Maybe plains creepers would explode larger, run faster, or even throw fire/firecharges everywhere on explosion."

I don't ... think Lux has a problem with people brewing potions, but I could be mistaken. ><     The only issue I would have with it is the same issue Rosseau mentioned - the perks for being an atheist would far outweigh those of belonging to a god. To be an atheist, you simply just don't pray to a god, but you don't get perks that way. Which ... I'm okay with, personally, since I'm not sure you should get perks for choosing to not participate in something,"

Yes, Leon is not guilty of the damned grief, but he is guilty of a damned raid, a damned death threat, a damned mutiny, and a damned murder.

TheRealmsMC,381yg1,littlebird16,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:20:20 2015 UTC,"The /tell issue as others have mentioned below was a hang up of switching over to the VPS and using Admin control panel we're using. I haven't looked at it fully as to why / how to fix, as it's more of a minor annoyance than anything major (/tells are still received by the recipient, just in Whisper messages rather than the fancy /r formatting you're used to.)   /msg still works and will put everything in the right formatting.     The leaves issue though... that's a little more tricky. For most of the leaves on the entire map are custom leaves, this means Minecraft doesn't read them as normal leaves and because of this their decay settings are turned off. It is possible for me to turn decay on for every single leaf on the map... however, this would leave all trees bare and barren and you'd be left with nothing but the trunk of trees. (It would also mean any and all player places leaves on the map would also start to decay, which would just mess up some peoples designs).   Yeah, it's highly annoying to have so many leaves, but using Shears will speed up the process in removing them, and I've been thinking about adding a Factory Recipes that uses leaves and turns 'em into something useful - maybe oak saplings or something? I dunno, hadn't thought it through much as in all honesty there is literally nothing I can do about the leaf situation without it messing other things up. We'd just be swapping 1 issue for a different one elsewhere."

TheRealmsMC,3813ys,TwistTheCat,12,Mon Jun 1 02:10:38 2015 UTC,"Britannia isn't aesthetic, it's progress and industry!  Buildings and ships go up haphazardly, stretching and expanding wherever there is room.    Beauty to us are the fine lines of a fast moving ship, or the steady hum of our factories.  The quick clicking of redstone lulls us to sleep at night.    Honestly, Ilara wins the architectural beauty award, hands down."
TheRealmsMC,3813ys,TinyEmperor,4,Mon Jun 1 02:16:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed on Ilara.   I would have to add that keeping 10+ members of a nation tied to a consistent structural design is quite difficult and more or less can kill the fun of building your own thing in the first place. Besides; many Britons take pride in their robust ships and sail away from home for quite some time, I know I'd rather live on my ship that in my home (I need to get around to making a new one more sizable for that)."
TheRealmsMC,3813ys,NaarbSmokin,3,Mon Jun 1 03:19:55 2015 UTC,Britannia is function over form. Ilara is form over function (though we do try to have useful roads).

TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,-1,Sun May 31 22:10:56 2015 UTC,"Hi, myself, Quan, and Ruhzzy were banned for this new rule change, we werent aware of this rule, and making a rule and then banning us while we havnt broken this rule is riduclous. and if we had broken the rule, we did it before it was a rule that was publicly known   We do have a nation, we live in Shotaku-Chi, and are building a home Quaksy was killed becaue when we told him we were dying and were about the lose everything he told us to ""fuck off"" we are attempting to assist with lore and have put time in professions.   If you're going to ban people, make sure they've broken a rule first, and dont make up a rule, then ban them seconds later"
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,14,Sun May 31 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"Ruhzzy was banned for responding ""Fuck you nigger"" to people when they were being nice and attempting to respond after you stole their boat. Saying ""Fuck the rules"" when questioned about their actions by the same people being nice. And Quan was banned for also being in this group and whose first interaction since signing in today was to steal someone stuff and respond with ""Thanks for the ship faggots.""   This is not a mature outlook on our server. This type of action is not okay. (Yourself, xxdarkroguexx, was banned for also responding with nigger in chat when questioning the person who happened to be in chat range of you; again, this server is of a much more mature nature and those things are not okay.)   If you want to Raid and have a nation, that is fine; this immature actions, interactions and insults directed at other players are neither welcome or acceptable.   If you're still interested in forming and interacting much more maturely with the community, then I'd suggest modmailing in a few days so that you can discuss this and your outlook, and intentions much more with the Moderation team.  The immaturity may be welcome on some servers, but it is not welcomed here :)"

TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,Melisandur,-5,Sun May 31 17:15:04 2015 UTC,"All i can gather from Zantids reply is that he is grabbing for straws trying to find reasons to ban players that dont agree with the personal biased views of the staff, because it's apparent that instead of a civ server, they are trying to run a sandbox where all their friends can play and build with no threat.   I guess I was wrong when i came looking for a civ server"
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,5,Sun May 31 17:19:28 2015 UTC,"You are right that you were wrong when you came looking for a civ server. This server was made to be a much more mature community, centered around a living world in which people could live and breath their own lore - with Nation Building and politics aspects thrown in to make your actions mean something, in the form of the consequences you're likely to receive from others."
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,Techsensai,-6,Sun May 31 17:28:14 2015 UTC,"So, in other words a building and RP server for kids who don't like the idea of realism, but want to pretend that they do, and kid themselves into thinking that they are playing a server with realism.

I no longer think replying to these comments of yours would further any situation, and again will ask you to send a modmail in a few days if you wish to readdress your banning situation; until then, getting drawn into an argument with you would serve no real purpose"

TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,8,Sun May 31 17:51:27 2015 UTC,You are not required to play here
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,Techsensai,-4,Sun May 31 17:35:56 2015 UTC,"But as mods, you're required to uphold the image of your server, something you've failed at, likely the 15 people a day average will never change if you continue to run a server in this way, should probably change the server to a creative towny server, with peaceful difficulty, since those are the only player types that would enjoy what you have created"
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,7,Sun May 31 17:39:07 2015 UTC,Is that why there are more people on Realms at the moment than CivEx ?
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,Dnessen,-9,Sun May 31 17:44:33 2015 UTC,Bother servers are failures as civ servers in that they ban all forms of raiding
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,3,Sun May 31 17:45:13 2015 UTC,So it's not allowed to insult someone?

It's not about the harshness of the language, it's about the social implication of the words in particular.    Call me a motherfucker all you want, but if you call me a faggot I'll be pissed.  Not because I don't want to be called gay.  But because I actually am a queer individual and you're using a slur against me.  You can't say shit like this and assume nobody is around to take offense.    I support banning for the use of slurs and derogatory language."

Although, in my opinion the mods should've spectated him for a while and if he would do it multiple times then I'd agree for his ban. Remember, I'm talking about daddo only. I agree that his comrades were a bit... troubling."

TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,lagiacrus2012,6,Sun May 31 17:57:51 2015 UTC,"That's ridiculous. You invest in a new player knowing, yes he may do stupid shit, and get banned; it generally isn't a good idea to give newfriends diamond armour as soon as they join.  The no immaturity rule is very clear to anyone who reads it, so you can't say his ban is unjustified."
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,novov,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:36:21 2015 UTC,2 things. 1 : I said that as a joke. 2 : I didn't give him that armor. They had it already when they joined us. They did however have diamonds that they had mined after they joined us and were about to give to us when they got banned. So I'm kinda pissed about that.
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,lagiacrus2012,-6,Mon Jun 1 16:07:00 2015 UTC,"I called Quan a nigger, i wasn't responding to anyone, we were joking around with eachother  At that time, quan and ruhzzy were the only people within chatrange of myself, so saying i was responding to someones question was an outright lie, as nobody asked me anything.  Unless you think Quan is unable to speak for himself and defend himself, let him decide if he was insulted  Edit: also, i wasn;t there when they stole the boat, Quan was picking up Ruhzzy who had just spawned, and the ""nigger"" replies were to them being overtly edgy and buttmad in chat from what i hear."
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,daddo69,7,Sun May 31 17:10:42 2015 UTC,"responding with nigger in chat when questioning the person who happened to be in chat range of you   I never said you were responding to a question, I said that you were questioning someone who was in chat range of you. You put ""."" in chat to find out someone was in range. You then said ""hi"" when you realised someone was in range, and you then said ""Nigger"" when this person did not respond.   Our logs clearly show that you were neither conversing with Quan through Tells/Msg's nor were you in local chat range of him at the time. This means your ""Nigger"" comment in chat, could not have been a joke between the two of you, nor directed at him."
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,The_Zantid,-8,Sun May 31 17:21:46 2015 UTC,"I said nigger because Quan was litteraly in range of me and i saw him swimming, and said nigger as a joke, he even said he was in range of me in TS. I put the ""."" so quan knew he was in the right spot  Unless you were in the TS at the whole period of time you dont have the right to act as if you knew specifically what we were doing and when, it was directly meant towards Quan  Edit: Just admit you banned me not for a rule break, but because you're afraid for your precious server, because its clear i have not broken any rules"

TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,Techsensai,3,Sun May 31 17:24:10 2015 UTC,"I mean this as respectfully as possible, but when is it going to end? The mod team, as people should be held to a higher standard than the rest of the community and therefore you should honor your statements. With that aside, I believe Rohan has become too economically strong through trading and the exploitation of glitches for its own good. You said that you are a group of nomads, but yet you participated in a raid, accepted other players into your nation, and to the blind eye, are an economic powerhouse full of wealth. Thats not what I believe Rohan should be, with that said, I could be wrong, I would like to communities input."
TheRealmsMC,37z2jh,NotYetASaint,3,Sun May 31 18:44:39 2015 UTC,"you participated in a raid   That was completely justified. Rohan was raided by the [later banned] PoisonedPig and joined in that raid, not as a political entity, but a party going there to apprehend the person that nearly grieved their land and stole a good amount of valuables. Afterwards, they got their stuff and left.   accepted other players into your nation   Who? Roos_, who has never been involved in politics ever? When is the last time she was on?   Techsensai's son? He left to St. Germain.  Senetrix? When was he last on. And from what I heard, he built a platform and left.  On top of that, has anyone seen them with a flair stating they are in Rohan?   the exploitation of glitches for its own good   What are you talking about? That is a high accusation.

TheRealmsMC,37zi6n,ekez_666,1 point,Sun May 31 19:04:57 2015 UTC,For diamond mining yep. If someone makes a Moria we will need somewhere to rely on. In addition we might be claiming a small bit of desert soon.
TheRealmsMC,37zi6n,Curlysnail,7,Sun May 31 21:22:05 2015 UTC,"Kitten you don't need to claim land like that. For example- All nations need iron and diamonds, but we don't go and claim all the places that spawn them. Why? Because it's greedy and pointless. No-one is going to recognise a mark on the map that you've said is yours unless it has significant development is done IE- If it's where your (main) city is. It's not how nations work. You have no control over that land and no-one will respect the claim. It's far away and needless.    I urge you to reconsider your claims so as to maintain good relations with other nations."
TheRealmsMC,37zi6n,ekez_666,2,Sun May 31 22:39:30 2015 UTC,"People respected Moria, I'm a bit paranoid.  But since you have persuaded me, I hereby remove all claims to any ice mountains."

At THIS point I told them to fuck off. While they were outside I never once used harsh language. Only when they entered without permission.

He came, I showed him around, gave him some armor, and we were super cool... and then for no reason he decides to draw a sword right in front of me and kill me! But I guess I wasn't prepared enough.

TheRealmsMC,37tkct,Finding_Red,1 point,Sat May 30 08:14:53 2015 UTC,What is considered griefing? Would placing all the blocks you steal be considering griefing?
TheRealmsMC,37tkct,submissivehealer,2,Sat May 30 08:14:46 2015 UTC,"Honestly, it depends on the situation. If I break blocks to find a snitch, find a snitch and destroy it and then replace all the blocks, then no. I think we've defined griefing as doing anything to the build that destroys the integrity of it. That could mean filling in Caelestis's hole in with lava, or it could mean ripping out all the grass blocks, because in both situations it destroys the intent and integrity behind the build."

TheRealmsMC,37v8qj,ImNotBanksy,0,Sat May 30 18:33:41 2015 UTC,I planned for free mining anyway. All I would do would charge access to the resort (taking up a small part of the island) and use it as a planned-LoN meeting place.

TheRealmsMC,37qx09,TheOldKitten,7,Fri May 29 18:00:01 2015 UTC,"I do not accept any claims on the volcanoes.  I stand for free, unclaimed access to both volcanoes due to their unique properties and mineral wealth.    I strongly recommend that you retract that claim."

The argument of ""I don't want others to take it so I'm taking it first."" is not an acceptable substitute.    If you want free mining, stand with me and be opposed to any claims to that island.  If I felt that claiming the volcano would be the only way to keep it open, Britannia would have claimed it long ago.    Also, far separate and distant claims of a brand new nation are greedy and ostentatious.  Make friends - start small."

We came to the conclusion that it would cause the game to be broken for two reasons. The first reason is pearls, imagine if you were pearled and someone mailed the pearl, that would cause problems, especially since the owner only can access the mailbox. The second reason was the elimination of player trade. We wanted to have the players interact when they trade for various reasons."

Going to do a multiple-ship stress test on Saturday during the Expo. One of their biggest advantages is to be mobile TNT cannons. The ""Destruction of another nation's buildings = Griefing"" style rule limits their usefulness in conflicts.  Note: I'm NOT advocating that this rule should be changed. They don't work with Citadel. Period.  So many of them get stolen... You basically have to hold still during transport.  If you have passengers, pray they don't log off. You can only autopilot in cardinal directions.

TheRealmsMC,37mppl,TinyEmperor,2,Thu May 28 21:35:09 2015 UTC,"I may be able to fix the ""Hold still during transport"" issue by delaying each teleport step during Cruise Mode. It'll need to be tested, but it's something I've wanted to look at for a while. It wasn't so bad on the old host, but I've noticed ships on cruise mode seem to move a lot faster for me on the VPS now than they did on the old box. (At least ships with not so many blocks do) EDIT: Also, thoughts on increasing the ""Rmove:"" capabilities on normal sailing vessels to allow the chance to make more complex maneuvers as a mere sign click?

Long story short, there is a small memory leak in the plugin. The fix is going onto the server now, and we'll see how it does, and if it doesn't fix it, I'll be working on it all day tomorrow. This is a priority for me, don't worry.     It is, however, a gradual thing. It doesn't cause massive spikes, so I'm not sure that this is the reason you've been getting spikes. I will just say that the server has been doing fantastic compared to the other server. We were using over 100% CPU on the other server, and I don't think we've gone over 50% on the new server, and we've never gone above 50% of the RAM used, either.

It could've used some more useless info like government, religion, general food y'all eat, etc. So suck it up and if you want, go hard as shit on the building competition and win that."

What I've done is my attempt at a really quick fix - Water now is worth 1/8th the temperature that it was beforehand. It's my hope that this fixes the water issue. I also changed the snow value so that it is worth a bit more. I agree that there is an issue if you died and it's as erratic as has been mentioned.    Beforehand, wearing no armor at all reduced your temperature by -6 - I'm changing that to -4.      Lastly, changing the threshold of ""bad"" and ""good"" temperatures to 50/70/90 (up/down by ten for cold/hot)       And I'll still give you the sulfur you came down for, no worries about the glowstone. :c"

TheRealmsMC,37fec4,Melisandur,2,Thu May 28 05:24:52 2015 UTC,"I can confirm this. Not sure if it's a glitch or if someone's been tinkering and it had a bad side effect. As I was traveling on a boat across the sea to Braavos, with no armor, I dropped down to -53 degrees in very little time. Moreover, I found a nether portal and went inside in a desperate attempt to quickly warm back up but being in the nether for 10 minutes had absolutely no effect on my temperature and I was still at -53 when I came back out. I found a little shelter in the overworld filled with torches and borrowed some leather pants and still didn't warm up. It took a relog to fix the issue.  My friend was also experiencing burning up in the cold. He was spawn hopping and ended up in the northern ice fields and somehow his temperature skyrocketed into the 100s and wouldn't come down. He killed himself to respawn elsewhere and it was fixed.  Not really sure what's up with that. Hopefully the devs can get on it soon."

If you keep the farm open to the public, I'll have no problems with your claim.  That island is super small though, only enough room for one large building!  Now, if someone posted claim signs / no trespassing signs, I think those should be respected.  The game happens on the server, the forum is for announcing things that have happened in the game.  In fact, I'm in the process of buying an island from Ilara that never had a claims post."

TheRealmsMC,37eyht,Ehini,3,Wed May 27 03:32:10 2015 UTC,"Well at the same time a claim is just a social construct. Claiming something doesn't automatically give you rights. Actually settling is the first step to legitimizing a claim. If someone else has builds/a farm there they have already settled it.   But all of these things aside: a claim is only as strong as your ability to defend it. If whoever already lives there can repel you, no amount of shading the map matters. And likewise, if you can oust them no amount of history on the land matters."
TheRealmsMC,37eyht,NaarbSmokin,2,Wed May 27 14:39:29 2015 UTC,My hope is that axus won't mind as long as we leave his farm (if it is there) intact.
TheRealmsMC,37eyht,TinyEmperor,1 point,Wed May 27 15:16:15 2015 UTC,We could always claim the entire island except his farm.

Quite simply I was the one who release poisonedpig from his pearl after catching him stealing from people the first time. Then within a few days, the person I had previously just let free, is out killing innocents, and newfriends to the server.   That's on me. I let him out, it's my mess to clean up. Andre, couldn't really give a damn about. Never met them in game and don't really care. But it was clear PoisonedPig was working with Andre and thus Andre became an attack on sight target for me, knowing that if I went to clean up my mess of letting Pig free, andre, if with Pig, would likely defend him.   That's the purest and most simplest reason for me to be there that I can possibly give.    Pearled Pig Let Pig out because he's ""reformed"" Pig kills newfriend to the server Go and hunt pig down to pearl him again   Simples."

You join a war as you wish, and since there's no rules in place to stop that, I can't really complain.   If you raid half the server, what do you expect?  To draw from blatant real-life history, when the German's moved troops into Belgium (a defenseless, entirely neutral country) in 1914, Britain and other European nations mobilized against German forces, because an aggressor was disturbing the peace. Similarly, you have raided Hanaq and Hubbard, neither are particularly wealthy or greedy nations.   As for roleplay, to raid several nations and stay alive, guerilla tactics are needed. You cannot proclaim your own base of operations and not expect everyone you raided to come over and kick your ass there.   Secondly, alliances. If you attack a member of an alliance, it's not impossible that the entire alliance will come down on you.   You raided/killed:   Britannian citizens St. Germain citizens Hanaq Hubbard Mikoto and others I;m sure I don't know about.   When all these forces, and their friends, retaliate, WHAT were you expecting? Everyone to play fair? No, you pissed off most of the server and you're whining about it now that the whole server has decided to deal with your shit.  /rant"

It's another thing to just spend the majority your (non-pearled or banned) time murdering, thieving, and whining.    Your got a creative response that was perfectly matched for your creative input on this server.  Near zero.  I suspect support for your decisions will also match that as well.    Go read the last week's worth of CivEx subreddit if you want to see what happens when people just join to raid and destroy for the lolz and then try to explain their actions were part of some greater story or plan.  You can't retroactively try to color your actions in a better light.

Murdering and thieving is exactly what a viking does is it not? They trade aswell but eh, people weren't active enough to do that effectively.  When did I whine about anything?

If you think that murdering and raiding is all you need to create a nation, roleplay, establish an identity, and enrich the server, then it sounds like you have low expectations and should be happy for the treatment you received during your pearling.

I have issue that he has complained of uniting a large group of players against him as somehow ""disrespectful"" and not enough roleplay and other such themes.  I called him out on that.

Britannia because their dude was pearled, and the Mikoto Empire because we let it be known that we'd declare war on him if he broke his contract. All of those other guys, while at the time were helpful, had no reason to be there."

I understand you might have wanted your own little private war, but Andre's actions spread beyond Mikoto.  I didn't even need to spin up Britannia for war this time.

With these two, I think we can add more to lore and such. Seems great!  A suggestion I have though is if there could be a way for players to give each other exp (minus exp bottles), that way the Researcher could do the enchanting and get his profession exp."
TheRealmsMC,37c9u2,IronWolf209,1 point,Tue May 26 18:50:09 2015 UTC,They look cool to me. Specially if you can modify the way the npc's talk in game. Maybe talking about the gods or past wars and battles. Stories. Maybe even when you click on certain ones they tell you how to get some where. Definally need stronger mobs to kill.
TheRealmsMC,37c9u2,Candlepup,1 point,Tue May 26 19:53:16 2015 UTC,"I think I have to say no to the Citizens plugin. Just feels kinda weird on this kind of server, which is so driven by players interacting with each other.  But the MythicMobs plugin seems AWESOME. Zantid said he was working on something like it or modifying it or what have you, and I'm super looking forward to that. I want a giant death horse boss or small tamable dragons or something. Maybe. I don't know how much editing can be done, haha.  But yes, more diseases! Scary diseases, sneaky diseases, ones that can be carried by some people without showing symptoms and stuff like that. Again, I don't know how much can be done with that plugin, but hopefully something cool like that could be achieved. Maybe it could tie into immunity."
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,submissivehealer,6,Tue May 26 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"The worldbuilder in me obviously chooses Tawantinsuyu for an amazing in depth look into their nation. All the facets they explore makes you see into their world.  All of those who said theirs was too long, shame on you! It is an outstanding look into their life, if it had been more organized into sub-paragraphs, it surely would have all the points."
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,RaxusAnode,1 point,Tue May 26 19:21:15 2015 UTC,They have Salinas origin story too xD

TheRealmsMC,37chkk,isaao12,5,Tue May 26 18:26:20 2015 UTC,"My vote if course goes to Tawantinsuyu, for their depth is exactly what we need with the lore! However, I think brevity is also important in order to not intimidate players who may be considering the server. Maybe there should also be a more condensed version for each nation?"
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,RedditGuy119,3,Wed May 27 04:20:11 2015 UTC,Sympathy vote for midrous
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,NOTredtao,2,Wed May 27 07:11:13 2015 UTC,But we r friends and we have no votes either :(

TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Quasky,3,Wed May 27 07:47:04 2015 UTC,I liked the Tawantinsuyu one. Despite the name of the nation being super hard for me to read.
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,lapendon,3,Tue May 26 17:48:19 2015 UTC,I like the lore of Tawantinsuyu. Long and detailed .

TheRealmsMC,37chkk,lagiacrus2012,3,Tue May 26 23:33:53 2015 UTC,My vote goes to Tawantinsuyu. Good lord.
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Dnessen,2,Wed May 27 03:25:43 2015 UTC,"So hard to choose. But I think that St.Germains lore is just a little better then Salinas and Midrous. Shōtaku-chi (me) has barely any lore (plz forgive me, I wrote it 1 day before going on vacation and the guy who posted it was supposed to add a little about our government and religion) and Tawantisuyu's lore is kinda boring and hard to read. So St.Germain it is! Edit : I think St.Germain will be first, Midrous second and Salinas third. I have no faith in myself lol"
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,lagiacrus2012,2,Tue May 26 17:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yay, although I have to say, your lore was one of the better. I thought my lore stunk haha, since I'm not the best at writing stuff like that."
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Dnessen,2,Tue May 26 17:09:08 2015 UTC,"But my lore is super short, how is it good? XD I mostly did it so people heard the name Shōtaku-chi. We don't have many members and I hope new players would consider joining us this way."
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,lagiacrus2012,2,Tue May 26 17:12:55 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed that it was different from others, more of a story of your leaderships rise to power."
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Dnessen,2,Tue May 26 17:14:42 2015 UTC,"It's a story about an ancestor of our current Emperor, Ceadeus8 or Ceadeus the 8th. I'm planning on writing more stories of his ancestors and his family line :D"
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,lagiacrus2012,2,Tue May 26 17:17:11 2015 UTC,Nice haha
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Dnessen,2,Tue May 26 17:18:14 2015 UTC,I want to make a library. I look forward to the day I have my first book lol I still need to build the library and get books.
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,littlebird16,2,Tue May 26 17:21:29 2015 UTC,"Well, then I also have my project of Aeon City which has a massive library, the city I believe that I have in single player is almost as large as Caelestis."
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Ehini,2,Tue May 26 17:28:04 2015 UTC,"Our city is tiny because I am the only one who built a house lol. We do have watch towers and a giant pagoda, but that one is on the mountain pretty far from the town."

Edit : If the voting ends like this, does Shōtaku-chi get third place? Edit 2 : it should be Shōtaku-chi : 0 (2?) since Dnessen said our lore was one of the better =P. Edit 3 : just looked at the map and Shōtaku-chi needs that altar the most (no offense, just saying) since we're very far from the currently, only known altar to Terra while St.Germain is a lot closer to it, Tawantinsuyu is right next to a freacking temple of Lux and so is Salinas. Midrous would have no use for winning since they apparently don't worship an existing God. But it doesn't matter cus we won't win anyway, I'm too bad in lore-writing <3"
TheRealmsMC,37chkk,Dnessen,1 point,Tue May 26 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I need the alter for my lore kek, and theres a alter of Terra on the northern continent, you just need to look in the jungles."

TheRealmsMC,379zhf,Melisandur,5,Tue May 26 02:01:29 2015 UTC,"The Arts  The arts are highly valued in Tawantinsuyu, and both the Temple of Lux and individuals within the city act as patrons. The most common avenues of artwork in Tawantinsuyu are magnificent creations of blown glass, an art which has been perfected in the area beyond anything in the rest of the world. A complex pump is used by the most prominent glass blowers that can breathe great gusts of air at controlled rates and volumes, allowing for the creation of glass structures as large as buildings. Using the red sands of the Intamqa Mountains, the artists of Tawantinsuyu have also created a type of glass much more resilient than the standard quality, able to withstand forces and pressures that would shatter glass form other areas. Given its unique strength comparable to clay bricks, this red stained glass is often used in construction throughout the city.  Other common types of art in Tawantinsuyu are murals created from dried and decorated cuts of colored clay, and statues carved and polished from the local granite, and then painted with colors derived from powder of the colored clays. In all their art, the people of Tawantinsuyu are known for utilized an incredibly broad spectrum of colors within every piece, always bright and vibrant, and notably reflected in their dress as well.  Moving towards the performing arts, Tawanitian culture does not have a strong culture of theatre outside the religious realm where song and dance are combined to tell religious stories, but music, especially vocal music, is incredibly popular and covers all topics of life. No individual is afraid to raise their voice to the sky during any time of day, though poor singers may be asked to be quiet late at night. The music of Tawantinsuyu is known for its vibrant and dancing melodies, often in a major key, and characterized by a fast tempo and loud volume. By the time of adulthood the average Tawanitian can join in hundreds of songs known by all in the country, as well as many specific to their trade or family traditions. Walking through the city during a sunny day is a joy to behold, as the entire city is often caught up in the songs of their trade, and it is rare to find a citizen not gifted in the ways of the voice compared to the average citizen of other nations."

This is an amazing piece of lore, and as someone who was introduced to this kind of server via r/worldbuilding, I am a massive geek over this stuff and I must congratulate you. It's detailed yet concise and still just feels good to read. It's not at all boring to me! No epic tale, but satisfying nonetheless.  The cuisine part had me drooling though...   The traditional common man meal of the nation is a thick palm sized role stuffed with spiced pork, often accompanied with a traditional jam, not unlike spiced apple chutney. A platter of the roles would be served to a group accompanied by pitchers of fresh milk sweetened with honey, and often mixed with liquor, the entire pitcher chilled by keeping it in the river much of the morning before the traditional shared midday meal.   PUT IT IN MY MOUTH."

TheRealmsMC,3790tw,InsanePigeon,2,Mon May 25 22:12:07 2015 UTC,War was only declared because he broke his contract and we felt it right to act on it.

TheRealmsMC,376t8j,CreeperWithShades,2,Mon May 25 10:16:23 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately a boat city isn't really practical. The lag is way too high when ships of large sizes manoeuvre, and you can't breed animals or grow anything on the boat due to realistic biomes. Also, every time a boat moves, it flashes for a bit - not a very pleasant experience, I'd say.  If you have a way to properly solve those issues, and give me bit more info about your nation (e.g. a flag) then I'll happily join."
TheRealmsMC,376t8j,novov,2,Mon May 25 10:31:40 2015 UTC,"I'd assume you'd only move it from time to time. And for growth, wheat grows fine in a river biome, and lots of the ""oceans"" are actually rivers."

TheRealmsMC,376t8j,NOTredtao,2,Mon May 25 10:52:08 2015 UTC,Also you cannot lock chest on a ship and when you log out on a ship you are not piloting and it moves you spawn back at where it were
TheRealmsMC,376t8j,TinyEmperor,1 point,Mon May 25 10:59:26 2015 UTC,"Spawn where you were is where you logged off right? I'll probably take care about moving the  ship then. If I do move the ship with people logged off, they can drown them selves an respawn at their bed on the ship (crew signs) As for chests, I don't think itll be easy to raid us at sea, but if we are raided, the chests will be hidden."
TheRealmsMC,376t8j,The_Zantid,2,Mon May 25 11:04:42 2015 UTC,"I actually gave this some thought before the server started before settling on Britannia.    The biggest issue is people logging off and on, especially dropping during transit.  How can you move the city without all of your members remaining online during transit?  Not to mention the issue of trying to move such a massive ship (There's currently a 3k block limit to ships)  Here's my best suggestion:    I'd actually recommend your boat city be composed of individual pieces that are working boats - one for each member.  You can easily connect them into a floating city or detach them in case someone needs to log off.  That way they can log off and catch up to reconnect later, or perhaps if they need to travel somewhere.  Remember that Ships don't actually need to look like ships, they can look like a house and road too!    Instead of hiding your chests in the ships, you can also bury your valuables nearby every time you anchor down for a period of time."

Maybe it is a matter of Citadel understanding that only 1 of the two chest 'blocks' are protected when you apply the protection, instead of the entire chest itself?"
TheRealmsMC,375wzr,Ehini,1 point,Mon May 25 06:54:21 2015 UTC,"That is why mkes no sense. Emerald wouldn't be special, it would behave exactly like the other reinforcement materials, according to the code,  which leads me to believe that something is off or the statement was a slight hyperbole (or emeralds weren't tested).

TheRealmsMC,375l6d,Ehini,3,Mon May 25 02:22:28 2015 UTC,I'm going to have to agree with Rident on this.

Griefing is considered anything that destroys players design."" Copied from the rules So in this case the books were taken from a book shelf that make an area look like a library. Our intent with this rule is to prevent damage to players design. They designed the library with the bookshelves which is where you got the books from.  And actually this is rule three: ""No griefing except what is necessary to raid chest"" You did not need to break the book shelf to get to any chests. Can't get much clearer than that."
TheRealmsMC,375l6d,Techsensai,2,Mon May 25 02:54:10 2015 UTC,"I think the rules should be revised then and include luxury items, such as enchantment table setups.

Edit: Just to clarify, I don't think bombing of a windmill classifies as 'looking for snitches'."

However, once it's done - in theory you guys won't notice any change in how you sign in to the server, or the TS, or visit the website.

TheRealmsMC,36w3cr,ImNotBanksy,1 point,Fri May 22 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"It's technically part of the way Spigot renders its chunks (Spigot of course being the server type we have to run for 1.8). I'm pretty sure it has a lot to do with the anti-xraying portion of the Spigot internal code and configs. We just haven't found a better way to do this yet. I mean there is the obvious Orebfuscator plugin, but its 1.8 implementations have so far had a lot of buggy reports. It's something I've wanted to put up and try and see how it goes, but have wanted to wait until we had better resources at our disposal before adding in an extra source of potential lag :(  EDIT: Our current hosting is limited mainly by CPU rather than our RAM - so while we'll be upping the ram to 8gigs, truthfully it's not all that needed (apart from when someone coughLionheartcough is using giant ass ships lol). The CPU free up for having a dedicated machine rather than a shared hosting solution should be a pretty big leap in terms of performance.

TheRealmsMC,36uqeg,lapendon,1 point,Fri May 22 22:32:31 2015 UTC,The path of your road takes it up and very close to Rohan - our Nation which I am very happy about. But it appears it will not be able to be a strait road as it gets up near us. I was kind of wondering the path you were planning on having it take because I would not mind at all it going through our nation but the landscape gets really interesting near us making this an interesting challenge. Would you be able to draw the path you were planning on the road to take on a map? I am assuming turns would be 90deg instead of some sort of curved or diagonal path.

Fulgur asks of us to sacrifice Iron pickaxes and eggs (He also asks for carrots however this doesnt work because the ID for the carrot is different from the one he asks for- Admins halp pls) however nothing really happens if you dont apease him, he's pretty laid back. Worshiping at the alter gives you free holy bacon, which sometimes gives you speed boosts of invunrability for a short time. Fulgur hates spiders and occasionaly if you kill them he gives you some speed/stregnth bonuses. Fulgur also hates carrots, and if you eat them he sets angry, god-like dogs on you to kill you.    It is enough however to hold the belief in Fulgur, as we need more belivers in this world! Once our nations grow, perhapse we can arrange transport for you to easily access the alter- Hanaq will eventually have a airship airforce able to ferry you guys over :)    Have fun playing, and praise Fulgur!"

Everything else is pretty low and will raise your temperature at most 8 degrees, (14 in full leather) but generally around five or six. I also changed it so that wearing no armor reduces your temperature, which we currently do not have.     I concur that the nether should be difficult, but if it makes things impossible, that's bad too. :("
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,ArsenalOwl,1 point,Thu May 21 23:27:11 2015 UTC,"Well I'll tell you this: I've spent the last two days mostly in the nether, collecting materials. The only time that I would say my temperature made things even close to impossible was when I was actively working around lava.   Otherwise things are just a bit more difficult. You have to rest occasionally(nausea) and move slower. If we had water bottles we could take with us, though, it would keep the same difficulty, but allow us to prepare for it."

I personally love the system and the risk it provides, as well as the inclusion of disease cures and the ability to choose to be a medic or what have you, even if just for RP purposes. It's all good to me.  While the temp system isn't perfect at all, I love it. No human could realistically carry around an inventory of logs out in the desert sun. Desert cultures all over the world know it's best to rest and stay indoors in the heat of the day and do most of the work at dawn, dusk, and at times in the night. Even then, the desert is a bitter rival, because without the sun there's nothing to hold heat and it can drop to freezing.  Anyway yes, keep all the things and improve them."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,RaxusAnode,3,Thu May 21 23:55:50 2015 UTC,"I personally feel like both the disease and temperature plugins are a nice addition to the server. Yeah, initially they can be frustrating and make you want to ragequit, but I think figuring out how to work around it is the fun part. It encourages members to work together as well. Nothing says teamwork like applying a stint to the Emperor's leg when he falls off the temple and breaks an ankle.   My biggest qualm would have to be the fact that dying erases any disease completely. It kind of makes the plugin obsolete. We at the Mikoto Empire are very attractive to the Pox disease and have acquired it multiple times. However, before we started trading with Ilara regularly for melons, we would just kill ourselves and start all over again. While I do like the fact that I can come back to life refreshed and normal, it definitely takes away from the reality associated with catching diseases."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,TinyEmperor,1 point,Fri May 22 01:15:43 2015 UTC,"Dying clears out your XP, but more importantly it erases the distance you covered while going on an adventure.  I figure most diseases are picked up travelling.  I'd be all for having death reset your sickness level to 1, and continue from there, in exchange for making most diseases non-fatal :D"
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,Dnessen,5,Fri May 22 14:54:14 2015 UTC,"Diseases and temperature are an immediate and positive addition, here are the reasons why:  Diseases and temperature provide realism.  Everything in real life wants to kill you. Walking down the street in real life, you could be killed by any number of things. These two plugins are really cool and provide immersion.  Temperature and disease add an additional level of roleplay and immersion to Spera.  Because of the Mikotese Pox pandemic they continuously battle, that nation consistently trades Ilara for melon seeds and other cures. This fact here provides a deeper level of roleplaying and history to nations' history.   Ilara struggled with mobs, overheating (czardeath, hahaha) and other setbacks and that is a part of our history. It has made us grow and marks us as survivors.  The Plugins make Spera seem unique to other worlds/servers  Pretty self explanatory. You log into the Realms MC and immediately see the Temperature and Disease box and know that this isn't your everyday server. This is unique to this civilization experience. This makes the world that much more difficult and immersive.     Suggestions to improve the disease and temperature plugins  Enable immunity  Adding the ability to grow immune and tolerance systems will reduce a lot of the grinding that diseases and temperature could bring. For example, after weeks of playing, players who live in consistently hotter environments (like the desert) should be able able to wear iron in that biome and not have a temperature of 9001.   Enable vaccines  There have been entire corporations established who are interested in creating the vaccines. It'd be cool to make incurable diseases that players have to get the vaccines for.   Create more interesting world-specific diseases  I think people are already getting bored of the diseases that have been there since day one because there was no real challenge after we learned the basic cures. If we had vaccines like the suggestions above, maybe even make it like brewing where you have to take time to experiment in alchemy to find cures, there would be a revitalization in this plugin.  Please don't just upvote or downvote, tell the mods/admins why you agree or disagree."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,ArsenalOwl,3,Thu May 21 23:50:03 2015 UTC,"Playing with diseases is divided into two time periods:    1: You don't have a cure.  Life sucks and you die. Goodbye XP. Want that nice enchantment?  Better stay home so you don't catch anything. 2: You have a cure.  You go take the cure and you're back to normal.  You don't care about it, unless you're wasting your time travelling back home to get a cure.    Diseases add nothing fun about the game in either period.  The one strong point is that it gives another advantage to large nations since they can manufacture cures for their citizens.  Which allows their citizens to enchant more."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,RaxusAnode,3,Thu May 21 22:59:10 2015 UTC,What about the third group that plans on giving out vaccines to new nations that would otherwise be crippled ?
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,NerdOctopus,2,Thu May 21 23:30:13 2015 UTC,I think that one advantage is the reason disease should stay. It should be hard to survive on your own.
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,Sharpcastle33,1 point,Thu May 21 23:18:16 2015 UTC,"I agree. It makes people work together. And as Sharpest of Castles XXXIII, it also acts as bad guy deterrent."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,NerdOctopus,1 point,Fri May 22 00:06:35 2015 UTC,"We already have incentives to group with things like raiders, citadel and especially factories.  We don't need something that griefs you on the idiotic pretense of realism or added difficulty."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,TinyEmperor,1 point,Thu May 21 23:49:48 2015 UTC,Imo it's a raider deterrent...
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,RaxusAnode,1 point,Fri May 22 00:00:06 2015 UTC,"What it is is a nuisance.  It matters less to raiders who only need to kill themselves and bedspawn than it does to players who have experience that they want to keep more often than the former.  The only thing it deters is new players who say, oh?  I get crippled now because of RNG, through no fault of my own?  That's never fun in any game."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,axusgrad,1 point,Fri May 22 01:07:14 2015 UTC,"It sounds very much like you dislike diseases. :P Let's say I get rid of that. Would you have as many issues with me keeping temperature? Maybe making it so that coldness slows you down and that heat gives you hunger, so there's still a punishment for going over/under by a lot, but not like diseases?"
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,Candlepup,4,Thu May 21 23:19:36 2015 UTC,"Diseases can discourage new players because there's basically no way a new player can survive them.  Hi, welcome to the server.  Thanks for exploring a bit. TIME TO DIE!   Realistic?  Yes!  Friendly to newfriends?  Hell, no!  They don't even know the command to find out what is killing them!  Let's not even talk about how they won't have a cure.    Temperature effects are better because there are more ways to mitigate the symptoms and they aren't automatically fatal.  And for armor: it's a trade off for temperature.  It's like that eternal debate about how to encourage armor diversity."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,axusgrad,1 point,Thu May 21 23:39:13 2015 UTC,"Disease didn't discourage you. It didn't discourage me. It didn't discourage any of us. You learned. You persevered. And that is what makes this place different.  We want long time players, not just anyone."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,Candlepup,2,Fri May 22 00:04:25 2015 UTC,"Hmm, how about ice water bottles; it would make a nice market for ice.    I think Jungle and Desert should have a max temperature that doesn't kill you, only causes the nausea/slow effect.  It's kind of a fair system in Nether and Volcano for what you can get there.  Diseases should be non-fatal but annoying.  The rate of infection seems about right, and it does encourage being near civilization in general.  But if its fatal, it really limits exploration.  Realistic but not fun.  ""Annoying"" isn't fun either, but having medical facilities is pretty cool."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,RaxusAnode,1 point,Thu May 21 23:32:30 2015 UTC,"Hmm... I can agree with the jungle not being able to kill you on temperature alone. It's hot in jungles, but it's also humid, so dehydration isn't as much of an issue as it is in deserts. The bugs and diseases are what you have to worry about. But I have to disagree with the desert temperature not killing you. Deserts are brutal and dehydration is a serious risk. The sun beats down on you and there is no shade. In the outback of Australia, a fit man out in the desert with no water can die within a day.  Additionally, I think diseases should still be fatal. You can get used to being annoyed and desensitize yourself to it. There's real risk that comes with dying, though. I get that it isn't fun to die either but I think it's an important risk to run. It just makes you have to consider stuff."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,ImNotBanksy,1 point,Thu May 21 23:51:40 2015 UTC,"I hear you on deserts, though the rewards maybe should be increased. I haven't mined in deserts, but it sounded so-so compared to what you can get from volcanoes and diamond-rich biomes.  Spawn more iron there, and it would be good.  The risk of dying does make you consider stuff, but there's not enough reward to balance that risk (for most people).  Annoying symptoms only would be enough for me to seek out a cure, but not enough to stop me from exploring on my own, I can't see myself becoming desensitized to slowness and weakness.  I'd be OK with leaving disease as is for now, seeing how it plays out, but my current feelings are to nerf it."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,toastiertadpole,1 point,Fri May 22 00:04:12 2015 UTC,"I would just amp up the rewards, yes. Though I'm not sure if they can change the Oregen now..."

TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,toastiertadpole,2,Thu May 21 23:51:51 2015 UTC,"I don't have much of a problem with diseases, just getting naseated based on temperature.  As others have mentioned in this thread, armor reacts way too quickly and strongly to temperature. Living in the roofed forest is a damned nightmare because of this.  We moved there because of how our Pagoda looks inside the forest, but it's a brutal life. Mobs were thick as thieves, so we cleared out the trees and torched it up. Then we found that wearing more than one piece of armor in and around our castle nauseates us to an impossible level. So we took our armor back off. Zombies must breed like rabbits in our forest, because despite the ground being torched up, swarm at us on an almost daily basis. And usually, this horde is on fire.  So that gives us an annoying catch 22. Either wear armor and get sick beyond belief, or don't wear anything and catch fire fighting an angry horde."
TheRealmsMC,36t6gw,NaarbSmokin,1 point,Thu May 21 23:47:37 2015 UTC,"Get the temperature out. Keep the diseases! temperature can be annoying when in the nether and just wearing armor raises it so high. i'm not a fan. xD but diseases should be possible to get everywhere. In Britannia were all healthy Brits when you know we could be getting the plague. It shouldn't be possible to just stay in the perfect land with no diseases. Or you could just make temperature only really rise when diseases are major and just keep the temperature with lowered effects with armor, light, and all that good stuff."

Gold is going to be valuable in multiple things with professions so you really shouldn't be so heavily undervaluing your primary resource. You have a lot of it, others don't. Don't screw yourself over in the long term by offering a RIDICULOUS exchange rate between diamonds and gold. You're practically throwing away your most valuable resource... Please remember this server is going to be running for months, over a year. You may have a lot of gold now but you may not in 8 months, or others who replace you."

TheRealmsMC,36no07,_sar,1 point,Wed May 20 19:01:44 2015 UTC,"I don't think you should use reinforcement as the way to compare value. I've been able to trade gold at almost a 1:1 ratio for diamonds with others, and at most 1 diamond:5 gold. Just off the top of my head anyone breeding horses is going to be needing TONS of gold because you need to make golden carrots and golden apples. Don't tie the value of your resources to something external that is set for you, see what you can get from people on a semi-individual level because each person is going to value your product differently. Try and get the most out of your most valuable resource as possible. Remember what happened when OPEC decided not to control the amount of oil on the market? The price dropped by more than half. Giving away gold for that hugely unbalanced ratio just harms the value of gold as soon as you trade lots of it away, especially if you're worried about others not needing it too much. It hurts it in the long term, and it hurts others who also rely on gold as a valuable export xP"

If the map is not to be updated, we also lay claim to the river via an in-game border fence, as noted by this post.  It should be noted that according to this map's claim, we technically don't own the land that our beautiful cathedral to Ellatrix sits on. :P  Hopefully this can solve any discrepancies.

TheRealmsMC,36jeqw,Curlysnail,-1,Wed May 20 10:31:43 2015 UTC,"Alright I'll respond to this piece by piece since I haven't gone into detail very much on the claims posts.  Let me preface the following by saying that Brauden as a whole seeks to unite the surrounding area under a common banner to ensure cooperation between a greater amount of peoples.  People united are stronger and are able to accomplish much more.  Of course, we seek to do this primarily through a diplomatic means, and only when we believe we have a just cause.  So, I'll discuss each on a case by case basis:  Anvilmar- abandoned by its owners.  I did not see any objection from Anvilmar or Bravos at the time of even since.  We have already started repairing the area as it has been griefed.  If you have any concerns still, feel free to voice them.  Krossavik- this is the only claim you might consider ""aggressive"".  I don't take kindly to those who raid as the server is being established, and indeed Brauden is not a nation who defends those who prey on the weak.  Krossavik and her two citizens were no exception, and the land was taken from someone who gave up their rights to the kingdom when they showed their true colors those first few days.  Blades- didn't claim it.  Map error.  Scythia- the owners also abandoned it.  We're to use the land as easy access to the canal and to Krossavik.  All of the territories that we have actually claimed will be put to use, not wasted.  They all have value to us, we aren't claiming it to keep it away from others.   We don't claim land inhabited by others unless we have reason.  Why wouldn't I ask if someone still inhabits an area before I claim it?  I hope this clears up most issues."

We don't force people to pray at the Altar, nor do we expect them to... but some people have, and they've used it all as a starting point for the Lore and reason for some of the builds and policies of their Nation.

Overcoming it doesn't get you anything, it just returns you to a state that you should have been at from the start.  It doesn't have any benefits, only negatives."

For a majority of the players I would think they enjoy being crippled and having to find rare resources just to return to a normal game state.  I would maybe be happy if you could reverse engineer things to give you buffs, but as it is all it does now is screw you over."

I saw that Lux had a power of 50 but barely an hour later it was 44. In my opinion their power should depend on how many followers a God has, what their prayer power is, how spread out the followers are (bedspawns?) and that their power should increase or decrease when a follower dies (to a mob, to a player that doesn't follow a God or to a player who follows a God) or when a follower is victorious over another player. The power should also only decrease by 1 point per week if the God is weak and 1 point per day if the God is strong."

Our canal to the river is only eight high in the first place, and any ship thin enough to navigate the river wouldn't be too high anyway.  Besides, we definitely don't want to obstruct your building.    I'll see if I can get a ship to the river, and if I can, I'll check it's height.    I may make a dedicated river boat, or downsize the one I just built for that purpose."

TheRealmsMC,3698m3,The_Zantid,2,Sun May 17 14:20:46 2015 UTC,"Civcraft has only just updated to 1.8.3 (By just I mean literally yesterday :P) Since these guys are the authors of a lot of the kick ass plugins we use - we're extremely please to see this: but it means that there are still going to be bugs. In fact, we aren't using their 1.8 version of PrisonPearl due to how it wouldn't run properly a good week or so ago on our server - Instead we had to hacker-date the 1.7 Prison Pearl plugin to get it to work on 1.8 Spigot while we waited for a solution.   Now that they're up to 1.8.3 and hit a release, we can start putting together those plugin .jars and building them ourselves from their github and getting everything to run nicely. (In theory) - but in so doing we have to be careful of whether the jump from the 1.8 Spigot we're on, to the 1.8.3 is going to break anything else plugin wise or any of our other plugins which may not have ""official"" 1.8.3 releases but may or may not work.   It's a bitch. But I've had 3 hour sleep in the last 30hrs to build, compile and otherwise write around a couple of Start up Exceptions we're getting - but the simple matter is we're working as hard as we can: and in the meantime this is our temporary fix via tempbans to keep these people from harming others when they've been hunted down and pearled by the community in general.   There is no easy or quick fix here. This isn't as simple as changing a couple lines of config and it miraculously working. This stuff is pure java based - and narrowing down those issues and testing fixes can only be done at a specific pace: no matter if we work all night or not."

I thought I had fixed prison Pearl and I had not. I fucked up.   I apologize that this is not what happened with you, with c83, or with Hippo, or with LionHeart. Unfortunately all I can do is learn from those mistakes and keep going forward. We hope to have prison pearl fixed as soon as possible.     I'm sorry for the inconsistency."

What is the point of a ""nation"" or ""Politics"" if that nation is constantly safe? What is the point of Roleplay or Lore if we don't allow any of that to be developed? If we look at other Civilization servers. How many amazing things can we see from the interactions of players? WWI, WWII, The pearling of people entering others lands, the killing of people for not paying a toll at a river. Are some of these things dick moves? Yes. They are. Which is why the power is in your hands to go and pay these people a visit and kill them.      Why we think random killing is a dick move  This isn't a Factions Server. This isn't a coolPvP server. You don't sign in here just to slaughter everyone you see. This isn't Dayz. We implore players to have a reason for their actions. A motive for their cause. A Character in which they play. A lore in which they've surrounded themselves upon. Maybe if people didn't focus so much on how CzarDeath is making dick moves in game? Someone could write a book about the notorious pirate CzarDeath who plagued the server until a valiant group of men joined forces to hunt him down and keep him forever locked in the end - each paying a part of their gold income to ensure he never again sees the light of day again...   But at the same time, if someone signs in for the single purpose as to make another player's time on the server feel shit, and unenjoyable. That's not okay. And we feel that shouldn't be a thing on our server; however, the question is... who decides when that person crosses the line? At which point does it step from raiding to just being an asshole who needs to be removed? At what point do we say ""You've crossed a line"" And who is to say when someone crosses a line? If we make that distinction now... what about the next person who will complain ""Well the line was HERE for so and so.. but now you've put it THERE for me. How am I different? You're treating me unfairly and with bias!""   And that's the thing. We've set out to make this place as unbias as possible. In fact that's one of the core reasons we left somewhere else - because of how bias the Admins had become, and how crazy it was for them to look one way when X group did something but soon as Y group did it, it wasn't okay. This Biasness.. this different way of treating each individual isn't okay.   You're not a nation flair to me or any of the staff. Each and every single one of you are a Player and a Person. And that's important to us.      What Happens Now?  Now.. I don't know. The question is, what happens if we as Admins start stepping into the role of ""banning people for being a dick"" is that okay.. and who would find it acceptable for us to say what is and what isn't being a dick. We have always held a policy of rolling back grief when it has occurred, and have banned multiple people for causing grief to other nations - and we'll continue to do so. Our Moderation team is just a Modmail away, and they'll come over and take a look at your land and they'll let you know if someone crossed the line on what was okay. Just send them that modmail and they'd be happy to do it. Contact TechSensai and Abusted. Let them do their jobs.   But Raiding.. Who is to say that when X nation raids Y nation it is or isn't war. And who is to then say what is a ""valid"" reason for War and attacks. To make it any of our business would be stepping into a murky grey sea of bias that we could never step back from or find our way out of.   Stay safe. Stay together. Bury your shit in reinforced chests. Lock up all you can lock up. And build those Vaults to store your precious things. When someone breaks your building for being a dick. Our Mod team will step in and take over. If someone targets you CONSTANTLY for no reason other than simply because they can. Our moderation team will step in. But you HAVE to modmail them, to let them do their job.   Raiding is a way of life. If you want to remove these 1 or 2 members from the community... there are loads of you other guys.. band together and hunt the fuckers. You outnumber them. We can't hold your hand constantly when it comes to your nation or your protection. We've given you as many tools as we can while still allowed vanilla mechanics to work."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,The_Zantid,2,Sat May 16 19:54:55 2015 UTC,"Raiding is a way of life.   In the dark ages perhaps.   Something people fail to realize is that people didn't raid to be dicks in history. They did it for military reasons, or because they needed to survive. Our griefers raiders only do it to be assholes. Griefing is not merely an attack on property it's an attack on people's mental welfare. You are allowing harassment of players when you continue to allow this to happen.  It would not surprise me if more people left because you guys allow 1 or 2 people to continue causing chaos.  This might be a good time for the server admins to think about what is best for the server and not what is best for the few."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,UnknownKiwi,3,Sat May 16 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"Our griefers raiders only do it to be assholes.   And at what point do we decide in which they're only doing it to be assholes, and who gets to make that decision? Here in lies the issue. When it has come to harassment, myself and other Moderators have gone out of our way to make sure such does not happen. When people have been constantly targeted by the same raiders we have gone and spoken to those people and told them, ""This isn't okay. targeting this one dude has to stop or you will be banned.""    Unfortunately, just because we don't list every single interaction with every single player, it makes it very difficult for everyone else to know that we've even done anything to begin with. For example, you wouldn't know that Abusted and Megans_ spent X amount of time the other day going through Core Protect logs to see if someone had x-rayed while they had raided.   Or that Abusted and Tech have gone out of their way multiple times to go check out raided people to see if things have gone to far, and when they have taken action by either talking to the raider and warning them, or issuing a ban. Or that they've tried to keep an eye on as many ships as they can physically track when stolen, and a watchful awareness of those who do raid.  Our current banlist is at over 20 people (Half of those are Alts of a single person) but the rest are either IP Alt accounts of people, or people who are currently temp-banned for griefing or other infractions.    It would not surprise me if more people left because you guys allow 1 or 2 people to continue causing chaos.   Just today I myself pearled 2 Raiders, and A group of others Including Old_man_Chris, KortexVortex and TinyEmperor (I think Veggiemonsta was there too!) pearled another.   These raiders CAN be attacked. They can be defeated and there are ways to do so. (Also ways to protect and hide your chests as much as physically possible so that it would literally take an x-ray to find it: Or just some really lucky fuckin' dude mining in your land).      We do not allow harrasment. We do not allow doxing. And we most certainly do not allow the insulting of other players beyond in game situations. If any of those have happened to you, you need to Modmail them so they can be investigated and checked (There is a reason we keep logs!)   Raiders can be defeated, it just requires a little teamwork... which is what people have been saying they've wanted :P    MODMAIL is there for a reason. We can't do anything about anyone unless you let us know :)"
TheRealmsMC,366rde,The_Zantid,1 point,Sat May 16 22:39:46 2015 UTC,"And at what point do we decide in which they're only doing it to be assholes   Because raiders are gentlemanly? You guys get to follow them around all secretively, you would know better than anyone whether they actually use what they steal, or just do it to be spiteful."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,UnknownKiwi,3,Sat May 16 23:34:29 2015 UTC,"Britannia has dealt with 4 raiders in less than 48 hours.    It has gotten rather excessive.  Some appear just be the rabble that shows up after an posting to mcservers.  Others, like you said, are taking advantage of the small size of this server to raid smaller groups or to come when no one is around.     A nation or gang of pirates is understandable. They are there for the long run, add spice to the game, and most importantly: WANT TO PLAY ON THE SERVER.  Raiders that just show up to raid, drop offline when threatened, and wait to return during quiet hours aren't contributing anything and are just frustrating players.    At what point do you say that they are not there to contribute to the health and popularity of the server and are there to just cause grief in the true emotional sense?"
TheRealmsMC,366rde,TinyEmperor,1 point,Sat May 16 18:43:41 2015 UTC,"What makes a pile, though?  You cannot add subjective limits to grieving, that just causes more trouble than it is worth.  Either allow the raiding as it is, or ban it completely.  Clearly the latter doesn't work either, so it's up to people to lock their valuables up."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,NerdOctopus,2,Sat May 16 19:18:24 2015 UTC,I'm afraid I don't see it in such black and white views.  Why not just limit the server choices to anarchy or creative?  Limitations are already in place to ensure the success of the server.  And this discussion is whether they should be expanded or not.
TheRealmsMC,366rde,TinyEmperor,1 point,Sat May 16 19:27:26 2015 UTC,"I said subjective limitations.  Give me an example of how you would implement rule changes to limit the problem, more than likely I will try and tell you why I think they won't work."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,NerdOctopus,3,Sat May 16 19:29:37 2015 UTC,"Generally, I'm for limitations in game rather than more rules enforced by moderators.  Moderators can be biased - game effects much less so.  I can't think of any single solution that will fix all of the issues at once, but here are two ideas off the top of my head that might help things.    1: Allow players to ""feed upkeep gold"" to a specific player's pearl via a command even if they don't have that pearl.  This will allow a hated raider to stay pearled longer without a single group needing to keep ensuring that there is enough gold.  While it won't stop initial raiding, it will help keep raiders locked up longer.  This doesn't break anything since it could be accomplished by trading anyway.    2: Create a very expensive recipe that reveals the player's log out coordinates.  Or perhaps the Y coordinate and the chunk coordinates.  This will help stem the thieves that come in and raid when people are offline.  For it is unrealistic to expect players to have to stand guard, especially if we have anti-idle restrictions like CivEx.  Are we punishing the people that can't stay online 24/7? This recipe would be not very useful against members of other nations though, but it would allow you to hunt down people that go offline as way to remain immune to retaliation.    Most importantly, I am for the discussion of this issue.  Sweeping it under the rug as ""Just deal with it"" isn't very productive.  I'm not accusing you of saying anything like that, but I am defending the need for active debate."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,TinyEmperor,1 point,Sat May 16 19:55:14 2015 UTC,"I always thought that raiders encouraged grouping rather than nomads or one-man nations, which is part of the point of the server.  More people online at more times to discourage raiding."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,NerdOctopus,1 point,Sat May 16 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"But to be fair, grouping doesn't really help when, well, you need to go to bed due to work, school or both. My nation has an active member group, but we still have times where no one can be on because they need to sleep or they have school or work. Sure, raiding encourages grouping, but does grouping together even really help? I'd say no when the raiders are too scared to play when people are awake.   I'm not saying ""Ban raiding!"" I'm saying that I'd rather have an al qaeda type group where you know the general location of their head quarters and they seem to have a purpose, instead of an Oklahoma City bomber who's one (two) dude(s) blowing shit up because, fuck it."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,KortexVortex,1 point,Sun May 17 01:22:15 2015 UTC,"After playing as a nomad on servers like this for a few years, I can say that having no infrastructure to target makes me a lot safer.  Also being in a nation gives an illusion that your property is secure, when it really isn't.  Raiders make it more fun for the military types, and suck for everyone else."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,axusgrad,1 point,Mon May 18 18:40:03 2015 UTC,"I agree. I believe if a person wants to run around and ruin peoples nations/experience, they should at least have a nation of their own so they can have the same fear. It's kind of ridiculous that people are running around with no nation at all just to do some easy raiding. This makes snitches useless. Like, ""Oh wow, I know Insert name here raided me, let's find his/her's nonexistent nation on this giant-ass map to get them back!"" It's a pain in the ass and just makes people not want to play here.  No more; ""He didn't mean it"" No more; ""Boys will be boys"" No more; ""They were asking for it"" No more  #NoMore"
TheRealmsMC,366rde,KortexVortex,1 point,Sat May 16 18:46:15 2015 UTC,All of that is part of the challenge though. It makes everything much more interesting and intense. Especially if your on a man hunt to find someone.
TheRealmsMC,366rde,siriusham,2,Sun May 17 14:44:31 2015 UTC,"Raiding must be allowed.  If we start banning raiders on a case by case basis, no objective rule can be found and the quality of the server will decline.  This is a server made to simulate civilization- this includes defense against raiding.  If you cannot stand raiding, then I would suggest a creative server."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,NerdOctopus,3,Sat May 16 18:43:45 2015 UTC,"You posted a similar comment in another thread, so I'll respond to both here. I've played on creative servers before. They're quite fun.  But I personally am not smart enough to run my own server, much less any of the plugins that we're playing on this server.  I came onto this server to play with a lot of other Minecrafters I don't know IRL, and would love to create a world with. The idea of everyone transforming the world landscape, open up trading routes, discover the use of every plugin...THAT'S why a lot of people are playing here. And yes, I'll admit, raiding was set up as a part of this world.    But if these players are just stealing to cause misery (and not openly declaring war), I don't see the purpose. They're not adding anything beneficial to the server. Yes, they gain some new materials. But they also are stealing hours of mining away from the people that don't have time to replace those goods."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,ImNotBanksy,2,Sat May 16 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"You lose half of the politics of the server when you disallow griefing in any way.  I see no possible way to implement a change which would help your situation.  Part of my fun on the server is defending myself, another reason that I play.  I don't see what real damage these people have been doing anyway."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,NerdOctopus,1 point,Sat May 16 19:16:28 2015 UTC,I think raiding nomads are just as legitimate as any other kind of nomad. They are essentially a one man nation at war with everyone.
TheRealmsMC,366rde,PoisonedPeace,1 point,Sat May 16 19:05:08 2015 UTC,"But therein lies the problem. They're NOT a nation. No one has control over them, and they probably don't have a home base set up in land that they've claimed. There is no easy way of fighting a one-man terrorist organization, compared to how easy they have it when territories are drawn out on a map."
TheRealmsMC,366rde,ImNotBanksy,3,Sat May 16 19:08:06 2015 UTC,"They are nomads, and if that is legitimate for people who don't wage war, then it is for those who do."

TheRealmsMC,3642l8,isaao12,3,Sat May 16 01:08:43 2015 UTC,"Horses can now be ""caught"" in a saddle by taking the saddle off the horse while you are riding it. It will return the saddle with lore of the stats of the horse. This makes it so you can store horses in chests and protect them better from raiders. To place a horse you will need a 2x3x3 clear area otherwise it will not spawn. You hit the ground with the saddle and it will re spawn the horse you had before.     Villagers no longer allow trades.   Mobs spawn more frequently and will hit harder, but still 15 times less than when the server opened.     Recipe books can now be spawner in again, as well.

They will talk to  you and bless or curse you, depending on if you make them happy or not. Gods are fickle and expect lots of attention, so you have to pray to them often. If you don't, they'll hate you. They give you items if you're in need, about once an hour. Gods with enough believers will need a priest, and the priest can create a bible and will receive more direct instructions for what's good and what isn't good. Priests can also bless followers, or curse non-believers. If you and a friend are following the same god, you can get married.    It requires access to an altar, you can pray once every 30 minutes"

Polytheistic systems (ones with more than one god) tend to split these traits among several deities. Even going so far as to assign gods responsible for different things like the sun, moon, and ocean; or abstract concepts like warfare, knowledge, and farming.  Monotheistic systems (with only one god) tend to lean towards ""all of the above"" on the theistic scantron sheet.

Well, we actually need resources after the raid attack on Kyra, but that was not the reason why I raided (griefed) St. Germain.   We had wild speculations who raided Kyra, and when someone said that it was St. Germain who did it, I just went to St. Germain, and you know what happened next.   It sounded logical at that moment, because I know that I took the iron that I mined from St. Germain when I was still a citizen there, so I thought it was revenge or something. And St. Germain is very close too.   However I had no evidence or proof so that was really stupid of me. We still don't know who took all our stuff. If we still want to play on the server, we will probably make a fresh start with maybe a new nation.  But I want you to know that I was responsible for this and not whole Kyra. Some people don't even know yet that I'm banned from the server.  Sorry for the raid and I know that St. Germain can't trust Kyra anymore. We're really poor and we've got nothing, so at this moment we can't give you anything back.   I heard that the damage was restored, I'm happy to hear that.

I understand emeralds are a precious commodity, but arguably less precious than iron... any ways, thats my 2 cents on the matter."
TheRealmsMC,35zig7,Ehini,1 point,Fri May 15 02:24:20 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but it allows infinite emeralds and supplies that people might have otherwise had to trade for, and it circumvents a number of other things, like experience bottles and enchanting items with enchants possibly not allowed on the server, since the villagers don't know any better. I have a plugin that I like that changes villager trades, but it doesn't seem to be working on the server, so it is something I need to work on when I get some spare time. Additionally, 1.8 villagers allow for infinite trades, which wasn't the case with 1.7 so it makes good trades always possible, which is even more gamebreaking in my opinion when we want people to be able to trade with each other"

I set sail north to the frozen tundra to maybe find a taiga. This time, the two afore mentioned rogues joined the game. Being the kind constable I am (and so is all of Britannia's citizens) I msg' them to say hi. I offered to pick up Tedbear as he was closer and I found out Whiskey_Bear spawned near Tierra Rica.    Whiskey_Bear made his way down south to Britannia as I offered them a safe place in Britannia for them to regroup and offered them citizenship, damn those rascals.    It was them I started seeing the snitches log coming in and filling up my chat. I hinted them of the server rules and told them not to touch anything. I am greatly worried for the last remaining yellow sheep and low population of the cows and diamonds and such but must importantly my golden armor I got from zombies, especially the helmet and the boots. My diving gear!    Their reaction to snitches were ""creepy"" But by now I heard //""Whiskey_Bear has entered Snitch at Britannia_Dreadnought"" Oh my they crossed the line.  They had also raided the warehouse.    When I return, I am shocked to see my armor gone, doors to the warehouse and other citizen's house were wide open, what lousy raiders are like that. I confined them to the tea parkour and set forth to inspect the damage.    I found the doors to the dreadnought open, TNT were missing. How dare non-Britannians use these piece of great engineering for destructive purpose! They saw me coming out of the dreadnought with my bow drawn, that when they start to worry. They start to say they got to go. They head off into the jungle, most likely to dispose of evidence.    I know I have to act fast, they could have TNT on them for all I know. I didn't have time to shout their rights (notliketheywillhaveany) I proceed to disarm them and dispense Victorian Justicetm prior to that I tricked them into sleeping at my bed I destroyed the bed promptly this will buy me time to explain everything to headquarters and properly inspect damage.    Turns out they didn't stole TNT but fired the cannons 3 times! They were found in procession of raw mutton, and a sharpness 1 sword which they claimed to not have stolen, does that mean they stole it from other nations? It is their first time....

Thanks for the suggestions :D We're working our way up to getting Fisherman done as a profession, though I'm still not completely sure on the bonuses or things are yet, so suggestions are more than welcome!   We also talked a lot before server release about a Hunter style class, that would get xp for not only killing mobs for food, but also for killing aggressive mobs like Zombies and So forth. We wanted very much to allow this class to have some form of function (Much like you need a blacksmith to craft saddles, or need an engineer to have airships). We just hadn't quite thought it through. We had hoped to tie it into some PvE content style plugins that we have lying around, but not touched since server launch."

Perhaps a more capricious child than she had bargained for, his manifestations of power are varied and tempestuous, but the faithful can be guaranteed calm treatment. His wayward ways have earned him a degree of spite from his uncles, Lux and Tenebrae. This is mostly because the fledgling God of Storms and Shipwrights delights in cloaking the skies with sheets of grey, to prank his uncles,.

TheRealmsMC,35ojv3,HappyCrow5,3,Tue May 12 06:27:15 2015 UTC,Can we change some of the protection levels. Stone at this point is useless and broken by a creeper blast. Since stone is the main thing we use to protect our projects and building could it be raised a lot higher?
TheRealmsMC,35ojv3,IronWolf209,2,Tue May 12 07:25:07 2015 UTC,"Do creeper explosions even interact with citadel though? I don't know if MC treats an explosion the same way as a block break by tool.

TheRealmsMC,35olm3,Ehini,1 point,Tue May 12 08:38:34 2015 UTC,Snitch culls make placing snitches outside your town useless :/
TheRealmsMC,35olm3,Sharpcastle33,1 point,Tue May 12 11:29:34 2015 UTC,Snitch culling are default mechanics that we haven't touched or changed.
TheRealmsMC,35olm3,Sharpcastle33,2,Tue May 12 13:02:35 2015 UTC,CivEx has had culling disabled as it forces snitches to only be placed in areas that are actively traveled by players.
TheRealmsMC,35olm3,Ironeagle155,1 point,Tue May 12 15:21:01 2015 UTC,"Yes, but we're not CivEx :P   Snitches are amazing, they're a massive deal. They give you troop movements and player locations with what is a relatively simple and easy block to craft and reinforce (and pretty simple to hide as well).   With this, there is no downside to snitches. The culling, I imagine, was added into the plugin because of this - this requires players to have a form of ""upkeep"" on their snitches. That snitch you hid in your enemies lands... well you have to keep visiting it to make sure it's still working and isn't going to get culled - which in turn adds to the politics and gameplay in that you have to either risk sending someone in to do that, or accept that getting spies behind enemy lines is god damn difficult.   You have to remember, this culling lasts A WHOLE MONTH on the jukebox that offers notifications only. Which is the one you're most likely to dump behind enemy lines."

TheRealmsMC,35nbk8,The_Zantid,9,Mon May 11 22:25:49 2015 UTC,"Mob Spawning:    It's the lack of caves on this map.  Play on a superflat world and you'll see the same craziness.  The mobs need to spawn somewhere on a chunk.  Without caves, they're forced to the surface.  If you dig mines and leave them dark, the mobs on the surface will decrease in that area.    Perhaps it was my time with the VAAST server and flatcore before coming here, but I love the challenge of the increased mobs.  It actually feels like you're taking back the wilderness this way by lighting things up and building barriers. When the sun rises, I venture out to my work site and work as hard as I can through the day.  As the sun starts to set, I quickly finish up so I can be back and secure in my settlement before the arriving herd of mobs can overwhelm me.  At night, I work within my settlement, chat with my neighbors, and patrol for any intruders.  Feels much more accomplished when I'm able to expand the borders and force the mobs back.    Seriously, when was the last time you actually felt threatened by hostile mobs on the surface in Minecraft?  Maybe your first few hours playing the game?  They can't keep up with us as it is, why nerf em?  I vote to keep the mobs as they are.  HOWEVER, Citadel needs to protect against Creeper explosions.  I don't want someone kiting along creepers to get into my place."

It doesn't matter what time of day it is, there is a constant stream of mobs from every direction, and we have made very very slow progress in lighting it up. We actually had to get full enchanted diamond armor before we could even try to start to light it up. So something needs to happen there."

TheRealmsMC,35jij6,MrJay235,3,Sun May 10 23:52:58 2015 UTC,"Writing an advertisement post took less than 10 Minutes. It didn't drag our focus away from anything in terms of sorting out bugs or fixing things, nor does it reduce our focus on our current community; unless that community doesn't want potential newfriends? :(    In fact in the last few days we have:   Got FactoryMod Working (Except for the burning Dark Oak Logs) Added Professions Yesterday Today I fixed a bug that stopped disease cures being crafted - reworked the ENTIRE Farmer class to get around this bug, and now have disease cures working + New Farmer Class updated + I'm currently making recipes books for people for what each class gets Recipes wise.  Not even considering the amount of in game support myself and Megans have offered and been giving to people when it comes to fixing things or quirks. Or our past Bugfixes over the last week alone.    What we're working on behind closed doors:    NONE of this is a promise as to these features    Currently working on a super secret Horse addition Rewriting of the Local Chat system to offer a more dynamic experience Fixing Prison Pearl issues    As for Block Latency - I rarely see it; but I can understand how it can be annoying for people, truth is, our server is large. The map size alone eats into our ram, before you add in the plugins required to give you the experience we're attempting to give. For us to offer more in the terms of server capacity or general server functions - would require us either building a local dedicated server (Which costs a bunch of money that we don't have, nor the home personal internet speeds to run something like that :P ) or it involves uping the monthly cost of the server to head to a hosted dedicated VPS machine, which is going to almost double our currently monthly costs.      I love you guys (and girls) each and every single one of you, even Zeetip (although I know how hard that can be to believe :P), but we're working our asses off for you each and every day; even on the days in which we've had a horrible day at Work, or when we're feeling ill or irritable.  But, the truth is, no minecraft server can live with a population it currently has. Overtime people will sign in less, they will go elsewhere, and they'll do something else. (That doesn't make us love you any less! Honest.) We need players to enter the opposite door when another uses the exit. For every player that we would lose currently (before the server post) that's a potential net loss of -1 (more if he's leaving with friends maybe -5) with no way to recuperate that loss in the slightest. At least with a potential server advertisement, we've added an avenue for player base growth, mitigating that potential player loss.   No one wants to think about it, and we certainly don't want to lose any of you, but it's a fact of life and server gaming in general. The dedicated and hardcore crowd (I'm looking at you NotYetASaint) will stay around through the population swells and currents, but we need the others to make the world living, full and complete. Nation building doesn't work if we reduce ourselves down to 10 Members and continue to just focus on those.   Rather than wait until it might ever hit that point and then make a reactionary post, it's better to make the post now and plan for the future (always plan for the worst but hope for the best, as the saying goes).   I hope that helps answer any questions or issues you had with the post."

TheRealmsMC,35jij6,The_Zantid,2,Mon May 11 01:30:38 2015 UTC,"Writing an advertisement post took less than 10 Minutes.   I can tell. It really wasn't the best advertisement I've seen.   But that isn't my point right now.   it involves uping the monthly cost of the server to head to a hosted dedicated VPS machine, which is going to almost double our currently monthly costs.    What are we spending on the server monthly?   we're working our asses off for you each and every day   I'm not fighting that. It was never implied that you aren't. I can tell the work is there - I think the work required to get this in peak condition is simply greater than your excellent work being done.   But that isn't my point.   We need players to enter the opposite door when another uses the exit.    That isn't now. I've been obsessively following the server count of both this server and CivEx four to six times daily. We are holding steady in terms of population. We are a week in.   Nation building doesn't work if we reduce ourselves down to 10 Members and continue to just focus on those.    Again, it's been one week. Again, we have consistently been at higher numbers than the tree we branched off from - a feat even I thought would not be possible. Do you expect our population to take a nosedive to that extreme that quickly?   Besides that, if we truly are losing numbers to the point that you fear we need to advertise within the first week, why would you give it ten minutes? I don't think it's healthy for the server to bring people in to what I see as a skeletal frame using what I see is a skeletal advertisement. A list is not an advertisement. Perhaps you should have a dedicated person for advertising so that said person could spend more than ten minutes, leaving you & abusted & tech & megan to focus on the internal aspect of the server.  Edit: I did not mean to blow off the things you've done and are doing. That wasn't the point of my post. Continue the great work. Just... Consider the consequences of marketing before you are ready."
TheRealmsMC,35jij6,mcWinton,2,Mon May 11 00:59:38 2015 UTC,"I would agree with both you and zantid. I think advertising early and often is fine. There will be people who come early, because they saw an ad, who don't stay but might have stayed if they had been drawn here later on, but that's a hard number to track and a worthwhile risk. However, server ads should probably be given more than 10 minutes, and should be just that - advertisements. It's not enough to just put the server out there, it's important to sell it. Sell what makes it unique, what makes it exciting, what makes it worth trying out. Along with Raxus I'd love to help write ad copy. I can sell a ketchup popcicle to a woman wearing white gloves ;)"
TheRealmsMC,35jij6,The_Zantid,0,Mon May 11 01:19:51 2015 UTC,"First of all, there was no need to be rude about the writing of the server post - doing so is merely being rude and offers nothing to the discussion. Being rude for the sake of being an ass isn't nice nor warranted.   As to what we're spending monthly on the server, no offence but anything in relation to my own, or any other party's, personal finances or spending is none of your business; all you should worry about is that we do this out of our own pocket and time and any donations go straight through to paypal that the funding of the server is taken from.   I think the work required to get this in peak condition is simply greater than your excellent work being done.   Again, another statement to be rude and as you yourself mentioned ""wasn't your point"". Being rude for the sake of being rude isn't worth responding to, especially when it relates to our efforts and the time we put into this server to be enjoyable for as many people as we can make it (I can't even remember the last time I actually got to play my own damn server that I built.)   That isn't now. I've been obsessively following the server count of both this server and CivEx four to six times daily. We are holding steady in terms of population. We are a week in.   This is precisely why the post needed to be made now. What happens if people have joined the server for a week under the idea of ""Oooo new and shiny"" and then leave once the shine wears off for them? We're left with an ever decreasing population of people who came merely to play with the new toy, rather than are planning to stick around. Making the post now was the right decision in the hopes to combat any of the ""Fad"" craze.   And quite simply - We have spent weeks, and weeks, days and days, getting the server to where it is now: sleepless nights. Arguments and general frustrations with coding. We didn't do it to please solely you and whether you view it as skeletal or not. That's your opinion, but insulting our work and effort doesn't in the slightest change the points I addressed in my original post.   Server population changes. It will continue to change. It will go up and it will go down. But when it goes down, we need to have a way for it to go back up again - and the only way to have that is for our server to be listed somewhere beyond our own subreddit that no one will be able to find."

Is this how the staff are going to respond to legitimate, constructive criticism? I posted this publicly to hear what the public thought. I'm attacking nothing, so please don't force me on the defensive to put yourself at an advantage. It's not even an argument, so please don't use the tactics of one.  To restate what I said, I think building a server is naturally going to require enough work to tie any small group up.    Making the post now was the right decision in the hopes to combat any of the ""Fad"" craze.    Then spend effort on the post. I'm not insulting your work - I'm saying bluntly that it was a hardly formatted text post.   You made a point on your last response that it hardly took time or effort. When I agree with that, it becomes an insult?  You've convinced me to care about this server with your efforts, and now I have a vested interest.

My say probably doesn't count much in this but I have to say that I really don't like this as an ability for the Farmer, even if it's expensive. I feel like it actually cheapens livestock a little bit, especially things like horses, which I feel should be caught from the wild and bred to be the best they can be. Just any old farmer will eventually be able to make horses and just plonk them down in their swamp town without having to trade for them, since horses don't spawn in the swamp.  I'm all for the rest of the updates, but I'd really rather that the Farmer ability be retracted and rethought, at least for animals as useful as horses."

TheRealmsMC,35jvag,ZeeTip,1 point,Mon May 11 11:19:03 2015 UTC,"And that's true, but that's what makes good horses more valuable. Using spawn eggs to literally spawn wild horses really makes them cheap and honestly destroys trade, especially if you can spawn them in any old biome. That's my main concern."
TheRealmsMC,35jvag,Candlepup,2,Mon May 11 19:39:46 2015 UTC,"In all honesty it takes weeks of hard work to get to level 30 farming and then the recipe for horse eggs is probably very high. Horses are already easy to trade, they spawn frequently and with movecraft you can transport them easily, my ship alone has room for  30+ wild horses if i had the inclination to go and catch some and bring them back."
TheRealmsMC,35jvag,ZeeTip,1 point,Mon May 11 19:43:28 2015 UTC,"Yes, but as it is, you have to catch them and load them onto a ship and other stuff. My other problem with spawn eggs is that they're kind of immersion breaking. It's fun to round up horses, tame them, and ship them around to places that want them. For me, at least, that's part of the game. What isn't fun is crafting an egg and plonking it down and bam, suddenly you have a horse. It feels gamey, cheaty, and gross, but maybe that's just me.  I know it takes all that work to get to level 30 farming and I'm sure it's so expensive to craft horse eggs, and any eggs for that matter, as it should be. But that doesn't make it much better, if you ask me. The long and short of it is that I have a problem with spawn eggs in a server that's so meticulous in its mob spawning, breeding rates, and ore gen."
TheRealmsMC,35jvag,Candlepup,1 point,Mon May 11 20:00:29 2015 UTC,I wonder if they can make eggs only spawn in a proper biome.

TheRealmsMC,35kag5,zefmiller,2,Mon May 11 19:55:24 2015 UTC,"Why a Bank makes sense - The server is very young and anyone who builds a supervault will have a corner on the market. An early vault would certainly be the safest place to keep wealth. Why a Bank doesn't make sense - No one has any real wealth yet, and by the time they do they'll have their own vault. The only reason to keep your wealth in a bank is if it's paying you interest, which means the bank has to be loaning the wealth out and collecting interest. In all my time on civx I never once saw a loan like this go out, so I'm not sure when/why thy would happen here."
TheRealmsMC,35kag5,mcWinton,1 point,Mon May 11 12:53:16 2015 UTC,Loans would be the key to the success. Loans from a large community bank could help new players/nations start out and establish themselves more quickly. The interest on the loan (a few extra diamonds or iron or emeralds) would be how the bank would generate enough income to then hand out more loans.   The actual idea of storing excess wealth isn't too enticing for players with large established nations but it could be a good idea for smaller nations that can't yet afford a large vault or have the population numbers to protect it.
TheRealmsMC,35kag5,zefmiller,1 point,Mon May 11 17:16:31 2015 UTC,I'm never giving a large amount of wealth to a bank (another player) to distribute to random newfriends with the hopes of getting it back UNLESS the player/nation running the bank is wealthy enough independently to gurantee the ability to give me back all my wealth at any point in time. That would be the key to a successful bank - insurance made possible by massive personal wealth.
TheRealmsMC,35kag5,ArsenalOwl,1 point,Mon May 11 18:15:19 2015 UTC,"What if the bank were a co-venture between nations, thus reducing the amount of wealth any one nation would need to have? The security would then come from the amount of partners backing the bank, where the sum of resources would be gathered/donated/collected by those nations.   There would also need to be a process for acquiring the loan or accounts. Otherwise the bank runs the risk of loaning to players who log on once only to never return. Perhaps an account created by the player would need to have resources added to it in order to access other bank features such as loans, similar to the idea of a minimum balance limit. The account could not be empty or emptied if loans are taken."

The numbers we currently have are based on advisements of others, general testing and lots of Excel Spreadsheets lol.   But when it comes to in game, nothing beats having a player actually go through the process fully during normal gameplay to get a true understanding and feeling for the experience - which we can then customise and adjust over time with a configuration file edit, rather than having to mess with any Java code for each and every change."
