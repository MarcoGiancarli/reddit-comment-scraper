WWEGames,3e6566,nWo4lifeSweet,2,Wed Jul 22 06:37:40 2015 UTC,How drunk are you trying to get
WWEGames,3e6566,El_Gringo92,1 point,Wed Jul 22 07:08:15 2015 UTC,Very. But paced over a lot of matches.
WWEGames,3e6566,El_Gringo92,2,Wed Jul 22 07:10:13 2015 UTC,Play universe mode turn off rivalries  Take a drink when a cut scene happens  Whenever the title changes hands take a drink for each month they held the title
WWEGames,3e6566,kpfettstyle,2,Wed Jul 22 07:17:59 2015 UTC,"Play a 6 man ladder match, drink any time something happens that could not happen in this reality."
WWEGames,3e6566,Colon-Dee,2,Wed Jul 22 08:01:24 2015 UTC,"Play Royal Rumble, take a shot for every elimination you get."
WWEGames,3e6566,BossHawgKing,2,Wed Jul 22 09:14:32 2015 UTC,"This one is blatantly obvious. Take a shot everytime you hear ""Educated Feet"". Prepare to get smashed."
WWEGames,3e6566,NexYT,2,Wed Jul 22 10:30:55 2015 UTC,Take a shot every time an Uso is in a singles match
WWEGames,3e6566,Mr-Potz,2,Wed Jul 22 11:42:03 2015 UTC,"Any think that benefits you outside of just playing, you drink. So use a finisher, drink, your finisher reversed, drink twice. Drink for each taunt you use. Find yourself in a submission,  both players drink until it's broken"
WWEGames,3e238i,SodaPopJr,2,Tue Jul 21 10:45:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with all of your suggestions but I'm not optimistic about getting any of them any time soon. I think they focus on the showcase stuff to draw in more casual fans unfortunately. As such Universe mode has changed very little since 13.   In 2k14 they added in the ability to set up your own rivalries manually and slightly expanded on it in 2k15 by making the rivalry storylines slightly more transparent (you can choose from many different ""storylines"" but the descriptions often have little semblance to what happens and they're all very similar). You essentially still end up with the same crappy feuds of rivals fighting each other every single week, often in stipulation matches when it makes zero sense (e.g. submission matches are very common but I can't remember the last time I saw one on Raw).   There's still many, many bugs (most of which seem like they should be pretty easy to fix but it doesn't happen). Cutscenes are, I'd say, slightly more common in 2k15 perhaps but still consist of the same few that were present in 13 from what I can remember.  That said I still load it up and play through a month to a PPV every so often. I set up rivalries but often just end up booking matches myself to replace the crappy AI booking at the expense of getting any cutscenes. Very occasionally awesome stuff happens (I recently got my first ever branching cutscene after goodness knows how many hundreds of play hours over the years) but it's mostly up to your imagination as to how involving it gets."
WWEGames,3e238i,pdog8000,2,Tue Jul 21 13:57:09 2015 UTC,"One of the problems with Universe mode is that it seems completely random. There's seemingly no upper, mid or low card. For example, in my Universe Lesnar is feuding with Kofi. Like... what? I think one possible solution to this would be to add a tier system with a defined upper, middle, and low card. Superstars are placed in tiers at the start (either by you or by default) and superstars will only feud with superstars in their tiers unless you say otherwise. The game could periodically give you prompts like ""Kofi Kingston is getting over with the fans, would you like to give him a push?"" and if you say no it'll keep them in their tier and if you say yes you'll start a storyline with a wrestler on a higher tier.   Overall I feel the gameplay is great and possibly the best it has ever been, but everything else needs work. It needs pretty much more of everything."
WWEGames,3e238i,jabbawonky,1 point,Tue Jul 21 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"I wish it could be like in WWE '12, the last Universe Mode I enjoyed. You didn't had the same matches over and over again and the rivalries were awesome"
WWEGames,3e4d5k,est3901,2,Tue Jul 21 21:28:07 2015 UTC,It probably will be in the showcase.

WWEGames,3e1xnt,Athlon77,2,Tue Jul 21 09:28:18 2015 UTC,"If they are unlocked, there may be some requirements (like someone being face or heel) but the biggest thing is that both participants must be over. Put them in a tag feud for a month or so if that is your problem."
WWEGames,3e1xnt,somebodycallmymomma,2,Tue Jul 21 12:44:31 2015 UTC,Are you sure? I've never noticed momentum affecting what I could or couldn't book? Though I haven't bothered much with the special/secret rivalries. They're very specific and when I played Del Rio vs Mysterio it was just the same old shit from all of the other rivalries.
WWEGames,3e1xnt,pdog8000,2,Tue Jul 21 14:00:33 2015 UTC,"For special rivalries, yes. I wanted to do Cena vs. Taker, but couldn't until their momentum was high enough."
WWEGames,3e1xnt,somebodycallmymomma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:35:56 2015 UTC,"Huh... I kind of like that restriction, would be good if it was actually mentioned in game though!"
WWEGames,3e1xnt,pdog8000,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:50:09 2015 UTC,"How does it work? When they both have high enough momentum and the conditions are satisfied,  then the rivalry will automatically trigger provided that there's a rivalry slot open and both men aren't in a rivalry?"
WWEGames,3e1xnt,somebodycallmymomma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:59:06 2015 UTC,"No, you have to manually select it once it is unlocked. Again, all conditions need to be met, which include momentum, having certain characters face or heel, and even alliances between characters. You can see the requirements when you click on a special rivalry."
WWEGames,3e1xnt,Alpha-Pig,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:14:34 2015 UTC,"yeah but check who else is involved in the feud, what their status is face or heel and who they need to be allies or enemies with and make sure everyone is in the same brand."
WWEGames,3dzbre,Antmagic1,1 point,Mon Jul 20 19:23:46 2015 UTC,"That would be cool. I always turn the commentary off straight away because it's so bad, so in my head the commentary's done by Striker and Vampiro already. It'd be good to get their models sitting there too."
WWEGames,3dzbre,PelvoDelFuego,1 point,Tue Jul 21 03:08:31 2015 UTC,"I think it would be possible based on what I've seen, people would need to custom make the announcer models though.

WWEGames,3drg3w,NorthBlizzard,2,Sun Jul 19 05:29:15 2015 UTC,Or they can at least have King and Cole talk about the rivals a little more. For example if kane atcketed Abrose after the match last week the next time Ambrose was in the ring they would bring that up.
WWEGames,3dtck4,Simontacchi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:53:36 2015 UTC,They will. Although they'll most likely be taken directly from their titantrons.

WWEGames,3di42f,bamacl,7,Thu Jul 16 15:26:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, this! Especially would be cool for online"
WWEGames,3di42f,kaze0,7,Thu Jul 16 15:29:55 2015 UTC,What happens instead of Cena quitting in an IQuit match? Because apparently passing out doesn't result in victory.
WWEGames,3di42f,SethRollins07,4,Thu Jul 16 13:39:34 2015 UTC,It'll be like No Mercy first blood matches when blood is turned off

WWEGames,3di42f,Raichu52,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:18:15 2015 UTC,"I see it as you can tap out Lesnar, Cena, or Taker it is just harder to do so however those characters have a pain threshold that increases the longer they are in the submission and once they meet a certain point they will pass out and start a minigame to regain consciousness"

WWEGames,3cu4al,dizzy_hogan,2,Fri Jul 10 20:07:25 2015 UTC,"I hope is that WWE 2k16's theme is the Monday Night Wars. Get a ton of WCW guys in the game, and play through a long WWE Showcase type mode from both sides of the fence.  I know the Attitude Era one from a couple games ago kept mentioning the ratings and such, but have this one include the matches from WCW as well."
WWEGames,3crg5o,XPacEnergyDrink,9,Fri Jul 10 04:24:29 2015 UTC,The 2k15 six man tag with Nash is worse
WWEGames,3crg5o,kaze0,8,Fri Jul 10 09:41:13 2015 UTC,Nah.  The match from WWE '13 where you played as Austin and had to give Billy Gunn and Road Dogg each a stunner and then pin Road Dogg in less than 3 minutes or whatever.  It was a hassle because Gunn would constantly distract the ref.
WWEGames,3crg5o,MutatedSpleen,3,Fri Jul 10 07:27:03 2015 UTC,"If you stun Gunn first, then RD, then just stay on RD, I don't think he gets up before Gunn gets sent to the back."
WWEGames,3crg5o,MrKain,3,Fri Jul 10 14:27:11 2015 UTC,"HA! I remember this! I remember unleashing hell on RD until I had 2 finishers stored, ran out, stunned gunn then back in the ring, stunner on RD for the 3 count with almost no time left. It was a rush, though!"
WWEGames,3crg5o,misterzadir,9,Mon Jul 13 18:51:10 2015 UTC,Trying to put Road Dogg through the table on WWE 13 was awful

WWEGames,3crg5o,abchiptop,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:31:19 2015 UTC,"I think the skill was setting the table up out of the ring, to lean on the apron!"
WWEGames,3crg5o,LucasTheBeard,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:48:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah but for some reason you couldn't lean it like that on the Wii very easily. Something was likely broken in that version because it used the older engine IIRC, I tried it with two wiimote/nunchuck combo and two different classic controllers. The Wii version you had to basically knock out the ref without getting a dq, set it in the ring on the corner, then line it up perfectly. If you tried anything else, you'd miss the table or the ref would grab it"
WWEGames,3crg5o,abchiptop,3,Mon Jul 13 23:53:30 2015 UTC,No I hated the 2nd Cena vs Rock because it took me like 15 tries to reverse the Rock's finisher
WWEGames,3crg5o,ronryan4,3,Sat Jul 11 05:22:07 2015 UTC,"I remember finally, after so many attempts, reversing rock's finisher... Only to have to have him reverse mine."
WWEGames,3crg5o,misterzadir,3,Mon Jul 13 18:52:48 2015 UTC,Nope. Four way cage match in DoR 2.
WWEGames,3crg5o,dontberidiculousfool,2,Sat Jul 11 21:37:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is. Just when I thow one of them out of the ring, the other one wakes up and goes on and on..."
WWEGames,3crg5o,InvictusArchangel,2,Fri Jul 10 05:27:45 2015 UTC,The tears I shed during this match...
WWEGames,3crg5o,Elbling,2,Fri Jul 10 07:07:20 2015 UTC,"For me, the annoyance was HBK vs Bret Hart- 'Mania XII for a while, keeping the score 0-0 was both annoying and difficult, considering how long the match was and how HBK had a (schoolboy, or some kind of pin roll-up?) in his moveset."

WWEGames,3cnsdy,The_Orsum_One,6,Thu Jul 9 10:02:28 2015 UTC,Some that I hope to see:   New Beauty Shot for Tyler Breeze Multiple different dropkicks into the corner for Itami & Balor New Double Diving Foot Stomp for Finn Balor Roundhouse kick to kneeling or seated opponent for Hideo Itami Multiple variations of the Pop Up Powerbomb for Kevin Owens Improved Discus Clothesline like from the corner Superkick where the opponent stays standing Spamming Corner European Uppercuts Springboard Stunner (If it was anyone other than Cena I wouldn't expect it to be in) Twisting moonsault for Kevin Owens The Figure 8 Leg Lock for Charlotte Phoenix Splash from Second and Top Rope Cesaro Swing into the Sharpshooter (Maybe DLC) Banks Statement as well as the Corner Double knees for the Boss Becky Lynch's and Kushidas Arm Lock Almost forgot Itami's Twisting DDT/Hotshot combination from the Top Rope
WWEGames,3cnsdy,chubbrub,6,Thu Jul 9 10:11:18 2015 UTC,"I would love a reanimated Stunner where the person falls to their knees with no oversell or post stunner taunt.   Kevin Owens' top rope fisherman's suplex counter move.  That spinning facebuster thing Cena did this past week. (More likely for later DLC)   Left Arm Stan Hansen lariat.   Samoan Driver (not the Rikishi driver that's already in, but Dana Brooke's finisher.)  Cass and Enzo's version of the Rocket Launcher."
WWEGames,3cnsdy,MrKain,2,Thu Jul 9 15:06:00 2015 UTC,"I like all of these suggestions, and I think most of them will be in the game or DLC. I agree with the Stunner, I think there is only one Stunner with no oversell or taunting, but it's really slow."
WWEGames,3cnsdy,chubbrub,1 point,Fri Jul 10 01:03:49 2015 UTC,Isn't Dana Brooke's finish basically the Au Revoir?
WWEGames,3cnsdy,MrKain,2,Fri Jul 10 12:54:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not familiar with that one, do you mean Rene Dupree' Bonsoir?  That one was a Michinoku Driver II. Dana's is the same as King Cuerno's Thrill of the Hunt or Chris Sabin's Cradleshock minus the crossing of the legs. I actually found this video of Cena doing it a long time ago.  https://youtu.be/OirwKKgMEB4"
WWEGames,3cnsdy,chubbrub,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:26:10 2015 UTC,OK. Thanks for clarification.
WWEGames,3cnsdy,MrKain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:01:29 2015 UTC,No prob. And I should have checked the context first. I thought your reply was part of a discussion on Dana and her finishing move. Move names/variations are my thing and I tend to go overboard on discussions.
WWEGames,3cnsdy,InvictusArchangel,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:40:47 2015 UTC,"Nah, you're right... The Au Revoir was Dupree and Grenier's double team spoke spinebuster."
WWEGames,3cnsdy,InvictusArchangel,4,Fri Jul 10 20:53:49 2015 UTC,Don't forget the pele kick (or whatever the name is) for Balor Hadouken by Kenny Omega I agree with the stunner. For years I hated to do that overselled stunner. And THAT powerful front dropkick by Balor (that one the enemy is thrown to the corner)
WWEGames,3cnsdy,MrKain,1 point,Fri Jul 10 05:39:31 2015 UTC,"I had Balor's dropkick in my comment, and with what they showed with Balor's Mocap video is that they have it in the game."

WWEGames,3cnsdy,Speakeasy__,3,Fri Jul 10 18:29:52 2015 UTC,"Christopher Daniels' Angel's Wings (the only time it was ever in was as part of the crate-a-finisher, and its never made it to being an actual move... It's really pissing me off, because Daniels is my favorite wrestler) and the BME."
WWEGames,3cnsdy,Speakeasy__,1 point,Fri Jul 10 12:57:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think they will be in the game, but I predict that they may be in DLC due to 2K usually keeping the Indy moves for DLC. The closest thing they currently have for the angels wings is the implant buster so thats just what I usually just use."
WWEGames,3cnsdy,jabbawonky,2,Fri Jul 10 13:04:16 2015 UTC,sigh  How is this move overlooked for every year of the game's existence?
WWEGames,3cnsdy,TentacleTouchy,2,Fri Jul 10 13:29:27 2015 UTC,"Cannonball (As a corner grapple, not just the running strike already in the game)  Any move as your finisher (I find it really dumb that they remove some grapples from the finisher section, also apron grapples.)  A new 450 Splash (They made a good animation for Gabriel when he debuted and then they removed it for the old shitty animation.)  New Double foot stomp (Again they removed one from 2k14, also mushroom stomps.)  New Shooting Star Press (Current animation is awful.)  As the DLC moves pack is usually when the bring in the indie stuff I would like to see in the pack  One Winged Angel  630 Senton  Shouten Kai (I think that's what Goto's suplex slam is called)  Hollow Point (Ganso Bomb)  Matt Jackson's Top Rope Somersault Cutter"
WWEGames,3cnsdy,NexYT,2,Fri Jul 10 07:37:37 2015 UTC,"Completely agree with all of them, especially the apron grapple as signature/finisher and I'm pretty sure that Gabriels 450 is still in the game."
WWEGames,3cnsdy,Blabe,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:51:24 2015 UTC,"It's not. 2K14 had the one in 2K15 and Gabriels version. The only 450 in 2K15, excluding the springboard, has been around since the PS2 era."

WWEGames,3cn04j,Warbotter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 04:14:19 2015 UTC,"2K started performing server maintenance for my2K starting on July 8th. In reference to how this will affect WWE 2K, they stated that WWE 2K doesn't use my2K so it doesn't matter, but ""Online Play and Community Creations won't be accessible during this downtime"". 2 days have passed, and since then, a bunch of games got their servers back up, but both 2K14 and 2K15 for 360 have servers that aren't working, and I don't know why. They haven't referenced it on the official WWE 2K Twitter or the 2K support Twitter, and they didn't reply to either of my tweets to them."
