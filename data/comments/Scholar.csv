Clear your cookies or use a different browser when you revist.  It is especially helpful if you know the exact text on that page. Then you can search Google Books specifically for that text.  Anyways, I found the pages, converted them to PDF, and recognized text on them for you. Enjoy!  http://ge.tt/5LW7JuH2/v/0  (sorry for the highlighting from the Google Books search)"
