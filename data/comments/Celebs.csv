She's got nothing really to show off chest wise. If she really wanted to entice the crowd she'd do it facing away from them but doesn't have much of a butt either. Don't get me wrong she puts together a cute little package and she's really pretty but she's got no specific greatness to show off. Maybe she's just near sighted.

So my ex-gf loved Shameless and started having me watch some eps.  After the first couple episodes she asked me if I thought this actress (Emmy Rossum) was good looking.  I said ""Yeah! I think shes crazy hot.""  No big deal, my gf agreed.  So fast forward a couple months later and we're watching Shameless again.  I nonchalantly turn to her and go, "" You know who Emmy Rossum really looks like?"", ex-gf goes, ""Who?""  Then I, without thinking about the conversation we had had 2 months prior blurts out, ""Your younger cousin Kacie!""  Bad move on my part.  TL;DR: Accidentally told my ex-gf her younger cousin is ""crazy hot"""

Is the worship of her because her Harry Potter background or do you genuinely feel her to be amazingly beautiful more so than other amazingly beautiful girls?"

Celebs,3ddg6t,raptinox,16,Wed Jul 15 16:08:15 2015 UTC,Besides the Harry Potter thing I think people like her for the same reason they like Emma stone and Jennifer Lawrence: they're hot but not unrealistically hot so they seem like someone you could meet in real life giving them the appearance of attainability.
Celebs,3ddg6t,goatinstein,6,Wed Jul 15 23:00:33 2015 UTC,"She also has that rail thin body type that'll probably hold up really well for a decade or 3, sort of like Kate Beckinsale. In the back of your mind that potential is pretty attractive."
Celebs,3ddg6t,stevewmn,0,Wed Jul 15 17:42:08 2015 UTC,"They like her because most of the people going ape shit over her grew up with her.  It's the same thing with us older guys when it comes to how we worshipped Alba, Christina Ricci, Kristen Dunst etc.  Not saying she's not pretty but a lot of her loyal following is due to growing up with her.  Remember how fucking hot Alba was in Idle Hands?  16 year old me would have ate chili out of her asshole.  She's still hot but has meh'd over the years."
Celebs,3ddg6t,mastiffdude,33,Wed Jul 15 21:46:16 2015 UTC,"Harry Potter background helps since I've had a crush on her since I was 12(we're the same age). This makes her prettier to me in the same way a pretty girl I went to highschool with is more attractive to me than a random pretty girl. But considering that guys like her more than girls like daniel Radcliffe or Rupert grint, it's safe to say she's also just ridiculously good looking."
Celebs,3ddg6t,Bagodonuts10,20,Wed Jul 15 20:08:25 2015 UTC,I don't think she's ridiculously good looking at all just a  pretty face like there are so many everywhere you go. Her body is pretty average too. While I acknowledge that she is pretty and certainly above avg overall I just think people feel the way they do about her because we sort of grew up with her and her character.

Celebs,3ddg6t,paddywacknack,9,Wed Jul 15 17:04:52 2015 UTC,"Maybe. So much of what people are attracted to is what they grew up with. Like, if your first girlfriend had small boobs, you might be more into that.  Doesn't make much sense to me to get too objective about. She's the most attractive celebrity to me and lots of other people.  Would I think that if she was a new actress or random girl I knew?  Couldn't tell you."
Celebs,3ddg6t,Bagodonuts10,3,Wed Jul 15 17:11:18 2015 UTC,"I didn't even watch that many harry potters but I think she's super attractive. I don't really know why, must just be what I've seen of her personality and how she doesn't look like she'd be a celebrity... or something. But I mean, good thing attractiveness is subjective, I think Jlaw and Scarlet Johannson are super overrated and pretty average to me."

Celebs,3d4zii,Bigsaskatuna,107,Mon Jul 13 21:50:41 2015 UTC,"John Mayer talking about Giada:   BlindGossip ‚Äì At a recent music event, this star [Mayer] spent some time regaling a group of guys with bawdy stories about his love life. There was a lot of macho posturing and laughing going on until someone asked him about a married celebrity with whom he had been rumored to have had a steamy affair.  Star‚Äôs tone immediately changed from jovial to bitter. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt know, because apparently it didn‚Äôt happen‚Ä¶ according to her. Yeah, it didn‚Äôt happen 4, 5, 6, 7 times for about a year‚Ä¶ according to her. According to her, we‚Äôre not even acquaintances.‚Äù  At this point, someone on his management team stepped in to the conversation, loudly claiming that it was time to go, but Star just couldn‚Äôt stop talking. ‚ÄúAnd, since I don‚Äôt know her, I also can‚Äôt comment on how much of a cum freak she is. I‚Äôm just assuming that she is. I‚Äôm also assuming that underneath there‚Äôs a lot of kink going on.‚Äù  Star was then forcibly pulled away by his management, but on his way out the door, he couldn‚Äôt resist turning around with one last comment. ‚ÄúOh, and another thing‚Ä¶ if my cock wanted a porn star experience, she would be the one to call. Because I‚Äôll bet she also has no gag reflex. Just a hunch.‚Äù"

I realize there are probably some comic purists still, but all the interviews, previews, footage, pics, art, cosplay, etc. is pretty cool. If I were a comic fan from when the con started in the 70s I might feel different, but getting into it in the 90s, I love what it has become. I have no problem with the fact that it has become comic/scifi/fantasy/movie/tv/book/nerd/geek convention."
