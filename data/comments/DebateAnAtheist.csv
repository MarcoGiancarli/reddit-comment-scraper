DebateAnAtheist,3e08c2,habs114,40,Mon Jul 20 23:21:05 2015 UTC,"As a non religious (atheist/secular) Jew, I've heard those arguments before from my more religious friends.  They sound impressive until you realize they come from ignorance.   Both Zoroastrianism and many variants of Hinduism have survived into the modern era. While you can say they were not a tribe like the Israelis were a tribe, and do not share a genealogy that has lasted several centuries, you'd be mistaken in both cases. Zoroastrian communities in India and Iran, as well as the Hindu communities of India clearly are descended from their also Hindu ancestors. While there have certainly been influences on all three religions and cultures, Jews are by no means unique as a ethno-religious group to have survived over the centuries. They only appear that way in the west.   The modern state of Israel exists for several reasons, and most of our modern thinking does not take into account not only the socio-geopolitical landscape at the time of its formation, but the events of the century prior (1850-1950) which allowed it to occur.  For practically the previous 100 years before the establishment of the modern state of Israel, there was among the various nations of Europe the so-called ""Jewish Question."" While this term has obvious historical antisemitic connotations now, up until the middle of the 20th century it was a way to phrase Europe's ""problem"" of Jews. This problem wasn't just the notion of ""what do we do with all these darn Jews"" but it was more about the nature of Judaism versus the citizenship of various nations, the place of the Jewish people within those nations, the extent to which they deserved rights and protections (so much as they were offered by the government at all) and their ethnic or cultural identity. Was a German Jew a Jew or was he a German? In the early part of the 19th century it was actually thought, by some, albeit a minority, that Napoleon was the Jewish messiah. Specifically because, under Napoleon's implementation of the French Revolution, Jews were treated as full French Citizens. All the laws of the state applied to them equally. Not to sing his praises, because he did put restrictions back on them at some point (I don't remember the exact timeline of events).  So, you have this overall pan-European societal quesiton of what is the place of Jews in the various societies of Europe. Couple that with the historical antisemitism emanating from both the Catholic and Lutheran churches, and well into the industrial revolution, coupled with the heyday of European colonialism and this notion of Zionism begins to take root in the collective Jewish conscious. And it seems an appealing idea to many non Jews. There's a state for Frenchmen, a state for Germans, why not a state for Jews?  Then WWI breaks out, and the Ottoman Empire is destroyed, its territory claimed by the victors, and we have the British Protectorate of Palestine. So, finally there is this place, outside of Europe, the Jewish ancestral homeland, which is now open to Jews, (thanks to the Brits) and the notion of forming a Jewish state out of the protectorate of Palestine becomes official British government policy.  There are large obstacles to this, however, and the British also take their sweet time and don't have the lax immigration rules that they should to accomplish said goal.   Then WWII happens. And we all know what happens. And after the devastation of the Holocaust, through (in my opinion) equal parts guilt and determination, the Allied powers facilitate the creation of the state of Israel.   And then, with a Jewish population in the US approximately equal to that of Israel, the US finds itself with a strategic ally in the region, though common language culture and a bit of shared religious history. I would argue that since the Independence War, the continued existence of Israel is (militarily) dependent on the US. Not that the Israelis can't take care of themselves, but hey, it's not a big country and we (the US) make a lot of weapons.   The continued existence of both Jews and the current existence of the State of Israel can be understood in the historical contexts in which they developed.   While Jews and Judaism are not unique in their ethno-religious survival since antiquity, it probably has something to do with the fact that Christianity asserts itself as a continuation of Judaism. While the church was responsible for a large amount of antisemitism, its domination did mean that this particular ethno-religious minority, of which their own savior was a member, couldn't be completely regarded as something that needed to be destroyed or converted. Their existence was tolerated, to an extent."

I'd like to add that your friend is essentially engaging in the survivorship bias -- the fact of Judaism's existence up to this point is evidence of nothing more than its tenacity.

Any of them could have claimed the same thing...right up to the point where they ceased existing.  It's essentially survivor bias combined with anthropically fallacious reasoning. Anyone can claim that their own culture miraculously survived, because whatever culture someone is part of, it must be one of the ones that has survived (at least so far). There are plenty that didn't, but nobody is making this argument about them because they no longer have any members around to do so.  Are the events that allowed the jewish religion and culture to persist statistically anomalous, to the point of standing out among all other examples? I doubt it. Hinduism has been around as long as judaism or longer, and buddhism almost as long. The ancient egyptian religion was also practiced for a similar length of time (~3000 years) before dwindling and dying out around the beginning of the christian era. Judaism represents perhaps a more unusually small proportion of the world population than those examples, but when you factor in the emphasis they place on maintaining their own genetic/cultural purity, it doesn't seem to be much of a stretch."

DebateAnAtheist,3e08c2,TheDudeAbides491,0,Tue Jul 21 01:01:03 2015 UTC,"Easy to answer. Israelite culture and identity revolves a lot around the Jewish religion, which is traced back to the Ancient era. The Jewish religion is by nature isolationist (Jews are the chosen ones, everyone else is beneath the Jews, avoid mixing with outsiders). Thus, Jews remained a tight-nit group even when they had ""no homeland"" between the Medieval and the Modern ages. In 1000 years we might hear similar arguments from the Amish or the Mormons for example.  China has had and still has similar cultural/theological ideologies, with the whole Kingdom of Heaven and the Mandate from Heaven thing (don't mix with foreigners, avoid them and ignore them). China is probably the longest-living national entity in human history. Does this mean the ""Chinese religion"" is the correct one? Of course not. It just means the Chinese managed to stay pure as a group.  In fact, most nationalities will claim this. The Greeks for example, who were conquered by the Turks for 400 years, never lost their identity as Greeks and the Greek Diaspora (those who migrated to other countries) still called themselves Greek, and managed to create a nation of their own again. It can all be explained on how exclusive, isolationist and traditional each cultural group is (and how big their neighboring cultures are in enforcing their own culture on conquered people), and doesn't require gods to enter the equation."

Modern human behavior appears to have risen up about 50,000 years ago, and it took them 7 million years to get there after splitting from their ancestors. For another species to evolve the same set of behaviors, it would need to have environmental pressures pushing it in that direction, plus a similar time frame to come about. For another intelligent species to arise within the past 50000 years we've been around would be an incredible coincidence.  Remember that evolution doesn't have some end-goal other than survival of the fittest. Saying one species is ""more evolved"" than another doesn't really make any sense. Species are just more fit to survive in their ecological niche than others are."
DebateAnAtheist,3dzyjx,EdwardHarley,2,Mon Jul 20 22:21:24 2015 UTC,Interesting.  However isn't it true that many of the same species alive today share this timeline?  Why didn't any ocean mammal pod create a land going device for exploration?  Why didn't any flying animal develop a culture of language to document their history?  I would argue that these concepts of design and heritage reflect some of the ideals I am trying to describe and that the absence of their combined value in any other species is a relevant point when considering what makes the human spirit unique.

It's as bizarre as saying the end goal of gravity was this solar system, or that blackhole.  Natural selection is a force jut the same as gravity.  It is a brute fact of existence, possibly even moreso than gravity.  You are climbing up a tree and picking out a branch and calling it special because it is the one you climbed on.  Ocean mammals don't have appendages for making tools of that level of complexity, though they do use tools.  Flying animals lack the cranial capacity to develop wrutten language.  It makes sense that land based mammals would develop the way we have, at least on one branch.  Intelligence had some pre requisites though.  Most notably, energy.  Walking upright freed up a TREMENDOUS, amount of energy.  More than other animals by far.  That fueled our ability to devote energy to other functions.  All were experimented with for the most part, but long distance running, sweating, and tracking all seemed to be preferred along with others.  The tracking is the interesting one, it allowed for a lower expenditure of energy, which could then be used to fuel social and intellectual development.  Soon you had people grouping together based on skills and dividing up labor, which freed more energy, and on and on.  It's all about energy.  That's really it at the end of the day.  This particular branch of animals went this way because that resulted in an efficient use of energy via natural selection and dumb ass luck.  There is no big mystery.  Nothing but energy and laws and probability.  That's really it.  It's not what some would call a grand answer, but it's very zen to me.  And i see nothing but awe and beauty in it."

What makes them lofty? They're lofty because we like them. As far as evolution is concerned, they aren't necessarily lofty. For natural selection, 'lofty' means it helps reproduction. A crab that can paint is not necessarily going to reproduce better than a crab that doesn't care two figs about painting.  The thing to bear in mind is that evolution doesn't drive 'towards smartness.' Life isn't evolving to be smart for smartness sake. Plenty of unintelligent life succeeds admirably.   Our evolutionary ancestors happened to evolve the beginnings of smarts, and our circumstances happened to be those that smarts helped us succeed. If being smart hadn't helped us succeed, they'd likely have died out. We had the right opportunity, and the right circumstances. Our painter crab might have the right opportunity, but he has the wrong circumstances, and he gets eaten.    It appears to me that ""social-evolution"" for ""lower-beasts"" has reached a plateau of evolution that currently could be deemed insurmountable. In other words it appears they will not get smarter as a part of their evolution. Has that evolutionary process stopped?   I just wanted to reference this, because it points to the misunderstanding that evolution is striving for smarts. It isn't. Smarts is just one strategy that can arise out of many, like flight, speed, shells, scales, horns, teeth, burrowing. Single celled organisms that don't have brains have been evolving just as long as we have, they aren't 'more' or 'less' evolved than humans, or tuna, or trees.   Things that facilitate survival and reproduction are rewarded with survival. Being smart is not always advantageous, and sometimes other traits can be just as, or more, advantageous (Bob the Fish does a lot better than us at living in the ocean, smart or not).   Beyond that, the advantage of being smart has probably gone down a fair bit, because humans cover the world these days. We don't like competition, and being smart tends to require a lot of resources, which means a lot of space."

But what makes it more important than turtles being unique in their ability to retract into a protective shell, or caterpillars metamorphosing into butterflies? It is a powerful survival strategy for us, but not necessarily the best in all situations. There is nothing in evolution that either necessitates it will evolve or prosper if it did in another species.  I think it could arise again, but won't necessarily, when we are extinct, but now any species would be hard pressed to achieve intelligence alongside our dominance, due to our occupation of territory and resources.

Language is a product of many many many mutations piled on one another giving us a unique brain, just like everything else has a unique brain. Some other thing can be smart but develop in a different direction, just like birds and bats and bugs have wings, but not the same kind of wings. There are different structures and bones and materials involved.   So I don't think you are just being dense per se, it's just that you are stuck on ""why not"" when no one is saying 'not'. There just is no cause to assume species B will develop like species A and every reason to assume it won't, because you have many many random changes over many many generations.

Why haven't humans evolved bat-like sonar?    Your dismissal of these other examples in nature as one-offs is unjustified. Because those examples demonstrate that these phenomenon occur naturally. Once, you've established natural occurrence, then there is a measurable probability that those traits would evolve coincidentally.

Excellent point!  I think it is the idea of ""...an improbable arrangement of natural traits...""  that I am working through.  I believe I am accurately understanding a consensus in the discussions here that the ""human condition"" represents nothing more than ""genetic-chance"" and is worthy of no distinction.  I guess that is essentially the distinction between the faithful and ""the-rest"" but for the moment I still think I see a relevant distinction.  Namely that the concepts of a ""creator"" are frequently contradicted with legitimate, valid, and credible science illustrating observations in the natural world supporting what I have been referring to as evolution.    (...although part of my education in this discussion is a new personal evaluation of my own understanding of the evolutionary process.  :-)  )  The conclusion my understanding of these observations has been:  ""Many many traits and behaviors we attribute to Humanity are also present elsewhere in nature (decoration, social grouping, sexuality).

Perhaps I am dodging your point about my obligation to objectively associate this ""creation-trait"" with divinity, but not intentionally so.  For the moment I am very honestly asking.  If observation of the natural world is a counter to humanity's ""uniqueness"" then does that perspective have any central-theory as to why no other species have developed to combine these traits.

Ergo - these are not uniquely human.  Ergo - humanity has no special distinction in the environment.""   My answer here is going to be a little bit weird. My answer is this...  Consider the crocodile.  The crocodile has many traits that exist in nature. But through the combination of those traits and through some unique traits of its own, the crocodile is an amazingly efficient hunter with next to no predators. That is to say, the crocodile is an evolutionary champion, which is a big part of the reason it has remained unchanged for so many generations.   By evolutionary standards, the crocodile is special. But it's also natural. I think what gets lost in many of these discussions is that an understanding of evolution does not diminish our appreciation for the human condition. It heightens it. Every species is sculpted into a tight fit for its particular environment...even as it is helping to sculpt in return. Yes, humans are special. As is the crocodile...and the fruit bat...and the lamprey. Each of these species has settled upon a survival strategy that has assured its survival even as 99% of all species in Earth's history have gone extinct. What we have to be careful of is demanding that all other species be human in order to be special.    For the moment I am very honestly asking.  If observation of the natural world is a counter to humanity's ""uniqueness"" then does that perspective have any central-theory as to why no other species have developed to combine these traits.   Here's one of the things that I think a lot of people misunderstand. Sometimes ""why"" questions are actually ""how"" questions. And sometimes ""how"" is actually ""why"".   ""Why"" is a question of motivation.   ""How"" is a question of mechanism.   So if you asked why a car collision occurred, I might answer about comparative speeds and reduced coefficients of friction due to water.  This would explain the collision without imposing a need for an agent to decide the collision should happen.   So, why (sic) have other organisms not evolved many of our traits. First of all, there are a number of improbable traits that we have that would have to form. Bipedal movement being chief among them. Bipedalism is not common in nature an it makes a huge difference in terms of blood flow to the brain...so that's a gate. And yet there are some species that are predominantly bipedal, Emperor Penguins come to mind...and I would say there is a lack of need.   As I said, remember the crocodile. The crocodile is so well-adapted for assuring its survival that a change in strategy would only hurt it. So, with other species, why should they walk on 2 legs when it takes so much energy to do so.   The point is, it depends a lot on the environment. Flightless birds tend only to evolve on islands. The ostrich is a counter-example...but one that proves the point by following the same principle. The preponderance of food on the ground coupled with a dearth of predators removed the incentive for flight. So here is a remarkable, improbable, difficult trait to acquire that these birds have discarded.   It all comes down to what survival factors we're trying to come through.    And some ideas that suggest these behaviors are expected to manifest later on.   So, in general, new species form through a process called punctuated equilibrium. We always talk about survival of the fittest...but that's not really accurate. It's death I the unit, but that sounds so morose. What punctuated equilibrium suggests is that where there are resources, life will survive...but upset the system, and you're likely to see a whole lot of change.   Imagine there is a drought in Africa. And as a result, trees have less leaves. Along comes a population of giraffes, and each giraffe eats what it can. The shortest giraffes are going to struggle for food because all of the taller giraffes will eat those low leaves and leaves at their levels that the shorter giraffes can't reach. In the end, many of these shorter giraffes will starve. And this reduction in reproduction of shorter giraffes will mean your giraffe population skews taller. This is how evolution works.   I mention this because if you want to predict what species and traits will arise in the future, think about the human imposed mass extinctions, climate change, and strengthening of bacteria. Our future generations will have to be able to survive these crucibles...and will likely do so through some major adaptations. I wouldn't think that a competing social system with humanity would fare very well in this scenario...so no I don't expect those traits to converge again like they did for humans."

As others have said, its more of an r/askscience question. Specifically why and how a species would develop intelligence and why it'd be rare. The implications of this for theism and religious belief we can certainly discuss though.  One point to bring up is that we aren't the only species that were intelligent or are. Neanderthals may have been smarter than us, but were wiped out/interbred. Chimps and other primates do have culture and are capable of other advanced concepts, it may be that our competition is the reason no others have developed some of the things you discussed.   It appears to me that ""social-evolution"" for ""lower-beasts"" has reached a plateau of evolution that currently could be deemed insurmountable.

I suspect you are having trouble grasping the timescales involved, which is very understandable. Earth has been around for billions of years, humans in modern form were around for hundreds of thousands, civilization and many of the 'uniquely human' concepts you mentioned only a few thousand.   We're 'smarter' than other animals, but someone has to be the smartest and self-improving intergenerational shared intelligence is new even to our species.

We have wiped out the competition without mercy!  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal_extinction#Rapid_extinction_by_violence  Our freakishly large brains have yielded us an enormous advantage, while pushing innumerable species to brink of extinction and sometimes beyond. We have gone from being nearly extinct ourselves to the greatest extinction threat on the planet in a very short amount of time, from the evolutionary perspective, that is. It is simply very unlikely that two sentient species evolve within, say, 100k years from each other when the whole evolutionary timescale deals with millions of years. And even 100k gap would be fatal for the ""younger"" race: while the elder race has gunpowder and monarchies driven by greed and lust for power, the younger race does not even have agriculture. It would be genocide of native Africans and Americans all over again, except the technology gap would be even worse and there won't be any interbreeding. Imagine that instead of humans America was populated by sentient cavemen, I don't know... wolves. Do you think they have a single chance?  The evolution of other species has not reached a plateau, it's more like the king of the hill (us) is mercilessly throwing huge boulders at everyone who is below. Have humans and their nasty industries vacate the planet somehow (extinction via epidemics, evacuation to Mars, something else entirely) and it is possible chimps will rise as the next king of the hill."
DebateAnAtheist,3dzyjx,jmsolerm,4,Mon Jul 20 23:42:21 2015 UTC,"There are several critical moments in our evolutionary history that brought about our ""advanced"" civilization.  The most recent one is fire.  Controlling fire gave early hominids the ability to ward off predators and pursue more activity and exploration in the dark.  More interestingly, cooking with fire allowed us easy access to riches of nutritional stores found in plants and other food, leading to brain size expansion.  So far, we are the first species that have been able to do this on a consistent scale.  We have utterly crushed the evolutionary arms race when it comes to food.   It appears to me that ""social-evolution"" for ""lower-beasts"" has reached a plateau of evolution that currently could be deemed insurmountable. In other words it appears they will not get smarter as a part of their evolution.   Evolution only tinkers with a species enough to allow it to reproduce.  Once that has been achieved, there is no real drive to make a species smarter or more socially advanced. Had we not discovered fire, we might be stuck at a very similar plateau.  Hominids had a very fortunate combination of traits that allowed them to take an evolutionary leap.  But arguments from complexity are not proof of the Abrahamic god.  Evolution does a better job of explaining how we got here than a supernatural deity.  Our current society is a byproduct of our mental capacity, evolutionary leaps, and good fortune."
DebateAnAtheist,3dzyjx,Dead_Glove,2,Tue Jul 21 00:44:27 2015 UTC,"Excellent points!!  Thank you!  Can I share with you the notes I offered /u/clarkdd   I believe I am accurately understanding a consensus in the discussions here that the ""human condition"" represents nothing more than ""genetic-chance"" and is worthy of no distinction.  I guess that is essentially the distinction between the faithful and ""the-rest"" but for the moment I still think I see a relevant distinction.  Namely that the concepts of a ""creator"" are frequently contradicted with legitimate, valid, and credible science illustrating observations in the natural world supporting what I have been referring to as evolution.    (...although part of my education in this discussion is a new personal evaluation of my own understanding of the evolutionary process.  :-)  )  The conclusion my understanding of these observations has been:  ""Many many traits and behaviors we attribute to Humanity are also present elsewhere in nature (decoration, social grouping, sexuality).  Ergo - these are not uniquely human.  Ergo - humanity has no special distinction in the environment.""  For now though I am still seeing a distinction when the benefit of combining these traits occurs.  I think that combination creates the Mona Lisa, the Eiffel Tower, the Colosseum , etc...  (There is very obvious counter points here about the negative impact human creativity has had on the world, but I think that is actually a separate discussion.)  For the moment I am very honestly asking.  If observation of the natural world is a counter to humanity's ""uniqueness"" then does that perspective have any central-theory as to why no other species have developed to combine these traits.  I am seeing some interresting discussion about ""niche"" events, that seems very interresting.  And some ideas that suggest these behaviors are expected to manifest later on.  I'll be reviewing those, but am very thankful for your response and equally exited to hear any thoughts that come from this.  Thoughts?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dzyjx,Greghole,3,Tue Jul 21 15:20:00 2015 UTC,"Ergo - humanity has no special distinction in the environment.   I think it's a bit rash to say that humanity has no special distinction or that we are not unique.  Our species is obviously gifted and though our traits and lineage can be observed in many other species detailing our mundane origin, the particular combination of our traits is what makes us human, and therefore unique.  We should be careful when defining the word ""unique"" not to imbue it with supernatural meaning.  I could find a unique rock formation that appears nowhere else on earth but it would still be made by natural processes out of natural materials.  As to why other species have not advanced to our combination of traits?  Well, our particular set of traits is not an evolutionary goal, but a byproduct of happenstance.  So other species could get there eventually, but it's certainly not guaranteed.  Our presence alone may guarantee that no other species could achieve our level of sophistication anymore.  We may also just have the privilege of being at this level first.  If, say, the evolutionary paths on earth were different and octopods became the first species to gain sentience, they may be asking the same exact question as to why no other species gained a similar level of evolutionary advancement.  Also remember that evolution works on geological time scales.  It took 60 million years for primates to evolve into modern day humans.  We may be looking at an animal already in existence as the next evolutionary sentient species, but they are 30 million years away from completing that step."

But by the time they hit the age of 15, chemistry for example becomes, for most students, an annoying boring non-understandable luxury that they do not want or need. And for us it is a financial burden. We need to drop it. Can you now give me credit here?"
DebateAnAtheist,3e04f1,pineappletrauma,3,Tue Jul 21 01:14:58 2015 UTC,Most people who take chemistry in high school don't go on to become chemists but those who do likely would not have if they had never been introduced to the subject in school.  We teach a broad range of subjects in high school because the basic knowledge is useful and it also gives students a chance to see what they are interested in and what they have an aptitude for.

I'm saying the long argument is only ever going to convince certain types who were predisposed to questioning dogma in the first place. Advocates for secularism are totally missing all the people too lazy to sit through an hour long Sam Harris lecture, right?   The end game can't be to only convince the people who are predisposed to being convinced by walls of facts and explanations about the burden of proof, right? I feel that atheists in the US (not to presume about the nationalities of those present) will pretty much just go home and stop worrying about it once there is no threat of theological incursion into public decision making. That's the end game, a country exactly as secular as was originally intended. Doesn't getting there mean we have to convince people without requiring them to read a biology textbook? Doesn't that mean making emotional appeals and appeals to common sense, even if that argumentation isn't based in perfect logical analysis of the facts?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,baalroo,2,Sat Jul 18 00:33:35 2015 UTC,"Um, but this is a very effective and convincing argument. I'm so confused right now. Did you intend for this to support the idea that shorter is better, or have you accidentally proven yourself wrong?"

DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,Being_and_Thyme,8,Sun Jul 19 21:25:20 2015 UTC,"You're probably glazing over because it has become repetitive. That being said, I'm wondering what alternatives you had in mind. The thing about long form debates is the idea that shorter, quipper alternatives will do a disservice to the topics, and atheism-theism-agnosticism-whatever is inescapably abstract. It's too easy to misinform if you leave things too short.  Part of the other thing to remember is that alot of these debates, to my eye, follow the usual form of a university lecture--and most of the people who participate in these debates have had some affiliation with a university at some point in their careers. For the debaters, I thus imagine that long form debate is simply quite comforting and conducive to how they express ideas."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,nabuzasan,2,Fri Jul 17 17:48:34 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with any of that. I suppose you're correct about the correlation between misinformation and using shorter, snappy dialogue to persuade.  It just seems that the biggest obstacle to secularism is that it requires individuals to accept things they can't wrap their heads around. You don't have to take what an evolutionary biologist says on faith, but unless you really want to engage with the material and put an effort into informing yourself you aren't going to come away with the full picture about evolution. Same thing for physics.   I guess what I'm saying is, if the only people we can persuade are intellectually responsible and naturally concerned with well parsed, properly recorded evidence, we're pretty much never going to convince anyone with whom we didn't already agree."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,Being_and_Thyme,5,Fri Jul 17 18:05:49 2015 UTC,"I would disagree with that.  I used to be a Christian and it was these long debates where i heard the theists side say what i already agreed with and the atheist side that i disagreed with and i found them interesting and feel that they were instrumental with me becoming an atheists.  So there are people who will listen and change, but those that won't will not do so on shorter conversations either.  There are some that just will not listen no matter what."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,Being_and_Thyme,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:26:35 2015 UTC,"Right no, I worded that dumb - like. What I meant was secularism was going to get you and your type anyway. You're the kind of person who's going to be convinced by honest and painstaking laying out of the facts, but that your sort is also limited.   To prevent bad public policy and investment in shitty religious education we need to be convincing to, well,  intellectually disinterested people in addition to those willing to critically examine their own assumptions."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,slipstream37,2,Sat Jul 18 00:13:25 2015 UTC,"I think your overgeneralizing a bit. It seems like a theist could say the same thing about theism as you are about secularism and leave it at that--that not as widespread acceptance is due to people simply not understanding God, which is certainly a possibility, but I doubt we'd leave it at that.   The failure of a given theory to accommodate a greater number of supporters isn't always due to the fact that people can't wrap their heads around it (although obviously that is a possibility with any given complex topic), it might also have to do with the fact that it is simply unconvincing--for whatever reason, perhaps people don't feel the evidence is at a minimum strong enough to even grant a level of warrant for belief, or perhaps the evidence is presented badly. There are multiple things we could unpack in a topic as epistemologically and psychologically deep as the question of ""what motivates beliefs?"""

DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,nietzkore,1 point,Sat Jul 18 00:38:54 2015 UTC,"You'd be surprised how much that doesn't work, how snappy and hard to ignore doesn't equal convincing.  When gay rights activists wanted to convince California voters to repeal Prop 8 (which banned same-sex marriage in a previous referendum), they went to neighbourhoods and knocked on doors. Previous strategies with people who said they would vote to keep the ban in place involved basically talking alot about equality right up front--and it failed.   So they tried something different. They took more time and instead of talking about equality, the campaigners would get the voters to talk about themselves, how they felt about the issue, how it affected them personally. And overtime, usually 15 minutes, the campaigner worked their way to revealing that they were in fact gay or how they themselves were affected by the ban. No upfront mention of equality at all during this 15 minutes, and by the end of it, people who were very certain that they would vote to keep the ban ended up almost completely changing their minds. Other campaigners experienced similar results with the issue of abortion."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,Wimmsk,2,Sat Jul 18 13:45:44 2015 UTC,"I'm all about ignoring biblical /religious scriptures and ideas and asking how they know something is true. Once you get into faith, you can attack that as an unreliable epistemology. There should be enough time to understand what faith is, how faith is unreliable, how faith leads to different outcomes, and how we can use better epistemologies to discern truth. That plants the seed that leads to atheism.  (look into Street Epistemology)"

In the end the last 30 minutes to an hour is Q&A with the audience.  It seems like a perfect amount of time. It also helps if there are varied topics, and each side actually listens to the other and responds."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,FLSun,2,Sat Jul 18 06:31:25 2015 UTC,"It seems to depend on what goal you wish to achieve with your debate.   The idea of ""both sides"" having time to present their position without interruption, allowing uninvolved people to get to know them, and people of one side to be presented with polished and high-quality counter-arguments and points of view from the other one seems quite a good idea. Having them then react to the other side, maybe even ending in direct discussion or answering audience questions, is a great idea to spread information, knowledge, and understanding the viewpoints of others.  Formalizing it and training for it - such as it seems to be loved in the US - seems pretty counter-productive and leads to quite long-winded monologues, aimed at presenting formalized bullet points, gish gallop, trying to get a ""gotcha"" moment and so on.  I, for one, can barely stand them; at least not ideologically charged ones, such as religius ones often are. People like WLC might have good points (well, maybe not him), but it is buried in such a huge pile of crap, rote, lecture, condescension, evasion, and word games, that it is simply going to waste.  Do it with honesty, find engaging people, bring forth your best arguments, and I might be interested. Let both sides be open, don't play games, don't evade, don't change the topic, and have both be at least comparatively experienced in debates without anyone trying to ""score"", and I am perfectly willing to listen. I probably won't change my mind, but I might learn quite a bit new, and maybe change my position on some topics.  Otherwise, stop them. Or at least shorten them. Listening to 20/30/40 minutes of rambling before someone can react seems to be the worst possible way to engage or inform people."

I'm not accepting the premise until they can demonstrate it to be true. Arguing about the laryngeal nerve is stupid because you've accepted the premise that if god made it, he knows more than you. And now you are trying to argue that he did it wrong. Well he knows more than you, so...

DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,kilkil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:43:34 2015 UTC,"Well I think those points you brought up were tailored to punch holes in the mind - fortress most theists erect for themselves. I agree that these aren't the real nails in the coffin, and that they sort of engage on a theological plane instead a scientific one, but that was the point I was trying to articulate above: theists have demonstrated that logical process and evidence won't change their minds, so doesn't that put the onus on us to engage them in a way that will be convincing, even if it is distasteful?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,TowardsZero,0,Sat Jul 18 00:06:12 2015 UTC,"theists have demonstrated that logical process and evidence won't change their minds   That's just flat out wrong. Theists change their minds all the time. They sure wont if you go yammering on about the laryngeal nerve, but if you have better debate tactics its not impossible."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,kilkil,2,Mon Jul 20 22:02:08 2015 UTC,"When I try to debate or bandy words with theists, I always have to start with trying to remember and express to them all sorts of information about the history of the bible, the reason the science we accept is convincing, and even refute old standbys like old earth creationism (God lies to test you theory). It's a clumsy process, and it tends to fizzle after a few minutes because they won't accept that looking like an ape and being almost genetically identical to apes means we're apes.   The problem with debating a theist is that Atheists and Theists use two different methods, or tools to decide what is true or false. Atheists use evidence. If an Atheist is presented with evidence that contradicts his position on an issue he will change his position if he is intellectually honest. He realizes that he has no choice but to change his position to conform with the evidence. If an Atheist applies Critical Thinking Skills to the Theory Of Evolution and studies the evidence he realizes that he has no choice to make regarding the veracity of Darwins Theory. Once he grasps the Theory he no longer has a choice to make. The evidence has already made that choice for him. The evidence has given him the Knowledge that The Theory Of Evolution is true. He no longer has a choice to believe or not believe.   A theist on the other hand use Faith, or belief, to determine what is true or false. Simply put, if a Theist chooses to believe in something it is automatically true. No evidence needed only a strong belief is necessary. Conversely, if a Theist chooses not to believe in something it is automagically false. Damn the evidence, screw the facts. Theories are merely unproven opinions. Claims and evidence are synonyms. Don't believe me? Ask them for evidence that a religious claim is true. Watch them quote from their book of claims, the bible. In order for a fact to be true it also requires that they believe in it. Try it and see, Quote a fact from the Theory Of Evolution and watch them dismiss it by saying; ""I don't believe it."" They think they are given a choice to accept or reject Scientific Theories just by uttering the words; ""I don't believe it."" Or, I believe yadda yadda yadda. And their belief is all that is needed to make it true.   When debating a Creationist the worst thing you can do is to say; ""Well I believe in The Theory Of Evolution."" You don't have a belief. You have Knowledge. Instead, you should be saying; ""I have studied the evidence for the Theory Of Evolution until I understood it. I now Know it is true. No belief necessary nor allowed.""  Secondly, When debating a Creationist don't waste your time presenting them with evidence or quoting facts. We all love to show a Creationist evidence for Archeopteryx, or the evidence for the evolution of whales. But what good does that really do when the Creationist smugly puffs his chest out and proclaims; ""I don't believe it!!""   Instead the thing to do is to look them in the eye and ask them; ""What makes you think you were given a choice?""  ""If I were to ask you if you believe in the Heliocentric Theory, your answer would probably be ""Yes."" But think about this, a ""Belief"" is a Voluntary position we take on a subject. We can choose to either Believe or Not Believe. So if you choose to Believe in the Heliocentric Theory, then I can choose Not to Believe in the Heliocentric Theory. Does my disbelief make the Heliocentric Theory suddenly false?  Does that mean the Earth stops revolving around the Sun?  Of course not. Your Belief or my Disbelief has no bearing at all on what is true or false. What about Germ Theory? Atomic Theory? Electromagnetic Theory? Do we get a choice to believe or not believe in those theories? Of course not. When it comes to determining what is true or false, We. Don't. Get. A. Choice. The evidence has already made that choice for us. This is what you need to impress upon the Creationist.    Lastly, When debating someone with an opposing position, your goal is not to force your opponent to admit defeat and surrender to your superior intellect. That's never going to happen even if you are in the right. Your goal is to convince the fence sitters in the audience, the people reading your comments in a forum. Those are the people you are trying to convince. And if you do it right you will get people to lean to your side."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,TowardsZero,1 point,Fri Jul 17 23:56:20 2015 UTC,"I am rarely ever convinced by one debate alone.   I am usually convinced by seeing multiple short arguments over a long span of time (days, months, years even), and then eventually getting curious enough about the arguments to research more or ask others how they feel. It's a slow process, for me, to formulate my ideas and beliefs.  So perhaps it is a good idea to limit ourselves to short snippets, and those that are curious enough to go more in depth will search for the unabbreviated content elsewhere.  Then again, there is the reasonable concern that abbreviating your ideas will allow the possibility for misconception or gross oversimplification. ""You think that this universe all came from nothing?!""   However, with our Twitter Age 140-character attention spans, we might have no choice but to learn how to be more concise. Clusters of brevity might just beat out a single volume of wordiness."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,kilkil,1 point,Sat Jul 18 04:18:10 2015 UTC,"The thing is, a good explanation is usually a long one. Making your arguments longer isn't necessarily a good thing, but the more bulletproof you want your argument to be, the more you have to write it out."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,keepthepace,0,Sat Jul 18 13:37:28 2015 UTC,"An argument rooted in bullet proofness of it is just dumbing down on the real truth. You put so much armour in it, that the real crux or substance in it gets lost.   It tells about a psychology rooted in fear of failure. A healthy argument would be precise, unshielded, and would ignore the stupid replies around it - rather than pad an armour. That is the tactic of weak minded."
DebateAnAtheist,3dn9la,HaiKarate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 14:01:15 2015 UTC,"I, uh... um.   ""Armour"" isn't a bad thing. It's basically stating your argument, then thinking, ""did I make any mistakes?"" Then you think about it, come up with objections, and then you try to see if you could defeat those objections. That way, you can ""protect"" your argument against ""attacks"" on its ""weak spots"", while also simultaneously getting a chance to find out whether you're really arguing for the right thing or not.   Of course, you could just go with no armour; it would certainly take up less words that way.   But all that does is make the discussion take up more comments.   Also, ""ignoring stupid replies"" isn't really... ""healthy"", as you say."

DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,MeshachBlue,1 point,Fri Jul 17 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"Or, all I would need to do is present a different possible causal link between the two corollaries. This would demonstrate that the conclusion you are jumping to is premature.  Let's split people into four groups based on two criteria:  -- apathy towards religion vs caring about the consequences it has;  -- believing in a religion vs not believing in any religion  People who believe in a religion can still be apathetic towards its effects on their lives initially. There are a large portion of Christians who are apathetic in this sense. As too are there a large portion of people who do not believe in any religion and are also apathetic about the consequences of that.  However, when one travels from the apathetic side over to the ""caring about the consequences side"" its like their initial stance becomes tested. This results in both ""camps"" so to speak readily swapping at this stage. If you live in a society where the previous generation was largely religious then you will experience a large number of people swapping to areligion during this stage in their life (if they ever go through it). If you live in a society which is largely areligious (like I do) then you will actually experience more people ""swapping"" in the other direction. The correlation appears to have a much higher dependence on the ""default"" religion of a culture. If the default is nothing of course those who are different from the default have been active in their decision and if the default is religion then those who are different from the default also need to have been active."

I understand how atheists are probably super frustrated with this
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,Shiredragon,4,Thu Jul 16 23:58:34 2015 UTC,"its completely logical to me.    so unless you are waxing philosophical in the extreme that simply isn't how logic works. There are functionally infinite systems of logic, but there are really only a few that are of any practical use.   when atheists tell you that your religion is 'illogical' they are saying that it is self-contradictory or it relies on faulty reasoning.   the problem as far as I can tell is faith. Atheists, at least the ones on /r/DebateAnAtheist simply don't have it. When we ask a question that seems to you like its been asked before, its probably because telling a christian that faith is dishonest and they ought to abandon any beliefs they have because of faith doesn't help anyone.   you will never hear an atheist say 'you have to take it on faith' and there is a reason for that"
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,worknman,4,Fri Jul 17 05:53:49 2015 UTC,"I agree with you that vague claims of being illogical are not productive. I come to the conclusion that almost all religious claims are illogical because I have never seen any reason to believe the laws of nature are suspended in our favor. And I see no reason to believe that all of existence was produced as an environment with our best interests at heart.  There are a number of different ways I think we can demonstrate this. First, what makes us so certain God is going to be fundamentally good? Of course it is the answer we want to be true, but beyond that. What reasons do we have to believe it even if we grant the existence of a supernatural being. I would say the evidence we do see is that nature has produced an almost unknowable amount of pure, abject suffering. So that isn't a great start. Most human, and animal, lives throughout history were relatively miserable. For thousands of years, we were relentlessly pursued by predators and then often died of extremely painful infections in our teeth at a young age.   It's only been 2000 years since the birth of Christ and we believe humans have been around for at least a couple hundred thousand years. 99.9% of all species that have ever existed went extinct. All of that extinction involved endless suffering from starvation, disease, and predation. As Stephen Fry says, if you're going to explain puppy dogs and flowers as coming from the goodness of God, then you also have to explain where the parasite that eats outward through young children's eyes, slowly blinding them, also came from. As one of the best lyrics ever written goes:  ""He who made kittens, put snakes in the grass.""  So it seems to me that, even if we grant God's existence, there is at least as much reason to believe he is indifferent at best to us. I find that the only way you can end up substantially in a different state of mind is to simply take much of what is written in the Bible as definition. Now this is where I think we actually run into the problem you were talking about. This is the crux of the issue. I claim that once someone takes the Bible on as expressing truths that are beyond anything that can be justified empirically, that is where the conversation truly breaks down.   So if the response to: ""Why do we think God is good despite the evidence we see around us?"" is along the lines of simply saying he must be good because of the example Jesus set and the miracles he performed, then the conversation has been killed. We are no longer making a logical argument built upon observation. We're making a logical argument based on revelation. So I wouldn't be one to say that belief in God is ""illogical"". I would say many of the claims of Christianity can be arrived at in a perfectly logical manner once the revealed truth of the Bible is taken as fact. The only way we can believe logically that it is acceptable for millions of children under five to starve to death miserably every year is if we take on the claims attributed to Jesus. If we simply take a scientific view of the world, which is rooted in the idea that observation trumps all, then I no longer see any way to logically argue in favor of basically any claim I've heard from any religion.  ""If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. In that simple statement is the key to science. It doesn’t make any difference how beautiful your guess is, it doesn’t matter how smart you are who made the guess, or what his name is… If it disagrees with experiment, it’s wrong. That’s all there is to it."" - Feynman  I'll shut up now. You asked an open-ended question ; )"
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,Shiredragon,2,Fri Jul 17 00:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think the real question that you need to ask yourself is how you came to the conclusion that Christianity is logical.  I tried to answer that question with Catholicism. I was never a practicing Catholic, but my family was Catholic so I just assumed it was ""the right way"". Trying to understand other views from different people might not be as effective as trying to understand your own views.  If your views make sense to you then how did you come to that conclusion?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,rigel2112,2,Thu Jul 16 23:56:01 2015 UTC,"There actually have been a couple of people who said that they have changed their views on theism based on discussions here.

What you get here that you would not get in other subs is that this one allows you to see arguments that theists think are good and hone your arguments to counter them or see other people's arguments to counter them.   Also, my views on gods have changed as well. I used to be an agnostic atheist. Now that I have thought about and discussed it more, I identify as a gnostic atheist. So my views have changed as well."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,markevens,1 point,Thu Jul 16 17:59:33 2015 UTC,"As I understand it, a gnostic atheist believes there is no God, and claims to know this for certain.

I realize what I'm talking about is the 'god of the gaps' argument, but the creation of the universe is a pretty giant gap :)  I don't believe in any specific god, but I do acknowledge there is a possibility that some being/entity might've put all this in motion, and that it didn't just happen by accident."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,HaiKarate,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:01:02 2015 UTC,"I will discuss your post in reverse if I may. I believe it will flow better. I also apologize for the length, but I feel it is needed to really illuminate my points.    but I do acknowledge there is a possibility that some being/entity might've put all this in motion, and that it didn't just happen by accident.   I would like to address the difference between possible and probable. Because there is (as far as we know currently) a a wall to our predictive and observational powers do to the creation event of the observable universe, you can throw around the claim that anything is possible. This is very disingenuous however since a lack of knowledge does not mean that we cannot make some educated qualifications on the state of things. Just to bring up an only atheist favorite because of the illuminating factors, I will bring up the claim of having a pink dragon in the garage. (We will not add the undetectable part for this discussion.) If I make this claim, you can immediately make some judgements. One of them being that there are no true dragons of the mythical type discussed existing or have ever according to all verifiable records. Second is that dragons are traditionally large. Assuming that I am not obscenely wealthy, any garage I own will not likely be too large. So size will be an issue if we are talking standard depiction of a dragon. Finally, this is a claim that, assuming you cannot go to my house and look, is unverifiable. Regardless of veracity, it is completely meaningless since it is separate from our discussion.   I use this to show how we can then make some rational decisions on how to attach how probable something is. You can easily show how my claim of having a pink dragon in my garage is dismissible. No evidence. No history. Not rational. So it is an enormous claim with no likelihood of being correct.   This is the same as saying a deity rests outside our universe. In fact, it is even worse if you say it is a deistic god since that is the only type that fits the observations (no evidence). There is absolutely no evidence that there is any design in the universe. All of current science gives us ever increasing pictures of how the observable universe developed. All of it via processes, not things that are changed and forced. This means that IF there was a deity, they set things in motion and watch. This means no interference and no evidence. Any claims about such gods would be speculation. Then we have the evidence that physics is constant throughout the universe and time. This would then lead to a number of things. Possible methods of the observable universe's creation, probably the same physics works prior to the current universe, etc. This would imply that there may very well be an eternal form of the universe, just we live in one of the many pockets, our observable universe.   So, can we say it did not happen? No. But we can show that to do so is to reach for straws to supports one's claim. Which, if you want to believe, do so. But this is a debate forum so I will point out the flaw.    a gnostic atheist believes there is no God, and claims to know this for certain.   Yes and no. I would like to discuss knowledge for a moment. The reason is that I believe more atheists do not claim to be gnostic due to a distinction of definitions that is detrimental to the use of the language and discussion.   I am a gnostic atheist in the same way I am gnostic that unicorns (in their magical form) are story time creatures. The same way I am gnostic that the Sun will rise tomorrow. The same way that I am gnostic that the Moon will not crash into the Earth. All of these things are possible. But none of them have any rational reason to not be true. Unicorns have been storied and have supernatural powers with no evidence for them. The sun will continue to rise unless the Sun stops existing or the Earth stops turning/does not orbit the Sun. These are all unreasonable to presume would happen. The Moon is actually receding from the Earth. So claiming it will fall to Earth would be laughable baring some ridiculous circumstance.   I am gnostic in the same way about gods. There is no evidence. All claims of such are easily dismissed with evidence, proof that such claims are unverifiable, or that the arguments are not logically sound and fail via logical fallacies. So, to believe that there is any reasonable chance that gods exist after humans have searched so hard and made so many claims is unreasonable. Thus, I claim to be a gnostic atheist. This is not to say I could not be wrong or won't change my mind. But I have no reason to believe I could be wrong based on all the evidence and discussion I have had.   Just for context, I was Catholic -> deist -> agnostic atheist -> gnostic atheist. I have not always been gnostic. I had to do a lot of discussing and analysis of the claims of agnostics (and myself at the time) and gnostic.   For the more specific context of why I think a creator is unlikely, it has to do with physics. First off is the consistency of physics. Black holes are a type of singularity, much of our predictive power starts to break down there, and our ability of observation does too. But, because they exist within the universe, we can get some information out of them. Stuff going into, around, and out of them. From this, we can see that since stuff can exist them, physics has not broken down just because it is a singularity. The universe prior to the Big Bang is also a singularity. So there is evidence that physics does not stop just because it is at a singularity, we just don't know the math/physics of it yet. Then there is the fact that there is reason to think that space is infinite. We see no bounds and have reason to think that it is limitless since more spacetime is being created via dark energy. (It is called dark not because it is mysterious, but because it was unknown until recently and we only observe it's effects.) This could lead to a method of universes being both created and isolated which would match our current universal conditions. (Do note, this is some what speculative. However it is a reasonable extrapolation of information.)   To conclude, that gives us infinite space and time to work with and continuity of physics. Thus I see no reason to assume a creator with no evidence for one.   Edit: adding a bit about evidence for why I think there is not a creator Edit: done"
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,kyleclements,2,Sat Jul 18 21:21:24 2015 UTC,"I would like to address the difference between possible and probable. Because there is (as far as we know currently) a a wall to our predictive and observational powers do to the creation event of the observable universe, you can throw around the claim that anything is possible.   So are you saying:  agnostic atheist = probable, gnostic atheist = possible  ?  I'm in the 'possible' camp myself. If the universe was created by something or someone, I don't automatically assume it was some god or deity. It might've been an alien, or some being in an alternate dimension that got bored and set all this up and just watched, kind of like a kid might do with an ant farm. Hell, we could be in some Matrix-style simulation. I don't say this is probable, but until we know one way or the other, just that I'm at least willing to entertain the possibility. Because we all got here somehow ..."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,cenosillicaphobiac,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:31:14 2015 UTC,"What I am trying to get at is that just saying something is 'possible' because we don't know is not saying that it is likely. (And I don't mean like 90% or something silly. Even .001% would be more likely than any gods given the facts we have.) People too often take the tact that 'just because it has not been seen does not mean it is not real' to justify absurd leaps of logic. We can make some general assignments of probabilities to different claims however.  For example: No creator (creators) of the universe - Reasonable. A non-deity creator to the universe - Perhaps, but then you get into 'turtle stacking'. A deity(s) created the universe - Wishful thinking.   There is one exception in the deities category, that being a deistic god. But it is not worth mentioning since it is effectively non-existent if it exists making the discussion moot and once again an exercise of faith."

It’s this:  Religion is ultimately dependent on belief in invisible beings, inaudible voices, intangible entities, undetectable forces, and events and judgments that happen after we die.  It therefore has no reality check.  And it is therefore uniquely armored against criticism, questioning, and self- correction. It is uniquely armored against anything that might stop it from spinning into extreme absurdity, extreme denial of reality… and extreme, grotesque immorality.   - http://freethoughtblogs.com/greta/2009/11/25/armor-of-god/"

There is a good reason people say that the quickest path the atheism is reading the bible cover to cover.  Also I am a former full baptist christian.

Many Christians have never questioned their beliefs and have never had the chance to test out their mental faculties or use them for deceit.   My opinion is that being Christian and believing in many of the things that Christianity tends to ascribe to is however intellectual dishonesty. There are facets of christianity that cannot be possibly true and many places wherein christianity tends to contradict itself and therefore to believe in a christian worldview and know of those inconsistencies is to be intellectually dishonest.

DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,pyrespirit,13,Thu Jul 16 10:28:43 2015 UTC,"The funny thing about the spread of atheism is that it follows ( with a few exceptions ) very closely behind high quality mass education. When people are taught to question everything and come to their own conclusions, it's only natural that a belief system that survives on faith and no physical evidence (The Bible, even if it's /possibly/ divine, cannot be authenticated as such.) will come under scrutiny.   A lot of the time, in countries with a very high number of religious people, it's often incredibly hard for an atheist to ""come out"" even if he has questioned and given up on his belief. That's why it might seem that you have never really met an atheist, when instead they are just too afraid to admit their lack of faith.  From the tone of your questions and posts here, it feels like you might be headed down this path yourself. It's often confusing, and almost certainly scary. But once you've started to doubt, there's no real turning back. You'll pick away at the paint until you've uncovered the truth of the canvas underneath."

As your faith grows in God and you try to really follow Gods word people start noticing a warm feeling or a feeling of euphoria when praising and worshiping God. This is only the begining of a change in you. most Christians experience this and I know people and science can also explain this phenomena as chemical reactions that ocur when falling in love for the first time. basically its like a honeymoon period as you learn about Jesus dying for your sins and that there is hope because God loves you.

Some times intentionally. Many societies where religion is prevalent look down on or may even criminalize atheism. Due to hatred and misunderstanding, atheist then have a vested interest in just avoiding the topic.    Why do you think its so widespread in the USA?    Actually, it is lower in the USA than in most affluent and educated countries. The USA is an outlier in the data with our relatively low rate of atheism. It is, however, on the rise.   A number of correlating factors are involved. Higher education and more wealth both are correlated with a higher rate of atheism. This is probably due to the fact that higher wealth means less stress and allows for clearer thinking. Also, higher education leads to noticing that many of the claims of 'god did it' are really not miraculous. When one can see the chain of events, there is not a need for a special actor such as a god. This can lead to greater skepticism and critical thinking.    Is it ok to ask a christian question to atheists and what the would do in my or their own positions?   You can ask whatever you want. We will answer what we want."

So don't be afraid to just try and see what happens with any questions you have.  I myself live in the Netherlands, not in the USA, and have actually never been a theist. I don't know why atheism is as widespread as it is (although it doesn't appear to be THAT widespread from a Dutch perspective). ""Because it's right"" is not a real answer because the things that are right are far from always widespread.  Many people have their own reasons to be an atheist. They will vary widely from person to person. But I think it's mostly because religion can clearly be tied to a lot of controversial topics where it is seen as being on the wrong side of history. Being oppressive and restrictive to the detriment of people's lives. It's not the reason I am an atheist but it does turn a lot of people off of (organized) religion. In short for a lot of people religion is not a positive force in their lives."

Indoctrination, education, and critical mass.  If you catch them young, and keep up the message into adulthood, it's very hard to reverse the grip religion has.  There comes a tipping point, when religion is adopted by the majority, and likewise, the same for religion to die off into the myth it always was.  Europe happens to be ahead of the curve, with signs showing the US is following.  There was a statistical chart I saw on here a while back, that showed a direct link between internet uptake, and loss of religion. Education is key."

DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,EdgarFrogandSam,8,Thu Jul 16 19:32:57 2015 UTC,"you guys ask loaded questions to the christians and I know its probably just for shits and giggles.   I tend to see the 'loaded questions' pop up in a way for an easy debate on the atheist's side. From what I can see (having 'hopped the fence' from christianity to atheism), most atheists (myself included) consider our viewpoint to be 'correct'. It's abundantly clear, and pretty much 99% of scientists agree. And the same tried and true 'arguments' have been debunked/questioned/etc. It's an easy way to point out why people are atheists in the first place. It's not for shits and giggles.   But these post seem to repeat and then gets boring.   Having to bash my head in trying to explain why people are wrong is indeed boring. This goes for more than religion. But I see the same types of thinking and dogmatic protection of ideas in both religion and other incorrect/falsely held beliefs.   Why not ask for christian views on topics    I have and do. 99.99% of the time they just quote the bible, say it's fact, and that they can personally talk to some magic man in the sky. I've already read the bible and have issues (plenty of contradictions pointed out already), and I've already tried the talking to the magic man thing (spoilers: it didn't work).  Quite frankly I'm kinda tired of hearing the same old ""but you gotta BEEEELLLIIIEVEE!"" But I still press on, hoping to hear something that'll radically change my views. It's happened before.   then state yours   If you have any questions, feel free to ask.   so we all get something to think about rather than just trying to prove your right and I'm wrong   Generally it's more about getting people to realize they are wrong, and to correct themselves. The majority of my views are self-consistent, and accurate with what we observe in reality. That's pretty rare I find. Not even a lot of atheists have a consistent worldview."

Well there'll be immature trolls wherever you go.   My faith went over to the spiritual side a long time ago so im never offended by any views or interpretations about the bible,   For me it's pretty much the opposite. Grew up around people who believed it, so it seemed like a 'correct' thing that I just hadn't learned in school yet. Did a summer thing for it, and generally thought it was pretty cool.... until I tried putting it into practice. Lots of ""talk to god/jesus"", ""pray"", etc. sort of stuff. Which ultimately lead me into some pretty crazy mental breakdowns and the ultimate realization that it wasn't doing shit.  I still take people up on their offers to try and get this ""personal relationship with god"" thing going. Since I can't seem to do it properly.  That's what broke the acceptance for me, and from there it's been mostly ""well maybe it's true"" and migrating over to ""well shit, it's hard to believe that even if I wanted it to be true."" You'd have to radically upend my current understanding of the universe if you wanted me to accept a theist position at this point.   I believe talking and listening to someones way of thinking is the only way to better your own.    While I don't think it's the only way, I do think it's a particularly good way of doing it. Since you not only strengthen and dig into your own thoughts, but you also get an opposing (or complimentary) view to guide you.   But would love to hear about the contradictions youve found,   This image gets posted a lot. And just googling around will reveal quite a bit of them. There's also (IIRC) a 'skeptics annotated bible' which points all this stuff out. And that's just the problems internally. Even if you had a fully self-consistent book, you'd still need to prove it had any bearing on reality. IMO, spiderman is more internally consistent than the bible, and much more likely to be true. Just to give a comparison.  At this point, I really don't bother trying to debate the bible. I've yet to see it proven to be anything more than fiction. Instead, I go after more metaphysical and philosophical debates. But I think I've pretty much squared away an ultimate creator narrative as well. Minor deities are still possible though.  Though hope's not all lost, I have accepted a type of reincarnation. So there's that."

I would submit that you will find far more presuppositioning on the religious side.  Most debates seem to involve atheists pointing out the logical disconnects in theological arguments.  As others have pointed out, we are not ignorant of what Christians think.  In America, I've found that most atheists were once religious and gave religion every chance to make itself real to them.  They've had the feelings of deep faith, but now realize that they were just engaging in wishful thinking.  Does it get boring?

Not gona go further into that as im sure you are familiar with it but I feel I must point out this isnt the warm fuzzy feeling spirit or the incredible coincidence alot of christiaans talk about. This would be the one revealing God in the way most people want him to. Because of this I have absolutely no desire forcing my personal beliefs on others or proving theirs wrong. Confrontation and judging other people is not Gods way.  My upbringing was interesting to say the least as im from south africa and was raised during and after apartheid. So growing up I was taught to think a certain way and after when apartheid ended I was in high school and forced myself to go against everything I knew. Im here to learn about christian views from a non biased teaching and since most atheist are ex christians  this seems like a good source. Sad to say that the christian subreddit has a tendency to answer my questions with bible quotes, ive been a christian for over 20 years and already know Gods word theirin. atheist dont get offended about some of the more controversial questions I want to ask and dont normally cite scripture as  the default answer."

DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,shamdalar,1 point,Fri Jul 17 04:56:04 2015 UTC,This is a great question. And the specific answer I was looking for all the years of calling myself a christian but now looking back know that my faith was was still actually dead and still havent found God. It was the testimonial of a man who was trying to kill himself and experiencing a miracle. He was dead for 3 days and was talking about what happened to him and being given second life by God. Explaining that when he was judged by a Man he now knows was God he was not being judged for his actions or how well he kept the commandments.In his own words God was not judging him but he himself was judging himself for not seeking God. This instantly hit home with me and for the first time I can say I had 100% faith in Gods existance. This was also the first time the Holy spirit truly awakened in me taking me from believing in an unknown and distant God to meeting God for the first time! So yes I believe everyone goes to heaven but whether Jesus knows you or not is the judgement process and the key to gaining entry to heaven or sent to hell. As no man is divine or holy or without sin you can only gain eternal life through Jesus Christ.

He was dead for 3 days and was talking about what happened to him and being given second life by God.   To clarify, you're not referring to Jesus, as Jesus is not suicidal, correct?  So you believe somebody aside from Jesus was revived after being dead for 3 whole days?   Explaining that when he was judged by a Man he now knows was God he was not being judged for his actions or how well he kept the commandments.In his own words God was not judging him but he himself was judging himself for not seeking God.   So you're saying God doesn't do any judging, because we judge ourselves?  So if I don't judge myself negatively for not seeking God, then God is cool with that and I get to go to heaven?  Or what?  Are you saying the main qualifier for getting into heaven whether or not you personally feel like you deserve it?  Because I imagine most people would be able to rationalize their life and come up with a reason to say that they deserve it.  Or is it that you have to believe that you believed in God to get in, and if you didn't believe in him enough to satisfy yourself, you shouldn't let yourself into heaven?  If it's the latter, it seems strange that God would care more about whether you acknowledged him then if you lived a good life... So do you believe that a serial baby rapist and murderer who believes in the Judeo-Christian God would get into heaven, while a charitable, atheistic Buddhist would not?   So yes I believe everyone goes to heaven but whether Jesus knows you or not is the judgement process and the key to gaining entry to heaven or sent to hell.

And yes I do believe everyone goes to heaven to be judged as this is where God resides currently and I cant see the reason why he would conduct his bussiness elsewhere. Repeating what I said earlier you wil then be sent to hell. And no I dont think this man was Jesus because you once again did not clearly read what i wrote.

I said he was judging himself for not seeking God which means not becomming a christian and knowing God here on earth is whats required for entry into heaven.   Does that mean that only Christians seek God?  Don't Jewish folk and Muslims also seek God?  How does this process work, exactly?  ""Welcome to Heaven!

DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,thatgui,3,Sun Jul 19 02:31:59 2015 UTC,"So ive noticed in alot of these posts you guys ask loaded questions to the christians and I know its probably just for shits and giggles.    What you see as a loaded question is probably a valid question that is asked precisely because we know (many having been Christians previously) that these are difficult questions that get the person to think in a way that their upbringing might have taught them to avoid.   For instance, I was asking a Christian just the other day about his view of the creation/evolution debate and I asked, if he believes in a god that consciously and intelligently shaped the design and evolution and life on this planet, how it could be that there exists organisms whose entire life cycle revolves around burrowing into the eyes of children, blinding them. He was honest and said that he could make up some BS answer about God punishing people, but he admitted that he hadn't considered this before and he would have to think about it.   Here's another. Suppose your son or daughter is brutally murdered. The killer (for whatever reason) escapes the cops and the justice system. Your neighbour is a really nice guy, and despite everyone knowing that he's completely innocent of this crime, he freely and willingly offers to be punished in the real killer's stead - say, life in prison.  Obviously you and I would both cry foul at this arrangement because it isn't really justice if someone else does the time in prison. The real killer (sunning himself on a beach in a country without extradition laws, or having committed suicide and no longer existing in any meaningful form) isn't locked up and isn't penitent. An innocent person being punished isn't just and it isn't moral.  The question is, then: how is what Jesus did, moral and just?   Why not ask for christian views on topics and then state yours so we all get something to think about rather than just trying to prove your right and im wrong   Well, let me ask you this: do you believe that non-believers, people who do not accept Jesus as their saviour, will end up somewhere other than heaven when they die? If so, why aren't you trying very hard to convince people that they should accept Jesus? If I sincerely believed that you were going to be hit by a bus tomorrow, I would do all I could to convince you to avoid it.  The reason I spend time and energy discussing this stuff with Christians and people of other beliefs is that I believe many of these people have formed false beliefs that are in many cases harmful to themselves, their families, and society in general. You might disagree and this would be a good debate topic: whether belief in Christianity is healthy and rational. I debate people because I believe it's not, and because I know that talking about faith in a respectful way is a way to get people to think about their faith in a critical manner."

You saying you are spiritual is like me saying I'm a 6th dimensional being.  You would have no idea what that even is.   Maybe we can start by you telling me if you are an ex christian and what changed your mind?    I am.  Reason and evidence changed my mind.  I made the ""mistake"" of trying to prove my religious claims.  I wanted to defend my faith.  I learned about skepticism and realized it is actually a great method.  I then realized that faith is not a virtue, and the faith of religion and the faith of knowing a good friend will be on your side, is not the same thing.  After that I felt free to examine my own beliefs and religion.  After that I became a deist, then a pantheist, then an agnostic atheist so to speak.    I have nothing but great memories of church.  Nobody wronged me, they were all fantastic.  It's a shame that most of them want nothing to do with me now because religion has made them think we are on opposing teams.  You don't realize it yet, but you're really not anywhere near the same as your fellow Christians.  You investigate.    Question now is, do you care more about the truth or more about what you do or don't want to be true?  In my life I desire truth above all.  I strive to have as many true beliefs as possible and as few false beliefs as possible.  Truth has no fear of honest investigation.  It doesn't care if you do or don't believe it, as it will always be discovered.  Think about religion it requires you to ignore the absence of evidence that you expect, and demands that you ignore the presence of conflicting evidence(often by saying you don't understand it, but there's probably a good reason because it's true).  How do you detect lies?  By an absence of evidence and or conflicting evidence.  Religion is set up to enable deceit.  Why would any deity actually do that?"

DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,Jesusisalilbitch,5,Fri Jul 17 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"I would love if you could explain what ""spiritual"" means in that context too, and how it differs from other experiences."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,JoJoRumbles,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:58:03 2015 UTC,"You want physical proof to a qouestion that has a spiritual answer? Maybe we can start by you telling me if you are an ex christian and what changed your mind? Or have never been in any religion?   I never said the evidence had to be physical, but it would help.  It should be, however, unambiguous, demonstrable and repeatable.    As for me, I've never been a believer.  I don't find 'faith' to be a logical path to truth."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,W00ster,1 point,Fri Jul 17 06:39:01 2015 UTC,"I lost faith when a friend asked me what religion I was.  I said Catholic.  Then he asked if I actually believed Jesus was the son of God.  I couldn't come up with a reason why I would believe that, so it got me thinking.  Ultimately, I decided a just God wouldn't condemn you just for not worshipping him, and thus I should just live according to my personal ethical beliefs.  If god isn't real, then fine.  If God turns out to be real, and us just, I'd be alright.  If God turns out to be real, but is so vain he sends you to hell because you didn't follow seemingly arbitrary religious commands, well then he's not worth worshipping."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,W00ster,2,Fri Jul 17 05:01:01 2015 UTC,"I debate religion here for a couple of reasons. I like to challenge myself and my beliefs, to make sure that they don't need updating. I want to practice communicating clearly. And, I think the world would be better without religion, and I want to improve the world, even if it just one forum post at a time.  When I'm debating a religious person, I will ask them about what they believe. In general, though, I have a reasonably good understanding of christianity because I used to be Christian."
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,W00ster,2,Thu Jul 16 10:47:53 2015 UTC,OK. What empirical evidence do you have that the god described by Christianity exists?
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,dudleydidwrong,2,Thu Jul 16 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"Can you give examples of these loaded questions? While I'm sure it does happen, you should confuse a Socratic method of debate with loaded questions.    Why not ask for christian views on topics and then state yours   For the most part, we know the Christian views on stuff. Unless it's a really unique view, we know what a Christian is going to say. We can skip several steps if we stop pretending each argument that is presented here is brand new."

I was raised in the Church and was a Christian for over 40 years. I've heard everything you have to say. It is illogical. The Bible is illogical. Your apologia are illogical.
DebateAnAtheist,3dhlcu,miminothing,2,Thu Jul 16 19:24:33 2015 UTC,"With 165 comments, it's very likely that whatever I'm about to say has already been said, but this is the sort of thing I visit these forums to encounter, so I'll say my piece and accept it will probably sit unread.  I do not ask ""loaded"" questions, and do not do it for ""shits and giggles"", and I don't believe that most atheists posting on these forums do either. I ask questions because I care deeply about the answers, and I don't think Christians have good ones. Why would you be dismissive about trying to prove that someone's wrong? If you can prove or even just demonstrate to a reasonable degree that someone's beliefs are ill-founded, that is a worthy thing to discuss.   The common questions that get asked are only loaded in the sense that they are loaded with the burden of poorly thought-out standard religious answers, loaded with centuries of nonsensical dogma. They are not loaded in the sense that they don't deserve rigorous answers.  I'm happy to ask for Christian views, but there is no single Christian view. Ask a ""loaded"" question, and the answers will invariably be all over the map. Why do you accept the gospel of John as authoritative? Do you believe Isaiah contains authentic prophecy? What is the most direct path to salvation, and does Jesus verify this perspective? Was Matthew a reliable author? Should Paul be considered an apostle? Were his views on women correct?  It's ironic that your post is itself incredibly loaded with assumptions about what we do and why we do it, as you yourself accuse us of loaded questions and frivolous motives. But if you really want to have a discussion I would love to engage you on any of the questions I asked above."

The loaded question part was definatly the wrong term used by myself and a mistake as this is not my first language and even though im well read sometimes these will slip in. Although I was mostly reffering to the troll posts the I correct term should have been using should not have been so general and insulting towards alot of atheists since starting to read your posts and faqs on atheism ive gained a much clearer view on the subject and my original goal. Im not here to judge your way of thinking in any way and have realized this is due to reading alot of posts where christians are atacking your way of thinking and condeming you for it. The reason ive left my original post as it is, is ive got to meet people like you who really want to discuss their views and broaden my understanding of atheism not judging the other ones views or beliefs. I would love discussions with you as well."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,iuseoxyclean,12,Thu Jul 16 06:08:43 2015 UTC,"I don't understand, anyone who recognized the problems with religion that you attribute to a 'skeptical atheist' would probably be find religion distasteful.   its as if you could recognize how horrible something is, but not be disgusted by it.   I think this is a distinction without a difference."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,indurateape,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:14:06 2015 UTC,"I guess. I mean atheism is atheism in the end anyway.  My point is typically the specific aspects of religion that I notice that people tend to side upon. I typically see people either debating religion scientifically or politically, which is where my analysis came from."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,Wraitholme,7,Thu Jul 16 06:18:29 2015 UTC,"I think these tend to be reactions to theist offerings. If the theist offers a moral argument for a deity, the atheist responds by pointing out the moral failings in the argument. If the theist offers an argument that conflicts with scientific understanding (or at least is not supported by scientific methodology), then the atheist responds accordingly.  If there's an emergent 'type', I think it's more defined by the atheists experience and interest in one approach or the other, rather than an inherent division in the community. I'd offer that an 'experienced' atheist has familiarity with an an appreciation for both concepts.  It's an interesting question to ponder. Thanks for bringing it up :)"
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,dale_glass,3,Thu Jul 16 07:57:10 2015 UTC,"Well that was my point. I think i put it in the edit. I feel that an emerging atheist usually begins as one of the two. Then through forums like this, where atheists can actually form communities, we can allow an open sharing of ideas.   So I feel that over time everyone here becomes a mix of the two, but usually start as just one."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,Vitztlampaehecatl,5,Thu Jul 16 08:01:58 2015 UTC,"I would be very surprised to see somebody of the first view not agreeing with the second, unless they lacked any comprehensive knowledge of religion.  Religion has loads and loads of apologetics trying to sweep a large amount of things under the carpet. If you don't buy that God exists and all this stuff is actually good because you're just supposed to have faith it is, there's a long list of stuff that stops having anything resembling a justification."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,vargonian,3,Thu Jul 16 07:42:56 2015 UTC,"There are 3+ ways to be an atheist:  First off, some other commenters have mentioned Default Atheism. This is the position you are in if you have never been convinced by, or even heard of, religion. It's the basic state of mind for everyone until they accept a religion's claims.  Second, is Skeptical Atheism. This is the position you are in if you have heard a religion's claims, but don't believe them. Your description fits pretty well.  Next, Apatheism. Doesn't care if a god exists or not, and doesn't change anything in their life based on it.   All of these fit under Agnostic Atheism, which basically means anyone who doesn't think it's possible to prove if a god exists, and therefore don't believe.  I'll add the Gnostic Atheist categories later, but I gtg."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,Santa_on_a_stick,2,Thu Jul 16 23:14:49 2015 UTC,"Yeah I deliberately ignored agnosticism but default atheism in fact never actually occurred to me because I've never seen a truly atheist community before, and I figure most people do in fact have some sort of religious influence growing up, if not from their own families."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,Luftwaffle88,2,Thu Jul 16 23:44:26 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't even casually categorize them this way, because, as you said, these really aren't mutually exclusive at all.  I'm more inclined to answer the question: ""Why are you an atheist?"" which touches on a lot of what you've observed.  I don't agree with atheists who come to atheism because of a dislike and/or moral objection with religion.  If the truth were that a horribly brutal and cruel God existed, then so be it; our opinions about a god's character in no way affect the likelihood of that god existing.  I'm an atheist because there's no evidence for a deity.  I also think that many religious practices are backwards, morally repugnant, and harmful to society.  But one doesn't influence the other (for me).  I think the line can be drawn between people like myself and those for which the moral question influences the ""existence"" question."
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,Xenolan,1 point,Thu Jul 16 06:52:33 2015 UTC,Well for me personally I first came upon atheism for that exact reason; I was disgusted with it. THEN once I went to high school and studied science and I realized that religion never made sense to begin with.
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,Sablemint,2,Thu Jul 16 06:58:42 2015 UTC,"I think that atheist belief can fall under two (very broad) groups: skeptical atheists and cynical atheists.   Can I be both?  Further, what about a third category: apathetic atheist? People who just don't care enough to do anything?  Or ""atheism ad ignorance"", atheists who are simply because they haven't been informed about god claims?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,kilkil,1 point,Thu Jul 16 13:31:20 2015 UTC,I started off as skeptical and the more and more I read the bible I was appalled at that smut and how people hold on to it as their moral guide which led to my cynicism.
DebateAnAtheist,3dh5vn,thestupidisstrong,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:35:53 2015 UTC,"As with all things, most people who identify as atheists would be a mixture of the above; few would identify wholly with one side or the other, but I think there is a tendency to lean both ways.  For myself, I am more of the Skeptical Atheist in ""real life"", while my cynical side shows through online - at least in part because that makes for more interesting discussion.  I would suggest that a third category exists, because I was one once:  The ""Default Atheist"".  This refers to someone who is an atheist because no other option has occurred to them.  When I was a child, I knew that people went to church and prayed and such, but I honestly thought it was all just ritual; it didn't occur to me for a long time that they actually believed all the stories and that there was a God and everything.  I was an atheist, but I wasn't really conscious of it in the same way I didn't consciously think about the fact that we were all breathing air.  It never crossed my mind that there was something else to be, until I was about seven years old.  I think that what happened was that I asked a very reasonable question about the Bible, and was angrily told that what I was suggesting was ""sacreligious"".  I don't even recall what the question was; I just remember the dawning realization that this was something people really took seriously, even grown-ups who should have known better.  It was quite a shock, let me tell you!  I find now that this is quite the minority for atheists, especially for the over-40 crowd like me, because most people are raised with at least some church background.  But I remained a ""default atheist"" right up until a little after high school.  I never looked skeptically or critically at religion because I hardly looked at it at all.  To a certain extent, I would still consider myself a Default Atheist, in that I still find it very puzzling that I'm the exception.  I've never really grasped how it is that intelligent, reasonable people can subscribe to such nonsense as religion requires.  And the feeling of overwhelming astonishment from the moment I discovered that people actually believe in God has never completely gone away."

I didn't even know religions were 'real' until i was about 10 years old. I assumed churches and stuff were our versions of the way we handle old greek and egyptian gods: part of our cultural heritage but no longer taken seriously.  Im an atheist because whatever it is if you mean when you talk about religion or spirituality or anything like that, its not there for me. Ive never experienced anything to suggest they are even valid concepts.  Its not that I choose to not believe, its not even that I look and see nothing.

It is always limited.  1.0 to 2.0 = ""Infinity - X"" (read: Infinity minus X)  0.0 to Infinity = Infinity  The former has an infinite amount of permutable segments, however, it is LIMITED by X (i.e., in the alternative case presented, anything over 2.0). Only the latter is true infinity, as it is NOT limited by X. Anything else can only be referred to as Infinity Minus X.  The former may be infinitely divided into substates, but only the latter contains all numerical permutations.   To summarize: Infinity minus X has the same number of permutations as Infinity, but it is always LESS. ;)"
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,af505,2,Sat Jul 18 07:17:42 2015 UTC,"This is factually incorrect.   The cardinality of real numbers between 1 and 2 is the same cardinality of the real numbers.

As I posted before, look up Cantor and the ""cardinality of the continuum.""  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_of_the_continuum  There are different sizes of infinities. Some infinities are bigger than others.  We determine and order their various sizes based on groups called their ""cardinality.""

Because my friend can cut his grain of sand into pieces infinitely, neither of us can ever win; for every grain I return daily, he will be able to return an infinitely smaller and smaller slice of his aingle grain.  Cardinality: I have more grains of sand. Count them and I win.  Also, you said:   The set of real numbers between 1 and 2 has the same cardinality of all the reals.   It does not include the ""grains of sand"" outside the parameter, therefore it is LESS represented as ""Infinity minus X"" and yes, there is certainly a mathematic symbol to represent this."

If you say they do not have the same cardinality, you are wrong.  You can make whatever examples or thought experiments you'd like, but this is a settled mathematical fact.  The cardinality of any real (or complex, for that matter) continuum is two to the aleph null. They are mathematically equal."

Just because something has infinite possibilities, does not mean it contains all possibilities. Removal of one situation from an infinite set is still infinite.

DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,fromkentucky,2,Fri Jul 17 15:21:44 2015 UTC,The problem is that the quote is a simplification of something with a more nuanced understanding. You have to first understand the concept that an infinite set does not mean it contains all things. Such as /u/VonAether posted.
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,Shiredragon,2,Mon Jul 20 00:11:34 2015 UTC,"In a more practical sense, all infinite possibilities in this universe are limited to the mechanisms that govern this universe. For example, if you change the speed of light, then a new set of possibilities arrises. Or, if you change the amount of poer in the wrong or weak forces you could accidentally create a universe where there could be no element heavier than oxygen. In one of these universes it is theoretically possible for life to exist, but it would not be carbon based as we need heavier elements to survive. That life would have its own set of infinite set of possibilities."

For instance, in no multiverse will there be a married bachelor.  In the context you're using it, God is simply a conceptual possibility, not an actual possibility.  Another example.  In our universe four hundred years ago, it was conceptually possible for the speed of light to be significantly more than it was.  However, that was not an actual possibility in our universe.  You need to demonstrate that God is an actual possibility, not just a conceptual possibility."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,WastedP0tential,2,Fri Jul 17 02:29:54 2015 UTC,"There is a lamentable tradition in philosophy, particularly philosophy of theism, that likes to equate or equivocate conceivability with possibility. If they can conceive of something, it is possibly true or exists possibly, they say. But this is just not so. For example, I can easily conceive of traveling back in time and killing my grandfather. But it's actually impossible to do so. Other paradoxes provide plenty more examples."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,LowPiasa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 08:31:38 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with this, however I keep coming to the conclusion there aren't any actual possibilities, because everything works within physical laws, in other words- determinism. My pencil just fell off the table because a gust of air blew it. Before this happened, it was only a conceptual possibility because I didn't have all the possible variables accounted for. Had I known now before the pencil fell of the table, I would know it isn't even an actual possibility. There was literally no way the pencil was going to remain on the table w/o some nonphysical intervention screwing with physics.   edit So I think I'm thinking about this the wrong way. Possibility seems to mean something we don't yet know, yet isn't logically impossible. At this point I'm just kind of thinking out loud, feel free to mock me.   edit 2 Okay, so back again to the pencil, the only way the pencil wouldn't have fallen is if the laws of physics were broken, that is, the logically impossible happened. So it wasn't even a conceptual possibility for the pencil not to fall."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,HebrewHammerTN,3,Fri Jul 17 14:39:43 2015 UTC,"Think of a six sided die, the regular kind with 1 through 6.  It is an actual possibility to roll a 1 through 6 each time.  I can however conceive of a die that has 8 sides with 8 numbers.  If there is not actually a die like that though, I can never actually roll an 8.  To assign actual possibility we need to know the die we are dealing with.  Actual possibilities are based on things we can observe or figure out via induction.  It doesn't mean that it will happen, but is capable of happening within the laws we know.  The pencil can conceivably turn into a cat...but that doesn't seem to be an actual possibility."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,LowPiasa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:09:58 2015 UTC,"They way I see it, conceptual possibility is a priori, actual possibility is a posteriori. The problem is, any time we say it is actually possible, we are only saying we lack all variables to account what will happen. As information increases, the ""actual"" possibilities decrease.   Example: If you only told me you are rolling a die, and I guessed you would roll a 26, to me, that is a actual possibility. However you have more information, and know it is only a 6 sided die, so 26 wasn't an actual possibility, only a conceivable possibility.   I guess I started thinking about this the wrong way, as if the way we used the word possibility wasn't knowledge dependent. I can't account for all the variables within a known parameter, so for now there is set of possibilities dependent on the current knowledge I have."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,HebrewHammerTN,1 point,Fri Jul 17 15:38:34 2015 UTC,"The die example you gave is the problem.  If my die had only 6 sides, was 26 ever really an actual possibility?  Actual possibilities don't have to do with anything besides reality.  They are completely independent of us outside of choices we are making that are actually possible.  Conceptual possibilities are not a prior knowledge, because they are concepts not knowledge.   The problem is, any time we say it is actually possible, we are only saying we lack all variables to account what will happen.   To a degree, but we can still limit possibilities.  For example you could never role a 26 on a regular six sided die.  26 is not an actual possibility.  Actual possibilities are the unknown outcomes of known situations that are allowable by what we know with given information.  Think of it as picking from an either finite set or infinite set.  On a six sided die there are only six choices.  On an unknown die there are an infinite number of choices.  Do you see the difference?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,LowPiasa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 16:39:06 2015 UTC,"I do. Let me ask, if we had a supercomputer that could predict with 100% accuracy what number the die would roll, are there any actual possibilities? Would I be justified saying there are 6 possibilities at the same time (unknown to me) the machine saying 5 is the only outcome?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,HebrewHammerTN,2,Fri Jul 17 17:01:52 2015 UTC,"There would be no actual possibilities in that situation as it would be deterministic.  You would be justified because you don't have the information the computer has.  You wouldn't be if you said the roll was going to be 7.  Think of it another way.  There is a dark room, three guys, and one gun.  Lights go out, lights go back on in an hour and one guy is dead from a bullet wound.  It is conceivably possible that an alien beamed in took the gun and shot one of the guys, but we don't know if that is actually possible.  It is actually possible that one of the other two guys killed the other, or that it was a suicide since none of them were handcuffed and all had access to the gun.  Actual possibilities can be assigned when we have data and can limit possibilities.  Conceptual possibilities are when we don't have data and have an infinite set of possibilities.  A conceptual possibility is a hypothesis that needs to be tested.  An actual possibility results from data so that we can actually assign probability, even in a limited way."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,LowPiasa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:10:47 2015 UTC,"Seems pretty clear now, thanks hammer."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,HebrewHammerTN,2,Fri Jul 17 17:16:31 2015 UTC,"No worries.  It is a VERY confusing point.  There is a video Matt dillahunty does, called ""What are the odds?"".  It is a very good explanation.  Basically if you can't set the denominator, it is conceptually possible only at that time.  When you can set the denominator you can go into the realm of actual possibility.  This equivocation allows the ontological argument to sound convincing.  But conceiving of a God does not mean it is actually possible.  Just like in the murder analogy, you must first establish if something is actually possible.  And again, just because I say something is only conceivably possible with the information at hand, doesn't mean that given more information it was not be actually possible.  It's essentially a scale, from hypothesis, to testing, to fact.  Like the die, 26 is conceivably possible, 1-6 are actually possible, 5 will be rolled based on certain conditions(in a deterministic universe, if that is actually possible, but it is only conceivably possible right now though I think for macro events it is likely, but that is conjecture)."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,LowPiasa,1 point,Fri Jul 17 17:28:46 2015 UTC,"But conceiving of a God does not mean it is actually possible.    Yeah, the ontological argument fails miserably. I can conceive of mutually exclusive realities. The fact I can do this seems to mean conceivability doesn't necessarily imply actually possibility."

DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,Captaincastle,8,Sat Jul 18 12:52:00 2015 UTC,"I mean, it kind of depends on how the multiverse works. If it's like dc comics, they all originate at the big bang and diverge with each new possibility from there.   Of course there is a God in DC so it might be a bad example."

When physics describes the multiverse as having ""infinite possibilities"" we're speaking about some very specific things, depending on the idea. Either we're talking about infinite possibilities of the values for the various fundamental constants, or all different quantum states have evolved, and given the number of particles the number of universes becomes infinite.  But in no physics theory of the multiverse is a supernatural cause existent."

Most of these theories are still based around constants that define the universe we live in, usually either tweaked to different parameters or exactly the same, but just with choices being made differently (Hitler chose to remain at the patent office, etc). But natural laws still apply.  Deities are now and forever, by definition, outside nature.  But it doesn't matter to begin with, as far as grasping at straws goes, this is way up there.  This is just an extension of WLC's tactics, trying to allude there is a tiny possibility there might be something remotely similar to or worth referencing as some kind of deity, SO THEREBEFORE THE CHRISTIAN GOD I BELIEVE IN WITH THE BIBLE I BELIEVE IN IS THE ONE TRUE GOD AND BLA BLA FUCKING BLA.

DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,skinbearxett,2,Fri Jul 17 06:00:59 2015 UTC,"A universe may have anything possible in it, and therefore an infinite number of universes must have all possible things in all possible combinations.   The distinction here is possible, is a god possible? Is the supernatural possible? You could have every possible universe without having a single square circle, and if a God is like a square circle in that it is impossible then no universe would include it."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,anomalousBits,3,Fri Jul 17 12:04:22 2015 UTC,"AFAIK, the multiverse is just one (unfalsifiable and unsatisfying) way of countering the fine tuning argument. So no designer would be required for any of the universes.   I don't find the fine tuning argument particularly compelling. It's really an argument from ignorance given that we can only really effectively model the universe we live in, and everything else is making a lot of simplified assumptions about subjects we know to be incredibly complex. We don't have complete understanding of physics to be able to say that this constant or that could actually be different. We also have some understanding of our own abiogenesis, but we can't extend that to other universes with unknown physical properties. We can't even extend that to other parts of our own universe! We don't know what other forms of life are possible or probable."

If you had an infinite collection of universes, and if this infinite collection contained all conceivable universes, then it would include universes that actually had God in them.   The ""all conceivable universes"" but is important. You could have the set ""all universes without the colour green"", and it would still be an infinite set. If you're already defining it to contain all possibilities, then yes, God is one of those.   But it's important to remember that we don't know if this is how it is. We don't know if all conceivable universes exist. We simply do not know. As far as I can see, there's no actual way of even testing this in the distant future.   But, hypothetically, given a set of universes defined as containing all conceivable universes, this set would include universes with God in them. It would also include universes without God in them."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,bluepepper,6,Fri Jul 17 04:11:33 2015 UTC,"and if this infinite collection contained all conceivable universes   That's why people are saying no.

DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,kilkil,1 point,Fri Jul 17 07:14:11 2015 UTC,"Well, because you can't think of anything else.   I mean, if we're sticking to the hypothetical, any thought is limited to what you can conceive. Right?"
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,CardboardPotato,2,Fri Jul 17 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not overly familiar with the specific physics definition of the multiverse theory, but from a quick glance it appears that the multiverse excludes ""all conceivable universes"".  In other words, the universes that can exist in the multiverse still have to follow some sort of structure.  So while you and I could conceive of a universe where all solid matter is made of cheese, such a universe would not be physically possible.  However, certain interpretations do allow for varying physical constants from our current observable universe.  This may give more variability to the potential universes contained in the multiverse.  My initial reaction was also ""yes"" because I was thinking of ""all conceivable universes"" as well.  I do see why many people are answering no."
DebateAnAtheist,3dkt4k,DrDiarrhea,1 point,Fri Jul 17 05:09:41 2015 UTC,"It's not all conceivable universes, it's all possible ones. You cannot think something into existence. That's called ""reification"". The current ideas suggest that all the universes in the multiverse obey basically the same rules, but have slightly different paramaters..so in one anti-particles outnumber particles, in another, the quantum vacuum state is lower, in another, matter couldn't form due to a gravitational variation in it's big bang and remains plasma etc etc  So like a deck of cards, you can have a huge combination of hands dealt, but you will never have one with 20 Kings and 9 two of clubs.   If it were all conceivable universes the paradoxes would be amazing. You can imagine one with a god that can control all the other universes, and one that creates a condition where no gods could exist, and one that blows up and consumes all the others while there is one that prevents this from happening etc etc."

What's important to realize is that OP posed a hypothetical question — as in, ""if __ was true, would __ be true?""  If we were to consider a hypothetical collection of all conceivable universes (literaly defined as consisting of all the universes we can consider), and if at least one universe we can conceive of is a universe with God in it, then a hypothetical collection of universes such as the one we are considering now would contain at least one universe with God in it.   This is what I meant. This has no necessary relation to reality. This is a hypothetical answer, to a hypothetical question.   I... I think I used italics too much."

Basically, it has not yet been proven that god must necessarily exist.  That is, we do not know if it is necessary for god to exist ever.  Because of that, we cannot make assumptions about probability.  Sure, god may exist in one of the many infinite universes, but we have no assurance of that.   Additionally, there are some god models that necessarily must not exist.  Examples that are thought of like this is the 3-Omni's God, such as the Abrahamic god.  The kind of abilities granted to this kind of god can create odd paradoxes and contradictions which make them impossible to exist.

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,WorldsWorstMan,6,Wed Jul 15 19:26:14 2015 UTC,Why not both?  I kind of don't draw a distinction there actually. Whether someone is actually an asshole or pretending to be one is the same end result. And the person pretending actually is an asshole for doing it anyway.

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Captaincastle,10,Wed Jul 15 20:37:04 2015 UTC,"Bro, we're not having this discussion again. Every time someone tries to debate with you, you are blatantly disruptive, and ignore their post in favor of your rhetoric.

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,TruthMatterz2,-7,Wed Jul 15 20:40:05 2015 UTC,CAPTAIN COWARD you are a spineless backstabbing weasel. You should be ashamed of yourself. What a lilly-livered chump you turned out to be.      Caving into a bunch of beaten atheist sore losers.      I'm seriously not a troll.    I just like have some fun mixing it up with the atheist brethren : )    You guys know  I make very serious arguments and defend them.    I just like to poke some fun to get people engaged.

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,cabbagery,3,Thu Jul 16 04:08:14 2015 UTC,"That's quite the allegation. It would be one thing for a mere user to do something like this, but it's something else for a mod.  Insofar as your evidence is scant, it turns out we can probably look to disconfirm this hypothesis with relative ease. Mods? Can you identify users' IP addresses and determine if this allegation has merit? I expect that's something only an admin could do, but perhaps the mods could speak to this allegation anyway?"
DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Captaincastle,3,Wed Jul 15 19:21:11 2015 UTC,I don't think we can do that.  I mean we can try and compare post times or something i guess
DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,cabbagery,2,Wed Jul 15 19:26:58 2015 UTC,"No worries. It seems a somewhat specious allegation as it stands, but not particularly difficult to disconfirm, given the appropriate tools/access. I'm not really concerned."
DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Captaincastle,3,Wed Jul 15 19:40:23 2015 UTC,"It looks like I am wrong, according to /u/Captaincastle. I edited the original post to reflect this. Sorry for the confusion."

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Captaincastle,2,Wed Jul 15 19:51:30 2015 UTC,"Hey, it's me.  I realize I'm coming to this a bit late, but I figured I'd still chime in since I'm apparently the catalyst here.  First, I really appreciate the discussion and the open way in which this sub is run, and I REALLY love the way the community interacts overall.    A couple thoughts:  I believe/believed that TruthMatterz2 is/was a puppet used by NietzscheJr (never Captaincastle).   Those that have had the privilege of interacting with NietzscheJr will recognize both the style of conversation, and the absurd bent he takes.  That observation aside, my actual reason for this belief is based on my interactions between the puppet account, and NietzscheJr, and PMs I received, all of which took place when I started flagging TruthMatterz2's posts.    I'll also point out that when I confronted NietzscheJr about this, he did not deny the claim.  Anecdotally, I also find it interesting that the account, formally dedicated 100% to this sub, has just now started to branch out into trolling other forums.   However, I understand the irony of claiming ""personal experience"" and do not expect others to accept my claim.  In the end, I suppose it's irrelevant because the truth cannot be known unless the parties involved actually admitted to doing so.    To make matter worse, even if NietzscheJr admitted publicly to having a puppet, it would be right to be skeptical, as falsely admitting to doing so is exactly the type of thing NietzscheJr would find entertaining.    It's even more irrelevant as long as the puppet account was not getting special treatment.   Were that the case, I fully and completely believe that /u/Captaincastle would have all over that shit, mainly because he's such a bad ass.   Once the dust settles, I'm sure our friend will be back under a new identity, and the fun can continue.    Meanwhile, I'm happy this sparked a conversation around trolls, and I have to say I really loved what /u/Captaincastle had to say about that:   ... the trolls usually bring about genuinely good content from the posters of the sub. Think of trolls as like vaccines. Dead versions of theist arguments."

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Captaincastle,6,Wed Jul 15 19:18:41 2015 UTC,"I'd have thought trolls were the most obviously banworthy. I know there aren't any listed rules here, but it is a sub for debate and discussion, right? A poster who repeatedly demonstrates they have no interest in either, and is only here to incite and insult, brings nothing worthwhile to the table. It's a waste of everyone's time."
DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Frisnfruitig,3,Wed Jul 15 19:37:58 2015 UTC,"Here's the problem with that, as tactfully as possible.  It is the policy of the sub, set forth by the creator long before i came on board, to be as hesitant as possible with banning. Unless someone is being overtly disruptive or spamming or what have you, we let the user base decide their fate, typically via downvote and debate, with a hefty dose of ""fuck that guy"".  So like i said, if it's what you guys want, I'll do it. I just haven't gotten any formal complaints."

You should be ashamed of yourself.   Fact is, I am carrying on massive conversations with many atheists and absolutely do engage them in a very substantive manner.    This is what has you atheists so upset.    I am engaging everything you throw at me and knocking it down your throats.   That's exactly why you seek to ban me.     This gossiping behind my back with false claims that I refuse discussions is absolute bull - and you all know it.     Why don't you be honest and engage me like the many others?   Why be a bunch of ninny nannies hoping to coerce the mods to shut me down by intimidation and false allegations that they are me?"

I understand you detest me for exposing the ridiculousness of atheism, but you are simply not being truthful to claim I don't bring substance to the conversations.   Your problem is that I am hitting you guys like a freight train on substance and you have no answers.   ATHEIST Cowards are on a witch hunt.  You can't beat me, so ban me.    Not one of you weasels can demonstrate anything I am wrong about.  What a bunch of pathetic turds.  That lying atheist idiot DudeAbides below got his ass handed to him misquoting OED and using 'disbelieve' as a noun in a weasel maneuver.

DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,Elihu-gnu,5,Thu Jul 16 02:02:14 2015 UTC,Thanks for proving my point.
DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,TheDudeAbides491,-2,Thu Jul 16 02:22:22 2015 UTC,I think what TruthMatterz2 is waiting for is a POINT called REBUTTAL of his arguments to be made. Pick up the burden of Refutation and show him wrong.  Should be really simple. Can you not challenge him with a real deductively supported premise and conclusion? Or is poisoning the well or Ad hom the way to go about it now.  Really Mod or Troll?  Not quite the standards of the Elite I have come to expect. Kind of weak sauce don't you think? You want the Mods to fight your battles for you? Shame.  Debate an Atheist is a popularity contest echo chamber now?  Free thinkers? Thought for themselves?  I remember when Atheists here used to analyze argument and respond with logic and reason.  Not get all Emo and needy.  Perhaps continuous complaints of I don't like it will win the day.  I was always told Atheists had the superior intellect and logical prowess over Theists and could out think them with even before breakfast.  So all in all just what point have you proven Dude?  Good things to you and yours.

He was claiming my definition of atheism was incorrect and not supported by a peer reviewed dictionary. I used the OED's definitions of the words ""atheism"" and ""disbelief"" to show that my definition did comport with the OED. He dismisses my argument and claims sophistry and manipulation:  https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateAnAtheist/comments/3d88d7/what_is_an_atheist/ct353jk  He's a troll. He knows he's a troll.

It's the writings of a troll, which I have complied and make my case for here(edit by me link not copied)   Its looks more like Witch hunting. Specifically calling out an individual who does not conform to the herd mentality, calling for sanctions for the same. Making a agenda based on one posters action and calling for a community to take action on same. We will manufacture the crime if we have too. Mod supported troll. Yeah that's the ticket. The Statist totalitarian types really go  for that sort of thing don't you agree?  Your not a social justice warrior (SJW) are you?  Seems to me he (Truth) has engaged ""people"" I see plenty of posts made. I have been following him. He may be selective to whom he will respond to. Its just a guess but I suppose you could ask him if it was the case. I like giving benefit of the doubt. Not all posts are respond worthy are they not? This is Reddit after all. Opinions and backsides we all have em and they all don't smell like lilacs and gooseberries.   If your complaint is that Truth is too provacative or the language too bold you must not have been around the Atheist debate community long. Insults, complaints, obscenities and boorish but gratuitous affirmations are par for the course. Both positions employ them. Sometimes like minded individuals sling them at each other. A page from the Atheist play book, ridicule works right? (personally I do not think so, I think them conversation stoppers)  It seems you complain definitions posited are not the ones you like. Note this piece of conversation between ignatos and Truth about this. From a Atheist position.   it also irks me when fellow atheists speak in such a matter-of-fact way, as if the definition of ""atheism"" which we commonly use (i.e. lacking belief) is the ""correct"" one. It is a valid definition, and the one we choose to use, but this doesn't mean that the ""theist/agnostic/atheist"" definition is wrong, per se.   I am not a fan of what is true for you and what is true for me can be different but it is at least a honest statement of position. (My position : Truth is truth and corresponds to reality)   Following the definition of disbelief you posted from OED, I also see the further statement of ""positive unbelief"".  that it is a action, a act something that you do. Not seeing it as something you do not do. No hint of lack of something to be found. I can ask why you do such a thing then? Why are you acting that way? I am sure this provided dictionary definition is not giving you what you think it does.   The definition in full from the OED link you provided on disbelief.   The action or an act of disbelieving; mental rejection of a statement or assertion; positive unbelief.   Some implications to what I think about that definition. I do not dismiss it off hand but consider. Does this not assume a mind? If not how could it be mental? If a mind, does it not assume intellegence? Or perhaps its deterministic? Is it all just chemicals? My chemicals same as your chemicals? Is there something more than chemicals going on? How do chemicals know to take a action? If intellengence is assumed what about logic and reason? Are logic and reason a thing? Is action or acting only possible with those with the ability to do so? Potential and actulization play into this? If not then what exactly is a rejection? If deterministic what about free agency to act for myself? Not a thing?  A heck of a can of worms to deal with and the reasons clear why one would want to run away from it or redefine it. Because it pins you down and makes you explain. Lack becomes shelter, but only like the well used Emperor's new clothes analogy. http://deoxy.org/emperors.htm  Who does it really fool? Perhaps only those who are trying to avoid the the concequences of the reality of it. The Scoundrels said the clothes were invisible to anyone who is too stupid and incompetent to appreciate its quality. Even the King had his doubts at first but he would not be called stupid or incompetent besides thinking himself the smartest guy in the room. The very one who should have known what clothes were, can't say he did not have the material evidence (pun intended) to form a reasonable conclusion. The child who spoke out was not under any such constraints to have to deceive the public or himself to save ego. What did he say?  Lack of belief in the Emporers clothes, or The emperor was naked. See what a mess of redefining clothes got the King into? Even he then knew what he had done and still had to act as if he didn't know. This isn't so far off the mark of what Theists believe the Atheists position is. You have been lied to, bought into the lie, know down deep what is the truth is but cannot act consistent according to the lie. So you have to redefine the lie so you can live with it.   Lack, it only shelters your own ego.   May your search for Truth be fruitful. Peace and abundance for you."
DebateAnAtheist,3der8g,BogMod,3,Thu Jul 16 20:47:27 2015 UTC,"Yikes, Jingoism/meme as a legitimate grounds? Troll-tastic is that a thing?   I never mentioned Jingoism or memes. I'm not sure what you mean. Yes, troll-tastic is a thing (perhaps you don't understand the usage of the fake portmanteau. I get the feeling English is not your first language - is this correct?).   Well it follows that either you or Truth is superior in thinking and logic on definitions or neither of you are. Would that be law of non contradiction or did I just do a false dilemma. Is there more choices?   There certainly are more choices. The nature of definitions themselves could be different from how we are both looking at it.    Its looks more like Witch hunting. Specifically calling out an individual who does not conform to the herd mentality, calling for sanctions for the same.   It's not about how he thinks. You're a theist and I'm having no problem conducting a conversation with you. You're not being a troll.    If your complaint is that Truth is too provacative or the language too bold you must not have been around the Atheist debate community long. Insults, complaints, obscenities and boorish but gratuitous affirmations are par for the course. Both positions employ them. Sometimes like minded individuals sling them at each other. A page from the Atheist play book, ridicule works right?   No. Ridicule is bad in debate. I don't like it. Just because both positions employ it doesn't make it good.  A word can have multiple definitions. That is why there are multiple entries in the dictionary. Atheism doesn't mean exactly one and only one thing, the same way Christianity doesn't mean exactly one and only one thing. There are certain sects of Christians that don't consider other sects Christians. For Truth to act the way he does is beyond obnoxious and does not contribute to a meaningful conversation.   Some implications to what I think about that definition. I do not dismiss it off hand but consider. Does this not assume a mind? If not how could it be mental? If a mind, does it not assume intellegence? Or perhaps its deterministic? Is it all just chemicals? My chemicals same as your chemicals? Is there something more than chemicals going on?

Potential and actulization play into this? If not then what exactly is a rejection? If deterministic what about free agency to act for myself? Not a thing?   You're going far into left field and I'm not sure what you're asking. Again, and I say this with all due deference and respect, but I believe there is a language barrier issue. These words can be loaded with lots of assumptions and if we don't explain exactly what we mean, it can probe difficult.   The Emperor's clothes is quite far off from the Atheist position. I am a scientist and a materialist. Atheism, like all other issues about the existence of something in reality, is the null hypothesis. I don't believe in things for which there is no evidence. I don't believe in unicorns, leprechauns, daemons, angels, ghosts, any of it. My position to not believe a thing exists until evidence is presented for existence.   You can certainly define Atheism as ""I believe no gods exist."" I use the definition ""I do not believe any gods exist."" I however, do believe I have proven that definition compatible with the definitions found in the OED."

I'm not sure what definition of troll we're working with here. Traditionally, it meant someone who didn't believe what they were saying and was just trying to get a reaction. These days, it often seems to refer to someone who disrupts the discussion, regardless of whether they are sincere or not.  Maybe he's the first sort of troll.

Currently not possible, and this paper suggests it's done by again, using physical information from our physical brains, recoding and transmitting it.

When you are young, do you understand the depth of math and science and other subjects of that nature? No, you must learn what it means. Is the same not true for a group of developing people?  We do.  I believe time is a byproduct of existing in the third dimension that can possibly be manipulated. Einstein I think proved that time is an illusion in the sense that it is relative.  No. As a cartoon character from the Boondocks once said(lol): The absence of evidence is not the evidence of absence. Even in such a silly thing, there is truth.

DebateAnAtheist,3de7b7,darkstar47,3,Wed Jul 15 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"How do you explain consciousness?   I...don't, really. It's a colossal metaphysical mystery.  I suspect we will eventually get an answer, or at least a partial answer (more than we have right now), but it'll likely depend on new philosophical paradigms. In any case, I'm not sure what this has to do with atheism. The problem is just as difficult in a theistic context as well.   How do you explain the collective experience of those that meditate deeply and focus internally, the connection they experience?   It's their brains fooling themselves. Brains are pretty good at that. There's nothing supernatural about it.   Secondly, how do you explain thousands of monks meditating on the idea of peace and love for a day reducing violence across the world?   Wikipedia indicates that isn't supported by evidence. Moreover, if anyone could reliably demonstrate such an ability, they could presumably win the Randi Prize- so far, no one has done so.   What about telepathic communication? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/scientists-prove-that-telepathic-communication-is-within-reach-180952868/?no-ist   Your link describes a cybernetic technology used to create a 'telepathy-like' effect using known physics and neuroscience. There's nothing supernatural about it.   How do you feel about multiple dimensions. If we're third dimensional beings, what of life in other dimensions as well?   We don't know for sure that our universe has only three dimensions. Some theories of quantum physics suggest there might be as many as 11, but with most of them being very small, so that we don't notice them.  In any case, it sounds like you're confusing the idea of parallel universes with the dimensionality of space in our universe. They're not really related.   Lastly, why is there something (existence) instead of nothing (non-existence)?   Again, I don't know. But if there were nothing, there wouldn't be anything to keep it nothing, so it wouldn't surprise me for something to appear."

To me consciousness very well could be explained as an output device that takes in input from various sources, access to memory, access to speech centers that gives us inner dialogue, access to memory for input on past experiences, access to motor control.  Of course this is all conjecture.  I think it has to come down to is we have to comfortable to say we don't know how stuff works, and then try to figure it out.  There's no need to attribute supernatural and mythology to explain things.  Though the very mechanics of our consciousness may struggle against doing that and trying to throw explanations that have no right being applied, and really is faulty epistemology."

The linked blog entry about an event in 1978 is hardly proof of anything. So far as I can tell the event wasn't peer-reviewed, there are no details on how the statistics were compiled, it was never repeated (why not?), and there is no evidence that the unverified results were even statistically significant.

I'll first point out that your questions make an important, but unstated assumption. You're assuming that ""atheist"" is the same thing as ""materialist."" This is generally the case, and there is a lot of overlap, but it is by no means a one-to-one correspondence. An atheist just lacks a belief in god. An atheist could very well believe in a soul and not a god.  Its a slightly academic distinction, but it's important. Since your questions are more suited for /debateamaterialist rather than /debateanatheist   How do you explain consciousness?   This is an active area of scientific research. The short answer is we don't have everything worked out, but by studying the human brain and the brains of other animals, we are starting to understand the biological basis for consciousness. Here are some helpful links to understand where we are in the process:  http://www.livescience.com/47096-theories-seek-to-explain-consciousness.html http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3111444/ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness#Biological_function_and_evolution   How do you explain the collective experience of those that meditate deeply and focus internally, the connection they experience?   I'm not sure what you mean. I'll assume that you mean the collective individual experiences of people. As in - all these people feel something similar on an individual level. If I've misunderstood, please correct me.  The simple fact is, we're all human. We all have a desire to feel connected. We're social creatures. We also like and enjoy the feeling of being a part of something bigger than ourselves. That's one of the cravings religion satisfies. I don't doubt that these people all individually feel something, and it means a lot to them, but I doubt it represents anything more in the physical world than their own biochemistry.   how do you explain thousands of monks meditating on the idea of peace and love for a day reducing violence across the world?   The short answer is that the world wide crime rate didn't drop during those times of meditation. This is a claim for which they have not provided any proof. I take this claim as someone saying something with no evidence - I don't believe it.  Even if it were the case, however, they would have yet to prove a causal link between the two phenomena.   How do you feel about multiple dimensions. If we're third dimensional beings, what of life in other dimensions as well?   This is honestly your weakest question (possibly tied with the previous one). I don't accept the grammar of the question. It, in my opinion, demonstrates a lack of understanding of physics and the nature of reality as we know it. You're making several assumptions about the structure and nature of the universe in that question which don't comport with modern physics. What do you mean by ""other dimensions?"" If you're pointing to a specific physical theory involving multiple dimensions, I would argue you misunderstand the theory. If you're just speculating on the concept, you first have to define the kind of universe with ""other dimensions"" that you're talking about.    why is there something (existence) instead of nothing (non-existence)?   This is the oldest, and most important question. Why? We don't know why. It's very possible that it could be impossible for it to be otherwise. We've never observed ""nothing"" or ""non-existence."" Existence is all we know. Its possible we live in a multi-verse where our universe has the conditions and physical laws where matter can form and life can emerge. There are several different ideas about why. See Lawrence Krauss's ""A Universe from Nothing"" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-EilZ4VY5Vs"

If they did, I'm sure if you looked hard enough you could find some things that happened to become worse during the period the monks were meditating.   What about telepathic communication? http://www.smithsonianmag.com/innovation/scientists-prove-that-telepathic-communication-is-within-reach-180952868/?no-ist   I don't see how this challenges atheism, or even materialism. People were able to use physical things to modify brain states. Don't get me wrong, this is pretty fucking cool and is going to be some really important technology in a few years, but I don't see how this fundamentally challenges how we understand the world.   How do you feel about multiple dimensions. If we're third dimensional beings, what of life in other dimensions as well?   To be honest, I don't have any idea, but as I understand it, everything already exists in every dimension, it's just that we comprehend the world in three dimensions. Again, I don't see how this challenges atheism."

However, I find hypotheses like the following quite intuitive:  If you view organisms as survival machines, there is a huge advantage for brains to be able to plan ahead, and ""simulate"" all possible situations in order to create the optimal strategy on what to do next, without having to go only by trial and error. Over time, those simulations would likely start including a more and more refined representation of reality, including a representation of the self that is distinguished from the world around it. This could eventually lead to more and more complex levels of self-awareness. (This is very crudely paraphrased from the Selfish Gene.)   I believe the being that could be perceived as ""God"" not as a bearded man in the sky or multiple deities or what have you but existence itself. I do not believe that human language can accurately label such a thought.   There is a label for such belief. It's called pantheism.   Lastly, why is there something (existence) instead of nothing (non-existence)?   We don't even know whether nothing is possible, or whether there once was a state of nothingness. It could be that something always existed, and that the big bang was just the beginning of our current state of that something, and not the change from nothing to something."

DebateAnAtheist,3de7b7,DrDiarrhea,1 point,Thu Jul 16 04:06:50 2015 UTC,"I didn't say anything in that post which the book didn't say. Here's a short synopsis of what I wrote earlier since ""go read this book!"" is not conducive to conversation.  The brain runs on abstractions. These abstractions can be represented as analogies, or ""symbols"". Symbols are made up sensory input and other symbols (which are comprised of other symbols and sensory input, etc). Symbol for ""dog"" has associations with symbols ""fur"", ""happy"", ""tail"", ""companion"", etc. Symbol for ""cat"" shares a lot of these symbols but has its own as well (which are probably shared with other things too). It's a giant web of symbols in our brain.  You can have symbols for specific things, not categories as well. Jane, my imaginary wife, has symbols for ""caring"", ""red"", ""smile"", etc, in my mind, and probably symbols I can't even describe with words (these words are just representations of the symbols, the actual symbol is experienced through thoughts and impressions and feelings and only manifest as words sometimes).  The sense of ""I"" is a result of this symbology being applied to the symbol-maker. The brain constantly updates its idea about what itself is, and more importantly, what it will do as part of its environment simulation. It does this for others too -- my imaginary wife has a set of symbols in my mind for her behavior, desires, looks, dislikes, etc -- but those symbols are imperfect because I can only see her effects on the world, not the innards of her mind. The symbol we have for ourselves is the most accurate symbol-of-another we have because it has direct access so the behavior, desires, etc of itself and we label that symbol as ""me"".   Hofstadter also delves into the idea of incorporating others into your own idea of self. I think a big part of meditation and Buddhism is incorporating all of reality into your idea of self. Here's a ted talk that touches on that idea: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0--_R6xThs"

This is a remarkably ignorant way of putting it.  Note; EVEN IF the universe were a young universe, the winding problem would still exist, and still need to be explained.  It does not rest on the age of the universe, it rests on the fact that the way that galactic arms work was counter to our understanding of gravity.  And the density wave hypothesis explained and accounted for all the observed data. It wasn't just conveniently made up to ""make this seem reasonable."""

The age of the universe has nothing to do with explaining density waves in galaxies.   Becaus the way we understand gravity, this cant look like this for billions of years.   It can't look like that for any period of time. Under the original model of how galaxy arms worked, the arms were unstable, whereas the arms we see in the galaxies around us are stable.   the belief that the universe cant be <10.000 years old.   The fact that the universe is billions of years old comes from many different sources all converging on the same answer.  The universe cannot be less than 10,000 years old, because that age would directly contradict observed evidence.  The only answer that fits all the observed data is 13.8 billion years, which means that we have to find a way to explain things in the context of that age."

The speed of light HAS to be constant or every part of cosmology would fall apart. Radioactive decay works so predictably that you can use atomic clocks to measure the effect of gravity on time. It's so powerful that we can use it to level a city or power one. We can use it for precisely delivered bursts of medical radiation. The notion that it doesn't work because a 2000 year old book disagrees is absurd. The same happens in biology. Without evolution, makes no sense. The location and role of various animals is only explained by evolution by natural selection. A biblically literal view of the distribution of animals is hilariously wrong. I live in Australia, with koalas. The notion that this species, which is exceptionally slow and lives exclusively on a tree found only in Australia could have walked from a middle eastern mountain to Australia is... There are no words for how hilariously ignorant that is.  Geology is based on the study of rocks, many of which take millions of years to form. Geology, biology, palaeontology, genetics, astronomy, chemistry, and physics. Every single study human-kind has achieved are all in 100% agreement, and there has never been a single piece of actual evidence that throws any doubt on this fact."

The location and role of various animals is only explained by evolution by natural selection.   Your example with the koalas is no good. Do you mean to say that your evolutionist view allows koalas to evolve from another ancestor that all other life forms? What would the line of ancestors look like with the koala at the end of a branch?   Geology, biology, palaeontology, genetics, astronomy, chemistry, and physics.   This is just randomly mentioning some scientific areas. You cant put any of these on your monutain of evidence.

DebateAnAtheist,3dedyz,InsistYouDesist,8,Thu Jul 16 13:37:17 2015 UTC,"How?   A series of mathematical studies called Maxwell's equations form the fundamental understandings we have of how a number of things in the universe work, not least light, electricity, and space-time.  Einstein's Theory of Special Relativity as a theory confirms these equations, and proves them within all frames of reference. Special relativity absolutely requires the speed of light to be a constant. It's a fundamental principle of the theory. If you wish to argue that the speed of light is not constant, you need to disprove Special Relativity.  Please go ahead.   Clearly. This does not by any meen even suggest that the universe is billions of years old.   Yeah, it very much does. We can use radiometric dating to date all sort of things that are very much older than 10,000 years. Rocks, fossils, etc. We also know from radioactive decay what sort of ratios of various elements we'd expect to find, what ratio of isotopes and elements naturally exist. They correspond with an old earth. Not a new one.   I have found no where in The Bible that contradicts radioactive decay, or suggests it is not a predictable study.   So you do NOT reject the radiometric dating of fossils from the Archaean Eon at 3.5 billion years old then?   Your example with the koalas is no good. Do you mean to say that your evolutionist view allows koalas to evolve from another ancestor that all other life forms?    Pardon? Yes. Koalas evolved. They evolved in Australia. When the continents drifted apart, Australia was separated from the rest of the world, forming an ""island"" (biologically speaking more than geographically) that isolated the species there. In particular, marsupials.   What would the line of ancestors look like with the koala at the end of a branch?   The fact that you ask this question shows how little you understand of the principles of evolution. The ancestor of a Koala looked like a koala. The ancestor of that looked like a koala. A better question is what did the nearest common ancestor of a koala and something else look like. The answer is probably something like a wombat.   Of course, it depends how far back you go in ancestors.   This is just randomly mentioning some scientific areas. You cant put any of these on your monutain of evidence.   Really can. Biology is the study of evolved life. The genetic information we have alone proves evolution. Geology is the study of rocks formed over millions and billions of years. Paleontologists have dated fossils into their billions of years old. Nuclear physics requires known and established facts of the standard model, none of which would work if some things like radioactive decay didn't work or was in any way unreliable. Astronomy is based on an understanding of universe formation that spans billions of years back and if that fundamental truth was wrong, literally everything we know about the universe would be wrong.   Wow! I dont belive you really think this is true?    This is true.  Provide one piece of evidence that suggests a young earth. Seriously.  You've been lied to for a long time. I understand. I was too. I used to believe this stuff. I was told things and I accepted them. Choosing to look for honest answers led to a clear and inescapable conclusion.

The evidence is in things like the speed of light, measurements of near stars, distant stars, the change in wavelength as stars recede, measurements and understanding nuclear decay, the background radiation we see in space, particulate density in the Solar System, the rate of erosion, genetic drift, population shifts, materials stars are made of, how gravity affects stars and clouds of gas.

DebateAnAtheist,3dedyz,WeaponsGradeHumanity,3,Wed Jul 15 17:57:10 2015 UTC,"First off, it is atheism because it is a noun and not a proper noun. Just as you are a specific type of theist (Christian presumably). Secondly, you have absolutely no idea what an atheist is. Otherwise you would not be making such absurd comments, unless you are just trolling. Finally, atheism is not a religion except that it is traditionally lumped with religions due to the fact that it addresses the belief of people about the existence of deities.    There are serious scientists that proclame to be YEC.    And what proportion of those are YEC? What proportion are Biologists? Geologists? Physicists? Astronomers? Why are these questions even important?   People, as a whole, are stupid. On top of that, there is more information out there than a person can know. So to say that some one as general as a 'scientist' consequently knows everything is absurd. Then to try and take that assumed authority and project it onto their beliefs is then sloppy. If you wanted to do that, you should put it in perspective. I am sure we can find scientists that also believe in cryptozoology. Just because someone that is knowledgeable about a subject does not mean they don't have misfounded beliefs. Also, not every discipline of science deals with topics that would show evidence against YEC.    They will use the same scientific data to back up their believs, like the evolutionists do.    Eh, no. If they did, then there would be a consensus that YEC was true. They ignore evidence and manufacture convoluted ideas in strange situations to reinforce views they already hold. Some people believe that science is just like a religion holding to dogma. While there is some truth to the idea that it can be slow to change, that is because of a preponderance of evidence that has to be established. Science changes quite rapidly when you consider all the things it has to account for. And it not only changes in one area, it changes across the world as soon as the evidence disseminates and the ideas spread. Yet YEC has never caught on. Just like climate change deniers.   The evidence supports an observable universe of billions of years in age. Anyone can choose to ignore the evidence. Their profession does not mean that they won't ignore evidence. It just means they are bad at being skeptical.    They just dont have to rely on wild assumptions or numerous alterations to have their belief make sense.    Actually, they do. Usually, in the case of the average person, it is just ignorance. Depending on what discipline of science the scientist studies, it might be as well. However, any one can fool themselves into believing what they want. People do it all the time. The spouse being beaten but their partner 'had a good reason', 'it was my fault', and 'they did not mean it'. People are good at denying things that are in front of their face. So finding the few that refuse to listen does not prove anything other than that they will not listen."

However, if this were the case, then the arms would become more and more tightly wound, since the matter nearer to the center of the galaxy rotates faster than the matter at the edge of the galaxy. The arms would become indistinguishable from the rest of the galaxy after only a few orbits. This is called the winding problem.[2]  Lin and Shu proposed in 1964 that the arms were not material in nature, but instead made up of areas of greater density...""  This perfectly demonstrate what I am talking about.   Again, a bit more consentrated: ""However, if this were the case, then the arms would become more and more tightly wound, since the matter nearer to the center of the galaxy rotates faster than the matter at the edge of the galaxy.""  This is based on the assumption that the universe is billions of years old. Loose that assumption, and a <10.000 year old universe give a perfect explaination.  So I guess my point is: Every single conclution dating the universe to be billions of years old is based on the precunsumed assumption that is IS billions of years old."
DebateAnAtheist,3dedyz,setecordas,16,Wed Jul 15 18:03:31 2015 UTC,"his is based on the assumption that the universe is billions of years old. Loose that assumption, and a <10.000 year old universe give a perfect explaination.   No it doesn't. If the universe were only 10k years old, we wouldn't even be able to see these galaxies to comment upon their shapes since they're more than 10k light years away.   So I guess my point is: Every single conclution dating the universe to be billions of years old is based on the precunsumed assumption that is IS billions of years old.   No it isn't. All of it is based on fundamental physics. For example, we know that the universe has to be at least as old as the time it took for light from the furthest visible galaxy to reach us (~13 billion years). Why do we know this? Because we know the speed of light in a vacuum and can measure the distance of things with parallax (and other methods).  The reason the universe is held to be ancient is because multiple independent methods of establishing the age of things find it to be very old. Some with more or less accuracy, but all of them agree that it's certainly more than 10,000 years old. The only way to get to a ""young universe"" is to essentially throw out real measurements and observations and replace it with fairy tales.  To put it another way; if you think spiral galaxy formation is a problem for an old universe, then innumerable other facets of science are even more of a problem for a young universe. For example, why are there elements heavier than iron outside of supermassive stars? The customary explanation for this (supernovae) does not work if there hasn't been quite a lot of time already past."

This is an instrumentation problem, not an uncertainty in the physics. There's no way to communicate information about the reception of light at the detector that will return information to the observer faster than light.

DebateAnAtheist,3d51vs,N0CLASS,6,Tue Jul 14 17:07:22 2015 UTC,"My reasoning starts from the assertion that the US government decided to be separate from religion.   It means that it has either to endorse all of their practices or none of them. I think it is obvious that endorsing none is the only practical way to go. Things like organizing a religious ceremony would violate this principle.  The problem highlighted by OP is that the US government also chooses dates that are federal holidays, and some of them have a religious nature, suggesting that they may constitute a violation of the non-endorsement duty.   I am suggesting that the fact of recognizing some days as holidays does not constitute a recognition or endorsement of a religion. It is merely an acknowledgement that many people in the US would anyway take this day off which seems to me (but that is open to debate) like an objective and secular criterion to decide a federal holiday."

It is something our secular minded founding fathers wanted so that we avoid the mistakes made by European theocratic governance.   ""Separation of church and state"" (sometimes ""wall of separation between church and state"") is a phrase used by Thomas Jefferson and others expressing an understanding of the intent and function of the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. Since the First Amendment clearly places the restrictions solely on the state, some argue a more correct phrase would be the ""separation of state FROM church"". Either way, the ""separation"" phrase has since been repeatedly used by the Supreme Court of the United States.  The First Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that and Article VI specifies that ""no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States."" The modern concept of a wholly secular government is sometimes credited to the writings of English philosopher John Locke, but the phrase ""separation of church and state"" in this context is generally traced to a January 1, 1802 letter by Thomas Jefferson, addressed to the Danbury Baptist Association in Connecticut, and published in a Massachusetts newspaper."
DebateAnAtheist,3d51vs,w8cycle,1 point,Tue Jul 14 20:04:03 2015 UTC,"Where do we have a law that establishes a separation of church and state? It’s written in our Constitution as our very first right as citizens.  “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion”  I don’t think it could be clearer. The word, “respect,” in modern times tends to have the connotation of not just acknowledgment, but of giving heightened status for being good. What the word really means, and what the writers of our Constitution meant, was simply acknowledgment. The government is not allowed whatsoever to acknowledge the existence of an organized religion.  Of course, Congress breaks this all the time, but they are unconstitutional in their actions. For example, our motto is “In God we trust.” Although it would be a violation of the first amendment anyway, what makes it an obvious violation is that god is capitalized, indicating a proper noun. It clearly is referring to Elohim, the god of Israel. If this is not respecting a specific religion or group of religions, then I don’t know what is. This is the American state, not the Jewish state, so we should not be endorsing the Jewish culture, nor the Christian religion or anything else. Similarly, “under God” is now part of the pledge of allegiance that children hear in public school every day. That is a violation of the Constitution for the same reasons. It also interferes with our human rights that the United States was founded to protect.  “We hold these truths to be self-evident. That we are endowed by our creator with certain inalienable rights. That among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.”  Indoctrinating children with a government-affirmation of religion is a violation of our inalienable rights. By the way, in this case, creator is referring to nature. Thomas Jefferson didn’t believe in religion.  I just don’t know how much more obvious it could be."

DebateAnAtheist,3d51vs,gregbard,2,Mon Jul 13 19:06:33 2015 UTC,"It seems to me that the government might ""celebrate"" a holiday on three different levels:  (1) Acknowledging that it exists.  (2) Closing government offices and giving people time off work.  (3) Actually spending taxpayer money on decor, festivities, and celebratory activities.  For the first one, I don't see why it's an issue at all.  Even the most religious-based holiday might be acknowledges as something that some people recognize, without the government having to say anything about whether the story behind the holiday holds water.  For the second, it's just tradition that certain days have long been expected to be days when the government is closed for business.  Christmas is recognized in this manner, and giving people the day off is largely a matter of practicality, as so many people would want that day off that they might as well close for it; it would be hard to get any work done anyway.  Again, any day may be so acknowledge without giving credence to the story behind it.  The third is where things get complicated, and where one must make judgment calls.  Again, let's look at Christmas, because that's really where the focus of this argument is.  One very pervasive symbol is the Christmas Tree, and here I don't see why it can't be considered a secular thing.  The concept of decorating trees stems from celebrations of the Winter Solstice, which is based on a fact of nature:  the shortest day of the year (in terms of daylight hours) in the northern hemisphere.  Christians adopted the decorated tree when they shoved their way into midwinter celebrations, but they don't own it and there's nothing necessarily religious about it.  Therefore, I see nothing wrong with festive trees at the White House, so long as they display no overt religious symbolism.  Nativity scenes are another matter.  There is absolutely no mistaking the religiosity there.  It is clearly a depiction of Christ, and images from the Bible; it is exclusively representative of the Christian faith.  That makes it something which should NOT be funded by government or placed on public land.  The same goes for other symbols which are specific to certain religions, such as a menorah or whatever they display during Ramadan, if anything (I don't feel like looking it up)."

If by acknowledge you mean ""forbid everyone from working"" then no, they shouldn't. If you mean ""give federal employees the day off"" sure.  2) You use the word celebrate which implies something different than acknowledge, and I suppose it depends on how they celebrate. This is a good question though. You single out the Winter Solstice but I actually think Halloween is the odd one out in your examples. It is the only one that is solely related to a strictly religious and not astronomical calendar (relating to All Saint's Day on the following day). Thanksgiving while it has religious connotations, was not part of a liturgical calendar for a specific religion. Should the President pardon a turkey at Thanksgiving? No, but not because of religion, just because it is a silly tradition (which I think goes back to Reagan or Bush I). As for the Winter Solstice, it is a day that is tied specifically to astronomy and therefore isn't owned by any religion. It really depends on how it is celebrated. I would say that if bonfires were lit on the White House lawn and members of the government started having public orgies, that would probably cross a line."

Obviously somebody has to be at the police station Christmas morning, so there is no way to perfectly satisfy everyone, but you could rotate who is stuck working Christmas morning if everyone wants that time off.

DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,raffastafarian,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:58:39 2015 UTC,"Most atheists here are agnostic atheists. They are not making claims regarding the existence of God.  Yet I am not sure whether that makes them neutral according to your definition as most of us do make claims onreligious claims (that they are unfounded, basically). We also generally claim that there is no known and valid proof of an existence of God.  Note however that I am referring to the particular brand of atheism here. The pure, exact, definition is an absence of belief in the existence of God."

Theists are making the claim that something invisible, intangible, untestable and completely and utterly absent exists. Atheists don't accept that claim because it is invisible, intangible, untestable and completely and utterly absent.  It's theists that have to supply evidence to support their positive claim, not the atheists for finding that the evidence supplied (or better, the insane lack of evidence) is insufficient.  So no, as per your edit, atheism isn't a positive claim, theism is, atheists make no claim there is something that they can not see or test, theists do."

The complete lack of evidence for said proposition is all you can go by.  You can't prove something does not exist, only that it does.  So the best evidence of the non existence of a thing can only the lack of evidence for.  However atheism is not the belief that gods do not exist, although that would be an atheist, it is the lack of belief that gods exist.  i.e. you merely have to be not someone who is sucked in by religion.  You can fuck with the definition until the cows come home and it's only semantics.  If you convince enough people that red is green, it's still red."

The exact same evidence that supports the belief that leprechauns don't exist, or fairies, or unicorns, or dragons, or Santa Claus... or literally anything where there is no evidence supporting its existence.  The proposition that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence is not just epistemologically naive, it's incorrect.  The proper formulation is 'Absence of evidence is not proof of absence.'  No one needs a disproof of something's existence to be justified in believing it doesn't exist, but they do need some credible evidence supporting its existence to be justified in believing it exists."

You can believe one side, the other, or be undecided. Lacking belief in one side entails belief in another side. If you were neutral, then you would lack belief or have belief equally in all points of view."
DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,the_sleep_of_reason,9,Tue Jul 14 08:53:59 2015 UTC,"Nope. I pretty much reject your argument, as would most here. Lacking belief is simply a rejection of a claim. It's not a counter claim. It's just going ""Nah, bro."" You're right that ""lacking belief"" is the same as ""not believing"", but I don't know you think that means. All I can think is that you're trying to put the burden of proof onto people rejecting your claim."

DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,raffastafarian,8,Tue Jul 14 13:25:35 2015 UTC,A lack of belief is caused by a lack of evidence that supports the belief.

Difference between examples is immense. ""Alien"" is usually defined as ""creature from a different planet"". Question is ""Does creature from a different planet exist"". We know many creatures exist - we don't know if any god exist at all. Not even similar.  Analogy: Two men are looking at unknown island.

So, what's your justification not to believe that I am God? If I can't prove it to you, it's probably not true, but you're saying that that's not sufficient not to believe it. Could you tell me what your answer would be? Almost the same answer would apply to an atheist not believing the general proposition of the existence of god(s). In case you don't think almost the same answer would work, could you point out why not?  In addition to this, let me give you a good answer for why atheists don't accept the claim: Because the level of evidence that actually exists - people having feelings, visions, near-death-experiences of the divine, or just the fact that many others believe it, too - is the same that many other claims have, e.g. the claim of abductions by aliens or for Bigfoot or for the Loch Ness monster. With such a childish epistemology, you'd have to accept all kinds of claims. Someone else called it gullibility - yep, that's exactly what it would be, especially since the claim is of utmost profoundness. Now you could say ""Well, what's wrong with considering all those claims at least possible?"" - But that's what the kind of atheist who just lacks a belief is doing, too! They are not excluding the possibility, they are just not in the boat. Except of course that there are good reasons not to believe in Bigfoot and the Loch Ness monster, because those are rather easily falsifiable."

If you make an extraordinary claim with no supporting evidence, it can be dismissed without evidence.  If, for example, you asked God to increase the height of Pikes Peak by 2500 feet, and the mountain did indeed grow overnight by exactly 2500 feet, then it may be reasonable to ask for counter evidence if I asserted that the cause was not divine.  However, what you are doing is saying ""God exists because I say so, and he must exist unless you prove me wrong""  The burden of proof is on the one making the claim, rejecting an assertion is not an assertion in itself.

You search the house, top to bottom, and find no evidence of cats.  The absence of evidence is, in fact, evidence of absence. The absence of evidence for cats is evidence that I lack cats.

This is clearly not true in the world we live in  Also, the majority of theologians and philosophers I've read do not share your assertion that agnostic atheism is a positve claim.  It's basic logic.  If you make the claim that an extraterrestrial lifeform lives in your basement I do not have to have any sort of belief in extraterrestrials to reject your claim.  I simply need to ask you for evidence and if you are unable to provide sufficient evidence I can reject the claim as unresolvable.  If you claim the extraterrestrial is omnibenevolent, omniscient and omnipotent then I can reject your claim as demonstrably false since omnibenevolence is incompatible with the other two qualities and thus violates logic.    A good example of this is in the American legal system.  If someone is on trial for murder we come to three conclusions: guilty, not guilty or the jury cannot come to a verdict (unresolved).  The phrase ""not guilty"" is specifically used instead of the word ""innocent"" because they do not mean the same thing.  The defendent can still be guilty but the jury may believe that sufficient evidence has not been provided to make a claim of guilt, and thus the jury states not guilty."

The even-ness or odd-ness of those jelly beans is completely and utterly unknown to you. You have no way of knowing one way or the other, and you would not try to defend the point that the number of jelly beans in the jar is odd just because what I said failed to convince you. Failing to convince means that you remain neutral on the matter; my evidence has been so without merit that it has been unable to shift you in the slightest towards my point of view.     That's just the situation if my evidence has no worth whatsoever. If it has a degree of merit, then it should cause you to lean ever so slightly towards my position. If it has reasonable merit, then it should cause you to conclude that I am probably right. If it has irrefutable authority, then it should cause you to become effectively an absolute believer. However, it can never push you backwards, into believing the opposite.

DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,kilkil,5,Wed Jul 15 09:18:24 2015 UTC,"Failing to convince means that you remain neutral on the matter   With all due respect man, this is getting past dumb into ridiculous. How many people will have to tell you that this is not true until you understand?     Lets take a real life example.  The Courts.     The jury votes guilty or not guilty.   Guilty means ""I acknowledge the prosecutors evidence and believe the accused is guilty.""  Not guilty means ""I do not acknowledge the prosecutors evidence and do not believe the accused is guilty.""  Two important distinctions here. First, the jury never rule innocent, since the burden of proof is always on the prosecution, not on the defense. Second, if your statement were true, by ruling out ""not guilty"", the judge would have to remain neutral and still claim ""I do not know if the accuser is innocent or guilty."" and the trial would not be over until either a ""guilty"" or ""innocent"" ruling would be established.     To translate into terminology used in this debate:  A guilty verdict would be the same as a successful argument/proof of gods existence and should turn the atheist into a theist.  The not guilty verdict is what the debate is all about - agnostic atheism. Not guilty means ""Your argument did not convince me that your truth claim is actually true. Since you failed to convince me that it is true, I remain in my previous state - not believing in your claim. (aka. presumption of innocence). It is not my burden to prove the non existence (innocence), it is your burden to prove existence (guilt), and you have failed.""  The innocent verdict would be the gnostic atheist. He not only believes that the accused is ""not guilty"", he flat out believes he is ""innocent"" and in this case yes, that is a positive claim in my opinion and shoulders the burden of proof."
DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,Lion_IRC,1 point,Wed Jul 15 09:49:15 2015 UTC,"The guilty vs not guilty scenario is an inaccurate metaphor because of the way law works. In a court, someone is innocent until proven guilty, so all people are assumed innocent from the beginning. That means that if the evidence is evenly weighted for and against the guilt of the accused, then the judge declares them innocent. In this case there are only two possible outcomes: guilty or not guilty.   In most other things, including the case of the existence of a god, there are three possible outcomes: Evidence points to god existing, evidence points to god not existing, and the evidence is evenly weighted/neither side has evidence of merit. In the first circumstance one would believe in a god, in the second one would reject the notion, and in the third one is undecided; as they have no reason to believe either side. They cannot distinguish whether or not there is or isn't a god, and have no reason to support either side. That is the situation you're in right now. If all theists' claimed proofs and evidences for god are completely and utterly without worth, to the point that they can be rejected completely, and atheists can't present any evidence against god since he doesn't take physical form in our universe, then we are left with literally no evidence on either side. That doesn't somehow create evidence against god.  A failed proof does not invalidate the proposal.  If a theist submits to you a proof of god, and you reject it, that does not cause the weight of that proof to suddenly swing to the opposite side. It simply causes its weight to vanish. If I am unable to prove the quadratic formula, that doesn't mean it isn't true."

DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,jmsolerm,2,Tue Jul 14 17:50:40 2015 UTC,"If someone calls themself an atheist, what can be inferred from that?   Atheism is a response to the positive claim that a god exists. The response is ""We don't believe you"". A lot of dishonest people will try to twist that into ""We believe god doesn't exist"". There's a major difference in the order of those words and it changes the context entirely. Example:  ""We don't believe a god exists"" - Atheism. ""We believe god doesn't exist"" - Not atheism.  They sound similar, but they're very different. The first is a lack of a believe that a god exists, hence the ""we don't believe"" part. The second is a belief that god doesn't exist. Some theists will argue against this and claim we're playing word games and splitting hairs, but we're not and I'll demonstrate how important context and word order is. Example:  The man bites the dog. The dog bites the man.  Both sentences contain all of the same words, but in a different order. However, that order makes a world of difference in the context of each sentence. Would this example be considered ""playing word games"" and ""splitting hairs""? The context and meaning are very different, despite using the same or similar words.   2nd Edit: To clarify the topic, is atheism a positive proposition?   To answer your second edit, no atheism is not a positive proposition. I'll explain.  There are two propositions and four sides in play here:  Proposition 1 - God exists. - Side 1 - The claim that god exists. - Side 2 - Disbelief in the claim that god exists.  Proposition 2 - God doesn't exist. - Side 1 - The claim that god doesn't exist. - Side 2 - Disbelief in the claim that god doesn't exist.  When we're talking about theism and atheism, we're only addressing proposition 1. Atheism does not address proposition 2 because answering two opposite propositions with the same answer is problematic. Proposition 2, the claim that god doesn't exist primarily falls in the domain of anti-theism (or ""strong atheism"" for those who make this claim and prefer this term).  In proposition 1, theists are making the claim that a god exists and atheists are disbelieving that claim.   In proposition 2, anti-theists are making the claim that a god doesn't exist and theists are disbelieving that claim.  In both propositions, it's the theist and anti-theist who are making positive claims. It is up to them to shoulder the burden of proof and back up their claims. The atheist and theist who disbelieve the claims are under no obligation to prove their disbelief. Just like you're under no obligation to prove your disbelief when someone claims Bigfoot, Santa, and the Tooth Fairy exist.  Those who make claims shoulder the burden of proof."
DebateAnAtheist,3d88d7,LeftyLewis,0,Wed Jul 15 00:20:51 2015 UTC,"""We don't believe a god exists"" - Atheism. ""We believe god doesn't exist"" - Not atheism.   The fact that those two things mean the same thing is being masked in wordplay. We believe a god doesn't exist. -> We believe no god exists. -> We believe there is no god that exists. -> We believe that a god does not exist. All of these things mean the same thing. I tried to connect the ones that were closest to each other to make it as clear as possible. The only real difference in meaning between your first statement and your second is in your first you say a god, and in your second you say god.   Those who make claims shoulder the burden of proof.   You're right. If someone makes a claim, the burden of proofs rests upon them. But if they fail to meet that burden, then that doesn't suddenly make the opposite true. It only makes there now be no evidence one way or the other.     Consider this simple but potent analogy: Suppose evidences are like blocks of stone, with their weight being the strength of the evidence. These evidences for two sides of an argument are stacked up on either side of a scale. The heavier side has more evidence and is therefore probably correct.   Now consider an empty scale. There is no weight on either side, and the measurer of the scale has no way to distinguish which side is right and which is wrong. Suddenly, a proof is discovered for one side. A block of stone is added to that side, and now they are winning. But then, the proof is refuted, and the block of stone is removed. Where is the scale now? Back to neutral. There is once again no way to distinguish which is correct; the measurer has no cause to be anything but undecided on the matter. There is no counterbalance that is added to the other side when the first side's proof is refuted. The block of stone that was taken off the first side is not added to the second; it simply disintegrates without a trace. The situation is just as it previously was.  Submitting a false proof does not refute your side.  If that were not true, then I could refute the Pythagorean Theorem with only very poor math skills and a chalkboard. Note that I would not claim that all proofs of god's existence are false, but I am only trying to make sure that we can agree that our starting point without any proofs one way or the other is a neutral position."

We believe a god doesn't exist. -> We believe no god exists. -> We believe there is no god that exists. -> We believe that a god does not exist. All of these things mean the same thing. I tried to connect the ones that were closest to each other to make it as clear as possible. The only real difference in meaning between your first statement and your second is in your first you say a god, and in your second you say god.   No, you've missed the point entirely. To say that the two are the same and that it's ""wordplay"" would also mean my other example involving man/dog biting are also the same and that it's just wordplay. Just because they look similar and contain similar words in a different order does not mean they're the same.    The man bites the dog. is NOT the same as: The dog bites the man.   You are confusing the words with the context.   You're right. If someone makes a claim, the burden of proofs rests upon them. But if they fail to meet that burden, then that doesn't suddenly make the opposite true. It only makes there now be no evidence one way or the other.   Correct. What you don't seem to grasp is that atheism is the default answer. Atheism does not say ""god doesn't exist"", atheism is the default position on the positive claim that a god does exist. I illustrated this earlier:  We don't believe a god exists = Atheism. We believe a god doesn't exist = Not atheism.  Those two statements are NOT the same, just as the man/dog bite statements are NOT the same.   Now consider an empty scale. There is no weight on either side, and the measurer of the scale has no way to distinguish which side is right and which is wrong. Suddenly, a proof is discovered for one side. A block of stone is added to that side, and now they are winning. But then, the proof is refuted, and the block of stone is removed. Where is the scale now? Back to neutral.   Back to neutral, aka atheism. I agree. You seem to be confusing atheism with anti-theism. Atheism does not say ""god doesn't exist"". That's a separate proposition and one that stands or falls on it's own merits. But claims about existence have a default position and that's to disbelieve until proven true. That's what atheism is. Here's a simple example for you to get what atheism is:  Theist - ""God exists and I have proof."" Atheist - ""I don't believe you, show me that proof."" (theist presents faulty proof) Atheist - ""This proof isn't proof at all. I still don't believe you."" Theist - ""Well show me the proof that god doesn't exist."" Atheist - ""I never made that claim. You shoulder the burden of proof for your claim.""  Do you get it now?"

Maybe; we can't see it, anyway.   I say, ""fuck it, there's no cat"".   ""But how do you know?"", you say.   ""I don't,"" say I, ""I just can't see any fucking black cat.""   ""But what reason is there to make such a claim? After all, it could still be there, even if you don't see it.""  ""Yeah, but I do not know. I am missing information. I cannot act on information I don't have. Understand? There's no cat because to the best of my ability I cannot see one. If I do, I'll update my beliefs accordingly, but based on my most reliable source of knowledge (my own eyes), there is no cat.""  ""But what about this book?"" You say, as you pull a book out of your pocket. ""It speaks of the black cat being in that room!""  ""Huh,"" I say. ""Interesting. Maybe — wait, where did you get that? Who wrote it? How am I supposed to just trust what that book says?""    I can't keep this going, because I really don't know what the next hypothetical response is.   Anyway, my point still stands.   The difference between an atheistic viewpoint and a theistic viewpoint is that the latter has at least one belief that the former simply lacks. The latter accepts one or more deities on faith; the former cannot accept them on faith alone, for whatever reason. In my case, it is because I can't accept anything on faith alone, and require valid proof or some demonstration of the truthfulness of a given proposition.   In other words, yes, atheism (not touching on stuff like agnosticism) is kind of a positive proposition, based on the idea that things cannot be believed without supporting evidence, and must therefore (since they cannot be believed) be disbelieved. So, yeah.   What do you think?"

Atheism is NOT a form of epistemology.  It is the product OF epistemology. (That's not evidence. Yes it is. No it's not. Yes it is....etc.)  Atheism has no self-evidently superior means of appraising and refuting alternative theistic worldviews and calling ones ideological opponents 'deluded or self-deceptive or liars' is a tactic that can equally and just as unfairly be used on atheists.  Atheism has no monopoly or mandate to make zero-burden-of-proof statements about the non-existence of divinity.  And the opponents of atheism are not 'required' to prove their statements in the face of some premise that atheism is the default position.

Do you have a valid and reliable methodology for ensuring that your belief in god is true?  What you talked about in your conversion was a lot of ""personal experiences"" that you couldn't explain, so you came to the conclusion that god must have done it.  You had a few weird ""feelings"", you think you heard voices, and you immediately come to the conclusion that not only was this supernatural in origin, it was specifically the Christian god.  It doesn't seem like you did anything to actually confirm supernatural causation.  You didn't do anything to evaluate the experience and determine the most likely explanation.  You immediately assumed a very, very specific cause without any justification and certainly without independent verification.  That doesn't at all seem like someone who cares about whether or not their beliefs are true.  If you did actually care you would have some valid and reliable method for ensuring your belief is true.

I would have loved to have dismissed them as psychological tricks at the time.  It was really kind of scary in the way that I was someone who didn't believe in anything remotely supernatural who now felt like something spiritual was trying to communicate with him, and then came to the conclusion that that being was God.    I know you don't believe this stuff is remotely factual, and I completely respect that. But imagine what it would genuinely feel like for you to be in your exact belief set right now and then being contacted by the creator of the universe?  I thought it was insane as well, I got my head examined psychologically and physically.  I didn't believe it was possible, and I didn't  want it to be possible.    I glossed over the third day of my conversion for space, but it was one of the most frightening days of my life in spite of the fact that I haven't had a better moment than when I actually accepted it.

I forget exactly what the name of the channel was, but it was like 13 parts. It used an allegory of a cat in the closet that I really liked, if that helps jog anybody's memory.  I talked about it with my college roommate, and he lent me Demon Haunted World and God Delusion, both of which I devoured and thought made pretty impenetrable arguments.  Once I started reading Hitchens and watching some of his debates, I identified most closely as an anti-theist.    I still, 100% agree that those arguments look really, comprehensively, more logical.  I still take issue with most of the logical arguments for theism, and I know a lot of theists will say that you can reasonably come to the conclusion that God exists and Christianity is true, but I think that's really hard to do unless you're purposefully trying to demonstrate that.     I had a series of experiences that I can't personally chalk up to mere hallucination.  Here's a link where I detail those experiences if anyone is curious.  I don't expect my personal experiences to convince anyone else, and I know most people would tell me to get a CAT scan, but in my opinion God gave me exactly what I needed to come to the conclusion that He exists.  I assume He can do the same to anyone else He wants to believe with a lot more success than I could have, so I'll leave that up to the big guy."

I'm not looking to be argumentative, I want to learn more about what led you to believe this. I personally find it hard to believe that all evidence ""points"" to the fact that a worldwide flood never happened.   There are several scientists out there doing research in geology and finding evidence that would suggest a worldwide flood. Consider Dr. Andrew Snelling, a PhD geologist who publishes in peer reviewed scientific journals and is a proponent of a worldwide flood. I'll try to find some of his scholarly articles, but consider this video he did explaining the top evidences from geology that would seem to indicate a worldwide flood: https://youtu.be/8pwTTRjjxUw  It's about 6 minutes long and well worth your time.   I also noticed that you believe all the evidence ""points"" to a worldwide flood not happening.   You're introducing a reification fallacy, because evidence can't ""point"" to anything. It's neither sentient nor animate. You and I have all the same evidence. We can see all the same fossils and observe the same rock layers. It's interesting that the rock layers, to me, ""point"" to a worldwide flood, while the same layers, to you, ""point"" to a worldwide flood having not occurred.   Let's just be careful not to bias the evidence. It's all how we interpret it. Our differences and worldviews don't (or shouldn't!) lie in the evidence, but in our interpretation of the evidence.   I'm interested to hear your opinion."
DebateAnAtheist,3d22no,wowsuchdrum,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:48:56 2015 UTC,"I don't really care what any specific scientist has to say about anything.  I care about the consensus of that group, and the overwhelming consensus (as in over 95%) of all geologists accept an old earth and that the world wide flood never happened.  So I don't really care what Dr. Snelling has to say, you'll always have crackpots and outliers who disagree with the majority.   When Dr. Snelling gets a nobel prize from his findings, then I might consider him worth listening to over the majority of geologists, until then, he's not worth my time.   I care what geology as a whole says, and it says Dr. Snelling is wrong.  Overwhelmingly so.  And before you claim 'appeal to authority' fallacy, it's only a fallacy if the authoirty appealed to is not actually an authority.  So I am not guilty of that fallacy.  Again, all CREDIBLE evidence (and that's what I mean when I say evidence, not the tripe Dr. Snelling espouses) and the overwhelming scientific consensus in geology says it never happened, and the world is NOT 6000 years old, but several billion.  You should really stop getting your information from Answers in Genesis, they are notorious for their dishonesty and lack of care for reality.  It's even in their statement of faith for crying out loud.  Read it yourself, their creed says plainly that if reality itself contradicts the bible they will believe the bible regardless.  That's not scientific, that's not honest, that's not skeptical.  That's pathetic.  You also missued this:  Reification (also known as concretism, hypostatization, or the fallacy of misplaced concreteness) is a fallacy of ambiguity, when an abstraction (abstract belief or hypothetical construct) is treated as if it were a concrete, real event, or physical entity.  I'm not guilty of that either as it has nothing to do with anything I said, evidence CAN and DOES point to conclusions.  Scientists follow the evidence and draw conclusions, that's how science WORKS.  Which is the opposite of what creationists do, which is assume their conclusion and try to find evidence that supports it.  That's bad science."

God doesn't fit inside of our knowledge of the world, gods are perpetually outside of it, safely tucked away in the places we can't see him even if we look for him.  I am agnostic about any claims of gods that I have never heard of before. At that point, I either agree that such a god exists (god is this piece of gum stuck under my shoe), disagree (I don't think god is love), think that such a god does not exist (omni-everything immaterial mind outside of space and time), or simply decide to suspend judgment until I have more information.  Using tags like agnosticism and gnosticism are really only useful if we define them, because it happens very often that people have different ideas of what those words mean.  I believe what I believe, whatever labels you want to attach to those beliefs are."

I have no empirical proof that a meteorite is not going to land on my house in 13 seconds and kill me, or that gravity will continue working tomorrow, or that I won't be attacked by a para-dimensional land shark coming through a wormhole in my back yard  after I write this post. Or any of an infinity of other scenarios I can't prove won't happen. But treating them all as equally probable to the universe continuing to behave more or less as it has historically doesn't seem logical to me. If you knock a glass off the table, you don't know it's going to hit the floor, but you've got pretty good reason to think it will. Should you therefore still assume 50/50 odds of it hitting the floor or not? If there's no reason to believe a thing is why entertain the idea? Only when we have cause to believe a thing is should we be concerned with whether or not it isn't.  And it's certainly not pointless. People make rules and war based on whatever flavor of magical creature they think is out there. Lives end, countries fall apart."

You will lose badly trying to defeat it.  I guarantee it.   Contingency – God is the best explanation for WHY something exists contingently (unnecessarily) P1)  Everything that exists has an explanation of its existence (either in the necessity of its own nature or in an external cause). P2) If the universe has an explanation of its existence, that explanation is God. P3). The universe exists. From 1 and 3 it logically follows that: P4) The universe has an explanation of its existence. And from 2 and 4 the conclusion logically follows:  Conclusion: Therefore, the explanation of the universe’s existence is God.  Also in contingency we can know that Something necessarily self-exists. Self-existence is logically necessary. A Universe from Self –creation is logically impossible. Our Universe began to exist. Our Universe is not self-existent. Our Universe requires a causally antecedent agency to explain it’s existence. God does not – God has no beginning, but self-exists as prime.   Cosmological – Absolute beginning confirmed by Big Bang cosmology requires a causal agency. Cause of Physical Universe cannot itself be Physical. Must be non-physical, space-less, timeless and willful to cause Physical Universe from Physical Nothingness. Personal intent is in evidence because any necessary effect from an eternal cause would also be eternal in the past. KCA by WLC (1) Whatever begins to exist has a cause.  (2) The universe began to exist.  (3) Therefore, the universe has a cause.  Design: Specified, ordered and integrated interdependencies aimed towards a third-purpose design objectives clearly infer intelligent agency. ‘Chance’ events within limited time-frames cannot rationally account for Design achievements. No sufficient Naturalistic mechanisms or explanations. Intelligent purpose is far more plausible explanation.

Universe is precision balanced on razor’s edge. This is virtual mathematical proof of intent – a function of mind – is necessary to explain these precision orderings.   Ontological argument – God is a metaphysically necessary Being. Since God’s attributes are metaphysically possible, and all metaphysical possibilities must also be actual if possible, God must be actual.

And the answer is no.  Coincidentally being right for the wrong reasons is not a practical way to live your life.  You will certainly end up being wrong more often than right if you are believing things without proper basis.

Well, that's not true at all.    One of the basic tenets of most religions is that God created people in his own image.  Biologists have proven that completely and utterly absurd (what we look like now is not what we looked like 100 million years ago - or a hundred million years before that).  Now, that doesn't prove that god's fictional, but it does prove that the stories about him aren't true (and, if he were real, you'd expect all the stories to be true).  Another basic tenet of most religions is that prayer works.  Science has proven that claim ludicrous too.  So, again, it doesn't prove that god does not exist - but it does prove that the claims about god aren't true.  Almost every religion claims that God created the Earth.  Cosmologists have proven that claim utterly wrong (gravity, time and hydrogen created everything).   Just because the other side has absolutely not one shred of evidence that their position is true - and the fact that you can't prove a universal negative - doesn't mean that our side is equally vacuous!  No.  There are libraries full of science books - each of which is 100% consistent with a godless universe - containing reams of proof that the universe works perfectly fine by itself, without a god.    Now, not one of those pieces of evidence is enough to prove that gods do not exist, granted.  But, taken together, they do paint a completely convincing argument.  And, how is that, for all intents and purposes, not the same thing as proof?..."

For instance, if atheists are right, then theists have wasted vast amounts of effort and human life fighting wars over religion; and if christians are right, then everyone who doesn't worship Jesus is going to be tortured for eternity; and so on.   I mean if there's no empirical proof on either hand about God's existence/ non-existence   There's no such thing as 'empirical proof' in the first place, nor does proof apply to the question of whether or not any deities exist. There's empirical evidence, and there most certainly is evidence for and against the existence of deities (mostly against)."
DebateAnAtheist,3d22no,green_meklar,2,Mon Jul 13 01:57:56 2015 UTC,"People are going to get all caught up in the strict definitions of agnostic versus atheist and so on, which is fine as they're technically correct, but I feel like you're wanting to discuss ""the vibe"" rather than being overly specific.  As such, let me as you a question:  Would you consider yourself an Easter Bunny-theist, an Easter Bunny-atheist or an Easter Bunny-agnostic? Strictly speaking I guess we're all ""Easter Bunny-agnostics"" since we have no proof either way, and yet it still seems somehow silly to make that claim. Why is it silly to say ""Well we don't have proof that the Easter Bunny doesn't exist, so I'm an Easter Bunny agnostic"" but not silly to say ""Well we don't have proof that God doesn't exist, so I'm a religious agnostic""?"
DebateAnAtheist,3d22no,friction81,2,Mon Jul 13 02:51:37 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. It's fun to discuss with friends at the pub, though."
DebateAnAtheist,3d22no,machine-elf,2,Mon Jul 13 03:22:53 2015 UTC,"OK so a couple of problems.  First atheists do not necessarily claim god does not exist. We say we are not convinced. I don't have to prove god does not exist in order to not believe he does. There is no burden of proof in not believing.   Second agnostic is not some sort of middle ground. Theist and atheist are not two separate propositions they are two positions on the same proposition.  They are statements of belief. The claim is god exists, a theist believes that claim, an atheist does not. Gnostic and agnostic are knowledge claims. A gnostic claims to have knowledge an agnostic does not. Agnostic or gnostic can modify both the position of theist and atheist.   So what are we left with? If there is no evidence god exists and no evidence god does not exist what makes more sense believing in him or not believing? If belief is defined as being convinced something is true how does one justify belief in the absence of evidence?   Now there are atheists that claim god does not exist. This position does hold a burden of proof. Taken in the context of saying there are no deities that becomes a hard burden to meet as the search area alone is quite big. With respect to specific god claims it becomes easier. For example the bible is the basis for the Abrahamic god who is generally considered to be maximally powerful.  Yet in Judges it is revealed that the men of Judah were unable to defeat another tribe because they had iron rimmed wheels on their chariots, even though they had god on their side. Surely a maximally powerful god could contrive to overcome such an obstacle.  So either god isn't maximally powerful or the claims in the bible are in error. Either way the god claim is undermined.   None of that would be anything more than an interesting intellectual exercise except for the fact that the beliefs do not exist in isolation.  Religion is a politically aggressive institution that attempts to influence or control not only the daily lives of it's adherents but everyone else as well. That alone, in my opinion, makes the debate worth having."

DebateAnAtheist,3d22no,khaste,2,Mon Jul 13 07:58:49 2015 UTC,You make it sound like absence of proof and nonproof of absence are equivalent for a claim that has no factual or logical origin.
DebateAnAtheist,3d22no,Doriphor,2,Mon Jul 13 11:00:28 2015 UTC,"The null hypothesis is that God may or may not exist (agnosticism), because no truth claim is involved.

It's really not pointless because the question is relevant, but essentially you can believe whatever you want, because until a deity reveals itself without any shadow of doubt we will never know for sure."

It's a paradox. In the immediate vicinity of a paradox, you can make things up (incl. their opposite).  I think you could say that ""the theist can reasonably claim that [logic] may not be universal."", but you can't use the previous statements to give it any kind of logical fundament.  And actually, here's simple proof that the theist can claim this - but would be wrong:  ""God needed to create logic for it to work."" <-- This can't be true, because ""If he hadn't done that, logic would not work."" - so it was a logical necessity for him to create logic.

According to theists, logically impossible things happen, and while you are right that this creates paradoxes, it doesn't prove that they are wrong.

DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,ExecutiveChimp,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:50:10 2015 UTC,"Gravity keeps things on the ground, but it isn't 'counteracting' the motion of the Earth around the Sun, or the Solar system through the galaxy.   If gravity stopped affecting me right now, I would float around the room, but conservation of momentum would keep me moving along with the surrounding matter."
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,Orisara,2,Sun Jul 12 22:04:05 2015 UTC,Conservation of momentum would leave you moving in a straight line at a tangent to you rotation around earth. The planet would keep spinning but you fly off towards the ceiling/wall at an alarming rate.
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,lapo3399,1 point,Mon Jul 13 03:15:58 2015 UTC,A ghost doesn't have conservation of momentum.(momentum means that there is a physical force working on you which again a ghost would not be affected by)  It is that in combination with a lack of gravity that would cause it.
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,Orisara,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"Of course, if ghosts aren't physical then conservation of momentum is moot. I only meant to distinguish that inertial effects are not dependent on gravity alone.  Then again, if the ghost was never physical from the start, there is no reason why it should have been spatially associated with the Earth in the first place. Trying to imagine how a non-physical entity would move through reality seems paradoxical. I guess that  an object not subject to conservation of momentum is non-local and non-orientable."

DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,OrbitalPete,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:15:20 2015 UTC,"It's my understanding from general relativity that gravity is a false force.  The presence of mass curves space-time, and an object's inertial trajectory (even massless light) follows the geodesic curvature of space-time unless acted upon by a force.  So, those standing on the surface of earth want to follow the curve in space-time towards the center of earth, but the surface of the earth is in the way pushing them up.  The point is that everything on the surface of the earth is actually what is accelerating at 9.81 m/s relative to space-time, and the things that are falling are actually ""at rest"".  So, a ghost would likely be affected by gravity like everything else.  If it's body were ethereal such that ordinary matter passes through it, then it would want to sink into the ground and would constantly have to fly upwards to counteract that tendency."

As far as I know, we have good reason to believe that nothing supernatural exists and that reports of people seeing 'supernatural' things are generally a matter of those people labeling what they see as 'supernatural' because they don't have an obvious naturalistic explanation.

DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,InapropriateDino,10,Mon Jul 13 01:05:05 2015 UTC,"I have.  I was washing dishes alone in my house; no music or any other noise. There were various dishes scattered around the sink, water everywhere, etc. While I'm domesticating away, a cup on the counter about 5ft away suddenly just slid 2ft right towards me. I caught it out of the corner of my eye and snapped my head around and it slid to a stop.  Naturally (heh), I freaked out, back against the wall, wide eyed and breathing hard. WTF was that?? Now it's stone silent in the house, with the only light the one above the sink. There that cup sits, with me staring hard at it.  Now, at this point, 90% of the people on this planet would have run screaming, convinced for the rest of their lives that they just saw a ghost move that cup. Seems plausible, right? 90% of this planet doesn't have more than a 5th grade understanding of physics, if that.  So what happened? After settling my heartrate, and peeling myself off the wall, I approached the cup. It was empty, light plastic, and sitting on the edge of a thin puddle of water. Hmm...knowing that water has a surface tension created by cohesion that enables things to float, and seeing the thin puddle of water, and also testing how level my counter is (hint: it's not...) the answer was clear. The empty plastic cup was lifted onto the layer of water and free from friction, slid downhill to the edge of the water, which just happened to be in my direction.  Not a ghost. But this is how ghost stories come about."

Yes, in another country you don't have the authority to make people follow the rules. But the 'who am I to argue?' makes no sense to me. If you come to the conclusion the rule is immoral and harmful, you can and should argue against it, or even act against the law to stop it as long as the consequences are worth it.  You need no authority to argue against something. Reason doesn't care about the title or power of the person making the arguments, facts stand on their own. If you have an opinion it's wrong, that opinion is (or should be) based on facts and reasoning. Whether the law agrees or disagrees with you shouldn't impact whether you make the argument.   Isn't the law the ultimate authority?   Laws are made by people, and often just a select group of people. Evaluating the consequences of violating them makes sense, we have a social contract for a reason, but law is just the current state of what the rules are, not any kind of authority on what they should be."

I hear this alot and i always get good chuckle when I hear it. Atheism isn't a belief..... False. A group of atheists share the belief that God does not exist, they believe this... and they group themselves together with a name under this belief. When an atheist saids that atheism ""isn't a belief"" they are telling you their second belief which is the statement itself. Youll find its important that the atheist pushes this and makes you aware of this only to serve the purpose of seeming intellectually superior to God's followers and anyone else who might need to be corrected on what the word belief means.   That rejection is usually because the person claiming god exists has not provided sufficient evidence to back their claim up   Again another tactic to show superiority by saying ""you have no evidence God exists and therefore we reject this in favor of what is evident"". In this realm of time everything has a beginning and end, the sun, planets, and all things are created. God is the creator of the Universe, the very place even Atheist's exist in. Where planets and suns were created over millions of years and life evolved all over with complex DNA codes where different living things are grown to do a specific thing and work in harmony that a plant may not be smart but it will grow and produce a tree which knows how to turn sunlight into energy and oxygen from C02, the tree will create shelter for birds who will stay dry and bear fruits that can be eaten with seeds to grow more trees. The tree is engineered to do this and even it creates more of itself. Every creature in nature is unique and knows what it must do it is in the DNA. Evidence of creation is all around you, complex and designed specifically to do what it is designed to do. There is no proof of God the author of creation? The creations are all around you, who then created the universe? I giant bomb of rocks? Just a random.occurence of no intelligent material that somehow created complex and intelligent life we still barely understand? Atheists can feel smart all they want it's already been written about it in the Bible:   19They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. 20For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God. 21Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. 22Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools   I pray those of you who deny God will read this message and see that your life, your body, is a gift from God. His work is all around you and In you! You have a connection with him just as the other living things on this planet. Don't become arrogant and boastful enough to claim the Creator does not exist for you do so with the very mind and mouth of the body given to you.. you did not attain life, you did not give yourself your body!

You know that this is what it's really about and any excuse you try to make, or any lies you tell like 'the new testament does away with the old testament' (you know in Matthew 5:18 Jesus said not a jot or tittle shall pass from the law), is just to try and make yourself look not quite so evil.""  To be clear I don't believe that about Christianity, but I think it's a good analogy to illustrate how misguided your assertion is.  Do you think that is any less justified than your rant?  I think that they are both poorly justified, which is why I wouldn't make such a stupid accusation, I understand that I can't know someone's belief better than they do so I would never dream of trying to correct them when they tell me what it is, you however have the audacity to claim you know better than all atheists, most of whom you have never met.  Shame on you."
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,Izodius,-1,Sun Jul 12 21:22:55 2015 UTC,"We could argue all day I'm sure about atheism being or not being a belief but honestly I chuckle because I have been seeing so many people push this lately and correcting people to tell them it's not a belief. I didn't mean to disrespect your beliefs or laugh at them, my chuckle was just kind of an awkward surprise that this is still being pushed as if it is that important or changes anything? Intelligent Life exists we are intelligent life we were created no matter how you put it, whether it was God or you simply believe your mother's belly created your body you were created! So you all want to make a big deal saying aethism isn't a belief that you don't except the claim God exists yet in doing so your claiming intelligent life came into existence not from an intelligent creation, a source of all things whatever it may be big bang or how it all started wasn't done with intelligence yet spawned intelligent life. There is no evidence for this either and it's honestly I cannot accept so I reject your claims, I reject your belief."
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,savewho,2,Mon Jul 13 01:37:23 2015 UTC,"It's not about atheism so much as it is about imposing your perspective on others.  I have no problem with you rejecting my beliefs, claims and justifications when it comes to your understanding. I understand that you may feel differently.  The difference I see is that you are rejecting what the atheist says is their understanding of the term, your not just rejecting 'atheism', your also saying ""your wrong, that's not what atheism is ..."", your are imposing your definition onto them rather than accepting that it is their definition, but rejecting what that definition means for your own beliefs.  The difference between what you did and what the atheists who correct you is that they are making claims about their own positions, they are not trying to impose their positions on you, you however do seem to be imposing your position on them.  If I was trying to impose a perspective of Christianity on you (such as the one I used in the analogy above), claiming that you really held to this imposed perspective, despite any claims otherwise, would you be happy about this? Would you think this was wrong? If it is wrong, why is it wrong? Assuming you think it is wrong, could it be that imposing your perspective of atheism is also wrong for the same reason?  Once again, I'm not that bothered by your beliefs being different than mine, I am bothered by what I perceive as an attempt to impose your views of atheism onto others including me. If you were not trying to impose your view of atheism then please correct my misunderstanding, but from your original reply that is very much what it looked like.  If I say my understanding of 'atheism' is that it is the rejection of the god claim and nothing more, would you try to tell me that my understanding is wrong or would you instead try to clarify what I would call the position which you understood to be atheism? (p.s. I'd call a belief there is no god anti-theism and I'd include it as a sub-set of atheism.)"
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,beauty_dior,-1,Mon Jul 13 10:29:28 2015 UTC,"Your entitled to your belief and the definition of it. I am sorry if I had come off as pushy or imposing. I don't disagree when people say Atheism is a rejection of the claim of God, this is true. But to say Atheism is not a belief is just your way of saying Gods non-existence is unlike the belief of God's existence where some people see a lack of evidence. God is the creator and you are living in a world of complex creations. I STILL chuckle at how hard atheists push this too. Atheist's and their logic on disproving God is similar to looking at a skyscraper and saying ""The creator of that skyscraper doesn't exist because he cannot be seen there is no evidence.""  Look around you. You exist in the evidence you breathe it in every day.  You exist in a complex and massive creation filled with complex life creations. There is no God? There is no Creator? There is no evidence?   And so again the Atheist fulfill what is written in scripture:  But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness.i 19They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them. 20For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God. 21Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn’t worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused. 22Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools."
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,a-t-k,2,Mon Jul 13 13:09:49 2015 UTC,"As a tangent, why do you think scripture carries any credible weight, given that you understand that the people you're arguing with here don't presuppose its authority as you seem to?   To be clear, to someone who doesn't take the Bible as an authoritative text, you're essentially arguing for the existence of Spider-Man by quoting Spider-Man and telling us ""yeah, well Spider-Man says that Spider-Man exists"". Of course he says that, and of course he's going to poison the well and tell you that even questioning whether he exists or not makes you ""an utter fool"" (God's quote, not Spider-Man's - Spider-Man would have been more witty about it)."
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,ditditdit,1 point,Mon Jul 13 14:48:43 2015 UTC,"Sorry for not replying earlier.   But to say Atheism is not a belief is just your way of saying Gods non-existence is unlike the belief of God's existence where some people see a lack of evidence.   I'm sorry but I'm trying to parse out what this means and I'm not working it out I'm afraid, maybe you can elaborate? I'm also not sure if your putting words in my mouth ... I hope not.  I think your analogy is flawed, I wouldn't claim a skyscraper doesn't have a creator. Can you come up with a better analogy?  If I was going to try and rescue your analogy I would modify it to be about a specific property of the creator, e.g. If you claimed the creator was an Australian, but when I asked you how you knew this, you admitted you have no evidence beyond 'the tower looks like an Australian built it'. I would reject your claim that the creator was an Australian, because I would find your justification was inadequate, however as I had no evidence that the creator was not Australian, I wouldn't hold a positive belief that they were not, I would simply admit to ignorance about the creator's country of origin.  My lack of belief in a creator of the universe is for the same reason, we have no evidence and no good justification for assuming there was a creator. You are trying to add properties (of a creator/god) where there is no justification for them. I reject these properties and instead admit my ignorance, I'm happy to do so rather than commit an argument from ignorance fallacy.  Scripture has no special meaning for me, I could replace god with the flying spaghetti monster and redirect the claim back at you, that as you don't believe in the flying spaghetti monster, then you are fulfilling the passage also. It's pointless though as there is no way to verify it, so it's irrelevant (although I suppose it's possible that it's not irrelevant, it's a hippopotamus)."
DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,slipstream37,3,Sat Jul 18 13:47:23 2015 UTC,"I hear this alot and i always get good chuckle when I hear it. Atheism isn't a belief..... False. A group of atheists share the belief that God does not exist, they believe this... and they group themselves together with a name under this belief. When an atheist saids that atheism ""isn't a belief"" they are telling you their second belief which is the statement itself.   I see a lot of Christians deliberately distort this. You are confusing:   We don't believe a god exists. with We believe god doesn't exist.   You have the ""believe"" word in the wrong location. The first is a rejection of the claim a god exists and is not a belief. Hence the ""we don't believe"" part you conveniently skipped over. That is NOT a belief that a god doesn't exist. They sound similar, I'll concede, but there's a major difference and one you missed entirely. Missed or deliberately falsified, I'm not sure but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. In any case, we atheists do not have a belief and your assertion is wrong.   Youll find its important that the atheist pushes this and makes you aware of this only to serve the purpose of seeming intellectually superior to God's followers and anyone else who might need to be corrected on what the word belief means.   Again, the difference is small but important. It breaks your whole argument in fact. We don't ""feel intellectually superior"" to a being we don't believe exists. That's just ridiculous. It would be equally ridiculous to say someone ""feels intellectually superior"" to Santa or the tooth fairy.    Again another tactic to show superiority by saying ""you have no evidence God exists and therefore we reject this in favor of what is evident"".   It's not a ""tactic of superiority"" as you say. Evidence helps us distinguish fact from fiction, and if an extraordinary claim is made and is not supported by any evidence, then we are right to reject that claim. Many Christians claim a god exists, but always fail to present evidence to back up this claim.    In this realm of time everything has a beginning and end, the sun, planets, and all things are created. God is the creator of the Universe, the very place even Atheist's exist in.   Prove it. Prove that this god of yours exists and prove that this god created the universe.   Evidence of creation is all around you, complex and designed specifically to do what it is designed to do.   If this evidence is all around us as you say, it should be easy to prove it. So why haven't you?   The creations are all around you, who then created the universe?   You're assuming a Who in your question, and thus creating a loaded question. An honest question would be a What or a How. But something tells me you're not that interested in honesty.   I giant bomb of rocks? Just a random.occurence of no intelligent material that somehow created complex and intelligent life we still barely understand?   That's a dishonest characterization of the big bang, abiogenesis, and evolution all lumped together. If you're actually interested in reality, you'd go read a science book.   Atheists can feel smart all they want it's already been written about it in the Bible:   Why should anyone care what your old book says? Can you prove that the extraordinary claims contained within are true? You would be the first in history if you could.   I pray those of you who deny God will read this message and see that your life, your body, is a gift from God.   We don't believe your magic sky deity exists. You can wave your god around like a penis all you want, we still don't care and it means nothing to us.   Don't become arrogant and boastful enough to claim the Creator does not exist   Again, we don't claim that. You have a fundamental misunderstanding of atheism."

It is a transitional state between wakefulness and sleep, characterized by muscle atonia (muscle weakness). It is often accompanied by terrifying hallucinations (such as an intruder in the room) to which one is unable to react due to paralysis, and physical experiences (such as strong current running through the upper body). One hypothesis is that it results from disrupted REM sleep, which normally induces complete muscle atonia to prevent sleepers from acting out their dreams. Sleep paralysis has been linked to disorders such as narcolepsy, migraines, anxiety disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea; however, it can also occur in isolation.

So far, every supernatural thing we thought existed, but later better understood, has turn out to be purely natural. We've been wrong about   the sun the moon comets disease childbirth drought famine   you name it.   If we take the example of near-death experiences, where some people will recount seeing fantastic, heavenly things, we should be wary and realise that there are two possibilities for what's happening here:      Some ill-defined metaphysical substance, not subject to the known laws of physics, interacts with the atoms of our brains in ways that have thus far eluded ever controlled experiment ever performed in the history of science            or      People hallucinate when they're nearly dead      Shamelessly borrowed from Sean Carroll's talk titled Death and Physics  Furthermore, consider James Randi's Million Dollar Challenge. He's had hundreds of people attempt to demonstrate their paranormal or supernatural abilities (psychic powers, telepathy, dowsing, etc) and so far, every single one of them has failed to demonstrate their abilities under rigourous, controlled experiments. What this indicates is that people are very good at fooling themselves, and while they aren't lying, they are going about their lives in a way that makes them really believe they have abilities they do not.  A big reason behind this self-deception comes in the form of cognitive biases, like confirmation bias. There are a whole slew of such biases that we all suffer from.   I only ask because even most non religious people I know claim some sort of supernatural experience.    There are indeed atheists who claim to have seen ghosts and such, but remember that an atheist is a person who does not believe in gods. The atheist label says nothing about believing in things other than gods, supernatural or otherwise.  That being said, most of the atheists here are atheists because of skepticism. Skeptics care that their beliefs are based on valid justification, and take effort to believe things only when sufficient reason or evidence is present. Atheists here reject the claim that a god exists largely for a lack of evidence, in the same way that people reject ghosts for a lack of evidence."

Have any of you had experiences with ghosts or aliens or any other thing in your life?   Strictly speaking, aliens merely fall under 'paranormal' rather than 'supernatural'. The usual assumption is that they operate under standard laws of physics just like we do. Unless they're alien wizards or something, but that just seems excessive.  Anyway, no. I don't believe ghosts exist, for the same basic reason I don't believe gods, angels, demons, wizards, witches, fairies or genies exist, which is that everything we understand about the laws of physics governing our universe suggests they aren't possible. I also don't believe aliens are visiting the Earth or have done so anytime in the span of recorded history, on the basis that if they did they wouldn't hide themselves from us (and if they did hide themselves from us, nobody would see them, rendering all these 'UFO sightings' irrelevant anyway)."

DebateAnAtheist,3d0je8,kilkil,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:16:20 2015 UTC,"Neil deGrasse Tyson has several lectures on Netflix, one of which covers the topic of stubbornness in both the scientific and religious community. He gives several examples throughout history where our understanding of the world prevented us from being open to new ideas. I believe one such example was how our understanding of gravity allowed us to use calculations to discover planets, but upon seeing Mercury in the sky - and finding it to exist in a place where it mathematically shouldn't - we just decided 'it wasn't planet'. In the end, we discovered that the laws of gravity do fluctuate near stars and other forms. Hence, the discovery of Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun.   I've had experiences that I can't explain, but I at least make an attempt to rationalize them. Having read a great deal on our subconscious, I know that much of what I would describe as 'unexplainable' is more than likely the result of my own mind. However, there is a great deal of theoretical science that could account for it as well. I don't want to simply think, ""If it's not in my head, then it's supernatural and supernatural things aren't real."" I'm open to the idea that things are not yet within our ability to grasp, but I think it all falls within the parameters of the natural order. Hell, 95% of our oceans remain unexplored and unstudied; why on earth would we think we know all there is to the natural order? Perhaps it is in our minds, or perhaps it's something beyond our understanding. Or, perhaps, it's both! But all of that falls within the complex beauty of our universe.   I think that, more often than not, we use the word 'supernatural' to elevate something beyond the natural world and utilize it as an explanation for the currently unexplained. People don't like hearing that particular phenomenons have natural explanations and are not, in fact, divine. Why is that? Why do we need deeper meaning for something to be worthwhile? For instance, why do we need our experience with music to be divine, and the idea that the chemicals in our brains are influencing our emotions is a 'buzz kill'? How amazing is it that we have evolved in such a way that music interacts beautifully with our physiology? We are connected to music in a tangible way, but some people find that to be off-putting. Things don't need to be supernatural to be awe-inspiring or to hold deeper meaning. I believe the natural world provides us with more than enough complexity to keep us guessing and changing every day."

I don't find the argument that x phenomena has not been explained therefore they can explain it with magic to be a compelling one.

DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,nuketesuji,37,Sun Jul 12 06:05:38 2015 UTC,I don't believe objective morality makes sense as a concept.   I believe the only way to properly define morality is to subjectively prioritize the reduction of suffering and go from there.
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,Captaincastle,3,Sun Jul 12 06:12:35 2015 UTC,"I think objective morality has to do with making the evaluation of moral claims as objective and unbiased as possible. For example, the rules of chess are objective.  Which piece has which role, and can move how much, are completely subjective and made-up. The goal, to kill the enemy king instead of the queen, is completely subjective. However, the rules in place allows us to see objectively, given the subjective rules and goals, that putting your king in an exposed position, is objectively worse than keeping him protected.  It's the same thing with any game we choose to invent. The rules and goals are subjective, but the structure is what gives you objectivity, so long as that structure (rules, goals, etc) is adhered to.  Too often theists try to conflate ""objective"" with ""absolute"", and we should call them out on that. Objective simply means something that is unbiased with reference to certain goals, objectives, or methods. Absolute means completely wrong or right for all times for all people no matter what.  I think morality is objective. More to the point, there can be many different ways to formulate an objective morality.  I just think that absolute morality doesn't exist."
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,BCRE8TVE,2,Mon Jul 13 16:10:26 2015 UTC,"Well lets not go that far. Minimally, objective morality certainly makes sense as a concept. It's popular and well-supported amongst Moral Philosophers and it has some very powerful defenses under the header of Moral Realism. Given this, I think we can safely say that at least for the time being we can make sense of morality as being objective, even if you believe morality is better explained by subjective accounts."
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,Being_and_Thyme,4,Sun Jul 12 19:06:39 2015 UTC,I honestly have never heard moral realism explained so that it makes sense.
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,Captaincastle,4,Sun Jul 12 19:54:39 2015 UTC,"Hmm, well what of Moral Realism have you read? Let me give some recommendations, perhaps you haven't come across these before. Meta-ethics is a pretty stick subject, but probably the most accessible defense I've ever read of Moral Realism (a robust Moral Realism that is) is by David Enoch.  Depending on how far along you are in your reading or studies on the subject, a paper that I myself found immensely helpful is The Four Faces of Moral Realism by Stephen Finlay. Even though Finlay says its for a general philosophical audience, it still took me a few reads just because it is such a dense paper (and topic), but amongst academic philosophy papers I think its one of the most fluid."
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,Being_and_Thyme,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:48:05 2015 UTC,"For the spinach test, the whole ""funny"" part made no sense to me. For the spinach test, the whole ""funny"" part made no sense to me. The third example (the moral case) relies entirely on the fact that people will generally not be amused about racism. If I thought the ""funny"" one was amusing, I would also find the other ones amusing,    Think about the differences between an attitude towards spinach and an attitude towards slavery. There is something about these attitudes that makes the joke funny in the spinach case but the joke not funny in the slavery case. Enoch makes it a bit more explicit when he mentions the objectivity of the Earth's orbit. ""Slavery is wrong"" behaves exactly like the claim ""Earth orbits around the sun,"" but quite unlike the claim ""I dislike spinach."" Enoch is pointing to the fact that we take slavery to be about an objective state of affairs, while disliking spinach is not.   since they are involve the same fallacy (being the claim that you would not like to have the alternative view because it disagrees with your current view, even though you would be just as satisfied with the alternative view if you had it).    I don't understand how that's a fallacy, and this doesn't seem to be a mark against Enoch's argument. We can well imagine asking people in slavery-accepting states to encounter the same sense of objectivity with some other moral claims. Enoch is using slavery probably because we take it as prima facie morally wrong, to such an extent that if someone thought slavery was morally right they'd simply be wrong, and the proposition itself behaves this way. People in the slavery-accepting states simply didn't have the moral knowledge to know that their belief in slavery being right was incorrect.   I don't think that fallacy disappears when morality comes into the picture.    You're going to have to explain how its a fallacy because I'm not seeing it.   I am morally against racism because I don't like suffering and I have empathy. I don't claim that because lots of people agree with that, it must be objectively morally wrong.   But if the Spinach test is anything to go by, slavery is wrong but its not wrong in virtue of the fact that you don't like suffering. Indeed, suffering or harm in general doesn't seem to make something morally wrong. Empathy isn't enough either. That might explain some sort of psychological mechanism by which we express concern for others, but we're talking more about the truth makers, about the things that make a proposition like ""slavery is wrong"" as true.   For the disagreement and deliberation test, the case about whether or not abortion is morally right seems to me exactly like the chocolate case. One one side, a person may prefer milk chocolate, like one may prefer allowing people to give up their children if they don't want to have to take care of them or even go through with the pregnancy. On the other side, a person may prefer bitter chocolate, like one may prefer saving the life of the unborn child. There is no hint of either of these options being objectively morally right, and both come down to preferences. I am morally for abortion, since I don't like being forced to have responsibility for something I don't want, and I have empathy. I don't claim that abortion is objectively morally right just because I subjectively think it is.   This sounds like a rehash of your previous point. It isn't clear to me empathy disproves objective morality.   For the counterfactual test, gender-based discrimination does not appear to have any objective moral value, and he probably explained it in the weakest way out of all of them in this case, because his assertion comes entirely down to ""I believe it now, so it must be true objectively.""   Enoch quite explicitly states in the same section that something is wrong not in virtue of our beliefs about the matter, since beliefs on the matter don't make something right either. So I'm not sure how you could have interpreted him differently.    The rest of the argument seems to rely entirely on the above fallacies.   None of what you have said so far points to any fallacies. Part of the problem I think is that you've failed to understand Enoch's points, and seem to be relying too heavily on the notion of empathy as having explanatory power, when it doesn't.   Both of them have morally sound arguments, because they both have good intentions, but they disagree. If there is a strong argument for morality being subjective, it's this clear contradiction.   Moral dilemma's still exist because our moral epistemology is not infallible. If it was, then moral disagreement would arguably be non-existence. People can develop good moral arguments for their position, but that doesn't mean there isn't an objectively right answer. It just means the truth of the moral claim is more difficult to get at then others."
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,Being_and_Thyme,-1,Tue Jul 14 22:54:42 2015 UTC,"I would say that ""slavery is wrong"" attempts to describe an objective fact, but ""wrong"" itself is not well-defined. You could argue that ""wrong"" and ""right"" are fundamental states like true and false, but that doesn't really make sense to me, and they don't seem to have any logical connection to reality.   Wrong and right can be pretty precise. Wrong is something we ought not to do, and right is something we ought to do. Going beyond this into the issue of how we determine what is wrong and what is right is not really the issue here. It should be noted here that Enoch's defense isn't suppose to be the end all of Moral Realism. All Enoch is doing here is noting how the behaviour of our attitudes and propositions regarding moral claims have a pretense to objectivity.    Also, ""slavery is wrong"", to me, means ""I dislike slavery (and its implications)"".   You say this, but Enoch's spinach test is pointing to how these two statements don't really mean the same thing--indeed, semantically there content is remarkably different. You can dislike something without thinking its morally wrong, and you can admit that something is morally wrong while still liking it. Switch ""slavery"" with other nouns and you can see the difference (you can also learn more about the extent of this semantic difference by researching the Frege-Geach Problem, although it is mildly different to how the problem is being framed here).    The only way to back it up is by presenting subjective interpretations about what is beneficial or damaging   I still don't think you've understood Enoch. You might have various reasons to dislike slavery, but simply disliking slavery need not be an any expression of finding it morally wrong. Your claim here to disliking it is simply doing less work than you make it out to be--in other words, you have smuggled premises in your claims that show a connection between disliking something and that something being morally wrong. We're still trying to find out whether the statement ""slavery is wrong"" is even truth apt. Enoch suggests that it is because our moral propositions behave the same way as other truth-apt statements.    ""Because if I liked it, I would have eaten it; and it's yucky!"" This line seems to be an attempt to state an objective fact: spinach is yucky.   You could really benefit from reading Enoch again. The child dislikes Spinach. His dislike is a subjective fact about that kid. The joke is suppose to be ""funny"" because liking spinach is subjective, but the kid phrases it as if he would dislike liking spinach. Enoch is trying to show how this is different from the claim about slavery.    If you thought slavery was morally right, then you would think that the abolition of slavery is morally wrong, and you would hate to be against slavery.   And for Enoch and Moral Realism these people would believe in something false.   In both cases, all you can use to support them is the number of people who agree with you on what is right or wrong. Slave owners would think that you are wrong, because clearly slavery is morally right to them. You would only be ""right"" because more people agree with you. ""Spinach is yucky"" is equally valid of a statement about objective reality as ""slavery is wrong."" What are you going to use to back it up? Opinions.   You might think its support, but Enoch's point would be that it isn't. No amount of popular opinion will change the truth-aptness of moral claims.   It can just be used in an alternative explanation for morality which does not require an objective moral reality, and it seems to me like it has less assumptions about what can be true about elements of the universe. Specifically, morality is a social structure based on empathy, which has evolutionary benefits (the evolutionary argument is probably the only decent argument for an objective morality that I've heard, even though it assumes that survival is good - if anything, it just shows that morality is objectively beneficial for the survival of a species, but the abstract ""good"" is still not well-defined).   How is it an alternative? You keep saying empathy as if it has explanatory power. I have no idea what you mean. When I think of empathy I think of access to a meaningful use of some moral claims. Empathy doesn't decide if moral facts exist--and that is what is being discussed here. Even if we were discussing ethics along deontological or utilitarian grounds, empathy still isn't going to be enough because then were discussing what justifies moral imperatives, about what we ought to do, and what we ought to do won't always align with what we empathically want to do.   Furthermore, your appeal to a principle of parsimony I think is misplaced, since it isn't immediately clear why objective morality is less parsimonious then non-.     And it is mostly a rehash, because the original argument is a rehash: ""It seems to be objective because most of us agree on it."" Majority agreement is not a strong enough evidence for a proposition's truth.   Enoch is not appealing to majority agreement.   None of what he said points to an objective morality. Maybe if you saw that, you would also see the fallacy he consistently makes, and which I have already explained.   No, you didn't. You claimed it was without really explaining how.   If someone could logically connect a real thing in the universe to an abstract, human invention such as morality, then I would definitely be willing to change my mind.   Then you might want to read up on the SEP on Moral Realism. The claim here is that moral claims are types of fact, just like any other fact, and facts are part of this universe.    But at this point, the amount of contradictions in what people consider to be objectively moral in addition to the complete and absolute lack of objective moral proofs one way or the other, is evidence enough for me to believe there isn't one.   What contradictions? I don't know what you've read of Moral Realism so your claim that there is a lack of proof is irrelevant to me. Also, recall that ""Moral Realism"" describes various theories which fall under the banner of Moral Realism. For example, Moral non-naturalism and moral naturalism can both be types of moral realism even though they offer different accounts."

I've asked you to explain in more detail how what Enoch is saying involves fallacies and contradictions, but you've apparently confused this with miscomprehension. You still have the opportunity to explain these accusations right now. Tell me, and I will try and help you out but don't be surprised if it turns out that your claim of fallacy and contradiction is wrong and perhaps a result of you not fully understanding Enoch.  Also, there is no appeal to popular opinion in Enoch's article. If you'll recall, Enoch is arguing the something like ""slavery is right"" was not correct back in slave-accepting societies simply because that society thought it was was. So it makes little sense to accuse Enoch of appealing to popular opinion if it is quite explicit that Enoch doesn't think popular opinion decides the truth of moral claims."

Okay, it seems the subjective moral view just doesn't fit in your head. Here's how I see things:  Objective morality looks like this:             [objective moral code] [Alice] [Bob] [Carol] [Dave] [Eve] [Francis]   When Alice wants to determine whether she has a right to kill Bob, she reaches into the objective moral code. The code is the same for everybody, and if somebody has an incorrect idea of what it is, they're simply wrong.  Subjective morality looks like this:  [Alice] [Bob] [Carol] [Dave] [Eve] [Francis]   That's it. There's no overarching authority. There's nowhere to seek permission from. Nobody grants a right to impose your morals, the entire concept is really nonsensical for somebody subscribing to subjective morality. Each person simply acts according to their personal code, and the question of whether I have a right to do so isn't part of the system at all. It's a bit like asking who gave me the right to get off my chair and get some juice from the fridge. Nobody needed to, I'm not subject to any authority in this regard.  Each person constructs their moral code from their parents, society, personal observations, etc. If Alice reaches the conclusion that she should kill everyone as a form of mercy, then she tries to. But the rest of the people probably aren't keen on that idea, and try to stop her."

It's still owning people as property, depriving them of the right of self-determination.  I'll point out that in the bible, there are indeed two varieties of slavery: indentured servitude which ended after 6 years, as well as permanent-slavery. What's interesting is that the bible is clear at the beginning of Exodus 21 how an indentured servant could be converted into a forever-slave:   If thou buy an Hebrew servant, six years he shall serve: and in the seventh he shall go out free for nothing.  If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself: if he were married, then his wife shall go out with him.  If his master have given him a wife, and she have born him sons or daughters; the wife and her children shall be her master's, and he shall go out by himself.  And if the servant shall plainly say, I love my master, my wife, and my children; I will not go out free   That's a pretty crazy loophole. Remember: these rules are traditionally thought to be from Moses, who is thought to be God's representative.   This race driven brutality and abuse didnt become widespread till much later.   That's irrelevant. When we talk about slavery, we're discussing the act of owning people as chattel.   Second, sections of the bible were as histories, and many evil things happened that were recorded. That doesnt mean that the bible endorses those things.    So, in 1 Samuel 15:3 when Yahweh says    Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them.

Is raping children objectively wrong, or justified for the child rapist?   You missed the other part, it's subjectively wrong by all social morals we have.  It doesn't matter if it's personally justified because that person doesn't have the ethical right to harm the other person.  Obviously the child rapist doesn't share your concern about your objective morality either.  The opinion that harm is wrong is more valid because it protects other people in society.  A person's personal justification doesn't take precedence if it harms another person, or else society ceases to function properly.  God on the other hand he's the most moral inconsistent. Objective morality doesnt' even exist with him, because morality is still subjective on his whims.  Why would he put murder in the ten commandments, and then years later give the go ahead for his people to commit genocide in book of Judges?  That's not objective morality at all.  It's subjective on god's will.  I would be the first to agree that objective morality would be a better system. The problem is it doesn't exist, with or without god. If it did, We wouldn't have the problems we do today. Instead we work on the best system we have, the one we have been working with thousands of years, and you don't even realize it.  We have come to the conclusion that slavery is wrong, even though religion condones it.  We don't treat women as property anymore, we no longer marry rape victims to their assailants.  All with the help of secular morality.  Since you seem so incredibly ignorant about this. Which I can't fault you for, people are ignorant of a lot of topics, but the problem you have is you like to argue about topics you are ignorant in as though you have any idea what you are talking about.  Something you might find interesting is the idea of maybe achieving something close to objective morality via neuroscience.

DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,MountainsOfMiami,2,Mon Jul 13 03:26:40 2015 UTC,"I believe that personal morality and societal ethics are based on subjective preferences of possible objective outcomes.    To start, we seem to have a biological imperative to continue living as long as possible.  We also have the ability to understand the effects of our actions both on a personal and societal level.  The third, and here is where the subjectivity comes in, aspect in the creation of this system is that if we continue to desire to live, we will prefer the best possible life as we see it.  So, what you get is a bunch of people attempting, both on a personal level and a societal level, to formulate a standard for living that allows themselves a maximal level of comfort.  This struggle then becomes a fight between the person and the society which ultimately ends with the individuals of the society determining how much personal freedom is is enough to maximize personal satisfaction while not allowing the individual to significantly harm another's personal satisfaction.

DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,MountainsOfMiami,2,Mon Jul 13 03:27:56 2015 UTC,"Morality comes from values, which are by definition subjective. The term ""objective value"" is an oxymoron. You used the word ""personal"", but this is misleading in some cases, because it suggests that all of our values vary completely from person to person. We value our own lives, and human lives as a whole, on a societal and species level, and the reason for this is so easily explained by biological and social evolution that I would simply call it ""common sense"".  So if we start with the base values that existing human lives are important, that the promotion of welfare and happiness is good, and that suffering should be minimized, then it is no longer a matter of opinion how well certain moral principles promote those values, any more than it is not a matter of opinion that certain architectural structures are more stable than others.   So when you ask if we can ""force (our) right and wrong onto other people"", I feel like you're talking about the base values and axioms, not the specific rules, and those axioms are almost never in dispute among our species as a whole. Theoretically, if I did come across a sociopath with absolutely no regard for human life, would I try to stop him from hurting or killing others? Yes.

DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,totally_jawsome,2,Sun Jul 12 18:42:14 2015 UTC,"whatever your definition of right and wrong, do you think it is a personal truth or an external truth?   I think that right and wrong are ultimately about cooperation: what is necessary to resolve conflicting interests among moral agents? It's an external truth that it's in everyone's best interest, to cooperate, such that everyone gets a maximum of their own interests fulfilled.   I believe right and wrong are external truths that come from my God. As such I do not believe that I force my morals on anyone. Any more than a scientist forces scientific theories on other scientists. I present what I believe to be a correct understanding of the world around me.   I think that your analogy is incomplete. Scientists present hypotheses to other scientists. Once a hypothesis is evaluated and accepted by other scientists, it becomes a scientific theory. In the case of a god, there is no such independent evaluation. You appear to just blindly accept his moral pronouncements?  I would only consider it ""forcing your morals"" once it goes past the stage of presenting, e.g. by forcing changes based on that morality. I think that within a society, one should always be able to provide secular reasons for change suggestions, which both non-believers and believers of other faiths, can examine without needing to believe in a specific god."

The bible does not have every single permutation of situations and circumstances in human history, it has guiding principles and thought processes to find the right and wrong in a situation. So there is sussing out of right and wrong. in fact often the bible presents healthy tension between two ideas, and any one extreme is bad, and we have to find that happy middle point.  and so there are more parallels than you might think."
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,t0xyg3n,4,Sun Jul 12 09:24:16 2015 UTC,"I can believe that the Bible is right now and then, but that doesn't justify believing it to be a ""correct understanding of the world"".   As a non-believer, I'm facing two problems:   I see many believers with wildly varying interpretations of the Bible. I have no way of verifying, which one is the correct one. (They could even all be wrong) How is it even possible to know that God is the good guy in the story? If the only standard to judge morality is God himself, then surely he will always come out perfect. This seems circular..."
DebateAnAtheist,3cznwf,NDaveT,2,Sun Jul 12 09:32:58 2015 UTC,"External.  And yes I think it should be forced onto others, via convincing argument and enacted law via consensus.  All morality, ALL MORALITY is defined subjectively.  That's because all language/words are defined subjectively.  That is the nature of language for humanity and it is inescapable.  But the morality that you define?  That standard can be an objective or a subjective (or to use your terms external/personal) depending on how it's defined.  The standard I use is an objective one based on reality and the concepts of harm and well being and the axiomatic premises those concepts are based upon.  Premises such as pleasure is generally preferable to pain, life is generally preferable to death, health is generally preferable to sickness, etc.  To use an example, I consider it externally/objectively immoral to force someone to drink battery acid.  Why?  Because drinking battery acid is objectively/externally harmful to people.  Since I define what is immoral by harm, it makes forcing harm on others immoral by my standard, and objectively so, my opinion, my subjectivity is irrelevant.  Reality itself is the standard I base my morality on, the only 'opinion' is how I define what morality is in the first place, but as already stated, we do that for ALL words.  So that's not a problem."

What is your stance regarding that problem? Do you not fear that the truths of right and wrong you believe in and feel justified to affect other people with are really man-made, or even just from you personally? I mean, GOD sayeth ""This shall be and that shall not be."", but YOU choose which God to obey and which interpretation to use. Basically, YOU are God, effectively in this scenario, no?

When something is objective, different perspectives don't change what we see. A rock remains a rock no matter what language you speak. Death is death no matter what culture you're in. For something to be objective, subjective opinions about it shouldn't matter. When we filter out human bias what remains should be the same for everyone. But morality is borne of bias, changing depending on who you are, what your role is in a community and what we agree to be true.  So my point remains: you don't have an objective standard. Your claims to objectivity are based on what you want to believe, not on what you can demonstrate to be true."

The term ethics derives from the Ancient Greek word ἠθικός ethikos, which is derived from the word ἦθος ethos (habit, “custom”). The branch of philosophy axiology comprises the sub-branches of Ethics and aesthetics, each concerned with concepts of value.   As a branch of philosophy, ethics investigates the questions “What is the best way for people to live?” and “What actions are right or wrong in particular circumstances?” In practice, ethics seeks to resolve questions of human morality, by defining concepts such as good and evil, right and wrong, virtue and vice, justice and crime. As a field of intellectual enquiry, moral philosophy also is related to the fields of moral psychology, descriptive ethics, and value theory.  The three major areas of study within ethics are:    Meta-ethics, concerning the theoretical meaning and reference of moral propositions, and how their truth values (if any) can be determined Normative ethics, concerning the practical means of determining a moral course of action Applied ethics, concerning what a person is obligated (or permitted) to do in a specific situation or a particular domain of action      Image i     Relevant: United States Senate Select Committee on Ethics | Descriptive ethics | Index of ethics articles | Role ethics   Parent commenter can toggle NSFW or delete.

The same may apply for violence.  I see violence as a generally bad thing, but there are situations where I think violence is justified and good.  An example of that would be self-defense.  If someone is coming to kill me or a loved one I would not think it a bad thing if they ended up dead from actions I take to protect my loved ones.

Without proper justification, the decision/action must not take place. All this concerns evil or the lack thereof.  Evil is the unjustified ""reduction of another being's existence"", it makes it be less, so to speak. Good, which is not required at all but of course appreciated, is the opposite of that: It is decisions/actions that contribute to another being's existence, e.g. holding the door for someone who isn't directly behind you, but is also not so far behind you that your action would suggest that they should walk a little faster.  Those who doubt that this text describes truth should realize that I basically just restated the Golden Rule, and the problem always is the concrete implementation.

DebateAnAtheist,3cyl1h,Red5point1,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:46:21 2015 UTC,"Atheists define and describe good and evil in terms of their ethical framework.  For example a lot of atheists are humanists. Humanists see ""good"" as that which delivers the most happiness to the most amount of people. In a similar fashion they would describe evil as that which delivers suffering to the most amount of people (although I believe their terminology is slightly different from the way I describe here)  You also have those that would describe good as that which our society collectively decides is beneficial to it, while evil would be that which harms society.  Then you also have those that consider personal freedoms to be good and anything that infringes on them to be evil.  Then you also have the Kantian side, which is somewhat closer to the theistic side of morality but does not require the existance of god. According to Kant any action is inherently moral or immoral and the morality or immorality of those actions never changes. I find this one a little odd but it does have its benefits where the humanist approach fails.  All of these combined offer a good mix of different ethical frameworks with which one can discern if something is ""good"" or ""evil"" according to these frameworks and then make an informed decision. While this does require a bit more effort and thinking than what theists would like when it comes to morality they basically already do these thinggs except subconsciously and then claim they did it based on what god wants. It would seem better to be honest about it and analyze it.  I'm sure the field of ethics runs ever deeper but I only got so far in my time at the university, it wasn't my major anyway. Just wanted to give you a taste of what the world has to offer. If this truly interests you I think the field of ethics is a good place to start."
DebateAnAtheist,3cyl1h,TruthMatterz2,1 point,Sun Jul 12 09:26:10 2015 UTC,That is comprehensive. What if your personal view then?
DebateAnAtheist,3cyl1h,Paratoxical,1 point,Sun Jul 12 10:13:12 2015 UTC,"I personally mostly reject the Kantian version and see it as only superficially useful. Much like theistic morality it provides (on the surface only) clear and easy guidelines as to what is good. This means it is useful to keep those in line that do not have the time, or capability to dig deeper into ethics. For example the fundamental human rights are an example of this. Lacking all nuance and useless from a progressive ethics standpoint but useful to work on keeping those in line that have little to no regard for ethics.  My viewpoint starts from one premise. You feel your own pain most. Similarly you feel your own hard work most and your own joy most, making you, at best, biased. Based on this I hold the view that while as a general rule humanism is a good guideline this needs to be tampered by the addition of personal liberty. As when posed with difficult ethical choices one will always feel their own pain most. This is not to say that you will choose selfishly but you will probably favor those that you can identify with the most as you understand their troubles. We only have limited empathetic capabilities, and for good reason otherwise the woes of the world would overwhelm us.  Therefore I hold that as long as nobody is any worse off, humanism is the proper course of action. If someone is worse off in principle I would prefer to leave the choice to those that would be worse off, if they are willing to make the sacrifice for the ""greater good"". Of course this comes with all sorts of social pressure but there are ways to lessen the effects of that (anonymity for example). This is not always possible as these people will also have a personal bias so practically speaking this should most likely be reserved for severe cases (sacrificing the lives of some to save the many). For less severe cases mediators should be used to determine the right cause. Impartial yet aware of the situation for all parties involved. This is of course an unworkable situation but I think democracy aims to somewhat create such a situation, although many corrupt it to only sticking up for their own, instead of taking the needs of all into consideration (of course still biased but together creating a comprehensive entity).  Please remember that I am not an expert on the matter. This is just what I've come up with in my own time with the help of some ethics 101.  Tldr: humanism with personal liberty to off-set overly imposing decisions"

The idea is to capture the necessity of a certain attribute of being first, prime over existence and Mind, ontologically necessary and without a contingent beginning to existence... existing.

You need a separate concept of greatness where ontic priority is only one of the measures by which greatness can be ascertained. A king is greater than, but not ontologically prior to, a duke.  So you need to be able to describe a case where for A and B, all other things being equal, A is greater than B because of A's ontic priority. I claim this is impossible: There cannot be a case where A is prior to B, and yet all other things are equal. Such a case is impossible because ontic priority does not simply arise of itself - it is a result of the nature of the thing. In order for A to be prior to B, the nature of A and B must first differ, and in that case, all other things are not equal."

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,armand_van_gittes,-1,Sun Jul 12 09:54:03 2015 UTC,"No, an uncaused cause is self-existence, not self-created.   Self creation would be rationally impossible because something would need to exist prior to it's own existence in order to cause itself to exist.   This is obviously absurd.     God's self-existence just means that God exists in a timeless eternal state without any dimension of time.   God has no beginning in time.  Time space and matter are a contingency of God (God's creation).  That is to say, time,space and matter exist because God caused their existence into being.     Big Bang Theory demonstrates that time, space and matter came into existence about 13.8 billion years ago.    You are correct to note that contingent becoming involves intent.    However, since God did not begin to exist and does not exist in time,  God has no need for a cause - intentional or not.   I hope that is clear.   God's being 'maximal' in the ontological sense is not really about God's will.     But if we put that aside to answer your question, God's will is always internally consistent.   God cannot will the logically impossible (absurdities) or anything that would violate his will.   For example God cannot will that God have no will (logically absurd).  God cannot will something that is evil (violates moral nature and will). I hope this helps/"

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,ghjm,1 point,Sat Jul 11 22:21:05 2015 UTC,"Well, they're both probably a little crazy.  But our theist is at least committing to there being a mind, albeit an unusually bizarre one, thinking that 2+2=4, which is the kind of situation concerning 2+2=4 that I'm acquainted with.  Conversely, our Platonist is committing to there being 2+2=4 not being thought, not being a property of something, not being an abstraction of something, not being an analytic statement given some formalism, but rather somehow just itself being a thing, existing somehow as that precise proposition--and, so far as I can tell, I have no acquaintance whatsoever with such a state of affairs, so that I even struggle to put it into words what exactly it involves.  I'm not actually sure that the scholastics would commit to our specific example, ""2+2=4"", being a particular idea in the mind of God... but I'm not really up to date on medieval philosophy of mathematics, so I'll be in over my head pretty quick if we have to get into specifics on that particular point."
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,wokeupabug,2,Sat Jul 11 22:50:53 2015 UTC,"So if 2+2=4 is always and everywhere true, what makes it true, if not some ontological status of ""a thing that is always and everywhere true""? Or to put it another way, if it is an analytic statement given some formalism, what does it mean for a thing to be a correct analytic statement - where does the correctness come from?"
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,ghjm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 01:08:59 2015 UTC,"Well, this is the question of the foundations of mathematics.  I think the intuitionist and moderate realist positions are the most plausible.  So that, what makes 2+2=4 necessarily true is the counterfactual that any hypothetical mind soundly undertaking the relevant construction would arrive at this equation, on the basis of the basic concepts required for such a construction being derived synthetically from the experience of temporal discrimination necessarily had by any rational mind extended in time (intuitionism), or the abstraction of spatial discrimination necessarily had by any rational mind cognizing matter extended in space (moderate realism)--or something generally to this effect.  Accounts like this hinge our theory of the truth of mathematical propositions on things we have acquaintance with, which I take to be a priority in theory selection."

I would agree with that, more or less. Krauss is not a quack he is saying that what we think of as ""nothing"" (i.e. empty space) is indeed not nothing ... it is vacuum energy. It may surprise you to hear that you and Krauss agree on this point.   What scientifically valid model has a universe coming into existence uncaused by anything?     There are quite a few of them. The initial singularity model is one of them:      The initial singularity was the gravitational singularity of infinite density thought to have contained all of the mass and spacetime of the Universe before quantum fluctuations caused it to rapidly expand in the Big Bang and subsequent inflation, creating the present-day Universe.      OK so this model has a quantum fluctuation of the initial singularity causing the Big Bang and subsequent inflation, creating the present-day Universe. To the best of our knowledge quantum fluctuations themselves are uncaused.  Note also in this hypothesis that the universe comes from the initial singularity, it does not come from nothing.    Where is the evidence of this?   There is a great deal of evidence for the Big Bang. There is no solid evidence that it was uncaused ... but then again there is no evidence whatsoever that it was caused either. This is rather the entire point!"

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,Tmay3124,-5,Mon Jul 13 17:22:58 2015 UTC,How do you know that nothing is impossible to be?   But I already explained it: (a) something exists now (b) Nothingness cannot cause something to begin existence.
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,TruthMatterz2,4,Tue Jul 14 05:46:35 2015 UTC,"But I already explained it: (a) something exists now (b) Nothingness cannot cause something to begin existence.   ""To exist"" requires time. Look up the definition of ""exist"" if you doubt this. Now if the hypothesis of the initial singularity is correct then a quantum fluctuation at the Big Bang event resulted in the universe expanding from a single point of huge mass and zero dimensions of space and time. Since there was no space and no time before this expansion event, this event we call the Big Bang happened at the beginning of time.   The following points arise from this hypothesis (if it is correct): - the universe did have a beginning - nevertheless the universe has existed for all time - the universe did not come from ""nothing"", it came from the initial singularity (containing a huge mass and all of spacetime) - since there was no time ""before"" the Big Bang, and since a cause must precede its effect, the Big Bang event was uncaused - the point above ties in nicely with the fact that quantum fluctuations also appear to be uncaused    OK, so there is no proof that this hypothesis is indeed what happened at the start of the universe. Nevertheless it does represent a valid hypothesis in that: it breaks no laws of physics; it fits with observed facts; we can model a chronology of events that would start with this beginning and end up with our current universe; and it has not yet been disproved. Since it is a valid hypothesis it is therefore a feasible way your scenario, namely ""(a) something exists now (b) Nothingness cannot cause something to begin existence"" would not be applicable to the actual reality of this universe."

I see no reason why existence has a necessity of time.  Perhaps we need a different word, but a timeless reality has to be.   The singularity boundary is a condition where physical existence comes into being from non-existence.   This boundary is not predicated on the necessity of a quantum fluctuation event, but is consistent.    This would be the beginning of physical time, space and material, however you still need an efficient causality or a cause.     since there was no time ""before"" the Big Bang, and since a cause must precede its effect, the Big Bang event was uncaused    Simply defining away time doesn't get rid of the necessity of efficient causality.  Seas of Vacuum energy is the causal agency in the speculative QM model.   This fluctuation is by no means uncaused.

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,TruthMatterz2,5,Sun Jul 12 02:44:58 2015 UTC,"You are forgetting the spontaneity of quantum events. This breaks the infinite regress/causation problem. Think of it this way:   A primordial vacuum (which is not nothing in a philosophical, or strict must contain matter sense) exists. This vacuum follows what we will call metanatural laws (metanatural to avoid the issue of natural law being based on the fundamental constants of OUR universe) or basically behaves in predictable ways. Spontaneous quantum fluctuations exist within this primordial vacuum creating singularities which spawn universes with random fundamental constants essentially spawning an infinite multiverse. Time and causation begins within each universe when it is spawned.   Is any of this true? No one knows. It is purely science based philosophical speculation as to the cause of our universe. According to what we know about theoretical physics, it could be true and it solves all of the issues brought up by cosmological and teleological arguments. Until we sort these issues out, I am uninterested in the tedious arguments of Rationalists claiming that God must exist because we have legitimate reasons to doubt that their arguments, while potentially valid, are actually sound."
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,dblthnk,2,Sun Jul 12 07:34:40 2015 UTC,"Time began to exist.    Apparently, yes, that is correct. It happened about 13.8 billion years ago according to the best of our measurements.   Whatever caused time, space and matter to exist is not existing in time or as a contingency of time.   Time, space and mass came from the initial singularity, according to one hypothesis. Mass is a property that matter has, but matter is not mass. Matter did not appear in the universe until the nucleosynthesis epoch between about 3 minutes and 20 minutes after the Big Bang.  The Big Bang itself was possibly caused by a quantum fluctuation. Nothing causes quantum fluctuations to happen, they happen completely randomly, apparently uncaused by anything.   I see no reason why existence has a necessity of time.

The example given by Wikipedia: ""in classical (Newtonian) mechanics a cause may be represented by a force acting on a body, and an effect by the acceleration which follows as quantitatively explained by Newton's second law."" ... ""A formulation of physical laws in terms of cause and effect is useful for the purposes of explanation and prediction. For instance, in Newtonian mechanics, an observed acceleration can be explained by reference to an applied force. So Newton's second law can be used to predict the force necessary to realize a desired acceleration."" ... ""In classical physics, a cause should always precede its effect."" ... ""Another requirement, at least valid at the level of human experience, is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time (requirement of contiguity).""  The fact that you have a ""sea of vacuum energy"" does allow you to predict that quantum fluctuations will occur somewhere at some time, but it does not allow you to predict specifically where and when ... in physics ""cause and effect must be mediated across space and time"". In terms of ""X happens which then causes Y to happen"" if ""event Y"" is a quantum fluctuation then there is no corresponding ""event X"" which causes it in a timed ""cause and effect (physics)"" sense. We do have a theorem called Bells theorem which relates to this.  So, in the physics sense (a time sequence of cause followed by its effect), quantum fluctuations are uncasued."

There would be certain attributes such as prime being or prime mind, where prime would be first (no antecedent causal priority)  and necessary  (due to necessities derived in modal logic).    I have not considered exactly what OTHER 'great-making' properties could be found necessary in modal logic.   The one sure bet that jumps out at me is causal priority.  This would be very hard to deny.    There has to be a first Being that is uncaused.    In my mind, that's enough.    Other 'great-making' properties would be interesting to put through modal logic and seek if they survive. Now, I feel like revisiting the Plantinga Ontological argument to see what he thinks."

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,Dead_Glove,-5,Sun Jul 12 02:56:04 2015 UTC,What?  'Only one of something' does not exist in all possible worlds. Where are you getting this?
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,TruthMatterz2,5,Sat Jul 11 17:47:38 2015 UTC,"Maximals are the top of a sliding scale, I am taller than John but shorter than Mark and in this set of three Mark is maximally tall and John is minimally tall. If there was just me I could declare myself maximally tall but it would be equally true to say I am minimally tall as maximal tallness only makes any sense if you're comparing it against other tallnesses and we don't know Mark exists. With attributes like tallness the concept of maximal makes sense if, and only if, we can compare one things tallness with another things tallness and then we need a verifiable upper limit which nothing can surpass, so maximally anything requires at least one other thing with that attribute to make any sense as a claim and just a couple, or three as in my example means jack shit, we need lots of very tall things and only when the tall things start falling over can we talk of maximal tallness. Mark is tall, an unknown individual may be taller, we may never know how many or how tall the set could get so no, you cannot talk of a maximally something something with any certainty until you've driven everything with that attribute to destruction except for one thing, then and only then does the word maximal make any sense.  Existence, like uniqueness does not allow for maximals or minimals, you either are existing or you aren't. You can't magic existence of a thing out of thinking about, picturing or having a reckon about that thing.   Maximalness has nothing to do with existing or not existing because there are only those two states. You can't exist a bit or a lot, you either do or you don't.    Maximalness needs to be measured against other things or it's a waste of a word. So, I can indeed picture a maximally loving being but I need a measure to stand it against, which will allow me to dismiss the low hangers but will always lead to that childish I love you a bazillion, well I love you two bazillion thing that degenerates into well I love you infinity, well I love you infinity plus one bollocks eventually."

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,a-t-k,8,Sat Jul 11 18:38:56 2015 UTC,"http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Validity_vs._soundness  The word you're looking for is sound. Some forms of ontological arguments are valid. Generally, many theistic arguments are valid, but they are not sound.  Now, here we have a classical attempt to cheat and define god into existence.   1) it is possible for a maximally great being (God) to exist  No, it is not. First of all this is a dirty language trick. We can arrange objects by some parameter and say that a maximally <adjective> <object> can exist. This is different from infinitely <adjective> <object> exists. But that's what this argument needs in order to work. Suddenly, when phrasing changes, this premise looks very shaky.  The possibility of a being able to do godly stuff is not established.  Then, of course, there is the fact that the ""greatness"" is not defined. Why being contingent is not great?  Oh, and while we are at it, what is a necessary thing? So far, every object we know to exist would be classified as contingent!"
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,Xtraordinaire,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:50:49 2015 UTC,"No, I mean ""valid"". The argument has a true conclusion if you accept premise one and then run it through the language of modal logic. But i don't think it runs through it that well and I'm sure there's some equivocation or something in it. That is probably the fallacy, but the argument uses such technical vocabulary I can't pinpoint exactly where it equivocates."
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,Wimmsk,4,Sat Jul 11 19:08:41 2015 UTC,"The proof consists of two premises, one claim, and two conclusions. I reject both premises (1 and 2) for not being shown to be true, I reject the claim (3) for being unfounded, reject the first conclusion (4) for being therefore baseless and the second conclusion (5) is just - as per premise one - a restatement of the first conclusion.  Proofs can never be used to show that something exists; that is just fundamentally impossible and it will at best be a game to see where errors have been made. It further uses modal logic, which is both contested (in its formal usage and for these kind of claims), and uses word games, such as the definition of ""possible"" (""possible"" has two very different meaning, and the proof uses one of them in the premise, while exchanging it to the other one to be convincing).  As an example for the first premise: I can imagine a maximally great being (whatever that means) to exist (that is the first meaning of possible: it can be imagined). That doesn't mean that such a thing actually can exist (which is the second meaning of possible: it can actually be true). Only the second one is of interest outside of fiction, and it's not used but dishonestly implied here.  You could invert the proof to show the opposite:   1) It is possible for a maximally great being (God) to not exist  2) If it is possible for a maximally great being to not exist, a maximally great being contingently (or possibly) not exists in some possible world.  3) It is greater for a maximally great being to exist necessarily rather than contingently  4) Therefore, a maximally great being necessarily does not exist  5) Therefore, God does not exist.  Now, you probably would have to restate it here and there (the same apologists have done 'til now with their version every time they were shown a formal error) to be formally acceptable, but you can restate every formal existence proof using modal logical both ways.  I further reject 'existing' as an attribute (which it usually done for the last couple of centuries), which makes the whole proof fall down. I further reject it, because it simply defines ""God"" as a maximally great being; that does not follow in any way. We don't even have an actually workable definition of ""being"", at least as soon as we leave the domain of human/earthly beings (which has to be done here).  If you simply accept the two premises because they sound true, seem true, are probably true, or something else, then the proof loses all of its powers, as we could then simply state that the conclusion itself sounds/seems/probablies true. Proofs are done because all of these justifications are not good enough."
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,rvkevin,8,Sat Jul 11 13:33:55 2015 UTC,"Most ontological arguments are valid, but the flaw is that the first premise is false.  It is not possible for a maximally great being to exist.  This is because a maximally great being is defined as being necessary, which means that it exists in all possible worlds.  In other words, if you can think up a fictional universe (a possible world) in which this being does not exist, then it's impossible for that being to exist in any world (there might be a similar being that is omnipotent, omniscient, etc., but it would be contingent and not necessary).  The easiest way to deflate this argument is simply to ask for justification for the first premise."

How does the actual word you're using correlate to the current planet in the current reality that we exist in? Why would existence in another world/reality imply/necessitate existence in this world/reality?  3) How do you determine that it is actually greater for a maximally great being to exist necessarily?

Simply saying that a premise is ""assumed"" doesn't tell us anything about what it is about the premise that we should reject, or find suspect, or indeed why the argument is a failure. Say for example we, for the sake of argument, assume the premises. Does the argument hold on its own merits? If so, then perhaps we should take it a little more seriously then simply blithely rejecting it on hand for assuming the truth of its premises--or the possibility that the premises could be true.  If an argument purports a certain state of affairs that has yet to be proven, then perhaps we should assume the premises in order to see the argument through, to run it through the ringer so to speak. If, for example, we wanted to defeat the argument via a reductio ad absurdum then we would want to assume the premises in order to reach the unsatisfying conclusion.   Also, ""maximal greatness"" isn't referring to some subjective value criterion in the sense that ""I think ice cream is great."" It's more of an ontological category describing some such entity that obtains a maximal set of properties. A beetle, being a finite, destructible thing, for example, would not contain properties maximally."

If you are trying to determine whether some effect, or phenomen is real, the just assuming your premises and conclusions is an exercise in question begging. It is ridiculous to go around I circles assuming premises and conclusions without evidence. Even if the premises were true, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises. In dealing with what is real, you have to evidence at each step of the way, all the way to the conclusions. Words on paper is not enough."

Question begging in this instance would be to assume the conclusion in the premises. If we just assume the premises, we aren't (necessarily) question begging. We at least should not simply end our criticism at ""well that's just an assumption.""   Even if the premises were true, the conclusion doesn't necessarily follow from the premises.

I'm not sure what's wrong with that. Their belief in the matter will not determine its validity or soundness. So it sounds like their belief is irrelevant. Indeed, I might put forth a hypothesis believing it to be the case and then find later that it doesn't hold.   You are welcome to try and try, and maybe you will be successful, but I just don't see the point any more.   Well the point originally was to simply engage with the argument in a meaningful way. This can obviously be done irrespective of whether people are convinced by a given arguments failure.    All I want is evidence. Syllogistic arguments are only useful when the premises are known to be true and the conclusion can be tested off of the premises. I want to at least see that the premises are true and supported with evidence before I go any further.   Evidence will depend on what you will allow as reasons for belief or justification. Some say arguments count as evidence. Syllogistic arguments are useful for exploring various relations with given imputed values beyond merely whether the truth of the premises are already known to be true. Indeed, without any imputed values, it's hard to say how a premise could be ""true."" In the case of modal logic, we have an exploration of necessity and possibility, and you'd be hard pressed to find a test (scientific test that is) that will yield a given value as a ""necessity"" or a value which arises in all possible worlds."
DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,marcinaj,3,Sat Jul 11 19:08:44 2015 UTC,"When offered this argument, you really need to sort out definitions before doing anything else.    For example:  Maximal greatness is commonly defined as having maximal excellence in every possible world, where maximal excellence is to be omniscient, omnipotent and morally perfect.  Necessary in modal logic is to be true/exist in every possible world.  Maximal greatness already includes modal necessity... that reduces the argument to two statements    Premise: It is possible that a necessary being with the attributes of god exists. Conclusion: Therefore a necessary being with the attributes of god exists.   Statements 2 and 3 evaporate because ""a maximally great being"" by definition necessarily exist in all possible worlds.    Given such definitions and the behavior of modal logic, you have options if you really want to pick a specific fallacy. For example, these two are very common:   Circular reasoning: Does it start by asserting what is wants to conclude? Yes; Via its definition, to state that the maximally great being is possible in any world, within a framework of modal logic, is to state that is exists in all worlds. Question Begging: Does it start by assuming its conclusion? Yes; Via its definition, a maximally great being must conform to commonly expected attributions of god.

Just replace ""Maximally Great Being"" with ""Maximally Great Island"". Or anything...snappy folks like to use ""Maximally Great Evil"".   Within itself, the logic is coherent. But garbage in, garbage out. Maximally great smell...a supreme stink must exist!   Deeper analysis of the fallacies usually go like this:  Premise 1 is unjustified. Is it possible? How do we know it's even possible?  Premise 2 confuses conception with reality. Being able to think of a possible conceptual being doesn't make it ""exist"" in a possible conceptual world. Do possibilities even have real existence? Or are they emergent properties of human thought? Let me put it this way, if Star Wars was possible, does that mean a REAL luke exists in some possible world?  Premise 3 pre-supposes that existence is ""greater"" than ""potential"" existence. This is a completely fabricated value system of what constitutes ""greater"" ness. You cannot ARGUE something into physical existence."

Note what this doesn't imply, though: that doesn't mean you have a baseball player that hits every pitch, throws a ball at supersonic speeds, etc. And it's entirely possible that whoever is the best runner isn't the best hitter, the best hitter isn't the best fielder, etc. Don't get me started on how that would apply to ""maximally great,"" whatever that means. 2) It could mean that a being greater than that exists, meaning that the being is actually close-enough-to-omnipotent. This is what they're trying to sneak in here by referencing ""God"" in there. Then there's no reason to assume that it's possible for this being to exist.   if it is possible for a maximally great being to exist, a maximally great being contingently (or possibly exists) in some possible world   Fair, but it doesn't imply that this possible world is real. There could be a possible world in which I won the lottery yesterday, but I'm not going to wait around for a check to arrive in the real world.   it is greater for a maximally great being to exist necessarily rather than contingently... therefore, a maximally great being necessarily exists   Spit take These two together are where the argument becomes ludicrous. You could make a similar argument for a being of maximal evil. It sure would be worse for a maximally evil being to exist than to not exist, therefore it does. And it sure would be worse if that maximally evil being had no power which could defy it than if there is such a power, therefore there's no force for good which can defy the maximally evil power. Defining things doesn't make them real."

When I first saw it, I couldn't put my finger on why it was wrong like you, but I could tell it wasn't right. As for why it is actually wrong, it is pretty much just the first premise. There are three problems that jump out. The first is that greatness is not objective and so there can be no maximally great being. The second is that there can be no maximum greatness, as whatever they come up with, I can just say exactly the same plus my god can beat yours in an arm wrestle. Finally, and worst of all, it just tries to define God as something which exists.

DebateAnAtheist,3cwsgn,futurespacetraveler,2,Sat Jul 11 17:04:24 2015 UTC,"it is possible for a maximally great being (God) to exist   First, maximal greatness isn't well defined.  Even inside our own universe, what qualifies as maximally great would vary by person, since the concept of god isn't even well defined.  It's ""greatness"", for some, might be its size, for others its weight, others its density, others its strength, or age, or power, or compassion, and so on.  Even if you think, well, it's all of those.  That doesn't help.  For some, maximally greatness would zero tolerance for human suffering.  For others, maximal greatness would allow for at least some human suffering.  So maximal greatness can be defined in mutually exclusive ways.  Hence it needs to be well defined.  I suspect that there does not exist a meaningful ordering with respect to ""greatness"".  Second, let's suppose that greatness can be defined.  For instance, lets suppose we choose omnipotence.  Omnipotence is a property relative to our universe.  That is, a being omnipotent in this universe, doesn't necessarily correspond to omnipotence in all possible worlds.  So there doesn't necessarily exist a well ordered set of omnipotence across all possible worlds.  Which means that ""greatness"", i.e., omnipotence, doesn't apply across all possible worlds.  This would be true for any set of properties we wish to define a god with.  The set we choose for ""greatness"" won't necessarily result in the same ordering in all possible worlds, i.e., the greatest being relative to our universe may be the least great being in others.  So any argument relying on multi-world greatness is meaningless.  Third, this argument, even if it could be well defined, internally consistent, cogent, and meaningful, would still only get you to the next step: empirical verification.  That is, this deduction results in a prediction about the natural world and as such is only meaningful if it can successfully pass empirical verification, just like any other theory regarding the physical universe.  In the history of science, it has happened countless times that someone has worked out a wonderfully powerful explanation from first principles or a some few observations, ex, only to later find that the theory cannot accurately predict further observations.  Or a completely theoretical ""proof"" turns out to be useless when all of its predictions fail when compared to reality.  Happens all the time.    Theism is no different.  If you are making a prediction about the universe, then your theory will need to stand the test of science.  Theism, so far, has failed completely."

DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,Denny_Craine,3,Fri Jul 10 19:46:37 2015 UTC,"I personally think that calling the death and suffering of evolution intrinsicly ""good"" or ""bad"" is a projection of our moral codes onto a universe that does not share our moral ideas. It is obvious that the universe rewards those that survive (with continued survival) while punishing those that fail to survive (with death and suffering). By that guide, and as that is the only ""moral"" code we can apply to the universe, it would seem that the death and suffering of evolution is in fact punishment for those who suffer, due to their sin of not surviving well enough.   I also disagree on your underlying point about the difference. Sure, there is a (small) difference. But I think that the first is generally a moral action (per universal morals, not human morals, which I described above) as it sets out a system by which those who do ""good"" (survive) reach higher and higher states of being, while those who do ""bad"" (fail to survive) are punished by ending their existence.   However, setting up a universe where death and suffering do not exist (besides defying every law of physics we know of, and thus being more than just a small shift after the fall, but an complete re-working of the entire universe and all natural laws) and calling that universe ""good"" then reworking the entire universe to make everything, including mankind, and every other living creature, suffer for all eternity, as long as the physical universe exists, is a horrible thing, even by univesal morals. It changes the entire game, and per the ""morals"" of the universe pre-fall what god did to change the ""rules"" of the universe was very, very horrible.  So I would argue that having god design the universe as is and allowing evolution to run it's course is not evil, but god changing the entire universe to include death and suffering, then blaming us, all because we completed half of the process that would make us his equal (jealous much?), is perhaps one of the most evil situations I can come up with.

Perhaps god could have not placed the tree right there, in the middle of their living situation. Then there would have been no ability to sin.  Fourth, if god is all knowing, he already knew we would fall before even setting up the situation. The fact that he then created a universe and set up universal laws without death or suffering, thus creating a situation where existence is ""good"" and death and suffering are ""bad"" (being that they did not exist. He called the universe good, so it would be the antithesis of the universe which would be bad, being the ceasation of existence, or death/destruction). He then creates humanity knowing we will fall, and knowing his response. He then blames the fall on us, the species literally incapable till that moment of understanding right and wrong. He then adds into a universe, which was previously called ""good"" a new element, death, suffering, destruction. That is the antithesis of the universe he created, making it universally ""bad"" (universal morality is not really morality, only a scale of how the universe rewards each action, which is as close an approximation of good and evil as can be appliled to the universe).   Whether god is all knowing or not, the fact is he blamed humanity for an action we were literally incappable of understanding was wrong, and then proceeded to devise an eternal paradigm change for the universe which would include the antithesis of his previous universe he called ""good"". He could have ""punished"" humanity in any way he chose. Considering his main concern was that we would eat of the second fruit and thus be like him, the most ""good"" action he could have taken would have been to remove the other tree from the earth so that it would be impossible for humanity to ever eat of that fruit. Then he could have left the rules of the universe intact. This would have avoided the entire creation of death and suffering.  Fifth, Adam and Eve were not informed of the punishment of their actions ahead of time. The crime was literally outside of their comprehension, and the punishment was eternal and far too drastic for the crime, even if we had been aware. If my boss said they would fire me for getting on reddit, and I got on reddit, my fault. If my boss said, ""don't get on reddit"" and left, then someone else came in and said ""no dude, it's fine, it's just a hazing ritual we go through here to initiate the new employees. Reddit is fine, as is Facebook, Youtube, or anything else. If they didn't want you to visit it they would have blocked it, like these other sites are blocked. Just show him you aren't afraid of him and you will win brownie points"". I have no reason not to trust this other person, and my boss did not tell me they would fire me, just said ""don't do it"" and left. Then, upon them finding out they freak out, fire me, hire a PI to tail me and calls every job I ever apply for to tell them I am a shitbag who will steal from them and ruin their business. Then they go and trash my house, after buying the insurance company to ensure I could not get a claim completed. Then keyed my car and slashed all 4 tires. And hacked into my bank account and stole all my money. Then finally, hired someone to punch me in the stomach constantly. This is a bit closer to a correct analogy for what is depicted in Genesis.  As a curious question, since you are defending Christianity and YEC (or so it would seem). Are you playing Devils Advocate or are you a YEC yourself and are trying to claim it is the more ethically and intellectually honet position for a Christian to take."

In other words I only disagree with theists when their beliefs are irrational and demonstrably false.   This means that very few theists are actually ""ok"" in my book. I rarely meet a theist who is actually capable of distancing him/herself from their beliefs and examining new evidence as skeptically and critically as I might, as an atheist with no attachment to my current understanding of how the universe works. I have met a few, and many of them are pantheistic or some other brand of theist that believes, basically, that ""god"" is just another name for the naturalistic phenomena we see around us.  This view does have it's advantages. It does bridge the gap between supernatural theism and naturalism. It allows a ""religious naturalist"" to communicate their ideas effectively using naturalistic language or to communicate using theistic language.   A great example of this type of thinking is Michael Dowd. However, there are some ""true"" theists who I have respect for. Most of them belong to a movement called ""emergent Christianity"". A couple names I know specifically that you could look up would be Adelle Sackler and Peter Rollins (might be spelling those wrong, but google them and you will find their blogs). I may not agree with everything they believe, but at least they are critically examining science and religion together and reaching their conclussions based on facts, not beliefs. Just because they believe in a deity, and divine inspiration behind the events that I chaulk up to random chance or perhaps some unknown multiverse mechanism or something, does not mean they are unintelligent or ""wrong"".   do you see YECs as the most internally consistent believers?   Yes and no. Literally yes, but religion should never be approached literally IMHO. The Bible is demonstrably false as a literal document, so approaching it literally is just idiotic.    do you see the blatant contradictions in old-earth, evolutionary Christians? Do you think they ignore these, rationalize them away, don't understand them, or all of the above?   See above. Look up Adelle Sackler or Peter Rollins. They are the type of Christians you mention here and I think they are the most intellectually honest and skeptical of Christians.    if you were to become a Christian and a consistent person, do you think YEC is the best option?   No. It is demonstrably false. The ""best"" option is an admission that the texts of the Bible are NOT divinely inspired. That much of the teachings of Jesus are likely lost to history and to various purges of knowledge within the early Church. And that anything demonstrably false should be thrown out without thought and only those things which stand up to scrutiny should be held as a belief.    I've done posts on here before and got downvoted to oblivion   Don't know what your other comments and posts were like, so can't speak to this particular part. However, that is the (unfortunate) nature of Reddit. Most subs become echo chambers since people tend to enjoy subs that agree with their basic beliefs, and thus anything that challenges the subs commonly held beliefs tends to get downvoted. That being said, this sub seems to downvote poorly thought out ideas more than it downvotes disagreement. Perhaps if you are getting downvoted to oblivion ask yourself why a sub filled with skeptics is full to the brim of people disagreeing with you. That might be reason to stop and examine your ideas to see what about them is so obviously ""stupid"" to the skeptics on this sub.  (note that some will just downvote you because they are fundamentalist atheists who just hate anyone that says ""god"", but the majority of us here are not like that)."

Most Christians understand Genesis to be an origin myth with poetic teaching; indeed even some of the early church fathers understood it poetically. It's unfortunate that fundamentalism has such loud voices, but it doesn't mean that a literal reading of Genesis is the only way to read it. Also, not all Christians believe the Bible is the literal word of God, but rather a compilation of centuries worth of men writing about humankind's relationship with God.

Take some event in Egypt more than 2000 years ago. We might have 3 independent scholars who each studied the archeological evidence and reached the same conclusion, who are then supported by two egyptologists who found independent scrolls depicting the events in question, and whos independent translations both agreed on the historical event. That would ""prove"" the event happened, even though it really only shows extremely strong evidence without any disagreement from the scholarly community. Similar, but different.  In this same vein of thought, creationism is found in a HUGE variety of different religions, with different facts, different stories, different events, etc. Each independent source tells a different story. Each religion contradicts each other. The only agreement that can be found is within each religions documents, which are obviously extremely biased. So I would say that from a skeptical point of view, YEC is self refuting (being that even those who agree the earth was created, cannot agree on when, by who, how, or even why) while theistic evolutionists are examining facts and applying what they know to be true based on evidence and facts to what they believe to be true and adjusting those beliefs to match the facts."

On your point about God creating suffering, we don't fully know the story of what happened, but we have come to accept the basic idea that humans were given something special at some point, we don't know when, but there is something different about us. This special something gives us a unique blessing and curse, the knowledge of good and evil. Because of this knowledge, we are expected to choose good, but we decided ""fuck that"". What we have come to understand about the creation story is that when man sinned, he didn't become punished with physical death, that was already going to happen, but rather, man died a spiritual death. Long story short, TE is not necessarily self-refuting, just rather the whole story is really, really complicated, and most of it is based off a combination of the bible, science, and philosophy."

More generally (especially in philosophical and social questions) as I've gotten older, I have come to accept that the world is too complex to expect both perfect consistency between all of my beliefs and perfect correctness, so I have accepted that there will always been seeming contradictions until I know everything (which will be never). Instead, I aim for correctness first and use potential consistency with my existing ideas only as a guide to hint at what else might be true (rather than assuming everything that seems necessary for consistency must be true). It works more often than not, hinting that there is something approximating truth in those existing ideas, but it will always only be an approximation.  If you want to have a debate about evolution, I would instead suggest you read the talkorigins ""Evidence for Evolution"" sections and the ""Index of Creationist Claims"".

Consider one episode from Kitzmiller v. Dover. A creationist on the stand (Behe, a creationist ""microbiologist"", who ironically accepts the massive evidence for common descent but not natural evolution as the source of new diversity) claimed that we would never understand the immune system with evolution, but upon cross examination he was left covering his ears and closing his eyes when presented with a STACK of books, dozens of peer-reviewed papers, and several immunology textbook chapters on just that subject.  Does it matter to medical research that we understand the precise sequence of branches in hemoglobin evolution all the way back to our common ancestor with Lampreys? Not every day, but when it matters, it matters a lot. And that story repeats itself over and over and over.  Maybe nothing exists but my consciousness. If anything exists, then it's at least 100% clear that life appears to have evolved from common ancestry. There are way too many unnecessary coincidences that would not have constrained a designer. If species were designed, they were done with the intent of fooling people who look at the evidence. Plenty of creationksts have said as much, so perhaps the evidence is moot. And the same goes for their placement, stratigraphy, and age based on multiple reinforcing dating techniques. Billions of dead things buried in rock layers... in a precise order, not correlated from large to small or small to large, with the same order everywhere on the planet, no mixing between the layers, with layer upon layer in places showing signs of only sea or only land life forms, and sometimes switching for subsequent sequences of layers, with an intricate pattern of magnetism pointing in one direction for a given layer all over the earth then at a higher layer of rock, the opposite direction and back and forth all over the world in the exact same intricate sequence, not even correlated with the type of rock, also matching up perfectly with the order of the life forms burried, with certain life forms always appearing or disappearing in the same place in the layers with respect to the sequence of magnetic reversals, types of rock, and other life forms, again not showing any pattern or preference for size increase or decrease except that large organisms only appear, suddenly at one layer and above, but not below.... in short anyone who believes ""Billions of dead things buried in rock layers..."" is at best ignorant because I have barely touched on a tiny fraction of the evidence."

All history is going to based in some sort of faith in the information passed down.  You can't escape that.  According to your logic we should throw out the majority of all history.
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,Irish_Whiskey,7,Fri Jul 10 17:37:48 2015 UTC,"All history is going to based in some sort of faith in the information passed down   That is false. We compare written history that has been passed down to original documents found from that time period. We compare both of those to archeological information discovered independently. We then compare all of those to other sciences like evolutionary biology (say, for instance, a historical event of unprecidented racial mixing. Evidence of that could be seen in the biology of the decendents), geology, or sociology. Anthropology can look back and track cultural trends and see when an invading army likely invaded another country, which can then be linked with evidence of weapons not indigenous to that group being found all withing a 30 year period in that area, and from then on suddenly found as common weapons.   On the other hand, the only evidence we have for the Bible is all contained within the Bible. Events like the flood have been independently confirmed to have never happened. Genesis is demonstrably false based on everything we know in biology, physics, anthropology, archeology, etc. The actual written history in the Gospels are fairly sketchy being that none of them were written during the time period they reference, and there is almost zero external confirmation. For events of the supposed magnitude of Jesus's teachings, and to have pulled crowds of thousands, they would have been written about by secular scholars of the time. Yet there are, I believe, 3 external references. Two pagan and one Jewish. I believe the Jewish one is the only reliable one, and the two pagan ones have a few potential problems that make them unreliable (I ma running off memory here, might be wrong on a couple of these facts, google them if you want to see the exact details, the point is simply that there is VERY little historical evidence to support the events of the Bible).  So when a Christian says things to defend their religion, they are an obviously biased individual who will skew evidence to support their beliefs. However, contrary to what you said, good evidence is ABSOLUTELY self evident. Unfortunately it is extremely hard to find true self evident evidence. So we settle on minimizing biases. For that reason alone, the Bible is a HORRIBLE piece of evidence to support Christianity. It is 100% a biased document, passed down by biased people, and compiled/written by biased writters, in an attempt to convert others. That is perhaps the least reliable form of evidence possible."

That is, in the formal meaning of the term, a long-since discarded way of operating in the real world. What we instead do is, among other ways, demonstrate things.  Scientific investigations of history do not consist of or provide ""proven"" facts, and no one expects or wants that. Historic events can never be proven, but are instead shown to be probably true to a certain degree of confidence. The evaluation of historic evidence (notes, texts, corrobating texts, geological and archeological evidence, ...) is not done by personal opionen or internet debate, but instead through the process called scientific method. Peer reviewed, accepted conclusions by the majority of experts (the key point here), are not ""absolute proofs"" (which no one cares about) or everlasting, absolute proclamations, but approximations of historical events - and damn good at that."

Your god and your young earth creationist myths were all an intentional ploy developed by these magic pixies.  All of the evidence could also point to this scenario if you are willing to be entirely unreasonable and engage in logically fallacious argumentation.

What is the observable difference between theistic evolution, and naturalistic evolution? Nothing. There is no difference. There is no test in the universe you can apply to any aspect of evolution that would prove that a god was somehow involved. If you have theistic evolution, and take god out of it, it still works exactly the same way.  That means that, even if a god exists, its redundant. It makes no difference at all to evolution of life on this planet which obviously includes us, so why bother including it? At best, its unparsimonious, and (from a Christian point of view) it is theologically bankrupt, since it completely removes any rationale for the supposed resurrection of Jesus."

A standard not a single believer ever consistently applies to religions not their own.   Also to be clear, you said 'his crucifixion and ressurection,' was credibly evidenced. In the response you said historicity of Jesus. You mean the historicity of the ressurection, right? Otherwise those are different claims.   I believe those who don't believe in God, can define and use morality. And those who do believe in God, do not need to reject science.

That's fine. Obviously we don't know the specifics of your religion, you just identified as Christian. That doesn't tell us anything about your morals or scientific beliefs because people can use that to mean pretty much anything.   Myth is that which reveals truth.

Important question. Is he saying that all religious claims are metaphors, or that all religions claims which aren't metaphors are simultaneously true facts? Because when you pay attention to his wording, it's again an attempt at sounding deep while dismissing science and truth. If every religious rather than secular claim is metaphor, religions aren't true. Saying that all claims about gods are metaphors doesn't give rise to reason to believe gods are literally true.   Do you take offense to the teachings of Christ?   Sure. I'm not a fan of apocalyptic faith healing preachers who tell people to give up their possessions and wait for the imminent end of days, who are okay with slavery, human sacrifice, and sexism. Why, are you?    In any event, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.   Yes.   The eyewitness testimony, multiple texts, and long history of religion and belief, all point towards your non-belief being a extraordinary claim.    Weird. Because I thought tons of other religions could claim the same thing, and no single one was considered reliable. Unless we want to start believing in UFOs, Scientology, and trepanning. Non-belief is never an extraordinary claim, unless it's evidenced.    What evidence do you have that god does not exist?   You said Jesus' resurrection was credibly and historically evidenced. When I asked for any details, you switched the claim to Jesus's historicity. When called out and asked again for evidence, you ignored the request and asked for proof against a god, while in the same post defining it as partly metaphor, to no clear extent.  I mean, you quoted a huge block of my response, and deleted the exact section from the middle where I pointed out that you changed the claim. That's pretty bad. Not only didn't you answer, you deleted the question you didn't want to answer while quoting.  If your god is all metaphor, It's disproven. Because by 'existence' we mean other than as an idea. If you mean something else, you have to first specify what god you have in mind. I can think of lots of proofs against the god the prophets of Abraham believed in, but I've no idea how each follower defines it. Just like with definitions of fairies and vampires, I don't need to disprove each claim to not believe, just not have any evidence for it distinguishable from counter-claims."

The fact that there's not a single rabbit fossil below this line or a single velociraptor fossil above this line strikes me as really unusual, if you're approaching this with the idea that there's a torrential downpour, mud, and death everywhere.  Moreover, how would you explain the iridium found in the boundary itself? Iridium is consistent with meteorite impacts, and this layer is identifiable in many parts of the world due to the presence of iridium.

Why are there no pterodactyls or other flying dinosaurs found in any layers that are higher than modern slower ground animals such as sloths, armadillos, porcupines, etc.  Surely it would be much MUCH easier for a flying creature to outrun the flood waters and stay in the safer areas longer. Why are they in the exact same LOWER layers with the rest of the dinosaurs?  Surely even an intelligent land based dinosaur, such as a velociraptor would have had just as much of a fair chance to outrun the floodwaters as an orangutang? Or a possum? How did they all still manage to nicely sort themselves into layers in the way we see them, with none of those moderm mammal types (even the slowest ones!)

I don't know.  There is much about light and light travel that we don't understand - so no I don't feel uncomfortable saying that i don't know either.

I think you don't, because you equated them earlier, but they really are vastly different.  Science used a ""bottom-up"" type of reasoning.  We observe phenomena and take measurements and attempt to build up to a theory or understaning of the data.  You seem to be using a ""top-down"" type of reasoning.  YEC is already established in your mind and you're simply looking for evidence and proposing explanations that support it, all while hand-waving away any instance where the observed evidence doesn't match your preconceived idea."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,Testiculese,0,Fri Jul 10 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think you admit how much you do this top-down as well.  Science has it's own assumptions and limitations, but does little to admit/concede them.  Science can only give us naturalistic explanations.  That makes sense.  But that doesn't make it absolute truth.  Some see that as the closest way to achieve absolute truth, some don't."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,Tyrranos,4,Fri Jul 10 19:47:31 2015 UTC,YOU have every reason to thing the speed of light is fixed.  I do not.   That actually isn't true. You also have every reason to think the speed of light is fixed. We all have every reason to think the speed of light is fixed. There are no reasons for thinking the speed of light is not fixed.  You're arguing that physics worked differently in the past for absolutely no reason beyond that you need it to have worked differently in order to avoid your being demonstrably wrong.
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,remarkedvial,0,Fri Jul 10 20:49:04 2015 UTC,"I dont NEED it to have worked differently in the past, it is just possible and thus a constant rate today does not cancel out a YEC view."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,Tyrranos,4,Fri Jul 10 22:06:41 2015 UTC,"YOU have every reason to thing the speed of light is fixed. I do not... How it happened.... I don't know.   Sounds like you're assuming the answer and fitting the evidence to that narrative. Whatever that is, it's not science. This cartoon illustrates.   There is much about light and light travel that we don't understand...   Pretending it's a mystery isn't credible justification. It's not a mystery.   But just because light travels uniformly and constant today does not mean that it always has - especially if a creator exists that put the whole mechanism into play.   Are you familiar with SN1887A?

DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,remarkedvial,3,Fri Jul 10 19:15:19 2015 UTC,"In my experience the christians who believe in 'theistic evolution' tend to see the bible less as a factual history book and more a guidebook based on metaphor, or maybe poetry. Obviously I have problems with that, but it's not immediately a contradiction, at least not the kind I think you're talking about.  I don't know which kind I think is 'better'. Christians are so diverse in their beliefs that it's basically impossible to say which kind is most internally consistent. (of course, I think they're all inconsistent with reality, but that's another topic)"

The problem with the bible is that it's an incredibly contradictory book on its own, so it's almost impossible to be internally consistent with its entirety.  You would have to believe in old testament laws (which would get you thrown in jail for violating most civic laws) and slavery and oppression of other races and women, so any christian is already picking a specific way to interpret the bible.  YECs are just one of many, many possible interpretations.  This kind of irreconcilability and the search for ""the truth"" has led christianity to splinter into some 38000 denominations.  Do I think YECs are internally consistent?  Not particularly.  But not any more so than those that think guided evolution is a thing, or that god created the initial conditions and everything took off from there.  I think some of those views are relatively more reasonable than others, but none of them are really internally consistent.   basically if you were to become a Christian and a consistent person, do you think YEC is the best option? Have any of you steered clear of Christianity because of this fear of having to abandon science because you realize that YEC is the best option?   If I were to become a christian I'd have to pick a branch/denomination that has utterly rewritten the bible to get rid of inconsistencies, both internally and with our current understanding of science and ethics.  I have a feeling that  99.99% of other christians would not consider such a branch ""Christian"".  I think Unitarian Universalism is probably the closest I'd come to as a religion."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,TruthMatterz2,3,Fri Jul 10 18:01:39 2015 UTC,"do you see YECs as the most internally consistent believers?   I think there are obvious inconsistencies with both literalism and liberal approaches to Christianity. A book of the length and density of the Bible has to have inconsistencies. A Google search will give you sites that will enumerate them. So literalism makes up all kinds of silly excuses for conflicts between Gen. 1 and Gen. 2 for example.   The interpretive approach to Bible stories indicates that things like a six day creation and talking snakes are metaphors (because those things are silly and impossible), but Jesus dying and coming back to life, physically, is a real thing. So while from this position you can say the earth is 4.5 billion years old, the justifications for believing some things and not others seems completely arbitrary to someone who is not invested."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,InsistYouDesist,-1,Fri Jul 10 19:11:24 2015 UTC,"I am personally of the camp that there is no contradictions in the text.  I am aware of sites that list apparent contradictions, but I'm also aware of sites that list the answers/explanations to these.  It is VERY hard to prove a contradiction in an ancient text.  Language translation is the majority of apparent contradictions.  Many more are explained by understanding the differences between multiple accounts of the same event."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,Elihu-gnu,3,Fri Jul 10 19:22:26 2015 UTC,Well a Bible literalist also has to ignore all the scientific and archaeological evidence. It's not a sensible position.

DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,TruthMatterz2,0,Sat Jul 11 14:16:54 2015 UTC,"Yes.  We believe light travel worked differently during the rapid 6-day creation.  We also believe the Grand Canyon was formed by a lot of water over a little period of time (the flood) vs. a little water over a long period of time.  Same evidence (light, canyon), different interpretation in light of additional information (historical record in the Bible)."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,InsistYouDesist,4,Sat Jul 11 14:25:38 2015 UTC,"This is not ""reinterpreting"" the evidence, because interpretation requires some semblance of logic. The only logic being applied is that a bronze age book of fantasy must be right, and since it's right, reality must therefore be wrong.  To call it special pleading seems too mild. This is the height of backwards thinking, and contradicts the web of inter-supporting evidence from biology, physics, geology, paleontology and other disciplines--all of which provide actual evidence that the universe is billions of years old."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,TruthMatterz2,-2,Sat Jul 11 15:00:26 2015 UTC,"It's not backwards thinking, it is that the Biblical accounts are the claim, and if those things really happened - then how would that affect the interpretation of the evidence.  It's seeing if the evidence matches the claim.  It's NOT seeing if a particular popular interpretation of the evidence matches the claim - that makes no sense."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,InsistYouDesist,2,Sat Jul 11 15:11:59 2015 UTC,"It's NOT seeing if a particular popular interpretation of the evidence matches the claim - that makes no sense.   It's not a ""popular"" interpretation. It's really the only interpretation that makes any kind of sense. If the speed of light changed over time, (and to account for the difference, it would have to be > 1M times faster) this would affect the electromagnetic force, and the mass-energy equivalency, which:   would invalidate the conservation of energy. would have serious impact on the nature of matter and the number and type of elements in existence.    There's no evidence of that happening.  And then there are all the other supporting evidence: radiological dating, relativistic jets, tree rings, coral growth, glacial ice layers, stalactites in caves, all the common descent evidence, continental drift, space weathering, etc. etc.   As I mentioned before, it's not just contradicting a single theory or piece of science. It's the denial of a large web of interconnecting facts and theories that is the problem."
DebateAnAtheist,3cteau,TruthMatterz2,1 point,Sat Jul 11 18:57:58 2015 UTC,"No, different evidence (light as we understand it today based on every observation we know about vs light changed in ways we have no evidence to support in order to make it fit what the Bible tells).

Evolution is not the method you use when you know what you are doing, or care about suffering.

The source of your question is apparently what you heard in class, which didn't seem to have given you enough information to even start making a coherent argument on the subject matter. After not getting results you start demanding people to explain biology to you. Look, this is a debate forum. If you debate, you're expected to know something on the subject you've chosen.

Saying our arguments are bad because we downvote is a red herring, and it doesn't lend to your arguments at all. As well anyone can accept a possibility that a deity exists, just like I can accept that a possibility exists that things like flying hyper intelligent fecal matter exists in the universe. The problem is that it doesn't make it likely."
DebateAnAtheist,3cxydh,Mr_bananasham,2,Sun Jul 12 02:31:40 2015 UTC,"no, its not possible.   the supernatural is impossible by definition, you your question is a bit like asking 'is it possible that an impossible thing is so?'."
DebateAnAtheist,3cxydh,indurateape,2,Sun Jul 12 03:15:23 2015 UTC,"Atheists are not the ones claiming to know everything, in fact the whole reason there is a lack of belief in the claims made for the existence of god/s is because those claims are made without any rational reasons.     Religious people think they know all the answers and they those answers come from their perspective religious books.     Furthermore, the argument you are posing here is at best an argument for a deist god, however you are most likely coming from a specific religion's perspective. So, in order for me to not assume, can you please define what you mean by god, or describe which god concept you believe in.?"

Knowledge is information held in people's brains. Are you claiming that someone out there has absolute, demonstrable information in regards to God creating the universe? That would be quite amazing.  Is it possible, given the gaps of human knowledge and lots of weird unknowns, that a God exists? Sure. Is it your God? Well by your rules it's equally possible that an infinite number of other Gods exist, as well as an infinite number of other possibilities (teams of Gods, binary God/AntiGods, we live on the toenail of a dying God). So the chances of your God being the right one are infinitely small.  Tell you what, I'll concede that something created this universe for the sake of argument. Now provide me any known quality of that creative force and support your assertion with evidence.   Il probably be downvoted to oblivion   Yes you will, because this argument is old and poorly formed and you aren't debating, you're insisting reality is just so because you say so and using troll language."

Pretty much first part  The creed I am Roman Catholic shows why I am not a protestant  I believe in God, the Father Almighty, Creator of Heaven and earth; and in Jesus Christ, His only Son Our Lord, Who was conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried. He descended into Hell; the third day He rose again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God, the Father almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead.

Good question He clearly does not live here in this Universe much like a admin does not live a his video Game.

Then you are not an atheist.  It's that simple.   Agnostics are not atheists. Atheists have in fact lied to you about the definition of atheism.   You should question why atheists must lie about the definition of atheism hoping to hide atheism behind agnosticism in order to shirk any intellectual burden to justify atheism for what it actually is - a belief position that disbelieves / denies  God's existence.   That SEoP, Websters and OEM are highly peer-reviewed.   They don't lie.   Internet atheists lied to you."

It doesn't not mean to hold a positive belief that something doesn't exist. It means not to hold a positive belief that something exists.  SEoP   No official position, just a paper written in 2004 by the utilitarian philosopher J J C Smart, about why agnostic is a better term than atheism from the PoV of a philosopher. It closes with ""Still, these considerations are perhaps more a matter for sociologists than for philosophers."" Admitting that he doesn't have the final say in this debate. Additionally he starts with two false premises: ""‘Atheism’ means the negation of theism, the denial of the existence of God. I shall here assume that the God in question is that of a sophisticated monotheism."" Of which, neither are true and no sources are quoted for those assumptions on which the rest of the arguments rest.

I don't have no belief about whether you are telling me the truth.  The two peer-reviewed citations all affirm my position.  JCC Smart is rather stupid for a philosopher.

I used your sources which, you claim in every post you make, are never wrong because they are so highly peer reviewed. How can that be wrong? They clearly state that disbelief is a lack of faith or a lack of belief. It is not an opposite belief. You can interpret them another way, I guess, but the words are very clear.  For your example. We are both in a sealed room underground. You have no way to sense anything on the surface, in person or remotely. I tell you that it is raining on the surface. Your two choices are to (a) believe me, or (b) disbelieve me. In the first case, you believe I am truthful, and my truth is that it is raining. In the second case, you disbelieve I am truthful; I am lying to you because I have no way to see if it is raining or not. You doubt me, saying it is unknowable whether or not it is raining. It could be snowing, it could be hailing, it could be bright and sunshiny. It doesn't matter what the truth is, it only matters that you don't believe me.   I do NOT lack a belief about whether or not it is raining.   Yes, you do. In this example, you could believe that gold coins are falling from the sky should you want to, but that has no bearing on your disbelief of my claim that it is raining. You either believe me, or you don't. You can have other alternate beliefs, but that doesn't affect your dis-belief of my claim.  Go look up, in your dictionary of choice, the prefix of ""dis-"". For instance:   dis- 1. a Latin prefix meaning “apart,” “asunder,” “away,” “utterly,” or having a privative, negative, or reversing force   JCC Smart is your source from SEoP. Look for another mention of atheism on that site and you won't find any. Here is the table of contents for the site. If there is something else, you should link directly to it in the future, rather than just generically quoting ""SEP"" all the time.  OED is behind a paywall.

Dictionaries don't actually, literally define the words that people use in daily life - people do.  And this is especially true when people are using those words to describe themselves.    I'm agnostic, in that I don't think that anyone can truly be sure about the existence or non-existence of your god.  I'm also an atheist, in that I have never been convinced that it exists and thus don't consider it real.  So I'm an agnostic atheist, aren't I?  What's your beef?  Is my self-assessment not accurate?    Generally speaking, I classify myself as an atheist.  The only reason ever feel like I have to add the ""agnostic"" on there, is when theistic people demand to know what ""proof"" I have that their stupid stories aren't true.    I don't need proof to somehow justify my position.  When faced with a shitty argument, I don't need to ""prove"" the opposite of what the shitty argument is proposing.  Tell me again about Noah's fucking ark, and I'll tell you about the bad-luck goblin that lives in my bum.    You follow?  I don't think your god exists.  Not because I have evidence or proof that it doesn't, but merely because I've never had any reason to believe this ridiculous shit in the first place.    And that's the same, starting, default position of every human.  Sadly, as soon as kids can talk and understand their parents, the parents often fill their heads with fantastic stories, and the kids grow up thinking that other people need to ""disprove"" the garbage.

DebateAnAtheist,3ckorm,TruthMatterz2,2,Thu Jul 9 16:40:46 2015 UTC,"Again, you're convinced that there's no ambiguity in your precious dictionary definitions, but you're wrong.  And again, even if you're right about what this or that dictionary says, WHO CARES?  Put down your ""peer reviewed"" dictionary.  Dictionaries don't always go into enough detail, they don't always agree, and people use words without always reading your favourite dictionary before speaking.  Listen to what people are actually saying rather than trying to bash them with your precious, golden ""real Oxford dictionary"", and maybe you'll actually get somewhere.   Atheists are not entitled to dishonestly hide atheism behind agnosticism  in order to shirk their intellectual burden. If they try this dishonest tactic,  I am going to nail their lying asses to the wall. Liars for atheism don't  get a free pass from me. Got it? Good.   Drop your desperate ""liars"" thing, these people are making an honest attempt to describe themselves, as am I.  There's nothing dishonest about it at all.  We're using ""agnosticism"" to describe our lack of knowledge, and ""atheism"" to describe our lack of belief.    There really, truly are ""hard atheists"" out there (gnostic atheists) who affirmatively, truly think that they can be certain that your god doesn't exist.  But most of us atheists aren't like that.  The vast, vast majority are more like me:  we don't believe your ridiculous god stories, but we don't claim to have absolute knowledge that your god doesn't exist, either.  We don't think it's possible to prove either way, but we also don't believe the mythology.   Well there you go. You have been taught to lie. You attach agnostic to atheism to shirk your intellectual burden because atheism is intellectually  weak, so you hide atheism behind agnostic when asked to justify atheism.  That's dishonest and intellectually lazy.   Again, my position isn't dishonest at all.  In casual, typical conversation, I'll categorize myself as an atheist, because I don't believe in your god and there's nothing theistic about me or my life in the slightest... so it's easy to describe myself as a-theistic.  But that's casual conversation, where a bit of laziness does apply.    When I get deep into the swamps of a debate with some theist who wants to know exactly where I stand, then I have to be more precise.  In these cases, describing myself as an ""agnostic atheist"" is less lazy, and far more accurate than plain old ""atheist"".    But maybe your beloved ""real Oxford"" dictionary doesn't agree?  Fine.  How about I spell out my position and you tell me what YOU think I should call myself?  Note that I'll call myself whatever the hell I want, but I'm interested to know what you think the ""right"" label would be:  1)  I was born with no concept of your god, and have never heard any evidence that would make me think he exists.  So I have an utter lack of belief in it.  Rather atheistic of me.  2)  I also think that I can't prove that your god doesn't exist any more than you can prove it does.  I think it's unprovable either way, and that there's no way to be absolutely certain.  Rather agnostic of me.  So Mr. Dictionary, what do you think I should call myself?  ""Atheist"" doesn't seem quite accurate, because it doesn't differentiate me from the ""hard atheists"" who think they have proof positive your god doesn't exist.  And ""agnostic"" doesn't seem accurate, because I'm not someone who simply takes a neutral position on the god debate at all.  I really do think the stories about him are utter garbage, and I reject them all, which leaves me with the null hypothesis I was born with.  So the truth is, I am both atheistic and agnostic.  Agnostic atheist is a reasonably good way to describe myself, and untold millions of people just like me.  If you don't like it you can either suggest a new label and see if people take it up... or go fuck yourself.   Further, you don't even understand what separates atheism from theism. Rejecting a particular religious epistemology about God doesn't make one an atheist. Atheism is a denial / disbelief position on God, not a  particular religion.   I know damn well what separates the two.  I reject the story of noah's ark, and I reject all similarly ludicrous mythology.  I reject claims about your preferred, favourite personal god, and I reject claims about all the other gods that I've ever heard about.  Not just your god, all of them.    Look, if I ask you if you believe in leprechauns, do you say ""no""?  Or do you follow your precious dictionary and say that you're ""agnostic"" about leprechauns?  No, you say ""I don't believe in leprechauns"", even though you know that you can't conclusively prove that they don't exist.  Same for me and your stupid stories, it boggles my mind that there are people who believe that shit."

DebateAnAtheist,3ckorm,Zeydon,1 point,Wed Jul 8 18:22:36 2015 UTC,"Since both of those involve committing to a belief, the other option is that of a neutral party, waiting for sufficient reason to adopt one of the beliefs.

DebateAnAtheist,3ckorm,winto_bungle,6,Wed Jul 8 18:24:09 2015 UTC,"I can see the confusion of two different arguments here.  You either believe in a deity/s or you do not.  That is binary.  The second argument is that you either believe that deity/s could exist, subject to evidence being available (or not).  That too is binary.  However the combinations available now are that you believe that deity/s can and do exist, or that deity/s can technically exist, but do not exist due to lack of evidence, or that deity/s can not and do not exist and that is the discussion you should be having... I think.   This leaves in my opinion the only viable option, which is that of course there could be a cosmic deity or floating tea pot out there, but that is not evidence of its existence.  Leaving the door open to any and all possibilities to be considered is rational, as long as each case is accepted on the merits of it's evidence.   Edit: Grammar."

Whether you actively believe there are no gods, or disbelieve the claim about gods existing.

You either actively belief something exists or you don't.  It is not a choice though, you don't chose a position. You are either convinced or not.  Even if you don't know the claim, you are atheist.

There are people who take the position of not asserting either one (this is what the term 'agnostic' is for), apparently quite a few. Of course, not everyone agrees that that position is epistemologically justifiable.   Looks like I misunderstood the guy's original assertion, found here:    Believing in a god or believing in no gods are not the only options   What???? I thought atheism/theism was binary. You either believe it or you do not.    There's a phenomenon on this sub, and in many online atheist communities, where the term 'atheist' is extended to include those who make no assertion either way, on the basis that they aren't, well, theists. Under that system of terminology, atheism/theism does cover the entire spectrum, by virtue of not precisely representing the 'believe in deities' and 'believe there are no deities' categories.  However, the narrower definition of 'atheism' (specifically the belief that there are no deities) is the historically established one, and the most commonly understood in academia and by most people outside of online atheist communities. See here for a detailed exposition on this issue."

We live in societies in which religion has exercised so much thought control for centuries/millenia, and it's time that we start to say that not only do we not have to be religious, we don't even have to hold any position on religion at all.   If a crazy person accosts me in the street and demands to know whether I believe in the aliens that are sticking wires in his brain, I don't give an answer and I certainly don't attempt to justify it, I just walk away from him. This is how we should approach religion: you don't need to explain yourself to the religious, you don't need to legitimise their views by developing your own position on the subject, just ignore their anachronistic delusions altogether and get on with life on whatever terms suit you."

In other words, you aren't achieving anything of any worth in this debate, since your result, 'how these words are defined by me' won't translate into the next group of people where you use them.

Now, I'm going to assert two things to you that I promise you are true. I do have a child. And one of the remaining claims is true and one is false.   So, do you accept or reject that my child is a boy?  The bottom line is you have no reason to accept or reject this claim. The one thing you might have done is chosen to trust me because why wouldn't you, but I have you a reason to have equal parts suspicion and trust about my claims.

This does not require you to believe something is untrue that is a separate proposal that also requires information.   In the example of your mate with the alleged three nipples. I have no evidence to demonstrate that it is true. So I don't believe you. I also have no evidence you're lying so I do not believe it isn't possible. I am simply undecided.

The prefix ""a"" can be an opposite, but it really just denotes a negation. Strong atheism is the commitment to the belief that gods do not exist. Weak atheism on the other hand, is not a conclusion, it's just a lack of acceptance that any one particular god exists, pending sufficient evidence. Committing to a belief, in my view, involves a burden of proof. I'm not interested in proving that all gods are false, just evaluating the claims of various religions as they are presented. I hold this position because I am also agnostic.  Secondly, there's not just one god, there are literally thousands of gods that have been invented, which greatly complicates the issue. When I was a believer, my religious leaders often tried to reduce atheism to the claim ""God does not exist,"" which is specifically dependent on the notion that there's only one god. Once I realized that there were actually LOTS of gods that were all largely implausible, I looked harder at what atheism actually meant."

I would have to say that if the counter assertion was proposed (and that I was opposed to it instead).  In your scenario there are only two possibilities. The ball count is even, or the ball count is odd (much like the question on the existence of gods). Once presented with the knowledge that the answer is definite (and limited to even or odd), I contend that it's impossible for you to not form a belief (assuming we're not debating the epistemological definition of belief vs. opinion).   So making the statement ""I don't believe the number is even"" is equivalent to stating ""I believe the number is odd"" and in our case making the statement ""I don't believe that any gods exist"" is equivalent to stating ""I believe that no gods exist"".

I would have to say that if the counter assertion was proposed (and that I was opposed to it instead).   Ok, technically only one proposition was made. I didn't think it would be necessary to explicitly mention the counter assertion, because it seemed self-evident that you would consider it implicitly.  So if I ask ""Is the number odd?"", you respond ""I believe the number is not odd"". If I then also ask ""Is the number even?"", you respond ""I believe the number is not even"". I've forced you to make two contradictory statements, and it was trivially easy to do so.  This suggests that your logic is faulty. It seems like the belief which you espouse is entirely determined by which proposition is made first. This is entirely arbitrary. And in fact it seems inconceivable to me that you wouldn't internally consider the opposing proposition when presented with one of them, and come to the conclusion that you cannot determine which is correct. Otherwise I can force you to believe all sorts of things with no basis whatsoever, simply by making unfounded assertions.   Once presented with the knowledge that the answer is definite (and limited to even or odd), I contend that it's impossible for you to not form a belief   If I'm fully aware that the information available to me provides no way of evaluating which alternative (even/odd) is true, then it would be foolish to form a belief. I know that I don't know if the number is even or odd.   I'll ask again; what are the practical differences in those statements?   The difference is that they literally mean different things. ""I believe the number is odd"" is equivalent to ""I believe the number is not even"". But neither statement is equivalent to ""I don't believe the number is even"".  The difference is that stating ""I believe the number is not even"" is effectively adopting a positive belief (that the number is odd), despite having absolutely no basis for this belief, and in fact being fully aware that it is equally likely to be untrue. It is nonsensical."

There is nothing wrong with maintaining your countries traditions in whatever form so long as the only reason is not just because you always did it that way when there are other arguments against it.  Not all traditions may survive being separated from the religion that created them.  Not all of them maybe should.  But yes you can secularize them.

I've taught at Catholic school and heard the insane unscientific lies made about sex and contraception, passed off by people calling themselves doctors. Most Catholics don't believe it, but the Church does and that results in die-hards teaching it to kids. Catholicism is less unscientific than some evangelical groups, but that's not the same as accepting scientific claims based on evidence, rather than convenience."

Does getting married in a church impede education or harm your sister? No- it's a nice tradition that was the couple's choice. Genital mutilation or teaching creationism in school?

I think things are changing. I go to more secular weddings than church weddings now. I don't know many parents who have bothered to christen their children. However, try to find a secular funeral anywhere and you'll struggle, mainly because when someone dies their family would still rather hear ""he's gone to a better place"" then ""he's worm food now"".  The monopoly that the church held over all the rites of passage, and most community spirit, is gradually loosening. Someone tried to set up an 'Atheist Church' in London a little while back; it got lots of derisory piss-taking from the religious but I thought that was a really good idea. It was aimed at bringing people together on a Sunday morning to do things like charitable work, getting an interesting lecture from an academic, and a bit of general community spirit, basically all the kind of things that might make you a better person and your community a happier place to live but without any belief in fairy tales required. I wonder if we'll see more things like that springing up.   I don't think religion will ever disappear, but I think it will soon be seen in the same way we see e.g. Norse, Greek or Roman gods - ancient mythology that is interesting from a historical perspective but nothing more than that.

DebateAnAtheist,3cg47h,August3,1 point,Tue Jul 7 18:10:47 2015 UTC,"Where do you draw the line between religion and culture?   Religion is a part of culture, but I think the cut-off is the point where people are performing rituals because of religious beliefs. It's the difference between getting married in church because you think that's the only way to have a real marriage in the eyes of God and getting married in a church because churches are pretty. The lines blur a bit, for example, you could get married in a church not believing any of it, but the priests (and probably some of the guests) do, making the whole thing religious.   And can those of us from deeply religious countries (in the past) keep our cultural traditions without the religious part?   Sure. It's not always easy, because there aren't a lot of secular rituals with a century-old lineage. I also live in Belgium. I haven't gone to a lot of weddings, but all the weddings I went to were secular. They also had rituals, rites and incantations, but those just weren't based on religious beliefs. They still borrowed a bit of the iconography and tradition in order to keep it grokkable for everyone. For my wedding, I plan on creating my own rituals. Ultimately, it's the rituals that are important to people at moments like this. It doesn't really matter where those rituals come from.   tl;dr I don't believe in god, but I also don't want to throw away hundreds of years of history because part of it has religious undertones.   This is something you need to decide for yourself. Personally, I don't see any value in keeping any religious traditions, just because it's part of history. Being part of history isn't always a good indicator for value, especially not when it comes to actions and beliefs. The history of my village is one of Nazi-collaboration. Not really a history worth keeping. For me, it's the same with religious history: not worth keeping.  But it's really up to you. If you do see some value in it, and are willing to provide credibility to an institution like the Catholic church, you should do it."

These traditions are part of what kept them going, part of how they made enough sense of the world to raise a family and prosper.  Personally I don't need those traditions to thrive, and I don't think they reflect reality.  I don't think ""luck"" is real, good or bad, I don't think whoever catches the flowers will necessarily be the next to get married, and I don't think the farmers and factory workers hear me when I whisper gratitude to them before eating.

I mean let's talk about gravity for a second, we have the laws that show how gravity works with the G constant (which is never really constant) and everything, we have the elastic 2D space to visualize gravity but we still cannot explain why gravity is happening. Can you truly explain why one particle is attracted to another particle ? can you explain why a proton is attracted to an electron ? Of course this is not enough of a statement for God, but all of our sciences have focused on only observational science, with this path no matter how deep our research might get in the future we can never explain why gravity is happening only how it happens and nothing more. Science never seems to tackle the why of it all only the how.  At the same time I can't help but feel that gravity is a force of creative love, the love of the earth keeps us on the ground, the love of the sun keeps the solar system in place and even the love of the black hole in the center of the milky way is holding everything together, the love between a proton and an electron holding atoms and the fabric of reality together. I apologize if I am sounding too romantic but I just see all of these forces being conscious forces of will for creation. And in all of that somehow life became complex enough to ask where it came from, I just cannot logically believe that all of this happened by random chance. But I understand that it all boils down to evidence."
DebateAnAtheist,3ck0re,develdevil,15,Wed Jul 8 16:07:41 2015 UTC,....Humanity didn't exist for 13 billions years. Get out of here.
DebateAnAtheist,3ck0re,Almostcomatose,15,Wed Jul 8 16:08:26 2015 UTC,"Because I can't help but feel that all of these laws were specifically placed to help humanity   Ever heard the analogy of a pool of water. It looks at the ground around it and says ""wow, this ground fits me perfectly! It must have been created just for me"" when in reality the pool of water would fit any shape hole ""perfectly"" as that is the nature of water.   Humanity is the same. We evolved in an environment with gravity as a constant. Thus, we adapted perfectly (sort of) to an environment with gravity in it. Just because you feel these laws are in place to help humanity does not provide even a shred of evidence that they ARE. Beliefs are not evidence. And in fact, all evidence points toward the fact that WE adapted to the laws, not that the laws were created for us.  No, nobody can explain why gravity happens (in terms of why mass pulls other mass toward it). However, if it were any other way, or if gravity pulled harder or easier than it does, than our universe could be drastically different, and we may be drastically different as well. However, if we were still sentient we would be sitting here debating whether gravity, which in that reality pushes, rather than pulls, is so perfectly suited to us.   Sure, we can't tackle the ""why"", and only the how. But then claiming a conscious mind behind the universe is a HUGE leap from that. Perhaps the more ""how"" we discover, the closer we will get to understanding ""why"". How can you be certain that after fully underrstanding ""how"" we won't arrive at a point where the why behind it all becomes clear? However, I do not believe there ""has to be"" a why. The universe just IS the way it is because that is the exact set of circumstances created by the big bang. It is one reason I find infinite multiverses interesting. Perhaps there is a multiverse out there with EVERY possible combination of physical constants creating entirely different universes. There is no mandatory need for a purposeful reason behind the laws of physics other than as comfort for humanity, who struggles to accept that we are not divinely inspired creatures. We are simply highly evolved animals.    At the same time I can't help but feel that gravity is a force of creative love   Except that gravity can be one of the most destructive forces in the universe. It an literally trap LIGHT. (A black hole, which you claimed is holding the galaxy together out of love). It can pull in, and crush down to a singularity everything in the universe. Literally nothing is more destructive than that. However, that is beside the point, and only meant to illustrate. You are claiming that things like strong and weak nuclear forces are forces of ""love"" because our language and culture has evolved to believe that things being close together is a sign of love. Those actions predated our language or culture or even sentient nature. They do not have any conscious mind behind them (that can be proven) and just ARE.    I apologize if I am sounding too romantic    I actually HIGHLY recommend you read anything by Michael Dowd. I do not think you are being ""too romantic"". I just think your romantic language and way of looking at the universe could use a few tweaks. He would agree with you that the black hole holding our galaxy together is ""love"" and that the whole universe is ""god"". However, he does not agree with the conscious aspect. He considers the language you are using to be a poetic way of explaining naturalism. You could say he is a religious naturalist, and I think you would highly enjoy his work.   And in all of that somehow life became complex enough to ask where it came from, I just cannot logically believe that all of this happened by random chance.   The key here is that you cannot believe it, not because the evidence points elsewhere, but because you, as a human, refuse to accept that the universe just IS and that you are not special, divinely inspired, and that the universe was not created just for you. That is known as anthropocentricism. I personally believe it is possibly the most absurd belief possible. ALL evidence points toward the fact that humanity is, rather than the center of the universe, one single animal on a single planet in a single solar system, in a single galaxy of a nearly infinite universe. We are so far AWAY from the center of the universe that it is amazing to me that anyone can hold a belief that the universe was created just for us.  I am not trying to offend. Truly, I understand the romantic language that you want to apply to the universe, and I understand the human nature of not wanting to admit our own insignificance. I hear what you are saying, and I simply want to point out that when you boil down your claims, you deepest, most central reason for believing, which everything else hinges on, is that you simply don't want to believe we are all just here by chance. I understand that desire not to believe that, but I simply think it is wrong.

This misunderstanding is one of the reason this term is rarely used in science nowadays, at least not formally.  The universe exists. Everything that exists forms patterns - how it exists, how it changes, how it interacts. Even chaos has patterns, or it wouldn't be chaos. Those patterns aren't ""things"", they are simply the ways things are. When we do science and examine the universe - in whichever form or way we choose - we can find these patterns and describe them. Those descriptions are colloquially called ""laws of nature"".  Now, you might ask, could there exist something that does not form a pattern? I don't know. That could be one definition of supernatural - that which does not form patterns. It doesn't sound like a coherent statement, though, but maybe I will be shown wrong one day."

This is your personal opinion and cannot be substantiated. In fact it can be countered, as we at least know that these laws (perhaps 'descriptions of nature' would be a better term) exist, but we have little reason to believe that God does.

I believe that God is literally everything, every particle, every force, every person. Gravity ? God, quantum forces ? God, Evolution ? God   You're basically describing the universe. Since we already have a word for that, why are you substituting a different word that carries so much baggage with it? Why not just call it the universe and reality? There's no need for a god label and I can see later on you're using an equivocation fallacy by using the god term in different ways than how you defined it above.    God is a much more plausible theory than the multiverse theory.   Well if god is how you defined it above, then ""god"" and the multiverse theory are not in conflict and are virtually one and the same. You're trying to use two different definitions of the term ""god"" and it's blatantly dishonest of you.   such complex structures like purposeful human consciousness can ever be created by the random chance of the multiverse theory through countless cycles, it's is just statistically impossible.   Here we have another problem. You're implying that human consciousness is ""purposeful"" when you haven't proven that. You keep tossing around the term ""random chance"" without justification, and you clearly have no clue now statistics work.   When I see all of the forces holding reality in place to such an extent as to create creative life forms    These forces aren't holding reality together, they ARE reality. And again, you're implying we were created without evidence or proof. Prove that we were created.  I as a logical person cannot ever expect that all of these forces are by random chance, using Occam's Razor God is a more plausible option.   No, you're not a logical person. Not with the mess you vomited up in your post. You make assertion after assertion with no evidence to back anything up. You dishonestly equivocate several terms such as ""god"" and ""random chance"", and now you're using ""occam's razor god"" in a completely different way than how you defined ""god"" earlier.   Either stick with a single clear definition of what you mean by ""god"" or go home. You have no business debating with such dishonesty like this.   This is just basically the whole story about scientists having a man making competition with God saying that they don't need him anymore and that they themselves can create man on their own, and God owns them by telling them to use their own clay for making man.   Once again, you're dishonestly using multiple definitions of ""god"". Earlier you defined god as all that is, now you're defining god as a distinct and separate entity. So which is it?

The phrases ""lost years of Jesus"" is usually encountered in esoteric literature (where it at times also refers to his possible post-crucifixion activities) but is not commonly used in scholarly literature since it is assumed that Jesus was probably working as a carpenter in Galilee from the age of twelve till thirty, so the years were not ""lost years"", and that he died in Calvary.     In the late medieval period, Arthurian legends appeared that the young Jesus had been in Britain.  In the 19th and 20th centuries theories began to emerge that between the ages of 12 and 30 Jesus had visited India, or had studied with the Essenes in the Judea desert.   Modern mainstream Christian scholarship has generally rejected these theories and holds that nothing is known about this time period in the life of Jesus.      The use of the ""lost years"" in the ""swoon hypothesis"", suggests that Jesus survived his crucifixion and continued his life.  This, and the related view that he avoided crucifixion altogether, has given rise to several speculations about what happened to him in the supposed remaining years of his life, but these are generally not accepted by mainstream scholars.

The resulting chaos occurs as the remaning residual order interacts with itself in a haphazard way until it reaches equilibrium where all order is lost.   How exactly are you defining order and chaos?   One would have to naturally assume that the universe started from this state of complete lawlessness.    Why would we assume this?  In fact, even you don't assume this,    Without these rules the sand particles should simply disperse into the void of space   The fact that there's spacetime present, and the fact that you predict the sand will behave in a certain way in a given situation, means that there are some 'laws' present (even if they aren't exactly the ones in our universe).   How can these forces ever rise from chaos by random chance ?   Who said anything about random chance? Maybe this is the only way they can be. We don't really know enough to say if the laws of the universe could have been any different.   I'd first like to paint a proper picture of how I believe in God because I'm a Hindu and not Christian, I believe that God is literally everything, every particle, every force, every person. Gravity ? God, quantum forces ? God, Evolution ? God, every single force of order that exists in the universe is a conscious application of God, the order within the Chaos that holds everything together.   Don't all of your earlier objections still apply to this idea of god? How did this god come about by 'random chance'? What laws govern this god? What's the statistical probability of god's existence?   This is just basically the whole story about scientists having a man making competition with God saying that they don't need him anymore and that they themselves can create man on their own, and God owns them by telling them to use their own clay for making man.   If only god communicated so clearly as to speak directly to people who challenged him.   You cannot use God's own rules and disprove him   Oh great, an escape hatch you can use to ignore anything we say  TL;DR The questions of 'why is there something rather than nothing' or more precisely 'why is reality the way it is, and not some other way i can imagine it being' are not answered or resolved by inserting a god. So I don't see how pointing out that the universe is highly unlikely (or, more precisely, that you can't imagine it without god), leads one to belief in a god."

The scientific method dictates that nothing can be proved to be absolutely true; and we see examples of that all the time. We discovered atoms, and subatomic particles, and quantum physics, all of which were completely unheard of 100 years ago.  I accept that God has a potential to exist. But until there is evidence to support it, I must assume for the time being that he doesn't.  God's absence is the null hypothesis. I can validate it and support it, but I cannot prove it absolutely true. But again, there is no evidence to the contrary so it is the best theory I have so far."

Do we only class an idea as real if it can be physically realised....what then of abstract concepts?   Gods are real ideas, and abstract concepts. All the different gods are, as are comic book characters and imaginary friends. When we say something doesn't exist, we mean other than as an idea. Atheists have no problem with gods as ideas in people's heads, its existence independent from that which is relevant.    the line between objective reality, and our own perceptions is not clearly defined or agreed upon (if a tree falls in the woods...) If we cannot be sure where the self ends...how can we be sure that what is held to be true in the self...is not reflected on reality?   It's hard, but possible. Science, logic and then search for truth and reality are a process with a history of getting results. Solipsism exists, we never have absolute certainty. But there's still a difference between pursuing truth based on skepticism and observation, and delusions made up at a whim.

DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,Being_and_Thyme,6,Mon Jul 6 17:55:03 2015 UTC,"No. Lots of people believing something doesn't make it evidenced. That happens with false beliefs all the time.   I think we should be a bit more specific here, because that someone has a false belief doesn't mean they didn't have evidence for it. It just means the evidence has turned out to be false. There was a pretty good write up on this issue in /r/debatereligion recently found here, in which it is argued that a private experience counts as evidence in the face of epistemic defeaters.  We might be hesitant to think that my private experience of a leprechaun, for example, counts as evidence for leprechauns, but when we consider that there are potentially a vast amount of epistemic defeaters for my belief in leprechauns, we can safely suggest that my private experience does count as evidence but then my belief in them is quickly rendered false in the face of those epistemic defeaters. There are additional reasons why we would also find such a private experience at least unconvincing, such as the justified attachment of low probability to there being leprechauns."
DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,chaingunXD,7,Mon Jul 6 20:12:50 2015 UTC,The caveat bring that your experience only counts as evidence for yourself. It can't be used as evidence to convince others unless it can be independently verified.
DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,Being_and_Thyme,0,Tue Jul 7 07:29:57 2015 UTC,"Well, we need to unpack a few things here. Firstly, evidence is evidence regardless of whether you find it unconvincing or not--and depending on the situation, it may may require a low amount of evidence to be convincing because the epistemic hurdle simply isn't that high or we are not that demanding of high amounts of evidence.  The second thing to note is that it doesn't seem to be the case that my experience always only counts as evidence for myself. A very general example: I saw a postbox at the end of my street. I would say you now have evidence for the proposition that there is a postbox at the end of my street based off my testimony and without needing to go down the street. The postbox could even be removed so that my testimony turns out to be false, but you'd still have evidence based off my testimony.  Now obviously there are many relevant differences between my seeing a postbox at the end of my street and what we take to be involved in the experience of God that some theists say they have. But supposedly you could also have an experience of God the way the theist did, and offer testimony on the matter, which seems to make it evidence not merely for yourself but also me when I say that my friend has had such-and-such an experience."

Yes, but a lack of EXPECTED evidence is also evidence in a way.  For example: If I tell you that a giant hurricane devastated your city last night you would expect to see lots of signs of that: ruined houses, eye-witnesses, deaths, a mention of that on CNN etc.  If instead you look outside and everything is fine and all is well and no one saw anything (aka a ""lack of evidence"") then surely you would seriously doubt my hurricane-story since it doesn't make any sense?  Likewise the existence of ""God"" and his miracles would surely leave lots of evidence behind if it were true? So why can't we find any? Isn't that not a clear sign that something about that story doesn't make sense?   If 'God' only exists in the minds and/or hearts of the faithful, does that make it any less real? if not why not? Do we only class an idea as real if it can be physically realised....what then of abstract concepts?   Abstract concepts aren't real. They are, by definition, abstract.

Do we only class an idea as real if it can be physically realised....what then of abstract concepts?   Concepts exist to describe the real world. Things like ""justice"" or ""beauty"" can be attributes of real things -- like a court case or a painting. A concept that seems to have absolutely no bearing on the real world (like unicorns or God) doesn't even qualify as an abstract concept. At best it's a fantasy, but I don't think anyone would argue fantasies should govern our reality.   If we cannot be sure where the self ends...how can we be sure that what is held to be true in the self...is not reflected on reality?   This is pretty close to solipsism.

Of course there is.   one could argue that the existence of faith in the minds of so many, and the belief of those who feel they have somehow witnessed the devine (be it in the form of a miracle or apperition etc) is almost a kind of meta-evidence   There's nothing 'meta' about it. And it's also very weak evidence, given that one, those people have equally strong faith in many different mutually contradictory deities, and two, a real deity who wanted people to have faith in him wouldn't create a universe where faith is so utterly epistemologically useless.   If 'God' only exists in the minds and/or hearts of the faithful   That's misleading terminology. God (as far as we know) doesn't exist at all, inside people's minds or anywhere else. What there is inside people's minds are ideas, and some of those ideas are about deities, but none of them are deities.   Do we only class an idea as real if it can be physically realised....what then of abstract concepts?   Deities aren't 'abstract concepts'. This line of argument just doesn't apply.   how can we be sure that what is held to be true in the self...is not reflected on reality?   Because a lot of the time it blatantly isn't. If I believe there's a pile of gold bricks under my bed, and then go look under my bed, I won't find any gold bricks. It is up to us to arrange our beliefs to accurately reflect reality. If we don't do that, we just end up being wrong; reality does not bend itself to more closely match whatever nonsense we decided to believe."

The fallacy of argumentum ad populum -- that an argument has weight based on its popularity.  Many people believe that the Moon is larger when it's nearer the horizon, that you can balance an egg during the equinox, that vaccines are dangerous, etc. These are all ""popular"" ideas that do not have a preponderance of evidence in their favor, and indeed have evidence against them.

If we cannot be sure where the self ends...how can we be sure that what is held to be true in the self...is not reflected on reality?   Epistemology is a deep and interesting subject-- to people other than me. I find it uninteresting to a large extent. We experience the reality that we experience.

When evidence would be expected it's perfectly reasonable to say that it's evidence against the claim being made.

A murder could have happened, it's possible, but that's not a reasonable belief without evidence.  The same applies to god claims.  There is no verifiable evidence for any god's existence, especially gods that are claimed to interact with the world.  Based on this it's reasonable to tentatively conclude that no such god exists.

Of course, peanuts are still more probable than a wide variety of other items which, in my experience, are less commonly found and less often held in hands.

When people say that a thing exists they mean that it has objective being, other people can verify the being of an existing thing. A God who cannot be reasoned about cannot be verified since reason is the tool we use to verify things. As for the implications of such a God being a real thing, why would anybody care? How would the actions of this God be discerned from the result of a craps shoot? If the actions of God carry some characteristic which let us separate them from a purely chaotic system then God can be reasoned about meaning that your definition is faulty. On the other hand if the actions of God are truly above our capability to reason then a purely random output would not be discernable from God and so by claiming God is real you're really just renaming randomness."

Just like there is no evidence for homeopathy or leylines or zodiac signs or reading of tea leaves or bending spoons through your mind. I don't need faith to discount any of these things as there is no evidence for their existence or veracity (despite people trying).   You said that it's ""impossible to disprove something that is above understanding"". If it was, how do you claim to know that said thing, which is supposedly above understanding, can be understood enough to write books about it and teach its ""wisdom""? For that matter, how can you make any statements about this supposed thing or about its existence or nonexistence or nature at all, since it is, by your own statement, above understanding? Because despite being ""above understanding"", the bible and theologians make quite a few very specific claims about ""god"", its nature and its intentions and expectations.  Where does this leave us? The only ""evidence"" we have is what a number of people wrote over the course of a few millenia, who managed to convince others that what they wrote (or told) was the word of some incomprehensible higher being they needed to observe or they would be punished in an unspeakably horrible way, and that said higher being said they should behave in a way that benefits society, and maybe themselves (the people who told these teachings) even a little more than society at large. They also managed to convince people that they can't challenge these teachings because they were unable to understand where they came from and why they were there, and so they shouldn't even try. There's a term for the ability to do all that: Social Engineering.  Either way, there is no proof, and non-proof of arbitrary claims isn't anything that gives me any headaches.

DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,chrissystardust,3,Mon Jul 6 22:23:19 2015 UTC,"I think you need a quick lesson in epistemology--the philosophy of knowledge.  Epistemologically speaking, knowledge is not certainty.  In fact, it's far from certainty.  Knowledge is justified belief.  And a belief can be justified for many reasons...but generally, we want our beliefs to be rationally justified.  Now, when is a belief rationally justified?  When it follows the following pattern...  1) Take the things you think you know...  2) Do something with them...  3) Arrive at a conclusion.  Now, if #1 and #2 are complete, correct, and valid, then #3 will be rationally justified.  And you can add #3 to the list of things you think you know for some future belief.  That's how knowledge builds.  Likewise, if either #1 or #2 is not complete, correct, or valid, it doesn't mean that you're wrong...it just means that your belief is not rationally justified.    Now if we can build knowledge in the way I described above, it also follows that we can deconstruct beliefs as well...be pulling apart each #1 into its constituent parts.  And here is where you may bring up the problem of infinite regress.  Can we do this infinitely?  No.  We will eventually hit some bedrock of self-evidence.  Things that you and I can verify using our own senses.  But what does this all have to do with faith?  Well, let me tell you...  There's WAAAAAY too much for people to verify for themselves, that sometimes we place our trust in the observations and work of others who have proven themselves worthy of that trust--an authority.  But there's a catch.  If an authority proves himself or herself (or Himself) to be suspect, that authority is rescinded.    And here is the problem with your question.  Because ""faith"" in its classical definition depends on verifiable authority...and because religious faith depends on God's irreproachable authority, despite the many refutations of biblical claims and immoral stories within the bible, the ideas are not nearly the same.  Which is a long-winded way of saying that you have identified a false equivalence here.  You're conflating the classical definition of faith with a religious faith which refuses to adhere to that definition.  So *NO!!!  An atheist does not require as much faith as a theist."

It's a colloquial usage...it's also an incomplete understanding of the idea the word houses.    Look you're not going to ever get me to disagree with you that the vast majority of people have no idea what epistemology is...let alone would have gone through the cognitive exercise of defining their basis for knowledge.  On this point, you and I are in violent agreement...  ...but let's not get distracted. The OP posited that atheism required as much faith as theism. This is absolutely a claim about epistemology. Which means we need to speak in epistemological terms. Your definition of faith doesn't cut it. It's like bowlers talking about strikes with a labor union. The word may be the same, but...   you can't..either side of the fence...you can't, it can't be proven (and the lack of proof has a get out clause, so can't use lack of evidence as evidence), so what are you supposed to do with you're point #1? pray and see if anything happens?, again 'mysterious ways' get out clause renders that experiment null and void...   Again, this is my point. In your counter-example, your belief is not rationally justified. It is justified by something else. I don't have many beliefs like this, but I do have some beliefs like it. I believe there is life somewhere else in the universe. I hold this to be true despite the fact that I lack sufficient evidence. But I recognize that this belief is irrational...so I don't act on it.   I think you mistook me as saying that beliefs can ** only** be justified by reason.

DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,Gladix,2,Tue Jul 7 12:48:18 2015 UTC,"Then it depends on a couple of things. If someone is going to claim that there are no gods period and that they have knowledge of this that is an extremely large burden of proof. I fail to see how anyone could meet it as it would also have to include any new or undiscovered god claims, and the search area alone is quite large.   If you want to narrow that down to a specific deity it changes things. Now you can start using logic and reason to assess claims about that specific deity. For example, the bible makes some very specific claims about the efficacy of prayer.  If those claims can be demonstrated to be inaccurate then I am no longer working without evidence.    Another example, god is claimed to be maximally powerful.  By that I mean able to do anything that is possible. Yet in Judges it indicates that god is unable to contrive a military victory because the other side has chariots with iron rimmed wheels. Surely a maximally powerful deity could have done so. This is not proof of god not existing but it is proof that either the claim itself is wrong or that the bible is wrong.  Either way you end up with a problem,  was god unable to confront chariots of iron or does the bible contain false information?  Whichever it is, the god claim is undermined.   Belief is being convinced something is true. Justification of those beliefs can take different paths and may be subjective. How many data points does one need to be justified in believing something?    But your question was does an atheist require as much faith. I agree with your statement that there is no proof god does exist. I would dispute that there is no evidence that he does not exist in so far as we can demonstrate things claimed about god can be shown to not be correct.  In this context a theist is believing in a deity in spite of evidence to the contrary of their claims while an atheist is using what may or may not be a sufficient justification for their claims. I would argue that even if you were to decide the atheist is using some faith it is less a leap of faith than the theist."

I don't believe there is an even or an odd number of gumballs.""  My friend gasps, ""But you HAVE to, if there isn't an even number there HAS to be an odd number, so if you don't believe in one, you HAVE to believe in the other.""  To which I respond, ""Um . . . no I don't you are confusing two propositions for one and a total of FOUR belief claims regarding them.  Don't do that, you only  deal with one proposition at a time, not two.  The two propositions are ""the gumballs are even(god exists)"" and ""the gumballs are odd(god does not exist).""  Each proposition you have 2 choices for a total of four.  You can accept the proposition, or reject it.  Now accepting both is patently absurd, because there can't simultaneously be both an even and a odd number of gumballs.  That's logically impossible, so that's where you are getting confused, because the two propositions  are related, you THINK they are the same proposition.  They are not, they are merely related to each other, that's all.  Thus while I am NOT free to accept both propositions as true, I AM free to reject both propositions as FALSE.  Why?  Because there is no EVIDENCE either is true, and in the absence of evidence it is intellectually dishonest to accept EITHER proposition as true.  You are confusing the map(what you believe) for the place (reality).   It is true that in reality there IS either an even or a odd number of gumballs, but the MAP, your belief about it, is ENTIRELY distinct from that.

Having no evidence about magic dildo shitting unicorns hiding in Mars is not a reason to claim the odds of it existing are 50 50   You're doing the math very wrong.  Saying ""I don't know"" or ""I don't have any information to come to a conclusion either way"" isn't the same as saying something is 50-50.  It's not the same as saying the odds re 1/2.  The chances of pulling a red card out of a shuffled 52-card deck are 50-50.  They are 1/2.  Why?  Because we have information.  We have information about this closed system, and can say that 26/52 possible results will result in a red card.  That's vastly different than saying whether there is (or isn't) a god.  We have ZERO information.  So instead of 1/2 or 26/52, the actual odds are 1/0.  Which, as you may no, is undefined.  It is the best representation we have of infinity, in fact.  You can choose to refuse to believe something that is unproven (and in fact untestable) is true.  But, the minute you choose to believe that it's untrue, you have just committed an act of belief, opinion and faith.  You have just tried to convince yourself that undefined (1/0) is, in fact, a reason to belief something for which there is zero evidence, either way.  And that, my friend, is as illogical as someone who chooses to believe it is true."

DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,indurateape,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:36:24 2015 UTC,"OK, simple matter of statistics here. You are talking about two options, god existing and god not existing. This would seem to be a 50/50 split, like a coin toss, but that's not how statistics works.   Let's just be a little careful about language. If we are talking about any idea and the probability of it being true, before having any evidence we can actually make some interesting starting probabilities based on indistinguishable options. For example, if you posit a unicorn, that is a series of a few basic elements. First, it is a horse-like animal, so we can start with accepting that a horse-like animal is totally possible, with a probability of 1 given our current universe. Adding a horn? Adding magic? Adding specific magical properties? Making then able to tell the difference between virgins and nonvirgins?   Each of these, without further evidence, can be treated as another division in the probabilities. If we take the horn, we then have a 50/50 or 1/2 split, meaning half of universes will have horse-like animals without a horn, half with a horn. Then we have magic existing. Another 1/2 division, but this multiplies with the previous, giving us a 1/4 split for a magical horned horse-like animal. Add the specific magical properties, let's say two of those each at 1/2, that makes it 1/16 possible universes will have a magical horned horse-like animal with two specific magical properties. Add the virgin thing and it goes down again, 1/32. Without any evidence about weighting of these possibilities we know that just based on this tree of options a horned magical virging detecting wizard horse is unlikely, and certainly less likely than a normal horse with a horn.  In the case of a God, we can apply the same process. A universe either has or has not got a God in it, so 1/2. A universe which does have a god either has one or many, so 1/4. A universe with one god either has a personal god or an impersonal god, so 1/8. This personal god either cares about humans or not, 1/16. This personal god either is it is not all powerful, all knowing, or all good, so 1/16 x 1/8, that's 1/128. Now a god with any single option changed is just as likely, but a theistic god, meaning a personal, all good, all knowing, all powerful, and existent god who cares about humans is one of 128 other options, and we haven't even had to look at the possibilities.   Atheism on the other hand is 1/2, literally the other half of the possible options. It says nothing about that nature of said nonexistent gods, it doesn't have to, nor does it make claims about the universe. The only question it addresses is the first one, is there a god, which without evidence is a 1/2 split, not the 1/128 split that theism has to handle, and is therefore a more defensible position."

Also, the ancient gods of Egypt and other civilizations also apparently didn't mind that their worshipers all died out, so we can easily rule them out as well.   As far as the Mormon conception of God, it is essentially a liberal definition of God (liberal theology - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religious_liberalism) and well within the limits of methodological naturalism used in science. There is plenty of evidence for Christianity and more specifically Mormonism, though science is obviously not going to directly lead anyone to any religion because that's not what science does. It can skeptically determine the validity of the God-believers claims, but it cannot prove abstracts (God lives on Kolob) if the abstract is vague.   Thus, one must take it 'on faith' that there is no God. Mind, no one needs to mention how much their faith in the nonexistence of God helps them in their life, because no atheist ever does that. Atheism is simply the logical assumption that since God never really does anything, he doesn't exist.   No intellectually honest person can say that this is absolute proof of His non-exsitence, however. Strong agnosticism or Mormonism or some other form of religious naturalism is the best way to go in my opinion; you don't lose anything in life if you choose to decide that it has intrinsic value."
DebateAnAtheist,3cbm92,Rat-Tat-Tat-Tat,2,Tue Jul 7 13:51:28 2015 UTC,"You seem to present the Mormon worldview as having fewer holes than other flavors of Christianity, or religions in general, while in my experience that doesn't seem to be the case. The distance from doctrinal Mormonism to religious naturalism or strong agnosticism seems very far indeed.   Atheism is simply the logical assumption that since God never really does anything, he doesn't exist. No intellectually honest person can say that this is absolute proof of His non-exsitence, however.   I think this is well said, and agree with you that non-intervention cannot constitute proof of non-existence, however I think that non-existence is the only reasonable default condition. Since so-called divine inspiration is the domain of so many charlatans throughout history, and study of demonstrably bogus novel religious beliefs which arise from misunderstanding of the natural world, there's a large body of evidence that supports religion as a concoction of the human mind.  One example is the cargo cults of the south pacific. If a set of religious beliefs springs up under those circumstances, it stands to reason that all of the diverse religious beliefs we now observe may have sprung up under similar circumstances (e.g. misattribution of some event which is better explained in some other way)."

One of my favorite examples  And these prophets frequently contradict each other. There's tremendous evidence refuting the idea that prophets have special revelation. Without legitimate modern-day revelation the whole thing returns to myth. The apologetic response is that they were ""speaking as men"", not as prophets. This is overt bollocks; a true prophet should never be wrong. Instead they cherry-pick instances of correct prophesy and bury the many incorrect ones. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.

Thus it would have wings, and it needs air, and it needs some things in order to be a monster (you can replace these with other components if you want).  All elements of Flying Spaghetti Monster are elements of the universe and appear within certain processes that happen in the universe. Thus, if there is FSM before the universe, this means that some elements of the universe already exist, and they need to be increased. This means that more wing elements for example must appear from nothingness (FSM=>WingFSM +other things in universe + FSM) As we pointed out, nothingness does not exist, so FSM cannot bring things out of nothingness.  Additionally, FSM should have wings, and feet, and spaghetti ... as parts. So it needs them in order to exist, it is caused by them. If we put them aside, there is no FSM. But what is a wing? It consists of feathers..., if we put them aside, we cannot talk about wing. So this shows that FSM is not a self-sufficient cause. It is actually a ""view"" of the act of a self-sufficient cause.

If we're correct about how the strong interaction works (and I admit that's a big if) then we have an example, in quark confinement, of the closest thing we observe to a philosophical 'nothing.' If you consider a flux tube, it effectively 'pushes away' the background and in so doing holds quarks together.  The thing is, this flux tube requires a remarkable amount of energy (especially when considering the mass-energy of the constituent quarks). If the tube is broken then the background immediately asserts itself. Effectively, what our experimental evidence tells us is that this version of 'nothing' seems to be remarkably unstable, and it actually requires energy in order to prevent it from becoming 'something.'"

Krauss speaks of fluctuations, things coming from his nothingness, and going into his nothingness. If we assume that this is general nothingness, then we cannot be able to do science or use logic, because anything can come out of nothingnes: Energy, particles, ... and there has to be no rule about their apparitions.  In this respect, to elaborate on Krauss naturally you need to use many things which are not compatible with the general nothingness that I meant.  On the other hand, since we are sentient, we cannot think of this general nothingness. Because by general nothingness I mean nothing now, nothing in the past, nothing in the future.

DebateAnAtheist,3cgolb,Luftwaffle88,6,Tue Jul 7 23:30:00 2015 UTC,"As asserted by many scientists, Krauss' suggestion is not the general nothingness (that I mean). One scientist put it concisely as follows: So if I make my hand like a fist, did the fist appear from nothingness?    Well that gets to the heart of a real problem, doesn't it?  There's a general metaphysical assumption - one that comes only from pure deduction - that if there could be a state which we might call 'nothingness', then nothingness can never change from being nothing into something. And I agree that, purely deductively, that is a reasonable conclusion. But reason is not reality, and we have ample evidence of that.  So we might be better to ask ourselves a different, more general question: is 'nothing' a valid concept? For example, it's one thing to assume that something's temperature can be measured - we do it all the time - but when you start to ask very specific, philosophical questions about what 'temperature' really means, you find that you end up on really shaky ground. It's not that temperature doesn't exist, it's that temperature is more of an aggregate concept, and referring to temperature as existing is not telling the whole story. Again, this assertion of temperature as a property is fine for your thermostat or your thermometer - this is not, however, good enough for a modern, philosophically dense conversation about what temperature really is.  So I suppose the question that I have is, why insist on this very classical definition of 'nothing' when we've made considerably deeper roads into the nature of reality?

But these are all false. And an important step toward the truth is to eliminate false assumptions.  And any road considered as a deeper road by say Krauss is no progress at all.

True, as in, corresponds to reality.   These are other reasons.   But it takes years and years of learning and study to understand these bits of arcana. Perhaps, with universal education, they are within the reach of everyone, but history shows us that no, in no way are they obvious.   Humanity has always developed, but the truth has always existed. And the sophisticated understandings about which humanity has been proud, became old after a certain time. The fundamentals  remain always the same, and every human being experiences them: A child is born from a mother, a mother is born from a mother, a mother is born from a mother. A person who has eyes, sees, a person who does not have eyes does not see. Nothing comes from nothingness. And things do not go into nothingness. And everything has something to do with everything else. Thus, the unity above all is the most obvious. Details we discover further just reiterate this fact."

That seems to contradict 3.2.2. An infinite chain of causes consists of parts and can thus not be self sufficient as a whole. So if there is an infinite chain of causes then it is not self sufficient, contradicting premise 3.

That is correct. It is only a theoretical (well, maybe not even theoretical) possibility (but which is asserted by many atheists who claim that the universe/multiverse is self-sufficient). So I do not assert that it is correct. In 4 in OP you can see that actually the physical things cannot be even defined as self-sufficient things.

If you read the link in the OP, you will see that anything that exists other than SSC is relative to other things. So there is circularity among them and they are passive. (And in harmony with some discoveries regarding quantum field theory, the distances that we consider as absolute do not seem to be absolute any more.) Thus for a smaller to be smaller, there needs to be a bigger; and for a bigger to be bigger, there needs a smaller; and they both define each other, so there is circularity which shows that they are not the very origin of their attributes. Thus there needs to be SSC which/who is the origin. And if SSC does not have an awareness about the smallness or bigness of anything, He cannot cause those to have those attributes, because He does not have a mechanical structure."

The particles that pop in and out of the quantum vacuum do so without a cause.  They constantly pop into existence and then (very) quickly decompose, but there is no reaction responsible for the creation of these particles.  Their constant creation and destruction is just the natural state of the quantum foam.  Either way, your argument is just a very wordy ""unmoved mover"" argument.  You are claiming that everything needs a cause, but your ""SSC"" doesn't, so you have to be right because everything needs a cause.  But you have not demonstrated how or why your SSC does not need a cause but everything else does.  Saying, ""oh, it's self sufficient"" does not cut it.    I could claim the universe itself is ""self sufficient"" and therefore doesn't need a cause.  ""Existing"" is just its natural state, plus I can use the conservation of energy to back this up.  Energy/matter cannot be created or destroyed, yet there is energy/matter so that means ""existing"" is energy/matter's natural state, since it is impossible to create energy/matter.  And then when you ask me to demonstrate this claim, I could just say, ""I don't need to because the universe is self-sufficient and requires no cause"" and suddenly we have the very basis of your argument only mine has one less step.

I still don't understand how consciousness, will, or unity comes into any of this.  If I tell a computer to randomly generate spheres of different sizes, it will create some spheres that are bigger and others that are smaller, yet the computer does not need to be conscious or self-aware to do this.

Of course the computer produces these, because a sentient being designed it, and the sentience of the designer needs unity, and it is originated by the sentient. A better example that you can give will need to be something totally isolated from the existence, which will not of course be possible.   If there is a SSC (and I don't believe that there is), it would not need to be conscious or aware of anything.   All the requirements of our sentience exists in SSC and without any distance. And since there is no mechanical structure within SSC as explained in OP, it is not necessary that the existent other than SSC exists. And in any case, we (at least I) normally say that things are contingent and conditional. So the only way things happen like they are, is a choice. And a choice cannot happen without awareness.

Do you think that that these particles would pop out if there was no quantum vacuum? And do you think that quantum vacuum is non-existent? Of course not.    You can read the following from wikipedia to see that particles do not pop out of nothing (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_state#Energy):  According to present-day understanding of what is called the vacuum state or the quantum vacuum, it is ""by no means a simple empty space"",[1] and again: ""it is a mistake to think of any physical vacuum as some absolutely empty void.""[2] According to quantum mechanics, the vacuum state is not truly empty but instead contains fleeting electromagnetic waves and particles that pop into and out of existence.  ...  In many situations, the vacuum state can be defined to have zero energy, although the actual situation is considerably more subtle. The vacuum state is associated with a zero-point energy, and this zero-point energy has measurable effects. In the laboratory, it may be detected as the Casimir effect. In physical cosmology, the energy of the cosmological vacuum appears as the cosmological constant. In fact, the energy of a cubic centimeter of empty space has been calculated figuratively to be one trillionth of an erg (or 0.6 eV).[8] An outstanding requirement imposed on a potential Theory of Everything is that the energy of the quantum vacuum state must explain the physically observed cosmological constant.   Do you mean that these particles and their energies did not exist at a certain time, and then it ""arose"", and started to exist? Or do you mean that it was at rest, then it gained a non-existent energy? Do you think that we know all about these particles/events histories?    Nope. I'd just reiterate that the universe itself is self-sufficient. It is not an ""effect"", it is just self-sufficient, like your SSC.    So it has to be the way it is? And for example the solar system exists even if there is no spacetime and no sun and no big bang? What is that which is self-sufficient? For example, like in the example in 4 in OP: Is it the engine? Is it the piston, valve and so on parts? Is it molecules? Is it atoms? All these are just a limited ""perception"". What is the very basis that which is the real self-sufficient? How effects coming together form a self-sufficient?

I'm not the first person to argue this, many quantum physicists agree that the fabric of the universe appears to have needed no cause.   I will be happy to hear your answers to the above four sets of questions.   Not true, a computer is an example of a non-conscious thing creating something. If non-conscious things can create other things, then it should also be possible that your ""SSC"" can create things without requiring consciousness.   If computer was self-sufficient, you might be right to some extent. But it is not self-sufficient. The sun causes living beings. This does not mean that the sun is the ultimate cause of the living beings. It has the atoms similar to atoms living beings have. So there is one ultimate cause.   River sediments are naturally sorted in order of grain size based on the current/flow speed. Are the rivers themselves conscious?   Exactly. River sediments are not self-sufficient either. They depend on how and how much other things exist behave. They just transfer the effects related to them to the follow up ECs.   The particles in the quantum vacuum do not ""choose"" to be created. They just are.   Again, they transfer the energy and other influences they have been delivered.  Unless ""the universe existing"" is the natural state of the universe,  Neither it, nor any part of it can be said to be a natural (it should mean necessary, but you can elaborate about what natural means) state."

I explained that in 10 in OP, and if you share your concerns, I will explain further.   Is there any indication the SSC is directly connected to the formation of human beings, outside the creation of the universe?   Of course. As explained in the link in OP, SSC is immediate cause of all. Each electron, each atom is under the power and knowledge of SSC.   Is there any indication the SSC interacts?   Of course, as explained in my previous paragraph. And also as you can see in the butterfly effect, there is an inherent uncertainty which makes everything uncertain from a human eye. Wherefore, SSC does not need to disturb the order that we benefit from in order to interact with anything, though, as in miracles, He has power to do anything. But if you consider physical laws and so on as absolute -as quasi gods-, you may have difficulty in accepting these.   Does the SSC have to be eternal?    Of course. What can limit Him at the beginning or at the end? Another SSC? There cannot be another SSC. Nothingness? Nothingness is non-existent.   There is nothing inconsistent with a temporary SSC, just as a god who kills himself to create the universe or a god who fades out as time passes.   God is not surrounded by partial nothingness in any direction. Since nothingness does not exist.   Is there anything to demand that the SSC is intelligent, and thus capable of interacting with humans on a meaningful level?   I may have misunderstood your question here. But if I understood correctly, I comment as follows: He is the ultimate active at any levels. He interacts with humans on a meaningful level (not necessarily always with our subjective meaning standards).   All of these come with two components: the logical proof, and the practical evidence to support the proof. So far, you offer only conjecture.   All of them are supported with logical proof and concrete evidences. But many atheists do not have or are not able to share their standards of evidence or logic, and in spite of this they consider any evidence or sound logical steps as conjectures. I have seen many atheists in the past who said that even if they saw God (supposing that He is visible), they would not believe, exactly as emphasized in the Quran. Thus, many atheists have unfalsifiable approach/ methods/ conclusions. I think this arises because of indifference to truth. If you were near a shore, and someone would tell you that a tsunami is approaching, you would not say ""I have no reason to believe him"", you would try to find out evidences that there is no tsunami approaching. Even, maybe you would start to run rightaway. But when it comes to evidences about God, many atheists say I do not need to do anything, let people (even God) come and convince me. Anyway, this last issue is not much related to the present thread. I just mentioned it just because you conclude that I offer just conjecture, while you do not share any evidence or any standard.

(Edited)   My point is that the definition of the prime mover, the argument you are using here, don't demand ultimate unlimited-ness. It only requires the violation of certain key principles.  Other attributes, such as wisdom, intelligence, benevolence, none of these are described in your logic.   Such as? And how? And by the way, I am not talking about a prime mover within the time framework.   Yes, you are. You can call it the SSC all you want, it's still the prime mover argument. You haven't come up with anything new.   Of course. As explained in the link in OP, SSC is immediate cause of all. Each electron, each atom is under the power and knowledge of SSC.   However, I don't think this has been proven, at all. Your argument ends with the existence of something that breaks causality, it doesn't say anything about control over the universe that follows.   He is the ultimate active at any levels. He interacts with humans on a meaningful level (not necessarily always with our subjective meaning standards).   Where is this in your argument?"

It only requires the violation of certain key principles.   On the contrary. If there is any limitation, this limitation will be either another SSC, which is shown to be impossible; or it will be caused by nothingness, which is again shown to be impossible.   Yes, you are. You can call it the SSC all you want, it's still the prime mover argument. You haven't come up with anything new.   I understand that you conceive things as only particles or fields and movement. Thus it is normal that you have difficulty in conceiving other fundamental attributes, and a SSC who/which does anything other than moving. But I do not look from a narrow perspective. Your classification does not bother me, you can classify it as you want, but I do not agree.   However, I don't think this has been proven, at all. Your argument ends with the existence of something that breaks causality, it doesn't say anything about control over the universe that follows.   I think the explanations in the link in OP makes it clear. There is no breaking of causality in the framework in OP, on the contrary, it explains the very basis of causality, without which, causality becomes empty.   Where is this in your argument?   It relates to my second paragraph in this comment. We should not see that the only fundamental thing is movement. So sentience is also a fundamental attribute. Thus, the mover you conceive as only moving, for me behaves in many other dimensions as well. I do not think that demoting all existence to motion is very correct.   Thus, everything in OP relates to interaction with humans as well."

A self sufficient thing is self contained. It requires no outside aid, which means it would not behave in anyway that affects outside its system, to do so would require an outside thing to be affected. As it is contained, it would never create a cause outside of itself. Only if its containment were disrupted that it would be forced to react, no longer making it self sufficient.   Good point. I never meant that SSC creates something outside itself. SSC acts. The creation are His acts. It is like the relationship of your sentience to what you imagine.    I don't get your point.   Maybe after the above explanations you get the point. Otherwise I can explain further.   Since we are discussing things that exist that have neither time nor space, we most assume they exist in a way that seem contradictory to the way we perceive reality, as we perceive reality within the confines of time and space.   I see. So, actually what you say is important. SSC is not limited within the confines of space and time. And in fact, we also can surpass them, we actually do. Very similarly to what you say. But if you think matter is absolute, you cannot prove that we can surpass them. The way to surpass is unity. And everything is similarly to what you say passively one.   A living being is not self sufficient.   Not necessarily. If you define living being EC, then yes; but you are not justified to say that SSC must be dead.   Panpsychism is outdated. It was replaced a hundred years ago with logical positivism and verificationism.   Maybe you do not follow the developments in that area. The quantum field discoveries are also used today to support panpsychism. Just check the link I gave.   Many parts not being separate, but unified as one thing.

You're creating a comparitive description off of yourself. Any substantiation?   Theory of relativity deals with relativeness to an observer.  Your entire line of argument makes zero sense.   If something is two inches as we define ""2 inches"" is irrelevant. If our measurement scale of ""inches"" was shorter and it was described then as ""3 inches"", but it would not change the size of the thing. It has nothing to do with if it were self sufficient. I am not talking about the names of the units we call. I emphasize the definiteness of the values.   I don't recognize your meaning of ""definiteness"".  This is again you using words outside of their meaning.     Imagine that an object moves with a speed twice the speed of another object. How do you relate their speeds if they are isolated fully? And suppose that there is only one object in the universe, how can you even talk about speed?   Speed can only be defined within the confines of space/time.  Your example is irrelevant.  Try again.   How do you define relativity? You seem to play very fast and loose on meaning. You can visit the following to have an idea: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_relativity   You can't utilize relativity outside of time and space.     Then what do you mean by ""mechanical""? And how is it different by ""sentience""? Mechanical: Then what do you mean by ""mechanical""? And how is it different by ""sentience""? A mechanical fact is only meaningful within a relationship. And that which relates the elements of the mechanical things relates to sentience and unity. For example imagine a big and a small circle.    No.  You are again using comparative descriptors.  A small object wouldn't be small if it was bigger than you.     What value does a small circle have in terms of its size by itself?    Irrelevant.   And what does the small circle have any value? But when you imagine both, you relate them, and then they form a system.    Only in the way you perceive them in your mind, not in reality.   Likewise, the very being of all requires the unity of the Creator. You cannot substatiate that.  The circles may be considered mechanical in this example, and your sentience and perception and its unity is what makes the small be small and be big.   No.  That's not how that works.     Are you suggesting there was no energy pre universe? There is always the power of SSC. But the power of Allah is different.   You cannot substantiate that.   And energy that we mentioned is limited, and passive in the sense of the link in OP. Simultaneously connected and separate. How is this? Not redundant. Transcendent. You don't. Stop being flippant.

Furthermore, my ability to perceive our supposed reality does not equate to reality causing me to perceive it.

Please see the additional explanation under 1 in OP.   In the same vein as you stating that nothingness does not exist I shall state that something could always have existed, therefore reality needed no cause.   Note that the argument is not first mover argument. Thus in this argument, the beginning of the universe is not necessary. SSC is not only a first mover cause, it is involved at all levels: At the material cause, efficient cause, final cause, formal cause, top-down, top-down cause or whatever cause type that is conceived/conceivable SSC is active at any moment, any place. An eternal universe requires that once created and set in motion, things will continue existing/behaving as self-sufficient things except at the start. But as explained in the link in OP and in number 4, limited things are never self-sufficient.   Furthermore, my ability to perceive our supposed reality does not equate to reality causing me to perceive it.   It was not what I meant. Maybe the additional explanation in OP may help you to better understand what is meant.   At any rate, it is interesting to note that you start by claiming that there is a cause because reality exists, but then finish by stating that SSC does not require a cause because GN is not possible.   Note that I never said that everything needed causes. With SSC, there is already the cause.   Now you just need to make the next logical connection to see that SSC is unnecessary, right?

In case it helps, it seems to me that things like the gravitational field and the electromagnetic field that interact non-sentiently based on simple rules would be good candidates for SSCs. So, what I have in mind in terms of those differentiating qualities are the equations that describe those fields. That said, this could also go a polytheistic route and say that the multiple SSCs are different sentient gods that are differentiated by their personalities."

You mention interactions as differentiating factors. But SSCs must be able to exist before the interactions, right? Then they have to be SSCs before the interactions. So if they are many SSCs, then they are not identical. But what makes them different before interactions? Anyway, whatever makes each of them different, is a cause of that SSCs being different. Thus if there are many SSCs, then they need something, therefore, such an SSC is not self-sufficient.

DebateAnAtheist,3cegdw,hurricanelantern,25,Tue Jul 7 23:22:21 2015 UTC,"If 'nothing' is equal to negative, that would explain the origin of the universe   Welp, that was a quick way to kill your argument. Since nothing isn't a negative, but neutral ...   Everyone says that 'nothing' is 0. But what is 0? The absence of everything? But there is never the absence of everything because even the thought/non-thought of it contains consciousness.    You'd have to prove that consciousness exists independent of matter and energy first. Until then ...   Therefore, I propose that 'nothing' means -1 and 0 actually means pure consciousness.   And I propose that I'm Thor, the Norse god.   My response is that you cannot ADD nothing to something because 'nothing' does not exist. It's outside of existence/negative.   So now you're contradicting yourself in the very main post lol. Couldn't even wait for you to do it in the comments, huh? If nothing isn't of existence or of negatives, it's exactly what you started saying it's not earlier ... it's nothing. It's neutral. Zero. Nada. Zip.    sacrifice 'something' to 'nothing'   And here you continue with the crazy talk ... Yea, let's sacrifice things to nothing! Shall I round up the virgins?   0 = consciousness (consciousness exists, it is not nothing)   Consciousness as electrical impulses in our brain. As soon as our brains [ or any other vital organ in our body that would deprive the brain of what it needs to function ] stops functioning, people stop being conscious. As I said earlier, if you want to claim that consciousness exists independent of our minds, matter and energy of any kind, a.k.a. not of this natural world of ours as we understand it, I'd be thrilled to hear your argument for it -- as long as it's an actual coherent argument and not you asserting more crazy things without any basis like ""nothing = -1"" and ""0 = pure consciousness"".   So by adding 0 you are adding consciousness to the apple   So in math, when we solve the following equation: ""1 + 0 = ?"", the 'correct' answer is ""= a conscious 1"". Noted. Are you serious dude? A conscious apple now? ROFL   BUT if we COMBINE them we see that 'nothing' EATS 'something'   HELP! I'm being eaten by nothing! Nothing is here and it's gnawing my feet! Please hurry!   We combined nothing to apple. The apple IS nothing. We are saying what the apple IS. It's nothing   So when people add nothing to this debate, choosing to ignore your crazy talk, they're basically reducing you to nothing. You are. You're nothing. You can stop punching yourself anytime now, as funny as this may be for the rest of us.   Derocka was an apple: Everything that Derocka is beyond a combination of letters has become an apple because we've combined them.   So now you can summon apples into existence by combining letters! I'd like to see that party trick live. Where can I buy tickets to your show?   WAS (+/combine)   ""was"" is a word regarding a period of time preceding the present. It's not a synonym for addition or ""combine"". Even if someone would be silly enough to agree with any of what you just said, you'd kill your whole credibility with this mere section of your argument, which clearly illustrates you have no idea what the fuck you're talking about."

There's no reason to extend that to morality being subjective; there are some things, for example slavery, which is always wrong, and anybody who claims it's not wrong is mistaken.

DebateAnAtheist,3cegdw,lannister80,13,Wed Jul 15 03:46:43 2015 UTC,It depends on the circumstances of the killing doesn't it? But on the most basic level it is based on a reciprocal understanding. In other words I don't want you to kill me and you don't want me to kill you and we assume no one in our community wants to be killed by anyone else so we agree killing each other is 'wrong' (which is of couse an entirely subjective premise).

Consciousness, however, is a phenomenon that either occurs or doesn't. Granted, right now we don't have a good test to detect it, but it's in a different category from morality."

Killing is immoral because us, as communities and societies, decided. It's for the mutual benefit of everyone within such social constructs to outrule it as wrong, because we certainly wouldn't want to be the victims of one such action [ and neither did you when you were offered with the chance to be the victim -- so you're arguing for our case whether you know it or not lol ].  Also, killing someone isn't always wrong either, and it's actually condoned in self defense or the benefit of many [ for example, cops shooting an armed criminal heading towards a crowd of civilians ].   As you can see, killing another person isn't always wrong and it isn't always right either. Morality exists. It's subjective.

Yet by that logic, that means that consciousness is not something--given the different values you've applied to them. And this is where your ""argument"" falls apart--if consciousness isn't a ""something"" than it is, by definition, ""nothing"" (which means its value should be 0 according to your number assignments). Yet you also state that consciousness is not nothing, meaning it must be a ""something"". And around and around we go...  Basically, your entire argument is self-contradictory. You've arbitrarily singled out a ""something"" (consciousness) and assigned it a different value from all of ""somethings"", while still claiming that it is part of the ""something"" set in order to differentiate it from ""nothing"".   Hell even your apple analogy contradicts your argument. You claim that when you add ""0"" to an apple (1) you get 1 + ""awareness of the apple"" / ""consciousness"". Which means that there was an addition (under your argument) of something (granted an incorporeal something, but something nonetheless). But in basic mathematics, 1 + 0 =/= 1 + something. It equals 1, unchanged.  It literally is counter intuitive to consider ""nothing"" as a negative value, rather than the null value of 0.

DebateAnAtheist,3cegdw,pyrespirit,-1,Tue Jul 7 07:59:48 2015 UTC,"If 'nothingness' is the void of everything, then that makes 'nothing' a void. Void's are negatives because they need to be filled.   I'm sorry that i made so many contradictions but it's confusing to even think about let alone express.   the reason why I gave consciousness the value of 0 is because it's largely undefined, yet it's certainly not imaginary.  And in Quantum physics there a particles so small they move by you merely looking at them. Well, what if things moved by us merely thinking about them? thereby our thoughts are equal to zero, because they're arn't of anything tangible yet can effect matter (extremely small matter). And thereby when you think about an apple you are actually applying 'something' to it, so 0 + apple actually = Apples and thoughts.   So if we were to literally apply 'nothing' to an Apple we'd be applying a void (which cannot exist inside the universe) and the void would consume the apple to equal = 0. Our awareness of the non-existent apple."

But that doesn't mean there is a void which must be filled. I simply don't have anything in the bowl. Nothing is simply the absence of a something, usually confined to specific contexts.  With regards to the mathematics, it still does not make sense to say 1 + 0 = 1 + ""quasi-something"". You've just arbitrarily assigned ""consciousness"" the value of 0. Even with the argument that quantum physics suggests that we affect objects simply by observing them, through shifts in quantum particles, that would still suggest that consciousness/observation holds a value greater than 0. 0 is a null value. You literally cannot add 0 to 1 and somehow get something greater than 1."

True, but that gets down to what do we mean by ""nothing"". For most people, the bowl has ""nothing"" in it.  But let's say we accept your definition of ""nothing is a void"". As soon as the void is ""filled"", wouldn't it cease to be a void and become a ""something""? In this regard, it would again makes more sense to assign ""nothing"" the value of 0, because once you add anything to ""nothing"", you no longer have ""nothing""."

Yes, but you've removed the bowl and now got only a point.   That's how we can apply this to the existence of the universe:  nothing (-1) was + before (1) = 0 the universe (0+1 = 1) (everything started as a dense point)  'Before', 'after' and 'outside' fill the void of  nothingness that exists outside the universe thereby leaving only something and infinity (can 0 be attributed to infinity? What if 0 is just the bottom end of infinity?)  But the opposite of a bowl is before, outside and after the universe.

The effects can be as innocuous as not living your one & only life to the fullest because you believe that this life is just a practice run for the next “bigger & better” life. Or it could be as extreme as wanting to terrorize infidels by beheading people on social media. Misinformation rarely leads to good decisions being made. Religion has consistently been shown to have poor, inaccurate & contradictory data to how reality actually works. It’s consequences can be seen on any given day by just watching the NEWS.

Religious people give a hypothesis. Atheists usually do not.   First, ""I don't know"" is a scientific answer, and the default until we do know.  Second, we'd need an explanation of how God was responsible and what it is for it to be a hypothesis. ""The thing which can do the thing by definition"" isn't a hypothesis. It must be explanatory to some extent.   But given how any of those possibilities contradict what we now know as ""science"" the God hypothesis is just as plausible, if not more so   And how exactly does the God hypothesis work such that it doesn't contradict science? ""It's always existed"" is scientifically possible, ""magic"" is not.    So it's more a question of what hypothesis you accept, rather than one of evidence.    Nope. We do not assume hypotheses based on convenience. We test them, and until they produce evidence, they are speculation. We remain non-believers until results are produced. And as stated, God doesn't even manage the minimum standards of a hypothesis, unless you have a specific explanation of what it is and how it works.   Given that that question basically boils down to an equal chance of 3 weird options, doesn't the question boil down to what is ""Good"" to believe?   There's way more than that, and this sounds like an attempt to use some scientific words to try and convince people to ignore the basic principles of science.

Scientists can describe, in very great detail, how we got here:   We understand, back to the very first 10-43 portion of a second, how the universe expanded and cooled, and how particles and energy reacted and interacted until it was cool enough to start forming normal matter. The physics of this is well established by the scientific models of the Big Bang We understand, to a very good degree, how that expanding matter coalesced into galaxies and stars and black holes, through the fields of astrophysics and cosmology We understand, to a large degree, how our solar system formed, and how early objects formed and smashed into each other and cooled and stabilized, and even how certain specific objects formed (our moon was formed when an early mars-sized object smashed into an early Earth) We know, to a large degree, how chemicals can form into different types and more complicated forms of what we call ""organic"" compounds (all this word means is that the compound contains carbon). We see amino acids in asteroids. No, we don't quite know how exactly these complex molecules became self-replicating, but there are some very promising ideas being actively researched at the moment. We understand, to a very good degree, how self-replicating organisms change over generations, and the pressures that are exerted by our environment that help certain organism to fail and others to succeed. We can see, through fossils and DNA and comparative anatomy, the actual path of descent through modification that ties all living organisms on our planet together.   No, science doesn't know everything. (""Science knows it doesn't know everything otherwise it would stop"" - Dara O'Briain).   Sure, we may not know what exactly happened before 10-43 seconds, but neither do you.  And what does religious creationism offer?   Hand waving? ""God did it"" platitudes?  No, religion doesn't explain these things either.   To quote one of my favorite scientists, Theism isn't well-defined:   Scientifically speaking, the existence of God is an untenable hypothesis. It’s not well-defined, it’s completely unnecessary to fit the data, and it adds unhelpful layers of complexity without any corresponding increase in understanding. Again, this is not an a priori result; the God hypothesis could have fit the data better than the alternatives, and indeed there are still respected religious people who argue that it does. Those people are just wrong, in precisely analogous ways to how people who cling to the Steady State theory are wrong. Fifty years ago, the Steady State model was a reasonable hypothesis; likewise, a couple of millennia ago God was a reasonable hypothesis. But our understanding (and our data) has improved greatly since then, and these are no longer viable models.

The thing is, because there are so many possibilities when you look at things this way, this way of looking at things isn't very useful for reasoning with.  Accordingly, when we say this is 'evidence' of that, we mean that there is something in particular about this which indicates that rather than any other possibility.  This is a much more useful way of looking at it because it gives us something definite to work from.    In a sense, you could say that what we believe about the universe or the existence of god depends on what we think is a good idea to believe but I think it's better to say that it's a good idea to believe things for which belief is justified.  And I'm not just saying that because I 'think it's good' either.  I say that because it's a demonstrably more effective way to go about living life.    It's true that there are things we don't yet know or understand about the universe but I think it's wrong to number the options and talk about 'the chances' because we simply can't know whether those are all the options nor do we have any information from which to derive probabilities.  At this point, I think, the most honest thing to do is slap a big ""I don't know"" on questions like ""where'd the universe come from"" and follow it up with a hearty ""but I'm going to find out""."

I'm not saying that the existence of the world proves that God definitely does exist, but the existence of the world is certainly evidence that needs to be explained by a hypothesis. Religious people give a hypothesis. Atheists usually do not.   There are so many things wrong with this.  First you need to realize that evidence being consistent with a claim is not necessarily evidence supporting a claim.  The world can be evidence consistent with a god claim, sure.  But that means almost nothing.  The world can be evidence consistent with a claim of no gods also.  The world isn't evidence supporting a god claim for two reasons: 1) it's consistent with alternative explanations; 2) classical god claims are unfalsifiable and potential supporting evidence that turns out not to exist should be evidence against the claim, but there can't be evidence against an unfalsifiable claim.  Classical religious claims are not hypotheses in that they are not testable nor falsifiable.  Atheists don't need to provide a hypothesis explaining how the world exists.  First, because we don't know that it began to exist.  Second, because it might literally be unknowable.  Third, because the absence of better explanations doesn't give any plausibility to untestable, unfalsifiable explanations that are indistinguishable from something made up by Bronze Age storytellers."
DebateAnAtheist,3c9esa,lannister80,2,Mon Jul 6 16:25:25 2015 UTC,"We can pretty well explain the existence of the world without needing to rely on theism -- the gathering of elements that became the sun, the growing accretion disk from which Earth eventually emerged, and we even have a couple good theories on how our moon came to be. (If you meant world as in Earth.) This evidence is substantially better than the hypothesis that a magical being created all of it.  So I'm just not sure what the God hypothesis is needed to explain. You can call him a God of the gaps if you want, but it's probably better to say ""we don't know right now how _______ happened"" then just claim that _______ was the work of God... because every time in the past we've claimed that, it turned out we were wrong."

It's thereby not a hypothesis in the scientific sense and it's just a wild guess that they decided to assert as a factual truth without any justification, trying to force down everyone else's throat, simply because they believe it.   Atheists usually do not.    Say what again?   we now know as ""science"" the God hypothesis is just as plausible, if not more so   Not a hypothesis. Covered that already. As for how plausible it is, not only Occam's Razor says that only things with explanatory power should be accounted for [ which creationism is not, as it's basically ""Magic dude! Magic!"" ], but also doesn't need the extra ""God"" step.   It just moves the goalposts as the ""who created god then?"", ""what is god"" and many other questions emerge, creating more unknowns than the unknown it 'explained'. Saying ""God always existed"" or ""God doesn't need a creator"" is just special pleading and if something can exist without a creator or exist forever without a beginning, then the same can be applied to what was the singularity before the Big Bang, surely, without the need of this ""God""."

You imply that there are only three options for the world's existence: it always existed, it popped into existence, or God created it. How do you know there aren't also options 4 and 5? Furthermore (because I can't imagine what 4 and 5 would be), why are options 1 and 2 any more weird than option 3? If, before the Big Bang, there was another universe (we have no reason to believe this, AFAIK), option 1 is possible. If there wasn't one, option 2 is possible. Option 3 is also possible, but why is it any less weird than the other two?  The other thing you overlooked was that this: jus The existence of the world is certainly evidence that needs to be explained by a hypothesis.  ... doesn't exactly sound right. I mean, hypotheses don't explain things. They are basically questions (like ""was the world created by God?"") that are supposed to be tested using methods that are very carefully shown to relate directly to the hypothesis. You have to show an objective relationship exists, and then you have to actually get results (either through experiment, observation, or Google).   That's also not how you use hypotheses. Let's say we don't know how the world was created (we do have a pretty good idea, but let's say we don't). I cannot act on information I do not have. If I do not know how the world was created, it would make no sense for me to jump to one hypothesis among countless others and say, ""okay, this might be the answer, let's test it out."" Just because, as you said, people of faith give a hypothesis, doesn't actually mean anything. It doesn't matter because just coming up with a hypothesis doesn't mean anything unless you also determine whether it's true or false."

Furthermore hypotheses make predictions that can be tested and explains observations made in the world around us.  But even saying ""I dont know"" is perfectly fine in this context and likely better than throwing an idea  in there that has no data to back it up. ""god did it"" explains nothing and has no value over the ""i dont know"" position.   The world could have always just existed, or it could have just appeared out of nowhere.

While they didn't use the words multiverse or universe, the ancients were aware of Premise 1, and the name for absolute reality was dependent on their culture, Brahman, Tao, God, being among the most well known.   Nonsense. The ancient gods were anthropomorphic beings who lived on mountains, in volcanos or in the sky, had magical powers and permanently bad mood, frequently got mad and sent droughts or floods when they didn't receive enough sacrifices, or swung their hammer in order to create lightning. They had nothing to do with ""ultimate reality"", conclusion 1 is complete baloney.   Premise 3. You are not a philosophical zombie.   Because philosophical zombies are physically impossible. If a being is composed of exactly the same atoms as I am, which are arranged exactly as in my body, that being has exactly the same conscious experience, qualia, or sentience as I do. We currently don't know yet how exactly the mind and consciousness arise from nothing but the physical brain, but we already know that they do.   Conclusion 2: reality is not based on matter. Reality is based on being.   Reality is based on being, but the only things which have ever been demonstrated to be are material.   Conclusion 3: the basis of reality/existence is also the ""ground of being""   Define your terms and provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that what you're talking about does really exist.

No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.""

Your premises and conclusions are complete and utter bullshit that deserve to be rejected out of hand and hardly warrant a response, and you're attempting to reverse the burden of proof. The onus is on you to present a solid case before anybody is obliged to respond, and so far you're holding an empty sack.

Also, this:   Reality is based on being, but the only things which have ever been demonstrated to be are material.   I happen to agree that empirical proofs is best proofs, but that's just tautological. I mean, the only thing that can be demonstrated to exist is that which exists physically.   Define your terms and provide empirical evidence to demonstrate that what you're talking about does really exist.   The thing is, the terms were defined. OP spent a good chunk of the post defining them. And, again, while I do agree that evidence is love, evidence is life, how are you supposed to provide empirical evidence of things that aren't physical? Your demand makes no sense.

I'm pretty calm usually, but I've had enough encounters with u/mobydikc to know he's a fucking troll and does everything to rile people up. Such people don't deserve kindness.   You also made extensive use of the ad hominem fallacy for no good reason. Seriously?   You need to look up what the ad hominem fallacy really is. An ad hominem is a fallacy in which a claim or argument is dismissed on the basis of some irrelevant fact or supposition about the author or the person being criticized. Insulting people or name-calling is not an ad hominem fallacy. In fact it's not fallacious at all.   How can you possibly defend the existence of something (consciousness) when you can't even define it properly?   I can define consciousness: every sufficiently complex physical system that integrates information is conscious. This definition might not be entirely accurate, but it's a trillion times better than anything dualists have so far come up with, who can say absolutely nothing reliable about their conception of consciousness – it is simply some sort of ungraspable magic in their view. Your objection is much more devastating to the dualist than to the physicalist.   I mean, the only thing that can be demonstrated to exist is that which exists physically.   Which is only so because the only thing that exists is the physical world. Surely non-physical things are conceivable, but there is no reason why they should defy investigation, except when they aren't real.   And, again, while I do agree that evidence is love, evidence is life, how are you supposed to provide empirical evidence of things that aren't physical?   Life is a purely natural and physical phenomenon, and so is love. ""You can't explain love, therefore religion"" is such a tired apologetic canard. Of course we can explain love. The biological, psychological and evolutionary bases of love have been identified a long time ago. Psychology teaches that love is also an activity, not just a feeling. It is characterized for example by deep trust, caring and altruism. While it's right that this behavior could be faked, the biological basis cannot.  Love comprises three overlapping stages: lust, attraction and attachment. Lust is the initial passionate sexual desire that promotes mating, and involves the increased release of chemicals such as testosterone and estrogen. The protein molecule known as the nerve growth factor (NGF) has high levels when people first fall in love. These effects rarely last more than a few weeks or months.  Attraction is the more individualized and romantic desire for a specific candidate for mating, which develops out of lust as commitment to an individual mate forms. As people fall in love, the brain consistently releases a certain set of chemicals, including the neurotransmitter hormones dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin, stimulating the brain's pleasure center and leading to side effects such as increased heart rate, loss of appetite and sleep, and an intense feeling of excitement. Research has indicated that this stage generally lasts from one and a half to three years.  Attachment is generally based on commitments such as marriage and children, or on mutual friendship based on things like shared interests. It has been linked to higher levels of the chemicals oxytocin and vasopressin, to a greater degree than short-term relationships have.   how are you supposed to provide empirical evidence of things that aren't physical? Your demand makes no sense.   Again, the fact that empirical evidence can't be provided is only so because non-physical things don't exist. If they did, there's no logical reason why there shouldn't be some empirical evidence for them. Or maybe some other kind of evidence, but meaningless gibberish isn't any. Remember, the onus is on the claim maker. He has to make a case, and bitching around which evidence he can't provide is not making a case.   Everything you wrote from that point onwards was a mix of personal opinion, fallacious thinking, and ad hominem.   Everything you've written are the laments of a hysterical wench who merely dislikes what she read. If you've spotted a fallacy, name it and demonstrate that I committed it. Merely declaring ""your thinking is fallacious"" doesn't demonstrate anything and doesn't show what step of reasoning exactly was in what way fallacious."

It could stil be accurate but you can't know one way or the other.

If you had people group things into blue and green, most could easily do it.  Thing is, now drop the terms blue and green.  Now place in the wavelength of light.  Now it's not subjective but still grouped the same.  How each of us views the world can't be known to others at this time.  But the accuracy of an individual's representation of reality can sometimes be determined.  You and I would pick out a block that emits light at a frequency of 472 nm and put it in the blue box."

And yet c2) explicitly turns away from matter, so again, I don't know what being means here.

Other ancient conclusions weren't usually treated anything like a mere fundamental quality of the universe itself, but rather as a mysterium that created the universe,  but was separate or absent from the mundane universe.  ""Ground of being"" is a pretty late reappropriation of religion. I think that was Tillich's thing.

YHVH created the planet, the sun, stars, animals, and humans. And God in heaven occasionally intervened in the events of Earth, and finally Jesus came and claimed to be his son. Nothing in this general narrative implies anything like ""all is one, i.e. God."" ""All is one"" is not even common in modern Christendom, Judaism, or Islam, let alone in their ancestral forms.  You are redefining this narrative to make it fit with something like modern cosmology, and I think this is unfair both to modern science and to these ancestral religious traditions.

That isn't qualia, that is precisely the part of the brain that is indeed computational. That is just stimuli creating electrical impulse which communicates information. That doesn't explain experience, only the conditions that lead to it.    Red light hits the eye which encodes the light into communication via electrical impulse to the brain, that impulse is indeed a code that we can cipher. For example, assume 2 dots and a dash = a red circle. OK, now we know that when a brain produces such an electrical communication the observer will see a red circle, that is it. That's all neuropsych tells us. That doesn't tell us a single thing about the act of experiencing the sight of a red circle, it only tells us what stimulus produces what images.  Again, that entire process could take place without the phenomenon of experience accompanying it. Why must brain computation necessarily be accompanied by experience, that is the question.   I submit Chalmers on the easy vs hard problem, emphasis mine:  ""There is no real issue about whether these [neurophysiological] phenomena can be explained scientifically.

To explain access and reportability, for example, we need only specify the mechanism by which information about internal states is retrieved and made available for verbal report. To explain the integration of information, we need only exhibit mechanisms by which information is brought together and exploited by later processes. For an account of sleep and wakefulness, an appropriate neurophysiological account of the processes responsible for organisms' contrasting behavior in those states will suffice. In each case, an appropriate cognitive or neurophysiological model can clearly do the explanatory work....If these phenomena were all there was to consciousness, then consciousness would not be much of a problem. Although we do not yet have anything close to a complete explanation of these phenomena, we have a clear idea of how we might go about explaining them. This is why I call these problems the easy problems. Of course, ""easy"" is a relative term. Getting the details right will probably take a century or two of difficult empirical work. Still, there is every reason to believe that the methods of cognitive science and neuroscience will succeed.""  ""The really hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect. As Nagel (1974) has put it, there is something it is like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field. Other experiences go along with perception in different modalities: the sound of a clarinet, the smell of mothballs. Then there are bodily sensations, from pains to orgasms; mental images that are conjured up internally; the felt quality of emotion, and the experience of a stream of conscious thought. What unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in them. All of them are states of experience...It is undeniable that some organisms are subjects of experience. But the question of how it is that these systems are subjects of experience is perplexing. Why is it that when our cognitive systems engage in visual and auditory information-processing, we have visual or auditory experience: the quality of deep blue, the sensation of middle C? How can we explain why there is something it is like to entertain a mental image, or to experience an emotion? It is widely agreed that experience arises from a physical basis, but we have no good explanation of why and how it so arises. Why should physical processing give rise to a rich inner life at all? It seems objectively unreasonable that it should, and yet it does. If any problem qualifies as the problem of consciousness, it is this one."""

I'm not sure you're even asking the right question.  The experience is a side effect of the brain designed to understand, predict, and plan in the environment it's body is living in.  It is likely there because 'thinking' about an environment is a useful tool for generating predictions of the future."

Our brains are model generators.  If there is information that confuses us or that we are missing, it might alter our perception of what is actually real.  Brains that make models that match reality result in higher fitness.  Did you miss when he said:  ""so fitness does depend on reality as it is, yes, but also on the organism, its state and its action. ""  Fitness depends on reality as it is and an organisms ability to assess that reality so as to result in survival of the species.  That is why that beetle was going extinct.  It's model making ability was flawed.  It didn't accurately predict something.  That's why we now use science.  To get around our biases.  Again, congratulations.  You learned about cognitive bias today and why we use the scientific method.  Edit:  I made a mistake.     Brains that make models that match reality result in higher fitness   Brains that make models that result in survival more often than not match reality.  There are cases where survival is aided by assuming things.  We can be hyper atuned to things, like seeing or hearing things in the dark.  That is a model that is often incorrect, but aids in survival.  That is one reason we have science.  To check models in a rational way."

You're totally making me reconsider my stance.""  Instinctive perception may or may not be advantageous to full recognition of reality in simulation; depending entirely on what coefficients you program into your equations. This is what Donald Hoffman, the TED talker, found. Whether Truth or not-truth wins out depends entirely on the numerical cost you associate with finding out the truth. This includes time-based fitness cost for observing information, which is relevant in fight-or-flight situations (although he used food territories instead). It's not very relevant elsewhere. What are the actual numerical coefficients? Radically dependent on the situation, of which actual organisms face more than one. It might cast some shade on single-situation instinctive perception; but that's not how we form our deeper understanding of reality.  Adaptive and flexible reasoning, shared and preserved communally, as we possess and some other species do to varying degrees, can obviously be evolutionary advantageous; he may have done simulations on 'is there a food in that territory' but he certainly didn't do simulations on developing tool-making and agriculture to grow one's own food- it's these abilities that we use to form our understanding of reality, not 'tiger-in-the-bushes-quick-run'."

I mean, you'd have to be able to see atoms, molecules, the air, all wavelengths of light, all energy, all matter and all their interactions.  Do you realize that the energy requirements for that would be staggering?  So of course we take short cuts.  The point is, those short cuts aren't always right.  If an animal was getting ready to attack me, do you think it would be better if my mind was able to see animal, attacking...process...maybe I should run.  Or would it be better to analyze all the air patterns, heat emitted by the animal, atoms of the animal, etc....Process....run.  Computational time to analyze everything with our size would be impossible as is right now, at the very least, slow.  Slower than just seeing an animal(from a simplistic standpoint).

If two people hear something in a bush, one thinks it a tigers and runs, while the other doesn't think that and checks, it doesn't matter what is actually in the bush.  The one who runs will always survive that scenario, but if the rustling turns out to be a rabbit the one who looked has food to survive with while the other doesn't.  The accurate perception could mean death or not, but an inaccurate perception is more likely to lead to death than an accurate one.  If someone doesn't think that a car is coming they're more likely to get run over, while someone with an accurate perception will know to get out of the way.  2) I didn't see any connection between human behavior in regards to accurate perceptions of reality when it comes to that beetle example.

DebateAnAtheist,3c7x4j,MikeTheInfidel,3,Sun Jul 5 22:37:51 2015 UTC,"The part that gets me the most is this:   So the bottom line is, evolution does not favor vertical, or accurate perceptions [of reality].   Let me repeat that, to make it clear.  Evolution does not favour a perception of reality that is accurate. It favours instead a perception of reality that aids survival.  The next step is something that the religious side tends to completely gloss over.  Psychology tells us that we do not perceive reality accurately.  If I restate that in a logical argument, it would go as such.   Premise 1: Evolution does not favour a perception of reality that is accurate, merely a perception of reality that aids survival. Premise 2: Psychology determines that the human mind does not perceive reality accurately, but perceives reality in a way that aids survival. Conclusion: Human minds have evolved.   In essence, the naturalistic argument against evolution, when taken with psychology, backfires spectacularly to prove that we did in fact evolve.  The very fact that our cognitive abilities are not reliable and not infallible is demonstrable proof that we have evolved. It's not just that we don't perceive reality accurately, it's also the way in which we don't perceive reality accurately. Human instincts are not geared to make us place bets that have the greatest odds of success, but to make bets that minimize the costs should we lose.   The very fact that Pascal's Wager works so well is proof that our brains have evolved to avoid losses, not to make accurate bets. The wager works so well precisely because it emphasizes that one will lose everything if one bets wrongly.  If there was a god, why on earth would he give us brains that appear by all accounts to have gone through a process of unguided natural selection? Wouldn't that god want to give us the best brains, so that we could think clearly and be able to better understand it and/or it's message?"

In essence, metaethics exist in the intersubjective domain.  From here, we can see that ethical models such as contractarianism, rights theory, even utilitarianism can make perfect sense as logically derived from this standard.  Even if one person is utilitarian and another a contractarian, the models that propose the best solution to satisfy our desires of 1 persist.   Clearly, by 3, laws against things like murder and rape are natural logical byproducts of these ethical theories.     edit: the reason we come to a consensus is two-fold: a) because we share in this intersubjective standard, and b) because logic and optimization are, for the sake of arguing over methodology, an objective goal-post."

The ouroboros often symbolizes self-reflexivity or cyclicality,  especially in the sense of something constantly re-creating itself, the eternal return, and other things such as the phoenix which operate in cycles that begin anew as soon as they end. It can also represent the idea of primordial unity related to something existing in or persisting from the beginning with such force or qualities it cannot be extinguished. While first emerging in Ancient Egypt and India,  the ouroboros has been important in religious and mythological symbolism, but has also been frequently used in alchemical illustrations, where it symbolizes the circular nature of the alchemist's opus. It is also often associated with Gnosticism, Hermeticism and Hinduism.  Carl Jung interpreted the ouroboros as having an archetypal significance to the human psyche.  The Jungian psychologist Erich Neumann writes of it as a representation of the pre-ego ""dawn state"", depicting the undifferentiated infancy experience of both mankind and the individual child.

DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,August3,7,Sat Jul 4 03:55:29 2015 UTC,"I use a very simple anecdote I've come up with (unless I accidentally ripped it off). I believe that morality Is all about how your actions affect other conscious creatures. So imagine the following:  I step on a bus. I'm a young man of about 30 in great health. I sit down in the only seat available; the one nearest to the entrance. At the next stop, an old man walking with a cane boards the bus. I immediately get up and offer him my seat which he gladly takes. Now I'm exhausted, but this is still ultimately a minor inconvenience to me, while being a major benefit for the man who took my seat. Plus, any physical inconvenience incurred by myself is more than offset by how I feel about having been able to do a good deed, and give my seat to someone who needed it far more than I did.   In a normal world, this action is beneficial to all, and harmful to nobody in any meaningful sense (and if I am harmed by it physically, it was only by my own consent). That's all there is to it. It was a positive action, end of story.   If you factor a god in though, then you are bringing in a 3rd party. This 3rd party isn't merely an arbitrator, he's THE decider. First of all, it makes no sense. Everyone actually involved with the situation sees it as moral, no questions asked. Invoking a god is to not make morality objective; it's to make it subject to the opinion of god. All any theist can say is ""there is no way that God would deem offering your seat on a bus as immoral"". If that's the case, then moral values are what they are regardless of any god's opinion.   Edit - TL;DR if God can't deem every action moral (like rape, where by definition the victim is hurt) then morality is what it is regardless of what god thinks."
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,WeaponsGradeHumanity,1 point,Fri Jul 3 20:13:17 2015 UTC,"Invoking a god is to not make morality objective   I've heard a lot of apologetics, so let me give a classic response to this from the religious side (to heighten your God-debate skill as well as it's just fun).  I've heard this argument from the religious: well how do you know it is actually moral, as opposed to for whatever reasons (evolution, society, personal opinion) that is what you personally want to happen?  Example: Nazis and Holocaust. They thought it's perfectly fine. Your word against Nazi's word. If there is no ultimate conscious arbiter,  you condemning them is just as much your cultural thing as them torturing and killing Jews.   Who are you to judge who of you two is actually right? You either 1) accept that one of you two is actually right (which means, there is a transcendental arbiter), or 2) resisting him is just something you would do (true moral relativism). What is your answer?  Objective moral truth cannot depend on anyone opinion, by definition, and then a fortiori cannot depend on natural causes of those. If objective moral truths do not exist, answer 2 above is automatically the correct one. Bertrand Russell realized this too, to his consternation: ""I cannot see how to refute the arguments for the subjectivity of ethical values, but I find myself incapable of believing that all that is wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don't like it.""  This is how their argument goes in a nutshell."
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,Yakukoo,2,Fri Jul 3 20:45:30 2015 UTC,"I'll take your challenge as a placeholder theist. You really do a good job at making their argument btw, and I will play your opponent from here on.   You didn't at all address my actual argument whatsoever, and have simply only created even more problems for your position.   I presented a hypothetical situation where a decision made by a person benefited another. The person making the decision willingly subjected themselves to fatigue and an increased risk were the bus to crash, or brake abruptly. However aside from a minor inconvenience and a low additional risk, everybody actually involved with the situation approved.   Using my example and the moral philosophy preceding it, the defeater to the nazi example is that the Jews were harmed by them. A party directly involved was being wantonly tortured. Even a nazi with no actual empathy when it came to Jews, would realize that the Jews themselves were being harmed.   The self defeating part of your argument was to say that ""objective moral truth cannot depend on anyone opinion by definition"". Objective morality as posited by divine command theory IS ascribing objective moral truth to one single opinion.   My challenge remains unaddressed. Is the morality of my offering a seat on a bus arbitrated by those involved, or is a third party (god) required to make that decision?"
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,miashaee,1 point,Fri Jul 3 22:31:55 2015 UTC,"So I personally have two strong objections to the argument I outlined above (none of them accepting moral relativism option as some do), but they seem to me much stronger than yours. So let me continue arguing against your objections as a faux theist, before I open my cards (or you come to another argument I'd accept).   Using my example and the moral philosophy preceding it, the defeater to the nazi example is that the Jews were harmed by them.   Any objection along these lines was addressed in the argument: anyone's philosophy or any other reasons for accepting certain position cannot be relevant to objective moral truth. Again, your philosophy against that of a Nazi, who are you to say, and so on, see above.   And yes, by the way, you didn't answer the question directly, do you choose option 1 or option 2?   The self defeating part of your argument was to say that ""objective moral truth cannot depend on anyone opinion by definition"". Objective morality as posited by divine command theory IS ascribing objective moral truth to one single opinion.   That's not self-defeating; God is not an arbitrary observer. He may issue morality at will, or he may be good as his inner property (like omnipotence), or something in between, there is a bullshit theological debate on this point; but no, this is not by itself a refutation."
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,Red5point1,1 point,Fri Jul 3 23:11:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not arguing for objective moral truth though. I never claimed that I was. I never used the term, hence I don't bind myself to the choices presented.  The problem with debating morality often does boil down to semantics. The one definition that people tend to agree on is that morality is about: what are the right things and wrong things to do in a given situation. The problem, then, is how do you define right and wrong?  A theist subscribing to hard divine command theory would necessarily define them as the will of god, and that which is contrary to the will of god, respectively. I, earlier, talked about harm vs. benefit. A theist will always bring up the issue of ""right according to whom?"". However, I presented a situation where everyone involved clearly benefitted from an action,  in every conceivable way in the immediate future (and good to neutral in any conceivable future thereafter). Hence in a situation where benefit or harm may occur given a decision, one can call it a decision with moral implications.   As far as your last point, god is an arbitrary observer. If you describe morality (or what is right and wrong) as something that he ultimately decides, then you have assigned anthropomorphic properties to god's thoughts, but ascribed a higher importance of opinion. If morality is objective, then it must be defined. There exist young earth creationists, and those who aren't. Their views are completely incompatible. The young earth creationists believe that they are right and that I am wrong. However, they know that the actual facts are not a matter of opinion. Whatever the reality is regarding a literal reading of Genesis 1-2 ( and beyond), the actual answer is an objective fact whether we can properly reach it or not. In other words, the age of the earth (among other facts) are what they are independantly of peoples' conclusions regarding them.  The topic of morality being objective vs. Subjective can only be settled if we define what morality actually means and, if you accept my earlier clarification,  what ""right"" and ""wrong"" mean. We can't decide whether a concept is subjective or objective unless we have a good definition on which we both agree.   Since theists often see morality (or the difference between ""right"" and ""wrong"") as a function of either the will, opinion,  pronouncements, nature (etc.) of a god, then they can not possibly have a meaningful conversation on the nuances and details of it with an atheist, who by definition has no belief in the god the theist requires to even define the relevant terms."
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,dblthnk,1 point,Sat Jul 4 01:26:49 2015 UTC,"how do you define right and wrong I, earlier, talked    Which is precisely the point of a divine command theorist. It's all someone's definitions. Like yours. You don't seem to grasp the core: for a divine command theorist, his own divine command justification philosophy is just as irrelevant to objective morality as everyone else's moral philosophy. You cannot in principle relate any system of morality that is someone's opinion, even if it coincides with objective one, to what is actually right or wrong. Please ingest this fundamental point, if you don't you won't be able to debate effectively.   can only be settled if we define what morality actually means   A theist's immediate response is that defining objective morality is logically impossible - because it's objective, like facts. At best you can try to figure it out.  Sorry for a short response to a long effortful post, but you seem to miss the core of the issue. I'd give you my rebuttal, but you seem too inexperienced in this particular question, frankly. And, as my practice show, morals is an even more important topic for the religious than actual metaphysics, first origins, etc. In fact, I figured I have to start with morals to be effective, o/w a person is not willing to listen, perceives the attack on God as an attack on all the fundamental values, and only becomes defensive and frustrated. So it's no light topic.   I want to boast I have so much experience I can open militant atheism club with seminars :D I'm dreaming of founding door-to-door atheism organization or some shit like that, lol. Probably I even will someday. I can really get in their mind. If I ever fall on hard times and there will be no better options, I can even be a successful evangelical pastor, I'm pretty sure. In this sub below you can find a thread where, pretending to be a theist, I successfully converted into theism either two or  three atheists and one another left in open emotional denial. But shh! don't tell anyone. By the way, I'm pretty sure I can convert you to theism too, wanna try? Or I can give you actual rock-hard arguments for atheism, which you won't hear from Dawkins and without silly holes, especially in reasoning methods.  So back to the topic. Please ingest the point I made, and also, please respond without evading: do you answer 1 or 2 or either without preference in the question I posed."
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,nicka_please,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:25:51 2015 UTC,"First, I won't answer a badly constructed syllogism.    You either 1) accept that one of you two is actually right (which means, there is a transcendental arbiter), or 2) resisting him is just something you would do (true moral relativism). What is your answer?   I don't accept the implication in parentheses on point 1, because I have a different definition of morality than you do. That is because I think that the definition of ""morality"" is frequently ill-defined when confronted in debates between theists and atheists. Point 2 is a loaded statement. I began by providing an example of a moral decision that shows the ridiculous nature of divine command theory, and have not gotten a proper response. Instead, you went to Nazis (also common in these discussions).   I have said that morality can be ill-defined. I will state right now (if I haven't already) that morality is 100% ill-defined when atheists argue with theists on moral issues. We can't proceed any further because we don't agree on the definition of morality, or moral duties, or moral values. Also, I won't accept the term ""objective morality"", unless we define what morality actually means in the first place. Your implication (in the post you made previous to this one) is that god ""may issue morality at will"". What does that mean other than him having the authority to decide what is right and wrong at any given point?"
DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,itsjustameme,1 point,Sat Jul 4 07:19:26 2015 UTC,"I don't accept the implication in parentheses on point 1   Neither do I, but I haven't claimed any definition of morality other than if it's (at least sometimes) objective. Yes, that is a bad syllogism and not my argument. Cross out there is a transcendental arbiter and replace it with there is at least sometimes objective morality, and that would be something I'd personally accept. So here you got it right, but that's not a major objection - because that syllogism can be given further elaboration (see that post of mine that I mentioned - it actually contains a mistake, on purpose, but that mistake is deep).   Point 2, however, is really correct, it's not loaded.   I began by providing an example of a moral decision that shows the ridiculous nature of divine command theory   Well it is ridiculous, but not from the example you gave. In this case, God defines that making an old man suffer is morally bad, from a divine-theorist view. It's not immediately ridiculous, Craig doesn't say anything immediately ridiculous, all his mistakes are deep.   we don't agree on the definition of morality, or moral duties, or moral values.   It is a flawed premise that we should. If morality is subject to agreement of any sort, it is relative, and we're back to the dilemma I mentioned above. If morality is objective however, we're either both wrong, or one of us is right, in any case, the basis for morality is not a subject for discussion, the only thinkable discussion we might have is whether something follows from that basis or not (think of different brands of Muslim ""scholars"").   I won't accept the term ""objective morality"", unless we define what morality actually means in the first place   A basis for marking some options among alternatives as ought to be done.   may issue morality at will"". What does that mean other than him having the authority to decide what is right and wrong at any given point?   Nothing else, yes."

Other than attacking the entire worldview, you are correct, it is bulletproof. (Edit: I should clarify that it is bulletproof if you have moral objections to God's actions. You end up with a ""and by what objective moral standard are you saying God's actions were wrong"" line. But, if you show that their arguments that prove God exist are not sound the argument becomes irrelevant or show that whatever theodicy they ascribe to is not sound, you can show that God could never perform an evil action for any reason.)  However, it has been my view that this kind of reasoning destroys morality and safety for the individual. He could be killed or tortured at anytime or be commanded to have gay sex or murder children. He is in no way guaranteed anything. What if God tricked him into believing the wrong things for a greater moral purpose and hell awaits?  None of this directly refutes the argument, but considering how much God's love and protection means to these people, they are sacrificing a lot to bulletproof their beliefs from criticism."

DebateAnAtheist,3c0q6p,Proverbs313,1 point,Mon Jul 6 22:40:50 2015 UTC,"Well, Truth and Logic were invented by humans.  So far, in the history of all humanity, we've only every observed humans regard anything as true or false, and we've only ever observed humans using logic (or human created machines).   This still leaves god as an unobserved yet to be discovered entity.  If someone posits the existence of something that is real and affects our universe, then that means the truth or falsity of the assertion of such a being's existence is subject to empirical confirmation/disconfirmation.  So far, no confirmatory evidence has yet to be discovered, and the history of humanity and the universe, insofar as we have observed, corresponds to what is expected in the absence of a god.  As for the notion that IF a god existed, it could have created the laws of physics, etc, and can violate them if it wants, then yeah, that's possible.  If I made a simulation, the rules of the simulation are mine to create and that world is mine to intervene.  Which is exactly the problem with the God hypothesis.  If a god is posited such that it intervenes in the affairs of men and the universe, then we would expect events to occur which are, as far as can be observed, completely discontinuous with respect to the prior state of the universe.  I.e., effects which seem not to be engendered by any observable cause.  We do not see this happening, so either a God/god does exist, but does not ever interfere (proving many versions of God false) or a God/god/gods do exist, but do not interfere (leaving open the possibility for certain deistic, pluralistic or other type of non-personal gods)."

Ontological arguments depends on maximally x things, and clearly by this definition god is somehow limited.    The next question becomes: how does one know that god is this way at all?    I don't see how the logically possible part leads to that.   Pretend for a moment that, instead of god, we are talking about you, and that you have the magical power to create rocks.   Clearly, it is logically possible to create rocks.  It is also logically possible for there to be a thing that you cannot lift (let's say 2000 lbs).  Therefore, it is logically possible to create a rock that is > 2000 lbs.  Therefore it is logically possible for you to create a rock you cannot lift.    However, if you define a being that can do all logically possible things, the paradox reemerges.  It is logically possible to exist, and it is logically possible to not exist.  It is logically possible to be too weak to lift something, it is logically possible to be strong enough.    Even defining God as a being that can do all logically possible things is a paradox, subject to the manner of Russell's Paradox wherein reflexive definitions are inherently paradoxical.    Therefore, god is not a being that can do all logically possible things.  The next question becomes what things, then, can/can't it do?  And why is it that a god is so limited by logic?"

It's ""anything that's possible according to His nature""  So if this being is omnipotent, and the laws of logic are in place (as the top comments suggest we agree on this), then it can't be the case that this being is and is not strong enough because that's a contradiction. It would have to be either or, not and. So if this being is omnipotent then this being is strong enough to lift any rock but a rock that is so heavy that an omnipotent being can't lift it is itself a contradiction, its absurd, its gibberish. There is no omnipotence paradox there is only a confusing question that is really just nonsense. The question itself is problematic, not the concept of omnipotence. I highly suggest you watch the video from Ozy that I linked, it addressed what you're saying here.   And why is it that a god is so limited by logic?   This question is itself a confusing question as well. Logic is not a limit. If logical truths exist then that's just the state of affairs, its not like there's this thing outside of logic that logic is the boundary of, no that's silly. Logic is just logic. It's not a limit."

Which was why I was referring to the ontological argument.  Without this, the nature of this supposed supernatural cause for the universe has no direction, and we can just as readily assume a natural source.  Do you have any other arguments for why a god must be omni-x?    It's ""anything that's possible according to His nature""   Which is tautological, because you haven't defined what ""his nature is"".  In other words, your current definition is ""he can anything that he can do"" which tells us nothing.     So if this being is omnipotent, and the laws of logic are in place (as the top comments suggest we agree on this), then it can't be the case that this being is and is not strong enough because that's a contradiction.   All this demonstrates, then, is that the supposed nature of god is inherently non-contradictory.  But that tells us nothing about which side of the noncontradiction he must exist.  Is is that he can't make any type of rock, or that there's nothing he can't lift?  Ironically, should you choose 2, 1 still is true, since a type of rock that can't be lifted by himself cannot be made by god.   The question itself is problematic, not the concept of omnipotence.    But what's missed here is that god is indeed, therefore, limited.  And this implies there are forces even beyond god.  If the paradox posed is logically possible but god is incapable of adhering to it, then god is, in some sense, bound by logic, which implies logic is an even greater or more innate force than god.  It begs the question of what logic coherency is.     Logic is not a limit. If logical truths exist then that's just the state of affairs, its not like there's this thing outside of logic that logic is the boundary of, no that's silly.   It most certainly is a limit.  How did ""the state of affairs"" come to be, and why is it that even god is limited by them?  What force or creative entity could make it such that god is limited?  The problem is, the paradox of the rock lifting is only a paradox if god is confined to a particular definition, yet that confinement is unequivocally a limit (by definition).  ""Logic is just logic"" is, in essence a brute fact even greater than god's power.  In fact, in this case it would be the very definition of limit:   a point or level beyond which something does not or may not extend or pass.   And saying so otherwise is simply contradictory."

That is all.   Ok let's just focus on your statement then, because it's obvious you mean something very different by ""logically possible""—so much so that I feel you have some preconceived notion that hasn't been elaborated on.  What exactly do you mean by ""all that is logically possible""?  As I stated before, lifting a rock is logically possible, not lifting a rock is logically possible, and making rocks is logically possible.  Let make a rock be M, and lift a rock be L. (M AND ~L) is an entirely logically sound statement, and is only paradoxical, if we let the definition be ""all things logically possible.""  So already your definition of omnipotence needs retuning.   Let me put it this way.  By your current definition: the set of things god is capable {S} of is equivalent to the set of all logically coherent actions, right?  But clearly this definition is already paradoxical, because for any logically sensible action X, there is an equally logical sensible action ~X that contradicts X in {S}.  Therefore, your definition is incomplete and necessarily limiting, since the set of all logically possible things is a greater set than any you henceforth provide.     You seem to think there is this non-logic land and logic imposes itself on our world but then there's something outside of it.   Think of it this way: if there is no non-logic land, then god is therefore limited to logic land.  It's easier for you to just admit that god is limited (or unlimited and not confined by logic), which is fine, but it begs the question as to why everything is limited.  Since non-logic land is entirely conceivable.    You can't just define something as ""not a limit"" simply because it only exists in a certain way.  By definition, without limit means one can traverse the entire space of the dimension.  You may not like the implication, but every definition of limit converges on the fact that if all that exists is ""logic land"", then god is limited by logic.   For instance, for all we know space only exists as maximally 3 dimensional.  That doesn't mean that we aren't limited by 3D space.  We are, and furthermore, anything not bound to 3D space is no limited by it."

God would both invent logic and make logic impossible in the same breath. Regarding morality, laws are pretty pointless if they don't apply to everyone.  If it's okay for god to commit genocide and it's okay for him to order his followers to commit genocide then really it's just a rule against people who aren't his followers committing genocide and, well, why should they care what someone else's god has to say?"

If objective verification is out of the question and God doesn't exist but is still real then what does that mean? The implications of God being above or apart from reason but still real are really bad for theists; there is no way to distinguish such a God's actions from the actions of a purely chaotic system. This God who can violate logic and isn't bound by any rules must be entirely undirected and completely random in the most absolute and purest form and that doesn't happen in the universe, there is no true random which we can find.

We disagree with the Nazis about their reasoning not their ultimate basic subjective stance.  Nazis still valued human life and believed that living well was ""good"".  The problem was that they didn't view Jews as equal humans deserving of rights.  So in a sense, morality appears objective because we have a shared subjective agreement (living well, human life, empathy) that is then reasoned upon in a more ""objective"" sense (such-and-such a case better suits our subjective agreement than this other case).  An example used in another thread: two fans of blues music can argue over which blues bands are better or worse.  A blues fan has no place arguing with someone who doesn't like music at all, and at such point it's obvious that there's nothing to even consider.  The only way we couldn't hold the Nazis in contempt is if they had no value for any human life, or personal well-being, whatsoever—at which case they'd be nothing more than animals and we could restrain them for not understanding.    In other words, morality only exists if everyone believes that life is valuable to begin with.  Fortunately, this subjective stance appears to be almost unanimous.     In the case of morality, everyone ""loves blues music"", including Nazis, so there's something to reason on and come to some logical optimization over."

In a sense though it is also objective in that our proteins denature and functions cease outside of certain ranges.  Morality, is the same seemingly, best handled in models and reality by Nash Equilibrium.  Notably, when group dynamics is applied, things like rape and murder are selected against, and altruism is selected for.  Of course the alleles are still in the population.  The problem is the most common mistake when dealing with morality in an evolutionary sense is that people think benefits have to solely be for the individual.  But in a pack group, what best benefits the individual AND group is selected for, demonstrably.  In that model, morality is measured in actions that effect the group and individuals.  Something is deemed good if it benefits both or the group often, and bad if it negatively impacts the group.  That is of course a gross simplification.  Defining morality that way though is essentially subjective, but no more than defining God that way.  Difference is that I recognize that and you don't.   Since you say I have no way to objectively determine morality, I can't objectively say God is moral...by definition.

You are saying that people can't determine objective morality. Then you say God can...but how can you assess that if you can't determine objective morality.   No.  That's not at all what I said or meant.  (a)  In fact, I say most people do recognize the objective moral values and duties.  We are not determinative of those moral values and duties.   Those moral values and duties are objectively real.  We recognize them universally (b) God does not determine morality as a some feature external to God.  Morality would be the moral NATURE of God.

Basically you have said God makes a non-physical morality possible, but you can't tell me what that morality is as you have set it up.  That is the point.  Even if that God exists, you would need to subjectively select if it were correct.    How do you know that child rape is bad?(I've chosen that because it's one of the few ones that people agree is immoral almost across the board, and for no other reason).  You have stated that people can't objectively say it is bad on their own.  A God under your definition can set it however it wants.  But if people can't objectively determine that standard, how do they know what it is?  In other words how do you know that your God says child rape is bad?

Under the system you suggest, us knowing morality in an objective sense is impossible, we could only know that some objective morality exists, but nothing else.  And that's being generous.   This is not what I argued. (a) You certainly can and do apprehend objective moral values and duties (as do all of us - save the psychopath).   And yet people across the world disagree.  Seriously, people use to think slavery was totally moral.    In other words how exactly does one determine objective morality for a given situation?   You cannot aim at no target.

If we wan't to go to the moon, there is no objective moon?   Um...yes.  But we MADE it a target.  The moon became our target or something to aim for.  Please tell me what objectively makes the moon a target?  Was it a target in 546 BC?  If it's objectively a target it would be.   We just make up whatever we want to be the moon according to our subjective preferences?   No.  We can call the moon whatever we want.  That's the point.  Our words are a representation of reality.    You understand in other languages the moon is not called the moon, right?  In Spanish it's luna.  Callin a bowl of ice cream the moon doesn't than take into account what we would then call the moon.  The large rocky body orbiting our planet woul not have been sat on by people sitting on the moon, formerly called a bowl of ice cream.  Language is representative.  The word moon isn't actually the moon.  You get that, right?"
DebateAnAtheist,3c1iwz,TruthMatterz2,-5,Sat Jul 4 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"""Even if that were true, which you haven't demonstrated""   Hold yourself intellectually accountable and tell me exactly why God could not plausibly be the foundation for a non-physical realm of objective moral values and duties?   What requires demonstration?   But even if true, you could never tell me what that morality is if you say that we can't determine objective morality on our own.    a)  You are using the word 'determine' to equivocate.  Our determination is not authoritative on what is morally true. My affirmation does not cause child rape to be immoral..  Yet, we can apprehend / ascertain / recognize (you use the less precise 'determine') objective moral truth.   Basically you have said God makes a non-physical morality possible, but you can't tell me what that morality is as you have set it up. That is the point.   Nope. dead wrong.  You just shifted the goalposts.   I do not need to be definitive of moral truth in order for God to be the foundation of moral ontology.   Not only have you shifted the goalposts, you are simply wrong.  There is no logical connection.  'Even if that God exists, you would need to subjectively select if it were correct.' a) So what?  You are speaking to moral epistemology while the argument for moral ontology is ontology.  You are looking at the wrong half of the equation.  You are speaking about subjectively aiming arrows without any objective target reality.  You have no objective moral 'target' NECESSARY before aiming moral arrows (subjectively) has any meaning. You need to get this strait in your mind.   You have wasted enough time focusing exclusively on the wrong half of the equation.  The argument from moral ONTOLOGY is about moral ontology (objective foundation in reality), not about our subjective moral epistemologies that lack any rational sense absent that critical ontology.   ""How do you know that child rape is bad? ""  Direct moral experience.  The same way you know raping children is objectively wrong - not morally good if the  child rapist prefers raping children. It's also how you know almost everything you know.  Direct experience.   You have stated that people can't objectively say it is bad on their own.   No!   That's not at all what I said.  Of course we can (and I do) know raping children is wrong.   I say it is objectively wrong to rape children.  Not because ""I say it"", but because it is an objective feature of reality - not a matter of subjective personal preference.    A God under your definition can set it however it wants. But if people can't objectively determine that standard, how do they know what it is?   NO.  God's nature is not 'set' however God want's, but is an objective and essential feature of God's nature (moral nature). Because (a) God has this moral nature and (b) we have free-willed souls that can apprehend this immaterial moral reality, we do have access to the moral realm and can make moral judgments. Of course, if no God exists, there is no moral realm in reality, we would be making moral judgments about non-realities that we make believe but are not true.  We would all be deluded.  In reality, there would be no moral right or wrong - if no God exists.   That's the point.   You have said the objective standard is God here. Ok, where can I study that God actually says that? Same for slavery.   What?  This is natural theology, not argument from the Bible.   Why would I send you to the Bible you don't believe to prove a point from Natural Theology?   That would be arguing in a circle and irrelevant to the argument.   In other words how exactly does one determine objective morality for a given situation?   LOL.  Look, I admire that you are trying to think this stuff through Hebrew.   I really do.   Yet, you keep asking questions that reveal mistaken notions you hold about this whole project of 'objective morality.'    That's OK, but I keep seeing the same misconceptions leading to questions that would answer themselves if you got these idea strait.   But,  at least you are engaging on the merits.   I have a lot more patience with people who are at least engaging and not just evading and BS'ing me.  The reason I laughed is that your reasonable question about 'determining objective morality' is an absolute minefield of chaos unless you understand properly everything I just discussed.  Also, I have a feeling you are confusing objective morality and absolute morality - something not yet discussed, but sure to cause confusion.  I hesitate to answer without knowing that you understand everything I just explained above.      To summarize,  Objective morality (objective moral values and duties) is a feature of reality that we all recognize.   It is not determined by us.  It is not even something we necessarily look for to discover.   Objective moral values and duties, right an wrong are presupposed as part of our reality.  Our moral experience presupposes that certain things really are objectively right and wrong - not a matter of subjective preferences.  We also objectively recognize virtues like love, kindness and tolerance to be real as well as vices like greed and hatred to be real.   This is moral ONTOLOGY.  This is the moral reality that must exist before our moral judgments or deciding right from wrong become meaningful or relevant.   There can be no moral right or wrong to even decide if no OBJECTIVE moral ontology exists.  When you speak of deciding what is objectively moral, you speaking about moral epistemology (how we know and decide what is moral).  This is the subjective, other half of the moral equation.  We certainly do have differing moral conclusions based upon how we subjectively prioritize the objective moral values and duties.    You MAY also be confusing objective morality with moral absolutes. Objective moral values and duties apply universally to persons,  not necessarily all situations.  For example, lying is wrong and both Billy and Suzy both have a moral duty to tell the truth.  Yet, suppose if Billy and Suzy could save an innocent life by lying to a murderer.     At this point, all the objective moral values and duties are still present, but we may need to do some moral calculus to know what the proper priorities should be towards the highest moral good.  At this point, Billy and Suzy may need to prioritize saving a life from a murderer, so lying becomes justified for both Billy and Suzy.   However, lying would never be OK for Billy, but not for Suzy, given the same situation.   Lying is objectively wrong for both Billy and Suzy.  The situation changed so that both Billy and Suzy could be morally justified to prioritize conflicting moral duties and lie to serve a greater moral good.  This is where subjectivity (moral priorities) enter the equation.   Than why do people disagree on moral issues?   Differing moral priorities (epistemology) concerning those objective moral values and duties (ontology).  In fairness, my use of a categorical moral wrong of child rape speaks to an objective moral epistemology,  when the subject is moral ontology - and I would never argue moral epistemology is objective.   I am just trying to eliminate all confusion that happens when people improperly conflate moral epistemology with moral ontology."

I will grant that depending on the definition of God that it is conceptually possible, but I know of no way to determine if it is actually possible.  And you'd have to define God for me.  That said, hold yourself accountable and tell me why we could not be under an 8-th dimensional entity that is pretending to be God, but that 8-th dimensional entity is under your actual God.  Basically you switched burden of proof.  You are making a claim on that God, it's on you to demonstrate it.  Dude:   Yet, we can apprehend / ascertain / recognize (you use the less precise 'determine') objective moral truth.   But you also say:   You don't have the necessary moral prerogative or objective foundation to claim anything is moral or immoral.   Those statements are completely contradictory.   Nope. dead wrong. You just shifted the goalposts. I do not need to be definitive of moral truth in order for God to be the foundation of moral ontology. Not only have you shifted the goalposts, you are simply wrong. There is no logical connection.   I literally said you didn't.  I said you then can't know what that moral truth is.  Under your system you can't possibly connect epistemioligy and ontology.  That's the point.   Direct moral experience. The same way you know raping children is objectively wrong - not morally good if the child rapist prefers raping children. It's also how you know almost everything you know. Direct experience.   Ok, now connect that to moral ontology.  That's my point.  Under your system you can't.  Tell me how I can OBHECTIVELY know that raping children is bad under your system?   What? This is natural theology, not argument from the Bible. Why would I send you to the Bible you don't believe to prove a point from Natural Theology? That would be arguing in a circle and irrelevant to the argument.   Again, how do I know what is moral in an objective sense?  I never brought up the bible.  You evaded and didn't answer the question.  You keep switching objective and subjective.  When I am talking about knowing something is wrong from here on out, I mean in an objective sense, unless I clearly state otherwise.   To summarize, Objective morality (objective moral values and duties) is a feature of reality that we all recognize. It is not determined by us. It is not even something we necessarily look for to discover.    ...and then:   When you speak of deciding what is objectively moral, you speaking about moral epistemology (how we know and decide what is moral). This is the subjective, other half of the moral equation. We certainly do have differing moral conclusions based upon how we subjectively prioritize the objective moral values and duties.   If we already know the objective standard, there is no need for subjectivity.  Again, connect epistemology and ontology and explain to me how you know they correlate.   You MAY also be confusing objective morality with moral absolutes.    The next part I 100% disagree with you on.  I adopt a situational morality.  Given the same situation, there would be a correct moral choice.  Billy or Susan lying to each other is a completely different situation than them lying to save a life.  A separate moral objective standard is in place that in all instances of the same situation would be the same.     In fairness, my use of a categorical moral wrong of child rape speaks to an objective moral epistemology, when the subject is moral ontology - and I would never argue moral epistemology is objective. I am just trying to eliminate all confusion that happens when people improperly conflate moral epistemology with moral ontology.   Again, totally following.  Now show me that moral epistemiology relates to moral ontology.  That is my point.  Under your system they can't be connected.  And if you're American, happy 4th.

DebateAnAtheist,3c1iwz,nautimike,13,Sat Jul 4 01:52:58 2015 UTC,"Until they demonstrate that their god exists and is the source of some objective morality, their unfounded assertions do not answer or solve the problem of morality.   Morality is the differentiation of intentions, decisions, and actions between those that are ""good"" (or right) and those that are ""bad"" (or wrong). We determine and label what is ""good"" or ""bad"", thereby determining the standard by which morality is measured.   Maybe morality comes from empathy, a sense of fairness, and the interaction between you, me, all of humanity. Maybe morality comes from how reality works; if you lived in a universe where being lit on fire was pleasurable and healing, it might be considered moral to lite being on fire.  Morality appears to have evolved as a useful trait in social animals and seems to be innate in babies.   I highly recommend these talks; RadioLab podcast on Morality,  Sam Harris TEDtalk on Morality, and Matt Dillahunty on Morality.  Also, I know the religious tend to claim that they get their morality from their holy texts, but, do they really?   Do Christians think slavery is acceptable and moral? It is according to the bible.   Is rape a property crime against the victim's father? According to Deuteronomy 22:28-29, if a man is caught in the act of raping a young woman who is not engaged, he must pay fifty pieces of silver to her father. Then he must marry the young woman because he violated her, and he will never be allowed to divorce her. Does that seem moral?  Should minor perceived crimes, like working on the sabbath, be punished by stoning someone to death?   If you skip dozens of moral pronouncements in a book before latching on to one that agrees with you own morality, then you are clearly not getting your moral basis from the that book.  *edit to correct grammar"

As an illustration of the problem, let's apply your reasoning to 'gravity'.     Imagine if I said one must prove gravity exists before I can say gravity is the best explanation for all these things we attribute to gravity?   If I jump off a wall and fall to the ground, then claim gravity pulled me down, would you claim that I need to prove gravity exists before I can claim gravity actually pulled me to the ground - rather than something else?    Then I pointed to the planets and orbits and massive object attractions that we attribute to gravity due 100% to the existence of gravity being the most sufficient explanation of the effects.   Would you claim that I need to prove gravity exists and deny gravity?   Mike, you are forgetting something called the principle of best explanation. Best explanation (explanatory power of what we know and explanatory scope across a range of known effects) is always KING in rational thought.    This is how we know most of what we know.   Using your previous erroneous assumption, even gravity could not be considered to be proven or true.  The ONLY way we prove gravity is that gravity provides the best explanation of known effects.   Same for subatomic particles and such.   We cannot see gravity.   We cannot touch taste or smell gravity.    We can feel gravity, but we cannot be sure it is a physical force, rather than something else.  Yet, we are fully justified to believe an actual invisible force of gravity exists despite no direct proof a force of gravity (and not something else) causes what we attribute to gravity."

Does it help or harm? How many? At what cost?  That's how.   Example: Nazis and Holocaust. They thought it's perfectly fine. Your word against Nazi's word. If there is no ultimate conscious arbiter, you condemning them is just as much your cultural thing as them torturing and killing Jews.   Not a useful example. Most didn't think it was fine. There's a reason they hid most of what was going on, even from their own people.   Who are you to judge who of you two is actually right? You either 1) accept that one of you two is actually right (which means, there is a transcendental arbiter), or 2) resisting him is just something you would do (true moral relativism). What is your answer?   See above. Who does it help? Who does it harm? How many? At what cost?   Objective moral truth cannot depend on anyone opinion, by definition, and then a fortiori cannot depend on natural causes of those, like evolution. If objective moral truths do not exist, answer 2 above is automatically the correct one. Bertrand Russell realized this too, to his consternation: ""I cannot see how to refute the arguments for the subjectivity of ethical values, but I find myself incapable of believing that all that is wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don't like it.""   In one sense, morality is objective. It's our evolved social drive to ensure others (like us) are safe and more successful. In another sense, it's subjective, since we have layered considerable legal, cultural, social, traditional, etc, baggage on this.  Understand that this is a well studied and understood subject. We have a solid idea about how and why morality and/or its precursors evolved in various social animals including humans. We have a good understanding of various stages of moral reasoning (Kohlberg, et al).  Finally, be careful of your equivocation fallacy. Subjective does not equal arbitrary.

When I hear apologists talking about ""how do you really know that x is ""immoral"", and ""there must be some objective moral standard"", I struggle to care. Science provides a sufficient explanation for our behaviour as a species without invoking some transcendental arbiter. If such a being exists, he is superfluous.  The moral argument always sets up a dichotomy between ""objective"" morality and ""subjective"" morality. This always comes with a clear explanation that ""subjective"" morality means everyone just decides for themselves what's right and wrong. My problem with this isn't that it's wrong, but that it's incomplete. Under the naturalistic model individuals ultimately do decide how they'll behave towards others... but they are also guided by culturally-transmitted standards of both behaviour and attitudes toward behaviour.  Under this model I have no difficulty condemning something like robbery as ""wrong"" because I have empathy for the victim (another trait acquired via evolution), and such behaviour is simply bad for society.

How do we know that slavery is immoral? It used to be perfectly moral, and the bible supported slavery. Were we wrong then, or are we wrong now?  Morality is not objective. Objective morality does not change over time.  But neither is morality subjective. If morality were subjective, then everyone would be perfectly moral, and immorality would not exist.  Objective/subjective is a false dichotomy.  Morality is relative. It is relative to time, place, culture, and situations. Different times had different moralities. Different cultures have different moralities.  I don't get to define morality, and neither does an arbitrary ""god"". Our collective culture does that."

Those who posit a deity show no more signs of objective moral truth or of moral behavior than those who do not. Religious people used to consider it an ""objective moral truth"" that shellfish shall not be eaten, nor meat mixed with milk. Now the descendants of those same moral traditions, for the most part, no longer believe that. So positing a deity bought them nothing in terms of objective moral truth.  Religion used to support slavery as being objectively moral, because the objectively superior slave owner took care of the objectively inferior and less capable slaves. Now most religion no longer believes that. Again, this idea that there's a deity handing out objective moral truth didn't keep the morality objective and unchanged at all.  Spanish conquistadors traveling with missionaries and priests slaughtered natives in the New World by the thousands while the missionaries and priests praised Christ at the victories of these steel-armed Christians against the helpless heathen natives. Was that the objectively moral thing to do? Rolling out the Nazis and the Holocaust example is intended to support the objective morality argument but actually completely torpedoes it. Positing a deity and an objective moral truth still doesn't enable one to know whether committing the holocaust or ending it was the true objective moral act. You're relying on today's western societal evolved opinions to make the vast assumption that committing the holocaust was immoral. So yet again, at the end of the day positing a deity and positing some objective moral truth has bought you nothing, and leaves you equally likely to commit an atrocity than to avoid committing one."

Like more conservative Christians who may agree that masturbation is immoral. A lot of people won't agree with the group of Christians, so even though it's something immoral for the Christians it won't be immoral for other groups.  And we have tiny groups like the members of the Westboro Baptist Church. In their eyes almost everything is immoral.

Life is way too full of grey areas. And as hard as it is to swallow, morality seems to be subjective.   300 years ago I wouldn't have been able to vote or own land and the religious leaders of my time would have had no problem with that. Women wouldn't work or make decisions for themselves and nobody would have blinked twice. Homosexuals couldn't live in safety let alone get married. So anyone arguing for god's objective morality would have to argue against all of these morally enlightened changes throughout history in order to support their world view as they contradict the bible. But those people were of course wrong, and we see that clearly now. By the way, isn't it funny that moral epiphanies such as these come from secular circles and not religious ones?  Now saying that morality is subjective doesn't mean that Hitler wasn't in the wrong in what he did. We understand as rational people that what he did was wrong because he made innocent people suffer. But use that critical reasoning on god's objective morality. Is anything that god does moral just because he does it? Was god moral in telling the Israelites to slaughter the Amalakites? Was he moral in telling them to take the virgins as wives? Was he moral in drowning almost everyone on earth? Was he moral in condemning people to eternal torture for finite crimes? Of course not, but theologians  spend their entire careers looking for technicalities and caveats that make god out to be moral. The bottom line is that no reasonable person can be ok with the christian god's morality. In the end all a christian can say to a homosexual couple is that god doesn't like that so its wrong. And nothing could be said regarding a jihadist's actions except that they have the wrong god. Had they been worshiping the god of the bible, their actions would be perfectly justified.   That's why its actually its a good thing that our morality is subjective and changing all the time. Now nobody is morally justified in their slavery, sexism, or bigotry. Isn't that morality, a morality that is thought out, argued and reasoned, more effective that a morality that is ""divined""?"
DebateAnAtheist,3c1iwz,maskedman3d,1 point,Sat Jul 4 02:26:41 2015 UTC,Part of it as well lies in the definition of morality.  People tend to have differing meanings on what they are talking about.  If you and I are talking about morality and we both have a different definition for the word we are ultimately talking about different things aren't we?  So before you can discuss morality you need a common definition to work from.

We understand how ethical contracts are negotiated between groups of individuals, there is a very rich study of the phenomenon of negotiation known as game theory. Not all negotiations are predicted perfectly by game theoretic systems, but the system of ethics employed by the Nazi party is a pretty obvious outlier in terms of game theory. Where systems normally tend towards a moderate or ""zero sum"" type system there were very obvious losers in the Nazi view of morality. Looking at ethics in terms of game theory doesn't give a single objective morality, but it can reveal outlier systems which don't treat humans equally and classically such negotiations are prone to collapse."

For example, physics and chemistry deal with objective facts, but there's no arbiter - scientists don't determine physical laws. Similarly, just because there's no arbiter when it comes to morality doesn't mean it's subjective - being right in a moral disagreement means being right about what one ought to do."

We don't constantly doubt our senses because they were made by evolution, or science because it's a social endeavor. Sure, they're not perfect, but that's not a problem for us either.  So why shouldn't we believe that, even if our sense of morality is derived from evolution and society, and there's disagreement in time and place, that we're not approaching some truth?   Bertrand Russell realized this too, to his consternation: ""I cannot see how to refute the arguments for the subjectivity of ethical values, but I find myself incapable of believing that all that is wrong with wanton cruelty is that I don't like it.""   Philosophy has progressed on those issues since then. Kant said that there would never be a ""Newton for a grass blade"", but in that same century Charles Darwin showed up."

DebateAnAtheist,3c1iwz,Cavewoman22,1 point,Sat Jul 4 08:54:52 2015 UTC,"The problem with the debates about morality are essentially just because of the equivocation of the christian apologist from when they are using the word ""moral"" in the argument, and when they are trying to convince you that things are moral in support of the second premise. When they support it, they say that everyone recognises that murder is immoral, so things are clearly immoral. Unfortunately, everybody actually means that murder is immoral because it hurts people (or something very similar) However, they then use this to support the fact that there are things which are moral and immoral in the argument, even though the argument uses the definition ""that which reflects God's nature"" for the word ""moral"", or at least this is what they'll typically answer when questioned with the Euthyphro dilemma. That is that saving a life isn't moral because it helps prevent suffering or anything like that, but because God has a nature that would mean that he would save a life in that circumstance. Hopefully, this equivocation is clear now. This isn't even the biggest problem with the argument though, but just necessary to talk about how they get you to miss the next fallacy; begging the question.  The moral argument begs the question. Seeing as when it says an act is moral, it means that the act reflects God's nature, we can substitute this in: 1. If God does not exist, then acts that reflect God's nature do not exist. 2. Acts that reflect God's nature do exist. C. Therefore, God exists.    From here, it should be obvious, but I'll carry on even further. Seeing as acts that reflect God's nature can only exist if God's nature exists, we can rewrite it again to become: 1. If God does not exist, God's nature does not exist. 2. God's nature does exist. C. Therefore, God exists.    Finally, seeing as God's nature can only exist if God exists, then we can rewrite the moral argument yet again, to become: 1. If God does not exist, then God does not exist. 2. God does exist. C. Therefore, God exists.    At this point, it is simply stated in premise 2 that God exists, making it abundantly clear that the argument is flawed."

Moral values: love, patience generosity, kindness, and honesty are objective moral values we all recognize.   There are many others.  Duties: We have an objective moral duty not to rape children for pleasure or murder our parents to steal their money.  The child rapist is not justified to rape children if raping children is his subjective preference. Raping children is objectively wrong - not a matter of subjective preference.    The Ten commandments are NOT moral values, but would constitute moral duties binding upon mankind.     Objective moral values have not changed over time.  We all recognize the same values today as previously.   Only our subjective prioritizations of those moral values change. This would be matter of moral epistemology that is not relevant to the moral ontology (foundation in reality) of moral values and duties - the relevant half of the equation.  BTW The Bible is not the foundation for a moral ontology.  God's moral nature would be the foundation.  Citing Leviticus would not be relevant to whether or not objective moral values and duties exist.      The fact that you are citing 'slavery' presupposes that you believe slavery to be OBJECTIVELY wrong - not a matter of subjective preferences.     Further, the Bible does not condone slavery, but recognizes that 'slavery' was the dominant social structure in pre-economic societies.    This was not the 18th or 19th century plantation slavery we think of today.

Old Testament laws regulating slavery are confusing to modern people, but in their historical context they provided a degree of social recognition and legal law protection to slaves that was advanced for its time (Exodus 21:20-27; Leviticus 25:44-46). We must keep in mind that on occasion it was an alternative to the massacre of a enemy populations in wartime and the starvation of the poor during famine times.    Being a slave was a better then dying of starvation.   There were strict laws on how a person was to be treated.  This was not the same kind of slavery you think of as American black slavery.  A slave owner in the bible could be killed by law for treating a person slave wrongly . A Mutually Beneficial Relationship Frequently was involved here.    In Bible times this was much more of an employer/employee relationship than an owner/slave situation.    Google 'indentured servitude'. Slavery, as described in Scripture, was not kidnapping someone and forcing them to work as a slave. It was what we now call indentured servitude, where people voluntarily sold themselves to pay off a debt, take care of their family, or own land (aka serfs, in this usage). It has been common throughout history, and is not the same as what we call slavery today. Kidnapping someone was punishable by death, whether you'd sold them or they escaped in some fashion; see Exodus 21:16.   Now try answering my questions."
