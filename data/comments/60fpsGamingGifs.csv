60fpsGamingGifs,3dyvie,xylotism,4,Mon Jul 20 17:29:49 2015 UTC,I really like FF14 but the texture resolutions are so inconsistent sometimes. Some things will be nice and high res but right next to it will be a low res texture. It's unsettling at times. Wish they'd beef up the PC client with higher res textures.

60fpsGamingGifs,3dyvie,GiverOfTheKarma,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:23:42 2015 UTC,Blame the PS3. Square said the 2nd expansion will be dropping support for PS3 so they'll be able to bump up stuff like texture resolutions/poly counts in general.
60fpsGamingGifs,3dyvie,omlech,1 point,Tue Jul 21 07:45:11 2015 UTC,"Watching this, I'm noticing significantly less shimmering on trees than I'm used to seeing in FFXIV.  Is this with some form of post processing like SweetFX, or maybe because the GIF is so small compared to a full screen game that I'm not seeing the shimmer?"

60fpsGamingGifs,3dtp2p,icemountainisnextome,3,Sun Jul 19 15:29:46 2015 UTC,I use Movie Maker from windows. Then i save the files as 1080P in 100k Bitrate lol. Then you use gfycat to upload your video. But you can only use a 15second video.

60fpsGamingGifs,3dstty,Simon_of_Belmonts,3,Sun Jul 19 14:00:29 2015 UTC,It's not that in the slightest. It's a lot closer to TF2 than anything else.  I'd say... I'd say you want to play Bad Company 2. People still play it on PC.

60fpsGamingGifs,3dstty,Simon_of_Belmonts,2,Sun Jul 19 22:04:32 2015 UTC,I have about 15 hours in the game and I'd say its pretty fun. Its not exactly straight up infantry warfare since all the mercs have different abilities and perks from the class cards but the effects of perks are typically very minor and do not have as large an impact on gameplay as perks in the COD series. That being said there are still some things I would like to see re-balanced but the game definitely rewards you more for having good aim and strategizing than it does for having a really badass character.

No. The regional and DLC splitting is just too much for the actual player count to be meaningful when split between game mods/map packs.  I fucking loved that game. Me and a friend put just under 350 hours into it together on PC. Sadly, the community was dying as it got fragmented due to the DLC practises, and the final nail was when they made player counts visible. Want to play CTF on EU West? Well, better hope the three other people playing it on the entire western half of the continent aren't the assholes you know from other modes. The community was small enough that the assholes became apparent from the start, just for the record.   I want to be able to play. I still have all 60whatever gigs of it installed and boot it once a month or so to see what the counts are like. I just hope that Respawn can make a more fleshed-out game next time, though they did a fantastic job with the resources they had."

60fpsGamingGifs,34vw4e,itsm0ntag,3,Tue May 5 00:32:34 2015 UTC,"Controlling something in a game @ 60fps is very different from a hands off 60fps experience. When I used a 60hz monitor, I too felt as if the videos were smoother even though I'd be playing the exact same game @ 60fps. Now that I have and use a 144hz monitor, 60fps videos seem somewhat laggier to me. I think that when you're using a higher refresh rate monitor such as 144hz, the response time is better, which ends up making everything feel and look smoother. It's kind of hard to explain."
60fpsGamingGifs,34vw4e,UZI4Y0U,4,Tue May 5 06:29:51 2015 UTC,"People say it has something to do with the minute amount of input lag you experience when actually playing the game rather than watching it, then it's also probably because of altering FPS."
60fpsGamingGifs,34vw4e,Brawler6216,2,Tue May 5 01:25:45 2015 UTC,"That's what I heard too. When you're playing there's a delay from when you perform an action to when it happens in the game, which is input lag.

But back to the topic at hand, I had the same thought as you on my subsequent playthroughs, as it felt like there was less variety in takedowns than in my first playthrough. But, like you said, it turns out that the variation I recall was in the camera angles. There's probably at least two or three different camera angles for each takedown.

60fpsGamingGifs,322tzt,Skudworth,4,Fri Apr 10 15:44:15 2015 UTC,"For a couple of reasons:  Reason 1: Habit. Many people who migrated from CSS to CSGO still do the Awp switch. In CSS you could fire more Awp rounds by firing the weapon, switching to something and then switching back faster than firing the weapon like you normally would. Now while in CSGO awp switching doesn't make you fire faster, it does get rid of being in scoped mode, which allows you to see more around you.   Reason 2: When you zoom in with the Awp, it makes noise. Switching weapons does not make noise. If you are zoomed in with the awp and unzoom it makes noise, which could give away your position. If you switch weapons to, say your pistol, you have made 0 noise and have a semi auto weapon at your disposal.  Someone correct me if I am wrong :D"
60fpsGamingGifs,322tzt,Joemartucci,1 point,Fri Apr 10 19:05:06 2015 UTC,I thought switching weapons did make noise? At least it does on my computer when I switch. Also it makes noise when the weapon is cocked or whatever lol

Eg. cap to 144fps.   Extra frames over you panel's refreshrate are not displayed , and it will increase temps with the GPU usage at 100%.  Unless you are going for the highest fps for lower input lag, although I personally think a consistent input delay would be easier to hone your skills.   That is why I cap all my games to 119fps on my 120hz panel, this also saves some GPU cycles which lower temps.  Anyway, whatever works for you. Also, sweet vid."

60fpsGamingGifs,31a1b3,chiloutus,2,Fri Apr 3 15:04:52 2015 UTC,Input lag?
60fpsGamingGifs,31a1b3,Belly3D,2,Fri Apr 3 20:57:38 2015 UTC,"Input lag is the delay between your input (kb,mouse,gamepad,etc) and seeing the results onscreen.  So the higher the framerate the quicker your actions can be shown on screen.  Example.    FPS Input Lag    30 fps 33.3 ms   60 fps 16.6 ms   120 fps 8.3 ms       On top of the base input lag is controller latency and monitor lag (how quickly the monitor can change the colour or gtg values of the pixels).  This is why 120/144hz monitors not only look much smoother than 60hz, but they also feel more responsive or ""snappy"".  Here are some articles if you would like a better explanation.   https://pcmonitors.info/articles/factors-affecting-pc-monitor-responsiveness/ http://www.anandtech.com/show/2803"
60fpsGamingGifs,31a1b3,chiloutus,2,Fri Apr 3 21:10:00 2015 UTC,"I know what it is, I was saying it as an arguement to not use Vsync. Also screan tearing is an issue too."
60fpsGamingGifs,31a1b3,Belly3D,2,Fri Apr 3 21:32:59 2015 UTC,"Well at 120hz screentear is only half as noticeable as 60hz, and most of my games don't tear anyway.  But for games that really need it, I enable Vsync and to offset it's added input lag, I cap the fps 2 frames short.  Eg. If it Vsyncs to 120hz, I will cap the fps to 118 in Nvidia Inspector. This removes pretty much all of the added lag. Also triple-buffering can reduce Vsync input lag as well.  Anyway, with Gsync & Freesync monitors gaining more traction, we should not have to worry about screen-tearing anymore."

EDIT:  To expand upon this, I just don't think 120hz monitors or Gsync/Freesync will ever become the norm, I really feel like companys will continue to push the more pixels=better idea.  But even if they did, it's at least a few years before Gsync/Freesync drops enough in price to be considered for most builds, we're looking at people who want to spend ~140 dollars on a monitor and call it a day. Now that works in the states, because tech is so so cheap compared to the rest of the world, but outside the states, technology moves a little slower."

Unfortunately, there's no NG+ and there's a point of no return where you can't faff about doing whatever afterwards... So replay value is very limited. Also, it only took me 7~ hours to get about 95% of everything.  Even though it's short and has low replay value, I can't recommend it enough.

60fpsGamingGifs,2ycdw9,AlKruseFTW,1 point,Sun Mar 8 18:31:20 2015 UTC,"The only reason I've heard its useful is that it's a consistent way to lower your crosshair, and makes the pattern more consistent - not reduced.  Otherwise, you should essentially unbind your crouch button, it turns you into a sitting duck and there are situations where it becomes useful but it starts the bad habit of limiting your mobility.   In CSGO and nearly all networked FPS there's the peeker's advantage, and in CSGO more specifically there's the defender's advantage from having a defensible stationary position where you are clearly aware of where your enemies are coming from. (this is why T weapons are stronger than CT, being Offense in the only competitive mode played in the modern game, defusal)"

If you're new to programming, try Java+LibGDX or C#+Unity first. You don't need to worry about memory management if you're only just now learning OOP.  And finally, you'll fail a lot.

I am not 100 percent sure on these numbers but they were all pretty tall orders.

60fpsGamingGifs,2w622o,finakechi,1 point,Tue Feb 17 17:36:45 2015 UTC,What's missing that would've made it a better port for you? It runs pretty well and looks great for a 5 year old game imo. Much better than I remember it looking on 360. The options are a little bare but at least the game works well
60fpsGamingGifs,2w622o,finakechi,3,Tue Feb 17 19:04:40 2015 UTC,"Mostly graphics options, and the textures leave a bit to be desired.   It's not the worst port in the world, but it's also not the best."

I've spent almost 50% of my time searching for collectables (posters, letters, and other non important things because I like to get 100% completion). The story missions are a lot of fun, and the story itself while unbelievable (you came here for one reason and now you are a leader in a revolution) is interesting. Your character is terrible, no depth to him, he just does what he's told with no complaining (at last where I am at in the game). This isn't really a huge issue because the missions are a lot of fun.   I wouldn't pay full price (because I haven't since Halo 3), but it is a great $30 game."

To be honest i just edited this in Windows Movie Maker. I used one of the fades between clips. But firstly i serperated all the kills in to their own clips. For smoothness i guess its because i used a custom save, which was 60fps, with 1920x1080, and a bit rate of 50,000. Took about 10 mins i think.  I also recorded this with ShadyPlay yes."

I'll just copy and paste my explanation from the original post:   For this I’m exploiting the slow motion cheat (Triangle, Left, Right, Right, Square, R2, R1). Enter the cheat twice to get to the second level of slow motion, speed it up to 225% (The cheat doesn’t seem to be perfectly 50%, otherwise it’d be 200%), then render at 60fps. No frame interpolation or anything, the problem is audio messes up and it’s very difficult to control in slow motion (Especially moving the camera since that doesn’t get included in slow motion).

(If you convert 120 fps to 60 fps you simply take every other frame, if you convert 144 fps to 60 fps you can't.)  Also vsync syncs to the refresh rate of your monitor, setting it to 144 fps (or 77 fps I suppose) not 60 fps."

And for $20 for a prologue mission + several side missions on a map thats sizable enough to actaully require several runs to get familiar with (and the side missions change things up well) its surprising levels of value for money at that price point.

If you like to kills thousands of enemies and feel like totally overpowered character its a game for you.  I'd say it got one of the best fighting systems I have seen (MMO-wise).  Raids are fun and challenging, certain bosses are really fun to fight with friends (Twilight Boss D Q_Q).  Sadly the game does not have much more than dungeons and raids for it. Its a HUB based MMO after all, there's hardly any exploration that needs to be done, crafting is very basic. There's no player housing, mounts, pets etc.  I have enjoyed it for a long time (Got to lvl 80 at my Vella) but once you complete the high-end items that you want, there's nothing left to do."
60fpsGamingGifs,2pqg0z,nekyo,1 point,Fri Dec 19 19:01:55 2014 UTC,I played it for 40 hours with my buddy then randomly quit. It's fun. It's like a dungeon crawler that you do dungeons over and over again for different enemies and quests.
60fpsGamingGifs,2pqg0z,PlantedChaos,1 point,Fri Dec 19 01:53:41 2014 UTC,"A friend and I took a swing at it a while ago. He fell in absolute love. I found it incredibly tedious and repetitive. You replay the same dungeons over and over and over and over again until you move on to the next part of the world, repeating dungeons again. From what I found, NPC A would hand you a quest in Dungeon A. You would go through dungeon A, complete your quest and then hand the quest back in to NPC A. After that, NPC A would tell you to go to NPC B, who would immediately tell you to go through dungeon A again, this time completing a slightly different quest in the same map. This was what killed it for me. Sometimes you'd be forced to go through the same dungeon upwards of 4 or more times, with it being the same experience every time.  Apart from the repetition of dungeons, the graphics are decent, the characters are cool enough and the skillset is enjoyable."

60fpsGamingGifs,2oul12,votequimby,7,Wed Dec 10 14:01:36 2014 UTC,"I'm not him, but the game is wonderful. Definitely for the more hardcore who love difficulty and being on edge 90% of the time; you'll get the best out of it on hard mode. Trying to survive, frantically checking corners, checking your motion tracker, and just plain out figuring where the xenomoroh is from the sounds it makes. And if you've got a love for the franchise it's especially rewarding... It's kind of amazing that they've managed to make something I love now, but seriously feared in my childhood, absolutely terrifying again. Only thing I have a real problem with is the terrible human body/facial animation. Luckily the voice acting is pretty great and makes up for it. Also, it's serious bang for your buck considering how long it is.   P.S. Amanda Ripley throws like a sissy. Aim high and stand up before you throw anything over something waist high or else terrible things will happen."

60fpsGamingGifs,2ntpxy,TheAppleFreak,1 point,Sun Nov 30 06:16:58 2014 UTC,"You see that pad on the ground? That's a traversal pad. Use these to leap quickly between any connected pad.  Traversal pads let you ride on a beam of pure music, which is really a beautiful thing if you stop and think about it.  You can also chain multiple pads together to cover more ground. Jump on the beat whenever you hit the next pad and you will continue the chain.   I was going through some of my old Shadowplay footage, and found this little clip. I figured I'd share one of my favorite aspects of the game's movement, though it kinda loses a bit of its meaning without the audio.  For the unaware, Chroma is a musically driven FPS that entered a closed alpha much earlier in the year. After a few months of testing, Harmonix shut down the alpha and began reworking the game to better fit their high-level vision for what it should be. Despite some of the game's problems, I enjoyed it greatly, and I'm really looking forwards to seeing what Harmonix has coming up."

60fpsGamingGifs,2ntpxy,Newb3,2,Sun Nov 30 10:17:53 2014 UTC,"It often got chaotic; I said in one of my other recordings that it was like a big technicolor battlefield. The high contrast between weapon trails and the background (purposely designed to be reminiscient of Tron) did get a little confusing as I'd try to find the source of whatever was trying to kill me, but god damn did it look nice.   The game had issues with weapon feel, game flow, and meaningful purpose for each class, but the musical aspect of it hooked me in a way that few other games hook me. It didn't just feel good to get a kill on the downbeat; it felt downright satisfying. Traversal pads in particular were a very popular mechanic among alpha testers, since it was usually more rewarding than jump dashing practically and it added an additional music track that sounded quite nice. They had their issues as well (there were balance issues around how they would make you invincible, and god help you if you tried starting a pad jump if you didn't jump on the beat) but they were so damn fun to use and had a good practical use.  We haven't heard anything else from Harmonix other than ""we're working on it;"" I'm very eagerly anticipating what will come next."

Steam also usually has a pretty solid Star Wars bundle going up around that time too. Its a great buy if you don't have those games. http://store.steampowered.com/sub/25772/  But the game itself? The story is fantastic. The character dialogue between themselves is great. The friendly AI is pretty good. They actually kill stuff unlike the AI in COD and Battlefield. The game is a ton of fun and can be very challenging at points. If you like Star Wars and shooters I  think you'll enjoy it a lot.

60fpsGamingGifs,2mz924,shadow90z,2,Fri Nov 21 12:17:37 2014 UTC,I record with Shadowplay @60 fps and then to shorten the clip I just use Windows Movie Maker. I have a preset for 60 fps and bitrate to match Shadowplay.
60fpsGamingGifs,2mz924,SakuraSiri,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:29:20 2014 UTC,What do you mean by preset and bitrate?
60fpsGamingGifs,2mz924,lll_1_lll,2,Fri Nov 21 20:32:26 2014 UTC,"Bitrate is another word for quality.  Preset is a set of rules for the video to save in, meaning when you're done editing it and want to export it, you choose to put it into 60 FPS 1080p."

60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,murphs33,1 point,Fri Nov 21 10:09:47 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I don't know. I'm pretty sure the older ones were usually 60FPS in multiplayer as a point of emphasis, but I couldn't tell you anything really for certainty."

60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,xi_mezmerize_ix,1 point,Fri Nov 21 14:36:09 2014 UTC,Tips: Try to hipfire more often. You zoom in too often when in close proximity.  Use K+M. The only way to get better is to practice.
60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,xi_mezmerize_ix,0,Fri Nov 21 14:42:01 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I always start with K+M til I get frustrated, which probably happens quicker than it should. Zooming in is habit for me, I feel like I have no idea where I am shooting hipfire even though I know it is generally the middle of the screen. If I had one of those monitors with the crosshairs overlayed I might be able to break the habit of always pulling up."
60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,MinnesotaFTW,1 point,Mon Dec 8 02:14:14 2014 UTC,Why do you need a monitor with crosshairs on it when the game has crosshairs?
60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,ToothGnasher,0,Fri Nov 21 17:01:12 2014 UTC,"Yeah... I dunno, I don't really notice those, I need something with a dot in the middle or just tigher. My brain is weird."
60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,Xaguta,1 point,Fri Nov 21 17:13:49 2014 UTC,The problem with that is it conflicts with the actual spread of your bullets. A dynamic crosshair that expands with greater bullet spray is more helpful then a fixed dot that doesn't reflect your actual accuracy.
60fpsGamingGifs,2myksk,BaconOP,0,Fri Nov 21 17:56:25 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I understand that, if I could have both that would be great. I just don't see where I should be placing my aim when I'm in the thick of it. Regardless how big the spread is, I'm probably going to center my aim in the same place, so knowing that center point would be useful to me."

60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,EndlessRagdoll,3,Mon Nov 17 00:41:21 2014 UTC,I just torrented it to check how it would run after having some issues with unity. I had some strange mouse issues so i stopped.  the port seem fine otherwise.
60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,EndlessRagdoll,1 point,Mon Nov 17 02:35:20 2014 UTC,Awesome. I was a huge fan of 3 and this looks like a pretty good installment.

I've been using a gamepad so haven't noticed any control issues. In terms of performance, I'm using a 2011 GPU (Radeon 6950) and it runs at about 35fps with some setting on high, some on medium. It still looks fantastic so I'm not complaining and my GPU is getting quite old."

60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,peatymasta,3,Sun Nov 16 22:50:53 2014 UTC,Well if that were the case wouldn't every month be good? Or do you judge it on the salesmanship of new releases?
60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,imaspaghetti,1 point,Mon Nov 17 01:44:55 2014 UTC,Every month is normally a good month for games especially if you play pc there's always good games and great deals on there. I own a pc but i personally enjoy console gaming more and after quite a long dry spell for me these last 3 months have been especially kind lots of releases i have enjoyed for countless hours. Not to mention Tuesday brings 4 more solid looking releases to further my library and happiness.
60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,peatymasta,5,Mon Nov 17 01:57:13 2014 UTC,"I suppose you're right in some ways. Gaming is really insanely amazing these days, and I think we've been spoiled in some ways. people seem to get a little too up in arms over the performance of a game at ultra1080p60. If you can't get it on a good rig, just accept that the game doesn't run that way, and try to enjoy it despite that.   I like your attitude."
60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,imaspaghetti,2,Mon Nov 17 03:34:08 2014 UTC,"Its like i said in a thread about boycotting Ubisoft people should just play the games, if they did that then the companies wouldn't feel the need to lie and cheat. They say what they need to to sell the product and when people make a big deal about every little thing the truth basically disappears. Just play what you love and love what you play the rest shouldn't matter."
60fpsGamingGifs,2mh5ta,peatymasta,1 point,Mon Nov 17 04:41:34 2014 UTC,"I mean. It's really about buying a game you'll like.

Showdown however, is pretty bad with a wheel (i.e. there being no clutch/manual shifting) I have played showdown and love it but I'm waiting to get a job so I can buy a wireless receiver for my Xbox 360 controllers or just a wired 360 controller for my PC."

Grenades blowing up as soon as they hit someone, kicking people in the face, running around with your gun put away to go faster.  It was fun, and the MP was free.

60fpsGamingGifs,2lkayo,dreadredheadzedsdead,2,Fri Nov 7 17:59:33 2014 UTC,"2 had a much creepier vibe.  This one was mainly to get the last out of the hype, put out a game that appealed to the most people they could attract, and get out of the franchise (except the f2p that just came out).  That being said, I still enjoyed it for what it was."
60fpsGamingGifs,2lkayo,CapControl,1 point,Fri Nov 7 18:03:22 2014 UTC,Oh definitely I agree. There's one part in the second game early on that made me realize it was going to be twice as terrifying as the first one. I don't want to spoil it for others though.

60fpsGamingGifs,2li81v,danaholic86,3,Fri Nov 7 02:42:36 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I made the deadzone as small as possible, but its an old wheel that has weak springs that make it hard to keep the wheel centered."

It's usually just some thing in the background."
60fpsGamingGifs,2lforn,Winters323,3,Thu Nov 6 04:42:25 2014 UTC,You could save the video in gfycat (right click) and open with vlc as your method.

60fpsGamingGifs,2l8b8t,Ryanc621,12,Tue Nov 4 04:15:32 2014 UTC,Is that 60fps? Doesn't feel like it on my computer.  Nice shot nonetheless!
60fpsGamingGifs,2l8b8t,Walk_Yo_Dinosaur,5,Tue Nov 4 19:11:15 2014 UTC,"Agreed, this looks like 30fps. Maybe gfycat compressed it to 30fps?"

60fpsGamingGifs,2l40i5,Pejorativez,2,Mon Nov 3 10:05:49 2014 UTC,"It's a dm server.  The point is to practice aim, not go for objectives.  You get hp back for kills, so headshots give you more hp than body shots.  It's incentive to go for the headshot, and you get your ammo back for a kill.  That way, you stay alive longer, and can practice for longer.  Edit:  Forgot to mention the ammo jumping down to 7 is when I switch to my deagle."

If you get a bad ping, or if you get a good ping but experience lag anyway, consider checking your local connection setup - e.g. good ping with lag is a symptom of jitter, which is experienced over a shitty wifi connection.

60fpsGamingGifs,2kqekt,PercivalJBonertonIV,3,Thu Oct 30 02:47:19 2014 UTC,Hmm. This game reminds me of Dark Souls. What's it like OP?
60fpsGamingGifs,2kqekt,Spazicle,5,Thu Oct 30 05:59:53 2014 UTC,"It feels more weighty than Dark Souls. When you hit an enemy with a big ass hammer, they look like they've been hit by a big ass hammer. All the mechanics of 3 speed rolls, and stamina and healing potions that reset at every checkpoint are still there. In Dark Souls, if you attack with a millimeter of stamina left in the bar it will do full damage, but in Lords if you don't have the stamina the attack normally requires then it does less damage.  It also feels a little like the Witcher 2 combat in the sense that you get spells you can sort of ""built in"" to your character. The hitboxes are also beautifully made, as you can see in the gfy. I could go on, but I'm at work so I recommend you watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oROMuRvRLps.  It's about an hour of gameplay with a competent Souls veteran on the controls and a dev talking him through it. It's what sold me on the game."
60fpsGamingGifs,2kqekt,Spazicle,0,Thu Oct 30 09:26:29 2014 UTC,It definitely looks like a game I'd be interested in. Unfortunately I don't have a next gen console and I doubt my laptop could handle it. Oh well. Thanks for telling me though.

60fpsGamingGifs,2k8d6f,Tru3Gamer,6,Sat Oct 25 09:36:37 2014 UTC,"I know those map types and this game does look to follow that concept, but I think he is simply referring to how he jumps in the air and turns like one would do on a surf map."

60fpsGamingGifs,2jxnfk,migszxc,1 point,Sun Oct 26 16:19:44 2014 UTC,"It's entirely possible, only if you can output 120fps. You don't need a 120Hz monitor to be able to, because recording games takes the frames from the game itself, not from the monitor. So if you're pushing out 120fps from the game, you'll be able to record that fine.  However, you'd need to record with a different program as, like you mentioned, ShadowPlay only supports up to 60fps. Bandicam and Fraps work great, I myself use BandiCam with the NVENC encoder or the built in NVIDIA h264 encoder in my graphics card.   Be prepared for GIGANTIC file sizes.

60fpsGamingGifs,2jryl8,bordje,5,Mon Oct 20 11:41:29 2014 UTC,"https://gfycat.com/UnrulyPessimisticAnemoneshrimp  https://gfycat.com/SlushyAgonizingHerring  This is the awesome AT4 rocket launcher from Battlefield Bad Company 2 and probably my favourite one from any game. It was unique in the sense that the missiles were guided by the mouse mid flight, but they were unavoidable. The learning curve was pretty tough, since you had to evaluate the distance and therefore time to adjust the trajectory, but once you get a grip using it you can instantly eliminate any enemy choppers. Another thing that makes it tough is the fact that the pilots hear a beeping noise if there is missile coming at them regardless of it is locked on or not, so there is kind of art to adjusting at the last minute to catch them by surprise."

60fpsGamingGifs,2jkp1n,m4tic,3,Sat Oct 18 18:23:54 2014 UTC,"no driver view, no 24 le mans end season race, in my opinion simplified graphics, replay system wasn't as fun, feels super arcadey (even more than 1) unpredictable and inconsistent, i want all assists off. to me grid 2 doesn't feel as epic as grid 1.  With that said my whole experience with both games is on xb360; so I'd be willing to give another go on my PC."
60fpsGamingGifs,2jkp1n,m4tic,2,Sat Oct 18 20:25:02 2014 UTC,"I agree.  The fact that the cars are set for drift, grip etc. takes away from it w/ me, b/c cars like the nsx shouldn't be so floaty on the road, where the slightest turn sends you flying.

Halo is one of the most competitive, well tuned, and gameplay customizable (for consoles) shooters out there. It really BELONGS on PC but MS knows they need it to sell consoles.

60fpsGamingGifs,2j9019,notbob-,1 point,Tue Oct 14 20:42:14 2014 UTC,The point of a GFY is that it can be any common video format and will be a .gif if the browser doesn't support HTML5.  I recommend uploading an MP4 personally.
60fpsGamingGifs,2j9019,KumajirouSan,1 point,Fri Oct 17 17:01:17 2014 UTC,Yeah I've figured out how to use it now.

60fpsGamingGifs,2j17d0,misnichek,2,Mon Oct 13 07:06:55 2014 UTC,I use 2xMSAA
60fpsGamingGifs,2j17d0,misnichek,2,Mon Oct 13 07:09:28 2014 UTC,Oh. I used 4xMSAA and 8x ansitropic.
60fpsGamingGifs,2j17d0,misnichek,4,Mon Oct 13 07:14:52 2014 UTC,"Well.. I use 16x anisotropic haha. Anisotropic almost never takes any FPS away.  And the difference between 2x and 4x should be minimal, because the game is so foggy."
60fpsGamingGifs,2j17d0,SweatyChocolateCake,1 point,Mon Oct 13 07:19:12 2014 UTC,So i just booted the game with 2xMSAA. Usually main menu gets 50 fps with 4xMSAA. Now 70.

Usually I average 14 fps when I am fighting in an area that is moderately populated. Any idea why this is happening? I can only think of the recent updated which caused some performance issues. I am on maximum graphics, and for some reason when I turn my settings lower I actually get worse FPS..."
60fpsGamingGifs,2iy7b7,TheRagingHerp,2,Sun Oct 12 03:35:56 2014 UTC,"Yep, Planetside doesn't make proper use of more than 2 cores. Anything above that will give You very small or no performance boost. Phenoms have clock-to clock a bit better performance than Bulldozers, but Bulldozers overclock much better. At this time You won't have good gaming experience with any Phenom, since it won't go over 4 GHz. Some people report good framerates with AMD FX clocked over 4,5 GHz. But if You consider PS2 an important game for You, better go for new i5 or i7 with good cooler, then overclock it. And remember, for planetside clock and single core performance is much more important than number of cores, as for now. Today Intel have single core performance better than AMD."

Having a shield makes it great because you can get people before they do any major damage, meaning you can survive the caber, and with a charge crit you can take out Heavies in one hit.  And you may ask, ""Why not the Tide Turner?"" and the answer is because the Pyro resistance is delicious.

60fpsGamingGifs,2isow4,Crabbo,3,Thu Oct 9 21:24:17 2014 UTC,So the impression I get about this game so far is just mash attack until enemy is dead. Can someone enlighten me how the game works?
60fpsGamingGifs,2isow4,piszczel,8,Thu Oct 9 22:22:40 2014 UTC,Dynasty Warriors is based on the book Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. The book is half history and half fiction.   Its set in the Three Kingdoms period of China and you take control of the various generals that fought the battles. Its a hack and slash game where killing 1000 enemies in a single battle is the norm. Putting together combos of attacks damages your enemy and protects you from getting an ass whooping.   I would describe it as a cult game. The people who like it are very passionate about it and really get into the game while others will pass it by as some crazy Japanese game.   The graphics aren't the best and it has its bugs but something about it just keeps me going. I find that because of the wide array of characters in the game you find the ones you like and you find the ones you don't. The characters are fairly varied so there is hopefully something for everyone.

60fpsGamingGifs,2iomuk,ImperialMarine,1 point,Thu Oct 9 20:43:34 2014 UTC,relevant /r/60fpsporn NSFW
60fpsGamingGifs,2iomuk,Winters323,2,Fri Oct 10 20:43:12 2014 UTC,Why is the quality of yours so good compared to mine? did you record in 1080p then render in 720p? looks so good
60fpsGamingGifs,2iomuk,meta_asfuck,8,Wed Oct 8 18:57:39 2014 UTC,"Yeah, I have a bunch of old 1080p ShadowPlay recordings I had lying around, I then re-rendered them in Vegas to 720p.   Just trying out a ton of stuff, to find the best solution for this whole Gfycat / 60FPS GIF thing. Hopefully so others can benefit."
60fpsGamingGifs,2iomuk,Junit151,2,Wed Oct 8 19:01:25 2014 UTC,Appreciate it!
60fpsGamingGifs,2iomuk,Kellogz_killer,2,Wed Oct 8 19:07:58 2014 UTC,Well damn. Everytime I load a .mp4 into gfycat it gets compressed to hell and looks terrible.
60fpsGamingGifs,2ip0vm,JoshuaHMB,7,Wed Oct 8 20:31:56 2014 UTC,The animations in this game are phenomenal.
60fpsGamingGifs,2ip0vm,ImperialMarine,2,Wed Oct 8 20:41:17 2014 UTC,Indeed.
60fpsGamingGifs,2ip0vm,CapControl,2,Thu Oct 9 02:25:58 2014 UTC,Its honestly what makes the game so fun.
60fpsGamingGifs,2ip0vm,piszczel,3,Thu Oct 9 19:01:39 2014 UTC,"For the best 60 fps experience view this in Internet Explorer, Chrome seems to degrade the GIF slightly."
60fpsGamingGifs,2ip0vm,greegrok,1 point,Thu Oct 9 08:30:24 2014 UTC,"Now that's a high quality weebum. What did you use to record it? Shadowplay compresses videos, this looks sharp."
60fpsGamingGifs,2ip0vm,aleluya17,1 point,Wed Oct 8 21:55:55 2014 UTC,"I recorded a 15 second clip with shadowplay at these settings and uploading the direct mp4 file to gfycat. no changes have been made, just using the raw compressed file by shadowplay. I use a 970 so now sure if that makes a difference."
60fpsGamingGifs,2iot5a,Jaxen404,2,Wed Oct 8 19:26:25 2014 UTC,Very underrated game. The story isn't that good but who cares cause the action is great and the guns are awesome.
60fpsGamingGifs,2iot5a,Leveh,1 point,Fri Oct 10 02:57:26 2014 UTC,It won 2004 shooter of the year from PC gamer I think
60fpsGamingGifs,2iot5a,inthedeepthought,1 point,Sat Oct 11 10:09:16 2014 UTC,"I have never heard of this game, what is it?"
60fpsGamingGifs,2iot5a,ImperialMarine,6,Wed Oct 8 19:42:58 2014 UTC,"It is great old school shooter where you are slaughtering hundreds of undead/monsters. And it uses Havok engine for ragdoll physics and destruction of some objects. In my opinion it is really worth buying and it is very cheap now (it's 10€ on Steam, but I remember that I bought it for something like 4-5€, so you can wait for some sale). It's 10 years old, but it still looks nice and you can run it on pretty much every computer now. And there is demo available on Steam so you can try it."
60fpsGamingGifs,2iot5a,ImperialMarine,3,Wed Oct 8 19:50:30 2014 UTC,Will check it out.
60fpsGamingGifs,2iot5a,WatsonJohnWatson,1 point,Wed Oct 8 19:52:18 2014 UTC,It has a stake gun... and a chaingun rocketlauncher...

60fpsGamingGifs,2io7pr,Napalmero,3,Thu Oct 9 08:26:31 2014 UTC,Apologies for the spamming. Just trying out various things and trying to fill up this sub a bit. Hope people don't mind.
60fpsGamingGifs,2io7pr,ImperialMarine,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:24:24 2014 UTC,"keep them coming! will be uploading one soon, just one question is it possible to upload a clip to gfycat that is more than 30 seconds?"
60fpsGamingGifs,2io7pr,ImperialMarine,2,Wed Oct 8 16:41:05 2014 UTC,"No, I don't think so. I just tried uploading something running 22 seconds but got an error, 15 seconds is the upper limit."
60fpsGamingGifs,2io7pr,Runichavok,1 point,Wed Oct 8 16:47:52 2014 UTC,"Damn, well gonna have to cut half my clip off :("

60fpsGamingGifs,2ioi21,bordje,1 point,Thu Oct 9 07:55:51 2014 UTC,"I disabled the HUD, so the UI stops updating."
60fpsGamingGifs,2ioi21,bordje,2,Thu Oct 9 08:04:47 2014 UTC,CPU heavy?
60fpsGamingGifs,2ioi21,bordje,0,Thu Oct 9 08:06:54 2014 UTC,"Not really, it just makes it look nicer, better for editing etc"
60fpsGamingGifs,2ioi21,TheAppleFreak,3,Thu Oct 9 08:10:23 2014 UTC,"Wow, I'd be lucky to achieve 60FPS in Planetside 2 let alone record a gif in it. That said, I haven't really tried it with this new PC."
60fpsGamingGifs,2ioi21,snacksbuddy,2,Thu Oct 9 09:57:38 2014 UTC,"This was recorded on the public test server, so there was less people. This game is more CPU intensive than it is GPU intensive, so with less players it performs a lot better.  Tip: Bumping up the graphics to maximum actually offloads some of the work from the CPU to to the GPU, which improves performance.  Specs:   i5 3570k GTX 660 8GB RAM"
60fpsGamingGifs,2ioi21,TheAverageOne,2,Thu Oct 9 10:02:05 2014 UTC,Noice! I'm running a 4670k and 770 with same RAM so I'll get back to reinstalling it and pushing that shit to the limit.
60fpsGamingGifs,2inli5,Sethos88,1 point,Wed Oct 8 12:41:42 2014 UTC,Damn I need this game!
60fpsGamingGifs,2inli5,ImperialMarine,1 point,Wed Oct 8 12:46:34 2014 UTC,Best racing game i'v ever played.

60fpsGamingGifs,2inli5,Crabbo,1 point,Thu Oct 9 00:03:23 2014 UTC,Well that really didn't work out well for the 93 car. Went from 2nd to 9th!
60fpsGamingGifs,2inli5,The-Oncoming-Storm,1 point,Thu Oct 9 09:23:33 2014 UTC,I miss GRID... This game looks like fun
