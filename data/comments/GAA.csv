Keith Higgins would be in with a shout for me too. Otherwise, pretty solid list.   What about most underrated players? T. Parsons, D. Walsh and F. McGlynn would be up there for me."

GAA,3e4qx8,dovacian,1 point,Wed Jul 22 09:58:42 2015 UTC,Ya I don't know. He's a great player but he didnt have a good game the last day which says to me that he isnt at his best yet. His free kicks have been outstanding this year though
GAA,3e2s3o,dovacian,2,Tue Jul 21 14:51:40 2015 UTC,"Not saying that I would have voted for him, but I think Killian O'Connor should be included. Even if he doesn't win it, he deserves to be an option."
GAA,3e2s3o,nfing,1 point,Tue Jul 21 16:28:47 2015 UTC,Very true. I probably should have put him in anyways since im a mayo man but i was going on current form and trying to pick one player per county. Now that i think about it I definitely should have put him ahead of Damien Comer even though he is playing very well at the moment
GAA,3e2s3o,3hrstillsundown,2,Tue Jul 21 17:26:46 2015 UTC,I put down McManus because I think he's the form player in the country at the minute. But O'Shea/Murphy have more pedigree.
GAA,3e2s3o,ringboard,2,Tue Jul 21 18:41:36 2015 UTC,McManus really showed his worth the last day. A real leader. I voted for O'Shea because at the moment it looks like he can do anything
GAA,3e2s3o,ringboard,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:24 2015 UTC,"Would like to see o shea, be man marked by neil mcgee, vincent corey, or rory o carroll , to test how good he really is. We have seen all the others play in man marked conditions"
GAA,3e2s3o,FlickMyKeane,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:40:50 2015 UTC,Ya Mayo will more than likely be playing Donegal in the quarter finals so O'Shea will be marking McGee so that will be his big test!

GAA,3dz7ky,jmmcd,3,Mon Jul 20 20:59:24 2015 UTC,"From what I could tell there were 2 restrictions on the draw for each section. A provincial final pairing could not happen again in the quarter final under any circumstance, and where possible, pairings that had already taken place in earlier rounds of the championship will be avoided, which left the above possibilities so no draw will be needed from here on out I think. I'm pretty sure that was by design."
GAA,3e0fbt,ringboard,5,Tue Jul 21 00:17:29 2015 UTC,"Wexford hurlers, perhaps not anymore I guess after their (predictably) terrible showing this year but last year they were massively over hyped. They failed to beat 14 man then 13 man Clare in normal time then got a flukey enough win against Waterford only to be humiliated by Limerick, I fail to see how that is some sort of revival of Wexford Hurling."
GAA,3e0fbt,ViolentlyCaucasian,2,Tue Jul 21 10:03:16 2015 UTC,"Wexford are massively over hyped. They beat Clare last year and should have beaten Clare the year before when they played them in the quarterfinals.   Personally I feel Clare are the most over hyped hurling team in the country. Yes there is real talent in the squad but they are not at the level of Tipperary, Kilkenny or Galway."
GAA,3e0fbt,As_Bearla_,2,Tue Jul 21 13:37:27 2015 UTC,"They're lacking at the back and a little thin at midfield as evidenced by their struggles this summer without Galvin. They're also vulnerable to big bullying sides like Limerick or Wexford. However in terms of raw ability there's is more hurling in that team across the board than in any other county bar maybe Tipp, even accounting for the persistent injuries and missing players (Cunningham, McGrath, Collins). They're atleast at the level of Cork and Galway, haven't had the chance to prove themselves against Tipp or the Cats. They're 1 solid back and 1 ball winning half forward away from the best on paper squad in the country. They've under performed the last 2 years but have gone out on narrow scorelines accompanied by subpar displays or sendings off."
GAA,3e0fbt,ViolentlyCaucasian,1 point,Tue Jul 21 13:49:34 2015 UTC,"But 1 win in 11 since winning an Ireland. They've never proven themselves against Kilkenny, Galway or Tipperary. Another year and that all Ireland will become an albatross around their necks. They've become a team of what ifs, wasted youth and what went on behind the scenes.   I hope I'm proven wrong but Galway are prime example of good players don't make good teams. It's 27 years since Galway won an all Ireland and counting."
GAA,3e0fbt,As_Bearla_,1 point,Tue Jul 21 14:31:53 2015 UTC,"Where are you getting 1 in 11 from?  As I said other than in the league (where since the 2013 win they have beaten KK and Tipp) they haven't met Kilkenny, Tipp or Galway, so it's a bit unfair to say they haven't proven themselves against them. Bit like saying Shefflin never proved himself against Christy Ring.  Another year or 2 and people can start sounding the alarms but as of now their problems appear purely mental. Accounts from earlier in the championship had them giving top teams terrible flaking in challenge matches just couldn't seem to pull out those kinds of performances when needed. On form they're unquestionably a top 3 team"

GAA,3e0fbt,ViolentlyCaucasian,4,Tue Jul 21 14:51:53 2015 UTC,For this year the two biggest disappointments were probably Roscommon and Armagh. Both were tipped to go far in the championship and they both went out very tamely early on.

They tackled anything that moved and gave the Rossies no time on the ball. Roscommon were shite but that doesn't mean that Sligo didn't play well that day.  Today, on the other hand, was an unmitigated disaster from the throw in."

GAA,3du8mi,Jarl_of_Ireland,4,Sun Jul 19 15:46:18 2015 UTC,Game over very early disappointing even though I guess didn't really expect much. At least a 20-25 point turnaround anyway..

GAA,3cqoov,Niall8100,2,Mon Jul 13 16:22:20 2015 UTC,"If they get through Fermanagh, which isn't guaranteed as they have improved a lot themselves this year, they have to hope to get Westmeath(no disrespect to them but being realistic) in the 4th round because they won't beat either Cork or Kerry.

You are right, They will be hoping to draw Westmeath in the next round and they have a 50% chance of getting Westmeath. Either them or the Munster losers who they will be hoping to avoid.  I feel Roscommon would beat Westmeath and go to an All Ireland 1/4 final.  That's probably where it ends as it's either the Dubs or Kerry there. Roscommon are dangerous but against the 2 best teams in the country their chances are slim to none"

GAA,3cqaka,a34tjkx,12,Thu Jul 9 22:30:29 2015 UTC,Cusack or Hogan stands follow the sideline of the pitch and definitely the better option for a neutral fan. It'll give you the best view of the pitch. Hill 16 and the Canal End are behind the goal and not the best to watch the game from.   Hill 16 is traditionally a Dublin stand but opposing and neutral fans are more than welcome there too. Tickets are cheaper but you do stand for the game.   You shouldn't have any issue with safety in the crowd as GAA fans mix quite well.   Hope you enjoy it!!
GAA,3cqaka,anfearg,6,Thu Jul 9 23:02:48 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help-- this is exactly what I was looking for. As long as the weather looks decent, I think my wife will be on board!"
GAA,3cqaka,schutjezelf,6,Fri Jul 10 07:58:45 2015 UTC,"Basically, seating area (Hogan, Cusack and Davin stand) is neutral area. You will see supporters from both sides there and it's not a sport with hooliganism or hostility that would make it unpleasant for you to watch.  Standing area (Hill 16 and if it is busy also Nally stand) will be 95% Dublin supporters, but perfectly fine to attend as a neutral as well.   If you want to see the match properly go to the Hogan or Cusack stand, if you prefer to be between the fans for the atmosphere go to Hill 16. I personally moved to the Hill after 2 years on the Hogan Stand because I am not a neutral viewer and preferred the atmosphere between Dublin fans (instead of hearing your neighbour cheer for the other team).   In any case, I hope you manage to convince the missus and have fun. It will probably be a one sided match but Dublin is playing very attractive Football at the moment, so plenty to enjoy."
GAA,3cqaka,ViolentlyCaucasian,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:05:22 2015 UTC,"Thanks for your help. It sounds like Hogan and Cusack are the most popular suggestions. Obviously I'd enjoy watching something a bitbit more competitive, but I'll have to take what I get. I'll have fun as long as we make it out there!"
GAA,3cqaka,new-account9,5,Fri Jul 10 08:00:48 2015 UTC,Football and Hurling aren't really like some other sports where fans are specifically segregated everyone is generally mixed about in the stands depending on how they got their tickets. For the Leinster final the crowd will likely be mostly Dublin and the Hill will always be Dublin dominated except for All Ireland Finals. Best views are from the Hogan and Cusack stands as others have said. You should be able to buy tickets on the morning of the match at the vans around croke park but it would be a better idea to buy them ahead of time

GAA,3colli,tsetseflier,5,Thu Jul 9 15:23:16 2015 UTC,Cathriona Mc Connell (Donaghmoyne & Monaghan)  Caoimhe Mone (Truagh & Monaghan)  Geraldine McLaughlin (Termon & Donegal)
GAA,3colli,bkdleg,2,Thu Jul 9 19:40:50 2015 UTC,+1 on Caoimhe Mone. Exceptional footballer
GAA,3colli,CaptainSpaceButt,3,Fri Jul 10 17:35:01 2015 UTC,It has to be Geraldine Mc Laughlin. 25-35 in the club championships last year.
GAA,3colli,MrBeanGenius,1 point,Thu Jul 9 22:52:17 2015 UTC,Briege Corkery or Cora Staunton
GAA,3co5h5,briano93,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:42:31 2015 UTC,"Well that looks nice and all, but IMO it would be an attempt to fix something that ain't broken (the All Ireland Championship) and make something that is broken (the club fixture calendar) even worse."

GAA,3cg6z6,meandthebiz,0,Thu Jul 9 19:49:50 2015 UTC,Typical money grabbing GAA. If hurling and football ever went global they'd be as corrupt as Fifa
GAA,3cg6z6,SolidSnake1995,7,Tue Jul 7 22:56:50 2015 UTC,"Lets not descend into that shit here. I don't want to have to post the GAA's financial reports for the 400th time. Whatever about the seating arrangements for this match, go look it up and see are they money grabbing. Moronic at times yes, money grabbing, no."
GAA,3cg6z6,barbar84,3,Tue Jul 7 23:19:31 2015 UTC,"Bullshit. It's incompetence, not corruption. The season ticket was actually well run about 3/4 years ago and is still ridiculously good value. These cockups are becoming all too common though."

GAA,3ccejg,tsetseflier,4,Mon Jul 6 20:38:17 2015 UTC,"You should read up on the shitstorm regarding hola from the past month. Most of the browsers stopped supporting it as it was turning your machine into a bot and leaving you wide open to people abusing your connection with things like kiddie porn. You should scrub hola completely from your system immediately.   Unfortunately, as far as I can tell there is nothing available to replace it besides gaago."
GAA,3ccejg,davdev,2,Tue Jul 7 00:16:25 2015 UTC,Oh I've read up on it. Decided it was a risk worth taking to watch Des and the lads :-/ Have tried like three other similar extensions without success either so it looks like it might be time to pass a hat around the gaff for GAAGO.
GAA,3ccejg,davdev,2,Tue Jul 7 01:46:25 2015 UTC,"If it makes you feel better, the picture quality on GAAGO is vastly superior to the RTE stream, at least in my experience.  The RTE stream was constantly buffering and compressed to shit.  The GAAGO was a nice clear 720p signal.  Still way to pricey though"
GAA,3ccejg,michaelirishred,2,Tue Jul 7 02:53:30 2015 UTC,Yeah it hasn't worked for me either. I asked in the match thread and got a stream though!
GAA,3ccejg,meok91,1 point,Tue Jul 7 16:22:17 2015 UTC,Yea some digging through customer support on Unblock-us indicates that RTE have been blocking ANY DNS connections to their sports broadcasts (which I imagine are their most sought-after programs). Not sure. I can get like the Sunday Game Extras to work but nothing else. I've given up for the time being but sure I'll be throwing shit at the wall again in a couple of weeks.
GAA,3ccejg,meok91,1 point,Tue Jul 7 20:00:18 2015 UTC,"Why not use something like Torguard or Unblock.us instead, yeah you have to pay for them but at least you can use them for other things as well like netflix, instead of paying for GAAGO. They are also much safer than Hola."

GAA,3c6u2p,WrenBoy,2,Sun Jul 5 16:36:47 2015 UTC,What was wrong with GaaGo?
GAA,3c6u2p,Hallyug,3,Sun Jul 5 16:40:50 2015 UTC,Choppy as fuck and fairly low resolution. It was impossible to see what was going on as it was like watching a slideshow at times.   Cricfree wasnt perfect or anything but at least I didnt have to give them my money.
GAA,3c6u2p,WrenBoy,3,Sun Jul 5 16:59:11 2015 UTC,"GG Kilkenny. I'm excited I was able to find a stream for this one, it's not like America has a hurling channel."

GAA,3c6u2p,michaelirishred,4,Sun Jul 5 17:32:13 2015 UTC,Fair play to Darragh for at least trying to shut brolly up. He was right about the penalty but he can't help but make his point 40 times. Fucking mouthpiece.
GAA,3c6u2p,Niall8100,1 point,Sun Jul 5 14:57:04 2015 UTC,Also fair play to him for pointing out that they both said Cork hadn't a hope. He's actually very good.

GAA,3c6u2p,michaelirishred,1 point,Sun Jul 5 13:38:26 2015 UTC,Decent start by Cork. If they can keep the heads up could be close.

GAA,3c6n1z,TheAngryPuffin,3,Sun Jul 5 12:33:28 2015 UTC,Do you mean hurling sites (as in fields) or teams? I think there are about 9 GAA Clubs in Germany but most of them just play gaelic football. We normally play on soccer fields. Thats why there are only 11 players per team on an European Hurling field..

GAA,3bwhk5,barbar84,5,Thu Jul 2 18:49:22 2015 UTC,Always nice to see people from non Irish backgrounds enjoying the games. We have an American on our Hurling team and he's more passionate and committed than almost anyone else. I love seeing how a lot of the inter-county minor teams have started to have kids from immigrant families. But for a group with no Irish connection beyond their teacher to be so into it is great
GAA,3bwhk5,ViolentlyCaucasian,4,Fri Jul 3 09:51:25 2015 UTC,Yeah well when I was 14 we had to combine teams and make a Detroit/Philly/Pittsburgh team for a tournament!   But seriously this is awesome. And I think it's funny how they're 'turning their backs on traditional sport'

GAA,3bq427,LLAVZZ,4,Wed Jul 1 06:20:44 2015 UTC,I still don't fully know how it works. It's a mess
GAA,3bq427,michaelirishred,3,Wed Jul 1 10:05:41 2015 UTC,Everything you need to know is here in this comprehensive infographic... Enjoy: http://sbo.net/infographic/hurling-and-the-all-ireland-interactive/
GAA,3bq427,dualstar90,1 point,Wed Jul 1 12:50:17 2015 UTC,"Ive read somewhere that the McCarthy cup/Tier 1 is only for teams from Leinster and Munster. Is this true? If so, why isn't Connacht included?"
GAA,3bq427,yazid87,2,Wed Jul 1 16:18:05 2015 UTC,"Kind of. Galway (Connaught) and Antrim (Ulster) are lumped in with the better teams from Leinster to form one half of the draw and the teams from Munster form the other half of the draw. There's nothing stopping a Connaught team from qualifying, they'd just have to move up the tiers by winning consistently."
GAA,3bq427,farmersam,2,Wed Jul 1 16:41:56 2015 UTC,"Not Antrim anymore, Kerry will be in the round robin after winning the christy ring."
GAA,3bq427,MotoPsycho,2,Thu Jul 2 14:54:25 2015 UTC,So we'll have a Munster team competing in Leinster next year? I can understand why but that's still bizarre to think about.
GAA,3bq427,farmersam,0,Thu Jul 2 15:10:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it is weird because Munster has a championship of there own. Though it's better for kerry to be competing against Westmeath, Carlow and Offaly(I think) next year rather than tipp, cork, limerick etc...  If it ever got to the point where they were able to get out of that round robin I think they should play in Munster.  It's really annoying that we got relegated, especially after easing through it last year and beating laois this year."
GAA,3bq427,dualstar90,2,Thu Jul 2 15:45:26 2015 UTC,"McCarthy cup is for the top ranked teams, mostly Leinster and Munster teams. But Galway(Connaught) and Antrim(Ulster) also play in it. Both of these teams play in the ""Leinster"" Championship. The reason for this is that Hurling is weak in Connaught and galway needed more games in a season than just 1/2. Antrim have dominated ulster hurling for a good number of years now (although the gap is closing in recent years). SO they entered the Leinster championship to get more competitive games also but they also play in the ulster championship which is treated as a secondary competition( i.e. its only played off when antrim are knocked out of the Liam McCarthy). Also this year Antrim have got relegated from the Liam McCarthy and so will play in the Christy Ring Cup next year. Kerry will take their place in the Leinster Championship(even thugh Kerry is in Munster geographically!) next year."
GAA,3bq427,dualstar90,1 point,Thu Jul 2 10:53:22 2015 UTC,"So when a team gets promoted they can go to either championship regardless of where they are from? Also, is there any playing that goes on before the MacCarthy Cup?"
GAA,3bq427,the_frightman_cometh,1 point,Thu Jul 2 16:32:43 2015 UTC,this might explain it a bit better: http://www.gaa.ie/content/downloads/wallcharts/hurling_wallchart_2015.pdf  the team promoted from the christy ring cup goes directly into the leinster qualifier group! Im sure this is very confucing for anyone thats not from Ireland!
GAA,3bhnfm,Rudi89,3,Mon Jun 29 08:21:41 2015 UTC,"Good, we deserve to be beaten and to be put out quick. Nothings going to change though, blame the manager, blame the players. But the county board still wont invest in youth development, nothing will change."
GAA,3ben2r,gavinontheweb,13,Sun Jun 28 14:57:09 2015 UTC,"Wouldn't even call that ""rugby style"". Just a sly dirty dig"
GAA,3ben2r,DitchView,3,Sun Jun 28 16:44:38 2015 UTC,That'd probably be a red in rugby as well. Leading with the forarm straight to the face.
GAA,3ben2r,barbar84,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:11:21 2015 UTC,What else was he supposed to do?
GAA,3ben2r,KhalifaKidV2,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:59:48 2015 UTC,When they showed the replay you could really see that he pushed of his back foot to hit him as hard as be could into the chest. You could see it on his face when he got the red that he knew it was coming.
GAA,3ben2r,ClashOfTheAsh,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:04:45 2015 UTC,There was no need for it all. He knew they were beaten and he was clearly just taking out his frustration.

GAA,3ben2r,MrHenrySugar,3,Sun Jun 28 17:27:57 2015 UTC,He did sort of elbow him in the face at full speed...
GAA,3ben2r,Staals,2,Sun Jun 28 17:51:48 2015 UTC,In my view it was either raise your arms and protect yourself or get hit by Martin. It looks to me like Martin stepped into O'Rourke.
GAA,3ben2r,kevdev92,2,Sun Jun 28 22:45:30 2015 UTC,"If the defender was leading with the shoulder I may have agreed with you but I think the Westmeath lad is fairly obviously set for the tackle (arms out, low body position, legs wide) so I don't think O'Rourke's in any real danger of a big hit.   Either way leading with the arm is pretty high up on the list of bookable offences.   Although I am a Louth man so I may be biased. :-P"
GAA,3ben2r,CaptainSpaceButt,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:10:51 2015 UTC,"He literally launched himself full force into another player, didn't show any attempt at dodging the tackle, if thats not a red card I don't know what is?"
GAA,3ben2r,alfbort,2,Wed Jul 1 15:10:32 2015 UTC,"He was coming out with the ball, his momentum and the fact that he's so much bigger made it look much worse, he led with his shoulder in fairness"
GAA,3be9re,barbar84,2,Sun Jun 28 12:16:05 2015 UTC,"Totally disagree with the lads in the studio, that was not entertaining."
GAA,3be9re,orpheus13,2,Sun Jun 28 16:41:42 2015 UTC,Yeah game was over at twenty mins and as a result has no entertainment value. I'd much rather watch even the Down v Derry game which they took issue with for being poor than that. At least it was neck and neck and exciting.

GAA,3banjx,barbar84,4,Sat Jun 27 11:21:57 2015 UTC,"Terrible standard of football, but Donegal were worth the win in the end.  Derry's discipline cost them, and they panicked in key situations.  At 1 point down, they had a free inside the 45. Instead of having a go at goal, they took it quickly, were forced into a poor pass which was picked off. The Derry heads dropped, and Donegal countered quickly to kick a point. Then the Goalkeeper panicked and took a quick kickout, straight to a Donegal man, who after a series of calm passes, got it to McElhinney who walked around the goalkeeper and tapped it into the net. 1-1 in 40 seconds.  I think the first Black card was borderline, didn't look deliberate from TV footage. The second one was a Red card for me. Shocking stuff. Just kicked the legs off McHugh.  A lot of diving from forwards, from both sides, which the referee rightly ignored."
GAA,3banjx,decondd2,3,Sat Jun 27 21:05:59 2015 UTC,Was sitting right in front of where McHugh was brought down. Could have seriously injured the poor fella.
GAA,3banjx,TeaPottSmash,3,Sat Jun 27 22:30:59 2015 UTC,"Glad for the win, but Donegal need to sort themselves out."
GAA,3banjx,robspeaks,3,Sat Jun 27 19:37:08 2015 UTC,I'd say Gallagher is happy enough. If they'd coasted through that after coasting through the Armagh game there's the chance that they would've had a bit of complacency sneak in for the final.
GAA,3banjx,orpheus13,2,Sat Jun 27 23:36:48 2015 UTC,"I suppose you'd rather this type of performance in the semifinal rather than the final, but still not a pleasant experience.  Donegal lacked overall focus and direction on offense, not to mention the individual poor shot selection and accuracy.  The game itself might have been different, but the feeling I had was similar to the Kerry game last year... so frustrating to watch a team underperform when you know what they are capable of.  Credit to Kerry and Derry in both cases of course, but there's no question Donegal were not up to speed."
GAA,3banjx,robspeaks,1 point,Sun Jun 28 02:42:11 2015 UTC,Yeh they definitely were not up to speed. I'm nearly sure they only scored one point in the twenty mins after the goal. And went around twenty mins in the first half without scoring.
GAA,3banjx,orpheus13,4,Sun Jun 28 08:42:12 2015 UTC,"Should have been a straight red for Ciaran McFaull. Derry really let this one go, they had plenty of chances in the last 25 minutes to pull it back and they haven't taken them. Last 10 minutes they really lost their discipline too."
GAA,3banjx,Niall8100,3,Sat Jun 27 19:31:02 2015 UTC,The loss of discipline was great for Donegal too. Any row that broke out cost two or three minutes in the last fifteen like.
GAA,3banjx,orpheus13,2,Sat Jun 27 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"That's what really confused me. Donegal seemed to be there for the taking in the last 20 minutes and Derry ended up running the clock down much more themselves with their own indiscipline, which played right into Donegal's hands."
GAA,3banjx,Niall8100,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:57:00 2015 UTC,"Derry have been very wastesful, would absolutely love a draw so they have to replay though!"
GAA,3banjx,Niall8100,1 point,Sat Jun 27 19:20:52 2015 UTC,"Seemed like Donegal just went ""Fuck this!"" and now the game is pretty much over as a contest :P"
GAA,3banjx,Niall8100,4,Sat Jun 27 19:06:14 2015 UTC,"As a neutral I'm loving this ref. Letting the game go on, and ignoring lads looking for handy frees."
GAA,3banjx,robspeaks,0,Sat Jun 27 18:56:54 2015 UTC,He ignored too much and it's his fault it got out of hand in the end.
GAA,3banjx,robspeaks,2,Sat Jun 27 19:37:43 2015 UTC,I don't understand the Donegal setup.  It's like the final last year.  Where are the waves of runners?  Everyone is just sitting around and taking shots from 60.
GAA,3banjx,Niall8100,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:36:39 2015 UTC,"Derry have got into the game fairly well now, Donegal are going to have to work hard for this win."

GAA,3auz9t,ShitTobinSays,3,Tue Jun 23 18:46:35 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm fine the Torpey Hurleys which you can get in Elvery's. Sometimes you need to shop around to get one with the right grain and weight (my preference is as light as possible). I'd also second what the other /u/Ruggedirishguy said, 6'3 or not a 36 in generally overkill and 37 dfinitely would be. Shorter Hurleys are typically harder to hook and lighter and more agile to make it easier get a strike away under pressure, though obviously it's a matter of preference.  Probably the best type I've used was a Star which are made in Kilkenny, only got mine when someone from the club went down and bought a load of them to bring back so I'm not sure whereabouts in the Dublin you'd be able to get them"
GAA,3auz9t,ViolentlyCaucasian,2,Tue Jun 23 23:21:58 2015 UTC,that's great! thanks! I suppose I'll try the 35 then! thank you so much for your input!
GAA,3auz9t,ViolentlyCaucasian,3,Tue Jun 23 23:28:47 2015 UTC,"No worries, just in case you're not sure what to look for in the grain you want it to look like this or this where the wood grain is mostly even and curving along with the shape of the bas towards the toe. Generally the ones that go Elvery's way are fine but I've seen the odd dodgy one, I remember the Lifestyle sports ones used to be crap but can't comment on them recently."
GAA,3auz9t,moloizer,2,Tue Jun 23 23:44:18 2015 UTC,"If you can travel, come to Galway and get a hurl off of the Cannings. Best in the country."
GAA,3auz9t,Shteamboats,1 point,Tue Jun 23 23:16:25 2015 UTC,"Any sports shop will sell hurleys. As was said Cork or kilkenny make the best, check the stamp on it to see where it was made. You likely won't find a 37 in a shop as it is a really uncommon size, if you really want one that size you'll need to find a hurley maker and buy direct"
GAA,3auz9t,eddied96,4,Tue Jun 23 19:50:22 2015 UTC,Someones out of the game too long. Hurley makers are where you get the best hurleys
GAA,3auz9t,eddied96,2,Wed Jun 24 07:52:35 2015 UTC,"yeah this is what I figured, but it seems like Dublin just does not have one!"
GAA,3auz9t,ClancyKiid,0,Wed Jun 24 08:23:59 2015 UTC,"Tipperary is where its at in terms style and quality. We have O brien hurley makers (they have a website) in drangan they supply eoin kelly,  paul curran and the other curran brothers,  grant hurley makers in rosegreen (i think).  Id recommend O brien hurley makers for sure"
GAA,3auz9t,Shteamboats,2,Wed Jun 24 09:09:35 2015 UTC,Bourke hurleys in borrisoleigh are good too.
GAA,3auz9t,eddied96,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:07:55 2015 UTC,"Not out of the game, just know that it's not easy to find a good hurley in Dublin. If he can't go to Kilkenny /Cork to get a good one then the next best thing is go into a sports shop and see what they have."
GAA,3auz9t,fannymcslap,0,Wed Jun 24 10:21:15 2015 UTC,"ah yeah :)  fair enough,  alot of elverys down south actually order in hurleys from local hurley makers also"
GAA,3auz9t,Ruggedirishguy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:59:54 2015 UTC,They're probably goin cheap in wexford at the minute...
GAA,3auz9t,Ruggedirishguy,1 point,Wed Jun 24 10:37:35 2015 UTC,"A 36 and above is an absolute weapon and really is too large as you will be more easily hooked, consider going down to a 34, I'm 6ft dead but unless your like 6ft 5+ you shouldn't be using more than a 35. As for hurls in Dublin I haven't a clue, if your really set on getting a few go as far as Kilkenny, Star hurls are regarded as some of the best hurls in the country. Don't know where they are in Kilkenny but everyone there would know so just ask around!"
GAA,3auz9t,feighery,3,Tue Jun 23 18:52:58 2015 UTC,"right, thanks for the tips! I'm 6ft3, and have been told it should be up to my hip, maybe I'll try a 35. Won't have a chance to get up to Kilkenny, going back home on thursday, saw a hurley I should have bought in Cork but did not want to lug it around the country! Thanks for the info though, I'll look for star hurls!"
GAA,3auz9t,moloizer,3,Tue Jun 23 18:54:54 2015 UTC,"I've always been told that your size is measured by gripping the hurl at the top and swinging it with your arms at full length, if the hurl is just off the ground, flicking the grass, etc, it's the right size. I think thats the general advice given to people but really it's whatever your comfortable with. Joe Dean was a Cork corner-forward a few years back who played with a childs hurl, 28"" or 30"", he was never more than 40 yards fro goal which meant he never needed a big hurl and then was hard hooked because of it!"
GAA,3auz9t,new-account9,2,Tue Jun 23 19:05:35 2015 UTC,"oh right! I've just started playing, I fancy myself more of a defender, as that's what I play in hockey, hopefully I can find someone in Dublin who can give me some information in person based on my physique, always tough over the internet eh! but thanks so much, I'll certainly look for something shorter!"
GAA,3auz9t,Drunk3rD,3,Tue Jun 23 19:08:28 2015 UTC,I'm about 6ft3 and fairly stocky. I got a 34 recently and thought it would be too short but it is bang on. It just fits well and have no problem catching a puck short.
GAA,3auz9t,new-account9,2,Tue Jun 23 19:49:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I'm back playing Junior A after ten years away from hurling and a lot of players are now using hurls that I would've considered way too short for them but whatever suits.
GAA,3auz9t,therobohour,2,Tue Jun 23 23:15:50 2015 UTC,An alternative rule of thumb is that it should fit under your legs when parallel with them.
GAA,3atjr5,orpheus13,3,Tue Jun 23 11:51:51 2015 UTC,"I took a picture on my phone.   Doesn't surprise me in the slightest, I know clubs will be at something similar in a similar level of detail."

GAA,3atjr5,troll_hard_ie,1 point,Tue Jun 23 15:35:38 2015 UTC,I don't know where they got that Vinny Corey is extremely slow but that isn't true. He may not be lightning quick but hes not slow either.
GAA,3atjr5,bkdleg,1 point,Tue Jun 23 18:06:56 2015 UTC,Was it actually reported as a leak or did they portray it as their own analysis?
GAA,3atjr5,barbar84,3,Tue Jun 23 12:48:11 2015 UTC,The Irish News have said they've got their hands on it so I assume so.   Would be genius if Rory Gallagher has leaked it himself to spook Monaghan should Donegal get past Derry. if Vinny Corey reads that the first thing he does when he gets the ball is bounce it he'll be overly conscious of it in the final. Small margins/game of inches and all that.
GAA,3atjr5,As_Bearla_,1 point,Tue Jun 23 13:00:19 2015 UTC,Got a link to it? Can't find it on their website.

GAA,3ap5zx,barbar84,7,Mon Jun 22 10:59:40 2015 UTC,"Fermanagh again is a bit of an anti climax, 3rd championship meeting in 2 years. Not overly optimistic, I've never in my life seen Antrim football and hurling be as much of a state as it has been this year, and thats saying something. It's a total and utter fuck up. The current board needs to fuck off, but no one with a lick of sense wants anything to do with that shit show.  Couldn't even get a proper set of fucking jerseys for saturday. 3 St Galls lads dropped for playing a very important club hurling game the night before that the county refused to move. u21 Club hurling final fixed for last sunday meaning some st johns players could not feature v cavan in the minor semi final. The counties run by dick heads who don't give a flying fuck about the county, sure Laois were obviously gonna beat us, whats the point trying to help.  On top of all that, if we get a home draw (which I don't think we can), we don't even have feckin pitch to play on!"
GAA,3ap5zx,farmersam,3,Mon Jun 22 11:56:23 2015 UTC,"Surely with the potential for growth in Antrim, you'd imagine that the GAA would start putting more pressure on them to sort their shit out. They aren't planning on building a new casement to only be full once a year. They'll want the counties with the major cities competing and filling those stadiums on a regular basis. Is there any signs that this could happen? As for our draw, don't think we'll face the same quality of Rossie side that played against Sligo, but I'd still give us a decent chance."
GAA,3ap5zx,farmersam,2,Mon Jun 22 13:14:05 2015 UTC,"I doubt the Gaa will put pressure on Antrim. To be honest, it's our own fault we're in this mess, we let it happen and no one can be bothered changing it. We complain and complain but when given the opportunity to change things it's too much work.  The Antrim support is abismal, any time I've seen casement near capacity at an Antrim game it's mostly away supporters. I'm not one to talk, haven't been to a game in about 4 years.  I would fancy Cavan to beat Roscommon, bit of a surprise sligo beating them but I've seen a lot of Sligo, they've yoyo'd through the leagues a bit with antrim for a few years and they're a fairly handy side."
GAA,3ap5zx,sicosqurial,3,Mon Jun 22 13:45:24 2015 UTC,"I'd like to think Limerick will take westweath easy  enough but after the weekend, we're all a bit shook. Even if we go on from Westmeath, I wouldn't fancy us against Dublin and we barely beat Clare.   But it any team coming through the back door will find it difficult to beat tipp or kilkenny this year. They're head and shoulders above other teams this year.  Hopefully roscommon will be over there shock loss to sligo and they'll have a good game against cavan."
GAA,3aq1s1,thedeclineirl,3,Mon Jun 22 16:06:30 2015 UTC,Surely there should be a lengthy Ban for hitting someone with your Hurley like that.

Off the Ball do a couple of GAA podcasts a week on the newstalk website which are good. RTE do an occasional GAA podcast. There was another one that was posted around here but it seems to have stopped in the last few weeks.

Newstalk has ""GAA on Off the Ball"" which is mini-segments broken down by topic and is usually good.  They also have a ""Friday GAA Podcast"" which is ok to not great  GAA Scores do occasional podcasts often focussing on a couple of games  There's an ""RTE GAA Podcast"" which is pretty good  After that there are probably various podcasts of local radio programs about the GAA, for example in Kerry there's Terrace Talk, and there are more of that sort available depending on where you're interested in."

I'm GAA mad, and it drove me to turn off the radio on my journey home from Thurles last weekend.  Brenda Donahue doing a section on Galway and Mayo couples was vomit inducing. Shane Curran asking inciteful questions like: ""What's with the fancy boots?"" and ""What tactics are you going to use against Cork?"" to Eamon Fitzmaurice.  Amazingly Enda Kenny was the most insightful analyst on the show... that will tell you what the quality was like."

GAA,395a85,lowfatevil,3,Tue Jun 9 10:30:08 2015 UTC,"Colm Parkinson on newstalk put a decent proposal forward this morning, but I think this is probably the better of the two. This sounds great and would make the league great as well."
GAA,395a85,barbar84,3,Tue Jun 9 12:52:45 2015 UTC,"My suggestion is, move the provincial championship to earlier in the year and have the All Ireland in Champions League format with 8 pots of 4 seeds; e.g. Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Waterford.   Top 2 from every pot goes through and it's knockout from there. Even shitty teams get at least 3 matches. I think grafting the league on to the championship format is a bit convoluted and rules out the possibility of a shock.   Could be wrong though, what do I know?!"
GAA,395a85,faith_some_more,3,Tue Jun 9 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"The problem with this is you end up with 4 likely Annihilation's: Dublin v Limerick, Dublin v Waterford, Galway v Limerick, Galway v Waterford. One fairly onesided game: Dublin v Galway and one game that will be lucky to get 200 people in attendance: Limerick v Waterford in a dead rubber for last place in the group.  The whole point of revamping the championship is to balance it out surely, and the only way to do that fairly is to have a 2 (or 3 or 4) tier system.  I like McGuinness' 2 tier system where league and provincial championships stay in place. I disagree that the 2 Finals should be held on the same day, perhaps the same weekend, with the 2nd tier on the Saturday evening and the Sam Maguire competition on the Sunday. A similar system is in place in European Rugby with the Challenge Cup final the night before the Heiniken Cup."
GAA,395a85,decondd2,3,Tue Jun 9 17:46:52 2015 UTC,This a great format. Similar to Sean Kelly's but with some improvements. It would re-invigorate the league and Provincial championships along with improving the fairness of the All-Ireland for Ulster teams. Having the second tier All-Ireland final in croke park on All-Ireland final day would provide a massive incentive for counties in that competition.  The GPA need a single format to get behind and promote and this should be it.
GAA,395a85,3hrstillsundown,8,Tue Jun 9 12:06:53 2015 UTC,Having the second tier All-Ireland final in croke park on All-Ireland final day would provide a massive incentive for counties in that competition.   Would it? seems to me that is would just add more difficulty getting tickets for the All-Ireland.
GAA,395a85,Versk,7,Tue Jun 9 13:13:50 2015 UTC,"If you're a Longford footballer, the idea that you could play in croker on All-Ireland final day with the prize of qualifying for the tier one All-Ireland would be a massive motivation.   Players want to play in croke park but they don't want to be hammered by Dublin in a half full croke park. This gives them the possibility of playing in Croker in a competitive match on the biggest GAA day of the year.  It might be slightly harder to get tickets but it's a small price to pay to try and revitalise gaelic football in a lot of small counties."
GAA,395a85,3hrstillsundown,2,Tue Jun 9 13:49:27 2015 UTC,"It might be slightly harder to get tickets   Its already nearly impossible. If the lower tier championship is given enough backing it should be able to fill out enough of croke park on its own instead of piggy backing on the big boys game.   you could play in croker on All-Ireland final day   Yeah but its not all-ireland day for the longford lads who are playing in front of a half-full disinterested crowd. I'm all for a better and fairer all-Ireland championship, but the All-Ireland is fine the way it is and doesn't need to be disneyfied like this.  ""Just imagine they're all here for you lads"""
GAA,395a85,Versk,3,Tue Jun 9 14:11:30 2015 UTC,"Not being able to get tickets to see your team perpetually get to an all Ireland final is a serious first world problem, or maybe a County Kerry problem.   given enough backing it should be able to fill out enough of croke park on its own instead of piggy backing on the big boys game.   That's easy to say. 'Enough backing' is a vague meaningless term. I'm sure the GAA tried to give the Tommy Murphy cup 'Enough backing' but that didn't work. Having it on all-Ireland day forces media focus on it. The reason people are much more interested in womens tennis over other women's sports is because it's 'piggy backed' on the men's tournament."
GAA,395a85,3hrstillsundown,2,Tue Jun 9 14:46:50 2015 UTC,It would be an absolute disaster regarding tickets. The minor AI Final and the Tier 2 AI Final on the same day might be an idea though.

I'd go for Armagh V Donegal as it is a high standard game which should be close. Galway V Mayo might be good but is very far away. If you don't want to travel too far, out of the two closest games I'd go to Westmeath V Wexford as it will be more competitive than Meath V Wicklow."

Galway is a beautiful vibrant tourist city, and salthill (the area where the stadium is) has a promenade and seaside that stretches for miles. Look up irishrail for train times and prices, (these leave from Dublin Heuston station which is easily accessible from the red luas line) and enjoy the game and was Connacht has to offer!"

GAA,393usc,sit_wednesday,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:33:30 2015 UTC,"If I was you I'd go to the Wexford Westmeath or Meath Wicklow game. Armagh Donegal promises to be the best game of the day (Within a reasonable distance from Dublin) but it's expected to be a full house so tickets could potentially be difficult to get. I know from reading the Armagh fan forums a lot of people in Armagh still don't have tickets so it could be risky. If you do decide to go for that if you got up to Armagh in good time, the game is at 2 so if you were there around 12.30/12.45, you might be able to get a ticket outside the ground but a big crowd is expected so no guarantees.Whatever game you go to I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Wherever you're staying Sunday night I'd recommend you try and catch the highlights of all the games from over the weekend on The Sunday Game on RTE 2, usually starts around 9.30 or so, but maybe you know this already.

No disrespect to Waterford though, they took all their chances and deserved to win."
GAA,38whhg,positive_tension,2,Sun Jun 7 16:38:58 2015 UTC,"Note: You may need to use something like Hola Unblocker if ouside Ireland for the offical streams (first two). Not sure it works. If it does please let us know in the comments. Use hola at your own risk. Here is why. If anyone has an alternative please post it in comments.   I have a slight workaround for this, though it still may expose you somewhat.  Install Hola on Chrome, and only chrome, as the way Chrome stores extensions it doesn't install anywhere else.  Go directly to RTE, chose your Irish server, launch the RTE Player.  As soon as the stream starts playing the commercial, remove Hola from Chrome.  The authentication only occurs when the stream first starts, so getting rid of Hola at this point is fine.  Now you are  free to watch the match.  If you do this process with two tabs open it shouldn't take much more than 20 seconds.  I am sure there is still some risk in that 20 seconds, but I can't imagine much.    I have tested this and gone through the uninstall guides to make sure nothing is left behind when following this procedure and as far as I can tell, there isn't anything still on the machine. Though, I make no guarantees.    I can rarely watch the matches live, so I need the RTE on demand functionality and this is the only way I have found to be able to get it.    One last note, if you close the stream, or start a new one, you will need to follow these steps again to get it to work.  Not a huge deal if you ask me, but it is not a set it and forget one time workaround."

Derry weren't too bad when I seen them vs mayo, but then I saw them vs Dublin and lost any respect I had for them.   The Munster championship isn't bad, and Connaught is far from clear cut this year. Leinster is the only non competitive Provence imo"
GAA,38pg5c,Tote_Sport,1 point,Tue Jun 9 08:43:06 2015 UTC,"You've seen 1/3 of Ulster's teams play then.  Despite being an Orchardman, yesterday's performance by Donegal against us was sublime. We had no response to Donegal dominating possession, or even for Murphy for that matter.  On a side note, Fermanagh have also seen themselves promoted to Division 2, after losing out to Armagh in the Division 3 final. Pete McGrath is a smart man and gets results (2 All-Irelands with Down in the 90's and a shit load of Hogan Cups with St Colman's in Newry)."

The most obvious thing from the analysis of the Cavan v Monaghan game was that they weren't at the game. Go back and look at what they said, it was as if they were reading from a script written before the game. Compare it to someone like Colm Parkinson on news talk who was actually on the sideline. Yet there was no mention of this in either the live analysis or the sunday game later that night, because it didn't suit the pundits pre arranged narrative. It used to be the lad in the pub that would bluff there way through talking about the GAA, and repeat what was said on the telly. Now the actual lads on the telly are just repeating the same shit they've been saying two years previous.    tl;dr because lads on the telly are a bunch of miserable fuckheads."

Because its shite telly and people won't watch. 30,000 people is more than you'd get into any GAA ground in the country, and in regards to your 3rd point Dublin travel just as much as any county playing the league and has it effected their performance? So lets not be delusional here."
GAA,37y2i5,Schweppie,1 point,Mon Jun 1 04:24:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying show a documentary I mean show a different game, also at least 10 stadiums have the capacity to hold 30,000. O'Moore park in Laois (the most likely venue for a neutral ground) holds 27,000. I'd prefer to see that with at least 20,000 plus fans turn up rather than see Croke Park with 50,000 empty seats. Oh and in the league Dublin lost 2 of 4 games on their travels and played 3 games at Croke Park winning 2 and drawing 1. So IMO travelling can affect their performance."

GAA,376y63,barbar84,5,Mon May 25 11:24:37 2015 UTC,There already is an All Ulster Hurling team and it plays in the Railway Cup. Having it compete in the inter county championship gives them an unfair advantage over their competitors.
GAA,376y63,schutjezelf,3,Mon May 25 11:34:29 2015 UTC,I think it's a stupid idea. The profile of the game needs to be raised in the North and the GAA need to do a better job marketing it to a young audience. This means spending cash!  Although the standard is poor at the moment and Antrim got relegated they are not exactly a billion miles away from a top standard either.
GAA,376y63,Redditwork83,2,Tue May 26 02:02:37 2015 UTC,"Think an Ulster team minus Antrim, Down and maybe Derry could be good. Still don't think it would be able to compete with Antrim, even in the state we're in at the minute. Club rules in Antrim in both codes, and we're practically playing with B squads at the minute because lads wont play county."
GAA,376y63,farmersam,2,Mon May 25 11:52:34 2015 UTC,Why is that? I find it very strange to think that anyone from say Dublin wouldn't accept the call up just to stay with their club.
GAA,376y63,RuudGullitOnAShed,1 point,Thu Jun 4 06:37:06 2015 UTC,"There's loads of reasons. The Antrim set up is a complete farce, we've no county ground and casement wont be built for years. The training facilities that are being built at dunsilly have been a complete disaster, they're unusable at the minute when they should have been ready 5/6 years ago with still no end in sight.  The county board is a joke, just men lining their pockets and don't give a fuck about the progression of the county. Anyone that could be good for the us isn't interested in running for chairman.  Club will always beat county in Antrim, outside maybe St Galls or Loughgiel (cause they win nearly every year) I'd say most other clubs would rather win a county championship than and Ulster or Leinster with Antrim. You grow up with your club team they're basically family, then you go to they county and you have to play with boys you hate from clubs you hate. The club rivalries in Antrim, particularly in hurling, can be very heated and it definitely doesn't help the county team.  Antrim got beat by Fermanagh at the weekend and 3 of the team were in America the next day, even the ones that do play just don't care.  I could go on forever, I would nearly rather antrim got put out as soon as possible because it messes up the club fixtures."
GAA,376y63,farmersam,2,Thu Jun 4 11:00:55 2015 UTC,"I understand why it would be proposed as an idea, but in the end I just don't think it's even an option.  Can't really see any county other than Antrim going for it."
GAA,376y63,robspeaks,3,Mon May 25 16:36:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think Antrim would go for it. Why would we? The team would end up being 90% Antrim anyway and probably 10% Down. I think if there's and Ulster team, Antrim should stay out of it and probably down too.  I don't think it'll happen, the rest of Ulster don't give a monkeys about hurling and Antrim don't give a monkeys about the county, although we sure love to complain about it but do fuck all to fix it. Would rather beat the shite out of each other in club games than sort ourselves out."

GAA,36g15u,gufcfan,5,Thu May 28 21:24:29 2015 UTC,"Hurling as a sport is not as widely played in Ireland as say Gaelic football and has been the case since the all Ireland series started. It has just progressed that only a dozen or so counties play at a high level with maybe eight or nine having a realistic chance of winning an all Ireland at any time. To keep hurling of interest in most other counties that are strongly football orientated there are weaker ""All Ireland championships"" they are the Nicky Rackard cup, Christy Ring cup and Lory Meagher cup. The teams that play in each level is usually decided by it's position in the league and what division it plays in. Division one A and B tend to have the teams for the All Ireland championship, Division 2a and 2b are in the Christy ring or Nicky Rackard cup. While 3a or 3b tend to be in the Nicky rackard or Lory Meagher cup."

GAA,36g15u,Tote_Sport,2,Tue May 19 22:12:21 2015 UTC,It's not so much a central issue that GAA HQ want to develop. It's down to individual county boards to promote the sport in their relevant counties.

GAA,36e3fe,LuckyNumberFour,3,Mon May 18 17:41:07 2015 UTC,"Our women's football has a larger, more American panel than our men's side. Largely drawn from college rugby/soccer (our club sponsors a full youth-through adult soccer program), only three Irish girls in the whole panel - even the girls that come over on J1s that play sports tend toward the rugby. We just leave the girls to it and they run a tight ship! We share one board, and they are frequently the most organized and ready to work to plan things out. They do better with recruiting, and plan the majority of our social events. Love our women's side: they're the heart of the club. They were finalists in their division last year in only their second year; the small group that play camogie travel around to various 7s tournaments and then play merged with another club at nationals. Honestly, they just started with four or five interested girls and it just snowballed.   Our club has much, much, much more focus on football than hurling/camogie, though! Our league is only competitive in football - we're the only club for a thousand miles that has more than one former inter-county player, and all three were hurlers - so that's where we concentrate in both men's and women's. If we tog out for hurling at nationals it's just a bonus on top of what we've done in football."

Does your club break off into separate groups or does it stay as one unit?"
GAA,36e3fe,tsetseflier,2,Tue May 19 00:45:34 2015 UTC,"Our competition is such where we are one of the top two teams in the league, and only break off into separate groups for the three weeks before our Championship (which is going on right now).   Our club is just lucky in the sense that it is in a good city that is desirable to live in but small enough where we are the only club in town. We had three lads who (literally) Googled where they should spend their J1 year just to go somewhere different than the norm, and they have catapulted our league to new heights. They were all college hurlers together at a competitive school, and since they first started it, we've had about 25 different ones come over in the next four years. It's just by word of mouth, and we keep getting better and better each year. They come over, have the craic, we show them a wonderful time, and their friends like to spend their years here when they come up and happen to be good athletes. Quite a few have been able to make this a longer-term home, as well.   Our club started with long-term emigres to America, mostly working in tech, over a decade ago. They built a solid foundation layer that has added a lot of beginners. While our top side is all-Irish, and mostly under-30, every player in the club gets a run out in all but one of our league games each year (our close game each year). Our second - mostly, but not exclusively American - side plays against other cities' top sides, and the general consensus seems to be that running drills and mixed games in sessions helps to improve the more interested beginners by leaps and bounds in short periods of time. Those that decide to not push themselves fall off after a couple of months, but this helps to push the standard of the less experienced or older players.   I'm talking about a panel of 35-40 guys each year (our mostly-American women's side is running about 65-70 I think, not sure) to make up two teams. We're a VERY small club but you wouldn't know if from our caliber of play. We only send one team to nationals, so we'll all be together over the summer (our league ends in June)."
GAA,36e3fe,tsetseflier,1 point,Tue May 19 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"Our men's team does the same- they don't practice for Nationals until August. There might be informal hitting around, but everyone goes to co-ed practice once a week and we have a co-ed pub league on Sundays. We sent five teams to Nationals last year, but I think that people felt that was an overreach. I couldn't tell, do you send a women's team?"
GAA,36e3fe,tsetseflier,2,Tue May 19 12:22:40 2015 UTC,"Yep - our women's team finished second in their division last year.   We're going to keep things going right after our League final - have a club coming down for a friendly three weeks after, then we'll keep on training right on through to nationals. Maybe take a week off each year, but otherwise we just keep on truckin'. I just remembered that you're from Indy, right? Our league is a whole of Texas league, so we've already been traveling around this year."
GAA,36e3fe,tsetseflier,1 point,Tue May 19 13:08:07 2015 UTC,"You're not in Austin, are you? I just talked my friend into playing Gaelic this year and she loves it. And yes, I'm in Indy. We have a few women who play Gaelic, but not enough for a team. Current thought is that we'd need to recruit an entire team of players since camogie is already doing things three times a week and adding another day would be rough."

GAA,35z9vl,Niall8100,5,Thu May 14 19:36:48 2015 UTC,"First, soccer is quite different. Soccer connoisseurs love a tense defensive masterclass. That's different from a third division game on a wet Wednesday full of errors. But no-one in GAA loves 13 men behind the ball.  Second, the rules of gaelic football have always been flawed, but a weird type of Irish conservatism prevented anyone from exploiting it until Armagh and Tyrone decided in the 00s they just wanted to win. The article tries to deny that the rules of a sport even can be flawed. Imagine we discovered that in chess there was a strategy for white (who has the first move) which guaranteed a win. We would call that a flaw. We would stop playing chess until we found a change to the rules that restored the game we thought we had."
GAA,35z9vl,jmmcd,1 point,Thu May 14 22:24:58 2015 UTC,"Plenty of sports frequently analyze and change their rules based on the modern situation of their games. Christ, even Augusta National figured out their golf course needed significant renovation because of the demands of the modern game, and that's about as old, conservative, and stodgy as it gets.   I don't know what the answer is, but I'm not the one lining my pockets on the backs of amateurs and making these decisions. Gaelic football is a great game, and a fixable one if the bureaucrats get their heads out of each others' asses and give it two tweaks or so. Hell, when you have consistent officiating over the course of a month or two, even the black card has been kinda useful."
GAA,35z9vl,tsetseflier,2,Fri May 15 13:09:28 2015 UTC,"OT, I'm surprised no-one has really exploited the black card yet -- I mean the opportunity to use a player who needs substituting anyway as an enforcer. I'm a bit disappointed with all these tactical genius managers. Maybe it's not as easy as I thought."
GAA,35z9vl,jmmcd,4,Fri May 15 15:55:47 2015 UTC,"Have to say, I completely disagree. If changes can be made to force a more free flowing game, they should be implemented. Why is the argument of `well soccer has these defensive tactics and nobodies complaining' a valid argument. Its a different sport. Why should the entire support base suddenly have to get on board and accept as ok what for the first 100 years of this sport would have been the exact definition of a bad game. There is something broken in the game, the rules constantly evolve, the pace of change to ultra defensive style of play has outpaced natural evolution of the game. When what is essentially a loophole is found that goes against the long held form of play, to nullify what was the very essence of that sport, more drastic actions need to be taken. I completely agree that the Punditry is spending to much time talking about the problems, but at the same time they are definitely conveying what the average fan in the stands is saying. That a large amount of these games are pure shite, and theres no point ignoring it just for the sake of positivity.    Edit: I think there can be no greater proof that people in general are fed up with this kind of play than the number of people in the sticks complementing the Dubs on how they play and wanting them to win. The Dubs for god sake! Thats what we've come to :)"
GAA,35z9vl,barbar84,3,Thu May 14 19:53:58 2015 UTC,"It's like using Napoleonic tactics in a war with machine guns and modern artillery.   Fuck, part of the whole POINT of Gaelic games is that they aren't soccer."
GAA,35z9vl,tsetseflier,1 point,Fri May 15 13:11:08 2015 UTC,"Fair enough, I just think that the game itself is constantly evolving and that the way teams set up will always change to find the best way to get results. That alone for me keeps me interested in the game.   Recently the game has seen more emphasis put on keeping possession and taking the time to create scoring opportunities, which I think shows a bit less tactical naivety than kicking it into the big man in the forward line and hope for the best.   As a result of this fielding(probably the most pleasing skill to the eye from a spectator standpoint) has become a less important in general. The only thing I would suggest to bring this back would be to introduce the mark on kickouts if it goes past the 45 (never mind Joe Brolly's overly-complicated suggestion). It was tried out in the league a few years ago, was seen to be quite successful and just missed out on getting the two-thirds majority needed at the GAA congress to implement it in the championship with 62% in favour. This would be the only rule change that I would be in favour of at the moment.  I think the current Dublin team is an interesting case. Because of the fact that their attacking threat has a level of potency rarely if ever seen before in the game, teams have no choice but to try and set out to nullify their strengths.  For example in last year's NFL final Derry, after a successful league, decided to try and go all out attacking and went man-on man against them. They were promptly beaten by 15 points and were never at any point close to making it a good contest.  11 months later they decided they weren't going to go up for another hammering and so they went defensive and were right in the game until the last few minutes. They were however vilified by the media for not simply going down against Dublin again and take the hammering that everyone expected.  Obviously they went a bit too far defensive and ended up losing. But I do think in time teams will find the right balance between defense and attack themselves without any need for major rule changes and the game will be better off for it."
GAA,35z9vl,barbar84,1 point,Thu May 14 20:30:31 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right, and teams do find a way around it, but I just don't see it happening to the extent that games against  blanket defences will drastically improve. There's just too many super fit lads on the pitch, there's just no space any more At intrrcounty level. Really thing it's gonna have to go to 13 a side soon."
GAA,35z9vl,ViolentlyCaucasian,2,Fri May 15 08:56:43 2015 UTC,"This article is asinine, in commenting on the Joe Brolly propsed rule changes (which im not fond of myself) he mentions how it would have ruled out the Donaghy goal from last years final and Donegal would have won, never mind that the whole point of it was to change the nature of how the game was played and Donegal likely would have been slaughtered by the Dubs or Kerry or Mayo without their blanket defense.  Soccer has had decades of asymmetrical play, defense has outnumbered attacked forever that's just how the game is played and the low scoring nature of it means this kind of structure is advantagous, and contrary to what the author claims people do moan incessantly about it but the Media have just given up trying. Chelsea were reviled for their tactics winning the Champions league, and are consistently one of the most hated teams in the Permier League.   Also contrary to what he says people love a good defensive display in the GAA, Killkenny won last year on the back of phenomenal defensive play.  But it was a display of passion and intensity, blocks, hooks, tackles, strong defensive catches and nobody but the most bitter of Tipp fans would have said they were undeserving. People like watching defensive skills but 13 men behind the ball destroys the spectacle and doesn't even require skillful defending just a bunch of well organised men sticking their hands out wide and waiting. People love to see forwards tracking back to rob the ball from the breaking back line, block downs, high catches, man to man dispossessions. What they dont like is crowding the box, making creative attacking play impossible and just waiting for the opponents to make a mistake."
GAA,35z9vl,tsetseflier,3,Fri May 15 13:04:49 2015 UTC,I just think part of the whole POINT of Gaelic football is creative attacking play. I don't know what the answer is - and I play at a low enough level to have only played against a blanket once - but I DO know I'd rather watch an intercounty hurling game over football.
GAA,35z9vl,ViolentlyCaucasian,2,Fri May 15 13:15:15 2015 UTC,"Completely agree, I used to love football, I'd watch any game that was on just like I do with Hurling still, but the last few years I've been very selective on the football side. If it doesn't have Dublin (my county) in it or the right combination of non ultra defensive teams, Kerry, Mayo, Cork etc.. I just don't bother. When football went past U16's and the hand passing game became dominant the game had passed me by as a player, just wasn't cut out for playing against it, but it was still so watchable. Some of the best attacking plays I've seen have been fluid hand pass movements, the issue is completely with the blanket"
GAA,35z9vl,tsetseflier,3,Fri May 15 14:18:09 2015 UTC,"Agreed, the hand pass can create some beautiful, fast, incisive moves! I spent about 30 minutes watching I think it was Meath and Kildare in the League for some reason...and had a lovely nap. Watching those lower-league counties playing that style absolutely stunk."
GAA,35z9vl,new-account9,1 point,Fri May 15 14:32:02 2015 UTC,Fails to mention that boxing is slowing losing its popularity to the more 'exciting' mma.   Nevertheless why does it matter what other sports are doing? The vast majority of Gaelic football fans are not entertained watching this game and over time as with boxing it will lose popularity. If a rule change would benefit the game why not bring it in?

I do not think that we should be introducing rules to stop legimate tactics.  However, I do think that the defensive thinking that has brought about blanket defence strategies, has also seen an increase in overtly cynical tackling. Which can and should be stopped."
GAA,35w9nz,thegoodshtuff,4,Thu May 14 11:18:42 2015 UTC,I do not think that we should be introducing rules to stop legimate tactics   Of course we should. Its the GAA's responsibility to look at the game and see where its heading and make changes if its going in an unhealthy direction.

GAA,35h8so,untouchedURL,1 point,Sun May 10 09:52:29 2015 UTC,That would massively hurt a large part of the Dubs game and they're the least defensive high level team. A large part of their kickout strategy involves having 1 ball winning midfielder and 2 ball winning half forwards. Using Flynn and Connolly to bypass other counties with dominant midfields (Mayo in the 2013 final for instance). It's a nice idea but only having midfielders allowed to receive kickouts is an important element of making it work but also massively restrictive on play
GAA,35h8so,ViolentlyCaucasian,0,Sun May 10 13:46:31 2015 UTC,And this is how you beat it.  You line up your 3 half forwards on the attacking 45 facing back towards their own goal. Soon as the ball is kicked they sprint back into defensive position. The centre likewise breaks at pace from position into the middle to spoil the kickout or win it in turn.
GAA,35h8so,As_Bearla_,3,Sun May 10 11:22:03 2015 UTC,"No, Brolly is saying that they're not allowed to encroach until the ball is touched in midfield by one of the midfielders.   But I think there is a point here that needs to be studied -- how long does it take between the first touch of a ball, and the delivery into attack? Obviously there is huge variation and we couldn't measure this by looking at current games -- would need to look at a sample of games in which the midfielders are unhindered for the first few seconds.   Then compare that to an estimate for how long it takes a half-forward to get back from opposition 45m line into own defence."
GAA,35h8so,jmmcd,1 point,Sun May 10 12:22:47 2015 UTC,"I suppose so ye, at least they'd have to sprint as opposed to now when they are already set up there. And think of the knock on effects of producing Olympic sprinters :)"

In general when a player is bearing down on goal and it is a 1 on 1 or 2 on 1 situation you approach the player with the ball at pace and focus your approach on his stronger side. In most players care this is either his right hand or foot.  The objective is to make yourself the biggest obstacle possible.  MAKE HIM MAKE THE DECISION AND FOLLOW THE BALL.  If he opts to round you on his left and go for goal you what you can and put him on the ground. By charging out at him you force him to either take the shot on his weaker foot or hand pass across his body with his weaker arm. This is difficult for intercounty players let alone club players.  Your hands should be raised above shoulder height. Personally I like to get them up in front of the oppositions players face. Again makin yourself seem bigger and the goal smaller.  If he does then go back across you your hands are there to get a block on the ball and embarrass them for not getting the goal that is expected.
GAA,35e8jr,As_Bearla_,5,Sat May 9 15:41:08 2015 UTC,Quick question: Do you know where one could find these booklets?

GAA,3586rr,barbar84,4,Thu May 7 22:28:49 2015 UTC,"Haven't had a chance to click the link but I have thought that for a long time. It's seems like a major advantage for them. Croke Park is an intimidating place to go for a player. Mind games definitely comes into it. As a Waterford man, I feel like I have enough experience of Croker to say that..."
GAA,3586rr,kel89,3,Fri May 8 06:51:44 2015 UTC,It was a very logical and honest explanation from the head of the Leinster council. Unlikely we'll see the Dubs out of the capital for the rest of this decade. Pity for all involved.
GAA,3586rr,As_Bearla_,1 point,Fri May 8 14:47:34 2015 UTC,Yes i was on the fence until he gave a very logical explanation
GAA,3586rr,the_frightman_cometh,1 point,Sat May 9 19:44:41 2015 UTC,"100% yes, as a dublin fan. I was at semple stadium last year for the all ireland hurling QF and it was great fun as an away supporter (although tipp fans kept asking me why we weren't bringing Jason Sherlock on). I would love to go to some away championship games, and also feel an 85,000 capacity stadium doesn't give a proper atmosphere until it's nearly full.  Depressingly, it all comes down to money, of course. As well as Dublin's home advantage, the gaa want to maximise ticket revenue. As well as this, championship counties may want the increased ticket gates and the opportunity to play a championship game in croker, even if it means getting hockeyed in a half empty stadium."
GAA,3586rr,Rudi89,1 point,Fri May 8 07:10:39 2015 UTC,"I was at that Longford game in 06 I think. Even if it does provide a very slight edge to the dubs (I really do question this) if I was a player on one of these fringe teams, I'd want to play in Corker at any possible opportunity, the odds of turning over the Dubs are already astronomical, how much better would it feel to do it at the home of the GAA."

GAA,34sy31,micls,5,Mon May 4 08:14:52 2015 UTC,"First of all I think it's cool that people are playing GAA in Asia and well done for your work. Is it hurling, football or both? Are these Irish people living in Asia or Asian born people? Are Australia/New Zealand included? I would imagine they would have strong teams with the amount of Irish emigrating there."
GAA,34sy31,deewire,4,Mon May 4 14:59:08 2015 UTC,I can answer some of these.   I actually first came across Gaelic Football when I was interning in Korea. Looking for a place to play football and came across the Seoul Gaels. Asia has a pretty decent GAA community. Many clubs are founded by traveling Irish who are teaching English abroad.   Its Hurling AND Football! Mens and Womens. I don't think that Australia are included.
GAA,34sy31,n0tspencer,3,Mon May 4 18:29:41 2015 UTC,Do any of the locals get involved?
GAA,34sy31,deewire,3,Mon May 4 19:17:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, everyone is more than welcome and the club always would host events to get locals involved."
GAA,34sy31,n0tspencer,2,Mon May 4 20:08:29 2015 UTC,"Mostly football, little but of hurling played. Our kids team started to learn hurling last week.   Australia and NZ have their own leagues.   It differs from club to club, but our club  is actually mostly non Irish. Especially with the membership ladies. We've got girls from all over the world playing and they love it.   There's a club in Japan that fielded 2 ladies teams of all Japanese players at last year's Asian Gaelic Games and won their division.   Some clubs have a lot of Irish, like Singapore, where a lot of Irish physios are working."
GAA,34sy31,tsetseflier,2,Mon May 4 23:03:20 2015 UTC,Are you lads able to string out full-sized pitches and play 15 a side? Here in North America it's almost always 13 a side since there only a handful of full-sized grounds available.
GAA,34sy31,tsetseflier,2,Mon May 4 19:33:41 2015 UTC,"Our games are also only 7 mins a half. It sounds laughable, but you're sprinting non stop for that time in up to 40degree heat and then you play 4-6 games in the day for a tournament"

GAA,30zxv8,FinleytheHuman,6,Wed Apr 1 01:14:13 2015 UTC,"I'm sure there's plenty of lads in America good enough, but you'd have to find a club first. Since you don't live in Ireland, to play at the highest level you'd have to move to a town in Ireland with a fairly succesful club (people get picked from small clubs all the time, just not as much), be one of the best on that team and hope you were scouted. Since there's no buying and selling of players and no draft, you'd have to like your new town and county, because nobody will pick you up off a small team and move you to the big leagues. You're tied to those two teams unless you move again. I'm guessing you're just wondering because it's not a professional sport and I doubt there's any adults out there considering upping stakes and moving to Ireland to play GAA.   However even the smallest clubs can be fiercely competitive back home, and you can get some really good teams in America. If you want to test yourself, sign up and you'll see how good even the average guys can be. As for what it takes, the reason ""skill"" is so hyped is because the best guys have years of practice reading the ball, watching the game, even knowing what's coming next. Physical fitness in immensely important in Gaelic games and yet most people will tell you not any runner or sportsperson can be good unless they have years of practice. But it's the same as everything else. You join a team and put hours in after training, every day sharpening your reflexes, learning the touch, honing your skills, if you possess natural athleticism, there's no reason you can't be an absolutely brilliant hurler."

I love the culture of European sport, and obviously it takes time and practice, and years of work, but hard work is no stranger to me. I'll continue researching and guess I should start with learning the game, and the ball/stick skill."

GAA,30zxv8,robspeaks,2,Wed Apr 1 09:25:37 2015 UTC,"The thing that sets hurlers and Gaelic footballers apart is that in order to compete at a high level, you need to train like a professional without getting paid like a professional, or even at all.  If you happen to be wealthy enough to do whatever you like, great.  Otherwise realize you'll need to be making a living and when your career is over, you won't have any financial gain to show for it."
GAA,30zxv8,new-account9,2,Wed Apr 1 05:37:23 2015 UTC,"If you aim to make it at county level I don't think it can be done given the age you seem to be. But then again it's not impossible so..  But realistically I think the highest level you could get to would be a club senior. Its not elite but its still a high level of sport. It is made up of the best hurlers in a town or local area.   Physically hurlers range across different heights and sizes it can depend on the position. Speed and mobility is an advantage. Having an extra bit of height will help as long as it doesn't affect your mobility too much. You wouldn't see many people above 6ft 5 playing county.   At the end of the day though if your skills are good that's the most important thing.  This will leave you at a big disadvantage given that it can take a long time to acquire these skills. The best way to improve is to get down to a hurling wall (or any wall) and practice your striking, touch and handling."
GAA,30zxv8,tsetseflier,2,Wed Apr 1 13:08:00 2015 UTC,"If you've ever played ice hockey, it's of a similar physicality over the course of a game.   Play baseball, golf, or tennis? You'll be pucking about in no time! Americans that play baseball - I've noticed anyway, and I'm shite - pick up hurling MUCH easier than others."
GAA,30zxv8,ringboard,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"With hurling first and foremost comes skill, it will be quite difficult to take it up in twenties. Fitness like any sport a month or two of hard training will get you up to required fitness provided you have a decent level already."

GAA,30zxv8,LuckyNumberFour,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:36:20 2015 UTC,"I'm in an American club and our best team doesn't even compete at America's senior level. These are all athletic guys who practice several times a week, but even the most seasoned of our lot has only been playing hurling for 5-8 years. Find your local club and start there. No local club? Then if you're itching to find one, do that! I recommend somewhere warm so you don't have to take the winter off."
GAA,30zcu9,conordonnelly,2,Tue Mar 31 22:38:10 2015 UTC,New website for my club we've been working on. It was finally launched today. Have a look around!
GAA,30v2ib,conalmcgl,3,Mon Mar 30 23:05:33 2015 UTC,"I'm a hurling man and I very rarely watch a whole football match anymore (Limerick games generally aren't on TV) because I just find that defensive football very dull, where teams are afraid to kick-pass the ball. I think that a change should be made because it's been around for a few years now and I don't see it going away as long as it works.   I don't agree that fans are happy as long as they're winning because there is nothing I hate more than people playing against the spirit of the game (like a hurling team who can't take a few belts and go down way too easy). Also at the end of the year only one team can win the all-Ireland so if most teams adopt the defensive style, that leaves most fans unhappy at the end of the year (as opposed to Limerick losing to Kilkenny in Croke Park last year in a brilliant game where I felt that we could hold our heads up high afterwards).  I have 3 suggestions that may sound terrible to people who are primarily football, but they are what I think would improve the game.  Get rid of the toe-rise. I don't really see how this is a skill and often it just leads to frees being given because of some lad being knocked while he was trying to rise it. I know it's great to see someone come onto a ball at place and get it up into the hand without breaking stride, but that would still be the quickest way of doing it anyway.  Limit the hand-pass. Personally I would prefer to get rid of it altogether but that's probably way too drastic, but I definitely think something should be done to encourage teams to kick the ball more often, like a limit of two hand-passes in a row and then you must kick it. With or without limiting the hand-pass, hand-passing it over the bar for a point should be banned because there's nothing worse than watching a team spend ages working the ball up the field only to handpass it over the bar at point-blank range.  The last one I would say, and the one I really think that they should bring in, is to keep the hand-passing (still ban hand-passing points) but allow Aussie Rules type tackles. The field is probably too small to allow full tackles but I think that defenders being allowed to pull players arms away from the ball would discourage a lot of those relaxed solos and hand-passes from attacking teams.  Again a lot of people would probably prefer to have the game left alone but these are my suggestions on making it more entertaining.  tl;dr: get rid of the toe-rise, limit the hand-pass (and ban hand-passing over the bar), or allow much more physical tackles."
GAA,30v2ib,ClashOfTheAsh,2,Tue Mar 31 09:17:56 2015 UTC,"I'm mostly in agreement with what you are saying, except the toe rise. It should be retained, removing it isn't going to get rid of frees, if I'm standing over a ball about to pick it up (with or without a toe rise) and someone pushes me in the back I deserve a free. Another problem I can see with getting rid of the toe rise (implicit in this rule change is that players are allowed to touch the ball on the ground) is that players will dive onto the ball which would be terrible.   Not 100% convinced about a more physical game, a major annoyance I have when playing is when someone is holding your arm and you can't release the ball to kick or handpass it. That shit is infuriating. So in a way more physical tackles might cause lads to move the ball before they are tackled, but the game might need less players on the pitch and it might just lead to more niggly tackling.   A simple solution other than your limiting of handpasses is to have zones like the Go Games. Full back line can't pass their own 45, half back's and forwards are limited to between their own and opposition 45s, midfielders have free reign of the pitch and full forward line can't come past the opposition 45."
GAA,30v2ib,craichoor,2,Tue Mar 31 11:25:27 2015 UTC,What if you had to be on your feet in order to pick up the ball. I don't think it adds anything to the game and probably slows down play.  I think something similar to go games rules could work.   I think it's being overly optimistic to think that someone will come up with a tactic to counteract the blanket defence and this will all change. This has been going on long enough and their is no end in sight. It is simply the most effective way to play.
GAA,30v2ib,new-account9,3,Tue Mar 31 11:35:36 2015 UTC,"Woman's football doesn't have the toe-rise, instead I think there two legs have to be positioned either side of the football before picking it up. I guess it would be easy enough to implement this into the game if it would definitely improve the flow of the game"
GAA,30v2ib,tsetseflier,2,Tue Mar 31 12:31:08 2015 UTC,"At the inter-county level, with that level of fitness, I absolutely agree with your last point. As the rules currently stand, that is the most effective way to play the game.   Thankfully, I've seen some excellent club football in the last few years...and can't think of a time I saw the blanket employed in-full for an entire game. I do trust and believe in the clubs...for now."
GAA,30v2ib,ClashOfTheAsh,2,Wed Apr 1 13:34:10 2015 UTC,The reason I think to introduce more physicality is to try and put more pressure and fellas in possession and stop them from doing those relaxed solos and point-blank hand-passes. I think the kick-pass is the greatest skill in football and it would be great if we could get it to be used way more often. The zones could work but would it not get a bit crowded in the 45 with 12 lads and a goalie in there?
GAA,30v2ib,craichoor,1 point,Tue Mar 31 13:36:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it might be crowded but it's my attempt at a rule change to counteract blanket defences. And I think it would force more use of the kick pass, if teams are trying to snuff out play at the 45 just let a long ball in and there are 12 lads, man-on-man, there to fight it out. By no means saying that the zones plan I mentioned is perfect, it could do with more tweaking, maybe half backs play from own 20m to opposition 45m.   Suggestions would be welcome as people here can put these forward at their club AGMs and, you never know, they might make it to Congress."
GAA,30v2ib,Rudi89,3,Tue Mar 31 14:05:23 2015 UTC,"I feel it is completely in the rights of teams to play with as many sweepers as they want. I also saw Donegal play some great football in the last few years and feel they are overly criticised. The issue with me is the spectacle. I will happily watch a game of hurling as a neutral but cannot say the same about many football games. I thought the backlash from Dublin-Derry on the weekend was overly severe (the Dubs had an off day), but it was extremely difficult to watch. It makes me think that if the negative tactics continue, it's only a matter of time before some fans become fed up and stop going to or watching games. I agree there will be a new cycle, but I wonder if it will have to be kick-started by a rule change favouring the attacking team."
GAA,30v2ib,new-account9,1 point,Tue Mar 31 07:54:51 2015 UTC,But the thing is that Donegal can only play good football when the other team is attacking. This allows them to get a counter attack in. When both teams are defending Donegal are as bad as any.
GAA,30v2ib,spartan_knight,1 point,Tue Mar 31 12:13:56 2015 UTC,I get the feeling you don't watch many Donegal matches.  http://www.rte.ie/sport/gaa/football/2015/0329/690619-donegal-mayo/  That match was on Sunday.
GAA,30v2ib,As_Bearla_,5,Tue Mar 31 17:09:37 2015 UTC,"Right. I'm gonna of on one here. So bare with me or not. First off. Football was never attacking. Ever. The amount of scores per game has increased in the last 15 year compared to the 'good old days'. Just look at the scoreline of any of the great all Ireland's from the 70's or 80's. This has been the case because of better fitness so players can play full out for the full 70 mins and also the allowance of 5 subs means that a third of players on the pitch are replaced. (Personally I think the greatest misstep by the gaa in recent history) Second. There is no tackle in Gaelic football. Again, in the golden days of football teams players didn't tackle each other. You either hand passed the ball, kicked it or held onto it until you were assaulted. Think the Galway Dublin all Ireland in the 80's.  Personally I believe this is what has lead to the advancement of the blanket. Defence. If you can't take the ball of a player fairly you have to a)force him to try and pass it and turn it over. b) force him to shoot from a difficult angle and play the percentages and hope he misses or c) force him into contact where you crowd him out and he fouls the ball. Either through over carrying or not releasing the ball. Finally. I promise. Football is not good to watch on tv. Being at those 'dour,dull,destructive, puke football games ' is none of those things. BECAUSE  IT'S MY FUCKIN COUNTY OR CLUB. If your invested in the team you want them to win. This is a knockout competition. Winning is what matters. Pundits can't have it all their own way. Criticizing a team for being beaten by 15 points and then ripping them to shreds for winning by a point by implementing a blanket defence.(this is what Spillane did to Donegal).  In conclusion, Football needs help. The demands being put on players is ridiculous. The top 6 counties excluding Dublin spend between 750 and 900 thousand a year on their football teams. The reason I omit Dublin is because they spend so much more that nobody even accounts for. Football has never been more competitive. It is the national sport. look at the crowds at county grounds all over the country this summer. We go because we think our team can win. And that's why it's far from broken. It merely sprained."
GAA,30v2ib,ClashOfTheAsh,3,Tue Mar 31 09:59:14 2015 UTC,"I hear what you are saying but both codes of GAA are constantly changing to meet new developments in playing styles so I wouldn't be afraid to change any rules just because they have always been like that. (at first a goal was worth infinite points, then it was worth 6, then they settled on 3. At first they're used to be whole villages playing eachother, then the GAA made it 20 against 20 (I think), then 17, then they settled on 15 on 15)  When you say that attacking has improved from the 80s, you're probably right, but all you have to do is look at the average inter-county championship game from 5/10 years ago and you have to admit that is a lot more entertaining than most top level games nowadays and I think we should try always be willing to try new things to improve the sport. (hurling tried awarding two points if you scored from a sideline, it wasn't a success but it did no harm to try it in the league that year)"
GAA,30v2ib,Versk,3,Tue Mar 31 13:29:20 2015 UTC,"I believe that teams owe noone, the fact is winning is one of the most important things in football and if there's a way to achieve that regularly by playing a certain way you're going to play that way without a doubt, if you're winning the fans are happy.   Fine, but the sport becomes less interesting to watch as a neutral and eventually television audiences decline, GAA struggles even more to get a championship sponsor and ticket sales start to fall off as the prestige of the whole thing is eroded, and sadly the win at all costs mentality has in effect destroyed the thing it wants to win.  How many people who aren't from the participant counties will watch the All-Ireland final next year if Donegal are in it again? Honestly."
GAA,30v2ib,craichoor,1 point,Tue Mar 31 11:17:56 2015 UTC,"Yea I do see where your coming from there, has there been a definite decrease in viewership since the defensive systems have taken place though? I still think football is a great spectacle, it's just changed."
GAA,30v2ib,tsetseflier,4,Tue Mar 31 12:33:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree with football currently being a great spectacle, I find it hard to watch 70 mins of football unless Cavan are playing (and I have to recognise that the Cavan style of play isn't the most exciting), however I will gladly watch any hurling match. Hurling is infinitely better to watch than football in its current state.   Football needs rule changes to address the current blanket defence and propensity for hand passes, or it will seldom be a great spectacle in comparison to hurling."
GAA,30v2ib,spartan_knight,2,Tue Mar 31 14:12:02 2015 UTC,"After reading through the whole thread, yours is the post I agree with the most. I'm a football man through and through, completely useless at hurling, and even I must admit that an average day of watching decent hurling is orders of magnitude more entertaining than high-level football on television."

GAA,30v2ib,Versk,2,Sun Apr 5 17:14:15 2015 UTC,I know it's Joe.ie but they had a pretty interesting article in response to Joe Brolly's rant here.
GAA,30v2ib,Versk,2,Tue Mar 31 22:42:30 2015 UTC,"I have to disagree with a lot of what you are saying. I feel that football is really developing into a boring sport but I do not blame this on any team or management. They are only playing within the rules and as you say to those involved in any team winning is the most important thing and they are not obliged to entertain anyone.    However, the GAA is operating in an extremely competitive environment from a marketing point of view and can any GAA people argue that gaelic football is on average offering up a better spectacle that the other popular sports in Ireland? While teams getting results is all very well and good, these teams also need funding to operate and a lot of this money comes from the gate which will inevitable decline if the current trend continues. Also , what is the point of sport if it is not entertaining as in the end this is the function of sport in society.   As I already said we can only expect teams to play within the rules so I therefore believe that the onus is on the GAA to make a rule change that will help to reinvigorate the game and make it enjoyable to watch"
GAA,30qqrd,Niall8100,3,Sun Mar 29 22:12:43 2015 UTC,"Being a hurling man myself, I didn't actually watch the football part but I do agree with you.

GAA,2zinik,newbridger,2,Thu Mar 19 00:26:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, saw this during the match. Awful stuff, particularly when you're going great guns and at that stage already 7 points up. Not only that but you already have the free and so you're only trying to push the ref into taking additional action.  Lundy had a fantastic game and it's unfortunate that moments like that tarnish it. People remember them.  There is and always has been bollox acting in GAA, but usually it is to try and run down the clock when you have 2 mins to go and you're up by a point. This shite of pretending your hurt to try and get a man sent off is getting more and more prevalent. There was a time you'd get a smack for it and the ref would tell you to grow a pair but it's becoming an expected part of the game.  Referees should (are they already?) be allowed to reverse a free or turn it into a hop ball for shit like that, or even start handing out cards. Stamp it out effectively. If he had been given a black card for this stuff it would probably have had a big impact on the match and may even have ruined it, but a part of me would think 'that's his own fuckin fault'. There's no need for it, no place for it. Get on with the game and don't be making a fool of yourself and your club."

GAA,2ygcgv,quantumsheep,5,Mon Mar 9 16:17:12 2015 UTC,"Mayo  Style  Generally known to play a relatively attractive style of football, though can be very reliant on hand passes sometimes. Since James Horan was in charge, we learned how to be a bit cute as well using swarm defence and similar tactics. A big attacking strength is, counter intuitively, some of the backs, Higgins, Keegan and Vaughan love to swarm forward and contribute points, but this can leave them exposed at the back. We also have been accused continuously of being one or two better forwards from an excellent team.  Best Players  Cillian O'Connor is one of the best forwards and free takers in the country and Aidan O'Shea one of the best midfielders, big and powerful, though they're experimenting with him at the moment in different positions. Keith Higgins is also one of the best players in the country either in corner back or half forward.  Success  We're GAAs perennial nearly men. We have lost finals in 1989, 1996, 1997, 2004, 2006, 2012 and 2013 with some semis thrown in too like last years classics against Kerry. We haven't won since 1951, (which is apparently down to a curse after the winning team in 51 didn't pay proper respect to a funeral). That said, in recent years we've pretty much strolled to Connacht titles, and we're going for our fifth in a row this year, though there'll be some tough opposition from improving Roscommon and Galway sides this year.   Rivals  Galway are the obvious one, being neighbours and all, and wearing a Mayo jersey around Galway will always draw a comment or two. Kerry are another big one, having beaten us in finals regularly. Meath are another team there is a certain amount of bad blood with too.   Outlook  We have a new management team this year and so there's a little bit of a question about how we'll cope, but we should be there or thereabouts and with any luck we'll finally mange the big one."

GAA,2ygcgv,Tote_Sport,6,Tue Mar 10 01:26:22 2015 UTC,"Tipperary:   Colours: Blue and Yellow Dominant Code: Hurling Playing style: Fast paced with preference to ariel ball  Main Players: (As far as 2015 will go, in my estimation) Padraic Maher - Full back, dominant and strong player. Good under high ball and distrubtion of the ball is usually zonal rather than to a preferred player, he regularly hits the area between the half forward line and full forward line with his clearances, this is to allow players he is passing to to move into the space and attack the ball at pace travelling either towards or away from goal. Weakness, sometimes finds himself under pressure in close quarter battles against quicker players on the elite teams.  Brendan Maher - Wing back, extremely efficient at winning the opposition puck outs, huge believer in work rate, tall and well equipped to play the ball from the air. Runs with long strides and has the confidence and ability to move up the field with the intention of creating and getting scores personally.   Patrick 'Bonnar' Maher - Position Center forward. The man is a work horse, he is in the Army and his fitness is second to none, he's an unmatched combination of pace and physicality in the county, he will not stop running. He plays a short game, rarely takes on responsibility of taking score with a preference to short pass to a man in a better position. He is a prolific goal scorer mainly due to his ability to keep his feet while being tackled en route to goal. he receives a lot of criticism from inside the county fro being 'the forward that doesn't score' this is bullshit (unfounded criticism) spouted by old men who miss the old days.  John 'Bubbles' O'Dwyer - Wing forward. High scorer in games and a specialist for the longrange frees, very good off of both sides, only 22years old so he will have a long career ahead of him with all going well. He is so good that he will often be marked by the oppositions best defender in the halfback line, he is very mobile and loves to help out the midfield pairing.   Seamus Callanan - Full Forward. Plays his club hurling with the well established Drom and Inch, he was the top scorer nationally in 2014, he strikes the close and mid range frees, a beast of a man extremely strong under high ball. Has very soft wrists meaning his control is extremely good. Very accurate from both placed balls and play, some of his scores over the last 2 years have been essentially magical (no look shots with his back to goal sort of things)  Tipps roll of honour is easily found on wikipedia, we last won the all ireland in 2010. It is nationally accepted that they should have won it in 2009 only for shocking refereeing decision, even kilkenny people admit to this. More recently made the final last year, we drew the first game and only for hawkeye deeming a last point just wide we nearly had it. Lost the replay to kilkenny in a disappointing game as the boys were every good for long periods of the game.   Essentially Tipp will play Kilkenny this weekend in thurles. Kilkenny have only one win out of three in the league this year so far so they find themselves under pressure looking for a win. Tipp have won 2 of their three games and will be looking to take advantage of the face that kilkenny will be playing with a slightly depleted squad as some of their players cannot play due to being in the allireland club final which will be played on paddys day.  In Tipp hurling is king but big strides are being made with the footballers too. They will hopefully gain promotion in the league this year and get the opportunity to get to play against better opposition more regularly which is the main thing teams need to progress."
GAA,2ygcgv,TippTheDog,8,Mon Mar 9 23:25:46 2015 UTC,"I watch a lot of football, on TV, in the club, at county games, and I'd like to think I know more than your typical GAA fan, just like your typical GAA fan. Still, I couldn't tell you about all 32 counties and their players because I watch a lot of other sports, but I'll do my best. Dublin are the city team, and all the players come from near the capital. The north side of the city would traditionally be the stronger side in the football, but in recent years it's about even. They're the most successful county in Leinster, with 24 All-Ireland and 53 Leinster titles under their belt. They won the All Ireland in 2011 and 2013. 2011 was a crazy year because it was the first win since 1995, and was one of the greatest games ever.   The team they beat to win that year was the current champions, Kerry. Always a tough team to beat, they have the best record in the country, and you can always count on them to display gaelic football well. Lots of kicking and catching, with an emphasis on long balls, as opposed to dublin who usually play short, fast balls and favour the hand pass. Kerry have dozens of star players and are my favourite county to watch after Dublin.   The team they beat to take the Sam Maguire are Donegal. They have divided the country in two over their tactics, with some saying that it's genius and the future of football (Donegal people) and others saying it's the worst load of shite they've ever seen on a GAA pitch (everybody in the western world). These tactics can be described best as a blanket defense, or ""The System"" which was imagined by former manager Jim McGuiness during his days managing Naomh Conaill and perfected when he took on the management position for Donegal. Ulster football has always had teams like this, but in 2011, Donegal took it to the next level. The heavily defensive swarming style of play, which always leads to a quagmire sort of game around the 45 metre line, involves leaving at least 12-13 men behind the ball, like rugby, and can often lead to the whole Donegal team inside their own half. Games involving them are invariably low scoring, and in popular opinion, serioiusly boring and cynical.   I'll leave it there because I just realised how much I wrote, and I'm starting to run out of things to say. Hopefully you'll have a little bit of an idea who's who in the championship this year."

GAA,2y2esx,tiptopgolfy,4,Thu Mar 5 21:32:24 2015 UTC,I play GK at county u21 level and the best tip I can give is use a kicking tee or cone and make sure to follow through with your kick and take a shorter run up until you get it right maybe 3 or 4 steps. Where you want the ball to go point your hips in that direction. Remember technique is always greater than power. Practise technique and then increase power after that. As for kicking out of your hands GKs don't tend to be kicking 30-40yard passes so practise small 15-25yard kicks practise kicking with your side foot and with laces. Draw a chalk square on a wall and aim for it. All i can think of atm I might edit this later if I think of something else.
GAA,2y2esx,newbridger,3,Sat Mar 7 19:51:01 2015 UTC,"I always set the ball up so that the valve is point up, then its just a matter of leaning back and making sure you get a good connection. Striking it cleanly is more important than power so don't try to hit it too hard or you'll make a hames of it altogether."
GAA,2y2esx,MrBeanGenius,3,Thu Mar 5 23:15:44 2015 UTC,"My advice, use a cone for kickouts, everyone does it, make sure bring your kicking leg right back as far as you can and to kick through the ball.   As for kicking out of your hands, get your body facing in the direction you want to kick and drop the ball onto your laces. Practice short distances first then build it up.  There's some coaching resources on gaa.ie and ulstergaa.ie that may be of use."

GAA,2x8shf,maxrod,2,Thu Feb 26 16:12:34 2015 UTC,Think tickets are around 20euro? You should be able to get them no problem from GAA.ie  EDIT: http://gaa.tickets.ie/ that's the website to get them from but they aren't up yet give it a month or so
GAA,2x8shf,newbridger,2,Thu Feb 26 18:00:18 2015 UTC,Tickets will be prob be 25 or 30 Euro for the stands and 15 Euro for the terrace(hill 16). You will be able to purchase tickets on day from ticket offices around the ground. The games should be competitive as by that point the teams involved will only be a few weeks from starting the championship especially the Ulster teams

Another score would come in the second period as he finished with a hat-trick of points to his name.""  Considering your man has been playing for all of three days, that's not bad at all."

GAA,2veo30,Versk,9,Tue Feb 10 11:09:22 2015 UTC,I don't think you can alter rules to impact on teams' styles of play. There'll be a way around it like every other system and it just needs to be found. That's the beauty of tactics. A rule change to combat systems would lead to manager's wondering what the point is each year.
GAA,2veo30,conordonnelly,4,Tue Feb 10 11:34:29 2015 UTC,"People only complain about the blanket defense when it isn't properly implemented.  Nobody was on about Donegal in 2012 when they roared to the title.  Go back and watch those games against Cork, Kerry and Mayo and try to talk about negative football. Or vs. Dublin last year.  No rule change is necessary, only education.  I may be biased, but I think Jim McGuinness did GAA a favor and helped evolve the game.  His efforts showed that a blanket defense won't win, not unless it's paired with a ferocious counterattacking offense.  Two teams who have mastered this strategy will not become mired down in ugly trench warfare, but instead will actually find themselves playing a beautifully open game as they counter back and forth.  This argument should have died when Donegal went up 2-1 to 0-0 on Mayo in the first 10 minutes of the 2012 final."
GAA,2veo30,robspeaks,2,Tue Feb 10 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"I’m less worried than most about blanket defences. I watched two games last weekend, Meath v Kildare and Dublin v Donegal. The Meath v Kildare game was generally of low standard with two teams that looked fairly rusty but I really enjoyed Dublin v Donegal, it was a high standard game (for the league at least) with lots of action. I didn’t see the other games but Monaghan v Cork and Derry v Kerry looked fairly high scoring.  Looking back at the championship, only one out of the four teams in the semi-finals played regularly with a blanket defence. All three semi-final games were great games including Dublin v Donegal. Dublin played all-out attack but crucially Donegal counter attacked very well at speed. In the final both teams both teams played with a blanket defence however I don’t think that’s what necessarily caused that game to be the worst all-Ireland final I’ve ever seen. It was the fact that both teams looked below par and that Donegal were terrible in attack. Donegal were so slow at moving from defence into attack it allowed Kerry time to funnel everyone back.  If you don’t move the ball quickly and get to the other end of the pitch before the defence can be set then your other main option is to have a target in the full forward line and play off him. Kerry had that in Donaghy and Geaney but Donegal refused to kick the ball into the 45, preferring to pass the ball around the scoring zone endlessly. Murphy was playing out around midfield and they left McFadden inside. Given that McFadden had such a poor year it was inevitable that they would struggle. They only got some traction when McBrearty came on and they played some ball into him.  I personally don’t like the idea of bringing in rules to mitigate certain tactics. It feels like cheating and undermines the integrity of the game. Teams need to learn to move the ball quickly from turnovers into attack to break down the blanket defence and learn to shoot from distance. This should result in a quicker and more skilful game.  My biggest problem with last year’s championship was that the provincial championships were uncompetitive, especially the provincial finals. Roscommon should probably have beaten Mayo in the Connaught semi but Galway were poor in the final. In Munster the two closest games, the semi-finals, weren’t televised and cork didn’t show up in the final. In Leinster nobody could challenge Dublin apart from Laois for one half. That left Ulster the only competitive province. This year I expect that Roscommon, Galway, Clare, Tipperary and Cork to improve on last year which should make Munster and Connaught more interesting and Leinster will unfortunately continue to be a competition for second place."
GAA,2veo30,3hrstillsundown,1 point,Tue Feb 10 11:54:54 2015 UTC,"My biggest problem with last year’s championship was that the provincial championships were uncompetitive   For people who are looking at rule changes, what needs to be looked at the most is the difference in the paths teams have to reach the All-Ireland.  Donegal will have to play Tyrone, Armagh, Derry/Down and then likely Monaghan.  That's just to win Ulster.  Compare that to Kerry, Cork, Mayo and Dublin, who may as well be slotted in their provincial finals already.  That's the most ridiculous aspect of GAA at the moment in my mind."
GAA,2veo30,robspeaks,1 point,Tue Feb 10 16:20:33 2015 UTC,I agree to that the championship as is isn't fair but it would be a shame to lose the provincial championships. Perhaps Sean Kelly's championship structure proposal that would allow qualification for the last 16 of the All Ireland through the league as well as the provincial championships would be a good idea.  It would mean that each province would run off their provincial championship in any way they want (knock out or round robin)with the top two teams from each reaching the Sam Maguire last 16. The other 8 teams would come from the highest remaining placed teams in the league. All other teams would go into the Tommy Murphy last 16. Presumably most of the 8 qualifying from the league would be from Ulster.
GAA,2veo30,3hrstillsundown,2,Tue Feb 10 17:02:59 2015 UTC,"I think it's a bit much to ask to put that much emphasis on the league.  It doesn't give much time for teams to reload.  Also, how would you even pick out the top eight teams from the league when they're split in four divisions?  I should say I don't claim to have any answers and I'm not anxious to lose the provincial championships either.  It's just a frustrating problem."
GAA,2veo30,robspeaks,1 point,Tue Feb 10 17:20:16 2015 UTC,"After watching that Meath/Kildare game, I'm just happy - as someone who plays in the full forward line - to not have to play like Kildare did.   The blanket at the top levels is what it is, and successfully played can even look okay; but games of a low standard grind to an absolute halt this way. I'd rather see attacking and 20 wides than 12 hand passes going nowhere around 65 meters out."
GAA,2veo30,tsetseflier,2,Wed Feb 11 05:39:27 2015 UTC,"In recent years Donegal have put on a few masterclasses in defence which one has to appreciate for what it is. The concentration, orginisation and discipline is a sight to behold at times, but in generalit isn't great to watch and I'd rather that it didn't become the norm.  That said, I'd much less rather see rules put in place to dictate the way teams play. How in the hell could you even create laws to prevent it?"
GAA,2veo30,NamaNamaNamaBatman,2,Tue Feb 10 12:06:07 2015 UTC,"There's nothing wrong with using the blanket defence when the opposing team is attacking. It does the job it's designed to do, which is to prevent the other team from scoring points or goals. A problem arises when the team keeps most of their players behind the ball during an attack. Donegal have been guilty of that plenty of times. They have also shown that they are capable of producing a brilliant counter attack off the back of the blanket defence. We're on of the few teams who can go head to head with Dublin or Kerry. Unfortunately, most of the other teams aren't, hence why they rely on defensive system in the hope that they might secure a win."

GAA,2ur6k8,robspeaks,3,Wed Feb 4 14:37:13 2015 UTC,"There was a gaelic player on Off the ball last year as well talking about concussions he had received while playing, cant remember who it was,but the way he described how it affected him was quite disturbing. There really needs to be an attitude change in relation to these types of injuries from players and managers alike. It may not be apparent at first, but these things can have serious consequences down the line."
GAA,2ur6k8,Steven_You_Nobjockey,3,Wed Feb 4 17:04:34 2015 UTC,What I find interesting is that players/coaches seem blase about it. Both Mickey Harte and Aidan O'Shea have admitted in interviews that their player/they have played on with a concussion as if it was no big deal.
GAA,2ur6k8,robspeaks,2,Wed Feb 4 14:52:56 2015 UTC,I still think there's a lot of ignorance about it.  People don't seem to understand how serious a knock to the head can be.

GAA,2up5pa,Archimoldi,4,Wed Feb 4 13:23:42 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's all been split up far too much. I mean is there seriously any need to have separate subreddits for hurling and camogie?

The more people, the more discussion across all codes, so I will be frequenting /r/gaa from now on. Good idea."

From being over on /r/rugbyunion a lot I think I've become a far more knowledgeable rugby fan. Hopefully by having all the GAA codes here people who are fans of one can get involved in the others over time and add to the discussion."
GAA,2up5pa,Niall8100,5,Wed Feb 4 15:28:27 2015 UTC,Fair play! Hopefully we can get something going! Maybe try drumming up some support from the Ireland subreddit? The Monaghan crest seems to be missing from the flair as well.

GAA,2sin3a,epeeist,1 point,Fri Jan 16 11:11:34 2015 UTC,"There's a balance to be struck. My parents' generation remember when county players had to play on the club team to be eligible for selection. County training twice a week, club training twice a week, club matches once or twice a week, and often a county fixture. And the club matches could be brutal, because some lads would get their kicks from 'getting one over' on the high-falutin county player i.e. trying to cause an injury.   It was too much then as well, but the psychology was very different. The much-needed support systems weren't there, but that also forced players to stand on their own two feet in the real world as well as the GAA - the only thing they got out of playing was pride (and enjoyment of the game)."

GAA,2f3lft,greatestteamever,5,Sun Aug 31 18:14:23 2014 UTC,"I'd back a 'champions league' style system. I don't think moving Dublin out of Leinster would achieve all that much. The focus shouldn't be on catering to Dublin by giving them a challenge it should be to get the rest of Leinster to up their game. Meath and Kildare should be way above where they were this year and that's concerning because they are big, populous counties who should be well able to compete with Dublin.  I don't think all the talk about Dublin was complete guff. Yes, the media went way overboard with the 'unbeatable team' and saying this team 'would dominate football for years'. Anyone who genuinely believed that was a fool.  However, having said that Dublin are still a very good team. They won two All Ireland's and two League championships in four years. Yesterday was their first championship loss in two years and going in to yesterday they had put up an average of 2-23 in championship this year and made it look very easy so I think they deserve credit were credit is due. As do Donegal for shutting them down.  Dublin are still a solid team and will be back next year. Losing one game to a good team like Donegal doesn't erase what Dublin have achieved."
GAA,2f3lft,CanucksFanInDublin,4,Mon Sep 1 08:33:45 2014 UTC,"How about some parity for the Ulster counties putting each other out before Kerry have even kicked a ball?  And why should the whole system be catered for Dublin's needs? Mayo are too strong in Connaught, and Kerry are too strong in Munster. Dublin have enough advantages having the largest playing pool, the best access to sponsorship money and home advantage in every match."
GAA,2f3lft,macca7174,3,Mon Sep 1 10:14:22 2014 UTC,"Honestly, the Provincial system is just archaic at this stage.   The back door and the Galway hurlers playing in Leinster, while I supported them (and still do), prove that they are ultimately pointless guff, to borrow your vernacular.  However, the nature of the championship has an inherent appeal. I've always been one for league style tournaments however, but either way, we all know how much the GAA hates change."
GAA,2ewn4c,CanucksFanInDublin,2,Fri Aug 29 10:06:22 2014 UTC,What an absolute cracker of a first half!
GAA,2ewn4c,micls,2,Sun Aug 31 15:18:32 2014 UTC,"I reckon donegals only chance is to turn in another defensive masterclass. If they try to match dublin, or come too far out of their shell dublin are simply too good all over the pitch.  I think we could see a very similar game to the monaghan one. I really dont think donegal have it in them to even make it close. They havent hit form at all this year. As soon as Dublin get ahead the game will be over."
GAA,2ewn4c,thegoodshtuff,0,Fri Aug 29 13:06:56 2014 UTC,What are your current thoughts?
GAA,2ewn4c,thegoodshtuff,2,Mon Sep 1 02:26:41 2014 UTC,"Haha, I stand utterly and thoroughly corrected. Donegal were unreal yesterday. I do think dublin underperformed in a big way, but that's not to take anything from donegal who forced them into a panic."
GAA,2ewn4c,Mackdafinger,1 point,Mon Sep 1 07:57:15 2014 UTC,"Really looking forward to this. It's going to be interesting to see if Jim has a plan to cope with Dublin. I can't see it being a repeat of 2011 - Dublin are much more expansive and I don't think Donegal are as regimented as they were then. I can't see a Donegal collapse like the game against Mayo last year, but I think the Dubs have far more scoring options. They've got an incredible bench and Donegal need to clone Micheal Murphy and use him both in midfield and the forward line. McFadden needs to find some form. Dublin to get their first real test of the year and eventually break Donegal down and win by five would be my prediction."
GAA,2ewn4c,Mackdafinger,3,Fri Aug 29 12:15:15 2014 UTC,"Sport can fairly make a fool out of you. Superb performance from Donegal, tactically perfect. Dublin lost their way, went man for man, no protection for the back line. McGuinness is some boy!"
GAA,2doyyj,mrtrevoroh,2,Sat Aug 16 03:05:40 2014 UTC,"Stupid question, but why the different hurleys? Is it only in case one breaks?"

My intention was to keep the subreddit active, and in this case, I went about it in the wrong way. When I was first added to the team of moderators, no one had posted in months. The other moderators hadn't been active or didn't have the time to commit to this, so with their permission, I took it upon myself to keep it going for a while. I have a few plans for /r/GAA, but if anyone reading this has any ideas, they would be more than welcome.  More interest needs to be generated in /r/GAA. For that to happen, people need to start posting more links and text posts. To be honest, the subreddit is busier than it has been in a long time, so thanks to everyone that has contributed. It certainly adds more variety because the vast majority of links I posted have been from the GAA website or HoganStand."

Its the fact that it was all direct GAA.ie content all at once. To be honest the /r/GAA fans that are here, know where to go if they want all that information. Why not try to think outside the box and add extra stuff. Like history, stats of previous players, what they're doing now segment once a week or fortnight, Surveys, local county news and behind the scenes stuff.  I know all that sort of stuff needs work and time but I'm sure the info is out there if we all look for it. This is where the likes of joe.ie and balls.ie should be coming for their content.  I'll start adding stuff and it's in every ones interest to add content but not maybe not match reports or articles direct from the GAA.ie  Sorry for being negative with the original comment and title but hopefully it will get people thinking and talking about we can improve the page/feed."

GAA,240yal,Archimoldi,1 point,Sun Apr 27 16:50:41 2014 UTC,"The other three are easy enough to call, but I don't think ulster is that clear cut. Donegal have personnel problems, and despite a good league with promotion haven't played any of the big guns yet. With donegal/derry on one side and tyrone/monaghan on the other I'd be opting for a derry/monaghan final, with monaghan to build a fortress and win out."
GAA,240yal,i_am_just_a_number,1 point,Thu May 15 15:51:24 2014 UTC,"As a Dub... I expect the footballers to win the All-Ireland, not easily but with players like Mannion, McCaffrey and Costello a year older and more experienced I don't see any of them taking a step back. Brogan, Connolly, MacAuley, O'Sullivan and Flynn are still in their primes. We still have some weaknesses at the half back line this was illustrated against Kerry but I don't see any team beating them honestly. If you don't have a six plus point lead on Dublin with ten minutes to go you're going to lose. The bench is extremely strong and stamina levels are incredible.  In Hurling we need to strengthen our forwards. Hurling will be extremely competitive this year with Kilkenny, Cork, Galway, Clare, Waterford, Dublin, Tipp and Limerick are all in with a shout in my opinion. I can see them getting to the semi- finals but there's a lot of good teams this year though."
GAA,240yal,kevstark,1 point,Sat Apr 26 22:29:30 2014 UTC,"I wouldn't have said that Dublin could get better, but after watching their performance against Cork the other week, I would say that unless you have at least a ten point lead against them, they'll just kick it up a gear and roll over their opposition.   Unless Kerry have some sort of secret weapon hiding within their squad, I don't see them soon much damage in the All-Ireland stages. Part of me wants to see Donegal do some damage in the All-Ireland stage, if only that's to do damage as an Ulster team only.   In regards to hurling, I'm not sure what Brian Cody has hidden up his sleeves to combat Clare's fast pace style of play, but Clare would need to do some serious work in their defence if they're to hold onto their crown."
GAA,240yal,As_Bearla_,1 point,Sun Apr 27 01:59:09 2014 UTC,"The hurling will revert to type this year after last years shoot out. Tipp and Kilkenny and Clare will go a long way with a toss up between cork, Dublin and Galway making up the other the All-Ireland semi-finalist. Overall I think Brian Cody has altered his team's style significantly this year to counter Clare's style of fast paced run game and distance shooting.   Tl/Dr. Kilkenny will beat either Tipp or Clare in September Imo."
