SoundersFC,3e41km,dsn0wman,8,Tue Jul 21 20:06:37 2015 UTC,"Someone on Sounder at Heart suggested Keisuke Honda, which would be great. Though the ideal in my mind would be finding a great player from a country that doesn't call them up for international duty, like Oba."
SoundersFC,3e41km,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Tue Jul 21 20:16:48 2015 UTC,"That was my thought too. Target neational teams with young/stacked midfields, and look at the players that are just outside of the senior roster."
SoundersFC,3e41km,nikdahl,4,Tue Jul 21 21:50:59 2015 UTC,KEISUKE HONDA SEATTLE'S NEW ICHIRO
SoundersFC,3e41km,vershastri,4,Tue Jul 21 20:46:03 2015 UTC,If he is anywhere near as good as Ichiro we need to sign him immediately.
SoundersFC,3e41km,Jack2142,4,Tue Jul 21 20:53:18 2015 UTC,"Eh Ichiro is like a baseball version of a Messi/Ronaldo level talent, Honda is a good player and a key part of their national team, but not THAT good."
SoundersFC,3e41km,MowwMoww,5,Tue Jul 21 21:09:48 2015 UTC,"There is no guessing. There are probably a dozen guys on their list and we probably only know who half of them are. Remember Tiffert? Nobody knew who he was, but we knew he was good. Same with Martins to a point.   If I had my way it would be Honda. Still young enough to play for a team for an extended period of time, won't cost insane amounts of money, plays the one position we currently lack (RM), has insane free kicks, and will satisfy the Japanese market that is seriously lacking in MLS and Seattle.   That's just one of a few dozen players I could make a case for. That illustrates how wild a transfer window could be. It could be anybody, but let's just cross our fingers and hope that its somebody."
SoundersFC,3e41km,Debando,3,Tue Jul 21 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Alexandre Pato, 25 years old and his club is also trying to offload him. Apparently he's been playing winger for awhile and has been excelling at it. Could also play striker when Oba and Clint are out. There is the issue of his injury history but it could be worth trying"
SoundersFC,3e41km,sp_the_ghost,3,Tue Jul 21 22:27:14 2015 UTC,With those knees/legs and that turf I wouldn't sign him in a million years.
SoundersFC,3e41km,kingofspain131,2,Wed Jul 22 03:54:10 2015 UTC,I loved pato back when he was with ac milan. We could drop Dempsey to CAM and have Pato and oba up front
SoundersFC,3e41km,stark_weather,2,Tue Jul 21 23:03:58 2015 UTC,My dream is Franck Ribery. Don't know how realistic that is though... Not a big part of the France national team anymore and has said that he would join MLS.
SoundersFC,3e41km,vuduwastaken,3,Tue Jul 21 22:19:06 2015 UTC,"I think Bayern still need him, so hard to compete with that."
SoundersFC,3e41km,nikdahl,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:22:50 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll play much longer...
SoundersFC,3e41km,GuyInOregon,2,Tue Jul 21 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"Sidney Sam isn't signed to any teams right now. Not sure we'd want that mess up in here though. Maybe Nicolás Lodeiro, Lukman Haruna, Ibrahim Afellay, Bertrand Traore, or Ganso?  I feel like the older the player, the more likely they are to considering signing with MLS. But at the same time, we want someone young enough to hopefully be able to take the reigns from Ozzie in a couple years."
SoundersFC,3e41km,FHlogin,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:59:55 2015 UTC,"Sam, Afellay, Haruna, and Traore are definitely not going to happen.  Afellay looks like he might sign with Lazio.  Sidney Sam just failed a medical at Frankfurt.  Haruna signed with Anhzi.  And Traore is staying with the Chelsea first team this season as a rotation option.  The others are a possibility I guess, but I can't see us going for them."
SoundersFC,3e41km,sp_the_ghost,2,Tue Jul 21 23:11:31 2015 UTC,"I know he just got signed by a Serie A team, but i would love to see Pandev come. He's not THAT old, but is still a fairly decent player who has the passing, shooting and attacking intelligence we could use.   Flamini is a free agent this summer and could be a good way to bulk-up our midfield, very versatile.   James Milner just signed with Liverpool, but i could only see him riding the bench, maybe he'll play with the loss of Sterling, but he could be what we need?  Ruiz is free this summer and could be a great addition, we saw what he could do in the WC, but part of me is still iffy on him.  Like other said, Pato, he would be a killer addition especially with his age  Luiz Adriano could also be an amazing addition to our team, he's free this summer, too.  Maybe the most likely, Shaun Wright-Phillips, he's been rumored with NYRB, but if we are able to snag him first, he would be an amazing winger, one that we could REALLY utilize."
SoundersFC,3e41km,FHlogin,2,Wed Jul 22 00:15:19 2015 UTC,Milner is going to be first choice at Liverpool next season.
SoundersFC,3e41km,vuduwastaken,0,Wed Jul 22 03:56:54 2015 UTC,"i dont think he will, to be honest. They sold Sterling for a bit and will probably look to fill the void with a few decent players."
SoundersFC,3e1jzh,Audicity,10,Tue Jul 21 06:27:55 2015 UTC,"Honestly though, pull out a win at Montreal and things really aren't that bad.  Hell, even with a loss, everyone starts to come back the following week and at worst we're down 6 points from top of the table.  Considering the shitshow this month has been, it's not THAT bad."
SoundersFC,3e1jzh,whiskeydrone,3,Tue Jul 21 18:32:41 2015 UTC,"The concerning part at this point is that we've dropped ""easy"" points. Our schedule from here on out is a small but noticeable mark harder than it was up to this point.  So yes, getting everyone back healthy and available should help. But even if we tie Montreal then average 2 PPG for the rest of the season (which, given our opponents, would be quite impressive), that still leaves us on 57 points. We're right on the borderline of falling into ""give up on Supporter's Shield, just worry about CCL and playoff seeding."""
SoundersFC,3e1jzh,stealth_sloth,3,Tue Jul 21 21:10:33 2015 UTC,"Nothing in the MLS is easy. Hell, Colorado was probably our hardest game as they are on a very good winning streak and full of confidence.  I think we have a good chance against Montreal."
SoundersFC,3e1jzh,sounderdude,2,Tue Jul 21 22:25:44 2015 UTC,"I put it in quotes because you're right that there's no truly easy games. But some games are harder than others, and we've played fewer of those harder games so far."
SoundersFC,3e1jzh,stealth_sloth,1 point,Tue Jul 21 22:54:39 2015 UTC,"DC United was our toughest opponent, numbers wise, since the whole US Open Cup fiasco and they're the only team we beat (only because they were down a man majority of the match).  Though you could say our toughest game could have been the Portland 4-1 loss. Arch rivals, in Portland, roster depleted. That sounds like the more tough game now that I type this out.  Besides those 2 games, should have been ""easy"" wins but instead loss all 3 games to 1-0."

I'm not a lawyer, but I seem to recall that ""felony conviction"" and ""immigration status"" are not things you want to mix. On the off chance he were to be deported, what does that do to his contract? I can make some assumptions based on common-sense, but I think we all know common-sense doesn't apply in the law.   edit-to-add: also, does anyone know how long the league's treatment and assessment process takes? How long are we looking to be without him?"

SoundersFC,3dz60c,Fritzed,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:17:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I guess I shouldn't say that I'm trying to find the most expensive seat because it appears that every seat in the place has a pretty good view, especially since it's really a football stadium. I'm definitely okay standing for the whole game. It's preferable, if anything."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,CougFanDan,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:00 2015 UTC,For the most part (excluding a few sections) you don't really have a choice :)
SoundersFC,3dz60c,8gxe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 23:32:36 2015 UTC,"Yes, shouldn't be a problem.    If you aren't particular about where you sit (I mean stand the full 90 of course) you can even wait and buy tickets on the day of the match.  If it's raining, the prices will really drop.  Also you might keep an eye out if S2 will be playing while you're in town.  Those games are fun too."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,8gxe,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:18:25 2015 UTC,"I didn't think selling out would be an issue at all, and as much as I like going with the flow, it would still make me nervous not having tickets in hand. It's still comforting to know that there are pretty much always tickets available, though. I would love to catch an S2 game as well, seeing as we seem to be pulling from them for first team play a little more now."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,byoung82,2,Mon Jul 20 21:26:35 2015 UTC,"If you're going to be attending Seattle U, you'll likely want to hang out on Capitol Hill, where the college is actually located. There is an amazing nightlife in that area, with tons of bars, music venues, and awesome restaurants.   Beware of people complaining about the gentrification of that area, though - it's a pretty hot button issue here in Seattle."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,mautalent,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:24:09 2015 UTC,"That sounds like a lot of fun. The bar/club scene isn't really our thing, but people watching certainly is. Thanks for the suggestion!   Do you know of a common area people live in that go to the U? Are there nice places to live in Capitol Hill? Sounds like it's pretty developed. Coming from Nebraska but having lived in a big city before, I'm sure the cost of living will come as some shock."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,Zorrino,2,Mon Jul 20 20:38:38 2015 UTC,"There are some very nice places to live in Capitol Hill, but it's very quickly becoming the most expensive area of Seattle to live, thanks to its proximity to downtown and some of the well-paying tech companies. If you're not crazy about the bar scene, and don't mind a longer commute to school/work, I'd definitely consider cheaper areas like the U District (lots of student-rate housing available), West Seattle, or further north like Greenwood."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,FAT_Sammie232,1 point,Mon Jul 20 20:55:26 2015 UTC,"I've heard about Belltown, too. What's proximity/cost like there? (I realize this now probably belongs on r/seattle, but I've got a good thing going here.)"
SoundersFC,3dz60c,Nekokeki,3,Mon Jul 20 21:07:02 2015 UTC,Belltown is going to be more expensive than Capital Hill. A new light rail stop is opening towards the beginning of next year in Capital Hill that will make it incredibly convenient to get around downtown from that neighborhood.
SoundersFC,3dz60c,canetrumpet,2,Mon Jul 20 21:25:46 2015 UTC,"Being totally honest, I have no idea what rent looks like in Belltown these days. It's incredibly convenient to all bus routes going in and out of the city (including Capitol Hill for Seattle U), but also has a very active nightlife and can get kind of loud/dirty on the weekends. Great restaurants and bars, though."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,christophermeister,1 point,Mon Jul 20 21:12:34 2015 UTC,"This is still good information, though, so I appreciate it. It's kind of hard to Google this kind of stuff, so this makes it a lot easier in my research. You mention bus routes, so do you think not owning a car is do-able/recommended if living in or near downtown? As for my job, I'm a live sound engineer, so living near venues or at least small clubs with bands is preferable."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,RHCPatGT,2,Mon Jul 20 21:15:22 2015 UTC,"If you live in the majority of the suburbs of downtown, you won't have much of an issue commuting to work. Capital Hill, Beacon Hill, Queen Anne, Fremont, Georgetown, Madrona, U-District, Wallingford, Greenwood, Belltown, Pioneer Square, Ballard, SoDo, and Northgate all have great bus routes and a car would not be necessary. Bikes would be a great option as well as public transport.  Hope that helps!"
SoundersFC,3dz60c,steerbell,2,Mon Jul 20 23:41:07 2015 UTC,"If you're planning on living within 15 miles of downtown, you're going to have a bad time...  Not even cost of living, but cost of RENT is ridiculous. I work in the Bellevue/Seattle greater area and to live comfortably I ended up sucking up the commute and moving to Renton. Not that my situation is anything like yours, but my girlfriend and I live in a 2,400 sq ft house with a 1/2 acre backyard for $1700 a month.  In my opinion, I value the space and luxury of a house like this compared to an apartment (1,000sq ft) in downtown/cap hill/etc for the same price."
SoundersFC,3dz60c,byoung82,2,Mon Jul 20 23:35:54 2015 UTC,"hat sounds like a lot of fun. The bar/club scene isn't really our thing, but people watching certainly is. Thanks for the suggestion!   So if you are looking for live music and want to check out the Seattle U area as well, there are a couple great places.  1. Neumos (probably the number 1 place for up and coming acts to play at) 2. Chop Suey (just renovated so it's lost it's grit but a great tiny club none the less.) 3. Cock Pit (DIY underground space but lots of fun) 4. Cairo (clothing store that moonlights as a music venue) 5. Hollow Earth Radio (local underground radio station, usually have live music every saturday night) 6. The High (Vegan food and heavy music)  Those are some of the ones that immediately come to mind. It's a little early to say what will be playing around town that weekend but late September and early October tend to be the best times for live music around here.  Peace and have a good trip."

We could retake the West or Oba and Clint could be way out of form in MLS and we sink to 5th. We'll just have to see.

SoundersFC,3dx3cv,ProdigalReality,7,Mon Jul 20 07:09:08 2015 UTC,Reminds me a bit of Pappa...good on the ball and has flair but has a tendency to try and dribble through people. Clearly has creative ability so hopefully with some time and work he finds his place in the squad.

He has created many opportunities but without Oba or Dempsey up front, we are not seeing the results of his creativity.  Ultimately he's doing great pushing the ball through mid but he's trying to pass it off and with little support up front it has been all for nothing these last few weeks.  Hopefully his confidence will improve and he can become that attacking midfielder we all need him to be."
SoundersFC,3dx3cv,HowieCosell,3,Mon Jul 20 15:30:05 2015 UTC,"In a vacuum - he lacks the pace and control to make him great on the wing, through the middle he doesn't have much of a shot nor does he track back/defend at any high level (he likes to leave his feet quite a bit and is quite short of box to box in workrate), but overall he holds the ball well and reads the game quite well to make good (not great) passes to create potential opportunities.  At this point in his career, he seems to make the most of his tools and skill set, but I think he still has much growing to do - improving his strength and speed as well as improve his read of the game and his defensive determination (maybe even a dangerous shot could be had).  Hopefully in a couple years we will see such growth and worry about him moving onto some European team in a box to box type role (if he doesn't get the defense part down, I don't think he sticks here as Sigi hasn't shown a fondness for many creative only types).  Otherwise he floats somewhere else trying to fit the Mata/David Silva role, but he's miles away from even being in that conversation.  Outside a vacuum, for this team and how he's played so far - He's been painfully average as I don't think he has enough individual skill to make his own real dangerous opportunities, and he doesn't get the creative support he's looking for in a give and go or having a CM go wide and he tucks in.  He's created some decent crossing opportunities (but not the greatest crosses), he's played in some good overlapping FB passes that turned into crosses, but he hasn't been as successful cutting in to create his own shot or layoff to a teammate for a shot.  Due to the lack of pace in our team, usually the passage of play has take a while to develop which means the defense is in place to clear the crosses, or if he tries to cut in he is immediately double/triple teamed and is unable to find the open man.  He needs more attacking/creative types that he can play with to be more effective as his focus seems to be more in the opponents' half/final third and he isn't doing well going it alone."
SoundersFC,3dx3cv,ragingpandaberr,2,Mon Jul 20 18:40:57 2015 UTC,"He took his best shotso far, which was pretty hard but close(and blocked) by the keeper.

SoundersFC,3dx3cv,PukasScondor,1 point,Mon Jul 20 09:29:55 2015 UTC,"Promising but needs an end product in the final third. Our (honestly not bad) buildup play on Saturday died the moment he and Friberg left the game. He did have a pretty good shot early in the match which was much better than what he was doing before.  Right now my verdict is ""decent sub/rotational player who's being forced to start week-in week-out."" Which is actually above my expectation this season, because I thought he'd mostly be playing for S2. When the team is full-strength he'll probably be on the bench (depending on how much Neagle can piss Sigi off during this stretch) and starting in CCL."
SoundersFC,3dx3cv,SonOfMechaMummy,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:27:31 2015 UTC,I think he also suffers from communication issues he has never played outside of Brazil so might not know much English and some Brazilians  I have met don't really know Spanish either. I doubt any of the Sounders know Portuguese and there is probably a communication gap between players. Several times Thomas and Neagle have done the opposite of what they wanted the other to do for instance.

He'll be halfway through his junior year (or fully done, if he doesn't sign with a team until next Summer). Much easier to finish one year (or 18 months) of school."
SoundersFC,3dvdoe,turneresq,2,Mon Jul 20 21:07:48 2015 UTC,Even if he hadn't chose college ball over the Sounders he'd be at the Gold Cup. He's also recovering from surgery at the moment.
SoundersFC,3dvdoe,Nekokeki,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:08:03 2015 UTC,Yeah I know he'd be in the gold cup. Didn't know he's getting surgery. I'm just tired of Neagle anyway - even when we have all of our regular starters back.
SoundersFC,3dvdoe,Aurick,2,Sun Jul 19 21:09:36 2015 UTC,Klinsmann already stated Morris was left off the Gold Cup roster because of the surgery.

SoundersFC,3dt8td,goodguyatheart,7,Sun Jul 19 05:59:03 2015 UTC,And if he gets injured again? Then what? The point is how pathetic we are without our expensive toys. So pathetic that our rivals can humiliate us and the worst teams in the whole league can earn a win against us. I don't like how our fall from 1st place is in direct correspondence with our 2 big DP's being unable to play for us.
SoundersFC,3dt8td,jack_slammer77,3,Sun Jul 19 07:15:53 2015 UTC,"I think we're in a weird gap year where our veterans are getting too old/inexplicably not producing, and our youngsters are still too young to reliably provide depth.   Next year I bet Roldan will start appearing on the goals/assists chart, Thomas is looking great and he's still adjusting to the league, hopefully our S2 prospects will start providing more depth, Jordan Morris will probably be on board and scoring for rave green, I think we buy down Ozzie and get another DP. Even though Oba and Deuce will be a year older, we'll be a more balanced team.  Until then, we have to live with the reality that we're one of the worst teams in the league without Oba/Deuce, and arguably the best team in the league with them.  Cross your fingers and hope they're healthy for playoffs"

SoundersFC,3dsz2s,MowwMoww,12,Sun Jul 19 04:00:36 2015 UTC,"Alright I have been pretty understanding about our recent skid but you'd think after 6ish games we could find some way to score. Absolutely infuriating, ugh. Freaking rapids. :( see you guys next week, hope we can pull ourselves back together."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,littlenicky174,3,Sun Jul 19 04:06:07 2015 UTC,"We just played two of the worst teams in the whole league with ourselves in a top spot and lost to both. In addition, we got our asses handed to us by our most hated rivals south of the Columbia River. This is total bull shit and I want things to change now. I don't care about Dempsey and Oba. Either way they're not going to be around forever. I want our whole team to be as good as it can and utilized in the most effective way it possibly can be."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,jack_slammer77,2,Sun Jul 19 07:26:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, times like this hurt. I am curious to see why Mansaray and Jones are not getting the start, I know they are still young, but at this point I felt like taking a risk would have been worth it, we didn't field a single real striker (besides Barrett) last night. I think the injury to Craven really hurt us, Sigi probably would have had little time to work with Jones/Mansaray to get them integrated by game day I guess.  As I have said in another thread I would love for us to sign a big name CAM or maybe a striker. But for now we gotta suck it up and hope for the best."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,littlenicky174,6,Sun Jul 19 15:40:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously I'm with you. I've been solidly on team ""wait it out"" but tonight felt different. The Rapids are horrible. And we never really even looked dangerous. I think our season will still be fine once we get our starters back but this has been a rough month and a half to watch."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,steveotheguide,2,Sun Jul 19 04:39:14 2015 UTC,"I disagree that the Rapids are horrible.  They've had some good wins this year.  And tonight, they had a solid defense, a very active midfield early on.  And they finished their chance when they had it."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,8,Sun Jul 19 04:48:45 2015 UTC,"Several disjointed observations:   At some point, we need to stop sucking. It's kinda hot so I'd like a free haircut. Roldan was offside and I thought Toledo was fine. We've now dropped nine points against 3 of the worst teams in the league. Does anyone but Mears (Thomas?) look inspired?  As far as I could tell, he was the only one with appropriate urgency in the last two games.  God help us if he catches the malaise as well. I was annoyed after the Chicago game and I'm less so after this one.  I think I've hit the acceptance stage of grief.   Apologies for the random bullets."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,fragbot,3,Sun Jul 19 05:19:46 2015 UTC,"Aside from his last touch (shoot the ball already), Thomas looked really good and was wanting to try things to get things going."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,mikester01,17,Sun Jul 19 13:58:02 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but this one bugs me a little more than the last recent losses.  I think I'm just getting tired of it.  I'm still not worried season wise.  I think once Clint and Oba come back, we'll get enough points to get a good playoff spot and hopefully make a good run.  But for tonight, I'm losing faith in Roldan.  Thomas is looking better.  Friberg looked good, I'm sure he'll look better with time.  Our midfield continually looses the first 30 minutes.  But even once the midfield takes charge, we still can't create anything.  Frustrating."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,14,Sun Jul 19 04:08:50 2015 UTC,It's because you simply don't lose to Colorado at home. This is the same team that went like 6 months without a win. If the Sounders get beat by them at home then they will be beaten by everybody anywhere.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,thegodsarepleased,5,Sun Jul 19 04:39:33 2015 UTC,"But why do we have to lean on Oba and Deuce so much? This is what I hate the most. We know Oba is prone to injury and maybe so is Deuce as years begin to weigh on him. But shit, what about the fact that Deuce is also a regular call up for the USMNT? Sure, yell at Jurgen all you want, but it happens. My point is we don't have substantial back up when they're gone. Expecting to have a continuous winning streak in the absence of Oba and Dempsey is unreal, but fuck this. We can't win/draw/ score a god damn goal with out these two. That's a serious issue."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,jack_slammer77,2,Sun Jul 19 07:21:59 2015 UTC,agreed.  We need one more solid striker.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,2,Sun Jul 19 15:44:29 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to the guys up front. We don't have anybody to put up top that can hold the ball, score, or create for others. The midfield can only do so much when there is nobody up top to connect with."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,CascadiaKid,1 point,Sun Jul 19 07:03:24 2015 UTC,"Yea, in the Sounders defense, I think the plan was to have Oba during this time and we'd get by just fine like we did last year.    But with Oba injured, there's no one up there who can do what needs to be done."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,7,Sun Jul 19 15:46:24 2015 UTC,"I really think it's time to sign a consistent backup striker. We can't rely on Oba and Dempsey to play every game, and there is nobody who can step in and play anywhere near their level right now. This team needs a true striker who can come off the bench and score goals consistently."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,PeperonyNChease,6,Sun Jul 19 04:17:38 2015 UTC,"With the exception of Alan Gordon, no consistent goalscorers in this league have a reasonable salary AND are willing to come off the bench. I mean I agree with the sentiment of your post, I just can't imagine finding anybody who suits that description and working them in to our roster."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,Chauncemeister,3,Sun Jul 19 04:56:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah it's mostly wishful thinking. Realistically we'd have to groom a player for that role. Perhaps Craven in a few years? I'm not sure. I just know we need another scoring threat, because clearly Neagle and Barrett aren't getting the job done."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,PeperonyNChease,2,Sun Jul 19 05:05:03 2015 UTC,In a few years we'll hopefully have Morris :P but yeah Neagle and Barrett are painful to watch lately
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,Chauncemeister,2,Sun Jul 19 05:06:32 2015 UTC,Ah I nearly forgot about him. Yeah if he signs that could be a huge boost.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,PeperonyNChease,2,Sun Jul 19 05:12:28 2015 UTC,"I think we have the guy we need in Craven. Unfortunately he is injured, and a little inexperienced at this point. Just have to bite the bullet a bit while the coaches get him working well as a first team striker."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,dsn0wman,17,Sun Jul 19 17:35:09 2015 UTC,Good thing we started Neagle.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,XORosaurus,9,Sun Jul 19 04:03:41 2015 UTC,"Lamar ""offsides"" Neagle"
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,benhelioz,11,Sun Jul 19 05:18:06 2015 UTC,I don't know how much longer it will take for Sigi to realize Neagle isn't a striker.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,PeperonyNChease,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:11:34 2015 UTC,I didn't think Roldan played any better.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,3,Sun Jul 19 04:17:17 2015 UTC,"True, but he is also young. He shouldn't have to start every game, and hopefully won't have to once the rest of our starters return."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,PeperonyNChease,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:31:52 2015 UTC,"I don't care their age.  We've got one more game before Clint and Oba are back.  I'd rather see Roldan replaced than Neagle.  I don't know by who though, with Craven injured and Jones apparently not on Sigi's good list.  Who am I forgetting."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,2,Sun Jul 19 04:36:28 2015 UTC,"Uh, really?"
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,sp_the_ghost,8,Sun Jul 19 16:10:57 2015 UTC,"Wait, Neagle played tonight?? /s"
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,FHlogin,4,Sun Jul 19 04:04:25 2015 UTC,"I think, on the field Neagle was the best finisher but he we couldn't get the ball to him or perhaps, he's not good enought at involving himself in the play."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:25:04 2015 UTC,We should have started Darwin Jones.  Even if we lost it would have been more interesting.

SoundersFC,3dsz2s,FHlogin,5,Sun Jul 19 04:02:57 2015 UTC,"That was terrible.  Look, we all agree that it's WAY more fun to win and I wish that we were - so this isn't a ""wow we suck because we aren't winning"" situation.    The fact is that the team isn't gelling and they are in their own heads about the losses.  They don't act like a winning team that is in a losing streak - they act like a losing team when they are out there on the pitch.  And the feel in the stands is frustration and confusion and anxiety about where the team is going.   I hope that the return of Oba, Dempsey, Evans and Frei helps pull the team out of their funk.  For me it's not that they are losing, it's that they look like they don't care the way they used to.   And yeah, the pitch was terrible tonight - looked like a slip and slide."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,cp_trixie,3,Sun Jul 19 04:42:27 2015 UTC,"It was fun when the team was competitive - winning or losing by the skin if your teeth. If we lost, it was frustrating, but that's what next week was for. Seeing this team lose week to week to week, is not frustrating, it is just sad."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,thegodsarepleased,3,Sun Jul 19 04:49:50 2015 UTC,Exactly.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,cp_trixie,3,Sun Jul 19 04:54:07 2015 UTC,So this is what it feels like to be Philly?

SoundersFC,3dsz2s,francostine,12,Sun Jul 19 20:02:00 2015 UTC,"Deep breaths, everyone. Soon, Oba and Deuce will be back together, along with Evans and Frei. Everything is fine.   That being said, what the fuck do Jones and Mansaray do to have to get a chance to start?"
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,btener412,22,Sun Jul 19 04:20:09 2015 UTC,"Remember when the sounders were pressuring Darwin Jones to leave UW to sign with the sounders? Well now he is here, and the absence of oba and Clint is the perfect opportunity for him to make a name for himself yet Sigi keeps him on the bench..."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,AcidCheese5,9,Sun Jul 19 04:33:16 2015 UTC,"Seriously, if Jones is just going to ride the pine than let him go back to starting on S2."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,RubiksSugarCube,8,Sun Jul 19 04:47:58 2015 UTC,"It seriously makes no sense. And tonight we got to see Lamar ""Not A True Forward"" Neagle start alone up top. I'm not a huge fan of Neagle's but I don't really blame him for not performing by himself at a position he doesn't normally play."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,btener412,4,Sun Jul 19 04:44:38 2015 UTC,"Yea, I don't get it."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,4,Sun Jul 19 04:46:23 2015 UTC,Yeah he always seemed hesitant in my opinion about coming here...maybe this was part of it
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,overruns,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:50:15 2015 UTC,Probably because Neagle and Barrett are better and more experienced. Sigi probably feels being with the first team (even on the bench) is more valuable than playing and training with S2. I want to see 'em play too but I don't see the team training every day. Maybe Jones and Mansary just aren't good enough yet.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,CascadiaKid,2,Sun Jul 19 07:13:20 2015 UTC,"If you watch Sigi's interviews when he lists our forward options, DJ isn't even mentioned. The kid as some growth to do before we toss him in."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,vuduwastaken,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:45:34 2015 UTC,"Seriously. And isn't the fact that Lamar and Barrett's inability to produce goals up front in the last 6 or so matches enough reason to try out one of the younger guys? At least Craven is starting to see some playing time, But Sigi needs to let these guys show us what they've got. Neagle clearly doesn't have it."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,jack_slammer77,2,Sun Jul 19 13:33:45 2015 UTC,Craven was injured during practice this week. I think he would have started otherwise.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,vuduwastaken,8,Sun Jul 19 13:46:23 2015 UTC,"Jack2142 put it perfectly: ""We aren't going to rocket back in August either because Dempsey and Evans will probably come back tired from winning the gold cup (hopefully) Martins will be working back from injury and we will have a rash of Champions League games against a really tough opponent in Vancouver as well to top it off. I don't think we will recover and we will squeak into the playoffs again"""
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,FHlogin,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:26:17 2015 UTC,"Even with the Champions League I still think they'll be fine. I think they give Jones or Mansaray a chance, and if not they get a striker sitting on the bench at some MLS team. It can't possibly hurt."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,btener412,3,Sun Jul 19 04:28:54 2015 UTC,"thats the thing, Sigi still prefers to use Neagle and Roldan there rather than bring up these players, i honestly dont see him changing his mind any time soon"
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,FHlogin,3,Sun Jul 19 04:30:57 2015 UTC,"I have no idea. Sigi clearly doesn't trust them enough. If they have no place on this team we should let them go and get some new players who have a shot at starting, or at least coming in off the bench. Wasted roster space..."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,PeperonyNChease,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:33:08 2015 UTC,They are the future of the club. You have to develop talent
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,vuduwastaken,7,Sun Jul 19 13:47:17 2015 UTC,"At this point, some of the blame falls on Sigi in my opinion. We were essentially playing a 5-man midfield today, which is cool, but how can someone make the decision to use Lamar Neagle as a lone striker? The dude's not made to receive the ball with his back to goal, he's better when he can use his pace and technique on the wings. He busted his ass tonight and that's all I could have asked of him when being played in a position that so obviously unsuited for him. Meanwhile Chard Barrett is sitting on the bench, a burly + fast dude with good touch who can be a hold-up forward and win aerial battles with big center backs. If Sigi wants to play the whole lone striker deal, that's great, but utilize your players according to their skill sets!!  Additionally, I love the fact that we recruited a player from Brazil, it was a great idea. But Thomas is frankly, awful. That is certainly harsh, the guy can shoot extremely well and his ball-skill is solid. But, he can't hang with the physicality of the league, he plays way too slow on counterattacks, and when off the ball his movement is poor or nonexistent. I just think our team minus our superstars is performing worse than they should be, and a fair chunk of that I have to attribute to poor decision making on Sigi's part. We can barely find the back of the net, and yet we're playing what on the field looked to be a 4-5-1. And you know what else, what the hell happened to Aaron Kovar?? That man has done nothing but work hard and create chances every time he steps on the field, he's like lightning out there! But instead Dead End Thomas gets the start and wastes 60 minutes of potential creation of chances.   Idk maybe I'm way off base here I'm just tired of seeing this team struggle more than it should without its superstars."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tobiwankanob1,3,Sun Jul 19 05:40:06 2015 UTC,Thomàs is a dead end because there's nobody in front of him making a run worth giving the ball to. He was one of our best players tonight and continues to improve.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,sp_the_ghost,5,Sun Jul 19 16:12:53 2015 UTC,Time to buy a right midfielder. There's too many center mids and not enough outside mids.
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,lightjedi5,17,Sun Jul 19 04:12:55 2015 UTC,"Keisuke Honda, anyone?  Seriously, this is correct. Ozzie needs to go to core player status and open up a DP slot to bring in more talent. It's bad enough that we're going to be sitting in 5th or 6th place at the end of the night, but the club has to keep up with LA, and that is not going to be an easy task."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,RubiksSugarCube,2,Sun Jul 19 04:21:24 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind that. If Dempsey and Martins can return, get Honda or another DP quality right mid and get them to gel that would be great. That means more midfield depth and a better starting squad."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,lightjedi5,2,Sun Jul 19 04:24:13 2015 UTC,"Right midfield?  That was your issue?  Overall, our midfield did the job.  The forwards did not."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,tuttlebuttle,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:32:13 2015 UTC,"In reference to this game no. Just in general, though."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,lightjedi5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:36:24 2015 UTC,What forwards? Barrett was the only one and was only put in at 70'
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,Wineguy33,2,Sun Jul 19 20:57:32 2015 UTC,"I don't understand our play style this year. Admittedly I'm pretty new as a soccer fan so I could just not ""get it"", but this year seems like a big change from the previous 2 years I watched.  I feel like we used to be fast moving and explosive. Our style was to catch them on fast breaks and counters and generally just live on the run. We gave up some goals as a result of this looser style, but we certainly didn't get shut out so frequently and it was exciting to watch.  I've begun referring to this season's style as ""hold up play"" for lack of a better expression. It feels like everyone's first instinct at every turn is to stop forward momentum and wait -- often falling back on back passes. We spend so much more time in our own half this year and it leads to lopsided possession statistics in our favor sometimes, but fat lot of good it does when the final score still includes ""Sounders nil""."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,donzobog,3,Sun Jul 19 04:18:08 2015 UTC,"Clint and Oba have scored more than half of our goals this year. We can get by without one or the other, but losing both is just too much to bear. We're going to be without Clint for at least one more match, and without Oba for at least 2-3 more.   The squad does not have enough depth to compensate. All of this young talent may have been fine in MLS 1.0 or 2.0, but 3.0 is here,  and since our FO has decided not to play moneyball, we are competing with clubs that will have the likes of Keane, Gerrard and Dos Santos. The club is going to have to go spend money on another substantial DP to compete this season."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,RubiksSugarCube,2,Sun Jul 19 04:45:55 2015 UTC,"more than that, You have to remember Dempsey will be coming back tired from starting all but one Gold Cup match... Matches he's been working his absolute ass off in."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,FHlogin,2,Mon Jul 20 03:18:44 2015 UTC,"Perkins should have done better.   I've seen him beaten a few times like this because of ""happy feet"" as my coach used to call it.   If you're feet aren't set you get little lateral motion to make a save,  painfully obvious when you watch the last gif."
SoundersFC,3dsz2s,discgolfjoshsoccer,4,Sun Jul 19 21:34:53 2015 UTC,S2 would have beaten this team tonight

SoundersFC,3dsz2s,hhdslater,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:07:34 2015 UTC,I really don't understand the choice to start the game with no real strikers. I understand Craven was suppose to start before he got injured but pushing midfielders high up the field and out of their position seems like a bad idea. When your this thin I think you need to look past whatever Victor and Darwin have done to get on the shit list of Sigi's and give someone a chance.

SoundersFC,3dsz2s,FHlogin,0,Sun Jul 19 04:07:27 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying we played on a different pitch, but saying that Toledo Ref'd the game the equivalently for both teams is stretching it more than a little bit.   There are excuses, yes, but there are also reasons. The pitch isn't the reason we lost, but it is ABSOLUTELY a reason we looked poor. We had the vast majority of the game, and it's a wonder we didn't keep the draw or sneak out a win."

Neagle needs to be benched. He's not working. I'm getting so fed up of watching him provide nothing.  Being at the game, I could have missed it, but I thought Thomás was having a great game. I was expecting Neagle to go off first, not Thomás.  Pitch was awful, god damn. Fuck Man U and Copa making them switch to that shit.  Fuck Toledo for being a shit ref.  I really hope Frei comes back soon. But especially Oba. We have zero attack without either Oba or Clint and it's pathetic.  EDIT: I'm just going to reiterate what I've said for a while now, at least  2 seasons. Neagle is not good and should not be a starting player in our roster. I question if he's even capable as a bench player but we need to actually see that happen to see how it works.  It has been quite enjoyable to watch everyone join the No More Neagle wagon though."

It's difficult (nearly impossible) to make major changes in the middle of the season but if this shit streak continues, there will be a MASSIVE overhaul this offseason.   To be frank, our fanbase has been spoiled (going to the playoffs every year) and giving up on the team just because they have one off year would give credit to opposing fans who claim we're all fairweather."

I just don't want to watch our team play as a disjointed and ineffectual unit and lose to teams as bad as Chicago and Colorado. This stretch is just as bad if not worse than in 2013.  We aren't going to rocket back in August either because Dempsey and Evans will probably come back tired from winning the gold cup (hopefully) Martins will be working back from injury and we will have a rash of Champions League games against a really tough opponent in Vancouver as well to top it off. I don't think we will recover and we will squeak into the playoffs again.

SoundersFC,3dwlef,Audicity,2,Mon Jul 20 08:05:46 2015 UTC,"There are no rules. ECS just sets a limit on themselves for whatever reason. I believe they also have a rule with Portland and Vancouver to only do one Tifo vs. each other a year, not two."
SoundersFC,3dwlef,MowwMoww,2,Mon Jul 20 08:07:00 2015 UTC,"I knew about the one Cascadia game rule. Wonder why they don't put up more tifos, sure would get more attention."
SoundersFC,3dwlef,Audicity,2,Mon Jul 20 08:21:41 2015 UTC,"I don't think most people do, it just feels like it because we've only done one big tifo this year, for our season opener, and Portland has had two in the last monthish or so and a lot of people are talking about it.   It'll be interesting to see what we come up with for the Whitecaps match in two weeks and against Portland at the end of August."
SoundersFC,3dwlef,Aurick,2,Mon Jul 20 04:05:07 2015 UTC,You'll see a Tifo for the Portland game
SoundersFC,3dwlef,francostine,2,Mon Jul 20 04:18:26 2015 UTC,"We'll see one for both of them. We always do one tifo per home Cascadia match, priority going to matches where the upper deck is opened. That's the upcoming matches against Vancouver and Portland."
SoundersFC,3dwlef,Aurick,2,Mon Jul 20 04:31:09 2015 UTC,"Being involved with ECS and their TIFO crew can only help as far as getting ideas out there, but I assume the ideas for the tifo come from a few individuals brainstorming. Again I'm assuming all of this and I'm not a member of the ECS. There's always the North End Faithful as well. They don't seem to do tifos very often and they are a much smaller group however."
SoundersFC,3dwlef,JustinCasy,2,Mon Jul 20 04:05:01 2015 UTC,"There seems to be some hype regarding the latest Portland one, but can someone explain why a bunch of people holding up the same sign over and over again for three minutes while singing is a great accomplishment?  Figure out where the seats lie, give the person in that seat a black or white piece of cardboard, tell them to hold it up when everyone else does.  Was there something else to that that I didn't see?  I think the huge ones with the art are a much bigger accomplishment.  What they did is a slight variation on what you see in college football stadiums across America regularly."
SoundersFC,3dwlef,whiskeydrone,1 point,Mon Jul 20 18:11:58 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this is fact or not but I've heard that the Timbers Army is supported financially by the club to produce the tifos, whereas the ECS, etc. are solely member funded (although the club does help with logistics). This could be totally incorrect, but if it were true, that could explain why they seem to have the resources for ample tifo game."

Erik Friberg, particularly for a guy who was basically called to start when he'd only gotten off his offseason a week ago, looked pretty decent. I also actually thought Marshall and Scott were having solid games in defense but then they screwed up on the goal, so they're DQed."
SoundersFC,3dt8cz,mikester01,6,Sun Jul 19 09:02:16 2015 UTC,Mears was the most consistent all night. There's my vote.
SoundersFC,3dt8cz,al_assad,4,Sun Jul 19 13:59:41 2015 UTC,lol @ the lack of responses. Pretty much sums it up.

SoundersFC,3dt8cz,steerbell,1 point,Sun Jul 19 09:31:49 2015 UTC,Friberg chased down breaks and moved really well I thought. I think had he been fit and in the game he snuffs out that goal long before it became a threat. He was doing that stuff all night.
SoundersFC,3dslfe,itsallgoodie,2,Sun Jul 19 01:34:11 2015 UTC,"Welp... Sigi has been telling Thomas that he wants him to go farther up field. This is one way to do it.   Alternatively, we did a hard swing away from the solo forward."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,FHlogin,7,Sun Jul 19 04:00:30 2015 UTC,Step one is get our 4 missing starters back. 5 if you count that Pappa just got back from Gold Cup duty like yesterday.     Step two is reorganize the way our midfield plays when our forwards are incapable of hold up play. Our whole team has been playing like they have Clint and Oba because they have for the last yer and a half. They need to unlearn that right now and play different.     Step three I think is sign a brand new shiny midfield DP that can be the creative force there on the same level as Oba and Clint and organize the attack like Ozzy shores up the defense.    I actually think our defenders are pretty good the midfield is just leaving them out to dry because they don't have an attacking outlet like they usually do.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,steveotheguide,5,Sun Jul 19 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"i totally agree, i would honestly wager a bet in saying we have one of the best defenses in the MLS, but our midfield generally lacks in possession play.  While YES we do have a great number of starters out, we should still be finding ways to score and scrape out draws, it's showing how awfully much we rely on Oba and Dempsey"
SoundersFC,3dsz29,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:21:27 2015 UTC,That's the problem when your foundation is missing. We are missing Yedlin's speed right now. With Oba out we are missing that speed that pushes back / opens up backlines. I think Mears is awesome but Yedlin's speed caused problems as you can see during the USA games when Yedlin plays. Speed is the area of need right now till Martins and Dempsey come back.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:53:43 2015 UTC,"but that's the thing, we rely so heavily on our big names, and without them, we are basically useless. when our rivals have their ""big guns"" missing, they find ways to scrape draws or dirty wins. We have not shown any potential to do any."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,Jack2142,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:03:07 2015 UTC,The construction of this roster is built for one thing and one thing one only support the Oba Clint attack. Every single player on this roster except the back up forwards are meant to do that. The back forwards experience (for Barrett talent) gap is so large we are forced to put Neagle up top. We are now asking a player to play a spot were he is filling in for two players of premier League caliber. Which the team was never built for that. I believe the team construction never really had a backup plan for both Dempsey and Martins being out... (might be because they were hoping Jordan Morris would be signed during this time ) But I agree we should be scraping draws or wins without them. I just this B team needs speed to be able to do that. (Which Yedlin and Morris would fit the bill).
SoundersFC,3dsz29,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 20:55:28 2015 UTC,"Last season we had a backup plan in Kenny Cooper, I am about 100% certain he was bought because we thought both Dempsey & Oba would be gone for the World Cup. We traded away Kenny because we needed to shore up other positions and one of Martins and Dempsey were healthy and availiable all season and Neagle or Barrett were able to play off them successfully.   In retrospect trading Cooper may have been a mistake I personally thought he was dead weight on the roster, however I think we could have used him. He was the open cup MVP & Golden Boot last season for instance and vs Portland we may not have needed to put in Dempsey/Oba thus preventing the err... problems. Alternatively he could have been injured like he has been at Montreal and we would be in the same situation except with no Friberg or Thomas signed and even more depleted."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,BugSTi,1 point,Sun Jul 19 22:08:41 2015 UTC,Yes I agree. I feel we were better prepared for this last year with Kenny Cooper plus Evans not being a center back and not called up.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,Jack2142,1 point,Mon Jul 20 00:14:26 2015 UTC,"Shortly after trading Cooper to MTL, he got injured and is out for something like 9months.   It worked out well for us"
SoundersFC,3dsz29,littlenicky174,2,Mon Jul 20 22:36:43 2015 UTC,Yes he got injured but at the same time he may not have gotten injured if he remained in Seattle. As things turned out we probably made the right move because I think Friberg and Thomas will hopefully be useful pieces for the next few years.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,Chauncemeister,2,Mon Jul 20 23:05:25 2015 UTC,"Ah what I wouldn't give for a world class CAM right now. The ideal situation would be two signings, a small name signing of a backup striker AND a world class CAM, but you know whatever works. I know we have been told by management/ownership to just wait this one out and we will get over the hump, but this game felt like the straw that broke the camel's back, ugh."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,philwelch,3,Sun Jul 19 04:46:39 2015 UTC,"To be honest, if we had a world class striker to pair with Oba I think Deuce would be better suited as a CAM. But I agree with the idea of a double signing, and I agree with this game being the straw that broke the camel's back."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,littlenicky174,3,Sun Jul 19 04:58:59 2015 UTC,"Dempsey isn't an attacking midfielder, he's more of a second striker. His optimal position in a 4-2-3-1 might be labeled ""CAM"" in FIFA, but he's more of a withdrawn forward or #10 than he is an attacking midfielder in the style of Kaka or Iniesta or a young Gerrard. Even in that withdrawn position, his role is still too similar to the role of a striker to play him alongside two other strikers, which is why it's never been done. Seriously, you could take any Sounders lineup with Oba and Clint and turn it into a 4-4-1-1 or a 4-2-3-1 with Dempsey in the hole, but it doesn't make tactical sense to put Dempsey in the actual midfield behind two strikers. To do that, you'd either have a diamond formation (leaving Ozzie all alone to control central midfield, because Dempsey isn't that kind of midfielder and the wide midfielders are off on the wings) or a 4-3-1-2, where you sacrifice your width and have three central midfielders behind Clint, in which case there's no room for Pappa and you need more central midfielders anyway. (Playing three at the back doesn't help, because then you need wide midfielders to cover for your lack of fullbacks, and we don't have three starting centerbacks.)   Right now the Sounders could use a DP at winger or central midfield, but an additional striker would be unbalanced."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,Chauncemeister,2,Sun Jul 19 07:00:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah great point, Dempsey could easily slot down into the CAM position, he has done really well at it in the past it seems.  The recent injuries to Oba, really does highlight a need for someone else in the attack. All-in-all that makes a DP striker signing rather alluring."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,Jack2142,3,Sun Jul 19 05:07:11 2015 UTC,"This is true, I do worry about how injury prone Oba has been this season... If this is the beginning of him declining physically, I'd be worried considering his pace is such a large part of his game."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,philwelch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:31:49 2015 UTC,to be fair the first injury this season was someone breaking his nose which isn't really something you expect and doesn't indicate your injury prone really.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,GuyInOregon,2,Sun Jul 19 22:22:40 2015 UTC,Step three I think is sign a brand new shiny midfield DP that can be the creative force there on the same level as Oba and Clint and organize the attack like Ozzy shores up the defense.   Yaya Toure?
SoundersFC,3dsz29,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 06:43:58 2015 UTC,There is no way in hell we could afford Toure.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,GuyInOregon,2,Sun Jul 19 07:07:43 2015 UTC,You sure? Our Salary for players is below 16 mill. The Sounders are always willing to pay big. The major question  is get a player round or above the level of Dempsey or Martins will they mesh and support an attacking Duo and not take from it.
SoundersFC,3dsz29,philwelch,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:34:53 2015 UTC,"I'm sure.  Man City is one of the most cash-rich clubs in the world, and they have no reason to sell.  That means meeting his club valuation and then trying to meet his wage demands.  He is already on ~$15M/year, and would likely want around the same if he came to MLS.  We would be much better off trying to steal a midfielder from a mid-level La Liga or Serie A club.  Trying to pilfer a star midfielder from a top EPL club just isn't going to happen."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 19 17:12:09 2015 UTC,"Yaya was widely rumored to be on his way out, but from the Google News headlines, it looks like City want to keep him. So much for that, then."

SoundersFC,3dsz29,jjspacer,2,Sun Jul 19 20:58:45 2015 UTC,"Stop staring Neagle. Just to see what happens. If it's somehow worse, fine. I eat my words. But we need to try switching things up offensively. Do something different."
SoundersFC,3dsz29,CougFanDan,2,Sun Jul 19 07:11:17 2015 UTC,"Neagle, himself is not the problem, it's that he is a lone striker. If Martins / anyone with pace Neagle would have more space. I want to see what the young guys can do. I want to see  Remick - Marshall - Scott  - Mears Pappa - Alonso - Freberg - Roldan Jones - Craven   This be give your best shot to our young guys. Lamar would get a rest game."

The defense was good too (Doyle's goal was against the run of play and arguably the Rapids one clear chance the whole game). Our problems were in the forward position. Thankfully, that's exactly where the cavalry is going to arrive.   We suck now. When Oba/Deuce come back, we're going to be really good again."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,kinguvkings,1 point,Sun Jul 19 21:18:52 2015 UTC,"True, but Neagle and Rose were invisible and Thomas still looked dangerous when he was subbed (I think his fitness is better at this point). The fact that he used the same old ineffective subs as well (in Barrett and Pineda) is infuriating, considering the promise shown by Darwin Jones and even Andy Craven. It's like he's trying the same old strategies over and over again in this losing streak."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,Schwa142,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:20:13 2015 UTC,Craven was injured in training this week...  I don't know why Jones hasn't been playing.
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,jjspacer,2,Sun Jul 19 13:52:20 2015 UTC,Craven was going to start this game too... I wish Jones started instead
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,jjspacer,3,Sun Jul 19 17:05:25 2015 UTC,I knew these games would be a struggle. We were lucky last season that Oba and Neagle went on a tear during the world cup. These games got worse when Evans got the call up too. Evans in the midfield would fix a few of our (possession / defensive) problems and a team missing it's captain is hard. Our field Generals are both at the Gold Cup and our most talented player is hurt. It's hard to control games when the foundation is missing
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,turtle__________face,2,Sun Jul 19 17:16:48 2015 UTC,"Sigi heavily relies on individual talent to get his team wins (Fredy, Schletto, Duece/Oba). With 5 of our starters out, its no surprise our team has completely imploded. I've said it for years - we need a tactical overhaul. A coach who can come in and preach a certain style of play, get players to buy in, and build something epic. Instead we have zero tactical awareness and hinge our success on a few players scoring cool goals via individual talent (looking at you, Oba). I want a team, not a few successful players."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,sounderdude,2,Sun Jul 19 06:09:36 2015 UTC,"Name a team who has stars that doesn't do this. LA sucked the first half of the season without Keane, despite really good depth, SJ sucks without Wondo. Toronto can't do shit without Gio. Who else is good?  Honestly, we didn't look too bad against a full strength Colorado side that has been pulling out wins."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,gp2042,1 point,Mon Jul 20 17:00:13 2015 UTC,"FFS, has anyone on this roster the past season and a half shown they are talented enough to score consistently when Clint and Oba are out of the line up?   Put the razorblades down. This team is going to struggle the rest of the month. We've known they would since the beginning of the year, knowing its a Gold Cup year. Things would be different if the MLS would observe International Dates.  Everything will turn around in August. Barring injuries, the Sounders will be making their first MLS Cup championship run."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,ajg2345,1 point,Sun Jul 19 08:07:09 2015 UTC,"And it starts again like after every loss - first: there was no one there for the final ball - second: whether it be injuries or national team we are lacking depth up front Lamar is not a natural striker and cannot go at it alone but he is about it up front right now none of the midfielders were pushing hard in the box it seemed like every push was from 20-25 yards out not much testing the keeper at all  Personally I have not been impressed by Thomas he is lackluster aside from his first shot of the game I thought he was average with a few runs but nothing spectacular - as for Friberg this is is first match back and he isn't ready to go 90 minutes that is why he was subbed   It is also funny that no one complains when we are winning no one is calling for Sigi to go when we win only when we lose which is pretty piss poor of supporters as a whole - despite losing 5/6 games we are still in second place and still within striking distance of the supporters shield get players healthy and not have them playing in the worthless all star game and push to the end of the season sure we could have put tons of distance between ourselves and the rest of the pack but that's life and you move on. I believe the players are 1000x more pissed about losing than we are they just need to find the right way to click without ""the stars"" the stars don't make the team but they help by pulling attention to themselves - every team we have played has known they can be more aggressive because Dempsey and Martins aren't there to rip them a new one if they screw up and they don't have to keep looking over their shoulders every 2 seconds that is just the reality of ""superstar players"" we will keep fighting it's not like we didn't have chances the last 2 games - heck we went 92 and 84 minutes in each game without conceding a goal that is impressive just the ball wasn't dropping out way in either game - I feel there were many calls the ref wasn't making as well   TL/DR: yah we lost but we will get back on the horse and try again next week we are still a great team with great chances"
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,ajg2345,0,Sun Jul 19 04:42:58 2015 UTC,"I guess this is subjective but I thought Thomas was the best looking player on the field for the first 70 minutes.    they just need to find the right way to click without ""the stars""   I agree, but over the course of 5 games we've shown our complete inability to do so. The warning signs were there when Deuce and Oba were scoring magnificent goals in 1-0 wins -- Sigi's static coaching seems to work defensively but is utter shit offensively, where he relies on out-of-the-box creativity from DP's to win games.   I love my Sounders to death, and I know we've been a spoiled fanbase thus far, but Sigi's tactics are infuriating when we're doing poorly; there's just no reason to say anything when we're doing well."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,ajg2345,1 point,Sun Jul 19 04:50:58 2015 UTC,"Cp_trixie said this in a different thread and I think this expresses my thoughts about Thomas:   ""Thomas needs to MOVE.  As the guys behind me said ""It's great that he's magic on the ball, but you don't have the ball most of the time so you need to be magic on the field too.""    I thought he was doing great when he had the ball, but I think he was a bit lackluster when he didn't.""  That is exactly how I felt last week in Chicago brilliant on the ball but sluggish off the ball"
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,ajg2345,0,Sun Jul 19 05:14:17 2015 UTC,"I'm going to be the jerk to say it but who would you like Sigi to play? I don't feel Jones can handle the pressure yet and I don't think Barrett can hack it for 90 maybe bring Kovar up but I'd be afraid of that the difference between USL and MLS is pretty big change. I agree Neagle hasn't been tops but he was never ""the threat"" he was the hidden 4th guy threat that you forget about because of the other threats.   As for Thomas I think I had unrealistic expectations because he was hyped to be such a great player coming in. After being at the match in Chicago and seeing him live I really only saw him giving mediocre crosses but at this point I'll take what we can get and what we really need is a clinical finisher so hopefully next week we will discover how to finish in the final third next week"
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,AcidCheese5,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:00:55 2015 UTC,"I thought Jones looked explosive in his debut; definitely rough around the edges but explosive nonetheless. There's not really any pressure on him at this point what with it being the regular season in games we look like we're gonna lose anyways, and even if that is too much pressure then he needs the experience anyways.   Mansarray looks promising to me as well, as does Craven. They look like they have something to prove, as opposed to Neagle who has looked uncharacteristically lackadaisical lately.   I guess the expectations you had of Thomas explain the difference in our perceptions of him, because when we signed him I immediately thought he was a S2 project and so his performances have been a pleasant surprise. But if you expected him to be a starter then I can see how he would look mediocre.   If I had to pick an ideal line up I would have go with  Frei; Gonzalez, Marshall, Evans, Mears; Ozzie, Rose, Pappa, Thomas; Oba, Deuce. But of course with this depleted lineup, I guess I would go Perkins; Gonzalez, Marshall, Scott, Mears; Ozzie, Rose, Pappa, Thomas; Jones, Mansarray  It seems like we've thrived in the 4-4-2 (and clearly struggled in the 4-5-1 or the diluted 4-3-3 we used today) and Remick, while promising in the long haul, is still developing his decision making.   May I ask what your lineup would be?"
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,al_assad,1 point,Sun Jul 19 05:17:41 2015 UTC,"Given the depleted lineup to select from for today's match the only switch I would have made from the start might have been Jones for Roldan - I know different positions - but Roldan didn't impress me today or last week - subs I might have brought Neagle off earlier for Barrett and maybe put Ockford for Rose and push Mears up to midfield (that change instead of Pineda coming on) leaving either Thomas or Friberg on the pitch probably subbed one of them for Pappa   Perkins, Mears, Alonso, Marshall, Rose, Gonzales, Scott, Friberg, Thomas, Neagle, Jones   If it played out the same - Neagle off at 60-65 for Barrett - still same score 70 Ockford for Rose still the same 78 Pappa for Friberg/Thomas"
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,FHlogin,0,Sun Jul 19 05:34:44 2015 UTC,"That's creative, Jones for Roldan. I would probably agree too, Roldan has been pretty unspectacular. And I forgot about how well Ockford played in the one game he started, I think it might be time to use these games to train the next generation of Sounders."
SoundersFC,3dsz9o,Audicity,-3,Sun Jul 19 05:38:54 2015 UTC,"Roldan and Neagle have no business being on the pitch right now. It infuriates me that sigi has kept a similar lineup, loss after loss after loss. We have better players. Kovar has been impressive to me yet hardly sees the field. Mansaray and Jones can't possibly be worse than Neagle."

Expect us to go after CBs in the draft / transfer market. I also don't expect Barret to be here next season either mostly due to not enough playing time for him, but might stay till we sign Jordan Morris (hopefully)."

When it became clear that our available roster was going to be hard pressed to produce results with Clinafemi, Ozzie, Brad, and Papa out, I wish Sigi had just taken the opportunity to put the kids to work, and give them a chance to test their skills against full MLS sides. I can't remember which match it was recently where Marshall and others were out, and someone called the side we fielded ""Adventures in Babysitting with Zach Scott.""  This was a missed opportunity to do more of that - to get the deep bench out there because the odds were low in the first place."
SoundersFC,3dloqb,Ozzimo,2,Fri Jul 17 12:46:46 2015 UTC,Barrett played lone striker vs Vancouver and had a gem of a game. I think you still have to put Barrett's MLS experience over Darwin's speed and youth. Pappa and Ozzie are both back now and that should help with distribution significantly.
SoundersFC,3dloqb,stealth_sloth,2,Fri Jul 17 16:01:28 2015 UTC,"""God knows how many games"" being three? That's how many games Chad Barrett has been in since his injury, and he hasn't even been played full 90 in any of them."
SoundersFC,3dloqb,SonOfMechaMummy,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:05:59 2015 UTC,"Honestly, if Craven hadn't gotten hurt I would have been calling  for one of the two to be benched. But he's not, and I still trust them more than Darwin. He deserves a longer run out than 10 minutes, for sure, but I'd sooner just see us destroy the 4-5-1 and start Andy Rose at CM, benching Pineda.  I guess in my head the best lineup for the job would be  Perkins  Mears - Marshall - Scott - Leo (better defensively than Remick and Mears will probably be relied upon in the attack a lot)  Roldan - Alonso - Rose - Thomas (unless Pappa is actually ready to start but he played 90 vs. Cuba, so I doubt it)  Neagle - Barrett"
SoundersFC,3dloqb,jjspacer,1 point,Fri Jul 17 19:04:05 2015 UTC,I would love   Mears - Scott - Marshall- Remick  Friberg - Alonso - Thomas - Roldan  Neagle - Jones  I would prefer the diamond  formation with Thomas as the CAM and Alonso as the CDM so when Mears attacks Alonso slides into the back line. Or just field a three man line during the attack  Then sub Barrett for Friberg or Thomas depending on performance  (Neagle moves to the midfield) Mansaray for jones then Finally leo for Roldan
SoundersFC,3dmmzk,FHlogin,4,Fri Jul 17 14:37:11 2015 UTC,"Really off and on. Kovar is too good for the USL but not quite good enough for MLS from what I can tell. Jones has been with the first team so isn't playing enough and same with Mansaray.   Craven played really well and was rewarded with a first team contract. Fisher proved his worth with S2 as well and was moved into a bigger role with the main team.   I wouldn't expect a starter to emerge out of the team so far, though. There isn't really anybody that clearly stands out."
SoundersFC,3dmmzk,MowwMoww,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:56:35 2015 UTC,What about Rossi? I haven't watched much s2 in a while but he seemed to be pretty good. What are your thoughts on him?
SoundersFC,3dmmzk,littlenicky174,3,Fri Jul 17 22:02:57 2015 UTC,Started incredibly strong then fizzed out. He's still good and probably the key to the team outside of Kovar and Craven.
SoundersFC,3dmmzk,MowwMoww,0,Fri Jul 17 22:03:46 2015 UTC,"so, probably during the off-season is really when the wheels will begin turning?"

SoundersFC,3dmmzk,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Fri Jul 17 15:15:24 2015 UTC,In terms of players who aren't contracted to the first team? Pablo Rossi and Oalex Anderson are both prospects. If Oalex wasn't off for all of June doing World Cup/Olympic qualifiers I think he would have torn up USL.
SoundersFC,3dmmzk,Jack2142,1 point,Fri Jul 17 21:05:40 2015 UTC,"Personally I think the player with the most promise that hasn't been moved to the main team is Pablo Rossi, I think he has the potential to be at least a decent winger/second forward."
SoundersFC,3djayy,redundantdevil,5,Thu Jul 16 18:55:20 2015 UTC,Honestly thought from the way Sigi was talking about dropping people this week that Andy Craven was gonna get his chance at starting. Now I'm guessing we're looking at more of the same since Sigi doesn't rate Jones at all.

The ball, of course, should be shrunk down and flattened on 2 sides, so it slides better.  Then all they need to do is add the field goals to the end (why bother with a back to a net?

Gonzalez is a good depth player that's probably on his last legs, but Remick is coming along nicely and, oh my god, O'Neil Fisher as a backup/competition to Remick.   Spending big on ""badass LB"" in MLS is like ... I don't know, using $500 sea salt on your steak. Like, yeah, it might make it better, but it's not going to be hugely different from your regular sea salt.   Honda beside Alonso though?   Oh my, yes."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,ravegreener,2,Wed Jul 15 18:37:57 2015 UTC,I think I would die from excitement if we signed Keisuke Honda.
SoundersFC,3de6vd,theREALbmills,2,Wed Jul 15 20:22:33 2015 UTC,"i actually really like the attacking ability Mears gives us at RB, i dont think moving him would be a good idea"
SoundersFC,3de6vd,ravegreener,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:05:30 2015 UTC,"Evans has been a solid CB. Mears is possibly the best RB in the league. We have Correa on the injury list, personally I still want to see what he has to offer. However Remick hasn't been bad either."

They have top players in every position. One of the best left backs, two of the best centrebacks, reigning MVP Robbie Keane and his partner Gyasi Zardes, Stevie F'n G, Giovanni Dos Santos, former West Ham youth product Sebastian Lletget, and a very, very good all around MLS squad. All of these guys facing England washouts like Nigel Reo Coker, Kevin Doyle, Robbie Findley, Lloyd Sam, and Tyrone Mears. At this point it will be a shock if LA don't retain their title""  EDIT: i dont mean to sound negative, but Taco's isnt a big enough signing, nor will make a big enough impact on the league to be able to compete with them. It's sad but true."

SoundersFC,3de6vd,PeteyNice,8,Wed Jul 15 16:58:43 2015 UTC,Who won the supporters shield last year? Wasn't that a 2 game series against LA? Gerry and Johnny two saints have yet to play an actual game in MLS. Besides we don't even know if the Sounders are going to bring someone in.
SoundersFC,3de6vd,tcas3,-9,Wed Jul 15 17:08:01 2015 UTC,Who has won 2 of the last 3 cups and 5 cups total? the supporters shield is almost irrelevant if you dont go on to win the cup.
SoundersFC,3de6vd,sounderdude,8,Wed Jul 15 17:11:03 2015 UTC,"False.  The Supporter's Shield shows the team with the best overall season record.  The Playoffs can be won or lost due to all sorts of things, from a single blown call to a lucky shot.  The Supporter's Shield is by far the better determining factor in which team was better overall."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,sounderdude,3,Wed Jul 15 17:39:59 2015 UTC,"What im getting at is, at the end of the day, the only thing that matters, really, is the MLS Cup. Much like the stanley cup. It does not matter who finishes first at the end of the regular season, what truly matters is being able to add another star (or the first) to a kit"
SoundersFC,3de6vd,bkelly3,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:41:14 2015 UTC,"I understand where you're going, but dismissing all of our team's hard work last year because we didn't go on to win the cup is just plain silly.  The President's Trophy is likewise a very prestigious award to win, and not something to be tossed aside like yet another Grammy award.  Do I truly believe we'll be able to compete with LA this year?  Not really... but there's always the possibility, and I'm itching for a chance to watch a fully healthy Sounders team up against LAG."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,cantbeassed,5,Wed Jul 15 17:43:58 2015 UTC,Okay go support LA then if you care so much about their trophies. We'll remain here and have faith that the best front office in MLS will pull through for us.
SoundersFC,3de6vd,cantbeassed,-2,Wed Jul 15 17:34:07 2015 UTC,"what are you talking about? they are setting the benchmark for the MLS and we are behind, theres nothing wrong with wanting more from your team when they're fully capable of doing so."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,SeaGooner,7,Wed Jul 15 17:37:53 2015 UTC,"We're only going through this crisis because both Oba and Demps have been absent five weeks now and we've been watching non-performing replacement forwards. This conversation wouldn't be happening if we were slotting two goals a week like average. The FO might have a huge signing tomorrow they are keeping under wraps, who knows. But at full strength I do know that we ARE title contenders even while LA will be training tired end of season Euro stars."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,cantbeassed,2,Wed Jul 15 17:44:11 2015 UTC,"I disagree completely. Even if we had won the four games we have lost since this started and were sitting on 44 points, that changes nothing. LA is leaps and bounds better than we are now. You can cling to the SS as something as valuable as MLS Cup but that is ridiculous. The regular season in all US sports is just a way to separate out the bad teams before the real thing starts. I'd always rather sneak into the playoffs and walk off with the trophy than be the top seed and crash out like we did last year.  Our team is not getting any younger. The time for big signings is this window, not in winter.   The ""best front office in MLS"" is clearly in LA. I don't see how this is even a contest. Beyond their dp signings, their youth setup is excellent.  I don't consider MLS Cup or SS realistic for this team. Winning Cascadia is the only trophy I see as possible for us this year unless a major move happens."

But as ManU has shown the EPL, stacked players doesn't create a good team all the time.  Honestly I still think Keane and Zardes are La's two biggest assets. And hopefully for them Gio as well.  Frieberg isn't a comparable signing. Our upcoming signing A) B) or C) will be more comparable. but even then it will probably be a lesser name who looks to strategically pair well with Oba and Dempsey."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,sp_the_ghost,-3,Wed Jul 15 16:50:12 2015 UTC,"who is ""you""? im a sounders fan XDDD but the thing is, we have to make bigger and better signings than Tacos if we want to even attempt to compete with LAG. He's a good addition, but when it comes down to it, we are out-numbered, and its really beginning to show."
SoundersFC,3de6vd,ScottishSeahawk,3,Wed Jul 15 16:52:56 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And I think our FO knows this. I bet we will get a lower profile a'la Martin's like player. Around the 1-3 million range. Big impact, but not so well known, kind of like Martin was when he came.  That seems to be our motto that works well for us and Lagerway's way of doing things. We are a great team who gets a big bang for our bucks. Which I like."

SoundersFC,3dblo8,tuttlebuttle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:28:35 2015 UTC,I'd be surprised if Neagle leaves.  I think Sigi likes his versatility and effort.  But our team definitely has some weak links.  It's not a bad idea for Garth to give them a reason improve their performance.
SoundersFC,3dblo8,tuttlebuttle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 02:18:06 2015 UTC,"I like Neagle, I do, and I agree him leaving isn't as likely as Chad.

SoundersFC,3dblo8,vershastri,3,Wed Jul 15 02:40:39 2015 UTC,Sigi almost never does a 4-3-3.  But it's true that we don't have a very good back up striker.  I hope they can find someone good.
SoundersFC,3dblo8,tuttlebuttle,1 point,Wed Jul 15 03:24:55 2015 UTC,"He's been running some weird lineups. I think a 4-3-3 could work really well with us, when we have a full team, especially with how good Clint is at dropping back and starting an attack. It's pretty much a 4-4-2 in transition and a 2-5-3 when attacking."

I don't think I've ever run as much in any other formation than that. So with that in mind, I don't know if we have the right batch of players that fit the criteria to be able to successfully play a 4-3-3, as someone like Pappa would be hauling ass every game and would need to help out significantly more on the defensive side than ever before."""

Many teams run a 4-3-3 very well, and as mentioned before half the time it's a 4-4-2 because Clint always drops back, Friberg and Pappa attacks and Alonso stays deeper. I am not saying it's the best possible formation, just that it could be really well. However, I am not a coach so maybe I'm wrong."

I would surprised if we ended up with any new big names in this window though based on what he's saying. The truth is is that you can't have some kind of huge reaction to the current situation because the current situation is kind of a perfect storm of bad luck/timing. When Oba and Deuce and Brad get back in August our confidence will be up, we'll be scoring goals, the defence will be looking even better and we'll be back on track. In the mean time we've got weather the storm. I think we can pull in 3 points this weekend and I'm looking forward to the match."

I say blame tournaments like the Gold Cup or International Friendlies. I think there should be a limit on the number of players that can be taken for competitions like the Gold Cup. There are 63 total players missing from their teams during this tournament. link to source Because there are teams that have 2-3 players missing and others that have up to 5-6 players missing due to this tournament, but then there are teams that only have 1 player missing for the Gold Cup (Colorado, Columbus, NYCFC, Montreal, Chicago) - yes it is great that Dempsey, Evans, and Pappa are all representing their countries. However it says to the MLS fans - screw you national teams are more important than your club team so get over it - and I don't think we should have to get over so many players missing especially when they are key players. The MLS needs to do something about this because during this time the games are watered down when all the best MLS players aren't playing. Sure it is great for development of the academy players but then you get people like us who get pissed off when they don't perform like the stars."

SoundersFC,3d1321,RutzPacific,6,Mon Jul 13 00:48:33 2015 UTC,"Saw him doing lateral work, finishing, running, passing, and jumping. He's getting there. Still separate from the team though."

SoundersFC,3d1321,my_lucid_nightmare,1 point,Mon Jul 13 00:15:57 2015 UTC,We just have to get him fit for the playoffs.  Nothing else matters this year.
SoundersFC,3czb95,FHlogin,18,Sun Jul 12 03:41:20 2015 UTC,"While we all know Neagle isn't a great technical player he does have a place on this team. He has an incredible work rate and when confident he has a knack for poaching goals. He is a guy who needs to come off the bench though, not starting especially in a position when we are counting on him to be our main goal scorer. Off the bench attacking guys who have tired legs and all the pressure isn't on him he can have a positive impact."
SoundersFC,3czb95,overruns,12,Sun Jul 12 05:32:33 2015 UTC,"I can't overstate his work rate. During the Red Card Wedding he was running his ass off until the end of the game, drenched in sweat, and covering the whole field for the game."
SoundersFC,3czb95,HazardSuitor,1 point,Sun Jul 12 16:24:11 2015 UTC,"Ok but if his work rate (which is not contributing to goals or assists) is the only reason he still has a place on the team, that seems very inefficient, for lack of a better word."
SoundersFC,3czb95,vershastri,10,Wed Jul 15 17:13:07 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely about Azira.  He appears to have a stunning ability to make his teammates objectively worse.  I attended the Portland game in person and I'm 90% sure he was the reason there was so much open space between the top of the 18 yard box and around 30 yards out.  It seemed like the Timbers were just given ownership of the area.  To be fair, I don't understand midfield positioning that well but he always seems to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Paraphrasing Raylan Givens, ""if you meet a jerk in the morning, you met a jerk.  if you meet jerks all day, you're the jerk."""
SoundersFC,3czb95,fragbot,0,Sun Jul 12 04:29:51 2015 UTC,"good point, and the quote definitely holds true. But it goes back to the original point, i am 99% sure that we could find a better replacement for the same price (maybe even a bit more, but i cant say that an investment in the position would be horrible idea)"
SoundersFC,3czb95,hottoddy,3,Sun Jul 12 04:39:22 2015 UTC,I hope that Friberg's return means CDM depth looks more like Ozzie > Gonzo > Rose > Roldan > Azira (with Rose and Roldan both higher on depth chart for OM.
SoundersFC,3czb95,playa2,9,Sun Jul 12 15:10:34 2015 UTC,"You guys do realize Neagle is a MIDFIELDER playing as a POWER-HOUSE FORWARD, much how Brad Evans played as the lone forward in ... I think the 2010 season?  We all remember how great that turned out. F'ing horrible.  He isn't a lone striker. Sigi knows this. He isn't bad, he isn't great. He has moments of brilliance and moments of ... mediocrity.   Honestly Sigi's consistent weakpoint since leading the sounders has been that he has never had decent depth in the striker position.  That being said, he's done quite well with MLS's salary cap and the fact that you can't exactly have a Samuel Eto'o or Didier Drogba coming off the bench. Neagle is not great, but not bad for a 2nd striker.  ... Just be thankful it isn't Brad Evans again ;p lol"
SoundersFC,3czb95,foxpawz,5,Sun Jul 12 11:33:50 2015 UTC,Moments of mediocrity? Mediocrity is kind of his MO. It's more like moments of total awfulness and the rare moment of brilliance with mediocrity the rest of the time.
SoundersFC,3czb95,bigdawg98031,1 point,Mon Jul 13 01:13:38 2015 UTC,I agree completely. Neagle misses more goals than anyone on the team. He is mediocre with flashes of terrible. A quality attacking player would sink one once in a while. The thing is he just doesn't have any individual moves or creativity. He relies on others to get him the ball in situations where it is simple to score.
SoundersFC,3czb95,al_assad,1 point,Wed Jul 15 23:32:45 2015 UTC,Neagle's preferred position is actually forward. Many have said that that is his best position as well.
SoundersFC,3czb95,radeky,-1,Sun Jul 12 20:20:58 2015 UTC,Hes a good forward winger.
SoundersFC,3czb95,MowwMoww,15,Tue Jul 14 05:14:30 2015 UTC,"Counter argument is that every single time Sigi is asked about Azira he is usually has a glowing review -- and we all know Sigi has absolutely no problem speaking about a player that is underachieving. Azira is not the problem, he just isn't Ozzie so it's easier to blame him. Pointing out one problem in the team when there are 10 problems on the field isn't really going to turn out well. Nobody is playing well currently because it is a team effort. It's extremely easy to look at the defense when the team is losing but how can you blame the defense for the team's misery when the team as a whole has scored only 2 goals in 5 games? Azira isn't to blame for the lack of scoring. He is a defensive midfielder. How many assists does Alonso have on average? Simply put, defensive mids aren't tasked with holding the ball and playing in passes. Defensive midfielders aren't Michael Bradley. Their role isn't to sit deep and play in the pass-before-the-pass leading to a goal. Their role is to make tackles and get the ball. When your team isn't scoring it is hell on a defense because the pressure is always on.  I've defended Azira for a long time and I will continue to do so, just like I have ragged on Neagle and will continue to do so.   I want to again get into some stats in the game rather than subjective ""eye tests.""   The game on paper wasn't a disaster. I've only seen the highlights but I will go back and watch in a bit to see if it is really as bad as people say it was. On paper, the game was completely even. A 1% difference in possession, the same passing accuracy, nearly identical total passes, but the difference comes in the final third with both offensive shots on target and defensive crosses allowed and shots allowed. Seattle lost in all three of those categories, which obviously made the difference.  Azira was in from the 83rd minute. Based on the reactions I see here, it would seem like he was in the entire game and played like dog shit. That isn't the case. He was subbed in for Roldan to try to close up shop. In that time, Azira managed 4 successful passes and one unsuccessful pass. Not exactly mind blowing stuff, but for less than 10 minutes that's a pretty big portion of the ball. Okay in that area.   Where he did lack, however, is defensively. But it's not for any of the reasons you might think. The ball didn't even come close to him in the final minutes that he was on the field. In fact, almost all of the attack came from the wings, a place where he is almost never going to venture because he isn't marking those guys. No, he isn't Alonso. Nobody is Alonso. Alonso doesn't give a shit about his position and runs the entire length of the field doing anything he wants to do because he is Alonso. He has his nickname for a reason. Azira is coming on as a sub with direct instructions from Sigi, presumably to close up the middle of the field in the final third. In my opinion, that was a success. The only passes you saw probing the defense were from balls deep outside of the offensive third for Chicago over the heads of our defenders. In fact, if anyone was to blame for allowing multiple chances on goal, it was Alonso. Why is nobody criticizing him? After all, in about the 87th minute he was directly responsible for a near goal, except Perkins made a fantastic save and then two defenders slid in, definitely committing a penalty foul, but didn't get called. You could say that he should have marked better on the counter attack during the 92nd minute that lead to the goal, but he is marking two people. If he steps up, which he did, he still has Remick to his left flank to cover the guy running down the wing. What happens? Unfortunately, he gets nutmegged -- very unfortunate. But Remick is playing center back as Marshall casually jogs back, even stopping for a second mid-jog to watch the pass be played in. That goal had absolutely nothing to do with Azira. He was playing the ball, not the runner on the wing, which is what he is supposed to do. I really suggest to the Azira naysayers to go back and watch the 10-ish minutes he was on the field to reflect on what he really did. Just stare at him. If you still have criticisms for him after that then we'll talk.   This is exactly the type of thing I see so often when seeing people rage after a match. Blame being shot in different directions because everyone is so scared to criticize their favorite players. It happened with Neagle and look where he is at now.   By the way, it took this squad 92 minutes to concede a goal on the road. Yes, it's Chicago. They're terrible. But it's still an MLS team that failed to score over 92 minutes until a counter attack off a last-ditch effort to put everyone forward for a corner kick.   If Pineda finishes his chance from 6 yards out instead of passing it to a defender, this game is 3 points in the bag or a draw at the very least. Refocus your anger toward the players that deserve it, not a defensive midfielder that was subbed on in the 83rd minute to see out the game.   As for Neagle? Well yeah, he's shit. You should have listened to me two years ago when I was saying the same shit.  e: Watched the final 20 minute, probably watch the rest some other time."
SoundersFC,3czb95,fragbot,4,Sun Jul 12 09:44:02 2015 UTC,"Here's my problem with Azira:  I don't trust him at all to not give the ball away.  It's one thing to work to get the ball back (I'll give that to him) but why bother when you almost always just give the ball back.  Watching the Portland game, it was infuriating how much center space was consistently left between the top of the 18 box and around 30 yards out.  If the CDM isn't the person to clean that up, who is?  I don't have an exact count of the open shots they had from distance but it was farcical.  I mentioned the turnovers before.  When I expect you to pass the ball right back to the other team and put the rest of your team back on its heels, I didn't just pick that out of thin air.  I grew that disdain from numerous observations (NB:  Alonso used to annoy me with this but he's a dream comparatively) and it's easy to fix--don't write checks your body can't cash."
SoundersFC,3czb95,vuduwastaken,3,Sun Jul 12 14:58:09 2015 UTC,Just watched the highlights. I think you are being a bit harsh on Marshall. He was cutting off some passing angles into the middle and trying to contain.
SoundersFC,3czb95,ravegreener,2,Sun Jul 12 12:10:55 2015 UTC,"Agree completely, except for Neagle. Marshall fucked up on the goal. He should have forced Johnson to the outside, making for a more difficult near post shot (which Scott has covered), but instead invites him to cut inside where he has the entire goal to shoot at."
SoundersFC,3czb95,vershastri,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:44:24 2015 UTC,"The run didn't begin as a result of Marshall's actions. Azira didn't defend properly causing Johnson to break away. What happens in the final third is sometimes unavoidable. Look to the very beginning of the goal, not towards the end."
SoundersFC,3czb95,vuduwastaken,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:10:40 2015 UTC,I don't have the time / setup to do it properly but perhaps a touch highlight for Azira might be good so people can see what he's doing. Maybe include some off the ball positioning too?
SoundersFC,3czb95,KDFilm,1 point,Sun Jul 12 12:01:23 2015 UTC,The final 3rd stats have more to do with our formation right? I've been screaming it for weeks now - the 4-5-1 is the worst formation you can play with this team. Barrett and Neagle aren't consistent or good enough to be a lone striker and get the job done. The stats in the final 3rd prove it imo. I would love to see us switch to a 4-4-2 or 4-3-3 this weekend against CO.
SoundersFC,3czb95,buttstuff2k15,2,Mon Jul 13 17:13:44 2015 UTC,"Well considering neither of them are starters on an ideal 11 they are fine. Lagerway has been bringing in new midfield talent to replace them with Thomas and Friberg. Now that we have Craven to help with the forward depth neither will see minutes as more than a sub. Neagle is valuable as a late game attacking option when searching for a goal. Once all of our players are back Azira probably will be lucky to even make the 18. We have already begun to move on from them but we haven't had other options lately considering injuries, international duty, and suspensions."
SoundersFC,3czb95,Ozzimo,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:56:59 2015 UTC,"When we have a full squad, these are the first guys off the bench for RM and CDM respectively. Neagle can still be a scoring threat when he has Dempsey and Oba taking pressure off of him and Pappa and Ozzie feeding him. Azira is having a great year honestly and he's our only answer if Ozzie needs a break.  We, as a team, had a shitty game today. It's not any one player's fault."
SoundersFC,3czb95,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 05:57:22 2015 UTC,I think we should move on from Azura. we will soon have to have a Alonso replacement in mind / in development and Azura isn't it. He is too close in age with Alonso (2 years different). Though I think he is good for now. I believe the same for all our players. Like how Jordan Morris will be Dempsey's / Oba's replacement. Roldan is Pineda's replacement and so on. Finding and Developing young players is key to continually winning seasons. Then it would make sense to draft for / look for a young DCM and developing him after this season or the next.
SoundersFC,3czb95,Wineguy33,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:44:18 2015 UTC,"Neagle is useful on the wing and Azira is the only player on the team who can slot in for Alonso. Friberg coming in should be a big boost to the team. Thomas is a wasted signing in my opinion. The guy needs to develop with S2. We will never score with the one forward formation, yet Sigi insists on it. If Sigi can give up the one forward formation and we get Friberg, I think the team starts turning around. A few players are playing themselves out of contracts right now though."
SoundersFC,3czb95,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 14:46:02 2015 UTC,"I would love to see jones or craven start a match. Instead of Barret. When friberg gets here, him start over Pineda. Pineda still feels a like he is playing with a nagging injury and he is 32 not overly old but getting up there for playing 90 minutes every game. Barret is a spark plug off the bench. Just look at last year's  7 goals and he already has 3 this season. That said I think we need to start jones or craven to get experience and since Barret is great off the bench that makes it even better."
SoundersFC,3czb95,Jack2142,1 point,Sun Jul 12 15:22:57 2015 UTC,"Neagle shouldn't be the focal point of an attack, he struggles when people expect him to be our primary attacker. He saw alot of success last year as the ""wildcard"" attacker. Two years ago Neagle & Martins were somehow our most effective striker pairing, last year he was lethal on the flank, and was one of the best attacking mids in the League.   This year he has been asked to step up and unlike Barrett/Craven/Jones etc. he has been forced to go a full 90 or almost as many minutes every game up top. He hasn't had to play this much consecutively in the last few seasons and I think that  has lead to his ineffectiveness. Every few games he comes out and seems to play really well then lapses back into being shit.   Personally I think Sigi should bench him and start Jones or Craven. Last season Neagle dipped in form in July was benched then scored 3 really nice goals and a pair of assists in the next three games."
SoundersFC,3czb95,vershastri,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:16:52 2015 UTC,"A dead clock is right twice a day. Just because he MIGHT do something towards the end of the season doesn't warrant a position on the team, let alone the bench. I say it's time for him to move on."
SoundersFC,3czb95,siahlsounder,1 point,Wed Jul 15 17:07:59 2015 UTC,"Say what you'd like about Neagle....but I honestly don't understand why Azira is still on the roster. He plays like he's in the NASL. Terrible positioning in the midfield, terrible tactical touches, and a near-total inability to create attacking opportunities in the transition.   As /u/fragbot said, he has a stunning ability to make the players around him worse. The best example of this was in the second leg of the Conference Finals against L.A. last year. He came on instead of Marco Pappa. A friend of mine, who was watching the game with me and didn't know any of the players on the pitch (and thus didn't come in with a bias), said it was the worst impact he'd ever seen a sub have on the flow of a game.   We need to make the second rung of our players, after our solid starting line, much much better. Starting with Michael Azira being traded to a lower-division team."
SoundersFC,3czb95,Audicity,1 point,Sat Jul 18 15:39:35 2015 UTC,"i totally agree, hopefully tacos is here to take him off our payroll. I can honestly say, if thats true, the greater majority of SFC fans would be ecstatic.  And it's quite funny, because when i came on for LA i knew then that it was going to be a bad game"
SoundersFC,3czb95,CosmoThor,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:12:40 2015 UTC,"I've never liked Neagle. I've thought he brings down the quality of the team for quite some time now.  In all honesty, about time everyone sees it. He only looked OK with Oba and Dempsey around. Now that he doesn't have star players around him, his true quality shows."
SoundersFC,3czb95,jjspacer,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:41:56 2015 UTC,"I've been saying all season, Neagle is a great attacking mid but not a great striker."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,hhdslater,26,Sun Jul 12 02:34:02 2015 UTC,"That sinking feeling in your stomach when you see Azira subbing in...yep, you were right.  If you're doing a defensive sub, why not Gonzalez?  Can anyone explain to me why Azira gets playing time?"
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,fragbot,9,Sun Jul 12 02:46:14 2015 UTC,I have no explanation. Sigi's subs have completely baffled me at times. It's like he is just pulling numbers out of a hat.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PeperonyNChease,-36,Sun Jul 12 02:50:33 2015 UTC,I bet he can't even remember the last time he saw his own dick.

SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PappyPoobah,-16,Sun Jul 12 04:50:09 2015 UTC,My point still stands.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,BobbyAyalasGhost,2,Sun Jul 12 06:12:47 2015 UTC,"Ive said this so many times. I don't know why we don't trade Azira. Not saying he's a bad player, and he's getting better but I don't think he fits our formula"
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Dayvido,2,Sun Jul 12 08:40:01 2015 UTC,Gonzalez really would have been my pick for that time in the game.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,2,Sun Jul 12 16:49:57 2015 UTC,"sigi wanted a tie, not a win, so trot out Azira."

SoundersFC,3cz4t2,steveotheguide,5,Sun Jul 12 03:31:42 2015 UTC,Our back up attacking players should be able to average more than 2 goals in 5 games.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,16,Sun Jul 12 16:49:07 2015 UTC,Ok I'm glade everyone here saw what I saw. Azira blowing it in the 91st minute to hand the 1-0 win to the Fire. I was dumbfounded that he came on. What in THE actual fuck?!
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,RADMFunsworth,3,Sun Jul 12 02:53:12 2015 UTC,Yup. Totally got smoked on that attack and allowed the ball to get into open space behind him.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,2,Sun Jul 12 03:11:25 2015 UTC,"What I saw (and this may not be popular opinion) was Azira was in a 2v1 and had no support, which means his teammates were out of position. Marshall was backtracking next to him and could have gone to the ball allowing Azira to follow the runner. He didn't. Later on as they pushed down the side you see Remick sitting in the box marking nobody. Had he pushed up to help Azira by marking the runner (and he should have given this guy was their right most attacking player) it would have allowed Azira to mark the guy on the ball.  Azira did dive in which was stupid, but its not his fault he's in a 2v1. And I cant help but to think Alonso would have done the exact same in his position."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Looorney,16,Mon Jul 13 18:12:41 2015 UTC,I am so very tired of Azira and Pineda.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,steerbell,9,Sun Jul 12 02:35:53 2015 UTC,"He was a good addition last season to the midfield, but he's just been dropping in my liking throughout this year. Today, he couldn't even seize an opportunity when it was right in front of him (literally, the ball was at his damn feet). It's like to make a firm decision to shoot it, he would have required 3 hours of deliberation and a meeting with the grand council to give him the go ahead."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,6,Sun Jul 12 03:05:28 2015 UTC,"Pineda seems like he has been dropping off this season.  Was it me, or was he much better last year?"
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,2,Sun Jul 12 16:50:39 2015 UTC,last year he seemed slow but decisive this year he seems slow but indecisive (A bad trait)
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,steerbell,2,Sun Jul 12 21:40:09 2015 UTC,"He's got chronic ankle problems that just won't let up, and seem to have gotten worse this year. He spent a lot of the season either unable to play / practice full-intensity due to injury, or playing / practicing in spite of injury. Unfortunately, it shows.  He was fantastic for us last year - one of the best shuttling midfielders in the league. He rarely did anything flashy, but just quietly made the rest of the team far, far better. He was the unsung hero in our Supporter's Shield run. For a couple weeks at the start of this season it looked like he'd pick up where he left off, but... too many health issues.  Yesterday wasn't all bad from him. He had a slow start, but when we tightened things up and took control of the match around the 20th minute, that was in large part down to Pineda settling in. And when he ran out of gas around the 70th minute, that was also when Chicago got back in charge against us.  The bottom line is we can't be as heavily dependent on him as we are. He's just not healthy enough. We should be looking at him as an option off the bench or a 60-minutes sort of guy who gets played only when we absolutely need him, rather than someone we try to eke every possible minute out of."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,stealth_sloth,3,Mon Jul 13 00:22:25 2015 UTC,Freiburg can't be ready soon enough
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,francostine,11,Sun Jul 12 17:03:13 2015 UTC,"Chicago played their hearts out, and deserve the win.  But...  Disappointing for us to concede in the dying minutes like that. Should have held on for that 1 point."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,pyky,5,Sun Jul 12 02:43:05 2015 UTC,"They totally did. With some better finishing, they could have been up 4-0. We had some decent chances, but they opened up our defense and gave themselves way more opportunities at goal than we did to them."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,2,Sun Jul 12 03:07:12 2015 UTC,Which makes it that much more frustrating that they just collapse in the 92nd minute :(  I hope we bring in that 3rd DP soon. Preferably someone who won't get called up internationally... ;)
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,pyky,11,Sun Jul 12 05:02:15 2015 UTC,"It doesn't seem like our depth has changed all THAT much since last season. Yet during the World Cup last year, our reserves were doing much, much better on their own without our DP's than they're doing without our DP's during the Gold Cup this year. So why the fuck is this shit happening? We had a decent lineup out there. Should've won against the worst team in the Eastern conference (no offense Fire, I actually like you guys and I'm happy for your win, just wish it wasn't against us). But seriously, we were so fucking lazy and deserved to lose. On the counter that led to their goal, Pineda literally took about five whole seconds to decide he needed to start heading back to our half, and when he eventually did that, he was just kind of walk/jogging. Fuck me..."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Jack2142,16,Sun Jul 12 02:41:36 2015 UTC,I think our biggest loss of Depth realistically has been Evans...  Think oh Pineda is injured who starts in mid... Brad Evans. Damn Yedlin made the worldcup squad cool who do we play at RB... Brad Evans. Neagle/Pappa are playing bad on the Wings... Brad Evans. Now we have Evans starting at CB (When he is here) and that takes away our number 1 depth option.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,3,Sun Jul 12 02:56:15 2015 UTC,"Damn, true. He is versatile af."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,5,Sun Jul 12 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Sounders have a hard time opening up the opposing defense to create opportunity. After some time of possession without moving forward, they just kinda give up and lob a long one which often times we don't win. No good counter and no good ground passing to move play up. That's where Martins and Dempsey stand out and have the technique to dribble through and find each other in tight spaces."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,philwelch,5,Sun Jul 12 02:51:30 2015 UTC,"Indeed. That's also why I made this comment about getting another attacking DP. As great as Dempsey and Oba are, if we played with two forwards and had Dempsey play as a trailing forward/attacking midfielder, we could splice open opposing defenses so much easier and simultaneously control the tempo of the game more effectively."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,joylongdivision,3,Sun Jul 12 02:55:00 2015 UTC,"He totally owns attacking mid. Look, he scored two 3 goals in two matches for the US in Gold Cup from that position. Plus with his vision and passing, he could really link up some good plays as an attacking mid."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,FHlogin,2,Sun Jul 12 02:59:40 2015 UTC,"This, so much this. And playing attacking mid is how he became a great player over at Tottenham. I'm getting really, reeeaaaally tired of Sigi playing him as a striker, when it's obvious that attacking mid is his forte.  EDIT: Yes... Fulham, we happy now? And isn't supporting striker basically exactly what I described? Withdrawn striker, attacking mid, tomatoes-tomatoes."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Skeppsholmen,2,Sun Jul 12 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"And playing attacking mid is how he became a great player over at Tottenham.   You mean Fulham? Even then, he only played behind one other player usually. Three forwards (and Dempsey is more of a withdrawn forward than an attacking midfielder) is an unbalanced use of three DP slots."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,wunwuncrush,3,Sun Jul 12 04:06:27 2015 UTC,"And playing attacking mid is how he became a great player over at Tottenham.    He became a great player at Fulham playing supporting striker/plain old striker, so I'm not sure where this is coming from. He played wide at Spurs and was pretty underwhelming tbh.   Otherwise, of all the things we're going to talk about, we're going to talk about breaking up by far the best striker partnership in MLS?    I'm getting really, reeeaaaally tired of Sigi playing him as a striker, when it's obvious that attacking mid is his forte.   It really isn't. Did you watch the Haiti or Honduras games? Honduras he was playing striker and scored two goals so I'm not really sure why that one's up for discussion, and Haiti he scored as soon as he moved up top after an underwhelming first half in the midfield.   I don't really disagree that out and out striker isn't exactly the best place to play him, but let's not pretend like he's some creative force whenever he plays in midfield either because history just doesn't back that up. At Fulham, his best time with a club he was a supporting striker or out and out striker, Tottenham a wide midfielder, and for the US primarily supporting striker as well, running the channels, pressuring, and receiving the ball in midfield if need be, but not looking for it back there.  Again, I don't disagree with the idea that much: the more Dempsey can get on the ball the better for us, and he doesn't get on the ball tons as a striker, but I feel like we've got more pressing issues, most notably midfield.   Sure we can go out and dick a bunch of money on another DP level striker, and we'll probably score a lot more goals than we do now, but why bother if the rest of the team is going to look like it does? We've seen enough of the Sounders scoring tons of goals and leaking in tons of goals since 2009 to know that doesn't work for shit."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,0,Sun Jul 12 04:15:00 2015 UTC,Seems to me that the only common denominator in essentially every one of these situations is the coaching.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,johnnyseattle,9,Sun Jul 12 05:11:23 2015 UTC,"This is a bottom of the table team without Dempsey and Oba.  Yet, we even lost the possession balance 49-51%.  Our midfield is really a collection of CDMs, and have difficulty breaking down even the worst defenses in the MLS.  We really need to find a true CAM."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Skeppsholmen,8,Sun Jul 12 02:56:18 2015 UTC,Totally agree.  Ozzie is the only person in our midfield right now that I even remotely trust.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PappyPoobah,2,Sun Jul 12 03:02:38 2015 UTC,"As much as Pappa can frustrate me, he does inject a bit of creativity in the attacking side of our midfield."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,lightjedi5,13,Sun Jul 12 16:54:54 2015 UTC,"Has Thomas been in the squad long enough now for me to say I'm not really impressed with him?  Just doesn't seem like the type of player a club would chase for a few years like we did with him.   Azira wasted no time in demonstrating why I can't stand him. Total olé to let the striker get by unmolested. Perkins looked great all match, ruined at the end by the worst possible sub. Good we've got a competent replacement for Frei when we need him.   I love the USMNT and all, but damn do we need Dempsey back ASAP. Not enough teeth in the attack without him or Oba."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,lightjedi5,7,Sun Jul 12 02:43:01 2015 UTC,Well Thomas was a Serie B dropout.  Can't say I think he was anything other than a prayer or a project. He has some technical ability though.  Perhaps he needs to get more MLS match experience.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,slythytoav,2,Sun Jul 12 04:06:00 2015 UTC,"He needs to focus on the simple shit like tracking back on defense and looking for easy passes, not the perfect chip that Lamar can't finish anyway."

SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,14,Sun Jul 12 03:22:01 2015 UTC,"What an awful game. brings on a DM (Azria) gets scored on Wow. we have really out-done ourselves this time! I get it, we are missing people, but so is almost everyone else. We need to stop using the absence of a few players as an excuse for mediocrity, if we want to win a cup anytime soon, we need depth, and thats something we are lacking. We look like we are in a lot of trouble.  P.S. Lamar is garbage."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PappyPoobah,3,Sun Jul 12 02:36:12 2015 UTC,"Can Sigi stop starting Neagle? Let one of the younger guys start. Worst that happens is that we see that Neagle is clearly the best active striker we have (though I highly doubt that). Switch things up, Sigi. Clearly Lamar hasn't proven anything positive."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,7,Sun Jul 12 02:40:47 2015 UTC,"it's getting to the point where these games feel like a joke, yet we want to call ourselves a top club"
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PeperonyNChease,7,Sun Jul 12 02:41:46 2015 UTC,"We are a top club... When we have our two crutches named Martins and Dempsey under both arms. I hate how exposed the team suddenly is without them. This isn't basketball, we need more balance."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PeteyNice,6,Sun Jul 12 02:45:05 2015 UTC,Welcome to the MLS. This is nothing new and we (as well as every other team) rely on our DP's to do magic. We can't build a quality team without DP's and we can't build a solid bench because we'd go over the salary cap. It's a major flaw in the system and games are vastly less exciting to watch without a high level of play (as was the case tonight).  Only change I think Sigi could have made would have been starting sometime else over Neagle and subbing Leo instead of Azira. We are severely lacking in depth and there's not really a good way to overcome that.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,FHlogin,2,Sun Jul 12 04:47:32 2015 UTC,I think I would have said screw it and start Craven over Neagle.  And Leo might have been the difference in the Fire's eventual goal.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,SophisticatedIce,2,Sun Jul 12 16:57:55 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Worst thing that can happen is we sub Neagle back on. We desperately need scoring threats, and yet Sigi isn't willing to test players."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,pomrascal,2,Sun Jul 12 03:08:51 2015 UTC,"We have scored 25 goals this season. 14 by Dempsey or Martins.  While other teams may be missing players, I do not think any other team is missing that kind of contribution. Attacking players are expensive so ""attacking depth"" in MLS is almost impossible unless you have kids who can step in. Sigi clearly does not trust Jones or Mansaray so we here we are.   I hope for Tacos next Saturday and that no one gets hurt before everryone comes back."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,GuyInOregon,2,Sun Jul 12 02:45:47 2015 UTC,"exactly, and that shows how we rely too much on them, when other teams were missing their top players, they found ways to struggle ties or even a win, but we are just shit. we literally cant create anything w/o the two, which is quite scary. Given the fact they are on the wrong side of the 30's, what does the future have in store for us."

SoundersFC,3cz4t2,PeperonyNChease,5,Sun Jul 12 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"Lost five of our last six and only scored three goals total.  This team is completely lost without Dempsey and Martins.  They look like they are just a bunch of strangers wearing the same outfit.  This is just awful.  edit  As others have noted, the fact that Azira was brought on that late is mind boggling.  Schmid does not know what the hell he is doing."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,radeky,3,Sun Jul 12 02:36:57 2015 UTC,That sub made absolutely no sense. Sub on an inexperienced defensive player in a tie game? Brilliant.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,pomrascal,6,Sun Jul 12 02:43:02 2015 UTC,"Here's my best guess at Sigi's thinking with that sub...  The only players we had on the field who were consistently opening things up and creating space were Alonso and Mears. But they were playing deep enough that we were often unable to convert that space into meaningful chances.  So put Azira on to take care of slowing down and cleaning up counter-attacks, and that frees Mears and especially Alonso to push forward more aggressively and hopefully get us a winner.  Of course, the plan falls apart in shambles when Azira fails to clean up a counter-attack and Chicago score on it."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:57:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm no expert. I'm sure he has some kind of tactic in kind, but clearly Azira was the wrong choice."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,yummyorangejuice,9,Sun Jul 12 03:05:02 2015 UTC,"It always frustrates me how negative the comments in here are after a loss.  Look in last week's thread and you won't find a single disparaging comment about Sigi, Pineda, Azira or Neagle.  But look in here and it's all over the place.  C'mon everyone.  We're better than this.  I get that we're frustrated we're losing games but we really aren't the same team without Dempsey and Martins up top creating goals and opportunities for everyone else.  Don't blame the players we have left for the fact they're unable to perform roles that two All-Stars perform on a regular basis."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,droundhouse,4,Sun Jul 12 05:13:38 2015 UTC,The complaints against Pineda and Neagle have gone  back a while.... They have played like crap for over a month now. Azira had never played well for us consistently... He's gotta go!

Our players were hacked down all game by Chicago with Pineda, Mears and Marshall all being pulled off the field. Why were we playing a 4-3-3 when we have never done that before."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Jack2142,3,Sun Jul 12 02:42:39 2015 UTC,How Azira still subs/starts is beyond me. Came in and did literally nothing to the game except help Fire pick up their goal. I would have much rather seen the substitution spent on Neagle who looked absolutely gassed.   I think I also have to agree with /u/MowwMoww at this point. Neagle was completely useless this game and looked like he wanted to spend more time getting acquainted with the ground then with the ball. So so so let disappointed.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,SvanirePerish,3,Sun Jul 12 02:35:58 2015 UTC,I welcome everyone to the fuck neagle bandwagon I've been riding for quite some time.

SoundersFC,3cz4t2,SvanirePerish,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:40:11 2015 UTC,"OK, we have to accept the supporters shield isn't likely to happen based on how we're likely to be at the end of the month. However, on the bright side, we are (hopefully) going to be signing a new DP defender (at CB, and moving Brad to RB) and Friberg is going to be joining Alonso in the midfield, and we will have Dempsey and Oba back. So the team will look pretty good."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,banemaler,6,Sun Jul 12 02:38:17 2015 UTC,Why would we sign a DP Defender at CB and move Evans to RB when we already have a perfectly good player for that position?
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,francostine,2,Sun Jul 12 02:39:58 2015 UTC,"Where else would we sign a DP player? Do we need a 17th midfielder along with Alonso and Friberg, or do we need three DP strikers? Evans is much better at RB every time he plays there. He can't get forward into midfield nearly as much at CB, and he is GREAT at being comfortable playing high, as seen by his assist versus Germany. Two really solid CBs would benefit this team a whole lot."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,overruns,6,Sun Jul 12 02:53:45 2015 UTC,"Right Wing or Left Back honestly, as evidenced by my flair I really like Neagle and think he can be a good player who has done terribly this season. However in an ideal starting 11 he is our weakest player. If we got a DP winger along with Friburg we could move the ball very well through the midfield.  The other alternative is Left Back. Personally I was not a fan of Remick last year... and am not a fan this year. I feel while he adds stuff going forward he gets caught out of position alot."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Jack2142,2,Sun Jul 12 03:04:22 2015 UTC,"I think Evans, Marshall, DP Signing, Mears would help the team the most. We already have like 17 midfielders, many of which are young and developing. A below average midfielder doesn't affect a game as badly as a below average back line player."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,joylongdivision,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:06:46 2015 UTC,Friberg should insert some creativity going forward.  What we need is a finisher.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,jack_slammer77,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:00:35 2015 UTC,Why do we have to sign a dp?
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,SvanirePerish,5,Sun Jul 12 17:06:33 2015 UTC,We aren't moving Brad to RB since Mears has been so good all year.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,SvanirePerish,3,Sun Jul 12 02:39:57 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I don't want to see Mears move. I'm honestly fine with our current starting defense of Mears, Remmick, Marshall and Evans. If we did get another DP, I really wish it would be another forward. I'm so tired of only playing with two forwards. If we could get somebody to join Oba up top, and then have Dempsey play as a trailing, attacking mid, that could be lethal as fuck. And then Dempsey could hold up in the midfield more often to help control the tempo and possession, so our midfield would be Alonso, Roldan, Pappa and Dempsey(ish). That's how I would do it at least."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,stealth_sloth,3,Sun Jul 12 02:47:54 2015 UTC,"I still think we have lost alot defensively without Leo, but I suspect this is his last year with the club. I think one of the reasons we were pretty good early on despite missing Alonso defensively was him."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,Jack2142,1 point,Sun Jul 12 02:59:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't really think Remick offers much on defense. Perfectly suitable going forward, but he was hiding behind Azira on the goal tonight (watch it again, he's as much at fault as Marshall/Azira IMO) and has been caught out multiple times by average attackers this year."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,FHlogin,2,Sun Jul 12 04:18:35 2015 UTC,Mears was the best and most consistent player on the field today. Really taking the ball up field himself on the offense and played solidly to lock up our right side against Chicago. Possibly covered more ground than any other player on both sides.
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,francostine,1 point,Sun Jul 12 03:09:44 2015 UTC,"He wouldn't replace Mears, he would replace Remmick. Evans is great as a fullback, he isn't a true CB and he is outstandingly comfortable getting forward into midfield since it's where he always played, which got his assist versus Germany. Mears, DP Defender, Marshall, Evans as a backline would be fantastic, then you have Neagle, Alonso, Pappa and Friberg in the midfield and Oba and Cilnt up top. That's a good team."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,SvanirePerish,2,Sun Jul 12 02:56:44 2015 UTC,"Hey, Yedlin is supposedly on the market. If we're getting a new outside back, why the hell not go for him?"
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,GSShenanigans,2,Sun Jul 12 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"Yedlin is a below average defender, and I love Yedlin. I think he will only ever make it as a winger, and Jurgen sees that as well. I'd rather have Yedlin than Remmick, but that's not a high bar. Yedlin isn't close to DP worthy."
SoundersFC,3cz4t2,atheocrat,2,Sun Jul 12 03:14:00 2015 UTC,"Hopefully the bleeding is just about over. Home against Colorado is a match we absolutely should win, even with our absences. Away against Montreal, we might start having some players available again. If we can pick up three points from the rest of this month, that leaves us in a position where a strong finish could still see us grab the Shield."
SoundersFC,3czlrw,SonOfMechaMummy,6,Sun Jul 12 05:38:43 2015 UTC,Mears? I guess. Can we get Oba and Friberg in our starting 11 asap please haha.
SoundersFC,3czlrw,littlenicky174,6,Sun Jul 12 06:48:25 2015 UTC,Perkins.
SoundersFC,3czlrw,tacogrande7,5,Sun Jul 12 15:57:49 2015 UTC,I would say Perkins. He had a few good saves.
SoundersFC,3czlrw,k_princess,3,Sun Jul 12 17:11:25 2015 UTC,"Roldan this was his game. he had the opportunity to score, and put in some dangerous balls that should have resulted n goals."
SoundersFC,3czlrw,ravegreener,1 point,Sun Jul 12 19:28:08 2015 UTC,Roldan's best match so far this season for sure. I still think Perkins is MOTM as he kept us in the match for 91 minutes.

SoundersFC,3cyt9c,USA_A-OK,3,Sun Jul 12 07:41:31 2015 UTC,"Part of the problem with Tiffert apparently was that he thought he was being brought in to play CM and didn't really want to play wide mid, and then ended up being forced to play wide mid a lot. That was a weird one. I liked him too."

He's considered by some Schalke fans to be a locker room cancer, and to not work very hard in training.  Many even accuse him of taking games off.    That said, I suppose many in Europe also criticized Oba.  I think he's proved the detractors wrong so far.  But if I were the GM, I'm not sure I'd take the chance on KPB."

SoundersFC,3cyt9c,Nekokeki,3,Sun Jul 12 15:36:43 2015 UTC,"No chance, he's being linked to teams like Manchester City. Not that I wouldn't also love him."
SoundersFC,3cyt9c,KineticDiabetic,3,Sun Jul 12 16:08:10 2015 UTC,De Bruyne has been tearing up the Bundesliga and I see no reason why he would want a step down to the MLS at such a young age. Obviously I'd love him but that would be one of the most surprising transfers of all time
SoundersFC,3cyt9c,SeaGooner,2,Sun Jul 12 16:40:02 2015 UTC,"lol are you serious? You got some high hopes. I was thinking Abou Diaby. Injury prone yes, but he would compliment Ozzy so very well in the backfield and he is exceptional moving forward. Very good upgrade to Pineda"
SoundersFC,3cyt9c,joylongdivision,2,Sun Jul 12 18:59:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're totally 100% out of left field, sorry.    He is out of contract   He's contracted until 2019  De Bruyne is crazy talk, he just had a record breaking year (most Bundesliga assists ever) and is linked with clubs like Man City, PSG, Chelsea, or Real because he wants to win the CL, something he doesn't see Wolfsburg doing. He's already getting paid absolutely tons at Wolfsburg, because that's what they do, it's just a matter of if they can help him get to where he wants to be career-wise that's fueling rumors IMO."
SoundersFC,3cyt9c,rophel,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:11:21 2015 UTC,"Montero is one of these options, I'd bet.

SoundersFC,3crp76,littlenicky174,2,Fri Jul 10 06:01:21 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen any news about this pop up here so I thought I would post it. I am really glad to hear Frei is progressing well, when I first saw the collision I thought he would be out for a lot longer. I'm disappointed that we will probably not get to see Friberg play Saturday, I have a feeling this will be an uphill battle, hoping for the best though."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,mrye06,3,Thu Jul 9 18:58:22 2015 UTC,Upvoted and I hugely love this idea. Make it happen Sounders and Reign!
SoundersFC,3cphmj,Germane_Riposte,6,Thu Jul 9 21:06:25 2015 UTC,It's because the two clubs aren't tied together at all. The Sounders (mens) are actually linked to the W-League's Women's Sounders: http://www.sounderswomen.com/  This was a terrible decision (imo) since you can see how well it's working out for other teams that did do a partnership for the NSWL (like portland and houston).
SoundersFC,3cphmj,antifreze,5,Thu Jul 9 19:51:08 2015 UTC,It isn't like the sounders women were created after the NWSL was started. That team is a year or two older than the Reign
SoundersFC,3cphmj,IInviteYouToTheParty,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:09:41 2015 UTC,That's my point though. They should have moved the sounders women into the NWSL rather than create a whole new team. I feel like the Reign would be a lot more successful (attendance/popularity wise) than they already are.
SoundersFC,3cphmj,antifreze,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:31:56 2015 UTC,"Different ownership, as far as I know the Sounders were not interested enough at the time"
SoundersFC,3cphmj,jlark21,2,Thu Jul 9 20:33:24 2015 UTC,"Right, I think it was a mistake either way. A partnership between an NWSL and MLS is showing that it is worth it. However, the Sounders and Reign are past that point since the Sounders still have the Sounder's Women so I don't see any kind of double-header happening anymore."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,antifreze,5,Thu Jul 9 20:39:10 2015 UTC,The Sounders men aren't linked to the women. They're just letting them use the logo and name. This is why the womens team still uses the previous kits.
SoundersFC,3cphmj,ProdigalReality,1 point,Thu Jul 9 23:05:12 2015 UTC,"Oh, I was under the assumption that they were part of the same organization. Not just the name and logo. Maybe it is possible then."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,antifreze,1 point,Fri Jul 10 00:48:17 2015 UTC,"They're not. I want to say the womens team is owned by the old Tacoma Tide group. They merged the groups, and asked the use the new logo when all the WNT players came here for 1 year."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,ProdigalReality,5,Fri Jul 10 07:22:43 2015 UTC,"I would imagine the logistics of getting fans to Seattle Center plays a huge role, unless we were to have the Reign play in Century Link or the Sounders play at Memorial.   The second option is definitely not possible, but I wouldn't be surprised to see the first sometime. Now would be about the time though, right off of the WWC hype."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,joylongdivision,5,Thu Jul 9 19:10:46 2015 UTC,"Apart from the other issues of intermixing leagues mentioned above, I don't think it would be a huge issue. It would take work of course but nothing overwhelming. Reign would play the opener in the afternoon followed by Sounders in the evening. The easiest way would be to play two friendlies that are not part of either regular schedule. Then you can take all season ticket seating issues out of the way and just sell special double-header tickets good for both games."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,seariously,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:27:41 2015 UTC,If I remember right NWSL chose the Reign ownership over the Sounders group for the franchise.  But I'd love to see a double-header.
SoundersFC,3cphmj,yahakum,1 point,Thu Jul 9 20:36:07 2015 UTC,"I would totally spend the $ to have a day full of football like that. If you're traveling by ferry the Clink is too easy to get to, where Memorial is a little more of a trip. It'd be amazing to see them in one place, and I'd support Reign more often."
SoundersFC,3cphmj,KickenTentacles,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:21:32 2015 UTC,"I seem to remember there was talk about it last year and the sounders where interested, I think it came down to the logistics couldn't work and disagreement about how to spilt the $$$"
SoundersFC,3cphmj,AlienMutantRobotDog,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:41:18 2015 UTC,"When the Reign were hosting the NWSL Final last season, they were unable to host the game at Memorial because of Bumbershoot. That left them with two options: play it at Starfire or do a double header at CenturyLink with the Sounders. The Sounders were willing to do the doubleheader, but the game time wouldn't have worked for ESPN, which was televising the match. The owner of the Reign even went as far as appealing to US Soccer president Sunil Gulati to allow the doubleheader.   I'd love to see a Reign-Sounders doubleheader at CenturyLink, but I worry that the stadium is just too big for the Reign right now for a regular season match. There's also the issue of how much of the revenue the Reign would get to keep in a match at CenturyLink vs. a match at Memorial. I still think a doubleheader is the best option if Memorial isn't available at any point during the playoffs. Starfire is an awful fit for the style the Reign play with."
SoundersFC,3crt0f,MowwMoww,2,Fri Jul 10 06:46:30 2015 UTC,"He really doesn't seem excited to be here in my opinion. Even dropping that ""he's looking forward to the next 6 months.""

SoundersFC,3crt0f,JustinCasy,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:47:28 2015 UTC,"Sigi seems to think highly of him ( and Lyon), but honestly, if his contract runs its course and he moves on I won't be to upset about it. 6 months seems like a pretty short contract though."

SoundersFC,3cq4os,gblfxt,2,Sat Jul 11 01:58:00 2015 UTC,"As far as anyone knows we're going to hold off until next season. I think we desperately need a big time signing this window if we're to win any trophies this year, but Garth made it clear that they're in no rush. That being said, a GM is never going to say something like, ""Yeah, we're looking at signing a big time star right now."""
SoundersFC,3cq4os,MowwMoww,1 point,Fri Jul 10 03:38:11 2015 UTC,Particularly when the roster is full. Any move the team makes from this point on would require moving at least one player. You don't want anyone on the team to feel unsettled if there isn't an imminent move.   I took Garth's comments as an attempt to reassure the players currently with the team. I took Sigi's comments as something that could possibly happen but hasn't even gotten to the point of negotiations. I can see why Garth wouldn't want to bring it up so early in the process.

SoundersFC,3cq4os,dumbyankee,1 point,Fri Jul 10 08:25:41 2015 UTC,Why not? With their reputation and money they could bring in a big signing (which means a quality player) and get a shot in the arm and push themselves head and shoulders above the competition.   Right now we are treading water at the top of the western conference.
SoundersFC,3cq4os,randymeeker,2,Fri Jul 10 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"Any team that has missed all 3 of its DP's for a significant stretch of games would be treading water. We haven't had all 3 of our DP's in a match since the end of May, when we were sitting at the top of the Supporters Shield table with 2 points per match, with the next best team at 1.79 points per match. The Sounders are probably the best team in the league when Oba, Dempsey, and Alonso are healthy.   The next 3 games are against the 3 worst teams in the league with Alonso back in the lineup, and Dempsey and Martins should both be back in time for the game against Vancouver at the beginning of August. If we're still at or near the top of the standings at that point (which we should be), we have a damn good chance at winning some trophies, even without a new DP.   Don't get me wrong though. I'd love to have another player with the kind of quality our current DP's have, even if it means trading a player like Rose, who I really like."
SoundersFC,3cq4os,Audicity,1 point,Fri Jul 10 15:32:50 2015 UTC,"So from what I can tell, someone from Europe, possibly we know they're German (based on the comments I read from the article).  I'm curious who we would be able to sign over to us."

SoundersFC,3cmzq5,MowwMoww,13,Thu Jul 9 06:54:35 2015 UTC,"Did they piss you of somehow? I'd say it's almost exactly opposite. They have a lot of original content and a passionate and large following. Anyway, to each his own."

That's what mostly wins on the internet. Been that way for a while. What's your biggest source of news?"
SoundersFC,3cmzq5,mastermoebius,5,Thu Jul 9 07:36:45 2015 UTC,"My biggest source of news is that same as everyone else. Pentz and Ruiz are the only people actually covering the Sounders on a daily basis. I really dislike S@H because, up until recently, it was just all content from Clark and Oshan rehosting Pentz and Ruiz' content. Yes, they gave credit, but people acted like S@H was a source for news and it's just fluff and an aggregation of beat writers. The way Clark carries himself on twitter pisses me off as well.  I also hate the format of the entire SB nation family. It's designed like it was made by a template from 10 years ago. The comment section is really poorly formatted as well.  I see the value in S@H. It's essentially just like reddit except with a bigger community than here. What I dislike is that people think it is a news source. It isn't.   edit: I don't people to think I hate S@H. It's a good community and if you want a link aggregation place then that's a good place to find stuff. I haven't looked at the game threads but they're probably good too. You also have guys like Likkit who make funny content and others that make other good stuff. I'm just saying that up until pretty recently it was just a dumping ground for Oshan and Clark to rehost tweets. It's a blog imo, not a news source. Just like you wouldn't call reddit a news source, you wouldn't call S@H a news source.   I encourage people to use it. It's the team's #1 fan site. I'm just saying that I don't like some aspects about it.  If you want news from the source, go get a twitter account and follow Matt Pentz and Don Ruiz."
SoundersFC,3cmzq5,MowwMoww,1 point,Thu Jul 9 07:46:16 2015 UTC,"Clark annoys the fuck outta me. I like the podcast, but Pentz and Ruiz are better sources for hard news. S@H is more fan based, and good for the more speculative aspects."
SoundersFC,3cmzq5,MightyAreTheMen,1 point,Thu Jul 9 12:37:45 2015 UTC,Thank you for posting this. I wish more people took notice instead of treating these guys like experts on the game and the team. Clark has a huge ego. The only one I actually like is Oshan because he can laugh at himself and mostly treats others with respect.
SoundersFC,3cmzq5,thegraduate,5,Thu Jul 9 14:21:47 2015 UTC,I recommend you watch this film. I saw it opening night downtown. It will teach you a ton about our team and what we are about.

SoundersFC,3cmzq5,Aurick,4,Thu Jul 9 07:30:38 2015 UTC,"The absolute very best media that you can consume to get to where you want to go is to read this book.   Sounder at Heart is a great blog and has all sorts of great info as you continue to follow the Sounders, and Levy Film's ""American Football"" can be a fun watch, but I don't think either of them will get you into the heart of the Sounders as much as by reading Authentic Masterpiece.   It will bring a ton of clarity and insight into everything you read and watch about the Sounders afterwards. Highly recommended!"

SoundersFC,3cmzq5,JustinCasy,2,Thu Jul 9 06:41:24 2015 UTC,"Welcome! After stalking your posts a little, I see your a SJ Sharks fan too. That was my primary passion before moving to Seattle and finding the Sounders in 2010. We should grab a beer and chat sometime.  I definitely agree, Sounder@Heart is one of your best sources of news and content for the Sounders. Make sure to check out the Seattle Times beat writer Matt Pentz as well.  I would also recommend /r/MLS. Obviously there's a big focus on the league as a whole, but plenty of relevant info daily.   For tactics, ownership, manager, etc: 2014 Countdown to Kickoff. Be aware that it's 1.5 years out-of-date, so some player changes have happened. But a lot of it is still relevant today, and it's a well written collection of info.  As for watching: if you have some sort of pay television (cable, satellite, etc) then you should be good to go. Any games that aren't aired locally will be on ESPN(1/2) or FoxSports(1/2). If not, an HDTV antenna is your best friend. Other than nationally broadcast games, all are broadcast in HD over the air."

Being in downtown Seattle gives you plenty of bars within walking distance to that will be playing the game. Temple billiards and Fuel are both  supporters bars who will have the game on.

SoundersFC,3cki4p,SvanirePerish,6,Wed Jul 8 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"TL;DR: Each team get's an additional $500k in ""special"" allocation funds, that can only be used for two things: 1) Buy down current DP's to below DP level, but as a requirement, the club must immediately sign a new DP at above the old DP's price. 2) Use this money to sign players above the current DP threshold for a lower price. | These Garber bucks, unlike ordinary Garber bucks, may only be used on above DP priced players. You couldn't use them to lower Pappa's salary like normal allocation funds."

Now, to take the ferry cost a nickel, and in those days, nickels had pictures of bumblebees on 'em. Give me five bees for a quarter, you'd say.  Now where were we? Oh yeah: the important thing was I had an onion on my belt, which was the style at the time. They didn't have white onions because of the war.

SoundersFC,3cki4p,littlenicky174,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:08:22 2015 UTC,"Hmmm I wonder if we are going to use this on Ozzy anytime soon. As I understand it as per the article we would have to sign a new DP if we were to do this: ""If Targeted Allocation Money is used to free up a Designated Player slot, the club must simultaneously sign a new Designated Player at an investment equal to or greater than the player he is replacing."" That would be rather interesting move... I know Garth didn't really tip his hat either way, and seemed rather patient in his approach to the new rule.  Where would we even need a DP. Attacking Mid / winger? I know people don't like spending it on defense and with Brad and Marshal back their we don't have too many worries, and we already have 2 DP's up top."
SoundersFC,3cki4p,vershastri,4,Wed Jul 8 17:24:32 2015 UTC,"Well, getting a more defensive DP wouldn't be a bad thing. There's a stat floating around that Frei has the most saves this season. This is true, but keep in mind that means we're giving up the most shots out of any team in the league. If we signed a box to box mid who could help clean up on the defensive side and then join the attack (Khedira for example), I'd say we'd be using this new rule exceptionally."
SoundersFC,3cki4p,cantbeassed,1 point,Wed Jul 8 17:45:16 2015 UTC,"This is true, but keep in mind that means we're giving up the most shots out of any team in the league.

SoundersFC,3cki4p,samfreez,2,Wed Jul 8 22:28:10 2015 UTC,"It also doesn't hurt that Frei can Flei.

SoundersFC,3cki4p,vershastri,0,Wed Jul 8 23:27:55 2015 UTC,Is there a stat that says they've been easy shots? No. You can't prove that in any way unless you show me every shot taken against us. And recently we've been conceding a lot more than we should. Something's gotta change in the back.
SoundersFC,3cki4p,itypedvorak,2,Wed Jul 8 22:55:23 2015 UTC,"There was an interesting blog detailing shots in the league early in the year where shots were taken from by shooting zone (data is now a month out of date): http://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/3/7/5481326/mls-advanced-statistics  1 month ago we had allowed the most total shots, and the fewest in/around the box by a significant margin. Things have changed for us since then, but I wouldn't be shocked if the types of shots we are allowing haven't changed too much."
SoundersFC,3cki4p,cantbeassed,2,Thu Jul 9 00:50:05 2015 UTC,"Is there a stat that says they've been easy shots? No. You can't prove that in any way unless you show me every shot taken against us.   Sure I can. Did the shot go in? No? Then it was a save. (not that I'm saying any GK could have saved it, but shots from 30 yards out, are inherently easier to catch than shots from 5 yards out).  We had the best defense in the league up until about 3 weeks ago, what the fuck are you talking about? Evans is out with the Gold Cup, and we had a number of mid week games that tired out the normal back line. The defense is fine."
SoundersFC,3cki4p,vershastri,2,Wed Jul 8 23:01:00 2015 UTC,"All I'm saying is our defense is not where it should be come playoffs. The other teams will step up, and sooner or later those shots will become harder and harder to save. As we've learned from past years, the Sounders have not been able to step up during the playoffs. I'd say improve while there's still time."
SoundersFC,3cki4p,vershastri,0,Wed Jul 8 23:35:59 2015 UTC,"You still haven't proven to me that they were easy. Just because a shot doesn't go in doesn't mean it was an easy shot, or even a save (a save is when the GOALIE blocks the ball, if the opponent skies a shot that's not counted as a save lol)"
SoundersFC,3cki4p,Sounders_Till_I_Die,3,Wed Jul 8 23:33:52 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's an interesting question. With Friberg and Ozzie in the midfield, we will have two really good midfielders, not to mention Roldan, Thomas, Pappa and Neagle. So it's really crammed, and Garth said we're not likely to sign another midfielder after announcing Friberg. We have two DP's up top, so I think it really only leaves the back line if you ask me. Brad is better as a fullback, which leaves a central position next to Chad open. I think it's our likely choice."

SoundersFC,3cki4p,vershastri,2,Wed Jul 8 17:38:17 2015 UTC,"I know people don't like spending it on defense and with Brad and Marshal back their we don't have too many worries   I don't have the faintest clue where you are getting the bit about ""don't have too many worries"". The back line on this team is thin and it's been a major issue. I think stability off the back is this teams most pressing major issue, and it has been for several years (the reason we brought in Marshall in the first place, and then later converted Evans to CB).   Apart from the horrid start of this season by Evans (he personally cost us at least 6 points in the first month of the season), they've been a solid unit and everything seems fine when everyone is healthy, but it feels like a house of cards. the quality drops off FAST if a couple pieces pick up an injury, gets a suspension, or gets called off for national team duties, and it turns into Swiss cheese.    It's a long season and every team struggles with injuries, it is usually the teams who finish healthy who do well in the playoffs. We can't afford to just keep fingers crossed and have your entire season dependent on Marshall being fit.  Personally I think the best thing this team could do would be to sign a high caliber CB which would free up Evans to be the ultimate utility man who can cover all MF and back line positions as needed. Or maybe a strong defender who is versatile enough to pay LB and CB."
SoundersFC,3cki4p,littlenicky174,2,Thu Jul 9 01:17:29 2015 UTC,This. I've seen too many fans fall under the impression that our defense is just fine. We need to step up in the back if we want to go far in the playoffs.
SoundersFC,3cki4p,night_owl,1 point,Thu Jul 9 03:03:36 2015 UTC,"Good point. I primarily meant our starters at the back are okay (Evans has had his slips but he has really progressed). Not many defenders in the league command a DP salary however and I thought our defense was something we may be able to bolster without bringing in a defensive DP. Although I am not completely adverse to the idea if it is the right defender. I do think we have depth problems at the back, particularly if Scott retires at the end of the season. So yeah, I definitely see your point."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,knightlock15,6,Wed Jul 8 14:15:56 2015 UTC,"With our ownership group and the Seahawks ownership group, anything is financially possible."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,kingofspain131,6,Wed Jul 8 14:38:24 2015 UTC,The only way it could be done is if the entire north end of the stadium was demolished and re-designed so the grass could be pulled out into the parking lot like University of Phoenix's field.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,enigmamr,2,Wed Jul 8 16:26:00 2015 UTC,"I actually think doing this on the South end makes more sense. The grass could roll under the Events Center where there would be a special indoor space with massive arrays of grow lights.  If you're going to redo a whole end of the stadium, I think that would be less of an impact, as I suspect in the next decade or so that all the parking on the northside will be turned into new buildings.  Either way, this is all make believe.  The only real solution I could see working is that grass gets laid down in January after the Seahawks finish and then is replaced by field turf in September as NFL gets started again. The two teams only share the stadium for 2-4 months, depending on how far the Sounders go in the playoffs."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,doublemazaa,9,Wed Jul 8 18:29:47 2015 UTC,"You pretty much have to build the stadium for it. RBP has seating, concourses, etc. all around the field. There would be no place for the field to retract through. Plus the area around the stadium is pretty developed so there would be no place for it to go without knocking down some existing buildings.   University of Phoenix Stadium is a good existing example of that kind of stadium, though they just roll the grass in and out and don't use turf as well."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,SeattleBattles,2,Wed Jul 8 15:04:04 2015 UTC,"Could you redesign the pitch to have like rotating panels with grass or turf on them? or would that just be too ridiculous. I mean, it seems like you could conceivably go downwards with grass/turf on like a ferris-wheel esque device."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,alexfrancisburchard,8,Wed Jul 8 15:59:33 2015 UTC,"It'd work for the turf, but turning grass upside down tends to make a mess..."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,SeattleBattles,2,Wed Jul 8 16:21:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that's why I said, like a ferris wheel, you'd keep it upside right somehow, I'm sure there's ways. Then you could have lights on the bottom of the turf that help keep the grass alive."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,alexfrancisburchard,3,Wed Jul 8 16:23:19 2015 UTC,Ah!   I think you'd still have problems though with the drainage and other systems that run under the field. Assuming the logistics of getting things to line up and work were overcome.   It'd be damn expensive that's for sure.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,SeattleBattles,2,Wed Jul 8 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but damn wouldn't it be cool? Then we would get grass, and we wouldn't have to keep hearing people bitch about it during all of our games!"

SoundersFC,3cjwv1,alexfrancisburchard,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:32:45 2015 UTC,"I think the biggest issue with doing grass/turf in Seattle is that unless you move the grass as large pieces, its really not going to be set properly.  Which is what we experience the few times they put in a grass field.  I just don't know how you would store the grass in a large enough fashion for it to be healthy."

SoundersFC,3cjwv1,nikdahl,2,Wed Jul 8 18:56:06 2015 UTC,I thought that new building was a lot closer.   One hurdle down!
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,SeattleBattles,1 point,Thu Jul 9 01:01:18 2015 UTC,They would have to cut through load bearing columns and re-engineer the stands to allow for a ~75 yard unobstructed span. Plus there's the huge stairway over in that area which they would lose. And you'd lose the end zone suites.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,seariously,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:38:18 2015 UTC,"Yes, you would have to tear down everything between the two north jumbo screens. It would be a major reconstruction. But having been underneath that area a few times, I do not believe that they would need to tear down the NE stairs, or any of the west/east concourses or stands, and they could most definitely rebuild the end zone suites. Those things could use a remodel anyways, and I'm sure the Seahawks would love to add more suites, given the chance (as that revenue is not shared with the rest of the league)  Overall, I believe the endeavor would be MUCH less expensive, and have a much better overall result, if it were undertaken as opposed to building a new SSS. Which is going to be the only other long term solution for the Sounders. They cannot grow into a world class club while playing on turf."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,nikdahl,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:48:51 2015 UTC,I think there would be a better chance of them putting in hybrid turf instead.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,seariously,2,Wed Jul 8 20:58:37 2015 UTC,There is really no reason to think that a Hybrid turf would work. It does not make turf indestructible. It already is in a couple of NFL stadiums and does not keep the grass pristine. Add an MLS team and it will more than likely fail just like any other grass.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,Fritzed,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:12:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think that hybrid turf would be an acceptable solution to the Seahawks. The two clubs want fundamentally different things out of their playing surfaces, I don't think there is a happy medium to be found."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,nikdahl,6,Wed Jul 8 21:02:27 2015 UTC,I think the stadium needs to be designed to do this. CenturyLink is not.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,steerbell,2,Wed Jul 8 14:42:51 2015 UTC,"We could possibly put in a hybrid field if the Seahawks wanted it.  It's three times the price of FieldTurf.   Both Green Bay and Arsenal have the same hybrid field so we know it works for both sports at the highest level quite well.  The questions are:   Can it hold it's normal lifespan with two teams using it?  If not, is it cost effective to put it in anyhow?  Do the Seahawks want it?  Why not?  Can we keep the real grass growing with grow lights like they do at the Emirates to get around the issue of shadows of CenturyLink?  Can we install it in the stadium fast enough without being interrupted by normally scheduled events?"

SoundersFC,3cjwv1,itypedvorak,2,Wed Jul 8 15:17:40 2015 UTC,Might be theoretically possible somehow but far from practical. You'd be better off putting in new grass every time you needed it like they've done in the past in CenturyLink. I couldn't find video of them doing on the home pitch but here's an example of it being done in Vancouver: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EAKPoGjUqBI  I also recall a field being installed indoors being pieced together by square palettes of grass but I don't remember if it was real or artificial turf.

But, ya know, the idea of an actual soccer specific stadium isn't too crazy. Yes, SSFC us signed at centurylink for the foreseeable future, but there are outs in that contract.  Seattle is making money hand over fist not just in attendance and jersey revenues, but also by way of their low rents/lack of a stadium to pay off. It's speculative, but I don't think its a stretch to say that ssfc is probably the wealthiest team in the league and the most liquid.   All of this is to say, if Chris Hansen doesn't get his Sonics, there is now a chunk of land in the stadium district with an EIS that is shovel-ready and a demonstrated fan base."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,MightyAreTheMen,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:07:06 2015 UTC,"I would like to see a solid platform that could be added to the field, on top of the grass.  Something that's completely solid, but anchored outside of the soccer field lines themselves, so as not to cause problems with divots.  If it were, say, 5"" thick, with a further 3-ish inches of clear space below that, with LED lights (charged by solar panels on the roof of CLink?) underneath to keep the grass alive and well, the Seahawks would have their turf, and we'd have our grass.  I don't know how well turf can be patched together (assuming it's probably not that hard?) but if there were multiple panels like that that could lock together rigidly, I think it could work..  It would probably require some expensive materials though."
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,samfreez,2,Wed Jul 8 23:19:39 2015 UTC,Turf can certainly patched. The Vikings and Twins dealt with seams at the Metrodome to fit both sports configurations.
SoundersFC,3cjwv1,francostine,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:18:17 2015 UTC,"Not hard, if you specifically build the stadium for it. Take the stadium in Arizona, they have grass they grow outside, then retract that back in the stadium."

SoundersFC,3cfjny,Genghis_John,5,Tue Jul 7 15:31:47 2015 UTC,We can absolutely attract big name players - we just have no room for more DP's and we're not looking to add any at this time.  Don't forget - we were the first MLS team to go into a top European league and poach a player who was still a key starter for that team (Obafemi Martins for Levante).  Don't let this wave of big-name players coming to MLS get you down.  We've just gone through a rough patch of games with all 3 of our DP's out and other teams are making waves with shiny new players.  Stack our lineup with all 3 DP's against any other team's lineup - even with new signings - and I like our chances very much.
SoundersFC,3cfjny,CascadianAtHeart,3,Tue Jul 7 15:17:36 2015 UTC,"With the new Core Player rule, we can buy down Alonso's contract with allocation money and open a 3rd DP slot, as far as I understand the rule."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,sp_the_ghost,2,Tue Jul 7 16:56:07 2015 UTC,"Probably, but Garth already said in the ExtraTime podcast (the same episode where he hinted at our two recent signings) that they aren't in a rush to sign a new DP if a new mechanism came down. It isn't ""use it or lose it"" so at the earliest we may see something in the off-season if even then."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,Aurick,3,Tue Jul 7 17:29:29 2015 UTC,"I feel like most mid season pickups dont do a lot for teams. Look at Clint... Remember the www.hasclintdempseyscoredagoalyet.com site that was set up?   You can't just drop big name players into a team that has been practicing and playing together for 5/6 months+ and expect them to click.   Honestly, I think Mears is one of those faux-DPs. He plays at the level of a DP, just with out the pay/recognition/hype that Gerrard/Kaka/Beckahm bring.   Going back to last season when the FO cleaned house (EJ for example), we picked up a lot of talented players who were ""cheap"" with level heads, and good attitudes in the locker room (Pineda, Cooper, etc)  I think the maturity of this team is what draws me in. I don't need a new EPL player to be excited about a match."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,BugSTi,3,Tue Jul 7 18:03:17 2015 UTC,"The counterpoint would be that midseason is the only time to sign many players or arrange tansfers, as it is the offseason for other leagues. The MLS offseason would be better in theory but the market is worse at that time."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,burkinaeye,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:34:16 2015 UTC,"Yes, the market from which the player comes from plays a large part, but I think coming straight off a EPL season into MLS mid season leaves players likely to get burned out.   I'd rather we sign them, and let them get settled instead of putting them in a match, before their belongings even show up in their new city."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,BugSTi,2,Tue Jul 7 19:52:22 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't expect him to tip his hand if they were after another DP, so we'll have to wait and see."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,sp_the_ghost,3,Tue Jul 7 17:54:49 2015 UTC,"Really? Our 3 DPs are quite possibly the best at their respective positions in MLS and we are incapable of signing that level of player (the same level of player you refer to on each of the other teams you list) due to MLS rules regarding DPs unless we get rid of one of those guys. The signing of Tyrone Mears to replace Yedlin has turned out far better than anyone could have hoped. Thomas is young and shows a lot of potential and I suspect in a year we'll be singing his praises, as well. Friberg is coming back (not sure if you were a fan when he was around a few years back but he's a very solid player and I don't think a single person would call his signing anything other than SOLID) and I'll go ahead and just omit all the homegrown/academy players like Darwin Jones, et al as they're not the ""signings"" you're likely referring to. You go back a year or 2 and you throw MLS Defender of the Year Marshall into the mix, Marco Pappa who is playing the best soccer of his career, Pineda (who while not incredible has been in the starting XI since he got here and for good reason) and Barrett has played very well since being signed.  So, really, I have no clue what you are talking about."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,theREALbmills,3,Tue Jul 7 15:40:38 2015 UTC,It would be super super easy to pay down Alonso using allocation money to free up a DP slot. Just saying.
SoundersFC,3cfjny,nikdahl,3,Tue Jul 7 17:04:56 2015 UTC,"One thing people forget is that we bought Martins at age 28 the only difference is we didn't get him from a tip-top club like Giovinco however realistically he was just as good of if not more so of a signing as Dos-Santos would be.   Getting Friburg as a sub-DP is great, remember Portland had to shell out ""low end"" DP money to get Adi from the Danish leagues and Mears is of similar pedigree to Ridgewell.   I think we are big enough of a location to bring in the low end DP's for sub-DP money, and our big signings will come in time. I would imagine the Garth is looking at potential acquisitions however he is going to keep quiet until a move is ready."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,Jack2142,2,Wed Jul 8 03:46:58 2015 UTC,"I think you're ignoring the fact that we have had all three of our DP slots used for the last year and a half or so. Now that we can bump Alonso to Core Player status we should be able to attract another big signing. Also, LA didn't attract Zardes and Gonzalez, they worked their way into the squad."

SoundersFC,3cfjny,cantbeassed,2,Tue Jul 7 17:24:08 2015 UTC,And this is a problem to me. Our window is not getting bigger. Next season our 3 DPs will all be on the wrong side of 30. The time to go for it is now. Especially with LA becoming much better.
SoundersFC,3cfjny,PeteyNice,0,Tue Jul 7 18:41:37 2015 UTC,"You're assuming that the july transfers will make LA some crazy amazing super team, when it likely won't. Likewise, adding a new DP to our team now offsets the whole thing, and we have to rebuild around the new player, it's why Dempsey was pretty mediocre his first summer here."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,cantbeassed,2,Tue Jul 7 19:02:22 2015 UTC,LA is already a very good team. Adding Gerrard and Dos Santos will certainly make them better. Especially by the time the playoffs roll around and they have had a chance to get used to playing together.  The 2013 Sounders were pretty mediocre all around.    Why would we have to build around whoever we bring in? It doesn't seem like a stretch to bring in someone who fills our needs - i.e. a winger - and can fit into the team as it is.
SoundersFC,3cfjny,PeteyNice,0,Tue Jul 7 19:21:50 2015 UTC,"Why would we have to build around whoever we bring in? It doesn't seem like a stretch to bring in someone who fills our needs - i.e. a winger - and can fit into the team as it is.    Because it changes the dynamic of the team. Where do we then put Pappa or Neagle? What about Friberg? Assuming Pappa stays on the left, you now have about 4 starting MF players (Alonso, Pineda, Friberg, Neagle) for 2 spots.   If you don't build around your DPs what's the point of having them? We sure as hell built a team around Obadempsy."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,cantbeassed,3,Tue Jul 7 19:26:07 2015 UTC,"You put Neagle on the bench where he belongs. Pineda can join him there. I'd get tacos with Friberg any day but I see him as a reserve player.  You absolutely build your team around your DPs. The point I am making is that we can bring in someone who will complement Hydra and not change the way the team plays to ""build around"" this hypothetical new signing."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,PeteyNice,0,Tue Jul 7 19:37:30 2015 UTC,"I'd get tacos with Friberg any day but I see him as a reserve player.   So you bench someone we just signed as a starter. Got it. I'm gonna trust Legerway and Sigi on this one actually.    The point I am making is that we can bring in someone who will complement Hydra and not change the way the team plays to ""build around"" this hypothetical new signing.    Nay, you can't bring in someone of DP caliber in an attacking position without changing up the team, inherently they'll require time to get to know the team and how they play, etc etc.   It's literally why they signed Friberg over some other MF player, watch the interview where Garth says as much."
SoundersFC,3cfjny,cantbeassed,0,Tue Jul 7 19:42:04 2015 UTC,"We signed Friberg because he was available and we did not have the ability to sign someone better. He didn't exactly dominate in Denmark. My expectations are very much tempered, but you can never have enough depth.  Getting to know the team and how they play is part of any new addition. It does not mean that you change the way the team plays because of it."

The fact is that we are consistently leading the charts and will continue to be somewhere near the top of the western conference, if not THE top once the Gold Cup is over.  I think we are seeing a shift where big market teams can now afford to just straight up outspend teams. Salaries have exploded with all of the big signings as of late.  If we were Chicago or Colorado (or Portland), I'd be worried, but fact is that the Sounders are in a very good long term position.  We have huge amounts of fans, lots of great quality players, lots of younger talent, one of the best USL teams, and ability to homegrow talent.  The last thing the Sounders are is lacking, I am sure Lagerway and everyone are planning big stuff for the next few seasons."

SoundersFC,3cb8o0,alexfrancisburchard,2,Mon Jul 6 18:22:48 2015 UTC,"Sure, but there is a large gulf in the top end of prices too that is much larger than on the lower end."

If absolute value who cares, if its the same percentage different as low end tickets, again, really we need like 51% of seahawks prices to beat them in income.   Actually, NFL has 8 home games, versus 17 for MLS, so we'd need ticket prices to be like 54% of the Seahawks to make more money."

I will venture a guess that a tickets in 209 will not be half that much on a per-game basis in my lifetime, and I'm 28 years old. The gulf is very large."

SoundersFC,3cb8o0,ezrawork,1 point,Mon Jul 6 23:45:33 2015 UTC,"tl;dr  The price of the tickets is just a part of the money to be made, and most likely a smaller portion than that made by selling over-priced concessions, of which the NFL crowd is more likely to consume more of.  Any of these discussions about US versus THEM and the ticket prices and # of games and such typically leave out one very important factor, if not THE most important factor: concessions. Stadiums are foaming at the mouth to sell you $12 Bud Light's they paid $1 for or Ivar's fish baskets with obscene mark-ups and couldn't care less about how much your ticket costs because you only buy one ticket but there's no limit to the amount of high-margin concessions they can sell you, they just need to get you in the door. And this may be a bit of stereotyping, but I'm guessing the Seahawks crowd consumes far more concessions than the SSFC crowd which is helped by their non-continuous gameplay and several opportunities to get up and grab concessions during the game, nevermind that NFL fans seem to be more of the beer drinking and nacho eating crowd...so if you made the ticket prices or # of seats sold identical (adjusted for attendance discrepancies due to utilizing far fewer seats in the typical soccer configuration), Seahawks still win since their fans are likely to buy more in concessions and make the CLink folks more money and if SSFC were to sell more concessions they'd have more pull and become ""primary"" tenant since they're bringing in more money.  Of course there's the whole Paul Allen and First & Goal Inc. thing operating CLink which renders this particular discussion moot, but the original point about concessions is still valid without that conflict of interest."
SoundersFC,3cb8o0,theREALbmills,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:32:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah, they'll always beat us in concessions. Their game lasts for 3 hours, where our matches are around 2. Plus people really stop buying stuff after the half.  Still, I spend more money in the Clink than I ever did at Stubhub. Stubhub's lines for commodities was/are atrocious. It's too easy to walk up with no line at the Clink and hand over my cash."

SoundersFC,3cb8o0,doublemazaa,-5,Wed Jul 8 05:48:04 2015 UTC,Not more injuries just different types. It is clearly not preferred by some of the best (Henry refused to play on it). I've only heard one quote from Sigi alluding to the Seahawks preferring the play on FieldTurf but it is easy to assume it was originally installed for the cost savings. Why they continued to use it after at least one botched install is beyond me (likely a really good salesman who is buddies with someone). I think a hybrid is pretty realistic when they replace the current surface.
SoundersFC,3cb8o0,yummyorangejuice,5,Mon Jul 6 16:56:23 2015 UTC,"It is clearly not preferred by some of the best   It is not preferred by old guys that don't have ot play if they don't want to. Any coach worth their salt would have made him play, but he was too scared of standing up to Henry. He didn't play because he didn't want to, not because the turf is bad for his health.    easy to assume it was originally installed for the cost savings.    Definitely not. Are you forgetting who our owner is?   Why they continued to use it after at least one botched install is beyond me   It's not a botched install, it's just old turf.    I think a hybrid is pretty realistic when they replace the current surface.    Except it's not. Football thrives on turf. It's faster and allows for more athletic players to move faster and more precisely. That is why it exists in football. The Seahawks will never switch to grass because it would only hinder them."

SoundersFC,3cb8o0,atheocrat,2,Mon Jul 6 21:49:53 2015 UTC,"Players have several complaints about it. Many players believe that it causes more injuries than normal grass, and they also complain that it wears down your body faster. Clint Dempsey complained last year that playing on turf so much was exhausting him and reducing his performance during periods when we had frequent matches. Thierry Henry also would not play on turf, unfortunately.   We all have our own opinions on it, of course. My personal experience has been that turf causes more superficial injury (turf burn sucks!), but nothing more than that."

When the USMNT played at the Clink for the WC2014 qualifiers, the turf was terrible because of the same conditions, and quite frankly, I'm surprised no one was injured because of it.  If the club is going to spend the money to get natural turf installed, they should do it the right way to reduce the chance of injury as well as to make it look like it belongs. I'm sure you've seen the comments in /r/mls and /r/soccer about the state of the FieldTurf - imagine if we brought in natural grass, but saw the lines where they butted up the rolls of sod against each other?"
SoundersFC,3cb8o0,PeteyNice,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:19:39 2015 UTC,I am not saying to roll in grass. I am saying that there are different levels/types of artificial surfaces. Some that are compressed and fast that football like and some that are not like that and better for soccer.
SoundersFC,3cb8o0,mikester01,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:29:55 2015 UTC,"If you're talking about a different type of artificial turf, that horse has gone on to meet its maker with how often it's brought up, including here:  http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2015/03/18/seattle-sounders-value-home-field-advantage-new-turf-room-growth-centurylink"
SoundersFC,3cb8o0,PeteyNice,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:19:17 2015 UTC,I don't see what I am suggesting being brought up in that article. I am saying that we get two different types of artificial turf.   Type A - For the Seahawks Type B - For the Sounders   The Seahawks never play on the Sounders turf and vv. The Seahawks could then choose never to replace their turf so it can be beat up and horrible. While the Sounders can choose to replace theirs as often as they can afford.

SoundersFC,3c8x27,theanimusgames,8,Mon Jul 6 00:46:43 2015 UTC,"Since all the Sounders games are broadcast locally here in Seattle, they do not allow us to watch the games through MLS Live.  Pull the trigger, totally worth it for your situation."

SoundersFC,3c8x27,scubadger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 01:31:44 2015 UTC,Can this be bypassed somehow? Like saying you live somewhere else or using a VPN? How is you location linked?
SoundersFC,3c8x27,ravegreener,1 point,Mon Jul 6 04:21:32 2015 UTC,The MLS live app on kodi doesn't even do any geoblocking at all.   On the roku if you connect while you're on a canadian VPN you can even drop the VPN and when it auto-reconnects on your normal IP address it doesn't re-geofence.
SoundersFC,3c8x27,doublemazaa,1 point,Mon Jul 6 07:23:40 2015 UTC,How do you use a VPN on the roku? I've got it on computer but not through that.
SoundersFC,3c8x27,scubadger,1 point,Mon Jul 6 18:07:31 2015 UTC,You have to do it at your router.
SoundersFC,3c8x27,benfreilich,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:56:28 2015 UTC,"My router supports VPNs.  I think the basic ASUS firmware supports enough, but I've flashed mine with Merlin.  I can connect to the router and send all my traffic up to canada through a free VPN.  The roku and everything else will then connect through it.  The bandwidth sucks, though, but that's the point of my comment which is that as soon as you've started the stream you can drop the VPN connection on the router.  You'll re-IP back to your normal IP address with all your bandwidth, the stream will reconnect from your 'new' (non-canada) IP address, but it doesn't re-check the geofencing."
SoundersFC,3c8x27,MowwMoww,1 point,Mon Jul 13 21:24:20 2015 UTC,"hmmm I'm thinking about using an apple-tv and while I could always connect my laptop and just do airplay, I guess it wouldn't work just through the apple tv app thingy.(For black-out games that is)   Also, I ended up buying a subscription and it's pretty awesome so far!"
SoundersFC,3c8x27,benfreilich,3,Tue Jul 7 05:56:55 2015 UTC,"Yes, it is worth it. If you live in a blackout area and cannot use a VPN service then it is not worth it, but you say you're in South Carolina so the only blackouts you'll get are national TV games, which are on Friday and Sunday. Even then you can use a free VPN like zenmate to bypass those blackouts."

You'll be able to watch any regular season game from this season and the past few seasons. You can also watch the games live if you use the Hola! app for your browser and select Canada as your country, though it may not work if they're playing a Canadian team at home.

My advice is just check the match threads in /r/MLS...last match, the  YouTube streaming feed was amazing HD.  Never once did it freeze or skip around like the MLS LIVE feed does when I have been able to get it.  It's sad when a pirated feed is a thousand times better than a feed you pay for...save your money and buy some Sounders gear instead.    TL;DR   YouTube pirated feed > MLS LIVE"

SoundersFC,3c5qm5,eatsleepcoffee,5,Sun Jul 5 01:53:04 2015 UTC,"Really any seat in the 100 section is great. I wait the week of and buy a seat off the ticket exchange closest to the center of the pitch for around $30. But, I do try to sit closer to ECS than father away as that side is more livelier. People will be chanting along in section 131 and so on right along with ECS.  The 300 section seats may get cheap, and the view is not bad, but it's not as lively.   Id say if you're not sitting in the ECS section sit close to ECS in either the 100 section anywhere, or the 200 section right above or immediately next to ECS and you'll have a great time (mind, you will be standing the whole time)."
SoundersFC,3c5qm5,KickenTentacles,3,Sun Jul 5 03:48:06 2015 UTC,"And you said you're willing to splurge --we splurged yesterday and sat front row in 131 for $100 each. I sat on that side of the field because it's close to ECS, the sun is off that side in the afternoon, the Sounders players walk back and forth, and that's the net where the Sounders' goals go into the second half of the match. ;) Got to see that Mears beauty up close yesterday.  Good luck, drink some beers before the stadium, and have fun!"
SoundersFC,3c5qm5,KickenTentacles,2,Sun Jul 5 04:02:58 2015 UTC,Thanks! :)

SoundersFC,3c5qm5,Schwa142,2,Tue Jul 7 03:39:40 2015 UTC,"So if you sit outside the ECS you want to get seats on the west side of the stadium.  I feel like I have some of the best seats in the house...they're 20 rows up on the midfield...not only can you see all the action unfolding, but if it's raining you're under the drip line and when it's sunny you're in the shade...so basically if you can get anything in the 130s you'll have a good time."

SoundersFC,3c5qm5,benfreilich,2,Sun Jul 5 12:14:25 2015 UTC,"Same here.  I go with my parents who are in their 70s now and we sit in 322.  Its great to be able to watch the shape of the game.  It all depends on what you like.  If you like the energy of the people around you it probably makes more sense to get closer to ECS down in the 100 sections.  If you like seeing the game up close its also probably better to get down there.  If you like watching the formations on the field evolve (and to be under cover when it dumps rain) then the 300 seats might actually the best seats for you.  We picked our seats knowing that we wanted to sit down, be in the shade, be covered from rain, and have a good view of the field."

SoundersFC,3c2p07,MowwMoww,29,Sat Jul 4 05:04:53 2015 UTC,"Tyrone Mears - transfer of the season? There were a few awkward moments along the right side, but it had little to do with Mears. He's got an engine, an incredible touch, and a hell of a shot."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,Skuby_Duby_Du,12,Sat Jul 4 05:07:52 2015 UTC,"He's quite possibly the best right back in MLS right now, rarely ever making a mistake. Which makes it strange to think his area is also the most exploitable section in our defense, but that's due in part to how good/versatile Mears is. His crosses are a real weapon, but he doesn't have the pace to get back into position every time he makes a foray up the pitch, and our inverted wingers don't provide much help picking up the fullbacks' marks when they get caught out."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,metameh,10,Sat Jul 4 05:31:09 2015 UTC,"He's been fantastic all year, and that goal was truly a golazo."

Super bummed about Frei, hope he is ok. Mears stepped up big with that goal.   And for all who say that red wasn't deserving, you need to take a closer look.  Go Sounders!"
SoundersFC,3c2p07,stealth_sloth,7,Sat Jul 4 05:06:50 2015 UTC,"It was a red-card offense. With that said, it was a soft red. Without more contact, many refs would try to avoid influencing the match and just give a yellow. Petrescu, specifically, was letting a lot go that game, and has a prior reputation for almost never giving red cards unless they are obvious and egregious ones - he's seen fouls like that and not even given a yellow card at times in the past. Espindola can understandably feel a little hard-done by being singled out for a red on it, thinking it was inconsistent with the sort of reffing that should reasonably have been expected that match."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,alexfrancisburchard,2,Sat Jul 4 05:24:41 2015 UTC,"So my friend I went with suggested that it was for, or at least partially for persistent infringement, because he had just done some hard tackles/fouls all up and down that side of the field."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,Nekokeki,2,Sat Jul 4 06:55:09 2015 UTC,I think in this case is was more to do with intent then gauging contact.
SoundersFC,3c2p07,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:35:48 2015 UTC,"Certainly. I agree. That's why it should be a red card.  But in practice, there are plenty of refs who wouldn't give a red card in that situation. Petrescu is one of the refs I would expect to be in that group; it was a surprise that he was willing to go to the back pocket there."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,Nekokeki,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:39:56 2015 UTC,And I can also agree with that!
SoundersFC,3c2p07,stealth_sloth,19,Sat Jul 4 16:51:30 2015 UTC,Mears has been one of my favorites since he came in and I think he is quickly becoming a fan favorite. Such a professional.  Neagle did everything he could to not score today although I applaud him for creating so many chances. Finishing is lacking.
SoundersFC,3c2p07,lightjedi5,9,Sat Jul 4 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"I thought there was a serious disconnect between Neagle and Thomas. Multiple instances in which they could have set each other up but took low-percentage shots instead, or laid a good ball off but the other one wasn't making the run."

I think we are putting him up there because we have no one else, but his job should be to get the ball on the wings and get it into the box.  We need to be better about putting the ball into the top of the box where a late runner cam just come up and drive it home.  Ala the Leo Gonzales goal a few weeks back.  I love Neagle, I think he's just being misused right now.  And that's not really his fault."

SoundersFC,3c2p07,SvanirePerish,5,Mon Jul 6 20:27:52 2015 UTC,"so glad ozzie is back and looked good for the full 90......mears' shot was a thing of beauty, i'm so glad we picked him up cause he's been stellar for us.....really hope frei is ok cause he didn't look it heading into the tunnel.....here's hoping july is good month for the rave green"
SoundersFC,3c2p07,HazardSuitor,6,Sat Jul 4 05:39:05 2015 UTC,"Back in first place in the West rankings and three points behind D.C in the shield rankings, feels good, doesn't it?"
SoundersFC,3c2p07,BugSTi,2,Sat Jul 4 14:48:36 2015 UTC,It's really amazing to think that we're still that high up after a 3 game losing streak. That being said there are still a bunch of teams with many games in hand.
SoundersFC,3c2p07,HazardSuitor,4,Sat Jul 4 14:49:54 2015 UTC,"We need to find more players like Mears. European experience that doesn't take up a dp slot. I'm absolutely loving the way Tyrone is playing, and this is like icing on the cake."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,banemaler,3,Sat Jul 4 05:10:02 2015 UTC,"About damn time we get a win, but I fear this would have played very different if they weren't a man down. I really like Andy Craven, I think he should definitely be coming on before the 80th minute. We should play our full team with Andy and Barrett up top, and if Andy somehow isn't 90 fit even though he was with the USL, we can sub him off later in the game."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,Nekokeki,4,Sat Jul 4 05:12:35 2015 UTC,"Clearly tonight is a further reminder of what a fantastic pick-up Mears was for us. That strike was a thing of beauty.  Wonderful to have Ozzie in the line-up again. He looked pretty good.  Praying Frei's injury isn't serious, I don't want to rely on Perkins (though he did alright tonight.)  God damnit we can't finish with our strikers. Barrett had a solid header that was just high. Neagle had a good touch or three. But we are so reliant on the crosses into the box and yet we're so poor at connecting on them. Ugh."

SoundersFC,3c2p07,KickenTentacles,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:39:20 2015 UTC,Oh that final touch...maybe one day Barrett and Neagle will find it.  On the crosses and corners our guys seemed really static in the box.  It made it much easier for DC to defend.  One of the best things about Oba is that he never stops moving....and he can finish.
SoundersFC,3c2p07,GSShenanigans,3,Mon Jul 6 20:31:15 2015 UTC,"I'm walking out of the stadium right now,  but I told my friend I took to the game I wanted a Tyrone Mears goal at the start of the game as a joke. I'm so amazed it actually happened."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,perforce1,3,Sat Jul 4 05:13:57 2015 UTC,Where can I buy that bloody Zach Scott jersey?
SoundersFC,3c2p07,Nekokeki,2,Sat Jul 4 07:36:50 2015 UTC,"Neagle still frustrates the hell out of me...but he is what we got and he is not the worse. You get accustomed to Dempsey and Martins so I guess its not fair. I was impressed by Craven for the small time he played...its too bad no one was at the end there to catch a good cross from him.   I'm so happy for Mears, he has been such a positive addition. He has helped us a shit load by keeping us rolling again. Another loss would've really brought down the moral. Thank god for a good start to the weekend!"
SoundersFC,3c2p07,canucknuckles,2,Sat Jul 4 05:16:31 2015 UTC,Frei came back in a sling the second half. He tried to tough it out --hopefully not so serious since he's been on fire.   It was amazing to see that goal up close. He hesitated for a second and I have to admit I was doubting him. Fooled me!
SoundersFC,3c2p07,lightjedi5,2,Sat Jul 4 05:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think both Roldan and Thomas had really a solid game. Roldan had so much hustle, it was a good sign and impressed me. Mears was rock solid, and oh boy what a strike!  I think this game illustrates just how much we missed Ozzie. He just makes the midfield gel, and him and Pineada were on point tinifht"
SoundersFC,3c2p07,steerbell,3,Sat Jul 4 07:31:45 2015 UTC,"I agree entirely on your last point. Pineda needs the time Alonso's presence provides him on the ball, to be effective. He looked like a different man than the one I saw getting ran over the last couple matches with Azira partnering him."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,banemaler,3,Sat Jul 4 07:54:32 2015 UTC,"Roldan had a few really nice passes tonight and overall was good. Needs to work on his first touch though, that was a big problem for him throughout the entire game. He's a rookie and it hasn't been constant outside of this game, so whatever. I'm really excited too watch him develop."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sat Jul 4 09:42:41 2015 UTC,"This was Roldan's poorest game in the middle, IMO. His touch was terrible and he couldn't protect the ball whatsoever when he did have it at his feet. He had far too many giveaways. A couple decent passes but overall very poor showing."
SoundersFC,3c2p07,Audicity,2,Sat Jul 4 19:14:58 2015 UTC,I feel like Thomas is doing a lot better and he's tracking back more which is good. Unfortunately he and Pineda had several times where they were occupying the same area. Hopefully the chemistry can continue to improve.
SoundersFC,3c2p07,bforeverdreamin,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:20:23 2015 UTC,yes Thomas looks like a good player who hasn't gelled much at all. Things just aren't clicking together but you can see what he is trying to do.

Next three matches should be easier - away at Chicago, home vs. Colorado, away at Montreal, with a full week in between each.

SoundersFC,3c31l9,Schwa142,2,Sat Jul 4 15:57:40 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its very unfortunate but we may be okay. In our next three matches we face some of the lowest scoring teams at 18, 12, and 19 goals, with goal differences of -6, -5, and -4 respectively. I know stats only tell a partial story, and come game day it may be a different scenario, but all things considering it could be worse haha."

We usually have 700-1000+ comments going there and get to bask with our fellow MLS frenemies. Afterward we head back here to /r/soundersfc for the post match discussion.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,SonOfMechaMummy,24,Sat Jul 4 05:04:27 2015 UTC,Tyrone Mears. Duh.  He was actually going to be my nomination even before he scored the winning goal.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,stealth_sloth,3,Sat Jul 4 05:07:52 2015 UTC,He's been a fantastic signing so far. And we got him on a free to boot...
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,HMARS,10,Sat Jul 4 06:02:17 2015 UTC,Probably Mears but I'll throw in Alonso because he controlled the midfield.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,MowwMoww,5,Sat Jul 4 05:12:07 2015 UTC,It was so nice to have Ozzie back. Roldan looked pretty good when he'd drift inside alongside Ozzie.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,ravegreener,3,Sat Jul 4 05:19:48 2015 UTC,Agreed. Its like night and day when we are with or without him.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,ajrcoyote,3,Sat Jul 4 05:21:51 2015 UTC,Crossbar with two clutch saves.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,Warvanov,2,Sat Jul 4 07:07:14 2015 UTC,"MEARS aside from the goal, played a fantastic game both offensively and on defense. Of course."
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,ravegreener,2,Sat Jul 4 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"My vote goes to Mears as well, because DUH. But I will also say Craven looked absolutely fantastic out there."
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,thatevildude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 06:35:38 2015 UTC,Craven wasn't even on for 20 minutes. My backup would have to be Ozzie. Controlled the midfield like the El General he is.
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,Audicity,2,Sat Jul 4 07:21:07 2015 UTC,"You're right there, but Ozzie was already nominated and I felt Craven should be mentioned for how he did play across the last 20 because he looked really good."
SoundersFC,3c2oyo,thatevildude,1 point,Sat Jul 4 14:57:58 2015 UTC,"How about Barrett? Never in my life have a seen a guy get off the field so quickly to give his team a chance.  But real talk, Mears."

Mears, Mears, Mears  Mears, Mears, Mears  He might have been an admiral a sultan or a king,  and to his praises we shall always sing.  And look what he has done for us he's filled us up with cheer!

SoundersFC,3c082s,AgentMulder_FBI,10,Fri Jul 3 19:38:05 2015 UTC,Might be because of the heat? I know the Portland v San Jose game was moved to 8pm because of the heat
SoundersFC,3c082s,Hail-To-The-V,4,Fri Jul 3 17:28:58 2015 UTC,I think it was always an 8pm kick off (as a season ticket holder I never received notice of a time change).  Houston's kickoff tonight is also 8pm local time.

SoundersFC,3c082s,itypedvorak,3,Fri Jul 3 16:45:20 2015 UTC,I haven't seen any indication of such but I just assumed it was because of surprise fireworks (my son would love that at least).

SoundersFC,3c082s,bjdm151,3,Fri Jul 3 21:18:54 2015 UTC,Probably the heat.  At 4pm they are calling for 88 degrees in Seattle.  This means that in the blaring midday sun it will be a even warmer on the pitch.  In the southwest corner I've sat through several 4 or 5pm kickoffs were I've been begging for the shade as it moves towards me.

SoundersFC,3bycmk,Arkyncrest,10,Fri Jul 3 04:12:56 2015 UTC,"Doesn't change anything imo. Everyone on the team is going to have egos and being a ""captain"" for the USMNT isn't going to change anything. Players are still going to look at Dempsey and think of him as an authority because of his demeanor and his goal scoring record abroad. Bradley fits the bill as captain because of his position and being in the middle of the field and his play style but Deuce and Howard are far more deserving of the claim than Bradley.   Yes, I dislike Bradley. Sue me."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,MowwMoww,8,Fri Jul 3 10:08:22 2015 UTC,"Bradley shit the bed nearly every minute of last World Cup. Maybe he's a leader off the field, but when the pressure is on he loses it."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,RabbiSchlem,-4,Fri Jul 3 12:06:48 2015 UTC,"Bradley was our best player last World Cup. Don't just be bitter because Dempsey lost the captain's armband.  Edit: don't know how I forgot about Howard, he was clearly our best player. Bradley was just one of our most important."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,bwc_28,8,Fri Jul 3 15:09:07 2015 UTC,I couldn't care less if Dempsey is captain.

He never looked confident.
SoundersFC,3bycmk,RabbiSchlem,-3,Fri Jul 3 16:35:52 2015 UTC,"Every player has off moments. But Bradley carried us with his overall fantastic play in the midfield. Obviously this is an opinion based argument, but every single pundit after the World Cup praised Bradley's play."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Jul 3 16:52:36 2015 UTC,"I don't agree that it's opinion based and I'm not too concerned with what the pundits think.  He is personally responsible for a tie w/ Portugal and his stat line is indicative that he was not fantastic. With 0 goals, 0 assists, few key passes, and no other exceptional stats to speak of, it's pretty clear that he was on the field but not impacting the game."

SoundersFC,3bycmk,TheBarberOfFleetSt,-1,Fri Jul 3 20:04:33 2015 UTC,Apparently more closely than the people here...
SoundersFC,3bycmk,bwc_28,3,Sat Jul 4 02:51:39 2015 UTC,Bradley was by far the worst player on the field for the duration of the world cup for USA.
SoundersFC,3bycmk,MowwMoww,2,Fri Jul 3 21:35:16 2015 UTC,"It's funny how much hate he's getting on here. Our entire offense and defense ran through him; he's one of, if not the, most scrutinized players on the national team. Any mistakes he makes are magnified, while any mistakes Yedlin made are being ignored (not that Yedlin wasn't great as well). But man, people here are going out of their way to find any flaws in Bradley's game."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,bwc_28,2,Sat Jul 4 02:51:17 2015 UTC,Bradley is the most overrated US player. He isn't a world class player and this past world cup was some of the worst soccer I have ever seen played by a supposedly world class midfielder. This is nothing new. It was a consensus that he was the worst player in the world cup for USA.
SoundersFC,3bycmk,MowwMoww,-2,Sat Jul 4 02:53:29 2015 UTC,"It was a consensus that he was the worst player in the world cup for USA.   Maybe on here, but not by pretty much anyone who's paid to know the sport. This blind hate here is really funny actually. The guy I originally responded pointed to Bradley's miss against Portugal to prove that he was the worst player on the team, yet completely ignored Wondo and Dempsey's missed against Belgium. Anyone who seriously think Bradley was the US's worst player clearly has no idea what they're talking about."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,bwc_28,3,Sat Jul 4 02:58:56 2015 UTC,"Go do some research. Every single analyst that was paid to anaylze the game had the exact same thoughts. I don't know where you were or if you watched the actual world cup, but it is definitely not ""blind hate"" and it was certainly not ""just here.""    Anyone who seriously think Bradley was the US's worst player clearly has no idea what they're talking about.   k"
SoundersFC,3bycmk,MowwMoww,0,Sat Jul 4 03:00:55 2015 UTC,"I have done research, and there are just as many pundits saying Bradley played well as those saying he made mistakes. But when you have to do more than any other player on the field (for any team), there are going to be mistakes. People like you ignore just how vital he is to our team, and he almost single handedly ensured we made it out of the group stage with the work he put in. But continue the downvoting because you disagree, just makes it seem like you can't handle a differing opinion."

You said he was complete shit, which is absurd considering the articles you used to ""prove"" your point in fact proved the opposite. You completely ignore how he was the most important US player during the World Cup because everything ran through him, the amount of work he put in is proof of this. He made two mistakes, I can point to just as many that Dempsey, Yedlin, Wondo, or any other player made other than Howard. Which makes me realize I was wrong, I admit that now, Bradley wasn't our best player. Our best player was Howard and I'm ashamed I didn't include him."

Take him out of our lineup after Altidore goes down and we have nothing. It's easy to say he was shit if you ignore everything else. But when you take the entire picture into consideration it becomes obvious how important Bradley is and was.

SoundersFC,3bycmk,Ozzimo,4,Fri Jul 3 04:17:29 2015 UTC,"While I don't really care about the arm band, it's just another item on top of the heap of over reaction to the US Open Cup antics.  While Dempsey did step over the line by doing what all of us wanted to do at that point in the match, I don't feel it warranted a 3 game suspension in MLS regular season play, AND a 2 year US Open Cup ban, AND forfeiting the Captain's arm band.  That being said, Dempsey always plays really well when he's angry, and as long as he can keep it behind that line, I think he'll step out with something to prove and make the most of his return."
SoundersFC,3bycmk,AgentMulder_FBI,0,Fri Jul 3 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"I disagree on the punishment side. 3 games is about right and Sigi made it clear that kind of thing is not going to be acceptable on this team. I was there at the game and wanted to slowly roast the ref over hot coals but a player gets paid to not let the ref get in his head. And as satisfying as it was to see him do that, it's not professional and needed to be punished. Best thing we can do it put it behind us and get some wins. Jurgan made the call about the armband and I'm sure he thought that kind of thing was just as unacceptable.   Also I don't think Clint cares if he is captain or not, so I agree with you there. He'll be baller and when Oba gets back, we'll all be baller. :)"

SoundersFC,3bt1i4,Chug2778,10,Wed Jul 1 22:26:34 2015 UTC,"At the start of the year and even going back a couple years I've been wanting a Dempsey-level midfielder like a Kaka or a Pirlo. At this point I think I might change my tune because of the amount of midfielders we have now. It's just not really reasonable to have 4 or 5 attacking midfielders competing for two spots along with 3 or 4 defensive midfielders doing the same. With Thomas, Pappa, Roldan, Rose, Friberg, and Pineda, there really isn't much room in the midfield any longer.  At the same time I hate the idea of spending DP money on the defense because I don't think you need to. Mears has been great and Marshall is as well and neither of those are even close to DP money.   I guess if I absolutely had to have one I'd choose a central midfielder and have Pappa and Thomas on the wings with Deuce and Oba up top and Alonso at defensive mid. That way we've got solid attacking options everywhere with a solid defense as well.   edit: I don't mean to equate Dempsey to Pirlo or Kaka's level. That's ridiculous. Those are players for the history books, and Dempsey isn't really at that level. I mean big name guys that pack a punch."
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,MowwMoww,2,Wed Jul 1 22:50:26 2015 UTC,"If they changed Dempsey to a CM that would be amazing. Spend the money on another forward and have Pappa and Thomas on the wings. Probably would never happen but I always get Georgios Samaras on FIFA Career Mode. Has speed, strength, height, and ability on the ball."
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,uselessattempt,7,Thu Jul 2 00:21:12 2015 UTC,"That's my secret fantasy. A Dempsey CM to Montero/Martins up to...it's just so delicious since Montero can hit those long shots and Martins is scary in the box.   Put in a 4-4-2 diamond, with Pappa/Neagle on the corners, Alonso out back, and the normal 4 out back."
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,uselessattempt,5,Thu Jul 2 00:43:26 2015 UTC,"That would be nice... Not a hug fan of Naggle though. Give me Thomas.

SoundersFC,3bt1i4,lightjedi5,3,Fri Jul 3 20:48:53 2015 UTC,I would like to see Kelyn Rowe(seattle native)... not a dp but he is a good winger and forward and gives us options in the attack and is interchangeable with Pappa. But DP signing Thomas Miller would be nice.. awesome forward and midfielder and natural goal scorer especially with Dempsey  and Martins
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,thewanderingsounder,2,Thu Jul 2 04:45:58 2015 UTC,I would really like to see Kelyn come to Seattle.
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,lightjedi5,3,Thu Jul 2 04:49:54 2015 UTC,A centerback...dare I say...John Terry? No but seriously either that or an attacking wing. People say we don't need a DP CB but I think we do.
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,joylongdivision,2,Fri Jul 3 05:42:56 2015 UTC,"THIS, even with Evans we need a third quality CB. Scott will be leaving soon"
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,SeaGooner,1 point,Fri Jul 3 19:12:12 2015 UTC,I don't like Evans at CB. He can be an effective outside back but not centerback. He can make the runs down the sideline and cover back when he needs to as well as cross the ball quite effectively. The sooner we do something like that the better.
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,alexj757,2,Fri Jul 3 06:43:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think he's horrible at CB, he's average for the quality of the league. Which is impressive considering how little he's been playing it. However, I think he was good at RM as a box to box type who would stay a little more at home while Pappa and Pineda or whoever joined the attack."
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,Jack2142,2,Fri Jul 3 17:25:49 2015 UTC,"I'll link this post of mine a while back talking about why I don't think bringing Dempsey into midfield would work, as I think it'd warrant much more of a system change than you guys think. Just Ozzie as the only midfielder out of the 4 actually defending would be a shambles, plus Dempsey is wasted in midfield and has been at pretty much every club that tried him there.  As for a 4th DP, my vote goes for a box to box midfielder to play along Ozzie, just like Tiffert was. We really haven't had one ever, and as much as I like Pineda, I don't know if he'll have the legs to do the job beyond this season. Friberg is average and not necessarily better than Pineda (though fantastic depth, and I'm happy to have him back), Rose is average, Azira doesn't play the same position, and Roldan/everyone else won't be ready as quickly as we'd like them to. I would've liked Sacha Kljestan, but really just someone to play the Pineda role and be available all season would do."
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,antifreze,2,Thu Jul 2 15:13:24 2015 UTC,Abou Diaby. Pineda isn't cutting it anymore. would make a great backup though
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,MowwMoww,1 point,Fri Jul 3 01:43:20 2015 UTC,I am an avid Everton fan and as such I would have to say Aiden McGeady. He hasn't really found his niche at Everton and the fans are unsettled with him after his season because of their frustration. He would tear it up in MLS on the wing. Amazing work rate and quite a quick player as well.
SoundersFC,3bt1i4,thewanderingsounder,1 point,Thu Jul 2 00:38:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly any winger who is a good scoring threat would be my preference, Neagle is my favorite player, but I will admit in an ideal starting 11 based off his form this year he is the weakest piece. If we could get a winger who can act as a goal threat with more technical skill than neagle we would be great. My dream signing would be Hulk, but that isn't realistic because he just signed an extension at Zenit. The other option might be a DP left back, but that is me being weird.   alternatively it would be fun to have Montero back I think we could maybe run a 4-3-3  -Dempsey-Oba-Montero-  -Friberg-Pappa-Alonso-  -Remick-Marshall-Evans-Mears-  -Frei-"

First off, there are no bad seats, I've never been disappointed.    sitting way up close (first ~10 rows) is fun because you can see the players up close and appreciate how much work they're doing. The downside is that you see the area great near you but the rest of the field is harder to see due to your lower viewing angle.  further back you start to get a better view of the tactics, but lose the details on the players 100 level stands the whole game, which adds to the excitement and involvement of the crowd around you  200 level sits, chairs are padded. And they have access to the club level. I don't think I've ever actually sat in the 200s 300 level is like watching on TV. Great view of everything but a bit detached from the crowds energy. One benefit is that there are bathrooms for 35,000 people up there, but Sounders usually have only a couple sections open—so no lines. Getting in and out of the stadium is fast too if you take the stairs. Don't take the ramp.  Sitting near the south end is nice because hearing ECS be rowdy is fun.  Sitting with ECS is even more fun. You stand and sing the whole game but sometimes you can't see what's going on.    Try 'em all and report back which you like most!"
SoundersFC,3bpgu1,doublemazaa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 06:05:44 2015 UTC,"Not all 200 level chairs are padded and sit, and have access to the club area. I think that is mostly on the west side.   Source- I ""sit"" in 229, stand, and got yelled at for once going into the club level."
SoundersFC,3bpgu1,BugSTi,1 point,Wed Jul 1 13:50:44 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah my bad. Looks like club access is not the corner 200 sections.   Sections 205 to 213 and 231 to 239 have access."
SoundersFC,3bpgu1,doublemazaa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:27:43 2015 UTC,Ok.. well definitely have been to games where I sat and stood but definitely want to be standing from now on! Being a part of everything is worth it and I am able to see fine! So you'd suggest the 200's?
SoundersFC,3bpgu1,doublemazaa,1 point,Wed Jul 1 18:30:56 2015 UTC,"If you want to stand, I'd recommend the 100s on the south side. Between 109 and 135, depending on your budget. Good view and energy from ECS. Rows behind row V in sideline sections are covered, so you may get some rain protection, depending on wind."

SoundersFC,3bkcxt,ViewASCII,4,Mon Jun 29 23:33:11 2015 UTC,It all started with the Tweet /u/vuduwastaken posted...  And took off from there.
SoundersFC,3blejd,PeteyNice,6,Tue Jun 30 04:11:43 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that we are going to drop points in MLS in order to win these games. Everyone knows that, right? We agree that we aren't going to complain about MLS losses in Aug, right?"
SoundersFC,3blejd,vuduwastaken,3,Tue Jun 30 09:23:41 2015 UTC,I am not so sure. I'd be surprised if we pick up more than three points in our four games in July. It is entirely possible that we are on a seven game losing streak when we host Vancouver on 8/1. Those MLS games may be the difference between playoffs/no playoffs.
SoundersFC,3blejd,pete_is_writing23,5,Tue Jun 30 15:09:08 2015 UTC,"My question is - what would we rather have?  Success in MLS or success in CCL?  If it's a question of one vs. the other, I choose CCL.  But, this is MLS, where 6/10 teams in each conference makes the playoffs, so dropping MLS games in July/Aug won't kill the season (I hope)"
SoundersFC,3blejd,thewanderingsounder,1 point,Tue Jun 30 17:40:12 2015 UTC,"We are currently four points ahead of SJ (Current #7 in the West) and they have two games in hand on us. If we go 0 for July, and concede more games in August/September I do not think a playoff spot is guaranteed. In a tough group already, I'd rather focus on MLS get a good seed and make a run for MLS Cup vs focus on CCL and possibly miss the playoffs entirely."
SoundersFC,3blejd,thewanderingsounder,1 point,Tue Jun 30 18:25:14 2015 UTC,"we play Chicago, Philly, and Montreal. I see six or seven points there."

SoundersFC,3bm0w0,vuduwastaken,3,Tue Jun 30 08:40:03 2015 UTC,Why is no one talking about how we seem to hand over possession in the middle and our defensive third so many times. I think at least 1 if not more of their goals started with us just playing garbage passes directly back to timbers players. Ya we don't have Oba or Deuce but it feels like our midfield possession and distribution is the real problem right now.
SoundersFC,3bivzj,alexj757,14,Mon Jun 29 16:23:33 2015 UTC,"He's plays more of a true center mid than offensive/defensive.  He has good hold up play, good vision, and great distribution, but he lacks pace and isn't the best tackler.  He can play the full 90 week in and week out though.  He might be the link between our midfield and our strikers we seem to have been missing these past few games.  Also, he has a very low tolerance for bullshit.  And his name is Erik."
SoundersFC,3bivzj,Looorney,10,Mon Jun 29 16:51:53 2015 UTC,That gif is a example of how you become a legend to the fans.

SoundersFC,3bivzj,Schwa142,13,Mon Jun 29 22:47:03 2015 UTC,Not flat out speed but very good game speed. Reads the game well and gives a high effort. Seems to pop up in the right places at the right times. Good passer and communicator. Seems like a great teammate kind of guy and loves tacos.
SoundersFC,3bivzj,steerbell,7,Mon Jun 29 16:29:11 2015 UTC,"I agree with all this. He's not dissimilar to a more fit, let veteran Pineda. When he and Evans were splitting time, he was more likely to make aggressive passes at the expense of being a bit less accurate. He's not much of a scoring threat, but he can make the assist or unlocking pass."
SoundersFC,3bivzj,notgarysmulyan,4,Mon Jun 29 17:11:13 2015 UTC,You had me at tacos.
SoundersFC,3bivzj,megaclown,2,Mon Jun 29 19:16:04 2015 UTC,"Sounds like what I remember, Friberg is just one of those guys that knows how to play soccer.  He's not the fastest or the most skilled guy ever but he's was always making the right decisions.  I remember a lot of passes to the guy that ended up with the assist.   The way the midfield has been moving the ball lately I can't wait to see him back in the lineup."
SoundersFC,3bivzj,newbachu,7,Mon Jun 29 20:50:40 2015 UTC,"We all loved him and were sad to see him go...  He only left because he wanted his child be born back home, in Sweden, because of citizenship.  Here's a good writeup on what his signing would mean to us.  Also he LOVES TACOS!  He once had such a craving, he turned his opponent into tacos.  Leo and Neagle are getting the tacos ready for Friberg's arrival."
SoundersFC,3bivzj,Schwa142,2,Mon Jun 29 20:56:15 2015 UTC,The tacos have only gotten better in Seattle since he left. He can even have Rancho Bravo drive-thru = can't lose
SoundersFC,3bivzj,perforce1,3,Tue Jun 30 06:18:08 2015 UTC,He also wrapped tape around his socks so his family could identify him in games. I thought that was cool. He just seemed like a real likable guy.
SoundersFC,3bivzj,insultant_,2,Mon Jun 29 20:51:39 2015 UTC,Now we just need to get Flaco back!
SoundersFC,3bivzj,ravegreener,4,Mon Jun 29 16:33:09 2015 UTC,Too big of a diver for my taste. Skilled no doubt but we don't need him back.

He will get his spot back from Thomas when he returns no doubt. Pineda might start in the mid depending on whether Friberg ends up on the wings or not.
SoundersFC,3bivzj,Jack2142,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:59:44 2015 UTC,I like that. Only I prefer Barrett coming off the bench. It seems to be his specialty. He did however really well against the 'Caps as a starter...

SoundersFC,3bivzj,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 21:13:35 2015 UTC,Pineda out wide? That seems like a lot of running for his old legs. I'd rather Friberg out wide and put Pineda back in the middle.
SoundersFC,3bivzj,CascadiaKid,1 point,Tue Jun 30 02:20:40 2015 UTC,"Friberg has to take the amf/cmf spot from Pineda. Maybe Pineda shifts back to push Azira out of the line up? I hope maybe we try Friberg stacked on top of Rose, and one of our other options on the right(Roldan, Darwin, Neagle, Kovar).  But Rose is never played at dmf, any ideas why? Seems like a natural for a larger, high motor guy with medium technical ability and good ballwinning?"

SoundersFC,3bk74x,CascadiaKid,3,Tue Jun 30 03:14:52 2015 UTC,Most youth clubs like Crossfire require their players to pay a couple thousand dollars a year to play. That's fair compensation isn't it?
SoundersFC,3bk74x,SvanirePerish,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:30:15 2015 UTC,"Not in this instance. Crossfire is a pay to play club, that's how they make their money, which some could argue takes away the incentive to hire good coaches."

SoundersFC,3bie1k,FHlogin,25,Mon Jun 29 13:58:29 2015 UTC,"Ladies and gentlemen, this isn't the time to panic.   We're dealing with injuries and the team leadership (Sigi, Garth, Adrian et al) are correctly not rushing to get people back in the line up. This is the correct part of the season to take these losses.  We took an early lead and everyone is prone to panic because, oh god, what if this is a collapse?! Why aren't we winning every game!? WHY AM I PAYING THIS MONEY TO THE TEAM!?  This year's goal is the MLS Cup. Above all else. Getting knocked out of the US Open cup sucks (oh God does the way we went out suck) but it actually just removes a distraction we've already won four times. Supporter's Shield? I'd love to have it, but I don't want it as much as I want a star on the jersey.  The West is, as a /r/MLS user put it: a meatgrinder. It's going to chew teams up with the top being very tumultuous as it grinds the teams against each other in this very balanced conference.  Yesterday we faced a keyed-up, hungry, firing on all cylinders Portland team. Wednesday was Philadelphia who also played well. The US Open cup was an implosion which will haunt us and be brought up for years to come.  If we drop out of the top 4 teams, or even out of the playoff, I'm not going to worry until we're back to a full roster and still losing. We're getting valuable minutes for our young players during this time. We'll be better once our stars return, until then we have to just grit our teeth and endure the rollercoaster."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,trickjarrett,9,Mon Jun 29 14:38:38 2015 UTC,"Wednesday was Philadelphia who also played well.    this is the only thing I disagree with. I thought they were really bad with the good fortune of facing basically our reserves. Otherwise, spot-on."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Mon Jun 29 17:17:25 2015 UTC,"I won't fight on that line too hard. I do feel they played well, for the Philadelphia Union, but it won't be hard to convince me otherwise."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,trickjarrett,7,Mon Jun 29 17:34:25 2015 UTC,"Yep, great post.  No doubt July is going to suck, but it's still early enough in the season to take these licks.  The X-factor in my mind is Friberg.  If he's fit, he'll likely be an upgrade over Pineda/Azira.  The middle of the field is where we're really getting killed.  Ozzie will be back soon, and a pairing with Friberg might turn things up a notch.  I wouldn't bet my house on it, but it's a hopeful signing."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,coopernurse,2,Mon Jun 29 14:50:14 2015 UTC,"I don't think July is going to suck at all here's why:   Ozzie is going to be back. We will have a solid holding mid from which we can launch an attack. He will also sure up our defense. Pineda will have a 2nd game back from his knock and he'll be back into thee swing of things. He was ineffective last game. Friberg maybe? We signed Andy Craven from S2. If you haven't watched S2, you can describe Andy with one word: workhorse. He will provide some much needed depth for our forwards."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Jun 29 21:21:27 2015 UTC,"I hope your right, but what about the shield race? DC is in first and Vancouver is second, it's looking like we're out of the running unless the rest of the East gets better and dethrones DC."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,StrongSideSafety,2,Mon Jun 29 19:06:40 2015 UTC,"If the East continues to let DC walk all over them there is no way that a Western team will get the Supporter's Shield.  It says a lot when the undisputed team (11 point lead over second place) in the East has trouble making top 3 in the power rankings.  With no strong second contender in the East SS is a tough thing to get.  The main focus, and the focus that the Sounders seem to be taking is strengthening the team and resting to prevent late season injury.  There is this weird concept of losing our DPs as being a blessing in disguise because the rest of the team will have to learn how to play without Dempsey-Martins up top disrupting the other team; the duo is too good, the rest of the team seems lost without both on the field.  We didn't have much of a real threat up top in Portland so they were pretty free to recklessly attack."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,pw4ql159HZ,2,Mon Jun 29 20:26:59 2015 UTC,I don't care about the shield race. This year I want a star. I'll sacrifice every other tournament or event to that end.

SoundersFC,3bie1k,Jack2142,4,Mon Jun 29 16:17:26 2015 UTC,This is actually our first three game losing streak since the late season 2013 meltdown... and only the second time we have lost more than back to back games in 5 years.   Honestly the only thing that bugs me retrospectively was our lineup vs Philly. I think if we started Marshall & Scott rather than Ockford and played a 4-4-2 with Neagle & Jones we could have won. Instead we tried to squeak out a draw against Philly so we could squeak out a draw against Portland. Overall I think that was a wrong move. a 1-0-2 looks better than a 0-2-1 or a 0-0-3.
SoundersFC,3bie1k,mferrell50,3,Mon Jun 29 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"I think we limp into the playoffs, hopefully pull a Galaxy and get hot right about then.  July is going to be a brutal month for this team."
SoundersFC,3bie1k,littlenicky174,2,Mon Jun 29 16:31:09 2015 UTC,"I haven't watched much soccer beyond the Sounders this season so I don't know if our upcoming opponents are as bad as the standings would have us believe, but considering 3/4 teams we face in July are in the bottom 4 in the league I can maybe see us limping this one out without an absolutely shitty month. Getting Ozzy back, having Craven, Barrett, and HOPEFULLY Friberg will definitely boost us up a bit. I am cautiously optimistic, perhaps stupidly so. Oh well, screw it, lets hop on the roller coaster boys!"

SoundersFC,3bgk7s,SeattleGunner,21,Mon Jun 29 01:11:22 2015 UTC,We look like a team that's missing its three best players.  Alonso stops most of those attacks in by breaking up stuff in the midfield. Oba and Dempsey are both able to connect with the midfield much more effectively than what we saw today.  It will get better... Eventually
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,buttstuff2k15,18,Mon Jun 29 01:08:31 2015 UTC,"Well, that's four goals that don't happen with Alonso on the field. I miss Honey Badger."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,stealth_sloth,7,Mon Jun 29 01:10:20 2015 UTC,"People hyped up our ""depth"" too much because we never had to play without 3 DP's at a time early in the season. It turns out when we lose our three best players and a third of our cap space our team isn't that impressive."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Jack2142,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:20:52 2015 UTC,Our depth means that we can replace any one player on the team (and most two players) and still be really good. Not that we can replace them all at once.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Chuurp,6,Wed Jul 1 19:21:50 2015 UTC,It's hilarious how many people on Facebook call for Sigi to be canned after every loss. We're still 2nd in the conference and can be leading MLS when they return.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,PeperonyNChease,6,Mon Jun 29 01:44:58 2015 UTC,Sounders fb commented are literally the worst.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Eff3ction,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:12:29 2015 UTC,I think you're confusing them with Britta.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,ravegreener,11,Mon Jun 29 02:35:49 2015 UTC,I've seen so much misguided blame today that I'm not even going to give me thoughts. It's really disappointing that people jump on the newest members of the team and blame them every time something like this happens. I saw people blaming Azira and Fisher and it's just getting stupid.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,steerbell,16,Mon Jun 29 01:08:46 2015 UTC,Azira was bad but so were Rose and Pineda. Really the whole midfield took the day off.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Jun 29 01:12:06 2015 UTC,I thought Rose played fairly well. Pineda is freshly back and didn't have much of an impact.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,stealth_sloth,3,Mon Jun 29 01:18:43 2015 UTC,Rose played quite well in the first half. I thought he faded a little in the second; I wasn't shocked when he was subbed off.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,steerbell,5,Mon Jun 29 01:27:43 2015 UTC,Rose seems to want to either play up or back and doesnt seem to be able to do both wich is a bad trait for a mid.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:29:43 2015 UTC,He's not a B2B mid; he used play CAM or CDM. We don't play a diamond anymore though so it's a bit constrictive. Not sure where he fits in but he is a decent player. I think he gets thrown off balance when he tries to cover for other players.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,bwc_28,4,Mon Jun 29 01:37:48 2015 UTC,"The thing is Azira is always bad. Rose and Pineda were not playing well today either, but Azira was simply woeful. That last goal he completely gave up and left his man wide open, it was embarrassing. I'm pissed about Azira because he shouldn't be getting starting minutes because this is how he always plays, godawful. I'm also upset at Rose, Pineda, and our entire defense outside of Mears for not showing up today. But Azira is just terrible, and he is every single game."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,stealth_sloth,5,Mon Jun 29 01:28:44 2015 UTC,"On replaying our past few games in my head, I'm coming to the conclusion people have been mislabeling Azira when they argue that he's simply not good enough (even as a backup to Alonso).  On a few occasions we've seen Azira stay central and focus almost purely on defensive responsibilities though - don't go roaming, don't get fancy with the ball, just keep his head down and try to make his part of the field as quiet as possible - he's done a reasonable job at it. And that, more than anything else, is what we need out of a player filling in for Alonso. It wasn't the only thing wrong today, but someone doing a first-rate job at filling that role would have prevented all four goals Portland scored today (as well as most of their other chances).  But recently Azira keeps trying to play like Alonso 2.0 instead. He roams wide all over the midfield when he sees opportunities to try to win the ball. He tries to dribble out of pressure, or switch the ball through a crowd of opponents to break a press. He lunges in hard trying to immediately regain the ball if it is tackled off him, rather than dropping and covering. He overlaps forward to join the attack when he thinks there's an opening.  Alonso does all that and almost always makes it work - while still handling his crucial defensive responsibilities. When Azira tries to copy him, he gets burned - and our whole team burns along. Bad turnovers, caught out of position, worn down and losing energy and mental focus by late in matches.  I am emphatically not trying to point a finger at Azira - we don't know enough about behind the scenes instructions and expectations. What I will say is that I suspect it would do Azira and the Sounders a world of good if he would just start narrowing his focus and simplifying his game. Sit in his zone and control it. A good game from Azira would be a game so boring that we all completely forget he's in the game at all... but the opponents never manage to attack down the middle against us successfully.  If he can do that, it opens up tons of flexibility for the rest of our offense."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,nxtplato,2,Mon Jun 29 10:26:31 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I've only seen him put together a handful of decent plays since he put on the Rave Green.   He doesn't have what it takes to be a starter for us by a long shot.  Every time I see him in the eleven, I get this sense of impending mediocrity."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,USA_A-OK,2,Mon Jun 29 06:45:28 2015 UTC,Azira is constantly flat-footed and Pineda is just plain slow.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vershastri,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:17:50 2015 UTC,"I know Fisher sorta caused the 2nd goal to happen, but I did like him today. Seems more confident on the ball than Remick. Better dribbler too."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,overruns,9,Mon Jun 29 01:16:15 2015 UTC,I see him as a not quite as fast version of Yedlin. He can get caught out of position but he is a good defender and has good skill on the ball. The decision making will come.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vershastri,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:23:46 2015 UTC,Well said
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:30:46 2015 UTC,Remick is WAY faster though. I think Fisher was a little out of position sometimes on defense.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Eff3ction,3,Mon Jun 29 01:25:54 2015 UTC,Wasn't Remick faster than Yedlin in the 40? I thought I remember seeing he was the fastest player on the team.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 02:08:49 2015 UTC,That is correct.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,overruns,9,Mon Jun 29 02:15:20 2015 UTC,Ariza does a great job winning balls but without Ozzie to hold possession in the midfield we struggle because in his current form Ariza can't seem to hold the ball or make crisp passes. Frankly him and Pineda just don't work as a pair and thats a bigger issue than individual skill IMO.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,metameh,5,Mon Jun 29 01:12:29 2015 UTC,"That's what happens when an immobile 8 (Pineda, probably still playing with a knock) and a 6 that can't cover east-to-west (Azira has never demonstrated sufficient lateral quickness) are matched up against a 3 man midfield; they get overrun. Barrett should've been the lone striker so instead of chipping helpless balls to the top of the box, Pappa and Neagle would've had room to shoot from distance."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,4,Mon Jun 29 01:15:05 2015 UTC,Glad to see Craven moving up. He almost had a goal on that diving attempt.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,FlameOfUndun,6,Mon Jun 29 01:29:20 2015 UTC,"The midfield was beaten consistently as the announcers touched on. Would we look better with Evans in the midfield and Scott in the back when our depth is being tested so much? I thought we looked pretty good in the (I think) Dallas game when Evans came into the midfield. Either way, it's been a tough stretch of games, I hope we can get back into a good run of form soon."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Audicity,4,Mon Jun 29 01:12:43 2015 UTC,I hate this week in Sounders soccer. Just let the pain end.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Jack2142,8,Mon Jun 29 01:12:22 2015 UTC,"Everyone on the field seemed to have bricks tied to their feet and were just horribly outrun by the Timbers.   Azira is good at running around and winning back the ball, but he either holds it to long and losses it or sprays terrible passes.   Rose is too slow to be a winger, that was disappointing.   Pineda is just too slow now he cant create space and he can't catch players so he has gone from a defensive + to a liability.   Neagle & Barrett were better together than solo albeit not great, fuck Dempsey for being stupid.   Fisher looked alright he seemed to attack a little too much leaving space open that he couldn't recover. However he actually made some good runs and had pretty good passing compared to our midfield.   Frei was pretty good until the team defensively completely collapsed after the 70th minute."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Jun 29 01:16:27 2015 UTC,Rose traditionally played CAM
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,fezdaddy,3,Mon Jun 29 01:20:23 2015 UTC,I'm ready for August.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Eff3ction,2,Mon Jun 29 01:09:33 2015 UTC,"Yeah, seriously. July is going to SUCK."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,btener412,3,Mon Jun 29 02:11:38 2015 UTC,It almost felt like they were passing to Portland. T_T
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,steerbell,3,Mon Jun 29 01:12:54 2015 UTC,"I hate losing to Portland as much as anyone else does, but let's look at the past week this way. They played like a team without their three best players, and it showed. They look awful. And despite this, they're still sitting at 2nd in the West, only one win behind Vancouver. When those pieces come back, this is a scary team, and I absolutely love it."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vershastri,5,Mon Jun 29 03:25:54 2015 UTC,"So Sigi What do you do when your team shows no heart , no desire and gives the ball away like a team of nine year olds?"
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,coopernurse,4,Mon Jun 29 01:10:13 2015 UTC,Spank some stamps on their asses and ship them off to Chicago! :D
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Pilliot5,2,Mon Jun 29 01:17:11 2015 UTC,"Without Deuce, Oba, and Ozzy we become a very ordinary team with an above average keeper.  We struggle in possession and lack creativity in attack.   It's not surprising that our only goal was from a set piece.  We haven't looked dangerous from the run of play since Starfire.   Let's hope Ozzy returns soon and shakes any post injury rust. Maybe Friberg will be able to contribute.  I'm bracing for a rough July but I'd love to be pleasantly surprised."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,k_princess,7,Mon Jun 29 03:35:53 2015 UTC,"Well, now I know what I feel like to be a Timbers fan most of the time."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,philwelch,5,Mon Jun 29 01:28:42 2015 UTC,"I'm getting sick of people blaming this loss and the others on missing Dempsey, Oba, and Ozzie. It doesn't matter who the best players are. What matters is whether the rest of the team steps up to the challenge. It seems like the players, just like a lot of the fans, rely on those 3 DPs too much. They look like they don't know how to play. Sigi needs to get the team used to not playing with all the DPs, since Dempsey and Evans get called for national team duty on a fairly regular basis, and Pappa is going to be on his national team.   Tl;dr: The team needs to learn to play without the DPs and figure out how to get the ball in the net on their own."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,cantbeassed,4,Mon Jun 29 01:26:00 2015 UTC,"This is MLS. Because of the DP rule and the salary cap, reasonable depth is impossible if you want any chance of having a good enough starting 11 to win the title."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,danhig,4,Mon Jun 29 07:03:48 2015 UTC,"That's silly. It's not that the team can't step up, it's that Portland isn't missing 3 DPs. It's one thing to build a team around certain players, it's another to not have level playing fields."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,k_princess,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:51:31 2015 UTC,Timbers were playing without one of their DPs (Ridgewell)
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,CougFanDan,0,Tue Jun 30 01:00:17 2015 UTC,"While I completely agree with the statement of us playing a team with all of their DPs, my statement of the rest of the team needing to step up still stands. A team is made of individuals with a common goal in mind, and will work together to accomplish that goal. A team is not 3 players and some other guys that happen to be on the pitch.  We did miss the 3 DPs today. But somewhere along the line, the other players have to figure out that this is their chance to make a name for themselves and not get down in the dumps because they have no one to pass the ball to."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,joshing_slocum,2,Mon Jun 29 05:56:25 2015 UTC,"I think people are blaming Fisher for not getting back on defense, but it seemed clear to me that he was told to contribute offensively and not necessarily worry about coming back. Seems like a scheme/strategy issue rather than personnel"
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,_Anthropophobiac_,2,Mon Jun 29 01:57:16 2015 UTC,"Hey, just came to say that Frei is one hell of a keeper and you guys are lucky to have him (#jealous)."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,2thetop_1,3,Mon Jun 29 02:51:50 2015 UTC,"Fuck. As others have said, this is just another example of how bad we are without our top 3. We lack depth, and it goes to show how you need people on the bench who can step up and make plays when your stars are out, and that's something we don't have.   They beat us in every way tonight. Oh well, onto the next match."

SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:23:58 2015 UTC,"I hope this is just a speed bump in our season and not a collapse, hopefully things get better when the DPs are back in action. We looked really demotivated after the second goal too and then let them take advantage of it and seal the deal with the next one."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,bforeverdreamin,4,Mon Jun 29 01:25:18 2015 UTC,I'm glad it's happening now instead of like 2 weeks before the playoffs. We'll get Ozzie back next week and Martins and Dempsey at the end of July. We'll have just enough time to get fine tuned again before heading into the playoffs.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,SplooshFC,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:31:30 2015 UTC,"At this point, I just hope we make the playoffs... jesus... please don't let portland leap us in the table."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,mcmSEA,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:01:05 2015 UTC,"I wish people would stop saying it annoying to them that we are ""complaining"" about our DPs missing. Our league is BUILT on the DP system now. So when we miss these star players it does cripple our team, because they are glue that holds us together. Look at LA missing Donovan, and expecting Gerrard it's taken them awhile. When you miss your DPs you miss your creative presence."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,USA_A-OK,1 point,Mon Jun 29 14:39:05 2015 UTC,that would be four losses in a row.  Do we have a Plan B? C? How about D?
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,francostine,1 point,Mon Jun 29 05:04:58 2015 UTC,I can't watch that Azira-Pineda pairing anymore. It is so bad.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,steveotheguide,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:15:59 2015 UTC,"Even though neagle scored, he still looks totally lost as a forward."
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 29 07:55:10 2015 UTC,The day Azira is off this team is the day I breath easy again. He was fucking horrible today.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,CougFanDan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:09:23 2015 UTC,We don't have anyone else that can play CDM. Maybe that's something we'll pick up this summer but I think he does well enough now. He's not quite hit his prime and he is improving.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,itsallgoodie,0,Mon Jun 29 01:22:06 2015 UTC,I hope that the Friberg rumors lead to Azira finally leaving
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Doowutchyalike20,0,Mon Jun 29 01:58:00 2015 UTC,We looked like a team that had no idea what it was doing. We looked like a team that had no confidence and no drive. It won't take dempsey and Oba coming back to fix the shifty attitude our team seems to have without them. I'm getting real sick of watching losses with players only seeming to half heartedly care.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,clickmyface,0,Mon Jun 29 01:29:03 2015 UTC,We are better than this but we need to have a plan B moving forward. Without Oba and Dempsey we are just average.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Doowutchyalike20,4,Mon Jun 29 01:12:08 2015 UTC,Ozzie. You can't complain much about Lamar and Chad or Craven or Darwin when they only touch the ball like 15 times. We need a midfield that is capable of connecting forward and we don't have that without the best CDM in the league aka Ozzie Alonso.
SoundersFC,3bgk7s,Eff3ction,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:30:16 2015 UTC,For sure Ozzie is our main piece in the middle and that's where the attack starts. A soccer team is more than one player and unfortunately we are down 3!

SoundersFC,3bguei,hhdslater,6,Mon Jun 29 02:41:15 2015 UTC,EDIT: correct Oba injury ETA  Writing this on my phone on the bus back to Seattle so this will be a bit brief.   Dempsey: 3 match MLS suspension which finished today but now he reports to the USMNT for the Gold Cup. If the US runs deep into the tournament as expected he'll be out most of July  Oba: adductor injury in open cup match. Out another ~3-4 weeks.   Ozzie: hamstring.  I thought he'd be in the 18 today. Should play the next match but probably won't start.   Leo: picked up a knock in the open cup match. I don't know details.   Evans and Pappa will leave this week for the Gold Cup. Pappa will probably return first unless Guatamala makes a run in the tournament.   Remick is available and was in the 18 today.
SoundersFC,3bguei,coopernurse,3,Mon Jun 29 04:27:35 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that Oba was expected to be out 3-6 weeks, as of about 10 days ago - so, back mid-to-late July. Is your 6-week ballpark based on a new update I missed?"
SoundersFC,3bguei,stealth_sloth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 06:46:31 2015 UTC,The original estimate I heard two weeks ago was 6-8 weeks.  So I was taking the pessimistic end of the range.  Hope he's back sooner!

SoundersFC,3bgke7,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Jun 29 01:16:05 2015 UTC,That save was truly fantastic.
SoundersFC,3bgke7,bwc_28,7,Mon Jun 29 01:25:32 2015 UTC,"Frei. He was our saving grace today. It easily could have been 20-1 if he hadn't made all those saves. And the commentators were right: It's great that a goalkeeper can have that many saves, but it is telling that the defense isn't what it should be."

SoundersFC,3bfm07,JustinCasy,1 point,Sun Jun 28 20:14:42 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be surprised if sigi rests Ozzie if he's not 100% especially with how chippy these games can get. I'll take him being rested and healed for DC and onward over him playing limited minutes with the possibility of re injury and more games with him out. Hopefully Barret starts up top with neagle or craven. I'm torn about who between them gets the start though. I think if neagle is going to perform, this is the game to do it and he knows it, especially since he's been saying he's more comfortable at forward. Which means a quick, hard working late sub in craven.  However a part of me wants craven to get the start and for him to just tear Portland a new asshole. Which means neagle sub, which means a gamble, in my mind. Hell I don't know. FUCK PORTLAND AND WIN THIS GAME, DAMNIT!!!"
SoundersFC,3bfm07,cpnAhab1,1 point,Sun Jun 28 21:47:57 2015 UTC,Looks like Fisher on the back line instead of Remick. I'm interested in who the subs are now that the Starting XI has been announced.

SoundersFC,3bgcvl,bobador1,11,Sun Jun 28 23:59:30 2015 UTC,we are easily one of the worst teams in the MLS without our main 3.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,FHlogin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:50:33 2015 UTC,No presence up top. Really missed our duo's ability to keep it in their third.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,Cazargar,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:18:54 2015 UTC,I'd say mid table at worst after looking at today's game. Plus we will be picking up Friberg again (supposedly)
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,vuduwastaken,8,Mon Jun 29 02:23:15 2015 UTC,"Hello Portland Timbers, we are the Souders defence. Follow me and I will show you to our lovely goal."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,schmeebasaur,6,Mon Jun 29 00:54:59 2015 UTC,Pineda. Rose and Azira have been terrible today.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,steerbell,3,Mon Jun 29 00:52:02 2015 UTC,Haven't been impressed with Evans on those 2 goals either.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,Cazargar,3,Mon Jun 29 00:53:44 2015 UTC,"yeah but our mids are getting over run and they are doing nothing about it.  Frankly I am done with Rose and Pineda. If we are going to stink lets stink with up and coming players and let them learn, these guys know better already and bring nothing to a competitive match."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,steerbell,2,Mon Jun 29 00:56:07 2015 UTC,It's not Evans' fault though. Fisher is pushing way up like he's the next coming of Yedlin. Except he lacks the speed to track back and doesn't even bother trying so we're left with a 3 man back line.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:59:09 2015 UTC,"That third goal was a complete lack of discipline by Evans. If you're a CB pressing up for a tackle, you better fucking making that challenge or your ass is on a stick."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,vershastri,3,Mon Jun 29 01:07:14 2015 UTC,I kinda felt like this could have happened today but why does it feel much worse?
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,Doowutchyalike20,2,Mon Jun 29 00:52:49 2015 UTC,We let Portland set the tempo for most of this match.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,MurchantofDeath,4,Mon Jun 29 00:55:59 2015 UTC,Azira is goddamned terrible. How he's still got a starting spot I have no idea.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,johnnyseattle,1 point,Mon Jun 29 00:46:34 2015 UTC,We do not have other DMs and Pineda is playing worse.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Mon Jun 29 00:59:49 2015 UTC,"Still should not be an excuse, if we are as good as we say we are, we need to find ways to win. Our lack of depth is really showing."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,FHlogin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:01:25 2015 UTC,"Okay. What do you do? How do you solve both left backs being injured one LB injured, all three DPs being out, our second-best CM, CB, and 3rd-best striker all coming back from injuries vs. basically a full-strength Portland attack?"
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,SonOfMechaMummy,-1,Mon Jun 29 01:06:58 2015 UTC,"as i said, lack of depth. its showing."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,FHlogin,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:07:30 2015 UTC,"He's not terrible. He's a strictly average MLS defensive midfielder. He looks terrible because he is playing with a roster that is used to relying on the best defensive mid in the league in Alonso, and we aren't making adjustments to give Azira the support most d-mids in MLS need."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,stealth_sloth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:15:08 2015 UTC,"I get that part, sure.  But the constant passes straight to opposing players, giveaways in our half, lazy passes that get picked off...  yeesh.  I mean, he was far from our only source of disgust today, but he was the smelliest turn in the punchbowl, if you know what I'm saying."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,johnnyseattle,0,Mon Jun 29 01:25:40 2015 UTC,I agree he's not playing well but I think he's our best option given Ozzies absence   Edit:Down voters should express why they did.
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,AirborneAquarium1,2,Mon Jun 29 00:49:57 2015 UTC,"We need to sign some decent defense. Also, fuck you Dempsey... You dick."

SoundersFC,3bgcvl,CougFanDan,3,Mon Jun 29 02:09:23 2015 UTC,"Jones, Craven, Rossi, Mansaray, basically any player who can actually develop as a result of playing time."
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,vershastri,-1,Mon Jun 29 02:14:50 2015 UTC,"You'd rather throw any of 4 rookies out there, one of whom (Rossi) isn't technically on our team, over Chad Barrett? You're crazy"
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,CougFanDan,1 point,Mon Jun 29 04:01:06 2015 UTC,Yeah. You'd rather have a half decent striker take the time away from promising young players from developing?
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,vershastri,-1,Mon Jun 29 04:07:38 2015 UTC,"I hope we see a few of our guys leave in July. cough Barrett, Azira, Rose cough"
SoundersFC,3bgcvl,vershastri,1 point,Mon Jun 29 01:11:43 2015 UTC,"Azira is the only one of those that has a chance to leave. Rose is a consistent starter, and Barrett provides much needed depth at forward, especially with Dempsey out until August"
SoundersFC,3bdktl,MowwMoww,1 point,Sun Jun 28 05:18:05 2015 UTC,This didn't get a lot of upvotes but  so glad you posted it. Please don't stop!
SoundersFC,3bbra8,trickjarrett,7,Sat Jun 27 18:29:09 2015 UTC,Really should have been an expected move.  Andy has looked pretty good in the games I've seen S2 play and we clearly need help up top.
SoundersFC,3bbra8,Veracrucis,4,Sat Jun 27 18:52:29 2015 UTC,"Between this and the Friberg rumors, I'm in a great mood after an otherwise poor week or so for the Sounders. I absolutely love what I've seen Craven doing on S2 and I just couldn't be happier to see him getting recognized for that work. My only concern is that, once Dempsey/Martins are back, will he still be able to get (meaningful) field time? I kind of assume that he'll still be spending a fair bit of time with S2, once D/M get back."
SoundersFC,3bbra8,jaschac,6,Sat Jun 27 20:32:47 2015 UTC,How will this work with the transfer window and the first team's relationship with S2? Will he be able to play against Portland?
SoundersFC,3bbra8,Aurick,2,Sat Jun 27 18:38:41 2015 UTC,Think of it as a draft signing. I don't believe transfer window rules apply in this scenario
SoundersFC,3bbra8,IInviteYouToTheParty,2,Sat Jun 27 20:20:04 2015 UTC,"It's often referred to as the ""international transfer window."" Transfer window doesn't apply to players already playing within the US."
SoundersFC,3bbra8,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:03:50 2015 UTC,If he's signed on S1 then loaned to S2 he can play for any first team matches.
SoundersFC,3bbra8,vuduwastaken,5,Sat Jun 27 19:03:07 2015 UTC,Good for him he came in and worked hard.   Plus it is good for the S2 guys to see that the first team is paying attention.
SoundersFC,3bbra8,steerbell,1 point,Sat Jun 27 18:51:12 2015 UTC,"He will be a great addition. Seen him a few times and looked quite good. Think with some playing time this season, he could be a great option for next year."

SoundersFC,3bbra8,SuperSounderHawk,2,Sat Jun 27 20:25:12 2015 UTC,I don't remember what he exactly said but I believe he said it was a draft pick signing FOR S2. My best bet is that it is GK Tyler Miller who spent some time in Germany.
SoundersFC,3bbra8,IInviteYouToTheParty,1 point,Sat Jun 27 21:24:42 2015 UTC,Is this a move because he is ready? Or because of our striker injury/suspension problem?

SoundersFC,3b8a6t,KickenTentacles,3,Fri Jun 26 20:04:09 2015 UTC,Hopefully Barrett is fit to start so we can shoot the lone striker formation into the sun. I'm sort of expecting Ozzie to come in off the bench.

SoundersFC,3b96ap,vuduwastaken,3,Sat Jun 27 00:46:05 2015 UTC,TIE YOUR SCARF
SoundersFC,3b96ap,Newmanator29,0,Sat Jun 27 12:42:13 2015 UTC,I can't emphasize this enough. I've been to my fair share of games in Portland (living down here for the past 4 years) and I've seen Timbers fans just take scarves and run.
SoundersFC,3b96ap,mikejunior211,0,Sat Jun 27 20:33:12 2015 UTC,"True Camouflage yourself, just don't wear Galaxy colors either."
SoundersFC,3b96ap,romosgotthis,0,Sat Jun 27 06:39:09 2015 UTC,"Maybe because I've never been to a Timbers game but I kind of laughed at the thought of anybody having to ""be careful"" at a Soccer game in Portland. What are they going to do, beat you up?"
SoundersFC,3b96ap,Newmanator29,5,Sat Jun 27 20:29:46 2015 UTC,"Walking through the street last season after we came back to tie the game 4-4, we were personally being yelled at, flipped off, and one guy came through and just threw shoulders at all of us. It sounds ridiculous but people are just shitty"
SoundersFC,3b96ap,romosgotthis,0,Sat Jun 27 20:34:57 2015 UTC,"Ah, yeah I figured going to any away game (especially to a rival team) is going to get you some verbal harassment. That's all part of the fun and I would expect nothing less. The physical stuff is crossing the line though and I just kind of assumed Portland was a classy enough city to not get that kind of thing from their fans.  Every time I've worn my Cowboys jersey into CenturyLink the fans give me some goodhearted crap but nobody ever even came close to touching me. I have a fond memory of of that controversial monday night game in 2004. Walking out of of the stadium I heard some drunk guy screaming FUCK ROY WILLIAMS at me from behind and then catching up with me to say ""actually though he's a really good player and I wish he was on our team. Good game!"" I laughed pretty hard. Seattle fans are classy as hell.   Fuck Portland. Fuck the Timbers."
SoundersFC,3b96ap,vuduwastaken,1 point,Sun Jun 28 08:55:49 2015 UTC,"From the ECS newsletter:  Portland pre-func:  We think this sounds like a good idea, however note that many other nearby bars are Timbers-supporter-only and will refuse access to opposing fans.  Parking:  There is no visiting supporters designated parking. Many nearby lots fill up quickly. We recommend wherever you park to avoid walking along SW Morrison St (N edge of the stadium) and SW 18th Ave (E edge of the stadium).   Stadium Arrival (Bus Riders & Match-Only Purchasers): Buses are scheduled to arrive at Providence Park at 14:00 and will be unloading along SW 20th Ave. See the attached map. AT NO TIME IS ANYONE PERMITTED TO LEAVE THE BUS/TICKET/ENTRANCE AREA. We don't want anyone getting separated from the group and winding up in trouble.  Per MLS rules, all away fans must enter as a group - this means if you drove yourself you will need to meet the buses to enter as a group. LEAVE YOURSELF PLENTY OF TIME TO PARK AND MEET THE BUS.   MATCH-ONLY PURCHASERS NEED TO MEET THE BUSES BETWEEN 13:45 AND 14:00.  We are entering at Gate 5.  Tifo:  All tifo, including personal flags and two-poles must be present for entry and inspection at 14:00. Providence Park may prevent entry of any other tifo after that time.  Water/Outside Beverages: Due to the expected high forecast, Providence Park has relaxed their rules on what can be brought into the stadium for this match.  Providence Park will allow SEALED water bottles and sports drinks as well as UNSEALED EMPTY bottles. Frozen bottles are allowed provided they are sealed.  There is a restriction on the amount allowed in - you are only allowed an amount that you could personally reasonably drink. No cases. Gallon jugs are probably pushing it. If you bring a case and you forgot to read this, you'll be sharing with others as they enter - how kind of you!  Entering the Stadium:  ECS Security and Tifo crew will go in first.   After they enter, we will all pass through security together and enter the stadium. Note that Providence Park now employs metal detector wanding.  Fans who are visibly intoxicated may be denied entry by Providence Park. Don't be that supporter, especially on a hot day. You'll doubly regret it.  ECS will be in all of section 222 and the back rows of Section 223. All seats are to be treated as GA. Other Sounders groups will be in the front of section 223 and we ask that you stay in the back of that section."

SoundersFC,3b5zzz,trickjarrett,11,Fri Jun 26 06:35:48 2015 UTC,The ball movement during his time in Seattle was beautiful to behold. I think he is a player who can give Sigi the defensive security in midfield while being able to retain possession higher up the field. Tactically and technically sound. Many were arguing that he would be a better signing than Pappa when it seemed that the team might sign one or the other. Why not have both?
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,Wineguy33,16,Fri Jun 26 07:52:21 2015 UTC,"I won't address the rest, but I think Pappa has proven his class."
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,perforce1,10,Fri Jun 26 15:26:36 2015 UTC,I just want to clone Pappa 10 times and be done with it.
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,Eff3ction,2,Fri Jun 26 15:40:40 2015 UTC,I agree. The league has improved since Friberg was here but remember that the Sounders also went on an 11 game unbeaten streak with him paired with Alonso.
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,Wineguy33,3,Fri Jun 26 20:07:27 2015 UTC,"That is a good point. I don't remember him being very physical, but honestly I will admit we do need some help in midfield, as I am unconvinced Pineda and Rose are both up to the level we need to compete in our biggest games this year(at this point the playoffs where we all know how it has gone in the past).  I also don't want to see Neagle out wide anymore(I know we will but why Sigi why??). I am excited to see if Roldan, Kovar, or Thomas can stake their claim as legit first teamers, but if the organization see's Friberg as  someone that can contribute I support it.   My previous comment was more just in regards to how my respect for Pappa has grown. I heard a lot of bad things from Chicago Fire fans, and had my doubts his 1st season here. But he has really taken on a leadership role in my opinion, not to mention his technical quality and flair that can only be matched by Oba and Deuce in the current squad.  Oh yeah, btw please Soccer Gods, let us smite Portland this weekend!!"

SoundersFC,3b5zzz,ViewASCII,10,Mon Jun 29 03:12:04 2015 UTC,Friberg was a great passer and a smart offensive player but holy cow.  How many mids do we need?  If the last few games have taught us anything it's how thin we are in the back and up top.
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,newbachu,6,Fri Jun 26 13:56:33 2015 UTC,Freiburg coming in basically puts him at the top of the midfield depth chart only behind Alonso.
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,vershastri,3,Fri Jun 26 18:24:52 2015 UTC,Playing next to Ozzie. Pineda will go to the bench and Friberg will start.
SoundersFC,3b5zzz,john_mcrotten,2,Fri Jun 26 20:23:54 2015 UTC,"Well, looking at our 4/2/3/1 or 4/5/1 lineups, it's clear we need more. The kids are good, but they aren't starting quality yet, Roldan and Kovar show promise, but they aren't going to win us games yet."

Also, there were rumors about us signing him last year. Sounds like this was inevitable and just a matter of time."
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,Aurick,7,Thu Jun 25 23:19:04 2015 UTC,"UPDATE: There was a transfer rumor a few days ago about Erik Friberg returning to the US.  This would stand to make sense. Offers us further depth at CM, technically proficient, only even left in the first place because of family reasons. READY THE TACO GIFS.

SoundersFC,3b4q8q,TweetsInCommentsBot,6,Fri Jun 26 05:23:33 2015 UTC,"This may seem ignorant, but this is my first season following MLS and the wonderful Seattle Sounders. Are MLS teams able to sign players any time during the year?"
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,alexj757,6,Fri Jun 26 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"We can sign someone now, but he couldn't technically join until the summer transfer window, which starts July 8th."
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,Schwa142,3,Fri Jun 26 02:45:52 2015 UTC,Then why was Thomas able to join?
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,alexj757,6,Fri Jun 26 02:48:25 2015 UTC,Thomas was signed before the closing of the primary transfer window (Feb-May). Secondary window opens in July as stated.
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,chazz4444,2,Fri Jun 26 02:52:32 2015 UTC,How did you hear about Thomas that early then out of curiosity?
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,alexj757,6,Fri Jun 26 03:01:48 2015 UTC,"Rumors started in April  https://twitter.com/chazz4444/status/590752525177004033  His International transfer certificate must have been signed sealed and delivered to MLS HQ by the May 12th deadline. Otherwise, he would have waited till the July window.   We didn't get an official signing until weeks later (June 1st) when he finally got his work visa issue sorted, which included a trip to Italy and back. Either way since we had our paperwork in on time to MLS, then he was eligible to play immediately."

SoundersFC,3b4q8q,Schwa142,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:58:29 2015 UTC,Thomas was able to join because his paperwork had been filed before the deadline. I'm assuming visa stuff kept him from joining the team until afterwards
SoundersFC,3b4q8q,IInviteYouToTheParty,5,Fri Jun 26 05:50:23 2015 UTC,"We can sign players at any time. But we can't necessarily play them immediately, depending on when we sign them.  The ""roster freeze"" is September 15th this year. So if Seattle finalized a deal for some player on October 10th, he could move here and start training with the team, but couldn't actually play for us until the 2016 season.  If a player is already in MLS with another team, we can trade for him at any time before the roster freeze and start playing him. If a player was already playing in the US, or has never signed professionally before, same deal.  If a player is under contract with a foreign team, we can work out a transfer deal with them whenever. But we can't play the guy until one of the two transfer windows open. That would be February 18 - May 12, or July 8 - August 6. If we complete a deal with a European club on June 10th, we can't actually play the guy until July 8th. Note that sometimes a deal is settled and the ITC requested before the transfer window closes, but because of paperwork or other issues the player isn't actually available until later (e.g., Thomas this year).  If a player is a free agent, and has been ever since the last transfer window closed, we can play him immediately. If he's a free agent, but was under contract when our transfer window closed, we can't play him until our transfer window re-opens.  Also, the league in extreme circumstances is willing to overlook the roster freeze - if a team gets their top two goalkeepers badly injured in October, they can petition the league to let them sign and play a new goalkeeper."

We could get the announcement for this 1st team signing as soon as next week.   The signed draft pick will likely go to S2"

SoundersFC,3b3w9q,cougsandhawks,37,Thu Jun 25 19:29:02 2015 UTC,Nothing like being suspended for longer than Suarez whose high profile bite set a disciplinary precedent for all lower leagues. Ripping a card is much worse than physical/biological assault /s.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,doge_doodle,14,Thu Jun 25 19:45:41 2015 UTC,Well the Suarez incident seemed to be a one off thing. He didn't have any sort of prior history of similar or otherwise violent offenses. /s
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,wunwuncrush,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:56:48 2015 UTC,I suppose I now have to admit I don't know much about Dempsey's past.  Has he done this before...?
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,samfreez,6,Thu Jun 25 23:37:07 2015 UTC,"Nah nothing like this that I know of.  I was referring to Suarez, who has been caught on camera biting opponents twice before the World Cup, and that was still the extent of his punishment."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,wunwuncrush,2,Fri Jun 26 00:03:29 2015 UTC,"Oh duh.  I can read, honest.  lol  But yea, the Suarez/Dempsey comparison is just absolutely mental to me.  It's so far out of whack, especially given that the league knew this Ref's propensity for handing out deranged numbers of cards, yet still started him.  The Sounders apparently even asked the league for a new Ref, but were denied.  I say fuck the Open Cup, personally.  Bullshit officiating has no place in a tournament like that (or anywhere really) and this Ref is the equivalent of the cop who hands out tickets for jaywalking on a back country road with nary a crossing in sight."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,samfreez,1 point,Fri Jun 26 00:08:44 2015 UTC,Which offense are you referring to?  Suarez had prior history of biting  in past matches in English and Dutch leagues.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Fizzl3,16,Fri Jun 26 14:39:11 2015 UTC,So he could have literally head-butted an official for exact same sentence...?
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Schwa142,3,Thu Jun 25 20:44:09 2015 UTC,"Nah, head-butting an official wouldn't have gotten him an MLS suspension to go with it, just a $7500 fine from the league."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,stealth_sloth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:44:20 2015 UTC,"True that for MLS.   I don't remember if it mentioned it in the link, but Blanco also punched a Fire player in the stomach and poked him in the eye...  Completely acceptable since it wasn't a ref."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Schwa142,5,Fri Jun 26 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Depending on how the Sounders do in upcoming years, this might be the end of Dempsey in the USOC."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,xopherg,6,Thu Jun 25 19:32:21 2015 UTC,"I read in the comments in the article that the Sounders actually knew about that Ref's history, and specifically requested a different one, but were told no.  Any idea if that's true?"
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,samfreez,4,Thu Jun 25 23:43:00 2015 UTC,"Yeah, SounderAtHeart had an article about it a week ago or so. Prior to that game, the ref had ejected 10 players in 10 matches as center ref; it's now 13 in 11. He's also been fairly yellow-happy (something like 6-7 yellows per match average)."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,stealth_sloth,5,Thu Jun 25 23:46:43 2015 UTC,"Whelp, fuck the Open Cup then.  I vote the Sounders never go back, out of contempt for that governing body's shoddy management."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,samfreez,7,Thu Jun 25 23:51:19 2015 UTC,They better outright ban any player from now on who actually assaults a ref. I think a ban for one year/tournament would have been enough.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,KickenTentacles,4,Thu Jun 25 21:16:34 2015 UTC,"Blanco literally head-butted an official (but, not a ref) for exact same sentence..."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Schwa142,7,Thu Jun 25 21:21:08 2015 UTC,"Loan him to S2 for a couple of years, let him ""be suspended"" for their first couple of rounds against amateur teams. Then bring him back up to the senior team after he gets his six games/two years"
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,CougFanDan,20,Fri Jun 26 00:29:31 2015 UTC,Fine. As long as that ref is suspended from reffing an MLS level team for the same period.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,never-enough-hops,10,Thu Jun 25 19:38:45 2015 UTC,"Not the ref's fault. He's a newbie, still getting his footing.   It's on USSF for putting him there."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Soundurr,6,Thu Jun 25 21:46:44 2015 UTC,"The ref should definitely be suspended for letting it get to this point in the first place, he honestly had no reason to be reffing this game in the first place after his last match that featured two mls teams."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,BugSTi,2,Thu Jun 25 19:41:11 2015 UTC,"To be fair, that was in 2011, so it took 4 years for him to do it again after last time."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,clickmyface,7,Thu Jun 25 19:42:34 2015 UTC,"That's a potential 10 game ban since we enter in the 4th round. 13 game ban? Yeah....  Edit: Oh, even better, it's potentially up to 6 years if we never make it out of USOC Round 4. He could be banned from a cup tournament for 6 years and that is an absolute joke of an organization.    Due to the suspension, Dempsey cannot play in any U.S. Open Cup matches in 2016 or 2017, and possibly longer depending on the number of tournament games in which Dempsey’s team participates in those years."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Gingersarus,2,Thu Jun 25 19:57:22 2015 UTC,I thought it was 6 game or two years whichever comes first. Is there something I'm missing where he could be out for 6 years?
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,UpsetAsianBear,3,Thu Jun 25 21:28:26 2015 UTC,"Actually it is whichever takes longer. So a minimum 2 year suspension, and if it takes longer than two years to play 6 games, that's how long he is suspended."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Gingersarus,1 point,Thu Jun 25 21:35:22 2015 UTC,"Oh wow, I guess l my brain just assumed it was whichever comes first. That's ridiculous, a minimum of two years for ripping up a piece of paper sets a dangerous precedent, as most people would see it as relatively benign compared to players bumping, pushing and or threatening the ref (which seems to happen somewhat frequently)."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,clickmyface,1 point,Thu Jun 25 22:48:17 2015 UTC,"Indeed. MLS teams enter in the 4th round and it's knockout. That means we we get a minimum one USOC game per year and if we lose thats it. Since it's whichever is longer, longer in that case would be 6 years, not 2 years."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Gingersarus,2,Thu Jun 25 21:47:26 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, that makes sense, my brain just read it as maximum but it clearly says minimum, thanks for the clarification."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,nikdahl,5,Thu Jun 25 22:49:44 2015 UTC,"I suggest we skip USOC for a couple years.   It's not worth it anymore. And if USSF isn't going to take it seriously (as in, send legit refs), then what's the use? They need us more than we need them. Fuck em. Let S2 make a run at it if they want."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,ChvyVele,3,Thu Jun 25 22:47:59 2015 UTC,It's a CCL spot for winning just 5 games. That's worth it.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,vuduwastaken,5,Thu Jun 25 23:21:37 2015 UTC,Definitely
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,nikdahl,1 point,Thu Jun 25 23:43:49 2015 UTC,"I would agree, but those games and travel come at a price, and during the MLS regular season. It's an elimination tournament, which means some of these guys are on the field for 120 minutes, and are expected to come back to Clink to play that weekend.  Let's not forget that there are 3 other CCL berths available, all of which become more likely for us if we forgo the 1 berth that comes from USOC This is debatable of course, but the travel, injuries, fatigue and suspensions that comes from participating in the USOC has a very real effect on our MLS regular season. The other berths are MLS Cup winner, and the two division winners. If any of those three are a Canadian team, then the team with the next best regular season record gets it. If the winner of the USOC also qualifies in any of those spots, then the team with the next best regular seasons record gets it. If the MLS Cup winner was also the SS winner (or division winner), then the team with the next best regular season takes it.  That's a lot of chances for a berth."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,k_princess,2,Fri Jun 26 18:19:38 2015 UTC,The only problem with skipping a couple of years is that Dempsey's suspension will hold until he is on the team for 6 games that his team (if for some reason he goes to another MLS team) plays.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,Digita1B0y,1 point,Fri Jun 26 03:07:08 2015 UTC,Word to this.The MLS refs already piss me off with how bad they can be. The USSF should never have sent a newb to a match of this caliber. I would not be sad to see it go. We'll still have the Concacaf.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,my_lucid_nightmare,4,Fri Jun 26 08:56:24 2015 UTC,Wow.  We helped increase interest in the USOC.  We took it as seriously as did any club.  And this is the thanks we get.

SoundersFC,3b3w9q,newbachu,2,Thu Jun 25 19:33:38 2015 UTC,I'm sure Clint is really going to miss those Tuesday night games against the Railhawks.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,JonnoN,3,Fri Jun 26 14:03:35 2015 UTC,time for Sounders FC to stop wasting time and energy on this joke of a tourney.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,xopherg,3,Thu Jun 25 21:00:55 2015 UTC,I think ignoring the USOC forever is also too harsh a penalty. It can be a good tournament if USSF will get their shit together. No more fly by night cable networks with broadcasting exclusives. No more half trained refs. Stop pitting bitter rivals against each other in the first knockout round.  This tournament should be as fun as March Madness.
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,immortaldual,7,Fri Jun 26 00:13:19 2015 UTC,"No matter how out of line Dempsey was, the whole match proved that the USOC is more trouble than it's worth. It's very possible that it cost us our season."
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,vuduwastaken,2,Thu Jun 25 22:20:02 2015 UTC,cost us the season how? We can still win the MLS Cup
SoundersFC,3b3w9q,immortaldual,3,Thu Jun 25 23:43:36 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right we could totally still take the Cup. But we have already lost 6 points and I'm not nearly as confident going into Sundays match which could cost us another 3. 6 points, potentially 9, is nothing to scoff at. Looking at the shield we're now down by 5 trailing D.C. which is a fairly significant advantage given our playoffs track record. And well within striking distance of the other 4 teams above the red in the west. Do I think we won't make the cut? No, I am confident that we'll hang out above the line until the end. Are we in a much worse position? Yes undoubtedly. We can still do it but with Oba and Barret being injured, Dempsey and Brad having National duty in the Gold Cup, we're going to have a rough next couple months.

Given his national team duties, MLS and CCL, I think it is likely time that his workload is managed a little more closely. USOC is the logical first place cut his minutes. It sucks it had to happen like this but in reality it's not a huge difference from what have might happened anyway."

SoundersFC,3b0rgk,reeseallen,7,Thu Jun 25 01:19:45 2015 UTC,"ITT people are surprised that Seattle lose on the road while missing every single DP, their back up striker, their two starting center backs, starting RB, and having to play what is normally their two outside mids centrally as a striker and CAM.  We didn't lose this game because Neagle was a lone striker. We lost this game because we are depleted and it's hard to win on the road in MLS."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,Copernican,3,Thu Jun 25 18:28:09 2015 UTC,He also came in having played 4 full games including 120min USOC. Dead legs + out of position + a lineup without veterans = not enjoyable.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,clickmyface,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"Plus Neagle was one of our few starters out there, making it easier for Philly to focus on him when normally there would have been other big names in the area to split defensive focus."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,Aurick,6,Thu Jun 25 19:19:37 2015 UTC,"It seemed to me that like the first team, possession was the name of the game. Problem is even with a true striker you can still lose 1 nil to a pk or a well placed corner. WITHOUT a true striker I don't see how that game plan pays off. I trust sigi but this is moving right on passed questionable. Start Jones or ANYONE even rose as a CAM and that game looks different. I get we're resting up and had a decent shot at 1 pt and improving to a decently healthy team against a Portland team that's high in the west. But without ozzie or a strong MF the lone striker is hard to justify at absolute best."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,foxpawz,4,Thu Jun 25 01:32:11 2015 UTC,"This the third time this season that Sigi has tried 4-2-3-1, with the 1 being Neagle, and it has yielded ZERO GOALS. Come ON, Sigi. You can't win if you can't even score one goal.  Jones looked dangerous today in the limited time he had available. What if we had put him out front from the first minute in a much more familiar 4-4-2 formation?"
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,Wineguy33,1 point,Thu Jun 25 05:47:19 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,clickmyface,1 point,Thu Jun 25 09:14:05 2015 UTC,"in a much more familiar 4-4-2 formation   Familiar to whom? As Sigi pointed out, this lineup didn't even get practice time together. No formation is familiar to these guys because they haven't played together.   Who would you have liked to see up front yesterday in 4-4-2?"
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,clickmyface,1 point,Thu Jun 25 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"Fair point on the familiarity of the lineup.  I would have liked to see Jones and Neagle up front. Actually, Jones and Roldan up front being supported by the midfield combo of Pineda, Pappa, and Neagle could have been really interesting."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,PeperonyNChease,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:01:03 2015 UTC,I'm not against that prospect this weekend against portland. Lamar will have played 460 minutes in the last month by the time we get there so I actually am not sure he should/will start.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,lojer,0,Thu Jun 25 20:06:36 2015 UTC,"Agreed. After the last game it should be obvious that Neagle doesn't play well as a lone striker. It also didn't help that Sigi waited until the game was out of hand to make any adjustments. With so many players out, it would have been the perfect time to let Jones or Mansaray start and get some experience. Hopefully Barrett can start the next game and bring some spark to this depleted offense."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vershastri,2,Thu Jun 25 05:41:32 2015 UTC,This thread is similar to wondering why the Seahawks would start BJ Daniels with Russ holding out and Tavaris injured.  Oh and the whole LoB would have to be suspended too.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,DavidGrizzly,2,Thu Jun 25 17:19:36 2015 UTC,"I've been calling for people to hop on the Jones bandwagon for weeks now. Today we just got a glimpse.

SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vuduwastaken,1 point,Thu Jun 25 06:11:26 2015 UTC,i am 100% with you on this. the last two games i have been like why in the fuck is Darwin Jones not playing from the start.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,my_lucid_nightmare,0,Thu Jun 25 07:35:51 2015 UTC,Why doesn't Darwin start? Great question. I think his post match interview gives a little insight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaxXWgE2Q3Q  It sounds like he's just a little too junior to be making the start.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vuduwastaken,1 point,Thu Jun 25 10:47:09 2015 UTC,"Well, I'm all for not busting a guys confidence but, really, if the alternative is 0 goals using Neagle what do we have to lose?"
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,my_lucid_nightmare,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:46:29 2015 UTC,"I don't think it's a confidence issue; I think it's a matter of he would do EVEN less than Neagle. Now in my opinion, I think it would be good to see 2 up top or run a 4-3-3 with Pappa on the left wing and someone else on the right. But Sigi has much more experience at gauging talent than any of us here. He repeatedly says during the interview that we have 4 strikers. Doesn't even mention DJ or VM."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vuduwastaken,2,Thu Jun 25 13:48:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with your reasoning, and I am glad that Sigi has this vision to keep to it even when it looks for all the world like there's other options.  When Jones came on, Philly immediately went on the back foot and we started looking dangerous.    I'm sure there's good reasons why this wouldn't have worked in minute 1 rather than in minute 70."
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vershastri,1 point,Thu Jun 25 13:55:24 2015 UTC,"I mean, I'm all for seeing Jones play, but the coaches clearly think that Neagle is a better option right now..."

SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vershastri,1 point,Thu Jun 25 14:32:05 2015 UTC,Finally plays? He's good. As evidenced by his hat trick in S2. But that's against USL defense. Will he be as good against an MLS side? Sigi obviously doesn't think so. If he premiers in 3 months maybe he will have improved enough by then. I don't think we'll see a bunch on the first team for him anytime soon.
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vuduwastaken,1 point,Thu Jun 25 15:10:57 2015 UTC,Sigi is the same person that has continued to start Neagle at ST.

SoundersFC,3b0rgk,vuduwastaken,0,Thu Jun 25 15:34:39 2015 UTC,"Oh I don't know, maybe the only other pure target forward on our fucking team named Darwin Jones?"
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,jjspacer,0,Thu Jun 25 16:48:55 2015 UTC,He's not ready or Sigi would MENTION him on his list of strikers. Did you even watch the interview?
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,benfreilich,1 point,Thu Jun 25 16:59:17 2015 UTC,I would prefer dual strikers up top but it feels that when we play 4-2-3-1 we play not to lose. I would love to see rossi on the sounders first team during this rough patch
SoundersFC,3b0rgk,my_lucid_nightmare,-7,Sat Jun 27 06:28:35 2015 UTC,Pathetic. Any 12 year old that plays FIFA could make a better formation. I hope Dempsey feels like shit.

SoundersFC,3b0p2e,MowwMoww,17,Thu Jun 25 00:59:55 2015 UTC,I never thought I'd be so desperate to see Chad Barrett in the starting lineup.
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,wunwuncrush,12,Thu Jun 25 01:07:00 2015 UTC,"Frei motm, that's about all I can say right now."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,foxpawz,18,Thu Jun 25 01:09:25 2015 UTC,"I am so damn let down over Neagle. A local kid, showing promise and scoring for his hometown team in the first couple of seasons, now a shadow of himself. I get it he's got a lot of pressure being the lone striker up top, but there was some rec league plays he pulled out there. Touch was awful and looked lost half the time. I hope he can turn himself back around.   Also, Sigi with that Marshall sub"
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,Skuby_Duby_Du,9,Thu Jun 25 01:02:17 2015 UTC,"Extremely disappointing result. As entertaining as it was seeing Marshall at forward, it was very much a ""Eh, it's only Philly, fuck it"" attitude. And while I know it's hard having Oba and Deuce out, those are 3 points they have to have against the worst team in MLS."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,btener412,6,Thu Jun 25 01:06:54 2015 UTC,"So, how are we going to survive the next month? Oba out for injury, Clint out for the Gold Cup and Barrett with unknown match fitness."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,SvanirePerish,7,Thu Jun 25 02:27:26 2015 UTC,"Fisher was wide open many times on the right, but the team didn't find him. I know crosses are low percentage play, especially with a loan striker like Neagle, but nothing else we were trying in the box was working.  I think I would've liked to have seen Jones get the start (assuming he is fit enough). EJ surely helped him out with his runs to split defenders and beat the offside trap. I can't wait to see him put the fear of god into backlines that like to push high.  Stefan Frei is beasting, and I love it."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,metameh,2,Thu Jun 25 01:05:09 2015 UTC,I think he isn't getting the start because he is much less experienced than Neagle.
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,vuduwastaken,6,Thu Jun 25 11:11:21 2015 UTC,Hunting for a silver lining...  Uh... Jones looked good?
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,stealth_sloth,6,Thu Jun 25 01:02:55 2015 UTC,"Did he? He ran fast, sure...."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,clickmyface,3,Thu Jun 25 01:05:03 2015 UTC,"Muscled a couple Union players off the ball. Put himself in good positions. Made a few interceptions. His passing and teamwork could have been a little sharper, and obviously we all wish he'd buried that fast break at the end. But for a young player in his first professional season, it's promising stuff."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,stealth_sloth,4,Thu Jun 25 01:06:09 2015 UTC,"Neagle was crap. I like the guy, but he should never be a lone striker. He plays better with someone supporting him. Speaking of which, we really needed Barrett today.   Frei was amazing - he keeps getting better.  I'm disappointed it took Sigi so long to make any adjustments. The team looked completely out of sync at times and we had absolutely no threat on offense."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,PeperonyNChease,3,Thu Jun 25 01:24:42 2015 UTC,"This hurts.  It feels like we've given up 6 free points in the past two games.  Not much Sigi can do, I know, but painful anyway.  Fisher was garbage in the 1st half, decent in the 2nd. Jones looked fast but not great other than that.  Ockford...well, hopefully that doesn't happen again.  Neagle continues to prove that he's garbage without defenses worrying about Dempsey and/or Martins.  Frei, thankfully, is a beast."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,whiskeydrone,3,Thu Jun 25 01:11:54 2015 UTC,So someone who watches S2...does Kovar normally play like that? I was underwhelmed with his performance. I know he has a killer cross and did a decent job tracking back but his decision making and ability to keep the ball this game seemed bad. Are those normal tendencies or just an off night?
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,overruns,2,Thu Jun 25 05:05:58 2015 UTC,Kovar plays pretty well in S2 in my opinion
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,vuduwastaken,1 point,Thu Jun 25 11:17:13 2015 UTC,"He did not have a good game. Between that absolutely terrible flop to just flattening that Union player, just not a great look"
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,Deathsquid,1 point,Thu Jun 25 19:31:08 2015 UTC,"I've been a big believer in Kovar for years. Even in the academy, I thought he had a higher ceiling than Yedlin. But each game he gets in MLS he continues to let down.  I don't know what it is, he's looked good or S2, he looked good in the friendly vs. TJ, but when the pressure is on, he seems to fade."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,ravegreener,1 point,Thu Jun 25 20:33:47 2015 UTC,It's hard to judge because Kovar's biggest strength is crossing into the box and Seattle is not playing with men in the box right now. I can't say whether he does or doesnt track back often because it's not really his role to do so when we have two defensive midfielders in the game.
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,Doowutchyalike20,2,Thu Jun 25 05:16:33 2015 UTC,I could have used some cliff notes on our starting line-up.
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,BugSTi,9,Thu Jun 25 01:02:59 2015 UTC,1/2 S2 + 1/2 Sounders = that
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,GSShenanigans,2,Thu Jun 25 01:35:16 2015 UTC,"That was a tough game to watch.  Personally I think Garza and Craven should get a first team call up. Craven up top with Jones. They both play really well together. Neagle could slide back to midfield, with Garza instead of Azira.  Something needs to be done with our attacking line up. Neagle is just not working up front"
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,Audicity,2,Thu Jun 25 14:53:34 2015 UTC,"Apparently no one could make passes to save their lives.  First touches? Right.  I know this roster is our most inexperienced starting lineup we've started, but that was a bit embarrassing to watch.  EDIT: The only player I really was happy with was Frei. Jesus fuck, this is such a different GK from last year. Frei is my man of the match. The lone goal was on the defense for falling asleep."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,stealth_sloth,11,Thu Jun 25 01:00:47 2015 UTC,Fisher didn't look good? I thought he was the best player on the field other than Frei.
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,stealth_sloth,1 point,Thu Jun 25 01:07:26 2015 UTC,"Fisher looked great as long as he was at least 25 yards from the goals. He got flat-out beaten 1v1 several times in our end (almost with painful consequences), and at their end his crossing never really threatened. On the other hand, I thought he did a nice job recognizing and moving into space, his first touch was generally good, he showed composure and good decision-making on the ball, and his work rate was excellent.  Sort of a mixed bag in my opinion.  Kovar, on the other hand, needs to spend more time with S2. This was not a good showing for him at all."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,vuduwastaken,3,Thu Jun 25 01:28:12 2015 UTC,Sometimes I wonder if people are even watching the matches.
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,bjdm151,2,Thu Jun 25 01:32:26 2015 UTC,"Not sure what part of this you disagree with.  Fisher was 0/4 for crosses; none of them found a Sounders player (I think 0/4; one of them might have been a really bad shot instead, I'm still not sure which he intended). This despite being given plentiful space on the win on several occasions.  Fisher did get the worse of several 1v1 situations defensively. E.g., the game-winning goal started with a cross from our right wing; Fisher stood off his man and watched the cross sail past him. Frei had to come out and make a sliding stop early in the first half when Fisher mis-read a ball's flight. Those were the two most glaring, but not the only instances.  Fisher's touch was generally good. It wasn't perfect, but he rarely ran into trouble because of a bad first touch. He often was able to clean up a long bouncing cross and direct it into space immediately, rather than killing the play waiting for his second.  Fisher was smart with the ball. He rarely played a ball to a teammate under too much pressure to work it out, did a good job deciding when to move forward vs. when to reset and work it back around, didn't linger on the ball too long under pressure but also refused to be rushed into a premature and unsafe pass. I suspect he had around an 80% pass completion rate, and the ones he didn't complete didn't burn us.  Fisher was highly active at both ends of the field. He frequently got forward to join our attack, but I never saw him lingering up there while Philadelphia countered; he worked hard to get up and back.  Regarding Kovar... he proved unable to play a dangerous or disruptive pass in the run of play. We had a beautiful 3v2 opportunity around the 70th minute, and under no pressure at all he over-struck his pass to Neagle leaving him with a nasty ball to clean up. Yes, a player like Martins or Dempsey might have scored anyways, but on the other hand a better-weighted pass would have made it easy even for Neagle. On several occasions Kovar did well to find a seam in the defense with space and the ball at his feet, but he almost invariably lingered on it too long when that happened. He rarely lost the ball, but his play was typically damaging to our attack - extra touches on the ball, followed by a backwards pass that forced us to reset. He was also notably unsuccessful on the dribble - he tried on multiple occasions, but never got anywhere with it.  Defensively, Kovar was one of the players that Philadelphia were specifically targeting to exploit on set pieces and they had a fair amount of success at it. They were often able to simply muscle him out of the way of an incoming cross or throw-in. And on a couple occasions he didn't provide Remick with much-needed support against an overload.  So... what match were you watching, that didn't have any of this?"
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,bjdm151,3,Thu Jun 25 02:01:02 2015 UTC,"Fisher was 0/4 for crosses; none of them found a Sounders player (I think 0/4; one of them might have been a really bad shot instead, I'm still not sure which he intended). This despite being given plentiful space on the win on several occasions.   When was the last time we scored off a cross? This isn't a crossing team. Like I said, it's going to be impossible for people like Mears, Fisher, and Kovar to really shine when the strikers are less than 6 feet tall and we're playing a lone striker up top. Neagle is never going to get on the end of crosses. It isn't his game. That's completely ignoring the fact that crosses aren't even factored into passing statistics by Opta because they aren't really passes, they're 50/50 balls in the box.   Fisher did get the worse of several 1v1 situations defensively. E.g., the game-winning goal started with a cross from our right wing; Fisher stood off his man and watched the cross sail past him. Frei had to come out and make a sliding stop early in the first half when Fisher mis-read a ball's flight. Those were the two most glaring, but not the only instances.   Fisher allowed a harmless cross from the right side, correct. It definitely didn't lead to the goal. They were two separate instances and crosses. The goal was entirely the fault of Scott and Ockford for falling asleep in the box and not marking Sapong at all.   The second half of the game he made a lot of recoveries and tackles to stop counter attacks. Completely ignoring his successful plays in and bringing up one or two mistakes that led to harmless crosses is silly. Fisher was at fault for 0 goals and was the best defender on the field. That might not be saying much because the only other defender on the field with substantial experience is Scott, and he isn't great.  His greatest attribute this game was 1 on 1 defending, so I don't know what you're getting that from. Only one successful dribble was recorded as beating Fisher this game, and it during the 70th minute when someone played the cross into the box.  Again, people are pointing blame at Fisher for absolutely no reason. He was a huge upside, not even remotely close to a downside this match.   Regarding Kovar... he proved unable to play a dangerous or disruptive pass in the run of play. We had a beautiful 3v2 opportunity around the 70th minute, and under no pressure at all he over-struck his pass to Neagle leaving him with a nasty ball to clean up. Yes, a player like Martins or Dempsey might have scored anyways, but on the other hand a better-weighted pass would have made it easy even for Neagle.    That is absolutely not what happened. I've seen multiple people say this now and im dumbfounded. I don't know if you guys know what happens in soccer or not but that's just simply false. Here is a clip of what happened. Kovar plays in a fantastic pass to Neagle who simply fails to control it. It's one of the simplest balls you'll see in professional soccer and he simply kicks it wide. To fault the passer for a player failing to control the ball is flawed logic.   To me it sounds like you're blindly ignoring what happened to defend Neagle, which I see way too much around here.   On several occasions Kovar did well to find a seam in the defense with space and the ball at his feet, but he almost invariably lingered on it too long when that happened. He rarely lost the ball, but his play was typically damaging to our attack - extra touches on the ball, followed by a backwards pass that forced us to reset. He was also notably unsuccessful on the dribble - he tried on multiple occasions, but never got anywhere with it.   Like I said above, would you rather he crossed the ball into an empty box and turn it over? Seattle doesn't play that style. Completely ignoring the style of play and faulting the players that don't fit that scheme is strange. It'd be like putting Eddie Johnson on 2011/2012 Barcelona and expecting him to do well with tiki-taka. It isn't his game and never has been.    Defensively, Kovar was one of the players that Philadelphia were specifically targeting to exploit on set pieces and they had a fair amount of success at it. They were often able to simply muscle him out of the way of an incoming cross or throw-in. And on a couple occasions he didn't provide Remick with much-needed support against an overload.   I mean, that's fair. But if you're expecting a left winger to be a solid defender then you're bonkers.    So... what match were you watching, that didn't have any of this?   The match that happened tonight. I'd watch it again if I were you to be honest. Doesn't seem like many people watched it closely enough."
SoundersFC,3b0p2e,steerbell,2,Thu Jun 25 02:18:58 2015 UTC,I didn't watch the match but I just watched the clip you posted. To me it looks like Neagle stretched to control and missed but Kovar's pass was a tiny bit ahead. I'd say neither really takes all the blame.

Chad Marshall played a target forward, that was entertaining.   That was a gross as I was expecting when I saw the lineup. Hey, 3 rookies. Still, it was an incredibly busy week and I would rather beat Portland. Chancers are Oba or Clint would have missed this mid-week anyway because of the last 5 games in such a short time."

SoundersFC,3avrgp,canetrumpet,3,Wed Jun 24 03:28:36 2015 UTC,Then prepare to be pissed. It is possible (but unlikely) that Oba is back but the only way Evans and Dempsey are in the lineup is if the US doesn't make it out of the group stage.

Made of thinner material, and has all of the detail Adidas talks about at the unveiling.   The replica, is similar, with thicker material, and is usually missing some minor details like inside collar coloring or ""holographic"" graphics.   99% of people couldn't tell the difference, so it comes to preference and price."

SoundersFC,3avfa8,jjspacer,2,Tue Jun 23 22:15:45 2015 UTC,"I agree, rest everyone.  I don't care about this game, save up for the best lineup we can for Portland."
SoundersFC,3avfa8,Jesuslookalike,2,Tue Jun 23 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"If we're going to play a B-team and start Scott, I'd rest Marshall rather than Evans. Think about what happens if Marshall gets injured against Philadelphia. Suddenly, we could be looking at having no Martins, no Dempsey, no Marshall, and no Evans... until late July or August. That's the sort of situation that could lead to us setting a franchise record for consecutive losses."

He needs to work on his defensive abilities, but he's clearly got the desire to make plays.    I chuckled when he passed the ball forward and straight off the corner of the field, then promptly face-palmed.. but it was an understandable oops borne of a lack of gelling with the team.  That'll change, and quickly.  I have high hopes for Thomas, and I really can't wait to see what he's like in another few months or so, once he's had a good amount of time to sync up with the rest of the team."
SoundersFC,3apm2p,samfreez,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:04:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at times he doesn't appear to be on the same page with his teammates.

We need to remember he's still really young and these things take time."
SoundersFC,3apm2p,CascadiaKid,3,Mon Jun 22 23:04:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think he did that well in either of the games he's played, not that its unsurprising this early. He certainly loves to dribble through people, which is nice, but he lets the ball get too far away from himself and hasn't had much to show for his moments of brilliance. I want him to succeed, but I don't know how patient I can be when we need our depth to get results during this stretch.  Overall, I'm glad we signed him, but I really hope his transfer fee didn't wipe away a huge chunk of our allocation money."
SoundersFC,3apm2p,enigmamr,2,Mon Jun 22 18:58:15 2015 UTC,"I agree with the comments that he seemed to make some good moves , but suffered from miscommunication with teammates. I am sure part of it was he is still integrating and I am sure there might be a little of a language barrier as well."

We also have Jones and Mansaray, and soon probably Morris too. It's Sigi's choice if he doesnt want to play them and run a 4-5-1, which based off yesterday's result was a mistake."
SoundersFC,3anwm2,thegodsarepleased,1 point,Mon Jun 22 01:43:38 2015 UTC,"this x 100.... The 4-5-1 was a failure from the start, midfield was way too clogged and putting Lamar up top all alone was a bad choice. We should've made the change at half but instead we brought in Scott for Evans and I don't think we went to a 4-4-2 until there were 10 minutes left."
SoundersFC,3anwm2,KDFilm,4,Mon Jun 22 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"I think he's probably thinking we played 4 games in 2 weeks against a side that played 1 game in two weeks and we were missing all our DPs. Nobody in MLS is going to do well with all 3DPs and 3 total strikers out. That's not really a contingency you can expect or afford to plan for. With that said, Lamar wasn't really our issue on Saturday."
SoundersFC,3anwm2,clickmyface,2,Mon Jun 22 03:14:12 2015 UTC,"Probably not Cooper specifically, but I'm sure he wouldn't mind having another skilled striker available. Some of his recent comments suggest that he doesn't have a lot of faith in the current incarnations of the younger guys like Mansarray and Jones.   Personally, I've been loving watching Craven in S2. Effective and fun to watch. I'd love to see him get some first-team opportunities."
SoundersFC,3anwm2,jaschac,2,Mon Jun 22 01:47:57 2015 UTC,Can Craven play on the 1st team? I thought that they had to be signed to the 1st team to be able to play. But anyone from the 1st team can play on S2?  Someone please correct me if I am wrong.
SoundersFC,3anwm2,BugSTi,2,Mon Jun 22 04:06:48 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think he can play for the 1st right now, I was mostly thinking in general and/or for the future. But I can dream...i can dream...  :)"
SoundersFC,3anwm2,jaschac,1 point,Mon Jun 22 04:26:27 2015 UTC,Gotcha. I have to admit that the thought crossed my mind last week before the SJ game...
SoundersFC,3anwm2,BugSTi,2,Mon Jun 22 04:32:42 2015 UTC,He would have to be signed to the MLS Sounders. Another player would probably need to be loaned for the rest of the season to S2 or another team in order for a roster spot to get free. It's not impossible.
SoundersFC,3anwm2,Wineguy33,1 point,Mon Jun 22 06:48:51 2015 UTC,"The other thing no one else mentioned was money. Cooper was expensive, and it's entirely possible we wouldn't have been able to bring in Thomas or another player if we hadn't let him go."
SoundersFC,3anwm2,tdubthatsme,1 point,Mon Jun 22 09:18:36 2015 UTC,With Barrett out we have no other experienced players in that position. I really hope he can start next week because Neagle can't do it alone. I'm thinking our next signing should be another forward to provide some depth – Dempsey and Martins can't be around all the time.
SoundersFC,3anwm2,PeperonyNChease,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"i think the point that i more-so was trying to provide was our lack of experienced depth. Yes, we have all of these amazing S2 players, but other than that, we have no experienced players. I, personally, would rather play an older, more experienced ST than a youthful, inexperienced player."
SoundersFC,3anwm2,Jack2142,1 point,Mon Jun 22 15:58:18 2015 UTC,"The problem against San Jose was the result of the lineup and I don't think Cooper would have solved it. Seattle has used a 4-4-2 for quite awhile, and for the last year has relied on a playmaker by committee with Dempsey, Martins, Pappa and Pineda at times all acting as a playmaker at times. Against San Jose we struggled because we were relying on Pappa to carry the creative burden solo, and relying on Neagle to lead the line solo, when he has never really done that he is a competent forward, but needs someone to play off of. I think a Neagle/Barrett combo or a Neagle/Jones combo might work if our defense remains good, especially if Pineda returns so Pappa isn't our sole playmaker on the field."
SoundersFC,3aqm05,ckb614,15,Mon Jun 22 18:37:50 2015 UTC,"Because it's one of the qualifiers for the CONCACAF Champions League, the most important and prestigious tournament in the region"
SoundersFC,3aqm05,CougFanDan,2,Mon Jun 22 18:50:41 2015 UTC,Did not know this. Thanks
SoundersFC,3aqm05,enigmamr,21,Mon Jun 22 18:56:43 2015 UTC,Because I expect my team to compete for every major piece of silverware and compete in champions league.
SoundersFC,3aqm05,SonOfMechaMummy,6,Mon Jun 22 18:42:28 2015 UTC,"Because I straight-up don't want us to be the LA Galaxy or the subsection of their fans who have the unrelentingly boring mindset that literally only the MLS Cup matters (it used to be the Shield too, but then we beat them for it last year).  The US Open Cup is the oldest tournament in the country, the tournament that every pro and semi-pro team gets a shot at. It's a great venue for squad depth usually, and the end result of taking the Cup seriously has been multiple CCL appearances which a) makes us more appealing as a destination for players and b) has resulted in some of our most impressive games (1-0 at Monterrey, 3-2 vs. Tigres). Just because it was an unmitigated disaster this year doesn't rob it of its value."
SoundersFC,3aqm05,SonOfMechaMummy,-1,Mon Jun 22 19:54:17 2015 UTC,"International competitions like concacaf make sense to me, but I thought MLS tried to present itself as the biggest and best the US has to offer. You don't see professional teams playing amateur teams in any other sport. Even in the USOC it seems like we play our B team half the time and they play in a stadium big enough for a high school team."
SoundersFC,3aqm05,IGetNoSlack,7,Mon Jun 22 19:58:48 2015 UTC,"You don't see professional teams playing amateur teams in any other sport.   but this isn't any other sport. It's soccer, and in domestic tournaments part of the fun and appeal is the off-chance of lower league/amateur teams making a real run. See Crawley Town making it far enough in the 2010/2011 FA Cup to play Manchester United, or Bradford City upsetting Arsenal in the League Cup a couple years ago. Hell, see the Timbers getting beaten by Cal FC in their own stadium a couple years ago.  And there's nothing wrong with a competition that allows young players and depth players the opportunity to shine."
SoundersFC,3aqm05,francostine,5,Mon Jun 22 20:31:28 2015 UTC,"And this is why the other North American sports can't have nice things.  The MLS Cup is not the only tournament that matters. The US Open Cup gives lower division teams the opportunity to play the top teams in the country. For them, it's a chance to show themselves on the big stage; for us, we might actually field younger players and give them playing time.   And it's the same thing with international play. Win USOC, get CCL berth, play some of the the best teams in the world. In fact, I'd argue that domestic cups are a win for all involved because somebody gets shown what football is like at a higher level, and that should be a motivating factor."

I have always felt though (and feel free to disagree), that the MLS teams normally field a ""B"" squad for it... and that's ok with me because of situations like this year. I feel it's a better tournament to develop young talent instead of losing players like Oba and Dempsey for a few weeks. Maybe I'm still bitter..."

SoundersFC,3aq9dn,TweetsInCommentsBot,-4,Thu Jun 25 23:16:48 2015 UTC,"I am not worried about how he looks to other professionals.  It is bigger than that.  I think he needs to remember that whether or not he likes it, he is a role model for many youth soccer players in Seattle and around the country.  He could do something as brief as apologizing to his fans for the example he set, and reminding youth players to be courteous in victory and defeat.  He would not have to admit any specifics and poison his appeal.  His silence is low class and reflects poorly on Sounders FC and Seattle. Everyone wearing a uniform needs to remember that their behavior reflects on themselves as well as the city/country on the shirt.  You lose your ability to be selfish when you play a team sport."
SoundersFC,3aq9dn,wargh_gmr,6,Mon Jun 22 22:52:07 2015 UTC,"I don't buy it. Athletes are not obligated to embrace their role model nature. Should Richard Sherman apologize for talking trash and insulting Crabtree? Should Robbie Keane apologize for using the middle finger on national television? It's their choice. I for one am happy sports figures are all different and some embrace their good boy role and some embrace their bad boy role. Nobody should be forced to be someone who they're not, just to get acceptance from a public who has their own sometimes jaded opinions on what good and bad behavior is and how others should act."

They are paid by the sponsors and teams and as long as they keep a marketable image, good or bad they will be paid.  But, there is a limit and fans will walk away and the money will dry up. People try but you can't stand center stage and yell don't look at me. It should be an unwritten rule, but character is in the contract of all team sports and for individual sponsorships. You do sign away the right to be an ass, especially if you represent a city or a nation on a team."

[...] You do sign away the right to be an ass.   I'm sorry but that is laughable at best. I don't see how you could be more wrong.  See: Richard Sherman, Marshawn Lynch, Muhammed Ali, Michael Jordan, Alex Rodriguez, Milan Lucic, Hope Solo, Ben Roethlisberger, Luis Suarez, Floyd Mayweather, Babe Ruth, and I could go on forever.  Like I said, athletes are not obligated to embrace their role model nature, nor would I want them to. We don't need more hypocrisy in the world."
SoundersFC,3aq9dn,dintclempsey,2,Tue Jun 23 07:37:46 2015 UTC,"What do you think you are proving? I already said athletes can be dicks. Your examples show how much it sticks out when they are. They should not be, and especially when they are on a national team. And it can only go on for so long before teams won't sign you and fans won't buy your gear. Fans have to demand more from the people who represent them.   Anyways Sherman is a good guy and gives back to his community."
SoundersFC,3aq9dn,wargh_gmr,0,Tue Jun 23 12:29:02 2015 UTC,"What do you think you are proving?    That you're very, very, very wrong?   They should not be, and especially when they are on a national team.    Says who? You? So Charles Barkley and Michael Jordan shouldn't have been in the USA Olympic basketball team because you think every athlete should be squeaky clean and not have the freedom to be who they are? That's absurd.   it can only go on for so long before teams won't sign you and fans won't buy your gear.    Could you be any more wrong? Did you not read what I posted? Did people stop buying Barkley/Jordan/Lynch/Roethlisberger/Suarez/Lucic/Ruth/Solo/Rooney merchandise? No. Not at all. Not even close. You're absolutely out of your mind.   Anyways Sherman is a good guy and gives back to his community.   There are many asshole rapist criminal sports figures who give back to their community. That doesn't make you a good role model and you should really learn to be a little less hypocritical. If Richard Sherman was on a different team you'd be all over him about what a bad role model he is for kids, and how he should apologize for his terrible behavior on national TV.  Again, athletes should not be forced to embrace their role model status and put on a hypocritical mask just to please puritanical nannies who want to dictate others' behaviors. They should be allowed to be themselves. They're paid to perform on the field, not to be ambassadors of goodwill."

SoundersFC,3alhsg,mitama,6,Sun Jun 21 18:29:26 2015 UTC,"Generally I have found that the club seats sit for the vast majority of the game. I have heard, but have never seen confirmation that you are supposed to not stand for extended stretches in that section.  Another thought: I would think that the handicapped seating sections would have a good view from the seated position considering that standing up would not be an option for someone in a wheelchair. Perhaps you could contact the ticketing office, tell them your situation and get one in one of the seats next to the wheelchair areas (I think I have seen some up in the 300).  If you look around you can generally find seats somewhere in the front of a section for any given game too on resale (row A in 300 would be the easiest usually). If you get lucky the club seats behind the tunnels are great in that no one below can obstruct your view and you can just stay seated if you so desire."
SoundersFC,3alhsg,itypedvorak,3,Sun Jun 21 14:17:07 2015 UTC,I think I am going to try and get seats in the first row! Thanks for the advice!

SoundersFC,3alhsg,john_mcrotten,2,Mon Jun 22 02:35:33 2015 UTC,"People in 200 and 300 seats do stand up for kickoff and goals typically, but in my experience they then sit down pretty quickly. If going from sitting to standing is as difficult as long periods standing, you might have trouble seeing some key moments in the game. I think front rows and handicap sections are great suggestions."

SoundersFC,3alhsg,radeky,7,Sun Jun 21 14:08:42 2015 UTC,Have you tried getting a seat in the handicap area? I don't know what kind of requirements they have to use that area.
SoundersFC,3alhsg,kingofspain131,8,Sun Jun 21 15:37:48 2015 UTC,I think not being able to stand for 45 minutes constitutes a handicap. I'm sure that would work.
SoundersFC,3alhsg,Brandt_cant_watch,2,Sun Jun 21 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"Club level seats are much calmer.  We stand for kickoff and exciting moments, but are otherwise sitting.  You also have the handicap seats at the top of the 200 level, which are assuredly sitting down.  I think a front row seat in the 200 level would work pretty well for you, if the handicap sections in the back aren't an option."
SoundersFC,3alhsg,suegenerous,3,Sun Jun 28 15:47:33 2015 UTC,First of all thank you so much for asking where the best place for you to sit is. Ive had people try to get 10+ people and I to sit down because they couldn't stand the whole time. It makes your experience less enjoyable and it does the same to others around you.   Call the ticket office and explain the situation. Id recommend handicap seating or club level. Club level is 99.8% sitting from my experiences.  Hope the next time you go to a match you can enjoy it as much as possible!

Kovar got the ball (good pass to set him up, whoever hit it); he pushed up the wing past his defender. It's not just that somehow our outside midfielder got in front of everyone else and had nobody in the box to hit it to. It's also that there was nobody within fifteen yards of the box for his cross. It didn't even look like there was anyone who thought they were supposed to be in the box. It was Kovar vs. 5 San Jose players, at a time when we were down late and should have been aggressively committing numbers forward looking for an equalizer."

Neagle was garbage up top but that's not entirely his fault. 1 man up front doesn't work with this team, especially when the man up top is a midfielder.   I was really confused by the subs. Neagle stayed in the entire match for some reason and Jones or Mansaray should have been subbed in at striker 30 minutes earlier in my opinion.  Still though, when you're missing 4 of your best players it sucks."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,SplooshFC,4,Sat Jun 20 22:04:33 2015 UTC,"The subs were odd, like why so early. Thomas had steam left honestly and he and Pappa were creative on the flanks.   I would have pulled Jones over Mansaray, he has more of a quality attack, and that's what we needed."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Schwa142,2,Sat Jun 20 22:13:54 2015 UTC,"Evans had a groin injury and Rose was getting a tight hamstring...  Sigh didn't seem too impressed by Thomás, so he tossed Mansaray in."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,2,Sun Jun 21 00:11:30 2015 UTC,"I think Thomas getting the yellow was part of the reason he was subbed out. Didn't want to chance going down a man, yet again."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,stealth_sloth,2,Sun Jun 21 02:11:47 2015 UTC,Kovar had already started warming up to replace Thomas even before that yellow card though. It was pretty obviously a pre-planned 60th-minute substitution.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,2,Sun Jun 21 05:59:13 2015 UTC,I hadn't noticed that. I'm in the NW corner so player warmups are hard to see. But i can understand why he was the first* sub.  *not counting Brad's injury sub
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,BugSTi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 06:52:19 2015 UTC,"He was also getting frustrated, and he was getting too physical. If the yellow was tactical like Scott's, he would have been left in."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,hhdslater,3,Sun Jun 21 17:33:15 2015 UTC,"I don't care what anyone says, I'm very sick of Neagle and I don't know why Sigi loves him so much. He's mediocre and extremely hot and cold. Really wish Jordan Morris could just replace him already."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,steerbell,14,Sat Jun 20 22:29:17 2015 UTC,because he isn't bad and he is relatively cheap. You need guys like him in MLS. They can't all make millions.

SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,2,Sun Jun 21 00:08:20 2015 UTC,"He is much better with a strike partner. I prefer him coming off the bench in the long term, though."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Jack2142,7,Sun Jun 21 02:13:14 2015 UTC,"Disappointing loss, but an understandable one. Seattle and San Jose both had players missing, but San Jose stepped up and did what needed to be done. They have really had our number these last couple of seasons. I wonder what will happen when Wondo is called up to the Gold Cup though.   Complaining every loss about Ref's I don't think is constructive and just looks bad. We got outplayed and I think that has more to do with our lineup and formation than being hard done by the ref's who I felt did fine and San Jose had plenty of clear fouls called."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,SplooshFC,0,Sat Jun 20 22:30:16 2015 UTC,"We did get out played but there were some clear could that went the wrong way. Those set peices could have turned the tide, again ""could of""."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Jack2142,5,Sat Jun 20 22:39:31 2015 UTC,"Oh of course but every game has those fouls that get wrongly called, but it happens and thats not why we lost in my opinion. I think it is San Jose steps up for big games and our lineup.   We were missing alot of players, trying to use Neagle as a solo striker (bad) and bringing in a new guy in Thomas in who looked pretty good at times, but suffered from miscommunication."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,johnnyseattle,7,Sat Jun 20 22:48:39 2015 UTC,"We have to be the worst team on this continent at set pieces. It's an absolute waste of our time not taking every corner short at this point, as we mostly have a team full of midgets currently. Send it up around the top of the box and let Pappa/Neagle unload.   And FFS, get Darwin in the goddamned game. If you're going to play a lone striker, the guy doing it should probably be a striker.  All in all a very flaccid performance. The football equivalent of trying to shoot pool with a rope."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,hhdslater,4,Sun Jun 21 00:30:49 2015 UTC,"Not the most heartbreaking of losses considering everything that's been going on. Just kinda pissed that San Jose seems to really know how to break us down, which is a bit infuriating. Especially since it's happened twice at home this season. They deserved it though, we played like shit."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Skuby_Duby_Du,9,Sat Jun 20 22:28:13 2015 UTC,"Before anybody gets too upset, remember we only had 5 of our normal starters on the field at the end of the day.   As a side point, Michael Azira to me is crazy interesting - when it comes to defense, he's pretty on point; intercepting passes and making solid tackles. But his vision, passing, and offensive mindedness (?) are quite poor. He'll get the ball and it's almost like you can see him thinking for three seconds and going ""Ok, I got the ball. What do I do with it? Oh yeah pass.""   He's definitely coming along but needs some work."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,BugSTi,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:08:53 2015 UTC,"Thanks for putting into words what I couldn't. I was impressed at some of the challenges that he came away with the ball, but I did see that ""oh crap, now what?"" look you mentioned."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Schwa142,4,Sun Jun 21 17:37:07 2015 UTC,In the post game show they said Pappa was really sick and almost didn't play...  He played well for being that sick.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,joylongdivision,2,Sun Jun 21 00:16:53 2015 UTC,Watching the interviews right now and Sigi also said that Pappa was pretty sick. I think there were just a dozen problems with the players today.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,clickmyface,4,Sun Jun 21 00:45:43 2015 UTC,"Remick kinda sucked. First goal was a hell of a finish but he got sucked too central and basically left Nyassi wide open. I'd still like to see Leo start against Portland.   Otherwise, I was impressed with Roldan, and Azira was pretty good. I feel like Azira gets a bad rap because he's nowhere near Ozzie, but for what we're paying him I think we could do much much worse."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Schwa142,8,Sun Jun 21 02:41:25 2015 UTC,"I wasnt remotely shocked by this one. 4 games in 2 weeks vs. Quakes with 1 game in 2 weeks. All our DPs gone, Oba, Clint, and Chad B gone, Evans out the second half. I expected to slot at least one in but the Quakes took advantage and ripped us apart. Not worried yet.   Edit: was really proud of Azira today, he showed up and seemed to feed off the energy from the USOC game. Rose was the only other guy that really stood out for me."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,6,Sat Jun 20 22:26:35 2015 UTC,"With Azira getting Ozzie's minutes, he's been improving a good bit..."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,stealth_sloth,4,Sun Jun 21 00:13:16 2015 UTC,"Agree on Azira. Thought he was our MOTM, though no one really gave him a challenge for that today."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,SonOfMechaMummy,3,Sat Jun 20 23:08:09 2015 UTC,Fuuuuuuuck
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Aurick,2,Sat Jun 20 22:09:16 2015 UTC,Subbing Mansaray instead of Jones was frustrating to me. He's young and has the tools to develop but IMO he's not even one of the better players on S2 right now. If only we could bring Craven and Rossi in as emergency depth right now...
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,scyth3s,2,Sat Jun 20 22:53:03 2015 UTC,"I know we were missing players, and I know we're tired from running a busy schedule, but I really wish at some point, at least by the half, that we would have realized there was a reason San Jose was letting us make all those crosses, and had stopped falling into that trap."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,vershastri,1 point,Sat Jun 20 23:27:55 2015 UTC,Right? We got on the end of like 3 crosses all game.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,buttstuff2k15,4,Mon Jun 22 00:36:51 2015 UTC,"Two things: If you blame the refs for every loss, stop. Second: Did anyone except for me notice how much Roldan worked today? Directing Rose, Remick, Azira and Evans to name a few, and running everywhere trying to make plays. I'm absolutely shocked people think Azira was our MOTM. Roldan worked his ass off to try and create chances.  Note: Neagle and Remick were complete shit today. Remick was standing offside when that second goal went in. I know he was helping the attack, but at least get a man to cover your spot if you move up. And Neagle, well... He had that one decent chance in the first half but aside from that he's just not a good player."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,RADMFunsworth,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"Sigi shares your sentiments, stating that Roldan and Azira played excellent today."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:46:10 2015 UTC,I don't think that people are blaming the loss on the ref. That doesn't mean we can't be critical of his performance. There were several times where he made some inconsistent decisions which was simply frustrating to watch.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,_Anthropophobiac_,3,Sun Jun 21 02:39:13 2015 UTC,Azira looked good. Pretty much no one else really did. Really not impressed by Mansaray's minutes today. Where is Jones in that situation?
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,vershastri,6,Sat Jun 20 22:02:10 2015 UTC,"Thomas looked good, if somewhat disjointed - he obviously wasn't quite clicking with the rest of our team, with multiple instances of miscommunication, but he did well individually. Given that he's joining us midseason I'm willing to be a little patient waiting for the teamwork and coordination."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,PappyPoobah,3,Sat Jun 20 22:22:06 2015 UTC,"Kovar showed good hustle, but you're right, pretty poor showing from most everyone. I understand some of these guys are second and third string players, but still, you hope to see some of these young guys step up and do something."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,vershastri,2,Sat Jun 20 22:04:15 2015 UTC,"Jones was on the bench, I'm shocked Sigi put Mansaray in over Jones when a pure target forward was needed. Terrible choice.   You really think Roldan didn't look good today?"
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,PappyPoobah,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:09:53 2015 UTC,Roldan was invisible. And apparently Jones has been awful in practice so Sigi may not rate him enough to put him in over neagle.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,bwc_28,1 point,Sun Jun 21 01:04:22 2015 UTC,"Sorry man, I don't think we watched the same game. You may not have noticed it, but Roldan was one of the few players adamantly communicating on the field. And what's your source on Jones' performance? I don't believe that"
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,RADMFunsworth,0,Sun Jun 21 01:29:19 2015 UTC,"Communicating, yes, but he was rarely on ball and didn't impress when he did have it. And one of my friends trains with the first team."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,0,Sun Jun 21 03:20:37 2015 UTC,"Azira looked good.   Something I never thought I'd hear. I thought he was shit, as usual. His positional sense is terrible and his ""challenge,"" or lack-thereof, led to the second goal."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,bwc_28,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:58:24 2015 UTC,"Ya, it shocked me to say it. I'll qualify it with the fact that he looked good defensively only. I've got no love for him usually."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,1 point,Sun Jun 21 07:26:35 2015 UTC,"Azira was our best player on the pitch. That was Rose with the bad ""challenge"" that lead to the second goal. Azira was behind the play and shouldn't have been expected to make a play."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,bwc_28,-1,Sat Jun 20 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"Azira was following the play doing absolutely nothing and literally throws his hands up and lets the guy run right by him, before belatedly deciding to run after him in the box. He was complete crap today, as he is every game. It is truly mind boggling that anyone could possibly say he was our best player today. This wasn't his worst game, but in no way was he our best."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,0,Sat Jun 20 23:39:34 2015 UTC,He was behind the player. He had the option to commit a foul in a dangerous area or let your defense do their thing. He chose correctly and unfortunately the D didn't stop him. To say he played like crap today is just plain wrong.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,bwc_28,-1,Sun Jun 21 00:13:29 2015 UTC,"To say he played like crap today is just plain wrong.   He was constantly out of position, so even if you excuse his terrible play on that goal he was still crap. Btw even the announcers were saying he should have taken the tactical yellow instead of doing nothing at all and letting the attacker walk in on goal. Continue downvoting because you disagree though."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,canucknuckles,-1,Sun Jun 21 00:35:05 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the game? Every midfielder moved around wildly. There was no consistency for any of them. We were in a formation we aren't used to so he was basically covering for Roldan and Rose when they disappeared up the field. He also did well going forward when given the chance, IMO. Overall it was a shit match but his play stood out to me as the best today.   And yes, I'm down-voting you because I disagree. That's kinda the point of up/down voting."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,SplooshFC,0,Sun Jun 21 01:15:15 2015 UTC,"If you think Azira was better than Cristian you obviously didn't watch the game. I also enjoy that you just admitted that our entire midfield wasn't any good today. Considering Frei did everything he could but was hung out to dry by our defense, that automatically makes him better than Azira who was, in your own words, inconsistent.   And yes, I'm down-voting you because I disagree. That's kinda the point of up/down voting.   And that goes against this subreddit's rules (DO NOT downvote posts or comments simply because disagree with their opinion), so no, that's not the point of this up/down button."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,vershastri,0,Sun Jun 21 01:36:56 2015 UTC,"Roldan was far better in the middle today than on the wing. He should never be on the wing. He is too slow to beat anyone for a long ball and he is too weak to play the ball along the sideline. He was the second best player on the pitch. Frei was good as usual but didn't get tested enough.  I said Azira was the best of the bunch, not perfect. Ya, there were inconsistencies because of the formation, lack of attack, and slip ups in defense. He filled in very well for Ozzie today, as he has many times in the past. He has also had shit games (USOC on Tuesday). Today wasn't one of them. Sigi even said Azira was excellent in his post-game speech.  And people up-vote when they agree with someone or like something so to down-vote when they disagree or don't like it is normal."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,bwc_28,4,Sun Jun 21 02:07:25 2015 UTC,Azira was impressive to me today. Quality play. I think if we did a 5 man with him and Ozzie. Using Martins as our striker with Dempsey as his CAM and Pappa and Neagle/Thomas that'd be sexy.  Also known as what my FIFA squad looks like.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,vershastri,-4,Sat Jun 20 22:33:46 2015 UTC,"Azira was complete ass. He was supposed to play a holding mid role, was out of position for a majority of the game"
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,swg1324,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"He's always out of position, I've never seen a professional player with so little positional sense who gets these sorts of minutes. It's one of my few gripes with Sigi."

SoundersFC,3ajsj2,Audicity,1 point,Sun Jun 21 00:39:52 2015 UTC,First half was okay but second was sloppy. What pissed me off was the movement off the ball. The attacking players did an alright job on cutting passing options but the midfield and defense had poor positioning. There was a lot of stop and watch then realize they were out of position. Just all around lazy.

These next 3-6 weeks will be hard. However, looking on the brighter side it will actually be kind of interesting to see how we will change our strategy and how we will play next. We need to give Jones more time for sure. I just hope our players haven't lost some of their confidence since we don't have our best which could be another side effect of that mother fucking US open cup game."
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,philwelch,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:52:41 2015 UTC,"I feel that we watched some terrible officiating this past week. I may be biased but it really seemed like there were absolutely no fouls on SJ players (sans the yellow), all of them were on us.   Also I'm really worried about the next week.. this is going to be a rough match up.  We need to play smart, and maybe not waste our subs so damn early.   Oh well, on to next week."

SoundersFC,3ajsj2,scyth3s,6,Sat Jun 20 22:08:20 2015 UTC,The one at the end was offside from Roldan.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,mattfromseattle,1 point,Sat Jun 20 22:10:48 2015 UTC,Was the other offide as well? Didn't have a good view of that.
SoundersFC,3ajsj2,fragbot,2,Sat Jun 20 22:51:08 2015 UTC,They called a questionable foul on Azira before the shot was taken. The commentators agreed that most ref's wouldn't have called it. That being said the keeper could have saved that shot fairly easily if the whistle hadn't been blown beforehand.

SoundersFC,3aja7i,thegodsarepleased,3,Sat Jun 20 21:21:12 2015 UTC,We should have started with Darwin Jones and Victor Mansaray in a 4-4-2. We aren't going to get anything with one lone striker who isn't even a striker.
SoundersFC,3aja7i,SvanirePerish,2,Sat Jun 20 21:34:03 2015 UTC,"I feel the only way to beat the earthquakes is to have a non shit ref that can control the game, so we're screwed."

SoundersFC,3ajya5,SonOfMechaMummy,13,Sat Jun 20 22:55:09 2015 UTC,Azira  Picked SJ's pocket many times. Distributed well. Was still getting forward in the 90'.
SoundersFC,3ajya5,coopernurse,3,Sun Jun 21 00:21:57 2015 UTC,"He managed to get the ball away in so many 1v2 challenges, it was reassuring to see. They looked sloppy, but at the end when he came out with the ball, I was impressed"
SoundersFC,3ajya5,BugSTi,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:23:33 2015 UTC,"Should have challenged a lot harder in the lead up to the second goal, but he is by no means the only one to blame for the goal."
SoundersFC,3ajya5,DrunkenRedditMan,6,Sun Jun 21 08:42:09 2015 UTC,Azira.  He did exactly what we needed him to do.  He held the midfield and distributed well.
SoundersFC,3ajya5,Looorney,1 point,Sun Jun 21 04:53:18 2015 UTC,"Marshall or Azira. Without either one, it would have been 5-0"
SoundersFC,3ajya5,samfreez,0,Sat Jun 20 23:26:45 2015 UTC,"Cristian, despite being offside on the late called off goal he was strong all day. Not a good performance from the team all around so it's hard to pick an individual, but I feel he was marginally better. And I'm sorry but Azira has no place in the discussion, out of position constantly as usual. He makes himself work so much harder than he has to by constantly being out of position then having to run to where he should have been in the first place."
SoundersFC,3ajya5,bwc_28,2,Sun Jun 21 00:41:03 2015 UTC,The one thing I picked up that Roldan was doing today was the way he was communicating in the midfield. He was constantly pointing and calling out stuff. That along with his movement seemed to take up defenders time...maybe I'm wrong though I don't have the best eye for that stuff.
SoundersFC,3aixc1,cokacokacoh,5,Sat Jun 20 17:13:12 2015 UTC,LET'S ALL STAND NAKED IN THE MIDDLE OF PIONEER SQUARE
SoundersFC,3aixc1,FreeRoaminEmreCan,2,Sat Jun 20 18:55:18 2015 UTC,I studied abroad in Germany and before Every Hamburger HSV game we would make our way down the Reeperbahn and hit up the Döner Kebab stand. If you've never had Döner it is a Turkish street food and it is fantastic. Now that I am in Seattle my pregame ritual is to meet up and eat Döner at The Berliner in pioneer square drink a liter of Paulaner and then march to the match. It is the best Döner I have ever found outside of Germany. Go Sounders the more the merrier.
SoundersFC,3aixc1,seahawker12,2,Sat Jun 20 17:53:59 2015 UTC,"As a St. Pauli fan, I cannot condone your support of HSV...but seriously, that sounds awesome."
SoundersFC,3aixc1,HMARS,1 point,Sat Jun 20 20:12:10 2015 UTC,"Damn, I love the Berliner! Döner is fantastic! It's lamb and beef slow roasted on a vertical rotisserie. They mix it with cabbage, cucumbers tomatoes, and then their house sauce. If anyone goes I'd recommend the Fiery Kreutzberg that's my favorite. Go early though because they frequently run out of lamb/beef."

The train didn't run for yesterdays match.  It also WILL NOT be running for the Friday July 3rd match against DC (8pm),  The Sunday Aug 16th (2pm) match against Orlando, or the Saturday Sept 5th (7pm) match against Toronto.  ALL of the other remaining matches are scheduled to be Sounder train covered.    I know it's a little weird but this year they didn't maintain their normal routine of only running it for afternoon matches (those with start times between noon and 2pm).  I'm not complaining though.  We got coverage for 10 matches which is a LOT better than previous years."

SoundersFC,3afl0t,SonOfMechaMummy,29,Fri Jun 19 18:58:21 2015 UTC,"I think this is an appropriate amount.  All the people who thought he would get 3 months really didn't understand the intent of the wording for that rule that may or may not have even applied to Dempsey.  The property it mentioned is the uniform and personal property like cars.  Not a piece of paper.  Dempsey tore up the cards to directly show what he thought of the officiating because that paper was a direct representation of the referees.  Honestly, I still think the whole thing is great.  I love having a passionate player like Dempsey, but I also completely agree that he needs to be suspended for three games."
SoundersFC,3afl0t,Hops_and_Hips,9,Fri Jun 19 19:32:50 2015 UTC,Worth.
SoundersFC,3afl0t,MowwMoww,14,Fri Jun 19 19:48:04 2015 UTC,I feel like im taking crazy pills. People are saying he should be cut from the national team and suspended multiple months? This is fucking ridiculous.

SoundersFC,3afl0t,bwc_28,17,Fri Jun 19 21:08:44 2015 UTC,"Considering Jermaine Jones got zero supplementary discipline for shoving a ref this is patently absurd. This was outside MLS play, was not violent conduct, and yet gets more punishment than a player physically attacking a referee during league play. MLS has absolutely no clue what they're doing...  Gold cup and open cup agmes should have been the only punishment, this is stupid."
SoundersFC,3afl0t,Chuurp,11,Fri Jun 19 19:33:48 2015 UTC,"I think this is reasonable. He was aggressive and extremely disrespectful toward an official. I still think it's hilarious and kind of awesome given the circumstances, but you can't not punish players for that.    Now, all the people who got caught up in the whole, ""they need to make an example of him because this got media attention!"" thing are being ridiculous. There is now way on Earth this is close to the same level as assaulting an official."
SoundersFC,3afl0t,bwc_28,6,Fri Jun 19 20:21:17 2015 UTC,"I completely agree that he deserved punishment. But based on MLS precedence he should not have been suspended for league matches, just cup matches."

You can't strike them, but angry players bump chests with and pull shoulders of officials all the time.  I think the game would be better if players couldn't treat officials in this way, but that's been the standard for a long time."
SoundersFC,3afl0t,StumbleBees,1 point,Fri Jun 19 22:39:52 2015 UTC,I don't get your point. In your MLB example the playet bumped the ref and got a 1 game suspension. Dempsy didn't even address or touch the official and got 3 games.
SoundersFC,3afl0t,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,1 point,Sat Jun 20 03:21:23 2015 UTC,His point is they shouldn't be allowed to touch the referee at all like is the rule in every other sports league.
SoundersFC,3afl0t,StumbleBees,0,Sat Jun 20 04:15:21 2015 UTC,"He  didn't touch the ref. Sooooo...  People throwing around ""assault"" and ""destroying property"" are pretty far out there."

SoundersFC,3afl0t,mattfromseattle,1 point,Fri Jun 19 18:59:00 2015 UTC,"I think MLS had their hands tied because there was so much noise about this online. They had to do something. We can kick the dirt all we want, but need to be grateful they didn't listen too hard to the crying for a 3 month suspension.  So he'll be back for the DC game? That's going to be a tough match.   I think we can do well against San Jose and Philly without Martins and Dempsey (I hope). Sucks all around for the Portland game tho. No real redemption until 8/30."

SoundersFC,3afl0t,Soundurr,-3,Fri Jun 19 20:05:57 2015 UTC,"Going to be honest I am very disappointed in MLS for this. I think he should have been suspended much longer. What he did is unacceptable no matter how crappy the referee was. Anyone who has ever played has had a game go down the toilet because of a bad ref but that should be no excuse to assault or (if you think the jury is out on that definition) destroy their property. Not to mention the fact that if this had been an amateur team then he would have been suspended for 3 months minimum. I think we have just set a double standard for behavior on a soccer field and it doesn't help that Dempsey is a role model for millions of young players across the US let alone those here in Seattle. What the MLS has just told them is, if you're pissed because you think the ref is screwing you over, go ahead and break his shit you'll just sit for 3 games, no biggy."
SoundersFC,3afl0t,Schwa142,2,Sat Jun 20 01:17:01 2015 UTC,"Clint can't be held to a higher bar (or lower bar) then other players just because a bunch of kids like him. The nature of discipline is that it needs to be equally applied otherwise it has no meaning. There is a double standard for amateurs and professionals that is codified by rules everyone agreed to before they started playing. A double standard has not just been set - it was around before and after this. It also makes a lot of sense - there are professional and financial consequences to Clint's actions that can't be applied to amateur. It's not MLS's job to raise anyone's kid. Some kid saw a highlight real of Clint ripping up a card. Either they're an asshole who's going to do it and not think about his MLS ban, or they're not an asshole who wouldn't do it in the first place. Should Clint hold himself to a higher bar because of his impact on kids? Yes. Should MLS? No. This was not assault. I think that's a very wide reading of the rules, not consistent with their spirit. Ripping up a notebook does not fall into the same category as damaging their car (which is referenced by example). It doesn't make sense to keep ripping up a notebook in the same category as punching, pushing or car smashing."

SoundersFC,3abzfi,PeteyNice,28,Thu Jun 18 22:27:17 2015 UTC,"This is why: People HATE ""new money"" but for some reason love and respect ""old money"". The same thing happened with this year's Stanley Cup. Over in /r/hockey, during the WCF, people were absolutely trashing the Ducks and rooting for the Blackhawks, despite the Blackhawks being an evil dynasty who have won three Cups in 6 years. For some weird reason people are threatened when a newer team breaks onto the scene and has success. The Galaxy have established themselves as winners and so people expect it, but the Sounders coming into the league and having immediate success somehow makes us less likeable."

It's this type of shit that makes us feel like saying ""well I'm sorry I support my team better than you do"" which you then interpret as an inherent sense of arrogance and entitlement across our fan bases. The only difference between us and other fan bases is that our teams have only recently become successful, so people are actually paying attention to us now. We've always been here, but now that our teams win, people think we're obnoxious, ignorant, arrogant band-wagoners. Well, to be frank, as someone who's had to deal with the Sonics being stolen, the infamous 2006 super bowl that we should have won, and a lifetime of Mariners-related woes, you can take your accusations and shove em up your dick hole.

SoundersFC,3abzfi,Jack2142,23,Fri Jun 19 03:29:35 2015 UTC,They hate us cuz they ain't us. Although things aren't so great atm.
SoundersFC,3abzfi,Asi9_42ne,15,Thu Jun 18 21:55:12 2015 UTC,"It's currently a shit storm of flair based down voting. I'm going to just not comment on things for a bit, and let some other fan base take over the ""most hated"" role."
SoundersFC,3abzfi,ravegreener,13,Thu Jun 18 21:53:45 2015 UTC,I wonder who can fill that role for you...
SoundersFC,3abzfi,Whudevs,7,Thu Jun 18 23:34:14 2015 UTC,good luck if you win the USOC!

That one time Portland was good, people got pretty sick of their fans, but then they went back to being mediocre and everyone forgot about it. You guys might be able to pull it off though. Just win enough that a few asshole fans have something to gloat about, then watch the hate flow through the minds of the weak."
SoundersFC,3abzfi,Chuurp,22,Fri Jun 19 20:34:22 2015 UTC,"I've downvoted less people in /r/MLS than I have fingers on both hands (for insults and trolls). So it's pretty disgusting when I'll see -37 for a comment with someone expressing an opinion. I think the days of /r/MLS being a good community are over. And not just for Sounders fans. NYCFC and Cosmos fans will get flairvoted for no reason, and so will Orlando and San Jose fans depending on which way the wind is blowing. Seems like half the time I comment I get a non-related yawn enducing trash talk reply. Whatever, no one likes us etc., but /r/MLS is becoming a cesspool of expansion circlejerking and pearl clutching. Sad to see really, it used to be a good place."
SoundersFC,3abzfi,thegodsarepleased,12,Fri Jun 19 01:16:30 2015 UTC,I guess this means we have officially hit the big time.

Seattle is never the loved team nationally we are ignored when we suck, or we're hated from afar, but there is never a solid groundswell of love, only grudging respect.  And if anything goes wrong the crap just flows.  ""no one likes us we don't care"" is not just an ECS verse, it's a reality of being a fan of Seattle teams.  It's better to be hated than ignored.   That means we're good."

I tend to flip back and forth.  S@H is quite often better for following tweets and fast info, but they do tend to over-moderate the board a little for foul language, both the board owners are parents, and they tend to moderate/enforce TOS a whole lot more than reddit live threads.  Language enforcement, what they think are racist comments, or just they got a hair up their ass for whatever reason.  The forum is a good one and obviously they do a great job, but .. you do have to watch your language/don't speak out like you might on reddit.  A bit more SJW there.  They have their access with the team to protect, so they're going to run a tighter ship."

We were fairly amused by it.  Given that this person gave no fucks about sports when living here.  A lot of faux hipster tribal community down there, which has the benefit of turning people into idiots for the common good.  In this case the ""good"" is hating on Seattle.    When Seattle does things, very few people think of it in a Portland context.  When Portland does things, I swear, the first thing they do is compare themselves favorably to Seattle.  I've seen this in various contexts.  Their transit is better.  They have better microbrews.  Their fans are more ""authentic.""  On and on it goes, you hear from Portland and it's to get up in your face and say how much better they are than we."

SoundersFC,3abzfi,SvanirePerish,20,Thu Jun 18 23:31:45 2015 UTC,"Even if we have the same percentage of dickwads as another fanbase, our large fanbase means we have a higher number of dickwads overall. Dickwads tend to be more vocal than the average reasonable fan, so you end up with with a disproportionate number of dickwad posts in mlssoccer article responses or in /r/MLS.   There's also the aspect that from the outside perspective, we're the new kid on the block, so this influx was very sudden and contributes to the impression that we're all new and unenlightened in the soccer world, despite the relative popularity of youth and recreational soccer in the Northwest for decades, as well as the pre-MLS history of the team.  Also: Dickwads"
SoundersFC,3abzfi,Contagion21,3,Thu Jun 18 23:48:01 2015 UTC,"Well Seattle did invent soccer.  But, yeah, you're correct.  Nobody out yonder beyond the Cascade Curtain understands that soccer here has 40 years of deep tradition, and there's been no real national narrative yet on Yedlin, Neagle, Morris and others, not to mention guys like Hahnemann and Keller all coming from here, etc.  Part of that whole ""east coast narratives laid on top of anything we do"" scenario that plays out so often.  The soccer world here is vastly still an unknown outside of the Northwest, so they assume we're all Microsoft XBOX fanboy bandwagoners."
SoundersFC,3abzfi,my_lucid_nightmare,11,Fri Jun 19 15:30:20 2015 UTC,"OK, summarizing 5 years of this same topic, Sounders and Seahawks, here it is:   There's more of us, so naturally we'll have more bandwagoners/a-holes We're an isolated city, we don't get the benefit of anyones doubt when it comes to judgments The east coast loves to fly out here then immediately start bitching about the travel lag.  I've heard that on broadcasts more times than I can remember.  Al Michaels once famously called Seattle ""Like being in South Alaska.""  He was not complimenting. We are succeeding, which breeds envy and contempt Our fanbase is cohesive and tight in a way most cities can't understand.  Our geographic isolation as well as our strong local ties makes ""12s"" in NFL and ECS / Sounders fans in MLS more likely to stand out in a crowd.  We see that as awesome support, the rest of the league can't take it and hates it.  In the NFL for instance, 12's think of themselves as ""part of the team, their job to show up and influence play.""  Seattle audiences have always in all contexts been more rowdy or more unrestrained than many cities in the USA.  We're like European audiences here.  Cue the salty tears of fans in cities who aren't. Both the Hawks and Sounders front offices are not shy about tooting their own horns or marketing themselves proudly.  Not all teams do it or do it as well or as shamelessly.  This pisses fans of loser teams off.   We dominate on-line polls.  Seattle's on line presence is vastly the largest in MLS, in NFL we're second to New England or something.  This pisses fans of other teams off. MLS only - we're an expansion team that never had an expansion phase.  We stormed the league in 2009 with the second best record in the league, and won the US Open Cup.  Fans of every other town immediately hated our success rate, which really has never stopped for long since.   Pick n choose, mix n match, collect the set, impress your friends.  We are an amazing fan base, we do things the rest of the league dreams of.  Nobody compliments us on our attendance, even though its like double anyone else's, but Orlando's pulled some great numbers and everyone loves them.  Kansas Fucking City has 20,000 and people think its amazing their support.  Nobody has anything positive to say about Seattle's 40,000+ .    We'll just have to keep being stuck in the greatest city in MLS, in the greatest stadium crowd in MLS, enjoying probably the best game-day experience in MLS.  And then watch as idiots from 3 time zones away make shit up about us to hate on.  YNYA"

SoundersFC,3a8wrm,pemmigiwhoseit,10,Thu Jun 18 04:55:49 2015 UTC,"I think virtually everyone think he deserves to be banned, but 3-6 months seems ludicrous to me. While he may have ""technically"" destroyed ""uniform"" or ""property"" the other examples in the passage are kicking, punching head butting, and damaging the ref's car. Holding ""notebook ripping"" to that same standard IMO would at best be enforcing the letter and not the spirit of the law. I think the author is reasonable suggesting a 2-4 game ban; and I personally think 3-5 would be most reasonable."
SoundersFC,3a8wrm,francostine,-7,Thu Jun 18 05:46:18 2015 UTC,"Why is soccer(and maybe baseball) the only sport where it's acceptable to crowd the ref and verbally and possibly physically abuse the referees?

I used to referee when I was younger and I got tired of the conundrum of no matter what, your call pisses off someone.

SoundersFC,3a8wrm,MowwMoww,7,Thu Jun 18 05:12:40 2015 UTC,I agree. But USSF or whatever governing body also has a responsibility to provide officials that are up to the task. Sending an inexperienced rookie to an international level dog fight and expecting all to go well is absurd.
SoundersFC,3a8wrm,joylongdivision,4,Thu Jun 18 05:09:22 2015 UTC,He's being disciplined. He got a red card and will miss next year's first match.  This isn't a big issue. He was angry at the ref as was every other player on the field at the end of the match and did something silly but nothing that deserves more than a one game suspension.
SoundersFC,3a8wrm,MowwMoww,1 point,Thu Jun 18 10:26:17 2015 UTC,"Personally, I disagree. I think ripping the ref's notebook is definitely worthy of more than one game, as it's not exactly a red under normal circumstances. 3 months is ridiculously excessive though, as I don't agree with USSF's interpretation of it being assault of a referee. I'd imagine we'll see no games in MLS because their rules are silly, and 3 or 4 on the USOC and National Team level, and I think that'd probably be fair."
SoundersFC,3a8wrm,joylongdivision,5,Thu Jun 18 16:34:47 2015 UTC,"What makes this situation worse than a one game suspension for elbowing or a two game suspension for hitting someone in the groin?

SoundersFC,3a8wrm,xopherg,2,Thu Jun 18 17:33:24 2015 UTC,"I just think the ref is off limits. Players will be players, but as soon as you start to touch the ref you should be getting some sort of punishment. As shit as that ref was, I don't think what Dempsey did was okay. Hilarious, and I kind of love him for it, but not okay.   Where I differ from pretty much everyone on /r/MLS though is in how severe I think Dempsey's infraction was. I don't think it was anywhere near Jermaine Jones shoving a ref, but it was worse than simple hands on him. Not assault, as USSF says, but still, not something they should let go either."
SoundersFC,3a8wrm,tehjimmeh,1 point,Thu Jun 18 18:41:05 2015 UTC,He was disciplined. He was ejected from the game. He will be ineligible to play in the next USOC game. He has been punished.

If we had just sucked it up, chalked it up to bad officiating and moved on it would happen again. The problem was not bad officiating, it was out of depth officiating. I blame the ref, but equal blame has to go to the organization that assigned him to this game.   By blowing up and getting lots of media coverage this will hopefully get USSF to re-evaluate how referees are assigned to USOC games. If they want fans to take it seriously, they need to take it seriously as well and that means only having the best officials. If this means that some games are on Tuesday and some on Wednesday and that it costs a little more for officials travel then so be it.  I was much more embarrassed for USSF than anyone else last night."

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,gblfxt,11,Fri Jun 19 08:25:35 2015 UTC,"Good thread.  That was one of the craziest things I've ever witnessed.  Dempsey did something rash, and we'll find out the consequences soon enough, but aside from that I think we played well.  (a) Officials were missing a LOT of calls.  Others have documented how inexperienced this crew was, and it showed in their inability to track the pace of the game.  A few random examples:   First Timbers goal came off a throw incorrectly awarded to Portland.  Leo was setting up to take the throw, so he's out of position.  Nagbe collects the ball, runs across the top of the 18 and finds Valeri, who scores. Late in the 2nd half there's a clearance from the Timbers left side, Villafana yells for the ball from the ball boy, and while he's setting to take  the throw, the cleared ball lands in bounds.  Line judge says nothing, portland gets the throw.   (b) Portland's midfield likes to dive, and this crew encouraged it, which escalated the violence  How many times were Valeri, Villafana, Fernandez, and Urruti rolling around on the ground?  Who knows?  But much of it was from marginal contact.  Simulation works best against refs that are having difficulty tracking the game.  You see the body on the ground and make assumptions about the contact.  Portland players benefited from this.  Our boys just don't go to ground as often.  (Dempsey tried once late in the game.. diving to try to draw a penalty, but didn't get it)  (c) Once it became clear that the officials weren't in control, the game unravels  Everyone was losing their minds.  We were in the south stands, right behind the Sounders bench.  Late in the game, I believe during the 7x11 period, Fernandez goes down on light contact from Rose.  Rose stands over him and says something.  Porter starts yelling at Rose.  Dutra gets up off the Sounders bench and starts screaming at Porter ""Don't talk to one of my players!""     Everyone was unhinged.  The players, the coaching staff, the crowd.  I'm proud that our boys stayed on their feet, equalized down a man, and only conceded a single goal when down 2, and then 4 men.    I'm looking forward to playing these guys 11x11 in two weeks."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,coopernurse,9,Wed Jun 17 16:39:11 2015 UTC,The rivalry was heightened last night. And I agree with your recollection of the game 110%. The refs lost control from the moment the players stepped on the field with the jerseys. Portland took full advantage of the ref's inexperience and we didn't put up with their shit.   It was the perfect combination for what ended up playing out.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,thegraduate,11,Wed Jun 17 16:45:51 2015 UTC,"I wish this game never happened. Or that it went differently, but if it never happened we wouldn't have an injured Oba and possibly in-danger-of-suspension Clint. We wouldn't have tired players going into a Western conference game on Saturday.   Overall, we didn't play that badly. We had good chances and Fisher looked good so that is promising. Sigi shouldn't have blown all three subs knowing there was the possibility of extra time."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,betacatenin,12,Wed Jun 17 15:10:45 2015 UTC,"Also, I love Clint, but he really needs to learn to control that temper sometimes. I don't mind when he gets in players' and refs' faces and stands up for himself and his teammates, but last night was crossing the line."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,betacatenin,3,Wed Jun 17 15:15:50 2015 UTC,"I was pretty shocked with how the ref handled that.  Showing the yellow first?  C'mon, Clint should have been shown a straight red immediately and the AR's probably should have come onto the field to diffuse/control things.  It almost seemed to further prove the point that the ref was in over his head by first showing the yellow then changing his mind to a red."

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,betacatenin,1 point,Thu Jun 18 05:09:12 2015 UTC,"It makes perfect sense. He didn't get a straight red, nor did he deserve one.   He got a yellow for his words, and he didn't back off and instead escalated the situation and earned a second yellow so fast it seemed like a straight red.   Both acts were minor acts of immaturity and petulance deserving of yellows. Neither deserved a red, but taken together it is reasonable."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,night_owl,23,Thu Jun 18 01:55:32 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've written.  If Dempsey gets banned for three months and Oba's injury is bad, it's going to affect everything: regular season, CCL, quest for SS.  If the Sounders collapse over the next few months, we can point to this game being the cause."

There's no way that US Soccer throws the book at Dempsey and gives him a three month ban from all competition. He'll serve a ban from US Open Cup next year, maybe for more than one game, but I'll be surprised if this carries over to MLS."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,Warvanov,17,Wed Jun 17 20:29:04 2015 UTC,If they threw a book at him he'd probably just tear it up and throw it back.

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,pete_is_writing23,2,Wed Jun 17 16:14:52 2015 UTC,"Problem is, if that rule was ever actually enforced, half the players in MLS and NASL would be suspended at the moment."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,Jdog2010,1 point,Wed Jun 17 21:45:14 2015 UTC,"I'm confused on if that affects MLS. It should take him out of Federation run events (Open Cup, USMNT) but it isn't clear whether this affects league play. Not saying this is right but knowing that it's Clint, USSF might be inclined to ""clarify"" that MLS is immune from this punishment, thus only changing the National Team."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,knightlock15,4,Wed Jun 17 16:33:59 2015 UTC,It does not affect MLS league play.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,thegraduate,0,Wed Jun 17 16:41:39 2015 UTC,"Are you sure? Because if it doesn't affect MLS play then I wouldn't really mind as much. I trust the national team can do fine without him, as they have been. But if it affects MLS play and Oba is out too... :( we're looking at one game singlehandedly costing us a LOT of points."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,betacatenin,2,Wed Jun 17 17:17:03 2015 UTC,MLS is separate from USSF. Suspensions do not carry over from one to the other unless it's a team suspension.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,thegraduate,1 point,Wed Jun 17 17:20:19 2015 UTC,In that case would MLS be able to suspend him themselves considering it wasn't a league game? Or would the sounders be able to make the decision whether or not to sit him?

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,thegraduate,-1,Wed Jun 17 17:57:48 2015 UTC,USSF has domain over USOC and MLS. So if USSF issued a ban it would apply to both USOC and MLS games. If they chose to issue it that way. Or they could say it's only against USOC games.

That being said, it's a pretty unacceptable action. The ref didn't really have much option at that point but to send him on his way. as a skc supporter, i hope he's not out for 3 months, but it wouldn't surprise me if they came down hard.     also, hope Oba gets back on the field quickly. it looked bad to me."

I'm just impressed.  As you mention, he showed defiance (and petulance), but honestly didn't do anything to hurt anyone.  Yeah, he crossed a line, but he didn't touch anyone.  The only career he ended was a 17 game old refereeing career."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,lojer,8,Wed Jun 17 18:08:13 2015 UTC,"Don't look at /r/MLS. There's a circlejerk around ""Cunt Dempsey"" like he's been unlikeable for ages now."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,MarquettePharm,8,Wed Jun 17 19:11:54 2015 UTC,Feels like more just of a reason for r/mls to hate on the Sounders as much as they can since most of them do. I'm probably not going to post in there for some time to let the circlejerk die down.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,Audicity,5,Wed Jun 17 19:56:15 2015 UTC,"When Dempsey was out of form after he signed with us, /r/MLS descended like vultures claiming that he was over the hill and would never be good again. This has been a thing with them since he signed for us at the very latest."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,SonOfMechaMummy,5,Wed Jun 17 20:36:27 2015 UTC,Losers hating winners. No worries.  We are still #1 in the league so the haters gonna' hate.

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,alexj757,9,Wed Jun 17 15:02:07 2015 UTC,"Unquestionably. And apparently Dempsey's actions hit mass media, so this game will be more widely known. Even more reason to be upset by it."

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,never-enough-hops,7,Wed Jun 17 16:23:31 2015 UTC,"At this point I only really care about Oba's injury. I've already accepted that Dempsey will probably get some ""beyond open cup"" discipline. Kinda doubt it'll be the full 3 months, but he'll get something."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,Sounderhawks,8,Wed Jun 17 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"I'm late to the party but here's how I feel about the Dempsey/Ref issue:  On one hand, he's a professional and you expect your players to respect the rules of the game and the ref. You get bad breaks from time to time and you have to deal with it.   On the other hand: This referee was way out of his league. Very few teams take USOC seriously. If USSF wants this Cup to be taken seriously by teams, they need to assign their best referees to the games, especially a rivalry like Portland vs Seattle. It's disrespectful to all of the professional players involved to put someone like him and his team out there. If I was at Clint Dempsey's level, I'd be infuriated to share the same pitch as that referee."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,BugSTi,6,Wed Jun 17 19:40:35 2015 UTC,"I've left my comments in other threads in this sub.  What they boil down to is:   Portland can have the ""glory"" of beating us 7v11. We still scored with 10v11.  We can focus on Supporters Shield, MLS cup, and CONCACAF games now.  We see Portland again in less than two weeks. Hoping for ozzie, martins, pineda, and a 6-0 blowout at Providence park."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,pinkal_peaches,5,Wed Jun 17 17:14:15 2015 UTC,"If people didn't believe this was the most real rivalry in MLS, this is definitely proof.  Bad choice for a referee. He has had very little experience being the center official, especially for a bigger match like this.  No wonder people don't respect the Open Cup."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,gramernatsi,7,Wed Jun 17 20:09:46 2015 UTC,"Personally I'm unhappy with the reffing, that should have been handled better.   I've lost a lot of respect for Dempsey, he should know better than to pull shit like that. As a captain he needs to think about what will help the team, his actions were childish and only made it more difficult to win the game and also made the entire organization look bad.   Also I'm mad about the fans that were throwing things. That is never ok. I understand the frustration and the fact that they are our rivals, but we don't do that."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,deweese3,4,Wed Jun 17 16:21:24 2015 UTC,I feel like it was just a series of unfortunate events. More concerned about Oba than anything.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,pal25,3,Wed Jun 17 15:18:33 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think every fan of every team is salivating, not because they think Dempsey did something heinously wrong, but because if he get a suspension it gives everyone else a chance to catch up.  Apparently I'm the only one who thought it was hilarious. If a point of a sport it to be entertained on a entertaining vs dangerous and damaging scale I think we got the highest entertainment value for the least dangerous/damaging action."

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,francostine,9,Wed Jun 17 16:36:34 2015 UTC,Don't even know why you're on MLS to begin with. 90% of the time if you sport a sounders flair you just get bashed.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,SonOfMechaMummy,7,Wed Jun 17 17:37:57 2015 UTC,"ah, but I sport a Seattle Reign flair!   Certain aspects of discussion there I usually enjoy, and it's useful for keeping up on news. But I think it's going to be like how it was at the end of the 2013 season for a while, so better to just take a break."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,cantbeassed,8,Wed Jun 17 17:47:48 2015 UTC,"The funny part, is that you know if it was Dwyer or Wright-Phillips, these same fans would be singing a different tune. But since it's Dempsey, and It's Seattle, everyone piles on the hate/classy train."

Now that I know though.... damn, that was not okay in my book. Dempsey has always been a bit hotheaded but that was some childish shit right there. Its frustrating as hell, but I mean come on Clint....  Sigh... Oh well, Hope Oba is not out for too long and hope we can get back to it Saturday and kick some SJ ass."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,btener412,17,Wed Jun 17 15:56:26 2015 UTC,"I've noticed I'm in the minority, but I don't like how ripping a notebook is technically worthy of equal suspension to punching the ref in the face. Ripping the refs notebook doesn't seem that bad to me."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,btener412,4,Wed Jun 17 15:24:49 2015 UTC,"Eh, it's a thin line for me. He invaded the ref's personal space (something he has repeatedly done in MLS) and made a very aggressive action of taking his paper and then tearing it. You're right he didn't give the guy a black eye or anything, but it is still an aggressive and threatening act."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,7,Wed Jun 17 15:41:08 2015 UTC,Oh absolutely. I just don't think it should be a 3 month suspension. That seems a bit extreme.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,mikejunior211,9,Wed Jun 17 15:54:13 2015 UTC,"Agree, you might as well punch him if it's going to get you the same ban as ripping up a notebook.  Not saying he should have done either, but there should be some adjustment on the ban based on severity."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,SonOfMechaMummy,0,Wed Jun 17 16:20:31 2015 UTC,"Well, no, because the punch also could open you up to assault and court and legal fun."

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,steveotheguide,1 point,Wed Jun 17 16:20:32 2015 UTC,The suspension should be AS high AS someone being ejected for sarcastically clapping on the referee's face. Not a bit more. But you never now with these Pharisees
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,YOULOVETHESOUNDERS,0,Thu Jun 18 02:53:03 2015 UTC,It's a red card and probably an additional suspension of a couple games in future USOC play. It is not Luis Suarez biting Chiellini.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,betacatenin,15,Wed Jun 17 20:41:30 2015 UTC,"Stay away from /r/mls unless you want to see vile hate for Clint, as if ripping a notebook is equivalent to hitting a ref."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,ErnieDouglas,13,Wed Jun 17 15:35:40 2015 UTC,The amount of down votes that sounders fans are accumulating over there is frankly absurd.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,thegodsarepleased,14,Wed Jun 17 16:43:39 2015 UTC,Oh you're trying to bring the discussion back from the extreme where Dempsey's fatherhood is being questioned?  You must not be contributing to the discussion!
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,ErnieDouglas,6,Wed Jun 17 16:49:48 2015 UTC,Wow that is ridiculous. As if his actions on the field against a referee have anything to do with how he fathers his own children.
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,hdaigre47,2,Wed Jun 17 17:14:03 2015 UTC,I would just recommend staying away fom /r/mls in general.  that place is quickly becoming a giant cesspool of borderline sjw antics and trolls.  it used to be great but its become more and more insufferable the larger its gotten.

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,thegraduate,13,Wed Jun 17 17:09:43 2015 UTC,Not in the slightest. A ref won't shoot you in the face.

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,conconcon,16,Wed Jun 17 15:11:26 2015 UTC,"Don't know why you're being downvoted. Just look at his refereeing career.   In the 14 matches he's center ref'd, 7 of them have involved at least one red card. He's issued 6 red cards in his last 3 USOC matches."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,sam3123,9,Wed Jun 17 16:19:45 2015 UTC,"Sounds like a ref who wants to determine games. In the words of Shaq,  ""David Stern wonder why the league's losing money, that's why.

SoundersFC,3a5z5s,AlienMutantRobotDog,2,Wed Jun 17 17:18:23 2015 UTC,"I think most of us can agree that while we want to win as much hardware as possible, the ultimate goal for this team is an MLS Cup. Depending on Oba's injury and Dempsey's suspension, that goal just got much harder to accomplish. I didn't want too many Starting XI players in this game for this exact reason.  What a waste of a game.   That being said, hopefully we have our best players back healthy and rested for a nice late season run; and in the meantime we give the young guns a chance to prove themselves and gain experience. Just need to stay playoff relevant in the meantime."
SoundersFC,3a5z5s,philwelch,2,Wed Jun 17 16:28:43 2015 UTC,"I agree with your thoughts.  I think it is important for the Sounders to decide what this means moving forward.  I love that they participate in the US Open Cup and their efforts have certainly caused other MLS teams to step up their game for the tournament, but after having such terribly under-qualified refs in both games and the injury to Oba... maybe it is time to reconsider our interest in the Open Cup.    If nothing else I hope that these games can spark a conversation about the qualifications of the ref's in these games, sure this wasn't 60,000 and an ESPN audience, but the fans still deserve better.   ETA:  I am surprised more people aren't upset about Sigi saying he might have 'choked' a ref if he would have remained in his coaching box."

Not only was this game the only MLS v MLS USOC game this round but it was against two major rivals in a small field. It doesn't take a genius to recognize that they might want to have one of their better refs handling a game like this. It doesn't matter if the ref made good or bad decisions, he lost control of the game and it spiraled out of control in an almost epic fashion."
SoundersFC,3a51wg,theREALbmills,9,Wed Jun 17 09:49:44 2015 UTC,"This Sounders vs. Timbers rivalry is just a distraction for the actual most heated rivalry in US soccer: LA Galaxy II vs. Orange County Blues.  After refereeing that high profile game, being assigned to this match was a real step down and break from the intensity and exposure he's used to with players who work at car dealerships and Home Depot during the week. So what if Clint Dempsey has a couple of caps for the UMSNT and each team's respective fanbases are escorted into their rival's stadiums and Starfire seats less than a 5A high school stadium; these are petty pleas for special treatment and should have no impact on the assignment of referees. I mean what's next: you're gonna tell me that if this guy were in Spain he's not qualified to ref a Classico? Let's get a grip here, people. We should give him and US Soccer the respect they deserve for professional and logical decisions and a game well refereed and to stop being so obtuse. /s"

Might call it a ""non-consensual handshake"". It's not clear if it was intentional or accidental which is probably what the call hinges on. Clip: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2h_vPQ-bdM#t=3m24s Then even worse is the straight red for Azira, where at most there's some accidental contact on the back heel and light hand on the chest followed by a flop.

SoundersFC,3a51wg,analyze,-4,Wed Jun 17 18:21:41 2015 UTC,A tactical foul initially warrants the yellow. Then continuously kicking a player in the back of the leg? Don't be delusional. That's a caution all day long.
SoundersFC,3a51wg,longlive289s,2,Wed Jun 17 18:50:48 2015 UTC,"No he's going for the ball which is being covered by the player. that foul goes against the player on the ground  USSF: ""Merely committing a dangerous act is not, by itself, an offense (e.g., kicking high enough that the cleats show or attempting to play the ball while on the ground). Committing a dangerous act while an opponent is nearby is not, by itself, an offense. The act becomes an offense only when an opponent is adversely and unfairly affected, usually by the opponent ceasing to challenge for the ball in order to avoid receiving or causing injury as a direct result of the player’s act"".

SoundersFC,3a51wg,analyze,-4,Wed Jun 17 20:47:47 2015 UTC,"He got pulled down, and then got kicked. No where in that law does it state it's okay to kick a player while he's on the ground."
SoundersFC,3a51wg,longlive289s,2,Wed Jun 17 21:33:35 2015 UTC,It is in that rule. Basically says if he falls down and stops playing the ball and Brad is still going for the ball the foul is on the player that has stopped playing for the ball. You can't tell from that angle if he is kicking him at all. From the movement of his body it looks like he is trying to pull the ball out from his body that he is draped on. The pull from Brad was pretty incidental for him to go down like that too
SoundersFC,3a51wg,Contagion21,4,Wed Jun 17 22:30:04 2015 UTC,That little hand tug? There were several strategic fouls breaking up offensive chances during the game that weren't carded.
SoundersFC,3a51wg,Felixthegreyhound,7,Wed Jun 17 18:36:05 2015 UTC,Terrible terrible officiating. My 9 year old was in tears at the chaos. The fool lost control of the game. What a mess. Maybe this will be the catalyst to bring up the quality of MLS refs. If we want to attract higher level world players we must bring a higher level of officiating. Sad day at Starfire.
SoundersFC,3a51wg,eosrebel,2,Wed Jun 17 13:35:51 2015 UTC,"That's the thing though, he's not an MLS ref. Until yesterday all he's ever been apart of are matches involving USL and NASL teams. We can't use this as a call for higher standards for MLS officiating when Radford is not a part of the MLS ref pool."
SoundersFC,3a51wg,Felixthegreyhound,2,Wed Jun 17 14:41:48 2015 UTC,I know it wasn't an MLS game nor an MLS official. I didn't mean to mislead folks. But I do think it helps show how important good officiating is. I do think the MLS is watching.
SoundersFC,3a72jb,FreeRoaminEmreCan,13,Wed Jun 17 19:06:19 2015 UTC,"Because the refs couldn't see what was going on.  We got to pick our kit, so we went with the usual US Open Cup third kit...  Timbers chose to go with dark green instead of the more contrasting red, knowing full well what kit we chose.  Sigi talks about it in his post match interview."
SoundersFC,3a72jb,Schwa142,2,Wed Jun 17 19:16:30 2015 UTC,Red wouldn't have been any better of a contrast because their red kid is also fairly dark. It's a red faded to black. I have no idea why Portland doesn't have at least one light colored kit.
SoundersFC,3a72jb,Warvanov,6,Wed Jun 17 20:25:09 2015 UTC,"I actually think they're supposed to...  Either way, black vs. dark green is much, much worse than black vs. brightish red falling into black (their sleeves are pretty bright red)."
SoundersFC,3a72jb,Schwa142,-6,Wed Jun 17 20:27:09 2015 UTC,They do. Their 3rd kit is white.
SoundersFC,3a72jb,knightlock15,2,Wed Jun 17 22:06:21 2015 UTC,"Which kit is that? They have the dark green kit that they wore, the black and red kit, and the other dark green throwback kit."
SoundersFC,3a72jb,Warvanov,1 point,Wed Jun 17 22:41:07 2015 UTC,"Their 3rd kit is dark green, similar to their primary kit (which they wore last night)...  Their secondary is full red sleeves/shoulders, with a black to red fade on the body."
SoundersFC,3a72jb,Schwa142,1 point,Wed Jun 17 23:42:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the explanation.  Odd that the ref let them play with similar looking kits in the first place.  Definitely fuels the idea that the officiating was awful in the match.
SoundersFC,3a72jb,vuduwastaken,2,Wed Jun 17 23:27:43 2015 UTC,Portland only brought one kit with them for some reason so we needed to change.  EDIT: why downvotes? They brought the green kit which was obviously causing a problem and Sigi petitioned the refs to have them change but they only had one kit...

There as a Timbers fan in the front row (right side) of the grandstand literally shouting in peoples faces and running up and down the aisle just begging to get in a fight. Security didn't remove/move him until after the 90 minute mark even after multiple people raised concerns to them."
SoundersFC,3a4q5p,Fritzed,2,Wed Jun 17 18:34:28 2015 UTC,"Fans were definitely frustrated. Didn't see the TV feed, but people were upset at many of the calls. I left after the goal in extra time, which was extra crappy due to the excessive celebrating by the Timbers players and the jeering of the Timbers fans on the way out. Doesn't justify people throwing stuff, the game was pretty even between the two sides, and as Skuby said, we're not children. I will note, this is the first game at Starfire that I saw with beer outside of the garden.I'm pretty sure it was 5 bucks a glass. Pretty sure people do all sorts of childish things when they've put 20 dollars worth of beer in them over the course of an hour."

You think it's some sort of statiscal miracle we were unbeaten there until this shit show? Nah.  And as for timbers supporters who have the gall to show up at our fucking grounds, we have a song for them - it goes, ""take em all...""

Second yellow on Evans in the replay doesn't look like it deserved a card at all, there's basically no contact other than some hand holding: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2h_vPQ-bdM#t=3m24s  Then even worse is the straight red for Azira, where at most there's some accidental contact on the back heel and ""light"" hand on the chest followed by a flop. At most should have been a yellow: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2h_vPQ-bdM#t=7m02s"

Extra curriculars once player was on the ground (kicking at the player) 3. A tell tale sign of a good call (at least accepted call) is when players don't argue or put up a fuss.  Evans and other Sounders seemed to barely put up a fuss.  Azira: 1. Admittedly this was the most suspect call, but considering the position of the ref it is at least understandable that he thought Azira's elbow made contact with Urruti's face. 2. Urruti is known for flopping.  Dempsey: 1. No excuse and deserved a red."

SoundersFC,3a4on3,joylongdivision,-1,Wed Jun 17 05:13:33 2015 UTC,You don't care about going out to portland in a competition whose trophy we currently hold?  What?
SoundersFC,3a4on3,MalcolmXXY,7,Wed Jun 17 05:20:40 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the game? Never will I say a game is won/lost by the ref, but this was about as close as you can possibly get. Had we lost 11v11, fair and square, kinda like the playoffs I'd be sour. But now, I kinda just have to laugh."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,joylongdivision,16,Wed Jun 17 05:24:42 2015 UTC,"As a Portland fan this really didn't feel much like a win.  More like, a series of bizarre events that my team benefited from."

The fans at the end of the game throwing things on the field discredit this team and shame all the heart and passion this team showed tonight.  They are the second worse part of tonight.  I disagree with all three reds and hope this ref never see an MLS team again.  Why did it have to be against Portland.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,Jesuslookalike,9,Wed Jun 17 05:19:48 2015 UTC,"I disagree with all three reds and hope this ref never see an MLS team again.   Dempsey most certainly deserved his, despite how good it felt to watch emotionally at the time.  We're lucky he didn't pull that in an MLS game or he'd be looking at a long suspension."

That was a joke of a 30 seconds with the two reds. And they should have refused to play.  Edit: not that anyone gives a damn, but after sleeping on it and seeing deuces real reason for the red, I retract my previous statement."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,deafballboy,-3,Wed Jun 17 05:38:56 2015 UTC,I'm pretty sure no one's getting hurt from some cups and trash. Obviously people should not throw things that might hurt someone.

SoundersFC,3a4on3,bforeverdreamin,23,Wed Jun 17 05:28:10 2015 UTC,Honestly we played with a lot of heart and until the ref and oba's injury took us out of the game we looked like the better team in the second half...but that ref...what the fuck...those last two reds...time to go back to U12 buddy
SoundersFC,3a4on3,overruns,6,Wed Jun 17 05:10:54 2015 UTC,"I've got literally no experience with reffing, but you've gotta know that a straight red on a team already a man down is not going to go over well. I mean, not to enable reckless endangerment, but a yellow there has a very different effect on the game."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,mostrasho,9,Wed Jun 17 05:14:16 2015 UTC,A yellow for ariza would have been fair imo...it didn't look that bad on the stream and pretty accidental. The red for Dempsey though...he must have taken that guys mother in vain. Idk what the ref expected him to say after he had been calling that game that way.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,overruns,12,Wed Jun 17 05:16:47 2015 UTC,"He took the refs book, threw it, picked it up and tore it. That was what he got carded for. I'm not even mad, that's pretty epic."

SoundersFC,3a4on3,BugSTi,11,Wed Jun 17 05:18:30 2015 UTC,"I've learned some valuable refereeing skills today.  1) When you want to be more powerful, get super anal about throw-ins.  2) Be a bro to the commentator. Have an awesome haircut.  3) The red card is a way to show disapproval. Some players will leave the field after seeing this card, but don't worry. They are just poor sports.  4) If you are trying to give out more cards than Hallmark, make sure the match doesn't have the greatest camera angles so no one can definitively second guess you.  In all seriousness, I felt the game was going decently. Obviously losing Martins hurt. The ref was super shaky. We tried, we got frustrated, and we lost."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,iandrewpeters,4,Wed Jun 17 05:35:57 2015 UTC,Early in the game when I saw those throw-in calls I turned and told my girlfriend that the ref was going to lose the game.  Seriously who is that uptight about throw-ins?
SoundersFC,3a4on3,thegodsarepleased,7,Wed Jun 17 06:29:57 2015 UTC,"This will be my standard for the worst reffing I've ever seen, on a scale of 0-10. Props to US Soccer for hiring a bush league 25 year old to ref the most intense rivalry in America."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,thegodsarepleased,2,Wed Jun 17 05:28:50 2015 UTC,"This is my first season following MLS. I've noticed the refs usually play a pivotal role in any match I watch, and both teams agree the refs weren't very good. Are most MLS refs shit, or am I just getting unlucky and watching the shit matches?"
SoundersFC,3a4on3,iandrewpeters,8,Wed Jun 17 05:39:43 2015 UTC,"This wasn't MLS league play. It was US Open Cup, which hired their own regional referees. S2 got the shaft at RSL thanks to the absolute worst call I have seen. (Yes I watched the SKC game the other day)"
SoundersFC,3a4on3,BugSTi,0,Wed Jun 17 05:53:51 2015 UTC,"I kept trying to remind myself all day that this wasn't MLS, then I went and blew it. I have egg on my face."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,iandrewpeters,2,Wed Jun 17 14:16:44 2015 UTC,This was a special kind of stupid. This wasn't an MLS match but it did feature MLS teams. Unfortunately US Soccer (which hosts the Open Cup tournament) didn't get the memo and hired what I presume to be a kid off from school for the summer. The last bad reffing situation was against SKC two weeks ago. Otherwise it's been a normal enough season.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,thegodsarepleased,6,Wed Jun 17 05:56:52 2015 UTC,"Ugg. Some assholes just HAD to throw shit, huh? I hope they are arrested.  I'm fucking disgusted."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,nikdahl,3,Wed Jun 17 05:23:00 2015 UTC,"Chances are that they were. Small crowd, most have no tolerance for that kind of behavior."

Example: A timber's fan was taunting the fans after the game, with her hand in an L on a forehead while saying some really rude/mean shit and a woman lunged at her and was promptly arrested."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,RikuKat,4,Wed Jun 17 20:10:10 2015 UTC,Fuck dude I'm not even mad. Too worried about Oba to be pissed at the moment.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,pal25,9,Wed Jun 17 05:28:04 2015 UTC,"So when does the match fixing investigation begin?  Also, was anyone else hoping Sigi would pull a Lou Pinella at the end there?"
SoundersFC,3a4on3,philwelch,5,Wed Jun 17 05:20:11 2015 UTC,Sigi carried the spirit of Lou. He had words with the ref at the end of the 90. Plus he knocked over the corner flag when he was walking out at the Azira/Dempsey reds. Everyone was distracted by the commotion with the double reds that few paid attention to Sigi walking off.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,wsu_omg,2,Wed Jun 17 06:26:40 2015 UTC,The corner flag was pretty Pinella of him.

On the bright side, it's one less thing to worry about this season. I would rather our focus be solely on the MLS Cup this season anyways. Hardware is nice, but I really want our boys to finally bring home the big one."

SoundersFC,3a4on3,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,0,Wed Jun 17 05:41:47 2015 UTC,"Looks like he did it stretching for that block. I thought it was a knee at the game (just behind the Portland bench) but watching the replay, it was non-contact and likely did it on the lunge. Typical groin pull is 2-4 weeks, tear is 6-8 if I remember correctly."

SoundersFC,3a4on3,clickmyface,1 point,Wed Jun 17 06:01:30 2015 UTC,I came in at half time and it was just a normal stream. I think the first half they may have had a camera malfunction or something and had to use secondary cameras.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,BugSTi,2,Wed Jun 17 06:05:46 2015 UTC,Losing to Tampa was way worse.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,BugSTi,1 point,Wed Jun 17 05:20:57 2015 UTC,Did you know Zach Scott's brother was on the winning team? Did you know the Sounders almost scored the tying goal except it was stopped on the line via a handball? The following PK was a MISS and the sounders went on to lose.
SoundersFC,3a4on3,-Zoomacroom-,-2,Wed Jun 17 06:04:25 2015 UTC,"Well, that was one of the most entertaining games I've ever seen. The officiating was prison. I hope Oba is okay. Can you guys imagine if that was on national TV? We would be absolute legends.   We have CCL and guys who will be out for Gold Cup so frankly we can use the breathing room. We all know Portland is going to lose so lets go out and get the MLS cup this year."

SoundersFC,3a4on3,pinkal_peaches,0,Wed Jun 17 05:29:49 2015 UTC,"I honestly am ok with the result. We already have enough with Supporters Shield in sight, MLS cup visions, and CONCACAF games to be played. Playing in the open cup cost us MLS league points last year. In the end it didnt matter because we still got the shield, but it came down to the wire with it all hanging on the last two games vs LA.   Portland can have the ""glory"" of beating us with 7 men. We tied them with 10.   The sucky part is next year we will be hosed for our first open cup game due to the reds. Of course it will likely be vs pdx again."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,SounderBruce,0,Wed Jun 17 05:55:27 2015 UTC,"I'd be completely fine with the loss if it meant Oba wasn't hurt.  Edit: To clarify, fine with an overall L result... not in which the way it happened or the officiating."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,ezobel,0,Wed Jun 17 05:48:04 2015 UTC,"What I want to know, is why the ref thought it was necessary to pull Brad nearly ten yards from the spot of the foul, directly in front of TA to issue the second card.  Dude needs to find a different job, because he sure is a shitty ref."
SoundersFC,3a4on3,clickmyface,0,Wed Jun 17 05:52:12 2015 UTC,Definitely the most dramatic game I've ever seen.  Hope the best for Martins and anyone else injured in that mess.

SoundersFC,3a4on3,MalcolmXXY,4,Wed Jun 17 05:35:37 2015 UTC,"We played Saturday, today is Tuesday, we also play the coming Saturday, Wednesday, Sunday, and Friday. Alonso, Pineda, Pappa, Scott, and Barrett were not available even on the bench. A better lineup is pretty tough given those facts.

Led a constantly changing back line that included 5 other defenders over the course of the match.   I also thought the back line had to clean up for the central mids. Particularly in the first half. Azira was outmatched and Jewsbury, Valeri, and Fernandez often had a lot of time on the ball."

The whole first half the RSL commentators were complaining about the lack of experience that the refs had.   S2 lost because of the most bs call ever, all due to players from RSL approaching the ref after the no call on the supposed ""back pass to the keeper"" (which took a deflection that even the RSL commentators saw).  They RSL players complained, the ref decided to overturn the no call into an indirect free kick from about 4 yrds out. S2 players complain about the fact that it is bs, and one gets a yellow card for it.   the ball is touched and Plata launches it into the back of the net from 2 yards out."

SoundersFC,3a3yyj,Awbade,8,Wed Jun 17 05:04:21 2015 UTC,This is the worst officiating I've ever seen. Maybe I'm missing something because I'm here right now instead of seeing it on TV but from where we are standing this ref isn't making any foul calls vs Portland.
SoundersFC,3a3yyj,fumer_les_arbres,3,Wed Jun 17 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"Unlike the Kansans city game I feel that todays ref actually show remarkable consistency. While the KC ref only messed up two major split second decisions (one of which was on the linesman) this ref made a serious of unfortunate decisions throughout the game benefiting the flopping of uruti, Fernandez, and that other bitch. Evans second yellow was ridiculous, along the sideline with his back to goal and he goes down like a sack of potatoes grabbing the ball. Aziras was equally insane, a fair attempt at winning and shielding the ball is somehow a red when uruti goes down like he got fucking neutered. Worst of all is poor oba. I don't want to talk about soccer anymore, but still... go sounders!"

The Sounders are also likely to be without Chad Barrett, who's nursing a hamstring injury and Marco Pappa, who's playing a World Cup qualifier on Monday night. Other players who's availability is at least somewhat in doubt include Obafemi Martins (still recovering from nose surgery), Clint Dempsey (has never played at Starfire) and Chad Marshall (unlikely to play three games in a week).   From Sounder At Heart.  This will be a scary match, as Timbers are fully rested coming off a bye week."

Something along the lines of how MowwMoww helped out when you thought the team only practiced on turf at Starfire.

They are both in Occidental Park, they then march to the stadium about an hour before the game I believe."
SoundersFC,39xy93,mferrell50,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:52:54 2015 UTC,"Getting a ticket in the supporters section may be a bit difficult.  They stopped allowing those tickets to be sold on 3rd party sites this year.  It's my understanding that you have to get them from a member of the ECS (Emerald City Supporters) directly.  I could be wrong, that's just my understanding.    Aside from that, go to the March To The Match.  1 hour prior starting at Occidental Park. Pretty much any bar around the stadium will have supporters that you can drink with."
SoundersFC,39xy93,VoluntaryAncap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 19:55:34 2015 UTC,"That makes sense. I noticed on third party sites that those areas had no tickets for sale and I was curious as to why.

SoundersFC,39xy93,VoluntaryAncap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:04:22 2015 UTC,I have sat in the Hawk's nest.  While there isn't really a 'bad' seat in Century Link.  There a better spots for atmosphere than the hawks nest.  Right now Stubhub has seats in section 120 from $40 up.  The supporters sections are 121-123 so if you are looking for atmosphere I'd go for section 120.
SoundersFC,39xy93,Sounders_Till_I_Die,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"Ticketmaster is hit or miss, and in the resale section, often overpriced.  Best bet (or at least what I usually do) for tickets is to scour craigslist, look for GA tickets (thats the supporters section) and do electronic payment/electronic ticket transfer.  When you get your e-tickets, be sure to renew the barcode so you dont get scammed just in case.  There's no shortage of beer, and its good local beer, so drink it all.  In-stadium beers are in the $9 range, so consider doing most of it pre-game.  Drink responsibly, and don't drink Bud products."
SoundersFC,39xy93,VoluntaryAncap,1 point,Mon Jun 15 20:02:47 2015 UTC,What's wrong with Bud products? Is it because they bought Elysian?

SoundersFC,39ttdh,trickjarrett,7,Sun Jun 14 18:34:54 2015 UTC,"Makes sense, the quality of our play and offense has gone up since those two started playing together. Montero was great for us, but Clint and Oba are great for each other and us!"
SoundersFC,39ttdh,colenboozey,3,Sun Jun 14 19:14:40 2015 UTC,Is it just me or does Clint always look mad?
SoundersFC,39ttdh,deweese3,3,Sun Jun 14 22:36:54 2015 UTC,Have you never watched him play before he joined the Sounders? He's a pretty intense guy when on the field.
SoundersFC,39ttdh,john_mcrotten,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:41:30 2015 UTC,"He also comes across as pretty dirty at times. I love the guy cuz he plays for us, but he always is starting shit with other players."
SoundersFC,39ttdh,Shralpental,5,Mon Jun 15 01:03:45 2015 UTC,Dirty isn't the right word. Aggressive is.
SoundersFC,39ttdh,thegraduate,2,Mon Jun 15 05:28:23 2015 UTC,I wouldn't call that dirty. He's just letting them know they're not friends. The nut tap was rare.
SoundersFC,39ttdh,benfreilich,3,Mon Jun 15 02:44:23 2015 UTC,Montero had way cooler goals
SoundersFC,39ttdh,tuttlebuttle,2,Mon Jun 15 06:05:52 2015 UTC,"How many goals are they, and how many games?"
SoundersFC,39ttdh,Fritzed,2,Sun Jun 14 22:36:06 2015 UTC,"Montero: 47 goals in 119 games - 0.395 goals/game  Martins: 32 in 62 games - 0.516 goals/game  Dempsey: 23 in 47 games - 0.489 goals/game (Note: This number is not 100% definite. MLS stats are career long (48), not just goals for Sounders, so I fell back to Wikipedia which says 23 for Sounders. Thanks /u/Fritzed for confirming)"
SoundersFC,39ttdh,tuttlebuttle,2,Sun Jun 14 23:51:32 2015 UTC,Confirmed 23 in league play. It's easy to add the last 3 years together on his MLS stats page.
SoundersFC,39ttdh,Schwa142,1 point,Mon Jun 15 00:49:59 2015 UTC,Thanks.  The longer these 2 play for Seattle the better.  I'd be surprised if they don't keep up the pace.
SoundersFC,39ttdh,john_mcrotten,2,Mon Jun 15 00:09:46 2015 UTC,"I think it's a good sign, and shows how we have more strikers capable of goals than we use to..."
SoundersFC,39ttdh,Schwa142,2,Sun Jun 14 23:35:58 2015 UTC,I miss those days but am grateful the team evolved. Imagine if we had never picked up EJ and never sold Montero and were still relying on only him to score goals.
SoundersFC,39ttdh,Shralpental,2,Mon Jun 15 00:43:20 2015 UTC,He would have moved on one way or another...
SoundersFC,39ttdh,neon_nikedude,2,Mon Jun 15 00:44:21 2015 UTC,"Could you imagine having Freddy oba and Clint. I don't know if they could play all at the same time, but damn that would be fun to watch."

SoundersFC,39vyg6,ECSJack,2,Tue Jun 16 17:45:55 2015 UTC,Most of the s2 matches are available on YouTube or on the sounders website.

SoundersFC,39vu4f,jaschac,2,Mon Jun 15 05:27:28 2015 UTC,"Neat. I always liked Ashani Fairclough and thought he would be a good fit next to Zavaleta, being more of a rangey, brave Jhon Kennedy Hurtado/Jámison Olave type to Zavaleta's style more reminiscent of a Chad Marshall/Nat Borchers. It seemed like his days in green were numbered when we drafted his fellow countryman, Daimion Lowe, but S2 definitely need some defensive help."

SoundersFC,39rzrn,francostine,19,Sun Jun 14 05:40:10 2015 UTC,He's not a spurs player.   Fuck that.  He's a Sounder for life.

SoundersFC,39rzrn,francostine,2,Sun Jun 14 06:34:13 2015 UTC,But but he did have 15 minutes of playing time as a Spur this season.
SoundersFC,39rzrn,hey_kool_aid,1 point,Sun Jun 14 17:16:39 2015 UTC,Any chance he comes back for the summer on a loan?
SoundersFC,39rzrn,Syuk_Dat_Deke,2,Sun Jun 14 08:13:26 2015 UTC,"I don't think so. He will be playing for them as much as possible before the season starts, and hopefully he stays with their first team or gets loaned to another English side."
SoundersFC,39sgkp,SonOfMechaMummy,26,Sun Jun 14 09:02:04 2015 UTC,"Brad Evans - Came in and shut down all the nonsense that was going on in the midfield. Made a key tackle/assist, and generally calmed things down with good defense and passing. He completely changed the flow of the match."
SoundersFC,39sgkp,dsn0wman,10,Sun Jun 14 15:25:11 2015 UTC,Stefan Frei - Stupendous performance to hold the shutout
SoundersFC,39sgkp,trickjarrett,11,Sun Jun 14 15:03:39 2015 UTC,"Neagle, scored, assisted on another, was in that great set of passes that nearly led to a 4th. Great game all around for him.  Evans probably gets second for me, game changed when he entered."
SoundersFC,39sgkp,thatevildude,6,Sun Jun 14 15:21:43 2015 UTC,"So a part of me just wants to give it to Leo for the sweet goal.   Honestly it is Evans, honestly he seemed like a decent replacement for Ozzie. He commanded the midfield and if not for his aggressive tackle we would have been chasing the first goal a lot longer. The man is a beast. I think Frei has a great claim to it as he kept us in it with a great save (save of the week?!).   (Pardon typos, I'm on mobile.)"
SoundersFC,39sgkp,SplooshFC,3,Sun Jun 14 20:56:33 2015 UTC,slight edge to evans over frei for me....frei kept us in it during the first half but evans brought energy in off the bench and got the offense rolling.
SoundersFC,39sgkp,mtskin,3,Sun Jun 14 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Evans. He completely changed the game when he came in. Even getting an early, stupid yellow worked to set the tone for his night."
SoundersFC,39sgkp,MapsMapsEverywhere,2,Sun Jun 14 18:38:57 2015 UTC,"Its a tie for me between Frei and Evans. If Frei doesn't stop that shot from Bekker, it is an entirely different match. Evans changed the pace of the match when he came on and really helped open up the offense.   I would also consider nominating Fabian Castillo for disappearing in the second half compared to the first."
SoundersFC,39sgkp,john_mcrotten,2,Sun Jun 14 15:53:04 2015 UTC,"Evans.  He completely changed the game when he came in.  Also, shout out to Mears for shutting down Castillo."
SoundersFC,39sgkp,Looorney,1 point,Sun Jun 14 23:13:45 2015 UTC,Frei is my MOTM. He kept us in the game and in position to take over the second half like we did.
SoundersFC,39rwto,MowwMoww,24,Sun Jun 14 04:03:21 2015 UTC,"Evans changed everything in that lackluster midfield at half-time. I know /u/MowwMoww has been a big proponent of moving him back.   Other thoughts: Oba just being Oba, Neagle looked better, Mears is the best RB in the league, and how about Leo Gonzalez?! I don't know why but his goal made me so happy (apparently Keller too)."
SoundersFC,39rwto,Skuby_Duby_Du,21,Sun Jun 14 04:05:05 2015 UTC,Leos been a solid defender for years at the club and its always nice when long term players get goals. He's a defender too so scoring is uncommon and he's getting towards the end of his career here so it was nice that he got another nice memory before he leaves or retires!
SoundersFC,39rwto,KineticDiabetic,12,Sun Jun 14 04:12:09 2015 UTC,Also he just seemed so happy about scoring.  Hard not to feel happy when someone is that overjoyed.
SoundersFC,39rwto,ErnieDouglas,5,Sun Jun 14 04:16:26 2015 UTC,"Everyone else seemed happy too. It's rare to see Oba crack a smile but he was the first one to get to Leo, and he was grinning like a child."
SoundersFC,39rwto,joylongdivision,3,Sun Jun 14 04:52:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah totally.  Everyone's obviously happy after any goal, but one's like that you can really tell are something special for the guys who score them."
SoundersFC,39rwto,wunwuncrush,2,Sun Jun 14 05:38:19 2015 UTC,I personally don't see Leo leaving. He'll end up being a Latin American ambassador for the club
SoundersFC,39rwto,francostine,21,Sun Jun 14 06:27:13 2015 UTC,I just want to get a Zach Scott jersey douse it in beer and rip the sleeves off.. for he is the ultimate working man!
SoundersFC,39rwto,FuriousStyles13,18,Sun Jun 14 04:41:32 2015 UTC,"For reference, the last time Leo scored way back in 2010."
SoundersFC,39rwto,SounderBruce,3,Sun Jun 14 04:03:59 2015 UTC,Wow! What a strike!
SoundersFC,39rwto,doublemazaa,1 point,Sun Jun 14 05:50:14 2015 UTC,"such a good set of players that year, seeing the dog pile after the goal brought lots of fond memories rushing back!"
SoundersFC,39rwto,schmeebasaur,16,Mon Jun 15 03:44:31 2015 UTC,How about that save by Frei? If that goes in the rest of the game may not have been what it was...
SoundersFC,39rwto,jonkenobi,6,Sun Jun 14 04:22:04 2015 UTC,Exactly why I'm voting him MotM if the thread goes up. He weathered the storm to allow our second half subs to make a real difference.
SoundersFC,39rwto,knightlock15,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:27:52 2015 UTC,Anyone have a gif of this?
SoundersFC,39rwto,SuperSounderHawk,13,Sun Jun 14 20:01:35 2015 UTC,"Well that was satisfying after last week. Martins is clearly at a higher level than everyone else, so glad he's back. Evans did quite well at mid so I'm curious how that will play out. Nice job Neagle, Mears and Leo too!"
SoundersFC,39rwto,KineticDiabetic,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:07:56 2015 UTC,Martins is clearly at a higher level than everyone else   I mean Clint Dempsey's 7 goals and 6 assists probably has something to say about that. That's what makes our team nuts.

SoundersFC,39rwto,trickjarrett,7,Sun Jun 14 04:10:45 2015 UTC,"I think this happens next game, or possibly the same lineup as today but Martins in for Neagle and Evans in for Rose."
SoundersFC,39rwto,ErnieDouglas,3,Sun Jun 14 04:12:05 2015 UTC,My guess is that we saved him for the US Open cup game this week.
SoundersFC,39rwto,schmeebasaur,8,Sun Jun 14 05:54:54 2015 UTC,Pineda was having a very off night.  We were so much better after he was taken out for Evans.
SoundersFC,39rwto,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,2,Sun Jun 14 04:17:48 2015 UTC,"it seems like Pineda has been struggling the last few games.  He's constantly a step too slow or just a bit off in his passing and its leading to a lot of breakdown in the midfield.  I noticed that Rose had a similar issue with his passing, often dumping the ball off to Dallas when he was playing on the right side."
SoundersFC,39rwto,01point21gigawatts,1 point,Mon Jun 15 03:47:52 2015 UTC,Seriously it was like a completely different game.
SoundersFC,39rwto,Audicity,9,Sun Jun 14 16:40:40 2015 UTC,Megan Rapinoe was no match for Oba on that 2nd goal.
SoundersFC,39rwto,lightjedi5,7,Sun Jun 14 05:40:47 2015 UTC,Free haircuts and giftcards for framing! Thank you Leo.
SoundersFC,39rwto,nikdahl,9,Sun Jun 14 04:11:17 2015 UTC,"Thomas...  I think he looked good attacking. However, his defense wasn't too good. I understand he's an attacking mid and not a true outside mid, so I'm hoping he gets better at tracking back, marking the overlap, not getting sucked inside, stuff like that. Offensively with time to gel he could be another strong attacking threat."
SoundersFC,39rwto,trickjarrett,2,Sun Jun 14 04:46:55 2015 UTC,"I was sitting by his corner of the field for the first half, and it just looked like he was trying to hard to impress. I have a feeling once he calms his nerves down a little bit, he will be more reliable."
SoundersFC,39rwto,lightjedi5,8,Sun Jun 14 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"Running down the roster:  Dempsey: Was strong tonight, lots of sexy passes and playmaking. A  Neagle: I always love seeing games when Neagle is on. A  Rose: He looked like he was a little off all night. Nothing terrible but lots of missed passes and just generally unable to get into a solid attacking position. C  Azira: By far the worst on the field tonight. While he was decent defensively he repeatedly failed to complete passes, and generally seemed out of position and having to sprint to recover. D  Pineda: Definitely not a great night for him. He got pulled out, and then when he got taken down he disengaged except as a playmaker. D  Thomas: Quite the promising start for our newest signing. But the keyword is promising. He seemed fine attacking, although he lost the ball on almost all of his possessions. The flashes we saw though give me hope that as he gels and learns to play with Dempsey and Oba, perhaps he'll be the third key attacker in our offense. B  Mears: Unquestionably the best signing we've made this year thus far, and possibly the best RB in the league right now. He's shown me that as fun as Yedlin was to watch, Mears fits better and is better in the position for us. A  Marshall: Solid. Always solid. A  Scott: A fairly solid game for Mr. Sounders. He also did a fairly solid job shutting Castillo down. A  Remick: A decent game for Remick, nothing amazing that I recall but I didn't notice him make any egregious errors. B  Frei: Swiss cheese is misnamed. Our swissman has no holes. He is a wall like the Alps. It will take Hannibal and an army of elephants to score a goal at this point. A+  Subs  Evans: Completely changed our midfield and brought order to the team. Solid performance aside from the careless tackle that earned him a yellow. A  Oba: He's not a man, he's a goal scoring machine now with terrifying mask. He's so good and we kept him mostly fresh for the Portland game this week! A  Leo: I'm liking this Leo as super-sub on the left side. The @SoundersLive account had infected me with hope to see a #LeaGoal one day, and today was that day. I loved seeing him swoop in on the ball and just nail it home in extra time. A    MAN OF THE MATCH: FREI!  These ratings are purely subjective and I'm happy to debate them and be corrected."
SoundersFC,39rwto,trickjarrett,7,Sun Jun 14 05:54:27 2015 UTC,"I get why you nominated Frei, but for the very reasons you've stated I'm going to nominate Evans for Man of the Match. He completely changed the midfield, made good tackles, held the ball up, had good distribution, not to mention good leadership. Plus he got that tackle up the pitch to assist Neagle, which got the team excited and lit a fire under them.  I'd downgrade Thomas to a C due to his defensive performance. He constantly got sucked in, failed to mark the overlapping run and just seemed a bit lazy in general on defense. But I agree that attacking he looked promising."
SoundersFC,39rwto,lightjedi5,2,Sun Jun 14 06:22:01 2015 UTC,"While Brad did change the midfield, without Frei we would have gone into the half down 1-0 if not 2-0.  I won't argue to defend Thomas as a B, the defense definitely was also a problem."
SoundersFC,39rwto,Teh1Person0,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:23:50 2015 UTC,Definitely. Frei was fantastic again. You can make a strong case for either of them I think.
SoundersFC,39rwto,nxtplato,2,Sun Jun 14 06:27:25 2015 UTC,Correction: Evans A++++++++
SoundersFC,39rwto,johnwaters29,7,Sun Jun 14 08:03:08 2015 UTC,"Azira frustrates me to no end.  But watching my boy Leo score more than made up for it.  My favorite Sounder for a long time, and tonight he was subbed on late and made a difference.  Great game!!"
SoundersFC,39rwto,Audicity,4,Sun Jun 14 04:30:39 2015 UTC,"Please keep Evans in midfield. He has potential at CB, but we need his talent in midfield.   Overall, great game (mainly second half). Let's keep this up boys!"
SoundersFC,39rwto,metameh,8,Sun Jun 14 04:15:41 2015 UTC,"I think tonight was more obvious of us not having Ozzie on. He commands the midfield like Brad did tonight. Azira just seemed lost a lot of the first half and Brad helped fix that.  Once Ozzie is back, I think the midfield will be just fine for Brad to go back to the CB role."
SoundersFC,39rwto,anijhaw,3,Sun Jun 14 08:48:38 2015 UTC,"Evans future is at CB and the team will be much better for it. Not only has he already had a few better games than Marshall when they were paired together, but his potential is MLS elite at CB. His ability to distribute from the back is an important wrinkle in our game plan, making us much less susceptible to high pressure. Playing at CB will also extend his career and give him a better shot at making the national team.  Keeping the central midfield less crowded will also free up minutes for Rose and Roldan, who are two guys that we can play and still be a top team. Roldan especially is a guy that I want to see get minutes, I think he can be an Evans/Alonso type face/heart of the franchise once he becomes a regular contributor."
SoundersFC,39rwto,btener412,4,Sun Jun 14 19:51:29 2015 UTC,Free haircuts!!
SoundersFC,39rwto,Sunny_Bunny808,3,Sun Jun 14 04:16:42 2015 UTC,I was so satisfied with a 2-0 win but when Leo scored it felt like they had just gotten a late winner. Made me so happy.
SoundersFC,39rwto,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,3,Sun Jun 14 04:37:23 2015 UTC,anyone have an update on the fan who was carried out on a stretcher from the sidelines?  Looked pretty bad.
SoundersFC,39rwto,Sunny_Bunny808,3,Sun Jun 14 08:31:23 2015 UTC,"Didn't hear about this, any idea what happened?"
SoundersFC,39rwto,nikdahl,1 point,Sun Jun 14 16:45:05 2015 UTC,"No idea.  It seemed like they fell from a bar stool without directly getting hit by the ball.  Seemed like a freak accident, but No official confirmation about what happened and the condition of the fan."
SoundersFC,39rwto,Sunny_Bunny808,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:03:24 2015 UTC,"Where was it? I remember a dude at the Slalom Experience tables taking a line drive ball, but don't know if he got injured."
SoundersFC,39rwto,lightjedi5,1 point,Sun Jun 14 18:27:31 2015 UTC,"Yea the fan that got taken out on stretcher was not hit by the ball, but just seemed to fall or something"
SoundersFC,39rwto,nikdahl,1 point,Mon Jun 15 09:03:48 2015 UTC,"I have another general question, but does anybody know why when Remick overlaps it's barely played to him? Any ideas? I've noticed it a lot recently, both with Pappa and again tonight with Thomas.   Maybe I'm missing something but I feel that if an overlapping run is never used it's pointless, and just opens up that hole for a counter-attack. Obviously it can't be played in every time but I feel like either A) Remick needs to be more selective in his runs or B) they need to play it in a little more in order to add the extra dimension and make the risk of opening up that hole worth it. Thoughts?"
SoundersFC,39rwto,Hepster22,3,Sun Jun 14 06:24:14 2015 UTC,"Selfishness and trust mostly. Dempsey always trusts Mears on the right side to put in a great cross but maybe they don't trust Remick to do the same. Also, Pappa and Thomas are probably pretty selfish players. They play attacking midfielder where they're the playmakers so naturally they want the ball at their feet. Only reasons I can think of outside of just flow of play."

SoundersFC,39lab1,MowwMoww,1 point,Fri Jun 12 18:09:20 2015 UTC,"I think I said something similar last year but I'm not really knowledgeable enough to criticize them in that area. We usually have a few hamstring injuries around this time of the year but to be fair to the trainers a lot of the injuries this year have been flukey like Oba's nose injury. Perhaps some of it has to due with playing half our games on turf, although I believe the team practices on grass fields 90% of the time.  I'd be really interested to see what goes into these injuries during training."

SoundersFC,39cjue,Fire_Ferrets,0,Wed Jun 10 23:43:11 2015 UTC,Still not wrong though. This is why we need him at RM because he has great vision to play passes and do shit like this.
SoundersFC,39cjue,andhelostthem,3,Thu Jun 11 00:43:08 2015 UTC,"As nice as it was to have him at RM, I think he is more valuable to us as a centerback. Roldan has looked pretty good on the right and Rose has played pretty decently there as well (although Rose plays better as a CM)."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,alexj757,8,Thu Jun 11 12:34:08 2015 UTC,"I think he will start the season as a supersub, and then he will be there to fill in for Oba/Dempsey when they are injured which has happened quite a few games. Morris would deserve the start/sub over Neagle or Barret for sure. I wouldn't be opposed to seeing Oba and Morris up to with Dempsey as a CAM though."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,antifreze,3,Thu Jun 11 13:43:39 2015 UTC,"Dempsey, Oba, AND Morris at the same time. Oh baby that is enticing. Yes please.  For those of you who understand soccer better than me would this be a feasible lineup for us: http://lineupbuilder.com/?sk=7d2n (a Diamond formation with Pappa and Thomas on the wings.)"
SoundersFC,39fqkz,littlenicky174,7,Thu Jun 11 15:04:44 2015 UTC,"That is stupidly attacking, so I dunno if it'd work. Ozzie's one of the best DMs in the league, but he's no magician. I think back to when RSL was having so much success with their diamond 442 under Kries, and one of the reasons that was was because they sat Ned Grabavoy in one of the midfield wide/shuttle positions, and had Chris Wingert at left back. Wingert didn't get forward much at all, and Grabavoy was mostly Pineda-esque in that he would distribute from deep, make late runs into the box, but mostly stay back with Beckerman and pick his time to join the attack. Even then though, you would see them get counter attacked if Wingert got forward too much, Grabavoy lost the ball in the midfield, or Beckerman found himself out of position (which was rare, tbh, and partially why they were so good under Kreis).  As for us, the only way I could see it working is if Morris was alright on the wing. Honestly his skills lend themselves well to that position, as he's certainly got the pace, and our wingers do like to come inside anyway, so it could work. Basically this is how I'd see it, with Pappa/Thomas providing width and some defensive help, Pineda acting as the Grabavoy, and Morris basically being a 3rd forward, like a better Neagle. I put Leo in too because he doesn't get forward at all, and when he does he's honestly not very good. As much as I like Remick he doesn't offer the same stability Leo does for me. The issue is width, but considering Oba/Dempsey/Martins are all mediocre in the air maybe it'd be alright. We'd certianly have issues breaking down teams that sit back against us and clog the middle though, as going through the wings is how we've dealt with that this year.   Dempsey as an attacking mid behind Morris and Oba I think would never work though, for a couple of reasons. The main is it leaves us with one pure central midfielder, and that just doesn't work against teams that play with two or three there, as I think we'd just get outnumbered. As good as Pappa in particular is about tracking back he just has nowhere near the same positional sense as Pineda, which makes sense because he's not a central mid, and it's apparent when we play against teams with 3, 4, or 5 in the midfield. The second reason is Sigi doesn't and never has played with a pure #10, and I don't really see that changing, but it's kind of a cop out argument.   Either way, it's a cool idea, but it may be a blessing in disguise he's spent so much time in college. We don't really have a place for him now."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,joylongdivision,2,Thu Jun 11 21:07:23 2015 UTC,I believe it would and I would like to see it at least once. Only thing is that Pineda gives us good connection all over the field and it's hard to replace him. He does a lot of behind the scenes work.
SoundersFC,39fqkz,littlenicky174,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:48:07 2015 UTC,"True, I love Pineda, but he has been injured multiple times. I can see this as a future formation that might be used, particularly if Pineda is injured, or whenever he decides to retire."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,lightjedi5,5,Thu Jun 11 17:06:41 2015 UTC,"I've been thinking about this and I think the best option is a 4-3-3                        Frei;   Mears, Evans, Marshall, Remick;                      Alonso;               Pineda, Pappa;     Morris, Dempsey, Martins   Alonso would play the DM roll with Pineda playing his deep lying playmaker roll, Pappa playing the same role he already plays just more centralized and helping the attack. Dempsey would play CF only because I believe Morris is faster so more suited as a winger, also when Dempsey drops back to help with bringing up the play Martins and Morris could float inside together.  Now the biggest question is can Martins and Morris play on the wings and be counted on to track back? I think so, plus with Mears at RB that would help, Remick would just have to pick his overlaps a bit more carefully. Either that or play Leo or another defensive minded player at the LB spot.  Edit: So on mobile my format looks like crap I'm going to hope everybody gets the point."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,SvanirePerish,4,Thu Jun 11 23:32:27 2015 UTC,"I don't think that lineup really works. I don't think three strikers is in our best interest, and I kind of think he would disrupt play between Oba and Clint, I think he could play really well with just Clint though, but I don't think that would be as good as with Oba. Jordan would be a substitute for either Clint and Oba realistically. Also, you have to factor in Thomas. We haven't seen him much yet, but if he pans out an attacking midfielder is more valuable than a third striker for sure, especially with our duo."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,hottoddy,2,Fri Jun 12 00:01:25 2015 UTC,"I think 4-3-3 could work, but I'd like to see it with Dempsey moved out wide.  Thinking along the lines of how RBNY used Henry in his last few seasons.  Jordan would HAVE to track back defensively and would be running all day, but if he's gassed at 60' you bring in neagle/rose/roldan and switch to 4-4-2, or bring in Barrett as a straight sub.  Another option would be 4-2-3-1 with Oba or Jordan up top, Dempsey and the other one in the 3 line with Pineda/Rose, and then Ozzie and Pineda/Rose as the 2.    Truthfully, I think he's gotta play super-sub for a while before we should start adjusting formations to fit him in, though. While his USMNT performances have been strong, they've not demonstrated that he's either full-match fit or that he's able to perform against top tier fresh legs."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,lightjedi5,1 point,Fri Jun 12 08:29:52 2015 UTC,"I agree about the super sub part, he would need to prove himself by subbing in for Martins or Dempsey when they're injured."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,Nekokeki,5,Fri Jun 12 17:55:50 2015 UTC,"You find a way to have him on the pitch. He's too talented for 10 minute sub appearances. Initially sure, but probably a few games into the season you would be adjusting your lineup to fit him in.   I'm not entirely convinced we'll be able to sign him still, but there's a chance and it would be nice for the Sounders to get something for him before he likely moves on to a European club."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,OfficialTomas,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:31:53 2015 UTC,Where is Morris' potential at? Does he have a chance at being a star or just a solid player for the national team? I just found out about him in these friendlies and he was killing it.
SoundersFC,39fqkz,ajrcoyote,2,Fri Jun 12 03:29:09 2015 UTC,"I would like to see him play with Dempsey and Martins. Maybe we don't need that much offense, but I would be curious to see how it would work out. It will inject some pace into the offense and make our attack even stronger. It would be something to experiment on at least. Morris has already proven himself to be valuable when hes on the field against the best teams in the world and I think pairing him with Dempsey and Martins will make him even better with the creative play making."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,cj1735,-1,Fri Jun 12 00:45:40 2015 UTC,Lol if you think Morris will ever suit up for the Rave Green. It's a long shot at this point IMO

Morris says he wants to sign with the Sounders and I believe him. He's stuck to his guns this far without deviating.
SoundersFC,39fqkz,cj1735,-2,Thu Jun 11 19:15:32 2015 UTC,Yedlin had one full year in the MLS and went to Tottenham mostly on his play from the National Team
SoundersFC,39fqkz,john_mcrotten,6,Thu Jun 11 19:21:02 2015 UTC,2 full years in MLS but I understand your point. I think Morris will do at least one season with the Sounders before going overseas.
SoundersFC,39fqkz,SvanirePerish,8,Thu Jun 11 20:16:39 2015 UTC,"Yes, but that was from the World Cup, it's a little different than friendlies. But I do think lading with us is the most likely scenario."
SoundersFC,39fqkz,bwc_28,5,Thu Jun 11 23:59:07 2015 UTC,He'll probably get a couple season in MLS before shipping off overseas.
SoundersFC,39fqkz,toostrongjones,3,Thu Jun 11 19:34:18 2015 UTC,"My view on Morris is that he's a young man with an astonishing level of conviction.  He plays at Stanford because he values education and thinks that's best for him. He doesn't have to stay - he has a contract from us and probably could have one in Europe if Klinsmann made a few calls - but he did.  I don't think playing for the Sounders is going to be a negative for Klinsmann. I mean, he's getting capped while at Stanford, why wouldn't he continue to be capped if he chose us?   He says he's going to be a Sounder and if the Sounders offer what he's worth, I think he will be. I don't think he cares if other people think he should go abroad. Judging from his playing another year at Stanford, caring what other people think isn't a big concern of his."

I don't know why I was so optimistic. The PK call in the Canada v. China game was clear. This was two guys jumping for a 50/50 ball and they landed awkwardly. Horse. Shit.  But this just adds to the discussion about the quality of MLS Officiating. What I wouldn't give to see MLS and BPL refs swap staff for a season. I'd settle for a month long loan. It's probably a better business model to have shit-for-brains terapods roaming the fields in yellow generating controversy that can be packaged and monetized."
SoundersFC,3966kc,Immolater,4,Wed Jun 10 00:30:04 2015 UTC,"Too be fair, Dwyer did the to the ball first, but I don't think that makes it worthy of a penalty. But Frei had possession of it before contacting Dwyer."
SoundersFC,3966kc,nikdahl,12,Wed Jun 10 00:17:48 2015 UTC,"He got to the ball the same way any goal scorer gets his shot blocked. He headed it. Frei blocked it before touching Dwyer. It's not a penalty, ever. If he went through Dwyer to get the ball, then it's a penalty.   Even Sounders fans who are referees are trying to justify it, and it's not possible. This whole issue is dividing fans who know the rules of the game and those who don't.   I realize this is coming across as though you think it's a penalty, and that isn't what I intended to do. We are in agreement."

SoundersFC,395xr7,BanksKnowsBest,4,Tue Jun 9 14:17:39 2015 UTC,"In English via google translate-  Despite the thaw between the US and Cuba, Osvaldo Alonso may not play in your selection  FutbolMLS.com | June 9, 2015 | 9:49 a.m.  Univision.com Ozzie Alonso defected from Cuba in 2007. The resumption in relations between the US and Cuba now exceed six months, but still not unlock the situation of the Cuban wheel of Seattle Sounders, Osvaldo Alonso, who may not be part of the next Gold Cup, to be played in the United States since 7 to 26 of July.  According to sources they tell Havana FutbolMLS.com the former captain of the Cuban team still could represent their country, nor could play for the US  ""My dream was to play with Cuba, have a normal life like any other player that goes with your choice and then returns to the club, but Cuba can not,"" Alonso admitted in April 2013 in a podcast interview with the Free Throw Radio of FutbolMLS.com. Alonso reached US after defecting from the Cuban national team, while playing the 2007 Gold Cup.  In that communication with Freekick 2013, Ozzie Alonso, a US citizen since 2012, said his agent had submitted a letter of intent to FIFA to change the membership and represent the US, but I needed the ""liberation"" of the Cuba Football Association (AFC).  Before a new appeal this week FutbolMLS.com , Alonso would not comment considering that his word would not help the current situation. The steering wheel understands that ending the embargo and the change of mentality between the two countries may take more time than six months.  Visit the New York Cosmos of the NASL (North American second division) to Havana was seen to the world as a historic match, but as explained from the island was more about promotion than reality. Alonso players still have the closed door of the selection, as the ACF does not forget or forgive.  FREEDOM IN THE SUPERMARKET   was June 2007. Time Gold Cup in Houston. Alonso and scorer Lester Moré decided to leave the team and seek asylum in the US Alonso was the captain and the most important player on the team and decided to desert his team and his country.  Everything happened in a Walmart, while his companions chose unknown products off the shelves. Surreptitiously he left the supermarket with few belongings in his backpack and $ 700 that hid his clothes.  ""The most difficult moment of my career was when I left the selection of Cuba,"" he said the current central midfielder Seattle Sounders in an interview with Marca, in October 2013. ""We lacked a group match, but it was something that already I had in mind, although it has cost me enough at the time. ""  The player then 21 years old and wanted in US the future, he considered, would have in Cuba. The sports policy in Cuba budget leaves little football, a sport that is not among the favorites of their population. He managed and paid $ 100 to a Mexican who sold him a bus ticket to Florida, where a friend would help him.  He traveled a day and half, cried and cried. At destination he called his parents to tell them his decision and continued crying. After a year and a day after stepping on American soil, Alonso benefited from the ""Cuban Adjustment Act"" and could regularize their immigration status to obtain a residence permit. With the papers, he went to his first professional contract.  The first stop was the Charleston Battery, a team of the USL (third division) in South Carolina. It was noted immediately and was the final of the US Open Cup in 2008 against DC United, which allowed him to jump to the MLS, which now shines as a cornerstone and franchise Sounders.  Despite its quality and international experience, will not take place in the Cuban team that will play next Gold Cup. Alonso is on a list of players that ""indiscipline"" committed and coach Raul Gonzalez Triana unusable.  It belongs to the group of ""legionnaires"" including deserters US players and Germany. While in recent years the government of Raul Castro took steps to open up to the world of sports, football is not part of that universe.  Since 2013 ""recruiting athletes by foreign professional leagues"" was authorized. Although the opening was only heading to Japan, Canada and Mexico with baseball players, as indicated by sources from Havana to FutbolMLS.com.  Also in baseball - the highest passion of Cubans - there were changes in TV programming. Last month was broadcast on national television a game of Major League Baseball (MLB) that had as attractive deserter Kendrys Morales playing for the Kansas City Royals.  In football history it seems different because the Cuban leadership takes as staff every issue.  ""The doors are closed and remain closed, the mentality required to open them has not arrived yet, continue with the same dinosaurs, with the same prehistoric minds even today maquillen always with new laws broken and unfulfilled promises,"" writes the journalist Mario Lara , which follows the pulse of the Cuban soccer through his blog Football-Cubano.  For Lara, ""beyond everything that is going on right now between the two countries within the Cuban Federation Alonso it is still seen in the same way that five years ago, no change in that.""  No policy changes the football authorities in Havana, which according to Lara, do not even consider the possibility of using Cuban players who have left the country through legal means. ""Less is there for Alonso, who left the national team in an international tournament. Neither do with children of Cuban residents abroad, which would result, in my opinion, the possible convening of Alonso and other Cuban players on USL ""explains Lara from Miami.  From the ACF they did not answer calls or respond to emails FutbolMLS.com . There was also no luck trying to contact the consulate of Cuba in New York.  Alonso acknowledges that strange culture and Cuban food and that people in Seattle is very different to that of Havana. Eight years after the decision in a supermarket and watching the path, Ozzie is proud of his decision, although this would have cost eight years without selection.  ""Many people took it well, another badly, but I do not care. It is my decision and I do not care what people think. My mom supports me, my father supported me, my wife supports me, that's what matters, ""he explained Ozzie in 2013.  In Cuba, few football fans will not push for Alonso nor follow the CONCACAF competition. The television is tuned only to see Real Madrid, Barcelona, ​​clubs in the Premier League or a Copa Libertadores match.  While waiting for the authorities to give opening, will then, the future of many Cubans proud to wear the shirt of a selection, and perhaps, the Cuban football.  © futbolmls.com"

SoundersFC,38v5sn,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sun Jun 7 03:20:58 2015 UTC,"this may be a dumb question, but isn't the position of the last defender the ultimate decider, and not whether neagle was behind the ball or not?"
SoundersFC,38v5sn,lordcorbran,6,Sun Jun 7 04:39:29 2015 UTC,"It's either-or.  You are not in offside position if you are   behind midfield, OR behind the ball, OR behind at least two players from the opposing team (usually the goalkeeper is one of these two).   Neagle was behind the ball, so he was not in offside position.  Incidentally, as an academic curiosity - it is difficult to tell from the replay but it is possible the Sporting defender who slid to try and intercept the pass got a slight touch on it before it reached Neagle. If he did, then it wouldn't even have mattered whether or not Neagle was in offside position. Sliding to intercept a pass and touching the ball counts as a deliberate play on the ball (even if the ball doesn't go where you intended it to), and there is no offside if you are receiving the ball off a deliberate play from an opponent. Kind of a weird interpretation that FIFA has been pushing for the last couple years."

SoundersFC,38otgn,joechoj,5,Fri Jun 5 16:45:20 2015 UTC,I think the discrepancy has to do with the CLink construction that was going on earlier in the season. Some sections were blocked off because of it. Now the construction is done so those seats can be sold.
SoundersFC,38otgn,PeteyNice,2,Fri Jun 5 18:33:15 2015 UTC,"Doubtful, as we haven't opened up the full stadium yet this season and those sections are off in the south endzone."
SoundersFC,38otgn,radeky,9,Fri Jun 5 18:51:55 2015 UTC,"And they are available to buy for games now which they were not earlier in the season. The lower 300s in the South Endzone are part of the regular stadium capacity, not expanded. These are the sections that were unavailable earlier in the season.   In fact, I am almost positive that is what it is. The difference between 39,571 and 39,115 is 456. Each of the lower 300 sections in the South Endzone is open as 4 rows x 19 seats each so 76 seats each, so six sections == 456. 318-323 IIRC is what was closed off. So there you go."
SoundersFC,38otgn,PeteyNice,6,Fri Jun 5 18:57:04 2015 UTC,"Good lord, that's some Hardy Boys-level sleuthing! I had a feeling there was good local knowledge I could tap into here, but ""Great Scott!""  So your explanation would be that they started the season with a capacity of 39,115, achieved a sellout in Week 2, then expanded to 39,571 later? Sounds plausible to me. Thanks."
SoundersFC,38otgn,PeteyNice,4,Fri Jun 5 19:26:58 2015 UTC,Yes. Capacity early in the season was limited because of stadium construction. Once the construction was complete - I don't know exactly when that was but well after Week 2 - capacity expanded to include the seats that had been blocked off.
SoundersFC,38otgn,radeky,2,Fri Jun 5 19:31:30 2015 UTC,"So, not trying to be a dick but I have some questions about this theory.  1) Why would you open up seats in the south endzone when you still have multiple mid-field sections you could open?  2) Those seats were still not open during the two games last week."
SoundersFC,38otgn,PeteyNice,3,Fri Jun 5 20:28:34 2015 UTC,"1) The lower 300s are always open all around the stadium. See seating chart here: http://www.soundersfc.com/tickets/season-ticket-members/seating-chart  2) I don't know if they were or were not, I was not looking."
SoundersFC,38otgn,radeky,2,Fri Jun 5 20:36:53 2015 UTC,"Oh!  Got it, the 300 sections around the bottom.  Somehow I forget about them.  Ignore me then."
SoundersFC,38otgn,stealth_sloth,3,Fri Jun 5 20:57:28 2015 UTC,"This press release from March 16th (two days after the match in question) says the Sounders expanded capacity to 39,115 this season.  So it looks like we have dueling press releases by the Sounders."

SoundersFC,38otgn,alexfrancisburchard,2,Fri Jun 5 20:20:43 2015 UTC,"Ticket sales =/= attendance.  All tickets were likely sold for the game, but not everyone showed up."
SoundersFC,38otgn,alexfrancisburchard,3,Fri Jun 5 16:59:07 2015 UTC,"That doesn't explain it. They report tickets sold as attendance, not actual attendance."
SoundersFC,38otgn,radeky,0,Fri Jun 5 17:24:45 2015 UTC,"I think the sounders report the number of tickets they scan at the gate, not the number sold. but I could be wrong.  If they reported tickets sold, we'd always have the number of fans that is our capacity, but it fluctuates by up to a thousand every week because I'm pretty sure that's not how they report."
SoundersFC,38otgn,radeky,3,Fri Jun 5 17:54:23 2015 UTC,"But it fluctuates upward from listed capacity, not downward.  If it worked they way you said, if I follow you, we'd see people who had bought tickets being turned away because the stadium had reached capacity. They wouldn't do that.  My assumption (because this is how most large-venue clubs operate) was that they chose as their capacity a number they were confident they could hit every week. This has no bearing on actual capacity, and they'll continue to sell as many seats as they can, which is why reported attendance can exceed listed capacity.  I could be wrong too; all my speculation is ignorant of stadium configuration (upper vs lower capacity & how often upper is opened)."
SoundersFC,38otgn,radeky,0,Fri Jun 5 20:18:47 2015 UTC,I've seen it fluctuate downwards many times in the last 6 years.

SoundersFC,38o8z7,RoboticMustache,4,Fri Jun 5 16:06:05 2015 UTC,"According to Henderson, Thomas will be playing on the wings mostly, so I think that pushes Neagle even further off the depth chart on the wings and midfield. I think he can only hope to get playing time in CCL/USOC and as a forward when players are out, like this weekend."
SoundersFC,38o8z7,MowwMoww,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:38:53 2015 UTC,I tend to agree with you on quite a few things lol. I prefer Neagle up top. And maybe if Barrett didn't score those two goals a few weeks ago he would've been pushed further up the chart for the forward position. But at this point it won't look good for him. He's just too inconsistent on the wing.
SoundersFC,38o8z7,MowwMoww,5,Fri Jun 5 14:55:17 2015 UTC,"Despite all of my disdain for Neagle, I can still recognize that he provides some value as a striker. It's where he has been most consistent and maybe he can score some goals this weekend."
SoundersFC,38o8z7,CougFanDan,1 point,Fri Jun 5 14:59:12 2015 UTC,"My only concern about Neagle as a striker is that, similar to Barrett, he doesn't seem to be able to create plays for himself, a skill that Oba and Dempsey excel at. He has to rely on others creating the plays for him, which makes him more of a finisher than a creative striker"

SoundersFC,38kddg,alexj757,2,Thu Jun 4 20:41:31 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see Neagle with either Mansaray or Jones up top if Deuce, Oba, Barrett are all out."

SoundersFC,38kddg,canucknuckles,3,Fri Jun 5 16:33:44 2015 UTC,We'll be lucky to field 11 players at the rate they're dropping out. :(
SoundersFC,38kddg,jaschac,3,Thu Jun 4 23:51:11 2015 UTC,They could pull a KC and just stack the back hoping for a 0-0 draw.

SoundersFC,38kddg,rophel,2,Thu Jun 4 23:54:14 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Roldan and Rose paired up in the middle with Kovar and Pappa on the wings but I doubt we will be that experimental.

SoundersFC,38kaki,pinkal_peaches,8,Thu Jun 4 19:49:03 2015 UTC,I'd be curious to look at out strength of schedule compared to everyone else to see if 2ppg stands up.
SoundersFC,38kaki,doublemazaa,4,Thu Jun 4 20:25:34 2015 UTC,"Our schedule gets harder from here on out. I didn't look at everyone else, but our opponents so far this year have a (weighted) average of 1.22 PPG across all matches; our remaining opponents have a weighted average of 1.43 PPG. Plus we have 10 home matches to 11 road matches remaining, as well as CCL competition coming up. And we can hope for additional fixture congestion from USOC as well.  We've also been relatively injury-free so far this season. No really serious long-term injuries at all, and not many unpredictable minor injuries as well compared to most of the league (of course Pineda continues to miss matches with his ankle issues, but that's just a known issue). There's no particular reason to think that our health will stay this good as the season goes on.  Matching last year's 64 points would be a really excellent result from our current position, and is a realistic high ambition."
SoundersFC,38kaki,stealth_sloth,3,Fri Jun 5 04:51:30 2015 UTC,Great post. Thank you.   Does our opponents PPG you mentioned include Sounders games or not? I think you'd need to remove our matches from their schedules for a fair comparison.
SoundersFC,38kaki,doublemazaa,2,Fri Jun 5 05:47:23 2015 UTC,"It does include Sounders games; if you removed those, our opponents so far would be averaging more like 1.25 PPG instead of 1.22 (and our opponents for the rest of the season would also be averaging slightly higher, although I don't know how much)."
SoundersFC,38kaki,stealth_sloth,2,Fri Jun 5 08:08:01 2015 UTC,"While its great we are at this point, the season is very long. A lot of soccer is left to be played and now the Sounders are hitting a spot where literally almost anything that could take a player out has happened (injury, suspension, national team duty, child birth!). I'm hopeful our depth is sufficient to keep the Sounders going, but I can't help but remain cautiously optimistic."

SoundersFC,38kaki,IGetNoSlack,1 point,Fri Jun 5 09:23:59 2015 UTC,"I suppose that, size adjusted, 13 games isn't as insignificant a number as it should be. Regardless, 2 PPG is great.   However, SKC have beenin good form even with the injuries, with 8 points over their last 5 games. Both FCD and the Quakes have endured at least 1 loss in their last five games, and FCD in particular have not been doing well as of late, with a 2-match losing streak. The Union have been...spotty, and with the Timbers anything is up for grabs. Then comes DCU in what could (?) be an MLS Cup final preview.   They'll have no trouble with the Fire (of my hometown) however.   TL;DR 2 PPG is good, but can they keep it up?"
SoundersFC,38hvwa,tennisgoalie,21,Thu Jun 4 09:16:25 2015 UTC,"Last season I was driving the Frei-ze, I was not a fan. His early fumbles last season really shook my faith in him and made me think we had made a major mistake.  Towards the end of last season he was turning me around and I came to really respect him in the net.  Now...  Now... I love that Swiss bastard."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,trickjarrett,5,Thu Jun 4 16:41:48 2015 UTC,"Here is one metric that suggests the best keeper in the league this season has been Hamid. (Although I'd note that I have a few quibbles with the methodology that site uses for expected goals; here is the one I prefer, but it is out-of-date and only through May 10th).  Our defense has been letting teams take plenty of shots from 25-30 yards out, but been almost totally lights-out at denying shots from within 20 yards of goal. That's a vote of confidence in Frei. If our team didn't know that he'd be totally solid on long range shots, they would be working harder to prevent those shots in the first place - which means we'd be giving up at least a few more close-range shots as a consequence.  But it's also a sign that purely in shot-stopping, Frei has not had the biggest impact on his team of any keeper in MLS so far. Because most of the shots he has stopped have been ones that any MLS keeper ought to stop. He's been very consistent, and had a few amazing saves scattered in there - I'm absolutely not saying he's played badly. Just that it's not clear that he's played like the best keeper in the league."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,stealth_sloth,14,Thu Jun 4 13:02:22 2015 UTC,It's a long shot to call anyone the best in the league...but it's cool how much Frei has grown. I'm really proud of him!  He's a huge part of how we've managed to stay such a fiercely competitive team.
SoundersFC,38hvwa,Dai_Kaisho,7,Thu Jun 4 15:45:39 2015 UTC,"I guess his passes could be better. >_>  He has been playing very solid and more importantly, consistently this season.  ""Best GK"" is a difficult one to categorize."

SoundersFC,38hvwa,sp_the_ghost,2,Thu Jun 4 19:29:39 2015 UTC,Hard to say his distribution is bad when the past 10 games we have had a heavy influence on playing out of the back.
SoundersFC,38hvwa,MowwMoww,5,Thu Jun 4 19:58:22 2015 UTC,"His medium and long-range kicking is pretty terrible, I don't think anybody really disputes this."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,sp_the_ghost,2,Thu Jun 4 20:46:11 2015 UTC,"I dispute this. Nick Rimando is known as a fantastic long-passer and arguably the best in the league and has been touted as such by many national commentators. His passing completion % is only 8% higher than Frei's.   In fact, only two people on the list above are better passers this year: Ousted and Rimando.   So yes, it is disputed, and it's simply false."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,MowwMoww,2,Thu Jun 4 20:52:17 2015 UTC,How many of Rimando's long kicks out go straight into touch?
SoundersFC,38hvwa,sp_the_ghost,0,Thu Jun 4 20:53:14 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I'm sure with some research you could find this information."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,MowwMoww,2,Thu Jun 4 20:53:46 2015 UTC,"To be honest I don't really care. I know what I see - Frei isn't accurate enough with his long passes, to the point that a not insignificant number of them fly straight into touch. He's a really good goalkeeper otherwise and is more than adequate for this team. His improvements have been clear for all to see, but his medium and long-range distribution hasn't kept up.  Also, pass completion rate... I'd like to see those statistics if you have them to hand."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,sp_the_ghost,2,Thu Jun 4 20:58:06 2015 UTC,"http://www.whoscored.com/  Research to your heart's content.  ""Eye test"" doesn't exist in professional soccer when you have sufficient statistics to refute that."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,MowwMoww,4,Thu Jun 4 21:07:39 2015 UTC,"Well, that's completely inaccurate, but whatever floats your boat. The eye test is totally valid in a sport that is so difficult to quantify.  Oh and per these statistics Frei is 7th of 13 among goalkeepers with 10 or more appearances in ""inaccurate long balls"" which still doesn't tell you nearly enough information to be useful."
SoundersFC,38hvwa,sp_the_ghost,0,Thu Jun 4 21:26:00 2015 UTC,"7th among 13, and to you he's terrible. Get a grip, man. Stop looking for ghosts. You saw something, stats proved it wrong. Just move on on."
SoundersFC,38e6ac,turneresq,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"I think attendance will need to get a little better before the team will make a push to further open up the upper deck.  Ticket sales are good, but I see a good number of empty seats at many games. It's not barren or anything, but I think consistently getting 35K+ butts in seats will signal that there's enough demand to start selling more seats.  The other indicator I've noticed is that it seems that the ticket resale market seems soft. Unless it's a big game, volume can be stagnant on the resale sites seems low."
SoundersFC,38afah,Schwa142,10,Tue Jun 2 22:54:21 2015 UTC,I'm disappointed at every game Oba doesn't play in because I want to see him shatter single-season goal records this year.

Yeah yeah ""play to win"" always but a road game against a team at near-full strength while missing most of your starters is going to be tough, so why not develop some depth?"

SoundersFC,388fcb,zanycomet,5,Tue Jun 2 16:15:18 2015 UTC,Guess we can start with the basics: Strengths? Weaknesses? Thanks for stopping by.
SoundersFC,388fcb,clickmyface,17,Tue Jun 2 16:47:11 2015 UTC,"No problem! I'm currently living in Montreal and follow MLS so I saw the news on that sub.   He's interesting because he was a part of our most promising youth squad since the 90s, in 2011. He wasn't the most promising in that team but he was pretty solid and his development seemed to be going better than most if not all of his colleagues, even if his ceiling seemed to be only in the average range of the group.   But the whole group sort of fizzled out and never really made the transition from promising to actually good. He spent some time in the senior side where he was a decent sub option but never really good enough to challenge for a starting spot, so he got loaned out to a few other teams, where he was good but never really exceptional, and apparently had some motivation issues (which he never showed at Flamengo, he was a very hard worker with us).   As a player he can play as a winger or an attacking midfielder, I personally think he's better in the latter position. His dribbling is decent and so is his crossing, but he's too slow to excel on the wing in my opinion. He has good passing too and good control in tight areas, which I think favours a midfield position. His shooting is pretty shit though, and his vision is exceptionally mediocre, which is limiting, but he's alright overall.   Not sure whether he's good enough to start for you guys (haven't seen the Sounders play since the playoffs last year), but I think he'd be a pretty solid depth option and maybe can make a real impact and break into the first eleven if he can get motivated and string a few good appearances together (he's a very sort of streaky player, if he gets rolling he can be quite good but if he gets into a slump its hard for him to get out, which is what happened at AAPP)"
SoundersFC,388fcb,vuduwastaken,3,Tue Jun 2 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"I think he could start in the XI based on two conditions:   As a winger, if he has good creativity and spot on service. As a CM, if he is creative OR if he has good hold up play."
SoundersFC,388fcb,vuduwastaken,4,Tue Jun 2 17:09:13 2015 UTC,"His creativity is kinda mediocre, at least for Brasileirao standards, but he's pretty good at holding up play. As an attacking midfielder expect him to run at defenses, not set up plays (sort of like a shitter Kaka or Ronaldinho rather than a shitter Pirlo or Zidane)  His finishing used to be poor but it might have improved. I doubt it though, he's never really scored much even when he was in good patches. Don't expect him to score himself, he's better when coming at the defense and laying it off or when he receives the ball with his back to the goal"
SoundersFC,388fcb,SvanirePerish,2,Tue Jun 2 17:15:34 2015 UTC,I just a watched a bit of his highlight real and I think he'll slot in as a backup to Pappa/Neagle/Rose/Pineda.
SoundersFC,388fcb,vuduwastaken,3,Tue Jun 2 17:22:21 2015 UTC,"We're developing Roldan for those type of positions, but more the merrier."
SoundersFC,388fcb,Nekokeki,2,Tue Jun 2 23:38:28 2015 UTC,I agree. I think our Roldan is slightly below him on development though.
SoundersFC,388fcb,KineticDiabetic,0,Wed Jun 3 00:16:32 2015 UTC,Would you compare him to Charles N'Zogbia?
SoundersFC,388fcb,KineticDiabetic,2,Tue Jun 2 18:53:52 2015 UTC,"Don't know enough about N'Zogbia, sorry"
SoundersFC,388fcb,vuduwastaken,4,Tue Jun 2 19:00:26 2015 UTC,Do you think he is good enough to play in Brazil or did he go to the Sounders because they are closer to his level? Going off that do you think he will have success in the MLS/walk into our first 11 or will he need some time to adapt?
SoundersFC,388fcb,KineticDiabetic,9,Tue Jun 2 16:57:34 2015 UTC,"I think he would be good enough to play for side outside the Big 12 in Brazil if he got motivated. One of this bigger problems apparently is that this is hard for him, but that never really was a problem when he was at Flamengo, only when he was out on loan, so who knows.   I don't think he'll just walk into your starting team but I can definitely see him break into it if he gets a good run going, since he's kinda streaky like that. Being able to play both as an attacking mid and a winger could definitely help, but if I'm not mistaken y'all don't really use winger right? (could be very wrong about this)  He definitely has potential to be good for you guys but he could also fail miserably, depends on whether he can get motivated and on whether he can get a few good performances together."
SoundersFC,388fcb,ragingpandaberr,2,Tue Jun 2 17:10:55 2015 UTC,Thanks for the insight! Seems like an exciting addition although I'm not the biggest fan of streaky players. But it looks like he has versatility and talent which should help the squad. I think I'd prefer him playing on the wing as Neagle and Roldan can be a bit frustrating but it sounds like he could also be a good foil to Alonso who's  more defensively minded. Hopefully he can grow mentally and be an  important player for us!
SoundersFC,388fcb,k_princess,2,Tue Jun 2 17:34:01 2015 UTC,he's been practicing with the team for a while now.
SoundersFC,388fcb,adillen,2,Tue Jun 2 17:09:43 2015 UTC,Yeah. I remember reading that but it doesn't necessarily mean he is good enough or prepared to have an important role in the team. Either way OP already answered pretty much all of my questions and I'm excited to see him in his first few appearances!
SoundersFC,388fcb,Wineguy33,2,Tue Jun 2 17:13:49 2015 UTC,"How's his defensive work rate?  There have been good, offensive minded midfielders on this team in the past that have been put in the dog house if their defensive work rates weren't up to the coach's standards, so I hope he's used to tracking back.  My main concern is how he fits into the team.  Sigi has never really been a coach to use an attacking center mid which means the position you say he would be most suited is not the one he will likely be put into.  This leaves him as a wing option (which makes another without much pace on the team) and if he doesn't track back regularly, he probably won't see much playing time.    Here's to hoping that he exceeds those expectations and plays better than your description and his youtube highlight reel, but we've seen some really good offensive mids come and go through the years and I'm hoping he doesn't fall into the ""go"" camp too soon."

SoundersFC,385fue,hopefulmachines,21,Tue Jun 2 00:00:04 2015 UTC,"The important thing to note is that he's actually been training with us for weeks. So, we could see him as soon as our next match."
SoundersFC,385fue,Nekokeki,6,Tue Jun 2 00:30:43 2015 UTC,In the Pineda spot? Or Neagles? Where does he fit?
SoundersFC,385fue,steerbell,0,Tue Jun 2 00:45:01 2015 UTC,Pineda's spot more than likely!
SoundersFC,385fue,RutzPacific,8,Tue Jun 2 00:52:39 2015 UTC,"It could be either one, realistically. Thomás is strongest on his right foot, but looks fairly comfortable with his left as well. He's played a lot on the left side and both cut inside and also occasionally gone down the line and crossed with his left, but he's also played from the right side and sometimes come through the middle.   It could be that he's utilized a great deal at first as a compliment to Pappa on the opposite wing, with the two free to swap sides as our wings have done so far. It could be that as Pineda slows down, Thomás starts playing through the middle in his place, or it could be that Roldan plays in the middle in that situation and Thomás plays outside.  Or perhaps most exciting of all, they all build up a level of comfort with each other in which they're all able to swap positions fluidly throughout the game as well as afford the club a fantastic bit of depth and flexibility in the midfield. I like this one best I think :)"

SoundersFC,385fue,XORosaurus,4,Tue Jun 2 01:21:51 2015 UTC,I think we signed a Brazilian to S2 recently too.  Edit: S2 recently signed Sergio Mota
SoundersFC,385fue,francostine,2,Tue Jun 2 02:56:46 2015 UTC,"Well, the kits are all handled/printed/laundered together, so that's not as much an indication of placement really. He's been training with the first team for a few weeks now and will be training with them at least tomorrow as well- which also isn't necessarily a sign one way or another - but there's been no announcement of a loan to S2 yet either.  So I'm leaning towards first team but with a splash of ""who knows""."

SoundersFC,385fue,Nekokeki,3,Tue Jun 2 05:23:56 2015 UTC,"Looks to me like he could play anywhere across the attacking line, in behind Dempsey and Martins  Seems to have some very good speed and likes to dribble, so I could see him on the wing as well. Not sure about his crossing ability, so he may fit better at cutting in and shooting/creating, which fits our style better anyways and allows the fullback to get forward.  Based on what I have seen from Andy Rose (who I like as a player), he would be an upgrade and would bring a similar game, but more playmaking ability. He like to run with the ball similar to Neagle but has a bit more skill on the ball.  Bottom line is, I think he could be an immediate upgrade and partnered with Oba, Clint and Pappa, our attack could be unreal. I see even more goals coming.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvKn7_vrznw"

SoundersFC,385wf8,Audicity,7,Tue Jun 2 02:01:22 2015 UTC,"So what do we do with Correa? We haven't seen him even as a sub yet (at least it doesn't come to my knowledge that he has).   He has been injured since he got here essentially. He was starting every S2 match but has since been injured since week 2 or 3.    Today we now have Thomás in addition to our roster. Does this look like the more permanent replacement for Pineda?    Honestly I'll have to see him play first, as I haven't really looked into him. That being said, I imagine him as a Roldan-type player that can play the wings or in Pineda's position. I think Pineda may retire although im sure a lot of teams would still value him.   Our right wing; Neagle or Roldan?    Tossup for me. Roldan has shown some pretty great flashes of brilliance but Neagle can produce ~5 goals a year consistently, so I think it's just a numbers game. If Roldan can put one in or get an assist in the coming weeks then I definitely see him as the future -- I mean we already see him as the future, but it'll be icing on the cake.    The Brad Evans CB experiment.    It's hard to argue with numbers. I still see many mistakes from him (and Marshall as well, which is scary), but you can't argue that it hasn't worked out statistically.   Goalkeeper.    I think Frei is here for the long term. I don't see any MLS team splashing cash for a top tier goalkeeper until the cap is 10x larger than what it is, and he is perfectly capable. The scary thing is that we don't really have a good backup at this point. Perkins is good but he doesn't get game time and Lyon isn't an MLS quality goalkeeper."
SoundersFC,385wf8,MowwMoww,3,Tue Jun 2 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"I'll throw my two cents in on Roldan.  Naturally he is a CM, or at least that is what he tended to play when I watched him at UW last year when I could. In all reality I think as long as he progresses and stays with the team he is Ozzie's replacement. That said, I think we will continue to see him get chances at the right wing as we keep playing this possession based style. As some have mentioned before Neagle tends to put he head down and go straight into people and has a tendency to turn the ball over. Roldan may be smaller but he can be smarter with the ball, or his first idea usually isn't to just go right at someone. While it's a valid argument to say he is to slow for wing I think his ability to keep possession, or at least do a better job than Neagle, he will keep getting those chances,  Then again I am biased because he was dawg."
SoundersFC,385wf8,overruns,2,Tue Jun 2 03:17:41 2015 UTC,"Frei    Mears   Evans   Marshall   Remick                  Alonso  Thomás      Pineda          Pappa         Dempsey                       Oba   Bench: Perkins; Scott, Gonzo; Neagle, Rose; Barrett"
SoundersFC,385wf8,vuduwastaken,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:33:07 2015 UTC,"Thomás I see as a potential signing (as in signed for what he'll bring in the next season), we'll have to see where they start, but I could see him playing S2 for a little bit or subbing him in.  He's a big question mark for me honestly.  Evans has worked quite well as a CB, but it's only made us need more midfielders more.  There is no reason to give Neagle time over Roldan if Roldan is continually improving and fits the current playstyle better. Neagle will always be a great depth option.  Frei is a quality GK, based on stats alone he is top 3 in MLS right I think. He still can improve, but he's good value added.  Given the choice to swap for another GK, I'd still stay with Frei since he's been with the team for a full season."
SoundersFC,384ts0,PeteyNice,7,Mon Jun 1 21:27:23 2015 UTC,"It's been $100 for the past years, just with no waiting list.  You pay the $100/seat, then when you get your seats, they apply the $100/seat towards those season tickets.  Now, since they have sold all lower bowl seats, you have to wait. Not much has changed, really.  The $100/seat keeps the list for people who are interested, and not adding their name for the sake of adding it."

When we get the option to upgrade our seats for next year what can I expect? I'm in the south side of  the stadium ($25 tickets). I want to stay on that side but get closer to the pitch. Can I expect to maybe move a couple rows up next season or farther?
SoundersFC,384ts0,Tjraider35,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:00:48 2015 UTC,"Especially since the entire lower bowl is sold out, it depends entirely on what other season ticket owners decide to do with their seats. Some will move up to the 300 level, and some may not reup, which will leave openings in the lower bowl that you may be able to move into. You'll have to wait and see what everyone else decides to do. Your ticket agent will be able to help you through the process when renewals opens up."
SoundersFC,384ts0,Aurick,1 point,Tue Jun 2 01:09:00 2015 UTC,"Typically you'll select the option when you renew.  It assumes you're renewing your existing seat until a month or so after renewals end. That's when you'll get a notice telling you when your upgrade appointment is.  At that point you'll be able to go online and pick new seats from the available ones around the stadium.  It has a nice graphical interface to pick seats from.  You can also talk to your ticket rep.    If there is a price increase, the entire difference will be due when you select them regardless of how many payments you selected."
SoundersFC,384ts0,planetes,1 point,Tue Jun 2 09:22:11 2015 UTC,"I think this is just posturing, while they still sellout, season ticket renewal isn't that high. Once you are on the past season ticket holders list you will get a call quarterly for you to renew."

SoundersFC,380iff,Sockittoum,-15,Sun May 31 23:15:57 2015 UTC,Not particularly impressed with Barrett putting that in given the offside risk and considering the ball was already half in. Edit: Obviously still happy we won? I don't actually think it's a big deal.
SoundersFC,380iff,francostine,28,Sun May 31 23:25:43 2015 UTC,"You can't be serious. A professional player isn't going to not touch a ball in just because ""it's on its way in."

SoundersFC,380iff,hellobullshit,-2,Sun May 31 23:55:43 2015 UTC,"Stats are a HUGE part of soccer for teams and for player drive wether you think that makes players ""professional"" or not. This is 50% an etiquette thing and 50% worthless offside risk and you genuinely don't see this happen often. Players are also specifically taught not to go after a ball that is ALREADY IN GOAL because you risk offsides being blown.   Don't believe me? Barrett copped to this being unintentional after the game and admitted he created an offside risk. He even said he was going for the post-goal rebound to collect the ball but his timing was off. He planned to touch it after it was in goal."
SoundersFC,380iff,francostine,6,Mon Jun 1 00:06:03 2015 UTC,"Stats are a huge part for a team   I agree, and winning as a team is more important than an individual getting a goal. We're the Seattle sounders, not the Seattle Clint Dempseys"
SoundersFC,380iff,joylongdivision,12,Mon Jun 1 02:15:42 2015 UTC,"Overreaction, yeah? What matters is the ball got put in and we won, Dempsey or anyone else doesn't care who did it."
SoundersFC,380iff,hellobullshit,-1,Sun May 31 23:29:16 2015 UTC,There is a huge offside risk that comes with touches like that. Barrett even admitted he wanted his touch to come later after the ball finished crossing the goal line.
SoundersFC,380iff,joylongdivision,5,Mon Jun 1 00:09:14 2015 UTC,"I'm aware, we've all seen the Nani video. If he was off we'd all be singing a different tune right now.   He wasn't, though, and it's the concept Dempsey or Sigi would be mad at him for tapping that ball in is what I find laughable. Dempsey doesn't give a fuck about stats, and Barrett wasn't going for it because he wanted his goal tally to be +1, he was just making sure it was going in so that we could win, and I don't see why anyone should have an issue with that.   Shit, I should be mad at him for my lost fantasy points from capping Dempsey, but eh. What do you do."
SoundersFC,380iff,LucasAmericano,17,Mon Jun 1 00:16:12 2015 UTC,Was it just me or did Oba look really off today?
SoundersFC,380iff,SvanirePerish,14,Sun May 31 23:15:48 2015 UTC,"First game since breaking his nose, so that could be it."
SoundersFC,380iff,WTF_Bengals,2,Sun May 31 23:40:14 2015 UTC,"I noticed that too. He looked just un-inspired today, or something. Just wasn't seeing the effort I usually see from him."
SoundersFC,380iff,DrunkenRedditMan,2,Mon Jun 1 03:23:33 2015 UTC,Dempsey looked off as well for the first 90 mins as well imo. Skied the ball uncharacteristically multiple times and couldn't link up with Oba as well as usual.
SoundersFC,380iff,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:42:00 2015 UTC,"Dempsey didn't have a great game on Wednesday, either."
SoundersFC,380iff,Audicity,18,Mon Jun 1 17:28:25 2015 UTC,7 points in 8 days. Nice
SoundersFC,380iff,mikejunior211,7,Sun May 31 23:54:05 2015 UTC,"10 points in two weeks, nicer."
SoundersFC,380iff,jaschac,12,Mon Jun 1 01:00:42 2015 UTC,"Back to the top of the league!   Had a feeling Dempsey would grab a game winning goal 1-1 at home. Needed it, team looked tired. First mid-week game Wednesday so I'm not shocked."
SoundersFC,380iff,philwelch,15,Sun May 31 23:17:37 2015 UTC,"A bunch of semi-random thoughts:    Alonso will be suspended/fined for that late kick. I don't think he was being intentional, but it was late, it was rough, and it will cost him (us).  Dempsey seemed pretty quiet most of the game, but came up big when we needed it. I feel like this has been becoming a pattern lately.  He's not perfect, but i prefer seeing Neagle start over some of the alternatives that have been tried.  Lucky not to concede that PK. Even with that handballl a second before, i'd bet 8 out of 10 refs call it.  Two good, skilled teams clashed. Honestly, a 1:1 would have been fair/acceptable (albeit not desirable). Pleased, as always, to walk away with all three. I believe that a lot of the ""poor performance"" complaints are as much as factor of NY coming in with a solid plan, great players and presenting a serious challenge.  Oba' worked too hard and put in too much not to get a goal/assist. Feel bad for him, but love him on the field.  Evans officially ""out with a calf issue"". They're saying it doesn't sound major. Hope he's not going to be down long. I know technically the 'experiment' is still on, but he's been solid back there. I can't see anything other than a significant injury or a major mid-season signing displacing him.  Pappa rolled an ankle and asked to come out apparently. hope it's just a trivial thing. He's too important to our attack.  Then again, both Evans and Pappa will likely be out for international duty in the coming months. So maybe it wouldn't be the worst thing to pick up a knock strong enough to get them scratched, but light enough to get them back working for us..."
SoundersFC,380iff,canucknuckles,8,Sun May 31 23:31:50 2015 UTC,Neagle's biggest weakness is his propensity to lose possession. It's no surprise he's starting less and less now that the Sounders are adopting more of a possession-based gameplan.
SoundersFC,380iff,mmactavish,6,Mon Jun 1 01:47:05 2015 UTC,I was explaining this to someone recently. Neagle was far more valuable in last season's offense that relied a lot on the counter attack.
SoundersFC,380iff,vuduwastaken,6,Mon Jun 1 02:14:49 2015 UTC,"Great points, just wanted to say MLS credits Oba with an assist on Marco's goal."
SoundersFC,380iff,01point21gigawatts,4,Mon Jun 1 04:17:00 2015 UTC,"FYI, Evans was called for national duty so he would have been out for the next couple games anyways.  EDIT: now i finished reading your last point :)"
SoundersFC,380iff,01point21gigawatts,7,Sun May 31 23:57:03 2015 UTC,"I disagree with your first bullet. They didn't play replays of it at the stadium, but it seemed incidental + the player wasn't injured. Therefore, I don't think this will constitute a suspension. I also disagree with your Neagle bullet. Roldan didn't have a great game today, but I'd still rather see him out there. He showed great potential on Wednesday, and I don't think you can really say he's worse than Neagle. I'd rather have him gaining confidence/match experience."
SoundersFC,380iff,TweetsInCommentsBot,5,Mon Jun 1 00:05:44 2015 UTC,I may stand corrected about the Alonso kick. I just found a video of it: https://twitter.com/worldsoccertalk/status/605144644670918656
SoundersFC,380iff,mikejunior211,2,Mon Jun 1 00:14:30 2015 UTC,"@worldsoccertalk   2015-05-31 22:51 UTC  Alonso kicks out at Felipe, referee completely ignores it. #Sounders 1-1 #NYRB 86' [Attached pic] [Imgur rehost]     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]"
SoundersFC,380iff,canucknuckles,4,Mon Jun 1 00:14:36 2015 UTC,Besides he was inches away (or a great save away) of his first MLS goal.
SoundersFC,380iff,01point21gigawatts,5,Mon Jun 1 00:57:56 2015 UTC,"I don't like Roldan on the wing but that's the only place he's going to see first team action right now. He is too slow to chase the long passes and not strong enough to hold up the ball on the touch line. He should be in the middle but with Rose playing well and Pineda eventually coming back, it's the only place we can put him for first team action."
SoundersFC,380iff,canucknuckles,5,Mon Jun 1 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"I agree on the speed and strength, but (at least on Wednesday) he seemed to be a key part in a lot of the chances that were created. He also showed the ability to escape defenders. The guys I sit next to and I have an ongoing bet on how many times per game Neagle is going to dribble directly into a defender."
SoundersFC,380iff,dsn0wman,5,Mon Jun 1 02:31:08 2015 UTC,"Roldan's ability with the ball is why he would be way better in the middle. Little more room to with with instead of having the touch line at your back.   I have a soft spot for Neagle because of his flashes of brilliance and the whole local boy thing but you're right, he puts his head down and goes straight. He has a hard time getting around defenders unless he's around the top of the box and within shooting distance. Plus, when he loses the ball he almost always immediately fouls someone trying to get it back."
SoundersFC,380iff,BBQLays,1 point,Mon Jun 1 03:11:46 2015 UTC,"Neagle is going to dribble directly into a defender.   Or just passing it strait to them. I like him, but the number of bad passes he makes where he just doesn't hit the pass hard enough boggles the mind."
SoundersFC,380iff,MowwMoww,2,Mon Jun 1 17:44:31 2015 UTC,"I disagree about Oba. He looked so off yesterday and made some poor decisions. I'm not a ""he didn't score so he didn't play well"" type of person either - I just think he had a bad game."
SoundersFC,380iff,thegodsarepleased,15,Mon Jun 1 18:55:00 2015 UTC,"Thanks for making this! Really appreciate it.  I'll have to watch the match later, I was asleep =|"
SoundersFC,380iff,WheezyTurtle,13,Sun May 31 23:25:59 2015 UTC,"You're welcome! I said to myself ""Wheres MowwMoww?"" and even checked to see your last comment was 9 hours ago otherwise I would have waited for you. Thanks for all you do here man! <3"
SoundersFC,380iff,hhdslater,4,Sun May 31 23:27:09 2015 UTC,You missed a hell of a game MowwMoww. Worth watching a replay.
SoundersFC,380iff,hey_kool_aid,7,Mon Jun 1 00:24:10 2015 UTC,"Hey guys just wanted to say what a phenomenal game for my sister and I to go to as our first! Thank you to those who gave advice on the premarch, parking and countless others I have lurked on. We will be going to a couple more and we have convinced family to tag along as well!   Overall thank you for everyone's attitudes and the crazy ass but nice ""I've never sat in a game before"" couple that indoctrinated us lol. We were in Sect 117 Seat 17-18 if you were curious!"
SoundersFC,380iff,thegodsarepleased,11,Mon Jun 1 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"Fuck yeah, what a thriller. Aside from that crazy BWP handball followed by a penalty-worthy tackle from Evans cosmic justice moment, I thought the ref did a pretty good job calling the fouls. NY was committing constant yellow-card-worthy infringements, and I think the ref started actually dishing out yellows for them at the appropriate time. I was getting so annoyed all the professional fouling, and as soon as I started saying ""When the fuck is the ref gonna give out some yellows for these"", he started giving out yellows for them. So props to that."
SoundersFC,380iff,moon_monster,5,Sun May 31 23:20:17 2015 UTC,Most exciting nailbiting match of the season.  There should no question now we are the best team in the league now.  Woot.
SoundersFC,380iff,BBQLays,3,Mon Jun 1 03:14:36 2015 UTC,"Oh my god, I still can't believe it."
SoundersFC,380iff,HorribleComments,3,Sun May 31 23:28:44 2015 UTC,WE'RE AT THE TOP OF THE LEAGUE
SoundersFC,380iff,stealth_sloth,3,Mon Jun 1 01:23:24 2015 UTC,Anyone have a gif of that Oba bike into Robles?
SoundersFC,380iff,tuttlebuttle,3,Mon Jun 1 03:51:21 2015 UTC,"Clint and Oba don't seem to be clicking like normal lately.  I was in the Brougham End, it went absolutely nuts. Stoppage wins are delicious high drama."
SoundersFC,380iff,nikdahl,3,Mon Jun 1 04:08:07 2015 UTC,On or off?
SoundersFC,380iff,Contagion21,3,Mon Jun 1 11:32:30 2015 UTC,It's close enough I don't mind it being called onside.
SoundersFC,380iff,emerald09,2,Mon Jun 1 12:44:58 2015 UTC,"Offside. I don't think there's any question about it, frankly. It's close, but it's not ""this is a tie, we'll give it to the runner""-close... He was offside before the free kick was taken, and is even more offside when the actual shot was taken."
SoundersFC,380iff,mikejunior211,2,Mon Jun 1 18:35:53 2015 UTC,"In real time, that's about as close a call as can be made when you consider that all the bodies are moving. But yes, his shoulder is a few inches offside, sure.   and is even more offside when the actual shot was taken.   I'm not sure why you'd even type that out...  The other factor is that the ball was intentionally played by a sounders player in the wall. Based on this years guidance, that could be considered to nullify the offside.   “Under the old law the defender had to clearly have the ball under control and it was obvious it was a deliberate play.  Now, we are told by the International FA Board that if the defender makes a movement towards the ball, even if the ball does not go where it's intended to, then that is regarded as a play, albeit a bad play.”"
SoundersFC,380iff,stealth_sloth,3,Mon Jun 1 18:48:27 2015 UTC,"What a way to end 8 Sounders matches in 8 days! 3 MLS, 1 USL (open cup), and 4 academy matches."
SoundersFC,380iff,EbonPinion,5,Mon Jun 1 15:54:25 2015 UTC,"We are back atop the Supporter Shield Race... I know is probably only me, but I value the SS as much if not more than the MLSCup. It is after all what all leagues around the world consider the champion to be, the standing leader at the end of the tournament."
SoundersFC,380iff,dintclempsey,2,Mon Jun 1 01:06:41 2015 UTC,I want one MLS Cup so everyone can stop bitching about how we've never won a Cup. Then I'm happy to go back to caring more about the Shield than the Cup.
SoundersFC,380iff,EbonPinion,1 point,Mon Jun 1 22:04:21 2015 UTC,"When we get a balanced schedule (read: never), I'll agree. Until then, Cup is King."
SoundersFC,380iff,dintclempsey,4,Mon Jun 1 06:23:43 2015 UTC,"The playoffs aren't balanced either. To me even if unbalanced the best team of the season is the one that finishes first, not a potential 8th place that manages to go on a small streak at the postseason."
SoundersFC,380iff,jaschac,-1,Mon Jun 1 06:40:30 2015 UTC,"If we play LA, arguably the strongest team in the league overall from year-to-year, three times per season, and NYRB (as an example) plays them once, how is the supporters shield any measure of who was best?  The Cup, while not perfect, puts each team in control of their own destiny. Nothing's stopping you from winning it except you. If the east is demonstrably better than the west one year, a good east team can get lost in the shuffle, and lose to a team in the west with a definitively easier schedule."
SoundersFC,380iff,pinkal_peaches,1 point,Mon Jun 1 17:02:23 2015 UTC,"If we play LA, arguably the strongest team in the league overall from year-to-year, three times per season, and NYRB (as an example) plays them once, how is the supporters shield any measure of who was best?   I don't think it's the best measure, but it's a MUCH, MUCH, better measure than the 5th place in the East, 9th overall, going on a 3-5 game winning streak in the playoffs and winning the cup against a team who finished the season #1 and gave it all during the entire season. The fact that a team plays 34 other games against all other teams (regardless of the frequency) and comes out on top is waaaaay more representative of their skill, just by nature of normalization.   The Cup, while not perfect, puts each team in control of their own destiny.   I could say the same about any competition format. Nothing's stopping you from winning the Supporter's Shield except you either.  There is just no possible argument you could make that would convince me that a team who finished the season in 9th place and then goes on to have 3-5 good of lucky games and wins it the Cup against perhaps a team that got an injury for the one game final, has more merit than one who finished #1 after 34 games against everyone a few times.  Would a balanced schedule be better and more ideal? Of course. But in sports, nothing is balanced. Some teams have to travel generally much more and others much less, based on being geographically more central. Some teams have national team call-ups and some don't. Some teams play in worse weather or worse surfaces on a regular basis. You will never achieve total balance in any way, shape, or form in sports. However, being #1 after 34 games is absolutely a better measure of who's better, than being the best after sneaking into the playoffs and playing 3-5 good/lucky matches and maybe getting lucky in the final on penalty kicks or playing against a team with some one-game key injury."
SoundersFC,380iff,EbonPinion,3,Tue Jun 2 19:41:18 2015 UTC,How does a schedule imbalance degrade the supporters shield over the cup exactly? Not following your thought process here. My understanding is that by any possible measure the supporters shield is harder to win.
SoundersFC,380iff,pinkal_peaches,1 point,Mon Jun 1 16:39:09 2015 UTC,"The SS is harder to win, as it requires a strong and consistent performance over the whole season, instead of just a few games at the end of the year.   That said, it's lost a lot of value since we switched to an unbalanced schedule because the teams' performances are no longer being compared in a one-to-one way. Look at who we played last year to win the SS. Now compare it to any other team in the league. They didn't have the same set of games that we did. And if one team plays an ""easy"" team three times, and another team has to play a ""hard"" team three times, is it even a fair award any more? (that's the argument anyway)"
SoundersFC,380iff,EbonPinion,3,Mon Jun 1 19:24:44 2015 UTC,"MLS Cup is just as imbalanced. East doesn't play West until the single game that is the MLS Cup.  I would prefer a true knockout tournament that doesn't split up the conferences.  It can make the MLS Cup very one-sided when the East is doing poorly and the West has three teams that can probably beat the East's winner.  Supporter's Shield is more difficult. You can sandbag pretty hard in the season at strategic times because all you have to do is make it into the playoffs while your time is at full strength. Bruce Arena is a pro at throwing away games so the Galaxy can take the Cup while losing both the Supporter's Shield and Open Cup.  EDIT: I agree though, the way the league treats the season the cup is valued more."
SoundersFC,380iff,jpkjpk,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:49:04 2015 UTC,"But that imbalance only pertains to the team coming in second. As an example, last year, the Sounders may have been better in the playoffs than NER, but they definitively weren't better than LA. It's unbalanced in a balanced way. The team on top is unavoidably the team who performed best in the playoffs. The goals are clear, and reachable for everyone. It can be unfair because of a harder path to the final, but that doesn't matter, because only first place counts."
SoundersFC,380iff,Skuby_Duby_Du,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"That is a good point, there is no prize for second. It does mean that sometimes the conference finals are the better games to watch though.  This happens often in the NFL as well, exciting conference matchups followed by a dull Super Bowl."
SoundersFC,380iff,badkarma765,1 point,Mon Jun 1 19:09:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree that the conference finals in most sports tend to be more exciting, as (good or not so good) the teams tend to be more evenly matched and, more importantly, more familiar with each other's playing-style."
SoundersFC,380iff,Contagion21,2,Mon Jun 1 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"Was at the match. Really fricken awesome. Now that I watch the highlights, were they offsides in the last goal?"
SoundersFC,380iff,philwelch,2,Mon Jun 1 00:35:46 2015 UTC,"Nah, don't think so. Dempsey had 4 RB players in front of him when Mears launched his beauty cross and Barrett seemed to have a body length clearance but it is hard to tell from that angle.   Edit: Just realized you're probably talking about the NYRB goal haha. I'd say close enough to onside, hard to tell from any angle we have."
SoundersFC,380iff,thegraduate,-2,Mon Jun 1 01:31:23 2015 UTC,"Since we always seem to talk about him, I'll say it right away: Brad had a bad game today. Not all that shocked because it happens and NY came with a plan. He'll bounce back and become a solid CB, you can bet on it.   With that out of the way, I thought Oba was quite off today, but not every player has a great game. I honestly thought it was gonna end up as a Red Bull win.   And how about Tyrone Fucking Mears? Absolutely incredible addition to the team; I don't think he had a foot wrong today and contributed with an assist."
SoundersFC,380iff,vuduwastaken,18,Sun May 31 23:20:03 2015 UTC,Were we watching the same game? Brad was motm for me. He prevented so many dangerous situations in the first 30.  He only got subbed off cause he was hurting.
SoundersFC,380iff,bjdm151,5,Sun May 31 23:25:06 2015 UTC,I agree. And if you watch that super dangerous tackle again you can see why he's hurting. BWP was fully wound up to strike that ball but unloaded into the back of Evans' calf. Ouch!
SoundersFC,380iff,john_mcrotten,2,Mon Jun 1 00:07:23 2015 UTC,Brad kept rushing forward out of position and if NYRB noticed in time they could have taken advantage.

SoundersFC,380iff,ajg2345,4,Sun May 31 23:59:13 2015 UTC,Mears definitely had a few big WTF moments towards the end.
SoundersFC,380iff,never-enough-hops,2,Mon Jun 1 00:22:51 2015 UTC,Oba was playing with a broken nose. That will take anyone off of their normal game.

SoundersFC,380mbt,SonOfMechaMummy,33,Sun May 31 23:46:34 2015 UTC,Pappa for me. That first goal got us moving. He had great play on the wings.
SoundersFC,380mbt,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Jun 1 00:01:13 2015 UTC,Pappa for me as well. He stood out to me as the best player on the pitch even before he scored his goal. Well deserved.
SoundersFC,380mbt,Warvanov,3,Mon Jun 1 23:31:49 2015 UTC,"I was consistently impressed by Brad, stoked to see him improving."
SoundersFC,380mbt,weeenis,6,Mon Jun 1 18:53:53 2015 UTC,Pappa for sure.  Always creating. You can make a case for Brad he's really been getting comfortable back there. Roldan looked good at first but then disappeared. Andy Rose didn't have his best game.
SoundersFC,380mbt,redundantdevil,2,Mon Jun 1 00:20:31 2015 UTC,Pappa. Also special mention for Taylor Twellman for calling out FIFA LOL

SoundersFC,3801el,Digita1B0y,0,Mon Jun 1 01:32:58 2015 UTC,"Ya, I hate how we pump in the fake crowd singing. You'd think the leagues largest and loudest crowd could fill in when he raises us the mic."
SoundersFC,3801el,canucknuckles,4,Mon Jun 1 01:43:45 2015 UTC,There is fake singing normally? That is messed up. I didn't even know that. My section sings the whole anthem loud (then again we sing loud the whole game).
SoundersFC,3801el,cwcoleman,5,Mon Jun 1 15:47:20 2015 UTC,I've never heard this fake singing in the 3+ years of going to matches.
SoundersFC,3801el,BugSTi,2,Mon Jun 1 16:05:04 2015 UTC,I've had season tickets for 4 years in the same section. NW corner doesn't sing much so you can hear the pumped in volume. No matter the crowd size (minus full stadium matches) there is a consistent singing level that's not natural.
SoundersFC,3801el,canucknuckles,2,Mon Jun 1 16:17:17 2015 UTC,Could it be the supporters section in real-time pumped in? Or totally fake?
SoundersFC,3801el,cwcoleman,2,Mon Jun 1 17:27:33 2015 UTC,"That's possible but it's too consistent of a tone and volume, which leads me to believe it's fake."
SoundersFC,3801el,canucknuckles,2,Mon Jun 1 17:41:25 2015 UTC,"I'm in the South East and I've never heard fake sound pumped in.  I've only heard the doctor, the crowd and the instrumentals.  Even on quieter days, I haven't heard them add vocals."
SoundersFC,3801el,lojer,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"It's much quieter in the NW corner, far away from ECS. I'm not saying I'm right and you're all wrong, I've just always heard it as fake, pumped in singing. It sounds unnatural. People all around me have agreed and joked about it in the past too."
SoundersFC,3801el,canucknuckles,1 point,Mon Jun 1 18:34:34 2015 UTC,"It is probably crowd mics from the audience being piped back in.   They have the crowd mics for the tv/radio broadcast, so that is my only guess.   Also, the Dr always half sings, and points the mic at the crowd for certain lines, so that may be where the booth is adding in.   This is all speculation as I've never heard it. Seems like the whole stadium always sings at the same level. I don't hear ecs any louder than the rest. I sit in 229, in the SW corner."
SoundersFC,3801el,BugSTi,2,Mon Jun 1 21:25:55 2015 UTC,"I like the trusty Dr.   I grew up in LA going to Doger games, and every game was an American Idol audition. He does it with the focus on the National anthem, vs on him."

SoundersFC,37wug1,Mowjowey,4,Sun May 31 01:46:42 2015 UTC,Where are you coming from? I am pretty sure the bus tunnel will be closed ss well as part of 4th.   You should come down to temple billards around noon and then catch the march to the match an hour before kick off.  http://www.soundersfc.com/matchday/march-to-the-match
SoundersFC,37wug1,theanimusgames,3,Sun May 31 02:05:15 2015 UTC,We're staying at the Sheraton on 6th Ave. I assume it will be madness around here. The march sounds good; will consider that as well.
SoundersFC,37wug1,theanimusgames,6,Sun May 31 02:08:17 2015 UTC,"You guys should just walk down and possibly hit a bar or two along the way, 20 minute walk max."
SoundersFC,37wug1,siradia,3,Sun May 31 02:17:01 2015 UTC,"They are running a free shuttle to make up for light rail not going through the tunnel. If you think that's too far to walk (though I've chosen to do that walk for day games, and it works well), you could take the 97 for free as well. http://metro.kingcounty.gov/alerts/pdf/15-097_LinkShuttle_SODOStaTo_FromCBD.pdf"
SoundersFC,37wug1,mikejunior211,1 point,Sun May 31 05:24:58 2015 UTC,"The Sheraton should offer complimentary shuttle to airport and Clink, but if not, The walk shouldn't take longer than 20 min."
SoundersFC,37wug1,crowdsurfer,3,Sun May 31 07:07:06 2015 UTC,"Kickoff is just after 2...., I'd suggest heading to the March to the Match beforehand. The festivities will start off around 12:30 and the actual match happens at 1"
SoundersFC,37wug1,justmighthaveto,2,Sun May 31 04:06:28 2015 UTC,"The weather should be good for a walk tomorrow so I would recommend that. Maybe stop by a bar or two on the way down. However the SODO area will be crazy tomorrow with people trying to get to both games (decent weather in Seattle will do that) so keep that in mind.   I highly recommend getting to pioneer square early around 1230 or so. Gives you a chance to stop off at a bar, maybe check out the Ninety or the march to the match.  With that early of a kickoff it's perfect to get your morning started with a pint.   Go Sounders!"

This will lead to much traffic and pre-game foot traffic. Plan ahead and give yourself time to push through the madness."
SoundersFC,37tpya,cwcoleman,4,Sat May 30 17:51:02 2015 UTC,"I don't live in Seattle, but every time I visit I go to a game, march to the match, etc. I don't think you'll have any trouble in any bar you go to. It's a top class city with top class people.   I like Fado and Elysian Brewing Company, fwiw."
SoundersFC,37tpya,insultant_,4,Sat May 30 16:51:15 2015 UTC,"Although you likely won't get in a fight over away colors - there are some bars (Fuel, Temple, and Merchants for example) that do not allow away supporters. Just a caution to tell OP to go to 'any bar' - there are some exceptions.      In general - if you aren't one to talk shit and try to start trouble - you won't find trouble. Although there are always the ass hats in every group that want to steal a scarf - so tie yours up and walk away from confrontation."
SoundersFC,37tpya,cwcoleman,5,Sat May 30 17:47:29 2015 UTC,Pyramid and stand in the beer garden. Bring cash. People will be more likely to talk to you and be welcoming. Also there's games and sunshine. Close to stadium. You'll also see some Mariners action since they're playing tomorrow as well.
SoundersFC,37tpya,mcvay206,4,Sat May 30 18:11:22 2015 UTC,"J&M and Central Saloon are historic bars a couple blocks north of the stadium on 1st Ave. Alstadt is a hipper new German bar in that same area. Elysian Fields is a good bet for some local flavor (even though Elysian is now owned by InBev). You might get some jeers or get sung to, but that's what happens when you rock your team spirit out of town. It's all in good fun and I'm sure you guys will have a great time. Be prepared for metal detectors entering the stadium."
SoundersFC,37tpya,downmobileur,1 point,Sat May 30 18:36:52 2015 UTC,Central is a rad spot.  I usually go there before sounders matches to watch other MLS.
SoundersFC,37tpya,VoluntaryAncap,2,Sun May 31 09:13:02 2015 UTC,"I've noticed that the Pyramid beer garden is the go-to bar for away fans in my limited experience. It's filled with mostly casual fans who won't try to make trouble because they're mostly just normal people. I saw a Galaxy couple having a good time last time I went, in fact an NYRB fan will most likely be viewed as more of a novelty than an opposing fan (meaning friendly conversation). Besides Sounders expect to see a lot of Mariners and Indians jerseys tomorrow."

Get to the station at least 20 minutes before to get your tickets and stuff (unless you have an orca card).  From my experience the train doesn't hang around long at each stop.  Just long enough for everyone at the platform to get on. So you'll want to be there on time and ready to get on board.

SoundersFC,37lz8m,mferrell50,22,Thu May 28 16:29:19 2015 UTC,"Completely agreed, Mears has been fantastic. He's a better shut-down defender, though doesn't get up the field or contribute to the attack as much as Yedlin did.  They're very hard to compare head-to-head, but I think that Mears is exactly what we need this year - more experience shutting down opposing forwards, less needed on the attack."

SoundersFC,37lz8m,pemmigiwhoseit,8,Thu May 28 21:40:58 2015 UTC,"I think Yedlin would have made a much better AM than a LB. His defending just wasn't up to par that often, and while he had great speed, he always seemed to be more attacking minded."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,cantbeassed,2,Thu May 28 16:54:55 2015 UTC,yes yes and yes.  this is where i hope to see him on the usmnt
SoundersFC,37lz8m,nemisys1st,3,Thu May 28 17:28:26 2015 UTC,That game when Mears had Kekuta Manneh in his back pocket though :D
SoundersFC,37lz8m,francostine,15,Thu May 28 17:00:38 2015 UTC,"Mears isn't as fast as yedlin, but his soccer intelligence, touch and positioning are a whole lot better. Mears > yedlin all day"
SoundersFC,37lz8m,PubLiic,11,Thu May 28 16:56:20 2015 UTC,"I think Yedlin makes a better winger, Mears is a better defender."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,aquaknox,10,Thu May 28 18:06:54 2015 UTC,"All day today, but maybe not tomorrow. Don't forget that Mears is a seasoned veteran and Yedlin is a kid. Yedlin has better physical tools than Mears and could end up being much better, but Mears is a better player today."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,joylongdivision,12,Thu May 28 19:01:58 2015 UTC,"Last night, and against SKC I would've preferred Yedlin. His overlaps were pretty vital last year in breaking down teams sitting back against us. Even without really receiving the ball, he was making runs to draw out defenders, chasing second balls, and generally making a nuisance out of himself in a way Mears physically can't for 90 minutes.   Pretty much every other game this year I'd prefer Mears though. With Dempsey/Martins/Pappa/Neagle (at their best) going forward we often don't need to get a lot of attack out of our outside backs, and Mears has given us a lot more stability on the right side. He's got a pretty good cross on him as well, and when he has decided to get forward it's usually been at the right time. I seem to remember him getting caught out a bit against New England and San Jose, but I think that was bound to happen as he adjusted to Sigi's weird tactics and Brad at CB.   Honestly, this is the most content I've felt with our defense since the Jeff Parke/James Riley years. We're leading in clean sheets, Frei is playing lights out, and Brad Evans and Dylan Remick are beginning to look like actual defenders. I'm sure it's bound to change at some point what with our age back there, but this is the first Sounders team in a good while where I've been pretty comfortable when we're up 1-0."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,Chuurp,1 point,Thu May 28 18:43:05 2015 UTC,"Exactly, Mears has been awesome, but I was really missing Yedlin when teams started sitting back on us."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,joylongdivision,3,Thu May 28 23:35:35 2015 UTC,"Yup. I was hoping Remick would provide it a bit, but for all of his pace, he doesn't have the attacking positional sense or reckless abandon Yedlin did.   That's fine though. He's improved on defense tenfold since I first watched him for us, and it appears that's what we've focused on coaching for him in the past few years."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,MowwMoww,9,Fri May 29 00:28:31 2015 UTC,"Said this since the time that he got here, Mears is just better. You don't need someone on this team in defense that offers more going forward than he does in defense because of the potency of Clint and Oba. Mears fits in the team better because he is more defensively sound. I love Yedlin and will always support him but if you ask who I'd rather have on my team I'd have a hard time taking Yedlin over Mears.   Also, when Mears does get forward, his crosses are superb."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,steerbell,2,Thu May 28 21:05:04 2015 UTC,You spoke my mind
SoundersFC,37lz8m,BugSTi,7,Fri May 29 03:03:31 2015 UTC,"I do miss Yedlin from a entertainment point of view. I loved his electrifying runs from the back and you could not help but root for the guy. That said Mears is a great guy to have in the back. Smart, consistent and can get forward. Yedlin is fun to watch and root for (And may become a truly fine player) But you can win championships with Mears."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,amateur_simian,3,Thu May 28 18:04:56 2015 UTC,"Like other positions we have depth in, it would likely be a bunch of flip flopping between the two. Both are great in their own way, so I don't think anyone could justify one over the other, 100% of the time."
SoundersFC,37lz8m,Dai_Kaisho,2,Thu May 28 16:41:18 2015 UTC,"The thing is, in MLS, you don't get Mears and Yedlin on the same team.  You're misusing your resources at that point.  So it's not a question of who you start, but who you keep… and the upside of keeping Yedlin is way higher than Mears.  That being said, game to game, last year I would have started Mears a number of times.  But big picture, we were better off having/developing Yedlin."
SoundersFC,37mll7,alexj757,5,Thu May 28 19:01:41 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, to improve, Seattle needs one of three things.  1. A high level CAM who can play defense well enough to not be a detriment when the other team has possession. 2. A upgrade at Centerback to give us a good enough defensive line to not need the second CM to play bucket defensively for large portions of the game. Not that we have a bad defense right now, but a better one would allow different formations. 3. A dead ball specialist who can hit corners and free kicks with accuracy greater than the players currently on the squad. I know a lot of people want a speed winger but I believe we have more than enough depth at winger even if some of them are not speed types. Just my opinion. The team is at the top of the table so really there is not much room to complain. If they have allocation $'s and want a MLS cup this season it might be wise to find a possible upgrade in the Summer if possible though."
SoundersFC,37mll7,Wineguy33,6,Thu May 28 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"As you said, we're sitting at the top of the table. The offensive system in place is working. There's no reason to mess with a good thing."
SoundersFC,37mll7,Warvanov,2,Thu May 28 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Look who scored most of the goals though, when oba was gone we struggled to even get attempts on goal"
SoundersFC,37mll7,francostine,2,Fri May 29 19:10:15 2015 UTC,We might have to wait a year or two but Pablo Rossi has looked promising as a dead ball specialist
SoundersFC,37mll7,twodudesnape,2,Thu May 28 22:21:47 2015 UTC,"We don't play with a CAM and never have. Barring a tactical switch, I wouldn't expect that in the future. We have one of the best defenses in the league. Evans is rapidly adapting and soon this won't be an issue. Yes."
SoundersFC,37mll7,sp_the_ghost,4,Fri May 29 18:11:05 2015 UTC,"Everyone has basically said everything I have to say so far, but I'll just add that I dont think we'll play with a CAM while Sigi is still the coach. He adapts to the players he has and the best lineup we have right now isn't really a diamond that utilizes a CAM."
SoundersFC,37mll7,MowwMoww,1 point,Thu May 28 21:30:40 2015 UTC,I don't think we even played that well in a CAM. Having the SS role is much better than the CAM.
SoundersFC,37mll7,vuduwastaken,2,Thu May 28 22:02:41 2015 UTC,Sigi's systems also usually focus on wing play which doesn't really fit with a CAM.
SoundersFC,37mll7,MowwMoww,3,Thu May 28 22:03:21 2015 UTC,"Pappa, Dempsey, and sometimes Oba seem to take turns popping up in that ""CAM"" space and making things happen. The last year or so, we've liked to go right up the middle. We've been forced to the wings when other teams pack in tight to stop us. That's where Yedlin would punish them."
SoundersFC,37mll7,Chuurp,1 point,Thu May 28 23:50:15 2015 UTC,Agreed.
SoundersFC,37mll7,vuduwastaken,2,Thu May 28 22:05:15 2015 UTC,"The idea is entertaining. Pineda occasionally comes forward, as does Rose when paired with Alonso but I think Seattle plays better with two centermids than with a diamond. They tried a diamond with Dempsey at the tip and the results were...not great. I think Dempsey dropping back to play that CAM/Withdrawn Striker type role works well and shouldn't be messed with."
SoundersFC,37mll7,lightjedi5,1 point,Thu May 28 19:22:05 2015 UTC,Dempsey at the time was feeding two strikers which doesn't work. With him as an SS he's still on the break aways. We need two creative mids instead of a CAM and I think those better fit into a CM role as you've said.
SoundersFC,37mll7,vuduwastaken,2,Thu May 28 22:01:18 2015 UTC,"When you look at the type of players we've had paired with Ozzy, they're balanced defensively and quick and decisive passers comfortable with the ball in tight spaces. As much as I'd love to have a Diego Valeri, I feel the amount of freedom Dempsey plays with would overlap that role too much and leave us weaker in the center of the pitch. I'm a big fan of Rose, but Roldan showed us something special last night paired with Ozzy. He's a ruthless defender that covers a ton of ground and plays incredibly strong with the ball at his feet given his experience."
SoundersFC,37mll7,enigmamr,1 point,Fri May 29 00:24:40 2015 UTC,"What happened to Jaguaribe? Or however you spell the Brazilian guys name, he was a CAM, no? I know he was most likely an S2 project, but still interested."
SoundersFC,37mll7,AtSignAlejandro,1 point,Fri May 29 09:28:04 2015 UTC,Sooo what you're saying is that we should buy Zlatan this summer?
SoundersFC,37mll7,kingofspain131,2,Fri May 29 14:53:56 2015 UTC,Every team in the world should buy Zlatan. Never a bad buy. Never.
SoundersFC,37mll7,ScottishSeahawk,1 point,Fri May 29 15:43:05 2015 UTC,You are a wise man.
SoundersFC,37mll7,kingofspain131,1 point,Fri May 29 22:03:00 2015 UTC,"I'm coming in late I don't think we need a CAM as Dempsey & Martins can and do both drop deep as ""playmaking"" forwards. Instead I think the primary replacement needs to be Pineda. He is a solid player and a good value ,but I don't think he is going to hold up for the rest of the season and will likely be a rotation option at best in another. I would like to see the Sounders grab a solid Box-to-Box type midfielder DP. Essentially someone similar to Sami-Khadeira and his playstyle of covering alot of ground being involved in both defense and offense."
SoundersFC,37mll7,Jack2142,1 point,Sat May 30 01:33:10 2015 UTC,I thought that may be Roldan but they are putting him wide so.. Darwin Jones?
SoundersFC,37mll7,steerbell,4,Thu May 28 19:06:18 2015 UTC,It seems like Roldan is still being groomed and will need some more development before they give him the keys to the castle at CAM. So far he seems to be progressing well.
SoundersFC,37mll7,Wineguy33,2,Thu May 28 19:32:59 2015 UTC,Darwin is a CF through and through. He'll replace Oba.
SoundersFC,37mll7,vuduwastaken,1 point,Thu May 28 22:01:36 2015 UTC,Was he at the UW I seem to remember him coming from mid-field?
SoundersFC,37mll7,steerbell,1 point,Thu May 28 22:23:23 2015 UTC,He played for them for two seasons. He now plays CF for S2 though.
SoundersFC,37mll7,vuduwastaken,1 point,Thu May 28 22:34:10 2015 UTC,"oh sorry I know that, I thought he played mid at the UW. I did not phrase my response well."
SoundersFC,37mll7,steerbell,1 point,Thu May 28 22:36:42 2015 UTC,Yeah I think he might have based on his goal count during that time but I'm not too sure.
SoundersFC,37mll7,vuduwastaken,0,Thu May 28 22:39:32 2015 UTC,"I think we are seeing Rose get more play time for this reason too. On Pappa's goal there was five guys up. Ozzie at times will be the only midfielder in midfield, with the defense coming up to support him while the other mids are up field.   I think its hard for people to see how crazy it is that we have Ozzie Alonso and Clint Dempsey on the same team. Ozzie is one of (if not the) best and most consistent CDMs in MLS and Clint Dempsey is a rare breed of 50% CAM 50% Striker. It's a sure thing that Ozzie will get the ball to Clint and a sure thing that Clint is going to get a key pass, assist, or goal from whatever he does with it.   I'm still on the fence about if Mears was the answer. Crosses into the box from him don't seem to result in much. However, I'm really enjoying his relationship with Roldan when they move up the wing together."
SoundersFC,37mll7,clickmyface,2,Thu May 28 21:01:48 2015 UTC,It's definitely safe to say that Alonso is the best defensive mid in the league
SoundersFC,37jw8u,MowwMoww,25,Thu May 28 04:00:07 2015 UTC,"Are there any Brad Evans doubters left? He was pretty decent all game, and made a crucial step up when Scott fucked up around the 56th minute. Even Stevie Z has been praising Evans playing and improvement.   Also, Neagle, I understand you might have some confidence issues, but sheesh. Mediocre passing/touches and seemed pretty tired even though brought on as a sub."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,Skuby_Duby_Du,8,Thu May 28 04:03:43 2015 UTC,I saw a couple bad decisions/mistakes by Brad that ended up ok.  They could have been shots for Colorado though.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,DronePirate,1 point,Thu May 28 05:14:28 2015 UTC,i was still skeptical until I looked at our goals against. damn. numbers don't lie.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,nemisys1st,1 point,Thu May 28 17:25:00 2015 UTC,"Also, Neagle, I understand you might have some confidence issues, but sheesh. Mediocre passing/touches and seemed pretty tired even though brought on as a sub.   I've been pretty vocal for a bit about how much I don't care for Neagle on our roster. I'm fine with him moving down as a sub role, however last night he couldn't even play that well as a sub. Just watching him play irks me because he's not all that amazing. I think he gets too much credit for being a hometown hero.  But whenever I make a complaint about him he goes and scores a goal from outside the box and I'm left looking like a sour asshole, so maybe he'll score now on Sunday."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,Audicity,1 point,Thu May 28 19:48:33 2015 UTC,"Has he improved? Yes. But he is still the glaring weakness of the defensive back line when Marshall is in. Can it work out? I think it can, but I'm not ready to call him a successful defender yet. I am, however, confident that we can win consistently with him back there, and if we can get through mid season with the defensive record we have right now then I think I'll be ready to claim he is good."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,Skuby_Duby_Du,20,Thu May 28 04:17:00 2015 UTC,"I'll be honest Moww, I don't think he's a ""glaring"" weakness. Marshall has been MLS Defender of the Year three times now and has played CB all his career. The only CBs in this league who can claim to be on Marshall's level are Gonzalez and Biesler (B not at the moment, I guess). Brad Evans has only just started and has improved leaps and bounds; hell, the game against Columbus, he looked better than Chad!   I'm also not really sure if it's whether or not it can work out, rather, it already has. 12 games, and 9 goals given up - a league best. Take out Evans nightmare of a night and you're looking at 11 games, 6 goals.   I can understand where the speculation is coming from, he's untried and inexperienced, but I think he's proving his worth."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,Skuby_Duby_Du,-1,Thu May 28 04:33:38 2015 UTC,"Anybody that is clearly the worst in their role while starting is classified as a glaring weakness. I didn't say he was bad, I just don't think he is so good like so many of you guys do. He still makes half a dozen mistakes a game but people just ignore them."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,vuduwastaken,6,Thu May 28 05:46:01 2015 UTC,"Interesting. I personally (you can check my history) never said Evans was  good, but rather believe he doesn't deserve the knee-jerk reactions and exclamations of ""bad defender"" every-time he has one poor touch.    I enjoy our little discussions Moww; you seem to always have a differing opinion and argue politely. I think I'll do a little research on Evan's past performances and make a post.   (I think our definitions on ""glaring"" differ as well)"

SoundersFC,37jw8u,AtSignAlejandro,1 point,Thu May 28 10:00:21 2015 UTC,yeah he had some ninja stuff goin on XD
SoundersFC,37jw8u,overruns,13,Thu May 28 16:28:52 2015 UTC,"I disagree I don't think he's a 'glaring' defensive weakness, just worse than Chad. But being as good as or better than Chad is not an easy task to do. Of course if that's what you mean by glaring then what I'm saying is pointless. Go Sounders."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,CascadiaKid,0,Thu May 28 04:21:20 2015 UTC,"The only defender that you could consider worse than Evans on the back line is Remick, and he's young and inexperienced so it's to be expected."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,AtSignAlejandro,14,Thu May 28 04:34:10 2015 UTC,"But what does that really say? Our back line is good this year, or at least they have played well so far. So for Evans to be the weak link of that and to be playing well is more a compliment to the fact that the defense has played well for most of the year."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,CascadiaKid,8,Thu May 28 05:23:51 2015 UTC,We have only allowed 9 goals all season. That is tied for the fewest in MLS. If Brad is such a glaring weakness we should keep on the hush hush. Other teams might find out and start scoring some goals.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,joylongdivision,2,Thu May 28 05:15:49 2015 UTC,You can have a weakness without it being exploited.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,CascadiaKid,1 point,Thu May 28 05:44:58 2015 UTC,That's a very good point
SoundersFC,37jw8u,CascadiaKid,1 point,Thu May 28 08:01:03 2015 UTC,It must not be a very big weakness then.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,hhdslater,1 point,Thu May 28 16:02:32 2015 UTC,It should be obvious to people that watch this team that it is very easy to cover up defensive weaknesses when you have the two best players in the league scoring goals left and right.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,PendragonDaGreat,3,Thu May 28 16:06:16 2015 UTC,"We've allowed 9 goals in all season. The second place team in the West (Dallas) has let in 15. The only teams close to our defensive record are Colorado (10), who we've seen are very good defensively, but mediocre everywhere else, and Montreal (9), who've played 5 less games than us. DC is the next closest with 11, and they're rightfully top of the East, just like we're rightfully top of the West.   Yeah, we've had some bad defensive games, Brad was post-injury Ianni-esque against San Jose, and Chad was awful against the Crew, but to say we're a team covering our defensive weaknesses by outscoring our opponents hasn't been true since the New England game. If anything, it's been the opposite in recent weeks with 2-0 wins at Vancouver off two shots on goal, 1-0 vs. Colorado off of 2 or 3, 1-0 against Houston off of 2 shots on goal, etc. etc. etc. We're looking like a team with a solid defense and ruthless efficiency going forward, which we should know by now is what wins in MLS after we've been knocked out by it in the playoffs multiple times now.   We're not as fun to watch as last year (though I'd expect this to change when Clint/Oba are 100% again), and I'm sure the other shoe will drop on the defense eventually, likely via an injury somewhere, but this is the first Sounders team in years that's looking like it has a bit of balance and can do more than simply outscore the other team."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,hhdslater,0,Thu May 28 20:16:46 2015 UTC,Agree to disagree? Evans playing well and its showing in the scoreline.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,stealth_sloth,1 point,Thu May 28 19:12:40 2015 UTC,"I can just as easily say that having the two best defenders in the league in Mears and Marshall is why we aren't conceding, as well as having the most in-form keeper right now. See how these things work?"
SoundersFC,37jw8u,DrunkenRedditMan,2,Thu May 28 20:55:34 2015 UTC,The whole defense is playing really well your totaly right.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,stealth_sloth,14,Thu May 28 21:33:15 2015 UTC,"70% possession and one goal to show for it. What even are this???  EDIT: I'm happy with the win, but not being able to finish all those clear cut chances we were creating isn't gonna fly against teams like LA or Dallas late in the season."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,joylongdivision,9,Thu May 28 04:05:22 2015 UTC,"We play keep away. If they don't have the ball, they can't score."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,hhdslater,8,Thu May 28 04:07:42 2015 UTC,"Well yeah, but there's no reason we shouldn't be scoring more with that much possession and Oba/Clint up top. Don't get me wrong, a win's a win. But one little defensive fuck up could've lost us two points. Gotta score more, no excuse."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,pyky,11,Thu May 28 04:12:31 2015 UTC,"Colorado's got a pretty solid defense this year. They've given up just 6 goals in 10 games against clubs other than Seattle.  And we had a number of chances that, on another night do result in goals; while I'd have liked to see us get goal #2, I'm fine with taking that silver lining and the three points."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,PubLiic,2,Thu May 28 04:37:44 2015 UTC,They still had plenty of chances that a better opponent could have put away. Colorado was especially wasteful on free kicks. NY will prove to be a much tougher challenge this weekend.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,PendragonDaGreat,3,Thu May 28 04:34:19 2015 UTC,"If the other team isn't getting dozens of shots, or at least a few shots from within your box, they aren't really creating good offensive chances.  Run of play shots from 25-30 yards out? 2-3% chance of scoring directly, on average. Free kick from 20-25 yards in the center? 10% chance of directly scoring, roughly (a very, very good free kick taker might be expected to manage 15%).  Colorado had relatively few shots, basically all from long range. Our shutout was well-deserved, and it would be a phenomenally good or a very lucky team that would consistently get a goal off those chances."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,-Zoomacroom-,4,Thu May 28 04:45:14 2015 UTC,What even are this???   The top scoring team in MLS from open play!   Somehow.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,kingofspain131,1 point,Thu May 28 04:14:53 2015 UTC,Which is great. But we were clearly very off and would've made it more like 4-0 if we were on.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,-Zoomacroom-,16,Thu May 28 04:17:54 2015 UTC,"Must say Roldan plays with heart. Doesn't back off, starts big chances unexpectedly. Can't wait to watch him mature as a player."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,AtSignAlejandro,3,Thu May 28 06:06:42 2015 UTC,"If he keeps playing like he played last night, I'd start him over Neagle any day."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,stealth_sloth,13,Thu May 28 18:12:54 2015 UTC,"Woo, top of the league."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,PendragonDaGreat,7,Thu May 28 04:08:08 2015 UTC,"It really could've been a blowout... but in the end, still 3 points whether it ends 1-0 or 10-0."

SoundersFC,37jw8u,philwelch,7,Thu May 28 18:53:02 2015 UTC,Back line played well without Air Marshall. Pappa and Roldan looked really good. Clint and Oba were a tad off and out of sync. Also Ozzie was lucky to stay on but are midfield played well at times even without the usual starting line up. Three points are good to have.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,reeseallen,5,Thu May 28 04:23:47 2015 UTC,WOOO top of the league!  Edit: apparently I am not the first to have this thought. In these exact words no less.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,vuduwastaken,9,Thu May 28 04:16:23 2015 UTC,Looks like you missed  (•_•)   ( •_•)>⌐■-■   (⌐■_■)  Your shot on goal.  YYYYYYYYYYEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!
SoundersFC,37jw8u,lightjedi5,6,Thu May 28 04:35:36 2015 UTC,"A lot of good chances and Roldan looked really good!    I'm not impressed with what looked to be a grumpy Neagle though.   It's getting harder to decided on a Martins Jersey when so many players are stepping up.   All said, exciting game to watch!"
SoundersFC,37jw8u,Ilikeskittlesss,0,Thu May 28 04:04:54 2015 UTC,"Oba looked good, he just needs to stop screwing around in midfield and in our half of the field.  You're a forward, Oba. Midfield passing and possession are not your strong points. Stay forward and stay onside. Your teammates will get you the ball eventually and then you can work your magic."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,elkvision,8,Thu May 28 05:37:40 2015 UTC,"Martins has some of the best control in tight spaces, and can start an attack from midfield as well as Dempsey. For someone of his quality, the more touches on the ball, the better for the team."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,RabbiSchlem,1 point,Thu May 28 06:13:39 2015 UTC,"I disagree. It definitely seems like Oba loses control of the ball at a worryingly high rate when he gets possession near the very middle of the field. When he's within striking distance of the goal, some kind of magic takes hold and his ability to maintain possession and take the ball to the goal is often jaw-dropping. But in the very middle of the field, he makes bad passes and gets double- or triple-teamed and gives up possession."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,clickmyface,2,Fri May 29 01:56:04 2015 UTC,"No, he needs to drop box for hold up play. This is how we score goals"
SoundersFC,37jw8u,RabbiSchlem,2,Thu May 28 10:02:12 2015 UTC,"Disagree. I think it works very well when either he or Dempsey drop back into the middle third to help the play along. Especially against teams playing 3 CMs like Colorado was, it helps spread the play, alleviate some pressure and ultimately opens up space. Both he and Dempsey are good dribbles and good passers, so it works fine."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,clickmyface,5,Thu May 28 19:37:39 2015 UTC,Brad Evans is really starting to convince me he can be a good CB. I was a huge doubter at the start of the season but he is starting to look solid back there. Last game I thought he even looked better than Marshall. I'm just happy that our defense is looking stronger this season.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,cantbeassed,2,Thu May 28 05:43:19 2015 UTC,I think B-Rad has convinced me he already is an upper echelon MLS CB.  Aside from SJ he has been mostly superb and honestly could end up Best XI if he keeps this up and maybe parlay this into a serious look with the Nats as he gains more experience and confidence.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,lightjedi5,3,Fri May 29 08:17:13 2015 UTC,Dempsey was tough to watch. I was also bummed Ozzie was having an off game. Pappa was playing strong though!  Geez that game changed a lot when their #15 (Ramirez?) came in. Was he a 2nd half sub? He was lighting our defense up. Ozzie and him were exchanging blows and words there for a bit :)
SoundersFC,37jw8u,cantbeassed,4,Thu May 28 05:41:53 2015 UTC,"It was a shame Dempsey didn't get to finish one of those but I wouldn't say he was exactly tough to watch. It's not like he got amazing service you could expect a guarantee on. He got bizarre, strange balls in tight quarters.  He also created chances for Oba and others that were frankly a lot more generous that should have been finished. Oba and Clint were heavily marked in the box, which gives people like Pappa a chance to score so it works out."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,lightjedi5,1 point,Thu May 28 15:20:40 2015 UTC,"I don't know... Dempsey couldn't make a pass to save his life. There was one point where he was down on the 12 with a wide open lane to pass back to oba who would have for sure scored. He wasn't moving that fast and it was an easy pass but he totally botched it. From what I saw, it was happening all game."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,elkvision,1 point,Thu May 28 19:54:08 2015 UTC,Your perception is off then. The highlight video alone shows 3 successful key passes (not just regular passes). Wasn't his best game but he would still rate higher statistically than Martins did thanks to those key passes.
SoundersFC,37jw8u,btener412,2,Thu May 28 20:50:53 2015 UTC,"So, as we saw with Kansas City and Houston, this is how we do against a 4/5/1 or 4/2/3/1 setup. We have trouble getting through the midfield and are lucky to get a single goal. Colorado played exactly like Kansas City did, and excusing one bad clearance by Colorado, this also would have been a 0-0 game.   Barring a defensive bed-shitting. You won't see us score more than 1 goal against a 4/5/1 setup, it's just too difficult to get through the middle like Dempsey/Martins want to do.   Unless Sigi figures out how to get through a 5 man midfield, or we get a third heavy offensive option, I see this trend continuing."
SoundersFC,37jw8u,Jack2142,1 point,Thu May 28 19:04:54 2015 UTC,It's too bad the 3-5-2 Sigi tried in preseason looked like garbage because I think that type of setup is pretty good against a 4-2-3-1 that likes to sit back the way Colorado and Kansas both did. Hopefully he fan figure something out.
SoundersFC,37jeeg,SgtSnuggle,5,Thu May 28 01:37:18 2015 UTC,"""No word from the Sounders on the reason for Chad Marshall's absence. Will update with Sigi Schmid after the game""  https://twitter.com/mattpentz/status/603736047479091200  Most signs point to rest for the upcoming stretch of matches."
SoundersFC,37jeeg,-Zoomacroom-,3,Thu May 28 01:39:14 2015 UTC,That makes sense. I would rather have him out on rest than out on injury.
SoundersFC,37jeeg,cantbeassed,2,Thu May 28 01:46:03 2015 UTC,"It's also why you saw Gonzales as LB, Colorado isn't known for having amazing offense, where NYRB are much more threatening. Better to rest the people we need against a lower tier opponent."
SoundersFC,37jeeg,DrunkenRedditMan,6,Thu May 28 16:40:42 2015 UTC,"Pappa MOTM for me. Not just because of the goal but because of the amount of confidence he showed all game, taking on defenders and making incisive passes. Best game he's had since the first leg of last season's playoff vs LA.  Edit: meant to post this in the post game thread"

SoundersFC,37hn62,BanksKnowsBest,11,Wed May 27 18:28:09 2015 UTC,"I fully support the ECS.  The owners of the Sounders are financially benefiting from the atmosphere they work hard at creating.  Let's not forget the Sounders are a business, a long term investment by a few wealthy owners.  I hope they can negotiate some points that benefit them and ultimately the rest of the fanbase indirectly in the future."
SoundersFC,37hn62,hey_kool_aid,10,Wed May 27 21:55:01 2015 UTC,A great piece from Oshan with a little more info than what has been passed around Twitter.
SoundersFC,37hn62,fuz2o,3,Wed May 27 18:28:41 2015 UTC,Is oshan part of the ecs?
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,2,Thu May 28 02:32:16 2015 UTC,I believe so.
SoundersFC,37hn62,vuduwastaken,24,Thu May 28 04:58:00 2015 UTC,"While I sympathize with their complaints (especially regarding camera crews in their section) to be honest a lot of this ECS stuff comes across as extremely entitled.  If you want FO support (and stadium support) for raising TIFOs, leaving gaps in the usual stadium ""stuff"" for your songs and a lot of leeway regarding obscene gestures and coordinated songs... turning around and getting all pissy about getting shown on TV/marketing stuff is a bit silly.  I mean, yeah you can block out seats and have a section but when it comes to the game experience you have no more rights than any other fan... which includes cameras and having to play by the same rules as everyone else."
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,9,Wed May 27 20:00:31 2015 UTC,"The problem is this. ECS gets fined/banned/yelled at for things then the FO uses those same exact things for marketing. For instance smokes/flares. (Yes I know this has to so with the fire code) so its a bit hypocritical for them to promote ""banned activities"" with their marketing material."
SoundersFC,37hn62,my_lucid_nightmare,4,Wed May 27 20:33:19 2015 UTC,"Hm. I haven't seen smoke in the marketing material beyond the march to the match stuff (where I assume smoke and flares are fine since it's outside the stadium).  Not saying it isn't there, and yeah they should definitely knock off that bit of hypocrisy. Heh... that's a bit like when the NFL.com site sold a print of Lynch's ""hold mah dick"" picture the same week they fined him for the same incident."
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,11,Wed May 27 21:02:21 2015 UTC,"Without ECS, stadium atmosphere would be pretty mediocre.  They do a ton of work to make things happen.  It's a big deal to have decent supporters.  Clubs that fight their supporters wind up being clubs with 15,000 non committed fans attending.  That being said, ECS and Sounders FO have a long history of working together, so this is mainly going to work itself out, I would think/hope."
SoundersFC,37hn62,PeteyNice,8,Wed May 27 20:10:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure I follow how that addresses my point. I'm not denying that the ECS is important to the stadium atmosphere (along with the other supporters groups which frequently get forgotten). What I'm saying is the relationship goes both ways... the supporters section gets special treatment and to expect that should come ""for free"" or without strings seems a bit entitled to me.  Make no mistake, the FO's tolerance for the supporters groups' shenanigans only goes as far as their actions help the stadium atmosphere. When they start doing stuff that endangers that in their minds (which especially includes doing anything to harm the TV deals) they are going to try and step in and try to fix it.  The ECS members might think it's funny or a good ""screw you"" to flip off cameras, but the FCC doesn't fuck around with its fines. ""Well don't film the supporters groups"" I hear you say? That's what I mean when I say they act as though they have their own rules. Read the back of your ticket some time (or the online agreement). It's basically a contract and part of that says they have the right to film you and use it for basically whatever they want.   That being said, ECS and Sounders FO have a long history of working together, so this is mainly going to work itself out, I would think/hope.   Agreed. This will likely all blow over but to be perfectly honest I doubt anything is going to change from the FO's standpoint."
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,7,Wed May 27 20:55:42 2015 UTC,"What happened in Vancouver is not about being filmed as a general thing. It is about having a camera person in your personal space and having them try to stage manage the operation by telling you where/how to stand and threatening to call security if you refuse their instructions. Flipping off the camera in that instance was simply as a means to get them to stop.  Also, live sports are shown on a seven second delay so if anyone gets a fine for something like that it is on the network."
SoundersFC,37hn62,langstoned,4,Wed May 27 23:39:46 2015 UTC,"Ah. That's pretty fucked up. I didn't know they were trying to orchestrate the fan experience. They have the right to film, but fans aren't legally bound to participate in some fashion. But as I said at the root of this little comment thread I feel the complaint about cameras literally in your faces for 90 mins is a legit beef. You've got just as much of a right to enjoy the game as anyone else and having some dipshit stick a lens in your face and ask you to scooch over is above and beyond.   Also, live sports are shown on a seven second delay so if anyone gets a fine for something like that it is on the network.   Yes... but shit rolls down hill. Do you think Fox Sports (or whoever) is going to just idly take a fine, even if they do fuck up and not dump the feed? I don't think so. They'll see a team affiliated group that just caused them a financial burden and demand action be taken.  You know... like tracking that member down, suspending his season tickets and demanding he take some sort of goofy online fan appreciation seminar."
SoundersFC,37hn62,Tasslehoff,3,Wed May 27 23:47:49 2015 UTC,"Read the back of your ticket some time (or the online agreement). It's basically a contract and part of that says they have the right to film you and use it for basically whatever they want.   So much of their complaints fall under this, IMO."
SoundersFC,37hn62,francostine,5,Wed May 27 22:59:40 2015 UTC,That does not include the March to the Match though.
SoundersFC,37hn62,langstoned,9,Wed May 27 23:32:04 2015 UTC,Or a privately hired bus ride to Vancouver.
SoundersFC,37hn62,m101,3,Thu May 28 00:26:55 2015 UTC,"Which takes place in public, on a parade permit paid for by the team iirc.  If ssfc is paying for the permit,  it is their march. If anything changes, I'd like to see the band get more involved again with the match, it was more fun for more fans. I have a GA season ticket  and pay dues to ECS, but other than the bus complaint they don't have much room to complain."
SoundersFC,37hn62,Warvanov,0,Thu May 28 15:01:57 2015 UTC,"No,  that falls under being in a public place."
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,6,Thu May 28 02:06:33 2015 UTC,"Your average fan expects to have camera's on them and to occasionally show up on the broadcast or the jumbotron. In Vancouver the camera's were right there in our section for the entire match, several feet from our faces. Have you tried supporting with a camera in your face off and on for 90 minutes? It's obnoxious and distracting. That's more than your typical fan has to deal with."
SoundersFC,37hn62,vuduwastaken,3,Wed May 27 21:11:14 2015 UTC,I kinda feel like I called that out as a legit complaint in the very first sentence.  I'm more referring to the ecs's stance that they shouldn't be used for marketing.
SoundersFC,37hn62,vuduwastaken,3,Wed May 27 21:18:31 2015 UTC,It's not that they shouldn't be used for marketing. It's if you are using ECS for marketing then you better stop fining/banning us for the same damn behavior.
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,2,Wed May 27 22:27:58 2015 UTC,"They were complaining about being used period and seem to take umbrage with being used for marketing period.   It's more like ""stop getting in the way"". There continues to be negative action from the FO because they want to market ECS.   Anyways, if you are an ECS member I'd suggest you read the forums for some clarifying info.  EDIT: Looks like the parent comment was deleted. For posterity here is quoted:   You mentioned that in the other comment thread and I agreed with you that they shouldn't have a double standard when it comes to the content. And as I also I said, I hadn't seen in-stadium flare pictures used for presser stuff. And they sure as hell haven't (intentionally) used ECS members flipping the bird for a presser either. The only time I've seen smoke in an MLS montage thing was for Portland... and that's because they're controlled by the team (kinda like our goal-mounted flame throwers) Oh, and FWIW I didn't see any mention of that particular issue in the ECS complaint. They were complaining about being used period and seem to take umbrage with being used for marketing period."
SoundersFC,37hn62,vuduwastaken,1 point,Wed May 27 23:23:41 2015 UTC,Yeah sorry. I deleted it because we're basically having the same discussion in two comment threads and I thought that was silly.
SoundersFC,37hn62,never-enough-hops,1 point,Wed May 27 23:33:35 2015 UTC,No worries! I didn't realize I was replying back to you actually. All good :)
SoundersFC,37hn62,francostine,1 point,Wed May 27 23:43:05 2015 UTC,Yeah this has been a fun one. I usually avoid being critical of the ECS in here because I worry about getting sucked into a massive multi-threaded discussion.  Enjoy the game!
SoundersFC,37hn62,nikdahl,6,Wed May 27 23:58:56 2015 UTC,"Without ecs, sounders stadium atmosphere is nothing, and without the sounders, the ecs is nothing. Where I don't agree with the sounders forcing things on the ecs, I can kind of see where the FO expects some type of leniency from the ecs."
SoundersFC,37hn62,BugSTi,5,Thu May 28 00:10:44 2015 UTC,Here is a link to the message that was sent by ECS leadership today
SoundersFC,37hn62,vuduwastaken,-1,Thu May 28 00:25:22 2015 UTC,http://imgur.com/AwGbyO4
SoundersFC,37hn62,BugSTi,3,Wed May 27 19:05:45 2015 UTC,It works now
SoundersFC,37hn62,vuduwastaken,3,Wed May 27 19:31:38 2015 UTC,Still getting the same thing on 3 different browsers... Anyone care to screenshot or copypasta?
SoundersFC,37hn62,BugSTi,8,Wed May 27 20:34:06 2015 UTC,"For those ECS members that were unable to make the meeting at Fuel and/or that missed what was said on the capo stand at last Saturday's match, we wanted to clear the air a bit so all ECS members are properly informed.  We've had frustrations building and a few situations arise that we deemed necessary to address in a serious fashion. We asked all our members, through multiple channels, as well as through the sub group leads, to join us at Fuel in advance of our standard march time on Saturday afternoon. We did this because it is the original home of the ECS, and where our pre-funk rituals and our march to the match originally started.  Before getting into some additional detail, we would like to first wholeheartedly thank everyone that came and joined us. We would also like to thank Fuel for letting us use their porch as a soap box. We would especially like to thank our other partners Temple Billiards, and Merchants Caf? who undoubtedly saw a down turn in business due to our activities last weekend. We encourage you to go buy an extra pint from them as well for their sacrifice on our behalf.  Although many members aren't aware, the march to the match has been a contentious issue for years with ECS. Additionally, there have recently been advertising issues, stadium bans, band issues, photography issues, and marketing and rights issues all surrounding the ECS. We feel the march to the match represents us as a group and that was why we chose it as the platform in which we wanted to stage our ""airing of grievances.""   We kept the details for our gathering vague, because we wanted to show that our members care enough about this group to come out in mass, listen to what ECS leadership had to say, and respond as a cohesive group. We are pleased to say that happened. A portion of the following points were the highlight of a passionate speech delivered to the ECS members about why we decided to do this. The FO claims that they invented and own the march to the match. They claim on their website that people should culminate and march ""while singing and chanting Sounders FC fight songs."" These are OUR songs orchestrated by US and it's frustrating that they publicly claim otherwise. Imagery of ECS members outside of CenturyLink Field is being used by the MLS as an advertisement for LAFC expansion team without our consent despite the fact it's our march and we were not in the stadium. We were asked by the MLS (via our FO) if we would allow MLS commercial camera crews on our Vancouver away travel buses so they could document us and use us for advertising the Cascadia rivalry (and who knows what else). We refused to be used as a profit building machine for the MLS. Still, three camera crews infiltrated our section to gain footage. These cameras were way too close to us and became a hindrance and a nuisance to our traveling support affecting our ability and right to support our boys on the pitch properly.  When many ECS members flipped off these cameras one of them ended up on live TV. This member was not disciplined within the stadium. Our FO later sent pictures of our member to ECS leadership and asked us to identify him for disciplinary purposes. We refused. They found him through other methods and handed him a ban from CenturyLink Field until he paid for and went through the 'fan code of conduct' online class.  Many of these things have been distracting us from our ultimate goals/mission of supporting our boys on the pitch and more importantly many of these things have eroded the passion and level of dedication that we have come to know from a large number of new and old school ECS members.  We as ECS are not of the mentality that we are above laws or stadium policies but we do insist on being treated fairly, consistently, and without bias.   During the speech at Fuel, our capo mentioned they would be putting a middle finger in every camera lens they saw. This was symbolic insofar that if you ban one of us without speaking to us, you better plan to ban all of us. We then began to march down the route of our choosing. As usual, our march was bombarded by multiple photographers. Most all got at least 1 finger.  With all of this rolling passion we are aware of a few issues of people getting too aggressive with photographers and onlookers. The ECS does not nor have we ever condoned violence or physical confrontations in any way, shape, or form. The culmination of the above stated issues in no way justifies physically abusing any innocent bystanders. ECS security has been alerted to a couple of instances and we are diligently looking into them. Let us be clear, we are NOT hooligans. Read that again. WE ARE NOT HOOLIGANS. We would like to personally apologize to anyone that felt that was representative of ECS. We're with you. Such actions are completely unacceptable and will not be tolerated within this group.  We stepped into our normal march route and picked up those regular dedicated marchers at Occidental Park and what followed was one of the most passionate marches we've experienced in years.   Inside the stadium, the message was a bit more upbeat. We did not want to affect the players but we did want to make our points abundantly clear about how we felt about issues addressed at the very beginning of the march. During pre-match a speech was given talking about unity within our group. About supporting each other. We asked everyone to raise their hands if they were ECS. (Paid or not.) A significant amount of the ECS section raised their hands. They were then asked to look around and be proud of the organization they were a part of. They were asked to introduce themselves to the people next to them, in front of them, and behind them. This message may have been lost in the powerful march to the match but this was the second part of what we want to address.  Along with showing solidarity with a member, we also emphasized solidarity with each other. Fighting amongst ourselves publicly can create feelings of distrust, disconnection, and disloyalty that effect all members and our support on match day. A house divided cannot stand.   So, let's hash out any and all issues but let's do it on the forums that our memberships pay for. We all have our favorite social mediums, but your leadership team has made the commitment to check these forums at least once a day. So, this is the best place to reach out, to connect, and to be heard.  The last action the ECS made on Saturday was during the first 2 minutes of ""Bluest Skies"" (otherwise known as ""Seattle""). Normally, we do scarves up and the boom camera that is always located in front of us pans across our colors. Instead, we led with middle fingers raised high. The final statement in which we spelled out: BAN ONE OF US, BAN ALL OF US.  So what does this mean? Are we at War with our FO? No. Does the ECS hate the Sounders? No. Do the Sounders hate the ECS? No. This was just a reminder that we are not employees of the front office. We are not their puppets, nor their marketing tool. We are the Emerald City Supporters, the independent supporters group of the Seattle Sounders Football Club and our culture is not for sale.  Wednesday we will return to our old school spot. We will march from Fuel, through Occidental Park, to the stadium. We will march together, business as usual, in a passionate and peaceful manner, continuing to condemn anyone that thinks physicality towards others is ok. We will return to our section in the Brougham End. And we will continue to support our boys on the pitch as passionately as ever.  Please keep your eyes peeled for the location of our upcoming town hall discussion starting at 11 AM this Sunday. All members are encouraged to come and talk to leadership, to express ideas, concerns and questions of any nature related to ECS business. If you can't make this one, this won't be the only one. We have every reason to be roud of first decade supporting the Sounders. We'll share more on our social media channels, so watch the forums,  Facebook and Twitter for more.  Let's work together to make this next decade even better.   Up the Sounders  Up the ECS"

They were ugly to watch and bad sports to boot, numerous jersey and neck grabs as well as blatant kicks to the calves every time we recieved the ball back to goal...and their two handed shoves in the box were pretty classless too...so proud of the boys for fighting so strong, very deserved win and we did it with class! :)))"

He got a lot of flak for it; several of his red cards got overturned on review and PRO pulled him from the center circle for a while to do more 4th-official work.  And to his credit: he learned. His decision making in those ""big-call"" situations over the past year has been better than it used to be. He still makes mistakes, but every ref does and I don't think he's been any worse than the average MLS ref."

The issue I have with him is he just doesn't want to referee, he wants to be the story himself.  I don't think the PRO discipline will change him long term.  I think he'll just forget and revert to his true calling, as he sees himself, as needing to call red cards and change games.  It's like asking if a bad cop can reform.  Some would say sure, but I would say probably not, once a bad cop always a bad cop.  He was the one that called Gspurning off his line in the USOC final, helping to give KC the match.  Replay showed Gspurning was no more off his line than Nielsen had been, but that Salazar decided it was time to make a game-changing call, and saw something nobody else did.  Just one that comes to mind, there's been others."

SoundersFC,37ddz7,seariously,1 point,Tue May 26 20:29:20 2015 UTC,I am fine with self linking to decent content to a site with no ads or posting the content on Reddit and linking to a site regardless of ads.  I think posts linking to a spammy ad filled blog with low quality content or linked content should be deleted.  The grey area is self posting to a site with ads and/or mediocre content. If a site or user gets enough complaints then I would say that you should tell them to copy/paste their content into a post but they can keep a link to their site.
SoundersFC,37ddz7,LaResistance117,2,Tue May 26 22:46:20 2015 UTC,I think the self promo tag will help with this.  If someone repeatedly posts self promo links to a crappy site they will be downvoted more vigorously than a normal post to a mediocre site.  At least I would down vote it more vigorously.

Some of this is already Reddiquette but doesn't hurt to spell it out.

It may not happen enough to warrant a rule, however. What happens is a user might post something after we beat the Timbers saying ""Hey look, the Timbers are really salty, check out this post!"" followed by Sounders fans infiltrating that sub via that linked post and downvoting Timbers fans in their own sub. It happens sometimes, but like I said, perhaps not enough to really be concerned about it."

SoundersFC,373ve9,longlive289s,7,Sun May 24 18:21:15 2015 UTC,"I loved Brad coming up from the back to take a crack. I could just feel him thinking ""THIS IS HOW YOU MIDFIELD, BOYS"""
SoundersFC,373ve9,EbonPinion,2,Sun May 24 22:49:55 2015 UTC,With you on Evans. He looked excellent.
SoundersFC,373ve9,thatevildude,10,Mon May 25 02:49:40 2015 UTC,Frei has some crucial saves that kept the clean sheet. Evans a close second. Your link is pointing me to the main page of this subreddit.
SoundersFC,373ve9,thegraduate,1 point,Sun May 24 17:15:42 2015 UTC,I thought Remick had a good game. Worked hard.
SoundersFC,373ve9,steerbell,1 point,Sun May 24 17:17:36 2015 UTC,"Remick got schooled on a few plays and gave the ball away a few times.  I think many of the attacks came down his side of the field, and they seemed to figure out that they could run at him and cause him to cough up the ball too quickly.  But he got forward well in the second half and looked a bit better..."
SoundersFC,373ve9,mcmSEA,2,Sun May 24 19:38:17 2015 UTC,They attacked him all night. He ran all night. I thought he did well.  He worked harder then anyone else.
SoundersFC,3725p5,MowwMoww,27,Sun May 24 04:01:31 2015 UTC,"That was the single most boring, excruciatingly infuriating thing ever. Every. Single. Time we got anything good going, somebody would fuck it up because of laziness or absent mindedness. And everyone was equally guilty for fucking up a play or two at some point. We repeatedly shot ourselves in the foot, over and over and fucking over again. Absolutely should have won, but we didn't because we were just playing at 75% of our usual effort. If we had gotten a late winner, I honestly wouldn't have been celebrating or happy about it. I would've had more of a ""fucking FINALLY"" kind of reaction. I know it's just a draw, and we're almost at the top of the table, but playing a team missing 7 of their starters and only coming away with a draw because we were just kind of not really feeling it tonight is absolutely unacceptable. Ugh. What an aggravating and simultaneously unentertaining waist of time. I could've been doing laundry or something. FUCK that was boring.  Okay, rant over.  EDIT: Is it just me, or was Brad Evans the best player on the field tonight?"
SoundersFC,3725p5,hhdslater,16,Sun May 24 04:16:51 2015 UTC,Evans has come a long long long way from that terrible game he had. He is turning into a damn good CB.
SoundersFC,3725p5,steveotheguide,7,Sun May 24 04:38:44 2015 UTC,"Brad Evans did well, aside from his David Luiz moment, which was infuriating because he had five other supporting players to play it off to but apparently decided that trying to blast it from outside the box was a better idea."

SoundersFC,3725p5,AtSignAlejandro,13,Sun May 24 04:38:29 2015 UTC,"Being the optimist here: Vancouver, FCD, and Portscum all lost today. It would've been nice to jump to the top of the west, but now we have 2nd (due to GD), and that was the second clean sheet in a row.   Also we have a game in hand against FCD and two against Vancouver.  All in all though I hope this isn't a game we look back on wishing we had picked up all 3 points."

SoundersFC,3725p5,PendragonDaGreat,5,Sun May 24 05:14:34 2015 UTC,They definitely were.
SoundersFC,3725p5,Ilikeskittlesss,2,Sun May 24 04:07:44 2015 UTC,"I thought we looked good in the first half. We controlled the game, made good passes and kept possession. Second half we looked like they were told to have a different game plan because we kept giving the ball away from all those pointless long balls."
SoundersFC,3725p5,Chuurp,1 point,Sun May 24 04:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, something didn't seem to be clicking. It was nice to see Ozzie shut down Benny ""currently playing some of the best soccer of any American"" Feilhaber, and Marshall manhandling Nemeth all game though."
SoundersFC,3725p5,fnmonk,10,Tue May 26 21:51:20 2015 UTC,"Pineda was clearly hurting out there - why didn't Roldan come in for him as opposed to Pappa? Ugh, I feel like I just wasted the last hour and a half of my night watching that match."
SoundersFC,3725p5,thegraduate,5,Sun May 24 04:05:18 2015 UTC,"Pappa always seems to come out, but he was a turnover machine tonight so it was a good move."
SoundersFC,3725p5,clickmyface,5,Sun May 24 05:19:43 2015 UTC,"Could have benefited quite a bit from widening the field in the second half but it just didn't happen. SKC played so defensively which is what you expect when they are missing 7 starters.   First shot on target came at the 87th minute, that's hard to swallow."
SoundersFC,3725p5,CascadiaKid,7,Sun May 24 04:06:02 2015 UTC,"I think KC played really well tonight. There were really organized and didn't allow much for opportunities. Without Oba its clear we lack the creativity needed to break down a defense this disciplined. As boring as it was there is no need to freak out. We played alright, just not good enough for 3 points tonight."
SoundersFC,3725p5,maurosmane,6,Sun May 24 04:37:16 2015 UTC,Also good job on the /r/MLS thread today /u/MowwMoww
SoundersFC,3725p5,bjdm151,4,Sun May 24 04:35:14 2015 UTC,So on a positive note - the Sailor who sang the National Anthem tonight absolutely killed it.
SoundersFC,3725p5,CosmoThor,8,Sun May 24 15:37:23 2015 UTC,"Not happy with the subs, not happy with the player attitudes, and not happy with the fitness. They just gave up after 65 minutes because they couldn't score. I think we should be really scared about having to rely on Barrett while Oba is out.  Okay, I'll step back off the ledge now."
SoundersFC,3725p5,tdubthatsme,8,Sun May 24 04:02:43 2015 UTC,"Gotta be honest, Barrett was on point. He had one real opportunity, but every pass coming his way was fucking awful. Frustrating that this year we really seem to be a team of ""almost"" goals."
SoundersFC,3725p5,tdubthatsme,9,Sun May 24 05:50:53 2015 UTC,"really scared about the guy that scored just 2 last week? Who would you have subbed on/off instead? Pineda would have been the only other consideration I would have made. I did not see them give up. I am disappointed in the result, and I think we could do much better in the final third, but we controlled pretty much the entire game. We were one solid give and go on their 18th with everyone being very satisfied with the result. Offense wasn't clicking well, but the possession and defense were, for the most part."
SoundersFC,3725p5,tdubthatsme,8,Sun May 24 04:17:11 2015 UTC,"You can't rely on a person that can score 2 goals one week and then go 5 weeks without a goal or an assist. He is a role player, but when he doesn't finish his chances then he isn't playing that role.   I totally saw them give up. The last 10 minutes the entire midfield except for Roldan were walking around behind the half way line. Whether or not those were instructions from Sigi I don't know, but its not acceptable regardless.    but we controlled pretty much the entire game.    Which is completely irrelevant when the scoreline is 0-0 and you come away with 1 point at home against a weak side with 70% possession.    We were one solid give and go on their 18th with everyone being very satisfied with the result.   Again, the game isn't played and based off of ""what if"". It didn't happen. If you don't win a game with 70% possession then there is a serious issue and the fans deserve to be upset.    Who would you have subbed on/off instead?    Subbing players off is more than just who gets subbed off. Barrett should have been on 20 minutes earlier as he was completely gassed and useless. Jones was the only fast player in the attacking half, he should have come on for Barrett much sooner. Neagle should have been taken off for Roldan much sooner and Pineda for Rose in the 75th-80th minute. Pappa shouldn't have come off."
SoundersFC,3725p5,tdubthatsme,3,Sun May 24 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"He now has 2 goals in his two games starting. You haven't given him a chance to go 5 weeks. You want to replace him after one. You know who hasn't scored in two games? Dempsey. Maybe we should replace him (/s). Pappa wasn't fast either. The strategy wasn't about speed. It was about controlling the pace of the game. Yes, we didn't win and we should have. Yes, that's disappointing. But it was one game, and the people you are blaming were successful just last week. Soccer is not a game were the better team wins every game. We showed we were the better team. Once again, it is disappointing, and there is reason to be upset. But you simply can't go calling out players and the coach for a tie where we controlled the game. Hell, we got mutilated last year against the Revolution, and still won the Supporters Shield. A tie isn't the end of the world. I saw Barrett still  making runs in the 70th minute. Rose looked like he was working hard. Ozzie was dropping back to help distribute. Pineda was injured. You said yourself Roldan was working. It's possession based soccer. You pass around, you try to find a hole. if you don't, you pass it back and try again. It's the best strategy in soccer, and Sigi has been trying to implement the last few games. It didn't work entirely yesterday, but you can clearly see the potential. If possession focused soccer disappoints you, then too bad; it looks like the Sounders are going in that direction. After all, the best possession based teams won each of the top 4 leagues in the world."
SoundersFC,3725p5,tdubthatsme,-1,Sun May 24 22:05:45 2015 UTC,"You realize you're talking about Barrett, right? Just want to make sure you're aware of who we are talking about."
SoundersFC,3725p5,Ilikeskittlesss,2,Sun May 24 22:41:02 2015 UTC,"Yes. Who had one of the highest goals per 90 last season for a player with more than a couple games, and has two goals in two starts this season. I do think he should have been subbed off sooner than he was, but it wasn't like he wasn't working up until he got subbed off. I looked at the game just now quickly skipping through. 65:15 he checks to and then makes a huge run. 71 he stays behind the ball and forces it back. He worked hard until he was subbed off. He's no Oba, but he is not worthless either. He was higher on the depth chart than Cooper, who is now getting time on another MLS team."
SoundersFC,3725p5,philwelch,-1,Sun May 24 23:17:14 2015 UTC,"No, it's exactly like he wasn't working on top. He wasn't. No shots on goal until the 83rd minute or thereabouts? That's not doing your job, that's being bad at it. He had a career season last year while playing alongside the two best players in MLS. Congrats. He still isn't a starter.   I've said this dozens of times when people bring it up to defend Neagle. Hard work doesn't win games. Scoring goals does."
SoundersFC,3725p5,jaschac,1 point,Sun May 24 23:39:26 2015 UTC,"Did you watch the game? 65:15, checks to ball then huge run trying to get it over the top. It took me a total of 30 seconds to find a play past the 60th minute (where he was apparently too tired, according to you), where he is clearly working hard. On defense, he constantly forces the play to the direction the Sounders want.  What team has a better replacement striker for when someone is injured for a couple weeks? Barrett isn't a long term solution. He is not expected to be THE starter. He is expected to fill in where/when he needs to. Yes. Scoring goals wins game. We didn't do that yesterday. It's disappointing. But the player you are talking about not scoring goals scored two LAST GAME. Barrett isn't any more to blame than anyone else. Dempsey didn't score either, and if not scoring in one game is your condition for failure, he fails too. Barrett is in the top 10 in goals per 90 (as is Dempsey and Martins) so far this season. He was last season as well. EDIT: missed an o"
SoundersFC,3725p5,CosmoThor,-1,Mon May 25 01:01:36 2015 UTC,"You've got some seriously flawed logic going on, equating Barrett and Dempsey, talking about random points in the match where he was running down the field, determining that Barrett is great based off last week. I'd work on that."
SoundersFC,3725p5,cantbeassed,2,Mon May 25 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"No, your argument is that one that defies logic, and that is what I am proving by bringing up Barrett and Dempsey. The conditions that make you say that Barrett is useless would also apply to Dempsey, as neither scored. You were also saying that he was just walking around. Him running around proves you wrong. I didn't determine that Barrett was great due to last week, I determined it by looking at data through last season, and showed that he has proved himself as an effective goalscorer. Meanwhile, you have given up on logic completely and attempted to attack my argument instead of backing yours, which reflects the weakness in what your statements. EDIT: typo"

SoundersFC,3725p5,steveotheguide,2,Sun May 24 08:36:33 2015 UTC,"Negatives: - That much possession-dominance throughout the game and we could only put one freakin' shot on target? Nuh-uh. No way. Not. Acceptable. - Actually, I guess that's that only thing that really bothered me.   Positives: - Clean sheet. That's never bad. - Frei with a possible SotW at the end there to keep us in it. - Another game of ""our ball, you don't get to play"". I could get used to this. (though it was not nearly as smooth and connected as last week) - Decent, though not great play from almost everyone involved.    This was a home game that we should have won. At the end of the year when, inevitably, we are once again in a dead-heat with LAG for points we will regret how many we gave up at the beginning of the year  (slightly-off-topic/wishful-thinking: anyone else feel like they would have preferred to see Craven in there, instead of Barrett? Not that Barrett is a scrub or anything, but Craven has just been a beast down in S2.)"
SoundersFC,3725p5,AtSignAlejandro,2,Sun May 24 04:56:54 2015 UTC,"I mentioned in a previous comment, I think Barrett only had one real opportunity that he honestly should've made. But besides that every pass that came his way was pretty poor."
SoundersFC,3725p5,CosmoThor,2,Sun May 24 05:54:39 2015 UTC,"This is how you beat the 4-4-2 Seattle has been throwing out. You clog up the central mid with a 4-5-1 or 3-5-2 and watch as Seattle eventually gives up trying to go through the middle. It leads to these long balls over the top that KC won 70% of the time, and a 2v4 of the forwards trying to take on 4 defenders and the keeper, it just isn't going to happen.   When you play for a draw, which KC was obviously doing, it's ridiculously easy. This is a loss, as KC had by all rights, no real chance to win it. They came playing for a road point, against a better team, in a difficult field, and got it.   The problem, again, is that the sounders rely very heavily in verticle movement up the field, Neagle and Pappa have struggled to get that third wide-field threat that the team needs to prevent this style of stalemate win.   You saw this, in how we lost so much possession in the midfield. We tried our hold the ball and move trick that we did with Vancouver, but turned it over after at most 6 passes.   Houston tried this as well, but were broken down by Oba's speed and creativity. Without him, we lack the creativity/speed to get past a 5 man midfield.   And if you needed another reason to hate KC, they ended Dempsey's run at a record for longest streak with a goal/assist per game @ 10. Seems anytime we're up for record breaking KC is there to fuck us."

I hope we get Oba back soon. Dempsey just doesn't have people up there with him on quite the same page.   As a positive I'm very encouraged about what I saw from Roldan and Darwin Jones tonight. The future is bright with them and Jordan Moris coming up through the ranks.

SoundersFC,36rk9f,BanksKnowsBest,5,Thu May 21 15:43:05 2015 UTC,"These write-ups really don't do the matches justice. They didn't even talk about the fact we used all of our subs by minute 65, then had an injury (something around the 75th?) and finished out the match in extra time a man down. The Puma's red came pretty late. I don't recall when and again the article didn't even mention when or why. There was even a near brawl towards the end of regulation. The ref really appeared to struggle keeping control of the match prompting loud jeers from the ECS.   The last two S2 games have been madness. This is certainly the best early round USOC match I've seen. The last match against OKC was similar. Not much to write home about in the first half but and then the game gets cracked open.   If you haven't gone to an S2 match, GO. These guys fight all game long and makes for some damned entertaining soccer."

SoundersFC,36qba5,seariously,2,Thu May 21 14:42:32 2015 UTC,"In the nfl's case it's not quite that simple. For one, when the blackout rules were created ticket sales were a much bigger part of their revenue... Now it's completely blown out of the water by the tv deals.  And two, the nfl was getting congressional pressure to end the practice. Since the nfl already benefits from a lot public funding (stadiums) and tax breaks (the nfl is a registered non profit some how) they decided to bow to that request.  ...At least temporarily.

SoundersFC,36i5pt,Farax,8,Tue May 19 15:50:08 2015 UTC,TL;DR   The Sounders are a true top-level MLS club. The Whitecaps aren't there just yet. While Vancouver has led or been tied at the top of the MLS standing for much of the 2015 season. Seattle have shown that they are true top contenders each and every season. The visitors came into BC Place and put on a defensive clinic in front of Stefan Frei. The recipe for defeating Carl Robinson and the Vancouver Whitecaps was on full display and it was shown that it can be done by the Seattle Sounders Football Club.

SoundersFC,36iu2o,KDFilm,2,Tue May 19 19:21:17 2015 UTC,"Great, thanks! Do you suggest ticketmaster? Stubhub? Others?"
SoundersFC,36iu2o,KDFilm,5,Tue May 19 19:26:08 2015 UTC,"Depends on the pricing at the time you want to purchase. Most of the time you can just grab some from scalpers by the stadium about an hour prior to kick for 30$ a piece. Since you're not down by the stadiums you probably don't know who to trust so I would try epic seats. In fact here's 2 awesome tickets for a good price   https://epicseats.com/tickets/centurylink-field/t759788/sporting-kansas-city-at-seattle-sounders-fc-tickets.aspx   124 L 37$ a piece would be awesome, you guys will have a ton of fun. Be aware that the sections 121-123 have flags that get waved sometimes during the match, do not complain about them, it's part of the experience."
SoundersFC,36iu2o,BugSTi,3,Tue May 19 19:43:46 2015 UTC,"I'm partial to the SW corner. I like the 200 level vs the 100 or 300 levels. 200 level is at a good height to see the whole field, but not so far away that the players look like ants.   I like the SW corner because it is close to ECS, and I at least like to hear them, and not with the 3 second delay you get in the north end of the stadium.   Look for tickets on the sounders website. Be sure to click the option for ""resale"" tickets. Those are season ticket members that are selling their seats fot that game.  Google ""century link field section XXX"" and look at the vantage points from each section. It's hard to go wrong, but if you want help, those websites can sometimes help visualize what it will look like."

Sounders ticket exchange has some really good deals for Saturday...  Sounders Ticket Exchange  If you want the experience (the chanting, singing, etc) I see two General Admission tickets for $36/ea. That puts you right in the middle of it.   However, that is terrible if you actually want to watch the game. If that is what you are looking for, there are 2 in 110 for $45/ea. That is almost dead center and will give you a much better view of the game."
SoundersFC,36iu2o,overruns,2,Wed May 20 15:34:33 2015 UTC,I always check ticketmaster and look at the resale stuff. Sometimes you can find a deal in there.

I've been up in the 300 and the views are great up there. They all have advantages and disadvantages.   The Pro Shop in the stadium and the little stands have scarves. Get a scarf.

SoundersFC,35ym5w,AtSignAlejandro,3,Fri May 15 03:46:43 2015 UTC,It's not possible for two American teams to be drawn into the same group. Same goes for Mexican clubs. S2 would have to beat a Mexican club and qualify for the knockout round in order to possibly play the Sounders.

SoundersFC,35o6zf,crollaa,1 point,Tue May 12 03:46:58 2015 UTC,I'm curious what sort of adjustments we made toward the end there; we seemed to only need another 5 minutes or so to put up another goal. Perhaps the game just opened up because Columbus was getting tired considering how much offensive pressure they were putting up.  Edit: Do you happen to know what the best palce for stats is? I am always looking for as much stat information as possible. Does the opta stuff get published anywhere regularly? I wish I had a membership with them just so I could read stuff with as much detail as possible.
SoundersFC,35o6zf,clickmyface,1 point,Tue May 12 16:30:20 2015 UTC,"The substitutions helped a ton. Neagle and Barrett brought on some energy that we were sorely lacking for most of the game. Neagle actually provided some width on the left (which was non existent with Pappa on) and he was able to have a few dangerous moments like in the 72nd minute and also just before the second goal the failed cross that he recovered - Pappa never would have been there.  On the flip side, Columbus moving Parkhurst up to Dmid screwed up their defensive rotations in the midfield. It allowed Dempsey and Martins to actually receive the ball in zone 14 a couple times where they're most dangerous."
SoundersFC,35o6zf,clickmyface,1 point,Tue May 12 16:45:12 2015 UTC,"Do you think we should have made a third sub? If so, who?   Also, any thoughts you have on my edit above would be great. Looking for the best resource for complete match statistics."
SoundersFC,35o6zf,clickmyface,1 point,Tue May 12 16:50:21 2015 UTC,"I'm usually a fan of using all 3 subs, but I'm not sure what I would've done here. We didn't really have any more attacking options on the bench. Maybe Leo on at left mid, Neagle on the right, Barrett as a target forward and Dempsey and Martins just underneath him. Basically it just frees up Martins to make thru runs.  As far as stats go, there's not a lot out there. I usually just look at the chalkboard to see things like how Alonso basically was taken out of the game defensively."
SoundersFC,35o6zf,clickmyface,1 point,Tue May 12 17:09:35 2015 UTC,"Dang, that's annoying. I know they track stats with as much depth as baseball etc but it seems like only a few sites actually access them and not in a timely manner. Opta tracks pass % by player, interceptions, key passes, etc. Would be interesting to have access to that for every match.   Where do you coach?"

SoundersFC,35m959,SvanirePerish,2,Tue May 12 02:11:20 2015 UTC,"Supposedly he is a fast, technically skilled, creative playmaker; has played attacking midfield centrally and on either side. In earlier years, he drew stylistic comparisons to Erik Lamela and Kaka.  On our roster, that makes him a natural competitor with Neagle and Pappa for starting minutes - although he provides a distinctly different stylistic threat to either of those. An outside mid who is fast, skilled on the dribble, can see and hit the killer pass or cross, and has a high speed of play could do a lot to punish teams that try to pack the center and defend 1v1 or 2v2 out wide against us.  It would also give us three real offensive threats out wide - Neagle, Pappa, and him. That opens the possibility of bringing one of them on with fresh legs 60 or 70 minutes in, which could give other teams conniptions (it often did last year!).  Of course, that's best-case. I haven't seen him play beyond highlights; I have no idea whether he's actually ready for that role in MLS."
SoundersFC,35m959,stealth_sloth,1 point,Tue May 12 12:22:09 2015 UTC,Do you see him as a signing to compete for minutes now or is this a next year kind of signing?

SoundersFC,35hjzb,hhdslater,19,Sun May 10 13:00:10 2015 UTC,"As far as I can make sense of it, the powerpoint presentation would go something like this.   We hired away Sigi Schmid, the year after he won them the MLS Cup. At least one expat Portland fan got Columbus riled up and started ACES (Any Club Except Seattle) there.  The simmering jealousy/hatred of us by them has been a one-sided thing since. We do have two of their better players from 2008, Marshall and Evans.   We did completely humiliate them 6-2 at Columbus in 2010. The whole American Outlaws / ECS ""hired Capo"" fiasco.  Opinions are varied here, but the outline is American Outlaws asked Emerald City Supporters if they'd come help organize fans for the big USMNT qualifier in Columbus.  They did this apparently without Hudson Street or any of the other supporter groups in Columbus being aware.  So without knowing that, American Outlaws' Seattle guy said yes he'd be happy to try and help.  Once the social justice on twitter of all the various factions had various outrages over this, the situation got spun up into ""SEATTLE WHO CANNOT CHEER WITHOUT CAPOS THINKS IT NEEDS TO BARGE INTO COLUMBUS AND TEACH COLUMBUS FANS HOW TO BE REAL FANS WHEN SEATTLE IS PLASTIC PITCH PLASTIC GROUPON BANDWAGONER FANS WHO ONLY EXIST SINCE 2009 WHO ONLY CHEER WHEN THE SCOREBOARD SAYS TO HUR DUR STUPID FLOUNDERS""   And I think that's about everything.  We stole their coach, we have had success with him, this pissed them off, and everything since has been seen in that light.  And the AO thing was just a shitshow clusterfuck of Seattle fans being pulled into something they never asked for but wound up getting blamed for.  No good deed goes unpunished.

SoundersFC,35hjzb,Whudevs,6,Sun May 10 16:50:01 2015 UTC,"I'm from Orlando. Seattle first sports team I ever got into, taught me to like sports blah blah.   I have a friend from Ohio who I won't even talk to about MLS. He's always saying stuff about how the Crew are a small market team and they have it so unfair. He hates Orlando just because he says they take attention away from his small market team. You can see a Crew fan in an above comment saying something about it too.  Crew fans, you just go buy a sports car or a large truck, I hear that helps."
SoundersFC,35hjzb,lamacchia,25,Mon May 11 11:48:29 2015 UTC,"Honestly, no matter what Columbus fans may say, there's no on-the-field rivalry. We don't like your fans. Your fans, well, they don't care about us until we start saying we don't like them. And then it's all ""No one likes us we don't care."" So, yeah. It's a one-sided beef between fanbases.   Source: Am Columbus fan."
SoundersFC,35hjzb,lamacchia,3,Sun May 10 13:58:18 2015 UTC,"I don't really understand that though - how did you guys come to the conclusion that we don't care about you? First of all, I don't think it's even that true. Second, most sports fan bases don't really ""care"" about each other at all. At the end of the day, every single fan base of any team in any sport is only going to ""care"" about itself. That's not really unique to us. It seems like getting angry at a team because they don't care about you only adds more fuel to their fire for why not to care about you.  I'm actually trying to understand it from your point of view, and I legitimately get where some anger can come from with regard to Sigi, Marshall and Evans, but other than that, this whole thing seems so arbitrary."
SoundersFC,35hjzb,my_lucid_nightmare,2,Sun May 10 20:05:07 2015 UTC,"Because one of the unofficial mantras of SSFC Supporters is ""No Likes us we don't care (Exhibit A)."" We, for myraid philosophical soccer supporter bullshit reasons, hate you guys and you guys, because you don't understand the hate nor the fact that one group of sports fans can hate another group of sports fans based on purely ideological reasons and not because of anything that has ever happened on (or related to)the field-of-play, don't care about us.   (for the record, I was literally in the room when Sigi handed his scarf to Robert and we all did a shot from a bottle that had been put on the shelf when Sir Sigmund the Rotund first came to town, and I can say honestly that: Yes, losing Sigi sucked. But your ownership offered him a job, our ownership didn't. That's on The Hunt Sports Group, 100%)  It's not your fault you don't understand. You're not meant to understand.  Sometimes it's ok if rivalries are mostly one-sided. When it comes to sports, everyone needs someone to hate. We hate y'all (among others) just like you guys hate RSL (among others). Logical? Hell no. But this is sports - in America. We rely on geography, tradition and pure unbridled emotion when constructing out allegiances. As a league, MLS is a bit lacking on tradition, the geography is a joke/somewhat inconsequential and so we go with what tugs at our heartstrings.    So... don't overthink it, fellow MLSer. It's just a thing that matters to 1 of 20 teams for 1 of 52 weeks a year (god forbid we ever meet in an MLS Cup) and it really isn't worth giving more than a passing chuckle."

SoundersFC,35hjzb,my_lucid_nightmare,6,Mon May 11 03:16:37 2015 UTC,"Crew fan here, its mostly because of the manner where you totally bought out our image. During and after the 2008 season, we were the ideal small market team. But then you threw more money at Sigi Schmid then we possibly could, during our title winning campaign. That and you took Chad from us.  Edit: lol great I get downvoted for polietly  explaining too you guys why some of us hate you. Keep up your ""not caring about anyone else"" and your zero mls cups."
SoundersFC,35hjzb,supahotfyah,15,Sun May 10 14:26:07 2015 UTC,"""Bought out your image?""  You are aware possibly that the Sounders 2009 had about 8 USL Sounders on the team, guys like Levesque and Le Toux and Scott, guys who had been winning USL titles together for the previous six years (2 titles, many playoff qualifications, 2008 quarterfinal USOC Open Cup**) under Hanauer and Schmetzer from 2002 to 2007.  We already had an image, a strong USL org from a strong soccer playing region since the 1970s.  Sigi Schmid, ex UCLA, ex LA Galaxy coach, who also coached for a few years at Columbus, took the offer from the MLS Sounders org to move back to the West Coast and join fellow German expat coach Brian Schmetzer and build a new team up.  That's not buying anyone's image.  That's being the MLS version of who we already were.  Sigi Schmid made Columbus, not the other way around.  Look, just because you copied Dortmund's crest and colors doesn't make you The German Team in America.  Schmid is allowed to take a job elsewhere if he wants to.  Naturally that means you hate us forever, and you think you matter here.  GG, you beat up our midfield pretty well last night.  Now take your home W, your burning scoreboard and your midwest middle of a cornfield inferiority complex and GTFO.  Our image has been set since the 1970s through four leagues:  Strong local team, strong local ownership, punching above our weight nationally.  Once Hanauer linked up with Joe Roth's money and Paul Allen's First and Goal stadium front office help, the Sounders were always going to be exactly who we are: The only expansion team in MLS who never had a losing record, or who has been competitive from the start of our time in MLS.  Continuing who we have been since the 1970s.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seattle_Sounders_%28disambiguation%29  Please study it out before you think that we were nothing before Schmid.  Quite the opposite.  We were a strong local owner who suddenly had deep pockets to allow him to continue what he'd already been doing for 6 years, and what the city had already been doing for 33, now 41,  years.  ** That USOC 2008 Open Cup was great in Sounders lore because we were destroyed by the Charlestown Battery and some guy they had in Defensive Mid, Osvaldo Alonso.  Hanauer was working on signing him after that night."
SoundersFC,35hjzb,Ckiser19,-12,Sun May 10 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"Already had an image   Maybe in the USL, but not in the MLS.  Sigi took us too our first title ever. We loved him, and you threw money at him until he left. I have no idea why you wouldn't find that upsetting if that happened too you. Oh wait, you still haven't won the cup yet, so I guess you couldn't imagine how it would feel.   Lol copied Dortmunds crest? Do you even know what Dortmund's crest looks like? Anyway I guess you don't know what our colors stand for either (not that I'd expect you too, I have no idea why you're green). It stands for the yellow of construction, as columbus is a traditionally blue collar city.  I don't think we are trying to be ""the german team."" We recognized that we have a very big german population in the city, now and in the past. I have never heard anyone trying too push the image of us being a german team before.  Not sure why you are bringing up so much hate for columbus, isn't the point of this thread stating why we hate you when you don't hate us?"
SoundersFC,35hjzb,my_lucid_nightmare,10,Sun May 10 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"I understand you're angry they Sigi left, but to use the argument that ""We threw money at him"" is a little strange. That's pro sports, it happens, players and coaches will leave for money, and to find a new challenge. No reason to hold a grudge, it's the way the game is nowadays."
SoundersFC,35hjzb,my_lucid_nightmare,6,Sun May 10 21:18:54 2015 UTC,"I suspect if you live in the middle of cornfields and someone poaches your coach, you get salty.  Sucks to be them, I guess.

SoundersFC,35hjzb,thegodsarepleased,2,Sun May 10 22:27:53 2015 UTC,No we thought he wouldn't leave in a disrespectful manner. You illegally opened negotiations with him during our title run.

SoundersFC,35gcyd,Skuby_Duby_Du,41,Sun May 10 02:17:49 2015 UTC,Your first mistake is to pay attention to Facebook comments.
SoundersFC,35gcyd,RubiksSugarCube,1 point,Sun May 10 03:00:06 2015 UTC,I make several mistakes. I always read comments on everything I read. It's miserable.
SoundersFC,35gcyd,Nekokeki,12,Tue May 12 04:59:12 2015 UTC,"That is pretty bad, and it gives credit to the arguments that our fans are pompous and don't know anything about the actual game. But there are the same kinds of people in every team's comments; we just have more fans and, by extension, more dumb fans.   As a longtime fan of multiple Seattle sports teams (especially the Seahawks before 2012) it feels weird to be one of the most hated teams in the league... But that's an inevitable consequence of success, and I'd rather be successful than not."
SoundersFC,35gcyd,Chauncemeister,4,Sun May 10 03:07:38 2015 UTC,"I chose the Sounders cause they were my local team. But goddamn some of our fans are annoying. I didn't get much into soccer until I moved to Brazil, but I see why other teams hate us so much. We have awesome fan support but it sometimes feels like we do act like we are better than everyone. I hate this type of attitude."
SoundersFC,35gcyd,ajrcoyote,2,Sun May 10 03:27:38 2015 UTC,"Numerically we have more people at our games than anyone in MLS, by a wide margin.  On line, we often are the biggest single brigade of fan bases, which by simple math means we'll have more inbreds as well as quite a few more good fans."
SoundersFC,35gcyd,my_lucid_nightmare,-1,Mon May 11 02:48:18 2015 UTC,"We don't act like we're better than everyone, just the one's we're better than."
SoundersFC,35gcyd,ravegreener,3,Sun May 10 05:38:42 2015 UTC,"Although I agree a substantial amount of such comments can be stupid, the examples you've chosen are pretty subjective.  ""Big-name players"" besides Clint and Oba may not include those you have mentioned. Ljungberg fits the description without a doubt, but just because a couple guys won trophies here and there, regardless of league or relevance, does not mean that they are ""world-class"" stars everyone MUST associate as a big name player. I would not call Tiffert or Flaco 'big name' players compared to the three previously listed, and like it or not if you kept up with Traore's European career, you'll know he never really 'made it' in Liverpool. He won the CL with them yes, but his position wasn't solidified on the team.  And as for the Evans comment, I've been on the anti-CB Evans train from the start of the season, and I don't intend to get off. One good game does not justify one's position for the rest of the season, and so far we are still conceding goals we should not be letting in pretty often (Colorado, NYCFC, ....San Jose). It's not that I think he is hopeless in that position, but more so that we should make a genuine effort to sign a player who actually specializes in that position, freeing up Evans to be placed elsewhere in the midfield and replacing him with a player who has had an entire career of experience playing that position, not a few games.  Long story short, if you're going to complain about the absurdity of others, at least use more obvious examples. Just because we make an effort to discuss our team in more ""subject-specific"" websites like this subreddit does not completely justify our knowledge and/or passion compared to people on Facebook, or the 'general' crowd per say. We might know more about certain things, but you can't just start making generalizations."
SoundersFC,35gcyd,vershastri,2,Sun May 10 09:36:26 2015 UTC,This. The OP can't lump other logical arguments in along with comments from people who don't even know LA has been awarded another team and then call them all stupid because they're on Facebook.  For instance the Anti Brad Evans at CB group is arguing against a player playing out of position which has clearly resulted in goals against. It takes knowledge of tactics and positioning. Maybe the OP disagrees with them but don't use the logical fallacy of making these people wrong by association.

SoundersFC,35gcyd,vershastri,1 point,Sun May 10 18:56:47 2015 UTC,This post was probably a culmination of a lot of frustration with the FB group. The comments on there are consistently really bad after a loss. I finally got fed up and left because it was just so stupidly negative sometimes.

SoundersFC,35g8e1,MowwMoww,19,Sun May 10 01:31:18 2015 UTC,"We deserved the loss (although that near comeback was impressive). However, the officiating at the end was absolutely awful with regard to keeping track of Columbus time wasting. There should have been another 30 seconds to a minute tacked on during stoppage time due to the time wasting, not to mention I thought that the original 4 minutes added on wasn't enough because of all the start and stop fouls that were happening. Not to make excuses though - we deserved to lose. But whenever you see a team wasting time like that in the EPL, you always see the ref go over to the players and tell them that he's keeping track of all that. No excuse for letting that shit slide."
SoundersFC,35g8e1,hhdslater,3,Sun May 10 01:38:52 2015 UTC,"It always bothers me how much time is wasted in stoppage time and then the ref doesn't add any time. Time wasting will continue to happen and be effective unless the ref adds on that time, which is within their discretion.  I'm mostly talking about this issue in general, not just this game.  Columbus actually did a great job of killing the clock with their play."
SoundersFC,35g8e1,chewypike,2,Sun May 10 04:54:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, they were profesh about it and I'd be stoked if we killed the clock that efficiently. But yeah, the refs just need to be way more on top of wasted time during the actual stoppage time."
SoundersFC,35g8e1,hhdslater,1 point,Sun May 10 04:59:55 2015 UTC,"Agree regarding the time wasting. It's such a bore, even when my team is doing it.  I'd love to see:   Real stoppage time. 4th official tracks stoppage in real time and adds it at 100%, rounded up to the full minute. Players coming off for injury in the last 15 minutes need to stay off until their team controls the ball during a stoppage. (i.e. their team is taking a throw in, goal kick, corner kick, free kick, penalty kick.) Yellow cards issued for time wasting (and simulation) by DisCo the following week."

SoundersFC,35g8e1,Syuk_Dat_Deke,1 point,Mon May 11 18:08:19 2015 UTC,"Well, that one's just official soccer rules. You can't be offside if the ball's in front of you. As far as MLS, they probably have their rules listed somewhere on their site."
SoundersFC,35g8e1,PeperonyNChease,3,Tue May 12 05:18:29 2015 UTC,God the defense played awful tonight
SoundersFC,35g8e1,jaschac,2,Tue May 12 15:12:27 2015 UTC,I won't sugarcoat it - that was an ugly game. Hopefully they put it behind them and continue playing like they have the last few weeks.
SoundersFC,35g8e1,vuduwastaken,2,Sun May 10 01:47:31 2015 UTC,"Not much to add that hasn't already been said. That game just kinda' sucked.   That said, I'm disappointed that, once again, Sigi didn't use all of his subs. It isn't required of course, nor am I suggesting (even jokingly) #sigiOut, but in a game where we looked so drained I would have liked to see more use of fresh-legs."

SoundersFC,35g8e1,thegodsarepleased,-2,Sun May 10 01:51:35 2015 UTC,"Unlike last week, we should have won this, but we didn't. Our back line was weak, and if it weren't for Frei we would have lost by a bigger margin.  Our offense was meh. Good on Demp for putting 2 in.  I can't imagine the salt from our new apparent rivals if we would have tied it up. Frankly, I couldn't care less about the Crew or their fan base. They aren't relevant to us. Loved some of their super original chants tonight though."

SoundersFC,35g8e1,SliceOfTony,2,Sun May 10 19:34:46 2015 UTC,"totally.. Which made USMNT reaching out to Seattle all the more weird.  Like Columbus and Outlaws weren't getting along or something, and Seattle winds up getting blamed."
SoundersFC,35g8e1,my_lucid_nightmare,-2,Sun May 10 19:42:56 2015 UTC,Because Ao Seattle personel with ECS ties tried to forced their way in.
SoundersFC,35g8e1,mastermoebius,3,Sun May 10 19:45:20 2015 UTC,"How could they ""force their way in"" if AO didn't invite them?  It's all old news, but really, we're out here on the Coast and could give a flying f about Columbus Ohio, yet suddenly we're all motivated to jump on planes and come teach you guys how to be better fans.  Right.  Drew Carey is all but forgotten here, he has done like no public appearances in Seattle in 5 years, and probably won't unless they specifically request it.  He gets distracted easily and is gone.  Shiny shiny.   Other than get us launched into MLS, he really hasn't done much but cheerlead a bit.    Adrian Hanauer who owned Seattle since 2002 USL is our nerve center.  Brian Schmetzer who coached those USL Sounders to multiple titles in USL is still on the staff.  Sigi took our offer and became our coach.  That probably did rustle some jimmies out east.   But Sigi was a West Coast guy before he took the job in Columbus anyway.  You're just not that fucking important to us.  Even after a 3-2 loss.   GG by the way.  Higuain tore up the middle of the field all night, we had no answer.  Enjoy your W and GTFO."

SoundersFC,35g8e1,joylongdivision,1 point,Sun May 10 01:49:49 2015 UTC,"Would like to see Leo next week. Didn't think Remick played well at all, though honestly Columbus knew how to exploit him.   Frei was good, kept us in it in the first half, would give MOTM to either him or Dempsey."
SoundersFC,35g8e1,k_princess,5,Sun May 10 01:34:22 2015 UTC,Looked to me like every attack came from the right side of our defense honestly. Brad was beaten numerous times and Kamara exploited their left wing.
SoundersFC,35g8e1,vuduwastaken,1 point,Sun May 10 01:34:47 2015 UTC,"I put Remick directly at fault on Kamara's second goal, he got caught ball watching and out of position twice in a row and had two chances to cut out the crosses.   Mears wasn't good tonight either, don't get me wrong, but Remick seems to struggle when the ball isn't on his side, and veteran creative players like Higuain and Pedro Morales next week seem to know how to exploit that and Higuain did tonight. He just looked lost and got completely burnt by Findley when really they should've scored.   Maybe I'm being a bit harsh because honestly the whole defense sucked, but I wouldn't mind the more veteran Leo back there next week."

SoundersFC,35c97z,scyth3s,3,Sat May 9 11:12:08 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Premier League, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place."

The management, some players, the supporters and heart and soul are all the same.  Plus, how can they possibly be salty about Brad Evans? Be mad at your team for not protecting him! We just took the best of what was available.   And Sigi? WTF? He was off contract, MLS found no wrong-doing. We were not ""fined"" we simply had to pay Crew for rights.  The whole capo/USAvMEX thing is blown way out of proportion, but I'll tell you it paints columbus is a pretty shitty light too. I'm not a fan of how Shawn Wheeler handled that whole thing (and I'm not really a fan of his in general), and I certainly can't stand the ""fight and win"" guy, but the inferiority complex is strong with columbus.

The entire pass sequence let Ozzie and Pineda pick the best time, but the key sequence (Remick-Ozzie-Deuce-Oba) took less than three seconds to complete.

SoundersFC,34y0yv,trickjarrett,4,Tue May 5 17:07:29 2015 UTC,All throughout his career he has played attacking mid as well as forward/striker/withdrawn forward. I would call him a secondary striker as well as a forward at times.
SoundersFC,34y0yv,MowwMoww,1 point,Tue May 5 19:20:09 2015 UTC,He was indeed the tip of the diamond. However there is a difference between players playing out of position vs something they have played at regularly. Not sure he's really a CAM instead of just a deep lying SS.
SoundersFC,34y0yv,MowwMoww,3,Tue May 5 22:30:50 2015 UTC,"Brad Evans should also have CM and RM listed. Andy Rose could have RM listed as well and CM is his main role, not DM.

SoundersFC,34y0yv,sideburnsy,3,Tue May 5 22:28:43 2015 UTC,Midfielders are hard because they rarely stick to one position unless they're like Alonso and just sit in the middle for their whole career. You could probably put most midfielders in the world under every midfield position and it'd be at least semi-correct.

SoundersFC,34u6xk,redundantdevil,1 point,Mon May 4 20:14:20 2015 UTC,Looks like Ricketts in goal. So I vote Portland.
SoundersFC,34u6xk,SuperSounderHawk,2,Thu May 7 02:30:58 2015 UTC,"Well, there is this but the res is crap. Looks like RSL from the video (to me) but it was against Portland on July 13, 2014.  edit: was going to link to this highlights video which has the camera angle at the 6:00m mark."
SoundersFC,34u6xk,nikdahl,1 point,Mon May 4 19:32:53 2015 UTC,"I can't look right now, but I believe it was a Pappa goal vs. Portland."
SoundersFC,34u6xk,povvy,1 point,Mon May 4 16:38:07 2015 UTC,I remember this moment and I remember making the gif but I can't remember who scored and I can't remember which match it was. If someone tells me which match I can find it.

SoundersFC,34u6xk,stealth_sloth,1 point,Mon May 4 20:19:08 2015 UTC,"I forgot about Oba's little happy dance after the goal. The goal, the game, and the dance combine for a huge grin on my face."
SoundersFC,34s5wk,SvanirePerish,4,Mon May 4 02:32:51 2015 UTC,I don't think I want us in the top 5 for saves...
SoundersFC,34s5wk,fossyg,2,Mon May 4 17:05:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's a double edged sword that statistic."
SoundersFC,34s5wk,pinkal_peaches,1 point,Mon May 4 20:50:02 2015 UTC,That is almost purely from the Colorado game where they took a ton of shots from far out. Most of them were easy stops for Frei.  I know what you mean though.
SoundersFC,34s5wk,The_77th_orange,6,Mon May 4 23:16:36 2015 UTC,Not to forget Lamar Neagle who is #4 for shots on goal. But that just means he doesn't take a lot of good shots..
SoundersFC,34s5wk,theREALbmills,6,Mon May 4 02:33:41 2015 UTC,"But hey, at least he's not #1 at taking bad shots!"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,MowwMoww,15,Mon May 4 01:07:56 2015 UTC,Great last save by Frei. Holy SHIT!
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Arkyncrest,5,Mon May 4 01:10:34 2015 UTC,"Could we get a gif of this, please?"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,SuperSounderHawk,15,Mon May 4 02:02:05 2015 UTC,One of these days I'm going to stop being shocked by what Oba and Clint do. It's unbelievable.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,btener412,4,Mon May 4 01:19:33 2015 UTC,What amazes me with these two guys is they come. right. through. the. fucking. middle!  Seems like every time.  I love my Sounders.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,caduceus,13,Mon May 4 07:20:18 2015 UTC,Was it me or did the pitch seem narrow?
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Bandelino24,8,Mon May 4 01:08:33 2015 UTC,"I can't tell if you're saying this out of sarcasm, but Yankee stadiums pitch is like 5-6 yards narrower than a standard pitch."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,_Anthropophobiac_,5,Mon May 4 01:10:18 2015 UTC,Yes. It was 70 yards across while usual fields are 75 yards.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Audicity,6,Mon May 4 01:10:26 2015 UTC,"No it wasn't sarcasm, I just genuinely didn't know.  But shouldn't all pitches be the same dimensions?"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Bandelino24,10,Mon May 4 01:27:06 2015 UTC,"FIFA sets a size range for fields (it's sort of like baseball, but a little more standardized).   it has to be longer than it is wide it has to be between 50 and 100 yards wide (yes, 50) it has to be 100 to 130 yards long   That being said, it's more tightly controlled for international matches (and what most ""real"" fields use:   70 to 80 yards wide 110 to 120 yards long   Also, all goal areas are the same size, no matter the field."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,7,Mon May 4 01:37:31 2015 UTC,Did you have the volume off...?
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Schwa142,0,Mon May 4 01:30:19 2015 UTC,"In a perfect world, yes. Also, we wouldn't have teams that are carbon copies of premier league clubs, and we wouldn't be playing in a baseball stadium to begin with either.  Such is life though."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,_Anthropophobiac_,2,Mon May 4 01:30:01 2015 UTC,"Not sure if sarcasm -  Yeah, it's only 70 yards wide since it's a baseball stadium"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,1 point,Mon May 4 01:09:09 2015 UTC,It looked like they were just playing in the outfield of the baseball field.  Pretty interesting to watch as an equally big baseball fan.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hey_kool_aid,13,Mon May 4 01:11:11 2015 UTC,"Excellent match. We should have won, and we did, simple as that.  MOTM for me is between Oba and Frei. Frei had some fantastic saves, but Oba was on fire tonight.  Oh, and that flop call, total bullshit."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,_Anthropophobiac_,11,Mon May 4 01:11:27 2015 UTC,Yeah the ref fucking sucked. for both teams.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,moon_monster,6,Mon May 4 01:19:54 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure that was one of the worst calls in MLS I've ever seen this season.  Trip -- check.  Defender didn't touch the ball -- check.    It wasn't egregious, and I'd be fine with a no-call.  But yellow on Oba?  You gotta be kidding me."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,caduceus,12,Mon May 4 07:18:24 2015 UTC,"Oba was awesome, but let's give it to Frei because he was manificent too and he doesn't get it as often."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,warox13,2,Mon May 4 01:21:04 2015 UTC,Deal.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,_Anthropophobiac_,8,Mon May 4 01:23:34 2015 UTC,"Yeah I'm not positive he was fouled, but I really don't think you can call a yellow for simulation unless they BEG YOU FOR A FOUL."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,scyth3s,1 point,Mon May 4 01:14:20 2015 UTC,Completely agree.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,_Anthropophobiac_,4,Mon May 4 01:23:25 2015 UTC,"So many players were great tonight, we could make a solid case for a handful of MotMs. Frei had some incredible saves, Dempsey's assists, goal, and overall ball control, Mears and Remmick did an incredible job on the backline as well as Evans and Marshall. So many glimpses of brilliance all around."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Aurick,1 point,Mon May 4 01:22:44 2015 UTC,"Very true, when you put it that way we might as well just call it the Men of the Match. They had great chemistry tonight, and save for some minor errors they played a fantastic match which is why they won by the margin they did."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,_Anthropophobiac_,2,Mon May 4 01:25:17 2015 UTC,"I think Dempsey will rate higher than Oba tonight. Oba scored on beaty heads up service by Dempsey and Pappa whereas Dempsey scored by being Dempsey. Frei kept our heads in the game with some beautiful saves. Overall, great performance by everyone."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,clickmyface,7,Mon May 4 01:36:31 2015 UTC,"Exciting second half, but man NYCFC is a mess. They were terrible on set pieces, terrible defense on counter attacks, wasteful in possession, etc. David Villa looks frustrated, those long shots of his were pointless but they're a result of NYC's lack of presence in the final third.  Kreis' subs made no sense to me at all. He still had a shot at winning the game but takes two of the better players off.  The goals from Seattle were great, the first one was probably my favorite."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,JohnnySnowstorm,9,Mon May 4 01:15:52 2015 UTC,"Great game, but the reffing was a joke and both teams got screwed over on multiple occasions."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hhdslater,7,Mon May 4 01:23:58 2015 UTC,At least he was consistent!
SoundersFC,34rwrd,peterquest,4,Mon May 4 01:28:12 2015 UTC,lol true I guess! Consistent shit vs. inconsistent mediocrity. That is the question.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hhdslater,7,Mon May 4 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"Lots of great play out there tonight, it is ridiculous how dangerous we are when everything is flowing.  Dempsey gets MotM for me.  His goal through the legs of the defender was fantastic, but his incredible assist to Martins to cap off that string of passes was amazing."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,AgentMulder_FBI,6,Mon May 4 01:17:03 2015 UTC,"Some of the midfield one- and two-touch play we saw this game is among the best I can ever recall seeing out of the Sounders. The consistency wasn't there, but there were great flashes of promise."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,stealth_sloth,2,Mon May 4 01:17:38 2015 UTC,"I agree, the midfield possession was incredible. They one and two touched out of situations I was positive we were going to give the ball up on"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,nemisys1st,4,Mon May 4 15:41:39 2015 UTC,"There were some great moments of quick, short-pass possession by the Sounders.  I'm assuming that Sigi gave them freedom to play this way due to the size of the pitch but I hope to see more of it this season."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,nimbledinosaur,2,Mon May 4 01:20:08 2015 UTC,The freedom? That's Sigi's favorite style of play.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Aurick,4,Mon May 4 03:07:25 2015 UTC,"My MOTM has to be Mears, played with such intensity, I saw him really getting fired up and had some crucial clearances. Runner up for it had to be Oba, the man's on fire. Great game, bring on Columbus! Edit: Honorable mention to Frei, played great, commanded the line, and had a great save on Villa."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,AtSignAlejandro,9,Mon May 4 01:21:53 2015 UTC,"Loved Mears attitude toward the end there too. The ref was silly, and Mears verifying several times before his throw in that he had the right ball and that he was in the right spot was hilarious. The amount of whistles in that match...."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,clickmyface,3,Mon May 4 01:38:08 2015 UTC,"Alexis Lalas is an idiot, but who was the main commentator? Aside from Casey Keller, I think he's the best American soccer commentator. We need more like him."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hhdslater,6,Mon May 4 03:17:47 2015 UTC,"John Strong - former Portland timbers announcer.   As goofy as Ross Fletcher is, I wish he was able to call the national tv cast games. It's rare I hear him these days because I'm at all the home games, and I think all or most of our away games have been national broadcast"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,BugSTi,3,Mon May 4 05:01:29 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah, that's how I recognize his voice. Yeah lol, Ross Fletcher kinda sounds like a muppet, but I love it."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hhdslater,1 point,Mon May 4 05:03:12 2015 UTC,"I'm OK with Strong, he's a competent voice and he thoroughly gets Seattle's place in the world, e.g. the Timbers' worst nightmare; he is on the call from the 2009 USOC ""48 seconds"" goal to the 4-4 comeback after the 80th minute last year.  He understands the Cascadian point of view, I like that, even if he's a dirty Timber at heart."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,my_lucid_nightmare,1 point,Mon May 4 14:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when side by side with Lalas, he stands out, but I just can't shake that Portland association.   He does seem to have made a quick transition though."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,BugSTi,6,Mon May 4 15:41:55 2015 UTC,Rose at right wing. He did well.  Interested to see how that develops
SoundersFC,34rwrd,thewanderingsounder,3,Mon May 4 03:37:15 2015 UTC,"I'd like to see more of this. It really worked out, we had so many offensive options."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,pinkal_peaches,2,Mon May 4 03:57:21 2015 UTC,That third goal tho.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hhdslater,2,Mon May 4 01:22:56 2015 UTC,Oba for MotM.  Fantastic match by Dempsey and Frei.   Looked like a solid unit out there tonight.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,freddo411,2,Mon May 4 06:12:22 2015 UTC,"Bonus Pappa clip was a kip up, not a flip. Just sayin'"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,hottoddy,2,Mon May 4 06:41:06 2015 UTC,"That game could have easily ended 6-1 for us. There were chances we barely missed or a certain someone didn't miss easy shots.  MotM: Either Dempsey or Martins. They both were working so well together today, the 2nd half was such a fun half to watch them play with each other."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Audicity,9,Mon May 4 01:09:59 2015 UTC,It also easily could have ended in a loss for us. NYCFC had a hell of a lot of shots -- Frei played well.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Squirrels_Gone_Wild,3,Mon May 4 01:12:31 2015 UTC,"Agreed, NY had way more chances but our D did pretty well and Frei as on fire."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Audicity,2,Mon May 4 01:13:37 2015 UTC,"Eh. They had maybe 2 or 3 decent shots. The rest seemed like soft shots or just completely went to the sides of the goal.  But agreed, Frei played lights out today."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,SuperSounderHawk,1 point,Mon May 4 01:17:07 2015 UTC,"I unfortunately missed the game. Though I hear Remick, Frei and others made some highlight saves/blocks. Could the gif gods provide these for our entertainment. Thanks!"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Aurick,2,Mon May 4 02:04:52 2015 UTC,Our back line had seriously so many crazy plays. Hopefully the condensed match shows even half of them.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,SuperSounderHawk,2,Mon May 4 03:11:12 2015 UTC,"Given the overall lack of highlights from this season's batch of match highlights the league puts out, I don't have high hopes. This is precisely why I'm asking for gifs."
SoundersFC,34rwrd,ajrcoyote,1 point,Mon May 4 04:05:22 2015 UTC,Remick has been awesome lately. The first game I saw him play was against Red Bulls and he conceded a penalty. Glad he is proving my initial impression of him wrong
SoundersFC,34rwrd,thewanderingsounder,0,Mon May 4 21:02:07 2015 UTC,Rose at right wing. He did well.  Interested to see how that develops
SoundersFC,34rwrd,thewanderingsounder,1 point,Mon May 4 03:37:24 2015 UTC,Rose at right wing. He did well.  Interested to see how that develops
SoundersFC,34rwrd,VivanteImperii,1 point,Mon May 4 03:37:22 2015 UTC,"Ah man, it was painful watching neagle kick it right at the the goal keeper on that break away. Regardless, the boys looked good, and I loved the creativity that led to the goals!"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,scyth3s,14,Mon May 4 01:11:19 2015 UTC,He didn't kick it right at the goal keeper-- a defender got their foot in at the very last second.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,Aurick,2,Mon May 4 01:13:45 2015 UTC,Neagle has a habit of walking every ball to the net once he's in the box. Dude needs to find a middle ground between that and cracking long goals.
SoundersFC,34rwrd,sahala,1 point,Mon May 4 03:09:57 2015 UTC,Totally agree. He had a few video-game-esque opportunities and kind of flubbed them. Similar to the way I screw up playing FIFA so who am I to judge...
SoundersFC,34rwrd,VivanteImperii,1 point,Mon May 4 03:45:29 2015 UTC,"Okay, that explains it, sorry I was on a treadmill while watching, so the replay was hard to see in detail!"
SoundersFC,34rwrd,scyth3s,1 point,Mon May 4 01:19:09 2015 UTC,Yeah the ball was just poked a little bit beyond where he intended to strike it and so his kick went completely haywire.
SoundersFC,34rlm0,MarinersStreamDude,10,Sun May 3 23:27:13 2015 UTC,Thanks.  I wish I would have seen this three hour ago.
SoundersFC,34rlm0,DronePirate,5,Mon May 4 01:44:12 2015 UTC,"Ha, me too.  Last year I was able to watch every game without needing cable, now it seems like I'm always stuck with a crappy SD stream.  Thanks though, I'll have to check this sub next time"
SoundersFC,34rlm0,elpool2,2,Mon May 4 03:17:23 2015 UTC,Same here - I will be sure to keep am eye next time. Thanks though OP!
SoundersFC,34roa4,SounderBruce,2,Sun May 3 23:51:12 2015 UTC,So shiny.
SoundersFC,34roa4,my_lucid_nightmare,2,Mon May 4 01:58:30 2015 UTC,"Yup, they've been in there since the NINETY opened. I've seen the Supporters Shield there too. Can't wait to add more!"
SoundersFC,34roa4,Aurick,1 point,Mon May 4 02:11:41 2015 UTC,Do the jersey's belong to whoever the captain was at the time?
SoundersFC,34roa4,hhdslater,1 point,Mon May 4 03:27:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think so, because Dempsey has never been captain"
SoundersFC,34roa4,Prehensile_penis_ama,5,Mon May 4 05:01:50 2015 UTC,I think they belong to the MOTM.
SoundersFC,34roa4,francostine,2,Mon May 4 05:05:40 2015 UTC,"Then, it really should be Kenny Cooper's jersey there."
SoundersFC,34roa4,IzzyIzzyIzyy,1 point,Mon May 4 16:43:20 2015 UTC,"The clubhouse is really nice, and last time I was there they said they were working on getting their liquor license.  :)"
SoundersFC,34s0p9,SonOfMechaMummy,18,Mon May 4 01:44:56 2015 UTC,Frei for keeping us in the game during the first half.
SoundersFC,34s0p9,---sniff---,2,Mon May 4 02:01:54 2015 UTC,I loved his leadership too; het was letting our boys have it when they screwed up. I'm very pleased with him this year. Gave up only one goal that most everyone is going to give up. Can't complain about that.
SoundersFC,34s0p9,clickmyface,5,Mon May 4 04:59:05 2015 UTC,"Dempsey Seemed very consistent in controlling the flow up the middle, as always his passes were spot on, he set up Oba and his goal was great. Frei is a close second for MOTM today, the dude played on top of his game tonight, great performance."
SoundersFC,34s0p9,littlenicky174,3,Mon May 4 03:13:51 2015 UTC,"I keep staring at this question, trying to narrow it down.   Frei - was great and kept us in the game during that period of ultra-high pressure. But...      ""the entire defensive line"" - ... played magnificently. They collectively looked great. But....     Martins and/or Dempsey - I don't have to explain why, do I?     Really, about the only people I didn't think were MOTM-worthy were our mids. Not that they sucked or anything, they just looked ""regular"" good."
SoundersFC,34s0p9,jaschac,4,Mon May 4 02:06:44 2015 UTC,"Pappa looked pretty sharp until he got subbed out. Helped us break pressure repeatedly, contributed a lot defensively, forced Saunders to work a bit himself, and got the first two assists.  I don't think he was man of the match, but only because I thought Frei, Dempsey, and Martins were all outstanding. On another night, a performance like Pappa's could be MotM."
SoundersFC,34s0p9,stealth_sloth,3,Mon May 4 02:34:41 2015 UTC,"Gotta give it to Oba. 2 goals, and he set up the 3rd."
SoundersFC,34s0p9,rarandy,1 point,Mon May 4 05:01:06 2015 UTC,I think Rose was integral in getting us the 3 points.
SoundersFC,34s0p9,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon May 4 11:56:47 2015 UTC,Mears had probably his best game so far. Kept saving the day for us in the back (along with Frei).
SoundersFC,34s0p9,ravegreener,1 point,Mon May 4 13:48:31 2015 UTC,Frei... Again.
SoundersFC,34s0p9,tacogrande7,4,Mon May 4 16:05:46 2015 UTC,Stefan Frei is looking bigger and bigger every game. Pretty soon he's just going to eat his own goal at the start of every match and shit it out at halftime so we can score on it.
SoundersFC,34sgrh,MowwMoww,2,Mon May 4 04:18:19 2015 UTC,Mr Dempsey! Mr Dempsey! Between the MLS Cup and the Supports Shield which is more prestigious and which hardware do you covet the most?

SoundersFC,34dhvs,aidenr,7,Thu Apr 30 17:54:48 2015 UTC,"MLS CUP, CCL, SS, OPEN CUP in that order. Unfortunately until the salary cap is increased MLS teams will not be able to make a real run in CCL. Big ups to Montreal to take it the the second half of the second leg but the superior quality showed through."
SoundersFC,34dhvs,gp2042,12,Fri May 1 01:12:00 2015 UTC,"I think the MLS Championship should be the number one goal. Until we can get over that hump a couple of times, the Open Cup and CCL should be on the far back burner."
SoundersFC,34dhvs,AlienMutantRobotDog,2,Thu Apr 30 18:14:31 2015 UTC,Agreed. I want to buy a Sounders jersey with at least one star on it.

We need to rest starters during CCL matches and focus on league play. Clear front-runner for the Shield? Don't risk splitting our attention. Somewhere in the ""playoffs likely; Shield unlikely"" range (or, worst-case, the ""no chance of making playoffs"" range)? I'm fine with us using our starters to aim for a top seed into CCL knockout and resting them on some league matches."
SoundersFC,34dhvs,stealth_sloth,4,Thu Apr 30 11:56:10 2015 UTC,"I don't view CCL as top quality football because most of the match commentary and tension involves controversial refereeing. I was fairly disgusted by the whole experience this season. The potential for injury is very high when the ref refuses to make correct calls.  We haven't won an MLS Cup yet. Clint and possibly others will be playing in the CONCACAF Gold Cup with the national team this July, the same month that I believe CCL starts. We may end up losing Dempsey even more than last year and he's already missed 2 games. That doesn't help our chances."
SoundersFC,34dhvs,clickmyface,3,Thu Apr 30 15:35:30 2015 UTC,"I don't think they've officially published the schedule for the 2015-16 CCL yet, but if it's like past years the Gold Cup should be over before CCL starts up."
SoundersFC,34dhvs,stealth_sloth,2,Thu Apr 30 19:50:16 2015 UTC,"My main concern is there will be CCL, Gold Cup, and Open Cup (Quarterfinals) all in the month of July along with 4 MLS games already on our schedule."

SoundersFC,34dhvs,clickmyface,2,Thu Apr 30 14:29:15 2015 UTC,Been saying it since they started doing interviews this season.   The most simplified version is that they want to take the club to the next level and to do that they have to start prioritizing competitions outside of MLS to make the club a global brand rather than just an MLS brand.
SoundersFC,34dhvs,MowwMoww,9,Thu Apr 30 14:30:13 2015 UTC,"They have been saying its a top priority, along with winning the Cup. Winning CCL is not ahead* of an MLS Cup, nor should it be."

This season, that's a whopping four games.    Unless we're in really dire need of wins to grab an MLS playoff spot, which we shouldn't be, we should focus 100% on those CCL games.  I'd say if we're deprioritizing anything, it should be the Open Cup, although it's unfortunately the safest bet to gain a CCL place for the next year."

Our salary cap is rising, higher quality talent is being produced and we are attracting great players abroad.   No one is going to come in on our behalf and complain. This is FIFA we are talking about. We need to overcome the challenges in front of us and show the world that the MLS is ready to compete internationally.

SoundersFC,348sy7,weeenis,6,Wed Apr 29 16:33:56 2015 UTC,"The visiting seats really suck.  If you want to have the atmosphere of your fellow fans, it might be worth it to you to sit with them.  Otherwise, I'd say go on the soudersFC.com website and follow the links to the ticket resale section.     Anything in a 100 series is closer to the field.  The fans always stand.  The whole game.  I'm not kidding.  You will want to avoid the ECS section in the south end of the field.  Things in the 200 range are out of the rain, have nice seats, and cost a bunch.  These fans sit during the game.  Seattle is very polite.  I'd expect roughly zero problems being an opposing fan.  I've got two seats in 238 row F.  $50 each if you are interested.  PM me."

SoundersFC,348sy7,freddo411,4,Thu Apr 30 15:37:12 2015 UTC,"Away fans normally sit in section 203/300. I would suggest contacting your NYRB supporter group to see if they have a group buy that you can take advantage of.       The Sounders supporters sit in section 121, 122, and 123. Avoid this area. You will not be allowed in this general admission section with NYRB gear.         I would recommend entering the North entrance. It is the main one, fast, and away from the supporters entrance.         The March-to-the-Match starts in Occidental Park. The supporters start the march 1 hour before kickoff. They will begin gathering a bit before that. The Sounders FO have an 'official' party there in the park also. Together but separate. This is plenty friendly for away fans. There is a stage with music and funny things happening. You will obviously be the minority - but it is a family friendly environment. You may get some harassment, but if you are not yourself acting crazy - fans will not act crazy towards you. I would still recommend tying your scarf. There is always someone who wants to steal an away fans scarf.         The march itself should be avoided. You don't want to be inside, in front, or behind it. The group swells quickly and takes up sidewalk to sidewalk most of the way.        If you stand along the march route - Occidental Ave - you will likely be heckled by the march. ""Who are ya"" or simply ""fuck you"" and lots of middle fingers from the supporters march is common. You may also get confronted by the supporter security team - which is to keep you separated from the march, for your own safety mainly. If you can handle some general heckling - then you'll be fine.             In all - I would avoid the supporters as much as possible, but if you aren't actively shit talking us we generally won't shit talk you. It could be overwhelming for some, which is why I suggest most away supporters stay away from the march and go directly into the stadium to the away supporters section."
SoundersFC,348sy7,cwcoleman,3,Thu Apr 30 21:08:06 2015 UTC,"Nyrb's aren't a huge rivalry like Por/Van/LaG are. I wouldn't expect much heckling.   Try contacting Century Link Field box office and ask if there is an away section for the game.   Also look into your local supporters groups and see if any of them have a traveling group. They will have the lead for tickets.   Most seats in CLink are pretty good. I prefer to not sit in the 300 level, only because I don't have to. :)"

SoundersFC,345pk4,steerbell,2,Tue Apr 28 18:30:26 2015 UTC,I am sort of bummed we will be away that date.  Do they tend to play their B teams for these matches?  I am tempted to look into the Barca/ManU match in the Bay Area.

SoundersFC,3429da,steerbell,3,Mon Apr 27 19:16:11 2015 UTC,"I love me some Dempsey but a ""Man of the Match"" goal that is not, I'm actually fairly certain from this angle it was already across the line before #2 got to it which would technically make it an Own Goal  But any win against the Timbers Army is a worthwhile one!"
SoundersFC,3429da,Jedisolid,1 point,Mon Apr 27 19:48:55 2015 UTC,"It definitely wasn't across the line until Dempsey tapped it, but it was slowly heading that way and the GK likely wouldn't have gotten to it in time. Here's a better view.  When they announced the Man of the Match at the game they may have said Dempsy, but they were showing Frei's name on the big screen...  I, for one, think Frei deserved it."
SoundersFC,3429da,Schwa142,0,Mon Apr 27 21:55:58 2015 UTC,"Even if the keeper totally flubbed it, it would almost never be considered an own goal since it was a shot on frame by Rose."

SoundersFC,33zpie,btener412,11,Mon Apr 27 05:05:16 2015 UTC,I figured the defense would struggle without Marshall. Turns out they did really well while the offense had a hard time clicking. But in the end who cares cause it's 3 points over Portland and that's fucking great!
SoundersFC,33zpie,btener412,2,Mon Apr 27 03:31:07 2015 UTC,"I agree that the defense was good enough to stop them from scoring, but didn't it seem like Portland had an easy time penetrating our back line, especially in the second half? I thought our defense from our mids and strikers was better than our back line, could be totally wrong though."
SoundersFC,33zpie,joylongdivision,1 point,Mon Apr 27 04:00:33 2015 UTC,"There were a few chances for Adi that the defense could've done better, but other than those and Urruti being 5 yards offside I think the backline did well.

SoundersFC,33zpie,jaschac,12,Mon Apr 27 06:27:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'll take it.  Fuck Portland.  Defense was solid for the most part, but I think we were lucky Porter didn't start Adi.  No Marshall would have let him have a field day.  Dempsey and Oba were off, so was Pappa.  Neagle was pretty rough.  Dempsey doing his thing, though.  As a small side note, I loved the effort from Dempsey on one of Portland's counters near the end.  Absolutely busted his ass to get back in the 80 something.  Love it."
SoundersFC,33zpie,phargarten,4,Mon Apr 27 03:33:19 2015 UTC,Clint and Oba did a great job of keeping the attack going and rushing back on defense. It's great to see a well rounded defense.
SoundersFC,33zpie,metameh,3,Mon Apr 27 03:34:52 2015 UTC,"A few semi-random thoughts:     First half: pretty universally blah. Both teams seemed content to absorb pressure...pressure that wasn't coming because both teams were ready to absorb.     Frei: Probably my MOTM. But what's up with the hair? His whole head looked...wrong.      Rose: Why are we only using him 15 or 20 minutes a game? Even if you don't want to start him, I feel like we would benefit from bringing him on sooner. He's been doing really well for us this season.    Scott & Evans: Had doubts when I realized that Marshall wouldn't be available, but both were rock solid. I think we sometimes forget that we actually did have some good defenders before Marshall arrived. :)     Important: Beating Portland is never, ever wrong. :)   3 points is 3 points, as they say. But beating Portland will always feel like 4 points to me.   Side note: There were some rumors floating around about some Brazilian attacking mid that we were pursuing. I thought I heard something about him being in the house tonight to watch the game. Anyone know anything about this? Do we really even need someone like this right now?"
SoundersFC,33zpie,phargarten,2,Mon Apr 27 04:21:08 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. Feel like Oba and Deuce are disconnected from the mid field. We go from the back to wings to our two up top. The ball comes back through the middle and Ozzie/Pineda pick up the ball and recycle. We don't have that player at the top of the diamond who can make that incisive pass up to our top guys further up the pitch. It means one of Pappa, Oba, Deuce drop in which is great, but leaves whoever's up top outnumbered. Would be nice to have more action from the midfield to increase bodies and movement in the final 3rd."
SoundersFC,33zpie,Immolater,2,Mon Apr 27 18:23:02 2015 UTC,"But what's up with the hair? His whole head looked...wrong.   Its the neck beard. If he'd shave up to his jawline he'd look normal, though cropping both your beard and hair the same length is a better look than the Kimbo Slice."

SoundersFC,33zpie,pinkal_peaches,2,Mon Apr 27 03:48:23 2015 UTC,Yeah she's great. Her No Filter series on YouTube is really great stuff. It was basically a shorter version of Garbage Time.
SoundersFC,33zpie,my_lucid_nightmare,3,Mon Apr 27 03:50:16 2015 UTC,That was the most entertaining 1-0 win I've ever seen.
SoundersFC,33zpie,qwazzy92,1 point,Mon Apr 27 03:35:06 2015 UTC,I was really hoping they would bring Rose in and it worked!  Not sure what happened there but he got in the right place and took a good shot.  Frei had the clean sheet thanks to a couple great saves.  Frei is the man.  Not digging the haircut though.
SoundersFC,33zpie,tehjimmeh,2,Mon Apr 27 03:38:49 2015 UTC,Following in the tradition of Keller and Hahnemann.  Could do a lot worse.
SoundersFC,33zpie,foxpawz,1 point,Mon Apr 27 16:25:08 2015 UTC,"A W is a W and it was against Portland. There were some rough times, but I think the performance in the second half was pretty good.   Oh, and fuck Portland."
SoundersFC,33zpfa,smokey815,2,Mon Apr 27 03:29:02 2015 UTC,"So, yeah,  I was out of town last weekend and missed it.  But we're back."
SoundersFC,340ewd,btener412,4,Mon Apr 27 08:52:30 2015 UTC,"Very small sample size.  We'd have been in pretty bad shape if Adi had played from the start.  Neither of them are anything special in the air, and that would be a major issue in a lot of situations.  That said, I did think they played pretty well yesterday.  The midfield did a good job protecting them for the most part as well."
SoundersFC,340ewd,smokey815,1 point,Mon Apr 27 13:36:34 2015 UTC,We don't really know what would have happened if Adi played from the start. He came on with not that much time left and was part of the pressure  that Timbers placed on us to even the game back up.
SoundersFC,340ewd,SuperChaiLatte,3,Mon Apr 27 15:18:46 2015 UTC,"Considering he had two really good chances in the span of 20 minutes, he would have had his fair share of more chances."
SoundersFC,340ewd,thegraduate,1 point,Mon Apr 27 17:56:06 2015 UTC,He's way better in the air than Evans or Scott. He'd have had a field day.
SoundersFC,340ewd,smokey815,3,Mon Apr 27 15:21:12 2015 UTC,I think a depleted FC Dallas and a struggling Timbers offense had a lot to do with those clean sheets.
SoundersFC,340ewd,enigmamr,2,Tue Apr 28 05:06:45 2015 UTC,They were solid but at the same time there were so many chances for Portland to score. I think we got lucky a few times.
SoundersFC,340ewd,MowwMoww,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:29:22 2015 UTC,"I do think they compliment each other, as they've been playing with each other for seven seasons now. Scott brings the experience at defense and I'm sure that Evans has been working closely with him to get better at CB. So yes, it's probably all of those things together, because they're doing something right."
SoundersFC,33z9qd,fleshbanana,8,Mon Apr 27 01:06:04 2015 UTC,"No tifo this match...  We only do one per team, so we wait until later in the season."

SoundersFC,33zzei,SonOfMechaMummy,14,Mon Apr 27 05:15:09 2015 UTC,Frei  A few killer saves kept it a clean sheet tonight.
SoundersFC,33zzei,BugSTi,7,Mon Apr 27 05:29:43 2015 UTC,Scott  Solid on defense all night. No yellow card!
SoundersFC,33zzei,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Apr 27 12:51:59 2015 UTC,"Dempsey   Obviously the goal, which he didn't do much to get the score, but credit him with the flick to set up rose. He was playing with more energy and intensity than I recall recently, and looked better than Oba this game imo."
SoundersFC,33zzei,adillen,0,Mon Apr 27 05:26:47 2015 UTC,"When they announced the Man of the Match at the game they may have said Dempsy, but they were showing Frei's name on the big screen...  I, for one, think Frei deserved it."

To bring it in you'd likely need to remove the wooden poles and bring it in rolled up. You could pass it off to an ecs member to take down, the poles are usually kept pregame at the front of GA."
SoundersFC,33udpu,hackberrydraw,2,Sat Apr 25 18:54:20 2015 UTC,Good to know.  I'll cut it from the poles and bring it in for someone in GA

As noted by /u/hackberrydraw you can hand it off without the poles to an ECS member - someone leading the march is a good bet - and they can put it on the PVC poles kept in the section for just such occasions :)"

SoundersFC,33r10r,snsdop,6,Fri Apr 24 20:21:08 2015 UTC,"You're only 18, so ignore everything that all these people are saying about bars and beer. Traffic and parking are going to be NUTS with the Mariners game at 1:10 and the Sounders at 6:30 - absolutely either take the train or bus.  Your food options are a little limited in that area being under 21, but there are some great hot dog stands/taco trucks on the west side of the stadium by the pro shop that are significantly cheaper and better than anything inside.  Get there about an hour early to just enjoy the crowd atmosphere, and either take part in or watch the March to the Match from Occidental Square to the stadium."
SoundersFC,33r10r,CougFanDan,4,Sat Apr 25 01:38:06 2015 UTC,"I like to get down there at least 45 minutes early. Time for a quick bite and then Into the stadium without too much of a wait in the security lines. There is tons of food and bar options nearby so just go for a stroll and see what catches your eye. I'd avoid parking in the lots that are within a block or two of the stadium unless you want to pay out the ass. There's plenty of other lots within walking distance for a much more reasonable price. I prefer driving as the last thing I want to do is wait for a packed bus home, but if you plan on drinking more then a few the bus is the way to go. Now that I think about it getting down there even an hour early wouldnt hurt. Big game, big crowd."
SoundersFC,33r10r,JustinCasy,3,Fri Apr 24 20:32:23 2015 UTC,I'd say get down there even earlier. The M's game will be letting out a bit before the match so it's going to be hectic to find a seat at a bar or restaurant.
SoundersFC,33r10r,thegraduate,3,Fri Apr 24 20:36:14 2015 UTC,"Drive down early park in the garage at 1st and Columbia. There's plenty of food options in the club level, might as well take advantage. Or grab something outside the stadium if you want to save some cash.   Listen to  the Sounders FC Weekly podcast before hand so you can know what's up this week.   Watch the ECS march to the match. If you have Sounders gear and want to be in the middle of a bunch of crazy supporters singing and swearing you could join right in the match too. Otherwise hang out on the street in front of the stadium and watch. Google to find the details."

SoundersFC,33r10r,banemaler,2,Sat Apr 25 21:51:23 2015 UTC,"The E-Line bus route is a good option for transportation.  It goes between Pioneer Square and Aurora Village up in Shoreline (the shopping area next to CostCo). The last stop will drop you off a few blocks from the stadium and there's usually a bus running every 15-20 minutes.  The only downside is on the way home you may not get a seat, so you'll be standing until the bus gets up to around the Greenlake area.  You'll probably want to participate in the March To The Match! An hour before kickoff a big group of fans march the few blocks from Occidental park down to the stadium. lots of fun.  You're only 18, which unfortunately means you won't get into any of the bars I usually recommend going to before the match.  Maybe someone else can recommend some good restaurants that aren't 21+"
SoundersFC,33r10r,elpool2,2,Fri Apr 24 22:05:27 2015 UTC,"The E-Line is a really slow way of getting from Lynnwood. Try to drive to Lynnwood Park & Ride or Mountlake Terrace Park & Ride and catch Route 512, which runs every 30 minutes on Sundays."

Depending on what you like to drink or do, there is lots of stuff around the stadium to drink and eat. Even inside the stadium foods good and they have awesome choices for beer. Pricey, but it's a stadium so it's expected. I also recommend that burger truck the people's burger. So damn good"

SoundersFC,33r10r,samfreez,1 point,Fri Apr 24 23:37:20 2015 UTC,"Take the bus or the sounder if it's running. Parking is ass on a good day and with Portland in town AND the mariners playing it'll be worse.   As far as what to do: I like to do the march to the match. It leaves one hour before game time from occidental park, which is only a few blocks north of the stadium, and its pretty fun. If you do go there you can eat at Pizza Pros, they're usually busy but good. Also swannies (which is a texmex place at occidental) usually has an all ages section, so you could eat there if you like texmex."
SoundersFC,33r10r,lightjedi5,1 point,Sat Apr 25 01:54:06 2015 UTC,"With the mariners game getting out about the same time as the Sounders game starting, traffic could be a nightmare.  I recommend taking the Sounder train.  Also,  You CAN take food into the stadium.  This means if you get a hotdog or burger or something at one of the food carts outside you don't need to eat it out there.  You can take it in with you.  Except bottled water, you CAN NOT take drinks in."
SoundersFC,33r10r,planetes,1 point,Sat Apr 25 20:23:08 2015 UTC,"Check out our FAQ on the sidebar  Bussing from nothgate on the 41 is pretty easy, I'd recommend that if you don't want to worry about parking downtown.  There's a pre-game party at Fuel if you're interested in joining the ECS and other passionate fans. Be warned it'll be loud and crowded, but it'll lead into the March to the Match at 5:30. Walking with the march should get you into the stadium about 30min before kickoff."

It's mostly them yelling woah oh oh to a tune and ends Come on(?) Rose City.   ECS spun it into their own version of Fuck off Rose City when ever we play them.
SoundersFC,33ob2c,redundantdevil,2,Fri Apr 24 04:43:29 2015 UTC,"If I'm not mistaken, it's ""...something something...

SoundersFC,33mdo9,lightjedi5,2,Fri Apr 24 05:32:41 2015 UTC,"I get the suspension on Sarvas (he basically threw Dempsey on the ground and then stomped on him), but it looks like Marshall got a foot on the ball before a bad deflection off the ball carried his foot into the shin of Sanchez. It wasn't a tackle from behind either, so what about it merited the same punishment as a red card?"
SoundersFC,33mdo9,Arzul,7,Thu Apr 23 20:11:55 2015 UTC,"Leg raised, studs up? Should have been a straight red. Very dangerous. Uncharacteristically reckless from Marshall."
SoundersFC,33mdo9,Soundurr,3,Fri Apr 24 16:18:20 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. Looked to me like his foot comes down on the ball and bounces up, but it is still pretty high.  Here's hoping Evans has been taking good notes!"
SoundersFC,33mdo9,Arzul,8,Fri Apr 24 16:42:47 2015 UTC,It should have been a red. He came in too high and nearly snapped a leg.
SoundersFC,33mdo9,nikdahl,2,Fri Apr 24 06:10:40 2015 UTC,"I think ""snapped"" is a but harsh. I think a yellow card was justified as a consecutive yellow in the next match would lead to a one game suspension.   Mainly I would point to his lack of 'harmful intent'.

Best to call the bars on Friday and ask if they will play the game, and - better yet - who (if any) will play it with sound on.  Good luck!

SoundersFC,33iar6,thegodsarepleased,23,Wed Apr 22 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"So my friend talked to Jordan's dad a couple nights ago. Apparently, if you attend Stanford for less than 2 years, it is extremely difficult for you to come back to complete your degree (which is what many professionals leaving to join the big leagues end up doing). The only reason Jordan has  been waiting to complete the move was because of that fact, and now that he'll be completing a second year by May, we can almost certainly expect to see him this Summer. His dad didn't explicitly say so, but you'd expect something like this to happen, given the ""demand"" to see Morris as a professional player."
SoundersFC,33iar6,vershastri,11,Wed Apr 22 21:54:36 2015 UTC,You're goddamn right. We want him.
SoundersFC,33iar6,benfreilich,6,Wed Apr 22 20:52:03 2015 UTC,"I'm watching him play in the U23 game against Mexico right now and he's tearing shit up. Really hope he does end up going to Seattle, he seems to suit the Sounders style very well."
SoundersFC,33iar6,JohnnySnowstorm,5,Thu Apr 23 04:58:22 2015 UTC,"This is a familiar question now-a-days, but whose spot is he taking?"
SoundersFC,33iar6,atheocrat,7,Thu Apr 23 03:24:15 2015 UTC,Cooper. We would probably be saving money compared to what we payed Cooper while getting far more potential (I only say potential since he has never played a professional minute of soccer I believe he is already at Cooper's level). We could shift Dempsey back into midfield the where he was when he first arrived here behind EJ and Martins with Morris up top with Oba. I'm not sure how comfortable he is on the wing but with his pace he could provide another option to the Neagle/Pappa/Kovar/Roldan/Mansaray/Jones/Barrett array of wingers/forwards.   Or he could be an option off of the bench to bring on if we need a goal after Neagle has tired the defense allowing Morris to run wild.  Or he just acts as a depth option and starts while Dempsey is with the national team.
SoundersFC,33iar6,buttstuff2k15,4,Thu Apr 23 06:15:46 2015 UTC,"I would imagine Neagle, but who knows."
SoundersFC,33iar6,Syuk_Dat_Deke,2,Thu Apr 23 03:30:50 2015 UTC,"Eh, if you said this about any others of the big sports I'd be like ""obviously you take that and you could finish college later with your own money"", but I mean how much are they really talking here? Even if its a max salary if I was him I'd really have to think about it. He has the potential to be really special though."

I suspect since there are a lot of kids in that area so the crew might be a bit sensitive. This was during the Houston game, yeah?   Edit: I found online where it says what to do (in the fan conduct section). It says the class is for those ""who have been ejected for violations of a more serious nature such as violence, sexism, racism, or actions that result in criminal charges."" That doesn't seem to apply to you, does it? That would be very absurd if you actually have to take the class for swearing. Should they eject the ECS too?    Warning Letter Individuals who violate the Fan Code of Conduct and/or are ejected from the stadium during a match, will receive an official notification of the offense in the mail from Sounders FC Management.  Violations that could generate a Warning Letter are as follows, but not limited to: use of any tobacco products on CenturyLink Field property, foul or abusive language or obscene gestures, intoxication or other signs of impairment related to alcohol consumption, failure to follow stadium staff directions, and any other conduct that is beyond the bounds of reasonable behavior for guests attending a professional sporting event.  Fan Code of Conduct Class CenturyLink Field and Sounders FC Management reserve the right to mandate individuals, who have been ejected for violations of a more serious nature such as violence, sexism, racism, or actions that result in criminal charges, to complete the online Fan Code of Conduct class.  This online course costs $250 and will go over in detail the aspects of the Fan Code of Conduct that all fans are expected to adhere to while attending a Sounders FC match.  Until the course is completed, the individual will not be allowed to attend any Sounders FC matches at CenturyLink Field.  If the person is found at CenturyLink Field during a Sounders FC match without successfully completing the mandated online course, the person will be immediately ejected from the property and/or possibly cited for Trespassing. Upon completion of the course, the individual will be sent a letter from Sounders FC Management acknowledging the course completion and notification of acceptance back to Sounders FC matches."

Scheduling in the MLS is EXTREMELY complex, as you need to balance home/away, conference opponents, different competitions (US Open Cup, CCL, etc.), and a million other factors. For instance, Montreal has only played 4 matches due to their CONCACAF Champions League participation.  For maybe the best example of how complicated the scheduling can get, Toronto FC hasn't played a single match at home yet this season."

SoundersFC,335u2y,SonOfMechaMummy,4,Sun Apr 19 20:52:47 2015 UTC,"It's great that Neagle got a brace, but for my money MotM goes to Frei. I cannot say enough good things about his play that last game.  In the first half, he stuffed a couple breakaways (and conceded one goal on a breakaway), stopped some very difficult shots, and almost single-handedly held us in the game to force Colorado to keep committing tremendous numbers forward - which created openings on the counter that Neagle was able to exploit.  And in the second half, you could see in Colorado's shooting that they were rattled. The way he'd played in the first half made their players think they had to hit a perfect shot to get past him... as a result, most of their shots sailed wildly off-target. Frei was also a great pace-setter; every time he got the ball that half, he took the air out of the game, slowed things down, and let us reset... then found an open teammate rather than booting it away and letting Colorado put us back under pressure.  Look at the shots chart from the game. Our goal is a damn pincushion. Frei is the one who made a win possible."
SoundersFC,335u2y,stealth_sloth,3,Mon Apr 20 07:47:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah but how many of those are on target. Frei was awesome yes, but shots off target can hardly be attributed to him, the cause of those lies with the defenders.   Yeah they had 27 shots, but only 9 were on target."
SoundersFC,335u2y,cantbeassed,2,Mon Apr 20 09:25:07 2015 UTC,"I'd make two points.  First, ""only 9"" on target is a lot. Prior to this game, the Sounders had allowed 12 shots on target all season. If you look at this weekend, only three goalkeepers faced 9 shots on target. Ricketts (who let in 3), Irwin (who let in 3), and Frei (nobody faced 10+). And while most of the shots Frei faced last game were fairly routine ones, there were a few nasty ones mixed in there.  Second, I do attribute some of the off-target shooting to Frei. When a keeper starts the game by making a half-dozen good saves and only allowing one goal from a nearly impossible to save shot... that rattles the opposition.  That's exactly what we saw out of Colorado. In the second half, they were blasting the ball, trying to rifle it into the upper V at a hundred miles an hour. And, consequently, missing entirely. It's a mark of respect for Frei that they weren't confident to just hit those low and on-target and see what came of them."
SoundersFC,335u2y,stealth_sloth,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:46:12 2015 UTC,"meh, agree to disagree."
SoundersFC,335u2y,cantbeassed,7,Mon Apr 20 13:48:41 2015 UTC,"Neagle scored another trademark lucky goal from distance into the upper 90, then made another poor decision and found himself in place to score his second.  amazing since he's very poor in the midfield.  One of only two players that really seemed to show up in the first half."
SoundersFC,335u2y,ravegreener,12,Sun Apr 19 22:00:53 2015 UTC,Another trademark lucky goal? So consistently lucky he can trademark it?
SoundersFC,335u2y,thegraduate,7,Mon Apr 20 02:08:30 2015 UTC,"/s there are some in the Sounders fan community that think Neagle isn't a quality player, that all his goals are lucky, and no amount of statistical evidence to the contrary will change their minds.  I'm not one of those people."

SoundersFC,333bih,dintclempsey,12,Sun Apr 19 18:31:15 2015 UTC,We needed this away win. Very happy with it.   I don't care much for Neagle but hot damn did he step up. Then Oba was just Oba as usual. Hopefully Clint is feeling more 100% next game.
SoundersFC,333bih,Audicity,10,Sun Apr 19 03:03:44 2015 UTC,Sarvas should be suspended The ref should be re-designated to 4th official duty Our defense still has a lot to figure out Oba had a slick move but Rose delivered one of the best balls from distance we have seen this year. Can't believe the commentators didn't mention him once there.  Neagle reminded us why he was top 3 in goals last year
SoundersFC,333bih,clickmyface,9,Sun Apr 19 05:24:10 2015 UTC,Wasn't super impressed with the first half. Even with Neagle's 2 goals they looked a little lost defensively. Second half was much better.
SoundersFC,333bih,btener412,8,Sun Apr 19 03:05:14 2015 UTC,"Big props to Sigi's halftime adjustments on this one. Our marking was much better in the second half, our wingers were smarter about when to track back, and our spacing got a lot better.  With that said, the first half wasn't all doom and gloom. Small edge to Colorado, but they were throwing almost everybody way forward trying to score and it was giving us plenty of golden chances on the counter."

SoundersFC,333bih,SounderBruce,5,Sun Apr 19 03:03:45 2015 UTC,I was super happy to see that.  When he plays smart and plays with confidence he can be a great asset.  It is also great to know we have attacking options that work outside of Clint and Oba.
SoundersFC,333bih,banemaler,9,Sun Apr 19 03:06:53 2015 UTC,"Super impressed with his brace. The first was a crack shot, the second was never give up. Great answer to last game"
SoundersFC,333bih,Queefy_McCumbubble,5,Sun Apr 19 03:10:14 2015 UTC,I think someone will need to make a video at the end of the season of Oba's sick spin moves and set it to Dead or Alive's You Spin Me Round.  You know with slow mo back and forths and what not.    Today's goal was awesome!
SoundersFC,333bih,banemaler,3,Sun Apr 19 03:10:52 2015 UTC,"What an amazing turnaround from the first to second halves. Ref was absolute shit today. Probably the worst I've seen in a while. He missed a PK on Evans, a potential RC tackle from behind from Pittiniari. Then another YC professional foul on Pittiniari.  clear handball on Pittiniari. Sarvas clearing the ball into Dempsey's head, then the nut stomp.  Lamar and Frei were the two bright spots of the 1st half. The two of them not only kept the team in it, but got us a lead going into half.  I really wonder what Sigi's HT talk was like. I'm sure they all knew they were playing shitty, and I'm sure Sigi made it clear."
SoundersFC,333bih,ravegreener,5,Sun Apr 19 03:13:20 2015 UTC,"The Rapids commentators mentioned it was one of the rare times that a losing coach would tell his team keep it up and the winning coach would be telling the players to clean up their game.  I thought the Rapid's commentators were pretty decent.  Of course they support the rapids, but I thought they were one of the better sets of local commentators outside of Seattle."
SoundersFC,333bih,banemaler,3,Sun Apr 19 03:22:25 2015 UTC,I think their play by play guy is one of the best in MLS.

I hope he gets to double digits this year.  Glad to see that we moved him up top with our first sub instead of bringing in Barrett.  Also glad we sorted out the positioning issue that plagued us in the first half.  3 good points on the road."
SoundersFC,333bih,nimbledinosaur,3,Sun Apr 19 03:28:16 2015 UTC,Those shots on goal from Rapids the first half were...really uncomfortable to watch.
SoundersFC,333bih,Fifty_Stalins,3,Sun Apr 19 05:03:48 2015 UTC,"Remmick looked so good tonight, and I'm surprised it isn't getting more attention. The ball dropped in the box more than a few times after some ugly saves by Frei and Remmick was there to clear it almost every time.   Our midfield was super ugly tonight. Ozzie was off nearly all match, but our back line did pretty good. The Brad Evans experiment is steadily improving."
SoundersFC,333bih,Aurick,4,Sun Apr 19 05:33:21 2015 UTC,"I think he was good, but he had a terrible give away in our 1/3 and caused Chad to try and recover and he ended up with a yellow because of it. Still has a lot to learn but I love the pace/youth at LB."
SoundersFC,333bih,AtSignAlejandro,3,Sun Apr 19 09:20:10 2015 UTC,Remmick was out of position on the goal too
SoundersFC,333bih,vuduwastaken,2,Sun Apr 19 22:10:42 2015 UTC,"Rose did have a fantastic assist, but Oba's goal deserve's a much more spectacular adjective IMO."
SoundersFC,333bih,AtSignAlejandro,3,Sun Apr 19 03:19:51 2015 UTC,"Fantastic job by Oba, but a ball like that delivered 30 yards out is pretty stunning."

SSFC Rumors tends to be good at things like identifying trialists and figuring out where/who we're scouting.  Dave Clark, founder of Sounder at Heart who still frequently writes articles for the site. He tweets/retweets about MLS TV ratings and has good insights about potential homegrown signings like Jordan Morris.  Chris Henderson, Sounders technical director who does a lot of the scouting of potential future players. He often tweets photos from the stadium where he's scouting.  Nos Audietis is a podcast hosted by Jeremiah Oshan and Aaron Campeau of Sounder at Heart. Episodes come out weekly during the season and usually include an interview with a Sounders player.  Liviu Bird writes for Sports Illustrated and covers MLS but is based in Seattle. He tends to annoy some fans because he is often critical of the Sounders and is a bit of a Europhile.  Chris Coulter is a photographer who tweets some of his pictures from Sounders games and training pretty regularly.  Charles Lehman is a fan that tends to be good at finding transfer rumors involving the Sounders.  Frank MacDonald worked for the NASL Sounders and again for the MLS Sounders when they joined the league and is a great resource for Sounders and local soccer history.  Colin Lamont is another fan who is good at tracking down transfer rumors.  Sounder at Heart typically puts out 4-5 Sounders-related articles per day.  Jeremiah Oshan is the Sounders beat reporter and editor for Sounder at Heart and is SB Nation's soccer managing editor, in addition to hosting Nos Audietis.  Erin Riley hosts a fan podcast about the Sounders, called Sonar Feed.  goalWA.net covers the Sounders, but tends to focus more on local teams playing in the lower levels of competitive soccer.  Prost Amerika used to focus more on the Sounders, but covers the MLS more broadly now.  Likkit does GIFs, memes, and hype videos for Sounder at Heart."
SoundersFC,333ese,randymeeker,3,Sun Apr 19 05:17:31 2015 UTC,"If you want to go all out, I'd follow some of these accounts. But Dave & Jeremiah echo each other, as well as the SaH and Nos Audietis account. They're all pretty much the same voice minus Dave & Jeremiah being two different people.   I get why you would promote all of them though since you write for SaH. I'm just not a fan of 95% of the stuff they put out. It pollutes the opinion of the community. A lot of it is drivel. You can get all the important Sounders news from Pentz or Ruiz. SaH is more color commentary to the actual commentary."
SoundersFC,333ese,thegraduate,3,Sun Apr 19 15:36:46 2015 UTC,That's why I said to follow the two you listed and nobody else. Dave is an extremely negative person on twitter and he and the rest of SaH just echo what the beat reporters say.

Sometimes it's Ruiz or Oshan that gets an exclusive.  As far as Dave is concerned, I don't find him any more negative than you, for example. In fact, I think there are a lot of similarities between the way each of you engages with people with opposing opinions online. I also don't think there's anything wrong with that. I don't have a problem with either of you, because you both use evidence to back up your opinions.  For what it's worth, I occasionally write for Sounder at Heart, not because I always get along with Dave or any of the other writers/editors. I write there because they like the quality of my writing and research, and the fact that I often represent a perspective that is different from that of the other contributors. In fact, I often got into pretty heated debates with Dave not long before I started contributing to the site and that still happens from time to time. I can think of several people who often have strong disagreements with Dave that occasionally write for the site.  If you want to avoid Sounder at Heart, there are still 10 Twitter accounts in that list that aren't associated with the site. I purposely included people/sites that represent different perspectives. I just happen to follow more people from that particular community because that's where most of my conversations about the Sounders have taken place for the past half decade or so."

SoundersFC,32kujs,KDFilm,1 point,Wed Apr 15 16:40:11 2015 UTC,Pro tip on getting some Rainiers into the M's game = wrap 3 or 4 in jimmy johns or subway sandwich wrapping paper along with some paper towels to make them no so round looking. Stuff in one of those bag coolers and try to take them in.   I haven't tried this but I heard some people mention it once and I just may try it this season.

Realistically even if they catch it and make you toss it 4 out of 5 times you'd probably still wind up ahead since 6 packs of tall boys are what, $5.50?

Sounders games tend to be very energetic, especially when you walk to the stadium from Pioneer Square. It's really nice to just sit and watch a baseball game after the excitement of a soccer game. We did quite a bit of walking in Downtown Seattle in between the games, so relaxing at the M's game was nice. That and they hit about 4 HR's to our section.  Highly suggest."

SoundersFC,32eb0w,clickmyface,7,Mon Apr 13 03:05:36 2015 UTC,"I thought Ozzie did great, mostly I'm just happy to see him back.  Neagle had some great moments, but clearly got frustrated which turned sloppy."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,The_Sultan_of_Swing,15,Mon Apr 13 04:28:56 2015 UTC,"Neagle worked his ass off, and was really unlucky not to get at least one goal."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,ravegreener,8,Mon Apr 13 04:29:06 2015 UTC,He worked hard but I don't think it was just bad luck. Every shot he took was right to penedo. Edit: spelling is hard.
SoundersFC,32eb0w,CosmoThor,5,Mon Apr 13 07:34:05 2015 UTC,You have to respect Penedo's positioning more than anything.
SoundersFC,32eb0w,canucknuckles,5,Mon Apr 13 14:37:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you're right he read each ball beautifully. But equally it was Neagle's job to mix it up. It looked like every ball was grounded right to Penedo or was right down the center."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,CosmoThor,1 point,Mon Apr 13 15:15:29 2015 UTC,"Agreed, Neagle is pretty predictable so the actual shots on goal were a little easier on Penedo. But damn,  those header saves..."

SoundersFC,32eb0w,CosmoThor,5,Mon Apr 13 20:00:43 2015 UTC,"Yeah, when a goalie is on point most shots looks like they are ""right at them."""
SoundersFC,32eb0w,pinkal_peaches,3,Mon Apr 13 19:01:55 2015 UTC,"It's the most overlooked skill a keeper has, IMO. Frei, for example, had terrible positioning at the beginning of last season. It cost us some games and everyone was upset. He got better (probably just more comfortable) and it really showed at the end of the season and so far this season."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,canucknuckles,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:08:34 2015 UTC,Besides the beautiful header in the beginning!

SoundersFC,32eb0w,CosmoThor,0,Mon Apr 13 20:01:14 2015 UTC,"But to summarize. Neagles positioning:100, his finishing: nil."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,Area29,3,Mon Apr 13 20:20:07 2015 UTC,"Roldan  While, yes, he made some rookie mistakes, overall he was a gem out there."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,BanksKnowsBest,2,Mon Apr 13 20:41:42 2015 UTC,"I only saw the highlights of the match, which really means I just saw a Penedo highlight real. I ain't even mad. That was some outstanding goalkeeping."
SoundersFC,32eb0w,insultant_,1 point,Mon Apr 13 16:05:01 2015 UTC,"Penedo was a man possessed out there. Sure some of the shots went directly to him, but he did a hell of a job keeping a clean sheet. I really dread playing the Galaxy because it seems like no matter what, we always come up short. Except of course that late Supporters Shield run."
SoundersFC,32e41m,MowwMoww,17,Mon Apr 13 01:10:36 2015 UTC,"Poor finishing, we made their keeper look great.   Poor clearances.  I liked what I saw from Roldan, thought he had a great game."
SoundersFC,32e41m,Nekokeki,12,Mon Apr 13 01:12:41 2015 UTC,"Penedo did have some great saves, but we did have too many shots right at him for him to just grab.  Agreed on Roldan, he's looking really good."

SoundersFC,32e41m,btener412,16,Mon Apr 13 03:39:25 2015 UTC,"This is just the way soccer goes. Today was a day they deserved 3 points and got none. There will be games when they deserve none but get 3. Still really damn annoying but on the bright side Roldan looked great, and they played well without Dempsey, especially Neagle."
SoundersFC,32e41m,P9J0S6,24,Mon Apr 13 01:15:36 2015 UTC,"I fucking hate the galaxy, that's all I have to say. For some of our other rivals, I at least respect their fans or their play. Not LA. Shit fans, shit club."
SoundersFC,32e41m,Dayvido,2,Mon Apr 13 01:46:53 2015 UTC,I feel the LAvSEA rivalry really took its own form over the years(the way a real rivalry should be made) I look forward to the games against Portland but I feel LA is our biggest rival IMO.
SoundersFC,32e41m,samfreez,7,Mon Apr 13 06:45:44 2015 UTC,"At this point, it feels like the Timbers rivalry is more about continuing to poop on their parade because it's fun.  With LA, it's a bona fide hatred in the best way possible, and definitely more of an exciting edge-of-your-seat kind of rivalry, since the two teams are MUCH more comparable skill-wise."
SoundersFC,32e41m,EbonPinion,3,Mon Apr 13 16:53:08 2015 UTC,"It's a lot like how I feel about rivals with Liverpool: Fuck Everton, but FUCK MAN U SO MUCH MORE."
SoundersFC,32e41m,Contagion21,2,Mon Apr 13 18:23:45 2015 UTC,"I tend to think the opposite. If LA sucks next year and are easy points, will it still have the rivalry feel? I don't care how Portland is doing, I want to embarrass them every time we play.   LA is an extremely strong divisional opponent, and has been the last several seasons... But to me it still doesn't feel like a rivalry. Ditto Hawks and Niners."
SoundersFC,32e41m,PappyPoobah,2,Tue Apr 14 03:49:45 2015 UTC,It definitely would be because we will enjoy bathing in their tears and grinding salted sandpaper into their wounds. They wouldn't be down for long so we have to relish the victories when we get them.

SoundersFC,32e41m,hhdslater,12,Mon Apr 13 04:32:30 2015 UTC,"My thoughts are thus:   Still early in the season, we dominated, no Dempsey or Pineda, only lost 1-0. Not overly worried. Their keeper got all the credit for our poor finishing. Brad Evans is generally looking better (not so much tonight), but is clearly growing as a CB. Overall I'm optimistic for that experiment. Glad we gave our younger guys (especially Remick) a lot of playing time - getting sick of having a bunch of dinosaurs playing defense for us. We need youth desperately. Alexi Lalas is borderline retarded."
SoundersFC,32e41m,thegraduate,6,Mon Apr 13 01:18:53 2015 UTC,You think Lalas is borderline retarded but a lot of the comments in here are just regurgitating what he said during the match.
SoundersFC,32e41m,hhdslater,9,Mon Apr 13 01:50:29 2015 UTC,"At least no one's saying anything like, ""One would think Seattle would want to take more advantage of LA being in poor form,"" which is exactly the same as saying, ""One would think they would want to win, so why are they not winning?"""
SoundersFC,32e41m,Looorney,2,Mon Apr 13 02:02:16 2015 UTC,Borderline retarded Alexi Lalas is the best kind of Alexi Lalas.

NOW.   very frustrated."
SoundersFC,32e41m,Syuk_Dat_Deke,4,Mon Apr 13 01:40:39 2015 UTC,"There is a quote from sigi that I remember every time someone says something about it being early season. It goes: ""3 points in March are worth the same as 3 points in October."""

Like yeah its early in the season but the wins are still wins, they're not like half wins. Same with soccer, yeah its a long season (which is awesome since I didn't have fuck all to watch during the summer before soccer) but 3 points now is still 3 fucking points."
SoundersFC,32e41m,banemaler,6,Mon Apr 13 22:05:09 2015 UTC,Well that was frustrating as hell to watch. It's early in the season so I won't panic because I honestly thought we were pretty good minus a defensive lapse and our inability to finish. That said we need to fucking finish. We really should have had at least a point today.
SoundersFC,32e41m,clickmyface,7,Mon Apr 13 01:14:15 2015 UTC,"We were about 6 inches from being up 5-1.  Even though we looked sloppy in the midfield, I thought we looked solid at the back.  We might give it right back to LA, but none of their attackers went unmarked.  Our chances always seemed better until we kicked the ball right to Penedo.  Oh well...better luck next week.  I was switching back and forth between the sounders and the Reign.  (NWSL streams all their games on YouTube)  When the boys were busy disappointing me with their finishing, I watched Megan Rapinoe grab a hat trick as the Reign went 5-1 over the Western New York Flash.  Pretty solid performance."

SoundersFC,32e41m,cantbeassed,2,Mon Apr 13 03:40:21 2015 UTC,"Before someone says we should've won, we shouldn't.  If you don't finish the chances you are given (and we were given A LOT), then you were simply not the better team.  Many people will disagree with this statement, as luck can heavily factor into a game, but today's game was not an example of that."
SoundersFC,32e41m,clickmyface,2,Mon Apr 13 04:28:59 2015 UTC,"We were, overall, the better team. We don't deserve to win if we can't finish, but that doesn't mean we didn't play better than them on the whole."

SoundersFC,32e41m,tehjimmeh,2,Mon Apr 13 01:13:48 2015 UTC,Being offside happens all the time.  You have just to get lucky and step back and break with the ball.  All the best forwards do that too.
SoundersFC,32e41m,lightjedi5,1 point,Mon Apr 13 03:43:08 2015 UTC,"When I wrote that I think I meant ""Oba, stop getting flagged for offside."" Happened too many times yesterday. We had 2 offside calls going into this match and added 5 more. Unacceptable. Oba had 4 of them."

SoundersFC,32e41m,CosmoThor,10,Mon Apr 13 01:12:46 2015 UTC,It's rather easy to save shots that are straight at you.

What I liked: A lot of good chances created. Neagle got himself in some good spots but had some really bad finishing. What I didn't like: The passing seemed sloppy most of the game. Marshall and Evans had a poor piece of communication leading to that goal.  Roldan did well, Rose did well, Remick did all right. Just feel like something didn't quite click."
SoundersFC,32e41m,Looorney,3,Mon Apr 13 01:25:55 2015 UTC,The goal scored looked more squarely on rose than anyone. He was marking Gordon.

After a while he started pulling defenders off Oba and even then Oba still had no shots, let alone shots on target.  Also, we had no shots on target after Neagle was subbed off."
SoundersFC,32e41m,vershastri,5,Mon Apr 13 01:14:32 2015 UTC,"Instead of downvoting you Moww, I'll ask what you thought was his problem today. He looked more dangerous than Martins for most parts of the game, and created several chances. It was one of those days where the GK came up huge."
SoundersFC,32e41m,clickmyface,5,Mon Apr 13 01:13:44 2015 UTC,"He is paid to score goals, not shoot 6 shots directly at the keeper. His header was a good effort and a great save by Penedo, but the rest of the match he took weak shots directly at Penedo and or put in garbage crosses. It's a step up for him because now he is actually getting shots on goal, but to not score with 6 total shots and FIVE SHOTS ON GOAL is fucking ridiculous."
SoundersFC,32e41m,vershastri,2,Mon Apr 13 01:15:34 2015 UTC,I agree with you. It reminded me of the shots you see in pre-game practice against the keeper.
SoundersFC,32e41m,vershastri,1 point,Mon Apr 13 01:17:57 2015 UTC,"THIS. I'm glad you mentioned this. The general opinion of Neagle is very skewed, as he is a local product after all. Slowly people are beginning to see the disparity between him and the rest of the players on our team. There will be a point at which we will have to offload him since he just will not be able contribute due to his lack of talent and capability, and that time is approaching soon.   As you can see I've disliked him for a while, and before someone shoves stats in my face, I'm not going to change my opinion. Moreover, I'll wait for people to realize how bad of a player he is, as well the laughing stock that is Barrett."
SoundersFC,32coz6,tennisgoalie,10,Sun Apr 12 18:00:50 2015 UTC,He's a good man that Neagle.

SoundersFC,32e5jo,smokey815,4,Mon Apr 13 01:24:13 2015 UTC,"Its funny how rating Lamar Neagle can yield such a wide range of opinions.    Chances created with nothing to show for it. Is that good or bad? I prefer to see it as good. As long as he keeps making chances, odds are he'll score a few."
SoundersFC,32e5jo,adillen,0,Mon Apr 13 02:45:18 2015 UTC,"Thats my logic with his play this game, he had 5 shots on goal, 2 of them I could see being goals, the other were poor shotshe also had a couple good through balls to Oba and a cross to Rose that were decent good chances.   I rated Rose down for losing Gordon completely on marking but otherwise he was fine  Pappa was the most frustrating player this match to often he got the ball and played too much with it rather than passing. Oba likewise was poor with only one bad SOG and held the ball too much rather than taking a shot or pass."
SoundersFC,32e5jo,Jack2142,0,Mon Apr 13 05:11:11 2015 UTC,I totally agree.  Outside of our opener our offense has been weak overall frankly.   He generated the most offensive fire we've seen so far this season IMO.  I am bummed about yesterday's result but we constantly have bad luck against Galaxy for some reason so I am holding back criticism at this point in the season.
SoundersFC,32eubf,asotint,2,Mon Apr 13 05:26:56 2015 UTC,I think it's more likely that Cuba would call him up before the USA does/can.

SoundersFC,32eubf,DabCity360,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:26:57 2015 UTC,AFAIK it was FIFA's decision to not let him play. I could be wrong but I don't believe those particular politics played into it.

SoundersFC,328mgj,LevinsBend,10,Sat Apr 11 15:49:01 2015 UTC,Did he show well?
SoundersFC,328mgj,Howard_the_Dolphin,13,Sat Apr 11 16:05:28 2015 UTC,"He gave up 1 corner, had two throws that lead to a change of possession, nearly gave up a goal after he failed to track back, but had a great ball to harry kane, and one good cross, he is very much the Yedlin we all remember."
SoundersFC,328mgj,babydipergravy,20,Sat Apr 11 16:55:40 2015 UTC,"""Failed to track back"" is a little misleading. He was obviously given instructions to get forward early and often pushing for the equalizer - he was playing more as a winger or aggressive wingback than a traditional fullback.  One of his teammates played a boneheaded pass across the middle that was easily intercepted, leaving Yedlin upfield of the counter. It's not that he failed to track back, it's that he had to run a long ways to get back because in that situation it wasn't his job to stay home in case his teammate made a dumb pass. And he did get back. He made one of those glorious Yedlin sprints we all saw in the past and managed to recover goalside before the shot could be taken... at which point he promptly got dusted 1v1, almost gave up a penalty, and left his man open inside the 18 with the ball."
SoundersFC,328mgj,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sat Apr 11 17:41:08 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  The only problem on that play was losing his footing, but he really wasn't at fault."
SoundersFC,328mgj,lojer,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:02:04 2015 UTC,"His first throw in wasn't his fault, it was actually a very well thrown ball right to his teammmate but said teammate's poor first touch led to the turnover."
SoundersFC,328mgj,doge211,3,Sat Apr 11 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"Mostly quiet. Not badly out of his depth, not ready to set the league on fire. One bad defensive mistake, one excellent pass. Tottenham as a whole was rather dysfunctional towards the end of the match, so it's tough to judge Yedlin specifically."
SoundersFC,328mgj,stealth_sloth,2,Sat Apr 11 16:26:37 2015 UTC,"He was subtlety sound, nothing incredible but did his job. Had a really nice pass through two Villa players. Looked strong out there."

SoundersFC,3226zv,cantbeassed,1 point,Fri Apr 10 09:54:30 2015 UTC,"I dunno about this one.  I don't think Portland is near as good as you think.  And I don't think Orlando is bad at all.  They move the ball well and defend well, I wouldn't be suprised if they come away from Portland with at least a point.  For Seattle, you put too much into shooting.  Seattle goes for broke on quick attacks then gets back to defend.  It may not look impressive but it's working more often than not.  and vs LA, there have some big wins and big losses by a high number of goals.  So I'm not sure if you have your history right or if you're understanding LA's quality this season.  For Vancouver.  They've been ending games well but that usually doesn't last.  They're playing well but the Columbus tie shouldn't have been a shock.  And I expect San Jose will give them plenty of trouble on the weekend.  Oh and I believe the reason Borchers so wide open on that header was due to a teamate pulling the jersey of his defender.  The highlight isn't definitive but it looked like a jersey pull to me."

There great fun, meal, snacks, drinks, nice seats, less cramped. However, the view down there isn't amazing unless the players are near you. If you want to actually watch the game, stay in normal seats, it'll be cheaper and you can actually watch the game."

SoundersFC,31robd,IncogNeato1980,1 point,Tue Apr 7 19:14:52 2015 UTC,I talked to the Sounders last year about it and it depends on the game and the package you want.  If you want the normal experience it was $1200 to $1400.  For the vip experience it's $1800 to $2000.  This was at the end of the year and for the playoffs I could get tickets at the higher price for any of the games.

SoundersFC,31ixx7,never-enough-hops,3,Sun Apr 5 19:44:59 2015 UTC,"Had club level season tickets, and there was a game or two where even the club level stood the whole game. Saw USOC #3 from the Hawk's Nest... standing there is dangerous."

SoundersFC,31j4ve,wellgoshgollygeez,7,Sun Apr 5 16:25:14 2015 UTC,"Sorry to hear about the incident. Not a very productive way to encourage people to get involved with the collective chants and singing.   At every match I can see some of the most senior ECS members standing around, chatting with their friends, not being very involved as far as the singing goes. I know these members are instrumental to how ECS is run and we wouldn't be the support group we are today if it wasn't for their efforts, but I don't think it's fair for ECS to call out other fans while a good number of ECS isn't ""giving their full 90""."
SoundersFC,31j4ve,Ironthumb,12,Sun Apr 5 20:02:40 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to reply.  Yes I think the ECS is vital to the energy of the SoundersFC and I support what they do. No problems. Without them watching the game would be a much more boring experience and I like to go sing and dance etc...  What I do not support and what I see is the main problem is singling people out who may not be as into the whole shebang as some of the more enthusiastic fans are. It's one thing to try to inspire fever (and that's ok, please do!) But it's a totally different thing to single out groups and individuals and act like a school yard bully as a way to do that. You turn people off to your message and look like a total clown to boot. Last night was just way too far out of line IMO."
SoundersFC,31j4ve,th12teen,5,Sun Apr 5 20:28:42 2015 UTC,"Anyone can buy an ECS membership, so things like this will always be a possibility. Just remember that no individual represents the intent of the group."
SoundersFC,31j4ve,nikdahl,3,Sun Apr 5 20:58:01 2015 UTC,"Honestly, next time talk to ECS security. I don't care who you are, or who is doing it to you, you don't deserve a bullhorn in the face."
SoundersFC,31j4ve,cwcoleman,2,Tue Apr 7 15:54:37 2015 UTC,There were a few of these incidents at the game on Saturday.     The lead capo even called out a few people in the first and second half from the main stand.      I'm curious if there was more of a problem yesterday than other games. I've heard the 'put your phone away' plenty of times but Saturday seemed to be worse. She said something about eating food too.         I do agree that people who aren't watching the match or participating in any way - should move. Although punishment by megaphone is overkill.       One thing I did notice was that our GA section was roomy. I stand in 122 just above the drums and we are normally packed in tight. 2 empty seats next to me this game. Plus the upper part of GA 123 was like a ghost town. Maybe it's the wristbands???          OP - what section were you in?
SoundersFC,31j4ve,judecomputer,5,Mon Apr 6 16:03:06 2015 UTC,"Calling people out is different than calling them pathetic, for sure. I have been discussing this w other members of ECS and sent OP a PM to get more details. We really really do not like this in the sections.   I stand in 122, too! When you say because of the wristbands, do you mean that you think it's less packed because of less people sneaking in? Could be a good thing, I feel bad accidentally stepping on people's feet and hitting them in the face with my scarf. But when we have to close huge gaps to be able to pogo I get a little sad."
SoundersFC,31j4ve,cwcoleman,2,Mon Apr 6 16:14:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm guessing less people because of the wristband enforcement. Which I agree is a good thing. I was just surprised to see so few people in GA for a relatively big match on a Saturday night. We'll be packed in 2 weeks for Portland I'm sure of it!"
SoundersFC,31j4ve,pal25,1 point,Mon Apr 6 16:22:10 2015 UTC,Suprising. I've only ever seen them single people out who are complaining (usually about flags or standing).
SoundersFC,31j4ve,pal25,-49,Mon Apr 6 05:56:03 2015 UTC,"Sorry you're feelings got hurt but as someone whose seats are near the away section I heard no such thing. I also love how you waited until the day after to post this, man you must really be bummed about losing :-/"
SoundersFC,31j4ve,pal25,24,Sun Apr 5 17:16:32 2015 UTC,I am a Sounder fan. And why does waiting until the next morning to post something even matter?
SoundersFC,31j4ve,ladyviks05,-46,Sun Apr 5 17:28:13 2015 UTC,And why does waiting until the next morning to post something even matter?   It must really have upset you if you spent the time to post about it on reddit.   Although this still doesn't make sense -- why would someone in ECS yell at Sounders fans?
SoundersFC,31jxky,WheezyTurtle,5,Sun Apr 5 20:31:29 2015 UTC,April 26th we will be playing the timbers at home. If you can make that your/her first match you won't regret it! Get the tickets ASAP however as that will most likely be a sell out game. The March to the match will also be bigger/louder then normal so I would do that as well. Other then that just try to pick up on some chants and songs (ECS hands out song cards so try and snag one of those) and you guys are going to have a blast! If you guys decide against the March to the match I suggest showing up at least a half hour early. Security lines get longer and longer the closer you show up to game time. I get incredibly anxious if I show up to late and have to wait in them while fearing I'll miss the kickoff.
SoundersFC,31jxky,JustinCasy,2,Sun Apr 5 21:48:17 2015 UTC,"oh nice, that sounds like a good one to grab then, thank you."
SoundersFC,31jxky,trickjarrett,2,Sun Apr 5 22:07:12 2015 UTC,"You'll have an awesome time. I recommend you guys get some tickets to the upper bowl for your first game. The lower bowl stands the entire time, and depending on how tall your younger sister is she might find it difficult to see the whole game.  Buying from the Sounders is fine as far as I'm concerned. SoundersFC.com and go to Tickets. There's processing fees, etc. You can always try Craigslist or just going to the stadium on game day.  There is a thing called the march to the match, which could be fun for you guys to really get into the spirit of Seattle soccer. Starting in Occidental park an hour before kick off hundreds of fans gather for a mini-ceremony / hype session, and then march together singing and chanting the few blocks to the stadium."
SoundersFC,31jxky,trickjarrett,1 point,Sun Apr 5 21:00:30 2015 UTC,"Thats fantastic to know about the standing only, shes still growing . . .we hope!  Will see if shes comfortable with the pre-march too, sounds awesome and thank you!"

SoundersFC,31jxky,nikdahl,2,Sun Apr 5 21:43:32 2015 UTC,There's a bunch of stuff to do downtown before the game if you wanna make a day out of it.   If I go with friends we hit up the science center or EMP or something just for fun then go.   Just a thought.
SoundersFC,31hmyt,MowwMoww,32,Sun Apr 5 04:03:11 2015 UTC,"Oba, you are amazing and I love you."

SoundersFC,31hmyt,banemaler,7,Sun Apr 5 04:05:47 2015 UTC,He looked a little off in the first half whole he was getting his feet under him. but he came out good as ever in the second.
SoundersFC,31hmyt,steveotheguide,17,Sun Apr 5 04:28:34 2015 UTC,"Ah, the good old 6-2-1 formation."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,stealth_sloth,4,Sun Apr 5 04:08:43 2015 UTC,It was actually 5-3-1 at the end. Leo was our LCM it looked like.
SoundersFC,31hmyt,trickjarrett,16,Sun Apr 5 05:28:24 2015 UTC,"It probably helps having Ozzie back, but Evans looked good at CB tonight."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,USA_A-OK,6,Sun Apr 5 04:08:48 2015 UTC,"He looked good last week too. Still hope we get someone else in so he can play wide instead of Neagle, but I think he'll probably work out in the long run."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,joylongdivision,3,Sun Apr 5 04:15:26 2015 UTC,"Even when Neagle is in form, moving Evans from the wide midfield role to the central defense role means our wide midfield depth took a hit. Maybe that will lead to more first team minutes for Kovar, though.   I still hope we wait until the summer to add players. I want to see how well everybody does over the long term, especially Evans at CB and some of the young guys. Lowe's performances with S2 and in the Xolos friendly have me less concerned about our CB depth. Mansaray and Jones make me less nervous about losing Cooper."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,randymeeker,12,Sun Apr 5 05:23:03 2015 UTC,"I was so impressed by the collective team defensive effort.  Last year we were great at scoring goals, but sucked at defending as a team.  This game was an excellent demonstration how this group of guys can overcome significant adversity and tough out 3 very hard fought points.  Also, thank god for obaflips!  That spin move was awesome and the finish clinical against one of the best keepers in the league.  Great game."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,banemaler,8,Sun Apr 5 04:08:44 2015 UTC,"Houston with only five shots all game from within the 18-yard box. None of which were open or even close to open. We constrained them to speculative headers, off-balance shots under pressure, and long-distance bombs.  That was a solid defensive performance, and it's the third solid defensive performance this year. Even our match against San Jose, we weren't that shaky defensively as a team; we just had one player make a number of horrible mistakes.  This bodes well for the year."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,stealth_sloth,8,Sun Apr 5 04:12:38 2015 UTC,"Dempsey got marked out of the match for the most part, and Rose being out wide I think kind of killed our ability to really use the space they left by doing that.  Pappa could have done better.  Going down a man when Houston would have had to push for a goal didn't help either, though.  I thought Ozzie looked good.  Nearly scored a great goal, and generally just did work.   Remick got caught out a couple times, though whether that was truly on him I can't say.  He did well when we sat back after going down I thought."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,smokey815,7,Sun Apr 5 04:06:37 2015 UTC,"Without the red card, Pappa probably would have subbed on in the second half. My guess is the staff didn't think he was well rested enough to start."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,USA_A-OK,3,Sun Apr 5 04:10:28 2015 UTC,"I agree. I remember seeing him up and talking to one of the coaches at one point before the red card. Afterwords, it changed the whole game, and it was more important to get those defensive players in."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,CosmoSounder,2,Sun Apr 5 04:35:07 2015 UTC,I was pretty sure Rose was coming out at about 70 they way he was running at the start of the 2nd half. Red card changed that. He had a pretty good talk with Sigi at the red card.
SoundersFC,31hmyt,steerbell,2,Sun Apr 5 05:05:44 2015 UTC,"I thought either Rose or Dempsey. Rose would have been the tactical choice, decent overall player but he doesn't have Pappa's bite on the attack. I could have also seen them taking Dempsey as a precautionary measure. Already up 1-0, let him rest to take care of the injury and let Pappa go out there and try and make some stuff happen."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,CosmoSounder,7,Sun Apr 5 15:30:44 2015 UTC,Ozzie looked good. MotM to Oba though. Beautiful goal. Solid all around.
SoundersFC,31hmyt,RADMFunsworth,5,Sun Apr 5 04:29:16 2015 UTC,"Oba was amazing, and that was GotW material, but there's no way he should get MotM over Frei tonight. He played absolutely lights out and stopped what could have been some devastating set pieces and shots."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,Aurick,4,Sun Apr 5 05:44:15 2015 UTC,"I always favor giving MotM to the guy who sacrificed his body the most. In this case, Frei is deserving for sure."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,warox13,3,Sun Apr 5 06:21:35 2015 UTC,"Houston brought almost nothing to challenge Frei. Don't get me wrong. Love him. And he played well but, no big saves and never really tested. Oba gets this for me."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,RADMFunsworth,5,Sun Apr 5 05:58:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're giving Frei's counter to Houston's set pieces enough credit. Sure, there werent a ton of shots on target, but the Dynamo had deadly placement on their corner kicks, and Frei fought his way to catch nearly all of them.  Houston is deadly in the air, and that's why Sigi put so many of our guys with the best aerial abilities in the game. Any of those corners could have been a goal if Frei hadn't had been there.  And that doesn't even count that initial ball stop he made in the first minutes of the game that led to a decent injury to his leg.   Frei was on point tonight, all night long."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,Aurick,3,Sun Apr 5 07:28:49 2015 UTC,"It's a very ""first world problem"" to have. Who had the better game: Frei or Oba. They were both rock solid. That goal though, in my opinion, is worth catching 20 corner kicks. That's just me though."

SoundersFC,31hmyt,tuttlebuttle,4,Sun Apr 5 06:53:37 2015 UTC,"I kind of wish TV broadcasts would have a professional referee that could actually explain what the rule says and what goes into a referee's decision-making process in the enforcement of the rule. We have former players as analysts to give us a player's perspective, and that's great, but I think a referee's perspective would add a lot.   Asking former players to judge a referee's performance is like asking former referees to judge a player's performance. If including a referee is too much to ask, then at least send the commentator to some basic referee training so they have a better understanding of the rules."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,randymeeker,2,Sun Apr 5 08:34:27 2015 UTC,The kicker was that they had the head of PRO in the house that night.

SoundersFC,31hmyt,btener412,2,Sun Apr 5 04:09:26 2015 UTC,"I think this match is an example of the coaching staff handling the game very well. I enjoyed seeing us go from our standard 4-4-2 diamond into the 5-2-2 after the red, and then into the 5-3-1 to park the bus for the extra time.  Ozzie looked to be about 80%, I'll be eager to see him finish regaining health and confidence.  Dempsey was double-covered almost the entire game.  Oba with the amazing goal.  I don't think I like Rose out wide, he didn't impress me out there.  The red was soft, but we got the exact same red against Dallas, so we can't be too upset about it.  Mini-rant: I had a guy in a seat behind me who was unexplicably misinformed in so many ways. He kept mis-identifying players, he kept giving the wrong explanations for things, and he kept crediting/blaming the wrong players in the game. It was mind boggling and honestly pretty tilting."

It was like we lit a firecracker off. She screamed so loud at both of us, her saliva went flying.   Tonight, the couple bebind us was screaming at the people two rows down for having a flag up.... 5 min before kickoff. Screaming to the point where, I again, got saliva in my hair... Wtf is wrong with people? They were claiming it was blocking their view, but there was literally nothing on the field.  The people behind us tried pulling out their seniority sth card, and the sth couple next to me said that they had their seats for the past 4 years. People behind us wanted nothing of it. More screaming like their child was being murdered in front of their eyes.   A flag.   Before kickoff.  Nothing on the field."

SoundersFC,31hmyt,my_lucid_nightmare,5,Sun Apr 5 14:58:57 2015 UTC,"Our standard 4-4-2 isn't a diamond, but I can see why it might look that way at times. In a diamond you have four central midfielders: a #6, two #8's, and a #10 who plays in the hole behind the forwards. While it can counter quickly, the real objective of the diamond midfield is to win the battle in the central midfield, which the Sounder's aren't terribly interested in doing (though this may be a result of Alonso's absence).  What we play is more like a 4-2-2-2 with a wrinkle or two. In a 4-2-2-2, the midfield is anchored by a #6 and a #8 playing behind two inverted wingers. Traditionally, the goal is to pull defenders out of position and create confusion in defensive rotations through overloading areas of the field; the forwards flair wide, the wingers cut in, the #8 makes an early run, and the fullbacks overlap.  Our primarily wrinkle is that we drop Martins into the midfield to start the play, and he uses his speed to catch back up, usually making the same run the #8 makes and continuing into his usual #9 role. Pineda doesn't make the #8's run often (nor does he make the third, or trailing, run), but when given space in the #10 hole (when Martins stays high), he plays the ball into overload situations so that the receiver is more likely to make their next pass.  A second wrinkle we often employ is to swap of the inverted wingers out with a #8, to support the central midfield and provide more space for the fullback to exploit. This can give the impression of a asymmetric diamond, but the rotations and philosophy remain more in line with the 4-2-2-2."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,metameh,2,Sun Apr 5 10:18:56 2015 UTC,"Great breakdown, you're 100% right. I think because I think of Ozzie as a CDM that makes me think of us using the diamond."

Even on his off days he's still above average, it only looks rough when you compare him to the rest of the sounders on the field."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,CosmoSounder,3,Sun Apr 5 04:36:50 2015 UTC,"Neagle wasn't bad last night. For example, he was instrumental in our goal - he's the one who forced the turnover, won the ball, and hit a quality no-look one-touch pass to Dempsey in space that let Dempsey find Martins 1v1 in the 18."
SoundersFC,31hmyt,stealth_sloth,2,Sun Apr 5 18:01:22 2015 UTC,"I really doubt it's a 3 year guaranteed contract. Like most MLS contracts, I'm pretty sure it's a 1 + 1 + 1 with club options for each year. Generally speaking, if a player isn't a DP or at least making close to $300k per year, his contract isn't guaranteed beyond the current season."

Second things second: was Pineda's high boot reckless? Probably. Was it with excessive force? No way. Seems like an unfortunate accident, definitely a yellow, but in my mind if you think that's a straight red you are guilty of serious piss-takage."

SoundersFC,31i74a,ravegreener,2,Sun Apr 5 16:38:43 2015 UTC,"didn't make any errors in defense.   I think (although I'm not sure) Evans was the one who slid in and got beat to the ball by Barnes around the 7th minute or so which forced Frei to make a sliding stop on a breakaway by Barnes where Barnes ended up stepping on Frei's ankle.  Other than that though (and I'm not even 100% sure that was him), yes. A solid defensive performance."

No way does he deserve MOTM. His headers still need a lot of work, and his overall positioning needs work. He finds himself ahead of the midfielders at times on defense and scurries back. I'm not saying he's terrible, but he still has a ton of room for improvement. Definitely not MOTM."

I'm actually somewhat surprised you think so many of them will be sitting out. We should see an Ozzie and Marshall start for sure, if not the full 90.   I think we could just as easily see Clint and Pappa too. Curious why you think Leo will be out, though he may need a break, and I could see Neagle sitting out at the start too, though who really knows with Sigi."
SoundersFC,31g36q,Aurick,2,Sat Apr 4 22:20:30 2015 UTC,"Great thread. I agree with your analysis, I'm thinking Roldan is the most likely starter but I wouldn't be surprised to see Martins and Barrett up top with Neagle at wing.  Thinking Ozzie as a 70th minute sub and maybe Dempsey at 80 or so.  In still wondering what we are going to do with all the cap space and allocation money we have saved up. I hear Zlatan is looking for a change... :)"
SoundersFC,31g36q,benhelioz,2,Sat Apr 4 21:02:49 2015 UTC,"With Ozzie starting, Clint and Oba up top, its time to be optimistic! Good call on Remick starting in place of Leo and Pappa not being in the XI."
SoundersFC,31b73j,Somebody_Call911,10,Fri Apr 3 14:13:36 2015 UTC,"We're set at goalkeeper. Frei, Perkins, Lyon. Mears is solid at right back, and we just signed Fisher to back him up. Between Leo, Remick, and Correa, we should be fine at left back. Martins, Dempsey, Barrett, Mansaray, and Jones provide plenty of options up top - particularly if we are hoping to hold a spot for Jordan Morris in 2016.  We've got plenty of quality in central midfield - Alonso, Pineda, Rose, Azira, and Roldan. We might want to sign an aggressive attacking distributor to give us the option of taking a different approach to games when teams are being successful about neutralizing Dempsey and Martins. But players of that sort tend to be pricey, and given that our offense is pretty effective as-is, I don't know that it's necessary.  We could use a good option on the wings. It would be very, very nice if we could bring in a skilled, defensively solid right winger (basically, what Evans gave us last year) so we could free up Mears to get forward more often; I liked the look of his crossing against Dallas. A new signing there would also let us keep Neagle or Pappa in reserve on the bench and available as a super-sub when opposing teams have tired legs, a role both of them fill better than almost anyone else in MLS, and provide some much-needed depth in case we get a couple injuries.  And... center back. If Evans works out there, we probably want another backup center back. Scott is old, Lowe and Ockford are untested. If Evans does not work out there, we need another starting-caliber center back. I doubt Sigi or Garth are ready to give a final verdict on the Evans center back experiment yet, so I expect they'll keep a fair chunk of salary cap space in reserve for the summer transfer window."

Find a good CB that can challenge immediately for a starting spot so that Evans has to work for it (and a backup for replacement if Marshall is hurt or Scott is out). I would also like to see a fast outside midfielder. Someone who we can drop in (or start) with quick speed to change up the attack.  I think we are set at forward, outside defenders, one CB, and midfield. Plenty of backups who can do a decent fill in job when our starters are out."

SoundersFC,31b73j,Wineguy33,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:21:38 2015 UTC,"honestly i would like to see to prospect cm signings.  i dont see it in rose, not to say i dont like the player, and i dont see it in ariza.  both are great squad players but as our cm ages (even ozzie is not entirely invincible) I think wee need more than Roldan coming through, especiall at CDM.  i hear good things from our S2 cm options but we need starpower in cm.  at this point, it is the weakest area in our depth, imo.  i think mansaray and kovar provide exciting attacking options on the wings.  as for the CB situation, we have Scott as a back up for Evans and Marshall, which should be good for this year.  that should give Lowe enough time to develop, i think Lowe will be an excellent back up to evans and marsall going forward after scott.  our FB look great, hopefully Remick breaksthrough but we have Correa in case that doesnt work out.  at right back, we have Ockford and Azira in addition to Fisher.  at CDM we have ozzie and ozzie, azira is great at interceptions and making short easy passes and his movement is good but i am sorry to say he is poor at tackling surprisingly."

He's working to adapt to playing center defender there; either that will work out in the next month or two and we'll have a starting-caliber centerback pair for 2016 and 2017 as well, or it won't work out and we'll move him back up into the midfield."

SoundersFC,31b73j,drluke21,3,Fri Apr 3 16:57:19 2015 UTC,I wouldn't trade Evans. How ever I would love to see him play with pablo rossi and some of the s2 guys as a leader and prep them a little better. if we had excess CBs and mids that is.  Evans means too much to this team as a leader. I believe that Evans will be on the team for a while.
SoundersFC,31b73j,jjspacer,4,Sat Apr 4 00:13:46 2015 UTC,"Evans is a slightly above average player who is always the smartest guy on the field. He's unfortunately not a center back though. Trading him would be disastrous, we need a true center back so Evans can move back to his natural midfield position. Trading him would leave a gaping hole in the team's leadership, you can't just trade that away."
SoundersFC,31b73j,bwc_28,2,Fri Apr 3 20:59:15 2015 UTC,"That's well put, and there's truth to what you say about leadership. I can definitely give him the proper respect for that."

SoundersFC,31b73j,smokey815,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:30:38 2015 UTC,That might not be a bad move. Evans is good as a high level backup at many positions so that makes him valuable. Valuable to us and probably other teams too. It would be a risky move at this point in the season. There would definitely be plenty of fans crying their eyes out over their irrational love affair with the guy.

SoundersFC,31b73j,wichschralpski,4,Fri Apr 3 18:06:04 2015 UTC,"What exactly do you mean by this? Alonso is only 29, so I dont see age catching up to him very soon, and I doubt a bigger team will come and take him from us. And besides this, I think Azira has proven that he can step up in his absence"
SoundersFC,31b73j,CougFanDan,1 point,Fri Apr 3 18:11:19 2015 UTC,"Alonso may ""only"" be 29, but he's had considerable injury issues the last couple of seasons. There's still no telling how he'll bounce back from this offseason surgery, so having a reliable backup to control the play in the middle of the field would be a great use of money."
SoundersFC,31b73j,wichschralpski,-1,Fri Apr 3 18:37:59 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly
SoundersFC,31b73j,stealth_sloth,3,Fri Apr 3 19:01:46 2015 UTC,"That would be Azira. Azira does 95% of what Alonso does for 15% the cost; the perfect MLS backup. There are very few like-for-like replacements for Alonso who would be willing to play in MLS, and all of them would cost too much for us to justify under a salary cap for a backup player."
SoundersFC,31b73j,wichschralpski,2,Fri Apr 3 18:47:02 2015 UTC,Someone to give Azira some competition. He needs to fight for that spot when Alonso needs time off or is injured.
SoundersFC,31b73j,stealth_sloth,3,Fri Apr 3 19:03:27 2015 UTC,"Roldan's UW coach apparently thinks he'll end up being an Alonso-like player in MLS. Also, if Azira slips badly enough Pineda can handle the job too, although he's more of a coordinator and controller and less of a destroyer."
SoundersFC,31b73j,overruns,2,Fri Apr 3 19:06:47 2015 UTC,Yeah I thought this was the idea with Roldan. He would be the replacement to Ozzie eventually. Granted who knows if it works or how seamless a transition it would be.
SoundersFC,31b73j,wichschralpski,2,Fri Apr 3 21:03:05 2015 UTC,I'm only saying this because our form seems to dip without Alonso. If we were able to play as though Alonso isn't there it doesn't matter as much that we pick up such a dominant cdm
SoundersFC,31b73j,stealth_sloth,2,Fri Apr 3 22:04:42 2015 UTC,"That's fair. We certainly do have a downturn when Ozzie isn't on the field for us.  I guess I look at it this way though. I think we're very, very lucky to have Alonso. For the exact role he fills for us, there is no other player in MLS who can match him. If we wanted someone who could cover for him when he's out without a drop-off, we'd need another designated player and an international spot - which obviously isn't something we're doing for a backup.  So we make do with what we've got. If we can't replace Alonso, we don't bankrupt ourselves trying to do so; we spend more on other positions on the field and hopefully find ways to adjust our tactics for the infrequent games he is not available."

SoundersFC,31929w,MowwMoww,9,Thu Apr 2 23:38:42 2015 UTC,I like listening to him talk. Feels very much anti-bs.
SoundersFC,31929w,kenperkins,6,Fri Apr 3 03:47:46 2015 UTC,That's been my favorite thing about him so far. Very straightforward.

SoundersFC,31929w,Dayvido,3,Fri Apr 3 05:49:28 2015 UTC,"I really liked Cooper :/ he deserves more game time, hopefully another club can fit him in their lineup"
SoundersFC,317ktm,Nekokeki,10,Thu Apr 2 16:58:46 2015 UTC,"Probably went something like.   Kenny: Hey Seattle I want to leave!  Seattle:OK Kenny we get it, Can you wait a bit and see if we can make a deal for you?  Kenny: OK.  Seattle: Montreal will give us a draft pick want to go to Montreal?   Kenny: I don't want to go to Montreal!  Seattle:OK nobody will trade for you.   Kenny: Then can I just go?  Seattle: OK."
SoundersFC,317ktm,steerbell,9,Thu Apr 2 18:42:09 2015 UTC,At least we know when he scores on us he won't celebrate.
SoundersFC,317ktm,trickjarrett,6,Thu Apr 2 18:03:48 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised after seeing all of the trade rumors we weren't able to complete something, but not surprised that he's gone.   Seems like a decent guy, solid player, puts in a lot of work for the team.  I definitely wish him well.  Ultimately, you can't keep someone of his salary on the bench in the MLS.   This frees up a lot of salary and we likely still have a fair amount of allocation.  I'm thinking this might be the first domino for some action in the market."

SoundersFC,317ktm,capnheim,4,Thu Apr 2 17:11:36 2015 UTC,It will be interesting to see where he lands.  Too bad we couldn't keep him as I think he adds good depth for CCL & USOC.
SoundersFC,317ktm,CougFanDan,2,Thu Apr 2 17:05:47 2015 UTC,"I bet he'll be picked up by the end of the week. Other teams probably didn't want to trade for someone they figured we'd end up cutting, now they can pick him up for nothing"
SoundersFC,317ktm,TropangTexter,2,Thu Apr 2 18:17:25 2015 UTC,Frees up valuable salary (Kenny was on 275K) and should net some allocation too if I read the rules right. Maybe add some defense?

SoundersFC,312c48,philwelch,0,Fri Apr 3 02:26:29 2015 UTC,Not sure if April Fools... but no that's never going to happen
SoundersFC,312c48,CougFanDan,2,Wed Apr 1 18:23:50 2015 UTC,That rumor came out well before April Fools. It was there last summer too. We're one of the 3 MLS clubs that has been linked with him. NYCFC and NYRB are the other two.
SoundersFC,312c48,randymeeker,2,Wed Apr 1 19:06:41 2015 UTC,Except that he's already accepted an offer from Qatar.
SoundersFC,312c48,ravegreener,3,Wed Apr 1 19:10:22 2015 UTC,Not according to him.
SoundersFC,312c48,randymeeker,3,Wed Apr 1 19:15:45 2015 UTC,So you're saying there's a chance?
SoundersFC,312c48,ravegreener,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:01:25 2015 UTC,"Not much of one. It sounds like he'll probably go to Al-Sadd, but the deal isn't quite done yet, so Xavi can't really talk about it. I think part of the deal over there will involve running the club's academy, so it would be a tough offer for any club outside of Europe to match."
SoundersFC,312c48,randymeeker,2,Thu Apr 2 01:44:20 2015 UTC,"Allegedly, but that's one rumor that looks to be pretty accurate"

SoundersFC,312c48,dsn0wman,1 point,Wed Apr 1 21:27:56 2015 UTC,I would assume it's for allocation dollars and to give us more cap room.
SoundersFC,312c48,MowwMoww,1 point,Wed Apr 1 20:39:15 2015 UTC,Today I learned that players have a say in trades in MLS. Might just be the Sounders doing him a service.
SoundersFC,312c48,overruns,2,Wed Apr 1 20:56:34 2015 UTC,"Well, using my extensive experience with FIFA Career manager mode, the way it works is: Teams negotiate a transfer of a player. ""We'll pay you X and give you player Y for player Z."" Once the two teams agree, that's the transfer fee.  Once that's set, then the buying team has to negotiate with the player and agent for a salary. If the player doesn't want to move there he can reject the offer, or counter offer, etc."
SoundersFC,312c48,BugSTi,2,Wed Apr 1 21:26:24 2015 UTC,I thought contracts were with MLS not each club so couldn't a move be forced? Or am I misinformed?

SoundersFC,312c48,MowwMoww,1 point,Wed Apr 1 23:05:19 2015 UTC,"I think you are right.  The new cba supposedly allowed for player ""free agent"" status if they have been in MLS for 7 or 8 years. Cooper being older, should have some more say in his destiny."

SoundersFC,311g3h,cantbeassed,10,Wed Apr 1 10:17:05 2015 UTC,"I agree. I think people are expected us to win the league like we did last year. The supporters have made it clear to management that we want an MLS cup. I think Sigi is going to keep testing things out, building depth, and as a side effect not winning games.  This will prepare us for the final run. I imagine we'll peak late this year with a bunch of wins in a row. Last year we got really good but dipped off just before the playoffs. This year we need to delay that form by about 3 weeks."
SoundersFC,311g3h,vuduwastaken,5,Wed Apr 1 11:23:05 2015 UTC,"We also started off slow last year.. In the first 5 games, 2 were losses and 1 draw.. We can't panic or judge the season off of just the initial few weeks.  We were also 1-1-1 against San Jose."
SoundersFC,311g3h,planetes,3,Wed Apr 1 19:17:40 2015 UTC,"Hopefully we can bring along all they young players, and get them more time and success. I think the Evans experiment ought to be successful by playoff time as long as he pays attention, and puts on 10 lbs of muscle to deal with physical strikers."
SoundersFC,311g3h,dsn0wman,3,Wed Apr 1 17:38:27 2015 UTC,"I agree with your points but at the end of the day I think it call breaks down to this -- any away points are a win. If you can draw every match on the road and win your matches at home then you're always going to be at the top of the table. Points are the road are a win despite the circumstances. Yeah, it felt like a loss at the time but looking back it is most certainly a win if you look at the season as a whole."
SoundersFC,311g3h,MowwMoww,2,Wed Apr 1 20:59:37 2015 UTC,"I dunno, I think a tie is a good result. We had a couple situations that I thought were guaranteed goals, like 85% of the time it will be a goal situations and we just didn't get the ball in the back of the net. I mean, let's be honest... Barrett really flubbed what was a good shot at the goal and got injured in the process, not good.  However I agree that there was some really good play by younger players and some of our depth in the roster that will likely come in handy through the rest of the season.  Due to the fact that we denied Dallas two points, I'll take it because this game was going to be a loss for sure without that idiotic red card."

SoundersFC,30zptz,enigmamr,5,Wed Apr 1 02:05:02 2015 UTC,There are parking garages nearby with bicycle lockup specifically for the stadium.  Maybe you could rig up a lock for your longboard and leave it there?
SoundersFC,30zptz,weeenis,3,Wed Apr 1 15:28:27 2015 UTC,"Hello I found this answer here - http://www.soundersfc.com/matchday/stadium-guide.  ""Skateboarding and/or rollerblading on property surrounding CenturyLink Field and Event Center is strictly prohibited.""  This leads me to believe that if skateboards aren't allowed on the property you wouldn't be able to bring them in to the stadium.  Sorry!"
SoundersFC,30zptz,MagnoliaSeattleFan,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:48:51 2015 UTC,I don't actually know the answer but I think it would be pretty unlikely that they would let you take the board in.

SoundersFC,30z8qn,Zorrino,4,Tue Mar 31 22:08:46 2015 UTC,"In the years when we play Portland twice, the stadium is typically open during the match in the summer. The game in April will be at the regular capacity of 39-40k.   The secondary market (StubHub, Craigslist, Ticket Exchange) for games against Portland will be significantly more expensive than buying tickets directly from the club. If you can find seats together through the Sounders, I'd go ahead and get them. If you don't, you'll probably wind up spending at least $15 more per ticket."
SoundersFC,30z8qn,randymeeker,2,Wed Apr 1 05:51:38 2015 UTC,"I emailed them a couple weeks ago about opening the stadium. They said they have three planned games this year.

SoundersFC,30ut8f,Aurick,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:39:10 2015 UTC,Never mind guys emailed my rep. Cheers.
SoundersFC,30ut8f,weeenis,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:47:01 2015 UTC,Has anyone purchased this and received their promo code yet? It's been 4 hours and I'm still waiting.
SoundersFC,30ut8f,AreTheMadOnes,2,Tue Mar 31 03:06:17 2015 UTC,"Yes, my promo code email came in less than 30mins after purchase."
SoundersFC,30ut8f,punkrockpete,1 point,Tue Mar 31 03:22:33 2015 UTC,It looks like it has varied from a couple of minutes to a few hours (mine took about 90 minutes).
SoundersFC,30ut8f,AreTheMadOnes,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:09:53 2015 UTC,"I bought mine yesterday and still haven't received the promo code. Not sure what's up with that. I was waiting for technology to take care of me, but I might need to contact a real person(i.e. my ticket rep)."
SoundersFC,30ut8f,punkrockpete,1 point,Tue Mar 31 15:03:48 2015 UTC,Ditto.
SoundersFC,30ut8f,DronePirate,2,Tue Mar 31 15:17:44 2015 UTC,Apparently they have been sending them out in batches and I just missed the cut off yesterday. I was told that I'd get mine by this afternoon.
SoundersFC,30ut8f,doublemazaa,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:00:50 2015 UTC,Good news! Thanks for the follow up.
SoundersFC,30ut8f,doublemazaa,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:06:11 2015 UTC,Nice. Got one.
SoundersFC,30ut8f,Syuk_Dat_Deke,1 point,Tue Mar 31 04:46:49 2015 UTC,"Question regarding matchpass/ticket account website... my buddy and I have tickets together. Is it possible for him to have his own matchpass/ticket account login/password, or do we just share one account.  I signed up for this, but I'm sure he'd be interested too."
SoundersFC,30ur6u,Sempuukyaku,6,Mon Mar 30 21:42:23 2015 UTC,"Not until they decide the Sounders are big enough for their own SSS. As of now Seattle is at the top level as far as development in America and there is no doubt that a compound like Man City just built or like so many other big clubs in Europe have, but that won't get here until its necessary to have our own stadium and the lease runs out. As of now I don't think Starfire is stretched for space while they are training."
SoundersFC,30ur6u,MowwMoww,4,Mon Mar 30 22:53:24 2015 UTC,"Sounders U23 doesn't play at Starfire. They also have a different ownership group than Sounders FC. That group also owns Sounders Women. Anyway, the U23 and Sounders Women seasons are very short. The PDL season runs from late May to the middle of July and the same is true of the W League.   Sounders Women are currently scheduled to play 2 home games at Starfire this year, with one date still TBD and other home games in Auburn, Bellingham, and Mercer Island."
SoundersFC,30ur6u,randymeeker,1 point,Tue Mar 31 01:19:13 2015 UTC,"I think soon, but not yet. Starfire is big enough to cover their needs for the time being. I believe they're building a new clubhouse for them where the 'pavilion' is now though.   Also note that the first team also trains at the Virginia Mason Athletic Center (VMAC) at times."
SoundersFC,30snz1,cantbeassed,3,Mon Mar 30 11:20:14 2015 UTC,"speaking of which, what is the format for USL? Is there a Supporters Shield as well as USL Cup won in playoff format?"
SoundersFC,30snz1,antifreze,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:21:29 2015 UTC,"http://www.uslsoccer.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_LANG=C&DB_OEM_ID=32800&ATCLID=209861534   The USL will be split into 12-team Eastern and Western Conferences in 2015, with teams facing each of their conference opponents at least twice during the 28-game regular season schedule. The additional six games (beyond the standard home and away against the other 11 intra-conference foes) will be matchups against geographic rivals resulting in several cross-conference contests.  The 2015 season will also bring changes to the USL’s single-elimination playoff format with the top six finishers in each conference moving on to the four-week postseason. Teams will be seeded No. 1 through No. 6 in each conference, with the top two seeds receiving first-round byes and the No. 3 seed hosting the No. 6 seed and the No. 4 seed hosting the No. 5 seed.  The winner of the No. 3 vs. No. 6 game will then travel to face the No. 2 seed, and the winner of the No. 4 vs. No. 5 game will travel to face the No. 1 seed. The winners will meet in the Eastern & Western Conference Championship games with the remaining two teams advancing to square off in the 2015 USL Championship, hosted by the higher seeded club.  There are a total of six awards to be earned in the 2015 USL season.  In addition to the highest honor of 2015 USL Champions - awarded to the winner of the league’s post-season tournament - the USL will officially honor the Eastern Conference & Western Conference champions for both the regular season and the playoffs, as well as the overall USL Regular Season Champion - the team earning the most regular season points."
SoundersFC,30snz1,stealth_sloth,6,Mon Mar 30 16:36:36 2015 UTC,And there is a chance to win the Open Cup.. technically.
SoundersFC,30snz1,antifreze,12,Mon Mar 30 16:40:57 2015 UTC,Here's to S2 taking out Timbers first team at Starfire
SoundersFC,30snz1,MessiNeverDives,1 point,Mon Mar 30 17:56:27 2015 UTC,Really want a S2 v S1 open cup :)
SoundersFC,30snz1,gear7,-1,Tue Mar 31 02:57:51 2015 UTC,It can't happen.
SoundersFC,30snz1,HMARS,5,Wed Apr 1 02:45:38 2015 UTC,Cascadia demitasse? Cascadia shotglass?
SoundersFC,30snz1,vuduwastaken,4,Mon Mar 30 15:27:49 2015 UTC,Schooner!

SoundersFC,30snz1,Chuurp,2,Mon Mar 30 15:54:41 2015 UTC,The Cascadia Growler does have a nice ring to it.
SoundersFC,30snz1,MowwMoww,2,Wed Apr 1 21:33:33 2015 UTC,"Well we definitely need one. It would fit perfectly with the meaning of the Cascadia cup, too."
SoundersFC,30snz1,eriknordheim,2,Mon Mar 30 20:37:03 2015 UTC,Cascadia Sippie Cup! Vancouver Whitecaps Ripples v Portland Timbers Kindling v Seattle Sounders Streetcars (?)
SoundersFC,30snz1,pamtastrophe,3,Mon Mar 30 21:37:22 2015 UTC,That sentence really got away from you.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,BanksKnowsBest,9,Mon Mar 30 03:05:18 2015 UTC,Oh how i would have liked Jones against Dallas.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,XORosaurus,10,Mon Mar 30 05:22:51 2015 UTC,Craven doesn't look half bad either.  Couple quality crosses.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,smokey815,5,Mon Mar 30 05:32:31 2015 UTC,Good crosses while under pressure=gold.  I liked what I saw.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,banemaler,6,Mon Mar 30 05:59:16 2015 UTC,Nice reaction to get his goal as well.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,smokey815,1 point,Mon Mar 30 13:23:03 2015 UTC,He's been playing very well. Got a goal in the opener too I believe.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,MowwMoww,6,Mon Mar 30 20:59:55 2015 UTC,"Obviously poor defense from Divecaps 2, but even still, to be able to take advantage of those lapses is impressive.  Very promising squad."
SoundersFC,30rnl9,cubby13579,4,Mon Mar 30 13:28:43 2015 UTC,So I don't know much about USL but are they really that good? Because it appears to be two impressive wins to start the year.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,overruns,1 point,Mon Mar 30 07:40:29 2015 UTC,"It just seems like the defense is really solid compared to most other teams so far. The sample size is small so far but S2 has effectively a bunch of S1 players starting in defense. Hell, even Correa started for S2 yesterday."
SoundersFC,30rnl9,MowwMoww,4,Mon Mar 30 21:00:57 2015 UTC,"Craven, Rossi and Jones look ready for MLS play.  What are the rules for them moving between rosters?"
SoundersFC,30rnl9,rophel,9,Mon Mar 30 08:11:46 2015 UTC,"Jones is on the main roster and is loaned down for games. Craven and Rossi would need to be signed to main roster contracts, and Rossi would take up an international spot. It's early days yet."
SoundersFC,30rnl9,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Mon Mar 30 09:13:32 2015 UTC,Is S2 gonna be a really good USL team?
SoundersFC,30rnl9,CascadiaKid,2,Mon Mar 30 15:31:18 2015 UTC,"I think so, you do have to consider the unpredictability that a roster likely to change frequently will bring. Garth is apparently a great development guy and the core of the roster looks pretty solid."
SoundersFC,30rnl9,foxpawz,2,Mon Mar 30 15:49:33 2015 UTC,I think (think not based on any real knowledge) The Seattle players are happy to be playing. They understand this is the path and playing for S2 is not a punishment or professional purgatory. I bet Ezra has them believing if they play well they will get a fair shot at the first team. I think the Sounders believe strongly in USL and see it as a very good thing. Now if a players plays well in USL but really has no where to play on the big team then what? Time will tell I guess.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,steerbell,2,Mon Mar 30 16:10:15 2015 UTC,And I think it is very important to note that this is brand new to the fringe players. Before S2 they got ~10 matches a season against reserve teams in MLS and maybe a college team match or two. This is a consistent professional schedule and I think it'll improve the team a lot.
SoundersFC,30rnl9,MowwMoww,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:02:58 2015 UTC,"If somebody is ready for MLS, they'll get their shot at the first team eventually. Between regular season, CCL, and Open Cup there will be plenty of opportunities. It depends a lot on the player too though. Some guys might be content waiting for their shot, while others might ask to be traded, loaned, or sold."
SoundersFC,30rnl9,CascadiaKid,2,Mon Mar 30 16:20:07 2015 UTC,Which leads to another interesting thing. What are the players rights? How long of a contract can S2 sign them on? Free agency? Trading from a S2 contract to a MLS contract?
SoundersFC,30rnl9,steerbell,2,Mon Mar 30 16:50:14 2015 UTC,Those are the golden questions.
SoundersFC,30pqof,jjspacer,3,Sun Mar 29 17:15:12 2015 UTC,Last I saw was this from Matt Pentz
SoundersFC,30pqof,LevinsBend,4,Sun Mar 29 17:49:29 2015 UTC,"@mattpentz   2015-03-29 02:10 UTC  Because a number of people have asked: The Kenny Cooper situation, as far as I know, is still in flux. Still on roster, but not in squad     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]"
SoundersFC,30pqof,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Sun Mar 29 17:49:36 2015 UTC,"Unless you are Cooper or the FO, it's speculation but everything would indicate he is on the way out. Sigi when asked about Cooper says it is a question for Garth, he has not been in any lineups and has been absent from the Seattle area. He is a free agent I believe so that could be what is slowing the process. Cooper might be out shopping for the best deal but is probably not finding the paycheck he probably wants. I'm hoping the FO has a player waiting to join the squad contingent on Cooper moving on. Considering that they opened up an international spot this would make sense. Where will the player play and will he join the team now or in the summer window? I'm guessing there is only so long a team will want to wait on a free agent to move themselves? The process seems to be taking a while."
SoundersFC,30pqof,Wineguy33,1 point,Sun Mar 29 18:26:19 2015 UTC,"Very interest on who we bring in if he goes. It'd have to be a forward, right?  Barrett isn't enough depth."
SoundersFC,30pqof,smokey815,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:20:58 2015 UTC,"In my opinion, our young FW's on S2 are proving to be good depth. I'd rather use the spot for a CB. I want the Brad experiment to work but we need a backup plan. I'm also not sold on Zach Scott being able to last a full season if he's seeing a lot of playing time"
SoundersFC,30pqof,canucknuckles,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:26:55 2015 UTC,"Lowe has looked really good with S2 and in the Tijuana friendly. I bet he gets some first team minutes this year. If Evans works out and Lowe can be reasonably effective in MLS, I don't see a reason to add a CB this summer. I wouldn't be surprised to see a Scott/Lowe pairing in the early rounds of the Open Cup and in the group stage of Champions League."
SoundersFC,30pqof,randymeeker,2,Mon Mar 30 04:37:46 2015 UTC,I have really liked Lowe in the S2 matches. I do see him as a future rotational CB but since he missed nearly all of last season I think it would be good for him to use this year to develop and get regular starting time in S2.
SoundersFC,30pqof,canucknuckles,1 point,Mon Mar 30 04:43:27 2015 UTC,Geb looks really off without it.
SoundersFC,30pqof,fernando_69,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:59:28 2015 UTC,"He's most likely gone, but damn we could have used him on Saturday as a replacement for Barrett."
SoundersFC,30pqof,CougFanDan,1 point,Mon Mar 30 03:24:34 2015 UTC,"As everyone else said, he's effectively gone. He isn't playing for either squad, isn't traveling, and isn't even practicing as far as I know. Sigi directs all questions about Cooper to Garth, meaning it is a contract issue. I wouldn't count on seeing him back."
SoundersFC,30puq2,Somebody_Call911,14,Sun Mar 29 17:48:27 2015 UTC,"I really can't see Azira starting over Pineda - his recovery is fantastic for sure, but Gonzo has quite the chemistry with Alonso. If I remember right, there was a couple times Pineda showed his frustration with Azira."
SoundersFC,30puq2,Skuby_Duby_Du,4,Sun Mar 29 18:15:05 2015 UTC,"Would you see Azira subbing in then? Maybe for Ozzie at first when he's not 100%, but when he's healthy, would you see Azira coming in for Pineda late second half?"
SoundersFC,30puq2,Skuby_Duby_Du,1 point,Sun Mar 29 21:51:54 2015 UTC,I could definitely see Azira coming on for Ozzie a couple weeks after he makes his return. He's shown he's capable of stepping up in his absence and it would do well to ease Alonso back in.
SoundersFC,30puq2,MowwMoww,6,Mon Mar 30 01:10:03 2015 UTC,Pineda will be.
SoundersFC,30puq2,lightjedi5,5,Sun Mar 29 20:06:46 2015 UTC,"People keep saying Azira, but I think Azira is more defensive. I would definitely say Pineda as a first choice with Rose as a back up, Azira is basically Ozzie's back up"
SoundersFC,30puq2,nemisys1st,2,Mon Mar 30 05:16:49 2015 UTC,I would love to see both Azira and Alonso locking down midfield. Azira's growth has been incredible.  Maybe push Pineda outside?
SoundersFC,30puq2,john_mcrotten,3,Sun Mar 29 22:00:21 2015 UTC,So no Pappa or Neagle then? Azira is doing a decent job so far but I don't think he's part of a first choice lineup.
SoundersFC,30puq2,USA_A-OK,1 point,Sun Mar 29 22:55:34 2015 UTC,"Azira is not nearly decisive enough on the ball, he was painful to watch in that Dallas game for long stretches"
SoundersFC,30puq2,cantbeassed,2,Mon Mar 30 19:05:19 2015 UTC,"pappa, alonso, pineda, neagle."
SoundersFC,30puq2,alexj757,2,Mon Mar 30 11:21:07 2015 UTC,Here is the thing. Pineda links up well with Ozzie because of the fact that he has a little bit more of an eye for a forward pass than Azira does. Azira and Ozzie are very alike and it wouldn't be wise to have both of them on the field as opposed to a Pineda and Ozzie partnership.
SoundersFC,30puq2,USA_A-OK,1 point,Mon Mar 30 14:29:37 2015 UTC,Pineda 100%
SoundersFC,30nwnj,LevinsBend,6,Sun Mar 29 02:35:17 2015 UTC,I can see why that was a straight red now. Thank goodness the ref was right there. I'm also glad Rose is okay after that; it looks like it hurts.
SoundersFC,30nwnj,pamtastrophe,5,Sun Mar 29 16:29:09 2015 UTC,Keller kept saying this was a yellow card.... That's a pretty brutal high kick in my opinion. However I am not a professional player so I don't know. Either way I am happy we at least tied yesterday missing so many people.
SoundersFC,30nwnj,mcvay206,2,Sun Mar 29 14:10:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he kept trying to argue there was no intent or maliciousness in the kick. I agree the kick was unintentional, but it's still a studs up kick to the gut. Regardless of intent, it was dangerous and reckless. Red card every time in my book."
SoundersFC,30nwnj,adillen,1 point,Tue Mar 31 05:13:17 2015 UTC,"The angle from full speed doesn't look horrible, but once they show a few others and you see those studs up cleats nail rose in the chest then drag down, yikes."
SoundersFC,30ny57,smokey815,2,Sun Mar 29 02:51:13 2015 UTC,"I voted for ""Gonzalo Pappa"" for MOTM."
SoundersFC,30ny57,ravegreener,5,Sun Mar 29 03:06:58 2015 UTC,I just miss Marco :(
SoundersFC,30ndfp,Tonixz,6,Sat Mar 28 23:41:33 2015 UTC,Yeah looks like Marshall is out too. This could get ugly... :(
SoundersFC,30ndfp,kbar7,7,Sat Mar 28 23:44:12 2015 UTC,#noba
SoundersFC,30ndfp,vuduwastaken,4,Sat Mar 28 23:55:02 2015 UTC,Ugh I didn't even notice Marshall was missing too.  I just saw Martins missing and rose starting...  I know it might go against how most of this sub feels but I have never enjoyed the way rose plays...  I feel like he has poor passing and gives up possession easily.  This year he has been a little better but I would almost prefer the upside of Kovar.  Especially in a game that we seem to be trying new things out in
SoundersFC,30ndfp,mcvay206,3,Sat Mar 28 23:48:58 2015 UTC,"I think where rose lacks some of his skills in those area, he pulls what I call an ""oba"" running as fast as you can and playing your goddamn heart out every time you step on that field. Watching rose is a lot of fun, that kid wants time on the field and he appears to bust his ass to earn every minute he gets."
SoundersFC,30ndfp,benfreilich,1 point,Sun Mar 29 14:19:17 2015 UTC,I've seen so many surprise last minute goals from Andy Rose I've stopped doubting him. Not one of the best midfielders but definitely a strong will.
SoundersFC,30ndfp,theREALbmills,6,Thu Apr 2 23:53:50 2015 UTC,Can we just call this lineup S3...?
SoundersFC,30ndfp,bigern79,2,Sun Mar 29 00:49:50 2015 UTC,Sounds like he strained a quad in training. What are these guys doing the day before game day that the keep getting hurt in what should be lighter practices?
SoundersFC,30ndfp,eosrebel,5,Sat Mar 28 23:48:06 2015 UTC,"It wasn't in training, he picked it up during the Tijuana game."
SoundersFC,30ndfp,hhdslater,2,Sun Mar 29 03:22:04 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Marshall is a much bigger deal..."
SoundersFC,30ndfp,nemisys1st,1 point,Sun Mar 29 00:50:07 2015 UTC,Was here wondering the same thing???
SoundersFC,30ndfp,deweese3,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:42:47 2015 UTC,Well this sure is going to test us.
SoundersFC,30ndfp,TheBarberOfFleetSt,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:49:26 2015 UTC,Also only 6 substitutes.
SoundersFC,30ndfp,MowwMoww,1 point,Sat Mar 28 23:58:43 2015 UTC,No clue. Nothing has been announced as far as I've seen. This is ridiculous.
SoundersFC,30ndfp,BBQLays,-2,Sun Mar 29 00:24:18 2015 UTC,EDIT: Never mind. Boo coaches!
SoundersFC,30occu,SonOfMechaMummy,28,Sun Mar 29 05:33:13 2015 UTC,MOTM: Mears  He was really the only one I saw playing consistently well all match.
SoundersFC,30occu,MowwMoww,2,Sun Mar 29 06:13:35 2015 UTC,I'll second you on that. He was everywhere fighting for the ball and trying to create chances. The cross he put in early in the match was a beauty too.
SoundersFC,30occu,john_mcrotten,2,Sun Mar 29 14:21:13 2015 UTC,He's been fantastic. Very impressed with his crossing and decision making in terms of when to go forward.
SoundersFC,30occu,smokey815,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:49:53 2015 UTC,"Mears of Leo for sure, either of them were really solid this game"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,MowwMoww,17,Sun Mar 29 02:30:32 2015 UTC,"We need better striker depth. Barrett's inability to finish was what killed us tonight. He had at least 3 chances to score. I can honestly say Oba and Dempsey would have scored.   Brad Evans bounced back in my opinion and played a good game against a good FC Dallas offense.   Given that we were a man up for basically the entire match, I'm disappointed to walk away with only a point. But if you told me we would pick up a point against a 3-0 Dallas on the road while missing Marshall, Oba, Alonso, Dempsey, and Pappa, I would be happy. So I guess I'm not too bummed out."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,OG_Retro,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:36:33 2015 UTC,"We need more striker depth, more midfielder depth, more defender depth... I put the blame on coaching. We have depth. We just aren't using the talent correctly."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,MarquettePharm,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:34:36 2015 UTC,How are we not utilizing talent correctly??
SoundersFC,30nw5y,LordNubington,2,Sun Mar 29 15:34:56 2015 UTC,"Evans at CB, expecting Neagle to be able to handle 2 defenders and not turn the ball over, expecting Barrett to be able to fight for crosses in the air against defenders that have 6 inches on him, only having Andy Rose in the middle of the offense and wondering why the offense can't get the ball out of the side of the pitch... a few of my observations."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,MarquettePharm,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:17:13 2015 UTC,"Evans at CB is an ongoing experiment, he played well.  Do you think we should be playing Scott instead? Barrett up top is because he is our next best forward, who should have been playing instead and don't say cooper because he is not really on the team anymore. Rose was playing offensive midfield, and was also supposed to be in the hunt for those crosses as well. Given what we had available I thought it was a well thought out line up. Who would you have played instead of what we had out there and where would you have played them?"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,LordNubington,0,Sun Mar 29 23:28:38 2015 UTC,Lol  Wut
SoundersFC,30nw5y,sp_the_ghost,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:15:21 2015 UTC,"We have Cooper though, who has pretty good touch. Have no idea why we don't utilize him more."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,hhdslater,4,Sun Mar 29 05:25:26 2015 UTC,"Cooper is still dealing with a CBA-related issue. He likely wants to become a free agent, or Seattle is looking for trade partners, somewhere he can be a starter/regular contributor"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,CougFanDan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 06:02:11 2015 UTC,"Word, that's cool. Cooper deserves something better honestly... in terms of playing time."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,hhdslater,25,Thu Apr 2 09:00:24 2015 UTC,"I'll take it, I really will. No Martins/Dempsey/Marshall/Pappa/Ozzie, and I was kind of expecting to lose. A draw away is fine by me.  Brad looked like a totally capable centerback though against a really good Dallas attack, so that's cool. Significantly less worried about that experiment after tonight.   This game really cried out for a Kenny Cooper though."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,joylongdivision,2,Sun Mar 29 02:38:39 2015 UTC,Especially since he's been deadly to his former teams.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,ravegreener,2,Sun Mar 29 02:42:24 2015 UTC,Yea I remember watching this game and thinking Cooper would have been perfect.   I love seeing him take the field but Seattle has an all star line up and also a lot of young talent they want to invest game time into. It wasn't bad but being 1 man up it didn't even show that Dallas was crippled
SoundersFC,30nw5y,Dayvido,2,Sun Mar 29 04:49:08 2015 UTC,I think that Cooper would have finished both of those chances flubbed by Barrett.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,john_mcrotten,10,Sun Mar 29 14:22:19 2015 UTC,"That was honestly so much better than I was expecting. Half of our starters, and on top of that, almost all of our most important starters were missing. I'll take a draw that we probably should have won."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,hhdslater,7,Sun Mar 29 02:33:25 2015 UTC,"This so much. By the time the whistle blew, it was nearly our 2nd team on the field.   Should we have won being up a man for 70min? On paper, yes.  Most people are forgetting that it probably would have been a slaughter if the play from first 18 minutes kept going.   Look at the possession change. Dallas controlled possession for the first minutes. http://imgur.com/jSMjCdv"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,BugSTi,2,Sun Mar 29 02:53:39 2015 UTC,"For what it's worth...  The home team generally scores about 0.5 goals more than the away team in MLS. A team with a red card in minute 18 generally scores about one goal less than their opponent. So it's a plausible argument to say that the 18th-minute red card should be viewed as essentially shifting home-field advantage from FC Dallas to Seattle.  To my mind, that helps put things in perspective. If we fielded the same starting XI against FC Dallas in a home match (and no red card), how disappointed would we be with a 0-0 draw? I guess  that's about how disappointed we should be in the outcome of this game too."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,stealth_sloth,3,Sun Mar 29 05:38:39 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't be disappointed at all. There's not a player in that team that I was truly expecting to score. And that's home or away. I expected a clean sheet once we went up a man, but a goal still wasn't really an expectation."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,smokey815,7,Sun Mar 29 15:53:20 2015 UTC,"I would have been happy sneaking out of there with a draw, all things considered.   THEN, that red card happened. And I felt we had a legitimate chance of winning. But we squandered it. So now, I'm not so happy."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,AreTheMadOnes,3,Sun Mar 29 03:07:16 2015 UTC,That was my exact thought process
SoundersFC,30nw5y,JamieKThomas,1 point,Sun Mar 29 03:13:14 2015 UTC,That's a bit negative considering the players we had out.  Would love to hear your thoughts on Brads performance last night as I wasn't able to watch. From what I've read it seems like he had a bit of a better game
SoundersFC,30nw5y,MammothMan34,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:23:42 2015 UTC,He did have a better game overall but at the same time half the match it was basically Castillo vs. everyone else. The first 20 or so minutes of the match was basically a barrage of crosses and passes and last second clearances by the Sounders. It's pretty hard to judge how he or anyone else played because of the red card but at the very least we can say we didn't concede I guess.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,sp_the_ghost,15,Sun Mar 29 20:04:51 2015 UTC,"Not that the rest of the attack gets off the hook from their no-show, but mother of God Chad Barrett just put the ball in the back of the net.   70 minutes of a man advantage and no offense to show for it. Just pathetic."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,ravegreener,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:32:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, pathetic that a team with Rose, Neagle, Barrett and Roldan starting didn't score.   Or perhaps you mean completely and utterly expected."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,jaschac,7,Sun Mar 29 16:16:30 2015 UTC,"Tough to be too dissappointed. Of course I would have liked a win, but sending out a reserve team against the top team in the league and coming out with a point. In fact, even if we were full strength vs. full strength away I'd probably be satisfied with a point.  After a win, a 0-0 draw is the best possible result."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,AreTheMadOnes,6,Sun Mar 29 02:45:30 2015 UTC,"I hate to sound like an echo, but, yeaaaaah.... At the start of the match, I would have been fine getting out with a draw. But being a man up for 70 minutes? It feels wrong not to be able to capitalize on that. Or maybe, perhaps it would be better to word that as ""capitalize more"". Even up a man, we were still missing a huge chunk of the team. I mean, hell, we had on a guy tonight that still in high school. But at the same time... to not even get a single shot on target? I can understand that they were defending solidly, but we need to be able to put something in the right part of the field."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,Schwa142,4,Sun Mar 29 03:26:48 2015 UTC,I have been impressed by the younger squad though. It's a different atmosphere at Starfire but I've been happy with my S2 season ticket decision thus far. So much potential with those guys.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,DronePirate,5,Sun Mar 29 03:39:15 2015 UTC,"Well, fuck..."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,smokey815,4,Sun Mar 29 02:31:27 2015 UTC,I thought Fisher looked really composed coming in late.  Roldan OK. Kovar not so impressive on the free kicks.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,betacatenin,2,Sun Mar 29 03:22:47 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the ratings plug.  I'd have taken a draw at kickoff in an instant, but after the red, I wanted 3 points.    I thought the defense was quite good, Barrett's finishing was brutal, and we really looked like a team missing half it's best XI."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,smokey815,2,Sun Mar 29 03:13:04 2015 UTC,"Sigh  We're onto Houston!  On another note, any word on when Ozzie could be back?"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,betacatenin,2,Sun Mar 29 03:20:59 2015 UTC,Way more worried about getting Oba out there.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,TropangTexter,1 point,Sun Mar 29 15:53:55 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Barrett could not finish if his life depended on it last night. It's just concerning that's there no update on Ozzie, I'd like him back ASAP."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,sp_the_ghost,2,Sun Mar 29 19:00:34 2015 UTC,"i mean honestly, not getting 3 points when up a man for 72 minutes sucks, but without your five best players playing, getting a point against a really good team that was less hurt by injuries or the break is a result i will not lose sleep over.  it also is really good to see guys like roldan, kovar, mansaray, fisher get minutes. if it is true that home grown players will not be part of the salary cap (which goes true for all the four but fisher), then that is huge for this franchise to be able to put out guys like the calibre of those guys and to also start giving those guys minutes this early into their professional careers. the future of this team is bright."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,-Zoomacroom-,2,Sun Mar 29 04:54:39 2015 UTC,Must be great being Lamar Neagle. You can play like a cardboard cutout for 90 minutes and nobody will say a word.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,JamieKThomas,3,Sun Mar 29 16:21:16 2015 UTC,"I'm not happy with that result, at all.  Edit: It was a frustrating draw. It was FIFA15-like rage, being up a man for most of the game and not being able to score 1 goal."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,sp_the_ghost,1 point,Sun Mar 29 02:58:41 2015 UTC,"You should be, with all the players a have missing a draw is a great point, especially away and especially considering the form Dallas is in.  Sure we could have pushed on after the red card but all things considering if you had offered me a point before the game I would have taken it."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,pal25,1 point,Sun Mar 29 13:25:00 2015 UTC,Perspective. Before kickoff you'd have taken a point without question.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,AreTheMadOnes,2,Sun Mar 29 16:17:58 2015 UTC,"Pretty much summed it up in the title post...  Turns out that missing like 5 of your starters does affect the game, although to be honest I expected more from Sounders 2 all the same :-/"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,pamtastrophe,2,Sun Mar 29 02:34:14 2015 UTC,"S2 is just getting the opportunity to gel, and they don't play much with the S1 guys(who have played with each other much more). I expected more telepathy with S1.   You know...how when Dempsey and Martins give and go...it's a beautiful thing to see them connected on a higher level. We need more of that all around."
SoundersFC,30nw5y,Jack2142,2,Sun Mar 29 03:46:03 2015 UTC,Dempsey and Martins connecting is probably the best love story in all of Seattle. Its just so beautiful.
SoundersFC,30nw5y,fragbot,1 point,Sun Mar 29 16:40:28 2015 UTC,"Would have been happy with a draw at the match start, I felt our attack would be fairly toothless since out only starting attacker is Neagle, and despite my like of him he is our least skilled starting attacker. If I were to make a change, I would have started Neagle up top and Kovar on the wing. Neagle isn't a great technical player ,but I feel he is a much more solid finisher than Barrett. Barrett is also better as a super sub to run down the offense in the last 20 minutes or so…"
SoundersFC,30nw5y,CougFanDan,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:11:38 2015 UTC,"Tepid as a bowl of cold, unsweetened oatmeal.  I gotta say that tonight's game was unbelievably mediocre.  While nil-nil games are often interesting, this one appeared to have both teams regularly tripping over themselves.  Mears was the only one who looked sharp and, maybe, Kovar for the short time he was on.  Am I right in thinking Neagle just took air other people could breathe?"
SoundersFC,30nyrl,cutlers-last-cig,11,Sun Mar 29 02:58:23 2015 UTC,"Chances are, without the redcard, we would have lost. Look at the possession from the first 15minutes. http://imgur.com/jSMjCdv  Very heavy swing towards dallas.  Our 2nd team vs their near 1st.  I'll take a point on the road.   Cheers!"
SoundersFC,30nyrl,BugSTi,2,Sun Mar 29 03:06:37 2015 UTC,"Ouch, yeah that may have been rough, but I still feel like we were handed multiple opportunities and we couldn't capitalize. Oh well a tie is better than nothing I suppose."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,thegodsarepleased,9,Sun Mar 29 03:29:37 2015 UTC,"It was a complete wash. We would have owned them with our starters, but we would have been owned without the red."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,Wineguy33,3,Sun Mar 29 03:10:04 2015 UTC,"I agree our starters would have ruined them but I still feel like we should have won, oh well silver lining is all our young guys got some great experience."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,MowwMoww,9,Sun Mar 29 03:28:23 2015 UTC,I don't know why you play Roldan on the wing. Should have had Kovar out there and subbed Roldan into the center of the pitch IMO.
SoundersFC,30nyrl,joylongdivision,3,Sun Mar 29 03:28:46 2015 UTC,agreed
SoundersFC,30nyrl,schmeebasaur,3,Sun Mar 29 03:46:39 2015 UTC,"Think it was a defensive call to try and deal with Castillo. Roldan has more of a tendency to stay at home compared to Kovar even though he doesn't offer as much going forward. Thought neither were particularly good tonight, but Roldan was a bit better than Kovar at pressing and closing down Dallas' attackers IMO."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,MarquettePharm,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:38:21 2015 UTC,Possibly yeah. My guess is they are just throwing him in to see how he performs and where he prefers in a game situation but I agree I would have rather had Kovar's (slight) experience edge.
SoundersFC,30nyrl,MarquettePharm,3,Sun Mar 29 05:16:29 2015 UTC,I've never been an Azira fan but he showed potential today. He still seems like he is flying by the seat of his pants though.
SoundersFC,30nyrl,cantbeassed,1 point,Sun Mar 29 04:46:10 2015 UTC,"I am slowly becoming a believer, he works his ass off and for that I will respect him even if some of his touches are questionable."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,tennisgoalie,-1,Sun Mar 29 05:17:23 2015 UTC,"The coaching strategies are flawed. There was essentially no offensive answer to Dallas's defense all game, and when we had opportunities we couldn't finish. We are placing too much faith on unproven players three games into the season, and the coaches have shown that they're unwilling to change course and adjust. I put this all on Sigi."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,cantbeassed,3,Sun Mar 29 04:31:19 2015 UTC,I think they put a lot on Barrett tonight and his miss plus him getting hurt put a lot of strain on the coaches but that definitely wasn't for lack of trying.
SoundersFC,30nyrl,MarquettePharm,1 point,Sun Mar 29 05:18:33 2015 UTC,"Agreed. But I'm just tired of the coaches not adjusting the formation or the strategy when the opposing defense knows to expect to intercept a lob down the middle. Either the coaches have a whole lot more patience than we do or they are too stubborn to try anything else.   Compare this season to last season. When a striker was out, they put Cooper in and changed the diamond formation to a 4-4-2. It worked against Vancouver and they switched back and forth throughout the first half of the season.   We have depth. We just need flexibility in our strategy. I'm not one to try something 50 times to get one goal. I'll be somebody who wants to experiment with things that have better odds depending on the situation. This was a game that should have been won purely on the circumstances and chances we had."
SoundersFC,30nyrl,cantbeassed,4,Sun Mar 29 05:27:57 2015 UTC,"That's also a season that saw us loose 5-0 to New England, and 4-1 to Vancouver in 2013.  Cooper is gone (CBA most likely) and 6 of our starters are out, what the fuck do you expect.  Starting 11 vs 10 men Dallas sure, easy win. B team vs a 10 man dallas only missing Perez? We should be glad to for a clean sheet and a road point."

We were paying Neagle like $44k at one point and he put up numbers. Granted we're now paying him around the $110-130k range, but he's still in the top 3-4 goal scorers. Kenny Cooper on the other hand is not worth the chunk of money."

SoundersFC,30f3w4,sherlocknessmonster,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:42:18 2015 UTC,"Montero was also a routine scorer of wonder goals and was among the best players in the league. I don't know how you can say he was inconsistent while he had a 10+ goal season every single season with Seattle, including two 15+ goal seasons.   Neagle is a career MLS player on a team way too good for him that squanders many an opportunity. He is local and so a lot of people sympathize with him because they feel like he is part of the northwest and that helps his fan perception a lot.   Kenny and Neagle aren't even comparable. One is a striker and the other is a player that fills holes whenever they present themselves. Cooper was has a vastly superior career and is far more skilled than Neagle. He had 3 goals in 13 apps filling in for Oba and Dempsey, which isn't bad at all.  This is what I am talking about when people on this sub rate Neagle so highly. It's just recency bias. They saw him score an MLS career high 9 goals and all of a sudden he's a great player for the team. He has only cracked 10+ goals once in his career. Even Barrett has a better record of scoring than Neagle."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,thegraduate,3,Fri Mar 27 03:39:23 2015 UTC,"Its the turnovers that do it for me.  If he could produce goals & assists at 2014 levels and cut down his turnovers by a decent amount, he would be a quality midfielder.  But for his position on THIS team, being able to hold the ball (and play defense....) should take priority over scoring goals"
SoundersFC,30f3w4,philwelch,1 point,Fri Mar 27 05:31:43 2015 UTC,"Are you really trying to compare  Montero's streakiness to Neagle flashes of brilliance...it's polar opposites; Montero is a brilliant player with moments of slumps and Neagle is a role player with moments of brilliance...case in point; he had two brilliant goals from distance last year, but a lot of sitters.   Most of his assists were no brainers; all you got to do is get it to Martins or Dempsey's feet.  Show me the highlight film of his brilliant passes/crosses...he easily leads the team in give aways from back heels."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,benfreilich,1 point,Fri Mar 27 07:39:58 2015 UTC,No. Read it again.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,benfreilich,1 point,Fri Mar 27 12:13:18 2015 UTC,If we were missing Clint or Obafemi I would rather have Cooper in there than Neagle.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,sherlocknessmonster,4,Fri Mar 27 05:39:28 2015 UTC,Seriously. It seems like for every goal he scores he misses 2 good opportunities.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,joylongdivision,1 point,Fri Mar 27 04:07:50 2015 UTC,YES!
SoundersFC,30f3w4,MowwMoww,0,Fri Apr 3 00:24:56 2015 UTC,"He definitely produces within the system with two MVPs up front making it easy... but would plugging Roldan into the lineup be a like for like, or a possible improvement.  Don't get me wrong, Neagle is a super solid roll player...but he has peaked and will be slowly transitioning to a supersub."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,sherlocknessmonster,3,Fri Mar 27 01:12:05 2015 UTC,"but would plugging Roldan into the lineup be a like for like, or a possible improvement.   What now? No chance. I don't really think Neagle is all that, but Roldan is brand new to the league, inexperienced, and has less than 45 minutes of MLS time under his belt. Maybe he'll end up being better than Lamar, but right now he's nowhere close, sorry."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,thegraduate,2,Fri Mar 27 01:37:58 2015 UTC,". Maybe he'll end up being better than Lamar, but right now he's nowhere close, sorry.   You have absolutely 0 way of knowing that. So far he has been fantastic in every match he has played. To say he isn't even close to as good as Lamar -- who he himself isn't very good -- is crazy talk."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,MowwMoww,0,Fri Mar 27 03:40:56 2015 UTC,"I never said immediately...but his upside looks good as well as his current skill...Kovar is another that is pushing.  The only thing carrying Neagle right now is his experience and grit...his skill set is limited and he often kills build-ups by his lack of ability to get it to the endline without turning it over and his passing ability is less than stellar.  I'm not hating on Neagle, as he does contribute, but he has some young talent nipping at his heals...wouldn't be surprise if his minutes start decreasing and Roldan's increase.  Just watch, Sigi will be pulling Neagle earlier and earlier as the season progresses (if our midfield/forwards stay healthy)."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,MowwMoww,2,Fri Mar 27 01:57:10 2015 UTC,He produced before we had Dempsey.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,ravegreener,0,Fri Mar 27 02:27:23 2015 UTC,Neagle had several goals before we had Dempsey and before the 2013 season had a total of 5 league goals in Seattle.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,MowwMoww,-1,Fri Mar 27 03:44:46 2015 UTC,"Very few goals are ""flukes."" He is a poacher and has only produced as a forward, which he only plays when someone is injured or with the national team.   I can definitely say he doesn't produce, because he doesn't. He had a good year last season but it's not like he is popping in 10 goals a year."
SoundersFC,30f3w4,fezdaddy,4,Fri Mar 27 03:27:14 2015 UTC,I'll enjoy watching our team fail to make MLS Cup   You will? That's pretty bad.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,metameh,-3,Fri Mar 27 01:57:07 2015 UTC,You're entitled to your opinion. I enjoy watching the team regardless of whether or not they win trophies. If you don't enjoy it then it's fine.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,soapbutt,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:27:52 2015 UTC,He has this problem of falling down and blaming everyone else. It's really annoying sometimes to see these flashes of brilliance muddled with what I view as about 80% effort compared to everyone else.
SoundersFC,30f3w4,CougFanDan,2,Fri Mar 27 02:20:16 2015 UTC,What? Neagle has tremendous work rate. Last season he stayed high to keep pressure on the back line when Dempsey/Martins drop into midfield and to pin back the opposition's fullback. This season he's been dropping back in defense like a more traditional wide midfielder.

SoundersFC,30hamr,Nekokeki,2,Fri Mar 27 17:14:48 2015 UTC,"Yes, just need to get hot at the right time. And, when I say hot I mean score 4 on the Galaxy hot. I don't think anyone feels comfort in our defense at this point."
SoundersFC,30hamr,pinkal_peaches,2,Fri Mar 27 17:28:24 2015 UTC,"Mearse looks like a great replacement to Yedlin, but if anything our defense has both aged and regressed with shoving Evans in there to learn. Our remaining starting lineup stays the same. I don't see how we've improved enough to be better than last year, a year we couldn't win in. So, no.   That's not too say I don't believe in our new GM, only that I believe he needs time. Maybe we bring in a new CB soon and Alonso comes back. At that point we could be the strongest team in the league. There's a lot to be excited about, but we also have to be realistic. We won't find consistency with our current back line. Maybe we can find form and pull an LA in the playoffs and win though. Well see, but our playoff history points to no.   Excited for the season and our future."
SoundersFC,30hamr,AreTheMadOnes,2,Fri Mar 27 19:40:39 2015 UTC,"As always, we should have a good shot at it. We will get into playoffs, just a matter of having consistent defense to push through the other Western Conference teams.  Can't really say how good of a shot we have until at least mid season though, too many questions. Both in the Sounders squad as well as the strength of other teams (imo, depends on how Galaxy and Dallas are doing)."

Their website's calendar is blank, at least on mobile, so maybe call ahead.  But if one is headed that far into Pioneer Square, I'd recommend saving a few blocks and going to Altstadt instead.

SoundersFC,30c64h,thekrnone,12,Thu Mar 26 04:07:52 2015 UTC,He's the new Yedlin in my opinion. He has strong Seattle roots and is determined to play on the first team.
SoundersFC,30c64h,benfreilich,3,Thu Mar 26 04:25:02 2015 UTC,"I'd also put Kovar into the conversation as ""next Yedlin."" He has looked phenomenal in pre-season, s2 play last week, and the friendly this week.  If he gets to play against Dallas in Pappa's spot I hope he can make a good case for himself as the LM back up"

Tickets were very cheap. I got two seats for just under $50 right behind the goal. Every game I've been to, I had to sit up very top, but last night I was close enough to see Oba's face!"
SoundersFC,30c64h,randymeeker,3,Thu Mar 26 05:30:40 2015 UTC,"Behind the goal seats are usually cheap though. GA seats are $20. It's the mid-field sideline seats that are the most expensive, and even those seats were ~$10 on seatgeek.com"
SoundersFC,30c64h,sherlocknessmonster,1 point,Thu Mar 26 15:57:31 2015 UTC,"It was poor compared to league games, but it was strong compared to past CCL matches.

SoundersFC,30c64h,mcvay206,4,Thu Mar 26 08:49:42 2015 UTC,"The crowd of a meaningless friendly is not indicative of what the crowd will be for the included CCL group match...in fact there should be more season ticket holders than in the past because the ticket is included and not an extra cost.

SoundersFC,30c64h,MowwMoww,3,Thu Mar 26 06:44:21 2015 UTC,"I completely agree.  A lot of my friends decided to skip it, because it was mid-week etc, but it was a great chance to see the young players, a team we'd normally never see except perhaps in CONCACAF, and also a chance to see the new white away kits in person (which I REALLY like..).  I thought it was a thoroughly entertaining evening, and I'm very, very glad I went."
SoundersFC,30c64h,Lactose_Intolerable,3,Thu Mar 26 12:51:50 2015 UTC,"Check out the S2 matches as well with him and Kovar playing together. It's great fun. He is a good player, now it's up to Sigi to see how those types of players can fit into the team because he hasn't really done that very well in the past. Though to be fair to him, this new age of young talent is new to MLS."
SoundersFC,30c64h,MowwMoww,3,Thu Mar 26 13:58:08 2015 UTC,"I liked Roldan's play well enough, but I absolutely loved watching Kovar on Tuesday. He was involved in just about every good chance we got and had an assist on both goals. (secondary assist on Neagle's)"

SoundersFC,309gvp,BanksKnowsBest,7,Wed Mar 25 15:47:16 2015 UTC,"Since I don't follow Tijuana, did they bring their starters and stars?  Or did they do what we did and give the bench a shot at some minutes?"
SoundersFC,309gvp,Sounders_Till_I_Die,3,Wed Mar 25 19:54:45 2015 UTC,They had a couple guys. The goalie was a starter and the log haired forward Moreno is a well used sub. I felt like he was the best player on the pitch last night
SoundersFC,309gvp,yungeva,1 point,Thu Mar 26 01:09:41 2015 UTC,And Brad Evans gave up another goal.  To a team missing 8 starters. Awesome.
SoundersFC,309gvp,mcvay206,14,Wed Mar 25 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"Though I agree that Evans DID have a poor touch during that first goal, I think if we're pointing fingers that it was Scott's bad/awkward pass to Evans that put him under immediate pressure.   I wish the highlights from this match would show more of the build up to that goal - I'm saying this all from memory."
SoundersFC,309gvp,01point21gigawatts,4,Wed Mar 25 18:10:30 2015 UTC,"Adding to this: I was actually disappointed/surprised that Sigi didn't play Marshall at all. I get that this game was a friendly, but I feel it would have been great experience for him and Evans to solidify their 'experimental' center-back partnership."
SoundersFC,309gvp,01point21gigawatts,6,Wed Mar 25 20:24:52 2015 UTC,Ya that wasn't on Brad. Pretty sure it was Pineda on that pass. Put Evans in a really bad spot. He could've dropped back a bit but he tried control that terrible pass
SoundersFC,309gvp,longlive289s,-1,Wed Mar 25 19:10:51 2015 UTC,"I agree it was a bad touch, but there is a reason everyone keeps pointing the blame."
SoundersFC,309gvp,mcvay206,4,Wed Mar 25 18:16:47 2015 UTC,Confirmation bias?
SoundersFC,309gvp,randymeeker,3,Wed Mar 25 20:18:56 2015 UTC,"No, because he isn't a good defender."
SoundersFC,309gvp,MowwMoww,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:57:21 2015 UTC,Please enlighten us.
SoundersFC,309gvp,randymeeker,2,Thu Mar 26 08:34:38 2015 UTC,What the damn games. It's ridiculous that people still defend him as far as his defending goes. He's a very good MLS level midfielder but he isn't even close to a capable defender.
SoundersFC,309gvp,MowwMoww,2,Thu Mar 26 13:51:04 2015 UTC,"Speaking as someone who transferred from midfield to defender in high school, it is hard and if you don't have it, you don't have it. The worst thing you can have as a CB is low confidence and after allowing all these goals I just don't think it's smart to keep Evans there."
SoundersFC,309gvp,jenomico,2,Thu Mar 26 20:55:05 2015 UTC,I agree with you and that's the biggest point I've been trying to make. Brad is a good player but he is worth a lot more to us in the midfield where he can contribute a lot.
SoundersFC,309gvp,MowwMoww,6,Thu Mar 26 21:10:35 2015 UTC,IMO he was given a really bad pass from scott. He wasn't able to save scott's mistake with a hard touch or tackling the offender but it wasn't explicitly his fault.
SoundersFC,309gvp,elsee,4,Wed Mar 25 18:40:55 2015 UTC,"You might be right. I wasn't able to make it in time for the game because of the traffic and my work schedule. So I am going off of the loss a week ago and Ross Fletcher's commentary last night. Speaking of which, him and hahnemann were a pretty hilarious combo last night on the radio. I swear to god they had to of had a few beers together before the game."
SoundersFC,309gvp,mcvay206,4,Wed Mar 25 18:51:12 2015 UTC,Evans is like our equivalent of Michael Bradley. An amazing player that just isn't placed in the right spot. He should be a central mid not a central defender.
SoundersFC,309gvp,benfreilich,3,Wed Mar 25 17:12:38 2015 UTC,"We have too many central mids, our team needs a strong good attacking mid IMO, I wish they would experiment with pappa in the center and bringing in Kovar on the wing."
SoundersFC,309gvp,elsee,10,Wed Mar 25 18:43:43 2015 UTC,We have too many central mids  I wish they would experiment with pappa in the center    Your confusing me...
SoundersFC,309gvp,CascadiaKid,2,Wed Mar 25 19:38:50 2015 UTC,"I should clarify. Our central mids play very defensively. For offense we rely heavily on the Dempsey and Martin's pairing to score, though I think we would have increased effectiveness with a dedicated attacking central midfielder that could feed Martins and Dempsey."
SoundersFC,309gvp,elsee,2,Wed Mar 25 20:20:31 2015 UTC,"Except Dempsey and Martins both regularly drop back and play a sort of attacking mid role, while most of our outside mids have played up top at some point and are perfectly capable of sliding in and acting as a third forward. I think that's why our central midfield plays so conservative most of the time. It lets the top four go all amoeba and mix things up at will."
SoundersFC,309gvp,Chuurp,5,Thu Mar 26 23:16:23 2015 UTC,"Well, when they played that 3-5-2 Pappa was the CAM and I felt like it didn't really click. I think he's better as wide mid cutting inside occasionally than a central mid stuck in that channel."
SoundersFC,309gvp,lightjedi5,3,Wed Mar 25 19:12:11 2015 UTC,Completely agree with you. I just don't know how much time were supposed to give him before he either A) becomes great at his new role or B) move him.
SoundersFC,309gvp,mcvay206,3,Wed Mar 25 17:28:46 2015 UTC,Or replace him.
SoundersFC,309gvp,hey_kool_aid,2,Wed Mar 25 18:05:14 2015 UTC,"Sigi said they'd re-evaluate after 6-7 games. 3 games isn't long enough to make a decision when you're using a player in a new position. Evans should get better as the season progresses, as Frei did last year."

SoundersFC,307itd,lashfield,3,Wed Mar 25 02:37:07 2015 UTC,"Starting lineup, fwiw - Starting 11: Perkins; Fisher, Evans, Scott, Remick; Roldan, Azira, Pineda, Kovar; Neagle, Martins.  bench: Frei, Lyon, Rose, Correa, Jones, Barrett, Ockford, Low, Mansaray.      Not our strongest of all possible line-ups. Too many starters injured or away. Not that the result of this match should be taken too seriously in any case."
SoundersFC,307itd,jaschac,2,Wed Mar 25 02:58:54 2015 UTC,"Second half changes: Mansaray for Neagle Also in: Barrett, Rose, and Correa (not sure yet who else went out, though you could make some guesses)  edit: Looks like Oba, Pineda and Azira went off"

SoundersFC,307w3a,MowwMoww,9,Wed Mar 25 04:23:11 2015 UTC,Impressed by a lot of the new guys. Roldan had a great run in the last few minutes. Kovars assist to Rose was perfect. Fisher was great as well. I thought we looked good tonight overall.
SoundersFC,307w3a,ajrcoyote,9,Wed Mar 25 04:30:58 2015 UTC,Kovar was all over that ball all game and never let up. Super impressed with him tonight.
SoundersFC,307w3a,MessiNeverDives,4,Wed Mar 25 05:48:12 2015 UTC,"Remick had some difficulty. Correa had some good runs. Ockford had one big defensive error, but seemed to calm down after."
SoundersFC,307w3a,PubLiic,8,Wed Mar 25 05:51:44 2015 UTC,"Neagle, Evans, and Martins looked kind of a step or two off all night. Fisher looked really good. Worried about our CB options if we don't trade."

SoundersFC,307w3a,WMDTHEALMIGHTY,3,Wed Mar 25 04:28:30 2015 UTC,It actually wasn't that bad going north I 5
SoundersFC,307w3a,the_bunny_the_bear,7,Wed Mar 25 05:15:46 2015 UTC,Why doesn't Andy Rose start more? He seems to be doing pretty well these last months.
SoundersFC,307w3a,steveotheguide,3,Wed Mar 25 04:28:09 2015 UTC,Start him over Azira?
SoundersFC,307w3a,the_bunny_the_bear,6,Wed Mar 25 04:48:11 2015 UTC,I would say so. Azira has never really impressed me. Andy looks better every time I see him play.
SoundersFC,307w3a,Bentstraw,8,Wed Mar 25 05:32:50 2015 UTC,"Rose never really seems like the same kind of player as Azira/Alonso.  Rose tends to get forward into the box a lot more than either of them ever do.  He plays more like an attacking mid than defending.  Subbing him in as an attacking option in games makes sense to me, but starting him over Gonzo isn't something that I would see happening."
SoundersFC,307w3a,adillen,5,Wed Mar 25 05:42:14 2015 UTC,Yeah I could see if Ozzie were back but pineda were out we'd start rose instead of azira.  Edit: auto correct forest like pineda's name
SoundersFC,307w3a,canucknuckles,4,Wed Mar 25 06:42:46 2015 UTC,"Exactly. Azira is a CDM, Rose is more a CM. Azira slots in for Ozzie, as Rose can for Pineda. However, Sigi has put Rose on the outside a few times already this season."
SoundersFC,307w3a,joylongdivision,2,Wed Mar 25 15:34:09 2015 UTC,"Rose never really seems like the same kind of player as Azira/Alonso.   Agreed. If anything he's a future starter instead of Gonzo, but I think a Pineda/Rose midfield would be too offensive. Azira isn't as good as Ozzie, but he's a more stable presence to sit in front of our swiss cheese backline, which can only be good."
SoundersFC,307w3a,ChvyVele,3,Wed Mar 25 16:26:38 2015 UTC,I think he ran into some injuries at the end of last season. From interviews with Sigi it sounds like there's competition between him and Azira though so I'm guessing he'll get some starts and a good amount of subs.
SoundersFC,307w3a,overruns,6,Wed Mar 25 05:37:30 2015 UTC,All I have to say is I was really impressed by our young guys. While yes some made some mistakes just about all had bright spots too. The future is bright for our club.

SoundersFC,30505j,modestthoughts,1 point,Tue Mar 24 15:43:55 2015 UTC,How different is Klinnsman's fitness training than the rest of MLS?  Is it more comparable to what EPL teams require?
SoundersFC,30505j,piffey,11,Tue Mar 24 17:17:02 2015 UTC,"I'd assume so, but don't have hard evidence to back it up. Mainly my comment is about the recurring trend of hamstring injures whenever players leave to train for national duty. It's either a big coincidence or a sign of overtraining. Since Klinnsman made comments about poor fitness in the squad after Chile, I would assume he's pushing and not getting the results he wants. Again, all speculation, but a lot of people share the same opinion."
SoundersFC,30505j,lashfield,1 point,Tue Mar 24 17:23:01 2015 UTC,4 liverpool players were called up to the English squad and then promptly were declared injured. I have a hard time believing that this is all other than playing hooky from work.

SoundersFC,301aya,CoobliusDoobler,3,Mon Mar 23 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"I speak against sneaking into the ECS section - 2 years ago we had over 200 people crammed into a section that was designed to hold about 150 (we had ECS tickets already) - it was loud it was rukusful but we were smashed in there like sardines because people kept coming in - getting tickets through ECS is one of the best ways to go - you get ""guaranteed"" protection by stadium staff and they are pretty decently priced - I have tickets for my wife and I and they were $28 a piece"
SoundersFC,301aya,ajg2345,2,Mon Mar 23 18:57:57 2015 UTC,"In the future you may want to consider buying your tickets through the ECS, who organizes a lot of our away travel: https://www.weareecs.com/away-travel.  There appears to be a tailgate starting at 4:30pm EDT in the visiting supporter parking area but no other details are available yet.

SoundersFC,301aya,enigmamr,1 point,Mon Mar 23 20:14:37 2015 UTC,"If you buy tickets through the home club, your seats will be where you bought them. You can sit there if you like I think, but obviously you'll be surrounded by home fans, which isn't always the best idea. You might be able to ""sneak"" into the ECS section once you're through the gate. All this knowledge is based on my experiences in Dallas, one of the most poorly run clubs, from an away fan stand point, in my opinion."
SoundersFC,301aya,Ckiser19,1 point,Mon Mar 23 18:10:04 2015 UTC,"Depending on the stadium the section reserved for ECS may be packed or may have some room. I'm not sure that there is generally a huge contingent who travel to Columbus so there may be room in that section. If you've already bought your ticket, you may want to contact the ticketing office to see if you can be re-seated in or near the away section. If that fails, contact ECS directly to see if they anticipate having crowding problems in the section at that match."

SoundersFC,2zqx02,Sunny_Bunny808,6,Sat Mar 21 01:30:36 2015 UTC,The new CBA requires a 28 man roster and there is speculation that a new signing will come soon. Parsemain is 27 so does not fit the S2 young developing category. Waiving him also frees up an international spot. Speculation is that FO needed to do this before the CBA was finalized and he secured a guaranteed contract for the year. A roster spot is now open so will it be filled now or left open to be filled later in the season?

SoundersFC,2zqymf,vuduwastaken,4,Fri Mar 20 22:41:28 2015 UTC,But please be prepared for many people to tell you it's a stupid idea.  I learned to not suggest anything on that board anymore.
SoundersFC,2zqymf,nikdahl,3,Sat Mar 21 05:07:16 2015 UTC,"Yep. I think /u/PappyPoobah may be hoping for new full-stadium chants though, which is pretty ambitious. It can take a while to get 35k people on board."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,atheocrat,8,Sat Mar 21 00:08:10 2015 UTC,It all starts there. Build it in ECS and the rest will follow if it's catchy.
SoundersFC,2zqymf,vuduwastaken,2,Sat Mar 21 00:08:50 2015 UTC,"It'd be cool if we had an opening song like Liverpool and Dortmund have with ""You'll never walk alone."" My big issue is that we have developed a reputation of being entitled fans with no culture or appreciation for the history of the game. These cheesy chants just strengthen that reputation. I'll definitely contribute to that forum, though!  We also need one each to make fun of Portland and Vancouver."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,hackberrydraw,5,Sat Mar 21 16:33:57 2015 UTC,"Just so you know, ECS opens every game with ""The bluest skies you've ever seen are in Seattle"" By Perry Como. Only downside being its a difficult song to actually sing well. The challenging part is to get the rest of the stadium involved with just about anything, so what we do extend to the rest of the fans needs to be pretty simple.   We also have a lot of Timbers specific chants, namely ""Build a Bonfire"" which also targets Vancouver but none that I know of specifically for Vancouver."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,Wineguy33,7,Sat Mar 21 18:29:57 2015 UTC,The redeeming quality of these chants are that the entire stadium participates. A lot of the chants are only/mostly sung by the GA.
SoundersFC,2zqymf,Crannogbruh,2,Sat Mar 21 02:10:35 2015 UTC,"They certainly are but I don't think fans are too thick to get new chants. The issue is nobody knowing the lyrics so we can't sing along when ECS gets going. The ones we have worked in the first year or two to get people into the game, but now we need some new ones that are a little more exciting."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,steerbell,17,Sat Mar 21 16:40:37 2015 UTC,"I hate the ""fight and win"" one. It makes me cringe because it's so cheesy."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,nerd_alert17,3,Fri Mar 20 22:37:07 2015 UTC,I like most of them but can we get a new one or two?
SoundersFC,2zqymf,dhcp138,7,Fri Mar 20 22:38:10 2015 UTC,"I could not agree more. Super cringey. And it just goes on and on. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if they did it once, with gusto, and moved on to something else, or at least picked up the pace of the chant. What I find strange is that the cadence we use for our full stadium chants is the same one most cities have historically used to taunt opposing teams. My theory is that it became normalized in Seattle due to the prevalence of the ""Ed-gar"" chant at M's games. I'm eager for some new chants."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,Crannogbruh,3,Sat Mar 21 01:32:38 2015 UTC,"does it make it even worse that the new kits have ""fight and win"" inscribed in the lining around the collar?"

That doesn't happen when you pick a complicated chant that most of the people in the stadium don't know well enough, nor does it happen if you keep picking different simple chants every game. Things like Seattle... Sounders... are simple and repetitive, and we've done them to death. And that's a good thing."

The times I've felt most proud singing these often repetitive chants was at the away Portland games. This microcosm of support for the Sounders in ""enemy territory"" came across so clear and strong. I'd like to think that in some ways the Sounders felt more at home than Portland would have wanted them to.   Mission Accomplished."
SoundersFC,2zqymf,randymeeker,1 point,Sat Mar 21 18:02:19 2015 UTC,I find myself wanting to start chants when I'm sitting in other sections but knowing I'd be the only one chanting. Then you just look like the guy who talks to himself.  I think it'd be great to get another supporter section going.

Unfortunately, the call and response type chants seem to be the only ones the whole stadium seems to participate in, and some of them (Fight and Win, Seattle Sounders Allez) took a few years to catch on. It would be nice if song cards were distributed throughout the stadium, but I'm sure that could get expensive for ECS."

SoundersFC,2zknr8,vuduwastaken,4,Thu Mar 19 11:07:41 2015 UTC,"Making all of these CB mistakes in one game could be what he needs to adapt to the position. Bad games happen, losses happen. The San Jose Goalkeeper had some great stops, there is still the whole season to go. I'm looking forward to seeing how Brad adapts in the next couple of games."
SoundersFC,2zknr8,pinkal_peaches,5,Thu Mar 19 21:15:11 2015 UTC,I feel bad bashing on Evans given the circumstances but Sigi has a habit of playing people out of position to the detriment of the team (and stubbornly sticking with it). I'm a little scared the other players will end up dropping back in support as the season progresses and our score sheet will suffer.
SoundersFC,2zknr8,andhelostthem,2,Thu Mar 19 16:05:10 2015 UTC,"Sigi has a habit of playing people out of position   Are you referring to the Shalrie Joseph game? If so, that was strictly due to limited options (due to injuries)."

SoundersFC,2zknr8,ravegreener,5,Sat Mar 21 00:47:02 2015 UTC,he played LM a couple of times that year.
SoundersFC,2zknr8,cantbeassed,1 point,Sat Mar 21 00:56:20 2015 UTC,"Anyways as you can see our options weren't ideal. Joseph had played as a forward before but acting more like a false 9, strong and holding. Unfortunately the strategy didn't work because he dropped too far into the midfield to collect. This allowed the timbers defense to apply pressure. Joseph would then check the ball back which completely killed the pace of our attack.   In retrospect your lineup looks very attractive. We've never played a 4-2-3-1 before though and had we tried and failed (likely), the criticism would have been as sharp."
SoundersFC,2zknr8,metameh,2,Sat Mar 21 07:23:13 2015 UTC,"Eh, Shalrie didn't have the mobility to hang with Portland's midfield that late int he season. Estrada should have been the starter, but if wishes were fishes."
SoundersFC,2zknr8,littlenicky174,2,Sat Mar 21 08:58:42 2015 UTC,"The real problem was that at the time, Dempsey was dead set on playing as an attacking, creating midfielder. He wanted to change his position which forced us into a narrow diamond midfield."

SoundersFC,2zknr8,banemaler,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:18:36 2015 UTC,"Sigi has a habit of playing people out of position   Its not Sigi; its MLS, particularly the salary cap, but the age of the league and nascent development system also play rolls. Even Bruce Arena does it. Zardes got the bulk of his rookie minutes on the wing after replacing Magee (both forwards); the only reason Rogers (winger) worked as a left back is because LA2 came into existence last year, which gave him a safe place to learn the position. Shalrie Joseph at forward aside, Sigi has made similar moves. What matters in MLS is that you get your best players on the field because the drop off from first team players to the bench is immense and because like-for-like replacements aren't being manufactured in the academies (yet).  As for Evans the CB, its too early to say he'll drag the team down. The sample size is too small, and his upside is too high. The entire reason I'm not bitching about letting Zavaleta go is because of Evans (consequently I was expecting defensive hiccups this year). With the age of our roster, we need to make moves to project continuity forward, and extending Evans' career is one of the best ways to do that."
SoundersFC,2zknr8,MalcolmXXY,9,Sat Mar 21 08:51:27 2015 UTC,"Really? Why do they have to probe about his loss? Ugh, seems unnecessary...   I Hope Brad can step up and learn from his mistakes, if not I hope we can find a new CB soon..."
SoundersFC,2zknr8,rav3nous,15,Thu Mar 19 15:13:49 2015 UTC,The dude is a professional athlete who had one of the worst games in his career. I would like to hear what his thought process was on it. He said everything right.

Yeah he definitely needed to step up about the game, he is the damn captain. I just wish they didn't start that shit with talking about his dead loved one. Stick to the game, if Brad wants to bring up off-field issues than let him."
SoundersFC,2zknr8,rav3nous,5,Thu Mar 19 23:25:17 2015 UTC,Ah I see. Well have an upvote for the misunderstanding. :)
SoundersFC,2zknr8,MalcolmXXY,10,Thu Mar 19 23:58:09 2015 UTC,His responses impressed me.  He is doing what he can to support the team.  I think if people have issues with him playing CB those complaints rest on the coach's desk.  The coach is supposed to do the best he can with the players he has and work with the front office to fill gaps.  Blaming Brad because he told the coach he was ready for the position is silly.  That call is made by the coach and the decision to play Brad at CB lies with the coach alone. -my 2 cents.
SoundersFC,2zknr8,rav3nous,-4,Thu Mar 19 18:20:15 2015 UTC,"Look at that, a professional athlete taking responsibility for his performance and not hiding behind a death in the family as an excuse.

SoundersFC,2zj48z,SvanirePerish,2,Thu Mar 19 05:08:13 2015 UTC,"We're not getting salary cap space from trading him away. His salary is basically league minimum. We do free up an international roster spot (although I think we already had one to spare - Traore and Apam out, Mears in last offseason). But from this tweet, it sounds to me like the Sounders are doing one of those charming ""trade to another MLS club without consulting the player first"" moves. In which case we'd be using Parsemain primarily for his trade value."

While we do have (probably) the best forwards in the league, we don't have a ton of depth at that position, which will be critical for Open Cup and Champions League games, as well as any international dates where we'd lose Dempsey and Pappa"
SoundersFC,2zj48z,IncogNeato1980,7,Thu Mar 19 13:55:57 2015 UTC,"Dempsey, Martins, Barrett, Neagle, Jones, Mansaray... quite a bit of depth in my opinion."
SoundersFC,2zj48z,Zorrino,2,Thu Mar 19 14:19:52 2015 UTC,"Keep in mind that Dempsey, Martins, and Neagle are all unlikely to play in US Open Cup matches, at least until the later rounds, so that cuts our depth in half right away. And what if someone is injured or fatigued?"
SoundersFC,2zj48z,stealth_sloth,2,Thu Mar 19 14:29:16 2015 UTC,"USOC not top priority, per Lagerway. Still have depth in case if injury."

To show solidarity, the rest of our starters also injure their hamstrings.  A guess at what we go to next (these are guesses; I'm not sure that, for example, Lowe would start ahead of Ockford):  Second-string: Perkins; Fisher, Scott, Lowe, Correa; Kovar, Azira, Roldan, Rose; Barrett, Cooper  A street preacher persuades that group to leave the world of professional soccer behind and move into a monastery.  So who might we field then?  Third-string: Lyon; ??, Ockford, ??, Remick; ??, ??, ??, ??; Parsemain, Jones  Ricardo Salazar gives every single one of those players a red card. Who is left?  Fourth-string: ??; ??, ??, ??, ??; ??, ??, ??, ??; Mansaray, ??.  And that's all 28 players on our senior-team roster."

SoundersFC,2zj48z,hira32,4,Sat Mar 21 14:50:52 2015 UTC,"we don't have a ton of depth at that position   This is simply not true. We've got the best strike partnership in the league, Dempsey and Martins. We've got Chad Barrett, who had 7 goals and an assist in under 10 games worth of minutes last year. We've got Victor Mansaray and Darwin Jones, both of whom are supposedly very promising homegrowns that we'd really like to find an opportunity to give minutes. If a series of injuries or awful performances forces us to go digging for depth at the position, Neagle is one of the more effective backup strikers in the league as well. Looking forward to next year, we'll hopefully be adding Jordan Morris to that list as well.  And we have Cooper and Parsemain. By MLS standards, we have a super-abundance of riches up top. With Dempsey and Martins obviously taking every minute they are healthy to play, we hardly have enough minutes to keep three more strikers sharp, much less the 5/6 we have now. We already had to let Okoli go really cheap (and he's doing decently well for New England Revolution), simply because we had too much depth in front of him and he wanted to move to somewhere he had a realistic chance at playing."
SoundersFC,2zj48z,thedanpal,4,Thu Mar 19 14:31:17 2015 UTC,Losing Cooper and Parsemain all at once would be devastating to me

SoundersFC,2zhnlm,bwc_28,2,Thu Mar 19 07:12:06 2015 UTC,"I think the idea that this friendly prepares us for anything is silly. It would be almost a full year before we would play a Mexican team in CCL and who knows what the team will look like then. The idea that it helps getting used to playing in midweek, I also do not buy since CCL isn't until August and we play midweek MLS games.   No, this is a cash grab by the FO. Since they charge regular prices for this and every STH (plus anyone who bought the half season plan with the friendly) had to pay for it, the team will clear $1M+.   I applaud the FO for not trying to cram a friendly in in summer when we have CCL, USOC and a Gold Cup. However, I would have a lot more respect for them if they just said ""We want to have a friendly because money. With everything going on this summer, now is the best time to have one but since most leagues are in the middle of their seasons we have to go with a geographically close opponent."""
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,PeteyNice,1 point,Thu Mar 19 15:19:31 2015 UTC,"Honestly, Tottenham was the beginning of the end. We had Barcelona, Manchester United, and Chelsea in consecutive years; three clubs that have won their national titles and even the Champions League in recent years. Tottenham is just an upper-mid-table Premier League club that hasn't won a title in decades. That's not world class anymore. At that rate, we'd be due to get Southampton or Stoke this year, and there's really no point in that when we can have a dress rehearsal for CCL."
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,philwelch,3,Fri Mar 20 04:41:01 2015 UTC,"Southampton or Stoke would both be better and bigger clubs than Tijuana. Any premier league side would be a much bigger opponent, even Leicester City. And Tottenham while not winning anything in quite a while is still a huge club. They have a huge club salary and some big names on their roster."
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,bwc_28,1 point,Fri Mar 20 04:59:20 2015 UTC,"I really don't care to see any mid-table Premier League clubs show up in Seattle. Guardiola's Barca was a once-in-a-generation team worth going out of your way to see, Chelsea showed up as defending European champions (and brought the European Cup with them), and Manchester United is one of the biggest clubs in the world. I'm not going to say that Spurs aren't a bigger club than Xolos, but they're barely big enough for me to give a shit about showing up that week, especially since that was a year after they sold Gareth Bale. Playing Xolos midweek in March is a nice little dress rehearsal for CCL and, in the worst case, gives Brad Evans a consequence-free extra 90 minutes to try and learn to be a central defender. So I'd rather have a friendly that's actually useful to the team rather than bringing in some random club I would recognize from TV."
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,philwelch,2,Fri Mar 20 07:13:10 2015 UTC,Not really...  Even us diehards have no interest.  This is evident by all the $12 tickets for sale on Stub Hub.  This is the worst friendly the STH have ever had to pay for.

However, GA tends to be a bit lower-energy during friendlies – a lot of season ticket holders usually sell their tickets for the friendly to people who just want to see the big-name team play (for more money), so I'd expect the crowd to be slightly quieter.  That said, my impression from hearing the reactions from other ECS members is that most of them are happier with this friendly than they have been with the bigger-name friendlies in the past."
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,Tasslehoff,4,Wed Mar 18 19:01:52 2015 UTC,my impression from hearing the reactions from other ECS members is that most of them are happier with this friendly than they have been with the bigger-name friendlies in the past.   I have not heard this from anyone. Most people I've talked with are annoyed with the lack of quality opponent in this year's friendly. Hard to get overly excited for a friendly with a foreign squad founded less than a decade ago...
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,bwc_28,5,Wed Mar 18 20:32:06 2015 UTC,"That's probably a difference in the audience we're listening to. I'm specifically listening to ECS members, and even more specifically, the subset of ECS who, like me, don't value big-name friendlies/consider them to be a distraction from the regular season. This is a very common opinion in the most vocal/organizing forces in ECS."
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,Tasslehoff,7,Wed Mar 18 20:45:16 2015 UTC,I am fine with the opponent but having it on a Tuesday is a big let down to me. I expect it will have a noticeable impact on the crowd. I'd be surprised if more than 20k show up.
SoundersFC,2zhnlm,PeteyNice,2,Wed Mar 18 21:55:48 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking this will not be over 40,000. At least this match might be more competitive, would have preferred a weekend game though.  Hope it gets us ready for CCL."

SoundersFC,2zdqjw,Militaria,9,Tue Mar 17 21:54:54 2015 UTC,"Ok, Brad you get ONE pass! Seriously, though. Bummer for him. I'm sure it made it harder to focus"
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,night_owl,-6,Tue Mar 17 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"I thought he already used his pass in the first game.   He was really lucky that none of his mistakes (especially the terrible clearances) led to a goal in the big week 1 win.   I know we are supposed to be patient with a guy playing a new position, but how many dropped points can we chalk up to patience before we start to worry?  Even if Evans does settle down and become solid (or at least serviceable) as a CB we are still brutally thin at the position—if Marshall were to get injured we might as well just install a turnstile at the top of the box.  I mean, we should have been able to give Evans the day off anyway so distractions wouldn't be an issue."
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,Militaria,3,Tue Mar 17 23:44:17 2015 UTC,"I agree--we're hurting at CB, and it kind of freaks me out"
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,ajrcoyote,2,Wed Mar 18 00:04:52 2015 UTC,Well that changes the perspective a little bit. It definitely does make me want to give him the benefit of the doubt when it comes to staying at CB. Everything else aside I am sorry for his loss! :/
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,MalcolmXXY,-3,Tue Mar 17 22:37:39 2015 UTC,"Okay...  But, look, while I obviously don't know the Evan's family dynamic, unless his grandmother raised him this probably isn't that big of a deal. He's an adult, grandparents don't live forever, and when you get to this age it's almost surprising they're still around.   If this was a devastating shock, that's one thing, and maybe he wouldn't have played, but he did, because he's a goddamn professional. I don't see how this is relevant to his unacceptable performance Saturday night.  """"No excuses, play like a champion"" -Vince Vaughn"" -Kobe Bryant"
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,bwc_28,3,Wed Mar 18 17:18:17 2015 UTC,What a cold and unsympathetic response...
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,randymeeker,3,Wed Mar 18 20:33:56 2015 UTC,"You probably should have stopped after ""I obviously don't know the Evans family dynamic""."
SoundersFC,2zdqjw,Sparta1osu,-1,Wed Mar 18 20:54:42 2015 UTC,"Assuming this is accurate while it provides some excuses for Brad it doesn't remove fault from the coaching and if anything makes it worse.  If the coaches knew the situation they surely would have been watching closely for any sign that things weren't right and adjusted...the signs were early and often and no adjustments were made (ostrich with it's head in the sand analogy goes here).  The same has to be said for Evans, our captain.  As the captain it's his job to do what's best for the team and to lead.  He did neither of those.  Condolences for his loss but it's not an excuse for the performance from Brad or the coaching staff.  I desperately hope the CB experiment is over."
SoundersFC,2zey0h,CougFanDan,5,Wed Mar 18 00:31:47 2015 UTC,Garth also discussed in his interview that they're going to make some strategic moves still to come and I think Cooper is that move.
SoundersFC,2zey0h,MowwMoww,2,Wed Mar 18 09:04:07 2015 UTC,"This doesn't surprise me, as I've been saying for a while now that we can get much better value from the funds locked in his contract. Don't get me wrong, he gives 100% and he's a capable player, but he'll never be a starter here and we're paying him starter money. We need to move on from his contract."

SoundersFC,2zey0h,badkarma765,7,Wed Mar 18 00:32:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's a great player that just doesn't have a clear position on our team.  By all accounts an incredibly nice/caring person as well.  I would love to see him go to another good team that could actually utilize him.  It doesn't make sense to have a bench player sucking up $260,000 a year... that's enough for a worthy centerback."

SoundersFC,2z9hhv,th12teen,-10,Mon Mar 16 19:19:58 2015 UTC,Turf? How about the FIFA standard grass surface that was legally required in order for the Clink to receive public funding? Has everyone forgotten that the Clink was illegally funded as soon as they decided to completely ignore that part of the bargain?
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,peterquest,5,Mon Mar 16 20:01:49 2015 UTC,can you cite sources please?

Given that the WSPSA had the authority to do so, they did."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,BugSTi,10,Mon Mar 16 20:21:16 2015 UTC,"Furthermore, it was given a 2 star rating in 2012 after it was replaced, which is the highest FIFA rating.  http://old.seattletimes.com/html/soundersfcblog/2018140224_centurylink_turf_passes_fifa_2.html"
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,doppelganger47,1 point,Mon Mar 16 20:24:19 2015 UTC,"From the article you linked: ""Last year, the turf failed 2-Star testing, meaning it was a 1-Star surface. The language on FIFA's website describes a 1-Star surface as ""the demanding standard for amateur and grassroots football."" Hardly a professional standard.""  I'd love to know how often this is tested and where we're at now. I know the plan is to replace it next year, but I have doubts over whether it passes muster now (let alone by the end of this season). If we're not maintaining the field standards, it stands to reason that we're missing out on opportunities to host international matches. This, in my opinion, directly would contradict the language of the referendum. This also makes me question another element of this Tuesday's friendly: whether top clubs are even willing to come until the surface is replaced?"
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,th12teen,-3,Sun Mar 22 17:57:29 2015 UTC,"They can approve it all they want, but the public approved a different deal. By violating the terms of that deal, they invalidated the legality of their public funding. Look at this way: You're buying a prefab  house. The manufacturer offers counters in granite and slate tops. You know that formica would be cheaper, but it isn't an option, so you go with the granite. The company then builds your house and delivers it, at which time you find your kitchen is covered in formica. You paid for granite, formica wasn't an option, and nobody bothered to ask if you were ok with the change. You say 'hey, I ordered and paid for granite counters... but this is formica!?' their reply is, 'it is ok, we checked and the kitchen is still totally up to code.' Um, well yeah, I guess it is. It is certainly an acceptable counter top finish, it just isn't the one you paid for, isn't the one you wanted, and doesn't offer the same quality as what you actually ordered. So, you get your money refunded right? No... you don't."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,sp_the_ghost,4,Mon Mar 16 20:45:18 2015 UTC,"Your analogy misses the part where they had the legal authority to make the decision. They didn't do anything illegal, they just did something you don't agree with."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,th12teen,-3,Mon Mar 16 22:47:08 2015 UTC,Then why did they need a referendum for public approval to receive funding?
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,night_owl,6,Mon Mar 16 23:00:43 2015 UTC,"Your assertion above is not accurate, and that link/source (or at least the original source that the wiki article uses) don't support it either: link  I've actually read the entire referendum looking for this detail about the grass requirement and it simply isn't there. the official language of the ref. as it was voted on states that all final decisions regarding the facility and the surface are to be made by the WA State Public Stadium Authority in consultation with the primary tenant (First and Goal, Inc.), and it was.   Yes, during the campaign much of the talk was about natural grass, but it isn't in the wording of the actual law that was passed, the ref. only says ""an open-air stadium suitable for NFL football and for Olympic and World Cup soccer."" and all specifics below that are the jurisdiction of WSPSA.  At the time the ref. was written FIFA did not approve any artificial surfaces, so it was implied that the stadium would have to be grass to meet the World Cup requirement, but since FIFA decided to approve FieldTurf before the stadium was built it became a legit option to consider. The WSPSA only approved FieldTurf with the provision that it could be converted to real grass turf for major events, subject to requirements of FIFA or US Soccer Federation.   They followed the letter of the law very closely here, and nothing in the bargain has been ignored or done illegally.   Yes, they promoted it is a natural grass stadium during the campaign, but they never completely ruled out artificial turf at any time. Things change and when artificial turf later became a legit option they took it."

That is exactly what I was saying. You just agreed with my analogy completely. The referendum required that the stadium meet the World Cup requirement, which meant that a grass surface was absolutely required. The fact that the requirements changed does not excuse the fact that the original agreement has not been met. Much like when someone is imprisoned for breaking a law, then the act they committed is decriminalized... they don't just get a free pass because they still knowingly violated the rules at the time.   The real point here is that PSA does not have the best interests of the public, or soccer in mind. They care about the bottom line and football. They certainly don't care about following through with their promises. I hope the MLS mandates grass surface(it won't sadly) forcing PSA to follow through with their stated intent to maintain MLS eligible."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,night_owl,4,Mon Mar 16 22:37:33 2015 UTC,"<sigh>   No, I'm not agreeing with you, I'm disagreeing on all points.

The fact that the requirements changed does not excuse the fact that the original agreement has not been met.    The original agreement has been met: comply with FIFA standards. For the last time: the agreement never implicitly stated grass was necessary. If FIFA standards change, then it doesn't matter, comply with the new FIFA standards.   We are not talking about criminal law violations and your prison analogy is not applicable, this has nothing to do with people convicted of crimes. No one has ever knowingly violated rules at any time.   Your logic is so flawed and nonsensical that it does not merit further discussion. Don't even reply to this comment, this is done.

SoundersFC,2z9hhv,Dsharn,6,Tue Mar 17 00:27:50 2015 UTC,"It's easy to think of this as a Sounders issue, but its really bigger than that. With a nicer turf or a grass option, Clink immediately becomes a contender to host international tournaments (Gold Cup, World Cup), international friendlies, qualifiers, etc. Right now, Seattle tends to get passed over for those big matches due to turf (among other issues)."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,stealth_sloth,1 point,Tue Mar 17 03:05:05 2015 UTC,That's fair. I think that's a legitimate complaint for sure. I also think we (Hawks and Sounders) have a great stadium and relationship but being a football player I know I much prefered turf and I doubt it will change as long as the Seahawks prefer it. Hopefully with regular replacement it becomes a happy medium and maybe higher quality newer artificial turfs will keep the Clink in the running for major events.
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,pal25,1 point,Tue Mar 17 17:10:16 2015 UTC,"Well, being a soccer player, I also much prefer turf. But that probably has to do with the fact that I never played on a professional quality grass field (which CLink would hardly have after two teams ground the grass into oblivion)."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,francostine,1 point,Wed Mar 18 21:41:55 2015 UTC,This is a good point. Football and soccer simultaneously being played on the grass in a less than ideal environment for grass doesn't sound like a viable option.
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,mraybern,3,Wed Mar 18 23:15:22 2015 UTC,"FIFA's ratings are somewhat generous, and not all two-star surfaces are identical. The turf packs down, so after a couple years the surface is significantly harder. Balls bounce higher and roll faster and further. Some players also complain that it feels more like running on concrete than asphalt; more stress and slower recovery the next day. Older turf also can look uglier aesthetically, which pisses off some people who want the stadium to look good on national broadcasts.  With that said - nobody is saying the Sounders should leave CLink just because the turf grows a little old. Some people are already very unhappy that we're playing on artificial turf instead of natural grass, and having old artificial turf is the straw that breaks the camel's back for them. Most people are pretty happy with the stadium overall, even with old artificial turf."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,immortaldual,3,Tue Mar 17 01:33:29 2015 UTC,"Nailed it. Sure, a soccer-specific stadium would be cool, but an unnecessary expense. CLF is a great stadium, but it'd be nice for the Sounders to have as much say as the Seahawks on the field surface"
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,MowwMoww,2,Tue Mar 17 02:06:58 2015 UTC,I feel like we get passed over a lot for international matches because other teams typically don't want to play on turf.

I've always considered it highly unlikely, though - but I'm a bit biased because I'd rather not head to the suburbs for a match"
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,sp_the_ghost,12,Mon Mar 16 19:30:04 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the Clink at all for matches. I know it sucks at times to have to share with the hawks, but the stadium is huge and the location is great."
SoundersFC,2z9hhv,Metallica_Sucks,11,Mon Mar 16 20:28:18 2015 UTC,I just can't imagine we would ever get a LARGER stadium specifically for soccer. I can't see it happening. At least not in Seattle. Sharing with the hawks ensures that we can cram in upwards of 60k+ fans on big matches. We would never get so lucky with a dedicated soccer stadium.
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,MowwMoww,7,Mon Mar 16 10:41:24 2015 UTC,"Firstly, this is a great analysis and I thank you for putting it together. I was debating editing together all of Evans' touches in this match to display what you've provided via his passing stats. He's intelligent on the ball and makes great passes. Out of curiosity do you have duels won % somewhere? I'd like to see this for Evans (particularly aerial duels won).   However, I would like to argue against your statement that Evans was directly responsible for every goal. Let's remove the second goal from the discussion. I think it's very obvious that he was at fault for that one.  For the first goal, I agree he should have headed the ball away, but Mears let Wondo creep up unmarked behind Evans. Mears was marking Wondo and let his man roam free immediately when the cross came him. I would say that the responsibility is 50/50. Defenders make mistakes at times and good defenses minimize the effect of those mistakes by covering for each other.  For the third goal, I think it's arguable at best that he was at fault. Pappa was battling for the ball and let his man run free. Pineda was standing there and did not chase after the give and go. Evans was the only person that attempted to defend after the team was beaten and did in fact make it back. He unfortunately lost his footing after being sold on an excellent fake by Innocent Emeghara.   I think Evans needs to be on the pitch period. My guess is you'd like to see him replace Neagle and Scott back at CB. I think that since this is the second game of the season, the team is still gelling together, he should have another chance at the CB role. Neagle is too valuable in the attack in my opinion."

Defenders make mistakes at times and good defenses minimize the effect of those mistakes by covering for each other.   I just don't see how that is anybody else's fault other than Evans'. He is marking Wondo, not Mears. He has the near post and Mears has the far post. If anything Marshall is the one doing nothing, not Mears. If we ignore the mistake that leads to the chance being created then we could just as easily blame Stefan Frei every single goal because he didn't stop the final shot. Mears is marking the middle of the box, Evans is on Wondo, and Marshall has the near part of the box. Evans completely whiffs on a header to clear the ball and it falls to the feet of Wondo directly behind him and Mears has to react.    For the third goal, I think it's arguable at best that he was at fault. Pappa was battling for the ball and let his man run free. Pineda was standing there and did not chase after the give and go. Evans was the only person that attempted to defend after the team was beaten and did in fact make it back. He unfortunately lost his footing after being sold on an excellent fake by Innocent Emeghara.   I don't think any of these are arguable at all. You could argue that the entire defense in the first goal was at fault, but that would be completely ignoring the missed wide open header from Evans that created the chance in the first place.   As for the second goal, you may be right, if we lived in a fantasy world in which attacking midfielders played multiple positions including defense. Unfortunately that isn't the case and Pappa and Pineda were already well into the defensive zone, well beyond their responsibilities.   Pineda could have done more but it wouldn't have done much. He would have had to turn around and make a dead sprint and he isn't going to catch Emeghara. Pappa was stuck between two Sounders players so he isn't going to be doing anything either. Brad is 3 yards back and just sits there. His only role in that situation was to make sure nobody is played into the box and to play the role of a stopper. Instead he sits there watching the ball, sits there as it passes him, and then reacts way too late. Then he didn't position himself correctly because he knew he made a huge mistake and was diving for a desperation block which made things even worse. There was no reason for him to have been in that position with two Sounders players already there. He's 3 or 4 yards too far up the field.   I think that since this is the second game of the season, the team is still gelling together, he should have another chance at the CB role   Normally I would agree, but this is 9 out of 11 players that played dozens of matches together last season. Even when Oba was asked about increasing chemistry with his teammates he said that they've had the chemistry since he got there. There is only so much that teams can progress chemistry-wise.   Edit: And no stats on aerial duels won. Opta doesn't seem to post many of their stats."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Mar 16 14:12:51 2015 UTC,"He is marking Wondo, not Mears   I don't see this at all. Evans pushes towards the post (which is what he is supposed to do). Then, he sees the cross is curving back towards the 18 and tries to run and get it. Mears is standing less than a yard away from Wondo when the cross comes in and doesn't track him.  Regarding the third call, I see your point about positioning. I'm just saying other players were fucking up too. Specifically, Pappa stopped running."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,ravegreener,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:02:15 2015 UTC,"The issue has nothing to do with who is marking whom, it has to do with a rookie level header that was completely missed by an MLS vet."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,lollergater,5,Mon Mar 16 15:05:45 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing. If you are a defender and you have no one behind you (Mears) and you have an obvious goal scorer in front of you, you go cover him.  Evans checks back to Mears to make sure he's got Wondo before he attempts the header. Yes, he should have made sure he gets to the header, but Mears should have followed his mark.  Goal three was a total defensive breakdown. that I already wrote about in another thread, so I'm not going to go over it again. There are multiple players ball watching on it, and really Evans i the only one who even tries to stop it.  I'm not being an Evans apologizer, but it's way too easy to let the rest of the defense off the hook. Mears should have been better on defense. Pineda should have been better on defense. Leo should have been better on defense. Azira should have stayed put in central midfield more, instead of drifting wide and forward, thus leaving the center of the park open."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,stealth_sloth,3,Mon Mar 16 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"That's what I see here.  Evan's looked back and saw Mears marking the man, and moved towards the near post.  Mears let his man drift.  If anything, I would chalk this up to miscommunication amongst the back line about responsibilities.  I think that this is part of new people working together and is easily addressed by the defensive coaching staff.  If this were the only defensive lapse in the game, we would have chalked it up to ""unlucky, but let's fix it and move on""."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Mar 16 19:53:53 2015 UTC,"There was certainly miscommunication about who was marking Wondo (and to Wondo's credit, he's made a whole career on creating that sort of miscommunication and finding the seams).  But that doesn't change the fact that Evans committed to going for that clearance header inside the 18-yard box, then failed to get a touch on it. Thinking he could head that one clear was an error in judgement of the path of the ball or his own capabilities, an error solely by Evans. He effectively took himself out of the rest of the play.  Regardless of whether Evans or Mears should have been marking Wondo (and none of us fans know that - we don't know what Frei was yelling, what Mears or Evans were saying, what pre-game instructions they had), Evans did make a judgement error that did result in a goal."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,newbachu,2,Tue Mar 17 03:52:56 2015 UTC,"Aha, I see. I put more weight on the fact of the marking than on the header. I think he probably shouldn't have jumped for it. I don't think he physically could have gotten there. But in that case the situation is roughly the same where he is unmarked (by Mears) at the top of the box. I guess that's where I am coming from.  My guess is he has the added pressure of being the last guy and therefore took a chance on something that he shouldn't have. Hopefully he'll learn from this situation. As I've said before I don't think we should write him off yet."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Mar 16 15:15:02 2015 UTC,If there's a guy behind you and you go up for a header you damn well best get it.  I'm not looking at the play right now but if memory serves me Mears was well behind Wondo when that ball goes in the air.  Even if Mears gets to Wondo in time he's still on the wrong side of the player to give any sort of proper defense.

SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,3,Tue Mar 17 00:33:48 2015 UTC,"Given our lack of depth at CB, I think it boils down to Neagle vs Scott.  If we move Evans to midfield, we drop Neagle and add Scott at CB.  I'm not sure if this is a net upgrade for us.  After losing Traore and Anibaba we're incredibly thin at CB."

SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Mar 16 21:11:51 2015 UTC,"Watching the third goal, I think it's ridiculous how compact our CB's are playing. Pineda, Pappa, Marshall and Evens are all standing close enough to smell each other. Free space is bad for defense. All four of them have both feet on the ground and have committed to the passer instead of the runner.  This sets up Evans for the failed tackle. His hips were facing the goal and he under committed (by that I mean he should have outright applied a tackle, a skill a seasoned CB will have, instead of attempting to keep his feet and slipping as a result.) If he tackles hips out, his vision on the ball is better and he controls his slide instead of slipping during recovery. Overall I don't think Evans is the the only player at fault, he was just the most visible.  Not leaving anyone out, Mears was slow to react and had a nice little jog into the penalty box. Maybe his hammy was flaring at this point? I suppose there isn't much he could have done from behind.  I feel bad for Frei. He didn't know anything about the three goals and this will kill show in his stats."

SoundersFC,2z7xa8,metameh,2,Mon Mar 16 17:41:54 2015 UTC,"Schmetzer even said so during this post-match interview.  Lamar had a poor game, and the stats show it."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,stealth_sloth,2,Mon Mar 16 19:55:33 2015 UTC,"Nice work! Its always good to see this kind of stuff.  Obafemi Martins unsuccessful passes  I'm picking on Oba because he was the one that stuck out to me, but others were guilty of the same kind of Two things I want to point out here: 6/7 were in the middle third, 3/7 were in the vicinity of the center of the pitch (a semi-dangerous spot to lose the ball). Maybe it was the spacing, more than the passing that was off (San Jose/Dom Kinnear have been known to use more physicality when it comes to defensive positioning), but those are passes that should be completed - often times there was space to attack, but simple, routine passes like this weren't hitting their targets in stride; too often the receiver had  Lamar Neagle's unsuccessful passes deserve special mention. Last season, the Amoeba worked because Neagle spent so much time as an ad hoc third forward, which plays to his strengths because he's, well, a forward. His passing isn't going to alleviate pressure, especially so close to goal. I don't think his passes would have been as dire against team that had a deeper line of confrontation (San Jose started their press at the border of the midfield third, Seattle starts theirs around the half-way line). And while he's got tremendous hustle and is decent at occupying space, he only had two recoveries and one tackle. He needs to stay higher to be dangerous, but that exposes our flank without Ozzie to do what only a honey badger can. When people talk about Ozzie provided a shield so that Evans can grow into the position, I think they're only half right. Ozzie's East-West roaming allows Neagle and Pappa to cheat up field and power the hydra.  Speaking of defensive actions, Seattle and San Jose went, by my quick count,  1:1 in recoveries with 61 apiece. This is one of the reasons why I say it was a ugly game - a huge part of our success has been picking up the loose balls or forcing the opposing attack to reset (and a huge part of this is in no doubt due to Alonso). This is a fun to watch, high tempo game when coupled with scoring threats like Clint and Oba, but San Jose went toe-to-toe with us defensively, in our house no less. Even if we had control of the ball, we weren't setting the tempo. That's why so many people are at odds when it comes to who was a better team on the day."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,cantbeassed,1 point,Wed Mar 18 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"Oba definitely stuck out to me this match. He found himself on the left wing frequently for some reason and his passing was pretty bad. His passing isn't necessarily great consistently, but this match stood out in particular."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,philwelch,4,Wed Mar 18 07:30:08 2015 UTC,"% of individual passes completed isn't being calculated correctly. It looks like you are using (1 - incomplete/complete), where what you actually want is (complete / (incomplete + complete)).  E.g., Evans with 50 successful and 19 unsuccessful should be 79% rather than 74%; Neagle with 22 complete and 11 incomplete should be 67% complete rather than 50%."

SoundersFC,2z7xa8,dudukakapeepeeshire,1 point,Mon Mar 16 10:42:41 2015 UTC,"Well also, don't forget that they were in a new formation, they didn't use the tried/true 4/4/2 that they did against NE, they did a 4/1/3/2.  Then later on, as they went down they moved Mears up into a 3/2/3/2. You can see him talk about it in the interview. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHr86gdwkMs  Yes, Evans had some blunders. But he was ALWAYS going to have them. You can't expect any player to move into a new position and work out without any problems. He needs these types of games in order to get into a place where he's performing solidly. At this point he still has an advantage over bringing in someone else.   So no, I don't think it's the end of the Evans as CB experiment because the loss wasn't 100% on him. Why, even being down a man could we not get anything through the midfield? Why were Dempsey/Martains seeing so little of the ball? Those are all not Evans' fault, but were equally problematic. There are points where a lot of the attacking MF players just sorta give up on defending (See Pineda on the third goal). That's something they have to work on in the absence of Alonso, who's absence is still easily felt.   The new formation likely just put extra pressure on a weaker point for us. SJ Capitalized on it as they are a good team (despite the rankings).   All that said, who cares. We were never gonna win every game. I'm not saying a loss is good, but look at it this way, it wasn't a loss to LA, or Portland, or Vancouver, or Salt lake. It was a loss to SJ, who likely won't be a threat to us later on. Not getting a point sucks, but Not getting a point against any of the above teams, sucks more. Also, we're still missing one of our DPs, so:  Tl/DR - It's not just an Evans thing, and It's not that big of a deal, and this isn't even our final form."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,0,Mon Mar 16 17:10:23 2015 UTC,"I agree about Neagle. If you look at the team's combination play, Neagle sticks out like a sore thumb with his hero crosses to nowhere and his pot shots. Playing Pappa and Evans on the wings leads to another problem, though; now you have classical wingers instead of inverted wingers, and as good as Pappa is, you don't want to see him whipping in crosses to Obafemi because Obafemi is 5'9"". You want to see Pappa on the right cutting inside and contributing to combination play. Does this put Evans on the left wing then? I think the best opportunity would have been for Evans to take over for Yedlin at right back and to buy a centerback, but Mears is an upgrade over Evans at that position so I think Evans best spot might be on the bench next to Neagle."
SoundersFC,2z7xa8,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Mar 16 14:34:54 2015 UTC,"Evans has to start. He's the captain for a reason over Dempsey. He's a veteran of the team, he has excellent insight into the game, and he allows us to play more Total Football.   Let's dig into the midfield a bit. Looking at goals and assists in MLS (in appearances):   Pappa: 6/5 in 11(3) Evans: 0/5 in 8(3) Neagle: 9/9 in 14(1)   I think we all agree that Pineda and Alonso (or Azira as CDM) need to be on the pitch for reasons other than attack. Neagle creates. Plain and simple. He puts up huge numbers that we need in order to win games. He had the 3rd most goals and 3rd most assists for us last season. He also plays with a passion and drive which I think fires up other players.  The reason that we did so well last year is that Hydra was a real threat. The attack was coming from everywhere. Evans helps us get there with his vision and ability to slot into any position. CB is a challenge for him, but I think his mistakes at this point are excusable.

SoundersFC,2z7xa8,philwelch,4,Mon Mar 16 14:58:09 2015 UTC,"If you want to see Total Football, Neagle's the last player you want on the pitch. His play is completely one-dimensional and runs counter to every bit of combination play that you see. He racks up decent goal/assist numbers because occasionally one of his crosses or potshots will work, but he loses possession and takes scoring chances away from the team as a whole where Evans or Pappa might make a safer option that keeps the opportunity going.  If Evans isn't good enough to start then maybe he shouldn't be the captain. He single-handedly lost us 3 points in two games at centerback. He isn't some kid who can be retrained into a new position; he's a 29 year old man and an MLS veteran with zero experience at one of the most crucial positions on the pitch, and he's starting there for the defending Supporters Shield champions. That's indefensible."

We won comfortably and none of his copious mistakes caused a catastrophe so everything was hunky-dory, but this week it showed how tenuous our situation really is with him at CB, and we were lucky nothing bad  happened last week as well.    How long can we afford to drop points waiting and hoping that he'll settle in and stop making grievous errors?  I'm not panicked yet, but I'm not expecting an easy road to the playoffs/Supporter's Shield even under the best of circumstances.   I've actually been a strong advocate of Evans over the years (I was suggesting he should get a call-up for the USA as a midfielder a long time before it happened and /r/MLS gave me a lot of shit for it), but I think this is really bad experiment. Evans is great as a utility guy who can play a lot of spots, and he's never looked downright bad until he tried CB.

SoundersFC,2z3an6,MowwMoww,13,Tue Mar 17 18:53:13 2015 UTC,"I'll support Brad Evans all day while he is in midfield. Unfortunately I won't support a player playing way out of his element. He is at CB because he told the coaches he could do it. It is his job to understand his limits and currently the role is way beyond his limit.   This isn't remotely similar to the Lovren PK. That's one shot in an important match after a very long match has been played. Evans looked like a high school player out there today.   Evans is responsible for telling Sigi when he is not fit for a role. I know he and everyone else likes to think of Brad as a multi-tool type player, but this role isn't for him. He is better than Neagle and would be much better fit in the midfield and bringing in a real center back."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,gear7,6,Sun Mar 15 04:23:00 2015 UTC,If Brad starts at CB this will continue to happen. It might not always be 3 goals but he will put the team in dangerous positions.
SoundersFC,2z3an6,JamieKThomas,6,Sun Mar 15 07:00:58 2015 UTC,Do you not think it's slightly too early to throw him under the bus?   1 bad performance and people are calling for him to be removed from the position. It seems like such a knee jerk reaction.
SoundersFC,2z3an6,MowwMoww,14,Sun Mar 15 10:51:19 2015 UTC,"This isn't preseason, this is professional soccer. He single handedly cost a team a game. He isn't a defender. Experiments in regular season can't happen for a team that has the highest aspirations."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,cascade7,4,Sun Mar 15 17:46:18 2015 UTC,Yup. Plus now every other team in the league knows exactly how to exploit the backline. It's only going to get worse if nothing is done
SoundersFC,2z3an6,JamieKThomas,2,Sun Mar 15 18:49:56 2015 UTC,"""Experiments in regular season can't happen for a team that has the highest aspirations.""   I couldn't disagree more, how is the team meant to adapt if they don't experiment in league games?"
SoundersFC,2z3an6,MowwMoww,2,Sun Mar 15 19:39:23 2015 UTC,Experimenting with switching Pappa and Neagle from right and left respectively is one thing. Experimenting by moving Mears to wing back and going to 3 at the back when down a goal in the 85th minute is one thing.  Playing a career midfielder at center back on a team that is playing CCL soccer is not an acceptable level of experimentation. If you've watched the interviews you'd know that the decision was effectively made by Brad because he thinks he is capable on defense and we clearly saw he isn't. He has had two matches against real MLS competition at center back and one match he was average in and the other he was directly at fault for 3 goals.  There is simply no defending it. You may like Brad and I may like Brad but don't be delusional. He isn't a center back and shouldn't be coddled because you like him.
SoundersFC,2z3an6,JamieKThomas,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:42:52 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that a player should be judged off of 1 bad game? If every football experiment was judged of a 90 minute period then nothing would get done. Brad had a terrible game, undeniably bad, but to completely give up on a full pre seasons worth of work is ridiculous.  You see position transitions at a top level all over the world, Mascherano moved from midfield to centre back for Barcelona and was successful.   All I ask is you don't judge Brad off of 2 games, adapting to a new position takes time and Brad will learn a lot from the last game. I can't believe you think I am deluded for simply giving Evans more than 180 minutes worth of a chance."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,philwelch,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:49:31 2015 UTC,"A Mascherano-style defensive midfielder and a Barcelona-style centerback aren't too much different from each other. Repurposing DM's as defenders in passing-centric teams is something that goes back to Marcelo Bielsa. Brad is more of a James Milner-style utility player, and you'd never put Milner at centerback."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,MowwMoww,0,Sun Mar 15 20:35:38 2015 UTC,"Do you really think that a player should be judged off of 1 bad game?   Yes, yes I do. In this case, yes.   If every football experiment was judged of a 90 minute period then nothing would get done   Except this isn't just an experiment, it is a complete position change that led to the FO not signing any central defenders despite there being no capable starters.   but to completely give up on a full pre seasons worth of work is ridiculous.   Pre-season is not even relevant. There is a reason why all of the coaches say pre-season is just for fitness. It's not relevant to regular season MLS play.    You see position transitions at a top level all over the world, Mascherano moved from midfield to centre back for Barcelona and was successful.   You're being ridiculous. Brad Evans is a depth MLS player and a starter on a good day. Mascherano is one of the best players in the world. It's not even relatable.    All I ask is you don't judge Brad off of 2 games, adapting to a new position takes time and Brad will learn a lot from the last game. I can't believe you think I am deluded for simply giving Evans more than 180 minutes worth of a chance.   This isn't about developing a young player. This is a flat out position change in a position of need and they decided to use Brad instead of spending money on someone because he as already there and thinks he can do it. He proved last night that he can't do it and he wasn't even playing against a good team. The goals he gave up were not due to the other team outplaying him, they were due to simple fuckups that a 16 year old rookie might make, not an MLS veteran and captain of the team. Brad is useful in midfield and useless in defense.   These aren't things you ""learn from"" and change the next game. These are concepts that are taught from the beginning of a soccer player's career. Sigi said that they will see if it works out and if it doesn't then they'll bring someone in. It didn't work out, so it's over. You don't give leeway to people that lose games for you single handedly."

In that sense, this might as well be preseason.  If he can get it together in 3-5 matches, while the top 2 strikers in the league cover his errors, then that would be great.  I agree that Evans could move up top to replace Neagle.  But team chemistry is out biggest asset.  As long as Sigi, Frei, Marshall, and the team in general stay positive and help him work through the early stages, I say go for it.  Once a good deal of soccer has been played against a few different teams, then you can make the call.  That's not to say that Sigi shouldn't be scheming a plan B right now.  There's just no need to implement some half-assed solution immediately. We have time."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,MowwMoww,2,Sun Mar 15 21:03:08 2015 UTC,"All the talk this year is about the cup.    Maybe from the fans that don't know any better. The coaching staff is committed to the CCL, USOC, Supporter's Shield, and MLS Cup. The first trophy possible to win is the USOC, followed by the SS, followed by MLS Cup, followed by CCL. So as it stands, SS is more important.   In that sense, this might as well be preseason.   Again, as the coaches and players have said season after season, 3 points in early regular season is worth the same as 3 points in October. This is not preseason and it is foolish to think that way.   while the top 2 strikers in the league cover his errors, then that would be great   Dempsey and Martins have 5 goals together in two matches. They are at their peak. A team cannot win with a singular defender giving up 3 goals a match.    I agree that Evans could move up top to replace Neagle. But team chemistry is out biggest asset.   I don't see what those have to do with each other. Team chemistry is important but Marshall and Leo have proven it doesn't matter who plays next to them they'll still be fantastic. Hell, Seattle's defense was terrible last year and it was a revolving door at center back.   As long as Sigi, Frei, Marshall, and the team in general stay positive and help him work through the early stages, I say go for it. Once a good deal of soccer has been played against a few different teams, then you can make the call.   This isn't a 3-5 game experiment, this is a ""let's see if he is capable of playing center back without conceding goals against MLS competition."" This isn't preseason. There isn't time to make drastic changes on the back line. The FO failed in the offseason to bring in a capable center back because they banked on Evans working out. It is glaringly obvious that it isn't going to work out. It doesn't take 5 games to determine that. It just doesn't. We saw enough in one game to determine that he just isn't a defender. He doesn't have the instincts, the training, the experience. This was a long shot as discussed by the coaching staff and it didn't work. I think you're severely downplaying just how bad he was last night. Seattle lost 3-2 to one of the worst teams in the West at home.    That's not to say that Sigi shouldn't be scheming a plan B right now. There's just no need to implement some half-assed solution immediately. We have time.   Again, we don't ""have time.""

I don't se where you got that from. As for plan B? Well, the transfer window is still open for another month.

But how about 0 goals like the first game? What I'm trying to say is 2 games isn't enough to be calling for such drastic changes.   Even by Sigi's claim, Brad wasn't great in the first game. Seattle played a team with their two best players injured. NE will be terrible until those players are back, including last year's MVP candidate in Lee Nguyen.    Yes, our defense was bad last year.

Teams at this level don't have room to make these kinds of experiments. this isn't a rebuilding year. Seattle challenges for the top spot every single year and having 3-5 losses at the start of the year because you're trying to switch positions is not acceptable.    It's early in the season man. Chill out. Have a beer. Watch some soccer.   Again, not a useful comment. Sports exist for entertainment. Entertainment is derived from talking about sports and analyzing what happened. If you don't want to see people criticize a player because you're too attached to him then probably don't come to a forum dedicated to that."

The notion that a player should be trained throughout pre season for a new position and then be dropped after the 2nd game is a complete joke."

He needs to bulk up. He looked like a skinny little kid for both games now. Of course we wont drop him, he can and will improve. He literally has no choice but to do so.   But its no joke to expect our TEAM CAPTAIN to show up at whatever position he feels he plays ""well"". Of course theres no emulating the speed of play in a real match but, and to be fair i didnt see him in pre season, but its silly of you and of any fan to not have those expectations of him. That is what pre season is for. I hope he improves, which i can see happening due to his attitude, but I think he needs to be replaced and get more comfortable there.  Wondolowski was excited to play against Evans. He knew he would kick the shit out of him, and he did. Any striker will be excited after seeing that."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,philwelch,2,Sun Mar 15 20:17:31 2015 UTC,"Sigi is the one who should know better. Brad's an ambitious guy, he's always going to think he's up for it. Sigi is responsible for selecting a starting XI; Brad Evans at centerback is his responsibility."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,ravegreener,3,Sun Mar 15 20:33:20 2015 UTC,"He had a turrible game, and made some pretty bad defensive mistakes. Last week I loved how simply he tried to play the position, clearing the ball out the side when he could have controlled t and played out of the back. This week he tried to get a bit more complex, and made some mistakes.  Brad's a smart guy, probably the smartest player (soccer wise) on the team. He's going to have some mistakes, but you can be sure he's going to work on them, and do his best to never make them again."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,deweese3,2,Sun Mar 15 16:54:21 2015 UTC,I love Brad Evans but we lost because of him. Now that is the coaches decision. This is the price were gonna pay if he's gonna learn to be a cb.
SoundersFC,2z3an6,OG_Retro,7,Sun Mar 15 15:15:47 2015 UTC,"Why? He was responsible for the two goals. Let's not sugar coat this, he is not fit to be a CB right now and we need to explore new options."

It was also a team loss tonight - Dempsey had several clear cut changes, everybody's passing was pretty mediocre, and Neagle was quite poor."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,Audicity,2,Sun Mar 15 04:07:30 2015 UTC,"Neagle had an off day for sure, the only great player we had tonight was Marshall (though Dempsey played well). Evans single handedly gave two goals to the Quakes, and we lost by one. Every game is a team win or a team loss but certain players are more responsible than others for the outcome. It's hard to argue that Evans wasn't far and above the most responsible for this loss.  That being said I still love him. He's a very good player and a great captain. He's a class act. Unfortunately he just had the worst game of his life, but he'll get over it."
SoundersFC,2z3an6,bwc_28,0,Sun Mar 15 05:22:31 2015 UTC,Neagle had an off day for sure   Huh? No that's very typical of how Neagle plays. Neagle is not as great as people seem to think he is. He's easily one our weakest links out there and it's blatantly obvious.

His crosses overshooting to the other side of the box. Getting beat on the ball way too many times.  A perfect example of his inability was that pathetic attempt to back-heel the ball as a pass to Gonzalez up the side. He just sorta rolled it right under his foot and the defender took it away.

I'm not saying flood his Twitter with negative comments but I don't think we need to baby him. I also don't think he should play center back anymore. This was a match we should have won, instead we drop points due to poor defensive play. I never thought I'd want Jalil Anibaba back."

The header was a stupid mistake and could have happened to anyone. If he had hit it slightly harder, it would have been in Frei's hands and no one would have cared. Did he screw up? Yes, certainly, but the difference of a inch or two on one header isn't enough to condemn him. As for Emeghara's goal, looking back at it, Evans ran into trouble because he wasn't initially the one guarding Emeghara. There were two midfielders who could have easily picked up the run and helped Evans out. As it happened, he lost his footing because he had to make up a lot of ground and had to stretch to block Emeghara's possible early shot. If the midfield had fallen back to help out instead of watching, he could have taken a shorter path inside to cut off the shot, without having to worry about challenging Emeghara as well.  Could Evans have done better? Of course. But for what player can't that be said?"

In the stands I heard people saying that he should come off the field, but nobody was talking crap about him outside of that.  He's got love and support from the fans...but let's call a spade a spade - tonight was terrible (for a lot of the team, honestly.  Jesus)"

Perhaps the fear is that in the final seconds if you work it up that the ref will call the game, where if you get it into the attacking third he'll let you play until the ball is cleared out again."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,doublemazaa,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:32:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, doesn't the game clock just stop at 90' at the stadium? I don't think it keeps counting like it does on TV. That would make it harder for players to estimate how many seconds they had left.   Still, when we control possession & push forward we seem to get shots off. Not so with the long balls."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Disimpaction,26,Sun Mar 15 22:50:03 2015 UTC,"Brad was the main weakness tonight, but we were sloppy all over the field.   Errant passes. Errant passes everywhere."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,AWACS_Thunderhead,17,Sun Mar 15 04:07:19 2015 UTC,"We might have been sloppy all over the field, but Evans made 3 very clear mistakes that directly lead to 3 goals. It wasn't like a Neagle turnover or something led to a goal, but three obvious mistakes from Brad in the box or just outside of the box created 3 goals, which isn't acceptable.   To put it in perspective, Dempsey and Oba have 5 goals between them in 2 games. With any sort of cohesive defense they should be at the top of the table convincingly."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,AWACS_Thunderhead,8,Sun Mar 15 04:18:59 2015 UTC,"Oh I know, I wasn't trying to diminish how poorly Brad played. If anything I was just highlighting how poorly the rest of the team also played."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,CascadiaKid,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:36:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, its easy to point the finger at Brad and say that's why we lost. But,  I thought it was a pretty poor game all around."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,LissMich,19,Sun Mar 15 05:30:05 2015 UTC,"It's games like this that the Sounders will lose all season. Yeah, Brad isn't used to playing at CB, but nobody besides Mears was brought in to help out the defense and there isn't anybody on the team that can come close to shoring things up when Ozzie is unavailable. Teams with experienced forwards (like Wondo) are going to eat that shit up. It was a problem last year and it's going to be worse this year. I just don't understand how few moves the FO made. They have to realize how old our backline was and still is.   Now I'm obviously not hitting the panic button just yet. After all the past few seasons have sort of followed this trend of losing these games early at home, including last year and we all know how that turned out. But it is performances like these that I always know will show up every now and again that keep me from getting overly excited about our big wins."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,ajrcoyote,3,Sun Mar 15 04:35:35 2015 UTC,I agree 100%.
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,thegodsarepleased,17,Sun Mar 15 04:36:50 2015 UTC,Damnit maybe we do need a new CB
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,trickjarrett,13,Sun Mar 15 04:09:09 2015 UTC,"We do. I never understood how the FO thought our defensive problems could be solved by one new signing and a reposition. I thought our problem would be depth though, not the starters themselves."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Dayvido,5,Sun Mar 15 04:36:57 2015 UTC,"We 100% do, or we need another DP level CDM to pair with Ozzie. I don't hate the idea of playing 4-2-2-2."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,The_Sultan_of_Swing,3,Sun Mar 15 05:26:25 2015 UTC,"Regardless of whether or not Brad works out it is still a crime that the only depth at CB we have is a converted midfielder playing his first ever competitive matches at CB, an aging player that will likely retire after this season, and a bunch of rookies that will likely be bench players their entire lives."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,FullyTorquedTyler,3,Mon Mar 16 06:12:28 2015 UTC,"I was waiting on Zack to come in. He had a fantastic season last year, he should be a first choice CB"

SoundersFC,2z3ba2,stealth_sloth,15,Sun Mar 15 19:42:27 2015 UTC,Brad got a hat trick of sorts tonight
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,PeteyNice,13,Sun Mar 15 04:25:11 2015 UTC,"I love Brad Evans but having him learn to play CB on the job is not acceptable for a team that has aspirations of winning trophies. I am sure he will be better going forward but I fully expect more mistakes that someone with CB experience would not make. With all of the allocation money we supposedly got for Yedlin I am shocked that a move wasn't made to bring in a true CB.   Two weeks off and hopefully Alonso is back for Dallas away. If we lose the SS by a couple of points at the end of the year, this is the kind of game you point to and say 'what if..'"
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,JohnnySnowstorm,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:29:39 2015 UTC,"having him learn to play CB on the job is not acceptable for a team that has aspirations of winning trophies.   We could lose every match from now through the end of April and still end up in the running for CCL, USOC, Cascadia Cup, and MLS Cup. It would torpedo chances of taking the Shield again, of course... but a little experimentation in March is really not that disastrous."

SoundersFC,2z3ba2,VivanteImperii,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:13:08 2015 UTC,"Every cringe worthy mistake he makes just drives up the price for a move within MLS for a CB. If we have to wait for the summer transfer window, then SS, USOC and potentially Cascadia are over with. There was no reason to go with Evans as CB with no backup plan in place."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,JamieKThomas,28,Mon Mar 16 15:05:31 2015 UTC,"I think Evans will start next week because it's just a friendly, but he was useless tonight. Completely at fault for all 3 goals."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,sherlocknessmonster,17,Sun Mar 15 04:03:31 2015 UTC,"His performance was shocking, but the entire team was lacking commitment and fire for most of the game. Yeah they came alive in the last 25 minutes of the game, but we've got to do better for 90 minutes if we really want to win an MLS cup."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,DrunkenRedditMan,8,Sun Mar 15 04:16:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't want to bash on him too much, but Evans was way out of form tonight. Didn't pick up runs, made that stupid bobbled header decision. Looked very sloppy on his part."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,thegraduate,3,Sun Mar 15 04:07:25 2015 UTC,Pretty fucking much >:/
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,DrunkenRedditMan,0,Sun Mar 15 04:05:17 2015 UTC,"You can't say he is completely at fault, there were 10 other players there for Seattle.  He missed a header for the 1st goal but why wasn't Marshall covering? The 2nd goal was his fault. The 3rd goal was a great bit of skill but why was he allowed in to that position?  All I've seen on this subreddit since the game is scape goating, knee jerk reactions and sore losers. It pains me to say but Seattle fans are spoiled and struggle when we lose."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,sherlocknessmonster,2,Sun Mar 15 10:58:09 2015 UTC,"No. Literally every goal came from a clear mistake from Evans. It's not even an opinion, it's on tape."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Thesonofben,-11,Sun Mar 15 17:43:57 2015 UTC,"He really needs to be stripped of the captains armband...right when the whistle blew he ripped it off and went straight to the locker room with his tail tucked...no class, no leadership"
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,metameh,8,Sun Mar 15 04:31:02 2015 UTC,"I disagree. Evans didn't play well today but he is a natural leader and deserves to be the captain, regardless of whether he works out as a center back."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,metameh,0,Sun Mar 15 04:59:00 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  A captain doesn't rip off his arm band and doesn't be the first leave the locker room, no matter what kind of night you have. The dude had the worst night of his career but he is only thinking about himself."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,philwelch,3,Sun Mar 15 05:32:53 2015 UTC,"It's understandable he was frustrated after tonight, the worst night he's had as a Sounder, and yes his conduct was unacceptable after the game. But rescinding the captains armband after tonight is harsh given his influence last season and past experience as a captain."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,The_Sultan_of_Swing,1 point,Sun Mar 15 05:44:39 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter what he contributed last season...I know he's been put in a shitty situation by our GM and Coach, but you must conduct yourself as a leader...he didn't last night.  We need someone that leads when they, and their team are at their worst...someone who will rally the troops when your backs against the wall...a true mark of a leader is what they do in adversity, not during success."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,betacatenin,18,Sun Mar 15 17:45:42 2015 UTC,"So pissed.  Evans was clearly the #1 problem, but I wasn't happy with Neagle, either.  We really, really need to hold onto the ball better.  So many giveaways.    SJ had so much more zest for 60 minutes of that game."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,_Anthropophobiac_,1 point,Sun Mar 15 04:06:13 2015 UTC,"Everyone had a poor passing game. So many needless giveaways. Oba was the biggest offender in that department, IMO - his pass to Neagle which lead to the almost assist should have been an assist itself."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,stealth_sloth,1 point,Sun Mar 15 19:49:09 2015 UTC,"We say that, but Seattle finished the match with 81% passing completion which is very solid for MLS play. In comparison, the week before we finished the match with 80% passing accuracy.   Now there are always glaring passing issues and it's hard to gauge how many of those passes were just 3 yard touch passes without looking at the full data, but I don't think the offense was as bad as many of the people here are saying. We were playing against a team that essentially got ahead and parked the bus, after all. After the red card they had every man behind the ball for the rest of the match which is very difficult to pass through even with Oba and Clint. That's why we saw them trying long balls at the end."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Audicity,1 point,Mon Mar 16 06:10:47 2015 UTC,"I'm not even talking about the long balls (which I don't hate - I'm not opposed to old fashioned soccer). Before the red card, the passing was off. Sure, most of them found their target, but many of those still slowed down play by being hit to heavily or lightly, forcing the receiver to check to the ball. Often enough, the ball didn't find its target, or the touch of the receiving player was off, sending the ball to a waiting defender.   Its great if you're completing two passes for everyone one of your opponents, but only if you can get the ball to dangerous areas. When you're losing the ball so often in the middle of the pitch, possession and pass completion are noisy stats (especially when you're down a goal or two).  I'll agree with you the offense wasn't dismal. I'm more inclined to chalk it up to ""one of those days"" or ""San Jose/Dom Kinnear know how to play against the Sounder's small ball"", but it was an ugly game, 81% completion or no."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,droundhouse,19,Mon Mar 16 08:38:22 2015 UTC,There's a place somewhere in Sigi's imagination where Brad Evans is a centerback. It's probably the same place where Shalrie Joseph is  a striker.

Aside from that main point, Dempsey and Martins looked decent with 2 goals between them. If we would have been playing with the same intensity that we did in the last 20, we might've won that.   On to a friendly next week, so hopefully it can give our guys a chance to collect themselves and take a breather."

SoundersFC,2z3ba2,hhdslater,2,Sun Mar 15 04:20:11 2015 UTC,"Disappointing game, we had the opportunities.. But as always Sounders Til I Die"
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,CascadiaKid,2,Sun Mar 15 04:14:25 2015 UTC,"At the end of the game, we would get the ball at the top of the box and then completely stop all motion and turn it over. I realize that it is hard to do anything when there is a wall of defense all over you, but why not kick it back out or to the side? Nope, it seemed like it was just take it up the middle, hit the defense, turn it over."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Aurick,2,Sun Mar 15 04:33:14 2015 UTC,"I will post this up might be a little too late...  I was at all of the San Jose games in Seattle last season and they are a very tough team for Seattle to beat. They are a pretty good defensive team that is hard to break down, and have lots of tall physical players. Most of these games seem to start with Seattle launching solid attacks and keeping San Jose pinned, then we take the foot off the gas a little or they get fouled for a set piece, and we get scored on by Wondo essentially who is good at finding the right place to be in those situations. Then we get panicky and start lobbing long balls / floating crosses up to our definitely not target forwards, and just lose possession. We did this against San Jose & Vancouver last year and those matches were insanely frustrating to watch."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,CascadiaKid,2,Sun Mar 15 06:09:09 2015 UTC,"Their physicality and ability to draw fouls, dubious or not, in advantageous places always seems to be the difference. Add that to the fact that Wondo is apparently a ghost until he shows up in the box."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,steerbell,2,Sun Mar 15 06:22:46 2015 UTC,"Why exactly didn't we sign more defenders in the off season? I hate to be that guy who says ""oh I've been saying it all along,"" but seriously... When we did our off season signings, all I could think was, ""Well we're definitely going to regret not signing at least one or two more big name defenders."""
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,AcidCheese5,2,Sun Mar 15 09:19:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we're not in a very good position if the Evans project doesn't work. You have either Scott or essentially a rookie."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Aurick,2,Sun Mar 15 17:14:23 2015 UTC,"Exactly. And I really, really, really more than anything don't want to see Scott back in the starting line up. I love Scott and Leo, but they're so old and Scott is basically a rugby player. Why in God's name one of them is still a starter and the other is a first-string substitute is something I will never understand."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,gear7,2,Sun Mar 15 22:26:36 2015 UTC,"Its easy to blame this on Evans. But, honestly the better team won tonight. Its not like we played well except for a couple dumb errors. We played like shit, and they capitalized on some dumb errors. It shouldn't take being up and man and losing by two goals to inspire a team to play hard. We were lazy and lackluster for 75% of the game. Holy shit I can't wait for us to get Ozzie back, he would have lit a fire under some asses tonight."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,gear7,9,Sun Mar 15 04:51:58 2015 UTC,"You're quite wrong actually.  Seattle dominated pretty much every stat.   10 corners to 1 21 tackles won to 20 8 clearances vs. 45 1 save vs. 7 0 offside calls 11 fouls to 13 63.8% possession to 36.2% 81% passing accuracy to 69%   San Jose were far from the better team and benefited off of 3 mistakes from evans that led directly to 3 goals. With someone else in defense back there this game ends 2-0, 2-1, 1-0, etc, with Seattle winning. You can say the offense was impotent, but they still scored 2 goals while 3 goals were solely on one player."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,Syuk_Dat_Deke,9,Sun Mar 15 04:55:48 2015 UTC,"That 81% passing accuracy is a deceptive stat though. We were seeing heavy touches all across the pitch tonight. Sure, the passes were getting to the right people, but only after they were consistently overshot and the receiver had to play catch-up. It was happening all night from almost everyone. It threw off our timing. We effectively shut down our own offense."
SoundersFC,2z3ba2,thegraduate,4,Sun Mar 15 06:22:19 2015 UTC,I think a lot of those stats are skewed by the fact that we were up a man almost the entire second half and San Jose packed it in after their third goal. The first half neither team had any real chances after the first 15 minutes and possession was even. And it wasn't until we were down 3-1 that we really took control of possession and got on the attack.

SoundersFC,2z3ba2,planetes,6,Sun Mar 15 04:26:36 2015 UTC,"They said Mears was intended to be the new RB from day one. Tyrone is the only one who said he'd be willing to try CB if asked, but the FO was pretty clear. He's also doing a dang good job there.  Evans clearly had his worst match in recent history, but he did a pretty solid job last week. A player can't have one bad day and get pulled off the position. It's totally fair to see how he plays in the next two matches at least, and one of those is a Friendly anyway."

SoundersFC,2z3bf3,betacatenin,2,Sun Mar 15 04:16:03 2015 UTC,I'd say give it to Marshall this week. Dempsey and Oba both had goals but Marshall really showcased what good defending looks like next to Evans.

SoundersFC,2z0yqz,Wineguy33,1 point,Sat Mar 14 16:36:30 2015 UTC,"You would need to TiVo it or have MLS Live. Other than that, you will need to get creative with technology somehow. I don't know of any pirated streaming service that keeps the game recording. It's generally just steamed live and usually is a crappy resolution. Some times the local station replays the game the next day so you can check broadcast schedules. MLS Live allows the game to be played the same evening after it ends. After that you have to wait a day or two to replay it. I use MLS Live because so I can watch all the games in a condensed style or a whole game if there is a great matchup."

SoundersFC,2yx2w4,Speedyq24,9,Fri Mar 13 15:33:08 2015 UTC,Definitely was a team goal.
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,DronePirate,18,Fri Mar 13 17:01:01 2015 UTC,"not even a little surprised, that goal was a thing of beauty. All credit goes to Pappa for making the perfect assist."
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,gramernatsi,4,Fri Mar 13 15:38:56 2015 UTC,It's too bad he won't be credited with the assist
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,Prehensile_penis_ama,8,Fri Mar 13 16:58:07 2015 UTC,He was credited with the second assist right?  Isn't this play the exact reason that stat exists?
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,cubby13579,3,Fri Mar 13 17:04:40 2015 UTC,"You're right, my bad"
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,Prehensile_penis_ama,3,Fri Mar 13 17:09:49 2015 UTC,I'm excited to see more of this combination all season. These guys gel so well together. They make each other that much better. There's no other combo in the league that plays off each other like these guys do. And we have them.
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,EBFG493,3,Fri Mar 13 19:40:50 2015 UTC,This goal was a team masterpiece! Hopefully Pappa will continue playing the way he played this match in order to make the Hydra even more dangerous than last season.
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,davca55,2,Fri Mar 13 22:18:02 2015 UTC,Whats the rule on the pass after the last defender? Oba and Clint were both past the final defender when oba passed correct? I think I have been playing too much rec soccer. My brain is getting fuzzy lol.
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,Stuface,1 point,Sat Mar 14 10:02:32 2015 UTC,"It would have been offsides if it was a forward pass, but it was passed back so it's all good."
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,LordNapoleonComplex,1 point,Sat Mar 14 15:27:55 2015 UTC,"Dempsey was behind Oba at time of pass so a backpass won't be offsides regardless. There was also a post in the MLS thread about this goal quoting some regulations for if both players are behind the last defender it isn't offsides to make a forward pass, but I'm unsure how legitimate that claim is as I've never heard of it before."
SoundersFC,2yx2w4,Replicannot,1 point,Sat Mar 14 19:20:34 2015 UTC,This will be a highlight that will be replayed all season.
SoundersFC,2yy9as,reeseallen,2,Fri Mar 13 21:01:10 2015 UTC,When I went to the downtown team store last November they told me that if I went to the store in CLink and paid for a custom jersey before the match it would be completed during the match and available at halftime.
SoundersFC,2yy9as,j4ckattack,2,Sat Mar 14 00:19:48 2015 UTC,"Your information is super close. The Clink Pro Shop does have a machine to customize kits, but hasn't received the new numbers in yet. When I spoke with them last, they said they were hoping to get them in the next couple weeks, but didn't know for sure. If the Clink doesn't have them in yet, I wouldn't expect any brick and mortar stores to carry them yet either."
SoundersFC,2yy9as,Aurick,1 point,Sat Mar 14 06:19:48 2015 UTC,I am pretty sure the team store at CLink has the numbering machine.  You can see them doing the numbering in the inside corners through the windows.
SoundersFC,2yy9as,DronePirate,2,Fri Mar 13 23:16:35 2015 UTC,"Hmm. When we asked at the team store on Sunday, we were told that we would need to go across the street if we wanted jerseys with names/numbers on them."
SoundersFC,2yy9as,john_mcrotten,2,Fri Mar 13 23:42:49 2015 UTC,It was probably because of it being the first match and the Pro Shop being much busier than normal. Should be easy to do once things slow down for them later on in the season.
SoundersFC,2yy9as,hackberrydraw,1 point,Sat Mar 14 17:32:47 2015 UTC,"Not much help for tomorrow's game, but the Oba jerseys are available on the online store. Only downside is the season ticket holder 15% discount does not seem to work online. My girlfriend desperately wants an Oba jersey and I think I want a Pappa one, though I'm honestly tempted to get it done on a shale away jersey from last year, as I like it better than anything this year has to offer.  Edit: Looks like Shale is gone and the new kits are replica only, no authentics."
SoundersFC,2yy9as,john_mcrotten,1 point,Fri Mar 13 23:48:42 2015 UTC,I've never had a problem using the season ticket holder discount online (usually applied at check out). Not being able to get Match Pass points is crap though.

SoundersFC,2yp85i,TweetPoster,3,Wed Mar 11 17:51:05 2015 UTC,"He had been rumoured to be in talks with NYCFC a while back. Considering their starting GK is the reliant, if not spectacular Josh Saunders, I'd hedge my bets on the big apple. Aside from that, San Jose, Vancouver, and Toronto strike me as squads with perhaps less-than-spectacular starting GKs. Tyler Deric in Houston is still fairly unproven, but the FO seems to have confidence in him, and considering he's a home-grown that they're trying to tout as a success tory, I doubt they bring in someone of Gspurning's stature to challenge him."
SoundersFC,2yp85i,csinser,5,Wed Mar 11 20:47:06 2015 UTC,Other complicating factor is I believe SSFC still control his rights so any team that picks him up would have to compensate the sounders

We had a guy in our section yesterday for the first game he'd ever been to.  He was from Virginia and happened to be in town for the weekend and grabbed a last minute ticket.

It's not like that for most of us though. There's nothing I love more than taking someone who's never been, giving them a scarf and marching to the match. They have no idea what to expect and always have the best time.  If you're ever in Seattle, come to a game. If you can get to an away game, you might even enjoy yourself just as much if not more.

SoundersFC,2yfai5,benfreilich,4,Mon Mar 9 19:45:50 2015 UTC,Since oba was already past the defense it doesn't matter where they are. You have to be behind the ball or the last defender. In this case oba had burned them and when he made the pass Clint was still onside.

SoundersFC,2yf9ci,ballcouzzi,1 point,Mon Mar 9 17:55:47 2015 UTC,As long as Dempsey is level or behind the ball he's onside.
SoundersFC,2yh4b4,evanfalcon,3,Mon Mar 9 19:46:09 2015 UTC,Now if only it were easier to find the good beer spots in the stadium. Tired of wandering the entire concourse and seeing nothing but Bud Light and Shocktop
SoundersFC,2yh4b4,CougFanDan,2,Mon Mar 9 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"Yep, I had the same issue. Outside of GA there was 7 Seas IPA at beechers, but everything else was inbev products. I had to walk a 1/4 way around to the craft beer line (longest beer line there was) to have an actual selection of craft beer."
SoundersFC,2yh4b4,antifreze,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:21:33 2015 UTC,I agree! This was taken at Henry's Tavern across the street from the M's stadium. If you're a beer junkie you'll be in Heaven.

SoundersFC,2yelwc,randymeeker,29,Mon Mar 9 15:15:22 2015 UTC,"I'm going to dump some interesting stats here, some of which I tweeted about earlier.   New England's total pass success rate was 75%. Seattle's pass success rate in the final third was 74%. Chad Marshall completed 32 of his 34 pass attempts, for a pass success rate of 94%. He added 5/5 aerial duels, 8 interceptions, 13 clearances, 2 blocked shots, and 1 shot. If the game had ended 0-0, he's probably man of the match. 4 of Seattle's 6 attempted shots came from Dempsey.  6 Sounders recorded 4+ clearances each: Marshall, Azira, Gonzalez, Mears, Evans, Pappa.  Gonzalez and Neagle shut down offensive production on New England's right side, coming in first and second respectively in tackles won. Gonzalez had 6 and Neagle had 5.  All 3 of Seattle's shots on target resulted in goals. Pappa acted as a third chance creator, working well with Dempsey in Martins. He led the team in key passes and successful take-ons (tied with Dempsey), with 2 each.  The CB duo of Marshall and Evans combined for 9/9 on aerial duels, 12 interceptions, and 24 clearances."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,clickmyface,5,Mon Mar 9 05:28:56 2015 UTC,"I like you, I hope there is more of you."

SoundersFC,2yelwc,randymeeker,1 point,Mon Mar 9 09:49:24 2015 UTC,"I find it hard to believe that Evans won all his duels, I can think of a couple times that he got pushed around in the air...."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,smokey815,1 point,Mon Mar 9 16:10:16 2015 UTC,"2 of them resulted in the Sounders winning a free kick. The other 2 were won cleanly, according to Squawka. These are only aerial duels. He may have been pushed around in the air a few times, but it wouldn't go down as losing a duel unless the opposing player actually won the ball."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,vuduwastaken,18,Mon Mar 9 17:28:42 2015 UTC,"We looked bloody good.  Azira was good, but holy shit will we be amazing if we can play like that with Ozzie driving it all.  Mears was great.  Not quite as flashy as Yedlin, but definitely smarter, and has a hell of a cross on him.    Brad at CB will work.  His composure on the ball and his understanding of the game are great, and he's a more ball playing partner for Marshall.  Dempsey is slick, Oba is a badass.    Pappa and Neagle were good.  When Oba and Dempsey are on the same page as Pappa, it's beautiful.  Quick plug for my player ratings survey.

SoundersFC,2yelwc,Looorney,17,Mon Mar 9 17:11:44 2015 UTC,"We were all so uneasy about Mears when they announced we got him, but hot damn was he good tonight."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,SonOfMechaMummy,6,Mon Mar 9 04:22:24 2015 UTC,"Still a couple unfortunate turnovers by him where he obviously expected a teammate to be making a different run from the one actually made, or was caught off guard by a pass - he looks like he's 95% on the same page as the rest of the team, but not quite fully there yet.  With that said, he had a very good game as is and I expect that ""very good"" will turn into ""outstanding"" as the season goes on."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,arbogasm,3,Mon Mar 9 12:27:03 2015 UTC,And he looked very good in preseason too.  Very relaxed on the ball.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,smokey815,16,Mon Mar 9 10:30:49 2015 UTC,Thank god our team's back. It was a long four months.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,trickjarrett,26,Mon Mar 9 03:34:17 2015 UTC,"Thoughts:   Pappa was awesome. His ability to hold up the ball and play in passes is awesome. Azira filled in very nicely. Always impressed by him. Brad was pretty good at CB. A few turnovers but overall a good performance and a clean sheet. Dempsey and Martins are Dempsey and Martins, not much to say there. Mears is an improvement to Yedlin in my opinion and will be very successful."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,steerbell,13,Mon Mar 9 03:28:30 2015 UTC,"Everyone in this thread so far has rated Azira highly. I'll have to rewatch the match tomorrow because I didn't see a great performance from him. I noticed him get caught defensively between two Revs players a couple times, and he didn't seem to offer anything going forward except loose 50/50 passes. It felt like he was a half step behind the game most of the time. I think his play would have been exposed by a stronger side (Revs looked toothless without their best two players)."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,Speedyq24,13,Mon Mar 9 03:56:25 2015 UTC,"I thought he was decent, but no Ozzie.  He wasn't a liability for me, but he wasn't the driving force that Ozzie is for us."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,lightjedi5,7,Mon Mar 9 04:12:16 2015 UTC,To me he was the weakest of our 11 but he was still an improvement over last season.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,sabins253,3,Mon Mar 9 05:19:05 2015 UTC,"I thought Azira had a nice game. Pineda made his job a little easier as he did not get forward much. Azira plays kind of loose, all arms and legs and does not look as under control as the meticulous Ozzie. But Azira can make up errors with some speed. To me Azira is not a play destroyer but a clogger."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,AWACS_Thunderhead,2,Mon Mar 9 15:56:22 2015 UTC,I definitely agree. Wasn't impressed by Azira. In the other hand I was really impress by mears' performance.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,lightjedi5,2,Mon Mar 9 05:31:53 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with you, I was bitching about him all game with my dad."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,JohnnySnowstorm,2,Mon Mar 9 04:11:58 2015 UTC,You now have a third. By Interwebz logicz we have a new rule
SoundersFC,2yelwc,Zorrino,1 point,Mon Mar 9 04:27:25 2015 UTC,Count me in with you two. I thought he was actually the one glaring weakness tonight (not that we had many).
SoundersFC,2yelwc,clickmyface,2,Mon Mar 9 04:24:33 2015 UTC,"Yes, he definitely felt like the weakest link. If they play that way but with Alonso in the middle instead of Azira, they'll be that much better."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,stealth_sloth,10,Mon Mar 9 05:03:25 2015 UTC,"Obafemi was MotM for me, both of the open play goals were great and New England didn't seem to have an answer for the Sounders' offensive pressure.  Very happy to see Frei is in form, great for his confidence to start with a clean sheet and at least 2 great saves.   Watching it on Fox Sports 1, the quality was great, not a huge fan of Alexi Lalas as a color commentator though.  Overall great opening weekend of MLS, watching all of the game these past few days made me realize just how much I missed it during the off season."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,clickmyface,6,Mon Mar 9 03:31:47 2015 UTC,I hope the ESPN production crew that worked the Orlando match watched the matches on Fox - it will give them something to work towards.  Also - to anyone working in marketing out there - sign Oba to an endorsement deal and you have my business form here on out...even (gulp) Budweiser. Ok....everyone but Budweiser.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,OMGWTFBBQL0L,4,Mon Mar 9 04:44:33 2015 UTC,"MotM for me is tough this game which is an awesome problem to have. Dempsey put 2 up and played amazing so he takes it over Martins for me easy, but Pappa and Mears and Frei had an amazing showing as well. My confidence in Frei was already pretty high after the post-season last year but I'm glad to see it continues."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,randymeeker,2,Mon Mar 9 05:44:58 2015 UTC,I'm not saying Frei played badly - I thought he had an excellent game when called upon. But New England put one shot on goal all game (plus a pair of tough crosses Frei did well to clear that might have resulted in dangerous chances if he hadn't).  Frei had a very solid but mostly quiet night. Not MotM.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,dogggis,2,Mon Mar 9 12:30:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I don't think he was MoTM either, just worth noting that his save was spectacular and his distribution was great too. Lots of notable mentions. Chad Marshall was the quiet knight too, ensuring Frei didn't have to do much."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,detkimble911,3,Mon Mar 9 15:19:13 2015 UTC,Whoever was with Alexi Lalas definitely made up for him. He had the quality of a Radio COmmentator which is huge. Really enjoyed him.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,soundice,2,Mon Mar 9 04:56:44 2015 UTC,"That was John Strong, who was the NBC guy for MLS after Arlo moved to Premier League duty. He also used to be the Timbers announcer."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,sabins253,2,Mon Mar 9 05:10:15 2015 UTC,Yeah the Fox Sports 1 stream was fantastic.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,SplooshFC,10,Mon Mar 9 04:14:02 2015 UTC,"Well.. * Don't think I can say enough about Mears/Pappa/Brad/Azira, * Great service from Mears, solid defensive work from Brad, coupled with good placement by Azira, * The holding-moving power of Pappa. * As was already said, Martins and Dempsey!      Loved every minute of that opener."

SoundersFC,2yelwc,mcmSEA,7,Mon Mar 9 11:40:56 2015 UTC,You should post that final buildup goal on /r/soccer Brad was great as was Azira I like Mears. His service was great. Congrats to Roldan on his first cap (although brief)
SoundersFC,2yelwc,joylongdivision,5,Mon Mar 9 03:29:47 2015 UTC,"Our back line may be better this year.  Mears isn't as quick as Yedlin, but I don't expect him to be caught up field as much.  Brad was a BEAST in the air and is excellent at distributing feom the back.  Oba and Deuce will be better this year."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,Masonic_Hippy,3,Mon Mar 9 03:48:06 2015 UTC,Just got home.  That was an amazing opener.  Rates for me up with 2009 (also 3-0 Sounders)  That Pappa through ball ... So pretty.  Dempsey and Martins .. Is there a better duo in the league?  Mears looked good and tough .. Evans played great at CB all night.  And Frye that one great stop ... Kelleresque.    Great night at home to open the season.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,stealth_sloth,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:56:01 2015 UTC,Exactly. Reminded me of 2009 opener too!
SoundersFC,2yelwc,johnwaters29,5,Mon Mar 9 05:22:35 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna be sad when Leo retires. He was so solid tonight.   Mears was good. Way better crosser than Yedlin, but not as dynamic going forward. Had a few bad touches but I'd put that down to getting used to the turf and nerves.   Azira I thought did his job, nothing more. Didn't really make any mistakes, but didn't do much going forward either. I can deal with that though. He's no Ozzie, but he's getting more and more reliable slowly.   Otherwise, I'm happy. Team played great, stadium was bouncing, and Deuce/Oba appear to already be in midseason form. Can't argue with that.  See you all next Saturday!"
SoundersFC,2yelwc,reeseallen,3,Mon Mar 9 04:47:25 2015 UTC,A couple of really nice crosses from Mears and great effort from the rest of the guys. I hope next time we'll get to face Jones and Nguyen.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,caduceus,5,Mon Mar 9 03:30:49 2015 UTC,"We're done with New England for the season, except possibly Open Cup or MLS Cup final. We only play Eastern Conference teams once each in the regular season."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,FlameOfUndun,3,Mon Mar 9 12:41:01 2015 UTC,"Looked great overall. Azira is confident on the ball, Mears really showed what he has to offer on both sides of the ball, Evans looks up to the challenge of a CB (minus a few wayward passes), and Oba, Dempsey, Pappa all looked connected and were having fun. Boy, that third goal is why I love soccer, just pure class.  Can't wait for the rest of the season!!"
SoundersFC,2yelwc,ravegreenunicorn,3,Mon Mar 9 03:33:33 2015 UTC,"Mears is awesome. Doesn't have Yedlin's speed, but with his skills, he doesn't need it. Getting him on the roster was a fantastic choice by the front office.  Azira has stepped up in a big way and was very impressive. Every time the ball came his way he made a good decision, or at least tried to. I was not impressed with his performance last season, but during this game (and during the last preseason game) he seems like a different player altogether.  Pappa is the fucking man. MVP of the game for sure. Every time he got the ball he made magic happen."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,_Anthropophobiac_,3,Mon Mar 9 04:49:40 2015 UTC,Did anyone else notice the new lights on the Columbia Tower?  I noticed they changed colors when Seattle scored a goal.  I thought that was pretty nifty.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,P9J0S6,2,Mon Mar 9 09:01:12 2015 UTC,"Great game, we looked like the team with the best chemistry this weekend, maybe LA is close to us? Idk.  But that was a great way to start. Dominant performance."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,bforeverdreamin,2,Mon Mar 9 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"I love our pace of play.  They obviously missed Jones and Win, so no telling what kind of impact they would have had on the game.  Get some sleep Brad Evans, you've earned it.  When there are 4 Sounders within 3 feet of the goal and the ball is being passed around, I wish just one of them would shoot the rock.  Otherwise, amazing stuff from our guys today."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,hhdslater,2,Mon Mar 9 03:31:40 2015 UTC,"Wow,what a fantastic start to the season!! I'm so excited to see what more Mears can do for us, and Oba and Demp seem to be in great form.   Overall a great showing and it has made me super excited for the rest of the season!!"
SoundersFC,2yelwc,lollergater,2,Mon Mar 9 03:41:22 2015 UTC,Absolutely fantastic. That's the defending EC champions (minus Jones and Nguyen of course) and we just put on a damn clinic. Awesome.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,XthroatCourtesy,2,Mon Mar 9 03:48:18 2015 UTC,The only thing I can say was that azira was a lot better than I expected.  He was very good in the middle and distributed the ball well which is a welcome change of pace and surprising considering his form last year.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,OMGWTFBBQL0L,2,Mon Mar 9 04:15:12 2015 UTC,"That last goal was some Barcalona shit. Not to pretend like we're that good, but that play was every bit as good as the dissecting passing plays that they do. Probably my favorite Sounders goal ever scored."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,didireallymakethis,2,Mon Mar 9 07:04:12 2015 UTC,Anyone else see Chad Marshall's stepover move?  Whodathunkit?

SoundersFC,2yelwc,reazon54,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:46:45 2015 UTC,"I'll be really interested to see if Brad can learn CB skills quickly enough to play a Mats Hummels-esque roll as a ball playing CB and allow Marshall to be a sweeper. If he is able to step up and join the midfield from time to time and deliver some nice vertical passes, it can really help alleviate pressure as the season goes on."

SoundersFC,2yelwc,Awbade,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:14:51 2015 UTC,"I'm curious to hear if anyone else had challenges with stadium Staff? Once again, we found ourselves beating a dead horse with the great standing versus sitting debate. And during a very exciting home opener no less.   I don't normally find myself in GA, but I'm also interested to hear how the new rules helped/harmed the experience."
SoundersFC,2yelwc,Nekokeki,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:41:33 2015 UTC,What challenges did you face? I'm in the lower bowl and didn't have any problems at all. Everyone was great.
SoundersFC,2yelwc,-Zoomacroom-,1 point,Mon Mar 9 21:36:27 2015 UTC,"Ah, I must just be lucky then. There's a season ticket holder who sits behind us and takes issue with us and the rows in front of us standing. He usually sells his tickets and I'm pretty sure that he doesn't tell whomever's buying that it's lower bowl, generally standing. The ticket holder actually did go this time, arrived 20 minutes into the game and starts laying into us to sit down after 30 seconds. He's usually unpleasant, but I swear he spent the offseason building himself up because he immediately was picking a fight. I could go on and on, but it's all petty annoyances over the last several years that add up to lack of warm feelings between us.  He complained that we wouldn't sit, which is his right. Our section staff is happy to reseat anyone and does pretty much on a game by game basis for my mom (she doesn't like to stand and prefers the view better where they move her). Who knows what he said, but 2 stadium staff members came down and pointed out 10 or so people that they felt they needed to talk to. It was pretty much everyone who sits in front of this guy for 3 rows, including several who were actually sitting. They were obviously pulling us aside to avoid blocking other people, but they were complete jackasses about it.  They told us the stadium policy is majority rules, though I've always understood this to be an informal policy (oft repeated by staff, but not in the written code of conduct). Since so many people in our section sell their tickets, they would literally have to assess who sits on a game by game basis or even WITHIN the game; since its lower bowl, we feel that there's a reasonable expectation to stand. The Clink staff didn't disagree, but she wanted to see if we all wanted to move. Sure, hook up some box seats for me. Jk, I love where we are and the fans around us. I wouldn't care if it was an official sitting section and I can base my season ticket purchase on that policy, but it's not. They just hope that fans will figure it out amongst themselves. While this was going on, we missed the 2nd goal, which I heard was fabulous. I'll catch it on replay, but if there's one way to drive me up the wall, it's missing Oba Flips.  They said we were free to go back to our seats and that they would try again to see if he would be willing to get reseated. Also, said that we could stand.  He didn't leave and some people we know actually heard him complaining again that we were spilling beer on him and being aggressive towards him. I guess if staring at the back of my head made him uncomfortable, maybe I'm guilty? I think he was just trying whatever he thought would stick, but they never came back down and he eventually left at some point. No idea...we had a game to watch.  Someone said we should be documenting all this with our ticket rep. Seemed a bit ridiculous since I'm perfectly happy and I know he had an opportunity to move to a seated section one to the right.  That's why I think he's deliberately trying to cause a problem.  TL;DR: Season ticket holders just can't agree on what giving their full 90 means. Missed Oba's goal while talking to Clink staff.  On a better note, it was such a beautiful game. Sorry to have missed any of it, but I have really high hopes for this year. I think Mears is a great add and he made some really smart plays. If Ozzie can get/stay fit, we are going to be really dangerous."

SoundersFC,2yenkb,doublemazaa,3,Mon Mar 9 04:57:29 2015 UTC,I thought the game was going to end before he got subbed in.
SoundersFC,2yenkb,steerbell,2,Mon Mar 9 04:26:30 2015 UTC,Good for him to 1. be on the bench means he has worked hard up to that point. 2. good for Sigi to get him into a game even though it was for ten seconds. All these point to a guy who is closer to a starter then a S2 player. He may need to go to S2 for more minutes but yeah all good for Roldan at this point.

SoundersFC,2yenkb,smokey815,1 point,Mon Mar 9 15:18:19 2015 UTC,I wish he would have gotten ten minutes or so and seen some touches.  We were hardly at risk of losing control of the match.

Players start at a six for me, and then either do well and improve, make mistakes and lose points, or just sort of coast and hang out where they are.

SoundersFC,2yemwt,jenomico,11,Mon Mar 9 03:51:20 2015 UTC,Dempsey I guess. 2 goals and an Assist. There were so many good performances it's hard to choose just one.
SoundersFC,2yemwt,MowwMoww,1 point,Mon Mar 9 03:47:55 2015 UTC,I don't think Dempsey had an assist that game. Mears was the one who crossed it in to Martins

SoundersFC,2yemwt,MowwMoww,1 point,Tue Mar 10 04:58:40 2015 UTC,They must be counting secondary assists (the pass before the assist) as well. That's not the best way to measure it- by definition it should be the last pass that lead to the goal. I'm just nitpicking though.
SoundersFC,2yemwt,Thapricorn,1 point,Tue Mar 10 05:00:36 2015 UTC,"Secondary assists count in MLS, yes."

SoundersFC,2yemwt,thegodsarepleased,7,Mon Mar 9 04:37:18 2015 UTC,"Marco Pappa  He was very solid on all parts of the field and helped to set up some of the finishes we saw. Dempsey was our finisher, but Pappa did a great job closing the gap from backfield through midfield to create opportunites."

He was running all over the place, had two goals, made that great pass to set up Mears for the assist, and made a lot of other things happen. Biggest play maker of the night in my mind. If not Dempsey though I'd say Pappa or Oba. (Everyone played well - so excited.)"
SoundersFC,2yemwt,hhdslater,1 point,Mon Mar 9 09:13:13 2015 UTC,"Martins.  Even though Dempsey got the goals, Martins was working hard the entire match and gave up the opportunity for an easy second to be unselfish and let Dempsey take the easier goal.  Also, that Frei save was stupid good."
SoundersFC,2yemwt,Looorney,1 point,Mon Mar 9 10:28:00 2015 UTC,"Okay okay, Dempsey has this one in the bag, if not him than Oba. But can I just say how glad I am that Frei is playing like a goddamn warrior out there, dominant, good hands, safe play, and cat-like reflexes on his save."

Why only the one game? Is it a poster specifically for that game? If you do decide to go with text, make it a little smaller and put it in front of something, it being in it's own space is just kinda wonky looking. Different font as well if you do decide to keep it."

SoundersFC,2yam6d,benfreilich,5,Sun Mar 8 06:32:16 2015 UTC,"Vancouver are early favorites for hardware from a few people, but it's been no where close to the hypetrain thats been building for Toronto, and they played a good season opener. Altidore, Bradley, and Giovinco are going to be a scary trio this season."
SoundersFC,2yam6d,Aurick,1 point,Sun Mar 8 01:21:03 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of people, at least fans, saw Toronto struggling at first with their brutal road schedule at the start of the season. I've only heard hype about Vanvouver starting the season strong and their MVP candidate Pedro Morales. But I agree that I'm legitimately worried about a well gelled Toronto further down the season"
SoundersFC,2yam6d,Aurick,2,Sun Mar 8 01:29:08 2015 UTC,"I think too many people were underselling Jozy and Bradley's USMNT synergy, and Gio's raw talent.  It's only one game, so it can all go south from here, but it was certainly a strong showing.  Either way, the match was closer than the score shows. Toronto's back line had some major issues, and if the Caps should have finished some of those early chances they had.  It was a great match overall, easily best of the week so far. Can't wait to hit CenturyLink tomorrow!"

SoundersFC,2y8yqp,reazon54,3,Sat Mar 7 22:13:40 2015 UTC,"I agree with /u/thegraduate about changing the scale. I don't know how much smaller the mountains need to be, but the logo is totally competing with them and it does not need to be the main focus.   I also agree with /u/WhatJewTalkingAbout about adding in an additional visual element that connects the poster more to Seattle somehow. Just make sure that those elements aren't illustrated in a completely separate style from the overall poster.   Shifting the composition down to make the green less dominant would also help. It's not interesting compositionally when the main visual element is right in the middle.   The green mountain is confusing because even with the slight stroke you've got going on, it blends in too much with the green foreground. Perhaps move the blue mountains from the back layer up to the front layer of mountains (especially because they really blend in with the sky), and then have the green mountain in the back row.   Typographically, there's no hierarchy at all. Right now, my first read is Centurylink Field simply because it's the first, but the match name really should be the first read because it's the most important piece of information. Try changing its size, or put it in a different typeface, or use lowercase in the other pieces of text, or any combination of that. Additionally, the line spacing is a little tight, especially because using all caps makes it harder for the eye to make its way through the words, so typically all caps need to be spaced out more than lowercase.   Other random thoughts: have you thought about using texture overlays so that it's not just pure blocks of color? That could add a little depth/interest that I think it's lacking right now.   This isn't a bad start, but I think there's quite a few quick changes that could make it stronger both conceptually and visually. Sorry that this turned into a full on design-school critique. I'm currently procrastinating on doing my own design homework, so I couldn't resist haha."

Before buying an authentic shirt it's really advisable to try one on and see the difference in the fit of the shirt.

SoundersFC,2y5tf8,motion_city_rules,6,Fri Mar 6 18:44:55 2015 UTC,"The clink actually is designed pretty well, so it's not like there are a bunch of ""Bad"" seats.   That being said, for soccer, being near the midline of the field is generally preferred because it makes it easier to watch the game. ECS and the other supporter groups are actually mostly located on the short end of the field, which are arguably not the best for game watching, but they are hella fun for being caught up in the glorious spectacle that makes up sounders games.   I like sitting during a game, so I usually go for 300-level seats. If you are in the 100-200 level seats do not be surprised if you stand most of the game. Seriously, everyone around you does so you end up doing it too. Bit more raucous down there."
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,maumacd,2,Fri Mar 6 18:54:51 2015 UTC,"Good advice. I feel bad when a family shows up in our section, not realizing it is really a standing section (North end STH). When in front of kids, I try to sit, but it's nearly impossible for me to sit through a match."
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,advancedbullshit,6,Fri Mar 6 19:18:09 2015 UTC,"There aren't any bad seats at CenturyLink. The view of the field is always pretty good no matter where you're sitting. The primary difference will be whether fans in that section are seated or standing.   The supporters group are in section 121, 122, & 123. The lower section is general admission, the upper section is assigned seating like the rest of the stadium. Expect 90 minutes of standing, jumping, singing and shouting from both upper and lower sections. The 100 level around the rest of the stadium is people standing and engaged in the match. Lots of cheering and celebration, not as much singing and chanting. The 200 level and most of the upper 100 level sections in the corners of the stadium are generally seated and more subdued. Still lots of active and engaged support from the fans, but often older couples or families who aren't as rowdy. The 300 level seats are exclusively people who are seated. The Hawks Nest is a mixed bag. There are some areas that are standing, energetic, and actively singing and supporting (where I have my season tickets). There are other areas with people who are seated on the bleachers and less engaged. Depends a great deal on where you end up sitting."
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,Warvanov,5,Fri Mar 6 21:43:53 2015 UTC,I prefer the SW corner but maybe because that's where my season tickets are. I think the corner is great because it gives you more of a depth perception of what's happening.   128-127-126 are all great sections to try to get tickets with a good view that's close to the action and the ticket prices aren't through the roof.
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,KDFilm,2,Fri Mar 6 18:51:37 2015 UTC,229 sth checking in. Great seats. Everyone I've brought to the game loves them.

SoundersFC,2y5tf8,MalcolmXXY,2,Sat Mar 7 04:36:47 2015 UTC,"Dont sit in the NE corner unless you want to be close to the Timbers fans.  They aren't typically violent, but they can be rude and loud.  Probably not very pro-Sounders either.....  200 level sometimes sits, 100 level mostly stands all game.  121-122-123 are ECS / General Admission -- the guys that get on TV with the banners and signs.  Anywhere on either side of GA can be fun because you hear the chants clearly but aren't typically behind a 2-pole or sign as much.    Middle of the stadium is calmer on average than either end zone.   But for Portland its typically a lively crowd everywhere.   Welcome!  Source: season ticket holder since 2009"
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,my_lucid_nightmare,1 point,Sat Mar 7 19:05:41 2015 UTC,"Agreed - avoiding the NE corner (300-304, 100-104) is the best advice. Especially on a Timbers or Vancouver match."
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,cwcoleman,2,Sun Mar 8 17:39:08 2015 UTC,Southwest corner is best. If you end up sitting in the 300s take the stairs instead of the ramps. It's easily twice as fast. Don't forget to march to the match. Especially for SEAvPOR
SoundersFC,2y5tf8,eriknordheim,1 point,Sun Mar 8 22:56:31 2015 UTC,There really aren't bad seats at the CLink. I personally like goal side (north & south) seats for watching Sounders. You can get cheap and great seats at the Hawks Nest on the north side or seats adjacent to the ECS in the south side.

I've been to a few in the 300 level and I can say it's very easy to see the game and see what's going on.  Plus you get to see the ""FIFA"" view so you can see tactically what's going on with the higher angle.    Personally I prefer to be closer to the ECS because I like jumping around and singing and drinking.  Makes for a fun time!"

Dempsey is what made me a Sounders supporter, truth be told. Being a fellow Texan, I've followed him and enjoyed watching him play. I wasn't into MLS until Beckham came over here, then I watched intermittently. Now I never miss a game, no matter who's playing really. I definitely don't miss a Sounders game though if I can help it"
SoundersFC,2y3h28,pete_is_writing23,1 point,Fri Mar 6 21:52:53 2015 UTC,Same here.  Dempsey got me into soccer and his Texas roots was 1/2 of what made me a Sounders supporter.  The other is going to Seattle at least once a year and always having a great time up there.

SoundersFC,2y2bn6,Newbman,1 point,Fri Mar 6 02:59:02 2015 UTC,The stadium store usually closes around five or six PM. The one downtown is generally open later. I stopped by after I was off work at seven and picked up last years home jersey on clearance for $45 with tax.
SoundersFC,2y2bn6,Warvanov,1 point,Fri Mar 6 08:16:02 2015 UTC,So getting a jersey with a name on the back costs an extra $30. It really doesn't seem worth it. Is it possible to buy it and get the name added later?
SoundersFC,2y2bn6,IzzyIzzyIzyy,2,Fri Mar 6 03:16:06 2015 UTC,"Possibly, but they always suggest getting them customized before you give the kit its first wash. It has a hard time sticking to the cloth if you do it afterwards."

SoundersFC,2y1m8o,AlienMutantRobotDog,3,Thu Mar 5 23:27:27 2015 UTC,"While a first place finish and competing for the Supporters Shield is very possible, I think a 2nd or 3rd place finish is probably more likely for Seattle in 2015.   That's the feeling I'm getting from the team so far watching the offseason for all the teams. It's not to say I think the team is bad, I just think we're not as great as we were last year and there is going to be stronger competition than just LA to get the top spot in the conference. I'm perfectly happy with a 2nd or 3rd seed, keeps us out of the wildcard game and gives us a great shot at the MLS Cup."
SoundersFC,2y1m8o,Audicity,2,Thu Mar 5 22:31:24 2015 UTC,This was an awesome read.  As if I wasn't already excited enough for Sunday!
SoundersFC,2y1m8o,AgentMulder_FBI,2,Thu Mar 5 21:30:29 2015 UTC,Do that many people still really criticize sigi? I've got my reservations about our backline and the scary prospect of our midfield without Ozzie. Sigi is low on the list of concerns anyway.
SoundersFC,2y1m8o,foxpawz,1 point,Fri Mar 6 06:23:21 2015 UTC,"I can certainly agree with that specific list... but, I live in Alabama so understand much of my opinion is formed based on social media and various websites. I don't get the opportunity but once or twice a year to go to a match and most of those that I end up sitting around are pretty fair weather in the sense that they follow wins and losses and not much else. I couldn't tell you the barometer as a fan base but I know its still a thing.  IMO, pundits also gloss over Sigi, his accomplishments and his tactical competencies. He gets much less consideration because he doesn't have as many MLS Cups as Arena and his teams are less theatrical (read as: more consistent) than Dom Kinnear.   I couldn't cite specific sites (and I wouldn't link them anyways) but I know I've seen at least one, maybe two, blogs talking about how Sigi should be fired this off-season and I've seen mentions in SaH too."

The official first opening of TheNINETY for fans for certain is before the match on Sunday.   I could've sworn I'd heard that the Sounders were hosting a viewing party for the season kickoff match Friday night, but I can't find where I saw that so I don't want to say anything definite."
SoundersFC,2y1sx5,planetes,1 point,Thu Mar 5 18:55:04 2015 UTC,"correct me if I'm wrong but historically these are the games most likely to be full dome games, correct?"
SoundersFC,2y1sx5,IzzyIzzyIzyy,2,Fri Mar 6 03:14:59 2015 UTC,Not necessarily.. The driving factor in previous years was the time.  Almost all of them were for early afternoon games (noon - 2pm).. this year is unique in that time doesn't seem to be a factor.. for example the orlando game is 2pm but isn't on the list.  It may be driven by them opening additional sections of the stadium like you're suggesting though which would mean our attendance numbers would jump fairly substantially

SoundersFC,2xtdem,Schwa142,6,Tue Mar 3 18:58:26 2015 UTC,"I really hope there's no strike... I understand the players' position here, but at the same time, it's not something that can be agreed upon immediately.  I'd personally suggest they assemble a team of players and owners to discuss the details over the coming year and work towards a solution that actually makes everyone happy, rather than simple ransom demands...  Edit: Yay!  Deal!  While it may not be to everyone's liking, at least it's a start."
SoundersFC,2xtdem,samfreez,6,Tue Mar 3 19:07:23 2015 UTC,"The problem with that is that the players won't have as much leverage as they do now (2 expansion teams launching) at this point in 2016. They won't be able to get as good of a deal by waiting a year as they can now, with the threat of a strike looming.  I want the season to start just as much as everybody else, but there's no way I'd play with no CBA and no agreement in principle if I was a player."
SoundersFC,2xtdem,randymeeker,1 point,Wed Mar 4 04:49:35 2015 UTC,"The way I see it, they could wind up with even more power come next season.  They'd have the expansion behind them, a boost to visibility and increase in popularity.  Ideally they'd also have been working towards a solution together.    I don't understand the single-entity ownership model argument either, for that matter."
SoundersFC,2xtdem,samfreez,2,Wed Mar 4 05:03:11 2015 UTC,"What I'm saying is the league has a lot invested in those franchises having a successful launch. Orlando City sold out the Citrus Bowl for the season opener and NYCFC will be the only team other than Seattle to have a capacity of over 30k. Any work stoppage puts that in danger and could work against any momentum that has built up for those franchises.   Imagine if there had been a work stoppage just before the Sounders season opener in 2009. This is one of those rare occasions where the owners have more to lose than the players. From the perspective of the players, this is the absolute best time to put as much pressure on the owners as they can. They may never get a better opportunity than this to get the most favorable CBA possible.   Any boost in visibility and popularity brought on by expansion will help the owners and the league much more than it will help the players."
SoundersFC,2xtdem,randymeeker,3,Wed Mar 4 05:11:07 2015 UTC,OCSC having to cancel the #FillTheBowl game would be pretty devastating. Not sure casuals would want to come back to a lesser atmosphere.

SoundersFC,2xlsb1,Somebody_Call911,13,Sun Mar 1 22:27:21 2015 UTC,"We'll do ok, but we always suffer when Ozzie is out. Low possession will be an area to watch. Under pressure, he's one of the best in the league at holding the ball."
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,Immolater,5,Sun Mar 1 22:38:41 2015 UTC,"Also, how we deal with the transition to defense on turnover. When was the last time you saw a team successfully counterattack up the middle against us with Alonso on the field? He either wins the ball, channels it to the wings, or (worst-case) fouls the other player and gives up a free-kick in a harmless area. What he doesn't do is get caught napping in no-man's land, nor does he get beaten on the dribble in those situations. Azira tries, and is a solid player, but he's no Alonso."
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,stealth_sloth,3,Sun Mar 1 22:52:58 2015 UTC,Very true. I don't recall him ever getting caught ball watching.
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,Immolater,5,Sun Mar 1 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"We'll be alright. We'll miss him in a big way, that's for sure, but we'll survive.   Azira has continued his development well over the preseason and shows confidence in both winning and keeping possession. Roldan has also done well though may not be as ready as Azira for the regular season. Rose doesn't keep possession quite as well, but is a calm head with plenty of experience in the side and excels at winning the ball back for us.  It'll be very interesting to see how Azira does in Ozzie's slot, assuming he's the most likely to start there, with a preseason and preparation under his belt knowing that Ozzie will be out for a while. It's a very different proposition from being integrated and thrown in there in the middle of a season based on injuries/rest requirements.  On top of that - and I know as well as anyone, preseason is preseason and doesn't necessarily mean anything, but - we played the Revs using mostly young players and those considered B-team and substitutes and lost 2-1 against what looks to be their first team (an unfortunate own-goal and a dubious penalty gave them their goals, while our forward play looked dangerous and unlucky to score more).  But on the flip side, Ozzie's docs and the team physios have communicated that he's a bit ahead of schedule in his recovery, so we also may not be without him for quite as long as originally expected.   Chins up - our young players are looking very sharp and hungry, our stars have had a pretty good rest and preseason and our FO is more focused and determined than ever (from both public releases and what we see on the media side and behind the scenes). It'll be an interesting year!"
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,hopefulmachines,3,Sun Mar 1 23:02:25 2015 UTC,"What I saw a lot of last night was Azira tackling without a follow up plan.  To be more specific, he (and other Sounders) were executing excellent tackles...that caused the ball to roll free and to another opposition player.  This lead to their goal, by the way.  We need to be smarter about tackling and ball control.  It may be better to pressure and play team defense (trying to force bad passing) than to tackle if we aren't cohesively covering every man in our third.  Azira is strong, fast and tenacious and I see him as having more speed than Alonso.  He just needs to be smarter and think two steps ahead instead of one.  I think he could seriously challenge both Pineda and Alonso for an occasional starting position depending on the tactical situation/match-up with a little improvement to his game.  I was very impressed with him during his Open Cup appearances last season, so I rate him a bit higher than some."
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,rophel,1 point,Sun Mar 1 23:19:10 2015 UTC,"True, but the same can be said of our first team drawing SKC's B-team"
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,hopefulmachines,2,Sun Mar 1 23:26:22 2015 UTC,"Totally true! Which is why I prefaced it by saying that preseason results often end up meaningless. But I threw that in there just as a bit of a positive indication in this circumstance, being that you specifically asked about the Revs."
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,CascadiaKid,4,Mon Mar 2 00:57:05 2015 UTC,Alonso has been one of the Sounders' most important players over the years and they've gone 3-7-3 (.92 points per game) over the past three seasons in matches their Designated Player has missed. The Sounders have gone 47-13-19 (2.02 PPG) with Alonso in the lineup.
SoundersFC,2xlsb1,jaschac,1 point,Mon Mar 2 07:26:05 2015 UTC,"We'll suffer without him, but we will survive. It's not like we've never been without him before.   That said, I'm starting to get worried about the long-term implications. He's made a few cryptic tweets recently. They're probably innocent and I'm almost certainly writing more into them than is there. That said, it wouldn't be the first time we've seen a player go out for a serious injury or surgery and never really recover to their pre-damage state.   Losing Alonso for a few games at the beginning of the season? Survivable. Losing ""the honeybadger"" forever? Incalculable loss."

SoundersFC,2xi56h,ztn,3,Sun Mar 1 00:48:56 2015 UTC,"We are spoiled with good announcers. I had a hard time listening to the announcers for both games against SKC. Andy Gruenebaum wasn't as bad as Benny Feilhaber was today, though."
SoundersFC,2xi56h,canucknuckles,2,Sun Mar 1 02:52:38 2015 UTC,Feilhabers commentary was the only thing that kept me from muting it today. I couldn't stand main commentator he was with.
SoundersFC,2xi56h,canucknuckles,1 point,Sun Mar 1 05:09:27 2015 UTC,"I agree, their main guy is the worst. Every time their defense intercepted a pass he screamed the announcement like it had just secured them a victory."

SoundersFC,2xiq4g,MowwMoww,6,Sun Mar 1 01:48:45 2015 UTC,"Pretty disappointing that our A team couldn't put more pressure on their B team. Their keepers were tremendous but we've got to get some better finishing out of Clint and Oba. It's hard to rate the defense because they were playing against backups but overall it was solid from them. Pappa and Neagle did pretty much nothing.  Edit: Oh, and I actually liked Feilhaber's commentary."
SoundersFC,2xiq4g,Aurick,2,Sun Mar 1 01:49:28 2015 UTC,"Our ability to finish is what I'm really concerned about. It's one thing to go up against a Keeper playing lights out, it's something else entirely when we're consistently missing shots that should have seen the back of the net, like we've been doing all preseason."
SoundersFC,2xiq4g,ajrcoyote,1 point,Sun Mar 1 02:04:59 2015 UTC,"Our A-team definitely seemed off this day, and only got back up in the second half. When we were rolling the keeper made some amazing saves. I don't want to take too much from these games, but I really hope we look better at our home opener. I think it will help a lot when Alonso is back. But I really look forward to the normal season starting and playing some games that really mater."

It's unclear if the 'new entrance' (aka South entrance) is for GA only - where wristbands will be handed out, or if the entrance is still for everyone and only GA people will get the wristbands. It's clear that GA people are forced into this new/south entrance, not allowed to go through the north/other entrances. I'm curious about the upper supporters sections. Lower 121, 122, and 123 are the GA sections. Upper 121, 122, and 123 are assigned seats. Will they be able to come through the 'GA' gate?"

SoundersFC,2xbzo9,morereece,2,Fri Feb 27 08:01:09 2015 UTC,They likely (almost certainly) won't continue producing the old kits.

SoundersFC,2xbzo9,MowwMoww,1 point,Fri Feb 27 13:10:24 2015 UTC,The old ones will very likely be discounted in the pro shop as soon as the new ones are released. Good value if you like them.

SoundersFC,2x6urc,MowwMoww,5,Thu Feb 26 02:54:30 2015 UTC,"Troy Perkins: Couldn't have stopped either goal. Unremarkable.  Oniel Fisher: Looks athletic, but loose with possession.   Zach Scott: Terrible call, can't remember much else, probably a good thing.  Jimmy Ockford: Didn't allow much at goal.  Andres Correa: Makes attacking runs like a NFL fullback. Interchage w/Kovar in the 2nd half looked promising.  Cristian Roldan: Loved his game today: vision, tidy on the ball, tenacity.  Kenny Cooper: Looks solid out wide, had some great touches today.  Darwin Jones: Great work on the assist, subsequently muscled off the ball often.   Andy Rose: Not as effective when the deeper of the two CMs.  Chad Barrett: Reminds me of a gargoyle.   Kevin Parsemain: Similar to Barrett as a poacher and can't do much w/o service.  Aaron Kovar: Lively, offered good service down the left and even had a few tackles.  Damion Lowe: One big mistake, but is strong, recovers quickly and played a nice ball over the top, as well. Hope we bring in another CB and he gets every game at S2."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,bgatz,3,Thu Feb 26 04:38:19 2015 UTC,"I remember a great recovery and blocked shot by Scott in the first half after Ockford let a Revs player get by him for an open look on goal. That's about the only time I noticed Scott before the penalty. I thought the Scott/Lowe duo looked better than Scott/Ockford, but some of that could be due to the New England red card."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,randymeeker,3,Thu Feb 26 16:46:43 2015 UTC,"Andy Rose: Not as effective when the deeper of the two CMs.   I've been saying this for a long time, actually. Rose is a good attacking mid, I don't like him that much as a defensive mid."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,lightjedi5,1 point,Thu Feb 26 20:07:13 2015 UTC,Most effective paired with Alonso or Azira. It's evidenced by Sigi only playing Rose with those two throughout the year.
SoundersFC,2x6urc,bgatz,1 point,Thu Feb 26 23:54:25 2015 UTC,"I'll agree with that. Pineda is too attack minded, so is Roldan I think. Azira and Alonso are both more defensive minded, so it's a better pairing."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,lightjedi5,5,Fri Feb 27 00:23:30 2015 UTC,Pretty tough call on that PK.
SoundersFC,2x6urc,dsn0wman,3,Thu Feb 26 03:21:25 2015 UTC,"A lot of players showing a great deal of confidence, but not always the technical skill to back it up. Bunch of giveaways on speculative efforts.  Which is fine; the judgement will come with experience. But it does underline why these most of those players are not yet challenging to break into our starting XI."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,stealth_sloth,3,Thu Feb 26 03:23:00 2015 UTC,"I thought New England played terribly considering it was mostly their first team against mostly Sounders reserves. As a Sounders fan I tend to see mistakes the Sounders made but I couldn't help but notice tons of giveaways and silly mistakes by the Revs.   The own goal was unfortunate and the penalty was harsh but if you remove those, the Sounders looked pretty good considering who was playing. Fortunately this is a preseason game so The main takeaway is that Sigi got to see how a lot of younger guys would do against real first team opponents.   I can't see how the Sounders lose to this team in the opener if they play all their starters."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,meizer,2,Thu Feb 26 05:40:46 2015 UTC,Once again we got to see kovar provide perfect service again and again. I think with someone in the box to finish those he can have great success. The big decision will be whether or not he will sit on the first team bench or go down to s2
SoundersFC,2x6urc,dogggis,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:25:39 2015 UTC,I wouldnt be surprised to see him get a bunch of minutes in the open cup and first few games ccl.
SoundersFC,2x6urc,randymeeker,1 point,Thu Feb 26 03:58:50 2015 UTC,"He and Correa really combined well on the left side. That seemed to be where most of our chances came from in the second half, albeit with a one man advantage. I think Correa is going to bring a lot of what we lost by selling Yedlin, with the obvious caveat that he has less pace (who doesn't?)."
SoundersFC,2x6urc,BugSTi,0,Thu Feb 26 16:43:36 2015 UTC,Why can't we finish? Seems to be a trend I've seen from last year. Nearly every team looks better inside the box than we do. The goals we do get often times are pure luck (see oba's rainbow goal vs SJ's Jon Busch)  I don't know. That game was just frustrating to watch.
SoundersFC,2x6urc,BugSTi,8,Thu Feb 26 03:00:19 2015 UTC,There was one starter playing.
SoundersFC,2x6urc,banemaler,2,Thu Feb 26 03:01:22 2015 UTC,"Fair enough - It just seemed like even when it was vs 10 and we ran down the line, it went wide/over/short and ultimately out.   Here is my couch coach strategy for the next few days - nail open play crosses into the box."
SoundersFC,2x517x,BugSTi,5,Wed Feb 25 18:44:59 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up, the final game seeding will not only be determined by record:   The standings after tonight’s game will help determine the pairings for the tournament’s final round on Saturday. However, seeding will not be the only factor considered. “One of the stipulations are that they can create matchups in the last set of games so you’re not playing a team again, so you’re playing somebody different,” Schmid said. “I think that’s what every wants that’s down here: You don’t want to end up playing two of the four games against the same team.”   Source: http://blog.thenewstribune.com/soccer/2015/02/25/sounders-take-1-1-record-against-winless-revs/"

I think it'd be hilarious of NE benches him for most of the match, but I expect him to be a little chippy. I felt like he was going to be EJ 2.0 for us."
SoundersFC,2x517x,MowwMoww,1 point,Wed Feb 25 23:33:03 2015 UTC,Really strange for a player to be so salty to a team that is responsible for him having a career.
SoundersFC,2x517x,randymeeker,1 point,Thu Feb 26 02:30:27 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't go that far. He had other offers on the table when he signed his HGP deal with the Sounders and I really have a hard time believing he wouldn't have been recruited by schools like Wake Forest if he had played for Crossfire rather than the Sounders Academy.   His previous youth club has produced several MLS talents (Tally Hall, Joey Gjertsen, Nik Besagno, Tim Merritt, Ciaran O'Brien, Darwin Jones)."
SoundersFC,2x517x,randymeeker,1 point,Thu Feb 26 17:10:49 2015 UTC,"Every player looks forward to playing against his former team. I don't have any problem with him being excited to play against Seattle.   I think it was clear that he wasn't going to get MLS playing time here, so the best thing for everybody was a trade. We got good value for him and he got to go to a good team in a weaker conference that doesn't have a ton of depth at his position. I'm glad he got that opportunity and I have no problem with him being motivated to show that he is good enough to be an effective striker in MLS."
SoundersFC,2x517x,thegraduate,2,Thu Feb 26 17:03:25 2015 UTC,"This is cool and all, but I really just want everyone home and healthy ready for the season. It's going to be a long stretch with USOC and CCL this year."

SoundersFC,2x517x,bgatz,1 point,Wed Feb 25 19:15:36 2015 UTC,I couldn't find anything on tie breakers.   We could tie SKC if we tie and SKC loses too.
SoundersFC,2x4agv,alexj757,3,Wed Feb 25 15:27:01 2015 UTC,You can buy it usually from the Sounders website depending on what name you want. There are also a few other sites that you can do it from. But if you live near the city you can buy a blank one and have any name and number put on it at the sports store across the street from the stadium (forget the name). You can also take a blank to an Adidas store and they will put any name and number on it for $12-$15.
SoundersFC,2x4agv,gtg10,1 point,Wed Feb 25 16:16:30 2015 UTC,The Sounders website shows about $115 per kit if I'm not mistaken with any name and number on it. Is this normal and is there any time during the year they go on sale?
SoundersFC,2x4agv,amateur_simian,2,Wed Feb 25 18:14:03 2015 UTC,"There are two tiers of jerseys: authentic and replica.  Replicas usually start around $80 (although right now I'm seeing them priced the same as authentic… might be due to them being low on stock before the new releases?).  Authentic are the same thing they play with on the field.  So wearing it as a shirt isn't its primary purpose, I've had some friends complain that they don't really breathe and they feel weird…  the fabric's designed to be worn soaked through.  So I'd wait for the new jersey reveal, and check out prices for the replicas.  Usually they look pretty much identical, except there's no American flag on the sleeve. The one exception is the shale jersey (not to be confused with pitch black) where the alternate is really a lesser design than the authentic."
SoundersFC,2x4agv,BBQLays,3,Wed Feb 25 20:41:03 2015 UTC,I'd argue that the pitch black replica isn't nearly as cool as the authentic. The fade makes it look so good and the replica lacks that.
SoundersFC,2x4agv,amateur_simian,1 point,Wed Feb 25 21:20:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's fair.  I guess the advice should be to check the replica before buying it, but replicas are what many of the fans wear."
SoundersFC,2x4agv,reazon54,1 point,Wed Feb 25 22:21:51 2015 UTC,totally agree with this. It's the main reason I went with the authentic version

SoundersFC,2wxl6p,MowwMoww,3,Tue Feb 24 17:11:30 2015 UTC,"I want to acknowledge that: Yes, I know this isn't a jersey...    I work near CenturyLink, so I stop in the Pro Shop about once a week to see what's new. I noticed this ladies shirt today. It doesn't really match any of the design elements of any other shirt in the shop. However the white, and the pinstripes (as seen on the leaked green kit), matches up.   Might not be a carbon-copy of the new secondary kit, but could be a preview of what to expect.   Edit: I walked past the team shop today, and all these shirts were gone off the clothing rack, and display mannequins."
SoundersFC,2wxl6p,DronePirate,7,Tue Feb 24 00:26:23 2015 UTC,Nope.  That's the authentic shirt.  These are the shorts.

SoundersFC,2wqec2,bwc_28,2,Sun Feb 22 15:20:45 2015 UTC,Our only weak spot is at CB. Hoping the team is waiting for the CBA and has a quality CB signing waiting in the wings.

SoundersFC,2wodv8,crawfoc9,3,Sat Feb 21 18:30:15 2015 UTC,Will this match be streamed tonight like some of the other Diamond Cup matches?
SoundersFC,2wodv8,villson,3,Sat Feb 21 18:51:33 2015 UTC,I believe all of the official Diamond Cup matches are streamed.
SoundersFC,2wodv8,MowwMoww,2,Sat Feb 21 20:13:03 2015 UTC,Correct
SoundersFC,2wodv8,JustinCasy,1 point,Sat Feb 21 20:35:44 2015 UTC,Yes. You can stream it on Soundersfc.com. The link should be one of the first things you see on the homepage.

SoundersFC,2wkqrv,hashtag_the_shag,2,Sat Feb 21 00:00:20 2015 UTC,I've been wondering the same. It looks like the guys were here end of the summer.  https://twitter.com/hashtag/everystreetunited   I know the Xbox studio that produced it was axed during the big MS culling last year.

SoundersFC,2whkvx,ebeptonian,9,Fri Feb 20 00:03:16 2015 UTC,"Absolutely,  I really like this choice. I hope the Xolo's bring some shirts to sell I would love one."
SoundersFC,2whkvx,steerbell,3,Fri Feb 20 00:07:30 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty happy about this. Honestly as cool as it is to have the Spurs or Man U come, I don't really enjoy watching their second string beat the Sounders. Especially if it's 6-0."
SoundersFC,2whkvx,mcvay206,6,Fri Feb 20 00:14:21 2015 UTC,It was pretty amazing to tie the Spurs though

SoundersFC,2whkvx,JumpinJimRivers,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:32:13 2015 UTC,"I'd look for some on StubHub or the TicketMaster exchange. I imagine a few STH's will sell theirs for face value or close to it, as the match is on a weeknight."
SoundersFC,2whkvx,randymeeker,5,Sat Feb 21 07:41:13 2015 UTC,"Not fond of the timing, nor especially fond of the opponent, but as a prep for CCL...well... can't really argue against that. Filed under ""necessary evil, a""."
SoundersFC,2whkvx,jaschac,5,Fri Feb 20 01:03:33 2015 UTC,My guess is this is a Lagerway move to start down the road to winning CCL. I am OK with it. I really don't need to see a EPL team anymore though I wouldn't mind seeing some German teams in the future.
SoundersFC,2whkvx,steerbell,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:12:27 2015 UTC,"With all the German connections in the organization, you'd think we would've played a German team by now."
SoundersFC,2whkvx,randymeeker,5,Sat Feb 21 07:42:17 2015 UTC,Can we just not have an international friendly next time and throw another playoff match or something into the season ticket package?
SoundersFC,2whkvx,philwelch,2,Fri Feb 20 02:35:28 2015 UTC,Isn't this during an international break?  So all of both clubs' top players will be missing?
SoundersFC,2whkvx,Jdog2010,1 point,Fri Feb 20 06:56:50 2015 UTC,"None of Mexico's recent call ups have included Xolos players. I'd be surprised if more than one of their American players gets called up in March. Juan Arango is the only non-American on their roster that has received a national team call up within the last year, and even he wasn't called up for this month's friendlies.   The Sounders may only be without Dempsey."
SoundersFC,2whkvx,randymeeker,3,Sat Feb 21 07:51:42 2015 UTC,There's still places for an EPL friendly in the summer but this is a good CCL warm up
SoundersFC,2whkvx,kevinplayer,1 point,Fri Feb 20 01:56:49 2015 UTC,This game included with season tickets?
SoundersFC,2whkvx,stealthkatsu,3,Fri Feb 20 05:11:21 2015 UTC,Yep
SoundersFC,2whkvx,samfreez,1 point,Fri Feb 20 05:31:04 2015 UTC,Thanks for the question and answering. It wasn't clear anywhere that I could find.
SoundersFC,2whkvx,michaeltieso,2,Fri Feb 20 18:20:03 2015 UTC,"I got my season tickets yesterday, and was quite pleasantly surprised to see that game listed in with the little calendar they include.  It's also listed in the official announcement on the Sounders website.  Excerpt;  The international friendly is included as part of the Sounders FC full 20-match 2015 season ticket package, which starts as low as $437, as well as the Sky of Blue half-season ticket package, available for only $200. Additionally, single-match tickets are available tomorrow at 10:00 a.m. PST through SoundersFC.com, all Ticketmaster outlets, the CenturyLink Field box office or by calling 877-MLS-GOAL.

SoundersFC,2whkvx,samfreez,1 point,Fri Feb 20 18:25:56 2015 UTC,Meh. Better this than some mid table EPL team as was rumored. More intrigued with the date. I guess this means they expect the CBA to be worked out soon.
SoundersFC,2whkvx,PeteyNice,-4,Fri Feb 20 00:36:05 2015 UTC,"I'd be ok not seeing anymore meaningless friendlies...I don't really care about getting worked over by a European Club or playing against second tier club...you want to get ready for CCL, go to Mexico to play in the preseason.  You want a warm up game, do it on your dime."

SoundersFC,2welqn,MowwMoww,8,Thu Feb 19 06:27:07 2015 UTC,"I know FC Tuscon was tired and demoralized, but Parsemain showed good positioning and great composure with the ball at his feet for both his goals.  I would love to see him score some clutch late goals coming off the bench once the season gets rolling."
SoundersFC,2welqn,banemaler,3,Thu Feb 19 14:30:25 2015 UTC,"It was good. I think the Oba n Dempsey show needs more people involved.  Fact is we can't heavily rely on those two.  If one gets hurt it's going to be tough. Building chemistry with subs and Lamar is key.   As for the second swap of guys they are really jittery and ready to play :P a bit messy but when they chilled out they did alright as well.  Chemistry is key this season, we have great talent but if they can't click then its like having a sports car without an engine."
SoundersFC,2welqn,Dayvido,2,Thu Feb 19 13:57:22 2015 UTC,"I missed most of the game.  Can anyone comment on how some of players we've yet to see play much performed? I'm mainly interested in mears, roldan, ockford, lowe, correa, and I suppose brad at cb."
SoundersFC,2welqn,badkarma765,2,Thu Feb 19 16:12:43 2015 UTC,So I watched it again and really there wasn't much to take away from the match. The competition was just so low that it was basically just a fitness test for the starters.
SoundersFC,2welqn,badkarma765,1 point,Thu Feb 19 20:32:39 2015 UTC,"I'm going to watch it again when I get home in a couple hours. That being said, Sigi praised all of the guys you mentioned I'm the post game interview . My favorite player to watch is kovar so I am excited to see how he develops."
SoundersFC,2welqn,lightjedi5,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:33:39 2015 UTC,Oh yeah kovar! Forgot about him.  I would love to see where his crossing skills are at.  Is there a replay to this game located somewhere?
SoundersFC,2welqn,schmeebasaur,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:44:55 2015 UTC,Im on my phone so I can't really do much but on the front page of this sub there is a link to the mlssoccet page and the stream is there. Also check the mls channel on YouTube if you can't find it. I watched it last night on replay from there.
SoundersFC,2wdpeh,BanksKnowsBest,7,Thu Feb 19 01:27:48 2015 UTC,Too early to jump on the Kevin Parsemain preseason hype train??
SoundersFC,2wdpeh,XthroatCourtesy,8,Thu Feb 19 04:49:55 2015 UTC,"Nah, that train boarded last pre season too.  I like having a confident finisher on the bench."
SoundersFC,2wdpeh,USA_A-OK,4,Thu Feb 19 04:59:54 2015 UTC,"Yeah I was really bummed out when he injured his knee and was out for the season.  Sample size is small and yeah preseason and all, but like you said I think he'll be good at the minimum coming off the bench.  Can't wait to see what he can do though!  Man can't wait for the season to start!!!"
SoundersFC,2wdpeh,XthroatCourtesy,4,Thu Feb 19 05:13:10 2015 UTC,"As USA_A-ok said, he was awesome last year in pre-season. Hype train is in full motion."
SoundersFC,2wdpeh,MowwMoww,4,Thu Feb 19 05:43:21 2015 UTC,Thanks for the link. Checked just in time to see us score.
SoundersFC,2wdpeh,stealth_sloth,6,Thu Feb 19 03:08:24 2015 UTC,"6-0 not a bad result (albeit kind of expected). Shaky moments in the first half defensively at points. But the second half we seemed pretty dominant in possession, and I liked what I saw from Parsemain  and Ockford seemed okay (what little I got to see of him). Can't wait to see how we hold up against SKC in a few days."
SoundersFC,2wete5,tehjimmeh,8,Thu Feb 19 08:10:51 2015 UTC,"I like it. Nice light weight scarf to bring to those hot summer games. If I need a warm scarf I'll bring one of the other 15 Sounders scarfs hanging in my closet. And the design isn't any worse than the last couple years.  I would be disappointed if all future STH scarfs were this style, but its nice to get something a little different."
SoundersFC,2wete5,elpool2,4,Thu Feb 19 09:11:03 2015 UTC,"I don't mind having a lightweight scarf, but the design is fairly underwhelming. It just seems like they played it safe with a simple design that was being distributed to all of the season ticket holders. You can get a lot more detail on a summer scarf like this and I'm a bit disappointed that they didn't chose a more interesting design."
SoundersFC,2wete5,Warvanov,2,Thu Feb 19 17:01:22 2015 UTC,"They also went with a design almost nobody voted for? I guess the pattern was more simplistic than the local native American art feature. I was quite disappointed when I saw which design ""won. """
SoundersFC,2wete5,hackberrydraw,1 point,Thu Feb 19 08:24:56 2015 UTC,I too voted for the N.A. artwork. But current design is ok. Nice to have a summer weight scarf... Wont wear it to matches until May of course...
SoundersFC,2wete5,emerald09,1 point,Thu Feb 19 15:17:16 2015 UTC,How do you know that nobody voted for it? I would have to assume it got the most votes because thats how winning a fan vote works...
SoundersFC,2wete5,kbar7,1 point,Thu Feb 19 22:35:29 2015 UTC,"I just remember near the end of voting last year the other scarf in question was ahead by a really good margin. Like 75% and the other designs comprising the rest. Its entirely possible the chosen design pulled ahead, but it seemed like a lock. Not a big deal at the end of the day and I really like the lightweight style, I had La Barra's summer scarf last year and it was awesome."
SoundersFC,2wete5,hackberrydraw,0,Thu Feb 19 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"Nearly everyone I talked to, myself included, voted for the scarf that won."
SoundersFC,2wete5,kadjar,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:13:05 2015 UTC,YES. This is the garbagiest garbage scarf I've ever seen.   And it's see-through
SoundersFC,2we8vz,RutzPacific,5,Thu Feb 19 04:14:29 2015 UTC,"He doesn't need to take a pay cut; Sounders just have to buy down his contract with the gobs of allocation money they have...the problem is,  with a looming strike and player union negotiations, it is hard for them to go out and get another DP.  With this delay, expect another summer transfer window DP signing.  Most likely a CB or versatile mid."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,sherlocknessmonster,2,Thu Feb 19 14:20:00 2015 UTC,"I doubt we would sign a DP centerback, it's possible but they are few and far between in the MLS and i think we can get by with a non-dp CB. A versatile mid DP however, yea absolutely I can see that happening."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,littlenicky174,6,Thu Feb 19 15:19:26 2015 UTC,"Should we take his DP status down if possible: Yes  Should we replace him: No, but that's not what this is about.  I love Ozzie, but a defensive midfielder isn't what I want a team spending a very valuable DP spot on."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,MowwMoww,7,Thu Feb 19 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how knocking him out of a DP slot would effect the salary cap or any of that. But, I do know Ozzie is easily one of the best 3 players on the team and arguably a top 10 player in the league. If you don't believe me just look at the Sounders record when he doesn't play. According to Sounders At Heart over the past 3 years the Sounders are 3-7-3 in games that Ozzie has missed. Compare that to a 47-13-19 record in games that Ozzie plays in. The fact is Ozzie wins games and I couldn't think of a better way to spend a DP slot than on a player who has such a positive effect on the teams win/loss record."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,CascadiaKid,2,Thu Feb 19 07:28:54 2015 UTC,"If we can bring him down to the league maximum, then we free open a dp spot. And he isn't an int. Spot anymore because he is an American citizen"
SoundersFC,2we8vz,MowwMoww,1 point,Thu Feb 19 07:55:09 2015 UTC,"Ozzie is fantastic, but when that money can be spent on someone like Giovinco, it's not even close to worth it."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,CascadiaKid,3,Thu Feb 19 07:46:10 2015 UTC,There is a lot more to winning games than scoring goals. I think we'll agree to disagree on this one.
SoundersFC,2we8vz,MowwMoww,2,Thu Feb 19 07:55:31 2015 UTC,"There is a lot more to winning games than scoring goals. Unfortunately, that isn't the case in MLS. Just look up the top teams' statistics."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,CascadiaKid,2,Thu Feb 19 07:56:25 2015 UTC,"Of course the best teams score a lot of goals. But, the teams that are consistently good like Seattle, L.A., and Salt Lake have a combination of goal scorers and guys in the middle of the field like Bekerman, Ozzie, and Juninho."
SoundersFC,2we8vz,steerbell,-2,Thu Feb 19 08:25:08 2015 UTC,"Exactly. That's what I was thinking. Love the guy, but shouldn't use a dp on a defensive mid"
SoundersFC,2we8vz,Wineguy33,1 point,Thu Feb 19 07:52:35 2015 UTC,They will if they can depending on the new CBA
SoundersFC,2we8vz,needfoodnow,1 point,Thu Feb 19 16:17:23 2015 UTC,"Buying down Alonso's cap hit is like stepping into quicksand. Will the extra allocation money be available next season? If not, how will the team honor his contract without trading him or scrapping other players? It can probably be done but why has the FO not bought his contract down? The FO has had no problem with pushing the limits of the mls rule book but have not in this case probably bcause it is not a wise move to do so. Maybe a new CBA could change that."
SoundersFC,2wemqe,stealthkatsu,5,Thu Feb 19 06:39:00 2015 UTC,"No one has released any information. Sounders did tease the home jersey so I would expect an announcement soon. As for the away jersey, my best guess is either at the same time as the Home jersey announcement or shortly after. I assumed there would be a Jersey Week this year which would usually be late Feb, early March but seeing how teams are just announcing them whenever they want, I am not sure that this will be the case this year.  Whenever they are announced, I would assume that they would begin selling them within a few days."
SoundersFC,2wemqe,IInviteYouToTheParty,1 point,Thu Feb 19 06:56:12 2015 UTC,"According to MLS, they are doing ""Jersey Week"" again. http://www.mlssoccer.com/next  I'm not exactly sure when it will be this year but in past years, it was late Feb."
SoundersFC,2wemqe,Epistemify,1 point,Thu Feb 19 08:02:40 2015 UTC,"Also are we still using those sick black, blue and green secondary jerseys? Because I didn't pick one up last year but I need one.  They were awesome."

SoundersFC,2wemqe,Epistemify,1 point,Thu Feb 19 17:03:10 2015 UTC,The one with the dark blue background and the blue and green stripe.
SoundersFC,2wemqe,JustinCasy,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:06:02 2015 UTC,That was our away kit which is being replaced. Which means you can probably get it at a decent discount assuming you can find your size.
SoundersFC,2wemqe,Epistemify,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:09:13 2015 UTC,NO!!!!  Why would we get rid of the coolest looking kit in the whole MLS?
SoundersFC,2wemqe,IInviteYouToTheParty,1 point,Thu Feb 19 19:10:45 2015 UTC,We have had it for two years. The league has a policy to refresh the jerseys ever other year (with some being offset so each team renews at least one a year).

SoundersFC,2wbq8x,Uncle_Rick,2,Wed Feb 18 17:02:22 2015 UTC,That was a fun game. Lots of goals from the sounders to be happy for. I was most interested in the last 30 minutes. Was it Kevin Parsemain  (sp?) that scored those last two goals? Both looked good.
SoundersFC,2wc63l,shakaloha,2,Wed Feb 18 18:36:54 2015 UTC,"I didn't know we had ECS subgroups, any chance you have a list of the others?  Or specifically if there's one in Boulder?"

SoundersFC,2wc63l,The_Sultan_of_Swing,2,Thu Feb 19 01:54:08 2015 UTC,As a UC Berkeley student it would be great having a viewing spot in the east bay. Going to SF for games is really fun but not always doable.
SoundersFC,2wc63l,LucasAmericano,2,Thu Feb 19 04:17:18 2015 UTC,I spent 5 months down in SF for job and I can say that the SF subgroup was extremely friendly and welcoming. Hope you can continue to grow the ECS reach!
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,vuduwastaken,7,Tue Feb 17 23:17:10 2015 UTC,"I agree that is probably our ideal 11. It makes the most sense from a defensive standpoint and a where-to-play-Evans standpoint.  That midfield had a better GAA than when Evans was playing in it or any other combination. This may have because it forced Yedlin to play more defensively, or it was successful in pinning opposing fullbacks. It also features a bunch of dangerous, offensively minded players which always makes for exciting soccer.  I don't have any issue with that back four. Evans can hold his own with his history winning over 60% of his headers and serving as a secondary target on set pieces. I'm excited to see how a central midfielder's vision translates to distribution from the back and the possibility of him bringing the ball forward himself. My biggest issues are at the outside back positions; Mears has a decent resume by MLS standards, but is coming off some major injuries, and while Leo has been a favorite of mine since '09, but neither he, nor Mears, are going to get younger.  MLS is going to be insane this year. League-wide, this is the most exciting off season I've seen, even if our boy have stood mostly pat (which is generally a good, albeit a boring thing, after such a good season) and I expect the season to meet my expectations. Or there will be a work stoppage, which will also be crazy, albeit more likely to be boring."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,metameh,2,Wed Feb 18 00:36:16 2015 UTC,I hope you are right. I'm expecting Brad to concede some goals.
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,gear7,2,Wed Feb 18 03:35:47 2015 UTC,He may but I expect he could be on par to what Scott was last year if not better.
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,overruns,3,Wed Feb 18 08:36:05 2015 UTC,Im really hoping a CB signing will come after the CBA is ironed out. I hope Evans works out at CB but the fact that we are betting the whole season on Evans becoming a good CB is a bit scary to me. Hopefully a young layer will step up like Lowe or Ockford if Evans doesn't work out. I would predict Scott will move back into the starting line up soon enough.
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,Wineguy33,1 point,Wed Feb 18 15:34:54 2015 UTC,I'd actually like to start Remick at Left back but I think Gonzo will get the nod.
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,randymeeker,2,Wed Feb 18 09:31:56 2015 UTC,I think Correa is probably ahead of Remick right now. Remick will probably spend the season with S2. He needs minutes if he's going to develop into a starting quality MLS fullback. I wouldn't be surprised if Correa wins the starting LB job at some point this season.
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,randymeeker,1 point,Wed Feb 18 18:13:03 2015 UTC,Remick is pretty solid talent and extremely fast (reportedly faster than Yedlin). I don't know anything about Correa. What puts him ahead?
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,smokey815,3,Wed Feb 18 18:52:07 2015 UTC,"A lot of it is minutes. Correa put in 988 minutes last year with Fortaleza and Medellin in the Colombian league.   Correa has also played at a high level for longer than Remick, even though he's 2 years younger. He was a starter for Colombia's youth national team at the U17 and U20 levels.   I think Remick is considered an LB with potential, but he's never really been involved with the US youth national team and he barely played in PDL while he was in college. Only playing a few months per year in college probably set his development back a few years."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,randymeeker,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:15:08 2015 UTC,Great analysis. Thanks!
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,smokey815,4,Thu Feb 19 07:53:15 2015 UTC,"I'm on board with that, though we might see Pappa and Neagle inverted at times.  We need some depth, though.  Fullback spots are pretty shaky, we've only got Scott left at CB, and outside of the starting four mids, I'm not sure I'm ready to rely on anyone for an extended period if we have injury issues.  Up top, I like Barrett well enough, but again, we're going to see a huge drop in relative quality no matter who we have to try and replace."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,randymeeker,3,Wed Feb 18 03:11:41 2015 UTC,"We signed Correa for LB depth. He started every match for Colombia at the 2013 U20 World Cup. We drafted the guy that many scouts seemed to think was the best RB at the combine, so hopefully he'll provide some depth at RB. Azira could fill in at RB in an emergency. Mears can play CB if 2 of Marshall/Scott/Evans aren't available and Lowe/Ockford aren't ready.  In midfield, our depth at CM is pretty good. Roldan was the steal of the draft and Sigi liked him enough as a freshman at UW to get MLS to offer him a GA deal a year ago. When Rose came back from his injury last year, he looked like he was close to being capable of pushing Pineda for a starting role at CM. Azira is probably the closest replacement for Alonso we've ever had.   I think the one spot where we still need to add some depth is on the wings. Darwin Jones will eventually be very good there, but I'm not crazy about throwing him into that role immediately. Maybe Kovar is ready for MLS minutes, but I would imagine that Sigi still sees Cooper and Barrett as options there, because he loves to use one of the wide midfield roles as a sort of third forward. If I had to guess, I'd say our next major signing is a true winger/wide midfielder to be the first option off the bench for Neagle or Pappa."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,smokey815,3,Wed Feb 18 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"I'll be perfectly honest, I forgot about the fullbacks.  And we've got Remick in a pinch.  Content with all that.  Roldan and Rose are great, though Azira is hit or miss for me.  But that's just because of how damn good Ozzie is.   Wings worry me.  I hate playing strikers out there.  We've already got two guys who want to get in the box, we don't need a third who's trying to  do it constantly.  It's fine if they take opportunities to, like I think Pappa and Neagle do, but more than that would actually be problem."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,TheDingo47,3,Wed Feb 18 18:59:26 2015 UTC,"I think the wings are probably the main area the Sounders want to address once the new CBA is signed. I'm okay with a striker like Barrett (who has plenty of MLS experience as a wide midfielder) coming on for Neagle to fill the hybrid winger/third striker role, but I don't think that works as well for Pappa's spot. I think you have to have at least one true midfielder there who is decent in possession.   You're also losing a lot of defensive effort when Neagle comes off, so bringing in a striker for him with Pappa still in the game puts a ton of pressure on our defense. Having a natural wide midfielder who can defend well to come into the game is definitely a need. I think we're losing a lot of that by moving Evans to CB.  I know Correa is capable of playing wide midfield, so he may occasionally be an option there, particularly late in games to protect a lead, but I doubt that he'd be a good long-term solution to wide midfield depth."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,smokey815,2,Wed Feb 18 19:26:27 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I definitely agree there.  We need quality wing depth I think."

SoundersFC,2w8yu5,seqkndy,3,Wed Feb 18 14:21:43 2015 UTC,"Am I the only one who isn't a fan of Brad? He isn't talented enough to crack the starting midfield so Sigi makes up positions for him to play. Sigi has always had a man crush on Brad and honestly since the inaugural season I've felt that Brad has been our weakest player. How about instead of having an excuse to put him on the field we get a real CB, Traore would be a better option than him. And to think that we let a young talented player like Okoli go yet Brad sticks around really bothers me"
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,randymeeker,2,Wed Feb 18 09:26:12 2015 UTC,"Sigi keeps playing Evans because he trusts him. Brad's soccer IQ is off the charts, so from Sigi's perspective, it's almost like having a coach on the pitch when he's in the game. That's an intangible you have to account for, in addition to what he brings to each role Sigi puts him in.   You also have to account for the intangible of Evans being able to play any position in defense or midfield. That's about the equivalent of giving Sigi an extra sub. I honestly can't think of another player in MLS who can and has started at every position in defense and midfield.   If I was Sigi, I'd have a man crush on Evans too, because he gives me a better chance of winning games, no matter where he is on the pitch."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,RIPweaponX,2,Wed Feb 18 18:39:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Additionally, while I don't typically think of Evans as CB material, he is one of those players who is 110% committed to whatever position he is placed in.  He may not play it perfectly, but he will put his heart and soul into it, and put his body on the line with no reservations.  I have no doubt that what he may lack in size and skill as a CB, he will make up for in soccer IQ and sheer tenacity.  I see him as the type of player that would risk any injury if it meant stopping a goal, which sometimes counts way more in a defender than  any size or experience."
SoundersFC,2w8yu5,stealth_sloth,1 point,Wed Feb 18 19:35:13 2015 UTC,"Evans is probably the exact player Joe Roth has in mind when he says things like ""blue collar"" and ""run through walls"", as much as it annoys me when he says things like that."

Usually Gorilla FC and/or the North End Faithful also have a smaller away section next to ECS that might be more family friendly."
SoundersFC,2w3d4h,BugSTi,2,Mon Feb 16 20:05:35 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. I'd look into ecs. They usually set up travel group and tickets for the supporters sections.

As far as bussing up with us, some people have kids but honestly not many come up to Vancouver. We have lots of booze on the bus and people get pretty crazy sometimes. Also to keep in mind, this is an all day trip. We leave early in the morning and won't get back until late at night possibly not until the next day. If you haven't ridden on a bus with us before I wouldn't bring your kids the first time because there will be lots of drinking and cussing especially the closer we get to Vancouver.  That said, sometimes they have tickets that are just game tickets but those aren't always available and you would still need to buy a membership or two.  TL;DR: Tickets are gonna be twice what you think buying through ECS because memberships and Vancouver is not a good away trip to bring little kids."

SoundersFC,2vqkcm,hopefulmachines,3,Fri Feb 13 05:23:44 2015 UTC,"Re: SSFC font - The fonts in the badge are modified versions of Eurostile (""SEATTLE"") and Verlag (""SOUNDERS FC""). You can really see how close Verlag is to the modified version used in the badge, so if you want to use those fonts in elements on the sub you'll really be keeping with the club's style uniformly.  If nobody else has anything already done, I can create SVGs (with massive PSD files as well, to be downsized to whatever size needed) for you so that things won't be fuzzy, if you like? Easy enough to do, and then things can be crisp and sharp.  The media relations team in the FO has been shaken up in the offseason, so if you need current contact info let me know.  Everything looks awesome though! Good times."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,hopefulmachines,2,Fri Feb 13 08:44:38 2015 UTC,"As far as the Verlag/Eurostile fonts go, they don't really get close enough unfortunately. Seems like they just used those for the straight lines and paid a designer to make a full custom font.  If you'd like to whip something up that'd be great. Fonts aren't my strong suit really.  As for the media relations, I've been working with Michael Ferris, but Shane is moving up rapidly it seems. I suspect he is the go-to guy this season."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,hopefulmachines,2,Fri Feb 13 08:49:14 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to create an entire font, that's far too much work and just about crazy. But for sub elements, Verlag is close enough that it will look uniform and crisp. The header image being fuzzy was what I was talking about - anything like that I can create scalable graphics and extra-large psd/jpg files for downward scaling so that things stay sharp.  The media contact guys now are Alex Caulfield (new senior director of communications) and Matt Winter (communications coordinator), they're our new (well, Matt isn't new) contacts for anything media related. Branden Griffeth is the contact for S2 and also is the digital media coordinator."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,hopefulmachines,1 point,Fri Feb 13 09:01:32 2015 UTC,"Heh, no I didn't mean create a font, I meant that is what the original guy must have done when creating the text for the logo, because no other combination of fonts match. I'll see about changing the sub font to a combination of those fonts overall, though.   I'll get get in contact with the FO again and see if anything comes of it. They seem to work with the Seattle Times reasonably often."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,jaschac,1 point,Fri Feb 13 09:13:09 2015 UTC,"Oh, yes, haha. Those fonts are quite literally the exact fonts their designer used, modified each slightly and wound up with what we see now in the crest. And if you look at Verlag Black (especially if you look at all caps) you can see just how close it is - their designer didn't modify it much at all. Really, Eurostile wasn't modified much for the ""Seattle"" text either, but Verlag is distinctive enough that it will definitely stand out as being uniform with the crest imagery if you use it in the sub."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,24k_goldfish,1 point,Fri Feb 13 09:26:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I did some research a while back when I was first making the text and I couldn't seem to find an accurate representation of whatever Verlag the designer used. I may have just gotten a bad download of it or something. I'm certainly not a graphic designer."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,jaschac,1 point,Fri Feb 13 09:29:59 2015 UTC,"I spent four years in school with designers, and while I learned a lot about design and font design in particular, they can be the most anal people... haha.  Check this out: Verlag Black  If I get a wild hair up my butt I'll play with it in PS, the club's custom font isn't far off from VB at all. It'd be relatively easy to make something that looks bang-on, really, it's just that font design isn't my passion. Give me image creation and editing any day."
SoundersFC,2vqkcm,AgentMulder_FBI,2,Fri Feb 13 09:35:53 2015 UTC,"FWIW - I'm fine with the current CSS/layout/etc, as I am with the rules. But I also wouldn't object to changes if people have good ideas for them.   Re: S2. Given how much I think the interest, articles, etc will continue to overlap I don't know that I see much point in having a separate sub' for S2. I think, if I were the lone authority here...the /r/MLS el Presidente for Life... I'd probably suggest keeping them together for now, and splitting them off only when/if the volume of S2-specific content was consistently exceeding a comfortable threshold.

What really did it is when I tried to cancel my subscription and realized there's literally no way to do it. They give you zero information on how to cancel and I ended up having to email support to get it done. 3 months later it was canceled.

SoundersFC,2vjftn,Penguin_Rising,13,Wed Feb 11 14:51:15 2015 UTC,Go to the March to the match before the game at occidental park. It starts an hour before kickoff. There's usually a band playing and it being the first game of the season should make it bigger then usual. If you don't go to the March you should still arrive at least a half hour early to the stadium as it can take awhile to get in because of security. Stand and try and pick up some of the more common chants to sing. Where are your seats?
SoundersFC,2vjftn,JustinCasy,4,Wed Feb 11 15:19:39 2015 UTC,"I'm in section 117, So it sounds like it's a whole day event? sweet! Any chance on getting deuce's autograph?"
SoundersFC,2vjftn,JustinCasy,7,Wed Feb 11 15:44:37 2015 UTC,You won't be getting any player autographs while at the game. The best place to do that is at starfire in Tukwilla where they train. On the plus side you'll be sitting pretty close to the Emerald City Supporters which is only going to make your experience better.
SoundersFC,2vjftn,emwilauka,5,Wed Feb 11 17:19:15 2015 UTC,"Occidental Park is in Pioneer Square which is just south of downtown Seattle (and just north of the stadium), so you could make it an all day event by seeing the sights downtown and moving south as the day progresses.  There are lots of great restaurants and bars in Pioneer Square to enjoy before and after the game.  Your seats will be very close to the Emerald City Supporters as well as a few other supporter groups, so you should have no problem hearing the chants/songs.  It will most likely be raining so bring a poncho.  I would also try to avoid buying drinks at the game, it can get expensive."
SoundersFC,2vjftn,kbar7,3,Wed Feb 11 16:53:12 2015 UTC,"Oh I forgot about the rain, yikes! Will all these events still happen if it's raining? And I was planning on getting buzzed before the game around local bars (seems like a non threatening town with amicable fans right?)"
SoundersFC,2vjftn,night_owl,19,Wed Feb 11 18:44:06 2015 UTC,"In Seattle, the rain cancels nothing."
SoundersFC,2vjftn,MessiNeverDives,3,Wed Feb 11 18:48:47 2015 UTC,"And I was planning on getting buzzed before the game around local bars (seems like a non threatening town with amicable fans right?)   This is easy, there are a bunch of bars and restaurants near the stadium and Occidental Park. In fact, the official pre-game bar for the ECS (it's called Fuel) is across the street from the park.   You can pretty much just wander around within the area around the stadium and Pioneer Square and find dozens of places to eat and drink, or just grab a slice of pizza or a sandwich to go. My favorite nearby food spot is Marcella's Creole Cuisine (it's run by NOLA transplants who came to Seattle after hurricane Katrina), which is a couple blocks N. of Occidental Park (and next to the entrance to the tourist trap underground tours).   Unfortunately the only breweries/brewpubs nearby are Elysian and Pyramid, who are both corporate-owned (Elysian was recently bought out by Anheuser Busch),  so if you want to really get a taste of  our dozens of independent local craft brewers you'll need to go a little further than walking distance—and it is definitely worth the time if you are at all into beer, I'm not exaggerating when I say there are dozens in town worth trying. The good news is that you will still find a lot of those craft beers on draft at all those other bars around town.   If you are wearing Sounders colors or neutral colors you will not be bothered at all, but if you are wearing merch from the opposing team you might get heckled in passing a little if you are hanging out around Pioneer Square area before the match, but that is about as bad as it gets unless you are actively instigating something.  This is Seattle, and no one will talk to you or bother you unless you initiate contact with them anyway. Otherwise you will encounter 99.9% extremely friendly and boisterous people who will be happy to welcome you to our city and give you guidance. ECS members even walk around and distribute song cards with the words to all the songs/chants for new fans to join in so keep an eye out for that. Note that public drinking is technically illegal in streets, but it is rampant despite their being lots of cops around so as long as you are somewhat incognito about it you won't get in trouble.   *oh yeah, one final important note: if you are getting beer inside the stadium, be careful about where you buy it. There are abundant and convenient vendors that sell Budweiser products (and Redhook), but those are not the best places to buy beer. Look for the craft beer stands that are posititioned around the outside edges of the concourses, they will have a longer line but also will have much better selection (usually like 6 different local/regional craft beer options)"
SoundersFC,2vjftn,AlienMutantRobotDog,1 point,Wed Feb 11 21:09:56 2015 UTC,"Ponchos are about $5 at the stadium. Buy one of it is raining. Otherwise don't worry about it.  Chat anyone up at a bar or restaurant around the stadium. You'll know them when you see them. Mention it's your first game and you'll make some friends.  Grab a song card before the march in Occidental Park; volunteers hand them out. Do the march and then be sure to head into the stadium right away and explore a bit. Get to your seat early so you can take it all in. If you're in the lower bowl everyone around you will probably be standing the entire match.  Just before the game when everyone gets quiet and sticks their hands in the air, do the same if you like. Watch for section 122 to your left (South) in the first couple rows and there's a person with a giant drum.  Boom. Boom. Clap.  Have a blast!"

Giving time to find your seat, a beverage, and see the teams warm up. I typically get to the bars 1 hour before the march - 4:30pm. There are plenty of options around the stadium, all are friendly (unless you are a fan of the away team, then some are better to avoid). Inside the stadium you'll jump and yell for 45 minutes, take a 15 minute half time, yell and jump for another 45 minutes. Done about 8:30pm. A solid half-day event."

SoundersFC,2vg3el,Audicity,1 point,Tue Feb 10 22:23:00 2015 UTC,"I agree. If you think about it this is tactically Yedlin's replacement. He may not be on the right, but he offers the same speedy youthful wingback type of play going forward. I really like this."
SoundersFC,2vg3el,Nekokeki,6,Wed Feb 11 03:40:04 2015 UTC,"I really can't wait to see how he pans out.  He sounds exciting, and I am ALL for solid and energetic defense with a reputation to create and uphold."

SoundersFC,2vfqel,mcvay206,3,Tue Feb 10 17:37:14 2015 UTC,I agree with the players about free agency but I wonder how the league would recover from a work stoppage. Hockey ended up on an obscure cable channel called VS. after their lockout and is just recently finding its way back into prominence. MLS is young enough and has plenty of casual fans that may not automatically show up when play resumes.
SoundersFC,2vfqel,rasyr,2,Wed Feb 11 06:03:03 2015 UTC,The NHL had 2 season-long lockouts within a decade. I really doubt any MLS work stoppage would last long. The league office doesn't want to threaten the launch of the two expansion clubs and the union knows it.
SoundersFC,2vfqel,randymeeker,1 point,Wed Feb 11 07:37:51 2015 UTC,"They've had 4 in 20 years and it has hurt bad. NHL is my true love, but being in Seattle means no hockey. We have the tips and thunderbirds but the thunderbirds suck (and they're in Kent) and I go to as many tips as I can. Those 4 lockouts were brutal to the fans. I want the players to get more money, but I don't want to miss an entire season of Sounders soccer."
SoundersFC,2vfqel,randymeeker,2,Wed Feb 11 16:11:24 2015 UTC,"I don't think the players or the league can afford an extended work stoppage. They'll come to an agreement before that happens. If there's a strike/lockout, we'll be talking days and weeks, but not months."
SoundersFC,2vfqel,randymeeker,1 point,Wed Feb 11 17:14:20 2015 UTC,Sure hope you're right. I have never experienced a lockout on something I own season tickets to. Do you know if we will be refunded for any amount of time missed? Or does this fuck over the fans?

There would have been no point in continuing left because there were no other defenders in front to beat. Beat the keeper and shoot. Boom, goal.

SoundersFC,2un0b9,IInviteYouToTheParty,2,Tue Feb 3 20:50:20 2015 UTC,It was most likely 50% off because of the new ones coming in with the new MLS logo on them.

I love the pitch black kits myself, but I also really loved the cyan too and it turns out not too many were as fond of them as I was (I'm a goalkeeper, it's in my nature to be obnoxious I guess). Anyway, point is, do what you do, it's all good.  I actually wish the kits were completely monochromatic - make the XBox logo and the name/numbers green too."

SoundersFC,2un0b9,benhelioz,2,Tue Feb 3 17:03:57 2015 UTC,"I was really, extremely, insanely happily surprised at the difference in cut between the replica cut and the authentic shirts. In replicas, I'd be in a women's small or a youth medium. I'd be absolutely swimming in a men's small if I got one.  But I ordered a small in the authentic long-sleeve pitch black shirt, and it fits amazingly well! It's a very different cut - much slimmer, the torso is contoured and isn't a straight-line cut like the replicas are.  If you're alright spending some extra money (and the quality of the fabric and the extra details are so worth it) try out authentic shirts. I'm pretty petite with a bit of muscle - 5'3"" and 125lb - and that small authentic shirt looks and feels great on me."

SoundersFC,2un0b9,Aurick,1 point,Wed Feb 4 02:18:59 2015 UTC,"Have you tried soccer.com? I had a couple bad experiences with the company that the Sounders have outsourced their online pro shop to, so I turned to Eurosport. Much better customer service and usually have a larger stock. They haven't stocked the new MLS kits yet but once they do it's so worth it to go through them.  edit - Also, it's worth it to check todofut.com every once in a while too. They don't have any Sounders gear at all at the moment, but I've never in my life seen sales as incredible as the ones that site runs on a whim. I've gotten (current season) authentic Premier League shirts for as low as $30 because they decided to have a sale on that club's gear that weekend. I was nervous at first that the site or the gear wasn't legit, but it is. Insane."

SoundersFC,2ulhhs,thegodsarepleased,8,Tue Feb 3 03:23:55 2015 UTC,"http://www.soundersfc.com/post/2014/12/19/keep-track-sounders-fc-offseason-transactions  Notable are the retirements of Hahnemann and Traore, signing/drafting of Perkins, Mears, and Roldan. And the loss of Bowen, Okoli, Zaveleta and Ford.  I expect to see an additional large signing at centerback and maybe a midfield position.   Another big change is Garth Lagerwey as GM and president of soccer. This could be potentially big for the future of our club, as he seems to know what is required to create a winning team.  Keep in mind though I know next to NOTHING about college soccer so I can't really say much about any of our other draft picks except Miller is in Germany now and is pretty much a complete bust and we made some slick moves to get Roldan who was projected to go pretty damn quickly, but we snagged him and based on the sound of it can play pretty well, under the guidance of Ozzie and Pineda he may develope into quite the player."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,littlenicky174,4,Tue Feb 3 04:11:56 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say Miller is a complete bust. He is only under contract with the German club for the remainder of their season (Late May). He has expressed interest in joining the Sounders if his time in Germany doesn't open up any better options.
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,IInviteYouToTheParty,3,Tue Feb 3 07:30:40 2015 UTC,"Exactly. We own his rights and he was arguably the top or at least #2 keeper in the draft. Toronto had to spend a first round / top 10 Orr 15 pick for the other. It was a risk worth taking, because it's a huge win for us if we get him in the end."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,Nekokeki,3,Tue Feb 3 07:40:47 2015 UTC,"We also control his MLS rights for 2 years. If it turns out that he's good enough to get a contract in Europe that's worth more than he'd get in MLS or USL Pro, then trading up to pick someone with that kind of talent was definitely a smart move, even if it doesn't wind up working out. You have to take those kinds of risks if you want to be successful."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,randymeeker,2,Wed Feb 4 04:58:56 2015 UTC,Miller is 100% not a bust. They knew he would likely sign with that team; that's why he fell so far in the draft. There's a pretty big chance that he joins the sounders this summer after the season ends in Germany.
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,randymeeker,1 point,Tue Feb 3 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"We also lost Anibaba in the expansion draft. Given minutes played, that's a more significant loss than Bowen, Okoli, and Ford. Coupled with Traore's retirement, we lost 2 experienced CB's who provided depth. I think we'll add at least one CB with pro experience."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,littlenicky174,1 point,Wed Feb 4 04:55:15 2015 UTC,"Minutes played... yes he had quite a few. But he was directly responsible for many mistakes and several goals against us. He was consuming way too much money, far more than his form justified. He is a notable loss (as with any starter or rotational player), but I would guess that whoever fills our other starting CB role will be far better (at least I hope)."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,randymeeker,1 point,Wed Feb 4 15:48:36 2015 UTC,"You could make a similar case for Traore. The fact that a player made more mistakes than we were comfortable with and took up more of the salary budget than we would have liked doesn't mean he's not a notable departure.   Whoever takes his place is probably going to be close to minimum salary, especially if Evans moves to CB. If that happens, then the new CB will have 3 players ahead of him. In that scenario, it doesn't make much sense to sign a $100k+ CB."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,Nekokeki,9,Thu Feb 5 19:04:34 2015 UTC,Would love to dumpster Cooper and his massive contract.
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,littlenicky174,8,Tue Feb 3 04:04:56 2015 UTC,"Yea it would be nice to clear up some cap space, he's a good enough player, but he will not get the start on our team, nor many if any subs if Dempsey, Oba, and Barret stay healthy and in form."
SoundersFC,2ulhhs,Nekokeki,6,Tue Feb 3 04:14:05 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't hate him, he is always putting in his best shift. He's just never going to be a starter and it's shocking how much he makes relative to others. I'm sure once we get some of our kids developed and ready through S2 they'll make that change."
SoundersFC,2uhne4,doublemazaa,20,Mon Feb 2 05:54:29 2015 UTC,"Go check out Sounder at Heart to keep up with the latest and greatest. The core of the team has stayed the same except for Tyrone Mears being signed at RB to replace Deandre Yedlin. The coaches have given him solid ratings so far in pre season. A number of new faces have appeared on trial. Mostly midfielders and one left back. The big centerback signing everyone wants has not happened yet but Ockford and Lowe could possibly be doing well enough to step into the rotation this season. Zavaleta was traded to Toronto which would signal the fact that either there is confidence in the youngsters or a centerback signing is coming soon. The transfer window is not yet open so not too many rumors flying right now. The FO has been active and rumors are that several players have been approached but not ready to move to Seattle (a young Mexican forward for example who may not have been given the green light from his club for a loan either because the Sounders wanted him for a full season or MLS usually insists on an option to buy clause). Preseason games are starting and by the end of February I am guessing we will know who is going to be signed to S2 and who will be first team players. Not as many big splashy signings like other clubs because we have 3 DP's already and a solid team from last season. We do have a lot of allocation dollars so maybe once the CBA is agreed to with the players union, some more signings may appear. Maybe a mid season signing to fill any holes that pop up in the roster depth. the higher salary trialists usually appear towards the end of the training season when the front office mostly knows how the team will be structured and how much money they have left to spend with regards to the salary cap."
SoundersFC,2uhne4,Wineguy33,9,Mon Feb 2 06:32:08 2015 UTC,"That's what I have to keep telling myself after the SB. Sounders Preseason is happening, we look to do really well this year. Pitchers and Catchers report for the Mariners in 18 days, and are looking mighty fine as well.   It's going to be ok."

A few months back (Late September?), I was bored and checking ID's at Revolver, when I glanced at the name on one handed to me, read ""PAPPA, MARCO"", and looked up and lost. My. Shit. I try not to fanboy team members, especially when they had a rare three day weekend (it was a Saturday night after a midday match where he'd nabbed an assist) and I'm on the clock, but I stumbled over my words and tried to show him my ""eternal blue forever green"" tattoo. He was… polite, but distant, as if I'd every so slightly scared him. Fast forward four hours, and as he's leaving after a fair number of vodka tonics, he stops, introduces me to his lady, hugs me with conviction, translated my tattoo, and chats with stars in his eyes about how ""this club, this year? SPECIAL."" I congratulated him on his golden boot at copa centroamericana, he looked floored I knew what it was, and hugged me a second time.  That was the happiest I've ever been, excluding when SSFC wins trophies. Such a wonderful, real, happy dude."

SoundersFC,2u6yc0,mcvay206,7,Fri Jan 30 16:31:58 2015 UTC,The only good thing about Hawks season coming to a close is that there's less than a month and a half till the Sounders start back up! But it's going to be the longest month and a half ever.
SoundersFC,2u6yc0,betacatenin,9,Fri Jan 30 16:38:12 2015 UTC,Ugh I know. I am constantly searching for scraps of news on the team just to satiate my need for anything Sounders. I have only survived this offseason by following transfer news and jersey leaks so far. I think the preseason games will help a bit ;P (Hopefully they have half-decent streams of the games this year).
SoundersFC,2u6yc0,littlenicky174,3,Fri Jan 30 16:43:45 2015 UTC,Watching both the hawks n sounders I think this is why I hold the sounders closer to me. The digging for information and learning players backgrounds and seeing how they like to play. I do the same for the hawks but much deeper for the sounders

SoundersFC,2u848h,cel922,3,Fri Jan 30 19:48:09 2015 UTC,The switch to Q13/JoeTv last season helped a lot for me to watch away games. Only streamed if a match was on ESPN.

SoundersFC,2u848h,john_mcrotten,3,Fri Jan 30 20:19:04 2015 UTC,Potentially. I live in Tacoma and have an $8 indoor HD antenna I bought off of Amazon. JoeTV comes in pretty good most of the time and I get about 30 other channels with little issue.
SoundersFC,2u848h,cel922,1 point,Fri Jan 30 20:23:04 2015 UTC,"Ok, I will try that. Thanks! Any suggestions for a good antenna?"

SoundersFC,2u848h,pal25,2,Sat Jan 31 01:21:45 2015 UTC,I'd spend a little extra on a decent antenna because if it starts cutting out when we're close to goal then your head might explode. I got mine at RadioShack for around $40.

SoundersFC,2u44jz,mkeitel1829,13,Thu Jan 29 19:45:52 2015 UTC,"Unless you have another way to watch matches that aren't nationally televised, yes. Totally worth it. The streaming quality is good and you don't have to even watch the match live. I'm pretty sure the archive goes up pretty quickly."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,bryceabeamish,1 point,Thu Jan 29 19:56:32 2015 UTC,"But What if I want to watch the game live? It's called MLS Live but reading the blackout policy, is any part of it actually live?"
SoundersFC,2u44jz,benfreilich,1 point,Fri Jan 30 05:06:35 2015 UTC,You can watch all other games that aren't broadcast in your area live. It basically makes it possible to follow the league. Also you can still watch condensed matches of blackout games the same day.

SoundersFC,2u44jz,benfreilich,1 point,Sat Jan 31 00:19:19 2015 UTC,"You can ""lie"" using a VPN. I'm sure a tech person could explain more. But yes you can fool MLS live into allowing you to watch Sounders games live in Seattle. Even without being able to watch the Sounders, I still love MLS live for the condensed matches. They get posted about an hour after the match is over and they are 20 mins long."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,gear7,3,Sat Jan 31 03:20:16 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think so. I live about a mile from CenturyLink and deal with blackouts often, but using a VPN has a been a great way to bypass it. Without this option, I probably wouldn't buy it."

I know a few times ESPN would carry the games and then I wouldn't need it but it was nice to have to catch the rest. I probably didn't use it as much as some but I don't regret buying it. The quality is good as well."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,imarealadult,3,Thu Jan 29 21:05:58 2015 UTC,"I've gotten it for the past 4 years and I think it's worth it. the quality is consistently good now and has condensed games posted pretty quickly after games are over. however, it does lack getting to pick home or away feeds and the iPhone/iPad app could be better.   but I mainly watched sounders games and MLS live usually went with the sounders feed just about every time. they did get a lot of nbc sports and espn games though last season and those were all blacked out. I'd check the national broadcast schedule and see how many sounders games you'll miss if you don't have a watchespn login and make your decision."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,moregermanlies,3,Thu Jan 29 21:33:55 2015 UTC,"As a Sounders fan in Arizona, yes. Totally. Even though Seattle gets good national exposure, I've found it worth every penny. Can also follow other WC games since they matter and is chock full of good teams."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,insultant_,2,Thu Jan 29 22:24:26 2015 UTC,"It's pretty great except for the blackout dates. Any game that is nationally televised will be blacked out for anyone in the US. Fun thing is, if you use a proxy from Canada, you can get around it. Also the quality of the stream is usually excellent. Also also it's available to use with Chromecast (which let's you stream right to your TV.)  thumbs up."

SoundersFC,2u44jz,thegraduate,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:55:15 2015 UTC,"MLS Live is quite good for watching on TV. It has pretty good support for Roku, Apple TV, Chromecast, and other devices that are meant to be plugged into your TV."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,Fritzed,1 point,Thu Jan 29 22:59:52 2015 UTC,"My point is, you have to buy an extra box to watch MLS Live on TV. Keep downvoting though."
SoundersFC,2u44jz,thegraduate,0,Fri Jan 30 21:30:53 2015 UTC,and my point is that it is much easier and more convenient for most people to watch things on their TV by using a device that is explicitly made for watching things on TV. The devices that I listed are all relatively common and they may very well already have one.  This isn't a complicated concept.
SoundersFC,2u44jz,Fritzed,0,Fri Jan 30 21:52:44 2015 UTC,"And my point is a Roku or Chromecast can stream to a TV just as easy with a computer. But obviously your opinion is the right one, so I give up."

SoundersFC,2u1h9r,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Thu Jan 29 19:26:54 2015 UTC,"He has played LM (and a bit at forward) before, but I'd say at least 90% of his starts have been as a RM. I'm thinking it would be a rotation of Evans and Kamper on the right and Neagle and Pappa on the left.   Neagle's production was a little better on the left last season than it was on the right, and I like the idea of either him or Pappa starting, with the other coming off the bench with about 25-30 minutes left in the game."

SoundersFC,2tx3v3,cantbeassed,2,Wed Jan 28 20:52:40 2015 UTC,"In a nutshell, yes. W-league is technically a pro-am league, but almost every team operates as amateur, which allows them to field active college players. It's a very competitive league, featuring top-tier college players bound for the NWSL and USWNT, players out of college or internationals hoping to crack into the NWSL, and post-college players who probably COULD play in the NWSL, but opt for the ""real world"" instead, while still wanting to play at a high level for a few months per year. Below the W-league, the WPSL kind of operates as the women's equivalent of the NPSL."

SoundersFC,2ts7jx,radeky,2,Tue Jan 27 05:40:57 2015 UTC,"Can someone give me a clear picture of why replacing the turf is so important?  I get that the field was in bad shape against Houston (I was at that game), but that's due to the corporate event, not really the age of the turf.  I also get that people really want grass.  But do we really expect that grass will hold up through an entire season of Sounders + Seahawks play?"
SoundersFC,2ts7jx,cpnn,-9,Tue Jan 27 03:52:16 2015 UTC,Bad grass > FieldTurf. The ball plays too funny or fast while the surface is too hard. Bad grass has bad pockets which players have dealt with since they were toddlers. FieldTurf actually plays poorly across the whole field and messes up the body.   And the burnt rubber smell reminds fans of ho much the game day experience would be with actual grass. I don;t bu or a second that the Seahawks prefer it. Those guys are getting punished more. Imagine a brand new not broken in wresting mat vs a proper one that has give. That rubber (even with the infill) is a bad product and the Seahawks new it when FieldTurf agreed to replace it early the first time around. Both team's are going to get hurt on it.  When Wilson gets hurt and the blame goes to the turf than we will see a quick change since CenturyLink has provided tens of millions of dollars for upkeep.
SoundersFC,2ts7jx,never-enough-hops,17,Tue Jan 27 05:55:18 2015 UTC,"Bad grass > FieldTurf   I'm calling bullshit. Have you seen Soldier Field in December? How about Washington's field in three years ago when RGIII's knee went sideways? Torn to shit grass is awful... and I have a really hard time imagining any true grass surface surviving the trifecta of Seattle weather, Sounders season and Seahawks season."

I don't mean that in a condescending manner, more that while the turf at the Clink has never been ideal, it's taken a considerable turn for the worse in the past season and a half or so. It's gotten really bad lately, to the point where I'd actually start to worry about our quality in possession because of it. It's fast, it's hard, and it's got a ton of bounce. The Seahawks like it that way (probably wouldn't be going to the Super Bowl if that onside kick hadn't bounced like it did), but it's not good for soccer.   I also get that people really want grass. But do we really expect that grass will hold up through an entire season of Sounders + Seahawks play?   Grass is pretty much a pipedream. We'd all love grass, but I'd rather have the current turf than what the grass would look like after half a season.   Edit: One of the reasons cited for it being better from 2009-12 is because it was replaced every 2 years. This will be this turf's 4th year."

SoundersFC,2ts7jx,radeky,1 point,Tue Jan 27 07:02:01 2015 UTC,"How long have you been following?   I've had season tickets for the last 2 years and I have attended every game but maybe 4 across that time period.  I also went to a number of games before I had season tickets.  I've been a fan for a while.  Not to troll, but bad how?  Is it that the ball bounces up more than it would on a grass field?  How does it deteriorate in a way that causes it to get worse?  Here's my experience with FieldTurf.  Most of the fields feel pretty much the same.  Poorly maintained fields (and old) are harder surfaces.  Which result in faster ball travel.  Memorial Stadium I want to say got some new turf when Reign FC made it their home, which made it significantly softer.. but I haven't played soccer there, so I can't really say how that translates to soccer play.  Here's the deal, I've mostly played football, and I'm not nearly a good enough soccer player to be able to tell you how different turf surfaces affect my ball control.  I can guarantee you that most of the grass out here sucks and has such bumps and hits that it totally affects ball control.  In regards to watching soccer, beyond the unsightliness of big black splotches after corporate events I can't tell a significant difference between FieldTurf and Grass.  I do see a significant difference between EPL, Bundesliga or La Liga play and MLS play.. but I attribute that to overall talent levels rather than field surface.  Lastly, I would argue that the most important trait of our field is consistency and safety.  If it's consistently bouncy or fast, you know how to play on the surface and can adjust.  And then it needs to be safe.  FieldTurf's ability to hold up to not have divots, dirt spots, etc help ensure our players don't get injured running around on it.  I don't know though.  As I've said, I've mostly played football on FieldTurf, and while I play rec soccer, I'm not great, and I don't know how old the various fields are.. but I haven't noticed a difference in the fields."

SoundersFC,2ts7jx,samfreez,2,Tue Jan 27 07:16:11 2015 UTC,"The Seahawks have a different set of priorities. The Sounders don't like the surface getting so packed down, because soccer involves more distance running. Additional packing means less give in the surface and more stress on joints (same idea as running on roads vs. trails); when players are running 6-10 miles per game, it adds up. And the blades of grass getting pressed down over time means they do less to slow a rolling ball.  Neither of those are a big concern for the Seahawks, who don't run nearly as far and generally could care less how a spherical ball rolls along the surface."

I'd put his upside at defender somewhere in Nat Borchers territory, and for forward somewhere in between Will Bruin and Adam Jahn.

SoundersFC,2t8l6p,mudcitysoccer,2,Thu Jan 22 01:19:18 2015 UTC,Are fans allowed to go watch training at Starfire?
SoundersFC,2t8l6p,capnheim,1 point,Thu Jan 22 15:25:04 2015 UTC,Yes. Most practices are open to the public. I believe there was a couple of hundred people out on the first day last season.
SoundersFC,2t8l6p,john_mcrotten,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:18:56 2015 UTC,"Yes! In fact, ECS has a young tradition we're trying to build up of showing up in force on the first day of training. There'll be close to a hundred people, singing, flag waving, coffee, and good times! 9:45am at the back field of starfire, come out!"
SoundersFC,2t8l6p,corpusjuris,1 point,Thu Jan 22 22:28:19 2015 UTC,"Can we go to pretty much any practice that's at Starfire going forward? I'm gonna try to get up to one when they're back for a few days in February, but I don't want to make the drive up if they will tell us to leave."

SoundersFC,2t7asi,nikdahl,5,Wed Jan 21 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed, bummed about the lack of shirt too. I will have to check the store and see if they are going to make a 2015 shirt."

SoundersFC,2t7asi,banemaler,1 point,Fri Jan 23 23:32:38 2015 UTC,Question:  When do people expect to receive these?
SoundersFC,2t7asi,modestthoughts,1 point,Sat Feb 14 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"I'm newish to MLS and supporters groups in general.  Aside from the gear, what are the benefits/perks of joining?"
SoundersFC,2t7asi,modestthoughts,10,Wed Jan 21 21:07:13 2015 UTC,"Well, you get access to the members only forums, which includes the members only ticket exchange, where members will buy/sell/request mostly GA tickets, and group policy is no markups, so you can buy tickets at face value. If you have season tickets already, this is less of a perk, I guess.  You also get access to some ticket pre-sale events (such as the US Open Cup or CONCACAF games). Discounts at local establishments  (including most of the ECS pre-funk bars in Pioneer Square; Fuel, Merchants Cafe, Temple Billiards, etc). ECS organizes away travel for pretty much every Sounders game. So you get access to the buses going up to Vancouver, or down to Portland, and flights to the other cities.  You also get to know you are financially supporting the tifo/choreo displays. Note that the Sounders Front Office itself does not financially support ECS, so all the money is raised by memberships and proceeds from sales (Mentality clothing, for example, but also licensing fees from Red Hook Brewery for the annual ECS beer and stuff like that)"
SoundersFC,2t7asi,Wineguy33,3,Wed Jan 21 22:17:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks for taking the time to answer.  Are there many differences (attitude, activities, volunteering, culture, etc) between the different supporter groups?"
SoundersFC,2t7asi,Nekokeki,2,Wed Jan 21 23:28:24 2015 UTC,"The short answer is ""yes."" Most of the groups are different by virtue of where they sit in the stadium or where the supporters live (like Socal Sound has people who live in Southern California or attached to the group and moved back to Seattle). Some have different charity events. You can check the ECS website here:  https://www.weareecs.com/join/subgroups  Gorilla is a supporters group a bit separate from ECS here:  http://www.gorillafc.com/"
SoundersFC,2t7asi,ViewASCII,1 point,Thu Jan 22 02:45:46 2015 UTC,"I had no idea about the ticket exchange, I really wanted a season ticket, but it just doesn't feel the same unless I'm near the GA section. The best I could find was a corner flag on their opposite side."

SoundersFC,2t7asi,Wineguy33,2,Thu Jan 22 02:58:16 2015 UTC,"You really are. I don't know how they do it, frankly."
SoundersFC,2t7asi,night_owl,1 point,Thu Jan 22 03:17:48 2015 UTC,"To be fair, the scarves are just cheap acrylic and the flags are not very heavy duty. They don't cost a lot to have them made in bulk, and in previous years it was just simple single color screen print t-shirts instead. I think as member's we basically get them at a slight markup over cost. It's an awesome deal no matter how you look at it though. I've paid for memberships even in years where I never even could afford game tix.   Unemployed now though so I'm not getting a membership this year."
SoundersFC,2t7asi,Wineguy33,3,Thu Jan 22 08:09:36 2015 UTC,DM me and I'll send you $30 for a membership.
SoundersFC,2t7asi,IzzyIzzyIzyy,1 point,Thu Jan 22 17:28:28 2015 UTC,"Wow, that is extremely generous of you to offer!  I really love the sense of brotherhood and community among the ECS and Sounders fans in general. But I have to say that I don't think I can accept in good conscience, looking back at my comment it just sounds like someone trolling for charity and I'd feel like I was taking advantage of someone, even though I was completely honest about my situation (I really am unemployed and living on food stamps and barely able to pay my rent this month), I think it sets a bad precedent and encourages dishonest people to come out and try to scam other honest and generous folks. I felt guilty the couple times when I got reddit gold because I think someone wasted their hard-earned dollars on me.  Maybe I'm making a bigger deal than it is over a friendly gesture and the membership cost is little more than buying a pint for a random stranger at the bar, but it means a lot to me and I'd feel guilty about taking advantage of someone's generosity when it could be put to better use.   But after all it is just stuff, right?    I'll get by with my old scarves.   But hey, you still made my day a little brighter just by offering, so thanks!!!"

SoundersFC,2t51zk,mudcitysoccer,1 point,Wed Jan 21 05:08:26 2015 UTC,Pretty much expected we draft another Keeper. A bit surprised we took 2 forwards and no defenders tho.
SoundersFC,2t51zk,adrianp07,0,Wed Jan 21 22:25:59 2015 UTC,This late in the draft I feel like you want to take the best talent on the board and less so a team need. The likelihood of a fourth round defender contributing is pretty low. We already have 3-4 young defenders ranging from a first round pick and more who haven't been used as depth yet. I like that we grabbed the first striker and then a gk. After that it's probably more with the outlook of talent for S2 honestly.  Edit: lol at this getting downvoted. Butthurt Portland fan in here?
SoundersFC,2t51zk,Nekokeki,1 point,Sat Jan 24 18:58:46 2015 UTC,Cool! Used to go to school with Andy Bevin.   This subreddit has one more subscriber
SoundersFC,2t388a,turneresq,5,Tue Jan 20 20:40:36 2015 UTC,"Same account says that they'd be playing a game on the 5th/6th. No chance of that being us, it's not during the midseason All-Star break.  More likely, with the rumors that Spurs are the ASG opponent this year, that it'll be West Ham vs. Spurs with the game being marketed as DeAndre Yedlin's homecoming."
SoundersFC,2t388a,SonOfMechaMummy,0,Tue Jan 20 20:59:03 2015 UTC,YES! My favorite EPL team. I would definitely go to that game.

SoundersFC,2t388a,steerbell,0,Tue Jan 20 20:58:24 2015 UTC,Why not?
SoundersFC,2t388a,RutzPacific,-1,Tue Jan 20 21:20:15 2015 UTC,There is nothing interesting from a soccer standpoint about West Ham. They have no draw I am interested in.
SoundersFC,2t388a,steerbell,0,Tue Jan 20 21:55:23 2015 UTC,I would counter (just my personal opinion) that there is nothing interesting from a friendly in general and that they are just a waste of time.
SoundersFC,2t388a,john_mcrotten,2,Tue Jan 20 22:46:46 2015 UTC,"Friendlies with a BPL team are awesome ways to showcase the development of our league and eventually dissipate the myth of MLS being a retirement league. Plus, if they send some of their a-team, who wouldn't want to see Andy Carroll play? Our defense could learn a lot from a forward like that going against our back line. It's a chance for our boys to learn from a superior team, a chance to grow American soccer, and a chance to see a BPL team live (which likely will never happen for most of us)."
SoundersFC,2t388a,piffey,1 point,Wed Jan 21 16:23:42 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think the biggest thing that comes from the EPL friendly is the two teams execs and coaching staff can meet face to face and make possible connections in the future. It is also a way for Seattle to show we have a good stadium and crowd to get buzz among the players. This is all good. From a watching a soccer game point, not all that interesting."
SoundersFC,2t388a,steerbell,1 point,Wed Jan 21 17:26:41 2015 UTC,On top of that they are also excellent tools for building relationships. Tottenham enjoyed their time here and as more teams come over more organizational relationships are created and that is nothing but good for the league.

SoundersFC,2t388a,TweetPoster,0,Tue Jan 20 20:40:52 2015 UTC,We've got a game every weekend in July and August. I doubt they'd want a midweek friendly (although I could be wrong?).
SoundersFC,2syuna,Somebody_Call911,4,Mon Jan 19 19:52:33 2015 UTC,"If he can stay healthy he'll have plenty of opportunities. I'd expect him to be our starter in CONCACAF and the first three to four USOC games at bare minimum, possibly rotating with Leo in congested MLS schedule weeks too."
SoundersFC,2syuna,SonOfMechaMummy,2,Mon Jan 19 20:32:57 2015 UTC,"I think he could be a good fill in for Leo as he isn't getting any younger. But are you saying you want him to fill in on the Right? if that's what you are saying, no thank you.  I would look for that english dude (Mears I think) we signed to be the starting RB."
SoundersFC,2syuna,SalvinY7,2,Mon Jan 19 22:21:25 2015 UTC,"i dont remember him being absolutely at all. i remember a lot of good from him, injuries derailed. i see us inverted our wing pattern then with evans staying on as RB hopefully, more defensive but smart runs (ala gonzalez) with remick bombing up like yedlin."
SoundersFC,2syuna,iamnotbadger,1 point,Mon Jan 19 20:22:13 2015 UTC,"I don't think he looked particularly good in that 5-0 loss at New England or whoever, but it's been awhile, and he was surely not the only one at fault regardless"
SoundersFC,2syuna,saidnamyzO,3,Mon Jan 19 20:46:18 2015 UTC,"To be fair, NOBODY looked good that game.  That was probably the hardest Sounders game to watch last year."
SoundersFC,2syuna,stealth_sloth,3,Tue Jan 20 03:40:19 2015 UTC,"Perhaps you are thinking of Yedlin, who looked awful that game and Sigi actually specifically called out? Remick didn't play in that match against New England. At all.  He played all 90 of our first 4 matches while Leo was injured, and looked great doing it - so good that there was a growing camp arguing he should keep the starting spot when Leo became available again. But Sigi went back to Leo for the next three matches, and Remick sat them out (except for one minute as a time-wasting sub in one). Then Leo needed a rest and Remick stepped in again; he played all 90 against Colorado on April 26th (and generally impressed). Hhe started against Philadelphia on May 3rd, got injured, and was subbed out in the 51st minute.  And... that's injury nearly marked the end of his 2014 season (the New England game, which he missed, was a week later). From then on, the only games he played more than a handful of garbage-time minutes are   15 minutes vs. RSL (May 31st, after which the club put him officially on the injured list to let his adductor strain heal) 81 minutes July 28th against Galaxy (in which he did horribly, but to be fair... he'd spent more than a month without training, and over two months without competitive minutes... and our entire back line looked awful that game without Chad Marshall to steady it) 90 minutes on September 20th against NYRB (in which he once again did badly... but he was part of what was essentially a B-team playing on the road against NYRB with only a few days to prepare after the USOC final in Philly midweek).   It's fair to say he didn't exactly impress in any of his few appearances after being subbed out for injury against Philadelphia on May 3rd. On the other hand... when he was fully fit and healthy, playing week after week, he generally did great. When he was struggling to recover from injury and get back in shape, while only playing one game every couple months - generally with a non-standard starting lineup around him - he did badly. So I don't know how much to read in to that."
SoundersFC,2syuna,Nekokeki,2,Wed Jan 21 06:32:22 2015 UTC,"I agree with this. He did give up a silly pk, but then again so has Yedlin. That's a part of learning."
SoundersFC,2syuna,gear7,1 point,Sat Jan 24 19:02:01 2015 UTC,He also started in the 4-1 loss in NY
SoundersFC,2syuna,MowwMoww,2,Mon Jan 19 21:31:24 2015 UTC,"I suspect Leo will be out more than he was last season due to age and Remick will slot in. That being said, I thought the same thing last season and instead Sigi put Zach Scott and other guys back there and it ended up working to a certain degree, so we'll see."
SoundersFC,2syuna,metameh,2,Mon Jan 19 23:11:15 2015 UTC,I think he's the backup/rotational guy for Leo this year while Kovar matures in S2.
SoundersFC,2syuna,pamtastrophe,1 point,Tue Jan 20 00:22:29 2015 UTC,"I think he will have more of an impact this year, but won't be a main starter. He has played opposite of Yedlin, so I don't see him being a replacement per se, but I can see him doing similar runs forward.   With this past year, I think he's had a great opportunity to study more and get more practice in, so he isn't torn to pieces.  I also just really hope he gets to play more. He's a super nice guy and I want people like that to do well."
SoundersFC,2syuna,littlenicky174,1 point,Tue Jan 20 01:51:19 2015 UTC,"A bigger one I hope, I know he is still a little rough, and technically he has a lot to work on, but I have high hopes for him. Leo is getting a bit older, and Remick has had ample time to learn the position and what it requires. Hopefully he can provide some fresh legs for Leo late in games, and maybe even get some more starts as Leo winds down.  However he does Not fill yedlin's position, Mears has that job for now I think, and Remick has always played at left back, I'm not sure if the transition to right back would be neccessary or beneficial to us, considering we have Mears and his experience at that position.  Funny side note, according to this page Sigi said Remick can play at centerback. I have never seen him do so and I am frankly doubtful about that, however that would be a funny and terrifying experiment (Lets really hope we get some much needed depth in our CB position soon.)"
SoundersFC,2syuna,Nekokeki,1 point,Tue Jan 20 03:28:07 2015 UTC,Remick is a LB. He won't be filling in for Teflon. He could become a starting LB though.
SoundersFC,2symzd,jaschac,8,Mon Jan 19 18:58:12 2015 UTC,"Damn. This is what a lot of us were afraid of. Draft pick wasted, traded away a good (albeit not a starting-11) player. Nothing to show for it.     The only thing that makes me feel a little better is that it doesn't sound like he has much of an opinion of our league. I'd rather have players that WANT to play than someone that things they're ""stepping down"" or ""doing us a favor""."
SoundersFC,2symzd,Nekokeki,1 point,Mon Jan 19 19:00:07 2015 UTC,"Not over yet, we hold his rights. Ultimately we could still sign him in time. I feel your sentiment though as I also liked Okoli. Then again, we have heaps of new exciting attacking players coming through."
SoundersFC,2symzd,trickjarrett,7,Sat Jan 24 19:05:50 2015 UTC,We rolled the dice and got a 7. It happens. And who knows perhaps we still get him and his rights after he has some time to play in Europe.  shrug

SoundersFC,2symzd,USA_A-OK,5,Tue Jan 20 08:03:15 2015 UTC,His contract only goes til the end of their season. He could be with Seattle in the summer depending on how it goes.
SoundersFC,2symzd,metameh,5,Mon Jan 19 22:22:46 2015 UTC,"My understanding of the German fourth division is a regional league. It looks like he could be getting chances against the reserve teams of Mainz.  First division teams in nearby states include Leverkusen, Dortmund, Moenchengladbach, Schalke, and Koeln to the north, E. Frankfurt to the east, and Hoffenheim, Stuttgart, and Freiberg to the southeast.  Nearby Second division teams include Kaiserslautern, Frankfurt, Darmstadt, Sandhausen, Karlsruhe, and Duesseldorf.  The city of Zweibruecken had an US air base as recently as 1991, and a nearby town still has an army base, so adjusting to life in Germany may be easier for Miller if he connects with those networks."

SoundersFC,2sskl1,Somebody_Call911,3,Sun Jan 18 02:21:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's probably going to see all his time in S2 this year.   In terms of game effectiveness as a CM right now he's probably behind Ossie, Pineda, Evans, Rose and Azira.   My guess is that he's probably two years away from being a like for like replacement for Pineda. At the moment his problem is that Andy Rose does exactly what he does, but is likely a better finisher and aerial presence."
SoundersFC,2sskl1,itsOKillwait,2,Sun Jan 18 05:02:47 2015 UTC,"Here's how I see it right now:  Box to Box CM: Pineda, Rose, Evans, Roldan, Azira, Long Defensive Mid: Alonso, Azira, Rose, Roldan, Evans, Long  Because I don't expect Evans to play much at CM (unless Sigi wants to try 4-3-3 again), I think Roldan could find some first team minutes this season as the third option behind Pineda and Rose. I think he's going to really push Rose for CM minutes off the bench. I think he'll see some time with S2, but I also expect to see him in the 18 in MLS more than a few times. I think he could also get some minutes in CCL and in the Open Cup with the first team.  I really don't think Sigi and Lagerwey fist bumped after trading up to take Roldan because they see him as a 2 year project. Sigi got MLS to offer him a GA deal last year because he likes his game a lot. I think Sigi sees Roldan as someone who will be useful to the first team this year."
SoundersFC,2sskl1,randymeeker,1 point,Sun Jan 18 08:35:14 2015 UTC,"Judging only from his highlights, Roldan is an incomplete project, but one we should be excited about. He has a similar sense of balance as Ozzie and is able to turn out of out of challenges and find open space ahead. He also shows a likeness in his proclivity for tidy, high percentage passes that keep the midfield moving. What I haven't seen is his work rate or his defending, so I can't comment on that."
SoundersFC,2sr9i4,adrianp07,11,Sat Jan 17 19:12:20 2015 UTC,I don't know any details but I DO know that we've used only a fraction of our yedlin transfer money. So hopefully we bring in another 1st team center back that can provide some Chad Marshall-like solidly in the back
SoundersFC,2sr9i4,WizE206,2,Sat Jan 17 19:48:06 2015 UTC,"A very small fraction at that. We're good, and we still have plenty of time to make big moves. I'm sure a big part of our plan has been to wait for Lagerway to get on board for any big acquisitions this offseason."
SoundersFC,2sr9i4,Aurick,5,Sat Jan 17 22:51:35 2015 UTC,"Mears can also play a solid CB role. It was suggested/hinted that, because of his age/injury-history/etc, combined with the physicality of MLS, he might be better in that role. That he might not have the pace to provide that kind of fast-attack/wing-back/for-all-90-minute that Yedlin did.   But yeah, I'd still like to see a little more money splashed around that back-line."

SoundersFC,2snt24,_Bt,5,Fri Jan 16 19:54:00 2015 UTC,"Just wanted to share: This is a pretty great deal, seats are in the midfield section on the 300 level. My family picked up a set of 4 tickets on the ""Blue"" plan. It's a little less of a time/money commitment- if you can't do the full season."
SoundersFC,2snt24,john_mcrotten,2,Fri Jan 16 19:55:43 2015 UTC,The other great thing about these is that you still get the benefits of Match Pass like full season ticket holders.
SoundersFC,2snt24,Aurick,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:22:22 2015 UTC,"You get the Match Pass for ticket-scanning but last I heard, the half-season ticket holders didn't earn points. Is that incorrect?"

SoundersFC,2snt24,MajorDefault,2,Sun Jan 18 03:03:56 2015 UTC,How are the seats up there?
SoundersFC,2snt24,foxpawz,6,Fri Jan 16 21:10:07 2015 UTC,Legitimately no bad seat in the house. I've sat at almost every vantage in that stadium. The benefit of being high up is you have a great view of all the players movements. When you're down really low the perspective skews and it's sometimes hard to figure what's going on.   And it sounds like these are in the front of the upper level at mid field.
SoundersFC,2snt24,jaschac,1 point,Fri Jan 16 21:43:43 2015 UTC,"I can back that claim up. I got the four-ticket pack back in 2012 (four, all-stadium games). The seats we had were so high that birds were flying below us. :)   But damn if it wasn't still a great view of the field. And like Fox' says it really changes your appreciation of the game to see the full field at once. Totally worth it."
SoundersFC,2snt24,juiceboxzero,1 point,Sat Jan 17 07:12:15 2015 UTC,"For my money, the best seats in the house are in the lower rows of the 300 level.  Can see everything.  When you get high up in the 300s though, the field starts to get a bit far away."
SoundersFC,2snt24,randymeeker,2,Sun Jan 18 01:45:17 2015 UTC,"Not only do you get a great view of the entire pitch and exactly what is going on, as the others have pointed out, but when I had tickets up there for the Supporters Shield clinching match, just about everybody was standing. I came in with the impression that I would have to sacrifice atmosphere, but a lot of us joined in on a lot of the chants. I'd definitely get tickets there again."
SoundersFC,2snt24,PeteyNice,2,Sat Jan 17 08:52:45 2015 UTC,So excited! Did the Vancouver + LA two game plan at the end of last season and loved it.

SoundersFC,2snt24,TheGreatSpagett,1 point,Fri Jan 16 22:06:33 2015 UTC,"One thing that confuses me, these are 300-level.  Does that assume that every game is going to be open upper deck?"
SoundersFC,2snt24,joylongdivision,5,Fri Jan 16 22:50:56 2015 UTC,A portion of the upper deck is open for every game. It's only for big important games that they open the entire thing.
SoundersFC,2snt24,gear7,2,Fri Jan 16 23:21:21 2015 UTC,My seat is in an area that was not open last season except in the 6 full stadium games.
SoundersFC,2snt24,randymeeker,1 point,Sat Jan 17 08:04:05 2015 UTC,"The portion of the 300 level that was previously open was the first few rows in each section, also known as charter seats. These seats are higher up than those seats and represent an expansion of the base capacity for all home matches.   Depending on how well these sell, we could see the base capacity rise above 40,000, which would make it easier to sell out the games for which they sell tickets for the entire 300 level."

SoundersFC,2sjm2o,smokey815,2,Thu Jan 15 19:41:52 2015 UTC,"He played centrally all through college, and I see him as an Alonso-type player."
SoundersFC,2sjm2o,BrokenClockwerk,1 point,Thu Jan 15 21:12:28 2015 UTC,"Kind of assumed he was more of an attacker due to his size.  Don't know how well he'd play as a DM at 5'8"""

His similarities to Alonso are more in terms of possession, but he's not as much of a ball winner as Alonso is."
SoundersFC,2sjm2o,randymeeker,0,Thu Jan 15 23:18:22 2015 UTC,"http://www.sounderatheart.com/2015/1/15/7553009/sounders-select-cristian-roldan-after-trading-up   UW Coach Clark recently told Sounder at Heart that Roldan may need to be more of a defensive mid in MLS, where his passing skill would be more pace-setting than playmaking. In watching his play as a Husky he's played as a CAM, CM and CDM. So the consistent part is that he plays centrally."

SoundersFC,2sjm2o,MasonGuy,2,Thu Jan 15 21:48:33 2015 UTC,Christian was a steal. Couldn't have had a better draft. RB depth and a possibly a keeper who arguably was the best in the draft for trading Okoli as well.
SoundersFC,2sjm2o,Nekokeki,2,Sat Jan 17 21:32:01 2015 UTC,Good stuff. Have you seen a lot of the highlight reels for some of these dudes taken in the draft? More like mediumlight reels.
SoundersFC,2sjm2o,DocHobbes_,1 point,Thu Jan 15 19:29:54 2015 UTC,This is exactly why MLS did not sign as many GA contracts this draft.
SoundersFC,2sjm2o,TheChoke,1 point,Thu Jan 15 23:50:54 2015 UTC,For the most part I do not see many starters in this draft. I see USL for most of these guys first year or two.

SoundersFC,2sl7fe,Nekokeki,2,Fri Jan 16 18:08:54 2015 UTC,The GK pick is really underrated. This guy is training in Germany and maybe we don't get him in the end or maybe we do 6 months from now. He was arguably the best GK in the draft though and we got him for nothing I'm the second round.It's also a position of need. Great stuff.

SoundersFC,2sl7fe,metameh,2,Fri Jan 16 04:38:57 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiments about the draft, although, I probably wouldn't give the Sounders an A, I'd lean towards more of a B+.  But that is mostly because I feel we are so lacking at centerback.  Hopefully the FO either know something about one of our current players that I don't know OR they are wooing someone from abroad.   Just as a side note - I didn't realize we had drafted Carrasco.  It sounds like he's headed to SKC, hopefully that will be a place he can find a niche and grow."
SoundersFC,2sl7fe,MagnoliaSeattleFan,7,Fri Jan 16 04:58:19 2015 UTC,"We definitely aren't rich in depth in the backline but we need of a solid anchor alongside Marshall. In my mind, we aren't going to find that in the draft. We should definitely be looking for a signing for it though."
SoundersFC,2sl7fe,metameh,3,Fri Jan 16 05:08:56 2015 UTC,I don't think there was a need to draft a center back when we have Lowe and the rights to Zavaleta.
SoundersFC,2sl7fe,thebubbazanetti,1 point,Fri Jan 16 05:44:09 2015 UTC,"I would agree with that if I felt that either of them were actually proven.  Both are pretty questionable to me as Zavaleta built most of his skills at Chivas and Lowe missed a lot of skill-building time by being injured most of last season.  But I guess that goes along with my statement ""hopefully the FO know something about one of our current players""."

SoundersFC,2sk5z6,bgatz,10,Thu Jan 15 21:46:53 2015 UTC,"Folks, this is the purpose of homegrown players. They are a resource. Just like we sold Yedlin overseas, we sold Okoli. Sure we hope for the one true star to come up through the system and become our anchor allstar, but we can't be sad everytime we send one out the door."
SoundersFC,2sk5z6,trickjarrett,6,Thu Jan 15 23:10:35 2015 UTC,"As much as I liked Okoli, the Sounders DO have Jones and Morris coming up through the pipelines in the next 2-3 years."
SoundersFC,2sk5z6,driverightpassleft,6,Fri Jan 16 00:08:28 2015 UTC,"And Mansaray. Plus our non-HGP veterans; Martins, Dempsey, Barrett, Cooper, Parsemain. It's a pretty steep hill to climb to get many minutes at striker for us, if the fifth striker on the depth chart is all-time leading scorer for a national team. This may end up being a good move for Okoli too (I hope so)."
SoundersFC,2sk5z6,stealth_sloth,3,Fri Jan 16 02:36:16 2015 UTC,"This is going to happen, unfortunately. The pipeline for talent at forward in the academy system is HUGE. Miller seems to be agreed upon as being the second-best GK in this draft class behind Bono, so while the troubling part is that he's off in Germany right now, getting a good third keeper is a bigger need than having Okoli in S2."
SoundersFC,2sk5z6,SonOfMechaMummy,3,Thu Jan 15 22:31:11 2015 UTC,We'll probably see more moves like these in the coming years. Our academy is producing a ton of attacking talent and there just aren't enough minutes to go around -- even with S2.

It's really been a buzz-kill for me at a time of year where I'm in full-on preseason-hype mode. There have been a few times that I've considered just skipping this season and focusing on NASL or USLPro for the year. I got some of my juice back when they announced the schedule, and again today with the draft. But yeah, I'm still pretty angry about the whole thing.   As for their fans - those are about the only blameless people in that whole stinking, fetid city (the whole RBNY situation hasn't exactly enhanced my opinion of the area). They're the biggest victims of us all in this mess."

And Man City has pushed his contract through the end of this season because he's playing well for them.  As a result, one of their two marquee signings is now not going to be there for the start of the season (as they trumpeted in advertising last summer); he'll be arriving in July.  This was coming on top of another minor flare-up when their home kit was revealed, and turned out to basically be a copy of Man City's home kit."

I don't care about the fact that they are pretty much a second squad for their franchise, that was obvious from day one.  So my current opinion of them is they don't have what it takes to put together a competitive MLS team.  I'm just waiting to see how they'll do first couple of games now, but I certainly won't be rooting for them in most games at first."

SoundersFC,2sf5c2,trickjarrett,6,Wed Jan 14 17:42:45 2015 UTC,"I want to like this but I just don't know if I can. I really like Sacha and I feel like he hasn't been given a fair shot at the USMNT with Klinsmann. A few years back I would be saying get him in here, but I don't know if it is worth it anymore. He is not a player for the long term as he is 29 and he isn't lighting the world on fire at Anderlecht. He seems like a more attack-minded Brad Evans to me, and that's not really what we need, especially if he is on a DP contract.   And if we have to give up any solid players then its a no-go.  Edit: Lol, wrote this before reading the article and it pretty much says the exact same thing. Move along."
SoundersFC,2sf5c2,MowwMoww,4,Wed Jan 14 18:13:38 2015 UTC,"DP contract, please no. Non-DP, absofuckinglutely. I don't think he's going to be the type of player to change the team or light the league up, but he's an upgrade on Pineda, Rose, Azira, or pretty much anyone we've paired with Ozzie ever besides maybe Tiffert. His style is pretty much the best case scenario for someone to pair with Ozzie. We're not going to get a pure 10 because Sigi doesn't play with one, but Sacha can offer some defensive stability, and will get forward and involved with Deuce and Oba more than someone like Azira will.   I agree with you that there's probably better players we can get for what we'd be paying him, but if we can dish Barrett or Cooper and keep him under the DP threshold, I think he'd be a welcome addition."

SoundersFC,2sf5c2,MowwMoww,1 point,Wed Jan 14 22:35:09 2015 UTC,"We're not going to get a pure 10 because Sigi doesn't play with one   That's not why we don't play with a 10. Sigi was fine with using a 10 at Columbus with GBS. The real reason we don't use a 10 is because the game has evolved away from them an Sigi has adapted with the changes.  Adding a ten would draw more defenders into the middle and close off more lanes into Oba/Clint than it would open. You also need to win the central midfield battle in order for a 10 to be effective, which would necessitate a formation change which would either break apart Clint/Oba, trade/bench both Neagle and Pappa, or play with a 3 man back line - I'd rather stick with what won us the shield, especially since continuity has been shown to be a better predictor of success in the league than splashy signings."
SoundersFC,2sf5c2,metameh,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:13:45 2015 UTC,"True, I phrased that incorrectly. Wasn't really intending it as a dig at Sigi, more just that with our personnel it's not going to happen, as it would mean a split of Clint and Oba, which is stupid and should never even be considered.  I mostly just meant it as I hear some people saying what Seattle lacks is a good playmaker to really link together everything. I don't those people are necessarily wrong, but picking up a pure playmaker isn't the solution either. Mauro Rosales is a legend, but we gave up a lot defensively on the right side for him to work, and even then he was still primarily a winger. Sacha would be a good pickup if we can get him for cheap IMO just because he'd perfectly slot into our system."

I don't those people are necessarily wrong, but picking up a pure playmaker isn't the solution either.   I'll agree with that for sure. I'm just tired of several refrains including ""Seattle needs a CAM"" and ""Sigi is tactically inflexible"" which simply aren't true. But a wide play maker or regista could fit. I particularly like the idea of a regista because that gives Ozzie license to act more like an 8 and create transition situations further up field and gives him a safety valve if he gets caught on an island."
SoundersFC,2sf5c2,metameh,1 point,Thu Jan 15 00:38:33 2015 UTC,"The game has not evolved away from using a 10 at all.  Guys like Eriksen at Spurs, Isco at Madrid, Gotze at Bayern, etc are all current 10s playing extremely well.  We don't use a 10 because we're not suited to it as a team.  And on that note, Dempsey plays very close to an old school 10 as is at times.  Free reign to drift around and basically be a second striker while linking up with Oba, who leads the line.  The 10 is not obsolete.  It's simply not a good fit for us."

You don't need a big target man striker, you don't need a dedicated anchor man midfielder, and you don't need an attacking wing back. They're all just roles that fit together in different ways.  The number 10 is just a really common one because you need a creator in some capacity, and the CAM type player can work in a variety of systems."

Home: A new kick ass green with some more blue in it, but overall very well executed these past 2 years. Excited to see the numbers with supporters faces on them.   Away: BLUE PLEASE. As a fan since '02, I've enjoyed all the kits, but the inaugural blue kit was one of the best, but if we could get a solid kit with blue, I'd buy it in a heart beat.   I always will enjoy throwbacks, white, and such, but the Shale these years was a good thought, but with the Black wasn't the best idea...."

I've got no problem with signing former Timbers players if they're the right fit though, especially guys like Perkins or Cooper who have played elsewhere inbetween."
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,joylongdivision,3,Tue Jan 13 23:56:56 2015 UTC,"Yep, I think part of the deal was that he was playing well for them and they traded him randomly it seemed. He was pretty much Mr. Timber at the time (as an outsider, of course) and they traded him and he was pretty upset. I'm not sure really what the reason for trading him was but it seemed to work out in the end for Portland as they got Ricketts."

SoundersFC,2sb8rh,juiceboxzero,3,Wed Jan 14 04:04:17 2015 UTC,"This looks like the first Lagerway signing - undervalued veteran talent that somehow fell through the cracks. I'm dubious that Perkins is as bad as his stats were last season given that Montreal's CB issues dwarfed ours in comparison and they have a tendency to play old holding midfielders. I'm also not convinced is as good as he played at the start of 2013, but would love it if he finds that form again - both Frei and Perkins have the potential to be top keepers in the league and I look forward to seeing how it plays out."

SoundersFC,2sb8rh,nikdahl,2,Tue Jan 13 19:33:56 2015 UTC,"So, is Frei still our go to guy?  Or is he taking Hanneman's spot as backup keep? If so, he has a long way to go to have facial hair that rivals that of Marcus."
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,BugSTi,10,Tue Jan 13 19:48:54 2015 UTC,"Here's hoping, Frei was spectacular by end of season last year."
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,CosmoThor,2,Tue Jan 13 20:12:54 2015 UTC,Guessing he'll be our backup and play in some Open Cup and CCL games.
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,ChvyVele,2,Tue Jan 13 22:46:40 2015 UTC,"Happy with him as a backup, always found the Perkins for Ricketts trade stupid even if Ricketts won GKOTY"
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,jlark21,1 point,Tue Jan 13 21:23:48 2015 UTC,feel like b/c of our firepower in front of the keeper they're going for proven vets that will get the job and be affordable. We don't need a crazy good keeper (yes the defense has been suspect but still).
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,thebubbazanetti,1 point,Tue Jan 13 20:43:02 2015 UTC,"Works for me. Veteran, proven, should be somewhat cheap, and feel totally comfortable with him deputizing for Frei if his form drops or he gets injured.   We needed a keeper or two also. Not sure who's in the S2 ranks, but we could do a lot worse than a top 2 of Frei/Perkins."
SoundersFC,2sb8rh,joylongdivision,0,Tue Jan 13 21:11:05 2015 UTC,"Dude looks smug as fuck.  Yep, former Timbers player... He checks out."
SoundersFC,2s7uax,Schwa142,9,Mon Jan 12 23:03:09 2015 UTC,I think his flying scissor kick goal will probably go down as one of the best Sounders FC goals ever scored for the club. He was plagued by injuries but I definitely had a love for Mr. Ianni.
SoundersFC,2s7uax,MowwMoww,3,Tue Jan 13 00:32:17 2015 UTC,Only 4 regular season goals in 133 games and one of them just HAD to be GotY...

SoundersFC,2s7uax,USA_A-OK,2,Tue Jan 13 03:25:45 2015 UTC,I was lucky to have him autograph my Sounders license plate while he was in town for the US Open Cup this year...
SoundersFC,2s818c,vershastri,2,Mon Jan 12 23:57:00 2015 UTC,He's a forward and we're stacked at the position. Our academy is churning out young forwards. IIRC he would require an international roster spot.
SoundersFC,2s818c,metameh,2,Thu Jan 15 01:11:25 2015 UTC,"Best guess, he wasn't considered good enough for a roster spot. With teams like S2, teams will be locking up these kind of players more often."

SoundersFC,2rqsfu,antifreze,3,Thu Jan 8 14:12:35 2015 UTC,"Personally, I think his only chances this season are as an impact sub at right midfield. I believe he'll get loaned out by the end of the January transfer window. The team is playing well right now and changing up a working formula is risky. If this was the Capitol One cup, he'd have a chance to play. But teams take the FA cup seriously, especially when they aren't in title contention."
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,IIMsmartII,4,Thu Jan 8 14:22:05 2015 UTC,"I don't know, I could see him coming on sooner than that; Tottenham are still in the Premier League, FA Cup, Capitol One Cup, and the Europa League. I still think it'll be as a sub as you say, but it could be sooner than we think with so many competitions and rotations needed."
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,PKMNTrainerFuckMe,2,Thu Jan 8 15:05:39 2015 UTC,"Probably garbage minutes in the next cup tie, whatever it happens to be. I agree, I think his first meaningful minutes as a player in Europe will come via loan, probably to the Championship. Wait and see..."
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,insultant_,2,Thu Jan 8 19:50:30 2015 UTC,"Naughton is out of favor at right back, and our other option is Vlad Chiriches. RB is a definite possibility. RW has Townsend, Lennon, and Lamela. Not as likely."
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,smokey815,2,Thu Jan 8 21:17:32 2015 UTC,"RB also has kyle Walker, who was England's #1 rb before he had surgery"
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,francostine,2,Fri Jan 9 04:04:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he's the clear starter. I was thinking mostly about depth. He's got a better chance to spell Walker in a cup than he does to play right wing. I didn't make that clear."
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,smokey815,1 point,Fri Jan 9 13:17:41 2015 UTC,Damn dude you're in coys and sounders too? Are you local?

SoundersFC,2rqsfu,smokey815,1 point,Fri Jan 9 20:19:56 2015 UTC,All the way from NY. Some night games must be tough to watch because of how late it is.

SoundersFC,2rqsfu,francostine,-1,Sat Jan 10 00:15:23 2015 UTC,"No way he sees time as a winger. Right mid maybe, but he's nowhere near technical enough to beat out those players, and I don't know whether he's even played there before."
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,P9J0S6,5,Thu Jan 8 21:57:48 2015 UTC,There's no difference between the two bar minimal role discrepancies. A right mid is a right winger as far as this conversation goes.
SoundersFC,2rqsfu,smokey815,2,Thu Jan 8 22:08:45 2015 UTC,"Sooner than later.  Youth development players you are trying to loan get number 34, not 12"

SoundersFC,2rn1dh,OG_Retro,2,Thu Jan 8 08:35:33 2015 UTC,Could also be because Kyle Walker is already wearing #2 which is Yedlin's preferred number.

SoundersFC,2ro940,overruns,6,Thu Jan 8 00:40:52 2015 UTC,He should at least be a starter for S2 and get Open Cup matches with them.
SoundersFC,2ro940,randymeeker,3,Thu Jan 8 00:55:50 2015 UTC,Lets hope so. We are already strong at forward and have some exciting young guys coming into the club now too
SoundersFC,2ro940,overruns,3,Thu Jan 8 02:07:06 2015 UTC,S2 games with him and Mansaray scoring goals for us are going to be a ton of fun to watch.

The Sun would be awful on the East Stand at twilight in June and September is a bit of a gamble. You can't really say whether it will be terribly hot in late September KC as our weather cycles are unpredictable at the end of seasons here in the Midwest. I wouldn't bank on it being too hot in late September, but sun late in the game could be fun. Granted Robb Heineman knows this and prices tickets as such."

I know you'll probably want to be somewhere near the Sounders away group. The away support is in the very southeast section of the stadium(113, I believe). You could go somewhere in the southern end, but you could choose anywhere you like with the 360° Seat Viewer on the Crew site."

SoundersFC,2rnmpq,Audicity,1 point,Wed Jan 7 19:50:55 2015 UTC,"Given Colorado's last season, the Red Bulls will likely be a more exciting game. Pretty hard to say right now before we know the full rosters and how well they're playing next season.  EDIT: Apparently the Red Bulls fired Petke... so who knows now. It looks like Colorado is on a wednesday though and Wednesdays aren't nearly as crazy as the weekends can get."
SoundersFC,2rnmpq,crowdsurfer,1 point,Wed Jan 7 20:41:46 2015 UTC,It's hard to say. Given the state of both teams (as far as we know right now ) they both might be non-competitive. At least with NYRB you'd get to see Cahill. Probably?

SoundersFC,2rglql,MowwMoww,6,Tue Jan 6 07:34:01 2015 UTC,"For those who don't know why the Lagerway news is exciting, here's what I posted when this was initially rumored: Original Reddit comment    Did some of my own reading after hearing this so let me drop some knowledge on you.  First off he's a retired keeper (he played with Rimando at Miami). He retired in 2000. After that he went to law school and got a degree. In 2007 he was hired by RSL as a Sr. VP and their GM.  Now let's talk about RSL some. They joined MLS in 2005. How did they do?   2005 - 5-22-5 2006 - 10-13-9 2007 - 6-15-9 [Hired Lagerway] 2008 - 10-10-10, lost the western conference finals 2009 - 11-12-7 - Won the MLS Cup 2010 - 15-4-11 - Lost conf. semifinals   Etc.  Now, I'm not exactly clear on it. But I am pretty sure Lagerway gets at least partial, if not full, credit for bringing Kreis on as coach midway through their 2007 season. Kreis is of course now the NYCFC head coach.  Hopefully that gives you some excitement."

SoundersFC,2r46cv,nikdahl,10,Fri Jan 2 17:23:23 2015 UTC,Uggh. How on earth does the MLS think it's going to get better if we can't pay young players what they're worth in other leagues? Why would they want to play in MLS if the money is worse than what they'll get in 2nd leagues in other countries?
SoundersFC,2r46cv,Stig707,2,Fri Jan 2 17:40:40 2015 UTC,If he was worth a ton in other leagues wouldn't he go?  He's on record as saying that a college degree is his primary goal at the moment.

SoundersFC,2r46cv,2thetop_1,8,Sat Jan 3 22:36:50 2015 UTC,"I don't think this article recognized the value of college scholarships in all this. MLS can't pay players comparable salaries to 2nd division Euro teams, but scholarship players are getting free rides to college, which is a good fall-back if this doesn't work out. Especially when your free ride is to a school like Stanford or Maryland."
SoundersFC,2r46cv,insultant_,6,Fri Jan 2 19:02:56 2015 UTC,Completely agree. With the average span of a pro athlete's career being so short it's a huge risk to not take the degree.

Not only are we not paying what they'd get in another country, we aren't even paying what they're getting in scholarship value! It's insane. The MLS is essentially assuming these players are idiots. It's damned insulting."

SoundersFC,2r46cv,randymeeker,1 point,Mon Jan 5 08:39:54 2015 UTC,"what would be great was if MLS could sort out a deal with the NCAA somehow to sign players and then loan them to the NCAA. Don't know how it would work, but it would be a great way to keep promising players with their hometown clubs. But overall I don't get playing in college. If you are serious about a career in football you play professionally first and if that doesn't work, then you can return to college."

SoundersFC,2r2fqi,moronbeef,8,Fri Jan 2 17:43:06 2015 UTC,"Works for me. I don't like Gerrard, and I don't like LA.   They also tend to sign older DPs, so this could have some truth to it."

SoundersFC,2r2fqi,MowwMoww,6,Fri Jan 2 07:24:32 2015 UTC,"Anyone who has watched Liverpool in the last year shouldn't be downvoting you. He has been reduced to a role as designated  penalty taker and QB, lobbing in linking passes from the midfield. Sometimes the passes work, but often they do not (yesterday vs Leicester he overshot repeatedly,  meaning that even a player with the engine of Jordan Henderson couldn't  manage to run forward in time to keep them in. How exactly are the 30-somethings Keane, Gordon, and Sarvas going to do better?) Again, this is to say nothing to his quality over his entire career, but he brings nothing defensively and has been a liability for LFC this year. That isn't to say that he wouldn't be a good or even great player for LA, but they need to be aware from day one of how to deploy him and maximize his usefulness."
SoundersFC,2r2fqi,fnmonk,2,Fri Jan 2 14:19:49 2015 UTC,"Well, they do need a replacement for Donovan, so this would hardly be outrageous. He's old, but not outrageously why-are-you-still-playing old, so hopefully we won't see too much of the usual ""hurr hurr MLS is a retirement league"" business if he does sign for them."

SoundersFC,2qxbjt,RutzPacific,3,Wed Dec 31 19:18:43 2014 UTC,"Random facts continue!  Delta is our #2 airline at SEA.  They are pushing hard and stepping on Alaska Air's toes for ground in Seattle, some speculate this is to put them in a tough situation and make buying them easier.  Alaska has most of the NW locked down as #1 airline in regional or international airports, no matter who the sponsor of our teams are.  I'm seriously considering doing a mileage plan status challenge and switching over to Delta for 2015.  Alaska is consistently bland and almost never a pain in the ass.  But they are also never more than just OK.    Delta business class was fucking awesome.  And I do a lot of personal stops after business trips to see friends and finding a flight from a podunk town to even a major hub on Alaska (outside the PNW) is impossible now that they are warring with Delta and limiting codeshares.  If I'm not flying to/from SEA Alaska sucks."

SoundersFC,2qxbjt,metrop021,1 point,Wed Dec 31 15:40:03 2014 UTC,I second that. The pro shop in Downtown Seattle gives you a discount if you're a season ticket holder and it keeps the prices in the 'high' range rather than the 'outrageous' range (imo). But the quality of the goods is unparalleled

SoundersFC,2qxbjt,JustinCasy,3,Wed Dec 31 20:24:21 2014 UTC,"I would advise waiting until what MLS calls ""Jersey Week"" when they release all the new kits for the coming year. You'll probably be able to find something on sale, or at least have a better selections."
SoundersFC,2qxbjt,Flying_mike_d,2,Wed Dec 31 17:03:56 2014 UTC,"""Jersey week"" is February I believe. I'd wait till then. You won't find much right now in the way of sizes except for the third kit as we're expecting new home and away jerseys. There's the pro shop or the shops just outside century link also that will put names and numbers on the back on the spot. If your in town the day before I'd go down and buy then as the pro shop can be pretty hectic before a game."
SoundersFC,2qxbjt,Schwa142,1 point,Wed Dec 31 16:43:27 2014 UTC,"Good call. I'll be there a day or two beforehand, so if I'm still in the market by then, I'll try to go early. Thanks!"
SoundersFC,2qxbjt,joylongdivision,2,Wed Dec 31 20:25:31 2014 UTC,"Fargo native myself here. Currently residing in Boise. Wait until you get to Seattle for the game so you can try on a jersey to make sure you get the right fit. There is a pro shop right at the stadium. If you want to save a few dollars or have a custom jersey made, you can visit www.onthefield.com or go to their shop, it's right across the street from the stadium if you walk out of the pro shop and take a slight left across the street. This season your options were a blank jersey or a Dempsey jersey. There were some Oba jerseys I saw, but those may have been custom made.   Make sure you arrive early to grab your Sounders gear (jersey/scarf/etc) and then head north of the stadium and grab a beer at Fuel. Join the ECS march to the stadium, you can find the songs online so you can sing along as you march. Beers in the stadium are cheaper before the match starts, but it's only at certain vendors, I think...  If you are traveling that far for the game, make sure you get as much bang for your buck as you can. Stick around after the match and you may have an opportunity to meet a few players, get a picture, catch an autograph."

SoundersFC,2qwgxa,MajorDefault,3,Wed Dec 31 07:34:20 2014 UTC,"I would say it's a long shot for a couple of reasons. The first is that we found his production elsewhere (Pappa + Pineda). He also mostly likely costs too much at this point between his potential transfer fee and wages, making it economically unwise to try to sign him."

SoundersFC,2qubnq,littlenicky174,5,Tue Dec 30 19:31:10 2014 UTC,"Not the most shocking signing - we sold one attacking right back, now we're getting another - but it's nice to see that we're able to attract players with top-flight European experience who aren't like 38 years old."
SoundersFC,2qubnq,HMARS,3,Wed Dec 31 02:49:32 2014 UTC,"Although this particular one has played a grand total of 300 competitive minutes since February 2013, and none since August 2013. I hope he is fully healthy and looks sharp for us, but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a bit nervous."
SoundersFC,2qubnq,stealth_sloth,2,Wed Dec 31 04:59:07 2014 UTC,"Hmm, you're right. It seems like the club has put some focus on picking up players who have slipped through the cracks in Europe, probably because they'd be a free transfer and might have lower wage expectations. Mind you, the last time we signed an out-of-contract defender it didn't end up panning out, but if we're not paying a transfer fee it's hardly a big gamble to take."

SoundersFC,2qr5ao,canucknuckles,10,Tue Dec 30 00:59:48 2014 UTC,"I was initially pretty excited. Experienced EPL/Championship quality RB/CB? Please and thank you!   Digging a bit....well...now I'm not quite so optimistic.   First: Age. He's currently 31 years old. Not dead, but neither is he a capable of bringing that youthful energy that Yedlin brought to the RB role.   Second: Injuries. Worse, he picked up a fractured leg back around Aug 2011 and that appears to have seriously derailed his career with Bolton. It appears that the initial injury took him out for the rest of the season. When he game back in the middle of the next season, he got one good game in, but complained about leg pains and was out the rest of the season. If I'm reading his Transfermarkt profile correctly, he hasn't seen the field since August of 2013.   He's got a lot of experience and skill, but also seems to have serious health concerns. I find myself thinking about Zakuani - a great player that never really recovered from his injury.   I understand that, unlike Apam, he's actually been pretty thoroughly evaluated by the coaching staff. He apparently spent some time training with the Sounders last summer. So I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt - they pretty smart and know their job. :)    sources: Transfermarkt Wikipedia Sounder @ Heart"
SoundersFC,2qr5ao,jaschac,8,Mon Dec 29 23:24:49 2014 UTC,"I'm willing to trust a) the coaches' assessment and b) the fact that ""nagging injury issues that caused him to lose traction with his club"" is pretty much also The Mauro Rosales/Gonzalo Pineda Story. He's going to be a downgrade from Yedlin but in a way I'm reminded of the Traore signing, which isn't the worst thing."
SoundersFC,2qr5ao,SonOfMechaMummy,1 point,Tue Dec 30 00:30:37 2014 UTC,"I tend to agree with you on A, though not so much on B.   A. We have one helluva of staff, and the fact that he's been able to actually train with them means they should have been able to get a solid read on him. If they say he's good enough, that's really all I need to hear.   B. Guys like Rosales had a history of minor injuries that plagued them. They were fragile(ish), and took a lot of fouls in-game. So about the time they were healing up from the last injury, they were picking up something new. This struck me more like a Zakuani situation. Not a history of injuries, but one massive career-altering injury. (but again, see point A - if our boys say he's good-to-go, I'm far more inclined to accept their assessment than my brief bit of googling and lack of a sports-medicine background. :) )"

SoundersFC,2qr5ao,joylongdivision,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:20:07 2014 UTC,"I am glad Anibaba went though, he was barely serviceable as a defender. He really had trouble being in position at CB, and wasn't fast enough to keep up on the left or right. We most likely have kids in Sounders II or the academy that could do better this year. And Zavaletta is back from loan so that helps a little."
SoundersFC,2qr5ao,dsn0wman,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:35:13 2014 UTC,"I thought Jalil was only a dumpster fire at centerback. He wasn't really great at outside back either, but he had his moments (the early game against Portland was good).   No problem with getting rid of his contract though, but I personally would've been okay with him coming back on less than 100K."
SoundersFC,2qr5ao,joylongdivision,1 point,Tue Dec 30 22:43:38 2014 UTC,"To me it's just better to train a youngster, and I don't think he was coming back at any discount. Teams look at his size (like we did) and think they can turn him around. Problem is his size is only good for CB, and hasn't been able to learn the position. On top of that he is just too slow at RB or LB if he is playing in Seattle's style of offense."

SoundersFC,2qqwp4,HMARS,2,Wed Dec 31 07:14:44 2014 UTC,"The prices 'should' not change ever. The ECS has an unspoken rule that we always sell our tickets for face value, never gouging for a special game - although in practice that doesn't always happen.      Tickets for this section are 100% sold as season tickets. So anything you get will be second hand.       Prices for season ticket holders in this section were something like $21 for first-season people. It's gone up to closer to $28 now I think. You 'should' get tickets for any game in that range. If not - report the people selling them.       If you are an ECS official member - you can look for tickets through the forum. Always face value there.  If you are buying through another method - it's a crap shoot."
SoundersFC,2qqwp4,cwcoleman,2,Wed Dec 31 17:24:57 2014 UTC,$30-50 for basic $75-$100 for club.

SoundersFC,2qqwp4,ViewASCII,1 point,Tue Dec 30 01:51:44 2014 UTC,"Most of the people here seem to be giving you season ticket prices per game. Is that what you're looking for?  I don't have season tickets but I go to a lot of games. Ticket prices vary a lot depending on the game and where you want to sit. I've sat in the 300 level for around $40-45, but I've enjoyed sitting around midfield in the 200 club level more (best view for my preference) so I've sat there a lot this year and it usually runs about $70-90. Overall I'd say tickets usually range from $30-100. I always buy tickets through the Sounders website for re-sale tickets as in my experience it has had the best prices.  Also worth mentioning that if you're willing to wait until a couple of days before the game or even the day before, you can find some good deals as people are worried about not being able to sell their tickets."
SoundersFC,2qqwp4,ChvyVele,1 point,Mon Dec 29 22:44:28 2014 UTC,"I've been able to snag tickets right aroun $20-$30, but I also like being in the ECS, and stuff. I've also been super lucky when I've gone to buy single match tickets. Even $40/ seat is a decent price point and there aren't bad seats in the house. Every place has advantages and disadvantages. For seeing the match the 300's are great. I'd just be careful in the lower 300's like 303-304 with matches against Portland, since they tend to put away supporters in 301-302 for full stadium matches."

SoundersFC,2qrakj,sp_the_ghost,10,Mon Dec 29 23:13:26 2014 UTC,"This is possibly the dumbest thing I have ever read on S@H. It is simply not going to happen. The proposals for sites in Bellevue and Tukwilla are especially stupid. I'm surprised a suggestion wasn't to just destroy Starfire as it currently exists and build a giant stadium exactly like CLink in its place only with grass.   Every year, when people mention the Sounders and our attendance and how other markets want to do what we do here and when they talk about what the Sounders are doing right the first thing mentioned is the prime downtown location with lots of access to the freeways and public transportation. You give up SoDo or the CLink, and you lose that. If the Sounders went to the burbs, attendance would suffer. Every year at the business meeting Joe Roth says how he wants to get tot he point where we are doing 50-60k/game vs 35-40k with an eye towards filling 70,000 seats the way we used to look at doing 55k. We aren't going to do that in a smaller SSS, let alone one built in fucking Renton or some shit.    It's just not a serious proposal. I don't even see it serious enough for us to speculate about. Is it something the Sounders are looking into? It would be bad business if they didn't at least explore options there and do an analysis to see just how realistic it might be. But we have what, 20, 30,000 STH now? It will have to accommodate the STH base plus the growing number of casual fans who want to check out a game or two a season.  Honestly this whole thing seems like Taylor Twellman trolling because its the offseason, he is bored, Lalas is leaving for Fox, and he hates artificial turf, and the incredibly vocal Sounders Twitterverse (who seem to be heavily based in places like Renton, Issaquah, Tacoma, etc) trying to have their wish fulfillment of a stadium closer to home."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,moronbeef,1 point,Tue Dec 30 07:22:06 2014 UTC,"Actually, I take back my comment about this being the dumbest thing I have seen on S@H, in fact, it may be the smartest article I have ever read. It is the offseason, and this article not only has tons of comments, but it has me commenting on it on here. Tons of page views on this at a time when there is barely any Sounders news at all (our new defender aside).  Nicely don, S@H editors for realizing that this would get more page views than the alternative post, which I can only hope was Dave Clark speculative fiction involving Sounders players on a moon base trying to defend the Earth from a horrible power, one that probably looks a lot like Bruce Arena.   Very clever. I see what you did there, and I tip my hat to you."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,moronbeef,1 point,Tue Dec 30 08:02:31 2014 UTC,"First of all, I appreciate you reading it.  Now - I'm curious as to why you think sites in Bellevue and Tukwila are stupid, especially given that you haven't considered what my reasoning was for selecting them (as it hasn't been published yet.) I think they're actually viable sites in an ideal world, especially with some investment in the surrounding areas. Obviously this is projecting but I think it's a safe bet this would happen.  Prime downtown location with freeway access is great. Bellevue Site 1 is directly adjacent to 405 with easy access on major arterials from both 520 and I90, and is going to be walking distance from a future East Link stop in what is one of the largest and fastest growing cities in the State. I think it fits your criteria.  Regarding attendance, Roth can say he wants 70,000 but it's not happening in his life time and anybody with eyes can see that. Not consistently anyway. 45,000 is a safe number, it would allow for a packed house every week, and would make sure demand stays high. If you build 45,000 it isn't a great leap to design a building that could be expanded to fit an extra 5,000 (or more.)  The Sounders are looking into it. Twellman didn't mention it flippantly and Oshan said here that the story has merit. I don't know what more it will take to convince you, but those are two of the best sources you can get for MLS/Sounders related info.  Again, I really appreciate you reading the piece and hope you'll stick with it for the next few installments."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,moronbeef,4,Tue Dec 30 15:45:37 2014 UTC,"The reason I immediately poo poo any suggestion of the Sounders moving to the suburbs is simply because look at what has helped to make them so successful in such a short time of existing in MLS - the location of Century Link Field. It is downtown in a major metropolitan area with great public transportation links (basically the hub for all public transport in the metro area) and lots of options for parking as well. The March to the Match through downtown is a hugely popular spectacle that has done wonders to increase awareness of the Sounders. What the Sounders have achieved here has changed what the expectations are for franchises in MLS. It is no longer acceptable to have a stadium out in a remote part of their home city's metro area - new clubs and teams that want new stadiums want their stadiums downtown so they can have better visibility and a chance to try to replicate what has been done so successfully here in Seattle and Portland.   Bellevue, despite being a fast growing city and having a site situated near the major arterials and a future light rail stop, is still not Seattle. It is still a suburb, and is not going to have anywhere close to the marketability that currently exists in Seattle, even with the negatives of having to share a stadium with the Seahawks.   The downtown Seattle business owners are also not going to want to lose the massive revenues they get from the crowds, and the fans are not going to want to lose the many options for pre and post funks they currently have in the downtown Seattle location. There is something for everyone in the Pioneer Square/SoDo area, from dive bars to more upscale places. Bellevue, not so much. Plus, the traffic in Bellevue is horrible, and even with the East Link stop, it still isn't going to be as ready to accommodate a massive influx of people as the King St. Station is.   Tukwila is out too for basically the same reasons. For that though, I will point to the Seattle Reign. Their attendance saw a big jump just by moving from Starfire to Seattle Center, and Memorial Stadium in my opinion is a complete shit show compared to Starfire. The view is nice, but other than that ugh. But in this discussion Tukwila is even worse than Bellevue as far as things to do around the stadium.   In that respect I also write off Seattle Site #4 and probably #3 as well. Plublic transportation links in that part of SoDo are not all that great, and still a ways away from King St. Station.   I also question if a 45,000 seater would be big enough. But I don't know what the math is when it comes to determining appropriate size of the stadium, especially when it comes to expanding season ticket sales but still wanting to have individual match tickets available. Look at how Portland's growth has been stunted by the size of their stadium. They could easily come close to matching us in attendance if they had a stadium the size of ours. Is risking plateauing and being stuck in a place where we end up basically capping how much money can be made with a smaller stadium worth it compared to what we have now?   I know Oshan said the story has merit, I don't doubt that it does. Like I said in my original comment, it would be bad business for the Sounders to NOT be exploring these options. But exploring options, keeping an eye out and looking forward is a different beast entirely than ""Sounders pushing for new SSS."" Especially when you take into consideration the investment the Sounders have made into Pioneer Square with moving their offices there and working on basically creating a Game Day center for pre-match stuff, as a gathering place and people to come in. That doesn't seem like the action of a team that is actively looking to move ASAP.   If a Sounders SSS were to happen, we are looking at serious discussions taking place maybe in 10 years at best. And another 3-5 from there to make it a reality. I just don't see it even being worth speculating about where it could possibly be at this point aside from the excuse to talk about until the schedule is released and we can all start planning our away trips.   Unless the ownership is going to privately fund a stadium, they are going to have to wait for the political climate here to change a great deal. First we had the Key Arena fuck up, which was a big reason we no longer have the Sonics. Seattle isn't going to pony up any public funds to get the Sonics back without the deal of a team coming here being done, even though that is also holding up a potential NHL team. Because there is still skepticism of the cost vs benefit of yet another stadium. There's a lot of public pushback against using public funds to build a stadium, even if it brings the Sonics back and gets Seattle an NHL team. Combine that with every other public spending fuckup this city has done in the last 10-20 years, such as the whole Monorail thing, Seattle's own Sarlaac Pit that is the stupid tunnel project that is going to swallow taxpayer money and digest it for a thousand years, a growing housing and transportation crisis, and a new stadium for a team using any public funding becomes a hard sell, especially when that team is packing 40,000 people into their existing stadium every week and gets that number up to 60-65 on a fairly regular basis a few times a year. That's why I don't think the timing is right for us to even begin to speculate about it for any other reason than we have nothing else to do in the offseason right now."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,IInviteYouToTheParty,0,Tue Dec 30 17:51:59 2014 UTC,"Okay, a lot to unpack here. Thanks for the coherent, thoughtful reply. It's clear you've thought a lot about this.  I agree that CLink is a huge reason, probably THE reason for the initial success of the team. Everything that you've said in this regard is valid, and I don't disagree with any of it. Where I disagree when you start to call Bellevue a ""remote part"" of the Metro area - it's the closest thing to a real City not named Seattle between Everett and Tacoma, and it isn't close. Bellevue has exploded and is going to continue to do so especially as Link expands there. It is a City in its own right, merely 5.5 miles as the crow flies and not much more by car or rail.  Regarding marketability, as it stands this is correct in relation to what we have now, but again, you fail to acknowledge that a Bellevue site could easily provide similar amenities and atmosphere to the current location, though I grant you it would feel different as it's not Pioneer Square, for better or for worse. There are tons of options for how they could do this, and any stadium near the downtown core of Bellevue would likely attract significant investment in the immediate vicinity to take advantage of the increased visibility of the site.  Regarding traffic, sure, it sucks getting in and out of Bellevue during rush hour. It's just as bad getting into downtown from South of the City, and god help you if you're coming from Everett. I don't buy this as a reason and I never will.   You're missing a large point of the analysis, probably because it isn't published yet, and that is that Link connectivity is going to play a huge role in how people get to and from any potential new building. With U Link, North Link, Lynnwood Link and East Link all open by the time any prospective stadium would be completed, it totally shifts the paradigm. People don't have to prefunk around the stadium when you can drink as much as you like, walk into Pioneer Square Station or Roosevelt Station or Broadway Station and get to the ground in 30 minutes. As someone who has spent multiple vacations visiting grounds across Europe I can tell you that this is not uncommon.   Your assertion that a Bellevue East Link station couldn't handle the volumes is based on what, exactly? Do you have figures to prove this? Sound Transit can and would easily add more trains to deal with the increased demand. They already do this.  Both Tukwila sites are a long shot, but with foresight and proper investment could work under the right circumstances. Obviously they're the least ideal.  If they want to have a stadium finished by the end of the next decade, they had better get on it immediately. These are long, arduous processes and I wouldn't be surprised if they've already done some of their own research. That research would likely tell them that they'd have to put together a private funding package to equal or better Hansen's for the Sonics Arena, and I have every confidence Roth and Hanauer could get that money together without a great amount of trouble. They will likely have to wait for the winds to change, and in that case it makes even more sense to do your due dilligence up front so that you're ready when they do.  In a broad sense, I think you forget or ignore that when I discuss what these sites could be, we're talking 10 years in the future, likely more, and things will drastically change between now and then. It's important to consider that because it informs basically every assumption that this series of articles was based on."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,thegodsarepleased,0,Tue Dec 30 18:50:35 2014 UTC,"I would also like to point out for the record that I believe the best, most likely scenario is staying in CenturyLink in the medium term, assuming differences between the interested parties can be resolved, which I think they can.

Without public financing the chances that this  happens is very slim since few stadiums are built 100% with private money anymore."

Control of schedule, surface, allowed uses therein, everything. They would be the primary tenants and would set the schedule, instead of having to schedule around the Seahawks, concerts, monster truck rallies, and Amazon."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,nikdahl,2,Tue Dec 30 15:33:44 2014 UTC,"I'm sure the club would love their own stadium but the fact of the matter is that there is a very low chance taxpayers would be okay with building a new stadium when the Clink is available to use.  Even if the Sounders waited 10 years, their chances are low since most people would probably prefer to renovate the Clink than build a new stadium.  If the FO is willing to spend their own money on the stadium (financing all of it) then the chances of this happening in the next 10 years raises, but it is still very unlikely."
SoundersFC,2qrakj,my_lucid_nightmare,0,Tue Dec 30 21:01:45 2014 UTC,"I've said this elsewhere, but I would be a lot of money that Roth and Hanauer could come up with a finance package as good or better than what Hansen did for the Sonics Arena.

SoundersFC,2qdrb6,RubiksSugarCube,8,Thu Dec 25 19:00:25 2014 UTC,"Tucson-based Sounders supporter here. If you're on Facebook, the Cactus Pricks public group may be a good place to ask questions like this.  I believe the team stayed at the Westin La Paloma last year. FC Tucson reserves rooms at hotels of varying price points so teams can choose from a range of options and I think the options will be the same this year. I'm pretty sure the only team that didn't stay at the Westin last year was New England. They stayed at the DoubleTree at Reid Park, so that could be an option as well. Regardless, unless you're really into gambling, I definitely wouldn't stay at Desert Diamond Casino even though that's what a lot of the travel packages offer.  Entertainment and dining-wise, the Westin offers limited options, as do most hotels in the Foothills. Each resort will have one or two good restaurants and golf options will be readily available, but that's about it for entertainment other than shopping/eating at La Encantada, a mall a couple of miles from La Paloma that's kind of like a small U-Village.  If nightlife and dining will be more significant to you than the quality of nearby golf courses, I'd recommend staying closer to downtown or UA. As an aside, a lot of players make their way downtown and to University Boulevard in their free time, so there's that, too. Anyway, there aren't a ton of hotel options, but I'd check out the aLoft, the Marriott at Main Gate Square, or the Arizona Inn. All of these will provide much easier access to the Kino Sports Complex as well.  If you settle on a hotel, feel free to let me know and I can provide more specific advice on things to do/places to eat nearby."

That's total bullshit. I know the spirit of the holiday is all about giving, not getting, but it's still a little disheartening to get shorted on an honor system gift exchange.   Unfortunately, there are a few people out there that would even consider doing that, but if you report it, you might get re-matched and still get a gift.  Edit: Just sent you some gold.

SoundersFC,2ptqya,2thetop_1,6,Fri Dec 19 21:34:34 2014 UTC,I have my fingers crossed for sure. I would love to see Alonso in a U.S.A. jersey!
SoundersFC,2psyaq,ssfc5,8,Fri Dec 19 17:27:42 2014 UTC,No. Dom Dwyer and B-Rad and Kaka and an FC Dallas player are all having a photoshoot. He must have just taking a piece of each kit. Dom has been posting on Twitter about it this morning.
SoundersFC,2psyaq,TheBarberOfFleetSt,12,Fri Dec 19 18:43:06 2014 UTC,"He has a KC top, WHITE Sounders shorts, and FC Dallas socks. If my memory serves me right, we've never had white shorts as part of any of our kits. Could this perhaps mean a white away jersey for next season? What do you all think?"
SoundersFC,2psyaq,_Bt,13,Fri Dec 19 17:30:46 2014 UTC,Are you sure those aren't the Neon green shorts that go with the pitch black kit? The pic is pretty filtered/ with weird lighting.   That being said- I think a white kit would be awesome.
SoundersFC,2psyaq,_Bt,3,Fri Dec 19 17:40:48 2014 UTC,Damnit. I think you might be right. We can only hope. I'm thinking it's more likely that we'll have a blue away jersey considering we already have a dark 3rd kit. It would be silly to have a black 3rd and another Shale/dark gray/ black away jersey like we've had for the past two.
SoundersFC,2psyaq,Newmanator29,4,Fri Dec 19 17:45:26 2014 UTC,I think Blue or White are really the only logical options for a 2nd kit. I'd be fine with either. Let's not forget the Rave Green shirt will be updated/tweaked this year too.
SoundersFC,2psyaq,gtg10,1 point,Fri Dec 19 17:51:12 2014 UTC,I'm not sure about this. The pitch black shorts have black stripes down the side and as far as I can tell I don't see any on these shorts

SoundersFC,2ppb21,iamnotbadger,2,Thu Dec 18 21:53:26 2014 UTC,"This article from last year seems to point to it being a simple administrative move. Its kind of unprecedented in a way because having dual US/Cuban citizenship hasn't been an issue. Either way, he is essentially being held hostage unable to play for either national team until Cuba gives the ok for him to play for the US.   Klinsmann's comments are kind of expanded in this article from Sounder at Heart and there is more thoughtful discussion in the comments."

SoundersFC,2ppb21,violentsnail,2,Fri Dec 19 07:53:44 2014 UTC,"Beckerman is a lot less willing to go in hard for a tackle, or risk a hard tackle from an opponent when he is on the ball.  You'll never see a sequence like this from Beckerman.  Alonso gets in about twice as many tackles a game, puts more miles on his legs each game, commits slightly more fouls and suffers far more fouls... he's playing a more physical, bruising game than Beckerman now or even than Beckerman of four years ago.  Same role on a team, different ways of filling it. Both outstanding at their jobs, but... Alonso will likely need to change his playing style if he wants to keep going strong as he ages. Beckerman could pretty much just continue playing the same way he always did."
SoundersFC,2ppb21,knightlock15,2,Fri Dec 19 14:05:57 2014 UTC,"True, and I agree with your original point about Ozzie and age. I take a look at running backs in the NFL, and many of them have clearly lost a step or two around their 30's. Ozzie could have a chance if he stays healthy, but I'd be willing to bet that he starts having bigger injury problems in the next couple years, especially if the Sounders continue to play on turf. Regardless its still pretty exceptional to be playing at a world class level in your mid 30's...For the record, I thought Beckerman wouldn't have a snowballs chance in hell of being a starter in the WC either and was only an option for emergency depth to defend a lead, so what do I know."

SoundersFC,2pl8do,sp_the_ghost,3,Thu Dec 18 00:29:18 2014 UTC,"Looks like someone thought about it:  ""  Dimensions of about 650’ long by 550’ wide are needed. With the school parking lot on 5th Ave the long dimension is not a problem. Tight width between McCaw Hall and EMP/Center House to fit width wise. But with design modification it could work.  Parking and Access are a challenge that could be met longer term. If the SR99 tunnel is ever completed the north portal exit would be right there.  Future Transit enhancement would be needed. One study corridor in the Sound Transit 3 light rail expansion would put a station on a Ballard-Downtown line at Seattle Center. But this couldn’t be online before about 2028. On slightly nearer term there is a possible Streetcar extension to Seattle Center through Belltown.  Seattle Center / Memorial is the only place that could match the Clink gameday experience. (Debatable)  Politically, local government (Seattle) would likely support the location to re energize the City owned Seattle Center. But would not likely support much if any public funding."""

I also speculate unfounded that we are probably only 5-8 years away from the next style of turf, we've been using field turf for almost 15 yrs now across the country and its now being possibly connected to high rates of adolescent cancer, especially in young women soccer goalies.

SoundersFC,2pl8do,philwelch,1 point,Thu Dec 18 01:17:56 2014 UTC,The last time they improved the turf I read that Century Link was specifically built for turf so it's missing the proper drainage and sunlight required to grow grass.  Sadly it'll never be the soccer stadium we want.
SoundersFC,2pl8do,newbachu,3,Thu Dec 18 07:08:25 2014 UTC,"That's not true. It was built for grass, and the Seahawks switched to FieldTurf after growing to like it at Husky Stadium. That's why it was part of the World Cup bid--they planned to install a grass pitch in time for 2022."
SoundersFC,2pl8do,philwelch,1 point,Thu Dec 18 09:12:55 2014 UTC,I did a quick search just so I didn't feel crazy and I came across this article at sounderatheart in it Gary Wright specifically mentions that grass won't grow properly at Century Link.  I know the stadium was first proposed as a grass stadium but I believe when they actually started construction they built it for turf.
SoundersFC,2pl8do,newbachu,1 point,Thu Dec 18 15:50:34 2014 UTC,"So it's a little more complicated than I thought. The stadium is actually built with the correct drainage and so forth to support grass, and for a World Cup bid they could install grass during the summer and it would survive. But the field is oriented north-south instead of east-west, which limits the sunlight the field could receive. Some stadiums solve this problem with grow lights, however. It's not like they flipped around the orientation of the stadium after they decided to switch to FieldTurf; clearly they either anticipated that the orientation of the stadium wouldn't be a problem or expected to make a workaround.   The biggest problem is that grass probably isn't durable enough to survive the NFL season. So, while it's possible for the Clink to have grass, it's not feasible as a dual-use stadium."
SoundersFC,2pl8do,warox13,1 point,Thu Dec 18 17:22:37 2014 UTC,I think painting lines on grass is a bit more complicated than the turf too.  As I recall the paint they use now that they can actually wash off relatively quickly doesn't work on grass.

SoundersFC,2pl8do,savagewinds,10,Wed Dec 17 16:50:07 2014 UTC,"We know exactly how the funding is going to go if they try to get their own stadium.  100% private or it isn't happening.  It's beyond a snowball's chance in hell if they try to get tax money to build a slightly smaller version of Clink just so they can get a grass field.  That won't fly with anybody,  including a ton of Sounders fans."

SoundersFC,2pl8do,savagewinds,1 point,Wed Dec 17 19:07:35 2014 UTC,Not a whole lot of available sites in that part of the world (off the top of my head). Keep and eye out for a piece on potential sites on SAH soon.

SoundersFC,2pl8do,nikdahl,2,Wed Dec 17 17:26:14 2014 UTC,Do you know how un-godly expensive that would be? It's cutting a field-width hole into the side of a solid stadium.

It's not like you can just dig under the stadium, it's not built to have its feet cut out from under it. You'd have to demolish one whole side of the stadium.

SoundersFC,2pfz01,trickjarrett,2,Tue Dec 16 15:25:54 2014 UTC,"Did some of my own reading after hearing this so let me drop some knowledge on you.  First off he's a retired keeper (he played with Rimando at Miami). He retired in 2000. After that he went to law school and got a degree. In 2007 he was hired by RSL as a Sr. VP and their GM.  Now let's talk about RSL some. They joined MLS in 2005. How did they do?   2005 - 5-22-5 2006 - 10-13-9 2007 - 6-15-9 [Hired Lagerway] 2008 - 10-10-10 in the west, lost the western conference finals 2009 - 11-12-7 - Won the MLS Cup 2010 - 15-4-11 - Lost conf. semifinals   Etc.  Now, I'm not exactly clear on it. But I am pretty sure Lagerway gets at least partial, if not full, credit for bringing Kreis on as coach midway through their 2007 season. Kreis is of course now the NYCFC head coach.  Hopefully that gives you some excitement."

My guess is that Lagerway will take the President position while Hanauer resumes the GM role, or vice versa. I would have imagined that Hanauer would have hinted at something at the alliance business meeting, but you never know.   It's just one more person at the top in the front office that knows how to make a winning team. Win win."
SoundersFC,2pfbda,SteveSam12,10,Tue Dec 16 02:16:22 2014 UTC,"The Pitch Black third kit was just introduced this year, so it shouldn't be phased out for at least another year. That's your good news.  The bad news is that even though you can still find them in local Seattle stores right now (I saw quite a few this weekend), it looks like they're completely sold out online. Unfortunately this isn't very unusual, they've been getting sold out frequently all season long in online stores.  Hopefully that answers a few of your questions, I wish I could have found something for you."
SoundersFC,2pfbda,Aurick,2,Tue Dec 16 02:31:56 2014 UTC,That's good the black one will be around for a while.  About how long do they stick with a style?  I guess its not like the EPL who seemingly change their designs every six months.
SoundersFC,2pfbda,ChvyVele,5,Tue Dec 16 02:47:58 2014 UTC,"I think each design usually sticks around for two years. Keep in mind though, even though the pitch black kit should be around next year it will change to have the new MLS patches on the sleeves (if you want to have the most current jersey)."
SoundersFC,2pfbda,benhelioz,5,Tue Dec 16 02:57:39 2014 UTC,I'm looking forward to the new first kits!

SoundersFC,2pfbda,Aurick,2,Sun Dec 21 04:45:27 2014 UTC,"No worries! I saw them last week in the Alderwood Mall Seattle Team Store (by Nordstrom). No clue if they still have them in stock though. In general, Alderwood isn't a bad place to check if you're in the area and looking. They have a new Pro Shop, Seattle Team Store, and Just Sports. If none of those have it in stock, theres also a Soccer store across the street in the strip mall by the Regal (read: not the AMC Loews) cinema. Good luck!"
SoundersFC,2pfbda,randykaisersd,1 point,Sun Dec 21 04:52:28 2014 UTC,Awesome! Thank you very much. I'm visiting my family here and I'm trying to do some last minute Christmas shopping. I appreciate the help
SoundersFC,2pfbda,trickjarrett,5,Sun Dec 21 05:29:57 2014 UTC,"Given the fact that this is the first time ever that the team's most selling product wasn't a scarf, it was the pitch black jersey, I don't think this design will go anywhere for a while."
SoundersFC,2pfbda,sherlocknessmonster,5,Tue Dec 16 05:00:44 2014 UTC,"I actually have Large one with tags sitting in my closet; it fit too tight...I was going to take it back to the pro shop, but lost my receipt. I won't be home until tomorrow...I'll see if I can dig it out."
SoundersFC,2pb5q9,Happlestance,13,Mon Dec 15 00:32:09 2014 UTC,"I predict we'll once again sign starting-quality defenders and think, ""I'm glad Zach Scott is coming back but we won't need him"", only for him to pop up after a freak combination of injuries and bad form among the new defenders and save the day yet again."
SoundersFC,2pb5q9,philwelch,3,Mon Dec 15 01:06:01 2014 UTC,"I have to imagine the inevitable fourth DP slot will be used to get a high level center back, so we're not stuck with a Djimi Traore/Jalil Anibaba 2.0. Scott would be phenomenal to have coming off the bench with his skill and versatility, though."
SoundersFC,2pb5q9,lordcorbran,3,Mon Dec 15 15:43:41 2014 UTC,"Hey, Djimi was pretty damn good between 2013 (when he was our best defender) and when he got injured last year. There will be times that we end up needing Zach next year though."
SoundersFC,2pb5q9,philwelch,1 point,Mon Dec 15 17:00:39 2014 UTC,"Djimi was good for a while, but he just couldn't hack it this year. We're going to need Zach Scott at times, for sure, but it'd be nice if it weren't as an every game starter. To have someone with his skillset coming off the bench would be hugely valuable, and especially as depth for the Open Cup/Champions League."
SoundersFC,2pb5q9,lordcorbran,1 point,Mon Dec 15 17:27:40 2014 UTC,"Watching Djimi fall while Leo stayed consistent was tough for me to watch, I really liked Djimi since he was the only one on our defense who HAD closing speed who stayed deep."

My best guesses are Kosuke Kimura or Hunter Jumper. Then maybe Raushan McKenzie or maybe David Estrada and try him at right back again."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,yahakum,3,Fri Dec 12 04:15:40 2014 UTC,I agree that there's a very good chance we take no one. Soumaré would be expensive but I like the thought of him and Marshall in the middle.
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,SonOfMechaMummy,5,Fri Dec 12 04:27:16 2014 UTC,"Here are my 5 players of interest:  CB Jeff Parke - Played really well with us the first time around. Hasn't been great since leaving but I think he could be a good pairing for Chad.  MF Kalif Alhassan - Was always dangerous for POR when they played us. Could be a good attacking CM coming off the bench.  G - Jon Busch/Troy Perkins - Hahny is retiring and it looks like we are letting Ford go. Both of these guys have proven themselves as starters in the MLS so if they are cheap enough they might be worth a shot, especially since we are playing in CL.  CB Bakary Soumaré - He is tall, quick, only 29, and from Mali. Djimi part 2?"
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,Looorney,3,Fri Dec 12 03:18:16 2014 UTC,"Perkins makes 250K, Busch 173K. Maybe a chance of Busch but Perkins isn't worth it at all. I'd prefer to get Gruenenbaum at 85K if he's still available at that point, which would surprise me."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,metameh,1 point,Fri Dec 12 07:06:15 2014 UTC,Good call on Gruenenbaum getting picked up. I didn't know enough about him to have rated him but SJ apparently does.
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,sounders127,2,Sat Dec 13 03:33:44 2014 UTC,"I would love to see Parke come back and play at his previous level with us.  Him and Marshall would be near unstoppable.  Unfortunately, like you said he hasn't been great since leaving so there is a bit of a risk."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,yahakum,1 point,Fri Dec 12 05:36:52 2014 UTC,"With Parke's ear issues and Marshall's history of concusions, one bad training accident could easily end both their careers.

SoundersFC,2p1jv8,sounders127,3,Fri Dec 12 14:47:18 2014 UTC,"I just read Rosales opted out (which I THINK means he will re-sign with Vancouver). At DeRosario's age and salary he probably won't get taken today. Maybe next week, when you can try to negotiate a lower salary."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,metameh,1 point,Fri Dec 12 17:04:36 2014 UTC,"I feel like Moffat wasn't very good last time we had him, so I don't know."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,Looorney,1 point,Fri Dec 12 19:16:26 2014 UTC,I know he had some awful games towards the end of his last season with us but I still think overall he was good.
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,metameh,-2,Fri Dec 12 20:24:06 2014 UTC,"Mauro Rosales would be an upgrade over Pappa, but we'd have to pick him up in RED2 because he's a DP. Edit: If you think Pappa is better than Rosales then you didn't watch Mauro at Vancouver. There's a reason Mauro played almost every game for Ajax whereas Pappa was relegated to the bench in their respective two years in the Eredivisie. I love Pappa, but recognize that we can upgrade at every position and we should if we can.  Kosuke Kimura could be an interesting pick to replace Yedlin if he leaves as expected, but we can probably find better (maybe even on our current roster), so we should wait and see if he falls to RED2."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,Looorney,4,Fri Dec 12 05:20:17 2014 UTC,"Rosales is 33 though, so we wouldn't be able to keep him for long.  Pappa younger, faster and he costs a hell of a lot less."
SoundersFC,2p1jv8,yahakum,1 point,Fri Dec 12 05:36:13 2014 UTC,"I completely agree with you, but because of Mauro's age, Pappa would still get plenty of playing time: either as a sub or by starting the games Mauro/Neagle/Dempsey can't.  I also have several ulterior motives for wanting Mauro on the team: 1. He gives 100% and is fun to watch. 2. It would hopefully shut up the ""we need a play maker"" contingent for a season or two."

SoundersFC,2ow5zs,SonOfMechaMummy,17,Wed Dec 10 19:34:25 2014 UTC,I was afraid we would lose Azira or Remick (who I'm still holding out hope to be good) so this was pretty good.
SoundersFC,2ow5zs,pamtastrophe,5,Wed Dec 10 19:46:55 2014 UTC,"I'm holding out hope for Remick too. I think he has potential and I think he'd be a good fit to replace Yedlin. Plus, he's super nice."
SoundersFC,2ow5zs,Looorney,3,Thu Dec 11 00:00:09 2014 UTC,"I don't think he'll replace Yedlin (LB vs RB).  Remick will replace Leo when he retires and I'd like to see Evans put at RB to free up a space in midfield so we could run Pappa, Pineda, Alonso, and Neagle."

SoundersFC,2ow5zs,CascadiaKid,7,Wed Dec 10 19:41:58 2014 UTC,He had a great year!
SoundersFC,2ow5zs,night_owl,5,Wed Dec 10 21:10:38 2014 UTC,"eh, he did have a better season than I expected from him, but I think it is probably about time to move  on and seek out an upgrade at the position. He isn't getting any younger.   Don't get me wrong, I'm grateful for everything he's done for this team and I do not  crave to see him in another team's colors, but I was thinking it might have actually been  a positive thing if he had been picked because it would have forced their hand and it would have prevented them from sitting back complacently and waiting for a crisis before they bother to find another LB."
SoundersFC,2ow5zs,CascadiaKid,2,Thu Dec 11 03:13:09 2014 UTC,"I would agree his age is a bit of a question mark. But, if he can keep playing at a high level like he did this year, there is no reason to rush into replacing him."
SoundersFC,2ow5zs,Looorney,3,Thu Dec 11 06:27:30 2014 UTC,"With Traore retired and Anibaba gone, we had virtually no depth at CB. Losing Scott (either to being picked or retiring due to being picked) would have left us too thin there.  Or at least thats my guess on thought process."

SoundersFC,2ow5zs,The_Sultan_of_Swing,3,Wed Dec 10 21:53:27 2014 UTC,He would be worth it if they gave him more game time. His off the bench stats are really good.

Auto battery is pretty great, and that's where a good deal of Gorilla FC and ECS folks hang out. The food however is.....eh...  Clever Dunnes has die hard Sounders fans on the staff. Good food, good beer selection, and a fun crowd.  95 slide has a lot of TVs but a bunch of goddamn useless hipsters on the staff that don't know a touchdown from a PK. But their food is good, and when they can be troubled to open on time, they're all right.   Charlies on Broadway is great in a pinch. Again, good food. Decent beer selection. Sadly, they don't have the best TVs in the world, but you can see them from pretty much anywhere in the bar.   Then up on 12th, you have the Rhein hous (formerly Von Trapps). Great beer selection, if you like German beers. Same with the food. If you like Schnitzel, you're in for a treat. If you don't like German food, then avoid it.   Next to that, you have the Chieftan. Generic pub grub, decent beer selection, and a big room with a BIG Tv that we all crowd around. It's a lot of fun, because everyone watches the same thing. Not just a bunch of smaller plasma screens with 3 or 4 people around them. Just one big projector. At least it was when I went there last, but it's been a while.

I totally forgot about St.Andrews that place is legit! My parameters were what bar would play the Sounders over Seahawks if they played at same time closest to Capitol Hill. That would be G&D and St.Andrews.
SoundersFC,2os6kw,sp_the_ghost,1 point,Wed Dec 10 17:34:04 2014 UTC,"There are a lot more than that. Schultzy's on the Ave, Fuel and Temple (though you might have an ECS issue here too), Café Presse, among others. And really, most places will put the Sounders on a TV if you ask."
SoundersFC,2os6kw,chriscab,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:07:32 2014 UTC,Yeah! I was just saying that G&D and St.Andrews were fairly close to Capitol Hill and would put the sound on and make the Sounders the primary game if they played the same time as the Hawks like the LA away match a few weeks back. I forgot about Presse and I guess Capitol Cider shows matches every so often as well
SoundersFC,2os6kw,sp_the_ghost,1 point,Wed Dec 10 18:50:49 2014 UTC,"Oh, I forgot Rookies in Columbia City, Kells, Fado, The Dray... There are a bunch of them in the City. Apparently there's a place called Tippe and Drague in Beacon Hill that is reliable, too.  These may not be ""soccer bars"" but you're damn near certain to have the game on."
SoundersFC,2os6kw,rophel,2,Wed Dec 10 18:10:05 2014 UTC,"Plenty of places will show games, especially sports bars.  Obviously local teams (esp. football) will take precedence, though.  I don't have first-hand experience.   I know Pioneer Square has some places that prefer soccer over football.  Fado, Fuel, etc.  Henry's Tavern by Safeco (not really soccer-specific) is the most comfortable to watch the World Cup/Champions League but I rarely go there.  Generally Fuel is the best spot and you know they'll have any match on.    On the Hill, Auto Battery and 95 Slide are likely to show anything you ask for.  That said, if Seahawks are on and they're packed they probably won't switch anything away from that."
SoundersFC,2os6kw,thekrnone,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:35:12 2014 UTC,I had the same problem in University District. It was the Sounders v Dallas game while back. Literally no bars were playing the game until finally asked for them to put it on.
SoundersFC,2os6kw,brad_at_work,1 point,Tue Dec 9 19:37:48 2014 UTC,Haven't lived on the hill in a couple years but one of my favorite memories was at the Summit Public House when they changed the channel away from Huskies for Sounders.  The football people in the place were so confused and distraught and it was wonderful.  As I don't follow football at all I have no idea how (un)important the Huskies game may have been though

SoundersFC,2os6kw,csinser,1 point,Wed Dec 10 02:59:20 2014 UTC,The Hillside Bar is where GFC typically goes to watch away Sounders games. Can't comment on their non-Sounders TV schedule though.

SoundersFC,2op57u,CiscoCertified,9,Wed Dec 10 18:58:37 2014 UTC,I just wish we were keeping Yedlin so he could be on the list too. :(
SoundersFC,2op57u,PendragonDaGreat,4,Mon Dec 8 23:44:55 2014 UTC,He's auto protected as a homegrown...but I know what you mean.
SoundersFC,2op57u,sherlocknessmonster,1 point,Tue Dec 9 00:17:51 2014 UTC,"Also, isn't he protected by having his rights owned by Tottenham? I doubt the owner of a players' rights would be satisfied if he were shuffled to a completely different club/system without any prior discussion."
SoundersFC,2op57u,Turkalator,1 point,Tue Dec 9 08:02:29 2014 UTC,"I'm not entirely sure (because MLS), but I think Yedlin is owned by Tottenham and loaned back to the MLS, since all players are under contract with the league (why the MLS get a cut of his transfer fee).  The Sounders just have his rights which could be acquired by another team in the MLS.    Edit:To be more clear, I do think that certain transfer agreements might require a player to only play for the team in which the player is loaned (which could very well be true in Yedlins case); so required to be protected.  This is why the single entity MLS can get confusing, because the player is essentially loaned to the league and assigned to a team."
SoundersFC,2op57u,sherlocknessmonster,5,Tue Dec 9 08:13:25 2014 UTC,"No, Tottenham don't own Yedlin's rights yet. The transfer was agreed to but it wasn't carried out, it was just promised to be carried out by summer 2015 (with the option of Spurs taking him earlier)."
SoundersFC,2op57u,philwelch,1 point,Tue Dec 9 09:06:39 2014 UTC,"You're correct, Tottenham doesn't technically own Yedlin...but I am guessing Tottenham will excersize their option in the January transfer window, with Yedlin joining them soon...I know there is talks of a transfer with a loan back to the Sounders...and he could possibly with the Sounders at least a part of the season next year.    Anyways in this scenario we would also protect (if he wasn't auto protected) to get our sweet, sweet transfer dollars."
SoundersFC,2op57u,sherlocknessmonster,1 point,Tue Dec 9 09:50:50 2014 UTC,"I couldn't imagine Tottenham being pleased with that situation if they were forced to keep Yedlin stateside for the remainder of the European season and he was pushed into an unfamiliar team. It would set a bad precedent for any other club who wants to do a similar buy/loan back deal. It seems like a highly irregular situation, but I doubt it will be an issue. Still, Garber should make sure that any investments foreign clubs make in MLS are relatively protected. A loan should be well respected at the very least."
SoundersFC,2op57u,Turkalator,8,Tue Dec 9 08:28:11 2014 UTC,"Notable players left off in my opinion were Azira, Remick, Gonzalez (Age?), Scott (Age?) , Cooper (Salary?). I think last on first/off was probably Barrett over Azira."
SoundersFC,2op57u,Schwa142,18,Mon Dec 8 23:46:11 2014 UTC,Sigi specifically said Scott wouldn't be protected because he would retire before playing for any other team...
SoundersFC,2op57u,alexfrancisburchard,15,Tue Dec 9 00:51:00 2014 UTC,"I love Scott. He makes mistakes more than we'd all like, but he loves his club, and fights like hell for it, and for that I really love having him out there!"

SoundersFC,2op57u,bgatz,6,Tue Dec 9 19:55:47 2014 UTC,"With Ashe and Villifana unprotected, I don't think we'll see Remick get picked up. Azira and Cooper(more likely) are the only two I can see leaving."

I get that he's not young but you can't fill an expansion roster with kids, you have to throw some veterans in there.  Teams would be stupid to pass on him.  Sucks, I thought he had his best year."

SoundersFC,2op57u,JustinCasy,3,Mon Dec 8 23:40:13 2014 UTC,I'm hoping parsemaine doesn't get picked. Id like to see him get some playing time next season whether that be USL or first team.
SoundersFC,2op57u,BrokenClockwerk,3,Mon Dec 8 23:56:43 2014 UTC,"Doubt he'd get picked, considering he hasn't played a single minute of MLS play. He's not old, but he's not young either (he'll be 27 by the time next season starts), so it's not like he has crazy upside. If teams are looking for reliable forwards for depth, there are better options available, including Cooper."
SoundersFC,2op57u,iamnotbadger,2,Tue Dec 9 01:45:39 2014 UTC,barett? over remick?! if we lose leo and remick like wtf? at least we can only lose 2.  please dont take azira or remick.
SoundersFC,2op57u,fletcherscotta,5,Mon Dec 8 23:53:58 2014 UTC,"I'm pretty sure the rules are that after you lose one player you get to protect another. So if we lose say Leo, then we would protect Remick."
SoundersFC,2op57u,joylongdivision,2,Tue Dec 9 00:22:15 2014 UTC,"Remick isn't really very good, especially compared to Ashe and Villafana who are also on the table. And Leo's old. I think both will be back."
SoundersFC,2op57u,Looorney,2,Tue Dec 9 01:49:05 2014 UTC,"Remick looked very good the few times he played for us this season.  A few mistakes, but very solid on heading clearances.  And he has speed out the asshole.  But I agree, I don't think he will get taken."
SoundersFC,2op57u,joylongdivision,1 point,Tue Dec 9 03:21:15 2014 UTC,"I dunno, I'm not in full agreement. He looked pretty horrible in the NYRB game (gave up a penalty and got manhandled by Lloyd Sam all game), and to me has looked pretty mediocre in all his other appearances (dawdled on the ball, had trouble picking the right pass). I think with time he could come good (like Rose has), but I wouldn't be comfortable with him starting. I'd rather see Kovar from what little we've seen of him."

I lost my mind when he scored against Algeria, too.   But fuck LA. Keane with his slimy half-grin. Arena bitching about figuratively everything.  Zardes... I kind of like him.  FUCK LA.  That's where I'm at right now. Thanks for letting me blow off some steam."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,Looorney,12,Mon Dec 8 15:55:13 2014 UTC,I also like Zardes.  I've never seen him get hotheaded.  Ever.  It balances out Keane.  I fucking hate Keane.  And his stupid celebration.  I can do a somersault too you bitch.
SoundersFC,2on4mm,Looorney,7,Mon Dec 8 19:13:16 2014 UTC,Yes. I like Ishizaki. There are several likable players... but then there is Keane.

SoundersFC,2on4mm,cantbeassed,7,Mon Dec 8 20:21:11 2014 UTC,"The MLS turned the entire season into a marketing ploy when they decided to basically back a single team to make an interesting story and promote the visibility of the league. It's embarrassing.   Where was the coverage of the possibility that a team would be the first to win all 3 major pieces of silverware? Nowhere, just coverage of a smug, washed up footballer that couldn't hack it through what would otherwise be his prime. JK probably saw LDs issues before he did and left him at home to pave the way for the next generation, like Yedlin.   I've had lengthy debates with friends about how much you can call conspiracy on the season, but it's obvious that the league wanted the season to go a certain way and it did. At the end of the day, you'd be hard pressed to argue the Sounders weren't the best team of the season."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,Audicity,3,Mon Dec 8 18:18:31 2014 UTC,"You can't argue it. We have the shield, we had the best record. The tournament after the season has no real bearing on the season (to the point they even erase yellow card accumulations and have different rules etc)."

What a season to become true fan: Open Cup, Supporters' Shield, Chad Marshall earning Defender of the Year, and that sweet, sweet Obachip getting Goal of the Year!  Yes, MLS and Cascadia Cup would have been icing on the cake, but that's what next season is for.   Personal highlights for me this year: My newborn son's first smile at an Oba Flip. Scoring tickets near the ECS and taking two out-of-towners to their first MLS game; they still talk about what a blast we had. Getting my official Oba jersey in the mail. Stopping a lane of traffic while running around my car after Dempsey nabbed his hat-trick against the TImbErs.   Looking forward to next season as we end the LA ""dynasty"" and crush the Keane Girl Squad."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,bjdm151,7,Mon Dec 8 18:37:12 2014 UTC,"I remember saying in the preseason prediction thread that I wasn't expecting a whole lot. I worried that it might be a transitionary season, after we traded a bunch of our players and brought in new ones.  It turned out to click a lot faster than I thought it would.  It was a really entertaining season. It's fantastic to see Dempsey and Martins working so well together, and it's especially cool to see Martins excited to stay in Seattle for the near future. Marshall was an amazing pickup, and he absolutely deserved defender of the year. Pappa and Pineda were wonderful surprises. Neagle really showed his worth in the last couple of months of the season, too.  All in all, it was the best season to follow yet. We have a lot to be proud of, and a ton to look forward to for next season."

SoundersFC,2on4mm,clickmyface,1 point,Tue Dec 9 03:41:51 2014 UTC,This. Maybe Brad slides back into defense? Off season pick up?
SoundersFC,2on4mm,ajrcoyote,9,Tue Dec 9 05:21:11 2014 UTC,"A highlight for me was in the post on /r/soccer about LA winning, European soccer fans said ""I thought the Seattle already won this?"" Why would they think that? Because in the Premiere League (and indeed most every league) the championship is awarded to the #1 team and thats that. No playoffs. Why? Because being #1 is the hardest thing you can do. In MLS, being #1 is the hardest thing you can do. We did it. At home. Against LA. With 2 goals. 2-0. What an amazing year.   For me and my brother, sitting 8 rows back with ECS and watching Marco Pappa score two goals right in front of us to win our first Supporters Shield has been the greatest Seattle sports moment of our lives. That's saying something, especially for my brother who is about as big of an NFL and MLB fan as you can get. But I pulled him into soccer so we got that going for us which is pretty great."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,WizE206,5,Mon Dec 8 21:52:09 2014 UTC,"I think I am over our loss now so I guess its time to move on. I'm just happy I found a team that I love and can support. Super excited to be able to see Oba and Clint next year and see what changes we will make. Whatever changes we make we have an awesome team to build around and hopefully get to fill another DP spot.  I am also curious as to when changes will start being made, and what changes we will most likely go with. I am guessing we will be trying to procure some defensive talent."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,stealth_sloth,6,Mon Dec 8 13:21:02 2014 UTC,"Well I'm guessing were gearing up for some offseason moves given that we voided 8 players contracts.  Also it was an impressive season and next year when we win the treble, things will be even sweeter!"
SoundersFC,2on4mm,WizE206,7,Mon Dec 8 16:14:53 2014 UTC,"We kept our starters. Six of the nine players we know aren't coming back weren't anywhere near the top of the depth chart either, so we don't necessarily have to replace them.   A new starting-caliber CB and a new backup goalkeeper look like the obvious moves."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,Happlestance,3,Mon Dec 8 18:28:42 2014 UTC,"I don't really mean replace players, as much as I mean adding depth of more quality to out ""secondary platers"". Also... YES ANOTHER CB would be outstanding, before scott stepped up last season we had some major issues there."
SoundersFC,2on4mm,samfreez,3,Mon Dec 8 23:25:46 2014 UTC,CB? Seems like we need players across the whole back line. For depth if nothing else.

I'm saddened that the postseason ended the way it did; fuck LA, seriously, but at least we lost to the team that won it all?  As a native Vancouverite, I'm conflicted, but I'm 110% a Sounders fan after that Cascadia Cup flop-fest, and possibly the most BS goal situation I've ever witnessed.  I'm glad Anibaba is gone.  I got sick of watching him do silly things and pass the ball haphazardly.    Definitely glad I got to watch Yedlin in person.  I look forward to following his career, and would love to see him in a Sounders uniform again before his career is done.

SoundersFC,2oelve,SonOfMechaMummy,1 point,Fri Dec 5 23:31:22 2014 UTC,"Don't underestimate the value of a dependable back up. Until training camp, there is really no way of knowing where the young guys will end up especially with S2 starting up."
SoundersFC,2oelve,MowwMoww,2,Fri Dec 5 23:47:32 2014 UTC,This man knows his shit.
SoundersFC,2oelve,Warvanov,3,Sun Dec 7 13:32:05 2014 UTC,"Especially considering we are in CCL next season, which is the ultimate test in depth."
SoundersFC,2oelve,stealth_sloth,4,Sat Dec 6 01:42:52 2014 UTC,"I don't see Pineda on that list, which is surprising, unless there's something about him that I'm missing."
SoundersFC,2oelve,steerbell,4,Sat Dec 6 01:09:26 2014 UTC,"Pineda is definitely a possible protected player, especially since he wasn't waived. It is of my opinion however that it would serve the Sounders well to look for someone younger. If Rose is up for the job, I would have him start, or else look for a 26-29 year old CM. I found that Pineda did well in most matches but against LA for instance, he wasn't able to keep up with the pace and skill of Juninho and Sarvas. Hell, if we find a RB, Evans might retake that starting spot."
SoundersFC,2oelve,PoopsMcGee7,5,Sat Dec 6 01:47:20 2014 UTC,"Pineda is a no-brainer. He's cheap on the salary cap. He's an excellent possession-minded midfielder, something we're really lacking in otherwise. He partners exceptionally well with Alonso. He has tremendous experience to pass on to younger players, and will be particularly valuable as we go back into CCL play next year. And we've just played better with him on the field this year. In fact, I would go so far as to say that him ending up protected would be a safer bet than Pappa or Neagle (although I expect all three will be)."
SoundersFC,2oelve,yahakum,1 point,Sat Dec 6 08:13:13 2014 UTC,I thought Pineda was signed on the cheap this year and expects to get paid well for next.

SoundersFC,2oelve,reeseallen,2,Sat Dec 6 10:03:10 2014 UTC,You bring up a good point about an aging roster. Are Rose/Remick/Zavaleta the replacements for Pineda/Gonzalez/Scott? Or are the younger three just the current backups? If the team sees them as future starters then we'd better try to hang on to them. Otherwise I'd keep as many starters as I could.  Another thought is to look at a team with less depth and try a 2-for-1 trade. That would give us one less player to worry about protecting while upgrading another position.  Does Chicago have a decent CB left on their roster?
SoundersFC,2oelve,scubadger,0,Sat Dec 6 02:31:16 2014 UTC,Greg Cochrane wouldn't be a bad pickup.
SoundersFC,2oelve,philwelch,3,Sat Dec 6 03:47:12 2014 UTC,"I disagree on the potential of Zava/Remick. Remick has something that Zava doesn't have, which is blazing speed. I believe (I could be wrong) that Remick is actually just as fast if not faster than Yedlin. The only reason we didn't see Remick starting this season is because Leo is always so damn solid. I think we'll see Remick get a lot of interest next season on S2, an may even start next season in place of Leo. Who knows? It's all speculation, but I like silly season."
SoundersFC,2oelve,philwelch,0,Sat Dec 6 01:42:29 2014 UTC,"Agree to disagree. While I definitely think Remick could be a solid player once he has developed, I just haven't seen enough from him. Talent is one thing, but producing with that talent is another. Zavaleta on the other hand was able to get a lot of experience, and watching him while he was on CUSA, I felt like his development would be helped immensely by playing alongside Marshall, as the third CB. I still want to keep Remick, don't get me wrong, but not above the other 11. If Zavaleta doesn't resign or is brought to S2, then I would definitely protect him."
SoundersFC,2oelve,smokey815,2,Sat Dec 6 02:02:21 2014 UTC,1) Obafemi Martins  2) Clint Dempsey  3) Ozzie Alonso  4) Chad Marshall  5) Stefan Frei  6) Brad Evans  7) Lamar Neagle  8) Marco Pappa  9) Gonzalo Pineda  10) Leo Gonzales  11) Kenny Cooper or Chad Barrett  Leaving Pineda and Gonzales off the list is laughable. And surely we must protect at least one of our better backup forwards (Cooper or Barrett).
SoundersFC,2oblqj,jaschac,12,Fri Dec 5 01:57:01 2014 UTC,"I'll never understand why people are calling for him to be fired.  Playoff appearances every year he's been the coach, 4 USOCs and a Supporters Shield.  What, because we didn't win the MLS Cup again, he should be fired?  Guess what?  There are 18 coaches who didn't win an MLS Cup this year.  Should they all be fired?  Really?  And if Sigi did get fired, who do these people suggest should replace him?  No one ever answers that one.  I understand not being happy with anything other than complete victory, but seriously, in what other sport is a playoff appearance every year for 6 years straight NOT the hallmark of a damned successful team?"
SoundersFC,2oblqj,juiceboxzero,2,Fri Dec 5 07:28:44 2014 UTC,"I don't think he should be fired but some of your questions are false dilemmas.  First, the playoffs in MLS are over 50% of the teams.  With what is spent on the team, playoffs should be an expectation every year.  For comparison, would you consider the Atlanta Hawks to be a successful NBA franchise?  They've made the playoffs 7 seasons in a row.  They've had 3 different coaches in that time frame.  There are plenty of managers that could replace Sigi and make the playoffs with the talent we have on the team.  The question is whether they'd have 4 US Open Cups and a Supporter's shield.  And the answer to that is still ""No.""  I think it is important to keep pressure on players and coaches to perform.  I don't think Sigi considers this season a success regardless of the accomplishments.  He wants an MLS cup.  That's a good thing.  If he was satisfied with the playoffs every year then I'd say he should go."
SoundersFC,2oblqj,TheChoke,2,Fri Dec 5 08:26:48 2014 UTC,Still waiting for that Super Bowl...
SoundersFC,2oblqj,insultant_,2,Fri Dec 5 15:53:22 2014 UTC,"Certain cities, and certain sports have certain expectations. Fair or not, Seattle expects their soccer team to make a run at the MLS Cup every season. Sigi's Sounds squads seemingly fall apart in the playoffs.  Also, the team is raking in cash, and would certainly have the ability to sign a talented, fairly big name coach from overseas. It's not that Sigi is a slouch by American standards, but he's nowhere near the best coach we could get if we really wanted to.  All-in-all, I am fine with the extension, he's earned it. But I also understand the notion that we expect more. Alabama Crimson Tide have an expectation for a National Championship every year, if they go too long without one, they will get rid of their coach. Same idea for the Yankees; playoffs are fine and dandy, but they require championships."
SoundersFC,2oblqj,matthewalan8,3,Fri Dec 5 16:30:36 2014 UTC,"But have foreign coaches proven effective? Some of the best managers in the league have been Vermes, Kreis, Schmid, and Arena, all Americans. Nelsen flunked out at Toronto, Rennie did the same in Vancouver. Pareja has been decent but not excellent with Dallas. Sure, if we could get Bielsa, I'd be ecstatic, but we can't get someone like him, and I don't think we'd be able to get someone who would be immediately successful who would be head and shoulders above Sigi."
SoundersFC,2oblqj,BrokenClockwerk,1 point,Fri Dec 5 21:00:46 2014 UTC,Alabama and the Yankees have that expectation because they have already won a lot of championships.  Not exactly comparable to Seattle.

SoundersFC,2oblqj,night_owl,0,Fri Dec 5 04:08:08 2014 UTC,"To his credit, Schmid was willing to change. He switched up the Sounders' training routine, brought in several new faces and even discarded the team's pregame prayer.   but he has also shown that he is unwilling to change some things, like his refusal to use any subs before the 65th minute unless you have a bone protruding from broken skin, no matter how desperate the situation or how poorly a player is doing. Or there is his tendency to resort to humping longballs downfield into a crowd and hoping something lucky happens when they are desperate for a goal.   He's proven that he is a good regular season coach who is adepting at building a squad, but he always gets outcoached in the playoffs when he can't rely on simply having superior talent. It's sad when the team desperately needs a goal to keep the season alive and it seems like they are simply out of ideas and he waits until the 80th minute to try to bring on some attackers and shake things up, but by then it is too late.   As long as Sigi is in charge we will have good teams that are pretty balanced and highly competitive and always make the playoffs, but I can't see us rising above the pack and winning the MLS Cup. He does just well enough to keep his job, but never as good as he should do with the talent and resources at his disposal.   /end rant"

SoundersFC,2oaonr,MagnoliaSeattleFan,11,Thu Dec 4 21:15:11 2014 UTC,Yeah I get he didn't play much but he is young and showed promise. Maybe they plan on signing him to a USL-Pro deal?  Edit: Maybe same thing with Zavaleta?
SoundersFC,2oaonr,overruns,3,Thu Dec 4 21:23:14 2014 UTC,That actually makes a lot of sense.
SoundersFC,2oaonr,MagnoliaSeattleFan,2,Thu Dec 4 21:34:14 2014 UTC,That is my guess for both of them. Neither would be seeing much of first team minutes and Cooper and Barrett consistently were in the 18 ahead of Okoli. Zavaleta makes way too much money for his current skill level at CB and will never see the field on the first team as a forward. If they don't sign to Sounders 2 and get picked up in the Expansion Deafest least we get allocation money. If they do sign with S2 they get to develop more in a familiar environment and get consistent playing time.
SoundersFC,2oaonr,john_mcrotten,1 point,Thu Dec 4 22:00:31 2014 UTC,Also Okoli occupies a home grown slot and we want Jones and Morris signed as home growns for 2015.

Bowen I'm kind of disappointed about, but that's mainly because for a low-ish rated player, he always scores loads when I play him in my FIFA Sounders career modes :) I hope he finds success elsewhere, as he'll no doubt want to be more involved in first team affairs.  Anibaba... Meh, sure. Always seemed shaky whenever I managed to watch a Sounders game, so I won't miss him too much.  Apam... This is indeed a weird one, considering he never played a game for us. But if Sigi doesn't rate him enough to retain him, so be it.  Everyone else I can't really comment on all that much, but must thank Marcus and Djimi for their years of service with us, and wish them happy retirements."
SoundersFC,2oaonr,TheBarberOfFleetSt,1 point,Thu Dec 4 22:17:43 2014 UTC,"My guesses: Okoli to S2 if he isn't picked up by another team. Bowen still young and our forward core is packed, this gives him opportunity to break into another clubs starting lineup and we have too many forwards already - maybe resign with a pay cut or move to S2. Apam apparently couldn't pass basic fitness tests to get into actual training. Anibaba may still get re-signed but with a pay cut depending on whether he is willing to take a pay cut and how the back line signings, drafts, etc. shape up this year."

SoundersFC,2o2p8w,steerbell,2,Wed Dec 3 05:26:40 2014 UTC,Retire and Asst coach S2?
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,fnmonk,4,Tue Dec 2 19:59:07 2014 UTC,Defender and someone to partner with Ozzie. We know the defense needs help with Yedlin leaving Gonzo and Scott aging and the others kinda unproven. Pineda is getting older and is a bit injury prone. I love him but if we get a second DP to spend then I'd use it here. I'd use the first one on the defense.
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,overruns,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:19:41 2014 UTC,This. Especially since DeAndre is leaving
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,bGivenb,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:57:47 2014 UTC,"Personally I'd use it on a CB since Marshall is 30. This is of course unless Zavaleta, Lowe or Ockford are ready. I have no idea about either of these three since I have never watched them play but I wouldn't mind Marshall showing them the ropes if they were ready. In this case I'd bring in a DP on the RB or LB position, maybe give Remick a shot to take a starting role. Then you'd have a nice mix of young with potential and experienced guys who can preform and help the young guys along."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,overruns,4,Tue Dec 2 21:42:06 2014 UTC,"I don't think either of the 3 young guys are quite ready yet, but could see at least one of them (assuming they are still around after the expansion draft) making a case for starting at CB. I really think we need true play maker in the middle a la Mauro Rosales."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,john_mcrotten,1 point,Wed Dec 3 02:40:34 2014 UTC,"I doubt they are quite ready, but hey I am not a coach. That being said if one was on the cusp of being a every game starter I would risk it and pair them with Chad since he is good and can mentor and then sign a DP defender. While I want a play maker in the middle I think the defense should still get the first DP we sign. If a second one is open then I would sign a Mauro Rosales type of player, someone who can keep possession, create plays and be a bridge between Oba and Dempsey and our defense.  Edit: I'd actually love someone like Mix...but part of that is a man crush on him and I know that won't happen."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,overruns,5,Wed Dec 3 04:57:51 2014 UTC,"Defense first and foremost... but I think we should look at an attacking mid. Martins form is not a guarantee and having that third player to press the attack full time (ala Keene, Landycakes and Z guy who's name I can't spell on my phone)."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,vonIsar,2,Wed Dec 3 04:15:01 2014 UTC,"Honestly if we could get two new DP's I would look for either a good box-to-box midfielder / play maker to shuttle the ball up to Dempsey or Martins, so Martins / Dempsey don't have to drop so deep to pickup the ball.   My second choice would honestly be try to find a good DP RB or LB because I think we can find a competent / good MLS central defender for less than the price of a DP.   Honestly if we could pick up George John in the re-entry draft and re-negotiate his contract down a little he might be a good local recovery prospect to start alongside Marshall. Worst case scenario we have Djimi Traore V2 from this season.   If we want a DP Central Defender, I think the best in the MLS market would be Aurelian Colin anything better we need to look abroad.   Otherwise like others said Zaveleta or Ockford might be ready, I think Lowe who spent most of last season injured will be on S2.  However I think our teams actual most pressing need is fullbacks as of now we have Remick & Leo Gonzalez. I don't trust Leo to start every game due to fatigue and Remick I am not sold on."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,Jack2142,1 point,Thu Dec 4 07:36:08 2014 UTC,I think they should build a 3-5-2
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,lightjedi5,1 point,Wed Dec 3 20:29:07 2014 UTC,"Naaaaah.  352 requires 3 strong technically and tactically competent center backs though. We only have 1, plus we've got a good defensive prospect coming through the pipe in Kovar who could slot into outside back. Sigi's got a decent system IMO, no need to change what isn't broken."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,joylongdivision,2,Wed Dec 3 20:40:38 2014 UTC,"Sigi has a system, but it isn't apparent from his lineup. He fits the formation to the players. This season was a good example of that (he called it an amoeba) as was his time at the helm of the Galaxy where he ran a 3-5-2 (another year he won the supporters shield).  His system is to push the tempo of the match to force turnovers and get out on the transition as much as possible, generally attacking the top of the box more than other coaches in MLS. This past season was an extreme version given Mauro Rosales' crosses still being fresh in our memory and never having players of the quality of Clint and Oba."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,metameh,1 point,Thu Dec 4 08:35:03 2014 UTC,"Obviously we need better defense. We need at least two (given Yedlin will likely be leaving) fairly young defenders, and I think one of those needs to be a DP. After that, I like how our midfield is looking right now, so if that doesn't change too much, I'd like to see a really strong third attacking option. Someone who is, again, pretty young, who is a very high quality player and can support Oba and Clint. I've always dreamt of Erick Torres coming to the Sounders to play forward along side Oba, with Clint sliding underneath them as more of an offensive mid fielder."
SoundersFC,2o2rjm,hhdslater,1 point,Wed Dec 3 23:48:45 2014 UTC,"Let's take a look at our likely starting lineup given carry-over, before expansion draft:   ST: Martins ST: Dempsey LM: Pappa CM: Alonso CM: Pineda RM: Neagle DL: Leo DC: Marshall DC: Scott DR: Evans GK: Frei   Looking at it this way, I could imagine that we pursue an upgrade for Scott (3 man DC rotation, Scott would get playing time at DC, DR, DL), a pacey winger who can help get service in to our strikers (thinking more diagonal passes and low crosses than floaters)...and that's probably my main shopping list.  Of those, I'd expect a winger because they're both costlier (demanding that DP tag) and available (plenty to harvest from Europe and South America).  Complicating this is a bad feeling I'm getting that we'll lose Scott to the expansion draft, and he'll retire. Then we will need defenders badly."

SoundersFC,2o0t38,TheBarberOfFleetSt,33,Tue Dec 2 06:05:16 2014 UTC,"It's meant to replace the penalty shootout, so it needs to actually take the place of the penalty shootout--if the aggregate score is tied at the end of regulation, add 30 minutes. If it's still tied after that, use away goals. If it's STILL tied after that, pens."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,RealMakershot,12,Tue Dec 2 07:21:44 2014 UTC,"I'll preface my opinion by saying I'm not as big of a sounders fan as many of you are. I go to a game on average once or twice a season and I wear my scarf and cheer, but otherwise I'm only watching a game every once in a while and half following the season and the players.  I grew up without watching soccer and I definitely don't know the intricacies of the game past how to play FIFA well.  But I'd like to be more into soccer and learn more about it.  Road goals are absolutely holding the MLS back.  It's my understanding that most leagues don't even have playoffs but that MLS added them to appeal to an American crowd.  Well I'm a huge football and baseball fan and I love watching playoffs, but I had way more fun watching the lead up to the supporters shield than I did watching the playoffs.  Playoffs are about elimination and there needs to be a clear winner and loser because someone is losing their opportunity to play for the championship.  When the sounders played two tied games and then moved on because the (slightly) higher scoring tie happened to occur on the road I was disgusted and couldn't help but feel bad for fans of the other side.  And now the season just ends after winning 2-1 at home and tying up the aggregate.     I'm not a soccer expert, so I won't pretend to know what's better, but I'd at least like to see extra time played, if not an additional game.  I understand how penalty shoots are not reflective of the actual skill of the sides and can be luck based, but at least they are decisive and a victory or loss would be more accepted.  Frankly I'd be more interested the MLS if they didnt have playoffs at all than the current system, the win of the supporters shield was very exciting this year, though I know scheduling isn't always going to work out so perfectly."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,disastrophy,3,Tue Dec 2 16:11:16 2014 UTC,I'm with you; league points is totally sufficient to declare a best team. It works for the EPL.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,3,Wed Dec 3 00:08:57 2014 UTC,"It doesn't work with an unbalanced schedule though. That being said, playoffs are just not common in Europe. Central America has them and they work very well."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,Amerikanarin,6,Wed Dec 3 19:47:27 2014 UTC,"Why can't we just have overtime again?  We got through on away goals, but we were playing really well in game 2 against Dallas, and I think if it went to overtime we would have won."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,Epistemify,5,Tue Dec 2 16:49:27 2014 UTC,"I still don't like the 'home and home' series. Why can't it just be a single game played at the stadium of the team with home field advantage, which goes into extra time and then penalties if needed (a la the World Cup or really any other soccer tournament anywhere else)? Then there's no need for silly tiebreakers like away goals, and everyone can be happy with a clear winner."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,gaberdine,2,Tue Dec 2 17:04:25 2014 UTC,Money.   But I agree. People were bitching about the length and pace of the playoffs. We'd be done now if we didn't play 2 legged rounds.

SoundersFC,2o0t38,gaberdine,0,Wed Dec 3 01:10:33 2014 UTC,Nah I don't agree. Americans just need social connection to the activity. Bowlers and dart players and lots of hobbit sporting fans have real leagues.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,3,Wed Dec 3 01:34:02 2014 UTC,"Frankly, I'm not a fan of the away goals rule. I know it's cliche to say that after having just lost to the rule so I'm not making a big deal about it, but since you asked here's my reasoning.  Primarily my objection is that it gives an advantage to the lower seed in the tournament, or at least reduces the advantage that the higher seed has. The higher seed should have an increased advantage, not a reduced one.  I realize that away goals are the standard for tournaments around the world and in situations where you want the odds to be as level as possible then I think it's fine, but in MLS playoffs the advantage should go to the higher seed."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,Warvanov,3,Tue Dec 2 19:03:27 2014 UTC,Most leagues don't have playoffs and they rely on Cup tournaments for single-elimination action. We should eliminate the playoffs and make the Supporters' Shield be the championship.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,3,Wed Dec 3 00:07:14 2014 UTC,I think it should go to the team with the better record to give a real advantage to finishing the season strong.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,bwc_28,4,Tue Dec 2 19:09:25 2014 UTC,"It's an antiquated rule from when traveling used be much tougher on players. You can't even compare traveling nowadays to what athletes dealt with during the 50s which is what this rule was originally designed for. Especially in MLS where fans typically aren't as fanatic as Europe (Seattle and a couple other fanbases are unique), away goals simply don't mean as much. For a team like us where our fans travel well, away goals in MLS are meaningless. There's almost no travel and when we play away at the Quakes or Chivas there are nearly as many Sounders fans as home fans. It still makes sense in Europe to a certain extent but not in MLS."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,zag83,5,Tue Dec 2 07:52:18 2014 UTC,"Hated it before, hate it now. Having home field advantage is supposed to mean something, so when you're tied on aggregate you should get the extra time at your home field, not have it be determined because we need to copy every retarded rule that the rest of the world uses to determine soccer outcomes."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,francostine,7,Tue Dec 2 18:00:20 2014 UTC,"It's a great rule. As it was shown, It's a lot harder to score goals on the road. The goal that the Galaxy had was a true cracker, and deserved to be the match winner.   Yes, I'm sad that they lost, but I'm also happy with mls adapting more European rules."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,stealth_sloth,1 point,Tue Dec 2 12:08:55 2014 UTC,"This is one of those justifications that sounds good at first, but doesn't really make sense.  If you scored more goals on the road, that also means you failed to score more goals at home (where it should have been easier). That's what it means if the aggregate is tied.  It's like the Supporter's Shield tiebreaker this year, most wins. Sure, it sounds reasonable. ""Wins are harder than ties, so most wins will be tiebreaker."" Except most wins also means most losses. Most away goals also means fewest home goals."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,francostine,1 point,Fri Dec 5 10:15:42 2014 UTC,I feel like the SS should come down to goal difference and not wins.

SoundersFC,2o0t38,bwc_28,-4,Thu Dec 4 17:35:46 2014 UTC,It'd be interesting to get a breakdown by team. Because as I've said in other posts teams like the Sounders who have fans that travel well practically have home games at every stadium.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,doublemazaa,5,Wed Dec 3 08:20:19 2014 UTC,"In 2014 the Sounders and Chivas were the only two teams that scored more on the road than at home.  In 2013 Columbus scored more on the road.  In 2012 Toronto and Chivas scored more on the road. Dallas had equal road/home goals.  So, in 57 team-seasons, only 5 teams scored more on the road than at home."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,bwc_28,0,Wed Dec 3 08:47:35 2014 UTC,Interesting. I wonder why those teams were different.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,doublemazaa,2,Wed Dec 3 08:50:42 2014 UTC,"Except for this years Sounders, all of those teams were bad.  The 4 other teams finished 16th, 16th, 18th, and 19th in the Supporters Shield standings (out of 19).  When you're not scoring much at all, you have a better chance of out scoring yourself on the road than at home."

They just detract from the season record which is totally sufficient to determine a champion."

SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,0,Wed Dec 3 00:51:12 2014 UTC,"There would be much more TV revenue if the Cup was what people were watching. Every team of every scale has a chance to play, too, so there's even extra revenue at small scale."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,thethundering,2,Wed Dec 3 01:35:07 2014 UTC,I like it just fine. Honestly I was surprised when I found out the MLS hasn't had it all along. I've been watching the UEFA CL for years so the away goals rule feels very established so it's sort of weird how much controversy there is in the MLS fan base.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,sammysounder,2,Tue Dec 2 19:46:57 2014 UTC,"I'm mixed.  People forget that the goal of the rule is to prevent bunkering in the first leg by the, away team.  It definitely did that and the playoffs have been great.    The exception is us at LA and we clearly paid the price. If this happens again, Sigi will go for that precious away goal... which is the point.  The is has turned into a ""how to change the playoffs"" thread a bit so I'll throw out my favorite idea...  Eliminate home and home series.   I want a 3 game, world cup style group stage.  Seed 1 and 2 get 2 home games, seed 3 and 4 get 1"
SoundersFC,2o0t38,ssjobs,2,Wed Dec 3 16:06:31 2014 UTC,"I like the away goals rule, but I don't think away goals should be the first tie-breaker. I think if the series is tied at the end of the 180 min. we should play the extra time periods as the first tie-breaker.  If still tied then use away goals (not counting any scored in the first tie-breaker extra time periods) as the tie-breaker, and if needed go to penalties."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,Wineguy33,2,Thu Dec 4 05:06:48 2014 UTC,"The only fault I have with it is that I think players should be given the opportunity to play overtime in the second leg and determine the winner on the field of play. If it is still tied after that, non-overtime away goals count. Still tied = shootout."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,gear7,4,Fri Dec 5 17:20:08 2014 UTC,"I think soccer enthusiasts approve of it. That being said, it's confusing to your average MLS fan. It's also really fucking anti climatic. 0-0, Sounders win, 2-1, Sounders lose is how many people are going to see it."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,1 point,Tue Dec 2 06:40:49 2014 UTC,"Playoffs exist to fix leagues that cannot determine an annual winner. NFL rules are too physically brutal to permit a round-robin tournament; 62 games a year would literally kill the players. Instead, they play 16 games to see who should go to the knock-out tournament.  Soccer has no problem playing round robin, so why not just count the points and declare a victor? It works everywhere else in the world."

SoundersFC,2o0t38,CascadiaKid,1 point,Fri Dec 5 17:25:08 2014 UTC,I would way rather see MLS have and NFL style playoff. IMO the aggregate series takes away any advantage the higher seeded teams have. Every leg should be one game played in the higher seeds stadium with the exception of the final which can be a neutral venue. Games will be a lot more exciting when teams are playing to win instead of playing not to lose or trying not to concede an away goal.
SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,1 point,Tue Dec 2 19:30:25 2014 UTC,"The league should be won by the team with the best record, just like every other league in the world.

SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,1 point,Tue Dec 2 20:37:46 2014 UTC,"The closer the fans sit to the pitch, the greater their home field advantage. Teams in big stadiums like Seattle and LA don't get much advantage."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,stealth_sloth,1 point,Wed Dec 3 00:02:20 2014 UTC,"A very good point has been raised. It's easier to score on the road than at home; thus, we should award those who score on the road. It's about a 60/40 split. Hence the away goals rule, as naturally reflecting the relative quality of the two teams. But we really aren't taking this far enough; now that I've thought about it, here are some other actions we should jump on immediately.   The ""away overtime"" rule. If the game goes to overtime then both teams score, the away team should win rather than going to penalties. It's only fair because they scored the harder goal. The ""shoots second"" rule. The team that shoots second in a penalty shoot-out wins if it's tied after 5 shots. Statistically, the team that shoots first (determined by coin flip) wins penalty shoot-outs by a 60/40 edge - so clearly if it is tied 3-3 after the first five shots, the second team shot better. The ""first-half goals"" rule. If a regular season game is tied after 90 minutes, the team that scored more in the first half should get it. About 55-60% of goals are scored in the second half of games and just 40-45% in the first half. We should recognize the clear superiority demonstrated by a team that went up 2-0 in the first half only to end the game tied 2-2 by giving them the full 3 points and the other team nothing.   I think if we are quick to take advantage of these possibilities, we can finally have a truly fair soccer league.  Or we could acknowledge that it's all ridiculous and the only thing that should matter is aggregate score. Score more than the other team, congratulations you won. Score the same, it's a tie."
SoundersFC,2o0t38,aidenr,0,Fri Dec 5 13:33:51 2014 UTC,"MLS should have the same format as EPL. There should not be playoffs at all; the Supporter's Shield would then be the league championship. For people wanting knock-out elimination action without aggregate scoring, we already have the US Open Cup much like England's Football Association Cup. By EPL standards, Sounders already won the double.  edit: Playoffs exist to provide closure to leagues that cannot afford to play a full round-robin. NFL players would all be dead if they played 62 games a season, so instead of killing everyone they play 16 and then count the results toward seeds in a knock-out tournament. MLS doesn't have that issue and already awarded the season trophy to the Sounders with the most league points. The MLS tournament is a bad rendition of the US Open Cup which already awarded the Sounders. Kill the playoffs, let two trophies be awarded each year to the Sounders with the most wins."

People seem to forget that this time last year we were watching Portland epically collapse in the playoffs instead of still competing. The win would have been nice but to come from past season's dumpster fire to what was achieved this season is a huge turnaround."

SoundersFC,2nys8q,SensibleParty,4,Mon Dec 1 19:11:27 2014 UTC,"I don't think it's Ozzie specific, but just defensive minded players, who stop at nothing, like Ozzie. Azira isn't there. We need to bulk up our defense, hands down. Ozzie is a phenomenal athlete and much like Chad Marshall, we need him."
SoundersFC,2nys8q,pamtastrophe,1 point,Mon Dec 1 19:43:28 2014 UTC,"Azira isn't there.   Azira isn't Ozzie but he played very well in his place in the 1st leg against LA. He has a lot of potential and he is someone we need to keep on the squad. He is very defensive minded, much like Ozzie, and has good positioning, passes well out of the back, and can push forward if necessary.  Our biggest issue was a CB partner for Chad. Health at LB is key too. I love Leo but he is getting old and I doubt he is up for playing a full season. Remick did well in his appearances but he has a lot of work to do to earn a starting spot."
SoundersFC,2nys8q,canucknuckles,2,Thu Dec 4 04:57:36 2014 UTC,"I mean he lives up to his nick name, the Honey Badger... he simply doesn't give a shit about much, except when the other team has the ball, and he wants it back.   It's tough to say whether he was the difference in this series. CD had an incredible look at a goal in the first leg, and had a few more last night.  When it comes down to a 1 goal game, it's nearly impossible to pin it on one player."
SoundersFC,2nys8q,BugSTi,1 point,Mon Dec 1 21:37:14 2014 UTC,"Alonzo's touch wasn't great last night -- he probably played injured -- but he made a lot of errant passes.  So did Pineda.  They played great for about 20 minutes but otherwise we didn't look so good on offense.  Distribution was pretty bad, forcing players like Oba to compete for aerial balls with much taller players in the final 3rd."
SoundersFC,2nys8q,mcmSEA,0,Tue Dec 2 04:58:30 2014 UTC,I think our defense is still good but we struggle with our offensive possessions and keeping it on the opposite side of the field.

SoundersFC,2nzis6,JustinCasy,1 point,Tue Dec 2 04:07:25 2014 UTC,Authentic/ match jersey is the same quality that is worn by the players. Replica/ stadium jersey is generally a looser fitting jersey usually without a few of the finer details. Unless your seeing something about this particular jersey that I'm not.

SoundersFC,2nwril,littlenicky174,3,Mon Dec 1 04:23:45 2014 UTC,Him and Oba really elevated this team to its true potential. I am really happy to be a sounders fan and am so glad I got to see them kick some major ass this season and get a few trophies along the way. Can't wait for next season!

SoundersFC,2nwril,matthewalan8,2,Mon Dec 1 05:58:44 2014 UTC,"I feel like he might not have been completely healthy near the end of the season.

SoundersFC,2nwril,AlienMutantRobotDog,5,Mon Dec 1 04:55:32 2014 UTC,Then why are we the ones always to bleed in this bloodbath? I want the other guys to to open their vanes in the playoffs
SoundersFC,2nwril,MCPriest83,4,Mon Dec 1 05:57:30 2014 UTC,Look at the LA - RSL scoreline this year and tell me that's not a blood bath.

SoundersFC,2nwril,andhelostthem,9,Mon Dec 1 05:05:37 2014 UTC,They are a very solid team
SoundersFC,2nwril,DecoyJon,3,Mon Dec 1 04:35:48 2014 UTC,"We did lose to a good team, but I know this Sounders team at full was better. I just think his job security should be questioned a little bit with our playoff shortcomings. Sigi is still one of the greatest MLS coaches ever whether he leaves or not!"
SoundersFC,2nwril,Wineguy33,10,Mon Dec 1 04:48:03 2014 UTC,We should always be questioning on how to improve. But Sigi is not the change that is needed.
SoundersFC,2nwril,Audicity,12,Mon Dec 1 04:49:26 2014 UTC,"New Cb to pair with Marshall. I like Scott, the man bleeds rave green, but he should really be a 3rd choice CB.      Replacement for Yedlin is a must.     Possibly a good solid creative attacking CM. Pappa is great in spurts but a true creative attacker behind Oba and Clint with Ozzie to back him up would be just the bee's knees."
SoundersFC,2nwril,RubiksSugarCube,6,Mon Dec 1 04:58:37 2014 UTC,"But Sigi is not the change that is needed.   Sigi has always been the problem. It's definitely not the players. We have the best team in the league. Every team has the ability to turn it up come playoff time except the Sounders. After six years, countless different line-ups and not even making an MLS cup final the blame should be squarely put on the coach. Winning these consolation prizes like the US Open Cup and Supporters Shield are nice but they don't make up for the short-comings in the playoffs."
SoundersFC,2nwril,hhdslater,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:54:15 2014 UTC,"I can understand your frustration, but I don't see how the Supporters Shield is a consolation prize compared to the MLS Cup.  I'm not a particularly Eurocentric fan but I think the Shield is easily as important as MLS Cup and possibly more so.  I don't think that Sigi should be the focal point of the blame.  He took a very difficult situation with a ton of new players, a locker room that needed rebuilding, and a few players that were expected to struggle for playing time and turned them into the best team over the length of the regular season, while also winning the Open Cup.  In my book, thats a successful season."
SoundersFC,2nwril,you_amaze_me,1 point,Tue Dec 2 21:06:55 2014 UTC,So you guys would rather get a new coach and rebuild into a new system over three years? We are almost to the finish line and you want to turn around and start the race again. Let's rebuild after a crappy season.
SoundersFC,2nwril,hhdslater,1 point,Thu Dec 4 00:06:51 2014 UTC,Oba or Alonso in my mind. Honey Badger is the general of our midfield but Oba makes the strikes.

SoundersFC,2nwrie,truestunner,16,Mon Dec 1 04:23:33 2014 UTC,There was a period of 20 or 30 minutes toward the end of the first half where Seattle was playing Seattle's game. It was lovely and has been missing towards the end of the season.   That all went away after halftime and once again they were lobbing long balls that always always turned into an LA counter and losing possession on every third touch.  I'd really like to hear what Sigi is going to do to fix that part of our team's game because it is so obviously not working and yet we keep doing it.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,wac_,8,Mon Dec 1 05:35:12 2014 UTC,where Seattle was playing Seattle's game   That was such a beautiful glimpse at how we got here.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,mastermoebius,11,Mon Dec 1 05:50:23 2014 UTC,That fuckin goal from juninho... Completely changed the layout of the game.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,soiled_trousers,2,Mon Dec 1 04:24:30 2014 UTC,Pure dumb luck too. His first goal since 2013 and you want me to believe he meant to place it for a ricochet off the post? Hardly.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,warox13,5,Mon Dec 1 07:25:21 2014 UTC,That first half really should have been 3-0. We had so many shots at the goal that there is really no excuse for missing so many opportunities.

SoundersFC,2nwrie,bwc_28,29,Mon Dec 1 04:52:16 2014 UTC,"Random thoughts:  Frei gets man of the match for us. His saves made it an away-goal decider and not an LA wins 4-2 on aggregate decider.  The truth is that we struggle in the post season every year. I don't know what it is, but we just aren't good in it.  I know Portland is our Cascadia rival, but the truth is I hate the Galaxy more."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,trickjarrett,16,Mon Dec 1 04:37:52 2014 UTC,"I don't think we struggled this year. I think we fought well against stiff competition. This wasn't a collapse like we've seen in the past season. You can see the leadership from the team really affect the on field play.   Lastly, the West is much harder than the East so I think that's just something we have to rise above."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,5,Mon Dec 1 04:43:23 2014 UTC,"I am defining struggle as ""Cannot win and advance reliably"" where as LA seems to excel in the post season no matter their regular season."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,trickjarrett,-2,Mon Dec 1 04:45:42 2014 UTC,They have the largest budget in MLS. Why is this a surprise?
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,7,Mon Dec 1 04:46:06 2014 UTC,"I think that's a bit of oversimplification. TFC has the biggest budget and that went poorly for them, but even if it was just budget - we're right behind them, why is the gap in post season so large?  Salary info - Note, NE does not have Jones in this graphic and Oba's raise."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,trickjarrett,3,Mon Dec 1 04:49:16 2014 UTC,I think that graphic was also before Oba got a raise/extension.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,metameh,1 point,Mon Dec 1 06:49:33 2014 UTC,"Well it's definitely an over simplification. I think a lot has to do with experience and leadership. Next year will be a bit easier with Donovan gone, Keane a year older."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,4,Mon Dec 1 04:51:23 2014 UTC,"I mean yes, LA will weaken next year. But we'll also age. I don't think we lose any big players to retirement but we're losing Yedlin etc."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,trickjarrett,1 point,Mon Dec 1 04:56:22 2014 UTC,We spent the entire off season last year getting younger and taller (and less espensive). We don't have a lot of work to do... We need another young CB. I think we can get away with moving Evans to RB and having Pappa and Neagle start with Rose coming off the bench as first sub. Probably want to pick up someone really young to train for RB.  EDIT: I just remembered we signed Onyekachi Apam for CB. Eager to see what happens there.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Dec 1 05:09:02 2014 UTC,"I'm not disagreeing that we're going to make changes and hopefully be armed for it next year. I was just posting the depression fueled whinging about ""Why can't we win it!!!"""
SoundersFC,2nwrie,trickjarrett,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:13:26 2014 UTC,I completely understand. Trying to stay positive!
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Dec 1 05:19:13 2014 UTC,I wouldn't get your hopes up about him. This is the last article I saw about Apam. I'm willing to be pleasantly surprised though.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,siradia,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:39:44 2014 UTC,Well TFC doesn't even make the playoffs so they're excluded from this argument.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Copernican,3,Mon Dec 1 07:06:48 2014 UTC,"This wasn't a collapse like we've seen in the past season.    Instead it was a collapse like we saw quite a bit this season. The Sounders start playing lots of low percentage long passes that give away possession and players in the offensive half trapped in 1-on-3 situations with no one in position to be an outlet. We can do better than repeatedly taking goal and free kicks that are lobbed up to be, at best, a 50/50 ball.  Really disappointed but not at all surprised, to be honest."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,wac_,2,Mon Dec 1 05:40:20 2014 UTC,We started lobbing in the last 5 or 10 minutes. Is it a great strategy? No. Does it win games? Rarely. But I don't think that's a collapse. Many teams turn to this when hope is dimming. We didn't get blown out 3-0 away like in 2011. We put up a solid effort.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Dec 1 05:42:44 2014 UTC,"The lobbing wasn't until the last 5 or 10 minutes, but the low percentage passes and getting people trapped with no outlets was the first part of the first half and pretty much the entire second half, and most of our losses and near losses this season as well.  When the Sounders start playing that way I want to leave my seat and go get a stronger drink, because when they play that way, I'll usually need it."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,wac_,2,Mon Dec 1 05:56:19 2014 UTC,You are telling me that we lose when the opposition puts pressure on our forward balls. This is how you win games. Sometimes we have a moment of brilliance from Oba or Clint to work through that pressure but you can't expect that every single game. I agree that last game our tactics were lack luster and the lobbing is shit but my point stands that this isn't a collapse. We fought hard and well but simply not good enough.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Dec 1 06:01:33 2014 UTC,Our passing lanes through midfield get shutdown and the team collapses. The backs try to force passes that won't work and we wind up down 35/65 on possession and giving up silly goals on the counter to increasingly desperate attempts to get the ball upfield.  I'm hoping it's something tactically that Sigi can improve in the offseason because Bruce Arena appears to have our number in this regard.  Clint and Oba may as well not be on the field when this is happening because they're rarely going to see a ball they'll actually be able to keep possession of. They both get very chippy when this is going on.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,wac_,2,Mon Dec 1 06:19:33 2014 UTC,This is a pretty solid analysis minus the possession stat. We definitely get out possessed but not to that extent.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Dec 1 06:23:42 2014 UTC,"Yes, you're right, I'm exaggerating the possession, it was not that bad even in the away loss. It just felt ridiculously lopsided watching the match."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,wac_,1 point,Mon Dec 1 07:04:10 2014 UTC,"I honestly thought Ozzie was MotM even with leaving early. His composure and possession on the ball bailed us out all first half.  It's too bad he went down early, but those are the breaks."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,lojer,13,Mon Dec 1 06:12:33 2014 UTC,"Hell of a season, unfortunate that they couldn't play one more. LA did a really good job neutralizing Oba and our boys just gave away too many. Too bad Ozzie was playing hurt, if he was 100% it probably would have made all the difference.  On the plus side, only three short months till next season, and I'm sure it's going to be another thrill ride. In the meantime, Go Hawks!"
SoundersFC,2nwrie,RubiksSugarCube,6,Mon Dec 1 04:27:41 2014 UTC,"only three short months till next season   Indeed. I'm consistently surprised how fast the off-season goes here. We'll have a variety of drafts, loads of new-team announcements, S2 news, and the boys will be back in pre-season camp in as little as six weeks."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,jaschac,3,Mon Dec 1 04:39:39 2014 UTC,"Yep, plus I'm planning a trip down to Tucson to catch a couple of the Desert Diamond Cup matches in February."

SoundersFC,2nwrie,jaschac,1 point,Mon Dec 1 07:41:51 2014 UTC,The best thing about short off seasons is that your team did well in the playoffs the year before.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,lojer,11,Mon Dec 1 06:11:16 2014 UTC,"Honestly, I ain't even (too) mad. We got a(nother) USOC and a SS. It would have been great to snag a treble, but I can live with this. And we were damn close to winning tonight. It was a fun, effective season and I just don't have much to be mad about.   I think, if anything, I'm more disappointed that I have to live through another week of the ""LAG show"" and the non-stop LD lovefest. Yes, they are good, and yes, he was/is important to US soccer, but it gets really tired. I'd almost rather we'd lost to anyone else - yes including portland - than to LA tonight.   Moving forward, my biggest concerns are - once again - our back line. Frei is large-and-in-charge, and as long as concussions don't kill Marshall he'll continue to be the backbone of the defense. But we're about to lose several starters, and I won't be surprised if two or three more names are added to that list (our starting backline is old)."

I want to be mad about the one goal we let in, but I can't. We played a great game just got really unlucky in a shot that was put perfectly. We had so many chances to make this game 3-1."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Audicity,12,Mon Dec 1 04:26:25 2014 UTC,"To paraphrase from a famous movie, ""God damn it, would somebody tell me why I keep watching these games?"""
SoundersFC,2nwrie,RubiksSugarCube,7,Mon Dec 1 04:29:24 2014 UTC,We had two really big missed opportunities from the game in LA. We fought hard and we deserved to win just as much as LA. Great series all around.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,5,Mon Dec 1 04:37:11 2014 UTC,It took until 90:28 before the ball was even in play in stoppage time. That was bullshit.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Nekokeki,0,Mon Dec 1 05:53:54 2014 UTC,not the refs fault. We played like shit all second half.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,adrianp07,21,Mon Dec 1 08:57:13 2014 UTC,"Why do they always wait so long to sub in Pappa? He's a complete game-changer. I have no fucking idea why they never start him. Fucking AZIRA got more playing time than him. Azira is shit.  Such a frustrating game to watch. So close, again. We can never seem to get by the Galaxy."

SoundersFC,2nwrie,joylongdivision,5,Mon Dec 1 05:06:10 2014 UTC,"Last four games vs LA:     sea-lag 2-2 2-0 0-1 2-1     XWLW. It doesn't matter quite, since they managed to sneak past us into the cup final, but that's a pretty strong record and one I don't have too many regrets about."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,jaschac,4,Mon Dec 1 07:40:17 2014 UTC,"Historically, Galaxy are more of a threat than MLS Timbers. We've had a decent year against LA, but they've still knocked us out of the playoffs in three of our six playoff appearances. I would like to see a full breakdown of our history against both teams, but regardless of hard data, when I see a SEA-POR fixture I think, ""That should be a fun game."" When I see a SEA-LAG fixture I think, ""We've got to get these points.""  You also neglected to mention the 0-4 pummeling we took at home against LA this year. The only time I'm worried about Timbers is when we play in Portland. Galaxy has shown little fear when it comes to playing us at the Clink."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Turkalator,3,Mon Dec 1 08:26:03 2014 UTC,"You also neglected to mention the 0-4    Oh sure. Heck, I neglected to include the entire rest of our history against the Galaxy - it's pretty depressing. :)    I was mostly just trying to point out that we'd done well against them recently. I wouldn't quite go so far as to say we've ""figured it out"" or anything like that, but it does feel like we're getting closer to getting it."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,jaschac,2,Mon Dec 1 10:28:01 2014 UTC,"I was mostly just trying to point out that we'd done well against them recently   yes. yes, this. I'm proud of our team."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,mycitysfilthy,1 point,Mon Dec 1 16:48:05 2014 UTC,I couldn't agree more
SoundersFC,2nwrie,corntorteeya,4,Mon Dec 1 05:03:43 2014 UTC,Azira is shit.   Really? I thought he played very well the last two games. Alonso shoes are hard to fill and Azira seemed solid in the first leg. He didn't have enough time in the second for me to really get a sense of his play there.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,stealth_sloth,2,Mon Dec 1 07:26:31 2014 UTC,"Pappa is well-suited to that super-sub role. He's not as fast as Neagle, not as strong on the ball (physically; he can be pushed off it more easily), and he doesn't have the same endurance to track up and down the field. On the other hand, he has a beautiful left foot and amazing vision. So we let our other four midfielders get the other team good and tired out. Pappa comes in later when the other team can't close down as fast so he gets more space to make use of that vision and technical ability, and we don't need to worry about him getting worn down and needing an early sub nor is it as much of a concern that someone might simply outrun him on the break.  Alonso fills a very specific role that nobody else on our team can duplicate, but Azira and Pineda come closest. With Alonso needing to come out (recovering from injury), and Pineda already on the field and tired, Azira was the natural choice. Pappa for Alonso would have been a bizarre substitution that would have required a whole series of tactical adjustments, while Azira was closer to like-for-like."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,MockingDude,2,Mon Dec 1 06:29:28 2014 UTC,"I'm still frustrated by his role in the team; I see your point, although I still think he was a starter. He at least could have been subbed in around the 70th minute or earlier,"
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Dec 1 15:32:14 2014 UTC,"Because if the game went for another 30 minutes you want to be able to score another goal to prevent the shoot out. However, I would have liked to see him around the 70th minute."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,matthewalan8,9,Mon Dec 1 04:37:56 2014 UTC,"Once LA scored a goal, it wasn't possible for there to be extra time or PK's. It was going to be decided after 90. The goal for LA came in like the 54th minute. Papa should have come in shortly thereafter."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,polyensid,2,Mon Dec 1 04:41:27 2014 UTC,"Actually is was once the second goal was scored, since the game couldn't end 1-0 anymore."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,0,Mon Dec 1 04:59:56 2014 UTC,That's not true at all. If sounders and LA both scored again it would have gone to ET.  EDIT: Nevermind!
SoundersFC,2nwrie,DaaCoach,6,Mon Dec 1 04:45:31 2014 UTC,Nope. Would have been 3-3 and 2 away goals for them to our zero.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,joylongdivision,3,Mon Dec 1 04:48:10 2014 UTC,"No. That would put aggregate at 3-3, with 2 away goals for LA to our 0, meaning they advance."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,fush,4,Mon Dec 1 04:47:44 2014 UTC,Nope because LA would have lead on away goals.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,MockingDude,3,Mon Dec 1 04:47:53 2014 UTC,"No, it wouldn't have. Then LA would have 2 away goals, and the Sounders would still have 0. Same result."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,matthewalan8,2,Mon Dec 1 04:48:16 2014 UTC,"As others have said, that's incorrect. The goal from Juninho was basically worth 1.5 goals. So LA was up 2.5 to 2. If we scored, we'd be up 3 to 2.5. If LA scored again, they'd be up 3.5 to 3. So on and so forth.  Edit: Downvoted by being correct? I'm assuming it came from /u/vuduwastaken because he got a bunch of DVs."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,joylongdivision,2,Mon Dec 1 04:50:44 2014 UTC,"Downvoted by being correct?   You appear to have simply been latest to the party. Oh, and you complained about downvotes."

SoundersFC,2nwrie,overruns,7,Mon Dec 1 06:26:33 2014 UTC,"As disappointing as that was it was a hell of a run this year. At the end of the playoffs last year we were calling for Sigi's head. We just won at home against LA, had a great game for the most part and fell to a tie breaker. While this is disappointing I am extremely proud. We had ups and down but no collapse. We were close and that hurts but in the end it was a great year."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,hhdslater,8,Mon Dec 1 04:33:20 2014 UTC,Wouldn't be a Sounders season if we didn't come up short. I'll always support you though. But fuck you........ but I love you......... and also fuck you......... <3
SoundersFC,2nwrie,betacatenin,14,Mon Dec 1 04:42:04 2014 UTC,"The away goal giveth and the away goal taketh away. Sad that this was Yedlin's last game with us. Sad we couldn't finally get to the final. We have a lot to look forward to next season. Until then, go Revs next week."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,3,Mon Dec 1 04:33:46 2014 UTC,Not necessarily his last game. He's technically on loan from the spurs and can be for parts/all of next season as well. Time will tell
SoundersFC,2nwrie,betacatenin,4,Mon Dec 1 04:42:10 2014 UTC,"Ahh, I wasn't sure if that was the case, thanks for the clarification. Hope to see him next season then."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,P9J0S6,7,Mon Dec 1 04:43:10 2014 UTC,Don't go near /r/mls.   I hate the galaxy.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,SounderBruce,8,Mon Dec 1 05:28:34 2014 UTC,"So close. Great effort from the boys, though. I can say that I'm pretty happy with the double, but the treble was in our reach."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,matthewalan8,7,Mon Dec 1 04:24:20 2014 UTC,"As big as Oba came up for us all season, he looked almost uninterested tonight. Rarely connected on passes, and spent more time on the turf than on his feet   Outside of that, I'm content with the season we just had. Don't confuse that with being satisfied. I wanted the MLS Cup more than anything else.   This was our best shot. Losing Yedlin is going to hurt badly, and who do we replace him with? Ugh, so frustrated."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,4,Mon Dec 1 04:46:43 2014 UTC,Brad Evans.   Then have Neagle start on the right and Pappa on the left. Rose comes off the bench for the first replacement in the midfield.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,wac_,2,Mon Dec 1 04:57:32 2014 UTC,"I expect one of Neagle, Pappa, or Rose to get poached by the expansion draft. So we're probably going to have Azira mixed up in there in a larger role next season."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:48:49 2014 UTC,I think Neagle and Pappa will be protected. Rose will not but I'm not sure if other teams will pick him. I really like him so I hope not... :( Azira will definitely have a major role as a CDM off the bench. I don't see him starting though or playing an offensive role.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,ramen_feet,2,Mon Dec 1 05:57:22 2014 UTC,"Same thought, I love oba but this game he seemed more content with trying to get a card than keeping the ball. My only assumption is that the field was cold and slippery, and he was just overreacting in his head"
SoundersFC,2nwrie,mraybern,3,Mon Dec 1 16:54:33 2014 UTC,"This season was amazing. We have a lot to be proud of: Open Cup, Supporters Shield, a solid (most of the time) back line, sending little DeAndre off to the Spurs, etc.   But, fuck, I wanted that treble."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Epistemify,15,Mon Dec 1 06:46:09 2014 UTC,FUCK THE GALAXY
SoundersFC,2nwrie,lightjedi5,3,Mon Dec 1 04:25:21 2014 UTC,"The boys fought well, sad it couldn't have ended in a W. I do not blame Sigi, LA has a good roster and Bruce Arena is a good coach. Two titles in a season is still not horrible, though! I'm overall happy with the season. Here's to next year! :)"
SoundersFC,2nwrie,aquaknox,3,Mon Dec 1 04:40:58 2014 UTC,"Well, I now know how Dallas felt. That away goals rule really hurts to be on the wrong side of."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,mycitysfilthy,3,Mon Dec 1 05:55:07 2014 UTC,I'm just glad that the one goal we let in was a decent shot. Would've killed me if the deciding goal was them scoring like Dempsey did
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Dec 1 16:49:59 2014 UTC,Great effort all around
SoundersFC,2nwrie,k_princess,3,Mon Dec 1 04:25:16 2014 UTC,"My goodness did Azira suck.  Still, you hope the team would make better use of the chances they create.  There was plenty of room to advance in this series."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,matthewalan8,2,Mon Dec 1 04:28:26 2014 UTC,"It sucks that we technically won the game, yet our season is over."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,k_princess,11,Mon Dec 1 04:52:02 2014 UTC,The same rules that helped us advance past Dallas. Can't have it both ways.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,tehjimmeh,2,Mon Dec 1 04:56:18 2014 UTC,Not really upset about that part. Just saying that it sucks that we win yet we lose.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,2,Mon Dec 1 06:34:17 2014 UTC,"Fuck.  Can I just say though, in that 5 minute period between Evans' and Dempsey's goal, every Sounders player played with supreme confidence, like they all thought they were Messi or something.  It was AWESOME.  They were destroying LA.  Sadly, after the second goal, they started to sit back a little, especially in the second half...  LA seem to play more like that more of the time.  We seem to want to defend more.  We seem to wait until Dempsey and Martins catch a break rather than actually create anything for them.  With the utmost of respect to Sigi, and all that he has done for us, I think it's time for someone new."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,sideburnsy,3,Mon Dec 1 07:02:36 2014 UTC,Is it me or was Oba coming pretty deep back towards the midfield the last couple games?  EDIT: why would someone down vote this comment?
SoundersFC,2nwrie,i_like_turtles_zombi,5,Mon Dec 1 04:33:34 2014 UTC,Not just you. He seemingly switched with Neagle for a little bit there this game.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,joylongdivision,0,Mon Dec 1 04:58:27 2014 UTC,Please please shitcan Azira.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,i_like_turtles_zombi,14,Mon Dec 1 04:25:26 2014 UTC,He's fine. He was shit this game but a big reason we got out of LA only 1 goal down. No need to overreact.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,stealth_sloth,9,Mon Dec 1 04:29:09 2014 UTC,Why would they cut a guy that just got here this season and has played very effectively?
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Audicity,0,Mon Dec 1 04:26:58 2014 UTC,I can be on the team if all I do is kick the ball forward.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,bwc_28,4,Mon Dec 1 04:28:52 2014 UTC,"He has good defensive positioning, reads the game pretty well, is excellent in the tackle, and prone to kicking the ball wildly forward when he gets excited. The last is something he can work on.  For a guy in his first MLS season, he's done fine. He's got some developing to do, sure, but the potential is there. He's also pretty damn cheap on the salary cap at $50k. We'd be fools to cut him, and actually should be carefully weighing whether we want to protect him in the expansion draft."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,mycitysfilthy,6,Mon Dec 1 05:17:03 2014 UTC,He has played great in all other games. This was the first time I was generally pissed at watching him play.

SoundersFC,2nwrie,Getupkid8719,7,Mon Dec 1 04:38:33 2014 UTC,That very rule helped us advance to this stage.

SoundersFC,2nwrie,cpnAhab1,2,Mon Dec 1 04:30:25 2014 UTC,"I didn't say whether or not it wasn't.  I'm commenting on the fact that it appeared ok when it helped us, but is shitty when we're on the losing end."

SoundersFC,2nwrie,RubiksSugarCube,-10,Mon Dec 1 05:47:09 2014 UTC,Is it time for #FireSigi? I'll take it. You win the Supporters Shield you should at least make it to the MLS Cup finals. The tactics tonight were shit. Yeah keep hitting in crosses when our forwards aren't even close to the height of their CBs. Also why didn't our forwards/Pappa fight for the ball? They gave up. Such a shame in front of our fans.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,joylongdivision,8,Mon Dec 1 16:58:38 2014 UTC,only 2 of the last 12 supporters shield winners have won MLS Cup.  Not time to get rid of sigi.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,littlenicky174,3,Mon Dec 1 04:28:19 2014 UTC,"I was livid at Sigi at the end of last season, this time not so much. I thought they looked good for the most part but it's still pretty clear that this club lives and dies with Ozzie. They just couldn't control the midfield like they're accustomed to and it gave LA way to many opportunites."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Chug2778,7,Mon Dec 1 04:31:46 2014 UTC,"Is it time for #FireSigi? I'll take it. You win the Supporters Shield you should at least make it to the MLS Cup finals.    Dude, no.

SoundersFC,2nwrie,onemedicman,0,Mon Dec 1 04:36:20 2014 UTC,"I want to be positive, I really do, but I'm so fucking tired of saying ""next season"" after we fucking disappear in the playoffs. Whatever happens during the regular season, when we play SO DAMN GOOD, just vanishes as soon as the playoffs start, and it's depressing and disappointing. Yes, we got the US Open Cup (again), and barely got the Supporters Shield. But I'd give those both away if it meant a damn MLS Championship.  Just... Damn.  And fuck the Galaxy."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,vuduwastaken,4,Mon Dec 1 04:39:03 2014 UTC,I don't think we disappeared this year. I think this was by far our best post season. We have a very solid foundation and our players are young. Looking forward to what we can do next year.
SoundersFC,2nwrie,Slice2TonyBoogaloo,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:19:14 2014 UTC,"But that's just it. Once again, it's ""next year."" What will it take before our players/staff/coaches can get us over whatever damn hurdle is there for this team in the postseason? That's what's frustrating. We do so well in the regular season, and it just feels like we don't show up or we half-ass it in the playoffs.  The Sounders tonight simply disappeared after halftime. They had no drive, their passes were lazy for most of that half, I saw too many people standing around waiting for the ball to get to them instead of going after it and being aggressive. There was no hurry or hustle or ANYTHING until the last five minutes. And by then, once again, it's too late.  So, to me, we disappeared again, especially after having a great first half. And that's what's frustrating."
SoundersFC,2nwrie,qandnotyew,1 point,Mon Dec 1 05:21:22 2014 UTC,I think we didn't play super great in the second half but by no means did we disappear. This is nothing compared to last year or the year before or the year before that. We stood our ground and played very well against a solid team that has consistently had our number in the past.  We played very well overall and this game could have gone either way.

SoundersFC,2nwrie,mastermoebius,8,Mon Dec 1 07:14:13 2014 UTC,Except almost all European leagues follow the same rules.

SoundersFC,2nvrnk,SounderBruce,5,Sun Nov 30 23:36:23 2014 UTC,Came here to say the same thing. Can't forget beating SKC in injury time
SoundersFC,2nvrnk,twodudesnape,2,Mon Dec 1 01:29:17 2014 UTC,Thanks! I had completely forgotten about this one.
SoundersFC,2nvrnk,tennisgoalie,5,Mon Dec 1 00:12:07 2014 UTC,That goal call gives me chills still
SoundersFC,2nvrnk,jgood125,2,Mon Dec 1 04:27:21 2014 UTC,"I was at this game! Best game I've ever been to, by far."
SoundersFC,2nvrnk,john_mcrotten,2,Mon Dec 1 10:36:58 2014 UTC,I prefer the goal against KC more then this one. It's tradition to beat them in the final seconds.
