HermitCraft,3d52t0,03APR91,3,Mon Jul 13 16:17:36 2015 UTC,"CUDA...  Why NVidia still clings on that stuff is beyond me. OpenCL is far more accepted and widely used.  And Sony could fix this issue. Nvidia cards do support OpenCL.  If sony did not completely f#!k up their software, vegas should be able to just run the openCL code on the GTX (presumably a maxwell card?) just fine. But they probably have some hardwired, unnecessary checks in places where they should not be.    Unless I overlooked something and OpenCL does not run properly on newer cards."
HermitCraft,3d52t0,UTEster750,1 point,Mon Jul 13 22:12:32 2015 UTC,Poor X! All this worry and stress for just trying to improve his content.
HermitCraft,3d52t0,alpha_centauri7,1 point,Wed Jul 15 00:09:51 2015 UTC,"u/Xisuma:  The issue seems to be that Nvidia removed support for their old accelerated video encoder using CUDA (NVCUVENC) in favour of a new implementation using dedicated hardware (NVENC, way faster) starting with the 340 driver series. This requires developers to alter their applications. Support for the 970 was just added in the 340 series :P  There are some guides on the net where people copy files from the old driver to the new one to make it work again. But I didn't test it myself and so can't vouch for it. I also wouldn't count on it continuing to work in the future. This is the easiest guide explaining how to restore the files, that I could find with a quick search:  http://www.bandicam.com/support/tips/nvidia-cuda/#faq  But anyway, Nvidia also supports OpenCL, so you should theoretically just be able to continue using this in case the method above doesn't work. (Note: AMD supports OpenCL 2.0, Nvidia only recently 1.2. Could be that Vegas requires 2.0, but I doubt it. I also don't know about the quality of Nvidia's OpenCL support. They want to push their proprietary CUDA technology instead of the open-standard OpenCL and might very well cripple their OpenCL driver.)  Oh, and about your statement that you can only record 1080p with Nvidia. I guess you mean their ShadowPlay technology (that uses NVENC), that records and encodes the video directly to h264/AVC, so you save time and can record straight to the hard drive? Amd has that too, they call their's VCE. The support for it might not be as widespread as for NVENC, but there are at least a few dozen recording programs that can make use of it already, eg. their Gaming Evolved 'Gamer' program."

I think it's great to have working boats and other features in the w10 edition. Also the ability to have controller support for those on MCPE. I hope that MCPE will work with moga controllers.

In total, the nexus can hold 256 items, so 8 double chests, if one item takes one space. Using hexadecimal codes, (0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E,F) he associated each and every item one specific code, which he can then use to retrieve that specific item on a control panel. Since the items are stored in dispensers, he can also walk in the nexus and take items out manually if he needs a very big, or very specific quantity. Hope that helps. :)"

HermitCraft,3bn0i7,ArcherOnSkis,2,Tue Jun 30 22:19:23 2015 UTC,You know what would be awesome?  A mega UHC where the people from the subreddit UHC go up against the actual hermits.
HermitCraft,3bn0i7,ArcherOnSkis,1 point,Thu Jul 2 02:22:30 2015 UTC,Some hermits play UHCs with their patrons so its possible.  I wouldn't be against any hermit wanting to take part in a future /r/Hermitcraft UHC.  However mega UHCs are a difficult thing to handle but its something that could (but maybe not likely) happen one day.

However I did hear of this server before and I did watch Genny here and there when he was still on this server.  Nowadays I watch False, Mumbo, Biffa, Xisuma, Zueljin and Etho very actively and I'm having a lot of fun doing so.  Outside of Hermitcraft I'm really into DvZ and I've been picking up LoL again after a small break. I also play Age of Empires and TF2 from time to time. And obviously, survival Minecraft :P"
HermitCraft,3bbmj2,Juliandroid98,3,Sat Jun 27 23:31:03 2015 UTC,"Hey everyone, I'm Rockbuster, I did stuff in a UHC on here a while ago, I just got back from being on a very large piece of floating metal with no internet connection for a week and a half, and I didn't get around to writing this post until now because I have so many Hermitcraft videos to watch.   Anyway, outside of watching Cleo, Doc, Etho, False, Impulse, Mumbo, Tango, Xisuma and Zueljin and Zisteau and Pakratt I play... mostly just Minecraft on a certain SMP server. I've been playing some stuff like Pokemon and Mega Man Battle Network recently-ish, but I'm currently in a bit of a gaming rut. :/"

I'm not sure if he just picked a bad server hosting company or what but I'm just going off of what I have heard from my friends and what I have heard Guude say about the Playmindcrack server.

HermitCraft,39mhq4,robbyross,6,Fri Jun 12 19:56:20 2015 UTC,I'm not a big fan of any specific member (I'm more of an Etho and VintageBeef/Mindcrack guy myself) but I find that there are some good videos if you go to the hermitcraft website (hermitcraft.com) and just browse.
HermitCraft,39mhq4,diamondcreeper,2,Fri Jun 12 20:03:32 2015 UTC,"Beef, Bdubs and Genny were my favorites on Mindcrack but since that is gone I decided to switch to this one. I just want someone who is a good builder and uploads videos regurlarly..."
HermitCraft,39mhq4,rock_buster,8,Fri Jun 12 20:05:25 2015 UTC,"Give False, Zueljin, and xBCrafted a try then."
HermitCraft,39mhq4,78ford,6,Fri Jun 12 21:11:31 2015 UTC,I'd also add sl1p to your list as well.
HermitCraft,39mhq4,78ford,3,Fri Jun 12 21:17:45 2015 UTC,"A fair number of hermits are light on editing.  I recommend XB, Biffa, Xisuma and Zueljin are pretty good but the best answer is to just try  the hermits to find someone that you enjoy watching."
HermitCraft,39mhq4,EinsteinReplica,3,Fri Jun 12 21:14:46 2015 UTC,"I watch Mumbo and Xisuma for the Vanilla server, but I'm tempted to start watching Impulse, Tango and False :D"
HermitCraft,39mhq4,rock_buster,2,Fri Jun 12 22:45:52 2015 UTC,I encourage doing so. False's builds are some of the best on the server and Impulse's and Tango's redstone contraptions are always impressive.
HermitCraft,39mhq4,EinsteinReplica,2,Fri Jun 12 23:16:12 2015 UTC,"Mhmm, False is somebody I've been meaning to watch for a while, and after Mumbo's recent Shrek prank on her, I wanna watch her content :D"
HermitCraft,39mhq4,AppleEater01,2,Fri Jun 12 23:26:25 2015 UTC,"Depends. If you want Vanilla there are plenty of people playing.  Infinity: Dmac, Sl1pg8r and TFC"
HermitCraft,39mhq4,BradReligion1975,2,Fri Jun 12 20:54:06 2015 UTC,"I honestly think it's worth it to check out a video or two of everyone's and just choose for yourself. They're a very diverse group. As far as building goes, they've pretty much all blown me away. Especially this season. You can't lose there."

It's already been taken off so I can understand if you can't put me back on but if you could just put me back on and wait till tomorrow I would appreciate it. Again, sorry for all of this."
HermitCraft,39bbbg,dino_yoshi13,2,Wed Jun 10 20:12:53 2015 UTC,Since I changed it already I'll slip you onto the waitlist so you can have a spot if one opens up.

HermitCraft,396agm,Darknesschaos,2,Wed Jun 10 01:33:41 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised the hermits don't do more with the fact that head textures are static and determined on creation. I suppose it may have something to do with the typical reluctance of any MC youtuber to change their trademark skin... but there are some serious possibilities, especially with the new machine Doc made to enable players to get killed by another player on demand (even with no others online)."

HermitCraft,396aqz,78ford,3,Tue Jun 9 15:48:34 2015 UTC,"Well, I decided to unsub from /r/mindcrack and give away my PakkerBajZ user flair. The only thing that I really seem to be interested in talking about there is stuff that Zisteau puts out, so I figured that there's no point in being subbed when I can just post using AlienTube.  All the usual subreddit drama and the very... poorly-written comments by a certain user certainly also contributed to that decision."
HermitCraft,396aqz,rock_buster,4,Tue Jun 9 19:06:35 2015 UTC,I've had some interactions with a certain two users which influences my low level of activity on /r/Mindcrack and the subreddit drama can ruin the value of a subreddit to me.
HermitCraft,396aqz,nihontiger,2,Tue Jun 9 20:57:57 2015 UTC,The drama can be a bit much. I try to stay out of it and more or less poke my head in there when I can.

HermitCraft,3934mx,78ford,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:30:54 2015 UTC,"Definitely means something to do with reddit, CSS and mods not being perfect or something like that."

HermitCraft,3934mx,seannyyx,1 point,Tue Jun 9 00:01:19 2015 UTC,IT was happening on Mindcrack reddit too so must be something reddit is doing.
HermitCraft,3934mx,dino_yoshi13,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"Uhm, don't know how nobody has noticed this one yet, but talking about the sidebar change made me notice it. xB's name in the sidebar is missing the d at the end...  Actually, looking closer, it's doing that to a few of the hermits names actually pusing the text to under the icons. TFC, Monkeyfarm and Impulse are the same way."
HermitCraft,3934mx,dino_yoshi13,1 point,Tue Jun 9 03:07:59 2015 UTC,"Alright, so I found there is a width property associated with the youtube links that is restricting the entire width of the games to 65px. Since some of the names are longer than that, the last few letters are being shifted to the next line, being hidden behind the icons on the banner. Removing that css property should fix the problem with the banners."

Perhaps some warnings in chat next time. I did really like the beacon/chest idea as it added intensity and drove people to the surface. Overall it made for very entertaining videos.

Also, on the penultimate page of the Bank book it says that you can store over 40 levels of xp. It's just that the Bank book only has the conversions up to level 40. There is a click to update text on the first page which was in light blue which was probably why you didn't see it."
HermitCraft,380g97,Ray661,3,Sun May 31 22:57:17 2015 UTC,Xisuma has his plot world server that's free to join.

But i would definitely like sth like that, since my server isn't as active and it surely would be fun to play some survival with Hermitfans :)"
HermitCraft,380g97,noCix,2,Mon Jun 1 08:29:01 2015 UTC,"Don't know about you, but as far as I know servers do cost something :P And I doubt you are willing to pay for a several hundred slot server? Pretty sure that's what would be needed. If you take a look at the Patreon servers of some of the Hermits, for example Biffa and FalseSymmetry, there are already quite a lot of people there. A public survival server dedicated to the whole of HermitCraft would need to be humongous in size.  Therefore, I'd say it's - particularly financially - unrealistic. And having everyone that wants to play pay for it would still exclude especially many of the minors of the viewers. Not to talk about administrating the server..."
HermitCraft,380g97,RimaNari,1 point,Tue Jun 2 16:10:24 2015 UTC,From having my own small server the money and managing the server is a huge hassle and cost.

HermitCraft,37vrmx,kidmania01,5,Sat May 30 20:26:04 2015 UTC,"Computercraft question. In etho's script (6:47), he has all of the peripherals wrapped as the script starts, and the top block hasn't been placed yet. Does it still work to place the block after the script has started? And if not, does it work to not call peripheral.wrap until it's needed? For instance, something like this:  function getPeripherals()   local me = {}   for _, v in ipairs {""bottom"", ""left"", ""right"", ""back"", ""front"", ""top""} do     me[v] = peripheral.wrap(v)   end   return me end  function GetItem(ItemId, Side)   local x = 0   local me = getPeripherals()   if Side == 0 then     x = me.top.retrieve(ItemId, 1, 1)   And so on and so forth...  Would that fail on trying to wrap the peripheral a second time later on when he made a second pair of boots, without rebooting the script?"
HermitCraft,37vrmx,inmatarian,1 point,Sun May 31 04:40:29 2015 UTC,"Yep, that's Etho's problem. If the block isn't present when the wrap function is called the variable will be set to nil. Pretty easy to test with a computer.  lua> a = peripheral.wrap(""top"")  -- where nothing is on top lua> a nil   You could either delay the execution of the script, giving you time to  place the interface or even better, your solution of wrapping at usage time would also work perfectly. It wouldn't be necessary, but there really isn't a penalty to re-wrapping the peripheral in later runs."

He still does the occasional Realms video, but even the World Tour seems to have dried up.  Last I heard he was lacking inspiration on the World Tour, so I assume the same goes for Hermitcraft.  Hopefully he gets some inspiration, as I'm sure we'd all love to see him back in the saddle."

HermitCraft,37h4yi,DeuxMilleCent,7,Wed May 27 21:05:10 2015 UTC,"I thought Doc had so much potential with his base idea, and did not think that needed new updates to minecraft to accomplish.  It does need new ideas, and time and effort though, and his current series are much more straight forward/simpler in that regard.  I know he comments primarily on lack of updates, but I think the time minecraft takes, and (maybe) lack of ideas for new challenges in his base are also major factors.  It's a shame.  Hopefully it won't take a new update for him to come back and develop that more.  I also hope he tests out the other schedule option he mentioned (the way some of the other Europe based hermits do) so that he can have more interactions on the server.  That seemed to be his main incentive for coming over to hermitcraft in the first place - an active community; he didn't seem to comment much on burn out or lack of updates at that time."
HermitCraft,37h4yi,K_nikk,3,Wed May 27 22:42:07 2015 UTC,"I think he's given up on Minecraft.  It sort of annoys me to be honest, after all the excitement he stirred up about the server and now he doesn't even play.  I've seen this show before with other LPers, and I'm not really interested to watch it again."
HermitCraft,37h4yi,BlueCyann,2,Fri May 29 13:31:33 2015 UTC,"In my opinion it's the fact that he's kinda late to the party. Etho and Doc joined on the point when a lot of stuff is Endgame already. And I don't mean that ""Season 3 is about to end"", EndGame and EndSeason are two completely different things for Hermits, with the death of the dragon the fun just begins. But it's hard to join any SMP this late, and Hermitcraft 3 world has a very long history so it's hard to catch up. Which leads to lack of motivation"

HermitCraft,37dnns,NealWard,4,Wed May 27 09:05:33 2015 UTC,"Posting here as well as the vid's YT comments, just wanted to get it out there again as Etho's looking for a game:  Kill Chamber  I suggested it ages ago for Guudeland, Etho and would love to see you build it in Hermit Thrills: You should make 'Kill Chamber' - a 2-8 player multiple-death-mode russian roulette version of your good ol' ""Etho's Mob Processor"" with all the stops you can pull out and beef up in an updated E.M.P.  Start out from a high platform with dispensers and drop tubes, then randomly drop players down into their personal Kill Chamber E.M.P. device. Everyone is killed off by various methods - last player killed wins, everyone guaranteed dead!  But maybe someone'll get a buff or protection - feather falling boots or a slime block floor to save 'em from the initial death drop, potions or other armor dropped on them with various other buffs/enchantments to negate one method or outlast their opponents who die faster from the smorgasbord of dropping, drowning, lava pit & shower, anvils and poisons etc... until the next chamber activates yet another kill mode, of course...  It's not a game of skill, but it is one of fun - With fewer players, the tenseness rises as empty Kill Chambers are activated around you, with more players, more hilarity ensues as everyone is steadily picked off.  An alternative to make it more strategic could have buff items being offered at the start of the game as well as dispensed in the E.M.P. Kill Chamber's drop-tube and players being able to swap/trade items with others as well as betting on the outcomes... What do you reckon /u/EthosLab, folks?"

HermitCraft,36pmco,Iocomotion,1 point,Thu May 21 06:58:51 2015 UTC,I like that idea!  Maybe even a name-tagged skeleton hidden away at the top behind redstone-timer activated windows; just to make it interesting.

HermitCraft,36pmco,Saeka,1 point,Thu May 21 15:21:27 2015 UTC,"Nice!  I think anything that rewards either holding the position at the top, or rewards persistence to get to the top will have likelihood of hermits being in same location at same time as they loop each other or reach the same destination. Which of course leads to punching people off ladders or out of water falls - fun times."
HermitCraft,36pmco,Saeka,2,Thu May 21 23:02:18 2015 UTC,"Target Practice: One Hermit stands on the lower viewing platform with a bow and a stack of arrows.  Timer is set to one minute, and the hermits have to make it to the top and break the block. If the block is broken, the climbers win. If the block remains after a minute, the shooter wins!"
HermitCraft,36nimm,03APR91,2,Wed May 20 17:59:22 2015 UTC,A lot of the inconsistency with their health is because of that drop. Feather falling isn't consistent in how much damage it protects the wearer from. Getting rid of that big drop would both solve the problem and make it easier to pretty up in the future.
HermitCraft,36nimm,Mister_Martyr,2,Thu May 21 17:04:38 2015 UTC,"Yes, this! Not to mention that their boots have Protection II on them as well, just to skew the results even more.  I prefer crushers because no matter what armor the mob has, the damage they take is not affected.  The Protection enchantment they have on is a real bummer though, because as far as I can tell, it can reduce suffocation damage. (The only noted exceptions are damage from the Void, the /kill command, and hunger damage.) New MythBusting episode? :D"

HermitCraft,36dnp5,Kiwi_Gamer8060,1 point,Tue May 19 04:13:45 2015 UTC,"I've made my own quasi-vanilla texture pack as well, using the same methods you have - that is, borrowing from many sources with some basic personal editing. I recognize a lot of the textures in the pack. Many seem to be from Painterly, some are from CherryLax, Smooth Chocolate, or Tweaked Chocolate (for the benefit of those who may be curious).  I hope X finds someone good to help figure out a theme for the pack! My dream team would include XSSheep, creator of Pixel Perfection, but it's close to inconceivable. ;o  X, One thing I might point out as you're looking over the textures is that you'll want the coarse dirt to look pretty nice, because there's going to be so much of it everywhere!  Secondly, the soul sand texture looks pretty ghastly... pardon the pun... But I'm concerned. The large dark holes seem similar to a lot of images that are commonly supposed to trigger trypophobia. I'm a bit sensitive to this because several of my friends have this ""fear of holes,"" and they say it has kept them awake at night with a horrid feeling of itching beneath their skin and a wickedly awful paranoia... I might be making mountains out of mole-hills but yeah."

HermitCraft,36bs7g,Kawsiphek,3,Mon May 18 02:42:53 2015 UTC,The reason its not available is because its compiled from multiple sources without permission. The usual etiquette is to get permission for public release. If you were to do that for us then we could release it. Unfortunately i don't have the time for extra work at the moment :-)

Even if I am unable to get in touch with them, I will update this post with links to the sources so people can find and compile the textures they like most into their own personal packs.

In doc's viewpoint you basically see the last 3 minutes were Etho on defense and Xisuma on Offense against the other three.  I think Etho was right that the position Doc was in the other team would get the point once they get in, it was important to kill them off at that point before they even entered the room.  But still was a great way to listen and watch the scrolling updates to get a different feel of the battle.  Now to watch Python and Xisuma and I will have watched all viewpoints.  I hope they do something like this again, and hope Etho posts his viewpoint as well.  EDIT:  Got my wish!  Etho's POV great too.  Really hope they all do this again."

I also lost a lot of my school work but I'm happy that I can find a lot of that back in my email.   I actually haven't played minecraft since... I don't want to start over, I played on that world a LONG time and started a couple of times over in the same world, so I had a lot of memories in the world."
HermitCraft,35r1ao,RemcoBluB,10,Tue May 12 20:39:33 2015 UTC,I sort of know how you feel. Since I left my single player world a couple years ago I can't do another. It's just not the same with all the memories from my first ever world.  What helped me was doing something entirely different. Try a server for some SMP fun instead with others to help bring the change :-)
HermitCraft,35r1ao,Biffa2001,2,Tue May 12 21:15:44 2015 UTC,"The last time I played on a SMP server was 3 years ago. I never played on any server after that except a couple of hours on PlayMindcrack, but that is also really repetitive. But I think I will try out some servers :)"

After that I swapped to modded, well agrarian skies to be more accurate. Once I switched to modded I have no problems starting over as I learn to do things better and updates. Stuck with AS for 9 months restarting many times including playing on a server for a while. Started an ftb infinity world when the hermits started theirs and still loving it.  Long story short, after loosing a vanilla single player world many years ago, I didn't start a new one and not sure I will, but my minecraft experience didn't stop there."

HermitCraft,35sgt3,Kiwi_Gamer8060,3,Wed May 13 03:54:10 2015 UTC,It would be better if the teammate didn't return with full health but more like 2 hearts but 2 kills would be needed to bring someone back.  With my adjustment it could be interesting but I don't really know.
HermitCraft,35sgt3,78ford,2,Wed May 13 03:57:42 2015 UTC,"Yes, that sounds more realistic... Maybe keep inventory as well? I think it would need some testing before, just to find a good balance!"
HermitCraft,35sgt3,Kiwi_Gamer8060,2,Wed May 13 04:08:06 2015 UTC,Definitely needs a fair bit of testing.  If I was able enough with the commands I'd love to try this for my own UHCs because I believe its possible in vanilla in some form.

Teammates that die of ""natural causes"" (falling, lava, mob damage) come back as undead, basically emulating a zombie mob. Slowness + hunger, can wear armor but have only one inventory slot.   Teammates killed by other players do not return.  Alternate idea is that dead players get a 1 shot resurrection with gear on the ""undead"" team (empty at the start of the match), so it becomes a battle between the growing undead and the remaining ""living""."
HermitCraft,35sgt3,Kiwi_Gamer8060,2,Wed May 13 21:55:06 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much the undead person can do... Fight I guess, but with constant hunger and slowness..."
HermitCraft,35sgt3,arposey,1 point,Fri May 15 23:55:52 2015 UTC,"Yeah the other thing I was thinking was that they would respawn far from their teammates and possibly outside of a shrinking border if normal spawn mechanics are observed. They'd be sitting ducks.   I think now that the undead team (""alternate idea"") is a bit more viable, although there would still be a respawn/border issue to resolve."

HermitCraft,35nnfy,dmsneed,12,Tue May 12 00:00:11 2015 UTC,Simply because no one posts their stuff.  Doc and Etho being from a server that's always had a very active subreddit brought a number of redditors with them which does play into mostly videos by Doc and Etho being posted.

At the moment there are no plans to reset the world, there's no discussion about hermitcraft 4, I am personally not even thinking that far ahead, like, I don't know how long this world is going to last, but the way I see it, this world still feels like it's infancy, you know, I'm a long term player of vanilla, i feel like resets don't really do anything because you just have to start over again and get yourself back to where you were, I like the end game, I like it when you're all kitted out like this and you've got everything that you need and now you've got the world to do what you want with, and have loads of crazy cool building projects and farms and stuff like that, so for me, not even thinking about it and it's not even being discussed as a group, and I doubt it will be any time soon of course.

HermitCraft,35g6zy,BlueCyann,2,Mon May 11 17:48:52 2015 UTC,"This is quite an interesting idea. However, having collective health could pose a problem for when a player falls into a trap, lava, or takes more damage than he/she would normally have without the twist. If the player isn't able to escape, then both members of the team are eliminated when all/most of the damage is taken by one player. It isn't really fair for a player to instantly lose in a UHC because his/her teammate fell in lava. In PvP, a team could target the other team's weaker teammate, causing the other team to lose more damage than it normally would have. Imagine you're playing in a UHC and are about to fight another team. Player 1 takes about 8 hits to kill with his armor, but player 2 only takes about 4 hits to kill. In a normal UHC, killing the entire team would require 12 hits, but with collective health, you could only hit player 2 and kill the team in 8 hits. Essentially, collective health makes it unfair for careful/ better geared players if his/her teammate takes more than 10 hearts of damage."
HermitCraft,35g6zy,spschmidt27615,5,Sun May 10 02:00:15 2015 UTC,"Hmm, you bring about a fair point about the lava thing. Would it suck? yeah, but there have been some pretty 'unfair' UHC deaths in the PVE sense. IMO, just another hazard of the game- hoping your teammate doesn't trip into lava :-)  The second part is kind of the point, though- it will put more of an emphasis on making sure everyone is equally prepared to fight, or the stronger teammate would have to more actively defend the weaker instead of just letting him/her die."

That person was supposed to join the first team he found (or who found him).    So maybe something like that on a wider scale -- everyone starts solo and joins the first team they encounter?  Perhaps up to a certain maximum team size and smaller teams can merge as long as they don't exceed the maximum?  (So e.g. maximum team size is 4, if a solo person meets a group of three or less, they join, or if a team of two meets another team of two, they merge.)  Dunno.  I don't think they needed command blocks, I think the extra player just joined the team by typing a command in chat.  Er, unless teams normally require command blocks -- I don't really know how those work."

HermitCraft,35bn3d,78ford,7,Fri May 8 22:39:09 2015 UTC,Looking at you Sethbling..... xD
HermitCraft,35bn3d,SharpieThunderflare,4,Fri May 8 22:47:59 2015 UTC,I'm not a Sethbling or really a Gerry Brano but I've built a UHC box myself and it simplifies life.

HermitCraft,35bn3d,Kiwi_Gamer8060,6,Sat May 9 06:27:59 2015 UTC,"That's very cool, and the command blocks required to set that up are very simple."
HermitCraft,35bn3d,Ovram9,2,Fri May 8 21:25:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you can use the same detection mechanisms that they use for player heads, just for damage, not kills and then set the teams to be the same colour."
HermitCraft,35bn3d,Ovram9,3,Sat May 9 03:38:04 2015 UTC,"This sounds kind of like a silly idea, but I found it kind of funny... All battles have to be on horses or pigs."

HermitCraft,35bn3d,alaqazam,2,Sat May 9 06:27:38 2015 UTC,That'd be pretty cool too. Though it would be difficult mining. Perhaps only above ground purposes they must be mounted? Ahah.

HermitCraft,357du4,78ford,21,Fri May 8 13:59:15 2015 UTC,4pm GMT corresponds to the start time of the livestream event.

HermitCraft,357du4,Kiwi_Gamer8060,6,Fri May 8 00:39:00 2015 UTC,O_________O

HermitCraft,357du4,johnnypebs,9,Fri May 8 14:22:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe it has to do with livestream?  Golf thing,and used the wrong fore."
HermitCraft,357du4,dino_yoshi13,6,Thu May 7 19:50:20 2015 UTC,There are 4's all over the Hermit Hills too.
HermitCraft,357du4,dark_thaumaturge,5,Thu May 7 23:06:52 2015 UTC,they can't be planning to do season 4 already?!?!
HermitCraft,357du4,Flying_Cunnilingus,10,Thu May 7 20:21:48 2015 UTC,Can't be. Xisuma said in a recent episode that there are no plans to reset the server.
HermitCraft,357du4,Skizzle_,9,Thu May 7 22:19:17 2015 UTC,Plus Tango and Impulse probably wouldn't have literally just started a base if the season was ending.
HermitCraft,357du4,Kiwi_Gamer8060,2,Fri May 8 00:04:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that's exactly why I was thinking it can't be season 4, but it was the first thing that came to mind."

HermitCraft,357du4,78ford,5,Thu May 7 20:24:23 2015 UTC,Its something to do with Biffa. Saw he had a '4' in the middle of his base...
HermitCraft,356zvt,GoldenAppleGuy,20,Thu May 7 17:02:51 2015 UTC,"Bonus points to Xisuma for being the first to realize that the visible stairs with the torch was a wee bit suspicious... (Of course, he had the advantage of knowing Cube had already killed three people.)"
HermitCraft,356zvt,Wingsrising,13,Thu May 7 17:45:43 2015 UTC,Cubehamster now has the record for most kills in a season with 5 kills! I don't think that anybody expected that.
HermitCraft,356zvt,rock_buster,13,Thu May 7 17:35:22 2015 UTC,Also the only time I've seen a redstone trap in UHC actually work. That was so friggin' epic and funny.

HermitCraft,356zvt,Ginfandango,2,Thu May 7 21:55:58 2015 UTC,I thought jevin never got the diamonds?
HermitCraft,356zvt,EzshenUltimate,3,Fri May 8 01:02:21 2015 UTC,Jevin got the diamonds because he killed Python who had them.  He used some of them for his diamond pants.
HermitCraft,356zvt,78ford,2,Fri May 8 01:30:46 2015 UTC,"Yeah but I watched in False's perspective Jevin never got any of Python's loot, I may be wrong"
HermitCraft,356zvt,EzshenUltimate,3,Fri May 8 02:27:01 2015 UTC,He didn't spend time looking through any of it.  The diamonds stacked with diamonds Jevin already had.
HermitCraft,356zvt,78ford,2,Fri May 8 02:29:21 2015 UTC,"Oh ok, When jevin left the diamonds were still on the floor. I was reeally tired when I watched episode 6"

HermitCraft,356zvt,ThinWhiteMale,3,Thu May 7 21:56:38 2015 UTC,I think Sl1p is the MVP this season

HermitCraft,356zvt,Phydeaux,3,Thu May 7 17:35:22 2015 UTC,I agree. I really liked this season. Probably my favorite so far. Can't wait for the next one!

HermitCraft,356zvt,dark_thaumaturge,15,Thu May 7 17:23:18 2015 UTC,"Watch my perspective with annotations activated, I had mouse spazzing/technical issues the whole UHC through, I couldn't get in time to Xisuma, and then a creeper showed up right besides them. 32.5 hearts damage. If I would have killed the Creeper, Cube would have killed me. If I would have tried to kill Cube, the Creeper would have killed me before. Cube had way more better gear than me, I knew that - but of course I tried to get to X as fast as I could, but if you'd have seen my annotations starting with Episode #3 you'd knew about my mouse problems.. I really tried, I swear, I wanted to save him ;_; And I ran into Ghost Lava https://twitter.com/LapisDemon/status/596372886321004545 in the end, or I would have won btw.. But I really do like Cube, we all get along very well, and it just emphasizes my ""Brain over Muscles"" concept that I prefer over the usual aggressive/brutal UHC ""strategies"" };] This was a ""Bring a Friend"" UHC, I never expected to come so far in the first place, and despite the outcome, Xisuma and me had a lot of fun.. And for me this is the biggest win."
HermitCraft,356zvt,Iocomotion,5,Thu May 7 19:04:39 2015 UTC,"You did just fine! UHC is as much about staying alive as it is about being aggressive, and you did that better than almost everyone else (including a lot of seasoned UHC players). You and Cube both proved ""Brains over Muscles"" is a good strategy."

HermitCraft,356zvt,Ginfandango,10,Thu May 7 19:04:45 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was really the only frustrating/unenjoyable part of this entire UHC series. Meri almost certainly could have avenged X and won the whole thing, but she kinda wussed out.   I get that PvP isn't her thing, so I don't mean to critisize to harshly - she played like a pro up to that moment, but she could literally have just spammed her sword and had like a 90% chance of winning - the only uncertainty was Cube's knockback effect, but still...   Xisuma flat-out told her ""be aggressive"" and had she followed his advice she most likely would have won. That said, nerves get to you and I doubt I'd have fared any better myself, so it's all forgivable, in what amounts to one of the most entertaining seasons of UHC I've ever seen."
HermitCraft,356zvt,Iocomotion,8,Thu May 7 17:40:08 2015 UTC,"It's interesting, though, because if Meri hadn't died from fall damage or if she hadn't lit herself on fire with the lava, she might've been able to run away and mercilessly have Cube die in front of her, because their deaths were seconds apart."

You may look at it as, Cube killed her and ended the game so everything after doesn't matter. Whatever you believe is what counts for you, whether or not the majority agrees or not.

HermitCraft,356zvt,Qwant_,1 point,Fri May 8 07:09:33 2015 UTC,Yea my stats reflect what happened and that's it not what could've happened.  The point for the stats is to see what happened and compare the achievements of different players.
HermitCraft,356zvt,xSebtho,2,Fri May 8 15:18:27 2015 UTC,I've answered him and the way I see is the kills count and Falsehamster win due to Cube living longer than Meri.  And this is what will be reflected in the stats when I do them to be consistent with Guardax's Mindcrack UHC stats.
HermitCraft,356zvt,ShadowNinja002,2,Fri May 8 06:35:05 2015 UTC,"That xisuma fact isn't true, actually- Keralis killed him in Season 5 and lost."

HermitCraft,352uay,LapisDemon,3,Wed May 6 18:56:52 2015 UTC,But what if the final is a double kill (i.e. both die in the fight)? Then everyone dies!!!
HermitCraft,352uay,Iocomotion,6,Thu May 7 02:10:21 2015 UTC,Then Meri wins.  I just made up that rule.
HermitCraft,352uay,xSebtho,4,Thu May 7 02:43:45 2015 UTC,"Nonsense Prediction:  Meri gets crazy buffed up with full diamond armor protection 4 plus OP weapons and all the OP stuff you can get. Then Meri gets a donkey to get extra inventory space and gets about 50 stacks of notch apples. She also makes Xisuma be her support and all Xisuma does is splash a bunch of healing and strength potions and other strong potions. Meri then goes and wrecks everyone and accidently kills Xisuma so Meri wins with an estimated PI of >1,000,000."
HermitCraft,352uay,xSebtho,3,Thu May 7 03:03:24 2015 UTC,Meri loves donkeys! }=D
HermitCraft,352uay,xSebtho,4,Thu May 7 04:47:57 2015 UTC,I was actually gonna predict that Meri becomes so OP that she even kills her teammate Xisuma lmao

HermitCraft,352uay,Iocomotion,3,Thu May 7 18:51:33 2015 UTC,I will since the actions started before the game ended.
HermitCraft,352uay,Qwant_,0,Thu May 7 18:54:36 2015 UTC,But he knew he would die and thought the game was over so didn't put himself out
HermitCraft,352uay,LapisDemon,0,Fri May 8 05:54:32 2015 UTC,"But if you are going to, then who wins?"
HermitCraft,352uay,Iocomotion,2,Fri May 8 05:56:48 2015 UTC,I was right! And Meri could technically count as winning! :D
HermitCraft,352uay,LapisDemon,4,Thu May 7 23:09:04 2015 UTC,It can happen.
HermitCraft,352uay,ReallyFat,10,Thu May 7 02:14:55 2015 UTC,"Everyone falls into Cubehamster's hole, including Cubehamster himself ;)  Wild prediction: Meri becomes OP and kills everyone"
HermitCraft,352uay,LapisDemon,4,Wed May 6 17:24:36 2015 UTC,Pommes_Peter fell from a high place!  Docm77 fell from a high place!  Meri fell from a high place!  Cubehamster fell from a high place!  Xisuma fell from a high place!  The ghost of False wins!

HermitCraft,352uay,TimGB,5,Thu May 7 04:53:14 2015 UTC,"I would imagine either Doc or Pommes falls into Cube's hole, then the other kills Cube and gets the loot from both and becomes super OP since Cube and Team OP has the culmination of every other team's work between them, then they wreck face."
HermitCraft,352uay,BroskiBen,4,Wed May 6 18:38:22 2015 UTC,"Meri and Xisuma will encounter Cube. Cube pushes Xisuma down the hole, and swiftly falls in himself after Meri attacks him.  Afterwards, Meri sees Team OP, and accepts her fate, before taking out Doc and being killed by Pommes."
HermitCraft,352uay,ShadowNinja002,4,Wed May 6 17:38:00 2015 UTC,Pommes was shot by Cube.  Cube was shot by Doc.  Xisuma was shot by Doc.  Doc was shot by Meri.
HermitCraft,352uay,BlueCyann,2,Wed May 6 18:09:56 2015 UTC,Lots of shooting here

HermitCraft,34yl8f,78ford,11,Tue May 5 17:12:07 2015 UTC,Spoiler  This UHC is the best
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,11,Tue May 5 17:21:01 2015 UTC,That has to be one of the best moments in UHC I've ever witnessed.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,rock_buster,6,Tue May 5 17:36:14 2015 UTC,It's a close tie between Meri escaping the world border extremely narrowly or this
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,4,Tue May 5 17:38:54 2015 UTC,"Who gets credit,Cube or Gravity"
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,4,Tue May 5 17:44:35 2015 UTC,"I'll praise Cube for this particular execution, he had four hearts and no one for a lookout, he could've died!  No one better to kill in that instance but Jevin."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,dark_thaumaturge,2,Tue May 5 17:51:15 2015 UTC,As the person who does the stats Cube will get the credit for killing iJevin.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,LapisDemon,7,Tue May 5 20:02:51 2015 UTC,I fully agree. That was just amazing.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Knopantz,5,Tue May 5 18:18:08 2015 UTC,Thank GOD False was recording spectator mode. It was magical.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,xSebtho,7,Tue May 5 23:35:27 2015 UTC,"Yes,but i would've love to hear Cube right then."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Knopantz,6,Tue May 5 23:45:31 2015 UTC,"Knowing Cube, he maliciously laughed his butt off }xD"
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,11,Wed May 6 04:44:50 2015 UTC,"I can't believe that trap paid off. So good. I gotta say I underestimated Cube. Jevin was a good sport about it, too. Well played all around.  Sadly, nobody's really threatening Doc and Pommes at this point. I'm rooting for them, but I'd still like to see a good fight.  I've never really been interested in UHC until this season. I'm normally a strictly survival guy. I may want to go back and watch some older UHCs now."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Double--Positive,5,Tue May 5 19:26:45 2015 UTC,"I'd say Doc and Peter are in the worst position now, especially since Peter went into lava as they have low healing, whereas everyone else has a bit of healing and if not already, will have better gear :D"
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,4,Tue May 5 21:30:24 2015 UTC,"Meri and X aren't much better off health-wise, and I dare say Doc and Pommes work better as a team. Cube may have all the fancy gear and tasty apples, but in the end he's just one guy against two teams.  Of course he could just drill a few new traps real fast. Heh. Anything is possible."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,rock_buster,3,Tue May 5 22:35:16 2015 UTC,"I reckon they should kill off Pommes first because it will be faster since he's on low hearts, then run away from Doc M? lol. Better if they can snipe but since everyone's staying undergrounds it's a bit of a problem.  Meri Xmas have been very lucky with the mining at this stage of the game, they will find more diamond and gold tbh. They should get diamond armor and enchant sharp III/IV on their iron swords. Shame about that fire aspect that they could've gotten."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,K_nikk,3,Wed May 6 01:43:40 2015 UTC,They have enough gold to have 3 apples. Doc and Pommes also seem to work together really well (as seen in last episode's ambush).
HermitCraft,34yl8f,SharpieThunderflare,2,Wed May 6 02:57:32 2015 UTC,"If someone could ill off either Doc and Pommes, the other teams would have an easier time"
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Wingsrising,2,Wed May 6 03:36:14 2015 UTC,"Maybe so, but they're collectively the best at PVP."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Wingsrising,5,Tue May 5 22:28:59 2015 UTC,"I do recommend watching old seasons especially S2, S3, and S7."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,11,Tue May 5 19:30:35 2015 UTC,"I had no idea spectator mode would be so compelling! That was great!  Being able to see the danger up ahead and anticipate what their reaction is going to be is great suspense.  Meri running from the border, Jevin falling in the trap.  Wow."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,5,Wed May 6 00:29:56 2015 UTC,Spectator mode is always awesome. I just wish more people recorded it. :( :-P
HermitCraft,34yl8f,BlueCyann,4,Wed May 6 00:56:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah.  I imagine people who are dead don't want to take views away from people who are still alive, but I think it would be neat if there was routine spectator footage in future UHCs."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Aperture_client,2,Wed May 6 18:01:50 2015 UTC,Maybe even get someone who's not competing to start recording that way from the beginning... Sort of an overview video of everyone who's playing.  I don't know about other people but I find that I generally only watch a few views at the beginning of a UHC and then start watching more different views as people start dying (to check out the deaths and because there's now fewer and shorter videos to watch) so a sort of a single overview of what everyone is up to during those early episodes seems interesting.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Ginfandango,11,Thu May 7 00:36:56 2015 UTC,Pommes got of robbed 2 1/2 hearts there.  His video clearly shows him picking it up.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,dark_thaumaturge,6,Tue May 5 18:05:45 2015 UTC,"Team Falsehamster is now Team OP ;)  It's interesting to see how this will go. Cube is obviously stacked now (thanks Jevin!) and he's really sneaky, but he's alone unlike Meri Xmas or Team OP. Team OP are running low on apples, I think, because they've been using them extremely sparingly. Meri Xmas are slowly buffing up. Close fight...  Meri knows about Cube's genius, how about the others? We might end up in a fight between the non-PVPers Meri and Cube"
HermitCraft,34yl8f,dark_thaumaturge,2,Tue May 5 17:26:58 2015 UTC,Looking at the FIU Standings after episode 5 and it shows the second weakest player from last episode killed the strongest.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Qwant_,4,Tue May 5 20:00:50 2015 UTC,It shows the unpredictability of UHC imo. It's not always about PVP
HermitCraft,34yl8f,julianpratley,3,Wed May 6 02:29:20 2015 UTC,Luck and being able to think somewhat clearly is quite valuable in UHC regardless of skill levels.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,yabbut58,2,Wed May 6 02:32:39 2015 UTC,"This. Pure PvP skills are so important when it comes down to the fighting, but clear thinking is big even there."
HermitCraft,34yl8f,ShadowNinja002,5,Wed May 6 16:38:59 2015 UTC,I was watching jevin thinking there was no way he could lose but Goddamnit that was glorious. I completely forgot about cubes trap idea.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Iocomotion,7,Tue May 5 17:47:45 2015 UTC,I'm really enjoying Meri and Xisuma together. It's a great team and they really do seem to be having a lot of fun.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,kubaslov,6,Tue May 5 18:12:33 2015 UTC,I don't know who's WORLD BORDER PANIC MODE! was the best - Doc's or Xisuma's.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Qwant_,10,Tue May 5 18:28:45 2015 UTC,Meris
HermitCraft,34yl8f,GoldenAppleGuy,9,Tue May 5 18:31:02 2015 UTC,"Haven't watched her POV yet...  EDIT: Just watched it. Holy Jesus that was close!  Still, gotta say I loved Doc's sprint down that one-wide hallway with the border closing in - reminded me of the ol' Indiana Jones trope of rolling under the massive stone door just before it slams shut... if only he had reached back for his hat!"
HermitCraft,34yl8f,EzshenUltimate,8,Tue May 5 18:38:02 2015 UTC,"""There's a torch right Here""  That was unexpected.Ha Ha  If Cube wins,this will be the best UHC ever.Edit-This is the best UHC ever."

HermitCraft,34yl8f,Wingsrising,3,Tue May 5 18:45:04 2015 UTC,Doc sounded really grouchy this episode.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,Wingsrising,4,Wed May 6 00:07:26 2015 UTC,He's probably just tired and really focused on the game
HermitCraft,34yl8f,ShadowNinja002,3,Wed May 6 00:33:34 2015 UTC,To be fair it was quite late for him.
HermitCraft,34yl8f,iJevin,3,Wed May 6 00:38:12 2015 UTC,"He's probably frustrated at the game, and their trip to the nether."

HermitCraft,34z91v,kubaslov,3,Tue May 5 22:28:14 2015 UTC,There are some good things with gold but the best part is that its supporting reddit.  Comment highlighting is nice especially since the admins gave that gold feature to all the moderators all the time.

He may die, he may win; we'll find out in less than an hour! :D  Anyway, I predict that Cube will die (either the border will get him if he stays in the trap, or someone will find him) Doc and Pyro are really strong together, but if Python or Jevin manage to sneak at them they'll take out at least one of them (I don't think the solo attacker will survive, though), and that will be a huge hit for the other one, since teamwork is their biggest advantage X and Meri seem to be really relaxed, maybe too relaxed, but I think they're going to get at least one kill."

On the other hand, with him doing 99% Minecraft, I guess that his subscribers know that every Etho video will be a game that they know and enjoy.  I'm certainly guilty of not watching new series (on other channels) just because I assume that I won't like the game (even when I know nothing about it).

So if you had recommendations - what would you suggest?

This sadly is the hardest nut to crack if you've been a Minecraft channel for years. People generally won't give different things a chance.   A lot of times, it's not just that.

If they're smart about it they'll probably run before they get spotted, which would give them the advantage if they can find one with nether wart.    Doc and Pommes could either give up and head back to the overworld, in which case they've just lost some health, or they can go looking for another fortress (I'm betting on this one), in which case the roles would be reversed and even without element of surprise a fight right now is an easy win for Doc and Pommes."

Team OP clearly has the advantage, but never underestimate Xisuma's cunning. Meri is pretty smart too, and I think Meri Xmas might shoot Team OP off a ledge or something with their limited arrows.  Team Dead will craft their anvil and golden apples in this episode + find more diamonds. They upgrade to Power II bows and maybe Sharpness II swords. They'll take a bit of damage from their reckless exploration of caves. (Shoutout to Team Dead for having the absolutely funniest episodes of this UHC. I don't even feel nervous because of all the jokes they're making)  Team Falsehamster will finally find diamonds in exchange for their leaving all the iron ever in that cave system."

HermitCraft,34bckx,Ekketlol,1 point,Thu Apr 30 11:43:31 2015 UTC,"Pretty sure it wouldn't work in the nether as both the enderpearls need to not burn in lava (not sure if thrown enderpearls do that or not), and you would die when you teleported anyways to the lava, unless you has a fire resistance potion to drink every time before you teleported."
