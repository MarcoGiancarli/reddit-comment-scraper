DenverBroncos,3e4nyr,dlevine09,6,Tue Jul 21 22:46:47 2015 UTC,And THANKS to the Broncos fans lookin out (you know who you are).
DenverBroncos,3e4nyr,PMeist,4,Tue Jul 21 22:47:27 2015 UTC,My offer from the last thread still applies!  INNNNN-COOOOMMMMMM-PPPPLLLLEEEEETTTEEEEE
DenverBroncos,3e4nyr,TheAssOfSpock,6,Tue Jul 21 23:03:11 2015 UTC,I suddenly want to be good friends with you
DenverBroncos,3e4nyr,andrrrew,5,Wed Jul 22 00:02:00 2015 UTC,I'm gonna be on the waiting list until I'm 95. I'm 22 right now.

DenverBroncos,3e4nyr,ricobanderas,3,Wed Jul 22 00:30:11 2015 UTC,LOL jokes on you the NFL is better to watch at home!  ....Right guys? :'(

DenverBroncos,3e4mvo,dlevine09,5,Tue Jul 21 22:38:25 2015 UTC,"God my boner for Brandon Marshall grew so big last season.  Started flaccid, cause I had no clue who he was. By the end of the season I was full mast. Still am full mast....  Maybe I should go to the doctor."
DenverBroncos,3e4mvo,skullyD,3,Tue Jul 21 22:41:53 2015 UTC,I am so stoked for this year. I really feel like we are gonna kill it.
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,mrmahogany777,13,Tue Jul 21 23:54:04 2015 UTC,I know I'm in the minority but I think he finishes out his contract. Ie 2 more years. When he signed I honestly was just hoping his neck was alright and could see any combination of ways things would play out.
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,amiriite,3,Wed Jul 22 01:05:59 2015 UTC,"i thought all 5, too. i think he'll play out the remaining two seasons of his contract; and i think he'll play them out in a tremendous fashion."
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,dustya,3,Wed Jul 22 01:35:09 2015 UTC,I think 2 minimum UNLESS he does horrible this year and Elway begins to phase him out for Brock.  Peyton also seems like the person who would recognize when he might be done (let's hope).
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,dragonbear,4,Wed Jul 22 02:26:01 2015 UTC,I expected 3. I thought he would have a mediocre first year trying to get back in the swing of things and learning a new offense leading us to an 8-8 or 9-7 season then having 2 pretty decent seasons leading us to at least 1 Super bowl. Been pleasantly surprised with how he has turned out for us(Obviously)
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,TheAssOfSpock,3,Wed Jul 22 00:13:03 2015 UTC,"I also expected 3, but I was cautiously optimistic of better results. Just like you, pleasantly surprised but...no ring."
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,p-wing,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"Dude, it's kind of ridiculous to be sad that we had no ring.    We got to a superbowl and beat out our division every year.  That's more than what most teams get in a decade."
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,Cynical_Doggie,2,Wed Jul 22 04:14:27 2015 UTC,I wanted a ring for Champ though

DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,iil1ill,2,Wed Jul 22 05:49:05 2015 UTC,I expected the ass well at first just because age wise that seemed like a fair number. Since I've looked at it at more at the end of each season now I take him at his word that is an evaluation year after year and he might play out the contract. History shows that top QBS really do play until they aren't top QBS anymore. The tipping point for me was when I went back and re watched the Elway interview at the pro bowl after SBXXXIII. Everyone remembers him riding into the sunset as back to back super bowl winner and SB MVP. And that his health was failing him so he needed games off that season. But even with all that he still hasn't made up his mind. These guys are addicted to winning. It's hard to give up. If I had to make a call paycheck on the line I'd say manning has two more seasons finishing the contract.
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,thekingearl,1 point,Wed Jul 22 00:48:28 2015 UTC,"Honestly...? 2 years.  I just didn't see or think just how an old QB with 4 neck surgeries, missing an entire season, with a noodle arm could ever come back or even perform to his best ability.  By God, Peyton just mushroom tattooed my face proving me wrong."
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,skullyD,1 point,Wed Jul 22 02:46:28 2015 UTC,I expected 3 or 4 seasons.
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,jmt970,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:57 2015 UTC,I think no matter what this is his last season. He says he wants to finish out his contract but that's easy to say now.
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,Fridden,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:59:50 2015 UTC,"2-3 years max. If he plays well this upcoming season, win or lose Superbowl then I think he'll play again. If he plays even worse than last season then he will be done and call it quits which is what most people expect."
DenverBroncos,3e4wfi,TheMillThrill58,1 point,Wed Jul 22 04:02:31 2015 UTC,"When Peyton first signed we were still worried that any single hit he took would be his last in the NFL. We were unsure if he could even throw the ball or be anywhere near as good of a player as he was. I was less scared just because the doctors at the time were saying it was 100% healed and back to normal, so I based my opinions off of that.  But that first season the Broncos Oline didn't want anyone coming close to Peyton or hitting him ever. And for a while it was scary to watch, but eventually we got over those fears and relished in our newly found QB.  Realistically I expected 3-4 seasons out of Peyton, but I had no idea they would be this good of seasons. He's done more in 3 seasons here than most QB's can ever accomplish."
DenverBroncos,3e4wu6,TheAssOfSpock,10,Tue Jul 21 23:57:19 2015 UTC,He will be a solid nickel corner who will be a good matchup against most teams. He played really well in this role last year as a rookie and I expect him to do even better this year.
DenverBroncos,3e4wu6,ayosh7,9,Wed Jul 22 00:19:52 2015 UTC,"He had a very solid rookie year, even if he shows only moderate improvement he will be a solid starter. If he has a lot of improvement oh boyy"
DenverBroncos,3e4wu6,solsethop,4,Wed Jul 22 00:32:25 2015 UTC,I think with the new 3 - 4 and Phillips aggressiveness he won't have to cover receivers as long.
DenverBroncos,3e4wu6,lsjunior,3,Wed Jul 22 01:10:01 2015 UTC,"I'm not going to lie, I do think his rookie season was pretty overrated. It might have been because his expectations were kind of low coming in. I remember people not even expecting him to start and red-shirt behind Kayvon Webster. He played decent under his role but I don't think he was great like some people tend to suggest.   Anyways, I think he'll definitely be better. Instincts and diagnosing plays is his biggest weakness. We all know the physical tools are there."
DenverBroncos,3e4wu6,TheMillThrill58,2,Wed Jul 22 04:00:32 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with this. His rookie year was overrated, but for a rookie to come into the NFL and play CB averagely is a feat. He played average. He played very well at times, he played well at times, he played average at times, he played below average at times, he played poorly at times.   If he can step up this year and tidy up his game he could become a very good CB. Especially considering he has Talib and CHJ to learn from, the sky is the limit for Roby."
DenverBroncos,3e372u,modrewgnu,14,Tue Jul 21 16:40:04 2015 UTC,"This was definitely not written by someone familiar with the Broncos. It reads like those who only watch the occasional Broncos game and are regurgitating uninspired vanilla commentary.    Offensive Strategy: Pass the ball.  This one seems obvious but there is no need to over think your offense.  You have one of the most efficient quarterbacks in the game, great receivers, reliable tight ends and a decent offensive line.  Mix in a run every now and then to keep the other team honest.   So apparently our offense isn't changing despite the entirely new coaching staff. Isn't it pretty much accepted that the Broncos will run more this year in order to take the pressure off of Manning?   Also, we have a decent offensive line? Do they know something we don't? Because I'd love a reason not to be worried about our o-line this year.   Impact Players: WR Cody Latimer   Interesting to see him included in this since he hasn't seen much field time.   Weaknesses: Defensive line.  The Broncos linebackers are second to none but their defensive line could use a lot of work.  There isn’t anyone that can take over a Madden game.  It shouldn’t matter too much though because the rest of the Broncos defense is extremely strong.   Not the offensive line? I don't know how they can even predict teams' strengths and weaknesses yet, especially with teams like us with so many question marks in certain areas like O-line and special teams.  Overall, I'm disappointed in this assessment. I understand it is just a video game and it is a prediction from before pre-season, but I figured it would be a little better than this."
DenverBroncos,3e372u,taotechill,14,Tue Jul 21 18:01:50 2015 UTC,I understand your concerns but this breakdown has to do with the Madden game not their actual NFL team.  Cody Latimer is really really good in Madden.  Size and speed kill.  Offensive line just isn't that important in Madden whereas in the NFL it is extremely important.
DenverBroncos,3e372u,taotechill,2,Tue Jul 21 18:42:00 2015 UTC,Ok. I haven't played Madden in years so I really have no idea how realistic it is these days.
DenverBroncos,3e372u,chajimak,3,Tue Jul 21 18:43:54 2015 UTC,"If Madden is a realistic football game, NFS is a driving sim.  It's pretty bad, unfortunately.  I picked up 15, but I'll probably wait a few years before getting another."

DenverBroncos,3e3nnk,OMEGA5_,0,Tue Jul 21 21:48:33 2015 UTC,I wouldn't buy from eBay.   Chances are you bought a jersey from aliexpress.   Save $50 and buy straight from the source.

DenverBroncos,3e3nnk,OMEGA5_,3,Wed Jul 22 00:59:23 2015 UTC,Yeah but how do you know your seller didn't buy a bunch of jerseys from Aliexpress and sell them over here?
DenverBroncos,3e3nnk,My-Names-Jeff,2,Wed Jul 22 01:47:47 2015 UTC,When I visited Denver for a game we stopped by walmart. It was Broncos gear heaven. It was low quality stuff but the shirts and gyms shorts and stuff was worth it for me.
DenverBroncos,3e3nnk,Childofdust90,2,Wed Jul 22 00:31:19 2015 UTC,"If you're around Denver - mile high flea market. Same chinese knock offs as AliExpress, usually around $30."

DenverBroncos,3e3nnk,oarcandgm,2,Wed Jul 22 01:49:28 2015 UTC,AliExpress is pretty good. I've only ever ordered from there once. I got a Peyton jersey for like $25 including shipping. It was very decent quality considering the price.
DenverBroncos,3e3nnk,taotechill,1 point,Tue Jul 21 19:28:19 2015 UTC,I second this.  Just be sure to read the item reviews before purchase.

It does take a while to get but the shipping is free and the quality is good enough to convince everyone its real.  Edit: I should mention that if you're looking for hats or T-shirts (non-jersey things) you should use this."

DenverBroncos,3e39qv,TheAssOfSpock,5,Tue Jul 21 16:58:22 2015 UTC,"Unless the undrafted WRs look spectacular, I think Bubba's around for one more year. Colquitt's definitely gone though, he's way too overpaid for a punter who's regressed so sharply and doesn't even handle kickoffs."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,yonelway,6,Tue Jul 21 17:18:43 2015 UTC,"I don't think they'll have to look spectacular, considering that we know what Caldwell is at this point and would rather keep younger and cheaper guys around. It's not like he has set the world alight or anything, if one of the new guys looks good as a PR/KR then I think he's as good as gone."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,meztastic,3,Tue Jul 21 17:56:16 2015 UTC,"I kind of hope you're right, but I think he'll probably still slide in based on experience"
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,yonelway,9,Tue Jul 21 18:01:55 2015 UTC,"Holy crap, Tony Carter is in his SEVENTH season? I don't know how he's hung around that long. He has always been, IMO, our weakest corner and a liability whenever he's on the field."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,shpadoinkle17,12,Tue Jul 21 19:27:34 2015 UTC,Hahahahahaha Quentin Jammer.
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,smashertheorc,2,Tue Jul 21 19:46:42 2015 UTC,You have the name fucking jammer. You bed to be good at defense
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,sherekhantwait,2,Tue Jul 21 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"God I had forgotten about Jammer. When Harris went down against SD.....good lord that was terrible. Keenan Allen just left him in the dust every, damn, play."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,shpadoinkle17,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:36:30 2015 UTC,All I remember is two drives where all but one or two passes were to Keenan covered by Jammer. Almost lost us a 30 point playoff blowout.
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,smashertheorc,2,Wed Jul 22 00:44:07 2015 UTC,"Seriously, it was as if he was a sleeper agent activated just too late to cause our downfall in that game."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,shpadoinkle17,5,Wed Jul 22 01:14:04 2015 UTC,"Tony Carter is actually a pretty good cover guy. He is absolute trash at tackling though. If I was offense, I would just throw screens at him all day.   He and Kayvon Webster are polar opposites. Webster can't cover for shit but can lay wood and Carter can cover really well but can't tackle a dummy."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,TheMillThrill58,0,Tue Jul 21 20:00:53 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say really well. He's average at best. Plus he's in his seventh year and Kayvon is in his third. Webster regressed last season but I think that was mostly because Roby really showed up big and he was injured for the last quarter of the season. Both of those combined to reduce his playing time. I'd rather see Kayvon prove himself than get the same Tony Carter I've known to expect very little of for years.
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,shpadoinkle17,3,Tue Jul 21 20:40:50 2015 UTC,"Depends, purely as a cover guy I think Carter is pretty good. From what I see, a lot of people don't even throw at his direction which goes to show you he doesn't allow too much separation. His issue is that his tackling is relatively laughable. I feel like his cover stats wouldn't be that bad but I'd like to see them.   Webster has never been good at covering since entering. I don't know if he regressed. He has never showed much other than forcing Dez to fumble once."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,TheMillThrill58,2,Tue Jul 21 20:45:53 2015 UTC,Most teams don't have 3 solid corners in their rosters. Carter would probably find a roster spot anywhere else with a heavier workload then he's given with the Broncos. Maybe some appreciation about the depth our team has on this key position is due.
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,ECayce,2,Wed Jul 22 02:01:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not denying our depth at CB, it's been fantastic for years. I'm just surprised Carter has been around for so long considering his pretty mediocre play for us. I'm saying this without much knowledge on his special teams contributions, though."
DenverBroncos,3e39qv,shpadoinkle17,2,Wed Jul 22 02:30:38 2015 UTC,"I don't think he is mediocre, but even if he were, mediocre is pretty great for your 5th corner in the roster. Plus, he's on a very cheap contract, even after the restructure (which happened because other teams wanted him). I believe Carter has a bad rep because his awful play during the Superbowl, but he was pretty good during the 2012 season (remember him on MNF against the Chargers?). As depth goes, I honestly can't think of another [veteran minimum] player that could fill his role."
DenverBroncos,3e43mc,inkedphnx,1 point,Tue Jul 21 20:20:32 2015 UTC,"Here's the thing....  Training camp will be held in their brand new complex. There isn't a single fan or media person walking the planet that has been to training camp in this new place they spent 2 years building.  If they never built it, I could give you loads of advice, but seeing nobody knows what to expect, I'm not sure anyone will be able to give you any advice.  If it's typical training camp like every year, then arrive WAY early. The lines are like Black Friday lines at walmart. When you think you're too early, just know you'll have 500 people ahead of you already.  Don't bring cameras with removable lenses because they'll make you put them away as they are ""professional"" cameras.  Outside of that, I really don't know what the new place has in store."

DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,baha24,4,Tue Jul 21 15:45:38 2015 UTC,"Fairly prescient, BUT we would have shrekt the 49ers in 2013. Their secondary was decent but not anywhere close to the Seahawks and their defensive line wasn't as strong. Peyton eats Cover 2 shells for breakfast, lunch and dinner.   And Denver would have gone farther were it not for injuries in 2014."
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,Occams_Lazor_,10,Tue Jul 21 16:35:18 2015 UTC,We were pretty healthy last year and it's a bad excuse every team gets hurt. 2013 is where injuries held us back.
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,Fridden,8,Tue Jul 21 17:19:52 2015 UTC,We were pretty healthy except for the most important player on the team being injured.
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,Occams_Lazor_,2,Tue Jul 21 17:32:50 2015 UTC,"And Trevathan. Also, B-Marsh was never fully recovered at the end of the season. Those two losses hurt more than I think we realized (although it was pretty clear when our run D was non-existent against Cincy).  Edit: grammar things"
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,sherekhantwait,2,Tue Jul 21 17:58:57 2015 UTC,So true. We weren't doing shit under that coaching staff
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,skullyD,2,Tue Jul 21 20:29:28 2015 UTC,"I'm gonna guess something about the coaching change, how nothing will change. We will come up short again and let down Peyton Manning for wasting his final years of play.  Yeah, I'm thinking they go all in and hit it where it hurts."
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,Denver80,3,Tue Jul 21 16:40:45 2015 UTC,"I can already tell what he's going to say. ""OLine issues and an aging QB will be the demise of the team. Even if the Broncos make it to the playoffs, they will come up short yet again."" How original!"
DenverBroncos,3e2zdb,BenRichards79,-3,Tue Jul 21 15:57:33 2015 UTC,Horseface asked Noodle Armed Papa Manning to take a $10m pay cut.  That alone should give you an idea of how much confidence Elway has in Papa Manning.  Can't wait to watch this dumpster fire erupt!    Chicken parm you taste so good
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,TheAssOfSpock,11,Tue Jul 21 17:05:58 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Schmitz (Punter) and Barth, with Schmitz handling kickoffs. Saves us some money by cutting Colquitt. With PAT's moving back I think Barth's steadiness will mean the end for McManus."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,meztastic,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:28:05 2015 UTC,It all just depends on if Schmitz can actually do the same job Colquitt does. If he's within the same ballpark of productivity then Colquitt is either greatly restructured or gone.
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,PMeist,2,Tue Jul 21 21:09:39 2015 UTC,"There's no real reason to carry 2 punters, it's either Colquitt/McManus or Schmitz. I don't think Colquitt's going to restructure, nor would the Broncos offer one."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,meztastic,5,Tue Jul 21 21:18:27 2015 UTC,"It would be interesting to see if Schmitz will also handle FGs from beyond the 50 Yard line, considering he has more power than Barth does."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,theatretech37,4,Tue Jul 21 18:41:36 2015 UTC,"Barth should be the kicker because the guy is basically automatic from within 50. He doesn't have great distance though.  No point in keeping McManus on the team, a kickoff specialist is a waste of roster space."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,TheMillThrill58,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:33:45 2015 UTC,"IIRC, during the OTA's some of the special teams coaches were mentioning that Barth was nailing kicks within 60 yards now."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,waspocracy,2,Tue Jul 21 22:44:10 2015 UTC,Was that without pressure? because lots of kickers have that distance with no snap or pressure.
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,solsethop,2,Wed Jul 22 00:23:29 2015 UTC,"Not sure about punter but I gotta go with Barth Vader at kicker, I thought he stepped in and did very well last year."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,d-lo_tha_boss,2,Tue Jul 21 17:12:25 2015 UTC,"Barth and Schmitz  Fox brought in McManus because Barth couldn't kick off for crap. It was never about field goals. To pay a punter what Colquitt makes when he can't kick off is insane, IMHO. Plus, we haven't had a kicker that looks like he can handle his own on tackling after kickoff since Todd Sauerbrun was rolling heads."
DenverBroncos,3e3awd,bcos4life,4,Tue Jul 21 17:58:09 2015 UTC,"That's... not how it went down (unless you're referring to the second time we signed McManus). McManus was signed first after we lost Prater. Then he was awful so we signed Barth and waived McManus, and re-signed him after he cleared waivers as a kickoff specialist. If your comment is referring to the second time we signed McManus then my b you're right-- he was only for kickoffs.   Regardless I dig Barth and also think McManus & Colquitt are on their way out the door."
DenverBroncos,3e5jt1,NegativeGhostwriter,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:05:22 2015 UTC,"Pete Baron made the comment that if the Broncos Defense is only average this year, it won't be worth paying Von Miller his market value.  In general, I agree with that, but with a caveat: If Von is the single factor that differentiates awful from mediocre, he would be worth the money.    Hopefully, the Broncos put up a top-5 defense, which will justify paying Von what he's worth."

DenverBroncos,3e5jt1,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:10:11 2015 UTC,"Von is who I call a ""blank check"" guy, meaning you pay him a blank check (so in this case 6 yr/101 mil). Von is worth every penny and is on a hall of fame path right now. Could go down as the best defensive player in Broncos history (I'm not exaggerating and I'm a huge Champ/Gradishar fan)."
DenverBroncos,3e5jt1,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:13:58 2015 UTC,"I think there are some circumstances where that money might be better spent elsewhere.    Paying top dollar for Von means the Broncos will have to go to the bargain bin for multiple positions.  In most circumstances, it would probably be worth it, but not all."
DenverBroncos,3e5jt1,TheMillThrill58,1 point,Wed Jul 22 03:34:00 2015 UTC,"Von, imo, is the second-best defensive player in the league. You gotta keep guys like that."

I think Von has the potential to be there, but we can't be certain that he'll fulfill that potential.  If he can spearhead the D leading the league in takeaways like Watt did last year, there's no question he's worth the investment."
DenverBroncos,3e14a2,TheAssOfSpock,2,Tue Jul 21 03:45:04 2015 UTC,"Excellent find.  Obviously the colossal achievement under Overlord Elway was signing Peyton. That can't be topped.   Willis McGahee was such a good RB for us and I miss him. He ran his guts out for us and definitely a good move by Elway, one that gets overlooked in comparison to his many other good moves.  Signing Emmanuel Sanders shouldn't be so high, like, great signing but shouldn't be that high.   Signing Danny T. and Malik on the same day should be higher. Both have been very good for our defense, even in limited roles. Both look to be monsters this year!  Overall good list and thanks for sharing!"

DenverBroncos,3dzrat,TheAssOfSpock,13,Mon Jul 20 21:13:26 2015 UTC,"Montee is one of the biggest question marks we have on the team. He played well but not great his rookie year behind Knowshon. Last year he was injured and played through injury. He suffered the most at the lack of run blocking last year.   But now CJ the MANderson has taken over the backfield and it looks difficult to take it away from him. Ball was a high round draft pick and it's tough for teams to admit they were wrong on high picks. He hasn't come close to busting yet, but he hasn't lived up to his draft potential.   I still think he is very close to being an elite RB, and now with Kubiak I could definitely see it. If things don't work out with CJ in free agency after this season then I could see Ball being a monster for us. But nothing is guaranteed and it's all speculation. But I am still cautiously optimistic, his first 2 years in the league he wasn't used hard like a lot of other RB's are their first couple years."
DenverBroncos,3dzrat,PMeist,3,Mon Jul 20 21:18:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! This was a good read. Do you think maybe Montee Ball is just a very good #2 RB? If that's the case, the one-two punch of Anderson and Ball in Kube's new offense will be epic. I hope that's the case."
DenverBroncos,3dzrat,PMeist,4,Mon Jul 20 21:24:40 2015 UTC,"Kubiak is famous for utilizing 1 RB for a majority of his offense. But if he has two legit starting RB's then I don't see why not. The thing about CJ is he runs harder than anyone I've seen, he blocks well, and already has good rapport with PFM.   Hopefully between the two of them we have an elite ground game, can pass out of the backfield, and can block for Peyton."
DenverBroncos,3dzrat,AB444,6,Mon Jul 20 21:28:12 2015 UTC,"I think he is going to surprise a lot of people. Last year he was definitely held back by that groin injury. It sucks because you could tell he really wanted to show what he could do and reinjured himself.   I honestly think he could give CJ a run for the starting job. I might be wrong, but the guy has ridiculous work ethic and seems like a good kid. I'm sure he has a ton of motivation now that he's almost an afterthought in our offense as well.  I'm excited for this season."
DenverBroncos,3dzrat,TheMillThrill58,3,Tue Jul 21 00:00:08 2015 UTC,"My expectations for him are not very high.   I really was not that impressed with his rookie season to be honest but he was decent. In his sophomore season, he was expected to come in and be an upgrade over Knowshon Moreno as a starter and he disappointed.   I see him fighting for the #2 RB spot with Bibbs, Hillman, and Thompson this training camp and preseason. In April/May, there was news saying he was splitting #1 reps with CJ but that has completely gone away now.  Whoever that 2nd guy is behind CJ is probably going to be pretty good since that is pretty fierce competition. If Ball wins that spot then I expect him to play well as he would have earned that spot since this is no longer the same coaching staff that drafted him that seems to gave him the benefit of the doubt most of the time."
DenverBroncos,3dzrat,Occams_Lazor_,3,Mon Jul 20 23:25:29 2015 UTC,he was expected to come in and be an upgrade over Knowshon Moreno as a starter and he disappointed.   He was injured and had a line so terrible that it got reshuffled several times.  And the splitting reps has gone away...because OTAs ended. There are no reps now. It was always 1a and 1b with them.
DenverBroncos,3dzrat,TheMillThrill58,2,Tue Jul 21 00:02:26 2015 UTC,"Whatever the reason is, this is basically the last chance I'm giving Ball. I mean you could very well be right that his issues were an exception but I am not so sure. Again, I didn't come away that impressed with his rookie season. He was a top 5 RB among that draft class at best (Lacy, Bell, Stacy, Bernard were all better). It is not like he looked like the next Terrell Davis or anything. I'm still a little upset they picked Ball over Lacy cause I can't see Ball ever being better than him.  Splitting reps has gone away because CJ showed he was much better. I was surprised they even had that approach. CJ ended up getting more reps in OTAs and practice anyways.   http://fantasynews.cbssports.com/fantasyfootball/update/25221741/cj-anderson-will-enter-camp-as-broncos-top-rb  Anderson, who rushed for 648 yards in the last six games of the 2014 regular season, came into offseason camp in much better shape than the prior season and took the most snaps with the offense in OTAs and minicamp."

I'm giving him credit from what I've seen him do for 3 straight years in Denver when he wasn't supposed to do anything at all. This 3 year run has been the best 3 year run in QB history. Look at what he's done. I think others need to step up to his level because he's not what he's used to be. Could you imagine if he had this squad (which is still slightly above avg) all his carrer?

DenverBroncos,3dt72b,PMeist,8,Sun Jul 19 06:01:54 2015 UTC,"It's really crazy to think that Clady, DT, and Bruton are the only guys left from the McDaniel's era. 50/53, 94% of the roster has changed in 5 years. They got rid of the losing virus faaasssttt."

DenverBroncos,3dt72b,cmspunk,4,Sun Jul 19 12:24:33 2015 UTC,That's actually incredibly common to have happen in the NFL. Just earlier this week or r/nfl someone posted the roster turnover of Chip Kelly since he took over and it was over 90% in just 2 years. Roster turnover in the NFL is crazy.

Entering his 8th NFL season and has never been more than a WR4. He's filled in nicely a few times but it's not something that anyone else can do. I'd rather take a shot on a younger guy that shows promise if they are equivalent in skill and ability to Bubba.   Bubba makes the roster only if he clearly shows he is a much better WR4 than anyone else. But if we cut him we take $200,000 in dead money but save $1.3 mill against the cap."
DenverBroncos,3dsl8x,PMeist,2,Sun Jul 19 01:47:59 2015 UTC,"As UF alum, I loved Bubba. 2 seasons ago (our SB run season), he was a serviceable backup and we appreciated the hell out of him, it's amazing how much of a 180 he did after last season FOR FUCKS SAKE BUBBA JUST KNEEL IT AND GET US TO THE 20 YOU DONT NEED TO RUN IT OUT TO THE 8. I hope he at least looks better this season, not like I want him to become WR1/2 or anything, but just for his own sake."

I think if he was cheap enough he would be a great influence on our young receiving corps."
DenverBroncos,3dsl8x,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:40:08 2015 UTC,"Reggie Wayne is an all-time great, probably a HoF'er once he's done. But if we were going to go with someone old we might as well keep Bubba because he knows the offense better by now and has rapport with Manning. I'd really rather give a shot to Burse, Fowler, Taylor, Palmer, etc than either old guy. Just to see if they can contribute as a WR4 and in other areas of the team, which Wayne and Bubba can't. just my 2 cents"
DenverBroncos,3dsl8x,PMeist,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:52:46 2015 UTC,"Wayne has more rapport than Bubba with Peyton, and we will probably have 5 receivers anyway for one of the young guys. I'm not disagreeing, I'm just saying between the two I take Reggie, and have one more young guy at 5."
DenverBroncos,3dsl8x,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Jul 19 18:57:11 2015 UTC,"It looks like the Broncos are not interested in Wayne even though I would like him here just to mentor the young WRs and reunite with Manning.   I would not worry too much about the 4th WR given that Kubiak prefers 2 TEs in most of his plays anyways. If anything, I may be concerned with the playing time both Sanders and Latimer will get."

DenverBroncos,3dsl8x,TheMillThrill58,1 point,Mon Jul 20 16:00:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I agree. It's reasonable for Latimer to not see a heavy workload in just his second year, but Sanders justified his extensive playing time."

DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,HappyGilOHMYGOD,8,Sat Jul 18 18:00:03 2015 UTC,Too early to tell...but Elway and the FO seem to be pretty high on him. I'm hopeful though. He's had a chance to just sit back and learn from the GOAT - most young QB's don't get that chance.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Tlwofford,3,Sat Jul 18 17:56:18 2015 UTC,Rodgers did and I think he turned out alright.  Not to mention Peyton is MUCH more cerebral than Favre giving Brock more to learn from.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,CalmingCollection,2,Sun Jul 19 16:49:03 2015 UTC,Agreed. No arguments there.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Tlwofford,2,Sun Jul 19 17:29:03 2015 UTC,If he picked up Peyton's preparation style and learned some of how to read defenses from him then it has to have helped him.  Can't see how he couldn't have picked up a lot just by being around.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,rogerwilcoesq,14,Wed Jul 22 00:18:26 2015 UTC,"Lots of potential, everyone says he reminds them of Flacco, however I think he's more like Roethlisberger (without the rape and stuff of course).

DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Neverethe,5,Sun Jul 19 05:03:06 2015 UTC,"I'm just hopeful. He has the arm, and the size, to be an excellent quarterback. We can hope that behind peyton and the offensive mind of Kubiak he develops good decision making.  He reminds me of Flacco, and with Kubiak at the helm, and what he did for Flacco, I think that Brock being about as good as Flacco at some point is the most I will hope for. And with a dominate zbs run game, and an aggressive D. I think that we will be a threat.  After years of sitting though people are going to not have much patience for average or below average. It is interesting to see how it will play out."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,solsethop,3,Sat Jul 18 17:47:48 2015 UTC,If he becomes as good as Flacco I'll be satisfied. Great QBs don't grow on trees and even a decent QB like Flacco is rare.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,The_Super_Deer,-1,Sun Jul 19 00:28:36 2015 UTC,"While I see a lot of similarities between Brock and Flacco, Oz undeniably has a more accurate deep ball. He drops it in the bucket time and time again, but Flacco relies a hell of a lot on DPI to get yards. Dude didn't earn the name Jump Ball Joe for nothing."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,mysterious_pube,3,Sun Jul 19 13:36:20 2015 UTC,Drops it in the bucket time and time again? He's barely thrown any passes in a live game.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Denver80,5,Sun Jul 19 22:44:31 2015 UTC,He's friends with Jack Elway. Jack Elway is the son of John Elway. John Elway is god. Brock is Jesus.

DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,flynryan692,3,Sat Jul 18 23:42:54 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen enough to really form an opinion.  My gut feeling is that he won't be the star a lot of people around here think he will.  But, if he is surrounded by the right people, he won't be a bust either.  I see him like an Orton.  Good QB, but not going to be a gamebreaker."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,leechsucka,2,Sat Jul 18 19:28:14 2015 UTC,"I think he'll be head and shoulders (no pun intended) above Orton.  He won't be as great as Peyton.  I'm just going off of the little bit I've seen and his potential, but I think he's a taller Jake Plummer with Jay Cutler's arm... not a bad thing if you ask me."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,CalmingCollection,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:45:25 2015 UTC,"I'd call him a mix of Orton, Cutler, and Plummer. I think he has almost the same arm strength of Cutler, I think he is almost as smart as Orton, and he is almost as mobile as Plummer.   Which in reality is a good thing. Cutler has huge unneeded arm strength, but he has no brain. Orton has the brain but no arm. And Plummer was, in reality, more mobile than 99% of quarterbacks need to be.   So he has the tools and potential to be a solid starter. I think if he come in with confidence and doesn't lock up he will be good."

DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,elcalrissian,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:51:47 2015 UTC,"Sadly the Shanahan shit streak with his QB's started with him benching Plummer for Cutler.  I think most of us agree with you 100%, Plummer is a great guy and was a good QB for us."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,CalmingCollection,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:47:01 2015 UTC,"I really didn't like him coming out of college and I haven't seen anything to make me change my mind on that (not that he has had the opportunity to). I really hope I'm wrong though and I hope he has improved greatly since then.   I will say this though, the whole ""he's learning under Manning!"" is usually bullshit. I think we as fans imagine way more teaching than actually happens. To expect someone to be good because he sat behind someone else good is just naive."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,njm1314,2,Sun Jul 19 01:38:16 2015 UTC,"It's hard to believe there isn't a fair amount of teaching going on. Even on the sideline you'll see Peyton and Brock going over game photos and discussing them. Peyton really has no other reason to say anything to Brock in that situation. There's also a lot to be said for learning by example. Brock sees how Peyton takes notes, he sees what Peyton looks for on tape, and he sees how Peyton carries himself as a leader. Peyton might not be Brock's personal tutor, but there's plenty of information for Oz to absorb."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,mysterious_pube,2,Sun Jul 19 13:45:16 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you've said. I can't remember where I read it (It was probably here), but I thought I heard Peyton wasn't exactly the most didactic person. He is obviously very football intelligent, but that he doesn't necessarily impart that onto Brock to the degree that people think. I may be remembering what I read incorrectly, though.  But people in general put way too much weight into the ""learning behind a HOF quarterback"" thing. The shining example is Favre/Rodgers, but if you look at every HOF QB and their successors you'll find that as the anomaly that probably had less to do with Favre's ""grooming"" and more so Rodgers' ability and QB coaching. I mean, how much secret knowledge could Favre realistically impart onto Rodgers that he couldn't a) Already learn from veteran coaching staff b) See for himself via copious film study. I'm sure Favre's presence helped, I just think people put way too much weight into it.   All of that being said, I freakin' hope Brock Lobster lights it up when he gets his shot."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,GuidoIsMyRealName,2,Mon Jul 20 20:10:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, Elway was a great QB, he's a great GM as well.    Manning is the best QB in the league, football IQ wise at least, and Osweiler has been under him for the past 3 years.    I have big hopes for the lobster."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Cynical_Doggie,1 point,Sat Jul 18 23:06:17 2015 UTC,He has so much potential but that is all he has. I agree with Chris Harris Jr. that the Lobster could become Joe Flacco Jr.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Sat Jul 18 22:15:34 2015 UTC,"I was living in Tempe when Brock was at ASU, and we both moved to Colorado (I moved back) at the same time. He looked really good when I went and saw him play in college. But given I went to two ASU games while in college and being heavily intoxicated and not really watching the games. But yeah, he looked good.   But my opinion of him now is that he's had a ton of time in the NFL without playing, so his 'rookie' year is going to be better than most rookies. It's entirely up to him whether or not he becomes the guy when he starts playing."

DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Gringo_Ninja,1 point,Sun Jul 19 01:07:30 2015 UTC,They've invested in him this far. It would be a waste to not give him a full season or two to prove himself. Unless it's blatantly obvious he can't do it.
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,Hurry_Hurry,1 point,Sun Jul 19 13:37:01 2015 UTC,"I am excited to see him when he has an offense built to his skills.   It reminds me when Shanny put Cutler in over Jake. While Jake was more mobile, he didn't have half the arm Cutler did, so the plays were based around an average arm.  Brock has an absolute cannon, and Peyton's arm is pretty damn weak.   Even if Brock gets a start or two this year, we won't know what he's capable of, until Kubiak and build an entire playbook built off of Brock."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,bcos4life,1 point,Sun Jul 19 15:33:53 2015 UTC,"I was excited about the fact that he has the brains of both John Elway and Peyton Manning to pick, ask questions, and learn from.  I was excited about him because he's mobile for how big he is, he has an absolute cannon, and I think he would be the next Aaron Rodgers.  Then Kubiak was hired and the future looks even more bright.  When he does take over that zone scheme will likely be churning out 1,500 yard backs year after year like back in the day and Brock won't have to carry the team on his own.  I think with the zone scheme and the playaction/rollouts that can happen off of it will fit him well.  I'm really optimistic about him."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,CalmingCollection,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:40:14 2015 UTC,"I feel like I can't form an opinion on him yet. We haven't seen enough to say one way or another, and he hasn't really had the chance to get consistent reps with the 1st team.   I'm hoping that will change this year in training camp/practices/some game time to rest Manning throughout the year so that we can get a better sense of what we have with him.  I want to be optimistic. I hope that learning under two Hall of Fame QBs has done a lot for him....but only time will tell."
DenverBroncos,3dr5tv,AlpineSummit,1 point,Sun Jul 19 16:55:49 2015 UTC,"He has shown that he basically has all the physical tools, arm strength, mobility, size, etc. It is just a matter whether he can translate it or grasp the mental portion of it.   From the clips I have seen from him in preseason and regular season (garbage time), he holds onto the ball too much and doesn't have great reaction time. This could be more of a sign of poor chemistry rather than poor mental make-up. It is hard to tell until we actually get to the point of him starting and getting the reps."

But if everyone outside of bronco country think he's not worth big money, then the FO is in for a great surprise, which means the Abrockalypse would be resigned for less than starter money. CHJ said Lobster was like a JFlacco and he played against and picked him off, the Ravens starting QB who made multiple playoffs, so we can believe that credentials from our very own #1 efficient cornerback in the league to verify the OZ's skills.

All the guys on D are buying into Wade's plans and everyone likes the philosophy Kubiak is installing.

If you think he'd enjoy being able to highfive the players and whatnot, 50 yard line 1st row is undeniably the best (section 105 row 1).  It's not the best view to actually watch the game though.  I'd vote against anything else in the 1xx sections except for the higher level rows.  In the lower rows, cameras tend to get in the way of the action.  Section 309 (also on the 50, but higher up) are the best seats I've had.  And the 3xx section is a much better way to watch the game (assuming price isn't an object... because those are like 2000 dollar seats)  The 5xx sections are going to be really cold for a night game, so I'd recommend against any of those.

DenverBroncos,3doout,lsjunior,1 point,Sat Jul 18 03:48:09 2015 UTC,"You really can never go wrong with 50 yard line seats on the side of the team that you are rooting for. So my opinion would be mid level, 50-yard line on the west side of the stadium."
DenverBroncos,3doout,andrrrew,1 point,Sat Jul 18 05:18:54 2015 UTC,"I would go with anything towards the middle of the field. Personally I'm not a fan of sitting in the endzones and I have done it before. Just my taste. So as close to the middle of the field and as close to the field as possible. I wouldn't really worry about reading mixed reviews online, it's all a matter of taste. But really just being in the stadium for a home game is an awesome event no matter where you sit.   Also, if you really want to surprise him with tickets maybe try to get a little into football general principles. Just learn a little bit so you know what's going on, then maybe get yourself a jersey or at least a Broncos t-shirt. You can find some cheap Broncos t-shirts anywhere.   Thanks for stopping by and feel free to ask any more questions you may have."

DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Roytee,16,Fri Jul 17 14:14:07 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not surprised, Orton threw him the ball about every play. Literally broke the record for forcing a receiver the ball for an entire game."
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,KingMontagu,10,Fri Jul 17 15:21:06 2015 UTC,So he and Cutler are no longer BFF's?
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Fridden,10,Fri Jul 17 14:30:27 2015 UTC,"Well he DOES think Jay has a better body, so he's got that going for him."
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,BlindManBaldwin,7,Fri Jul 17 14:40:10 2015 UTC,That dis on Cutler though
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Fri Jul 17 14:36:16 2015 UTC,Marsh is hatin' on him!
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,skullyD,4,Mon Jul 20 15:39:01 2015 UTC,Haha.
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Greeney494,8,Fri Jul 17 14:18:28 2015 UTC,"Kyle's situation was kind of similar to Jake Plummer's. I feel bad for Kyle. Fan base fucking hated him because 1. Josh McDaniels and 2. Tim Tebow. He wasn't a great QB, but I'll never forget his first 6 games as a Bronco. Plus he's just a nice guy."
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Gurtang,9,Fri Jul 17 17:18:06 2015 UTC,"I don't think many of us waited for Tebow to feel like Orton sucked.   Plummer was a lot better than Orton, comparing them is quite an insult to the Snake. And Plummer had achieved something in his career, which is why ditching him like that after one bad playoff loss was unfair. Nothing like Orton's situation.   But yeah, I'll admit that, because of McDaniels, Orton took more heat than he would have based on his play alone. Doesn't mean he was good though."
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Fridden,4,Sat Jul 18 03:37:10 2015 UTC,I don't get it. You have some fans that love Tebow but no fans that love Orton. Orton was miles and miles away of being a better qb than Tebow.
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Greeney494,3,Fri Jul 17 19:59:36 2015 UTC,"I don't know if anyone loved Orton mainly because he's not a flashy guy. Tebow was terrible but his bull shit in the last five minutes is what everyone remembers. Orton is Ryan Fitzpatrick, Alex Smith, etc. A good QB but not saavy enough for people to fall in love with."
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Colorado222,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:29:21 2015 UTC,I wasn't a huge huge fan of Cutlers decision making and feel that Orton had better control.
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,TweetPoster,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:00 2015 UTC,@BMarshall:   2015-07-17 04:40:08 UTC  Probably... Kyle Orton just bad body  twitter.com     [Mistake?] [Suggestion] [FAQ] [Code] [Issues]
DenverBroncos,3dmk8h,Sirefly,3,Fri Jul 17 14:14:44 2015 UTC,I think the question was taken out of context.  Kyle Orton is the best QB he has ever played QUARTERS with.
DenverBroncos,3dnsk5,alacton,2,Fri Jul 17 19:51:17 2015 UTC,"Losing to the Bears? I get that there's a perfect chance for an upset of ages, what with Fox rebuilding there and whatnot, but I REALLY don't see us losing to that team. Their defense is swiss cheese currently, and their lack of a consistent QB (Sorry Cutty) leaves much to be desired on offense. I just don't see it."
DenverBroncos,3dnsk5,Raisinbrahms28,2,Sat Jul 18 06:51:58 2015 UTC,"I can't argue with that, but I didn't see us losing to the Rams last year either. We will lose a game on the road this season where we are not ""supposed"" to lose. That's the NFL."
DenverBroncos,3dnsk5,Raisinbrahms28,2,Sat Jul 18 17:58:10 2015 UTC,The Rams out played us on defense. Their offense was terrible. I don't think Chicago will have one side of the ball that will be as good as the rams defense was.
DenverBroncos,3dnsk5,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Sat Jul 18 18:35:23 2015 UTC,You gotta give those losing teams some upset wins or else they'll be mad :P
DenverBroncos,3dnsk5,PMeist,2,Mon Jul 20 15:41:05 2015 UTC,"The problem with linking articles like this is I could be running profootballspot.com and submitting whatever I feel like.  Plus, all these predictions are silly. In the offseason review series it's my least liked part next to the draft grades. Literally anything can happen and we're only basing it off what we know now, which is nothing."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,PAP3RBAG,6,Fri Jul 17 18:57:30 2015 UTC,Tbh he'll probably double it at least
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,Bradyta,2,Fri Jul 17 23:44:11 2015 UTC,"yep, at the very least"
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,dustya,2,Sat Jul 18 01:36:02 2015 UTC,"Eh, you might not be giving him enough credit."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,RedRiderJman,3,Mon Jul 20 06:03:03 2015 UTC,Ofc he can. Just needs to be more consistent. He got 152 yards in 4 games last year and still managed 1600 over the full season which means he averaged like 130 ypg over the other 12. Over 16 games that's 1960 total.
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,march20rulez,2,Fri Jul 17 19:23:10 2015 UTC,"I think him and Manning are capable of it, but I don't think it'll happen. Don't get me wrong though, I wouldn't be disappointed one bit if they did break it."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,crueg,2,Fri Jul 17 19:09:08 2015 UTC,"Probably. There was a good statistical analysis that Scout.com did a while ago. I don't feel like looking for at it at the moment, but basically, even though we're going to be a run-based offense, the percentage of runs verses passes are still about the same as the John Fox offense using data from Kubiak's past offenses.   I think we will run more plays per game, so expect more chances for passes as well."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,waspocracy,2,Fri Jul 17 19:21:55 2015 UTC,Nope. The only person currently playing I can see breaking it is CJ.
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,Fridden,-2,Sat Jul 18 00:34:44 2015 UTC,CJ is done
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,MTLBroncos,1 point,Sat Jul 18 16:21:05 2015 UTC,"He had 1 ""down season"" in which he still hit 1k yards. He is still far and away the best WR in the game and is still under 30. He is nowhere near done."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,Fridden,1 point,Sat Jul 18 17:24:32 2015 UTC,"I mean, Andre Johnson had a few successful years under Kubiak and Matt fucking Shaub, I think DT will be able to succeed."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,Greeney494,1 point,Fri Jul 17 20:37:56 2015 UTC,Go big or go home. I think it is possible.
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 22:43:00 2015 UTC,"If DT was the only viable target Manning had I'd say it was possible, but there's Sanders and Mean Virgil Green!"
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,Puffy_Ghost,1 point,Mon Jul 20 01:36:55 2015 UTC,"I think he can, but he can't have a single bad game.  Last year, I don't think he went over 50 yds for the first three games and he still had 1600.  He needs to avg. 125 yds/game to hit 2000.  If he has one monster game with, say, 230 yds, that means he needs to average 118 yds.  Another 200 yd game and is avg. is down to 112 yds/game.  That number is entirely doable.  No bad games, 2 monster games of 200 yds, and I think he'll get it."
DenverBroncos,3dnlak,tjn23,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:48:44 2015 UTC,"The ZBS will be very interesting in the screen play game, which I think is what sets DT apart from other WRs. If we can get some second level blocking that you see more in the ZBS, then DT is going to have a lot more room and time to find a lane and use his speed and strength to his advantage.   However, to break any record, you need the QB to be dialed in to you all the time and unfortunately I don't think he will break it. Kubiak is going to run the ball a lot and spread is around with the bootleg. I hope he can though!"
DenverBroncos,3dkkah,mrmahogany777,13,Fri Jul 17 00:45:30 2015 UTC,"Super classy speech, I love that man."

Whenever he shows up to a charity gala or ribbon cutting, he's finely dressed, but always conservative. He shows up to an awards ceremony for playing football, and he dresses like the CEO of the Ringling Brothers. He did it for the amusement his daughter, probably -- and to subconsciously tell all of us that this is not important. He loves to play the game, not talk about it and pat himself on the back."

DenverBroncos,3dknmx,KimonoThief,2,Fri Jul 17 03:04:34 2015 UTC,But they lost in a hilarious way and all of their secondary got hurt which caused them to lose.
DenverBroncos,3dknmx,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:10:06 2015 UTC,"The curse has been dormant since Hillis. Megatron's best season, yardage-wise, came the year of his Madden cover. AP didn't nearly break the rushing record his year like he did the year before, but he still went for 1200+, right around his usual production. Sherman was Sherman this season."

DenverBroncos,3dknmx,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Fri Jul 17 13:10:37 2015 UTC,The Madden curse only applies to the player and Sherman was the only one on the cover. Yes he got hurt but they didn't lose the Superbowl because of Sherman.

It will be a fairly big story either way: Antonio Smith showing up to camp, practice, and games, or Antonio Smith not showing up to camp, practice, and games.  Hopefully our Overlord Elway has gathered a lot of legal advice and gotten the right information from many parties and will make the right call.   I hope for justice in the case (as I do all cases). It's not up to me to judge whether or not he is guilty or innocent. But I can understand that it might be a distraction to the team and I could see the media making a big case about him if he comes to practice and games and such while his case gets worse against him."
DenverBroncos,3di1ue,BlindManBaldwin,10,Thu Jul 16 13:10:24 2015 UTC,I'm so glad we were able to sign him.

I think this is more a product of that. We've had a TON of prime time games since games since Manning came to town. And it's been great to watch. If someone can confirm that rule about getting a certain maximum number of prime time games per every few years.   Plus I'd really rather have us going under the radar. I wonder if a lot of prime time games is tougher to recover from. So the less attention on us the better. Let's just be a tough, hard-nosed football team and win the SB."

With DT signed, the broncos have the negotiating leverage of using the Franchise Tag on Von, and that helps get a favorable bronco contract signed.  They are in good cap space, so this should all be doable.  And who knows, the cap will probably go up quite a bit for next season too.  PS  the only issue is the suspension. If he violates a test again, he is gone for a year I think.  However,  that is a powerful point for the Broncos to use against him in negotiations, so that might make him a bit cheaper than anticipated."
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,EnglishBronco,1 point,Fri Jul 17 00:21:10 2015 UTC,"Yeah it all makes sense.  The suspension issue is interesting.  I'm sure he has learned from his past two suspensions, so hopefully nothing else happens."
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,peaceblaster68,4,Fri Jul 17 01:19:08 2015 UTC,All in all just fingers crossed we can keep him.
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,andrrrew,3,Thu Jul 16 23:00:51 2015 UTC,Von has always been the top priority. It's a surer thing than the long term DT deal was.
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,drax117,3,Fri Jul 17 01:16:31 2015 UTC,"I saw somebody say something about how Elway would not let Von go, not a chance in hell. Mainly because of Elway's stubbornness and the fact that Von Miller was his very first draft pick when he took a position in the front office.  Von will stay for a long time. And even though it hasn't happened yet, I couldn't be more excited about that."
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,Fridden,2,Fri Jul 17 05:20:36 2015 UTC,"I've said it before and I've said it again, if we lose Von our defense goes from an A to a C. We cannot lose him if we have any hope at all of having a great defense."
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,JaquiskiTaterTartt,2,Fri Jul 17 04:37:50 2015 UTC,I didn't think DT was worth $16M which he was originally asking for and obviously neither did Elway. I do however think Von is worth 100+
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,fueldr,2,Fri Jul 17 14:55:31 2015 UTC,"Can't lose a young, quality player like that. They'll do whatever to keep him on the team."
DenverBroncos,3dk6qt,badcompany1981,1 point,Mon Jul 20 15:39:50 2015 UTC,"A full year to worry about it. Manning will be gone next year (in all likelihood), Clady will be released, Ware may or may not come back (if Ray is the real deal, Denver could easily release him and save cap room)    I think there are more than enough moving parts to give Von his deal."

DenverBroncos,3df7zh,PMeist,5,Wed Jul 15 22:02:34 2015 UTC,Probably more than 1. Probably less than 1000
DenverBroncos,3df7zh,thndrstrk,6,Wed Jul 15 21:15:21 2015 UTC,DT can totally average 200 touchdowns per season for the next 5 seasons.

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Fridden,3,Wed Jul 15 21:22:48 2015 UTC,I'm more than okay with this. For awhile all the reports were 16/M+ is what he wanted but this I'm fine with.

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Mister_Jay_Peg,12,Wed Jul 15 20:09:17 2015 UTC,"Houston's deal today gave us a great baseline for Von. That's something you won't hear about much this season, but the number he signed for, if we can get Von there, would be HUGE."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,spndl1,5,Wed Jul 15 20:55:00 2015 UTC,"That's true. Von will (probably) get a decent size more than Houston because he's a bigger name and the cap goes up next year, as well, but if it the contract is comparable, we'll be in a damn good spot, cap wise."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Mister_Jay_Peg,11,Wed Jul 15 19:42:49 2015 UTC,"I don't think he'll get a ton more, because the only contract above it is Watt.  I can see him getting roughly the same or maybe $1m/yr more that Houston's 2016 figure."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,spndl1,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:46:36 2015 UTC,"Maybe decent size wasn't the right word. I think if he only got $1m/yr more than Houston's contract, it would be a massive win for the Broncos, but I don't think he's going to break the bank as he potentially could have without Houston's contract for reference."

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Reptar_1221,18,Wed Jul 15 19:45:00 2015 UTC,Well this is not close to the CJ money that was reported that DT wanted. That is when all that talk happened. This is a reasonable top 5 contract. Good for both sides.
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Richa5280,9,Wed Jul 15 20:10:33 2015 UTC,"True, but just look at the posts over the past 24 hours. So many people were willing to let him walk and some were even saying things like we would be better off without him, we don't need him, fuck DT... You'd have to be crazy to think or say any of those things."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,yamaha2k11,13,Wed Jul 15 19:42:03 2015 UTC,"I would be willing to let him walk if he wanted more money than the,far and away, best receiver in the game. Don't get me wrong DT is a great talent, but he needs to take less plays off and he is not the best at going up and fighting for the ball at its highest point. I don't even think he is worth the contract Dez got. But I'm happy he is on our team."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,SmartToaster,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:48:31 2015 UTC,"I don't think we would be better without him, I was just saying that we have some decent WRs, and that re-signing Von should be a bigger priority since it's harder to replace a stud OLB than a stud WR. Hearing that he wanted more than Calvin Johnson was making was worrying me. I don't think any non-QB should be payed as much as Johnson was.  They won't be able to replace DT, but I'm glad they got him at around $14mil/year instead of $17mil/year that DT wanted.  That being said, I'm fucking happy this drama is over and DT will be in a Bronco uniform for a while. I just hope we have the money to sign Von, but I'm sure Elway will work his magic and get him re-signed regardless."

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,agugoobe,3,Wed Jul 15 20:45:33 2015 UTC,So this means they have a lot of raith in brock right?

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Imachocolatebear,2,Wed Jul 15 21:23:19 2015 UTC,"well its just that i have heard a lot of talk that keeping Demaryius without a good qb would be a waste.  i dont know how much i agree with that, but thats what the talking heads are saying"

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,MasonL52,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:42:05 2015 UTC,"It would be some random number like 8.7 million if I'm not mistaken. Don't forget the impending Colquitt and Caldwell cuts, though."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,alchupanebra,2,Wed Jul 15 19:46:19 2015 UTC,even if just ware were to be released or the more likely scenario clady i think were good to re-sign von
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Imachocolatebear,3,Wed Jul 15 21:52:27 2015 UTC,My issues come more with having to sign Trev and Malik..
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,shindigg15,2,Thu Jul 16 15:19:56 2015 UTC,im sure atleast one of them will be gone personally i hope trevathon stays but in a best case scenario we can keep most of our defence together
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Tranysaurus,1 point,Wed Jul 15 19:52:05 2015 UTC,"Guessing out of Trevathan, Wolfe, Marshall, and Jackson two out of the four will likely be gone. I feel like we have good depth at linebacker though and wouldn't be too too worried about it"

DenverBroncos,3df1v1,MountCRushmore,4,Wed Jul 15 21:41:32 2015 UTC,Now who will we not be able to re-sign because of this? I'm on the fence about this.
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,kgxv,4,Wed Jul 15 21:17:26 2015 UTC,"We actually look okay. If Sambrailo works out, Clady is likely cut. Ware will be out this year because of Ray. Peyton is probably gone, one way or the other.  Add a roughly $8mil-ish cap raise, and I think we can keep Malik, Danny, Brock and Wolfe/Marshall (one of two)."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,threeblackchairs,2,Wed Jul 15 19:51:40 2015 UTC,"Most likely going to be Marshal we keep IMO. Wolfe is good, but Marshal is much more valuable (at least after a small sample size of one season)"
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,AdaAstra,1 point,Wed Jul 15 20:06:19 2015 UTC,"Wolfe is going to BLOW UP this year. And besides, we're gonna have a lot more $ than people think. Colquitt, Caldwell, (potentially) Clady, (Potentially) Peyton, (Potentially) Talib, (hopefully) Stewart? All being gone frees up BOATLOADS of cash. Miller will be resigned. Osweiler will be resigned. Trevathan, Marshall, Wolfe, and Jackson are all secondary to those two, but I firmly believe at least three of those four will be resigned."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,M3rc_Nate,5,Wed Jul 15 21:44:23 2015 UTC,Congrats to you too signing brothers!
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,edditorRay,4,Thu Jul 16 13:57:28 2015 UTC,"This is acceptable.  More than I was hoping, but guess at some point we need to just throw so money to keep them from going to a rival."
DenverBroncos,3df1v1,Guardax,2,Thu Jul 16 15:24:07 2015 UTC,"Gotta figure you do what you can to please him/keep him and have another SB run in what could very likely be Peyton's last year, then if the new QB steps in and with the pieces around him isn't a SB contender (yet), you can draft a first or second round WR and trade DT (and his cap hit) to another team and get a boat load of draft picks or a draft pick and a player you really really like (to fill a need).   I'm not saying DT is easily replaceable, but with WR's coming out of the draft now a-days like they are in the first round, and even the second and third round, you could find yourself a Kevin White, A-Cooper, OBJr, K-Benjamin, S-Watkins, Mike Evans, John Brown, etc to replace the 1,000 yards and high count TD's that you'd lose trading DT.   That's just one option if your team ends up not liking his cap hit and doesn't feel like paying him that much makes sense when you have a new QB and you'd rather spend the money elsewhere to make the team better and get a WR for cheap (draft pick) that can get similar production in their rookie season.   (Similar to what the Saints did with Jimmy, except in the scenario I am painting the catalyst is Peyton retiring)"

DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,SawzeBawse,39,Thu Jul 16 03:08:12 2015 UTC,Yes. And we will pay him Justin Houston money.
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,BlindManBaldwin,-2,Thu Jul 16 03:11:43 2015 UTC,I hope we do. For some reason the Shane Ray pick gives me doubts
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,NUGGman,13,Thu Jul 16 07:04:20 2015 UTC,Elway flat out said today the FO's next major business is locking up Von.
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,BlindManBaldwin,11,Thu Jul 16 12:52:25 2015 UTC,"Because Elway knows you need more than one top tier pass rusher. Von is absolutely going to get signed, he's the face of the franchise once Manning is gone."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,DLBork,1 point,Thu Jul 16 15:37:53 2015 UTC,"I hope you're right. I figure that Elway knows you win championships when guys are willing to not be the highest paid players in the league. We didn't win a Super Bowl until John took a pay cut (granted he just spread his payments over a longer period of time)  I'm a bit of a pessimist by nature, sorry."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Jul 16 16:12:16 2015 UTC,And he knows it's pretty likely this is Ware's last season with us.
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,Fridden,3,Fri Jul 17 20:20:27 2015 UTC,I think Ray will more or less compliment Von and fill Ware's spot when the time comes.
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,justmattyboy,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:06:30 2015 UTC,You're probably right. When Shane takes over for Ware his cost savings will probably offset the expense of Von.
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,NUGGman,14,Thu Jul 16 20:12:27 2015 UTC,"Yes, Von will. And he absolutely deserves it, he's almost neck-and-neck with Houston's stats with 7 less games. Best case scenario- Roby balls out again this year and we cut Talib, freeing up some cap space. Oline looks above average as well and Clady is gone (as much as that pains, I love him and hope he sticks around, maybe we get lucky and he re-structures), we win the Super Bowl and Manning retires (he's said multiple times he intends to play out his ENTIRE contract, which would leave 1 more season after next season), and thus, we have a good amount of free cap space to shower Von in out 'love', as well as the handful of other impact players that'll be FA's next offseason. If we keep Von around, it'll be a win for us."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,crueg,16,Thu Jul 16 03:15:03 2015 UTC,Vonderful
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,von_bot,9,Thu Jul 16 03:15:17 2015 UTC,"No. He'll chase Von Miller money, and he'll get it. Von > Houston"
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,ignitionnight,7,Thu Jul 16 15:07:20 2015 UTC,"I have a VERY strong feeling that Manning, Clady, and Ware will all be gone next season.   Whatever happens with Manning, whether he retires or tries to sign with another team, I just don't see us letting Brock go unless we think we can find someone late in the draft. But we need to pay Brock next year also.  Clady will get cut if our Oline works well this season. If not then he is the least likely to be cut. But if we cut him or not he will still be playing in the NFL. Someone will pick him up if we don't need him.  And Ware is getting old, he got tired last year. We have a really great LB already, Ray may or may not take off but if he does it will spell Ware out of here even easier.   So if all 3 are gone (I think) that is roughly 5.3 million in dead money against the cap. But it saves us roughly 37 million against the cap. My numbers could be wrong but that's what I've gathered from overthecap.com.   And as of right now on overthecap.com we have ~7 million in free space for 2016. Again I am nowhere near an expert but if we have roughly 44 million in free space, we won't have any problems signing Von, either Trevathan or Marshall (whomever performs better this season/looks better for future success), CJ, Brock and others.   Edit: If I am wrong on my numbers please let me know. I am no expert in contracts and cap spaces and how they all work. There might be something I'm missing so if someone knows more than I do please correct me. I would love to know just how much cap space we have for 2016 FA."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,PMeist,5,Thu Jul 16 03:39:31 2015 UTC,"I pray, PRAY clady restructures to save us cap space. he's been an outstanding bronco, on and off the field, for his entire career and just because he's been getting boned by injury i dont want to see him go. but i agree with you agree, like 95%"
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,crueg,4,Thu Jul 16 04:05:47 2015 UTC,"Clady really is the one that is the hardest to let go. It's actually kind of easy to let Manning go next season, as weird as that is to say. If people think about it, he's due 21.5 million. But if we cut him it's only 2.5 in dead money. We can use that ~19 million to sign a lot of talent.   Ware will be let go of easily for 1.6 mil in dead money. He's gone for sure, or if he has a good season we will ask him to renegotiate way down. Like he will be making far less than he is now, even still I see him being gone.   Then with Clady we still don't know if we need him or not. We may wind up having to keep him out of necessity. Maybe Sambrailo is the next guy for us and our oline performs well. But I agree Clady can renegotiate and stay, at least easier than anyone else can but only out of need.  It's going to be one of the most interesting seasons in Broncos history. Like this season has the potential to be another SB run, but all the story lines for next offseason will be crazy!"
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,PMeist,2,Thu Jul 16 04:23:10 2015 UTC,"I agree, Ware was definitely a ""win now"" signing, and if Shane Ray shows he's going to be a good replacement, I think Ware will be gone. It's so hard to tell what Manning will do, I can't imagine him wanting to retire, he loves the games and wants to play as long as he can. I can only hope we win the next 2 super bowls and he goes out like Elway did, and he can retire with a shitload of dignity and a lot of consideration as the best at his position."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,crueg,2,Thu Jul 16 04:41:27 2015 UTC,"We need both Marshall and Trevathan as we run a 3-4 now, so two ILBs who are good at pass coverage as well as tackling are necessary. That's both of them to a tee"
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,kgxv,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:21:37 2015 UTC,"I agree. We need them both this year. But if money gets tight in the offseason I could see Denver at most signing one of them. Whichever looks like a better future prospect, which I would assume would be Marshall. I'm worried about how Trevathan is going to perform, he literally has another persons knee in him now.   Anyways, just saying I think it'll be a 'next man up' kind of mentality, as much as I love them both."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,PMeist,1 point,Thu Jul 16 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"It's not gonna work like that with the ILB's unless we have our eye on somebody else coming up right now. Danny and Brandon will both get contracts, unless one of them lights the world on fire and requires a top 5-10 contract, we will lock both down for a couple more years.  Also Danny's knee is not literally 100% somebody else's (cannot find the damn interview tonight but will keep searching). It's been rebuilt but his interview saying it was somebody else's cap was not exactly correct."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,RedRiderJman,3,Fri Jul 17 10:16:15 2015 UTC,"He will, correctly, want and receive more than Houston."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,njm1314,2,Thu Jul 16 16:27:03 2015 UTC,"Absolutely, at the very least we can use the tag, (I hope not I want this man paid) if we pay a little more than Houston's money I would be fine with that, Von is a studly muffin."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,skullyD,1 point,Thu Jul 16 03:18:34 2015 UTC,"It's gonna be another year away, it will most certainly be more than Houston's contract. Pending in where the cap goes and who else signs deals next year, Von will absolutely break the bank and be the highest paid defensive player when he signs. He is worth it, he knows it, Elway knows it, we know it."
DenverBroncos,3dgnyo,RedRiderJman,1 point,Fri Jul 17 10:20:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, depending on the year he has, he could go bigger too."

I get it, be wary of the cap but we have a legit super star. Lock him up. He's going to want fair market value or slightly above fair market value and he's worth it. Let's keep our super stars.

DenverBroncos,3dgsr8,designated_shitter,3,Thu Jul 16 21:51:44 2015 UTC,Yeah. I feel like it depends on if he gets any opportunities to prove himself this season. If he doesn't and they want to move forward with him then I don't expect more than maybe a 2 year deal for not too crazy much money. They would probably bring in a veteran back up or something to take over if he couldn't for the season.

DenverBroncos,3df4st,Avocet330,2,Wed Jul 15 20:29:13 2015 UTC,One of the most exciting plays from all of last season.
DenverBroncos,3df4st,baha24,3,Wed Jul 15 20:14:16 2015 UTC,"Arizona bringing its West Coast Defense to Denver, the Broncos clung to a 14-13 lead with 1:48 remaining before intermission, pinned on their 14. Peyton Manning came to the line and saw Demaryius Thomas in man-on-man press coverage against Antonio Cromartie, with only a single safety high. Manning audibled to a go route to Thomas, plus a post to Wes Welker to freeze the safety away in the center. Thomas ""got off the line"" against Cromartie, who lunged at his ankles and fell down, the safety well out of the action. Eighty-six-yard touchdown pass. Sweet.  There was only 1:48 remaining, and the Broncs were pinned .They'd either kill the clock or take deep shots. Why was Arizona in an overstacked, rush-prevent front with only one safety? Sour. Fun fact: According to the Game Book, it took Thomas 11 seconds to run 86 yards in full pads, which isn't all that different from the numbers track guys post in their undershorts.   From this article."
DenverBroncos,3df4st,baha24,5,Wed Jul 15 20:21:56 2015 UTC,"Yeah, he apparently runs a 4.38 40. That's disgusting."
DenverBroncos,3df9qm,Danieltmv,5,Wed Jul 15 20:30:29 2015 UTC,I'm thrilled too. It has been a big week for Demaryius between this big signing and his mother's sentence getting commuted by Obama. I'm happy that my new DT jersey won't go to waste. But I'd be lying if I said I wasn't nervous about our future. Hopefully our management can figure out a way to get everyone paid in the future.
DenverBroncos,3df9qm,taotechill,3,Wed Jul 15 21:29:37 2015 UTC,"I'm nervous also, but we have so many key pieces for years to come now. Harris, Talib, DT, Cody, Roby, Shane Ray, Virgil, TJ, we have many linebackers that need resigning in the coming years (Danny, BMarsh, and Von most importantly). If we can show at least steady improvement at O and D line over the next few years, get Sanders back and stay healthy we have all the pieces besides a quarterback.

DenverBroncos,3de839,Bronc27,7,Wed Jul 15 16:19:33 2015 UTC,"Better reason for us to not make DT the highest paid receiver in the NFL. Von's deal would have to come to close this, or exceed it. Von is a special player. DT is very good, but receivers are definitely easier to come by than pass rushers like Von Miller."

DenverBroncos,3ddg92,yamaha2k11,13,Wed Jul 15 12:58:43 2015 UTC,"I'd rather pay Von than DT tbh. A beast of an OLB is a lot harder to replace than a stud WR. Plus I'm thinking our offense will move to be more run-orientated anyways.  I like DT, but I don't think he should be signed for Calvin Johnson money, especially if it cripples other areas on our team."
DenverBroncos,3ddg92,von_bot,5,Wed Jul 15 14:36:05 2015 UTC,Looks like a Von Killer
DenverBroncos,3ddg92,MillerTime58,2,Wed Jul 15 14:37:13 2015 UTC,stud WR   The problem with good WRs is they need semi-decent QBs to throw them the ball.  OLB's don't need that.
DenverBroncos,3ddg92,yamaha2k11,2,Wed Jul 15 16:32:11 2015 UTC,"True, even though it was he second year, he only had 550 yards with Tebow and Orton throwing to him. I believe that Osweiler will be a better QB than both of them, but even then, I think Kubiac wants us to go back to the ground and pound type of game that won us 2 SBs.  Even without DT, Sanders has shown that he can be a big offensive threat, and I've heard great things about Latimer, so hopefully he'll be able to step up and take DT's place if needed.  I don't want DT to leave, but I won't be upset if he did. NFL careers are short and I don't blame him for trying to get all the money he can get right now. I just don't think we should cripple our chances by eating a big chunk of cap space on a non-QB. That being said, if we get rid of Clady next year and Manning retires, his contract shouldn't be that big of an issue, even with Von getting a big deal."
DenverBroncos,3ddg92,MillerTime58,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:42:10 2015 UTC,"I don't want DT to leave   Yeah man, I don't want him to leave either.  But if we pay him the 50 million he wants, then good luck finding a decent QB to fill in after Manning retires next year.    I'm hoping the silver lining to all this is Osweiler might be the next aaron rogers in waiting?"

I thought that depends on what Manning does, and I keep on hearing he wants to play out his contract, so I don't know how things will work out for the '16 season if Manning plays next year.  If we can pay both, then I agree, lets pay DT and get this shit done alright."
DenverBroncos,3ddg92,BlindManBaldwin,2,Wed Jul 15 14:39:17 2015 UTC,Yes we can! If we cut Clady (which is very likely) and if Manning retires (which is also very likely) we save 30 million in cap space.
DenverBroncos,3ddzl7,Ezeran,5,Wed Jul 15 15:06:24 2015 UTC,"At this point, I hope Elway just moves on.

DenverBroncos,3ddmrn,baha24,3,Wed Jul 15 13:32:24 2015 UTC,Honestly I have lost a lot of respect for DT throughout this process. Yeah I know he is a top three receiver but the city of Denver loves this dude and without Peyton I don't see him being top three anymore. I were him I would humble up a bit and not second guess the great position he is already in. To add a side note if he does leave I don't see it becoming a huge issue with the new offensive system that is going to be implemented and IMO I think Latimer could step up big time I really like the looks of him.
DenverBroncos,3ddmrn,MillerTime58,3,Wed Jul 15 16:13:38 2015 UTC,Why is it that reddit takes Rappaport's word as gold?  When it comes to the Broncos I'll take Vic Lombardi's word and sources.  He seems to think the two sides are going to work up until the 2pm deadline to make a deal happen.

Your NFL career could be over in any single snap, even in practice sometimes. Your contemporaries are being paid more/just as much. Your boss is profiting literal billions off of your play. You're sacrificing your body for those guys in a major way. He doesn't deserve any shit for trying to get paid."

DenverBroncos,3ddyob,meztastic,3,Wed Jul 15 14:59:43 2015 UTC,I think you have Brock to high at 15 Mil.
DenverBroncos,3ddyob,OFoutlaw,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:11:36 2015 UTC,"He's the one I was struggling with most. But I thought of it this way, how much would someone else pay him? $15 million puts him under every starting QB not under a rookie contract except Brady, which is an exception due to TB not being the primary breadwinner of his household so he could pretty much play for free if the NFLPA wouldn't make a huge stink. Maybe it's closer to the 13 that Bradford makes* but he's got less injury history than Bradford, and so I think it's either going to be $15 million for a longer term deal that the Broncos hope ends up being a bargain or a short term deal for like 6ish(?) that lets everyone evaluate him and then pay him more after that or move on IMO.  EDIT: Apparently Bradford's number is from his rookie contract so he's not the best comparison. But I still think he'd get at least 14-15 million because if you look at any of the starting QB's, they are making at least $15 million except Brady who doesn't need the money."
DenverBroncos,3ddyob,bcos4life,1 point,Wed Jul 15 16:22:05 2015 UTC,"Brock won't get more than 6 mil a year, IMHO. It will only be a couple years, as a ""show me"" contract."
DenverBroncos,3ddyob,AdaAstra,2,Wed Jul 15 16:50:15 2015 UTC,"I don't think it'll be that little. I agree $15 million is a bit much, but Rodgers got $10.5 million a year for 6 years coming off 3 years of sitting behind Favre and a decent start to the season. I can see other teams offering him at least $10 million (Browns/Texans/Bills/Jets/Rams). I may be pessimistic, but I think QB desperate teams would throw money at potential and the Broncos would be incredibly fortunate to get him for $6 million."
DenverBroncos,3ddyob,Iamnottouchingewe,2,Wed Jul 15 17:13:16 2015 UTC,He will get more than that. Especially if he tries the market.

DenverBroncos,3dbwj3,lsjunior,4,Wed Jul 15 06:48:27 2015 UTC,"I'm too lazy to do it but I would love if someone would please tell me what the % of the cap is compared to previous years. The current cap is 143 mil. Projected at at least $150 mil for 2016. So are previous non-calvin contracts near 10% of previous caps?   I'd do it but I'm on mobile and that feels difficult.   Edit: I went into it a bit. The cap was 120 mil essentially for '12 and '13. The highest WR contracts are were Wallace, Fitz, and CJ for $12, $15, and $19 mil respectively.   So wallace's horrible contract that everyone says was an overpay is essentially the same as a $15 mil contract with $150 cap.   His stats never even touched what DT has done and is most likely the floor for any QB not named Tebow.   After looking at all this I feel like we should probably pay him $15. It's in line at least.   Edit 2: had to check out guarantees after seeing that being the point of the thread. Wallace got 50% of his contract guaranteed at 30/60. If DT took a contract at 15/yr then let's say 5/75 for comparison sake. Then if DT got 40 guaranteed he'd be well over 50% and he wants 50+?! He needs to settle down. I'll let him walk and join the Jags with JT. It'll hurt but we can make gains in other areas."

DenverBroncos,3dan0t,drax117,8,Tue Jul 14 21:27:18 2015 UTC,"People have to also look at the fact that we will likely cut Clady (10 million saved) and Manning will be 40 years old and will likely retire (20 million saved). Also the chance if Roby develops enough we could cut Talib. Plus gotta factor in growth in the cap. Brandon Marshall will be an RFA, so we can match any other offer people give him. We will easily be able to keep Trevathan, Marshall, Wolfe, and of course Von. Odd man out may be Malik Jackson, but if someone wants to pay him 10 million a season than fine by me."
DenverBroncos,3dan0t,drax117,2,Tue Jul 14 21:33:51 2015 UTC,"Odd man out may be Malik Jackson   A huge mistake. https://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2015/06/26/pass-rusher-profile-malik-jackson/   Also the chance if Roby develops enough we could cut Talib   You on the crack mate  Dont get me wrong, Roby is fucking awesome. However, it would take a HUGEEEEE drop in production from Talib to even begin to warrant discussing cutting him. If you dont think he's top 5 CB's in the league, you crazy.

DenverBroncos,3dan0t,drax117,8,Tue Jul 14 21:35:57 2015 UTC,"I'm not. Talib is due a lot of money following this year, and if Roby keeps up his development (he had a really good year for a rookie CB), we might cut him.

When he retires we free up ~$20 million of cap space. On top of that, unless Clady is willing to take a pay cut we will most likely be letting him go as well next year, freeing up another $10 million. That is enough to lock up most if not all of the guys listed above. At worst we will maybe lose Malik, but I would take DT over Malik any day."

DenverBroncos,3dan0t,drax117,3,Tue Jul 14 21:34:50 2015 UTC,Think of how DT played well when he got healthy and he had Tebow throwing him the ball. Whoever is under center after Peyton will be better than Timmy.
DenverBroncos,3dan0t,dgapinski,2,Tue Jul 14 21:36:20 2015 UTC,"I just believe that we can find guys to catch the ball no matter what, while the talent we have grown on defense is not something that you come along very often, and is not something we should just give up easily."
DenverBroncos,3dan0t,drax117,2,Tue Jul 14 21:38:21 2015 UTC,"You are being biased towards recency. From my research (which isn't a lot), but imo the last two drafts have been the best for WR since 1996, and there isn't a lot more of those in college that are coming up. A good QB with no one to throw to ends up being early 90s Elway with Shannon Sharpe and literally who on offense. You gotta lock up a franchise guy like this or you turn into the Orlando Magic.   In addition, we have a top DC and a  top DL coach in the league. We will be fine to coach up talent, especially with the corps we will still have (Von, Chris, Roby, Ware, Marshall, Trevathan).   Sure, the Cards would have had more cap space if they didn't sign Fitz to that monster deal, but if they didn't they would have had no QB and no talent to put butts in the seats. Guys like DT don't grow on trees."

You dont think that after how well they have played they wont be demanding money, or that other teams wont be looking to pay them more than we can?   Without the room to fight for these guys, we might just lose them. And that to me is a scary thought."
DenverBroncos,3dan0t,crueg,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:43:53 2015 UTC,"Marshall is a RFA, so we can match anything he is offered and Trevathan is coming off of major injuries, so we have no clue if he will play well this year or not, and because of those injuries, other teams may be more anxious to spend top dollar on him compared to John ""the heck is a salary cap"" Elway."

Maybe someone more knowledgeable can dissuade my fears, but what I'm truly afraid of is paying DT his huge payday, and then us somehow coming short on this huge Von payday."
DenverBroncos,3dan0t,ATLRockies,2,Tue Jul 14 21:50:59 2015 UTC,"Von is already getting paid 9.75 million this year. His cap hit won't increase as drastically as a lot of people are thinking. He'll get paid somewhere between the Clay Matthews and JJ Watt deals most likely, so think an average of around 15 million a year (~5.5 million more than this year).

If a large chunk of the guaranteed money hits in the first year or two, $40 mil guaranteed isn't too bad.

DenverBroncos,3dbckz,njm1314,6,Wed Jul 15 02:29:16 2015 UTC,That sucks but is absolutely the correct move on his part. If you aren't signed then there is no reason to ever be on that field. It's just dumb. That contract is the only real protection you have in this league.
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,Occams_Lazor_,5,Wed Jul 15 00:12:09 2015 UTC,Amen. I usually always side with the player over the FO.
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,njm1314,2,Wed Jul 15 00:13:55 2015 UTC,Why not sign and continue to negotiate?
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,BingBongtheArcher19,2,Wed Jul 15 01:31:40 2015 UTC,And give up all of his leverage?
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,Fridden,1 point,Wed Jul 15 04:38:50 2015 UTC,"How is this the correct move on his part? It's not like by missing games he can force the Broncos to give him a long term contract. Once the deadline is passed, that's it. By sitting out games all he's doing is missing out on the money that's guaranteed with the franchise tag."
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,jCcrackhead,0,Wed Jul 15 01:29:13 2015 UTC,Really? He's under contract end of story.
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,Fridden,3,Wed Jul 15 01:07:50 2015 UTC,"Really, since when?  Last I checked he hasn't signed anything"
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,jCcrackhead,0,Wed Jul 15 01:30:03 2015 UTC,He was tagged. Sure technically right this second he is not under contract but whenever the deadline is for getting a long term deal done he will have to sign that. So yes he will be under contract.
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,FartisticLicense,2,Wed Jul 15 01:56:43 2015 UTC,He doesn't have to sign anything until the 10th game of the year.
DenverBroncos,3dbckz,Fridden,2,Wed Jul 15 11:04:31 2015 UTC,"Two thoughts: 1. How much money does he lose for each game he sits out? 2. Not many teams are willing to spend Calvin Johnson money for wide receivers,  and if him and Denver  are parting ways then he needs  a good year for another team to justify throwing that much money at him. What I'm  getting at is we have a new coach and a new system,  so if he sits out training  camp what are the odds he picks up the system  immediately when he does eventually play? Isn't it more likely he gets off to a slow start, looks worse than usual, and negatively impacts any potential offers for next year? Because of the new system, I think if he sits out for training camp and some games he has a down  year as a result and ultimately signs a deal next year for less than what the Broncos offered him this week."

I would assume the players, teams and union wants to get the deals signed tomorrow. Nobody wants to go through litigation.   If they don't sign and the NFLPA can prove Jones said that?

DenverBroncos,3dbgus,TheClayroo,6,Wed Jul 15 00:05:57 2015 UTC,"that's the thing,  he really needs some playing time, regular season playing time.  If he can pull off a matt flynn one-great-game filling in for manning (or a scott mitchell run of a few good games in for marino)  then maybe he does go to FA and does very well.  If he rides the bench all season,  i'd think he'd be back."

If PFM sticks around he may just go somewhere and sign 2 or 3 year contract just to prove he's worth the big money when he actually gets to play. Another thing, people are going to hold him to very high standards if he does replace Manning. Its gonna be tough for him but im ready for the Crustacean Sensation"

Drafted a big project at QB and was too involved in management. And also the fact he was a horrible head coach. Dude you are way way off on his personnel decisions. Yea sure he got DT right. How about the fact at that time he traded our best WR for nothing. A pretty prolific Tight End at the time and our ""Franchise QB"". That isn't how you come into an organization and you're giving him way to much credit for the Broncos current success. That was a dark era no matter how you look at it.   EDIT: I'm sorry I gotta keep going. Besides DT dude how did he set the table now?!?!? That is 100% false.

Care to bring up 2011's DT vs Megatron numbers?   Calvin Johnson: 1,681 yards, 16 TDs (1st in NFL)  Demaryius Thomas: 551 yards 4 TDs (80th in NFL)  So don't discount who is throwing DT the ball. That's the mistake everyone is making. Manning is soooooo much better than Stafford that if Megatron were on the Broncos, he'd be setting WR all time records each and every year.  I love me some DT, but he simply isn't in the same class as Megatron. Plus those stats from the ""Manning years"" in Denver don't reflect Calvin Johnson missing games. Even with him missing games, he's right there with DT's numbers."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Big_Pete1999,2,Tue Jul 14 15:09:30 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, the great Tebow to DT year where DT played like 6 full games, only having started/finished 5 in the regular season that year. In fact, he was compared at the end of his first healthy month to putting up matching numbers with CJ... with Tebow at the helm."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,dgapinski,1 point,Tue Jul 14 23:33:33 2015 UTC,"Doesn't matter the qualifier on it or else you can qualify that DT isn't in Calvin's league cause Manning was the one throwing.   I provided those numbers to show that the QB has every bit as much impact on the WRs numbers as the WR does. It's just fact.   So throwing out the D-Train and Megatron comparisons are foolish at best because of the QB throwing hem the ball. I'm not saying Stafford is Tenow, but he sure as he'll isn't Peyton.   Remind me again about Randy Moss's Raider stats vs Patriot stats when he had a HoF QB throwing him the ball. One set was laughable, the other set NFL records.   That QB matters THAT MUCH."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Big_Pete1999,5,Wed Jul 15 12:01:20 2015 UTC,I just personally feel like this is all ridiculous. Multi multi millionaire's just wanting more and more money
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,drax117,4,Tue Jul 14 20:43:50 2015 UTC,"I haven't seen anything but nice things said about DT. The harshest it gets is simply ""I don't think DT is worth it"". I think almost everyone already agrees on this ""new perspective"" that we shouldn't blame DT for wanting more money. He's just not worth the % of the cap that he wants."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Oysta_Cracka,3,Tue Jul 14 15:14:34 2015 UTC,"I would love if the Broncos kept DT, but if he doesn't take the rumored contract everyone has been talking about, then I wouldn't want Elway to put more money on the table. I think Sanders is a good WR with a lot of drive, and I'm excited to see what Latimer could do. I can't justify paying DT more than CJ."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Juan_El_Way,3,Tue Jul 14 13:20:52 2015 UTC,"Plus people always make the mistake of 'Well this guys has left us so now we need to find his replacement.' Instead of thinking about how the team is going to change to try and fit the personnel around and brought in. Thinking that a team WANTS to stay the same with different players is just a mistake.   So with that in mind, having DT walk (potentially) will mean our team will change and just be different. It might mean we lose production but once Manning is gone (probably after this year) we might not need a DT. Not in Kubiak's offense. Kubiak has made superstar RB's into legends, average RB's into really good RB's, and below average RB's into serviceable. And he's done a lot of great work on the Oline as well throughout his whole career.   Look at the 2005 Broncos:   HC : Shanny  OC: Kubiak  QB: Plummer  RBs: Mike Anderson, Tatum Bell  WRs: Rod Smith, Ashlie Lelie  That year Plummer had a very nice season at 3300 yards, 18/7 TD/INT.   Anderson had 1,000+ and Bell had 900+ yards on the ground.  Rod Smith was ~35 at the time and had 85 receptions for 1,000 yards.   Lelie washed out of the league but still had 42 rec for 700+.   All I'm saying is we're going to return to Kubiak's offense and it will probably be okay without DT. Obviously it would be nice to have him around for Brock. But if 35 year old Smith can thrive in Kubiak's offense then I'm sure a lot of WR's can. It all depends on how Latimer develops. He won't be brought in to replace DT, if DT walks Latimer will walk in with a totally different offensive style. Either way, look for us to be a ground and pound team."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,PMeist,2,Tue Jul 14 13:37:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was definitely expecting us to go more run heavy with Kubiak. Regarding DT and Brock, I've read several articles talking about how well Brock and Latimer work together. While having a talent like DT at WR would definitely help Brock when it's his time, I don't feel like we're SOL without him. It'll be interesting to see how everything plays out. If DT stays, awesome, and if not then they'll adapt. I gotta say... all these changes are making me excited about this season. I can't wait to see how everything comes together."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Juan_El_Way,5,Tue Jul 14 14:00:55 2015 UTC,how well Brock and Latimer work together   Yes.
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Juan_El_Way,3,Tue Jul 14 14:32:59 2015 UTC,"I fucking love that play. Last year, preseason, correct?"
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Juan_El_Way,2,Tue Jul 14 14:55:56 2015 UTC,Yep. And I hope a sign of things to come.

DenverBroncos,3d8u11,jdylanstewart,2,Tue Jul 14 14:35:32 2015 UTC,"I can't justify paying DT more than CJ   Yeah, I don't necessarily disagree with you. And you don't need a highly paid receiver to be successful. Look at the last (at least) three SB champs: none had a top 5 receiver on the roster. I don't think we need to keep DT in order to have success (though it can't hurt having him around). It's just a matter of interests, and like /u/PMeist said, we have a ton of FAs next season that I think are far more important to keep around.  In other words, while I'm just trying to offer another perspective from the mostly anti-DT-trying-to-get-paid talk I've seen around the sub, I agree with you on the long-term outlook of our team."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,jdylanstewart,3,Tue Jul 14 13:53:46 2015 UTC,"I think you definitely have the right perspective and it is one I needed to be reminded of.  It's easy to get upset at DT and to be like, ""c'mon man, that's a lot of frieking money- just take the deal"" but then I look at myself.  I'm about to start my second year of law school.  By the time I graduate, I'll have clerked for a firm that I absolutely love for 2 years.  I love the firm, the people I work with, everything.  But upon graduation, don't you think for a second that I won't take a position at another firm should they offer me a higher salary.  When I look at it like that, I can't hold any ill will towards DT whatsoever."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Whocaresforkarma,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:40:53 2015 UTC,"It IS a factor though. I think most people would take a slightly lower salary (or even quite lower salary) to work at a place they already know and like with people they like rather than chance a position where they may make more money, but are miserable going to work every day."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,Brysky09,1 point,Tue Jul 14 14:55:56 2015 UTC,"They might, but I think what we're arguing is that you can't blame people if they don't. It's a tough call, and sometimes the $ figure weighs more heavily into the decision."

DenverBroncos,3d8u11,HippieHOP,3,Tue Jul 14 15:39:36 2015 UTC,"If winning super bowl is the goal, it wouldn't be prudent to pay DT the money he is asking. In a skill position where you play 3 guys most of time you cannot dump so much money into one person and expect to win a SB. You just have to move on even though it will hurt a lot.  The best option to move along and expect the next man up attitude. I also think Demariyus is overvaluing his market. There is no way he would get more money than CJ in open market."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,BlindManBaldwin,3,Tue Jul 14 18:27:23 2015 UTC,"I see it the same way. Understandably DT is already going to be set for life financially but I see no issue asking for more money. I felt the same way when JT signed with the Jags. Obviously they want to make the most money possible and I do not blame anyone for chasing money. Don't we all want to make as much money as possible? Give the man his pay day, he has earned it and stayed humble while doing it."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,taotechill,2,Tue Jul 14 21:25:54 2015 UTC,"It would be hard for me to pay him the 14 million or so we are probably offering. Echoing some of they comments mentioned, we have several key defensive free agents next year. If Malik Jackson shines in 3-4 I would love to keep him. Demaryius and Dez use to be rare breeds coming out of college, now plenty of 6'2+ WRs are coming out every year with different skill sets. I love DT, but if he wants Megatron money I hope Elway let's him find it elsewhere."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,BlindManBaldwin,4,Tue Jul 14 14:12:46 2015 UTC,"I understand this but its hard to agree when they already make much more money than the general population. Is it really that bad to make 9 mil instead of 11 like come on I don't even know what I would do with that kind of money. I feel as if you are winning and have good camaraderie with a team money should be no reason to leave or refuse a deal. To me it is selfish players should be grateful for the position they are in. I personally would love to play a professional sport for 100,000 a year to me that is more than enough."
DenverBroncos,3d8u11,von_bot,1 point,Tue Jul 14 15:55:40 2015 UTC,"I understand that argument, and I think it's completely fair. I suppose my counterargument is that many players are only in the game for a limited number of years -- in fact, the average length of an NFL career is three years -- whereas the general population is making money consistently for decades more. A lot of these guys don't go on to become commentators, coaches, or GMs, so it behooves them to make as much as they can during their limited tenure as a pro."

DenverBroncos,3d76ps,DeusMexMachina,3,Tue Jul 14 16:10:19 2015 UTC,"The cash these dudes make is heady for us plebes, but look at it from their perspective:  most of them have no real transferable skills.  Even if they got good degrees, that may have been years ago and they have not done so much as an internship since.  Would you hire that guy if he weren't a famous athlete?  And this is assuming that friends and family haven't bled them, and they've invested all their money smartly.   So I mean, I want the players I love on the team that I love to be as in love with the team/city as I am.  But I don't blame any of them for getting as much cash as possible, because for the majority, what they make in the few short years they play football might be all the cash they'll ever make their whole lives."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,designated_shitter,-1,Tue Jul 14 16:19:57 2015 UTC,"The 14 million he would make this year translates to 350k a year for 40 years. If he runs out of cash and has to find a job, that's on him. Fact is, winning and being part of a top flight franchise should be worth and extra million or so a year. The whole maximum value idea is fucked by franchises like the Jets, Redskins, Raiders, etc. The fact that bad franchises will over-pay for good players doesn't mean the player is worth that much. It just means that players who don't care about winning and succeeding have a place to go play out their careers while making 10% more than they would with a successful franchise. If the 10% is worth it, then go for it, you care about making slightly more money than being a part of a winning group, we don't want you."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,DeusMexMachina,7,Tue Jul 14 16:44:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn't make me sad at all. Players have every right to seek out the best deal possible for themselves. Football teams are businesses at the end of the day, and it's in their financial interest not to pay more than they have to to keep a player. From the perspective of the employer-employee relationship, DT should try to get as much money as he possibly can, just like any other employee would try to do in a negotiation with his or her bosses. It comes down to whether or not the company is willing to pay; it's not DT's responsibility to ""take one for the team."" In what other field would we make employees do such a thing?  I think sometimes we let our fandom blind us to the reality that players are also workers, and they have every right to make as much as they are worth, just as anyone else should."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,baha24,1 point,Tue Jul 14 12:03:23 2015 UTC,"It makes me sad because he's asking for more than he's worth, to the detriment of the team. Yes, there is a business aspect in sport, but there's also wanting to win. Plenty of players leave a little on the table to help the team get better. It saddens me that he's apparently unwilling to accept what sounds like a very fair deal for his value on the field in order to get maximum value. The fact that shitty organizations will overpay for good players doesn't mean that the players should always try and break the bank."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,DeusMexMachina,0,Tue Jul 14 16:09:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, because let's face it. That missing 2 million dollars is seriously going to break the fucking bank."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,Darthob,21,Tue Jul 14 14:49:35 2015 UTC,"Here's what I've learned over the last several seasons. When you have the right coaching staff and front office, no one is irreplaceable. DT wants to be paid more than megaton? Fuck him. We'll use the money else where and our offense will still produce. We have Peyton after all. The dude is known for making somebodies out of nobodies. DT wants megatron money? Go play for the fucking Jets or some other bumass team that can afford that shit. No championship contender can pony up that amount of cash."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,yazzl,7,Tue Jul 14 04:03:29 2015 UTC,"I agree. If this is really the sticking point, then good riddance. As a fan, I want players who want to win, not just get paid. DT could take some notes from Sanders. This is ridiculous."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,DeusMexMachina,3,Tue Jul 14 04:36:19 2015 UTC,"I think Peyton retires after this season.  If that's the case, we don't have that luxury.  If he really is holding out for Megatron money, yeah I would be okay parting ways.  But I really hope he comes around and takes the deal on the table"
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,ktsmyth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 08:15:22 2015 UTC,I'd put money on it that he will come around and take the deal on the table. He's not going to get a deal from anyone in the league that's worth more than Megatron's.
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Jul 14 16:07:45 2015 UTC,"Probably not, but he will get one for more than we offered"
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,ktsmyth,1 point,Tue Jul 14 17:04:23 2015 UTC,"Agreed, I would really, really love him back, but he is being greedy. I don't blame him, but he can take that somewhere else where they will pay him what he wants."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,Fridden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:54:19 2015 UTC,Well said. I'd rather lose a star player than overpay by millions and millions.
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,Thatguyyork,7,Tue Jul 14 06:07:37 2015 UTC,And in other news he wants to be paid MORE than the highest paid WR http://www.rotoworld.com/headlines/nfl/313211/report-broncos-offer-demaryius-$12m-plus-per   Thomas is said to be seeking Calvin Johnson money and beyond at $16 million-plus annually with around $50 million guaranteed.
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,Freyaka,4,Tue Jul 14 01:40:13 2015 UTC,Signed the damn deal DT.  Nobody deserves Megatron money.  That shit is insane.
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,msipes,2,Tue Jul 14 05:17:13 2015 UTC,Some people don't think megatron deserves megatron money. I think he is getting really bad advice from his agent.
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,Fridden,1 point,Tue Jul 14 05:56:03 2015 UTC,"His agent is giving him bad advice from our perspective as fans. But if you look at the trend of young receivers making a huge impact in the league, it's looking like the WR is going the way of the RB in terms of value. If that's the case this may be the last big WR signings....ever. As a broncos fan I don't want my team to be stuck with that albatross, but if I were DTs agent I would be trying to make sure my client is the one who makes that last big payday."
DenverBroncos,3d76ps,Beaudasious,1 point,Tue Jul 14 10:27:57 2015 UTC,I'm one of them. Detroit was very very stupid to sign  that kind of contract. I'd let him walk before I would have signed that albatross of a contract.

We have absolutely no idea what we have with this kid and the body of evidence doesn't support this thought process. That doesn't mean that he can't be the next Rodgers, but until we actually see him in a live game with adequate preparation leading into the game (instead of being tossed in during garbage time) We don't really have enough to know."
DenverBroncos,3d6pim,Freyaka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:05:05 2015 UTC,"I hear you, I can't wait to see him get in there and play, although right now Peyton is unquestionably giving us a better chance to win."
DenverBroncos,3d6pim,moeshapoppins,3,Tue Jul 14 02:13:11 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I have nothing against OZ, but I'm going to need to see more before I proclaim him the next anything. He could just as easily be the next Curtis Painter."
DenverBroncos,3d6pim,Freyaka,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:14:25 2015 UTC,I almost brought up Painter in my article. I didn't figure it would help my argument that Osweiler has a ton of potential. They kept Painter around because he knew the offense and he was cheap. Peyton wasn't going anywhere anytime soon at that point. Elway is still confident in Osweiler and I have confidence in Elway so I am hopeful.
DenverBroncos,3d6pim,ToughActinInaction,2,Tue Jul 14 02:23:00 2015 UTC,"I am absolutely willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and nothing would please me more than for him to be the next great thing. I just have to anchor myself in the realism that this might not be the case.  We'll see, I'm excited and hope he gets some extended playtime this offseason."

DenverBroncos,3d6pim,Just4Money,0,Tue Jul 14 02:28:57 2015 UTC,"What if Peyton retires at the end of this year, management has little faith in Brock being elite, and Peyton convinces Eli to come to Denver when his contract is up with the NYG at the end of the season and take the team built for him to the super bowl?"
DenverBroncos,3d6pim,irieCO,3,Tue Jul 14 04:27:20 2015 UTC,I'd say it would be more likely to see Phillip Rivers come to Denver to be honest.   And boy wouldn't it just make it hilarious for him to win a Superbowl in Denver after failing so often in San Diego?

However the markets not there. A lot of good received just got dumped on the market, CJ's deal was partly due to the old way rookie contacts got handled, and it's a lot of money for a non qb position."

DenverBroncos,3d6lcf,Denver112maj,2,Tue Jul 14 00:25:20 2015 UTC,"I don't think Clady will lose his job because of an injury. The man has been on the left side for almost a decade for us.   If he comes back and the injury clearly affected his talent then yes, no one is above getting cut, but I don't think he's that servicable. Then again, Elway has been pretty merciless when it come to cutting veterans."
DenverBroncos,3d6lcf,Greeney494,2,Mon Jul 13 23:27:56 2015 UTC,"Saves us a ton of money cutting him. And if that means we are able to sign Von, and Brandon Marshall, or others it may make a lot of sense"
DenverBroncos,3d6lcf,Bronc27,2,Mon Jul 13 23:56:45 2015 UTC,"Even if you want to put aside his recent stretch of injuries (torn patella, torn ACL, torn labrum, lisfranc) and last year's mediocre play, Clady is costing Denver 10 mil per year, and he only has 1.2 mil in dead money in 2016. Ty will make about 900k. Clady will have to be a hell of a lot better than Ty to justify paying an extra 8 mil, which could be very well spent in areas of greater need."
DenverBroncos,3d6lcf,mysterious_pube,1 point,Tue Jul 14 00:36:17 2015 UTC,He's gone imo. Unless he comes back and had some sort of a record season hell get cut or traded.

DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,LeftyBigGuns,7,Mon Jul 13 17:26:15 2015 UTC,I have a feeling Latimer will go off and DT might walk...
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,The_Super_Deer,8,Mon Jul 13 18:07:32 2015 UTC,"As much as I love DT and want him to stay, that is actually pretty close to best case scenario. Probably scenario #2 after DT taking a team friendly deal, which would have already happened if it was going to.  Latimer going off and DT walking gives us another couple years with an awesome #1 threat on a rookie deal we can put DT money to use in other areas.  Again, I definitely want to keep DT, but there is a potential for a silver lining."
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,spndl1,2,Mon Jul 13 19:11:03 2015 UTC,"i don't mean to be a prick, but what if Latimer fails to match DT at all? that's most likely scenario.  than you give DT even more leverage next year."
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,sunstersun,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:33:07 2015 UTC,I don't think it'd be more than he's already expecting though.
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,Colorado222,1 point,Mon Jul 13 19:46:19 2015 UTC,"If Latimer fails to match DT at all then it wouldn't be best case scenario and we're pretty much where we're already at right now. It'd be hard for the situation to become much worse, unless Manning decides to retire after this year and announces it before DT re-signs and decides to walk instead."
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,spndl1,1 point,Mon Jul 13 20:15:27 2015 UTC,"We don't necessarily need DT tho. Look at you guys. I'd say Edelman and Sanders are comparable in terms of talent and output, so if Latimer can be serviceable as a #2, that's all we need transitioning into a more run based offense"

DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,skullyD,3,Mon Jul 13 19:16:52 2015 UTC,I think that's what the FO is going to wait and see this upcoming season before they make any moves on his contract situation.   Hopefully Latimer will get extensive playing time to prove what kind of talent he really is.

It only makes sense because of how we were/are so stacked at WR and still drafted Latimer in the early second last year.   It's not really fooling anyone on what they're thinking.... But like I said I could be wrong."
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,skullyD,2,Mon Jul 13 18:19:22 2015 UTC,Vic Lombardi tweeted the exact opposite.

Do you argue that DT who gets the ball 9-12 times per game is worth as much as the two time DPOY and a guy who was in the running for league MVP last year?  Can you say with 100 percent certainty that DT will put up as many yards with OZ or some other unknown at QB? Hell, even CJ didn't put up fantastic numbers this year compared to his historic numbers and was not worth the money this year...  You won't get me to agree with you. DT isn't worth 16 million."
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,Freyaka,0,Tue Jul 14 02:13:07 2015 UTC,"CJ was hurt, can't blame him. DT does so much when he doesn't have the ball. Guy even was good with Tebow throwing him the ball, so a DT who is more disciplined and a better player will do great with Oz."
DenverBroncos,3d5cd3,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Tue Jul 14 02:18:04 2015 UTC,Yea especially now that it's being reported that he wants more money than the 16 mil/year that Calvin Johnson is making...

DenverBroncos,3d07mh,joycamp,27,Sun Jul 12 11:33:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with all that except for that it worked out okay. They way he used those draft picks was criminal. I also think kicking Cutler our had a big impact on also kicking out Marshall and Scheffler and probably more dudes I'm forgetting.   It's interesting how debilitating trading a starting qb can be - sure they got all those picks but then we had years of Tebow and Orton sucking it up, so who cares how good the draft pick haul was?  God I hate that stupid, arrogant, cheating fuckface."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,myshkingfh,13,Sun Jul 12 13:38:02 2015 UTC,"To put an exclamation point on this: that idiot drafted Alphonso Smith in the second round, trading away a future 1st round pick to do it! Has there ever been a worse move in a draft? Oh, and the pick that was traded was used by the Seahawks to draft none other than Earl Thomas - someone who undoubtedly played a major roll in our Super Bowl loss. While Alphonso Smith was eventually traded for Dan Gronkowski, only the 3rd worst Gronkowski brother - selected second-to-last in the same draft we wasted a future first to draft Smith! - as for Scheffler, our own promising tight end, he was traded away for a fifth rounder.   So to your original point, I'd rather have a Redskins-type-draft-haul-fleecing than ever have had McDaniels in Denver."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,amilio,8,Sun Jul 12 16:27:21 2015 UTC,Has there ever been a worse move in a draft?   Later in that draft he traded away two 3rd rounders to take Richard Quinn. A TE who had 12 career catches in college. Twelve. Course that is eleven more than he had in the NFL.
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,njm1314,4,Sun Jul 12 19:09:35 2015 UTC,Brandon Marshalls departure had a lot to do with Darrent Williams murder. There was a great article on si about it.

DenverBroncos,3d07mh,BingBongtheArcher19,0,Sun Jul 12 19:34:30 2015 UTC,How did the fans run him out of town. He was 7-3 the next year before Shanny benched him for Cutler. The fans find my do anything.
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,aljds,2,Sun Jul 12 16:51:35 2015 UTC,"He was actually 7-4, and doing it on the strength of the defense. Plummer was not having a good season in 2006. He had 11 touchdowns and 13 interceptions, and he was only completing 55% of his passes. I think the loss of Kubiak really hurt Plummer, as Kubiak was sort of the buffer between Shanahan and Plummer.   But Cutler came in and immediately improved the offense. The problem was the defense had essentially been exposed by Peyton Manning and the Colts and teams had figured out how to exploit it. But Cutler improved on Plummer: in just 5 starts he managed 9 touchdowns, threw for more yards per game, a higher touchdown percentage, and a lower interception percentage."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,BingBongtheArcher19,6,Sun Jul 12 19:40:32 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head about Kubiak's departure.    I'll disagree with you about Cutler immediately improving the offense.  In Nate Jackson's book (Nate Jackson was the 3rd string TE in 2006), he believes the move hurt the team, and worsened the locker room dynamics.  He mentioned how hard it was for the whole offense to shift gears and adjust to a new QB/Style of offense.    Looking at the numbers (using SRS to show strength of the defense, 0 is average, + is good, - is bad).   Home against 9-7  Seawhawks (Defense SRS of -1.9). 10/21, 121 yards, 2 TDs, 2 INT + 1 Fumble. Lost 20-23  @ 14-2 Chargers (Defense SRS of 0.2). 17/30, 188 yards 2 TDs 1 Fumble. Lost 20-48. Offense didn't start moving the ball until the 2nd half and we were already down 28-3.   @ 5-11 Arizona Cardinals (Defense SRS of -4.3). 21/31 261 yards 2 TDs, 1 INT. Win 37-20  Home against 8-8 Bengals (Defense SRS of 0.0) 12/23, 179 yards and 2 TDs. Win 24-23  Home against 7-9 49ers (Defense SRS -5.2) . 21/32, 230 yards, 1 TD, 1 INT   I don't think Cutler played any better than Plummer would have.  He put up decent numbers against the 49ers and Cardinals, two of the worst defenses in the league.  His other three games game against defenses that were average to below average."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,NUGGman,2,Sun Jul 12 21:29:57 2015 UTC,"You're probably right about the offense. I recalled it being better with Cutler than it actually was once I looked closer at the numbers.   What's amazing to me mostly is how the narrative regarding Plummer really changed over the years. At the time, pretty much everybody was calling for the Broncos to switch QBs because it was apparent that Plummer wasn't getting the job done. Now everyone acts like Plummer and the Broncos were doing great and Shanahan decided to switch quarterbacks for no good reason."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,NUGGman,2,Sun Jul 12 22:24:52 2015 UTC,"After Plummer flipped off the fans, there was a strong bias against him. People have now mostly forgotten that bias and just remember the results, which were very good. We had double digit wins every year he was our starter, and not in the years before and after he was here."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,Gurtang,0,Tue Jul 14 17:23:17 2015 UTC,"They didn't actually chase him out of town, but they called for his replacement and cheered for his replacement. Were you not around? Or was that meant to be rhetorical?"
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,Fridden,18,Sun Jul 12 16:58:47 2015 UTC,"It was a terrible move, hindsight or not. Getting Peyton was kind of a miracle, who knows where we would be without it.   Cutler was getting better, and he wasn't the only good young offensive weapon McDaniels got rid of for nothing in return (wasted draft picks). McDaniels had ONE thing to do : keep the good and try to improve the bad while learning the ropes. Instead he tried to impose the Patriot way from the get go even if it meant dealing away the best players. He was doomed to fail from the beginning (also with no help at all from the front office) and that trade, among many other moves, was a sign of it then and a proof now.   With all this context it was a doomed experiment with such a young coach anyway, except if he was a once in a lifetime genius."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,Gurtang,4,Sun Jul 12 12:38:19 2015 UTC,(also with no help at all from the front office)   He was part of the front office. That was the mistake making him GM too as a rookie HC? Wtf were we thinking?

Meanwhile, the Broncos have won 3 playoff games and gone to a Super Bowl in that time. Also, Cutler still only has half as many playoff wins as Rex Grossman in the same amount of years with the Bears. Yes Jay has a cannon, but so did Jeff George."

Consider what Cutler would look like behind a serviceable offensive line.  Also consider how he might have developed if he'd had B. Marsh his whole career, and not just recently reunited (also Sheffler).  What if we'd still drafted DT but not Moreno, or wasted a pick on Smith?  Etc.?  Getting Manning turned everything around, but considering where the franchise was when Cutler was traded (i.e. not that bad), I'd say that the setbacks may not have been worth it.  At the end of the day, we still haven't hoisted the Lombardi."

If we kept Cutler, do we just end up like the Bears right now? They haven't exactly been a paragon of success. Would we have Elway steering the ship right now?   At some point, Elway would have been brought back into the fold, but getting rid of Shanny and the subsequent debacle with McDaniels may have expedited that because Bowlen knew he needed to pull something off to get Broncos fans back. Yes, this is pure hypothetical, but I don't think it's unreasonable to think that The Cutler/McDaniels saga has more to do with how we got to where we are at this moment than you are giving credit for. Peyton coming here was not just winning a sweepstakes (pure chance) - Elway was a big part of that and we wouldn't have been in that position without the McDaniels/Cutler debacle.  To your point, there was absolutely no way to know that this all would happen when that decision was being made, but the Broncos being where they are at now wouldn't be possible without all that other stuff too."
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,patmass,3,Sun Jul 12 16:16:53 2015 UTC,"I agree with the logical chain of your argument, but don't think it actually proves your point  If the debacle that was McFuckface was so bad that it prompted bringing in Elway . . . that's neat and all, but it doesn't make hiring McDaniels a good decision  Yes, there is a chain of events stemming from this trade to the very good situation we are in now.  But just because an event is a link in a chain with a good ending does not prove that that event was good itself  We can be glad that events worked out that way, but we don't have to pretend that every decision was a good one just because they got us to a good place"
DenverBroncos,3d07mh,BingBongtheArcher19,1 point,Sun Jul 12 17:08:09 2015 UTC,"I agree if you are judging that trade at that time, but I think that in order to answer ""What do Broncos fans think of the Cutler trade now?"" you have to consider all of the subsequent events stemming from that.  Yes, at the time, there was no way to consider all of that, but with the benefit of hindsight, I am personally happy with the trade.   Would I do that trade again if it meant we get to this exact moment? Yes, definitely. But, I fully recognize it's all Butterfly Effect and all that and that the trade itself was a terrible move at the time, but it turned out pretty well for us over the long run in hindsight.  Also, I just hate Cutler for: ""It's a lot (different). Denver's like a 6 and Chicago's like a 9. It's a quite bit different. Just the fans and how passionate they are, that's probably the biggest difference."" Fuck him forever. McDaniels too.

Him being able to get Manning, plus some good drafts and FA pick ups is a big reason why we're Super Bowl contenders.   I don't think we could get to this level with Cutler, but McDouchebag made some really stupid draft picks and pissed away anything good we could have gotten from trading away our good players."

Tebow vs Hou, NYJ, Chi, and the Steelers playoff win. McD did some really impressive things here and I'm still glad he came in here and got rid of all the losers. None of the guys he got rid of have won any championships anywhere else have they?

DenverBroncos,3d07mh,BingBongtheArcher19,2,Sun Jul 12 14:57:30 2015 UTC,"Arguably Eric Decker? How could you possibly argue that Decker is a bad player or a bad pick? He's a serviceable #1 receiver and a top tier #2. On top of that you have Demaryius who's elite, Ayers who's been very good his entire career, Moreno who unfortunately turned out injury prone but was a stud otherwise. Beadles did great things for us and Bruton has been a consistent contributor. Sure he whiffed bad on guys like Quinn and Alphonso Smith, I won't deny that, plus Tebow was definitely a reach even though I like him as a player. He also got production out of some bargain free agents like Lloyd, Gaffney, Vonnie Holiday, etc.  Look, obviously we were a bad team under his tenure, but we gave him less than 2 years. I think people forget how bad of a position Shanahan left us in. We had an all-time bad defense and a crumbling offensive line and were going nowhere fast. McDaniels blew the whole thing up and we went through some rebuilding pains. The core he put together in two offseasons was a big part of the team that went to the Superbowl a few years later. All I'm saying is that if he had gotten a couple more years to develop his team we would have been much better than the 11-19 record he posted."

He's going to really shape and use this defense properly. The management of players will be better, and yes we will use Ray a lot to spell Ware.

DenverBroncos,3czk6i,PMeist,1 point,Sun Jul 12 06:11:36 2015 UTC,Idk Monte Ball was getting some 1st team reps rencetly. I think Kubiak is willing to let Ball prove himself. Every year its someone new in the Broncos Backfield with Peyton at the helm.
DenverBroncos,3czk6i,Sherman25,1 point,Sun Jul 12 22:02:54 2015 UTC,It got reported that CJ would be the RB1 going into the training camp I thought.  sounded like he made a pretty good impression during the OTAs and kubiak as much said it's his position to lose  Edit: it might have been an Anderson being 1a and Ball being 1b upon further reflection.
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,flynryan692,37,Sat Jul 11 13:58:59 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely no intention of seeing Self/Less with Reynolds.  BUT.  BUT.  If they made that movie about Peyton Fookin Manning transplanting his brain into Brocks rock-hard crustacean body I would watch the FUCK out of that movie.   Edit: (nominated for 14 Academy Awards, including 'Best Supporting Lobster in a dramatic role')"
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,PMeist,8,Sat Jul 11 14:33:32 2015 UTC,"Brock really has an amazing opportunity. With his skill, and Manning showing him how to channel it, Brock could easily be one of the elite. As much as I will miss Manning, I am also excited for the crustaceous period."
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,chrispy_bacon,2,Sat Jul 11 15:40:37 2015 UTC,I'm not so much worried about Brock soaking up the experience as I am about whether Peyton has been actively teaching him. He's not really known for mentoring his backups.   Do we know whether he's been actually working with Brock or is Brock stuck with just observing?
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,__KODY__,5,Sat Jul 11 19:20:50 2015 UTC,"I don't know how much Peyton is actually teaching Brock, but Peyton never really had a successor in Indy. The guys behind him were just there to hand the ball off if Peyton wasn't playing. Also, Peyton allegedly told Elway to draft a successor because he didn't want Denver to end up screwed like Indy. I guess Manning had a few doubts about whether he could actually recover from his injury."
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,mysterious_pube,2,Sat Jul 11 20:01:18 2015 UTC,"Thanks, /u/Mysterious_pube"
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,thelizahhhdking,1 point,Sat Jul 11 21:39:35 2015 UTC,"Peyton didn't have a successor because there was no reason to have one in place yet. When you have an otherworldy elite QB you only need a serviceable back up year after year.   When Manning's injury happened they had to scramble to find a serviceable starter and see what happened with PFM. Obviously they thought it was best to cut ties with him and let him see what he can do. But they never went into any draft's really trying to find the next big piece QB.   Plus when his injury happened he missed a whole season, then came back and has played 3 seasons with us with this being his 4th. That's 4 total seasons (this being his 5th) since his injury so obviously Indy believed that he had several years left to wait and find a QB in the draft. Towards the end of his career.  And who knows, maybe he would have retired already if his neck injury never happened and he kept playing in Indy. Maybe, maybe not. But in any event he had 3 years minimum left in Indy which was plenty of time to find someone new. No need for a successor there.  However I absolutely believe that Peyton would advise Elway to draft a new QB and develop him. Hopefully it turns into a Favre/Rodgers situation. But Manning having a few doubts about recovering back then probably didn't matter to him, he had a contract with a lot of guaranteed money."
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,PMeist,2,Sat Jul 11 22:03:11 2015 UTC,"He had Curtis Painter behind him. Curtis Painter, let that sink in for a minute."
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,Uglybass,2,Sat Jul 11 22:25:48 2015 UTC,"It's not like Peyton was expecting to leave any time soon, why would anyone ask him to mentor Painter like the Broncos are asking him to mentor Brock"
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,Bilyman,0,Sun Jul 12 08:56:10 2015 UTC,Because it's football and one hit can end your career and it's next man up after that. And that's exactly what happened... except for the ending career part.
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,Fridden,2,Sun Jul 12 19:44:18 2015 UTC,"I remember some interview where Brock said he is in fact teaching him, so I assume so. I imagine it may be different now for Peyton since he's retiring soon and Denver took a chance on him. I could be wrong though."
DenverBroncos,3cwv7l,__KODY__,2,Sat Jul 11 22:32:55 2015 UTC,"I'm hoping so. I'm not worried about Brock's devotion. Just look at every shot of him on the sideline. Nose in the books, or right over Peyton's shoulder at all times..."

DenverBroncos,3cus3t,rutterb0,2,Fri Jul 10 23:38:28 2015 UTC,"Says the media. We have no idea how much of that is true.  And if he wants to get as much as he can, he should because hes in the position to do so.  Hopefully we can find a way for him to stay but it seems like people around here are don't even want to try and get a deal done."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,licoriceallsorts,6,Fri Jul 10 23:41:54 2015 UTC,"We know exactly how much that is true. Look at the Super Bowl, none of the WRs were of DT's caliber, and probably only Julian Edelman was of Emmanuel Sanders' caliber. We are transitioning to a run first offense, paying DT 16M is not acceptable, especially when it means we may miss out on other studs that we need to re-sign"
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,Richa5280,4,Sat Jul 11 03:20:45 2015 UTC,"I believe he meant we don't know about the contract demands being true. I agree though, with all the other places we can spent this money, we can't afford to give DT Megatron money. Not only that but we don't need to."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,rutterb0,3,Sat Jul 11 18:40:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, thats what I meant.  I haven't seen a source that says he actually said that.  And even if he did, its probably a negotiating tactic.  Thats not the deal he would actually get"

DenverBroncos,3cus3t,United_In_Orange,11,Sat Jul 11 21:13:38 2015 UTC,"I think most fans always start seeing players in a more negative light when players exploit the business side of the system. They all want they players to give every appearance of their team's needs being put first and pure loyalty. They want to see talks of ""hometown discounts"" and players showing up for all voluntary activities because the player is all about winning games for their team. That's just not reality though.   So yeah I think a lot of our fans are getting a bit down on DT not just because we may not have him in 2016 but also because they don't see him showing the commitment to the Broncos they want."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,Samcrates,4,Sat Jul 11 01:32:37 2015 UTC,Great perspective! Now that's how you add to the conversation.
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,indyxetan,2,Sat Jul 11 02:35:35 2015 UTC,"I disagree.  Chris Harris clearly showed loyalty to the organization that gave him success and is taking a discount given how elite he is.  He was influenced to do that by Pot Roast (who told him the value of a winning organization); Pot Roast was also willing to play in Denver for peanuts had we wanted him.    DT should be paid...but paid in line with his true performance and market value (not a top 1 receiver).  If he wants to milk an organization for way more than he's worth, I prefer it be another one.  THAT's business reality."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,flynryan692,2,Sat Jul 11 15:10:05 2015 UTC,That's great and all...but we're talking MILLIONS of dollars here.  Don't forget this is his job. Why wouldn't he try to get as big of a raise as possible...to keep fans happy?
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,indyxetan,8,Sat Jul 11 16:25:48 2015 UTC,Remember when he said he would give Denver a hometown discount? Asking to be the highest paid receiver in the league isn't taking a hometown discount.

DenverBroncos,3cus3t,mysterious_pube,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:25:22 2015 UTC,Well something isn't right here. He seemed genuine when he said that so why would he change? Did Elway say something that pissed him off? Did his manager convince him he needs to get top money? Something seems wrong here...
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,Fridden,1 point,Sat Jul 11 16:09:58 2015 UTC,"Agents are all about money. His agent will do whatever he needs to get his client paid, which gets himself paid in the process.   DT wants to be a Bronco I would imagine, but his agent has convinced him (probably rightfully so) that he deserves top receiver money and so he is going to get just that."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,Fridden,3,Sat Jul 11 21:43:49 2015 UTC,"I imagine some do, but I think it's mostly fans coming back down to earth. When things are going well, people focus on the positive. Now that DT is in a contract year, though, fans are taking a harder look at him to determine his actual value to the team. Nearly everyone acknowledges he's one of the best in the game, but many don't think he (or any receiver except maybe Calvin) is worth what he's asking. Personally, I think WRs are the most overpaid, overvalued players in the NFL, and I wouldn't want to pay DT 16 mil a year even if I considered him the best in the league. That doesn't mean I don't want him on the team, though."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,kdogg87,1 point,Fri Jul 10 23:38:07 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  Idk how much of the 16M is real or if its fabricated by the media.  If he wants that much, we should think about saying our goodbyes.  But hes an amazing talent and people are focusing on the one bad playoff game to say that we don't need him.  However with an unproven QB, he could be a huge benefit."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,skullyD,3,Fri Jul 10 23:57:04 2015 UTC,Yes and no. With his attitude I think it has pissed a lot of people off. He wants to be paid like the best WR in the NFL and not a dollar less when he's not even a top 5 WR.
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,skullyD,1 point,Sun Jul 12 04:19:20 2015 UTC,"Why is that a bad thing? That's his career, he doesn't owe the Broncos anything. And you don't think k so? Who do you have above DT?"
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,SALTY_BALLZ,1 point,Sun Jul 12 20:43:54 2015 UTC,"Megatron, Antonio Brown, Dez, Aj Green, Julio Jones are my top 5. I think DT comes in around  6-8. I'm not saying he owes us a thing, but we don't have to pay him either. He is looking for Megatron money, who is by far the best WR in the nfl today. Even when he signed that contract for him people were saying that was too much. He can ask for it but that doesn't mean he deserves it, or will get it."
DenverBroncos,3cus3t,MasonL52,1 point,Sun Jul 12 21:49:32 2015 UTC,"I would agree with that but I have DT coming in at 5, AJ Green at 6. And that's not how contracts work.

DenverBroncos,3cus3t,TheWastedYearz,2,Sat Jul 11 01:31:36 2015 UTC,"I do haha. I think were getting ready to rid ourselves of some of the expensive FA's we've acquired.  Talib has little dead money after this year and if Roby steps up, I could see them letting him go.  Not sure how much dead money is tied in in Ware, but I could see them letting him go if Shane Ray performs.  There are going to have to be sacrifices made, but there will be a lot of transformation to this team.  No one thought we were gonna lose Franklin, Moore, JT, Irving, Potroast and Tamme before last off season. I think DT could be a staple of our offense and I really hope we find a way to keep him."

I hope we can find a way to keep DT as well, I just hope we don't break the bank. Hopefully DT and co. are just asking for Megatron money to start negotations high as both parties can discuss a proper contract.

You could just as easily write an article saying ""which team's fanbase is comprised of the biggest suckers"" and cast the difference between actual and expected revenues as one of dumb fans being willing to pay more than tickets are worth.

DenverBroncos,3cuoh5,AnotherCaucasian,2,Mon Jul 13 14:55:49 2015 UTC,"Just going by how they constructed their model, though, this seems about right to me.  Does anyone remember the middling Shannahan years followed by McD?  The rabidness was dying down bit by bit, and the stadium was an embarrassment:  golf claps or no-shows in the club section, too many empty seats or useless fans (I actually watched a family of four come in to the game in the 2Q, seem totally perplexed when people around them cheered loudly, then leave at the end of the 3Q).  I would love to see what those numbers look like on a year to year graph.    Incidentally, how you know this article is trash, besides where Denver is at:  The Pittsburgh Steelers are behind us at #14.  I don't want to get into who is the ""best"" fanbase, but those people sell out their own stadium, and like 1/10th to 1/3rd of everyone else's, and they're behind the Houston Texans?"

Not to mention how quiet their fans are, mainly because the crazy prices drive away most of their more loyal and hardcore fans. Not saying our tickets are cheap, but it's ridiculous what they pay over there.  Stupid list."

He's a great player, but like I said I think we can thrive still even without him.   If you take Von out of the game you can definitely feel a presence being missed. His elite presence and overall defensive skill set are way more impactful than DT."
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,ktsmyth,3,Fri Jul 10 17:30:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I would rather have Von than DT but if you think he doesn't change the game, then Idk what games you are watching.  I mean, look at when we played the Seahawks in Seattle last year.  I still remember how crazy that 2 point conversion was."
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,skullyD,0,Fri Jul 10 22:05:26 2015 UTC,"I never said he flat out wasn't a game changing player. All I said was, if you took DT out of a game there would only be a mild change, nothing extraordinary.   Compare Dez Bryant and DT. Dez is wayyyy more clutch and imo is arguably better than Calvin Johnson right now. Dez Bryant is a glorified game changer.  We picked up Emmanuel for cheap and now look how he's turned out? Of course you can argue Peyton has made him better, but I don't think you can teach those athletic circus catches and crazy leaps Emmanuel does.   My point is that nowadays, WRs are becoming much more replaceable, and that includes DT. We have too many holes to fill to be spending big money on a WR. Throw that money to von, Danny t, Fucking Malik Jackson, Derek Wolfe, Cj Anderson, etc."
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,3,Fri Jul 10 22:48:06 2015 UTC,"No, thats not what you said.  You literally said, ""If you took DT out of the game I don't think there would be much of a game changing difference"".  I'm not saying DT is better than Dez.  To me they are good at different things, but regardless, both top 5.  Emmanuel was a beast last year but he creates a different type of mismatch.  Having a receiver of DT's size, quickness and speed is ridiculous.  He's put up over 3000 yards and 25 TD's over the past 2 seasons, how is that not game changing?"
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,skullyD,-1,Fri Jul 10 00:46:44 2015 UTC,"No, thats not what you said. You literally said, ""If you took DT out of the game I don't think there would be much of a game changing difference"".   Yeah...? That's the same as saying there would only be a mild change felt. Next.   I'm not saying DT is better than Dez. To me they are good at different things, but regardless, both top 5.   Fair enough.   Emmanuel was a beast last year but he creates a different type of mismatch.    Just because he creates a different type of matchup doesn't make it any different on the fact of his crazy circus catch ability.    Having a receiver of DT's size, quickness and speed is ridiculous. He's put up over 3000 yards and 25 TD's over the past 2 seasons, how is that not game changing?   Because Decker, Julius, and Sanders have all had similar success while here. Peyton factor is real of course, but when you pass the ball nearly 50 times a game with one of the greatest QBs of all time of course you can look at stats all day everyday claiming he's a great player, he'll have more chances to makes plays than others. Also considering the fact we have another DT-like WR in Latimer waiting on the bench, we'll see how he can do this season. If he does well I think DT takes a walk out of here.  But look, I respect your opinion and refuse to downvote your comments because I disagree. Long story short, I think DT is expendable and we should use the money elsewhere. You can downvote me all you want I don't really care lol.  I will agree to disagree."
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,PMeist,0,Fri Jul 10 01:48:27 2015 UTC,"Look at our playoff loss against indy when DT was completely out of the game and you'll see how bad our passing offence was without his presence. People don't see the fact that without him, sanders would be facing way tougher coverage and would be a lot less effective, like a lot less. I think the fans as a whole have a bad taste in their mouths from the playoffs but nobody was saying he wasn't a game changer after 8 straight 100 yard games and tearing up the league all year."
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,GetGhettoBlasted,1 point,Fri Jul 10 02:17:08 2015 UTC,"Our passing offense wasn't bad in that game due to the lack of Demaryius Thomas involvement, it was because Peyton was injured/sucking and the coaching staff being fucktards.  During that game, DT was the lone touchdown we scored. So no, he wasn't ""taken out of the game"" like you said. Before you say ""See!! He is a game changer because he scored the only touchdown!!"" hold the phone.  It comes down to simple probability, the only reason we scored a passing TD was because Peyton and Gase kept forcing a passing play almost every down, while we had one of the hottest running backs going into the playoffs. Peyton had 46 attempts, of course one of them was bound to be a TD. Also, Vontae Davis has the better end of Demaryius most of the game.  You guys can crucify me all you want, but at the end of the day I still don't want us to throw big money at DT. Throw that money to the defense."
DenverBroncos,3cpjip,DSPR,2,Fri Jul 10 02:42:42 2015 UTC,"Well as an organization it might be time (next year obviously) to let Brock take the reigns and have him throwing to Latimer as his #1. Sanders is an awesome #2 btw.   And don't forget, that once Peyton is gone our offense will be smash-mouth run first. We won't need a mega-weapon in DT. Plus we need to resign CJ Anderson at the end of the season."

DenverBroncos,3cqsea,mrdenver,9,Fri Jul 10 03:07:54 2015 UTC,I was so confused. 38 seconds is an eternity for Manning In that situation.
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,aljds,9,Fri Jul 10 02:13:09 2015 UTC,"Excluding the kneel down, In the second half and overtime, the Broncos had 7 drives. They had more turnovers (2), than they did drives where they gained more than 40 yards (1).  The Broncos offense wasn't clicking in that game.  Also, keep in mind Prater was having an off night, having already missed a 52 yard FG.    If it's me, I go for it and give it a shot.  But it seems unlikely the Broncos drive down and score.  And it doesn't seem too far off, that with the whole team in shock and all the momentum/energy with the Ravens, that they pick off some tipped pass and win the game.    People use those two plays as excuses for how badly the Broncos played in that game.  No reason the Broncos should have let them hang around.    Besides the Moore play, if I get a do-over in that game, I'd pick one in OT.  After a 55 Yard punt by Colquitt that's pinned at the 6, and a delay of game penalty, the Ravens faced 3rd and 13 from their own 3.  If we stop them here, the Ravens will be punting from the backline of the endzone to Holiday, and we'll get the ball on the edge of FG range.  Instead, Flacco somehow got off a 24 yard completion off his back foot to his TE.  We go on to trade punts until Manning throws the pick and sets them up for the GW."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,AlpineSummit,2,Fri Jul 10 05:56:53 2015 UTC,"No reason the Broncos should have let them hang around.   Our offense and defense was terrible that whole game. We were only in the game because of Trindon's returns anyway. We shouldn't have let them hang around.  If I had one play over though, I would wish Prater made that field goal instead of kicking the ground. With those extra three points, everything that happened at the end could have still happened and wouldn't have mattered at all!"
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,aljds,1 point,Fri Jul 10 18:21:31 2015 UTC,"Yep, exactly.  We make the FG and we go in the half up 10 instead of tied.  After Holidays return we would have been up 17 points.

In part due to Manning's injury Mile High Miracle Manny snapping the ball over Manning's head.

DenverBroncos,3cqsea,bhopppp,4,Fri Jul 10 06:12:38 2015 UTC,"2005 was our year. We could have been champions of the ""Nipple Bowl"". Also, don't forget the fumble we got fucked out of that game."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,FatBeardBrown,2,Fri Jul 10 17:03:04 2015 UTC,"Yes!  We might not have won, but that game would have been radically different with that 14-point swing.    That has to make my list now.  Funny, as much as I love Champ, he's the only one on my list with two plays I'd change."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Fri Jul 10 07:19:36 2015 UTC,This is the answer. 2005 was a great year for us. If we had advanced we would have 3 Lombardis right now.
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Big_Pete1999,9,Fri Jul 10 19:01:45 2015 UTC,Manny Ramierez snap to open the superbowl
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,waspocracy,9,Fri Jul 10 21:25:00 2015 UTC,This thread makes me sad.
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,frrrunkis,7,Fri Jul 10 02:27:43 2015 UTC,Vic Lombardi did his top 5 list on the radio about an hour ago...  There are quite a few.  He listed: Michael Dean Perry walking off the field in the 1996 Jacksonville playoff loss  Griese throwing interception that essentially ended Terrell Davis' career.  ManRam snapping ball over Peyton's head first play of super bowl  Dan Reeves running 3 straight times at goal line in Broncos super bowl against Giants instead of letting Elway (in his early prime) try to score. We were winning the game and then that happened and Karlis missed FG attempt. Then Giants ripped off 23 straight points or something like that.   And the Flacco fluky play that ended our 2012 playoffs and arguably the Broncos best chance at actually winning a super bowl in the last 15 years  Edit: For Dan Reeves' play calling clarification
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Big_Pete1999,5,Fri Jul 10 02:38:35 2015 UTC,That's a very solid list. Nice to see he didn't just pick plays from the last 5-10 years.
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Colorado222,3,Fri Jul 10 14:26:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I was glad he had the Giants super bowl in there. What I immediately thought of for my list was TD getting hurt running down the Griese interception, the Flacco play (Rahim Moore), and Michael Dean Perry walking off the field.  I still reference Perry walking off the field every year in some form or fashion once football season starts amping up. So gut wrenching."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,AlpineSummit,3,Fri Jul 10 14:46:18 2015 UTC,"This list is solid. The ManRam snapping the ball over Petyon's head has a good contender too: The opening kickoff of the second half of the same game.  I thought we had a chance to at least make it reasonable, but that kickoff shut that out pretty quickly. I mean, earlier in the season (or the season prior) we were behind the Chargers 24-0 and won that game. So why not this one?"
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,waspocracy,3,Fri Jul 10 15:12:19 2015 UTC,Chargers epic comeback was week 6 (I think) in 2012. Start of our 11 game winning streak. Sigh... That really was our year.
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Big_Pete1999,2,Fri Jul 10 18:02:47 2015 UTC,"Agreed.  Coming out at the half, I was all ""we still got this. We can rip off a shit ton of points easily""... then that return happened and I proceeded to drink till I forgot about the game. haha"
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,The_Super_Deer,1 point,Fri Jul 10 19:41:01 2015 UTC,Seriously so much alcohol that during that game.
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Big_Pete1999,2,Fri Jul 10 19:36:51 2015 UTC,"I was listening to that this morning too, and I came up with my own list. I ended up with all the same plays as Vic did except the ones in the Giants superbowl.  Instead, I chose the Sewell fumble in the 1992 AFC Championship game vs. Buffalo.  Elway got injured and Kubiak came in to replace him and led the Broncos on their only scoring drive of the game to make the game 10-7 late in the 4th quarter. Steve Atwater recovered the onsides kick at mid-field with a minute and a half left in the game. On the very next play Sewell fumbled and Buffalo recovered it. We forced them to punt, but got the ball back with only 17 seconds, poor field position and didn't have enough time to make anything happen. Buffalo goes on to lose the Superbowl to Washington.  We could have had a re-match with Washington in the Superbowl - likely with Kubiak as our starting QB because of Elway's injury. Instead that was Kubiak's last game before retiring and going into coaching."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,The_Super_Deer,3,Fri Jul 10 20:26:03 2015 UTC,Buffalo goes on to lose the Superbowl to Washington.   They're consistent at losing in the Superbowl
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,hotlava1,3,Fri Jul 10 17:09:55 2015 UTC,"Man, that game made me sick to my stomach!"
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,ChickenParm18,2,Fri Jul 10 18:07:26 2015 UTC,Idk i feel like the Broncos best chance at winning was when they actually made it there. Things couldve happened after the Baltimore game even if wed won
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,bigrobwoot,3,Fri Jul 10 19:37:52 2015 UTC,"I'll respectfully disagree.  I think the 2012 team would have steamrolled our 2013 team. The defense was way better and the offense was equally unstoppable (more balanced).   But hey, its like saying that we would have won 3 in a row had Jacksonville not rained on our parade in 1996 or if Elway didn't retire after 1998. Who knows what would have happened, but we all have our opinions :)"
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Wiegand50,2,Fri Jul 10 19:03:32 2015 UTC,But god damn 2013 had me hyped... Why do we have a record shattering offense and get shit fucked in the Superbowl... WHY
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,waspocracy,4,Fri Jul 10 19:35:53 2015 UTC,Flaccos bomb was only completed because Rahim Moore miss timed his jump. That pass should have been deflected and on to the SB!
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,Wiegand50,6,Fri Jul 10 19:47:09 2015 UTC,"I will never forget that moment Flacco threw that bomb over Rahim Moore. The crowd was going crazy, there was no way we were losing that game. Everything felt right that year. When Jones caught it and ran into the endzone my brain literally (you know you read that in Rob Lowe's voice) did not process what happened. It didn't feel real. Then kneeling the ball. Oh man. I remember feeling physically ill trying to go to bed that night. Everytime from that point on we did player introductions on SNF and I had to hear Rahim the dream Moore I wanted to punt a child. This thread has raised my blood pressure if I went to the doctor right now he'd ask me if everything was alright."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,dusting53,2,Fri Jul 10 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"Moore never should have been in that position.  Fox having Manning kneel with 38 seconds left and two timeouts to go to overtime is just ridiculous.  Prater broke the record for longest field goal a few weeks before that game, You have the ultimate 2-minute drill quarterback running your offense, and you need about 30 yards to get within Prater's range.  Nah, fuck it.  Let's get Flacco back on the field in OT."
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,NegativeGhostwriter,3,Fri Jul 10 05:19:41 2015 UTC,That play in the superbowl.

I still think we would have lost, but not so embarrassingly.    And of course TDs ACL tear.  One of the greatest backs to play the game having his career cut short on that kind of play is just the worst, no matter what team they play for...  Fuck the Raiders"
DenverBroncos,3cqsea,DefenderCone97,2,Fri Jul 10 17:26:43 2015 UTC,"I think we might have had a decent chance.  We had an advantage running the ball, but had to abandon that and play to the Seahawks' strength.  Neither team was equipped to stage a comeback against the other."
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,TheWastedYearz,17,Fri Jul 10 01:56:38 2015 UTC,"The only OLineman in the draft was undersized, had little experience outside of the previous season, and would likely be a camp body for us.   In the short amount of time, I was only able to catch on game on him from YouTube, but he lacked a powerful first punch and his footwork was slack.  And I am sorry if this is going to sound shitty, but...  WHY ARE PEOPLE TREATING OUR 2015 OLINE LIKE WE DID OUR 2014 RB SITUATION??? EVERY RB ON THE MARKET LAST YEAR WAS COVETED BY US, WE STOOD PAT WITH THE GROUP WE HAD, AND WE DID FINE.  TRUST. THE FUCKING. SYSTEM."
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,Mister_Jay_Peg,4,Fri Jul 10 02:14:59 2015 UTC,Are you telling us to stop thinking we need help on the OLine if the coaches and management clearly don't think it's a need if they continue not to address it? ...What am I supposed to freak out about then?? /s

Plus it requires all linemen to be more quick and athletic."
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,kgxv,8,Sat Jul 11 03:12:26 2015 UTC,Subliminal draft?

DenverBroncos,3cqzef,NegativeGhostwriter,7,Fri Jul 10 19:43:48 2015 UTC,He sounds like trouble. I might have dropped a 5th but 1-4 seems like high value on a high risk player. I do wish Denver would have risked one of their 3 7ths in the regular draft on La'el Collins.
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,badcompany1981,2,Fri Jul 10 02:13:43 2015 UTC,"He and his agent were pretty adamant about not signing if drafted.  I would have loved him, but who knows."
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Fri Jul 10 04:28:09 2015 UTC,I know but in this case his options would have been play in Denver with a good chance at starting on a playoff team/ championship contender or sit out for a year. In the the worse case Denver is out one of the 3 7th rounders.
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,badcompany1981,2,Fri Jul 10 11:40:19 2015 UTC,"Yeah but the 7th round status affects his paycheck. And don't forget, EVERY NFL team passed him up in every round, not just the Broncos."
DenverBroncos,3cqzef,Greeney494,1 point,Fri Jul 10 16:17:42 2015 UTC,No I agree and see why everyone passed on him. I would probably have too but we did have a lot of 7th rounders and late ones at that.

As well as more consistent (over a longer set of years). The Raiders overall win percentage is slightly better simply due a dominance in a ten year period. Which seems to skew the results.

For starters, it is very apparent when Manning joined the team. I also found it interesting how the Broncos and Raiders are basically inverses of one another.   As a fan in his 20s, I am not too knowledgable on the early history of the Broncos. Its apparent we were bad for a long time, but what exactly changed in the early to mid 70s that set us on the right path?"

Denver has two 1,400+ receivers, that's better than any other team. If any team loses their top two receivers, they're screwed. There's not really much you can do about it. Still have Latimer too, who was a 1st rounder in 2014. Having two, proven 1,400 yard receivers and a high potential 2nd year player is better than 90% of the teams in the league."

DenverBroncos,3covh7,Greeney494,4,Thu Jul 9 17:16:39 2015 UTC,"I mean if one of Sanders, DT, or Latimer go down, 2 out of those 3 guys are still pretty good. And it's not like Welker was an incredible threat last year.  And by the way we're running a TON of tight end sets, and we also have a TON of tight ends.  I don't think we should be terribly worried, considering what Kubiak did offesnively with mainly just Andre Johnson in Houston, and Steve Smith and Torrey Smith in Baltimore. I'm guessing not many of us could name the Ravens/Texans 3rd and 4th receivers while Kubiak was there."

The reality is, we have 2 proven awesome receivers, 1 that should be able to come in as an awesome 3rd option, and good depth behind them that still needs to be figured out in camp, since we have so much talent and we need to whittle it down.    Also, they'll be running in ""bigger"" sets more often, with more tight ends, where they also have plenty of depth."

Also, like I said in my last post, I'm also not worried about it, because there will be less 3 and 4 WR formations moving forward.  Even if they are used, Virgil or Daniels can be one of them, like we used JT for the past couple of seasons.

DenverBroncos,3cmfxw,Puffy_Ghost,16,Thu Jul 9 03:02:32 2015 UTC,I disagree with that. A lot of his records he is wearing orange and blue. He has also really established himself as a solid pizza entrepreneur here in CO. I don't see him moving back to Indy.
DenverBroncos,3cmfxw,CryBerry,2,Thu Jul 9 03:51:18 2015 UTC,Having visited both the Denver area and Indy...There's no comparison.  Denver is a much nicer place to live and there's much more to do.    And legal weed.    But Peyton lives in New Orleans.

DenverBroncos,3ck25m,rockymountainoysters,2,Wed Jul 8 19:17:24 2015 UTC,"I'm from Nevada and can probably explain why.  I'm sure the jersey would change year to year because people here cheer for football because they bet on it.  So if this was for last year, and the Colts in the AFC championship were the ones who would have more favorable odds for a gamble I'm sure everyone grabbed a Luck jersey, for what you said, Luck.  Next year it's probably be whatever team that ended up in the playoffs with good betting odds.  I do enjoy watching football at a sports book because they have all the games on, and usually drink specials but damn it's annoying being around a bunch of people cheering for their bets, not the game."

Also, out on the plains a lingering spatter of Vikings fans.  Also, there is some rabid anti-Bronco hate going on up there.

DenverBroncos,3ckmmv,Colorado222,2,Wed Jul 8 19:06:52 2015 UTC,I always wonder if it's that there are THAT many people trying to get tickets or if there are bots involved or something. I don't think I'll ever be able to just give ~$75+ a ticket (+ $6/beer) away to see a game from level 3 when I can spend half the price at a bar. I love the Broncos so much but feel slighted at the cost to attend a game.
DenverBroncos,3ckmmv,irieCO,4,Wed Jul 8 18:48:43 2015 UTC,Bots.  I bet 99% of those tickets are back up on Stubhub or what not at 50 times face value.

DenverBroncos,3clgeq,Weatherstation,2,Wed Jul 8 20:48:12 2015 UTC,"edit: http://i.imgur.com/hKbJ72r.png  Interesting note from the article:   A Week 8 Sunday Night Football meeting with the Green Bay Packers is currently the most expensive game on the secondary market during the 2015 NFL season. The current average is $821.28 with a get-in price of $318.  Four weeks later the Broncos will play another Sunday Night Football game, this time against the defending Super Bowl champion and Manning’s nemesis New England Patriots. That game is the second most expensive overall in the NFL, with an average of $621.53 and a get-in price of $224."
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,wonderfunk99,1 point,Wed Jul 8 20:49:12 2015 UTC,As a Green Bay Packers fan who ended up buying on the secondary market today I can attest that this game is very pricey. I did snag two tickets in section 129 for just under $550/per after fees.
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,StockmanBaxter,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:44:04 2015 UTC,"Ugh. We were hoping to travel down to Denver for our first NFL game in a stadium besides Lambeau. I don't think that will happen now. It is just too pricey.   I hope the prices drop by the time the game comes around, but I doubt they will."
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,I_Call_It_Vera,2,Thu Jul 9 14:51:05 2015 UTC,"If you wait until the day before or the day of a game, the prices tend to be a lot lower.  If you're traveling from out of state that might not be an option to gamble on getting a cheap ticket, but as tickets remain unsold on Stubhub and Ticket Exchange, the price drops quickly.  People realize that getting something for their ticket is better than getting literally nothing after the game starts.  Last year I bought Colts playoff tickets about three hours before the game for $5 over face value."
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,dusting53,2,Thu Jul 9 15:18:23 2015 UTC,"rather be paying expensive tickets than cutler/orton era prices... but even the, its not like broncos tickets are cheap compared to the majority of other franchises."
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,Greeney494,1 point,Thu Jul 9 02:52:38 2015 UTC,"As proud as I am about having the longest home sell out streak in the league, I think it's hurting fans in two ways. 1. It's obviously jacking up the prices because it's clear, Broncos fans want to go to games, no matter what cost, but that leads to 2. If they keep jacking prices up, there will be a breaking point, which could cause us to lose our home sell out streak."
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,Hurry_Hurry,3,Wed Jul 8 22:14:07 2015 UTC,Most probably want to see Manning before he retires. That's the price you are paying for these tickets from here on out.  Once Brock takes over they'll slide back down a bit.
DenverBroncos,3clgeq,bullet_sponge,2,Wed Jul 8 22:40:55 2015 UTC,"Supply and Demand.  They know they can raise prices and people will pay it.  They have a waiting list of thousands of people.  I am a season ticket holder, and they have raised my prices 3 of the last 4 years.  I dont like it - but I pay it.  No other option.  Pay it or lose tickets that we have had for years and years."

Eventually people will start staying home and they will come back to reality.  But it won't happen over night. Like others said. Winning team with a future hall of fame qb. People are willing to go just to see him.  I went to see Brett Favre in Tampa and I'm not a fan of either team."

However, all the games I've been to have been in Oakland, SF, or San Diego.  The last one I went to was the awesome Monday night comeback in San Diego, and I think I remember getting those tickets a week or two before the game, and they weren't much higher than face value.  I didn't have the balls to wait any longer than that, though, because I was already noticing the options dwindling.    I'm planning on the same strategy this year, because I've never been to a Broncos game in Denver, and I'd love to see Peyton Manning beat Tom Brady in Denver in what may be his last year, and my first Broncos game in Denver."

DenverBroncos,3ckhe4,bigrobwoot,3,Wed Jul 8 23:00:29 2015 UTC,Yeah im with you there. My section is behind the endzone opposite the scoreboard. The tickets behind the bench were about 600 when i was buying but didnt want to spend that much; itll be my first game at the mile high so im just excited to go. Its the chiefs game.  Wanted to get the raiders game but its in december and im making it a trip with the girlfrend for a few days so its better to get the warmer weather.

DenverBroncos,3cl0zh,Colorado222,10,Wed Jul 8 19:02:43 2015 UTC,"I think Manning walks after this season. Might come back if we win the Super Bowl just so he can finish his deal and try for two in a row.   But in all honesty, I want Von Miller in a long-term deal before Demaryius Thomas. Defensive players like Von are harder to come by. Whatever happens this year, there just has to be enough money left next year to make sure that #58 stays in Denver for a while.  EDIT: I didn't even answer your question, I'd rather we let DT walk just because after Manning leaves (maybe next year) we would have enough money to re-sign what the guys we need and then maybe add a guy or two in free agency."

As far as Manning I have never been a huge fan even before he signed with us. He's been in the NFL for 18 years, 9 times his team didn't win a single playoff game.   I know I will get downvoted for this because as soon as you even look at Manning wrong Broncos fans go bat shit crazy. Though it really doesn't matter by the end of the season because I think this is his last year no matter what."
DenverBroncos,3cl0zh,Fridden,1 point,Thu Jul 9 06:24:35 2015 UTC,"think proper criticism of Manning is that a large portion of the salary cap is risked on one player whose age and immobility make injury increasingly likely.    Holding the QB solely responsible for wins and losses, especially in the playoffs, is almost as dumb as crediting the color of the jerseys."
DenverBroncos,3cl0zh,NegativeGhostwriter,3,Fri Jul 10 19:17:17 2015 UTC,"We gotta keep DT if we can. When Brock takes over, Denver will need as many weapons for him to lean on as possible in his first few seasons, I know I'm not saying anything new but it's true."

DenverBroncos,3cl0zh,BarryRoyal,2,Wed Jul 8 19:31:00 2015 UTC,In my opinion Manning is either retiring or we cut him. We don't have Manning here next year and we let DT walk. This sures up Von Miller's long term deal. Resigns Brock. Then fills all the holes we have in free agency next year. We're going to have a ton of FA's next year and we will need every dollar.
DenverBroncos,3cl0zh,PMeist,2,Wed Jul 8 22:06:51 2015 UTC,Keep DT long term for sure.  I think a better would you rather would be Von or DT as they will both be up at the same time and its comparing our best offensive weapon vs our best defensive weapon

DenverBroncos,3cidgp,Sienna_Crush,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:07:42 2015 UTC,"Awesome post. Clear, well explained and I feel like it really helped me learn.  I was curious as to how you think Trevathan and Marshall will do in this scheme particularly against the run. I would imagine that with more emphasis on one gapping and penetrating into the backfield it would put more pressure on the ILBs when the D line doesn't penetrate, as they have to get downhill fast to keep RBs from getting big gains on inside runs. What's your take?"
DenverBroncos,3cidgp,mr_potroast,1 point,Thu Jul 9 08:41:21 2015 UTC,"Some questions for my own personal knowledge of the Broncos this season. This is obviously all in your opinion, but you being a Dlineman gives you an insight few of us have, and it all makes sense. (this wound up being longer than I originally intended, so please feel free to answer as few/many as you like. just a giddy Bronco fan hungry for your insider info. thanks!)  How do you feel about Wolfe being the ""2 Gap"" end? Does he have the skill set to 2 Gap and be effective, as you say ""Wolfe is ideal for backside DE."" What skills is best suited to be this position?   A lot of people worry about Malik's snap count increasing. He wasn't used properly by JDR and was by many accounts our best Dlineman last year. Just based off the eye test he is a pure stud. But what are your thoughts on him being a starter? Obviously if he remains as efficient while handling more downs that will be critical for our success, but do you think he can do that?   Also, you mentioned ""Jackson is perfect for the JJ Watt role, where his job is to just wreck shit up in the backfield. It's the perfect position for him, and I expect his snap count to go from 50% to about 75%."" So my question is, does his job (and that position in general) basically remain the same no matter what play is called? ""Malik, on a run play your job is to get up the field and wreck shit up on the blockers/RB."" ""Malik, on a pass play your job is to get up the field and sack the snot out of the QB.""  Next, I haven't seen you mention Sly much. According to this NFL.com combine scouting report, it compares him to Pot Roast. Calls him a NT which is his position he is switching to. He's been playing DT under JDR right? How does this affect him and our interior pass rush? The article adds that he is a 2 Gapper, so does Wade use that skill set at all, or does he stick to his one gap? Is a lot of our defenses success based on Sly and that NT position? What's his ideal role in the defense, to eat up blockers and stuff the middle of the field?   You mentioned Lerentee McCray, but this was before the draft. No one could have predicted us walking out of that draft with Shane Ray. But what do you expect from McCray now? Von's snap count is likely to be extremely high, so does McCray spell out Ware and Ray? Does he sub in for Danny and Brandon? Or is he a guy that just adds depth right now and can be relied upon?  I'm really sold on Marshall and Trevathan. Marshall quickly became one of my favorite Broncos last year. He played very solid football and always seemed to be around the ball. But what are your thoughts on the depth behind them? I've never seen much out of Johnson I've liked, and I don't really remember Barrow playing much.   And lastly, what do you make of our depth at D-line? If Sly can't cut it at NT does Austin step up and do the job? What can we rely on Antonio Smith to do? Is he just a situational pass rusher or can he turn into a multi down guy?   Again thanks for reading and answering however much you feel like! Go Broncos."
DenverBroncos,3cidgp,PMeist,1 point,Thu Jul 9 11:41:19 2015 UTC,"How do you feel about Wolfe being the ""2 Gap"" end? Does he have the skill set to 2 Gap and be effective, as you say ""Wolfe is ideal for backside DE."" What skills is best suited to be this position?   Wolfe wasn't usually 2 gapping in Denver's 4-3, it's a strength of his. What makes him so good at it is he's long, and extremely strong. Probably one of the strongest players in all of the NFL. When you're two gapping, you gotta engage the OL, play both of the gaps on each side of the blocker, and shed and fill the gap accordingly. It requires instinct and strength above all. The backside DE has to occasionally two gap in the 3-4 Under, which is why it's a good spot for Wolfe.   ""Malik, on a run play your job is to get up the field and wreck shit up on the blockers/RB."" ""Malik, on a pass play your job is to get up the field and sack the snot out of the QB.""   Keep in mind, this is just talking about the base defense. Not going to in-depth into all the nickel formations, where Malik will probably playing everything from NT to a 6/7 technique DE. But in base as a DL you're run first. Against the run players have to be a lot more disciplined, you fly up field and teams will run right by you or you'll lose control of the gap. Malik's job will be to control the C gap, which is between the OT/TE or outside of the OT if there is no TE. No matter what he has to control that gap, whereas if you're just asking a player to pass rush, he has a lot more freedom about the lanes he takes.  I don't see the comparison to Knighton really. William's best position is probably as a 3 technique DT in a penetrating defense, not two gapping. His strength is his quickness off the ball and athleticism, he's better at attacking plays than he is reacting to them. He did a lot of two gapping in Del Rio's defense, which is why I think this defense will be a nice switch for him. In Phillips's defense the NT one gaps primarily, playing to Sylvester's strength. If he doesn't work out, I do like Austin. I think at worst, Austin would be a solid player. Not a game changer, but not a liability. Someone you could stick in there and rely on.  I also do like McCray. My guess, with Ray being drafted, is that he'll continue to back up Von. He's a guy you can put in coverage and hold the edge against the run, whereas Ray/Ware you don't really want in coverage or being a front side run defender. Von and McCray have the skills to be actual linebackers, where Ray and Ware are basically just pass rushers.  For depth behind Marshall/Trevathan I really like Todd Davis, he played nicely as he settled in and he was just an undrafted rookie without any time to learn the defense last year. Johnson is alright as a run defender, not someone you really want as a starter but a nice ST/depth player.  Antonio Smith is definitely a situational pass rusher. He's never been a good run defender, but now he's a liability against it. He's a damn good pass rusher, though."

I hope he signs the Franchise Tag and just plays it out this season with us on the one year deal. After that I hope for the best for him. Because he does deserve that money, just not from us.   He's produced as well or better in some categories than any other WR in the league. He is elite, he does deserve a monster paycheck. He was a great WR even while Tebow was throwing him the ball. His numbers went way up because of Manning, but he's shown he can produce at that level. He could have crumbled and been just awful.   I could see him being nearly as good if he went to the right situation."

He was playing lights out every game up until his injury.   Our team is still stacked with talent, more than most teams in the league."
DenverBroncos,3ckr29,PMeist,1 point,Wed Jul 8 22:10:11 2015 UTC,"Look Manning ONLY threw 39 touchdowns, which was 16 less than the year before. He's OBVIOUSLY diminishing and 39 touchdowns is like league average I think so it's nothing too great. /s"

DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,PMeist,6,Tue Jul 7 21:46:19 2015 UTC,We will and there is no real doubt about it in the FO. Elway knows football and Von's don't just come around everyday. He can be a transcendent great LB for the next decade. DT risks huge drop off once Manning is gone.
DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,gnarsesh,15,Tue Jul 7 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"idk I would be ok paying him that much, brock is going to need weapons whereas peyton can make any receiver look good."

DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,Colorado222,6,Tue Jul 7 18:42:53 2015 UTC,Not sure I can agree with the sentiment that Dez is better than Thomas.
DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,CryBerry,8,Tue Jul 7 21:47:01 2015 UTC,"Dez plays with more heart than DT. They obviously play differently, DT may be a bit better once he gets the ball and acquiring YAC but Dez has better hands and fights for the ball in a way DT won't. This is just my opinion trying to be an objective Broncos fan. That said, I don't think any receiver is worth 16 mil a year, including Dez."
DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,Colorado222,2,Tue Jul 7 21:59:37 2015 UTC,I take that back after reading your reply... I can't recollect a play where Dez gave up on a play... I remember one in particular last year where DT had his hands on his hips...
DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,Fridden,2,Tue Jul 7 22:18:38 2015 UTC,"It's not even debatable. Dez is a top 5 WR, DT falls into 6-10 for me and a hell of a lot others. DT shows lack of heart and just straight up quits on many plays. The play against the Colts shows it clear as day, but it's not like that was the first time he quit on a play."
DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,oscarito_198666,5,Wed Jul 8 02:09:12 2015 UTC,"seriously, look at the WR in the SB last year and tell me he's worth it with a straight face. Love him for what he's done but it just doesn't make sense to spend so much on a WR. I'm still waiting for Megatron to take the Lions deep in the playoffs..."
DenverBroncos,3cfsgu,ljp3,2,Tue Jul 7 19:23:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed, and I have read several articles that state that NFL teams generally feel the same. I also read that DT, absent of the 16 mil/yr and 40 mil guarantee would like to see how Dez plays out in Dallas, then use that as the measure. The Broncos have shown that they put a number on a player and they don't budge much from it."

DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,Cali4nyo,24,Tue Jul 7 19:09:07 2015 UTC,I love DT as much as the next guy but Megatron hasn't put the Lion's in the superbowl and i'm not sure without Peyton that DT puts us in there either. On paper it just doesn't seem like where you want a big chunk of change to go. Read off the list of WR that were in the SB last year and tell me how much value that position holds.
DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,oscarito_198666,7,Tue Jul 7 19:16:32 2015 UTC,"Paying DT top ten QB money seems crazy, but who knows with the salary cap growing as quickly as it is right now, that deal may end up bring very affordable in the long run. Unfortunately you can't expect a guy like DT at the top of the game to take a ""reasonable"" deal because someone will pay him this much. Glad I'm not Elway because choosing between paying DT such a large cut of the team cap or losing him is a tough call to make."

I'm not actually sure about that.  It's been three years since Megatron signed his contract and no WR has come even close to matching it since.  I think it's all going to hinge on what Dez gets (and who knows, maybe the Cowboys are waiting to see what DT gets)."
DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,KimonoThief,12,Tue Jul 7 21:11:32 2015 UTC,"Welp, shit DT.  If you played somewhat decent during that Indy playoff loss, maybe Elway would have shown you the money.  Instead we saw alot of this."
DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,MillerTime58,7,Wed Jul 8 00:57:38 2015 UTC,"I love DT but he is no Megatron.  In addition to your point of him taking plays off, the guy just drops way too many wide open passes to pay him that much."

He is so much fun to watch, but it isn't fair to the team OR to DT if we hold his career here w/o a legit QB at the helm. I have no idea if Brock will be worth a damn, but considering we went through a metric shit load of QB's to go from Elway to Manning, we can't assume he'll be good.   Holding onto DT after Peyton leaves makes him the 2nd coming of Larry Fitz. A top tier WR that never lives up to expectations, because he has no one to throw to him."
DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,bcos4life,1 point,Tue Jul 7 19:33:14 2015 UTC,Yes but I'd rather have talented receivers that can make up for a QB's deficiencies (looking at you Tebow).

DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,crueg,0,Tue Jul 7 23:23:55 2015 UTC,"A 5'11"" speed receiver that drew everyone's second best corner because of DT, a receiver that hasn't been proven yet, a tight end that has promise but has been used as a blocker most of his career, and CJ, another promising player but as of now only a one year wonder. It's a good group, but DT is the best player of any of them, and his loss would be bigger than we're making it out to be, unless Latimer truly lights it up this year."
DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,Greeney494,2,Wed Jul 8 01:00:18 2015 UTC,"Wanting Calvin Johnson money now isn't nearly as bad as getting Calvin Johnson money when Calvin got his contract, the salary cap has expanded since and with his numbers he deserves top WR money, maybe he doesn't get it from Denver but it's likely he gets it elsewhere and I can't fault the dude, his career started with a bunch of injuries and big WR's get beat up pretty bad he needs to get paid. I was almost annoyed Chris Harris didn't take a bigger contract to be perfectly honest, he sold himself really short."
DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,Bradyta,2,Wed Jul 8 06:16:39 2015 UTC,He deserves less than Dez. He drops too many open catches to be paid that much.

DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,Roccos_modern_life,2,Tue Jul 7 23:51:47 2015 UTC,"DT makes A TON of athletic plays. I mean A TON. But you're right he is very soft at times, other times he is the only guy giving effort tho."

DenverBroncos,3cgjv1,skay,4,Tue Jul 7 19:52:48 2015 UTC,"Can't really fault a man for trying to get money while he can. Football careers are short and can end anytime, I got no problem with players seeking more money. It's the sad truth. When you got franchises who won't take care of players, and will demand them to take a pay cut as soon as their production drops, players are gonna be less loyal."

DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,MuthaCluffer,4,Tue Jul 7 21:19:34 2015 UTC,Depends on what you mean by good. To my mind it will be good because A) it's fucking football B) We should win our division and C) We have a talented team and exciting team with a shot at a Super Bowl run.   But if by good you mean Super Bowl victory or bust? Then I would say it's probably going to be bad. I don't think we have a better than 50/50 chance at a SB win. But neither does anyone else! I'm just excited to see how it pans out. Can't fucking wait.
DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,igobychuck,3,Wed Jul 8 00:06:46 2015 UTC,50/50 chance?  That's fucking brilliant chances!
DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,licoriceallsorts,3,Wed Jul 8 07:04:34 2015 UTC,"Talent wise I think we're a bit worse off than last year. But last year Denver really underplayed their talent level. I think if the coaching staff can get Denver to play to their potential, they'll be better than last year despite losing some guys.  This is assuming Peyton's decline last year was mostly due to injury, and he can play more like the beginning of 2014 than the end."
DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,DLBork,5,Wed Jul 8 01:28:13 2015 UTC,"High hopes, and I have a positive outlook. The team looks good, I like our new coaching staff. Peyton is in good form, our Defense is looking amazing. The Offensive scheme will fit our RBs and TEs well. Just need to look at the O-Line choices being made and how those work out.   I think we are going in stronger than last year and I have very good feeling on our outcome."
DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,Fatandmean,4,Tue Jul 7 21:26:51 2015 UTC,"What? Every season is good.   Every Bronco season is even better.   The Broncos have done consistently well for like 20 years with bad season occurring, what, once every 15-20 years? There is no reason we won't win the division and reach the playoffs. A bad year would be if the team disappears."
DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,Colorado222,4,Tue Jul 7 21:32:33 2015 UTC,I foresee an 11-5 season winning the AFC West
DenverBroncos,3ch2lu,recyclops93,2,Tue Jul 7 23:38:15 2015 UTC,"If CJ Anderson keeps playing like he did last year (or ball and hillman step up), Peyton doesn't get hurt or noodle armed and the o-line isn't attrocious,  our offense will continue to be balls to the wall. O-line is the biggest concern but I think they'll be OK.  Defense will play better, I guarantee it. The talent is there and the scheme will fit, it's just a matter of learning it properly in time. The front 7 is very talented, no position outside of possibly NT is weak, but reports are coming out that Sly is doing well so it should be OK. Secondary is loaded as well, I expect a lot of turnovers this season.  The only thing I see holding the Broncos out of a deep playoff run is if injuries get really bad, but nobody has control over that. All in all it should be a better season than last year."

Once you have the seats in your cart, you have 15 minutes to checkout or they go back into the pool.  You can't really hesitate because they go fast. I look to the center portion of the map first because that's where the closest seats are.

DenverBroncos,3cd3us,Homeoftheblizzard,2,Tue Jul 7 21:35:20 2015 UTC,"How you draft is completely dependent on your league settings - size of league, scoring settings, etc.   Generally:  The top tier RB's go very early due to them being in such high demand. It's tough to get reliable RB's where they score a ton of points. Guys like Jamaal Charles, AP, LeSean McCoy, Forte, Bell, etc. They are in very high regard and go early because they can be reliable for a lot of points each week.  After that generally WR is fairly deep. You can find WR2's fairly easily. WR's are the most reliable and consistent. Top tier WR's are more highly sought after than WR2's and harder to find. But you can find 'second-tier' WR's that put up WR1 numbers. I'm talking Alshon Jeffery, Hopkins, Hilton, Torrey Smith, etc. They are pretty good WR's to have.   TE's are in very short supply. The best obviously being the big name TE's in Gronk and Jimmy. Behind them there is very little depth in TE and often people will play the waiver wire for matchups favorable to TE's (also with D/ST). TE is very shallow and hard to come by, if you come across Gronk/Graham in rounds... 3 or 4 and the decision is between them or WR's like Kelvin Benjamin or Cooks I'd go TE.   D/ST often goes earlier than it really should. And there's only a few great D/ST every season. And it's impossible to predict from season to season. Every year it seems like 1-2 new defenses just get a ton of flukey TD's and such. I personally play week to week matchups based on the worst opposing offenses. If I can find a D/ST playing against Oakland, Jacksonville, Tennessee, or TB then I will try and snag them off waivers.  Kickers make a big difference and are often highly undervalued. I try to get a K a little early. Maybe rounds 13-14. I personally go for high octane offenses like Denver, Indy, GB, NE. etc. Having a top 5 kicker helps if they can go off for 10-20 weekly.  Be active on waivers if you want to win. Last year a lot of winning rosters had waiver wire pickups like Odell Beckham Jr. and Justin Forsett. Neither were starters at the beginning of the season and it takes just taking a chance on picking a guy up. But it happens every year where someone breaks out and has a monster year off waivers.   Rookies in good situations can produce unexpectedly. The problem is it's risky. You could have drafted Bishop Sankey and got burned or you could have drafted Mike Evans and been blessed. It's wildly unpredictable.   As others have said, don't let the 'AFC-West' goggles blind you. Look for values in every round from any team. I've had Rivers, Darren McFadden, Antonio Gates, and others. It changes the way in which you root during games in a fun way and I enjoy it. 'Come on Rivers throw 3 more TD's so I win this week but also lose the game.'  Hope this helps."

DenverBroncos,3cd3us,HarryOttoman,2,Wed Jul 8 16:15:02 2015 UTC,"Approach: Separate your inner Broncos fan from your fantasy football draft entirely. Be completely objective. Example: Manning isn't worth a high draft pick this year, and CJ Anderson is promising but too risky for a round 1/2 draft pick IMO. Tools: The easy way - get a good cheat sheet. /r/fantasyfootball has something called ""beer sheets"" you can use. Print it out, learn how to use it (use the ""value"" stats and such) and cross out players as they're drafted. It makes it easy to draft well. Don't trust the ESPN/Yahoo draft board and projections. Strategy: Every draft is different, so take this as general advice: it's all about VALUE and availability. Use your cheat sheet to identify players that SHOULD have been drafted, but are still available for you.  In the early rounds, take lots of good RBs (they're scarce, and important). Don't take risks in rounds 1-2; get rock solid RBs and WRs. Wait on a QB until round 6 or later (they're plentiful, and the performance dropoff isn't as severe as WR/RB). Later in the draft, load up your bench with backup RBs and WRs who are ""lotto tickets"", don't bother with backup TEs, QBs, Ds and Ks. Aim for the guys who are high risk, high reward. Generally, take a Defense and Kicker in the last two rounds. Do NOT reach for those; it's a crapshoot every year. Research and practice: If you use BeerSheets and don't want to put a ton of time into it, this step is optional. But if you're interested, more knowledge and experience definitely gives you an edge. /r/fantasyfootball is a good resource for learning. Sites like FantasyPros have good tools and mock draft simulators to practice with. And you can log into ESPN or Yahoo or whatever and run longer mock drafts with actual people to get a feel for the draft interface.    So basically.. you can spend 5 minutes before the draft printing out a BeerSheet and do pretty well if you follow the Strategy section I've lined out. Or you can spend countless hours researching and learning more for an additional edge. Just make sure you're having fun, whatever you do."
DenverBroncos,3cd3us,lsjunior,1 point,Wed Jul 8 16:26:21 2015 UTC,"Make sure you are doing a conventional draft to take most of this advice. Auction drafts are a whole different game (IMO more fun). In any case, look through strength of schedules to choose your players and strategize how to deal with bye weeks. You could pick up any old QB to fill in during your starting QB's bye week and expect them to score a ton of fantasy points if they are playing agains the worst passing defense that week.  Aside from the draft, waiver wire claims win championships. Especially in a league with only 6 men (or women!). Keep an eye out for injuries to starters, and pick up their handcuffs on the wire. You are going to have a gold mine of free agents to choose from.   Program your phone to get ESPN notifications for NFL news. Keep an eye on the depth chart. For example, 3 years ago Julius Thomas was third on the depth chart in pre-season. Week 1 he was moved up to the top spot and was a free agent. I picked him up as soon as I got that news, and ultimately won the championship (with some other good pickups).  Good luck!"

It's good to go RB cause the talent dropoff for RBs is far steeper for RBs than QBs.  WRs are tempting but depend too much on their QB to be worthy of a first rounder IMO

DenverBroncos,3c99gw,Stache1168,2,Mon Jul 6 21:00:44 2015 UTC,"I liked Sambrailo, he was one of the guys I wanted Denver to take the most in the second (provided they didn't take a tackle in the first). I thought that he might not have the power to be a RT in the run game year one, but he's obviously playing LT now, where that becomes a bit less important.  The biggest problem with him will be NFL strength and size, which will be fixed with a year or two of NFL weight lifting. He has good intelligence, footwork, athleticism.  Didn't look at Garcia too much, from what I knew he was a guy more suited for a power blocking scheme and I paid more attention to guys who played in a ZBS like Cam Erving, Reese Dismukes, Hroniss Grasu. But obviously I'll trust Kubiak and the FO on that one."

We're going to try and run 15 play drives that take 9 minutes off the clock. 10 of those being run plays, of which the full back will be of vital importance.   Where's Howard Griffith when you need him?"
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,PMeist,5,Sun Jul 5 21:00:37 2015 UTC,"This is the type of offense that will prevent games like the New England game from getting away from us.

DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,Greeney494,12,Sun Jul 5 21:11:46 2015 UTC,It will help the running game as he will lead block downfield for him.   Part of why Adrian Peterson is so successful (besides being supremely talented) is having a FB in the offense. Demarco Murray had James Clutts blocking for him too.
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,DENTD3058,10,Sun Jul 5 19:55:18 2015 UTC,"Not just that. The FB can take over as pass protection/dump off option, freeing up CJ to run routes. Some of the catches he made last year were insane. I hope they can figure out a way to take advantage of his hands."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,kloktn,8,Mon Jul 6 00:24:44 2015 UTC,CJ is a very underrated receiver out of the backfield.
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,BlindManBaldwin,6,Mon Jul 6 01:41:24 2015 UTC,"Yeah. I had to watch it again to be sure, and cause it's awesome, but the 51 yard catch and run against Oakland was one handed."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,kloktn,1 point,Mon Jul 6 02:28:21 2015 UTC,But that takes away a receiver and or tight end that could either be another outlet or block while also threatening to be an outlet
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,Occams_Lazor_,1 point,Tue Jul 7 02:50:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah you're losing someone who could be a blocker or a receiver. You're gaining someone who can be a runner, blocker, or a receiver. I'm not an expert and I'm probably taking out my ass, but to me it's like they are building a tank. Before the emphasis was on building a stable pocket and letting Peyton deliver the ball. With the switch to zone blocking, as I understand it, the pocket is going to be more mobile. Instead of defending the emphasis will shift to pushing into the other team and stuffing the ball down their throats. The amount of receiving threats doesn't change just their position."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,kloktn,9,Tue Jul 7 04:40:15 2015 UTC,"Former HS FB reporting in. Fullback for me was an incredibly fun position. You get to do a little bit of everything.  Here's how I understand the position. In today's NFL putting a fullback into the personnel set represents a significant investment in the running game. That's one less WR or TE you could have on the field. That's why many teams don't even have a FB on the roster anymore.   So it naturally begs the question, what can having two running back-ish players in the backfield do you for you?    Lead Blocking. On high school teams, this responsibility might be relatively equal with things like pass protection and running/catching the ball, but in the NFL. If you can't lead block, you aren't a FB. You'd want a FB on the field if you want to do a lot of inside running. Because the FB starts in the backfield, he gets a running start at the hole without having to worry about the football. So that flashy linebacker with his head on a swivel wondering which way he's gonna have to jump to make the tackle gets bowled over. A good lead block can often make the difference between a runner making it out of the box and not. Lead blocking also allows you to wear down a defense physically. Linebackers and safeties are used to delivering hits, not receiving them.  Option plays and play action.  Unlike pass plays where you either rush or fall into your assigned coverage, with run plays the defender must identify and track the ball carrier as quickly as possible. Having two running threats instead of one just makes the job of linebackers all that more difficult. It also makes play action far more effective, as it gives the QB one RB to fake the run with, and another RB to pass protect, be a checkdown, or run a bootleg with.  Pass protection and checkdown. This one is likely to be more emphasized on a PFM offense, especially with a suspect O-line and an increasingly fragile PFM. FBs are usually much better blockers than RBs and better built for it. Having two backs in the backfield means a second line of defense (as defenses rarely blitz more than 5 and rarely have more than 2 good pass rushers) rather than a last resort RB. Or you can have your outlet back and your pass protection.    The beauty of fullbacks is in their versatility. They can block, hit, catch and run and do most if not all of them decently well. You just don't seem them much anymore as it boxes your personnel into a ""run-first"" approach and rarely do teams these days have both a good RB and a good FB. Plus many young RBs don't want to play FB as it reduces their chances to touch the ball and get noticed.  On this team, you're very likely to see players like Virgil Green play as a flex FB/TE. He's got the size to go on the line, the height to compete with DBs for passes, the power to block effectively, and the hands and athleticism to run or catch effectively. Juwan Thompson would make a good classic FB, as would CJ if he wasn't such a badass RB.     Some people in this thread think two TE sets are more likely, being that it is still a PFM offense and we have two solid all-around TEs. I'm inclined to disagree given:   CJ's skill as an inside runner A number of players who could fit the position A suspect O-line and a glass cannon QB.    What it'll probably be is 2-TE will be the base package, with the second TE either rotating back to FB, or subbing out for a true FB or a third WR. Either way, Gary Kubiak strikes me as the kind of coach who can really utilize a FB, because that's what makes the difference. A FB can either be a semi-superfluous second RB, or a jack-of-all-trades."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,caesarfecit,4,Mon Jul 6 12:41:24 2015 UTC,This was an excellent post about an underrated position. I'm going to save this for any times people ask what a fullback does.
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:29:13 2015 UTC,"Two TE's won't be the base, 3 receivers will. This is still a Manning offense. There's just gonna be more two TE sets than normal.  Two TEs will be more common than an I formation not because it's a Manning offensive, but because it's a Kubiak offense. Like I said elsewhere it's just not the passing game killing the FB, it's the utilization of tight ends in the passing game that's killing the FB. He's always used two TEs more than anything, except for last year with the Ravens where their only TE was Owen Daniels. Even then, they used their FB, Kyle Juszczyk as a TE/H-Back as much as a FB.   Some people in this thread think two TE sets are more likely, being that it is still a PFM offense and we have two solid all-around TEs. I'm inclined to disagree given:  CJ's skill as an inside runner  A number of players who could fit the position  A suspect O-line and a glass cannon QB   I'm not really sure what you're getting at here? What you said applies to TEs just as much, if not more so. For your first point, two TEs are more common on an inside zone read than one TE, one FB. FBs are rarely used on inside zone reads, which will obviously be the most common inside running play, with Kubiak being the coach and all.  For the second, Denver's actual fullback, James Casey, has been a TE in his career more than a FB. Outside of that, the only guy on the roster whose played FB is Green and obviously he's a TE more than anything.  And TEs are just as much of an asset to run blocking and pass blocking. And if Denver needs a 6 man protection with someone to pick up a blitz, that's what you use runningbacks for."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,rumplestumpleskin,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:45:49 2015 UTC,"Great post.  What I like about a good FB is that they will typically have the right body shape to eat those MIKEs for lunch, where most TEs usually seem more suited for blocking the edges, SAM/WIL.    Also for the OP, look up the very very famous Nebraska cornerstone play: the fullback trap.  Great play if the offense/coaches know how and when to use it."

You've got it!   TEs in the running game are good for outside runs and counters, and that's about it. A FB gives you punch up the middle.   The real difference between a FB and a RB is a fullback may not have the sheer quickness of an RB, but they have similar acceleration, and their heavier build gives them momentum and kinetic energy like you wouldn't believe.   The hardest I ever got hit in football was from a fullback and the hardest hits I ever gave were as a FB (I also played some DE and TE)."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,a_D_u_B,1 point,Tue Jul 7 03:14:59 2015 UTC,"I personally hope we don't use too many sets involving a fullback.  It's like having 4.5 weapons out there.  Unless, and this is something I thought could be a sweet wrinkle, we move Virgil around.  Have Owen line up as a standard TE and Virgil line up in the I or offset.  Peyton can continue with the run play to Virgil's side, or motion him out as he sees fit.  Oh I'm getting giddy."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,kckolbe,1 point,Tue Jul 7 06:36:51 2015 UTC,"There'll probably be a fullback on less than 10% of plays, if that.  It's not going to effect much, and it probably isn't gonna effect running the ball much either. Kubiak uses fullbacks as receivers more than anything else."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,kckolbe,5,Sun Jul 5 23:15:43 2015 UTC,"I think fullbacks are underrated in the NFL.  A good FB not only improves the run game, but is generally a better third down protection option, having more power to block with than a standard HB.  In addition, FBs can sub in at TE and RB (depending on build, of course), adding flexibility.  On top of that, they are the cheapest starting position after Long Snappers.  I'm a fan."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,kckolbe,2,Sun Jul 5 23:31:40 2015 UTC,"2nd TE >>>> fullback  They're not just dying out because it's more of a passing game, they're dying out because a 2nd TE brings just as much value to running the ball while being a better option as a receiving threat."
DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Sun Jul 5 23:52:43 2015 UTC,"That's kind of where I was going when I said depending on build.  Most TEs are taller, and not well suited to plowing out a fourth and short.  Not all players are equal, though."

DenverBroncos,3c7zr8,WilliamPoole,1 point,Mon Jul 6 00:02:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, a fullback either needs to have length to sub as a TE or compact power to be a short yardage rusher to really justify the spot.  I just think it's a position most teams don't try to do more with, which is odd given how cheap they are.  And, of course, due to lack of demand, natural athletes aren't exactly setting out to become FBs."

What's the general consensus on Cody Latimer around here? I loved him coming out of college and was pretty upset when he was taken by you guys. Are you as hyped for him as I am? Are there any other players you're hoping/expecting to have a breakout year? I've seen Virgil Green mentioned a few times, but I don't really buy it.  Thanks guys!"
DenverBroncos,3c540u,PMeist,2,Sat Jul 4 21:47:46 2015 UTC,"Cody Latimer didn't do anything his rookie year due to John Fox's terrible decision making. He became notorious for never allowing rookies to see the field at all. It's why Sly Williams (also a sleeper candidate at NT) never saw the field much in two seasons. Fox and Elway greatly differed on that subject which is one of many reasons why Fox is now in Chicago.   Latimer needed to see more of the field and I almost consider this to be his rookie season. He will definitely see the field a lot more, and he NEEDS to step it up this season. If an injury happens (knocked on wood) he needs to be able to come in right away and be next man up. He has huge potential, but many NFL athletes are freak of nature athletes, tons of potential, then never pan out. I don't see him putting up huge numbers this season or anything (I do out of DT and Sanders) but he can be a solid contributor and weapon."

Correct me if I'm wrong, but Clady wasn't actually as good as the media liked to make out, and I'm wondering if Sambrailo might be able to fill the position without any drop in the level of play."
DenverBroncos,3c540u,crueg,1 point,Sat Jul 4 22:26:23 2015 UTC,"Gino came over with kubes from Baltimore and he had a pretty damn bad pff score. I think Ty is bring worked in at Clady's position, he was a stud at csu and a great value in the 2nd round, and I think he'll do well for a rookie(just imo). Clady pre injury, WAS that good, top 3 caliber. It pains me to see him get injured so early again, he was my (and a lot of others) pick for comeback player on offense. He had a down year last year, but a down year for Clady is still average compared to others. I hope he can just rest and get some good rehab in and come back to his old form."

Thanks for the Clady info too, I'd always thought he was overhyped based on old form that he hadn't really gotten back to for a while.

DenverBroncos,3btkmx,FatBeardBrown,4,Thu Jul 2 01:58:42 2015 UTC,"20 is a pretty damn good spot for him, I think. We've had a good showing of players in the top 100, 4 players(thus far, I'm sure Peyton will be in the last remaining players), and that's a pretty good accomplishment.   NOW IF ONLY THE BEST FUCKING CORNER IN THE LEAGUE LAST YEAR WERE ON THE LIST.  edit: here's the video of it http://www.denverbroncos.com/multimedia/videos/NFLTop100----No-20-Demaryius-Thomas/cfe60acc-a023-4bd9-9742-2e025f00da72"

DenverBroncos,3boll3,dcar5323,5,Tue Jun 30 21:55:32 2015 UTC,This was created entirely using Blender version 2.74
DenverBroncos,3boll3,soundman1024,6,Tue Jun 30 23:47:45 2015 UTC,"Nice job overall. The eye is a pain in the ass, but you did a nice job with it. I usually see the navy...eyelid? inset into the head, but that's one of the cool things about 3D. Logos aren't standardized for 3D so you can add your own interpretation.  I would consider adding a bit of a bevel to all edges. Every real object has some sort of bevel. Even if it's small it'll add some realism. Also texture on the mane is a bit out of place as everything else is smooth. Lastly a bit of fill light from a large, soft source on the top would help to lift the navy up from black.  Not bad during the learning process. Couple of things I would recommend as you continue:   With the Jags look into some UV mapping. See about placing the spots using a texture on a material rather than creating geometry for them. With the Bucs you could look into cloth. Swords aren't too difficult to model. Instead of just extruding splines it isn't too difficult to create geometry. It's a friendly logo for taking your modeling to the next level.   Keep it up! 3D is a fun skill."
DenverBroncos,3boll3,troubledhumans,2,Wed Jul 1 02:53:30 2015 UTC,"Thanks so much for the feedback/advice!  I actually do have a tiny amount of bevel on most exposed edges, but it's very minimal.  When I come around to updating/altering all of these, I'll definitely knock that up a bit.  And yeah, I see what you're saying about the disparity between smooth/effect parts.  It's partially intentional, because the logos are smooth by nature, and really what I've been doing so far is taking one specific part and highlighting it in some way.  Another thing I'll look at when I do round 2 is adding some consistency, which is actually something I'm hoping to do with all the logos.  Totally right about the soft light on the top too, as I have a tendency to like large amounts of contrast personally, but I don't think that's something a lot of people appreciate (learned that from the first Cowboys logo I did).  I've got an EXTREMELY basic understanding of UV unwrapping.  A few tutorials I've gone through have used it for things like wood textures, but it's really just been used in passing and not explained.  I'll check out some specific tutorials, because I've been DREADING having to carve out curves for all those spots, plus the several shades of colors all around them.  Nurbs is great when you're carving smaller shapes out of larger shapes, but not so great when three shapes all meet at a singular point.  I've done a cloth tutorial, which used an animation to drop a plane with physics effects over a cup.  Making an actual flag to get the wave effect sounds like a lot of fun, so I'll definitely look into that.  I've been a little weary of getting in over my head with things, so I've been hesitant to break out of my comfort zone so far, but I'll definitely start pushing things a little more when it comes to this one.  I'm also thinking of doing the Browns one as just a full on helmet, which seems like the sensible thing to do.  It'll break away from how I've been doing things, but I'm not really sure what else I can do for them.  Thanks again for the advice!  It definitely won't go to waste :)"

DenverBroncos,3bnwas,Fridden,42,Mon Jul 6 04:13:22 2015 UTC,"That's because saying ""Broncos will win their 5th straight division title"" is about as exciting as saying ""Ralph Nader is running for President""... nothing has changed, and it isn't the sexy pick. No one involved even cares if Denver wins the division.  If we win the division, then all four teams didn't reach their goal. Oakland, KC, and SD ALL have the goal to win the division. They haven't done it in forever, so if they win it, it was a HUGE goal for them. If Denver wins it... who the hell cares? I sure don't. Denver's goal is Silver, and comes with a ring. Anything less is failure."
DenverBroncos,3bnwas,bcos4life,7,Tue Jun 30 20:21:37 2015 UTC,"You hit the nail on the head.  There is no drama in the pick.  In some ways it is almost sad, isn't it.  The regular season isn't even exciting at this point.  It wasn't last year either.  If we fail to make the playoffs it will be one of the most epic fails in NFL history.  Looking at the schedule off to the side, I just don't see how we fail to make the playoffs.  And really only the GB, Indy, NE, and at Pitt worry me.  Not to dismiss the games AT KC and SD but I just don't feel worried.  At all.  I see 11-5 at worst.    Last year was the same...the only thing that added interest for me was the suspensions to start the year (that was last year, right?) and the question of Manning's health to end it.    I personally am really pessimistic about this team.  And I hate that.  I feel like we are in for another post season letdown.  And I can't stand being Debbie Downer about this team but I'm afraid I'm buying into the ""Peyton Manning Post Season Struggles"" argument.  I hope it was all the injury.  But that also pisses me off.    If he isn't 100% before each game this year, he needs to sit and rest.  It does us no good to risk further injury, fail to help develop the backup, and let him limp along without time to heal."

DenverBroncos,3bmyns,benjaminrogers91,14,Tue Jun 30 14:55:36 2015 UTC,"Denver Broncos   2014 record: 12-4 (Lost in divisional round)  AFC West future rank: 3rd  Overall score: 71.2  The bar graphs reflect the average rating given by the voters for each category. Category averages are weighted by importance to generate overall score.  The overview: The Broncos fell 10 spots from last year for two primary reasons. First, the coaching rank dropped from 11th to 19th even though Gary Kubiak was successful in Houston previously. And second, the quarterback category went from fourth to 23rd after Peyton Manning ranked 13th in Total QBR over the Broncos' final 10 games, counting playoffs. Manning might not be finished, but he finally appears to be a player in decline, to the point that the Broncos coaxed a reduction in pay from him. The team's future at the position is murky beyond this season. --Mike Sando  The dilemma: It's a near certainty that within the next three seasons, we will no longer see Manning in an NFL uniform, which means the time is now for the Broncos to start gauging the readiness of backup Brock Osweiler. Does the franchise truly feels Osweiler is capable of being a championship-level QB? The Broncos' long-term future hinges on that question. When you then factor the offensive line being in a state of transition -- and the offense as a whole undergoing a scheme change -- it's no certainty that the Broncos will win the AFC West for the fifth consecutive season. --Louis Riddick  The youth movement: When the Broncos decided to go all-in last year, signing a star-studded free agent class (T.J. Ward, Emmanuel Sanders, DeMarcus Ware and Aqib Talib), it severely hampered their ability to retain some of their homegrown talent. Julius Thomas, Nate Irving, Orlando Franklin and Rahim Moore all relocated this offseason -- only Von Miller and Virgil Green remain from the 2011 draft class. The Broncos should see the true value of the 2012 draft his season with Derek Wolfe and Malik Jackson starting at defensive end in the 3-4 and Danny Trevathan starting at inside linebacker. --John Clayton  **edited to include bar graphs link and Full Article DropBox Link"

DenverBroncos,3bmyns,lsjunior,4,Thu Jul 2 20:52:49 2015 UTC,"So wait... our old coaching staff was 11 now it's 19th? The same coaching staff that took a knee 3 years ago against Baltimore? The ones that couldn't switch corners in the playoffs against the colts? You give us down and distance and we can tell what pay will be run next. Kubiak and company fall 9 spots below where Fox and Del Rio were??? Bahahahahahahahaa! I can handle the criticism of the o-line, whether Brock is ready or not, shit even PFM sucking. But this coaching staff not just worse but considerably worse. ROFL.  Edit:c I coaching was 11th not 10th"
DenverBroncos,3bmyns,milehighvonster,1 point,Tue Jun 30 20:28:21 2015 UTC,"I agree with the coaching staff. Even after the Colts loss Fox acted like it was no big deal and we were playing next week. Del Rio not putting Chris Harris on TY still confused about that one. Outside of Manning and Ware are we really old at any position? I expect Ware to be cut next year. Clady will be cut or take a big paycut. Manning most likely will retire that's a lot of cap room. Of course Miller is due a contract, as well as Marshall and Trevethan which depends on how they play in a 3-4. Love both those guys though."

DenverBroncos,3bjxls,von_bot,4,Mon Jun 29 21:15:23 2015 UTC,Oh /u/von_bot never change.
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,waspocracy,3,Mon Jun 29 21:18:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is the natural answer. CJ is gonna CJ so hard in the ZB system and Von is going to take advantage of a ""Ray"" of light given to him."
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,waspocracy,8,Mon Jun 29 21:19:33 2015 UTC,"This is a hard question to answer. If you're talking about running backs, then obviously CJ will have the best showing. I think Montee Ball will surprise everyone as well since there will likely be a better split this year than under the Fox era. This will be without a doubt his best year. I think Bibbs will shine and become 3-string too.  Wide receiver, I think Latimer will tear apart defenses as everyone will put their #1 and #2 CB's on DT and He-manual.  James Casey will not be talked about until he's quietly becoming #1 TE in touchdown receptions. Teams will be too focused on the WR's and he'll slip through, or just do 1-yd rushes at the FB position.  Defense is a different story. Von will finally be in a defensive scheme built for him. Take him the last couple of years and imagine building onto that in his natural state. Scary as fuck. McCray is finally healthy and we'll see him surprise some people too.   Then there's Roby. His PFF ramped up each week and I expect the same this year.   Our Free Agency pickup Stewart is going to fly around. Imagine a Rahim Moore, but faster and can respond to runs really well.   I think Anunike is going to surprise people if they haven't heard of him from last year and same with Malik.   But if you want me to pick a single person on offense and defense then it'd be CJ and Von."

DenverBroncos,3bjxls,Fridden,1 point,Tue Jun 30 15:01:49 2015 UTC,Are you sure Stewart is faster than Rahim?
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,a_D_u_B,2,Mon Jun 29 23:01:46 2015 UTC,"So I did some research to answer your question.  First, I'll post this article to show why he's better. One thing to mention is that he has a lower missed-tackle rate than Rahim Moore according PFF.  But, yes. His 40-time is 4.53 and Moore posted a 4.62. If you want to look at his 20-yard shuttle, he is faster there as well."
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,ktsmyth,1 point,Mon Jun 29 23:24:55 2015 UTC,"Those times are 5 years old though.  Albeit I haven't watched a ton of Stewart, mainly highlights after we signed him but Rahim just looks faster on the field to me"
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,ktsmyth,5,Tue Jun 30 03:03:01 2015 UTC,"Malik Jackson for defense, he is finally starting and one of the most underrated players in all of football.   On offense probably CJ."
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,troubledhumans,5,Mon Jun 29 22:08:18 2015 UTC,... Brock?  Do tell because you must have some sort of grand visions for an injury involving Peyton.  An amazing showing doesn't happen in leftover garbage time so I'm curious to know how Brock plays a significant role this season.
DenverBroncos,3bjxls,kgxv,3,Mon Jun 29 21:29:32 2015 UTC,"I apologize, I should have at least iterated that I don't think Brock will be the starter... Just that he will be one of our most impressive showings outside of our already potent offense. He will come in to close games and will not only hold the leads, but increase them as well. We already expect great things from our offense but I think that Brock's progression will be better than anyone that we wouldn't expect otherwise."
DenverBroncos,3bfolz,crueg,4,Sun Jun 28 20:29:53 2015 UTC,Brandon Perna doesn't seem to have the same spark that he used to. Get the man a beer and then put him on camera!
DenverBroncos,3bfolz,TheRealIntern,7,Mon Jun 29 00:18:46 2015 UTC,I think he is usually like this for the casual non-big things like this. I am sure you will see classic Brandon during the season.
DenverBroncos,3bfolz,solsethop,5,Mon Jun 29 01:05:25 2015 UTC,"I think Perna tones it down (sometimes) on Mile High Huddle. On YouTube he can say anything. On MHH, which is part of Scout/Fox Sports, he has to be little more restrained."
DenverBroncos,3bfolz,SaltLakeBronco,4,Mon Jun 29 16:22:29 2015 UTC,Probably because it was an official video for the Mile High Report instead of one of his own one offs.

DenverBroncos,3bfolz,_Exaybachay_,3,Mon Jun 29 18:37:55 2015 UTC,"Pretty reasonable, sound forecast, if you ask me. Also... Rodgers only threw 5 INTs last year? Damn, that's amazing."
DenverBroncos,3bfolz,SonicSC,3,Mon Jun 29 14:13:51 2015 UTC,Reminds me of Tom Brady's 2010 season. He only threw 4 INTs. He had 335 consecutive passes without an INT.

DenverBroncos,3bdbto,Royusmaximus,5,Sun Jun 28 03:36:18 2015 UTC,"Denver had interest in Wilson even during the draft, they were just interested in Brock even more. They would more than likely go after him but I doubt they would make him the highest paid player like he is asking for.   A team like the Bills or Jets would do that."
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,DENTD3058,9,Sun Jun 28 05:35:05 2015 UTC,"I can't imagine our front office making any sort of push for him. Our FO has a lot of confidence in the lobster and will give him a chance one manning retires.   Plus, wilson wants to be the highest paid player in the league. There's no way we could afford that with having to resign DT and Von Miller by next free agency, on top of a handful of other quality players. I just don't see us breaking the bank for him."

DenverBroncos,3bdbto,Bilyman,2,Sun Jun 28 04:40:27 2015 UTC,"If that's the case, it would be a good idea to get Brock a good amount of snaps this season, and evaluate. Would be a shame to miss out on a great player just to see if he works out."

DenverBroncos,3bdbto,Fridden,3,Sun Jun 28 04:28:32 2015 UTC,"No way, no thanks. He's a good qb but not even close to what he is asking. I hope he does leave Seattle though so we can see what he really is, an above average qb with a great running game and an amazing defense."
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,andrrrew,2,Sun Jun 28 21:48:14 2015 UTC,I could dig this. Thought about it. But it won't happen.
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,PMeist,5,Sun Jun 28 05:00:53 2015 UTC,I hate Wilson with the fiery passion of a million suns. This is a clickbait article if I ever saw one.   The idea of him playing here is beyond ludicrous and would never happen. However if it did I would question the mental state of everyone involved in that decision and probably stop following the NFL for his duration in Denver. I hate him that much.
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,SplashMortal,-2,Sun Jun 28 10:04:16 2015 UTC,That's exactly how I felt about Teblow.
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,OkAutopilot,-1,Sun Jun 28 11:44:42 2015 UTC,You'd question the mental state of everyone involved in the decision to bring an incredibly promising young quarterback who has played phenomenally since he's been in the league to the Broncos?

DenverBroncos,3bdbto,PMeist,1 point,Tue Jun 30 16:03:57 2015 UTC,"Are you even a football fan? I would totally understand a Packers or Falcons fan hating Elway forever.   If you can grow to love and admire some players its perfectly feasible to hate other players. There's no way you don't hate some teams/players. It's part of sports, to have rivals. And Wilson beat us in the biggest sporting spectacle, whether or not we showed up to that game is irrelevant.   Do you think the Browns fans don't hate the Broncos? A ton still do for The Drive and The Fumble. A lot of Browns fans hate Elway, and I get it. Do you think the Patriots fans have moved on from Eli? A ton of Pats fans hate him, he lead two SB winning drives against that organization.   I moved to Arizona for college and one of my best friends from there is a die-hard Cardinals fan. Do you think there will ever be a time when he doesn't hate Pittsburgh or Ben Roethlisberger? Many, many Cards fans will never get over the franchises only SB appearance loss.   So don't tell me to grow up and move on when it's a completely natural and normal thing. I don't hate any player outside of the game because that is dumb as hell. But inside the game of football I can't stand Wilson or the Seahawks."
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,TryHardPants45,2,Tue Jun 30 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"I'm still not convinced he's as good as he thinks he should be paid.  I don't mean this to sound as salty as it does, I just think their success stems from their running game, o-line, and defense.  Plus people love to blast Carroll for the passing call in the Super Bowl, but Wilson made a God awful throw.  You never throw high and outside a receiver crossing in the end zone.  If it was low and inside it's a TD and they win."

DenverBroncos,3bdbto,baha24,12,Sun Jun 28 03:39:22 2015 UTC,"No, GB screwed themselves by getting cocky and getting away from the game plan that had gotten them all the way through the game, I.E. going with a single high safety at the end instead of the two safeties, which had come up with, what, 3 interceptions so far, and 1 completed pass? Not to mention McDumbass muffing that kickoff... No Wilson did not single handedly bring them back against the Packers, the Packers fucked themselves repeatedly.  Wilson is good, but he is not the god everyone tries to portray him as. He is on a team where there is actually not much pressure to drag the team along like Luck does, or Brady does, or Peyton has done."
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,broncopower1,3,Sun Jun 28 04:36:12 2015 UTC,"He is on a team where there is actually not much pressure to drag the team along like Luck does, or Brady does, or Peyton has done.   This, this, this. I actually like Wilson -- he's a smart player, and I think he's becoming a more integral part to that Seattle team. But he does not deserve the money he's asking for; not yet, at least. Imagine the Seahawks had somehow managed to draft Luck and Wilson had gone to the Colts. Indy might just now be to the point where the could compete for a playoff spot, and Seattle conceivably could have won 1-3 SBs (I really don't think that's a stretch).  I think Wilson has a lot of potential, but there's no way he can make the argument that he, as a player, is better (or even more valuable to his team) than PFM, Brady, Rodgers, Luck, etc., and therefore deserves more money than all of them."
DenverBroncos,3bdbto,baha24,1 point,Sun Jun 28 17:53:11 2015 UTC,"So much yes. He is arguably top 10 i would say in no specific order but I have no doubt in my mind that he's not worth a max contract.  Put him in a situation where he has to REALLY step up to win in a season and then make an offer.   That pass against the Packers had to be the luckiest throw ever, and people were all on his nuts saying hes ""just good like that"". Pffft."

DenverBroncos,3bfnou,Greeney494,4,Thu Jul 2 01:12:12 2015 UTC,"This is tough. The way you phrased it sounded like you were making excuses as to why we never win in the playoffs. ""Oh we'd be good but bad things always happen to us.""  If a fan yells at you for thinking that the Broncos will lose games, or how you don't think we'll win the Super Bowl (personally, I don't think any fan of any team should go into a season, or even the playoffs, thinking they'll win the Super Bowl.) then they're wrong, you're just being a realist.

DenverBroncos,3bfnou,Greeney494,6,Sun Jun 28 22:57:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, you realize you're saying we're unlucky because we got to the SUPER BOWL? That doesn't make sense. Just because we didn't win all 7 doesn't mean we're unlucky. Just means we get to the Super Bowl a lot, which many teams don't. The Broncos have been to the Super Bowl in 4 of the past 5 decades, time to stop thinking losing a SUPER BOWL is the worst thing that can happen. Enjoy good football, and enjoy the fact you cheer for a team that is consistently good."
DenverBroncos,3bfnou,bentoboxbarry,-5,Sun Jun 28 21:27:39 2015 UTC,"It doesn't mean jack shit if you don't win it all. Every single year that you don't win the SB your team failed. I live in Arizona and I'm a huge Suns fan. We made the finals once in my lifetime when I was like 8, trust me making the big game and losing it hurts much more. I would rather not even make the playoffs than be blown out of the SB.   Just because we happened to make the SB doesn't mean you can't have bad luck. The Bills made 4 straight and lost all of them so you're saying they didn't have bad luck?"
DenverBroncos,3bfnou,crueg,4,Sun Jun 28 21:33:14 2015 UTC,"Look, if that's how you view football, then you're saying only 49 teams IN NFL HISTORY have NOT been failures. What kind of attitude is that? 31 teams are not winning the Super Bowl this year, the odds are honestly against everyone.  I'm not saying it didn't suck that the Bills didn't win a Super Bowl in 4 straight tries, but Jesus if you ask any of those players I'm sure they'd want to go to all 4 again, rather than to be 2-14.   There are unlucky aspects to football, but losing/winning football games, unless they're decided on the last play or a fluke, don't involve 'luck'.   The Broncos have lost 5 Super Bowls, which means during those years, only ONE team was better than they were that year. I'll never be ashamed of that, especially if you think that in 2010, 30 teams were better than the Broncos."

DenverBroncos,3b7h99,CoachSpo,4,Fri Jun 26 16:17:10 2015 UTC,"I've never heard of ""plaza level"" maybe that's the same as club level?   Edit: looks like the plaza level is the seats furthest up on the south side. Not quite nose bleeds but not field level either. Overall good seats  If it's within your price range and that's what you want then go for it but for the best experience I'd try and get seats on the south end of the stadium anywhere close to the endzone. The weather will be great so tailgating is a must. If you're driving then just get to the stadium a couple hours ahead of time to make sure you get a good spot. The light rail is great public transportation. Drops you of right at mile high and goes downtown as well so it's easy to get around with. Definitely recommend exploring the downtown area. 16th Street mall is decent and there are tons of bars north of there by Coors field (rockies stadium) plus you can hop on the light rail from union station whenever you're ready for a quick ride to mile high"

DenverBroncos,3b7h99,soundman1024,2,Sat Jun 27 01:27:18 2015 UTC,"Plaza level has two kinds of seats. Plaza houses the lower level suites and also exterior seats above level 1.  The stadium is shaped like a horseshoe with the large scoreboard on the open end with the south stands. The plaza level seats you found are most likely above level 1 and a little ways back. If you're interested in fantasy stats you'll find seats that can see the south scoreboard are better, but from plaza level you can see both north scoreboards, so you aren't without.  If you can find seats in the ""north reserve"" I would give that a go. It's 300 level non-club seating. Despite being a level higher I like the seats more. If it's Plaza Level or 500s take plaza every day."

DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,baha24,14,Fri Jun 26 03:00:33 2015 UTC,"I take issue with reporters repeatedly misrepresenting the idea that the deflated footballs had something to do with the win over the Colts.  The Colts should never even have made it that far and they were outmatched from the get-go.  As an aside, blame the fucking coaching staff for having their foot out the door for the abomination of a game we had against the Colts - let's cut the shit, the Colts were NOT that good (sorry, Fox and co. have made me irrationally angry over the past 3 years, especially Del Rio and Gase).  The deflated balls actually played a larger roll in every close game the Pats have played going back however long the balls have been deflated.  So if Klis did his due diligence he'd point to the BALTIMORE game as the real travesty of the Pats' cheating nature.  Klis would then have made mention of the nearly mathematically impossible stats the Pats have accrued over years when it comes to not fumbling the easy to hold deflated balls.  Just look it up... Google is easy to use.      In my opinion, the true damage caused to the league by football deflation is greatly minimized when people keep pointing to the damn Colts game.  End rant... The Pats piss me off to no end and anything that gives them wiggle room on this issue is inexcusable."
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,rumplestumpleskin,4,Fri Jun 26 12:17:13 2015 UTC,"I agree with everything you said except ""The deflated balls actually played a larger roll in every close game the Pats have played."" I think you're overlooking momentum in games. If a team gets their back broken early in a game because of an amazing catch made due to a deflated ball, that can have an effect on those not-so-close games as well."
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,Lough5280,1 point,Fri Jun 26 15:32:01 2015 UTC,"This is correct, you're very spot on about the importance of momentum in games.    I didn't include games ending in a route, because I think (purely opinion) that it becomes more difficult to rate the quality of the win, such as, ""was it the balls or was this team that much more ready than the other?  Was it a mix?""  To me, the deflated balls are a more obvious problem when talking about performance over time in close games where a turnover is far more costly.    That's the only reason I am so adamant about the close games being looked at."
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,rumplestumpleskin,1 point,Fri Jun 26 16:36:18 2015 UTC,"That's true, and it is probably more easily quantitative. But with theory in play, it could have effected a wider variety of games throughout there history."

DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,rumplestumpleskin,-10,Fri Jun 26 13:04:14 2015 UTC,"You are incorrect about it not violating the salary cap. Money was guaranteed to Elway and TD which would have had a direct impact on the salary cap of those years. Although it didnt change the total they would have been paid over all, it did affect how it went towards the salary cap. Thats why the Broncos were caught twice for the same crime, in 2001 and 2004, losing a 3rd round pick each time and 1million each time.  EDIT: Have you looked at the salaries Elway was being paid? 2million against the cap compared to Marino at 7 million. The bronocs deferred 29 million in payments during those 3 years, and the salary cap was only 69 million"
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,hecticlorax,4,Fri Jun 26 13:58:32 2015 UTC,"That's not entirely true.  Deflated footballs translate into quantifiable data.  Just look at the Pats' fumble numbers over the last few years, vs the fumble stats of every team ever, they're an absurd statistical outlier; a stat directly tied to the ease of holding onto the ball, a stat which directly impacts almost every game ever played between any two teams.    Conversely, while overall talent is highly important, it has been and always will be far, far more important to have talent that is coached well, meshes well, and is utilized properly every game without fail.  Think of the Broncos last year or the year before or the year before that at... Arguably one of the best yearly collections of talent seen in the last decade+, but those teams (especially the last two years) were Ferraris driven by incompetents.  Edit: The Broncos salary cap ""shenanigans,"" if you can even honestly go that far in terms, were impactful specifically because we had elite coaching, and great players who genuinely loved playing with each other, AND were willing to put everything on the line to win.  But then, the media DID misreport the whole thing anyways (as they often do), so whatever."
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,rumplestumpleskin,-8,Fri Jun 26 12:43:38 2015 UTC,"Actually, that one article you read about fumble rates was a miscarriage of math. Depressingly so. The patriots did not have a lower fumble rate than all the other teams."
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,hecticlorax,8,Fri Jun 26 13:56:38 2015 UTC,"1) False.  I didn't read just one article but multiples on both sides of the debate as well as many analytical discussions on the raw numbers (remember we're interested in the raw numbers to see there is a problem and then analyzing them to see how rare they are).  2) Yes they absolutely did, and it takes serious effort to come to a different conclusion.  If you look at plays per fumble (how many plays are run, and how many fumbles occur over that period), you arrive at a statistical anomaly.  NO OTHER TEAM has the same raw numbers as the Pats.  Plain and simple truth.  Just look at the numbers yourself.  The objectively had lower fumble numbers than all other teams over a multi-year period.  How statistically rare their numbers are is up to debate and stats analysis.  The only real rebuttal to the idea that the Pats are a statistical anomaly is a Matthews and Lopez article on Deadspin stating, ""stats can be used to say anything,"" and then goes on to use ass backwards logic to prove that the quoted stats are wrong.... effectively using ""stats to say anything.""  Additionally, many of the points utilized leading and illogical language, to pick two examples where I started to realize the article is poorly written and to paraphrase, ""any INTELLIGENT reader...""(pandering, illogical), ""I disagree with this methodology, so all the other numbers used must be garbage,"" (illogical).  Indeed they even splits hairs on the graph not starting at 0! While a minor point, this is absolutely ridiculous: responsibly derived scientific or mathematics based graphs DO NOT start at 0 because it is bad science to start at 0 when your first data point is in the 70's (you typically add a squiggle at the bottom of the axis you've collapsed).  Remember, you're not comparing numbers to 0 but you're comparing the numbers to themselves in LOGICAL order and Matthews and Lopez conveniently forget this to ""prove"" their point.  They also do make many good points.  The conclusions as well as your comment, however, are both endemic of the mental gymnastics used by Pats fans to disprove objective fact found in just the raw numbers.  The rebuttal article is disingenuous at best and would be more far more useful if it weren't filled with multiple logical fallacies."
DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,rumplestumpleskin,-8,Fri Jun 26 15:19:11 2015 UTC,You're ignorant of mathematics and what a statistical analysis is.

DenverBroncos,3b5fh8,hecticlorax,3,Fri Jun 26 15:43:17 2015 UTC,"This newer article (about 4 months newer) you linked is actually a far better read than the article I was referencing previously.  I admit I hadn't seen this one before.  That said, Michael Lopez is still the same author though he uses a better methodology these days.  Before, he stated that plays per fumble was bunk, and now he uses that metric.  Other than that, he did a far better job in this article (though it does make him appear emotionally invested).  However, one would think that a responsible researcher doing his ""due diligence"" would actually account for the first footnote in his studies, considering he himself realizes a true analysis has ""other issues to consider.""  I'd be quite interested to see what the numbers say about the Pats, either pro OR con, given updated analyses.  Also unless you're being a troll/busting my balls, your silly assumption that I am ignorant of math and stats analysis makes you look rather foolish.  I'd refrain from assumptions in the future."

Sometimes I also will if someone talks out of their ass or says something that would make me question their grasp of the sport.

So I started green-tagging people who make smart comments or contribute some kind of infographic, chart, or comparison.

DenverBroncos,3azifo,ninjab055,2,Wed Jun 24 20:51:50 2015 UTC,"It's fun to see how much other people want it to have legs. It's also funny because of how little it means even if it was true. Shopping a QB in his probable final year doesn't imply that the Broncos don't have faith in Manning, it would just mean they are looking to see if there is a bite out there worth taking because it would further solidifying the future.   That being said Rapoport's take sounds the most likely to be true so far. It's no secret that the Texans were in the market for a QB and it's very possible they called to see if the Broncos would part ways with Manning for cheap given the circumstances."
DenverBroncos,3azifo,Sienna_Crush,2,Wed Jun 24 21:14:15 2015 UTC,"No doubt, and if you are local you should check Cecil Lammay's show from 105.5 today on this, because he says basically the same thing, and that's very likely how the Brady/Browns story started last year.  Basically, he said the teams that are near the top every year are always evaluating what they can get for everyone, in case they find an offer that blows them away."
DenverBroncos,3azifo,Mister_Jay_Peg,2,Wed Jun 24 21:27:17 2015 UTC,"Does it matter? Whether or not a trade was attempted, it did not happen. Manning will play for the Broncos next season and he'll try to win a super bowl.   Who cares if everyone is still talking about it? It's like last year with the Tom Brady to the Browns rumors. It obviously wasn't going to happen, but it was fun to talk about and funny to see the Pats fans get flustered."
DenverBroncos,3azifo,spndl1,2,Wed Jun 24 20:59:25 2015 UTC,"The issue of trade/not, in the long run, doesn't matter, no.  What matters is that some hack trying to get his and his stations rep up before launch, so he's rehashing old non-news and phrasing it as new information, while VASTLY over-inflating any information he got from whatever he considers sources and it has become national frigging news, and it's all because a certain sub-section of fans can't think critically about their own team and will latch onto and circlejerk the living fuck out of any news that fits their personal feelings on the team.  I know it's almost July, and we are starting the most brutally dead part of the off-season now between OTA'S and camp...  But if this is the kind of shit that will get pumped through this sub on an endless cycle of heat-rehash-rage-repeat, it might be worth it to unsub until camp opens, because it might as well be /r/DAE_Broncos, and fuck that thought."

So if news comes out that America's favorite football player almost gets traded to a new team, you betta believe that they're gonna cover it  Did the Broncos actively try to trade Manning? No. Did they field a call from Houston about it? Probably. And that's interesting enough that people care about it.  I mean the dude is like top 3 in athlete royalty in the country"

I can bet you that NE knows exactly what a couple of teams are willing to part with for guys like Collins, Solder and even Brady. SD knows who is willing to give up what for Rivers. The Lions know how much they can get in return for Stafford and Megatron.  Why? Because teams have called and asked, and since these GM's and personnel folks all know each other pretty well the back room conversations happen all the time. Add in the familiarity with Kubiak and those still left in Houston (I mean, the GM is the same guy as when he was coaching, as is a ton of the scouting department) and I would have been more shocked if this and other conversations DIDN'T happen."

DenverBroncos,3axfc9,therilech242,13,Wed Jun 24 07:25:14 2015 UTC,"All reports so far say the Broncos are sold on Osweiler. Denver received trade offers for Brock in 2013 and 2014, and all were shot down. There were allegedly 4 teams, including the Browns and Texans, trying to get him prior to the 2014 draft.   I'm sure it's no coincidence that Peyton has virtually no guaranteed money the year Oz will become a free agent, and I suspect the no trade clause recently put in Peyton's contract may have been demanded by Condon and Peyton to ensure Manning is released rather than traded following this upcoming season. It seems they expect 2015 to be his last year with the Broncos. Peyton would obviously want to choose his next team, and who knows what some crazy/desperate team would offer to get Peyton, even if it's only for one year.  As for the fan's perspective, we just haven't seen enough of Oz to reasonably say one way or the other. Anyone who says Oz is or isn't the future based on what we've seen is bullshitting. He's far removed from the raw prospect he was in college, which makes his college tape all but useless, and when he has played, it has almost always been with 2nd and 3rd stringers, many of whom are no longer on the team or even in the NFL. All we can say is Brock has improved over the last 3 years. He looked like a very different player in 2012. That doesn't mean he'll succeed, but it is encouraging.  Until we actually see Oz practice, prepare, and play with the starters in an offense built for him rather than Peyton, who has a drastically different skill set, we just can't know."
DenverBroncos,3axfc9,mysterious_pube,10,Wed Jun 24 18:00:26 2015 UTC,"I'll start this off by getting this out of the way- we have no clue what brock is really capable of.  We've seen some flashes in the preseason where he throws a beauty to Latimer for 6, (I'll try to find a link for it tomorrow, I'm on my mobile in a hotel at the moment.) and then we've also seen some less exciting throws. Unfortunately with Fox's super conservative approach with most rookies, when we saw him in games, it was in garbage time and was mostly handing the ball off. I think this season, with father time catching up with Manning, we're going to see a handful of games where Brock starts the 2nd half, or even a full game, much like Elway's final year.   A lot of the front office seems to be really smitten with Brock, while fox's coaching staff seemed to not be as taken, seeing as how they kept injured manning in, instead of letting the lobster out of his cage. (To be fair, if I were a coach and peyton fucking manning said ""yeah I can play"", I'd keep him in too, but there's a good reason I'm not an nfl coach). Brock also beat out Elway's son at ASU as the starting qb, and it was rumored that during the draft, they had brock ranked the same as Russell wilson, and choice brock because of his age. So there's a lot that can be said about him, but as I said at the top, we just don't know what he'll look like.   tldr: Mostly of us are hoping he ends up being the next Aaron Rodgers.  Edit- I'll try to get that td pass to Latimer added, along with some of his less pretty throws. If another fan wants to beat me to it, I shall commend you with my leftover panda express"

DenverBroncos,3axfc9,billb666,6,Wed Jun 24 16:25:52 2015 UTC,"Probably a lot. Manning is all about the records and personal achievement. If there is any way he can take the field to rack up more stats, he is doing it.   As one of the GOATs, he also probably has more say in the decision than a regular QB does (and more than he probably should). You dont just ""bench"" Peyton Manning.   The 41-10 game against Oakland where Manning took the field instead of a ready and willing Brock.. perfect example. He should NOT have been out there, the team wasnt planning on him going out there, but he did it anyway."

DenverBroncos,3axfc9,St_HotPants,1 point,Thu Jun 25 03:58:42 2015 UTC,He's releasing the ball from a MUCH improved delivery point (though that isn't saying much considering how he used to throw) and has adopted Peyton's lower body mechanics seamlessly. He's got so much velocity on the ball that I'm going to say we could have a poor man's Big Ben sitting in wait. But to say he IS or ISN'T for sure gonna be ANYTHING is foolish as we have no real body of work in the pros with people actually on a roster. That drive against Oakland with the TD pass to Green made me happy and optimistic though.

DenverBroncos,3awy83,AdaAstra,6,Wed Jun 24 04:38:59 2015 UTC,"Wait, are you guys surprised we put out feelers for a possible Peyton trade?  We have a young team and trading Manning means we can improve upon our team even more.  No way he would go for cheap, so we would get something decent in the trade.  I love Manning and love that he is staying, but it is not unrealistic for this team to move forward with Oswieler as we are going to have to eventually.  Only downside is that we may have to pay Brock to keep him next year, and given how little we have seen him in regular season, that could be difficult.  Especially with other QB starved teams will likely offer up more for him.  It doesn't matter now as after the restructure, he has a no trade clause."
DenverBroncos,3awy83,RedRiderJman,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:06:02 2015 UTC,"Something to think about though is this, what if we trade Peyton and he has a great year, while Brock has a terrible showing as a starter? We waste all of our talented roster's age as they leave over the next few years. I realize this will happen one way or the other, but what if Brock stinks it up so much while Peyton is killing it? In this scenario we will only lose the success we have gained and possibly lost a SuperBowl win. I want to keep Brock around, he should come pretty cheap. After all we didn't use much of Peyton's pay cut so we can use it for a cheap 2 year extension for Brock as a further test period (I'm assuming Elway can make this happen) then we can ride another year with the guy that I personally see as the best guy that has ever played the Quarterback position."
DenverBroncos,3awy83,AdaAstra,1 point,Thu Jun 25 04:46:33 2015 UTC,"Sure, it is a risk and one that won't be easy to accept if it played out like that, but if we knew how everything played out, it would be easy to know which players to keep and which to drop.  But lets be honest here, while Manning is one of the best QBs in the history of the sport, only he can do so much if the team doesn't support him. That has been painfully obvious the last few years where we got embarrassed by teams we should have been able to beat. Elite QBs don't come around alot, but if Brock is even an above average QB, the players/cap space we would free up with a Manning trade could help support him.  Such as a better offensive line, improving our already insane defense, or locking in a good punter/kicker.  If that trade did happen and Brock didn't pan out, then we just move onto our next QB and start the process again.  Like teams have been doing since the dawn of time.  I don't think Brock is going to go as cheap as people think.  Teams are hounding for him, so someone will likely compete for taking him from us. He has generated interest with several teams over the years.  He won't be getting top pay, but he and his agent might also frown at a ""prove it"" contract.  Some QB starved teams have more money to throw around than we do, and might take the risk hoping for the next Rodgers, instead of going with one of the lower rated QBs in the league already with experience.  For the record, I would have been upset had this trade (rumor or not) had happened.  It would make the Broncos seem like huge dicks, even though we are just doing business like any other team.  I just wouldn't fault the team if they did do it as it wouldn't be a completely insane idea."
DenverBroncos,3awy83,MTLBroncos,7,Thu Jun 25 05:11:32 2015 UTC,Why is everyone being so weird about this. Is it that crazy that we tried to get what we could for Peyton?
DenverBroncos,3awy83,AdaAstra,1 point,Wed Jun 24 07:27:52 2015 UTC,"Agreed. There are some extreme over reactions.  It is not like they are thinking about this now after his restructure, but it wasn't crazy if they explored it before hand."
DenverBroncos,3awy83,Greeney494,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:18:28 2015 UTC,"It might not even be that though. Who said we were shopping Peyton? What if the Texans inquired about Peyton and the Broncos said, ""OK this is our price.."" and it was probably along the lines of a JJ Watt or a bunch of first round picks. Every player has their price in this league."
DenverBroncos,3awy83,LightsSoundAction,2,Wed Jun 24 17:57:00 2015 UTC,"Rapopart said they were just doing off season""due diligence"" and talking hypothetical scenarios.  Are you fucking kidding me?

DenverBroncos,3awy83,Greeney494,3,Wed Jun 24 21:06:12 2015 UTC,Especially Jerry Jones at like 2 AM. Something tells me he's very...not sober...around those hours. Could probably get him into trades that I normally couldn't.

DenverBroncos,3awy83,TacoGuzzler69,6,Wed Jun 24 23:01:27 2015 UTC,For Jj watt. Greatest pass rush in history winning the Super Bowl for their team. How cool does that sound.
DenverBroncos,3awy83,SmartToaster,9,Wed Jun 24 06:17:38 2015 UTC,I would take that trade.
DenverBroncos,3awy83,TacoGuzzler69,8,Wed Jun 24 06:37:08 2015 UTC,Like trading a declining Clinton Portis for the first ballot HOFer Champ Bailey.
DenverBroncos,3awy83,SmartToaster,10,Wed Jun 24 07:32:51 2015 UTC,That was probably the second best trade in franchise history.

DenverBroncos,3awy83,AdaAstra,1 point,Wed Jun 24 13:08:10 2015 UTC,It was likely before the restructure and I'm kind of surprised people didn't think we explore the option of trading Manning.  We wouldn't have traded him for cheap and we would have gotten something pretty nice out of it.  All it would really mean is that we are continuing to build our team without Manning as that is obviously going to happen in the next few years.

DenverBroncos,3axgoe,dusting53,1 point,Wed Jun 24 12:36:12 2015 UTC,"I would hope so. The good thing is even if this were Peyton's last year (which would drive up price of a week 16 game) he isn't the type to say so before the season ends. Even if these tickets somehow double in value due to both teams having top AFC records and I don't get cheated, I would still go to the game rather than resell for a profit. I've been waiting for an @Pittsburgh game since I moved here in 2007."

DenverBroncos,3attm9,Dbencomo19,26,Tue Jun 23 13:31:57 2015 UTC,"Even if he does preform it will be hard to get noticed with this roster. People still don't know who CHJ is and he's been playing top tier for a couple years, and last year Roby was maybe the best rookie corner and got no recognition."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,17,Tue Jun 23 15:18:11 2015 UTC,I agree but it seems like the league recognizes LBs before CBs. Look at the year Champ should have won DPOTY and they gave it to Jason Taylor
DenverBroncos,3attm9,badcompany1981,11,Tue Jun 23 16:58:20 2015 UTC,I'm still pissed about that.
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Spizard,6,Tue Jun 23 17:48:03 2015 UTC,Me too. Jason Taylor had a good year and perhaps another year good enough to win DPOY but not way in hell over Champ.
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Fridden,2,Tue Jun 23 19:23:07 2015 UTC,"I mean, his stats really weren't all that spectacular.  13.5 sacks, 8 ff, 2 int, and 60 tackles.  That to me is just an above average edge rusher doing his job.  Not better than 10 interceptions that is for sure.  I mean hell, champ had more tackles as a corner than Taylor did as a linebacker."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Spizard,3,Tue Jun 23 19:27:11 2015 UTC,Taylor before the award was announced talked about a possibility of retiring. I think they wanted to give it to him on his way out. The bad thing was he ended up playing well after that.

DenverBroncos,3attm9,BlindManBaldwin,3,Tue Jun 23 18:49:04 2015 UTC,the league recognizes LBs before CBs   Unless those CBs are on the Cardinals or Seahawks
DenverBroncos,3attm9,chajimak,10,Wed Jun 24 01:35:14 2015 UTC,"CHJ definitely doesn't get the attention he deserves, but that's just a result of being shutdown CB (not many INTs) and being undrafted (no expectations). Shane Ray will have an easier time getting noticed being a pass-rusher (with hopefully a ton of sacks) and being a 1st round pick."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,jeremywick,8,Tue Jun 23 17:05:33 2015 UTC,"It's also worth mentioning that CHJ isn't a flashy player. He let's his play on the field do the talking. He would get more attention if he were loud and obnoxious like Sherman, or if he was silly like Von Miller."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,taotechill,11,Tue Jun 23 18:06:32 2015 UTC,"I respect the hell out of CHJ because his performance would allow for a Sherman attitude, but he remains humble. He just seems like a real down to earth guy. I've never read any negative news about him."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Juan_El_Way,3,Tue Jun 23 19:23:16 2015 UTC,Totes. Shane Ray plays with a wicked ferocity that will be turning heads all year.
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Coos-Coos,4,Tue Jun 23 22:49:17 2015 UTC,"I think I'd still take Verrett and Fuller before Roby, for now."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,MasonL52,3,Tue Jun 23 19:38:38 2015 UTC,"Well both of them had injury problems that took away from their rookie years, Roby had a consistent body of work all year"
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,1 point,Tue Jun 23 20:37:36 2015 UTC,Did Roby ever start though? Or play consistently on the outside during any stretches last year?  Edit :spelling
DenverBroncos,3attm9,its_yawn-eee,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:41:35 2015 UTC,"Well he was the third corner behind CHJ and talib which is understandable. However he showed an awesome amount of promise when he was tested, even in week 1 he made an amazing play to end the colts comeback.   The only game he got beat badly was against Buffalo, Sammy Watkins had over 100 yards and a td but Roby also has a pick and a FF"
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:12:06 2015 UTC,"So I think it's way to early for him to be compared to anyone, let alone making statements that's he's actually the best"
DenverBroncos,3attm9,its_yawn-eee,0,Wed Jun 24 20:14:22 2015 UTC,"Well the only other corners mentioned to have better rookie campaigns are players who showed bright flashes and then suffered injuries and were not actually playing for a while, so I feel correct in saying that Roby was the most consistent and imo the best rookie cb last year."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,0,Wed Jun 24 20:28:00 2015 UTC,It's easy to get hurt when you play a full time role. It's easy to stay healthy with 2 top 20 CBs(idk where they actually rank) playing above you.  Talk to me when he actually starts or plays more than 30% of the snaps
DenverBroncos,3attm9,its_yawn-eee,0,Wed Jun 24 20:35:48 2015 UTC,"... He played just over 75% of the teams snaps last year... And yes he did start when Talib went down, so that covers both arguments you made.   Maybe look some things up before you get sarcastic with people?"
DenverBroncos,3attm9,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Jun 28 15:41:17 2015 UTC,I asked the Bronco fan and he didn't know. If he would've said that then I wouldn't have replied.
DenverBroncos,3attm9,its_yawn-eee,1 point,Sun Jun 28 16:12:20 2015 UTC,Duuuude Roby was solid but there's no way he was the best rookie corner
DenverBroncos,3attm9,Samcrates,10,Wed Jun 24 18:51:26 2015 UTC,That's exactly the attitude we need from all of our rookies :)

DenverBroncos,3attm9,bcos4life,14,Thu Jun 25 05:22:45 2015 UTC,"I love the attitude, but he is a luxury that will be used in pass rush only situations.  When Von won DROY, he was an every down player, because we NEEDED him to be. Aldon Smith was right there, but the knock on him was that he only played on passing downs because he was a liability in the run game. So Von won it.  Shane will only be an every down player if someone (please no) goes down. Wade is going to have to make special packages so Sugar Shane can join Von and D-Ware."

DenverBroncos,3attm9,Danserud,2,Wed Jun 24 14:50:15 2015 UTC,"He'll likely spell Ware for a significant amount of snaps throughout the season.  Enough to win DROY? Perhaps not. More than ""only passing downs""? Most likely."
DenverBroncos,3attm9,aatencio91,4,Tue Jun 23 21:36:50 2015 UTC,"Good. He's got drive. He wants to win. We need more of that kind of attitude. He's not going to win it, but if he balls out every time he sees the field because he wants to win it, that's enough for me."

Do you think you trying to shove something like this in anyone's face is enough to make anyone belive your father is a lawyer or super CEO or whayever, helping to groom a Bowlen daughter for a position running the team and that this very same Bowlen daughter was so tied into negotiations that she knew about it as they happened, yet was so unprofessional that she either told your father or you directly?

DenverBroncos,3b1g5l,Mister_Jay_Peg,3,Thu Jun 25 21:14:09 2015 UTC,"Exactly, and why would you? He is cheap this year, why would you extend him this off-season? Yes start the talks, if he performs as they want in preseason so that they can lock him down as soon as that changes, but don't it right now with our cap situation is pretty dumb.  (Yes you could write the contract so that it didn't become in effect until next year, but Brock and his agent would push for a change this year if that can of worms was opened.)"

His sources might deny it, but those sources aren't inherently more reliable just because they oppose what Allbright's sources say. If Klis has sources within the organization that deny it, they might have their own motivation to deny it. I can't find a motivation for Allbright's sources to make it up and feed him garbage. I'm not saying Klis is wrong, in fact I'd wager he's on the right side of this story. It's possible Allbright's sources weren't as close to the situation as they said, and were throwing hypotheticals that Allbright misinterpreted... Or the Broncos actually tried to trade him, talks ended quickly, and the Broncos moved forward with a contract restructure. Manning has reason to ask for the no trade clause, and the rest of the organization has motivation to ignore it and say it didn't happen."

DenverBroncos,3awj1c,IAMHab,1 point,Wed Jun 24 04:07:19 2015 UTC,I don't think Elway did it for another reason. Manning would probably  retire instead of starting with a new team. It took him a month to decide whether or not he was coming back to a familiar team he's been with for 3 years. No way he plays for a new team. I think Elway knows this and wouldn't  even bother trying. Manning would retire void the trade.  Now some may say well  Elway gets what he wants Manning gone. Elway doesn't  operate like that. If he wants you gone you're gone. He fire his best friend. I don't  think Elway  plays games like this one.
DenverBroncos,3awj1c,h3isenburg,1 point,Wed Jun 24 14:34:19 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking the Texans reached out to the Broncos, the Broncos said ""we'll get back to you"", and then Peyton restructured his deal and the Broncos told the Texans it wasn't happening. Had Peyton not agreed to take the pay cut, I think the Broncos would've listened to their offer...because, why not? If you can get something in return for him and you truly believe Brock is the future, why wouldn't you listen? My biggest thing is that it would've been pretty disrespectful to Peyton and the Broncos would've increased their increasingly bad rap regarding player relations."
DenverBroncos,3awj1c,IAMHab,-1,Wed Jun 24 20:23:19 2015 UTC,No one in the sub is going to believe it.  Just like no one ever believed the harbaugh rumors or the Bradford rumors.  People believe what they want to believe.

Maybe Thursday that CJ was 1a and Montee was 1b in this offense. Basically, CJ is the starter unless something happens, and Montee will be the person who gives him a breather.  Montee's job security is 100% for 2015.  He was only the 4th most productive RB last year because he was hurt in pre-season and never got healed and was playing with a torn groin from week 1 going forward before going on IR.  For them to paint the picture like they did is sloppy and unprofessional. It's like saying Tom Brady finished as the Patriots 2nd most productive QB in 2008 without mentioning that he went down with an ACL in week 1.   Again, sloppy and unprofessional journalism right there.  Edit: Spelling isn't my friend today"
DenverBroncos,3apne7,Big_Pete1999,6,Mon Jun 22 16:10:22 2015 UTC,"This is typical national media writing shit without knowing the facts about anything.   That was made perfectly evident by them throwing Ball's stats out there without mentioning that he DIDN'T PLAY HALF TWO THIRDS OF THE SEASON.  From the article:    Last year Ball was a distant fourth on the team in rushing, with 55 carries for 172 yards — an average of just 3.1 yards a carry.   ESPN.com stats page shows that he played 5 games in 2014. No shit he was ""a distant fourth on the team"" you fucking hacks."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,aatencio91,5,Mon Jun 22 18:03:17 2015 UTC,Not to mention that he had a GROIN TEAR for each of those 5 games.... he had no business playing. He should have been placed on IR in the pre-season.
DenverBroncos,3apne7,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Mon Jun 22 18:15:26 2015 UTC,Also important to mention that the O-line conveniently decided to get its shit together right after Montee went down in the AZ game.

He is on his rookie contract so there is no value in cutting him, even if you are keeping him to spell or as an insurance policy for CJ.  As for everyone saying he is 1B, that is not necessarily the case. If Kubiak does not want a RB by committee then 1B would be the change of pace back, blocker, pass catcher, and so on... really depends on what he wants to do."

I believe you're being a bit over-exaggerated with your response. I responded to your comment with my own opinion. Hillman was hated this time last year because every opportunity he was given, he fucked up. He was notorious for fumbling the ball at very crucial moments, and people here were reasonably upset with that. Moreno was drafted 12th overall in 2009. He put up okay numbers in 09 and 10, but in 11 he tore his ACL and was put on IR. He was benched in 12 during the second game and didn't return until 8 weeks later...when he finally started acting like a RB who was selected 12th overall, and that of course showed in 13. With Moreno, I think people's patience wore thin. I, too, spend plenty of time in this sub (with a few different usernames), and I didn't see Ball get the kind of hate the other two received. Your previous comment was very negative of this sub, and I pointed that out. People can continue to downvote me, and that's perfectly okay as karma doesn't matter, but all I did was reply to your comment with my own opinions. I'll obviously know better than to do so next time I see something you've posted that I don't agree with.

DenverBroncos,3apne7,Juan_El_Way,-8,Mon Jun 22 19:35:32 2015 UTC,I have seen no evidence that he should be guaranteed a roster spot. What's that? He was great in college? I don't see how that helps us now. He hasn't been all that effective in real life for us.

He looked like TD in college, and the new system Kubiak puts in will support his style.  Anderson will be the clear-cut starter obviously, the man has earned it and I love him. But if given the opportunity, Ball will show why he was worth the 2nd rounder and why he set records in college. Let's hope the 1a and 1b thing pans out and they can both stay healthy for a playoff run."

DenverBroncos,3apne7,Reptar_1221,-2,Mon Jun 22 17:20:20 2015 UTC,"Yes. His 5 YPC beats Hillman's 4.1 and Ball's 3.1. If number of games started was all you needed to measure talent, CJ wouldn't be the guy now."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,jeremywick,1 point,Mon Jun 22 19:37:25 2015 UTC,"But there's a reason why when Montee went down Ronnie got the start, and when Ronnie went down CJ got the start.."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,Reptar_1221,-1,Tue Jun 23 00:29:24 2015 UTC,"And if place on the depth chart was all you need to measure talent, CJ should be 3rd string again. If anything, you just proved that the previous coaching staff did a poor job of evaluating the RB position."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,jeremywick,2,Tue Jun 23 16:53:26 2015 UTC,"All right, I like Juwan, but this is a huge leap. The guy has only carried the ball 54 times and caught the ball 4 times. Thompson was very inconsistent, with more games below 4 YPC than above."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,mysterious_pube,-3,Mon Jun 22 17:23:38 2015 UTC,"HEY YOU! THE ONLY ALLOWABLE OPINION OF BALL ON /r/denverbroncos IS THAT HE JUST HAD AN OWIE LAST YEAR AND TEMPORARILY FORGOT HOW TO YARDAGE! FURTHERMORE, WE MUST ALL EXPECT HIM TO PUSH CJ AS STARTER AND FOR BOTH THEM TO GAIN 1000 YD IN 2015. ALL OTHER OPINIONS ARE TANTAMOUNT TO TREASON SO BOW DOWN, ACCEPT THE DOWNVOTES AS PENITENCE, AND BEG ELWAY HAVE MERCY ON UR SOUL!"
DenverBroncos,3apne7,mack2nite,-15,Mon Jun 22 16:59:41 2015 UTC,God i hope so. He literally has dropped the ball every year so far.
DenverBroncos,3apne7,greene1911,2,Mon Jun 22 14:54:23 2015 UTC,His rookie season was fine. 559 yards 4.7 avg and 145 yards receiving.  Only played 5 games last season most of which were when the offensive line was struggling and before the offense was switched up to focus on the run. Also I think he played in a zone-blocking scheme at Wisconsin so the new offense might be a better fit. As he is still on his rookie contract it would be pretty dumb to cut him without a pretty damn good reason.
DenverBroncos,3apne7,blahrx,-6,Mon Jun 22 15:46:25 2015 UTC,But he fumbles way too much! Especially in situations where we can't afford to get a turnover.
DenverBroncos,3apne7,greene1911,3,Mon Jun 22 16:22:45 2015 UTC,"600 yards in the last two years and 4 fumbles. 2 in the redzone. Cj anderson, 1100 yards and 1 fumble"
DenverBroncos,3apne7,greene1911,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:19:07 2015 UTC,"Cj Anderson did a good job holding on to the ball. However I'm not saying he is better than Cj Anderson. I'm saying I don't think he is  going to be cut. Let's compare the career fumble ratings of the rest of the running backs.   Ronnie Hillman: 5 fumbles on 246 carries for a rating of about 2%  Juwan Thompson: 1 fumble on 54 carries for a rating of about 1.85%  Montee Ball: 3 fumbles on 175 carries for a rating of about 1.71%  So Montee Ball hasn't been any more fumble prone than 2/3 of the other backs on the roster that have carries for the Broncos.  Note: Jeremy Stewart also has 0 career fumbles but only 33 attempts, and Kapri Bibbs has 0 attempts."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,blahrx,0,Mon Jun 22 22:02:46 2015 UTC,Shhhhhhh. Your facts have no place here!  Ball is a football god! Because of reasons!
DenverBroncos,3apne7,Quiggibub,2,Mon Jun 22 21:24:28 2015 UTC,"he fumbled 3 times his rookie season. that isn't anywhere close to bad for a rookie, or hell even a vet."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,crueg,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:07:59 2015 UTC,Terrell Davis fumbled on average a lot more than Ball does. The only reason people think Ball fumbles so much is because he has in crucial times. Get your facts straight.
DenverBroncos,3apne7,rileysill32,0,Tue Jun 23 04:13:52 2015 UTC,"You guys can downvote me all you want but the fact is we got ball on a rookie contract and he has gotten outshined by other players. Hillman and cj mostly. Until he starts kicking butt and earning a starting position i dont see a reason to have him sitting on the bench. He is still a valuable player, we could trade him and get a decent player or pick. Stats dont lie, fumbles are bad. Loose lips sink ships, loose hands lose superbowls...."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,greene1911,-2,Tue Jun 23 06:54:47 2015 UTC,"He isn't going anywhere, but Ball sucks. I would take Hillman, Thompson, and of course CJ ahead of him."
DenverBroncos,3apne7,MTLBroncos,2,Tue Jun 23 03:35:43 2015 UTC,He sucks because he was injured all last year? Solid logic
DenverBroncos,3apne7,RedRiderJman,-4,Tue Jun 23 14:52:50 2015 UTC,He sucked when he was healthy too
DenverBroncos,3apne7,MTLBroncos,-1,Tue Jun 23 15:32:19 2015 UTC,Really he sucked in 2013? Because that was the last time he was healthy. I'm sick of these fair weather fans giving up on guys so damn easily.
DenverBroncos,3apne7,RedRiderJman,-2,Tue Jun 23 16:27:16 2015 UTC,"How am I fairweather for not thinking an unproven player is that good? I don't care how Ball does, I care how the Broncos do. We'll be fine with the rest of the rbs"

DenverBroncos,3aju48,Occams_Lazor_,24,Sat Jun 20 22:15:12 2015 UTC,"I think demaryius helped Sanders look quite a bit better. DT typically drew coverage from the best corners (except Arizona and we all know what happened there) and this helped Sanders. Was he better? I wouldn't say so, DT had a great year until the very end when he was dinged up. That said, Sanders also had a great year but was 200 yards and 2 touchdowns behind DT."
DenverBroncos,3aju48,asdechl,5,Sat Jun 20 23:11:15 2015 UTC,DT had a real rough start to the year. But I don't remember the dinged up at the end part. What was his injury?
DenverBroncos,3aju48,asdechl,4,Sat Jun 20 23:22:30 2015 UTC,"There wasn't anything serious, but he had nagging ankle injuries toward the end of the season and injured a finger catching a pass (looked to be broken but wasn't)"
DenverBroncos,3aju48,crueg,22,Sat Jun 20 23:35:28 2015 UTC,"Overall, I'd say no.  But I do think it's fair to say Sanders showed a lot more heart, spirit and effort than DT at times."
DenverBroncos,3aju48,EnglandCricketFan,7,Sat Jun 20 22:21:36 2015 UTC,"I'd actually say yes.  It's arguable either way, DT had the greater run, and some highlight material because plays were designed for it. Sanders had the better overall consistency, and he took some major punishment to do it willingly. Sanders brought more into every play than DT did."
DenverBroncos,3aju48,Royusmaximus,10,Sat Jun 20 22:46:38 2015 UTC,I don't think DT is playing up to his full potential. He could be better than he is. I think Sanders had a lot more fire in him.
DenverBroncos,3aju48,IMERMAIDMANonYT,6,Sat Jun 20 23:13:29 2015 UTC,Sanders was more consistent over the year  Demaryius playing at his best was definitely better though.  Overall I'd give Demaryius a slight advantage.
DenverBroncos,3aju48,nafrotag,3,Sun Jun 21 03:23:20 2015 UTC,I think a lot of it comes down to DT really is one of the best receivers in the NFL so usually teams would put their best corners on him. A good WR will outperform an Elite WR if Chris Harris is covering the Elite one.
DenverBroncos,3aju48,chronman23,3,Sun Jun 21 05:39:28 2015 UTC,"Bernie ""Emanuel"" Sanders 2016"
DenverBroncos,3aju48,zuulminionofgozer,2,Sun Jun 21 02:32:10 2015 UTC,It's worth mentioning that DT broke the Broncos all time receiving yards in a season record last year and I suspect he was more injured than the team let on.
DenverBroncos,3aju48,RedRiderJman,3,Tue Jun 23 01:30:17 2015 UTC,"Stats aside, Sanders was all in last  year and DT seemed to be phoning it in. Don't get me wrong... I love DT's skills and what he does in this community, but it's a contract year and he's just looking to get paid.  Rewatch Emmanuel take that massive hit last year, pop up, and get crazy pumped up to see what I'm talking about. The man is a Bronco and is working his balls off because he's a player. I hope he breaks 1,200 yards and a dozen scores this year. He deserves it."
DenverBroncos,3aju48,RedRiderJman,1 point,Sun Jun 21 17:51:39 2015 UTC,"Well first off, which Sanders hit do you mean? That guy got blasted all season long. Also lets not discourage what Thomas did, his first few weeks he really could not get past injury and still managed to set a Bronco receiving yards record, as well as tie Megatron's consecutive 100 yard game record. Sure Sanders made the big catches this year, But Demaryius really was the consistent playmaker that I personally want to see at the WR position."

I guess TD and Smith will go down as ""true"" Broncos so maybe I'll leave Smith up there. Also I would switch out Atwater for Bailey."

DenverBroncos,3aev9j,MTLBroncos,1 point,Fri Jun 19 21:18:21 2015 UTC,I look at it this way. When he retires he is going to be remembered as a colt. He should be on their Mount Rushmore not ours unfortunately.

I've been having fun coming up with different scenarios based upon if one team plays up to their ability or tanks for some reason. In one, I had the Cowboys, Giants, and Eagles all going 12-4, 4-2 within the division. Doubt it could happen but I imagine heads would roll..."

DenverBroncos,3aco8b,_Exaybachay_,2,Fri Jun 19 02:09:25 2015 UTC,"It's been a while since I lived in the Denver metro area, but hopefully I can be of some help.  First thing's first, here is a great wiki visitor's guide that should help: https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Denver  Where to eat - I remember a couple of places that I always frequented in Denver were Benny Blanco's and Illegal Pete's.  Illegal Pete's is awesome for burritos, and is also somewhat cheap. I looked and they have a Brother's BBQ off of Arapahoe road and I-25.  Best BBQ I've had anywhere.    Where to play - You have to make it up to the mountains for some fun in the snow.  Can't go wrong with any of the major resorts really, just find one in your price range and have fun!  A-basin was pretty middle-of-the-road if I recall correctly.  Copper was sweet as well but more pricey.  Echo mountain is closer to the foothills, and although it was a small hill I had a lot of fun there.  If you like music, you will have a great time!  I used to love going to open mic nights in Denver to check out some local talent.  There are so many places, I'd say just look up the major ones and see what's going on - Cervantes, BlueBird Theater, Larimer Lounge, Oriental... the list goes on.  Depending on what music you like, some great lesser known bands used to play at the Marquis Theater (Fall of Troy, Portugal. The Man, The Dear Hunter).  Just check the interwebs and have fun!  Where to stay - looks like Courtyard, Embassy Suites, and Hampton are well known, mid-range places.  Check that wiki - I don't have personal experience with this since I was either living there, or staying with friends.  The only time I stayed for work, I was in a Best Western in Castle Rock, and it was plenty good for my standards.  Good luck, and that's awesome that you have an opportunity to check out a Broncos game while you are there!  Should be a very memorable experience, and I am sure you will love it in Colorado.  Cheers!"

DenverBroncos,3a8jax,Corrupted_Engineer,11,Thu Jun 18 01:56:44 2015 UTC,"Even worse, by my calculations, CHJ is getting completely hoed.  With 30 slots left, we still have yet to see:  Peyton, A-A-Ron, Brady, Roethlisberger, Luck, Wilson, Jamaal Charles, Marshawn, Le'Veon Bell, LeSean McCoy, Demarco Murray, Megatron, Dez, Antonio Brown, DT, Jordy Nelson, Gronk, Joe Thomas, JJ Watt, Suh, Justin Houston, Luke Kuechley, Thomas Davis, Darelle Revis, Richard Sherman, CHJ, Joe Haden, Vontae Davis, Patrick Peterson, Earl Thomas, and Devin McCourty.  That's 31 by my count, assuming I haven't unduly forgotten anyone, which I probably have. As the top 100 is basically a popularity contest, and CHJ is still kind of under the radar, I see him as the odd one out on this list. He certainly deserves to be there, but my guess is he gets hoed yet again.  I've thought way too hard about this. I miss football."
DenverBroncos,3a8jax,primordial_soup,8,Thu Jun 18 02:39:40 2015 UTC,"Vontae has already been listed, so maybe your top 30 will make the cut!"

DenverBroncos,3a8jax,WoahThatsMyPecker,2,Thu Jun 18 06:19:08 2015 UTC,I figured he would be top 25 at least! So does this mean DT and CHJ are top 30??
DenverBroncos,3a8jax,Fridden,4,Thu Jun 18 02:26:07 2015 UTC,I have a feeling CHJ is going to get snubbed to somebody like Patrick Peterson or Haden. I definitely think he should be up there over them though.
DenverBroncos,3a8jax,WoahThatsMyPecker,5,Thu Jun 18 03:19:43 2015 UTC,I don't mind people putting Haden above him since Haden is really damn good. I just don't think PP is a top 5 corner while Haden is.
DenverBroncos,3a8jax,Fridden,4,Thu Jun 18 07:29:24 2015 UTC,"I can understand the argument to put Haden over CHJ, didn't mean to discredit him. I just would personally put CHJ over Haden and definitely over PP after this last season."
DenverBroncos,3a8jax,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Thu Jun 18 08:17:38 2015 UTC,Me too I would take CHJ over both but I understand Haden sorta. No way anyone in their right mind would take PP. Dude is crazy athletic that's the only just he does better.

DenverBroncos,3a8jax,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Thu Jun 18 22:49:39 2015 UTC,That just goes to show the offensive nature of the game I guess. One of the best defenders in the league and gets rated at 33

They'd line up, Peyton would point to his block, and he'd execute. I vaguely remember a few missed time blocks, but nothing that lost them a game, or put Manning in a outright dangerous situation (looking at you Hillman).

DenverBroncos,3a6de7,crueg,0,Wed Jun 17 17:02:10 2015 UTC,So do you view Kubiak in the same light as the 1990's version of Mike Shanahan?
DenverBroncos,3a6de7,crueg,2,Wed Jun 17 17:10:36 2015 UTC,"A little bit, mostly because of the situation. Older QB, revered as one of the greatest, but often criticized for his 'inability to win the big games', a rising star at RB, a defense that wasn't living up to it's potential. A lot of it looks familiar"

DenverBroncos,3a6de7,Danserud,1 point,Thu Jun 18 20:37:03 2015 UTC,"That wasn't the gist of that article though.  It was about thinking the Broncos WILL win the super bowl, but if they don't, these are likely the reasons why.  Every team has zits on their face. Even the Patriots last year did and the Seahawks the year before. Every team has weaknesses that are pointed out at the beginning and end of ever season.  The article said twice that the Broncos would win the SB, but if they don't, these are likely the reasons why. So not speculation about how the season goes down, more like an honest evaluation about the holes that exist and that the Broncos need to address them."

If we had him on this team for the last 3 years, I feel it would have been majorly different... and not just because our MLB would be older than shit."
DenverBroncos,3a2jyo,bcos4life,12,Tue Jun 16 19:17:13 2015 UTC,"That's butterfly effect stuff.  Maybe the play that T.D. got hurt on never happens, and yes... we win a third. But it isn't like we went from an Air it Out offense to a ground n' pound. T.D. would have gotten the same workload."
DenverBroncos,3a2jyo,Fridden,5,Tue Jun 16 19:15:28 2015 UTC,But if Elway stayed perhaps TD doesn't get hurt on an INT play.

Half of winning titles is good luck, and we ran into so much good luck in that two year span regarding who we were able to sign, who we could keep, and who was injured. Three-peats have proven impossible because eventually all the things that haven't gone wrong, merely by the law of averages, eventually will. I think that was our downfall more than retirements, just all the bad luck coming home to roost."
DenverBroncos,3a2jyo,greywolf2155,2,Wed Jun 17 05:57:46 2015 UTC,"Yup, luck played in to the matchup against the Falcons instead of the Vikings in Super Bowl 33 (thank you Gary Anderson). I'm uneasy about a game against the Vikings that year. Even more so against the ""Greatest-Show-on-Turf"" Rams the following year."
DenverBroncos,3a2jyo,greywolf2155,2,Wed Jun 17 17:08:55 2015 UTC,"Oh shit I totally forgot that's who we would have played.  Yeah holy shit, that would have been a hell of a game . . . don't know if we could have won that"
DenverBroncos,3a2jyo,bgzlvsdmb,5,Thu Jun 18 18:01:28 2015 UTC,"Realistically?  No.  I can't say that we would.  Simply because winning the Super Bowl is really goddamn hard to do  Even if Elway returned and still had the magic, even if Griese never throws that interception that caused TD to get injured, even if everything fell into place and we were the best team in the league in '99 . . . how often does the best team in the league fail to win the Super Bowl?  Pretty damn often.  I do think the best team in the league won the last two years, but that's honestly not very common  Even if the Broncos had been the best team in the league with an amazingly talented roster . . . I can't give better than even odds of winning a Super Bowl.  That's just how this league works"
DenverBroncos,3a2jyo,ogbroncosfan,3,Thu Jun 18 18:04:45 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I find that the best part of Elway's lasting legacy is that he knew when to walk away, and he walked out on top. If he stuck around one more year and failed to get a third ring, he'd be put into that category of ""Stayed around too long"". Yes, with that team it was possible, but definitely not a guarantee."

DenverBroncos,3a39pb,powersty,4,Sat Jun 20 17:54:13 2015 UTC,"The thing with Mathis is even if he comes in and picks up our system fast enough to play at his best before the season, would he out perform Garland and Smith at guard by 5+ million. Or would we rather use the money on keeping our own talents? I think the difference between him and the next guy wouldn't be enough and we should worry about locking up D.T."
DenverBroncos,3a39pb,Sienna_Crush,8,Wed Jun 17 03:14:42 2015 UTC,I think Mathis at his worst is 5m more valuable than Garland and Smith. I hope I'm wrong.

If Smith or Garland are at least average then it's hard to say Mathis is worth an extra 5-6 million just for better guard play. Especially when you consider that that money could be the difference in keeping on of our own emerging talents for another year."

DenverBroncos,3a15js,Dbencomo19,7,Tue Jun 16 12:28:29 2015 UTC,"Reading through this, it sounds like we have an excess of secondary, wide receiver, and edge rush talent. Our running backs are holding their own. Manning remains efficient in the hurry up. Great. But it still sounds like the o-line is a major concern, Osweiler threw more touchdowns to the defense than the offense, and our kickers are fighting for ""who sucks less"" rather than ""who's the best?"". I hope this Schmidtz guy continues to hold his own, because letting Colquitt go will open up a good amount of cap space to bring in some help along the lines. As big of a concern as our o-line is who is going to play nose tackle. I'm not hearing good things about Sly. Anything good sounds ambiguous or forced. Maybe this Kilgo guy could be the answer, there were whispers of him being a quiet value add. In summation, we still need o-line/nose tackle help, OTA's reminded me of our place kicker concerns, Colquitt is eating too much salary, our secondary/edge rush is nasty, and we are screwed if Manning goes down from a blindside hit allowed by a rookie left tackle."
DenverBroncos,3a15js,penance25,2,Tue Jun 16 18:52:35 2015 UTC,"Hopefully Schmidtz turns it up a notch so we can release Colquitt and maybe pull in Mathis for cheap, start knocking down 2 problems with 1 stone."

DenverBroncos,3a15js,penance25,2,Tue Jun 16 20:52:06 2015 UTC,"Cutting Colquitt will free up 3M of cap space, I believe."
DenverBroncos,3a15js,Danserud,1 point,Tue Jun 16 22:15:59 2015 UTC,"So that would put us at around 9 mil in cap space? Meh, that's enough room, isn't it? Of course we're still screwed for edge rushers, but you can't have everything, I guess."

I think a lot of it will be caused by struggling into a new system, so most of our losses will be early in the year. Getting to the AFC Championship game is legitimately reasonable. Depending on who we face, I could foresee a Super Bowl appearance.  Offense will struggle early on, but I think we'll pick it up mid-year. Our defense under Wade Phillips will be in top 3 in points allowed (more important than yards in my opinion).

He's getting very comfortable with what GK wants him to do. But he also let Peyton loose to do what he wants which he excels at.   To me that means our offense might have multiple looks next season. At times we are going to run GK's offense and at times it will be every bit as explosive as ever.   CJ has the top spot and it's his position to hold onto. He is looking for the guy who can be three downs and CJ is very bright when it comes to protection. But Montee and Hillman have both had excellent offseasons.   It's going to be an interesting camp with a ton of position battles going on, and a very talented roster."
DenverBroncos,39zoop,PMeist,8,Tue Jun 16 02:52:11 2015 UTC,"Two things can happen with the line, I think  1) the line crumbles due to inexperience/lack of top tier talent, fails to protect Manning and we lose a lot  2) Kubiak works his magic, produces a good line from spare parts and we contend again  I gotta say, Chris Clark working at right tackle and Schofield not in either spot is incredibly scary to me. Scho should be starting by now, and the fact that Chris Clark, who had just a really terrible year last year on the right, is a bad sign for his development IMO. Ideally the tackles would be he and Ty I think."

DenverBroncos,3a0os6,NapTaker500,-4,Wed Jun 17 23:52:27 2015 UTC,"This guy is getting shredded in the comments, as he deserves. What's funny is the Seahawk homers defending their #2 spot, when they've got Lynch and a whole lotta meh behind him. Hell even KC should be higher, as Jamaal Charles is the best RB they've had since Priest Holmes and Knile Davis is probably one of the best #2 RBs in the league.   As for us, I'd place us top 5-ish. CJ Anderson, if he plays like he did last season will be a top 5, if not top 3 RB. He plays with all the hallmarks of a potentially elite RB (hands, agility, vision, acceleration, and sheer toughness). And he has the perfect build for a RB - on the small side by NFL standards, but dense with a low center of gravity. Tall running backs get brought down too easily, and light ones down have that bowling ball-like momentum needed to take hits and break tackles.    Ball could probably start on half the NFL teams, and would have acquitted himself much better last year if he actually got some blocks. I worry about his vision/elusiveness but the fundamentals are there. And Ronnie Hillman is the kind of running back that will just get better and better if his body holds out. And Juwan Thompson shows tons of promise, if not in some ways more than both Ball and Hillman.   Point is, our RB corps has serious starting talent and solid depth, as well as diversity. A rank of #13 is a confession of ignorance."
DenverBroncos,3a0os6,PMeist,7,Tue Jun 16 09:03:38 2015 UTC,"Top 3 is ridiculous for us. Top 10 is right around where we should be for now. A lot of teams have 'premier' RB's that we just do not have. You can't compare CJ to an AP, Shady, Forte, Charles, etc. I think a few of the higher teams deserve to be switched.  I could see us being ahead of #12 San Diego with - Melvin Gordon, Oliver, Woodhead, and Brown. As well as #11 Indy with - Gore, Herron, Ballard.   We should be 11th really based on these silly rankings. But the thing about it is we have far more potential than most teams in the RB department. But saying top 5 is absurd."
DenverBroncos,3a0os6,Jkoy,4,Tue Jun 16 11:08:38 2015 UTC,I think top 5 is way to bias rating.  Outside of the top 10 sounds just right.

Being in Red country I am still able to watch all of the Broncos games without having a TV sub or any fancy packages.  Here's what I did.  I went to Best Buy and bought a Slingbox M1.  We have an extra cable box that never gets used downstairs, so I hooked it up to that.  I'm able to get all of the channels that my parents get and it streams in pretty decent HD quality as well.  I am able to watch it on my computer, iphone/ipad while I work on some Sundays, or I have a Roku stick that I am able to stream it directly to on my TV which I do 95% of the time.  Streaming quality is great for what it is.  Sometimes I'll miss a chunk of a play due to a buffer, but its worth not having to pay for an expensive package.  I realize its not the best solution for everyone, and may be impossible for some.  But if you have a buddy/family member who has cable service you could try to ask them to get an extra box for a couple bucks a month for the season and hook up the Slingbox to that.  I've read a couple of people doing it this way and it seems to work good.  Anyways, thought I would throw that out there.  If anyone has any questions about it I would be more than happy to answer."
DenverBroncos,39uhoy,nooberjuice,2,Sun Jun 14 23:16:47 2015 UTC,"I do the same thing with my folks' home in Montana.  The Broncos are our home team so we get the games every weekend.  I'm sure this would work for anyone with access to a friend or family in the broncos home network.  The slingbox is on a rarely used cable box in the basement.  It's setup is pretty straight forward.  I would recommend using RGB component cables between the cable box, sling box, and TV to avoid any issues with HDCP DRM.  Also, slingboxes seem to be somewhat temperamental.  Power cycling the device fixes this issue.  However, instead of calling and asking for a restart, the slingbox is connected to a power source through a timer outlet.  It performs a daily restart at like 3 AM.

DenverBroncos,39nux2,my79spirit,15,Sat Jun 13 02:26:51 2015 UTC,"'05 Broncos, one of my favorite all time squads.    Rod Smith  Mike Anderson  Jake Plummer  Jason Elam  Tom Nalen  D.J. Williams  Al Wilson  Champ Bailey   Darrent Williams (RIP)  Trevor Pryce  AFC Championship game, home field advantage.  Heavily favored by every oddsmaker to win the super bowl.    People focus on the disappointment of not bringing home that championship, but the season as a whole was full of epic comebacks - none better than Sep 18th vs the Chargers.  Broncos had played terribly for the first 6 quarters of the season, and after being boo'ed off the field in Mile High, Champ came out from the locker room and immediately put us back in the game with a Rivers pick-6, then Plummer ignored chants of ""Van Pelt"" while driving down the field to leave Elam with 9 seconds left to win the game.    I don't know what Kubiak or Shanahan said, but that halftime changed the attitude of the team for the rest of that glorious 13-3 season."
DenverBroncos,39nux2,painaulevain,10,Sat Jun 13 07:42:44 2015 UTC,Champ Bailey picking Tom Brady in that playoff game is one of my favorite Broncos moments of all time
DenverBroncos,39nux2,bender0877,3,Sat Jun 13 12:34:47 2015 UTC,Would've been a pick 6 if not for the superhuman effort of Benjamin Watson to chase Champ down.
DenverBroncos,39nux2,caesarfecit,2,Sat Jun 13 15:46:45 2015 UTC,Agreed. That was the best roster and the best year between the '98 Broncos with Elway and the '13 Broncos with PFM. That AFC Conference final tho...heartbreaker.

DenverBroncos,39o5vb,comingatchaboi,2,Sat Jun 13 05:08:37 2015 UTC,"A 33 year old lineman probably wouldn't hold up all season in a zone blocking scheme. Needs agility, and there's a reason the Eagles just let him go instead of trading."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Greeney494,5,Sat Jun 13 05:12:58 2015 UTC,"You're right, he is older and we don't know why the eagles let him go. However, would you prefer him or Garland starting? I know he isn't a long term solution but we aren't looking for a long term solution right now, at least I don't think so. As we all know we have an ever smaller window to get the ship back to Denver and I think adding Mathis for a year or two would be worth it."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,comingatchaboi,2,Sat Jun 13 07:01:25 2015 UTC,"I think the Broncos are over this so called ""window"". That seems pretty evident by their somewhat tame approach to free agency this year, as well as their draft choices. While they're definitely focusing on this year and getting the most out of a fading quarterback, they aren't going to endanger the future by signing big time names that may be around for 2 seasons at the most."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Greeney494,0,Sat Jun 13 13:39:04 2015 UTC,"I don't think they are over it at all. They signed Antonio Smith and Vance walker, are those guys you build around?  I understand what you mean though, I feel a similar way. Whether we win it all or get bounced this year I hope Peyton retires because we really need to see what we have in Brock so we can move on or draft someone else. But I think going all in and making our line better by overpaying a guy is worth the risk at this point."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,comingatchaboi,6,Sat Jun 13 16:15:07 2015 UTC,"He was PFFS 2nd rated guard last year and it was in a zbs. Also, he's a 3 sigma athlete which is insane. He would be perfect for a 2 year deal with Kubiak"
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,ktsmyth,0,Sat Jun 13 17:47:07 2015 UTC,And Chip Kelly let such a good player go for free because....?
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Greeney494,4,Sat Jun 13 19:57:35 2015 UTC,"I think it was because of his contract, not because of his performance."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Bilyman,1 point,Sat Jun 13 20:47:05 2015 UTC,"If it truly wasn't his performance, the Broncos should absolutely inquire. I just find it tough to believe that his contract is why the Eagles let go a left tackle people think you can build lines around, when their starting QB is is missing both his ACL's. A left tackle seems pretty important there.  And if he's so good in the zone blocking scheme, again, it seems like a contract wouldn't be that big of an issue.   Also, Chip Kelly made it known he had been on the trade block for years, and no one offered something good enough? He couldn't have been worth much if the Eagles just let him walk.  Something just doesn't seem right there."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Greeney494,2,Sat Jun 13 21:23:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I see where you're coming from and I agree. I think Kelly did in fact call Mathis and let him know that he was letting him go so Mathis could ""see if he could get what he's looking for"" or something like that."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Bilyman,2,Sat Jun 13 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"He's probably the best guard in the league, and played like it in half of the games he played last year.  He's not a player you build a line around, because he's 33 years old. The Eagles didn't wanna pay a 33 year old more than he was getting, and voila, one of the best guards in the league is now on the market."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,MyFavoriteLadies,1 point,Sat Jun 13 22:42:07 2015 UTC,Chip Kelly's run blocking scheme relies on a lot of zone concepts and pulling guards.

He was the 2nd best guard in the NFL and probably will stay in that area for another year or two.   I understand we need to lock up guys like DT and Von, but this is almost a too good to be true situation."
DenverBroncos,39o5vb,Fridden,2,Sat Jun 13 12:39:20 2015 UTC,"That is a fucking steal at $5m a year. He would be 35 at the end of the contract, it would be perfect."

DenverBroncos,39kt4q,leechsucka,8,Fri Jun 12 15:07:07 2015 UTC,Excellent point.
DenverBroncos,39kt4q,Good2Go5280,1 point,Fri Jun 12 15:44:35 2015 UTC,"Agreed on the sensationalism (I hate BR and feel a bit dirty for having posted a link to one of their articles).   But brain injuries are different than body injuries in many ways so I think the league does have a responsibility to treat them differently (e.g. with an overt policy) rather than simply letting economics sort it out. Furthermore, the comparison to an ACL tear is not a perfect analogy. For one thing, concussion risk itself is not primarily related to the integrity of the player's brain (c.f. integrity of joint structures in things like repeated ACL tears) but rather to the forces that act upon the head. So Welker is not necessarily more likely to sit out more games in a season than whatever receiver replaces him, as the concussion risk stems mostly from the force/physics of the hit, whereas structurally weakened tissues typically play more of a role in repeated soft tissue injuries like ACL tears. For concussions the playing time lost is also usually shorter than something like a ligament tear and is mostly determined by league policy. In contrast, the recurring soft tissue injuries that typically kill the careers of waning NFL stars are prone to wipe out entire seasons in one fell swoop and involve generally longer periods physical recovery measured by modalities like ultrasound and performance assessment. The cost of a messed up ACL may be borne by the team through player absence, but the real cost of a concussion is usually borne by a player, sometime long after they retire.  On the personal side, I bet Welker would have an easier time retiring if he'd been through a few ACL surgeries vs. walking away while he's physically fit for the game but might increase his risk for CTE and other neurological issues by some unknown amount if he takes bad hits that may or may not happen during continued play. In all likelihood, playing more would be bad for his brain, but so much less is known about TBIs that it must be hard for a player (or team) to evaluate the risk vs. reward. The poor guy has become a poster boy for brain injuries in a way that nobody has ever been singled out for soft tissue issues (or brain issues, and we know that a number of NFL players have had very serious brain issues). Given that the league injury reports contain roughly 100-150 concussions per year (source: PBS Frontline), I imagine Welker isn't the only guy whose brain has been bounced around enough to create significant long-term risk. And I bet there are others who've sat out comparable playing time for concussions. Suffering concussions in quick succession during a very successful season put him in the limelight and I think teams are staying away from him not because of the risk that he'll sit out games, but because of the PR risk (which really doesn't happen with ""typical"" sports injuries like ligament tears).  TL;DR: I think Welker is unsigned for PR reasons, not economic reasons and not because anyone in the NFL is looking out for him. If the repetitive concussion issue is bad enough to make a guy like Welker untouchable, then then NFL needs to step up and do something concrete about it."

I personally would prefer to see him retire just out of concern for his safety, but more than anything I hope that's something he gets to decide for himself.

DenverBroncos,39kt4q,Fridden,2,Sat Jun 13 00:53:16 2015 UTC,"This came across my news feed this morning. As much as I hate BleacherReport, I tend to agree with the point they belabor in this particular piece (that Welker is now untouchable in the NFL because of his concussion history). It does seem a bit unfortunate that the league is just quietly backing away from a stand-up guy like Welker. I think a forced retirement would be a lot more humane if the league had an overt policy on repetetive head injury."
DenverBroncos,39kt4q,ilyearer,1 point,Fri Jun 12 12:55:26 2015 UTC,"It makes sense to do, but it is unfortunate.  He's such a good player.  But you also got the sense that he'd happily explode on the field if duty called for him to do so, and in this case, the financial risk he poses in terms of having to miss games due to being ""prone"" to concussions with certain hits may end up the thing that helps keep him healthy.    I agree with the need for a policy on repeated head injuries.  The money and drive are variables that I think mess with a player's ability to make the right choice for themselves sometimes - not to mention that the injuries themselves can mess with a player's decision making."
DenverBroncos,39kt4q,ilyearer,0,Fri Jun 12 18:24:58 2015 UTC,"I disagree with that kind of policy.  It seems counterproductive, to me, to base it on some kind of normalized average number of concussions - it's only going to be the appropriate number for a small percentage of people.  Other people will have their careers cut short unfairly - or worse, think they can continue playing because of it.    Plus, if there is some kind of hard number, it's going to encourage people to hide symptoms again.  While it's definitely not infallible and still subject to bad influences, people's individual situation being evaluated by the doctors directly connected to the player is - just in my opinion - the best bet."
DenverBroncos,39kt4q,_____--_-_-_-__-,2,Fri Jun 12 18:31:06 2015 UTC,"Assuming concussion risk has a normal distribution in NFL players, the ""average"" (+/- 1 SD) would actually contain the greatest number of players along the bell curve.  Now if it follows a poisson distribution, then yes, the average would be a problem - probably the median would be better.  Hiding symptoms/injury is also a good point - but as we know from Peyton's torn quad last year, it's done irrespective of what the doctor's eval might be too."
DenverBroncos,39kt4q,flynryan692,0,Fri Jun 12 21:33:13 2015 UTC,"Perhaps someday in the not too distant future there will be some empirical basis for figuring this out. Concussion reporting is so new now that even unsigned Welker has very few official concussions on his record, and the guys who are known to have suffered the terrible effects of CTE don't have good concussion counts (nor do the other ex-NFL guys whose autopsies have contributed to CTE research). Unfortunately I think it'll be a long while before there's enough data available to make a statistically reasonable policy. Still, it seems better to cut careers short unduly than to perpetuate a CTE problem. After all, career ending injuries happen all the time in the NFL. I'd be down with individual evaluation if neurologists were able to predict long-term effects, but again the science just isn't there yet."

At this point before training camp teams can have up to 90 players under contract. Their info is considered accurate.  Here´s something more from the site founder  Most teams in the NFL should be able to afford Mathis to play for them. Since he is closer to the end of his career, he would likely do a short term deal and teams could extend bonus prorations out over five years by using void provisions. I would guess if you have $2 million in cap room you can make the deal work.  The only teams in the NFL that would really be hard pressed to make a move would be the Saints and Chiefs."

DenverBroncos,39hbyx,vonwarewolf,2,Thu Jun 11 19:42:05 2015 UTC,"Yup, for example Barth is known to be a very accurate kicker, however as he has shown throughout his career, not an insanely powerful one. (I believe he kicked a 50 yarder or 2 this year, but I digress) On his kickoffs, he barely is able to hit the endzone typically, let alone boot it out of bounds for the touchback, typically the safer option. Punter, while you want them to be accurate to be able to pin the opponents down deep in their own zone, are typically more for power and field position, especially if they're punting from their own endzone. Schmitz has shown to be a very powerful kicker, and so assuming what I projected comes true, will likely punt and kick off, while Barth (the accurate one) will kick field goals and extra points."

DT is a top 10 receiver. Without Peyton he might drop to Top 15. He does not under any circumstance deserve the money of one of the most supremely talented and productive receivers of all time.   Take a lesson from Chris Harris. Get more guaranteed at a fair number so the team can actually field something competitive.   Also what a bunch of bullshit earlier in the year.

Maybe DT is ""only"" a top 10 receiver, but he'll be paid like a top 3 receiver.  While it's appreciated what Harris did, it should not be the norm.

DenverBroncos,39gbr7,caileangrey,79,Thu Jun 11 15:10:57 2015 UTC,"The Broncos struggle during the regular season, and only barely make the playoffs as a wild card team.   In the Wild Card round, they beat the Ravens in a close one, winning in regulation on a game winning drive that ends in a 40 yard bomb to DT. 42-38.  They beat the Colts in the divisional round. Handily. Peyton goes 25/30, 275 yards, 4 TDs, 0 Ints. Luck goes 20/43, 200 yards, 2 TDs, 2 Ints. CJ Manderson also runs for 150 and a couple of scores. 42-17.  They roll into Foxboro for the Conference title. Peyton struggles at first and the Pats take an early lead at halftime. It's 21-0. Wade makes some halftime adjustments, and Von, Ware, and Jackson combine for 7 sacks in the second half, including a sack-fumble recovered for a Broncos touchdown. Peyton leads the offense to a stellar second half and a comeback. Broncos win 35-28.  Super Bowl time. The Seachickens have made it for a third straight year. Peyton and the Broncos are prepared this time. Their offense is balanced and the D is able to contain Wilson's rushing ability. It's a closely contested game until halftime. The Broncos come out during the second half with a vengeance. Peyton finishes the game 31/42, 500 yards, 5 TDs, and 0 Int. Anderson and Juwan Thompson combine for 250 rush yards and 4 TDs. Chris Harris gets a pick six. Kapri Bibbs, our new return man, takes a punt return to the house. Final score: 77-14."
DenverBroncos,39gbr7,CharlesDeBalles,30,Thu Jun 11 15:29:35 2015 UTC,"LOL 77-14.  I like your basic outline, but I would go with these small changes:  Broncos make the playoffs as a 10-6 Wild Card team.  They get the bad draw:  traveling in the first round to Foxoboro to face off against a still very formidable 11-5 Patriots.  The Patriots, seeking revenge for their regular season spanking at Mile High, come out hard and are leading at the half 21-7.  But the second half is uncharacteristic for them:  the Denver defense forces three turnovers, and the Broncos come out on top, 35-27.    The Divisional Round sees the Broncos traveling to face the Ravens, who upset the Chargers the week before.  Everyone is geared up for another classic between these two franchises, and it fails to materialize:  the Broncos destroy the Ravens 38-14.    The AFCCG is one of the most hyped in recent memory:  the Luck-lead 13-3 Colts are looking to get to the Super Bowl by hosting the Broncos in the house that Peyton built.  The game lives up to its billing, with the Broncos coming out on top, 27-24.    The Super Bowl pits the Broncos against a red hot Seahawks team that few expected to make back to the Super Bowl, overcoming Chip Kelly's supremely confident Eagles in the NFCCG.  The sports press is disappointed:  a bad matchup on paper plus recent history suggests that the Seahawks will not be thwarted two years in a row, and what looked like an improbable ride off into the sunset will instead result in yet another disappointing ending for Manning.  The beginning of the game unfolds just as everyone but Seahawks fans fear:  Peyton looks shaky and is forcing things, and the Hawks go up 10-0 in the first quarter, capitalizing on a Manning interception.  By the second quarter things have settled, however, and the Denver offense methodically moves the ball, while the Denver D keeps Wilson in check.  At the half the two teams are knotted at 13.  The second half is furiously played, and though there isn't a lot of scoring, there is a lot of action.  With 2:43 left to play, the Seahawks are leading 24-20, and have just gotten the ball back after making a crucial stop.  Denver still has all three timeouts, and so the Seahawks have to get at least one first down.  On 3rd and 6 from their own 38, Russell Wilson drops back to pass and is flushed out by Shane Ray.  As he rolls to his right, Von Miller closes in and strip sacks him—Broncos ball at the Seahawks 32 with 1:28 to play!  In a quick combination of perfectly called plays mixing an amazing Manning to DT connection and CJ Anderson carrying three defenders across the first down marker, the Broncos find themselves 1st and goal at the 3 yard line with :18 left in the ball game.  The Broncos are now out of timeouts, and Peyton lines up in the shotgun.  This is the pre snap movement and communication we have come to know and love—complex, barking, arm-waving, pointing, moving people around.  With 8 seconds on the play clock Peyton checks into a power run play.  Oh fuck, this is it.  FUCK.  The ball is snapped, Virgil Green rockets straight ahead, knocking a gap-shooting Earl Thomas backward; CJ Anderson charges forward with grim determination, plowing into the line...  ...And Peyton Manning has just won Super Bowl 50."

Peyton gives his little brother a hug after the game, Eli says ""I'll get you next time"".  Then Super Bowl 51 is another Broncos v. Giants Manning Bowl, with another Broncos win.

I'm magically sitting in the first row of the south stands and chuck a bud light like a bullet to Peyton's open hand and he downs it.

Harris, Talib, and Roby all intercept Flacco.  The Broncos step into Nee England, where the Patriots come out swinging against the deflated secondary of Denver, exhausted from all the intercepting the week before. 21-6 at halftime, the Patriots come out too cocky in the second half, resulting in complacency by both offensive and defensive lines, allowing Von, Ray, Ware, and Jackson to notch a sack and a half each (not counting their first half stats). But Derek Wolfe's strip sack and recovery leads to Peyton tossing a 36 yard score to CJ Anderson on a play similar to his big catch and run versus Oakland. This sets off a huge influx of scores, Denver finishing the game 48-28.  Then they handily beat the Seahawks, reeling from the Jimmy Graham injury. 43-8."

DenverBroncos,39gu6f,Zweems,4,Thu Jun 11 17:12:23 2015 UTC,Juwan the Tank Engine   Surely Thompson the Tank Engine works better?  But I'd say this will be our Running Back depth chart.   CJ Anderson Montee Ball Ronnie Hillman Kapri Bibbs - Also a returner Juwan Thompson - Moved to Full Back (hence 5th) but occasional takes snaps as HB.   Jeremy Stewart is gone.  Ideally however I'd like us to end up with an above what they are worth trade for Ball or Hillman.
DenverBroncos,39gu6f,Ezeran,2,Fri Jun 12 12:50:33 2015 UTC,"The reason I don't want to predict that yet is because Hillman is practically a Justin Forsett clone, physically."

Only 2 in his last 586 touches."
DenverBroncos,39gu6f,PMeist,2,Thu Jun 11 17:24:49 2015 UTC,"This is an entirely new coaching staff so they don't have the 'he's our guy' bias. They haven't drafted any of these players. Elway has. He drafted Hillman, drafted Montee, and signed CJ as well as Bibbs. So the coaching staff is looking for the best 53, as they normally do (or should).   CJ is going to be the starter because he earned it last year with his play. Plus he seems to be a fit for GK. Ball will be the second stringer, but he does need to outperform everyone else. He needs to have a good camp and play better than Hammer Pound and Bibbs.   But I do see Hammer Pound and Bibbs making the team and Hillman being out."

DenverBroncos,39dmym,SonicSC,10,Thu Jun 11 01:34:12 2015 UTC,I think in the ZBS you're correct. If it was the old scheme it would still be Hillman. He just doesn't fit the scheme and Bibbs works better in it. Either way they're the 3rd back or possibly 4th if Juwan doesn't shift like people think.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,bmsuperfly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 01:59:09 2015 UTC,This was my thought too. I like Hillman's experience and chemistry he's built up in Manning's offense but in this new system he isn't the best fit and baring injury neither will see the field much anyway.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Sienna_Crush,5,Thu Jun 11 06:17:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah I think Thompson switches to FB. If he doesn't he'll get short yard carries maybe.   C.J. and Ball are built for this scheme though and so is Bibbs, but to a lesser extent. Hillman isn't a horrible RB, but he just has the wrong coach now.   We're set at RBs so nothing to big. I expect C.J. and Ball to dominate the carry numbers."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,bmsuperfly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:20:36 2015 UTC,"And even if Thompson plays a lot of FB he would still probably be the 3rd RB unless we have no one else to play FB. I think Green and Casey would be competent at FB too though so I expect it to just be CJ, Ball, and Thompson getting carries. At least we can keep Bibbs or Hillman on the practice squad if we end up needing the depth."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Sienna_Crush,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:28:51 2015 UTC,"I thought Casey too, but I think he sees more TE snaps with Huer out.   Hillman may have just a sliver of trade value to the right team, but I wouldn't expect it."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,bmsuperfly,1 point,Thu Jun 11 06:33:42 2015 UTC,Really I think it will just be whoever proves to be the best lead blocker of the 3. So probably Green will play the most FB with Daniels at TE. I think Hillman could improve another team needing depth but like you said I wouldn't expect a team to make a trade for a depth RB unless they are dying at RB.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Sienna_Crush,20,Thu Jun 11 07:43:54 2015 UTC,Every time I say something negative about Hillman here I get downvoted but I really didn't think he was very good last year. His stats say otherwise but to me I just loved CJ far more. I really like Juwuan Thompson and Kapri over Hillman.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,PMeist,9,Thu Jun 11 01:42:14 2015 UTC,"hillman definitely looked better this season over previous ones, but I don't think he's anything to get excited about. Trade bait, maybe."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,crueg,5,Thu Jun 11 02:13:27 2015 UTC,"Trade bait, maybe.   Yes, this is what I've been thinking for a while. I'll say this -- having too many viable options at RB in a system designed to make RBs flourish is probably the best kind of problem to have."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,baha24,3,Thu Jun 11 13:10:10 2015 UTC,I think he's more of a release guy than a trade guy.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,dlevine09,2,Thu Jun 11 13:20:50 2015 UTC,"I second that. He could work in a rotation, but he's nothing special. A team will pick him up if he's available, but they won't give up anything for him."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:19:57 2015 UTC,You don't think there are other teams that would like to have him? He's not a bad RB. I just think the other four are better suited to Kubes' system.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,baha24,2,Thu Jun 11 17:20:36 2015 UTC,I do think other teams would like to have him - just don't think they'd trade to do so.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,dlevine09,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:58:06 2015 UTC,I disagree. If you look at some of the desperate teams last year (who lost players to injury during the season); Hillman is a way better choice than some of the players we saw getting picked up last year.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,DJKest,2,Thu Jun 11 20:37:59 2015 UTC,Who would trade for him?  He's on the last year of his contract as a backup RB.  Teams would much rather take a chance on an unknown rookie.
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Decker87,3,Thu Jun 11 15:48:32 2015 UTC,"I love CJ, but part of me wants Juwan to be the man. Something about him last year reminded me of TD. That one cut downhill running style. Now with Kubiak back that can easily become a big part of our offense again."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,JaridT,1 point,Thu Jun 11 11:09:46 2015 UTC,Me too. But I also want Ball to bounce back and be the man. I like all 3 of those guys a lot. (But Ball's definitely on the shortest leash; he's gotta show us something pretty early.)
DenverBroncos,39dmym,JaridT,1 point,Thu Jun 11 17:33:38 2015 UTC,Yeah. I don't think ball's gonna be our guy. Most likely Hillman I'm thinking.  Edit: CJ not Hillman.

DenverBroncos,39dmym,Passion4Flashin,3,Thu Jun 11 08:36:31 2015 UTC,"I feel you. I mean, i only watch him twice a year. And you watch or pay attention in some way to every game. I just always thought he didnt go down easily and was quick as shit"
DenverBroncos,39dmym,solsethop,3,Thu Jun 11 08:42:37 2015 UTC,"I agree, he is fast but doesn't really have moves imo. Might end up being a good one cut guy in the ZBS but who knows he never really impressed me."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Greeney494,3,Thu Jun 11 01:49:51 2015 UTC,You should go back to the beginning of the season and watch games like he had against the Jets and 49ers then
DenverBroncos,39dmym,dgapinski,2,Thu Jun 11 02:55:21 2015 UTC,"He wasn't great in those games though. The only impressive Hillman game was the Chargers one. In the two you mentioned he ran around untouched and I think he had one run against the niners where he actually eluded anyone (it was a nice td scamper, to be fair). Heck, in the Jets game he was lucky to not lose that fumble he had."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Greeney494,4,Thu Jun 11 07:46:23 2015 UTC,"Is a small back supposed to run around and get touched? I'm not saying he has to be your favorite running back, but if he didn't get hurt after his stellar four game stretch, CJ may not have the opportunity he has now. Hillman was having that good of a stretch, and he deserves some credit."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,dgapinski,3,Thu Jun 11 14:51:07 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, he was taken down immediately whenever he did get touched, which happens on the vast majority of plays. And what was the fourth game? Because against the Pats Hillman did jack diddly, completely awful. Also, not just in the run game, but Hillman showed to be a relatively poor receiving option out of the backfield being out of position on routes and dropping passes.  And besides, I did give him credit. I thought he was genuinely good on a run in the 9ers game and was impressive throughout the Chargers game, but that's it and that's all I'm going to give him."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Greeney494,2,Thu Jun 11 14:58:30 2015 UTC,"He had a decent game against Arizona after Ball went down. ANd everyone did jack diddly against the Patriots, that was a terrible game.   Does any of the criticism you have for him stem from back all the way to when he had fumbling issues?"
DenverBroncos,39dmym,dgapinski,4,Thu Jun 11 15:08:47 2015 UTC,"Well, I mean, Calais Campbell went down for the Cardinals conveniently for Hillman when he came in to the game and I think that was more of a factor for our run game in that matchup than Hillman vs Ball. Campbell is one of, if not, the best defender on that team and was doing work until he got taken out.  And of course that factors in a bit in my overall image of the player, but as far as his play last season goes, fumbles only really detract from his Jets performance.  Lastly, I don't hate Hillman or anything, I'd love for him to step up and succeed. I just don't feel like he's done anything to deserve more praise than criticism up to this point."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,Greeney494,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:29:34 2015 UTC,"Besides the fumbles, the Jets game was one of his best games. You talk about how Calais Campbell was the deciding factor for his good game against the Cardinals, the Jets from seven is far far better than the Cardinals, even with Campbell.  I'm not saying Hillman is gonna win the job or that he's better than being third on the depth chart, but he gave the team a spark in the run game it so desperately needed last year."
DenverBroncos,39dmym,leapfrog191,3,Thu Jun 11 16:35:53 2015 UTC,Thompson and Bibbs are great backups for Ball and Anderson but I think Hillman has a different running style that sets him apart and makes him valuable. He has the speed to get outside and is a great change of pace back.

DenverBroncos,39cztp,Amoronic,2,Wed Jun 10 23:42:01 2015 UTC,I bought a No Fly Zone t shirt off of Chris Harris Jr's personal website

DenverBroncos,39cztp,Colorado222,4,Wed Jun 10 23:50:41 2015 UTC,"I really hope they put him on the opposing team's best receiving threat for every game except a few match up exceptions. I want to see him go up against Torry Smith, T.Y. Hilton, Amari Cooper, Nelson, Edelman, Brown, Green, and Allen all game. I think he can do it, and when he does he will put his name up as the best CB in the league. If he can't then he's still a top CB but maybe not the best. The only games where I want Talib on the #1 are Detroit and Chicago. I think Talib's size just makes him a better fit against Calvin Johnson and Alshon Jeffrey.   Our DBs have a perfect opportunity to prove just how good they are this year and I'm stoked."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,Sienna_Crush,3,Wed Jun 10 23:51:29 2015 UTC,"Won't be going against Torrey Smith this season, he's with the 49ers. Unless you mean preseason in which case who cares really. Plus there are actually quite a few good weapons on that offense.  But I agree, I want to see him take on other teams #1's. Megatron is going to be our toughest matchup this season. People are down on him this year because he was injured. But when he's healthy and playing well he's basically unstoppable. Hopefully we get so much pressure on Stafford that he never has an opportunity to look Megatron's way."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,PMeist,1 point,Thu Jun 11 00:06:04 2015 UTC,"I totally forgot he went to the 9ers, Thanks.   Exactly, if the ball is thrown right there really isn't a way to stop Megatron but like you said if we get to Stafford it will take a lot of pressure off. I know Wade will have his own strategy for that game but I wouldn't be surprised to see CHJ locking down Tate by himself and Talib taking Megatron with some safety help."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,Sienna_Crush,2,Thu Jun 11 00:19:33 2015 UTC,"I know Elway has basically said that pass rushers are the most important part of the D. If they can stop the play before it develops, or disrupt it, then no need to worry about Megatron."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,PMeist,3,Thu Jun 11 00:22:33 2015 UTC,i would rather put CHJ on cobb than nelson
DenverBroncos,39cztp,alchupanebra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 02:36:23 2015 UTC,"Physically I think Cobb is a better match up for sure, but Nelson is much more of a threat IMO so I was thinking I'd prefer CHJ on him. Either way they do it though the key to that game will be getting to Rodgers fast and stopping Lacy. Also simply keeping the ball out of Rodgers hands by having long successful drives. He's just to good for any DB to have a chance when he gets time."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,Sienna_Crush,2,Thu Jun 11 02:49:12 2015 UTC,i think talib struggles against smaller faster recievers like against T.Y but i agree they are both great i just think CHJ matches up better against cobb
DenverBroncos,39cztp,alchupanebra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:52:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah I like CHJ's on both of them more than with Talib. It's more just that with Nelsons route running I'd want CHJ's disciplined coverage on him. The best case IMO would be if Roby stepped up even faster and proved he could take someone like Cobb because his speed and physicality would be perfect, especially since Roby knows the slot and that's where Cobb does his work often. That would let Talib guard the bigger Davante Adams."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,Sienna_Crush,3,Thu Jun 11 04:14:53 2015 UTC,"He's the man. One of the most versatile corners in the league if not the most versatile. Even with that being said, Von will always be my favorite defensive player haha"

DenverBroncos,39cztp,IAmALeprechaunAMA,2,Wed Jun 10 23:20:14 2015 UTC,"He's great. I have his jersey on my wall, I go to KU, and I think he's just a really humble guy and a stud. The way he always hustles on the field and pretty much let's his play do the talking, not to mention the hometown discount make him one of my favorite all time Broncos."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,KimonoThief,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:06:20 2015 UTC,"I think we won't really know how good CHJ is until we start putting him in man coverage against opponents' #1 WRs.  I think his reputation is big in part due to PFF's rankings which, frankly, are dogshit.  Football Outsiders Film Room article says that he's done well, but he hasn't been asked to do much since he covers a narrow area of the field in a 7-man zone scheme.  Since Phillips likes to blitz, I'm betting we'll see more and more of CHJ taking receivers 1-on-1.  I'm optimistic but I think the hype train is a little premature."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,KimonoThief,2,Thu Jun 11 03:19:31 2015 UTC,It's alright if you think Broncos fans are too high on Harris. But don't cite that dog shit article. Denver doesn't primarily play zone coverage. Several examples they use in that article is man.
DenverBroncos,39cztp,KimonoThief,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:39:37 2015 UTC,"Hmm alright, guess I just took it at face value since FO seems to look at things logically.  Good to know their film room stuff may not be on point."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,8manjones,1 point,Thu Jun 11 05:42:38 2015 UTC,"yeah FO is usually pretty solid but sometimes it seems like they go in with a pre-determined narrative and will cherry picks things to make it fit  I don't really like the argument that zone corners are less valuable, either. Kinda funny how the guy makes no mention of how the Seahawks mainly play a cover 3 and Sherman is playing zone a good deal, too"
DenverBroncos,39cztp,JaquiskiTaterTartt,1 point,Thu Jun 11 15:29:03 2015 UTC,"The NFL Network ranked him as the third best Corner if I remember right. Maybe second but don't quote me. PFF was based on things like opposing qb rating, yards allowed, touchdowns allowed, catch rate, I think its pretty reliable."
DenverBroncos,39cztp,DefenderCone97,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:26:21 2015 UTC,"PFF is based on a guy watching the tape and grading whether a player was good or bad on a given play.  Often not even the All-22.  Look at some of their weekly player rankings sometime and I think you'll agree they're completely out of whack.  But yeah, it seems that CHJ has been great for what he's been asked to do.  Only question is, will he continue to be great when asked to mirror #1 WR's?"
DenverBroncos,39cztp,DefenderCone97,1 point,Thu Jun 11 03:44:09 2015 UTC,Can someone make a highlight tape of him? There's nothing on YouTube.
DenverBroncos,39cztp,alchupanebra,1 point,Thu Jun 11 20:30:44 2015 UTC,He's an elite corner. The only reason he doesn't get that much attention is because he is short (5-foot-10).
DenverBroncos,39cztp,alchupanebra,1 point,Fri Jun 12 00:17:56 2015 UTC,"I love me some CHJ but i feel we may be a bit biased. He is definitely the 3rd best corner to me. He is close to Revis and Sherman, and what little he is lacking he made up with the home town discount he gave usm"
DenverBroncos,39cztp,according2poo,4,Thu Jun 11 02:00:27 2015 UTC,I understand where you are coming from but I will point out that he went into this season just 6 months after an ACL tear. I would like to see Sherman or Revis do that and pull that kind of a season. The no touchdowns allowed is impressive all alone as well.

He had one good game. 24 carries for 134 yards. His second game he had 1 run for 4 yards. His third and final game he ran 6 times for 10 yards."
DenverBroncos,39bci8,PMeist,3,Wed Jun 10 18:13:17 2015 UTC,"Good point, he only played in like 3 games for them. I don't know what Spizard is even talking about."
DenverBroncos,39bci8,PMeist,13,Wed Jun 10 18:21:48 2015 UTC,"But he's had like 3 torn ACL's in his career dude. It's a trend for him and he's one of the most injured players I can ever remember. I LOVE Knowshon and what he did for our team, especially during our magical 2013 season when he was a beast.   But you don't get to say his injuries are freak accidents when it happens over and over again to him. Some guys are luckier than others when it comes to injures in the NFL.  Had we signed him to a long-term deal it would have been a waste. He got a small deal from Mia knowing that he wouldn't last the season. He will never be able to last a full season and unfortunately it looks like he will never play again. He's been in the league a long time and if he misses a full season here it doesn't look good to ever get signed again."

Anderson  Starters who should be upgraded: Gino Gradkowski, Derek Wolfe, Sylvester Williams  Analysis: Denver is still able to maintain a quality roster around high-priced quarterback Peyton Manning thanks to some smart drafting and having a few key players on very cheap contracts (such as running back Anderson). Outside linebacker Miller and cornerback Harris are elite players at key positions, and the Broncos have found quality players across other important spots like defensive end Jackson.  The concern for this roster is the offensive line, which has become even more acute a problem since Ryan Clady went down this offseason with a season-ending injury. Clady hadn't been playing to his previous level in some time, but rookie Ty Sambrailo out of Colorado State represents a major downgrade as he adjusts to a much higher level of competition. Louis Vasquez now remains the only quality player on what used to be one of the league's better lines."

DenverBroncos,396sok,baha24,45,Tue Jun 9 17:47:12 2015 UTC,"I've got your back, yo    Why a run-first scheme is best for Manning, Broncos  John Elway knows the value of a quarterback in his late 30s changing from a pass-centric to a run-heavy offense. It helped him win two Super Bowls at a time when it appeared he might end his career without a single Lombardi Trophy. This mindset is part of why the Denver Broncos, with Elway making their personnel decisions, want to make significant changes to their offense.  The wild card here is QB Peyton Manning. He has always run a pass-first system and could be reticent to embrace another approach this late in his career. The hesitation would be understandable, but a closer look at the Broncos' scheme and personnel offers a host of reasons why a change in philosophy could be just what Denver needs to win the Super Bowl.  A powerful rushing attack  Last season, C.J. Anderson finished tied for second in the league in my good blocking yards per attempt (GBYPA) metric. This statistic gauges how productive a ball carrier is when opposing teams don't disrupt a rush attempt. GBYPA is a good indicator of a running back's ceiling, so Anderson -- just 186 carries into his career -- has the look of a stud.  The only back to do better than Anderson's 9.9-yard GBYPA mark was Baltimore running back Justin Forsett (11.4). Why is that significant? Forsett's offensive coordinator last season was Gary Kubiak -- the same Gary Kubiak who has since taken over as Denver's head coach.  Kubiak's biggest positive influence on Anderson could be giving the 24-year-old more open space. Last season, Denver placed 25th in my good blocking rate (GBR) metric, which measures how often an offense gives its ball carriers quality running lanes. Kubiak's Ravens tied for 12th in GBR last year, and his Houston clubs finished in the top 10 in each of his final three campaigns with the Texans. Expect Denver to show a significant GBR improvement in 2015.  The Broncos' rushing attack should also benefit from superb depth. In the last five weeks of the 2013 season, Montee Ball posted an 8.8 GBYPA mark (well above the 7.7 leaguewide average) and displayed greatly improved pass-blocking skills. Ball was an elite red zone back at Wisconsin -- a trait that helped him break the Big Ten single-season record for touchdowns -- so Denver could find a role for him as a lead back, an alternate breakaway threat, a goal-line back, or any combination of these roles. Add in the pass-catching skills of Ronnie Hillman, and an argument could be made that Denver has the best running back trio in the NFL.  A dominant defense  Denver's D is no slouch, either. That much is clear after it posted top-flight numbers in a wide variety of categories last season. The Broncos finished second only to Seattle in yards per play (4.7), first in net yards per pass attempt (5.6), fourth in yards per rush (3.7), second in rush yards allowed per game (79.8) and ninth in passing yards allowed per game (225.4).  And remember: This D did it while playing opposite a pass-first offense, which is even more impressive. If the Broncos' rushing game is able to improve Denver's No. 13 ranking in time of possession, that would give the defense a good shot at improving across the board.  Declining vertical pass production  At this stage of his career, you'd hope Manning himself realizes that a run-first attack is both beneficial andnecessary. His play declined sharply in the second half of last season, particularly on vertical throws (11 or more yards downfield). During the first nine weeks his 2014 campaign, Manning's 13.3 vertical yards per attempt ranked fourth. From Weeks 10-17, that number dipped to 10.8, which ranked 15th overall.  During that same span, he also had a league-worst seven bad decisions on vertical passes. (Bad decisions are defined as mental errors made by a passer that lead to a turnover opportunity for the opposing team.) It was a major factor in Manning finishing tied for 25th in vertical interception percentage (6.5 percent) from Weeks 10-17.  To be fair, a portion of the decline in vertical production could be related to his quad injury, but the point remains: Asking a 39-year old quarterback to continue to carry an offense with downfield throws is a recipe for another early playoff exit.  Play-action woes  Some of the issues with vertical production stem from play-action passing woes. In his first two seasons in Denver, Manning was the best play-action passer in the league: He finished first in Total QBR (96.1), yards per attempt (11.7), touchdowns (24) and yards (3,201) and ranked second in completion percentage (67.0).  That play-action production took a big hit last season, as Manning's 80.8 Total QBR on play-action for the season was tied for 11th and his 54.1 Total QBR from Weeks 10-17 ranked 24th. Part of the reason for the dip? Defenses were not honoring the play-action fakes as they had in previous years. A change in philosophy would force defenses to respect the run, freeing Manning to again make big plays with the defense off-kilter.  Bottom line  If Manning goes all-in on this approach, it would give him better passing opportunities and help keep him healthy late into the season. If that happens, it should lead Denver, possibly the most talented team in the AFC, to another Super Bowl berth -- and give Manning a chance to go out on top, just as Elway did."

DenverBroncos,396sok,bcos4life,2,Tue Jun 9 20:57:18 2015 UTC,"I think that this is a complex answer to a simple problem.  We got shit raked by Seattle in the SB because they just rushed four, and held everyone else back in coverage. They had so little respect for our run game that they were willing to let us bust for 5 yards occasionally.   If you force teams to cover the run, you open up the pass."
DenverBroncos,396sok,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:37:14 2015 UTC,One step further- they rushed 4 and still got consistent pressure.

DenverBroncos,396ohb,badcompany1981,2,Tue Jun 9 18:27:09 2015 UTC,"This whole thing makes sense from both sides.  Not sure why the media makes such a big deal out of it.   Broncos probably want to lock him in for 5 year commitment. DT wants to see what Dez Bryant gets to establish going rate and/or get comparable to Megatron's contract.   DT probably looking at Megatron's contract as a starting place. Broncos probably looking at Mike Wallace's contract for the Vikes as a starting place.  Megatron got avg/yr 6.96 million with 48.75 million guaranteed. Mike Wallace got avg/yr 5.4 million with 27 million guaranteed.  If DT does nothing, he's franchise tagged and gets 12.8 million and gets to test the free agency market (IF he stays healthy, he'd do quite well - that's his risk...).  So unless the Broncos are offering something with around 48.75 million guaranteed, why would he do it? Broncos has Peyton for one more season.  Why would you want to sign a WR to a contract as large as Megatron's contract when you're looking at starting a rookie QB next season?  I think DT is destined to play on his franchise tag unless Dez Bryant signs for something the Broncos are willing to do (less than Megatron's contract)."
DenverBroncos,396ohb,codepoet2,2,Tue Jun 9 19:39:19 2015 UTC,"contract when you're looking at starting a rookie QB next season?   Because we aren't starting a rookie QB next season. After restructuring his contract, Peyton said he still intends to play out his contract. Obviously that all depends on his health at the end of the season and I think a SB win could have an affect too, but for right now we are going to have Peyton for a year following this. Also, the lobster isn't a rookie ;)"
DenverBroncos,396ohb,flynryan692,2,Tue Jun 9 19:45:55 2015 UTC,"Eh - you could be right.  I think Peyton is done after this year regardless, but I'd be ecstatic to learn he's not for sure.

DenverBroncos,394nlc,d-lo_tha_boss,-9,Tue Jun 9 15:52:55 2015 UTC,His interviews and his public dialogue isn't a real reflection of who he really is. I hate to burst everybody's bubble. There are some good & some bad apples in the NFL just as there are everywhere else. In CJ's case he is a bad apple. He is self centered and extremely selfish. He talks a lot and always only about himself. He's a liar and he has horrible manners. I've got a friend that was at an upscale restaurant in Dallas with him for dinner and he did nothing but complain the entire time and didn't even leave a tip for the waiter. He fabricates everything. He puts himself before his teammates and is very eager and quick to stab any of them in the back or throw them under the bus for his own personal gain. He's just not a person I would find myself wanting to be around. He's a good actor when the cameras are rolling.
DenverBroncos,394nlc,rileysill32,4,Tue Jun 9 16:05:36 2015 UTC,"Not saying they aren't true or anything but those are some pretty big claims. I don't know CJ so I can't speak to any of that, but like you said there are good and bad apples everywhere. At the end of the day as long as he's producing like he did the 2nd half of the season and not getting himself in trouble with the law then I don't give 2 shits how he carries himself."
DenverBroncos,394nlc,d-lo_tha_boss,-2,Tue Jun 9 16:27:44 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean that's good. All I was saying is, he isn't the ""great & humble guy"" everybody thinks he is."
DenverBroncos,394nlc,rileysill32,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:41:14 2015 UTC,"Doesn't change the fact that he plays with serious heart though. I'd like to not believe your claims, but I know that everybody isn't how we see them."
DenverBroncos,394nlc,andrrrew,1 point,Tue Jun 9 21:16:49 2015 UTC,"Not saying you're wrong, just curious how you know all of this?"
DenverBroncos,394nlc,vearson26,0,Wed Jun 10 07:11:34 2015 UTC,"My best friend is a broncos player, whom I have lived with for over a year now. So through him, I have met countless other players from all other teams as well. I go to the Broncos Christmas party every year so I know or have met the entire team."
DenverBroncos,394nlc,rileysill32,1 point,Wed Jun 10 13:53:24 2015 UTC,Wow that's so cool! Thanks for the insight.
DenverBroncos,394nlc,vearson26,2,Wed Jun 10 14:48:22 2015 UTC,"Don't think it's a little odd that he says he's roommates with a professional football player? Where if it's been multiple years on the team like he suggests, the guy is making 400k/year (minimum based on actual salaries)? Umm... Maybe but I highly doubt somebody making that much money has a roommate...  He also has claimed to be Ball's best friend... So no bias there /s   So fact is, I'm not believing anything he says until there is proof, literally every single thing you see and hear is that CJ is a great person and teammate. Look at his Twitter conversations with Larimer and others, or him buying his mom a new car like he promised. If he was such a shit bag, someone would report it to make a story."
DenverBroncos,393fwi,BlindManBaldwin,6,Mon Jun 8 23:54:45 2015 UTC,"There's a solid chance that it may be Trevathan. DannyT posted on twitter saying Bus Cook is the best agent in the biz. Someone asked him if that meant he was getting an extension to which he replied ""ayee"""
DenverBroncos,393fwi,Zweems,2,Tue Jun 9 00:35:00 2015 UTC,"That would surprise me, honestly. I like Danny as much as the next guy, but he's only had one good season and suffered two pretty serious leg injuries last year. Seems a bit risky to be giving him an extension at this point, unless it's a pretty team friendly deal."
DenverBroncos,393fwi,mysterious_pube,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:21:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly if we're going to extend him, now is the time. Lock him up long-term for an intermediate deal before he gets huge. He's not bigtime yet and if he can stay healthy, he will be by the end of this year."
DenverBroncos,393fwi,Zweems,1 point,Tue Jun 9 15:25:27 2015 UTC,Would be nice if we could lock him up.

DenverBroncos,391u5e,baha24,15,Mon Jun 8 17:13:44 2015 UTC,I have this feeling that Manning is going to just ball out of his mind this year. Anyone else feel it?
DenverBroncos,391u5e,BlindManBaldwin,8,Mon Jun 8 19:40:42 2015 UTC,"I want to believe, but then the beer wears off and I remember the only block our offensive line is familiar with is made of Swiss cheese."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,mack2nite,4,Mon Jun 8 20:03:12 2015 UTC,"Hey, our O-line was the biggest question mark the year we won our first SB. Just sayin'."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,taotechill,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:15:12 2015 UTC,Yeah. They were the lightest in the league going up against the heaviest defensive line in the league (Packers).
DenverBroncos,391u5e,Occams_Lazor_,3,Tue Jun 9 17:31:10 2015 UTC,"To an extent, as long as Manning is healthy, the offensive line isn't as much of a problem as it is in most situations. The problem, of course, is it can become a self-propelling problem, he gets hurt, release gets slower, sacked more often, etc. I'm sure we will see lots of running and quick throws until he gets confident in the line.  Not to mention, it's Kubes, man."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,maytagem,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:10:53 2015 UTC,Not even gets hurt. He just wears the fuck out by the end of the season. You know... when we need him most.  I'm hoping Kubiak is a competent coach and reserves him balling out for must wins and the end of the season.
DenverBroncos,391u5e,baseddogpatrick,3,Mon Jun 8 23:38:55 2015 UTC,"Last year there was too much pressure because, with our insanely stacked roster, an SB win was just expected. I think he'll be able to relax this year. Yes, he's one year closer to the end of his career, but the expectations are nearly as high, which I think will be a good thing for the entire team."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,MuzzEmil,5,Mon Jun 8 21:17:06 2015 UTC,Well he always balls out of his mind when healthy so that's not too far of a reach.
DenverBroncos,391u5e,Juan_El_Way,0,Mon Jun 8 20:26:25 2015 UTC,"I have the opposite feeling. Starts off ok, maybe a rocky game, but solid overrall, similar to the 2012 pace. As the season progresses he begins to wear down again, likely his thigh injury flaring up again. Becomes ineffective by week 12-14, Brock has to play. We go 1-and-done in the playoffs, possibly 1-1 depending on the first matchup.   And then we start again next year and everyone wonders why the fuck we wasted 2015 with an injured, immobile, 40-year old QB."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,Spizard,4,Tue Jun 9 20:55:56 2015 UTC,It's crazy that Manning still trains with his college OC.
DenverBroncos,391u5e,BlindManBaldwin,6,Mon Jun 8 18:21:02 2015 UTC,Peyton is very very loyal to the people who have helped him throughout his life.
DenverBroncos,391u5e,Occams_Lazor_,5,Mon Jun 8 20:46:48 2015 UTC,And very spiteful for those who wronged him  Irsay cut you but Elway loved you  remember this when you decide what team you want to be known with pls  peyton  pls
DenverBroncos,391u5e,maurosmane,3,Mon Jun 8 21:24:31 2015 UTC,"A lot of people ""in the know"" or claim to be at least say that the airway feud is real  Not just the obvious dickhead stuff like saying he was disappointed Manning didn't give him (then)  3 rings like Brady, either.  Irsay said he was happy that Indy lost one of their pivotal, late season games in 2012 that ultimately gave them the Luck pick. A game where Manning was on the sideline with headset, coordinating and trying to help the Colts win. Not gonna forget that, I bet."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:13:15 2015 UTC,I had a slimmer of hope until the letter PFM wrote about David Letterman's last show. The whole part about Letterman not giving Luck his first Colt jersey solidified in my mind that Manning will retire a Colt day 1 of his retirement.
DenverBroncos,391u5e,Occams_Lazor_,2,Mon Jun 8 21:46:49 2015 UTC,"I still think, while he will ""retire"" will the Colts, he will treat both teams equally. I can't wait until he is inducted into the Ring of Fame, that'll be a treat to see."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,maurosmane,1 point,Mon Jun 8 21:48:02 2015 UTC,I don't see what about that makes Manning retiring here untenable. Manning just said he didn't mind either way. Am I  missing something?
DenverBroncos,391u5e,Occams_Lazor_,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:14:18 2015 UTC,"Manning said he didn't care either way, but when Letterman said he wasn't doing to do it Manning seemed very relieved. Maybe I am reading too much into it."
DenverBroncos,391u5e,dbfan2007,1 point,Mon Jun 8 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"I just don't remember the relieved part, I guess. I thought it was just a ""I was touched by how considerate he was"" thing."

DenverBroncos,391u5e,MTLBroncos,2,Mon Jun 8 22:40:34 2015 UTC,"Dude no, this is completely objective and we should take it as proof that PFM has returned to 2013 form, injuries and age have had no affect on him."
DenverBroncos,390c65,derpSlurp,17,Mon Jun 8 09:12:10 2015 UTC,That looks............ actually really good

DenverBroncos,390c65,welker_skelter,5,Tue Jun 9 17:13:30 2015 UTC,I would buy that. Also I would probably vote for that on if we were to redesign the logo and uniforms. seriously I'd pay for a full size helmet of that.
DenverBroncos,390c65,Aremihc,3,Mon Jun 8 15:23:17 2015 UTC,I would SO pay for one of those. I wish we'd bring back a version of the D...
DenverBroncos,390c65,oscarito_198666,3,Mon Jun 8 15:06:08 2015 UTC,"that looks great. On that first image I was thinking ""man wish it had the white boarder around it"" scroll down and bam! haha. Nice."
DenverBroncos,390c65,Britt_Solo,1 point,Mon Jun 8 15:22:10 2015 UTC,Yes! I tested one without the white border and it just didn't pop.
DenverBroncos,390c65,Juan_El_Way,3,Tue Jun 9 17:18:29 2015 UTC,"When people post their new helmet or uniform concepts, I don't typically like them very much. However, this one looks great. I especially like the orange strip down the middle as it doesn't taper off as the current one does."
DenverBroncos,390c65,AzWiLdCaT1988,2,Mon Jun 8 15:53:07 2015 UTC,"Thanks! I originally was going to exclude any stripe, but credit to my wife for her good eye and the suggestion!"
DenverBroncos,390c65,designated_shitter,3,Tue Jun 9 17:27:37 2015 UTC,I really like that you kept navy/orange but brought back to old D logo. That looks awesome. I'd love for the Broncos to adopt that logo if they were to ever change the logos.
DenverBroncos,390c65,Petey10Gs,3,Mon Jun 8 16:33:01 2015 UTC,Damn that looks awesome.
DenverBroncos,390c65,EODBrand,3,Mon Jun 8 16:40:00 2015 UTC,"I would have kept the facemask navy, but the rest of it looks great."
DenverBroncos,390c65,g-burn,3,Mon Jun 8 19:23:27 2015 UTC,Phenomenal
DenverBroncos,390c65,andrrrew,3,Mon Jun 8 20:43:31 2015 UTC,I love the logo but would have gone with a royal blue. The navy and orange looks too much like the Bears.
DenverBroncos,390c65,final_boss,1 point,Mon Jun 8 23:06:17 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I ordered the current helmet so it would stay consistent with the color scheme, but maybe for these collectibles, they tweak it to a darker shade. Bothers me to a point where I might buy some other team helmet with a better shade of blue."
DenverBroncos,390c65,kiffgyver,2,Tue Jun 9 17:29:48 2015 UTC,"That looks so fresh. It's hard to make a modern logo design look classy, but you nailed it."
DenverBroncos,3910rl,badcompany1981,9,Mon Jun 8 13:42:41 2015 UTC,Any of the Offensive Lineman I think have the best chance.
DenverBroncos,3910rl,skullyD,2,Mon Jun 8 16:03:51 2015 UTC,This is what Im thinking too. Andre Davis or Dillion Day is what i'm leaning towards.
DenverBroncos,3910rl,kimay124,2,Mon Jun 8 16:18:26 2015 UTC,This is what I was going to say as well. Especially with Clady out for the season.

DenverBroncos,3910rl,Zweems,3,Mon Jun 8 17:34:39 2015 UTC,2004 was Roc Alexander
DenverBroncos,3910rl,theatretech37,4,Mon Jun 8 15:22:14 2015 UTC,"Im gonna go with one of the two D-Linemen. Our depth there is pretty questionable, especially with the change to 3-4. I'll pick Chuka Ndulue, not just for the awesome name but also because he's a converted DE->DT.   EDIT: Also does Karl Schmitz count? He's technically a rookie UDFA....If yes then 100% he makes the team"
DenverBroncos,3910rl,iSamurai,1 point,Mon Jun 8 17:26:18 2015 UTC,I don't see why Karl shouldn't count.
DenverBroncos,3910rl,theatretech37,2,Thu Jun 11 01:40:44 2015 UTC,I pick him then. He's easily gonna win the job from Colquitt.
DenverBroncos,3910rl,a_D_u_B,4,Thu Jun 11 21:59:39 2015 UTC,Jeez... flashbacks.  Anyone remember Roc Alexander getting absolutely torched by Peyton/Wayne in that playoff game?
DenverBroncos,3910rl,waspocracy,2,Mon Jun 8 17:39:10 2015 UTC,I do we had so many injuries in our secondary that game. It made me sick to my stomach how he was just getting manhandled
DenverBroncos,3910rl,von_bot,3,Mon Jun 8 18:46:05 2015 UTC,Matt Miller was already cut. I think Dillon Day and Jordan Taylor have a good shot.

DenverBroncos,38zmsu,Monkey_Bread99,19,Mon Jun 8 04:23:14 2015 UTC,My favorite moment so far of the Manning led Broncos. The CHJ pick 6 to seal it was the most hyped I've ever been during a game.
DenverBroncos,38zmsu,ThreezusManning,8,Mon Jun 8 05:03:12 2015 UTC,When Tamme caught that TD against the Seahawks and we got the 2pt conversion is mine. And then overtime happened.
DenverBroncos,38zmsu,styxman34,3,Mon Jun 8 07:59:16 2015 UTC,What a god damn drive. And that 2 pt catch by DT. Legendary.
DenverBroncos,38zmsu,ThreezusManning,2,Mon Jun 8 08:58:33 2015 UTC,Mine is the pass to DT which he took to the house in overtime against the Steelers. It was amazing.
DenverBroncos,38zmsu,vindawg08,8,Tue Jun 9 00:03:19 2015 UTC,"I was at that game, here are my shitty photos. (http://imgur.com/a/fjvv5) The Chargers always have issues with the amount of transplants in the city, but that game was nuts.   I went down at the Half and started pounding angry beers. My fiancee had convinced me to buy expensive last minute tickets that same day, and I was admittedly just pissed at her (didn't tell her that) and the team and life that my first Broncos game was such a shit show.   As we came back, and Rivers threw the interceptions I was going NUTS. The other Broncos fans were going NUTS. You could hear us cheering all through the stadium. 3rd downs for the Chargers were WAY louder than what they had for us.   As the last second ticked in the game we lost our damn minds. Nearly all of the Chargers fans had already left, and we rushed down to the lowest levels and filled them with Blue and Orange. It was insane. Stokley was sprinting down the sideline and you could tell the players were loving it as much as we were.   Also, this (http://i.imgur.com/krU4J.gif) happened which was pretty hilarious after we won.  I can never thank her enough for making me be there for it, best money ever spent in sports fandom for me, and I doubt I will ever top it."

Stokely gave a ball to the kid in front of me before the game started. Seems like a really good guy, I miss him."
DenverBroncos,38zmsu,bigrobwoot,2,Wed Jun 10 06:48:11 2015 UTC,"As a fan, I almost always miss the folks we trade away. Decker, Moreno, Stokely, and especially Champ recently. I always hope for the best but he was old as crap after that season and apparently the Ravens just didn't need him."
DenverBroncos,38zmsu,RSDeuce,7,Thu Jun 11 08:27:12 2015 UTC,"The beginning of that season I had my ups and downs on the team. The beginning of this game nearly sealed my hopes of this team being great that year.   My gut and orange colored glasses told me not to stop watching. So I relentlessly pushed through halftime and continued.   My god was it worth it.   And to think, silly me thought Tony Carter was a great player after that game.... -_-'  Edit: and holy shit do I miss Brandon Stokley"

DenverBroncos,38zmsu,GotRiskyNewAccount,4,Mon Jun 8 17:28:00 2015 UTC,The TD pass to Stokely might be Peyton's best single throw as a Bronco.

Due to the high rate of off the field issues and all of the press they are getting, I'd say if there was a good chance of him being guilty they would cut him. The fact that they haven't yet might mean there is little or no validity to the claims."
DenverBroncos,38ymj7,taotechill,2,Mon Jun 8 20:28:32 2015 UTC,True.. that's a good way to look at it. I don't think the organization would go against the grain and keep a player if it's known that they've committed some heinous act. It'd be nice if we could get some more information.

DenverBroncos,38yto8,natziel,6,Mon Jun 8 00:25:26 2015 UTC,He would not become a free agent until next year.
DenverBroncos,38yto8,BlindManBaldwin,2,Mon Jun 8 01:19:43 2015 UTC,I think I remember reading somewhere that you either sign your franchise tag or you're out of the league until you do or something like that. That could be wrong too though.
DenverBroncos,38yto8,ThreezusManning,5,Mon Jun 8 00:26:16 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily out of the league, but if he doesn't play, it wouldn't count as an accrued season meaning the Broncos still have rights to his contract under the franchise tag iirc. Similar to Carson Palmer a few years back."

DenverBroncos,38tda5,KingMontagu,12,Sat Jun 6 19:05:17 2015 UTC,"No kidding. I can understand Peyton, just because he's had an elite career but might not be playing at that level now. But DT? Makes no sense."
DenverBroncos,38tda5,FatGuy_InALittleCoat,3,Sat Jun 6 20:16:48 2015 UTC,Perhaps his issues with drops early on kept him from the elite status?
DenverBroncos,38tda5,hardnose77,10,Sat Jun 6 21:54:33 2015 UTC,"2nd in receptions, 2nd in yards, 10th in TDs, 25 20+ receptions, 4th in yards per game, 4th in yards after catch, 5th in most 1st downs in 2014. I'd say that warrants 'elite' status."
DenverBroncos,38tda5,SALTY_BALLZ,1 point,Sat Jun 6 22:02:30 2015 UTC,"Im DT's biggest proponent, but volume stats arent everything. This is not fantasy football.  Demaryius had some poor games to start the season, while Brown had nothing but outstanding games. They probably only allow for 1 or 2 elite players at each position and DT barely missed the cut."

DenverBroncos,38tda5,Fridden,3,Sat Jun 6 23:55:32 2015 UTC,"I actually feel a little better after seeing this (big grain of salt on PFF rankings, though).  I feel like it paints a picture of us being a little more evenly good. Few teams are ever freakishly good everywhere, they all have holes. Some teams are amazing at only one or two key positions. After the last couple years and some of the changes and what not, I expected a sharp decline in talent coming soon. Looks a lot better in this format, at least."
DenverBroncos,38tda5,irishsandman,2,Sun Jun 7 04:04:43 2015 UTC,"I liked the part about there not being much to get excited about at WR besides Sanders, DT, and Latimer. Our WR corps is easily in the top 5 in the league. Caldwell is still a solid stand-in."
DenverBroncos,38u967,StalwartRams,18,Sat Jun 6 21:42:56 2015 UTC,"Even before Clady went down, it was almost a given that he was going to be penciled in as the RT. Now that Clady is out for the year, he'll most likely be out starting LT unless he really blows it.   His size is the whole reason why he fits well with the Broncos but not as well with others. Kubiak likes lighter, quicker lineman for his zone blocking scheme rather than the traditional maulers you see in power run schemes.   Ty was a Kubiak pick through and through. He'll likely be starting  the opening game for the Broncos, either at LT or RT,  unless he shows he's completely incompetent in camp, which seems a stretch."
DenverBroncos,38u967,MileHighPride30,3,Sat Jun 6 21:55:20 2015 UTC,I doubt he will start at LT. Who will start at RT then? We brought back Ryan Harris after Clady went down. He will likely play LT for us.   Wait I was getting Chris Clark and Ryan Harris confused. I meant Chris Clark will probably play LT. He did start in that SB.

DenverBroncos,38u967,Hurry_Hurry,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:28:53 2015 UTC,Not in my mind. He had several games to prove himself last yer at and just flat out sucked. Scheme isn't going to be that big of a change that he could be good there.
DenverBroncos,38u967,Occams_Lazor_,1 point,Sun Jun 7 17:32:28 2015 UTC,"The coaching was also decaying on the OL last year, from some accounts. If that is true, I'm perfectly fine with him getting coached up in the system and having the first crack at the job. If someone else beats him out, well then that's a good thing.  Maybe he can't do it, but at this point I'm trusting that Dennison and Barone to make the decision. If they say he can do the job on the right in this system, I'm fine with letting him getting a second shot and proving it."
DenverBroncos,38u967,Hurry_Hurry,1 point,Sun Jun 7 18:26:21 2015 UTC,"I agree. His first year out, he did pretty well in replacement of Clady. It was when he moved to the other side that he started blowing goats. I think he's got a chance to redeem himself."
DenverBroncos,38u967,SonicSC,2,Sun Jun 7 18:47:52 2015 UTC,"I might by in the market for a Sambrailo jersey then... I'd love to see him start his first game as a Bronco (and, of course, kill it in the process)."
DenverBroncos,38u967,SALTY_BALLZ,3,Sat Jun 6 22:32:59 2015 UTC,"I'd wait it out for a little, man. We have no idea what he plays like yet or what his role will be."
DenverBroncos,38u967,FatGuy_InALittleCoat,7,Sat Jun 6 22:37:38 2015 UTC,"Based on everything I've read, he's been really impressive. I've watched some short videos on him during his career at Colorado State, and I love his aggression and footwork (I'm a former offensive lineman from a family of offensive lineman). He's got a quick first step, his kick step is above average, and he's got good hands. He played RT at the Senior Bowl and didn't do so well, but I think if he had time to work at it, he'll be an above average option for the Broncos. At LT, it'll be Chris Clark. But I'm fully expecting Sambrailo to be our starting RT this season."
DenverBroncos,38u967,Jens1893,6,Sun Jun 7 02:13:32 2015 UTC,I think we´re in deep doo doo if Sambrailo and Schofield aren´t our starting OTs this season. And we might yet be if they are.
DenverBroncos,38u967,Occams_Lazor_,1 point,Sat Jun 6 23:23:37 2015 UTC,I hope it's either Schofield or Harris at left and Ty at right.  But Scho seems to be coming along slowly.

DenverBroncos,38qqkv,Wally4410,28,Sat Jun 6 16:20:29 2015 UTC,"""I am the Broncos "" and ""I'm the blood of the city"" are most disturbing. Couples have fights and dramatic break ups, but a God complex really stands out most. The kids ruin the dads businesses and should go start something on their own, stay the hell away from the Broncos. The fans are the Broncos, Pat Bowlen is the Broncos, current and former players are the Broncos, but hopefully not this guy."
DenverBroncos,38qqkv,jussumman,3,Sat Jun 6 06:14:35 2015 UTC,I know Pat has stated he wants to keep the team in the family - is there anyone more qualified of his 7 children than this asshat?
DenverBroncos,38qqkv,dlevine09,7,Sat Jun 6 15:23:52 2015 UTC,"He has 7 kids. 4 of them work with the NFL in some capacity. 2 sons with the Broncos, one being Johnny ""Blood of the City"" Bowlen. The other two, I believe, work at the league offices in New York, and I believe they're both daughters of Pat. It'd be cool to have a woman owner, I think. Bring a little more gender equality to the sport (I know that there are other woman owners out there).  I think that Blood of the City here is an asshat, but I also think that he was incredibly drunk. Drunk people say stupid shit all the time. Just because he was hammered and said he was the owner of the Broncos and the blood of the city doesn't mean he has a God complex. Yeah, it's bad, but he's also only 29 and was high on whippits. While I think he's played himself out of being one of the youngest owners ever (he could've had the team at age 31 or so, if he had proven himself to the board) I don't think that his stupid behavior means that all of Pat's children are retarded like this guy.  EDIT: I was wrong with the daughters at the league offices. One of them worked there, another works with the Broncos with Pat Bowlen III and Johnny ""Blood of the City."""
DenverBroncos,38qqkv,aatencio91,5,Sat Jun 6 16:39:26 2015 UTC,I vote no on having an owner that does whippits.

DenverBroncos,38qqkv,goateguy,0,Mon Jun 8 05:34:58 2015 UTC,"So everyone is hating on 29 year old Johnny Bowlen because he was drunk and high on whippits and made some stupid-ass decisions, but remember that he's only one of seven children that Pat hopes will prove themselves worthy of owning the team.  He has two daughters with his ex-wife Sally Parker:   Beth Bowlen Wallace is the Broncos' director of special projects and events. Amie Bowlen Klemmer lives in Hawaii and is married to a prominent doctor.   He has 5 children with his wife Annabel:   Patrick Bowlen III, the Broncos Director of Facilities. John ""Johnny"" Bowlen, Jr, who has an MBA in Sports and Entertainment from Denver University and is an ""Executive in Training"" with the Broncos. Brittany Bowlen graduated from Notre Dame in 2014 and works or did work in the ""Junior Rotation"" at the NFL offices in New York. Christianna Bowlen is in high school or recently graduated from high school in the Denver area.   So three work with the Broncos and one works or has worked at the league offices. He's been priming his children to succeed him. I've trusted Pat with my favorite franchise since the day I learned who he was, and I continue to trust him in his decision to have a board of directors choose the best heir. There seem to be good candidates."
DenverBroncos,38rynz,theblueisglue25,7,Sat Jun 6 08:15:21 2015 UTC,"So from what I've seen and my understanding we are going to be switching to the 3-4 full time. It's going to be a hybrid style and u/OLPride did a fantastic write up on Wade Phillips, what he brings to the table, and how it will fit our players.  Basically the long and the short of it is that our LB core before the draft consisted of: Ware, Marshall, Trevathan, Miller. People sleep on Marshall who lead our team in tackles last season, and Trevathan who is a highly underrated LB. They both are EXCELLENT LB's as well. So we are going to have a ton of lb's on the field and now Shane Ray will be filling in when a guy (usually Ware and Miller) need a rest.  Now for the defensive line, everything I have seen points to this being a major help to our d-line. Sly Williams was a natural NT and will play there under Wade Phillips, it suits his skill sets. Derek Wolfe will play an end position and it suits him well. Malik was by far our best d-lineman last season and now he will be a starter opposite Wolfe.  Our d-line to me is the most questionable part of our defense. Malik wasn't a starter so will more playtime make him less effective? Wolfe hasn't played 'well' for a while but he hasn't played too poorly either. The biggest question mark is at the crux of the defense, the NT. Sly hasn't played well in two limited seasons. He HAS to step it up and play lights out and dominate the middle of the field. If he doesn't it's going to hurt our defense tremendously. Plus I am not sold on the backups on the Dline.  Hope this helps some."
DenverBroncos,38rynz,PMeist,5,Sat Jun 6 09:04:35 2015 UTC,"We're converting to a 3-4. Line up for the backers should be: Ware - Marshall - Trevathon - Miller As for the interior line..I'm tired and not entirely sure who is lining up where, so I don't want to give an iffy answer"
DenverBroncos,38rynz,thelizahhhdking,3,Sat Jun 6 08:46:24 2015 UTC,Looks like a Von Killer
DenverBroncos,38rynz,von_bot,2,Sat Jun 6 08:47:24 2015 UTC,Interior line should be (unless a guy breaks out in TC)  Jackson- Williams- Wolfe
DenverBroncos,38rynz,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Sat Jun 6 13:46:37 2015 UTC,"A 4-3 would be a better fit for Shane Ray but it is worse for Von and Ware. Both would be better off as 3-4 OLBs, especially Ware. Ware made himself a HOF player in Dallas playing as a 3-4 OLB under Wade Phillips. Miller was projected to be more of a 3-4 coming out of college too. Even though we were listed as 4-3, we basically used him as a 3-4 OLB anyways.   Ray, Miller, and Ware will all be OLBs. Ray will spell in when they need rest which they desperately needed towards the end of the season."

DenverBroncos,38mrnc,_Exaybachay_,8,Fri Jun 5 05:41:07 2015 UTC,"Loved this video. Brings back a lot of nostalgia and great memories of that season. Definitely the greatest offensive showing in the history of the NFL. You had DT being a monster, Decker as an amazing #2 WR, Julius was a matchup nightmare, Welker as the slot machine you couldn't stop, and Knowshon ran his guts out. Knowshon might have been our most magical player just considering how hard he ran for us.   PFM threw 55 TD's that season and was on pace for 45-50 last season. Yet people are VERY down on him this year for just being injured. He's going to be very good this year and throw 39+ TD's and it won't surprise a single person. 39+ TD's is exceptional and better than 99% of QB's out there, but everyone is ragging on him right now. Just wait till the offense continues to score 30+ consistently."
DenverBroncos,38mrnc,PMeist,3,Fri Jun 5 06:01:49 2015 UTC,"Exactly!  Nostalgia was the exact feeling this brought up when I saw it, like re-living the season and feeling all of the awesomeness again.    As for everyone hating this year - I think it is a good thing.  Let them sleep on us, and see what happens.  We are primed for a great season, and I think that Peyton ""only"" throwing for 39+ TDs is a really good strategy for us, because it allows him to stay healthier for the post-season."
DenverBroncos,38mrnc,PMeist,3,Fri Jun 5 07:59:38 2015 UTC,"I agree. Him slowing down and throwing fewer TD's, taking more ends of the game off when we have a large lead, running all season more, will have tremendous benefits in the post-season.   Not only that but our defense really, REALLY needs to be a nasty, mean, physical, in your face defense. We need to push teams around with our defense and show them up. We are facing a lot of tough offenses but there's no reason we can't shut them down."

What I find to be most disturbing is that domestic violence is the one category of crime in which NFL players are closest to the general population.  So this isn't simply a socioeconomic issue, but something about football in particular.  My main point is that there is a domestic violence issue in the NFL that isn't simply driven by the media, as you stated in your original post."
DenverBroncos,38kg5q,bdyoungd2000,2,Fri Jun 5 17:18:40 2015 UTC,"I don't want to come off as saying it's not an issue - I think that some people perceive it as an issue plaguing the NFL at rates much higher than the general public due to media coverage.

Corporate sponsor coordinator is at least useful experience which makes me think this is the one I was thinking of.

Maybe his son Patrick III or his daughter can run the team."

DenverBroncos,38kg5q,braves_10,20,Thu Jun 4 21:33:58 2015 UTC,"Are you fucking serious right now? Most importantly, Pat isn't running anything. He stepped down as owner a year ago. Joe Ellis and John Elway run the show. Next, let's think about what John Bowlen Jr's arrest means for the Broncos: nothing. It makes them look bad now, but he's a 29 year old who got drunk and did whippits, and who probably just removed himself from ownership consideration. Now one of the other 6 kids who haven't been arrested for domestic violence has a better shot of running the franchise. Now, what if they sell to a shitty owner? You want a Dean Spanos running our team? I'd rather not. He's holding the city of San Diego for ransom, threatening to take the team to LA. Could we get a guy like Mark Cuban? Maybe, if we're lucky, but then again I'd rather not have the Broncos owned by a guy who makes himself bigger than the team. His personality could chase off John Elway and Joe Ellis, two guys that have done this franchise right for decades.  What a bullshit, moronic, kneejerk reaction to suggest that the best owners in Colorado sports history should sell the team because their 29 year old son was an idiot."
DenverBroncos,38kg5q,aatencio91,13,Thu Jun 4 21:42:35 2015 UTC,The only non-Bowlen who could own the team and I'd be fine with would be Elway.

DenverBroncos,38egdz,Hubnester42,17,Wed Jun 3 18:39:52 2015 UTC,IN  COM  PLETE!!!!!!!!!!!  the crowd roars uncontrollably  Shit I can't wait for football season!
DenverBroncos,38egdz,Formber,4,Wed Jun 3 20:51:32 2015 UTC,"""Wah wah wah waaahhhhh."""
DenverBroncos,38egdz,VaporFlight,5,Wed Jun 3 23:51:44 2015 UTC,They stopped doing that :(. Apparently the NFL warned them it was taunting.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,Formber,3,Thu Jun 4 01:23:26 2015 UTC,I always wondered why they stopped doing that.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,Danieltmv,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:00:50 2015 UTC,"my Mariners are sucking right now, I'm here to think about football and get away from the suckage."
DenverBroncos,38egdz,FNG_WolfKnight,9,Thu Jun 4 00:54:06 2015 UTC,I had a flash back of him shutting Wayne down on 4th and game over.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,Sienna_Crush,2,Wed Jun 3 21:44:44 2015 UTC,"That's the ""No Fly Zone"""
DenverBroncos,38egdz,thelizahhhdking,5,Wed Jun 3 21:38:03 2015 UTC,"Roby, Ward, Talib, and Harris are going to make one hell of a secondary!   Can't wait for this defense to show what it's capable of!"
DenverBroncos,38egdz,Von_Miller,6,Wed Jun 3 22:03:36 2015 UTC,Sort of like how he shut down Reggie Wayne to win the game.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,flynryan692,1 point,Wed Jun 3 20:24:44 2015 UTC,"I was about to say, he definitely did this in his debut game -- on national television, no less!"
DenverBroncos,38egdz,baha24,3,Thu Jun 4 00:49:07 2015 UTC,I think Roby will be our 3rd best defensive player by the end of the year.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,drax117,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:29:43 2015 UTC,"Better than Talib and Malik huh? Not sure I agree, but I wouldnt be mad if he have to were right."
DenverBroncos,38egdz,MasonL52,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:52:58 2015 UTC,Talib is not our third best player...
DenverBroncos,38egdz,tsaru14,1 point,Thu Jun 4 05:06:32 2015 UTC,"If certainly think you can make the argument, who'd you put there?"
DenverBroncos,38egdz,MasonL52,1 point,Fri Jun 5 20:14:41 2015 UTC,Talib and Malik ahead of Von and CHJ? C'mon now
DenverBroncos,38egdz,MTLBroncos,10,Wed Jun 3 23:58:09 2015 UTC,Looks like a Von Killer
DenverBroncos,38egdz,von_bot,5,Wed Jun 3 23:59:16 2015 UTC,"Noo, he said third best player so that's assuming Von and CHjr are 1/2. That would make Roby ahead of the players I said and behind Von/CHjr."
DenverBroncos,38egdz,MasonL52,1 point,Thu Jun 4 00:00:44 2015 UTC,This is correct. Von 1 and CHJ 2. Roby 3 and I'd put money on it. Dude's gonna have a stellar season
DenverBroncos,38egdz,drax117,2,Thu Jun 4 05:33:16 2015 UTC,And BMarsh and Trevathan and Ward. 3rd best is a stretch.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,MurrayPloppins,2,Thu Jun 4 00:27:01 2015 UTC,"All the better because that literally happened last year, when he knocked down that 4th down pass.   Goddammit, I'm getting excited.  If the OL looks good, I'm going to have to worry about priapism."
DenverBroncos,38egdz,designated_shitter,2,Wed Jun 3 20:24:47 2015 UTC,I think we're gonna let Talib go after this season because of this guy.  I can't wait to see what he can do in a man press scheme
DenverBroncos,38egdz,ktsmyth,4,Thu Jun 4 02:39:08 2015 UTC,"I personally hope Roby gets the FS spot assuming he plays it well, it doesn't really cater to his Press-man abilities but I like to this he has a instinct for the ball that could make him a ball hawk as well as a good hitter. Either way our CBs are staaaacked."
DenverBroncos,38egdz,MasonL52,5,Wed Jun 3 18:58:59 2015 UTC,God I hope not. I highly doubt Talib will be here next season. So we will need him to play opposite of Harris.
DenverBroncos,38egdz,Fridden,1 point,Wed Jun 3 23:38:31 2015 UTC,"I think he has the skill to play both.  I'm my dream world, he plays FS when we are in base, but when we go into nickel or dime, he goes to CB"
DenverBroncos,38egdz,bcos4life,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:54:19 2015 UTC,that's what the coaches have said they intended when they've talked about moving him to FS.
DenverBroncos,38dbez,BlindManBaldwin,6,Wed Jun 3 14:02:19 2015 UTC,"I love Chris Harris Jr and think he is great for the team and our work ethic, I think CJ anderson (aside peyton obviously) can be a role model on offense as well after his comments this offseason and what his work ethic appears to be."
DenverBroncos,38dbez,the_denver_nugs,5,Thu Jun 4 04:31:11 2015 UTC,"Chris Harris is one of (if not my) favorite Broncos. We've been spoiled rotten with corners. He's a great follow on twitter imo, I recommend following him."
DenverBroncos,38dbez,narrativehabitat,3,Wed Jun 3 21:42:38 2015 UTC,The Kent Denver burn is swift and harsh.
DenverBroncos,38dbez,Von_Miller,3,Wed Jun 3 17:40:43 2015 UTC,"I'm so happy I bought his jersey. Now I just need Aqib Talib, Steven Johnson, and Michael Schofield (since he might be starting OL this year) and then I'll have all the KU players jerseys.   I love having almost every KU player in the NFL on the Broncos!  Living in Kansas City, my friends, family and buddies that attended or graduated from KU hate the fact that they all play for the rival Broncos hahaha I LOVE IT!"
DenverBroncos,38dbez,MountCRushmore,6,Wed Jun 3 19:51:55 2015 UTC,Schofield went to Michigan
DenverBroncos,38dbez,Von_Miller,0,Wed Jun 3 20:58:11 2015 UTC,"Ahh you're right. I got confused. We did pick up an OL last year from KU named Aslam Sterling, but he's no longer on the team. I only remember that because my buddy was a FS at KU and was good friends with Sterling and was upset he went to the Broncos instead of the Chiefs haha."
DenverBroncos,38dbez,baha24,1 point,Thu Jun 4 01:38:48 2015 UTC,"Heyyy fellow KC native. The past three years have been so much fun, haha."
DenverBroncos,38dbez,Von_Miller,2,Thu Jun 4 00:48:00 2015 UTC,Yes they have. It's a great time to be a Broncos fan. Especially a Broncos fan living in Kansas City haha
DenverBroncos,38e974,Fatandmean,8,Wed Jun 3 17:17:19 2015 UTC,"All the pieces are there for a top-tiered defense, hopefully with Wade's balls, Von's sacks(lol), and Harris' INTs, we'll be a top 3."
DenverBroncos,38e974,crueg,2,Wed Jun 3 21:12:16 2015 UTC,"""Wade's balls"" hehe"
DenverBroncos,38e974,troykaPower,3,Thu Jun 4 02:55:53 2015 UTC,"Honestly I think we'll do better then last year. I think we'll make the playoffs still, and from there it seems unlikely we'll do worse then VS the colts this year."
DenverBroncos,38e974,Colorado222,3,Wed Jun 3 23:27:55 2015 UTC,"Than, god damnit, than. What are you, a raiders fan?"

DenverBroncos,38e974,demerdar,3,Thu Jun 4 04:37:44 2015 UTC,And I expect Talib to play a full fucking season!
DenverBroncos,38e974,Corrupted_Engineer,3,Wed Jun 3 23:05:39 2015 UTC,I think he missed one game last year... he played at a top 10 level.
DenverBroncos,38e974,MTLBroncos,1 point,Thu Jun 4 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"he missed one game, and it was against the receiverless Chiefs."

DenverBroncos,38c8dr,denverdudeCO,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:54:41 2015 UTC,Shipping outside of the U.S. Is unfortunately REALLY expensive.  We had one person in Ontario consider buying one but the shipping and fees were going to be almost $900.  If you're still interested we can price it.... https://www.etsy.com/listing/235729316/custom-designed-steel-fire-pits
DenverBroncos,38c8dr,Unrelated_Incident,2,Wed Jun 3 17:14:49 2015 UTC,Does he have a website? And would it ship in parts or as a whole?
DenverBroncos,38d78o,BroncoBuckeye,2,Wed Jun 3 13:34:14 2015 UTC,This was a great breakdown and read. Thanks for posting it.
DenverBroncos,38d78o,dioblaire,0,Wed Jun 3 20:13:37 2015 UTC,"This is the reason I always have a bit of anger towards Pat Bowlen. I think he was a great owner (for the most part) and did many great things for the city and the league in general. But he let Dan Reeves linger too long as the head coach during the 80's. Plus, he made huge blunders in the coaches he hired pre and post Shanahan. In my opinion his loyalty to Reeves hurt Elway's career as well as the overall development of the team. I wouldn't doubt that played into Elway's thought process after Fox's last season. He didn't want the coach to be just above average. He wanted a coach that could move the team beyond making the playoffs and just being happy to get to a Super Bowl."
DenverBroncos,38d78o,LeftyBigGuns,0,Thu Jun 4 01:04:04 2015 UTC,This article would have done wonders yesterday over on r/NFL.  there was a big discussion about Elway and whether he's overrated as one of the best.

DenverBroncos,38cyf9,veintisiete,3,Wed Jun 3 12:26:54 2015 UTC,"Wow, pretty solid analysis coming from BR. It gives me plenty of good vibes about this upcoming season, too."
DenverBroncos,38cyf9,an_actual_potato,2,Wed Jun 3 17:24:41 2015 UTC,"Haha I got shunned last time I posted a BR article. I read this and thought about posting, but ended up not. It was definitely a good read"
DenverBroncos,38cyf9,troubledhumans,2,Wed Jun 3 18:43:10 2015 UTC,"They are talking about us using a fullback? Who would this be? What kind of a fullback are we talking about? Are we looking for a guy that is going to clear the path for the half back, someone to get 10 carries + a game, or someone to give PFM a few extra seconds in the pocket?  Last year we were 10th in YPG, 10th in passing YPG, and 9th in rushing YPG.  Side note: I remember Virgil Green rushing the ball at fullback (it was the play he received a concussion on)."
DenverBroncos,38cyf9,MountCRushmore,3,Wed Jun 3 19:20:12 2015 UTC,"Or FB would be a converted TE, so Joe Don Duncan or James Casey. They would be a path clearer and a Manning protecter, would never get their hands on the ball"
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,maxels,2,Wed Jun 3 14:57:34 2015 UTC,"I got mine on NFL ticket exchange for the niners game last year for about 160 a piece. I then later paid 1000 for 2 tickets from another redditor for better seats lol I def picked the right game, since thats when manning broke the record"
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,troubledhumans,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:12:45 2015 UTC,"Did you get yours from the ticket exchange before the single game tickets went on sale or after? Because the ticket exchange has tickets up right now, but I know that single game tickets don't go on sale until later on this summer.  Thanks."
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,andrrrew,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:01:14 2015 UTC,I got mine after single game tickets went on sale
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,troubledhumans,1 point,Thu Jun 4 14:42:05 2015 UTC,I really doubt they would get too much cheaper. That is going to be one of the more expensive games to go to.
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,AzWiLdCaT1988,1 point,Wed Jun 3 16:13:57 2015 UTC,"You need a credit card with a local billing code to purchase single game seats, I believe. You should be able to get in for cheaper than 400$ though!"
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,gwalstad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 18:59:36 2015 UTC,"I see, I actually have a friend in denver I'm visiting for this potentially, so that is feasible. Another problem is there will be 3 of us attending, so if I had to buy on secondary market I could see needing to buy 4 tickets, so even if the tickets are only $200 it could add up quick.  Question being, do you have any estimate for the range of ticket prices? Does mile high always sell out months in advance? I dont' know if I should be expecting $350 tickets per seat or if they could go as cheap as $50."
DenverBroncos,38dkk7,gwalstad,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:59:30 2015 UTC,"I would say, for nosebleeds, no less than 150/seat bought aftermarket on craigslist or ticket exchange"

DenverBroncos,38dkk7,snoreee,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:38:38 2015 UTC,I paid $260 for nose bleeds around goal line last year for 49ers which was the most expensive hone game with the manning record thing last year.

DenverBroncos,38aef2,aatencio91,25,Tue Jun 2 22:47:48 2015 UTC,"Von Miller.  Thanks in advance, /u/Von_bot"
DenverBroncos,38aef2,von_bot,35,Tue Jun 2 22:48:06 2015 UTC,This Von Miller?
DenverBroncos,38aef2,Tranysaurus,14,Tue Jun 2 22:49:30 2015 UTC,Yup. That very one!
DenverBroncos,38aef2,flynryan692,11,Tue Jun 2 22:50:11 2015 UTC,"If it comes down to a pay Von or pay DT....most of me says Von. That really hurts to even think, but it hurts more to think pay DT and let Von go.   pls Elway don't do this to me, pay them both."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,andrrrew,16,Tue Jun 2 23:16:13 2015 UTC,"Absolutely Von over DT. Von offers way more to the team than DT does, and I say that as a huge DT lover. WR can be made to look better by quarterback play, and it's easier to replace a great WR with a good one than it is to replace a great pass rusher with a good one."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,PMeist,8,Tue Jun 2 23:18:39 2015 UTC,"You never give up a linebacker like Von over a star receiver like DT. Receivers like that are easier to come by. My sister asked me a few years ago if she should get a Decker or Von jersey. I told her receivers come and go, defensive players like Von Miller stick around for a long time if the team is smart."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,SleepYourLifeAway,6,Tue Jun 2 23:38:40 2015 UTC,"It's easier to find a top tier WR, or even good WR's than it is to find a top tier LB like Von. I can name a ton of top tier WR's: Dez, Megatron, Alshon, Brandon Marshall, Cobb, Jordy, Julio, Green, etc. But its tougher to find guys like Von."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,Babafesh,3,Tue Jun 2 23:26:55 2015 UTC,Not to mention Peyton makes everyone around him look better
DenverBroncos,38aef2,hayclaylaybaymaysay,1 point,Wed Jun 3 03:04:51 2015 UTC,Dt was an animal with even tebow though. The guy is a freaking monster
DenverBroncos,38aef2,Colorado222,1 point,Wed Jun 3 19:59:13 2015 UTC,"Not to mention all the 1st round draft picks who can contribute right away every year at WR- Mike Evans, OBJ, Moncrief, Watkins, etc.  A 1st round WR can replace Demaryius almost immediately because of the rules in the NFL now which make it so much easier for WRs. You can't replace Von through the draft unless you get a top 3 pick, and even then you never know with LBs."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,troykaPower,1 point,Wed Jun 3 17:20:02 2015 UTC,Can't forget Antonio Brown.
DenverBroncos,38aef2,BlindManBaldwin,2,Wed Jun 3 04:13:10 2015 UTC,Wait no. I want both :(
DenverBroncos,38aef2,Fridden,1 point,Wed Jun 3 04:10:27 2015 UTC,"No doubt in my mind, and I want to keep DT. DT is a top guy at a replaceable position, Von is the best guy at his position and is simply amazing. In my homer opinion, Von is the best pure pass rusher since LT. Pay Von whatever it takes to keep him."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,caesarfecit,1 point,Wed Jun 3 01:03:55 2015 UTC,I agree I'll take Von. I never seen Von take a play off like DT did against the Colts.
DenverBroncos,38aef2,drax117,1 point,Wed Jun 3 07:10:01 2015 UTC,"Ideally keep both, but definitely Von over DT. Guys like Von are the kinds of players who can make a difference even if the quarterback/the line/the secondary suck. And in this league, having a bad pass rush is actually worse than having a bad secondary."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,waspocracy,0,Thu Jun 4 09:03:53 2015 UTC,If we let Von go I would find it very hard to root for the team. It would take a pretty extraordinary set of circumstances to change my mind from that.
DenverBroncos,38aef2,solsethop,7,Wed Jun 3 04:42:00 2015 UTC,"Lawrence Taylor highlights for reference.  That dude didn't have near the speed of Von, but he could sure as hell punish. He had a knack for fumbles. You can also see in the highlights that it wasn't rare he was tackling someone with one arm while fighting off another with his other arm."
DenverBroncos,38aef2,TheoneandonlyTate,7,Tue Jun 2 23:43:52 2015 UTC,"Definitely Hyperbole considering LT totally changed the game, but god damn am I hype for this defense."

DenverBroncos,38aef2,fantasygod777,3,Wed Jun 3 08:31:06 2015 UTC,"Which I think was the point of the topic, he COULD be the best defensive player in the NFL, but he hasn't hit that next gear yet. Maybe after being healthy and being in the right scheme he can achieve greatness."
DenverBroncos,38buhi,andrrrew,1 point,Wed Jun 3 05:19:11 2015 UTC,"Have you paid anything to the NFL Ticket Exchange when you did that? If not, then it's reserving them for when someone puts them up for sale.  I'd recommend waiting for the single game tickets, and buy them that way. (If you don't get them at those prices, then you can do the ticket exchange). Apparently, Ticketmaster puts priority on the mobile platforms over the browser."
DenverBroncos,38buhi,sgrace_wrk,1 point,Wed Jun 3 15:03:06 2015 UTC,"I didn't pay anything yet. My stepdad says he is gonna talk to some friends at work (because he actually works in Colorado) and see what they may have before I go for those tickets.

DenverBroncos,38fksi,dyemyhurpls,17,Wed Jun 3 21:54:44 2015 UTC,Brock can throw a football like an NFL QB  Tebow can throw the football like an NFL RB  Reports coming out of Philly is that Tebow still is god awful. You can only polish crap so much.
DenverBroncos,38fksi,BlindManBaldwin,2,Wed Jun 3 22:07:36 2015 UTC,"OP says: ""I feel like Tebow could learn to become a good quarterback""  So all four years of high school, four years of college, three in the NFL, and two out of the NFL where he was consistently throwing, can we maybe give up on the fact that this guy can learn to be a good quarterback??"
DenverBroncos,38fksi,Greeney494,4,Thu Jun 4 02:09:48 2015 UTC,Not to mention the shit show circus that follows Tebow wherever he goes. Giant distraction.
DenverBroncos,38fksi,gutshot72,4,Wed Jun 3 22:43:20 2015 UTC,"Some of the worst mechanics I've ever seen, terrible accuracy, insane fanbase, couldn't adjust mentally to the game, terrible decision making, turned the ball over far too much.  And, fucking hell, Tebow was absolutely not a freak athlete. He was a good athlete for a QB, but he was not an amazing athlete.  Quarterbacks don't learn mechanics from other QBs. Quarterbacks learn mechanics from QB coaches, and Tebow has worked with some of the best both during the season and the offseason. He even started working on his mechanics before the draft because he knew it was a major knock against him. After 6 years, his mechanics still suck. If he hasn't fixed his mechanics by now, they can't be fixed."
DenverBroncos,38fksi,mysterious_pube,3,Wed Jun 3 23:53:32 2015 UTC,A good quarterback
DenverBroncos,38fksi,cbull1,2,Thu Jun 4 01:53:24 2015 UTC,"Throwing motion, release speed, decision making, height."
DenverBroncos,38fksi,yonelway,1 point,Wed Jun 3 22:18:58 2015 UTC,"I definitely feel like Elway did him a favor by letting him go when Tebow appeared to be on top of his game. That allowed him to have a shot at getting signed by abother squad, rather than holding onto him and let him trickle out of the nfl without getting another real shot."
DenverBroncos,38a3jn,Justanotherjustin,19,Tue Jun 2 21:38:56 2015 UTC,"He played 15 games, 4 picks (2 for TDs), and was relatively unnoticed on the field, which is a good thing. He had a good season, but was simply overshadowed by CHJ.   He gives us the large, physical presence at corner needed to match bigger receivers. The only time he really got beat repeatedly was against Hilton, which was simply a matchup nightmare for Talib.  And all for a relatively good price. Im extremely happy with the signing."
DenverBroncos,38a3jn,MuzzEmil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 21:43:32 2015 UTC,"Also, he stayed healthy (only missing one game)! Something that was a pretty big concern for me when we picked him up."
DenverBroncos,38a3jn,300FeetPerSecond,11,Tue Jun 2 21:47:36 2015 UTC,"he was a top 10 corner last year. Playing out of scheme. Talib spent a great deal of his time in off man, which is easily his weakest area of coverage.  So yes, he has been a good signing."
DenverBroncos,38a3jn,ktsmyth,5,Tue Jun 2 21:51:44 2015 UTC,Yes and I believe he will thrive this year if he's allowed to be physical and press receivers under Wade Phillips scheme

DenverBroncos,387t1n,iseedoug,16,Tue Jun 2 13:45:35 2015 UTC,I hope this continues during the regular season. Brock needs the work just in case manning gets hurt. Manning could do with the rest throughout the season to keep him fresh.

If we do somehow win it against all reasonable odds, it will be because the defense/run game stayed healthy and is extremely effective.    Id rather have a future with Brock, who we have invested a lot in and who I think could be good, than 1 year of a 40-year old, injured, immobile, weak-armed QB and then be stuck with jack shit 2016 onward."
DenverBroncos,387t1n,mysterious_pube,2,Tue Jun 2 16:49:17 2015 UTC,"While I like Brock and certainly want him to say, saying Denver has invested a lot in him is a bit much. The Broncos have invested a late 2nd rounder, a backup QB spot, and a mere 3.5 mil, which is less than you'd pay for a solid backup.  And Denver won't necessarily be stuck with ""jack shit"" if Oz leaves. There are QBs in the draft. It's not like Oz is Denver's last shot at getting a quarterback."
DenverBroncos,387t1n,MuzzEmil,1 point,Tue Jun 2 23:08:12 2015 UTC,"Dude, a second isnt exactly a throw-away pick. And we have given him 3 years to develop, giving basically no other QB a shot. 3 years we could have been looking for a replacement, but we spent it on Brock. You want to talk about mortgaging the future? We will have lost 4 years of QB search and development if Brock gets away.  Who will we get to replace him with? A rookie from a weak 2016 draft class? A veteran that no other team wants and that has already blown their shot? No thanks, i want the guy that our FO drafted AS the future, and has had 4 years of experience with the Broncos practicing and developing AS the future."

DenverBroncos,387t1n,natziel,-1,Tue Jun 2 18:50:39 2015 UTC,Brock is better than any quarterback we could hope to replace Peyton with unless we plan on tanking or trading for Rivers.

It feels like Brister, Cutler, Kanelle, Burline all over again.   You play to win now. Our team is built for the now (even though the future looks bright). Just look at our defense. Our offense. Neither will get better over time. if they have a chance to win (I think we do), you put your cards down asap."

DenverBroncos,3883l0,BornToulouse,2,Tue Jun 2 16:34:12 2015 UTC,Nah. Next year we won't have Peyton (I think) which gets us back a ton of cap room
DenverBroncos,3883l0,theatretech37,10,Tue Jun 2 18:06:17 2015 UTC,"Except next year we have to pay DT, Von, CJ Anderson, Danny Trevathan, Malik Jackson, Derek Wolfe, Brandon Marshall, Brock Osweiler....  So many free agents in 2016"
DenverBroncos,3883l0,aatencio91,2,Tue Jun 2 19:01:26 2015 UTC,"well DT's current cap hit is the franchise tag so i dont' expect it to go that much higher. von is already a 9 mil cap hit and the highest paid guy (clay matthews/justin houston) are at 13 mil. so thats probably around a 7 mil cap increase between the two of them. theres 10 mil left from manning's 17 mil cap hit to hit 153 mil cap and the cap next year should be even higher. as much as i love cj he'll probably be expendable due to cheaper rookies behind him. i think we can get trevathan, malik, derek wolfe, and brandon marshall for around 15 mil.  osweiler will be the difficult one because he'll be an unproven commodity."
DenverBroncos,3883l0,march20rulez,9,Tue Jun 2 19:14:20 2015 UTC,It's Miller time!
DenverBroncos,3883l0,von_bot,2,Tue Jun 2 19:15:47 2015 UTC,LOVE. YOU. <3
DenverBroncos,3883l0,march20rulez,2,Tue Jun 2 19:18:58 2015 UTC,"DT and Dez will set the market for each other, and it'll be between $13 and $15 mil. Clay Matthews' deal will be topped by Miller's easily, and Justin Houston is only on a franchise tag deal. I expect both Houston and Von to be closer to JJ Watt's deal than to Clay Matthew's deal (Von is a complete player like Watt, though not as good, and will get paid like a complete player). If Malik explodes like I think he will under Philips, he could be pretty expensive or he could take a tad less to have continued success under Philips. He's a toss up. Wolfe may be expendable, and it wouldn't surprise me much if CJ walks. Marshall and Trevathan could be expensive. I think they're the hardest to project."
DenverBroncos,3883l0,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:21:28 2015 UTC,i feel like von will have a hard time selling himself as a completely player consider watt plays all along the line and von is more of a LB. especially when he plays in the 3-4. i think 30 mil between von and DT can be expected. hopefully we get a little less than that. if malik explodes and shane ray explodes that may make Ware expendable (or is his contract up next year anyway).  it'll be interesting but i think we have a better situation than it looks. especially if manning plays the whole year and we get to keep osweiler for cheap and he turns out to be a franchise QB
DenverBroncos,3883l0,march20rulez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 19:44:40 2015 UTC,"I think that Ware still has a year on his contract after 2015, but both his and Talib's contracts are structured in a way that allows them to be cut with minimal dead money after this year, I think. It's entirely possible that one or both of them are gone after this year with Ray, Jackson, and Roby on the team.  As far as Von goes, he's a linebacker 100% in the 3-4, but he's a complete linebacker. He's not great in coverage, but he's a stud against the run and he's obviously one of the best pass rushers in the league. If he could cover a bit better, you could even argue that he's more versatile than Watt."
DenverBroncos,3883l0,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Jun 2 20:01:50 2015 UTC,"Miller isn't getting signed for 13m a year. Houston is tagged. Mathews signed his contract two years ago, and while he's a very good all around player, he's not exactly an ""elite"" pass rusher.  Miller's contract will be around 16-18 a year probably."
DenverBroncos,3883l0,march20rulez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:16:26 2015 UTC,I really don't think he'll get paid more than watt...
DenverBroncos,3883l0,march20rulez,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:30:41 2015 UTC,"A) he is on a pretty team friendly deal  B) by the time Miller signs his deal, it'll probably have been 2 years since Watt signed his. The cap will be about 20m higher. Higher cap = higher contracts.  Would not be surprising at all if he gets paid more than Watt"
DenverBroncos,3883l0,mysterious_pube,1 point,Tue Jun 2 22:39:38 2015 UTC,1) watts deal is only team friendly due to being back ended. allowing them cap space in the next couple of years to do something.  2) yeah cap increase was a little under 10%. that would translate to approx 18-19 mil. the kind of deal suh got. these are defensive lineman deals. von miller is a LB regardless of impact and he will get paid like one which will probably be around 15 mil which is about a 10% increase on clay matthews deal to account for cap changes.
DenverBroncos,3883l0,vladimir_pimpin,2,Tue Jun 2 22:49:37 2015 UTC,CJ and Marshall are RFAs. They won't be expensive at all.

I was distraught and pissed off. I'm so glad they're not picking up his contract so I don't have to worry about having a family member on my rival team (so long as he doesn't go to KC or OAK).   I'd cry tears of joy if Denver picked him up!

DenverBroncos,3883l0,SleepYourLifeAway,2,Tue Jun 2 22:04:30 2015 UTC,"No. As good as Weddle is, he'll be 31 going into 2016, and some desperate team will give him more money than Denver can reasonably pay. Sinking money into a 31 year old DB isn't a good idea, which is probably why SD hasn't done it. I don't think Denver will need him, anyway."
DenverBroncos,3883l0,bobybushia,2,Tue Jun 2 23:18:52 2015 UTC,They are not gonna discuss his contract this year. That doesn't mean they are not gonna sign him.
DenverBroncos,3883l0,bcos4life,2,Wed Jun 3 01:13:01 2015 UTC,"Maybe, just maybe if he feels like they're not treating him right he'll go to his team's biggest roadblock in the division to shove it up their asses, ala Mike Shanahan.

DenverBroncos,3883l0,Corrupted_Engineer,2,Wed Jun 3 06:07:04 2015 UTC,"Lets play a bunch of hypotheticals. First I think they will either cut Clady and have 1.2 million in dead money, but saving almost 9 million. Or they might ask him to come back at a reduced rate. Maybe around 5 million? saving us around 5 million. Now I know Manning already said he is coming back next year, but lets say an injury, or something changes his mind. His cap hit is 21.5 million next year. And if Shane Ray has a good year I could see us cutting Ware, which would save us 10 million.  So lets say all 3 are gone next year. That's 40 million in savings bringing us to about 60 million in free space. Plenty of room to sign everyone. Know I doubt any of this will happen, but I can dream."

For all we know Stewart will hold his own or even be a improvement from Moore. Or one of the younger guys may step up. With the pass rush we are capable of generating and the high level of play from our CBs we may not have to worry about getting anything but average play from our FS.

DenverBroncos,3887wn,bobybushia,4,Tue Jun 2 19:37:31 2015 UTC,"Well I'm not sure that's the only reason we didn't manhandle the Colts; the defense didn't have a particularly good day (especially Talib).   That said, I understand why people might be wary of the Broncos, but until someone knocks them off they should still be the favorites in the division. The Chargers and Chiefs both have plenty of holes."

DenverBroncos,3887vk,Wham_Bam_Smash,4,Tue Jun 2 15:29:55 2015 UTC,Same reason we won in 97 and 98. We will establish a strong run game and with having a HOF QB teams won't want to over commit to the run lest be beaten by one of the greatest ever.

DenverBroncos,385gi1,JackTheKing,5,Tue Jun 2 05:45:11 2015 UTC,"You see, in my layman mind, I wouldn't want him to heavily change his build that much. He ran like a horse last season with all that blub on him. Why mess with success? Is the decrease in his mass and ability to shrug off hits that worth adding to his already good agility and speed?"
DenverBroncos,385gi1,Occams_Lazor_,5,Tue Jun 2 03:04:39 2015 UTC,"I'm sure by leaning out he means he trimmed the fat. If he can replace that fat with muscle, he will be even more beastly."

I'm guessing he's just in better shape coming into camp so he won't have to lose as much weight and hopefully he has more muscle."

Elway was 37/38 when we won our Super Bowls, and that last season he missed multiple games due to injuries. He also had a 2,000 yard rusher in the backfield."
DenverBroncos,384oaz,BingBongtheArcher19,-1,Tue Jun 2 15:53:07 2015 UTC,The key will be rest. Our soft as fuck coaching staff last year didn't lay down the law with Peyton and just let him play hurt because he wouldn't come out. Kubes and co hopefully have the balls to do what's right for this team and sit Manning if he needs it/whenever we have a big lead at the end of the season.
DenverBroncos,384oaz,MTLBroncos,8,Tue Jun 2 15:15:07 2015 UTC,"Well, he is pretty old and he's been injured 3 times in the last 4 years. His throwing motion puts a lot of stress on his legs to take stress off his arms, so every throw he makes wears out his thighs a little more, which were a problem area last year. You'd be naive to think that a quarterback like him can go 19 games without having some sort of injury.  We'll be fine, though. Our coach understands that pressure needs to be taken off him. He'll take him out of games where we have a substantial lead. He'll rest him when he starts looking a little worn out. Our defense is one of the best in the league. Our backup quarterback could start for half of the teams in the league."

I still have faith in him. But he can't be holding back injuries any more. He does that shit again and we're going to lose bad. If he needs a rest 3/4 of the way through the season, he needs to take a rest. That's just how it will have to be. I don't know if the guy has 16+ consecutive games left in him. Do you?"
DenverBroncos,384oaz,ericgordier,2,Mon Jun 1 21:07:37 2015 UTC,I definitely do. Besides about 4-6 games last year he has been completely healthy with denver and even in 2013 not a single person was saying he was injury prone and non durable.

I think a lot of it is he's so agile for his size and speed, he can make adjustments on the fly and go from blitzing the QB to chasing down the RB in the backfield. Sniffing out a run and making adjustments when expecting a pass play is no small feat.  But I am also looking forward to seeing Von with the reins taken off."

DenverBroncos,383p14,SonicSC,2,Tue Jun 2 15:27:44 2015 UTC,For some reason I read this as in we would let him run the ball. I'm kind of disappointed that's not what it means.
DenverBroncos,387xsv,baha24,11,Tue Jun 2 14:21:26 2015 UTC,"Yeah after reading the article I don't think JDR is purposely trying to knock Von down, but rather saying because Mack is a bigger player he has the weight to be more physical. He says ""They are different players,"" which is true. Von speed is elite especially off the ball, we all say how bad he was when he got up to 265. He plays naturally at 250, and on top of that plays hard and fast. Mack had four sacks last year which is nothing compared to Von's rookie year. I would also keep in mind Mack played under Dennis Allen who of course was Von's d coordinator when he put up 11.5 sacks in his rookie season. Now consider that they were essentially asked to do the same thing under his D Von had a better overall rookie season. But I believe that the Broncos had a vastly superior defense talent wise that year vs the Raiders last year.  Take everything with a grain of salt because Mack simply has not done anything stats wise on par with Von."
DenverBroncos,387xsv,bebaker,2,Tue Jun 2 15:03:02 2015 UTC,Von Miller bulked up on Del Rio as well. That could have been him trying to match more what Del Rio was after in a pass rusher. It could very well be that Del Rio much prefers power rushers to speed rushers not necessarily because one is better but because his style and scheme works better with one over the other.
DenverBroncos,387xsv,Ezeran,4,Tue Jun 2 15:41:53 2015 UTC,Very valid point! That could be the exact reason Von got bigger. I don't think the extra load on top of a bad ACL did him any favors though. In fact I would wager the extra weight directly led to a ACL tear.
DenverBroncos,387xsv,bebaker,16,Tue Jun 2 16:23:56 2015 UTC,"Isn't this less of knock on Miller and more just an analyst of Mack and how he's more a power rusher where as Miller is more on the speed side? I mean a direct quote from the article is   ""They're different but they're both special."""
DenverBroncos,387xsv,Ezeran,6,Tue Jun 2 14:46:57 2015 UTC,"This is more how I took it. I also wouldn't put it past a journalist to spin it to look like JDR is talking shit about Von. There's no question Mack is a beast however, we'll just have to wait and see if he can play consistently. We have to also hope Von can stay healthy."
DenverBroncos,387xsv,BDazzle,2,Tue Jun 2 15:16:53 2015 UTC,Agreed.  It is not surprising that a coach is supporting his current players either.  What are people expecting him to say?  That he has no faith in his players?   Mack is a good player and we will have to worry about him in the coming years.

DenverBroncos,387xsv,Ezeran,5,Tue Jun 2 15:00:34 2015 UTC,"""They're different but they're both special.""   I can't see anywhere where he's doing anything at the expense of Miller though? I mean he says that Mack is more physical but that's not necessarily a knock on Miller as it just means that as Del Rio said they are different. Remember Miller is more a speed guy.  It should also be noted that physical is not used here like when we say we wish our wide receivers were more physical and fought more but in a more strength rush vs speed rush. Von Miller can be physical but it's not his first go to and it shouldn't be he's a speed guy."
DenverBroncos,387xsv,sleepydogg,17,Tue Jun 2 15:39:20 2015 UTC,"Well, I hope he may continue the success that the Raiders have enjoyed for the last ten years."
DenverBroncos,387xsv,yamaha2k11,6,Tue Jun 2 14:28:57 2015 UTC,"Don't worry, even though Del Rio thinks Mack is more physical than Miller, it's not like he's going to properly utilize him.  I hope Mack likes vanilla, because he's going to be a part of some pretty bland and unimaginative blitzes."

I'll remember him fondly, but I don't like him talking shit about us after we gave him a chance after he flamed out in Jacksonville. You don't see Fox doing the same shit.  I'm not saying he's a crappy coach, I'm just saying that he did a bad job utilizing Miller and Ware to their full potential. I think part of it is the scheme. Hopefully switching back to a 3-4 will alleviate that."

He seems to be fitting right in though - trash talking right out of the gate on a team that's a dumpster fire.  It will just make it more sweet when we wipe the floor with their asses.  Can't wait to see CJ and Peyton tear it up against them again.  It could actually be a good thing too, getting our team to mesh better under our new coaches by reminding us how garbage the last ones were."
DenverBroncos,387xsv,Fridden,1 point,Tue Jun 2 14:43:58 2015 UTC,Fuck Del Rio. I was happy his first year here. Our defense improved but the two years following he was the reason this defense had played so bad. So glad he is gone.
DenverBroncos,387xsv,jigglewitit6,0,Wed Jun 3 07:24:24 2015 UTC,"Its the Raiders, they're a joke. If Khalil is so much more physical, how come Von Miller is so much better?"

DenverBroncos,382jhv,igobychuck,7,Mon Jun 1 12:37:25 2015 UTC,"If Manning stays healthy we will win the division, anyone's guess as to what happens in the playoffs.   Yep, as it always is.  Playoffs are a crapshoot, you can't predict them with any accuracy.  But as far as how far the team goes, calling us regressing without seeing Peyton regress is folly IMO."
DenverBroncos,382jhv,ahbadgerbadgerbadger,3,Mon Jun 1 13:54:30 2015 UTC,"Well they probably think that the end of last season was Peyton regressing, never mind that he was injured. So in their minds, it's already begun. But like /u/igobychuck said, its sensationalist garbage with the sole intention of stirring up the pot through controversy in order to gain exposure."
DenverBroncos,382jhv,taotechill,1 point,Mon Jun 1 14:41:37 2015 UTC,"Yep.  Don't get me wrong, Peyton has a shelf life, but I don't think we're at that point yet.  I still don't think there's a team in the NFL that wants to see us in the playoffs when healthy."
DenverBroncos,382jhv,ahbadgerbadgerbadger,2,Mon Jun 1 14:45:41 2015 UTC,"Me neither. I re-watched all of Super Bowl 32 yesterday for the first time since it happened (I miss football) and one of my main draws from it was how little passing Elway actually did. He was only 12/22 for 123 yards. He had one TD he ran in and the rest was mainly Terrell Davis (30 carries, 157 yards, 3 TDs). Elway more or less acted as a game manager. So even if Peyton has regressed some, with our new coaching staff and scheme, I see us doing quite well. Especially if CJ stays healthy and keeps performing as he has, Peyton might not even be the biggest threat on our team."
DenverBroncos,382jhv,taotechill,1 point,Mon Jun 1 15:26:34 2015 UTC,The profile of the guy that wrote it says that he's a Chiefs fan so mystery solved.
DenverBroncos,382jhv,Greeney494,14,Mon Jun 1 23:30:10 2015 UTC,"They seem to think that our offense is the only reason we've been so successful. Of course Manning plays a vital role (and how quickly they seem to forget his ability to turn average players into good ones, and good players into great ones), but our D is going to STIFLE opposing offenses. Who's going to beat us? The Chiefs' mediocre offense, with an aging Charles and one, maybe two legitimate receiving threats (that aren't really that intimidating)? The Raide--ha, I can't even say that with a straight face. Perhaps the Chargers can give us a run for our money -- they always do -- but nothing I saw in the off-season or I've seen over the past few seasons leads me to believe they will be able to take the AFCW crown away from us. At least not this year."
DenverBroncos,382jhv,baha24,-2,Mon Jun 1 13:24:30 2015 UTC,I love how people forget about our D. But once they enter the no fly zone and their constantly feeling pressure  they will be reminded very quickly. We could just give the ball to fuckin CJ and we would probably do fine. But luckily we have 2 amazing WR so we dont have to rely on our ground game. Oh...we also have Peyton Fuckin Manning.
DenverBroncos,382jhv,iamthemovie411,8,Mon Jun 1 18:46:28 2015 UTC,"Kubiak needing a mobile qb is something I am so sick of hearing. A good coach will adjust his scheme to fit his players, and that's exactly what Kubiak will do."
DenverBroncos,382jhv,vearson26,2,Mon Jun 1 14:06:32 2015 UTC,There isn't a coach in the league who wouldn't give an arm and a leg for the chance to coach a Peyton Manning led offense. Any coach would change their style to fit the Peyton Manning style. I'm excited to see what Kubiak's run-favouring offense can do for Peyton's play-action passes.

Yeah, Elway is totally gonna bring in a coach that doesn't fit his roster. The Ravens ran about 25 boots last year. It's not a major part of the offense.   Talented Texans roster? Holy shit, man.

DenverBroncos,37tgu1,i_enjoy_lemonade,20,Sat May 30 06:42:36 2015 UTC,"Nice job. Maybe add some replays next time ? :)  I really feel like CJ's the real deal. Not because of his stats, but because when you watch him play you see the vision, you see the lower body strength, you see the burst and lateral agility. A powerful combination, of which only straight-line speed is missing, but it's the less important attribute in a RB. You just don't find an AP everyday, and behind our patchwork O-line I think he's just the man.  Maybe behind a better O-line Ball or even Hillman could have better stats but, for our today's broncos, because of what you see on tape and not some circlejerk effect, I feel like he can really be a 1300+ yards runner (and 500+ receiver) if he can handle the workload (and that's something no one can know beforehand). Only thing that I can see slowing him down is even more horrible OL play than last year, and of course injury."

DenverBroncos,37q21k,baha24,66,Fri May 29 14:27:12 2015 UTC,"The sky began to fall in Denver on Thursday after the report that Pro Bowl left tackle Ryan Clady is likely out for the season with a torn ACL. This leaves right guard Louis Vasquez as the only remaining starter from last year's offensive line. This many changes up front can doom your season, especially when its fate hinges on protecting 39-year-old Peyton Manning. We already had Denver's offensive line pegged as the team's biggest weakness, but it just got weaker.  In his 18th season, Manning has arguably never had an offensive line this unaccomplished. The Broncos are potentially going to have to start a second-round rookie at left tackle (Ty Sambrailo). Left guard Shelley Smith, signed in March, has 11 career starts. Center Gino Gradkowski, acquired from Baltimore in April, has 16 career starts, and will face competition from Max Garcia, a fourth-round rookie. On Thursday, suddenly desperate for depth, Denver signed right tackle Ryan Harris, who started 15 games for Kansas City last year.  There is also the issue of new coach Gary Kubiak meshing his offensive scheme with Manning's. The change is likely to mean more snaps from under center and more play-action. Clearly, the Broncos have a ton of work ahead of them to make this offense still run smoothly come September.  Then again, as long as Manning is the quarterback, does it really matter who starts along the offensive line?  Clady was lost in Week 2 of the 2013 season and Denver still went on to break many offensive records with the unknown Chris Clark at left tackle. The line was a weakness for the Broncos again last year, with several players either benched or switched to other positions at midseason. Denver still finished as the No. 3 offense in Football Outsiders' DVOA ratings (explained here). The offensive line ranked first in adjusted sack rate, but by now we know Manning's quick decision-making is the main reason for that.  Despite all the turmoil up front last year, Manning was under pressure just 13.1 percent of the time in 2014 -- the lowest for any quarterback since 2010 according to the game charting Football Outsiders does in conjunction with ESPN Stats & Information (see chart). In fact, Manning has been the least-pressured quarterback in the NFL each of the last four seasons he's played (skipping 2011, of course). He has accomplished this with two teams, three offensive coordinators, and 18 different starting offensive linemen.  Lowest Pressure Rate Faced Since 2010 (Minimum 200 Plays) RANK    QUARTERBACK TEAM    YEAR    PRESSURE PCT. 1   Peyton Manning  Broncos 2014    13.1% 2   Peyton Manning  Broncos 2012    13.3% 3   Peyton Manning  Colts   2010    13.8% 4   Matt Hasselbeck Titans  2011    13.9% 5   Matt Hasselbeck Titans  2012    14.4% 6   Peyton Manning  Broncos 2013    14.8% 7   Matthew Stafford    Lions   2012    15.3% 8   Tom Brady   Patriots    2012    15.5%  Manning, who has the lowest sack rate (3.07 percent) in NFL history, is essentially offensive line-proof. No other quarterback negates pass pressure the way he has for his whole career. Stick any five-man combination in front of him and he'll make it work.  At least, that's how his career has gone to this point. At age 39, there has to be serious concern over the ability to stay healthy for a full season. Warren Moon, Doug Flutie and Brett Favre (twice) are the only quarterbacks to start a full 16-game season at age 39 or older. The only other QB that old to start even 10 games was a 41-year-old Vinny Testaverde with the 2004 Cowboys, and he threw a league-high 20 interceptions.  Years from now, Manning will still be able to get the ball out in less than 2.5 seconds with the best of them. But all it takes is one bad play to wreck Denver's season. When you have such inexperienced linemen and a lack of continuity up front, blown assignments become a bigger concern. Those plays could mean a clean shot on an old quarterback who has recently endured the scars of four neck surgeries, suffered a high ankle sprain in 2013, and struggled playing with a torn quad for the second half of last season.  No one can accurately predict injuries. Clady started the first 82 games of his career for Denver before suffering two season-ending injuries in the last three years (he missed most of 2013 with a Lisfranc injury to his left foot). We cannot say Manning will stay healthy all season, but with that as a caveat, there is no other reason to think he will not keep Denver in contention regardless of the line in front of him.  He's done it forever.  Peyton Manning was sacked just 22 times in his rookie season. Getty Images As a rookie in Indianapolis, Manning took control of an offense that allowed 62 sacks in 1997. He was sacked only 22 times. The 40-sack decline is tied for the third largest since 1970. That 1998 line featured three starters in their first or second seasons plus Tony Mandarich, one of the biggest draft busts ever, at right guard.  Manning was a MVP candidate in 1999 and 2000. His starting centers in those years were Larry Moore (1999) and Jeff Saturday (2000). Both were undrafted free agents who spent time at guard and had zero starts at center in the NFL prior to those seasons.  Left tackle Tarik Glenn, who played for the Colts from 1997 to 2006, was one of the best teammates Manning has ever had. He only missed six games in his career, but they came at an important time in the 2003 season. Sixth-round rookie Makoa Freitas was pressed into action as Manning's blindside protector. In those six games -- four of which were against top-10 defenses -- Manning completed 66 percent of his passes for 11 touchdowns and four interceptions. He was sacked on just 1.7 percent of his dropbacks and led the offense to 27 points per game on his way to winning his first MVP. Freitas never started another game or played for another NFL team.  The point is this: Manning's ability to control the game at the line has always negated any weaknesses up front. Denver is somewhat fortunate to have this happen in May, leaving plenty of time to prepare for the season. Given that the Broncos are returning to Kubiak's classic zone-blocking scheme, maybe it's not so bad that most of the linemen have just joined the team in the last few months. They can learn together, and it helps that Smith (2011 Texans), Gradkowski (2014 Ravens) and Harris (2012-13 Texans) have been part of past Kubiak offenses.  More importantly, this Kubiak-led offense is also a Manning-led offense, and as long as he is healthy, then all expectations should be for familiar results. The sky didn't fall in Denver on Thursday. It just got a tad darker."

DenverBroncos,37q21k,mack2nite,10,Sat May 30 04:22:43 2015 UTC,"Thanks!  Some interesting stuff here, but I feel like they painted a picture that it doesn't matter who's up front as long as PFM is there. There was only a brief mention that all it takes is one blown play to end the 39 yr-old QB's season. Manning is smart, does his homework, and often knows where he's going with the ball before the snap. That doesn't mean he can't be even more effective with a stout line. Deeper routes would open up with more time and Peyton may need a couple more seconds to decipher schemes from evil asssholes like BB. Unless I missed it, there's also a complete disregard for run blocking in this article. We have good backs, but they'll be hampered by shit blocking just like any other RB would be. Without a respectable run game, PFM will be throwing balls into double coverage all damn year while the d line pins their ears back and abuses our newbie linemen."
DenverBroncos,37q21k,mack2nite,4,Fri May 29 16:46:04 2015 UTC,"Unless I missed it, there's also a complete disregard for run blocking in this article.   Yeah, I was thinking the same thing, but I think that's (hopefully) where Kubiak and Dennison can work wonders in cultivating new players.  Also, while the novice line isn't a big issue now, we'll definitely want to address it next off-season if Peyton retires and we go with Brock (or any other QB, for that matter)."

DenverBroncos,37pwdr,Saint3Dx,5,Fri May 29 14:19:31 2015 UTC,This sucks at Raiders-like proportions. He'd be smart to renegotiate and accept an incentive laden deal ... if the Broncos are willing. Elway has been pretty cold when it comes to making roster decisions.
DenverBroncos,37pwdr,mack2nite,11,Fri May 29 22:27:28 2015 UTC,"It would be such a shame and it reminds me of Jake Long, but Clady was better longer."
DenverBroncos,37pwdr,bmsuperfly,3,Fri May 29 14:06:20 2015 UTC,"If someone else comes in and plays decently well, Clady is gone. It is unfortunate, but this is business and we can't pay an injury-ridden guy top money when there is someone out there that can do the job for more than half the price. Big if though, but again Chris Clark performed decent for us in 2013 so there is that."
DenverBroncos,37pwdr,Jontacular,2,Sat May 30 14:44:36 2015 UTC,He has 10 mil cap hit. Played 18? Games in what will be 3 seasons. We have some big contracts coming up. Hes definitely gone if one of these rookies is half way decent . Maybe even if they are not.
DenverBroncos,37pwdr,lsjunior,1 point,Sat May 30 14:11:55 2015 UTC,I read somewhere (and the source might be unreliable) that Clady's guaranteed money next season and season after that is a combined 1.8 million. So take the dead money hit and not pay him I believe 9.5 mill next season on top of the 10 this season for not playing. I wouldn't be opposed to trading him for anything we could possibly get.

The guy has worked his butt off for years, working his way from scout team d-line back in the McDaniels days (giving up his dream of flying jets for the Air Force) then switched to O-line and has made the active roster. He has been consistently improving and the only place left for him to go is the starting lineup.  Edit2: Looks like I was right! Just had my tackles switched."
DenverBroncos,37ql9d,NUGGman,0,Fri May 29 20:22:46 2015 UTC,I'm not sold on Garland until I see improved play.  Just because someone works their tail off doesn't mean they have the skill set to be a starting caliber player.  He could change my mind with improved play but as of now he's a warrior in practice and below average talent on gamedays.
DenverBroncos,37ql9d,kaeoz7,4,Sun May 31 01:29:28 2015 UTC,"Clark-Smith-Grad-Vasquez-Sambrailo   Clark will start at LT due to his experience. He was a good replacement in 2013. He just needs to stay away from the right side. There is a better chance Harris starts over Clark than Ty.   If you were a QB, would you trust a rookie protecting your blindside?"
DenverBroncos,37ql9d,ThrowbackBlue58,2,Fri May 29 18:22:25 2015 UTC,"That's an excellent point actually, Peyton would definitely want an experienced veteran protecting his blind side."

Orlando Franklin also benefited from that quick release but still managed to get manhandled in the Super Bowl.   Clady also benefited from that quick release, but still gave up a strip/sack to a nobody in the playoff loss to the Colts.

DenverBroncos,37ql9d,bmsuperfly,3,Fri May 29 16:59:08 2015 UTC,"Sambrailo - Smith - Garcia - Vasquez - Harris  I'm guessing Ty on the left based off of fact that I think Peyton was very sour on Clark in the right last season, and I think the fact he 'did well at LT' in 2013 was more a product of Manning's quick striking.  I think we start Shelly Smith at LG really only because I don't see another option and I don't think Schofield moves inside. We might see Gradkowsi here as well.  Garcia starts at center. After the draft I hadn't heard a lot about him, so I took some time to utilize the SEC network to rewatch some of his games. He looked really fluid laterally, and he showed a good head for middle blitzing when teams like Alabama tried to pressure.  Vasquez is a no-brainer.  Harris is the RT if only because of his familiarity with the system. Scho could challenge now that he's going to get more practice reps.  But to be totally honest, in the next 7-8 weeks so much could change that we could all look silly."
DenverBroncos,37ql9d,troubledhumans,1 point,Fri May 29 20:04:41 2015 UTC,"I hope Garcia gets the start. Much like yourself, I didn't know who the hell he was when we drafted him.  However he has grown on me a lot."

DenverBroncos,37ql9d,Sienna_Crush,1 point,Sat May 30 17:48:02 2015 UTC,"Still a hell of a lot of offseason to go, but in light of the Clady injury and based off of what I've heard I think this may be what we see come opening day (given no more injuries obviously)   LT Sambrailo (given first crack at the job and CL was impressed by his quick feet)   LG Garland (apparently he has done a great job of outplaying smith thus far and is playing with the ones. Big Al brought up a great point the other day. This is a system that asks more of its OL in terms of willingness to do the hard dirty stuff more than anything. This kid is playing for his career.)   C Paradis (all I hear is how impressed the coaches are with Paradis but Grad is playing with the ones. I think its just because he knows the system and breaking in a new OC on the fly will retard the growth of the offense as a whole. I still think Matt will slide into the starting role in TC once he has the calls down.)   RG Vasquez (obviously)   RT Clark (though if he plays like he did last year Harris will be there to step in.)"

Also, they played really well without Clady for 14 games in 2013. Although, his absence really did fucking hurt in the Super Bowl. I'm sure they'll figure it out though."
DenverBroncos,37mg5c,timfressler,8,Thu May 28 18:42:12 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. If anyone can help the Offensive Line it is the coaches that raised up late round picks, street free agents, and UDFAs to create the 97-98 Broncos."

DenverBroncos,37mg5c,Mister_Jay_Peg,3,Fri May 29 02:04:04 2015 UTC,I could also see that happening.

DenverBroncos,37mg5c,aatencio91,2,Thu May 28 19:49:46 2015 UTC,"Clark is proven as a LT. Sambrailo may end up playing LT or LG, Grandkowski and Garcia will fight it out for C, Vasquez at RG, and they just signed Ryan Harris back so he'll be RT."
DenverBroncos,37mg5c,vindawg08,2,Thu May 28 19:51:44 2015 UTC,Hadn't seen the Harris signing until a few minutes ago.  I personally would still rather give Ty a shot at LT before Clark. Seriously. I really dislike him.

DenverBroncos,37mg5c,leechsucka,2,Fri May 29 02:40:03 2015 UTC,I think the general thinking is that patriot fans are all trolls and are just waiting around to annoy people in all the subs and r/nfl. Think about it though. The Pats are a hugely popular (bandwagon) team and have fans all over the country. A Pats fan from Steamboat hanging out r/denverbroncos makes a little bit of sense.

DenverBroncos,37mg5c,Peyton4President,4,Thu May 28 18:33:56 2015 UTC,"Ty to LT, Schofield to RT, Clark backup.  Still have Vasquez at RT, either Gradkowski or the rookie at C, and LG is the only position I don't feel 100% comfortable with."

We're totally set guys. If the line doesnt do well, Peyton will just use his awesome scrambling abilities to extend the play! /s  I'm not saying we are fucked yet, but if this line doesnt come together well and play well, we are fucked. Totally fucked."
DenverBroncos,37mg5c,bigbaumer,3,Thu May 28 18:46:53 2015 UTC,Kubiak and Dennison have made a career of turning rookies and scrubs into stars. No reason they will stop now.

What I am saying is I have faith that Elway drafts well, and Kubiak/Dennison coach the scheme very well.  So outside of having no clue who the LG will be, I am not worried."
DenverBroncos,37mg5c,architimmy,2,Thu May 28 19:28:17 2015 UTC,Yeah I think this is where some moves come back to bite Elway. Traded away depth in Ramirez even with him playing terrible last year and letting Orlando Franklin go to the Chargers. On the bright side Broncos got to the Super Bowl before without Clady and still have the least amount of sacks since Peyton came to Denver
DenverBroncos,37mg5c,CryBerry,2,Thu May 28 22:06:58 2015 UTC,"The Franklin move will hurt a bit, but who on our roster now would we let go of for that $7m is the question.  Ramirez, though, not sorry to see him gone, TBH. Him out and Gradkowski in is slightly in our favor due to the ZBS being installed."
DenverBroncos,37mg5c,BornToulouse,2,Thu May 28 22:10:31 2015 UTC,"Yeah really hope everything turns out well. The money moves I get because you need to pay the stars and Franklin asked for a lot i.e (DT, and Von). I think Clady after this year could be on the chopping block or need to seriously restructure his deal. If anyone can make a great o-line its Kubiak"

DenverBroncos,37mg5c,SawzeBawse,2,Thu May 28 18:46:45 2015 UTC,"I don't think we have the cash, but Chris Meyers is still out there.  He know's Kubiak's system and would be a solid vet making the protection calls.  Could give us more flexibility in shuffling linemen, idk.  FUCK!"

DenverBroncos,37nda5,Gurtang,4,Fri May 29 01:20:40 2015 UTC,I'm afraid we will cut him in the off-season and draft a tackle in the first or second round. He has been injury prone his entire career but he never missed games. He didn't miss a single game until his 2013 injury.

I can hear Phil Simms stupid voice now, ""Well Jim as you know the Broncos have just had bad luck all off season with their offensive line starting of course with the season ending ACL tear to your all-pro Left tackle: Ryan Clady""  Every. Game."
DenverBroncos,37mr1i,theatretech37,5,Fri May 29 00:33:20 2015 UTC,Have you been to /r/nfl?  I can barely go there now.  It is just an echo chamber of how much we are going to regress this year.  This is going to do nothing but keep that circle jerk going.

DenverBroncos,37mr1i,yamaha2k11,7,Sat May 30 18:20:24 2015 UTC,"from PFF:  Harris graded out average in his years with the Texans but was erratic in the 2014 season with the Chiefs. He did not have two consecutive “green” games in a row, fluctuating anywhere between -4.2 to +3.6. A big positive for Harris is his lack of committing penalties. Last season, he only had three called on him and before that, four in two years in Houston. Harris won’t command elite tackle money, but most teams would welcome a disciplined, durable player on the right side.  Can't find just his straight up stats from pff, but at least he could serve as a decent starter."
DenverBroncos,37mr1i,crueg,7,Thu May 28 19:49:19 2015 UTC,"He's actually a decent player. According to PFF, he graded out at -1.6 in 980 snaps at RT last year, which means he's a slightly below average starter. Clady graded out at -2.8 in 1084 snaps at LT for comparison. Good pickup"
DenverBroncos,37mr1i,1234neg,3,Thu May 28 19:52:19 2015 UTC,"Yea, he should be a decent option. Guy has never been the same since he had back surgery after his first (of 3) stints with Denver, and can't seem to last more than a year anywhere. Maybe he wasn't a good fit w/ Fox led offense."
DenverBroncos,37mr1i,snoreee,3,Fri May 29 04:10:15 2015 UTC,Is he any good? Amazing how fast that FO reaction was.

DenverBroncos,37o1zj,nedoma56,5,Fri May 29 01:38:41 2015 UTC,"Slim to none. Try stubhub or nfl ticket exchange. Please don't buy the half price tickets. Yes there are ways around the restrictions but they are there for the people that put their tax money into building the stadium.  Lot C is the biggest tailgate spot. If you don't have a pass to park there, just show up with a case of beer and you will be fine.  Buckhorn Exchange was the first restaurant in Denver and serves a variety of wild game. It's good for someone visiting. Also get a breakfast burrito from Santiagos.  Need more info on what you are looking for. I don't have a schedule in front of me so I don't know when the Broncos play GB but if a concert is happening at Red Rocks, definitely do that. 16th street is a pretty touristy spot. Maybe go skiing of it is late enough for the resorts to be open (1 hour min from Denver). Spend a day on some brewery tours.    If you give some more details on your last two questions,  I can probably give more detailed responses. Also, had a chance to visit Lambeau last year as an offshoot from my Algoma trip.

DenverBroncos,37o1zj,melonman456,1 point,Sat May 30 05:15:31 2015 UTC,"""this is not accurate as far as I know"". That sentence kinda contradicts itself.   In 2013 tickets went on sale in July. 2014 I believe it was June. I've been told by someone in the know to expect them in August. I might be wrong, but I know tickets weren't sold in June in 2013."
DenverBroncos,37o1zj,steve1186,1 point,Sat May 30 03:21:48 2015 UTC,"Lived in Colorado my whole life (28 years old)until last 2 years and went to college right outside of Denver. Parents are season ticket holders and I've been attending Bronco games since before I could walk. Here are the simplest answers to your questions.   -No chance in hell is my guess and even if you manage it somehow they won't be the best of seats and since your coming in from out of town and have all the money sunk into travel expenses you won't want to be stuck in top corner of stadium. Be beware, I expect this to be the most expensive game of the year to attend buying tickets on any secondary market. Consider yourself lucky if you can find good tickets for less than $300 per.   -Tailgating happens in stadium parking but it can be expensive and you have to get in there very early. Best bet might be to get there 2+ hours before and walk around with 12 pack till you find some other tailgating Packer fans.  -For food check sites like westword or just general travel sites to find something or your liking as food preference is always so subjective.  -I always tell people new to Denver to check out micro breweries. There are plenty downtown within walking distance of each other but also more than can named in and around greater Denver area. 16th street in downtown is usually named as a tourist highlight. If your into scenic things I would say a good afternoon drive (weather permitting) would be the following drive Denver-Boulder-Nederland-Black Hawk-Evergreen-Morrison(Red Rocks Amphitheater)-Golden-Denver. Plugging that into google says approx 3 hours so say 4 due to stopping and checking things out."

DenverBroncos,37o1zj,steve1186,1 point,Fri May 29 15:32:59 2015 UTC,"I would just venture around the Five Points area, there are half dozen all within easy walking distance and that way you have have your favorite style (IPA, brown, hef, aged, etc) at each and determine what you like the best. Or my favorite thing to do at a brewery I've never been to; ask for the sampler(make sure they include seasonal), then after drinking that pick the one favorite and have a pint of it.  There are so many good choices and everyone has different opinions that I would just take a little time do research on my own and figure out what is best for you."
DenverBroncos,37o1zj,steve1186,1 point,Sat May 30 05:16:40 2015 UTC,"My girlfriend is a huge Packers fan and we'll be attending the game. If you'd like, send me a PM and we'd be happy to meet up with you the day of the game for some beer, brats, and good old fashioned tailgating."
DenverBroncos,37o1zj,steve1186,2,Wed Jun 3 20:09:15 2015 UTC,I more than likely will be in tow with a 12er (probably don't want to waste my entire carry on space) of Spotted Cow. I'll PM you closer to gameday! Any lead on how you're getting your tickets?
DenverBroncos,37o1zj,snoreee,1 point,Sat May 30 03:20:51 2015 UTC,"Perfect, I'm a huge fan of Spotted Cow!   We're going to go for the half-price tickets first, and then if we can't get those, we'll spring for the single-game tickets. If you can't land the half-price tickets, it'll probably be around $70-$90 per ticket for an upper-level seat, but I actually prefer the higher seating since you get a great view of the mountains and sunset during the game.   Keep an eye on denverbroncos.com to see when the tickets go on sale. They've been hard to predict in the past - sometimes they go on sale in late June, and sometimes in early August. But if you can land the half-price tickets (which go on sale one random morning at 10am MST for $35), that's an unbeatable deal. I'll send you a PM when I find out which day those go on sale.  Glad you're making the trip out  here! My girlfriend would be beyond excited to tailgate with another Packers fan, so we'd love to meet you on gameday."
DenverBroncos,37o1zj,snoreee,2,Sat May 30 05:17:44 2015 UTC,Does she have ties to Wisconsin in anyway? Packers fans are all over the earth but generally have some sort of tie to Wisconsin.

DenverBroncos,37mn7e,BornToulouse,8,Thu May 28 19:33:39 2015 UTC,I've never seen the entire comic until now. Life is complete.
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,vindawg08,2,Thu May 28 19:23:05 2015 UTC,In my opinion the shorter comic is absolutely superior.
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,solsethop,1 point,Thu May 28 23:08:50 2015 UTC,But this one adds so much depth and really draws you in
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,vindawg08,5,Thu May 28 23:24:25 2015 UTC,"I love and hate this comic, I love it because it's so great and I hate it because it's always in a reddit about something I care about."
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,SuburbanHell,4,Thu May 28 19:30:13 2015 UTC,I'm getting flashbacks to 2013 when fans thought the sky was falling after Clady was lost for the season.
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,mysterious_pube,2,Thu May 28 20:16:52 2015 UTC,And it's only May. This sub needs fall camp to start like nobodies business.
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,Greeney494,2,Thu May 28 23:21:53 2015 UTC,"We had a much better line in 2013. Franklin, Beadles, Ramirez, Vasques, Clady. With Clady going down we still had good pieces on the Oline. Now we have a ton of question marks and one solid piece is now gone."
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,PMeist,0,Thu May 28 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"Clady was not very good last year, and the line didn't do well even with him. The team didn't lose the All Pro he once was. They lost an average player. At his current level of play, he's not difficult to replace.   Also, question marks aren't necessarily bad. Fans always assume the worst when they don't know the answer. The line this year could be better than last year."
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,mysterious_pube,1 point,Fri May 29 00:41:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you are wrong. However saying Clady was bad last year is a over the top. He started off terrible sure, but he is coming off an injury that ends careers. He also stepped up in his run blocking towards the end of the year, that was a weakness in him before he was injured. He had to develop past his injury and he did. I bet he would have been a great player this year if not for the ACL. Was he the Clady we all remember? No. Was he the Clady we needed? Nope. He was serviceable though,  not worth the salary but he protected Peyton pretty well and threw up some awesome blocks for CJ towards the last games."
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,RedRiderJman,1 point,Mon Jun 1 07:13:48 2015 UTC,"I never said he was bad. I said he was average, which is pretty much synonymous with serviceable.  Maybe Clady would have had a great 2015, but I didn't see anything last year to suggest he'd make that sort of recovery. It doesn't really matter now, though. I just hope Denver finds a young guy this year who can replace Clady, because with Clady's recent history of severe injuries (two blown out knees, torn labrum, lisfranc), it's not wise to rely on him and definitely not wise to continue paying him 10 mil a year when cap space is so precious."
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,mysterious_pube,2,Mon Jun 1 08:20:31 2015 UTC,"right, we've never done anything of note without him.  oh wait the last year we didn't have Clady we made it to the fuck mothering super bowl."
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,Seruphim5388,2,Fri May 29 01:55:25 2015 UTC,We're not the Niners.
DenverBroncos,37mn7e,fantasygod777,1 point,Fri May 29 05:19:04 2015 UTC,This sucks. But we will be ok.
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,baha24,3,Thu May 28 18:52:58 2015 UTC,I hope so because we may now have the worst OL in the league this year.
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,architimmy,0,Fri May 29 02:36:15 2015 UTC,"Yes, it's Bleacher Report, and yes, they're telling us what we already know, but it's nice to see the perennial purveyors of conventional wisdom give us some well-deserved credit."
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,OkAutopilot,7,Thu May 28 18:53:58 2015 UTC,"We don't have the best secondary in the league, I don't think anyone thinks that. Maybe the best DB core, but Seattle's FS and SS are the best in the league and that puts them over the top as a whole unit."
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,OkAutopilot,3,Thu May 28 21:05:48 2015 UTC,"They have three pro bowlers and we have three pro bowlers. They have a new mediocre CB and we have a new (presumably) mediocre FS. If anything, it's a crapshoot."
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,OkAutopilot,5,Thu May 28 21:16:32 2015 UTC,"It's a lot closer than you make it. The only position that Seattle has as a big advantage over Denver is FS. Ward is also one of the top SS, Harris is on par with Sherman. We also have a big advantage over them at the 2nd corner position and potentially nickel, their 2nd corner is an average at best vet and their nickel a question mark"
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,TheClayroo,3,Thu May 28 21:20:25 2015 UTC,"Ward is a very good SS, Kam Chancellor may end up being the best FS of all time. Here's what Ronnie Lott had to say on him:   “Kam Chancellor right now is as good as any safety that’s played in the game of football,” Lott said. “It’s hard for me to say this, but there was only one guy that I know that’s better and that’s Kenny Easley. He was defensive player of the year and best player to play the safety position, ever. He is getting to close to being in that community of greatness. And that is hard for me to say that because I have the utmost respect for Kenny Easley.""   I live in Seattle so I'm able to watch both teams games every week, and while it might be closer this year to us being on par with them I think Jeremy Lane is being significantly underrated (he'll be able to fill Maxwell's role quite well) and the safety play of that team is far superior to ours on every level."
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,quilofish,3,Thu May 28 21:26:29 2015 UTC,"Kam Chancellor is an SS, and to say he's a potential GOAT is a load of bull. He's an elite player benefiting from hype, recognition, and a fantastic 2013 post season. 2013 regular season Eric Berry and TJ Ward were every bit as good as him. Last season he had a bit of a down year, and yeah it was probably due to injury, but how about he separates himself from his current peers before we start calling him a potential GOAT?   Seattle has a big advantage at FS, but they absolutely do not at SS.  Cary Williams will likely be their other corner and Lane will probably be the nickel. Williams doesn't come close to Talib, and lets their's a mix up and Lane becomes a pretty good corner opposite of Sherman, he's still not close to Talib."
DenverBroncos,37mkcn,Dbencomo19,2,Thu May 28 21:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying he's a potential GOAT, the greatest safety of all time Ronnie Lott is. Kam's floor is TJ Ward and his ceiling is the best safety play in post season history, as you mentioned (2013 postseason +12.6 PFF grade, only players higher since 2008 were both on offense)."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,MountCRushmore,5,Thu May 28 18:48:01 2015 UTC,"It very well could happen, poor bastard is super injury prone."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,SuburbanHell,1 point,Thu May 28 19:00:30 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't say that. He has had two unrelated injuries, and other than that he's never missed a game."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,Formber,7,Thu May 28 22:17:06 2015 UTC,"Clady's salary for this season is fully guaranteed. If the Broncos cut him this season, they literally wouldn't save a dime on the cap. The Broncos are paying 11.8 mil for him regardless of if he is on the roster.  After this season things get interesting. Only 1.2 million of his 9.5 million salary is guaranteed next year. So the Broncos need to decide whether to eat the 1.8 million in dead salary cap money (after his signing bonus is taken into account) or pay him 9.5 million to stay on the roster.   None of Clady's 2017 contract is guaranteed, so it is basically a 10 million dollar team option."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,Yannkee,1 point,Thu May 28 19:02:44 2015 UTC,"I doubt they'd cut him this year, but he could be a cap casualty next season, especially if he doesn't bounce back from this to be ready to play at the level the expect from him."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,SuburbanHell,3,Fri May 29 02:56:11 2015 UTC,"If Sambrailo or Schofield have a solid year at LT, Ryan Clady will probably be cut before 2016."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,a_D_u_B,1 point,Thu May 28 19:47:14 2015 UTC,"I would think we drop him. A restructure would be nice, but we need all the money we can get going into next year. Being out two of the last three seasons is too much."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,martinap,1 point,Thu May 28 19:01:07 2015 UTC,"I can guarantee you that we're listening to trade offers for him, but we won't cut him this year. If someone wants to give up something good (I'm thinking a 3rd, but I'm really not sure how to value him), then he's gone.  I think we'll definitely try to restructure him after this year, but he might want to hit the market, if he doesn't think he'll be a good fit in the ZBS."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,natziel,2,Thu May 28 19:07:53 2015 UTC,"Well he is actually a perfect fit for the ZBS and had the most success of his career in that system, so I don't think that will be the issue"
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,Yannkee,3,Thu May 28 20:34:30 2015 UTC,"He is less than worthless in terms of trade value this season.   The other team would need to eat 11.8 million this season, then has Clady on a 2-year/19.5 million dollar deal. Given his injuries and level of play in his last few games, no team would touch him on that salary."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,sleepydogg,1 point,Thu May 28 19:13:48 2015 UTC,"Technically, I think $2.1 million of that is already paid (roster & signing bonuses), so the other team wouldn't have to pay the whole amount.  But still, no team would ever trade for him."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,crueg,1 point,Fri May 29 02:38:05 2015 UTC,"I don't think we cut or trade him. Like someone already pointed out, that's a shitload of wasted money this season, and aside last season, Clady has been one of the best in the league. Injuries suck, but I think he'll be kept around."
DenverBroncos,37mjn3,ThrowbackBlue58,1 point,Fri May 29 00:46:01 2015 UTC,He probably already played his last game with the Broncos to be honest. It makes it easier to cut him next season.

DenverBroncos,37l8wf,God_Man,3,Thu May 28 19:24:08 2015 UTC,"Oh come on, are you guys seriously getting pissed that he is trying to get a paycheck?  You could get just as pissed at the other big WRs that are doing almost the exact same thing.  None of them want to bite the bullet first to set a price for the other ones.  DT has earned himself a nice payday as he is easily one of the top 5 receivers in the league and arguably one of the top 3.   It baffles me how pissed people get in this sub when a player leaves for another team or demands a bigger paycheck.  This is a daily thing in professional sports.  Cheer for your team and the players on your team."
DenverBroncos,37l8wf,AdaAstra,1 point,Fri May 29 04:40:32 2015 UTC,"I'm sure most people understand the logic. I don't fault DT for being smart about this contract. It's likely going to be the source of wealth he depends on for the rest of his life. But, I also understand hard feelings. Devout fans are so emotionally vested in their team and favorite players that they feel like jaded lovers when their guys hold out or sign with another squad. To them you probably sound like a jerk for pointing out all the logical reasons why their GF/BF is looking for greener pastures."
DenverBroncos,37l8wf,mack2nite,1 point,Fri May 29 16:25:50 2015 UTC,"are you guys seriously getting pissed that he is trying to get a paycheck?   Little bit.   You could get just as pissed at the other big WRs that are doing almost the exact same thing.   Yep.  If I cared about them or those teams.    This:   None of them want to bite the bullet first to set a price for the other ones.   Absolutely does not prevent this:    DT has earned himself a nice payday as he is easily one of the top 5 receivers in the league and arguably one of the top 3.    And then,    It baffles me how pissed people get in this sub when a player leaves for another team or demands a bigger paycheck.   How hard is it to comprehend?  People like teams, people like players.  When someone they like is on a team they like, it's nice.  When someone they like is not on a team they like, it isn't as nice.  Not fucking rocket science.    Cheer for your team and the players on your team.   Insofar as I respect and admire those players.  If they leave and are replaced by ones people don't respect or admire, why cheer for some random corporate entitiy?  Players, coaches, GMs, even owners come and go.  It's the actual people that are actually a part of the organization that make it worth cheering for."
DenverBroncos,37l8wf,bigrobwoot,1 point,Fri May 29 18:57:50 2015 UTC,"I agree. I like sentiment of cheering for the players/personnel on your favorite team, but there's a point where it's not automatic. Not a lot of people were McDaniels fans, or Cutler fans...   Don't get me wrong. I LOVE DT, and think he's an awesome player, and I love humble guys. It sucks he's dragging this out, but I can see both sides. He's a top 3-5 WR and wants to get paid like one. But the Broncos are running a business, and don't want to overpay.   Personally, I hope he gets signed, and I hope it's not the biggest WR contract in the NFL, cuz he's not quite Megatron in his prime. I also think he deserves a top 5-10 contract, though. Maybe the Clady injury history will help clear up cap space in the offseason. Or, hopefully, they can win a ring and Peyton can retire happy so we can see what the Lobster has, and the team can afford to pay the superstars what they deserve.   I wish every Bronco had CHJ's attitude when it comes to team-friendly contracts; I also understand that they rightfully feel entitled to make what they deserved. There's a middle ground there that I hope they find with DT."
DenverBroncos,37n9b2,Danserud,2,Thu May 28 21:51:31 2015 UTC,"The one bright side to this is that his injury happened well before the preseason. We've got time to assemble a quality oline before the regular season starts, no crazy mid season shuffles and change ups, or at least I hope."
DenverBroncos,37ml3p,LastSonofAnshan,5,Thu May 28 18:58:20 2015 UTC,"The money has to be right, because we really don't have a ton of cap space, and we can't give up the farm.  But personally, I would give Sambrailo the firsy crack, put Schofield at RT, have Clark backing the up, and then we go from there."
DenverBroncos,37ml3p,Mister_Jay_Peg,2,Thu May 28 19:33:49 2015 UTC,"These were my exact thoughts for a number of reasons.  1) Ty needs to put on weight and muscle they said, on the left he won't be asked to be the power guy as much.  2) Schofield did put on the weight he needed to play RT.  3) We know how well Clark played RT..."

Personally, well, it depends on how the other guys on the roster look. With Kubiak coming in, there won't be such a huge emphasis on the passing game, so the loss of DT wouldn't hurt as much as the last couple years. If the other guys look good, yeah, I'd trade DT for Thomas, no question."

DenverBroncos,37ebrc,Crazola,20,Wed May 27 00:26:02 2015 UTC,"OOOkay. I would not advise Craigslist for tickets. I have heard of too many rip-off stories for that to be good advice. I usually get mine through the site or through StubHub. Sometimes you will find deals on one, sometimes its the other, you just have to check both.  You can always buy a tailgating parking pass through the website or through scalpers near the stadium($10-$20) OR you can park at one of the light rail stations and ride the light rail down to the stadium. Lightrail passes vary in price point based on which location you get on the train from but they usually aren't too bad (less than $5). If you are tailgating I would suggest being there a couple hours early to get a primo spot for partying, otherwise arrival via lightrail gets more hectic the closer to game time that you catch the train. I like to get there early anyway to snag any freebies might be going around.  Broncos fans are mostly (and I say this because there is always a couple assholes) cool with opposing team jerseys so wear the gear you want (except for Raiders fans BOOOOOOOOOOO). But seriously, people are usually pretty cool.  Red Rocks is an amazing hike and visit, but I don't think there are any concerts or films around that time because its the end of the outdoor season. While visiting Denver, if you get a chance to experience a ROCKtober game with the Rockies, it can be quite the experience. Other than that, the night life in Denver can be quite the thing. Denver Zoo is cute, but if you get the chance to meander a little farther from Denver, Colorado Springs has the Cheyenne Mountain Zoo and you can FEED THE GIRAFFES. There are a BAJILLION breweries around town and getting a groupon tour of multiple breweries with a sober driver is a great time (or try the Pedal Hopper!)  I hope this helps."

DenverBroncos,37ebrc,codepoet2,5,Wed May 27 02:33:35 2015 UTC,"I would also recommend light rail, but if you're in decent shape, parking near the Pepsi Center is about $10-$20, and it's kind of fun to file in with the crowd, which has good energy.  I always recommend, if people have a rental car, to head about 30 mins west of the city to Lookout Mountain:  live bison herd, great views, and the Buffalo Bill Cody Museum is great if you're even a little bit interested in the ""wild west"" (also the gift shop is delightfully eccentric)."

DenverBroncos,37ebrc,melonman456,5,Wed May 27 03:04:58 2015 UTC,"No Craigslist, just no. We get a couple posts every season of folks who were scammed. The NFL ticket exchange works great, it's a verified source because it's all season tickets, and the chance of scams is so low, because if you get scammed, they lose their season tickets, plus the ability to ever puchase them again.  Traffic/parking is hugely dependent on where you are staying. If it's a downtown hotel or something, most offer some sort of shuttle. If it's outside of downtown, LightRail is a decent way to go, but it does get packed from about 11am forward, and going home it's a squeeze. The stadium also butts up against a semi-dense residential zone to the west, so most of the parking pushes south, making some of the treks kinda long. If your hotel is close enough (within 6-8 miles, maybe use Lyft? I like them better in Denver than Uber because their surge pricing structure is cleaner and more transparent, but I don't know what their multiplier is for games.  Hanging out before or after, if you want to go that route, there are a couple of decent spots near the stadium, but again, because it butts up against residential, there are no bigger hangout-type bars/restaurants like there are near Coors Field or the Pepsi Center because those are downtown.  For ticket LOCATION it's important to know how you enjoy the game.  If you want to get as close as possible, get north endzone. It's cheaper because it's away from the tunnels, but it is the low All-22 view. Sidelines are prohibitive. If you want to go with the fans, get South Stands, under the scoreboard. If you like to critically watch the game, catching all the action in your field of view, I suggest either of the 500 level north corners, to either side of the logo. Personal preference is sections 512-514.  Hope you enjoy your stay here, and if you have any other questions about the city itself, hit me up. I'm not a huge nightlife guy, but I know a lot of the cooler out of the way things to do in the metro area that aren't tourist-trapy."
DenverBroncos,37ebrc,Mister_Jay_Peg,5,Wed May 27 21:49:51 2015 UTC,"I can't really offer advice on the tickets, but I can on the stadium situation.  Usually, parking will be expensive so if you can I would recommend taking the light rail.  It is cheap, a bit crowded but also very reliable, and you will probably meet some cool people on it.  I would recommend getting there at the very least an hour early, but probably 2 hours early.  There are a bunch of tailgates around, and you will have the opportunity to go and see stuff like the ring of fame busts if you want.  Bronco fans are really tame when it comes to opposing fans, however you will get some light-hearted banter.   Unless you are wearing Raiders gear, but in that case you would deserve it."

Wearing your gear... I've never seen anyone do anything horrible.  I'd expect some verbal jabs (I'd expect it anywhere I wear my Broncos gear on the road).  Denver's people are for the most part pretty cool, so I don't think you'd have issues.  As for other things to do: Microbrews!  If beer is your thing. I personally like Breckenridge Brewery... so many good ones to try though.  There is a things called the Brews Cruise.  Coors Tour (in Golden) is fun too if you want to see a larger brewery."
DenverBroncos,37ebrc,codepoet2,1 point,Wed May 27 16:33:44 2015 UTC,"I've always found NFL ticket exchange to be the easiest way to find tickets to games cause they are guaranteed to be the real deal. My parents are Bronco season ticket holders so I can promise my little brother will be in their seats wearing his Vikings jersey so you won't be alone. I wouldn't foresee any problems besides the expected heckling here and there.   Early October weather shouldn't be terrible yet so really doesn't matter on location the seats are in the stadium. Whatever your viewpoint preference is you will enjoy. I would get to stadium approx 2 hours before kickoff so you have plenty of time to park and walk around to enjoy seeing the new sites of visiting a new stadium for the first time. If you're worried about drinking and driving post game take light rail there and stay either in downtown or south along one of the main rail stops. If not I recommend parking along Federal(somewhere between 20th and 26th) it should run your around $20.   Do some brewery tours around the greater Denver area. Plenty of info on google to thumb through. Maybe catch a Rockies game if that is available. Drive to Blackhawk up Clear Creek for a little gambling if that's your thing, plus drive is nice and neat to see. It's approx 40 min from Downtown. If you like to golf and weather permits there are a few courses I would recommend over the others."
DenverBroncos,37ebrc,melonman456,0,Wed May 27 20:08:56 2015 UTC,"Tickets are easy to find. Of course, the safest way is through stub hub or other trusted sites like that, but you can typically find them on craigslist or at the stadium (from people selling theirs) the day of the game. Prices will vary, especially with this being (presumably) Manning's last season. If they Broncos are kicking ass, prices will be very high. If they are horrible, prices will be lower (but not by much). Anyways, tickets won't be an issue at all. Too many scalpers out there to have a ticket shortage actually occur.   As to getting there/traffic. Traffic into the game is typical of any stadium event. It's slow. Plan on it taking 30-45 minutes to move the final 5-6 blocks into the stadium.  If you have lightrail access and don't feel like tailgating, then just take the light rail. You can get off on the Decatur/Federal stop and just walk past all the tailgaters and into the stadium. This is by far the fastest way to get you from your home (or hotel in your case) to your seat.  If you want to tailgate, you'll have to buy parking which can range from $45+ for local businesses allowing you to park in their parking lot to $150-200 to actually park in the stadium. So be prepared.   Oh, and driving FROM the stadium is a nightmare. You're looking at an hour or two minimum to get to the highways to get to where you're going. Again, lightrail is the fastest (but you lose the ability to tailgate).  As for you wearing your Vikings gear. Typically fans are cool, but just like any other city in the world, there will be the drunk assholes who want to start fights. Just hope that you aren't the unlucky person who is their target and you'll be ok. But hey, that's the risk you take with wearing opposing colors. If you want it to go off without a hitch, just dress normally or buy a Manning shirt. Nobody will mess with you then.

DenverBroncos,37dnpk,dlevine09,37,Tue May 26 21:32:35 2015 UTC,"It's not even accurate, at least, not how I reacted.  That's much more fitting for the divisional loss to Baltimore.  The Super Bowl was just... numbness. Disbelief. I couldn't speak. I wasn't angry. It was like a funeral of some one who died unexpectedly. It took forever to accept. Honestly, some times I wonder if I ever did accept it, or if I'm still mentally waiting for SB 48 to be played.   Strangest feeling I've ever experienced from sports."

I felt the same way you described. It was surreal. I didn't assume we would win but I expected we would show up. I literally sat in and finished a case of beer after my girlfriend fell asleep that night. It took me months to come to terms with it.

DenverBroncos,37d41l,NegativeGhostwriter,2,Wed May 27 05:16:11 2015 UTC,"I think a big part of that was offensive ineffectiveness, including Tebow's passion for the 3-and-out.  Timmy said that any drive that ends in a kick is a good drive, but when it puts an already-tired defense on the field standing in their own territory, it's not good at all.  What we saw with the 2011 defense was that it was fantastic, but when it broke, it broke hard because the offense didn't give them a break to take their skates off."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,_Exaybachay_,4,Wed May 27 14:54:32 2015 UTC,"I just checked and actually Orton had a better season than Tebow did in 2011 in most statistics.  I guess the thing I remember is us losing game after game with Orton, and then actually winning some with Tebow.    Also, it looks like the media coverage didn't really make him look worse, since he was actually really bad.  I'm still interested in seeing what Chip can do with him this year though."

Josh McDipshit tried to trade him coming off a pro-bowl caliber year for a backup who had a nice year on one of the most stacked rosters ever (don't forget that other than Brady that 11-7 Pats team was basically the same roster as the 18-1 team). I'd be insulted and not want to work with the guy either.  I know the counter-argument is ""be a pro and don't take things personally."" But imagine if you found out your boss was trying to replace you with someone you felt you were more qualified than? Sure you might say, ""Well I gotta put up with him even if I don't like it because it's my job."" But then what if another company came along and offered you the same job and money as that employer?

DenverBroncos,37d41l,AdaAstra,34,Thu May 28 00:38:36 2015 UTC,"Losing JT is going to hurt.    If DT wants to be the highest paid WR in the league, we we should let him walk.    CJ Anderson has shown he can be great, but he still has more to prove before he would be considered one of the best in the league."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,bcos4life,8,Tue May 26 20:37:18 2015 UTC,"I could not disagree more about JT.   JT was a GREAT pass catcher. He was fast and got good separation. He had solid hands and when he played, he was a TD machine.  But I feel that the cons DEFINITELY outweigh the pros when it comes to JT.  Salary: 9.2 mil cap hit. 2nd highest paid TE. In our offense, a pass catch only TE isn't worth that much.   Blocking: I used to be a staunch defender of JT's blocking. Always said ""He's only been playing for a couple years, blocking takes time."" But I stopped when I realized that one thing doesn't take time when it comes to blocking... effort. JT rarely tried to block. That's why Shannon Sharpe hates his ass, because Shannon HAD to try to block. And I think a HOF TE with 3 rings and two 2,000 yard rushers on his team knows more than all of us about Tight End play.  Durability: None. Simple as that. When a young player can't average more than 8 games a season, due to injury in his first contract, do you really think that's going to get better with age? I won't call his toughness into question, because I don't need to. Whether he really couldn't play, or because he has no heart doesn't matter. He can't stay on the field.   Attitude: Simple fact is that Tight End can be a dirty job. Not just blocking, but by coming off the line, you are expected to make some dirty catches and get some dirty yards. Now, when that ball was in the air, JT was amazing. Boxed out the DB/LB and caught it. But when it came time to take a hit for an extra yard... no thanks. Now, that's his right as a player to not put himself in harms way, but that doesn't mean I have to like it.   I agree with the DT point. In fact, if DT isn't willing to take a hometown discount, let him go. Without Manning, we have no use for a top tier WR. I love DT and don't want his career wasted like Larry Fitzgerald's. But don't let him walk, sign him to a tag and trade him.  We are definitely jumping the gun on the C.J. bandwagon."

DenverBroncos,37d41l,caesarfecit,4,Wed May 27 01:48:09 2015 UTC,"Losing JT is going to hurt.   I think we may miss him in certain situations, but even in the red zone, JT wasn't exactly invincible. He came with a lot of tradeoffs (injury prone, couldn't block etc.) and I think we can make up for him and then some.    If DT wants to be the highest paid WR in the league, we we should let him walk.   Agreed. DT knows he's not going to get top receiver in the league money, even if the GM wasn't Elway. He's either gonna settle for Top 5-ish receiver money, or get more dollars and play for a shit team. I think DT is smarter than that.    CJ Anderson has shown he can be great, but he still has more to prove before he would be considered one of the best in the league.   Agreed. CJ was impressive, but he's still got to prove he can start a full season, be on every team's radar, and still perform."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,cunningcolt,2,Tue May 26 22:15:17 2015 UTC,"I agree, we really need a better RB but they are serviceable while we still have manning. The problem with DT is that he has that Megatron size and speed. Plenty have either but that combination does not come around every day. So I understand the money but still do not believe he should be the highest paid but I completely understand holding him until Manning is gone but if we could get someone similar for less I would be alright."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,penance25,2,Wed May 27 02:28:38 2015 UTC,"There's a saying...""Availability is more important than ability. Orange Julius has one relatively healthy season. He's also a poor blocker. And that wasn't a skill issue, it was a willingness issue. I don't think he has a very good attitude. I think we'll miss the offensive threat in the passing game, but at the same time, when you have a tight end that is a double threat (passing game and run blocking), it keeps the defense honest. Good defenses didn't have to watch the run when JT was in the game, because even if the Broncos did run, he couldn't/wouldn't block effectively. That's why our team as a whole played better/worse based on Green's availability and not Thomas'.  I like DT, and I think it's always worth investing in a top 5 talent, but I wouldn't lose sleep over him leaving if he's asking for #1 money.  CJ earned my respect last year with his ""never say die"" attitude on so many plays, many of them broken. But it's not what you do when nobody expects anything from you, it's what you do when you're in the spotlight. Now he's in the spotlight. I'm with you, he needs to show up this year, last year wasn't enough to be untouchable."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,aljds,14,Tue May 26 23:49:57 2015 UTC,"Our fan base's opinions on running backs change faster than the flavor of the week.  CJ will struggle out of the gate and have a costly fumble and fans will decide he was never that bust and call for him to be cut.  Hillman will have a big 100 yard game and fall in love with him all over again.  Ball will be the forgotten guy, but he'll come in and save the day in the second half of the season (after Hillman gets hurt), and fans will bitch the entire year about how CJ gets too many caries.    It may not happen exactly like that, but I'm sure the fan base will change it's mind a few times about running backs."

DenverBroncos,37d41l,TheClayroo,3,Tue May 26 22:10:52 2015 UTC,I disagree with this one and my unpopular opinion is that CJ Anderson was made to look better because teams play pass defense against us. I think Ball emerges as the clear-cut starting RB by mid-season.
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Grantusmcgrant,3,Wed May 27 15:14:50 2015 UTC,"Aside from injury to CJ, Ball will not be here in the next two years. He has fumbled and struggled his way out for me already."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Quiggibub,1 point,Wed May 27 15:29:54 2015 UTC,I will think Ball is a decent back when he actually plays actually well for more than a few games in a row.  He has yet to do that.
DenverBroncos,37d41l,peteisneat,1 point,Wed May 27 15:33:08 2015 UTC,"I probably agree with you, but man... have you been to a Broncos practice and watched the running backs? Ball looks he's a completely different class of athlete when compared to the other guys. It's hard not to fall in love with his potential, especially after he was so productive in college."

DenverBroncos,37d41l,aatencio91,4,Tue May 26 20:49:38 2015 UTC,"Since he's not the owner of the team, I don't view him the same as them at all."

DenverBroncos,37d41l,caesarfecit,2,Tue May 26 22:49:16 2015 UTC,"Ehhhh, I think Elway is a tough tough negotiator, and he's not afraid to cut good players loose if the dollars just don't add up. Good teams need a GM like that, otherwise you end up waaay overpaying for players who just aren't worth that kind of money.   I think there's a bigger risk of Elway being stingy or too conservative rather than him being a control freak or pulling Al Davis/Jerry Jones/Dan Snyder moves. Every big risk he's taken so far has paid off."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,andrrrew,8,Tue May 26 22:18:12 2015 UTC,"I'm terrified about the offense learning a ""Kubiak/Manning"" style offense to play well together this season and then, once Peyton retires, going to the way Kubiak actually plays his offense. Worried that it's basically learning two different offenses with the same coaching staff because of one player."

I know the Huskers killed the Buffs more often than not, but I'll always remember one game in particular. We were putting up our Christmas tree the day after Thanksgiving, and the Buffs were beating the Huskers in the neighborhood of 40-something to 20-something. The Huskers stormed back and the game got close, and eventually the score was 60-something to 40- or 50-something with the Buffs coming out on top.  Now the Buffs just suck. A lot."

Marshall, Dumervil, DJ Williams, Cox, Miller, Talib, Ward, Prater, Smith etc. Some of them aren't with the team anymore, but Character had nothing to do with the Broncos letting them go. Drafting Shane Ray isn't trying to buck that trend either.  Demaryius Thomas isn't innocent in the Perrish Cox rape incident. DT testified that he knew the girl was passed out, and that Cox said ""I think she's ready"" before carrying her to the room. Thomas knew what was going to happen and should have prevented it. He is complicit in the sexual assault. We should resign Demaryius Thomas at any cost. (this opinion proves I'm a hypocrite considering the first two items on my list.)"

DenverBroncos,37d41l,FoolishTurkey,14,Tue May 26 20:43:34 2015 UTC,John Fox has been notorious for not playing/trusting rookies throughout his coaching career. I think he's more to blame about our rookies lack of production than anyone else.
DenverBroncos,37d41l,bel4sucks,4,Tue May 26 23:06:03 2015 UTC,How the hell could Manning be holding them back? They're being drafted to play in his offense.  I'd argue that he's at least speeding up Ronnie's development.

DenverBroncos,37d41l,NegativeGhostwriter,9,Tue May 26 19:56:13 2015 UTC,"I have a 2000+ word writeup from last year on that season to say otherwise to your first point.  In at least three of those games we played so poorly on offense that without our D going out of it's mind, there would not have been a chance for a Tebow highlight reel comeback."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Mister_Jay_Peg,8,Tue May 26 21:18:22 2015 UTC,"Seriously.  If our D hadn't been so monstrous that playoff year, it's unlikely we would've gone better than 2-14."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,NegativeGhostwriter,12,Tue May 26 23:07:08 2015 UTC,"I'm slowly but surely working on an expanded piece about that season, and I have this roughly worked out these pieces:  1- Mike McCoy almost single-handedly saved the season in the span of 4 days. He used the ""emergency passing Tebow"" playbook against the Dolphins and it worked because the Dolphins were not ready for it. He tried to expand that to a standard pro-offense against the Lions and it bombed because the Lions had tape.  In between that game and the Raiders, he had 4 days of practice time to completely change the gameplan from a pro-style passing attack into a sort of bastardized zone-read option/power rushing attack.  2- Not a single OT game is close without the defense or serious miscues from the other team. @Mia - Mia defense goes full prevent up 15-0 after Tebow goes all of 4-14 40yds in the first 54:30 of the game. He then goes 9/13 121yds 2 TD's. And the second drive only happens because we get a lucky bounce on an onsides. Then in OT we get a strip-sack, the offense gains 2 yards, and Prater boots a 52-yd game winner. @SD - Tebow is shut down rushing, with 22 caries for 57 yards. We are about to lose until a reviewable 37-yard completion to Decker and a 23-yard floater up the sideline to Dante Rosario get us within chipshot range for Prater. Then we either lose or tie with Novak lining up in OT and less than 3min left. We get lucky and he misses, then Willis rips off 25 yards after the 2 minute warning, giving us position for that Prater game winner. vChi - All I will say is we were in it because Chicago shit the bed on both sides of the ball in the 4th. People love to point to Tebow going 21-40 for 237 and a score, but what they don't see first, that's 5.9 Y/A which is horrific, and many of those yards are YAC on short throws (17/29, 155). We got lucky because we played a Bears team that was starting Caleb Hanie and was gifted Barber running out of bounds on the first play after the 2 minute warning with the Bears up 10-7 and the Broncos holding 0 timeouts and then a Barber fumble in OT as they were driving into our territory for the game winner. (Don't forget Prater was the first kicker to ever his a 50+ as time expired followed by a 50+ to win in one game.)  So take those 3, and we are 5-11.   Beyond that, how we beat the Chiefs in Week 10 with him going 2-8 for 69 (with 56 coming on the busted coverage Decker TD) and only rushing 9 times for 43 yards (19 coming on one rush)... Oh wait, it's because our D held KC so much in check they felt like me going against Deep Blue in chess. (How anyone says we won that game BECAUSE of Tebow, I dunno...) So give us an average D in that game, we 're 4-12.  Last, the Jets game isn't won without the Goodman pick-6, or the Jets going full preven-tard on the final drive, spooked out, and allowing Tebow to run behind the LoS for 10-12 seconds twice, and then giving up that absurd TD run to close it. Average defensive game, or no pick-6, we're 3-13.  Funny thing is, I get hammered as a nit-picker for those 5 games, because people think he had the ""it"" factor. Sorry, no. Moxie doesn't win games. Our defense did. Prater did. I will never call Tebow anything other than a glorified gimmick."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Mister_Jay_Peg,3,Wed May 27 00:04:01 2015 UTC,"Damn, flush of memories returning. Good analysis! Tebow certainly did not win those games with skill, his distinct lack of skill is the reason they were close at all. But I do think the excitement and positivity he brought helped enthuse our players around him to a certain degree. The season was what it was due to the defense and Mike McCoy but Tebow's Jekyll and Hyde gameplay definitely gave us the Cinderella factor. I'd say I prefer excitement-less consistency but that's why we lost against Indy this year."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Puffy_Ghost,4,Wed May 27 01:24:05 2015 UTC,"I will never disagree that his attitude and his personality helped the team gel after splitting so hard over the QB change (because remember, Orton had plenty of backers as well). I have issues with people saying ""He could have been a good QB if given a better shot"" or ""Tebow is the reason we even made the playoffs"" or ""He wasn't able to maximize his talent.""  To the first and third, I always point to the three teams he played twice in 2011, KC/SD/NE.  SD only saw him for a half in his first game action, but in their second game, even though we won he was as bad as I described above.   Against KC in Week 17, he was worse than that 2-8 game I pointed to. He was 6-22 for 60 yards and a pick, and only ran 6 times for 16 yards. In a game that was 'win and in' for the playoffs. (GOD we got lucky when SD beat Oak...)  Then in the divisional against NE, everyone saw how ineffective he would be against an elite team. His yardage came almost entirely from DT YAC, he was flustered by the rotating coverage all night, be was harassed behind the line by a disciplined contain-based rushing defense, and he was completely stymied. The defense there is 'he was hurt'. Sorry, that's gonna happen with a guy who can only play in an offense where he can't make a second read, and then runs on almost every passing play."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,cunningcolt,1 point,Wed May 27 01:39:33 2015 UTC,"Prater gets too much credit.  He was 1-3 in that OT game against Miami.  First the missed field goals are used as convenient evidence against Tebow not being able to lead scoring drives, and then when he finally brought his accuracy up to %33 for the day, he gets credit for winning the game.  Nobody should get credit for digging out of a hole that they dug for themselves, whether it's Tebow or Prater."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Wed May 27 15:24:15 2015 UTC,"Before the two big drives to end the game, Tebow's stat line was bad bad bad. I already gave you his passing stats, but he also only ran 9 times for 59 yards (for the game), with 21 coming on a single scamper.  I don't use the 2 missed FG's as proof he couldn't lead scoring drives (although one of those drives was a 6-play 10-yard barn-burner leading to Prater missing from 49).  I use Britton Colquitt's stats for the 11 games Tebow started.  In 11 games he had 8 or 9 punts five times. That is nearly 1/2 of his starts. It took him 37 games under Manning to reach 5 games. That is roughly 1/7th.  And remember how many more drives per game we get under Manning than we did under Tebow. If you with the % of drives ending in a punt for both? Someone is well over 50%. Someone is well under. You can probably guess who is who."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Wed May 27 15:53:46 2015 UTC,"My point is that if Tebow doesn't deserve credit for digging himself out of the hole he dug for himself (and he clearly doesn't), then Prater doesn't either.    I'm sick of people giving Prater credit for the 2011 season when he was tied for 26th in accuracy.  And maybe it's not you, but the Prater apologists use the C-word to dismiss criticism of his wild inconsistency."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,cunningcolt,1 point,Wed May 27 16:20:13 2015 UTC,"I give Prater some credit, because his performance in the clutch has almost nothing to do with how teams defended him during those last few minutes.  If I had to rank, in order, who I personally feel were the most important cogs to those 7 wins under Tebow it would be:  1- Defense 2- Mike McCoy 3- Willis McGahee 4- OLine 5- Prater 6- Tebow"

It baffles me that anyone can believe that since simply winning a game makes that QB good. They can easily fall backwards into a win or have enough around them to win at least one. But I realize plenty hold that since when I was in College some friends and I debated this for a good 2-3 hours."

The guy has his flaws and I agreed with the coaching change, but let's not act like he didn't help oversee our rise back to prominence after the disaster that was McDaniels. You can do a lot worse than John Fox as your HC."

DenverBroncos,37d41l,Formber,1 point,Tue May 26 20:23:34 2015 UTC,"Agreed, but the last 3 years, our team was horrible when we went down by two scores.  We just didn't seem to have any sort of drive.  That was my only problem with Fox.  He just seemed to lose control of the team when we started to lose.  Granted this is some of the teams fault too as some of our players just seemed to quit, but a coach needs to recognize this and find a way to overcome it."

What if he's good, but there's a better option?  What if the Lobster turns out to be an exciting liability like Cutler was?

While I think Elway has shown if there was a clear upgrade available he'll do it without hesitation, if we were sitting in say year three of BrockO with him being okay and occasional flashes of great I wouldn't want personal ties being the reason to ""give him another year or so to develop,"" and without knowing what exactly Elway thinks of Brock the person from a common human perspective I could see that as a possible risk.

Plus, there's so much talent at WR out there now (I know there's the manning effect and he makes average WRs look like pro bowlers).  I'd rather focus on re-signing more of our own rather than load a bunch of money on a couple of players (Von and DT).

Its always the problem with those top5 guys or even the top 10 that as you get higher up their price exponentially increases and there are guys significantly less that do close to the same thing."

That's not saying I want him here now, because I truly despise his coaching style once the team and the locker room are fixed, but he was exactly what this team needed after he who must not be named.  -I also have a small amount of respect for BB, for being the only coach not in the coaches union. I think he's a great coach but a cheater, and lose all but the slightest amount of respect for him because of that, but I do like that he isn't part of the union and the way he coaches and runs the team, minus the cheating."

His wife?/girlfriend?/fiance? came into Target all the time and was a complete psychopath. I'll never forget the time little Rod Jr wanted to buy some seeds and grow vegetables and she slapped the seed packets out of his hands and went on some rant about how they're too rich for that and gardening is something they hire poor people to do for them.  One time she wanted me to double-bag something for her, which is fine, but I hated her so I was like, ""nah, it's fine"" just to set her off. Predictably she went on a tirade, but I wouldn't react to her. I just kept looking past her and saying ""nah, you're good"". She eventually stormed out without a double-bag. I was so happy.

DenverBroncos,37d41l,aljds,0,Wed May 27 02:58:46 2015 UTC,I hate Shanahan.  Edit: Guess you can't even express these thoughts in a topic about them.
DenverBroncos,37d41l,thekingearl,0,Tue May 26 22:44:35 2015 UTC,"Here is mine   While I love Plummer's interaction with the fans, Craig Morton is objectively the better quarterback of the two. Morton is hugely underrated by Broncos fans and should be the consensus third best QB in Broncos history (after Elway and Manning) Shanahan is overrated by Broncos fans everywhere, and will continue to be until another coach wins a Super Bowl. Shanahan was a coach with amazing schemes, but the minute you give him personnel control he fails miserably.  I still would have taken Montee Ball over Eddie Lacy in 2013. Rod Smith, while an amazing player and a Broncos great, doesn't even come close to the Hall of Fame, and while I think TD should be in the Hall because of the ""fame"" part, it also makes sense why he isn't. Heck, TD may not even be the best Broncos RB ever.  Our offensive line is fine. Kubiak and Dennison have shown time and time again they can make Pro Bowlers out of UDFAs and less than average linemen.  Peyton has benefited statistically from the quality of the offensive players around him in his time in Denver. He would have put up great numbers without guys like DT, but not record breaking numbers. We aren't winning the Super Bowl any time soon, unless a miracle happens this year (Peyton pushes father time away and CJ has an amazing year) or in the immediate future (unless Brock is literally Elway 2.0)."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,thekingearl,9,Wed May 27 03:16:07 2015 UTC,"Craig Morton was before my time, so in my eyes Plummer is #3. But I also acknowledge that this has a great deal to do with being a fan favorite. It's funny now how we don't remember/care anymore about him flipping off the crowd - he did get a ridiculous amount of flak considering that he was the best and most successful QB to play in Denver after Elway but before Manning.  I think Shanahan is a flawed coach in the same way Foxy is a flawed coach. They can both do great things, but they also have fatal weaknesses. Foxy doesn't scheme aggressively enough and relies upon athleticism over misdirection (which is why his teams get outcoached and underperform in big games), while Shanahan doesn't have a good eye for players or how to develop them.  I'm not impressed with Montee Ball. Especially compared to CJ, who is a true NFL RB.  Rod Smith was a grinder, that's what makes him great. He's the kind of guy that won't make it to the HoF but pays massive dividends to the fans and the team. I'd take a Rod Smith over a prima donna receiver any day.  Our O-line even last year wasn't that bad in the grand scheme of things. And I expect they'll be even better under Kubiak and Dennison. Maybe not top 5 good, but good enough to get the job done.  Agreed. PFM has been spoiled with riches in his time here. The problem with PFM is he plays like shit when he's hurt and/or flustered. The beauty of Elway (and even that fucker Tom Brady) was his ability to always try again - Manning has trouble shaking off the bad plays.  I'm gonna disagree and say that this year might be our best chance. The defense is spoiled with riches, the offense has a receiver/TE corps to die for (pretty much the only way you could make it better is to get Wes Welker back in his prime, and get Gronk) and we've got an RB I expect great things from. The last three years, the flaw in the plan has always been the coaching. As an MHR contributor said, Foxy was the Kyle Orton of coaches - he wasn't bad, and in some respects underrated, but he couldn't be expected to win games for you."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,thekingearl,2,Tue May 26 19:31:23 2015 UTC,"6.Besides Vazquez and Clady, no one Manning has played with on offense had accomplished anything before he got here, or was an over the hill vet on the downswing of their career.   Knowshon was considered a complete bust, Decker was a nobody, JT was really a nobody, DT was seen as having some potential but still raw, most of the Oline was considered unproven.  Manning made the guys around him better."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,penance25,1 point,Tue May 26 19:45:37 2015 UTC,"No argument at all. The offense before Manning was nothing special, and none of them were playing at the levels they are now. They did have the raw talent to win with Tebow at the helm, but DT just wasn't in the top 5 receiver conversation. Decker getting #1 receiver money was a long shot, and JT went from the 4th or 5th round to getting paid. And Knowshon was a bust until 2013 - I was really bummed about his ACL tear this year, but he'll be back.   We're lucky to have Vazquez and Clady still with us and healthy - they're the kind of guys you can build a solid unit around. I'm curious who our starting center will be."
DenverBroncos,37d41l,penance25,3,Wed May 27 01:12:13 2015 UTC,"TD is far and away the best postseason RB in NFL history, which explains why he should be in the Hall of Fame.  I'm curious who you think is better than Davis on the Broncos.  Only guy who I could see even being remotely close is Floyd Little, and he is from a different era that doesn't compare."

DenverBroncos,37dk37,Neverethe,5,Wed May 27 09:02:39 2015 UTC,I still think Shanahan had no clue how to use Griese. He was so used to having a mobile QB in John Elway that when Griese came here he had no idea that a pocket QB was going to get murdered using the same playbook as he used with Elway.   I put Griese's injury woes squarely on the shoulder of Shanahan and his ignorance. After he got hurt Griese was never the same.
DenverBroncos,37dk37,orthodoxrebel,1 point,Wed May 27 15:29:57 2015 UTC,"A large portion of Shanahan's playbook relied on raw grittiness, a willingness to take hits, because you look at the players who did well in it (Cutler, Plummer, Elway) and you see they weren't spending much time injured. Those in his system that didn't do well spent a lot of time injured. Rolling out of the pocket will do that to you."

He came with media baggage with all the religious stuff, and he broke the first rule of being a quarterback: he couldn't throw the ball.  He's a great guy and I see why so many people like him, but Tebow shouldn't even be in the top five in my opinion.  The majority of his clutch wins should be credited to an often overlooked defense that was kicking much ass despite all the three and outs on the other side of the ball."

DenverBroncos,37dk37,mack2nite,2,Wed May 27 19:58:44 2015 UTC,"But we're talking 3+ years compared to 16?!?  Yeah, Manning ranks above Elway as pure QB - but if we're talking best QB in Denver, I don't see how Elway isn't #1 on that list. Now if Manning wins the next two super-bowls - I think it becomes a different discussion all-together."
DenverBroncos,37dk37,dlevine09,1 point,Wed May 27 20:51:06 2015 UTC,"I think we're all coming at this question from different directions. My approach wasn't what each QB did for the Broncos over their career. Elway would be the obvious winner of that debate. It was more an evaluation of the QB's talent level at their peak in Orange and blue. Manning basically set every meaningful single season record during the 2013 season, so I say he tops Elway in my evaluation."
DenverBroncos,37dk37,God_Man,1 point,Wed May 27 21:06:48 2015 UTC,I see where you're coming from... but isn't the ONLY meaningful single season stat whether you win the SB or not?
DenverBroncos,37doq2,keepshurting,4,Tue May 26 21:39:46 2015 UTC,"Is it the cold you're concerned about? For me at least I love braving the elements during winter games, I'd go lower bowl in the South Stands where it always gets rowdy. As long as you're dressed warm and maybe have a little whiskey in ya then the cold should be no issue. Plus it is Denver we're talking about, it very well could be 70 degrees and sunny for all we know."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,d-lo_tha_boss,4,Tue May 26 23:06:53 2015 UTC,This is the correct answer.
DenverBroncos,37doq2,HansBrixOhNo,1 point,Tue May 26 23:45:36 2015 UTC,"I'm from Alaska so really zero fucks given about the cold. I would love a rowdy crowd, I'm there to party and I am loud during football naturally. I'm used to screaming at my tv though. :) Thanks for your help."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,lsjunior,3,Wed May 27 19:25:17 2015 UTC,"I traveled there 2 years ago for a game against the Titans. When I got on the plane in tampa Florida it was 85 degrees. When I got off in Denver it was 12. I have seen snow before. But not 12 degrees and below. I sat in the club seats. It was nice to be able to go into the heat before the game, during breaks, and halftime. It got to -1 that night. I have never had that many clothes on at one time before. So I would vote club seats but that's only place I have ever sat so."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,aatencio91,2,Wed May 27 01:59:46 2015 UTC,"I watched that game at a bar. Having a few drinks usually leads to having a few smokes, but that day it was just too damn cold.  That was also the day that Matt Prater set the NFL record for longest field goal at 64 yards."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,lsjunior,2,Wed May 27 20:42:16 2015 UTC,Yeah it was. First time to Denver and it was awesome except for the cold.
DenverBroncos,37doq2,ogre13,3,Wed May 27 22:55:26 2015 UTC,"A coworker has season tickets in the North endzone, level 1 in the very last row of his section.  He LOVES THEM for cold, snowy games.  They are well covered by the overhang of the next section (300-level) so they never deal with snow in the seats.  The club section is immediately behind and above him, so sometimes (I'm betting this is pretty rare), he gets beers handed to him.  And, the wall behind him is high enough that you can stand all game if you want and no one behind you will complain."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,ogre13,2,Wed May 27 15:40:55 2015 UTC,"wow. good to know. I wonder if flashing my boobs would per-qualify me for a few beers. :) guess I'll just have to find out! great tip about the standing, I have a hard time sitting all game, or sitting in general for too long. I'll have to check out tickets in those seats. thanks again."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,NegativeGhostwriter,1 point,Wed May 27 19:30:45 2015 UTC,You should probably send me some pictures of your boobs first... so I can properly advise you on their use to acquire said beers.  You know... for scientific reasons only.
DenverBroncos,37doq2,boomsers,2,Wed May 27 19:44:41 2015 UTC,Save that for /r/gonebronco
DenverBroncos,37doq2,boomsers,2,Thu May 28 17:17:00 2015 UTC,"Depends on what you are looking for. Do you want to be as close as possible to the field or have the ability to escape the elements if need be? Do you want to be closer to a more rowdy crowd or a ""calmer"" area? Does a full bar and higher quality food matter to you? Maybe being close to the 50 yard line or end zone is what you prefer?   There is not a bad seat at Mile High, but what area would be best to sit in is a matter of personal preference. All seats are exposed to the weather but if you sit in a high enough row on either the 100 or 300 levels, the seats above you will most likely shield you from rain or snow. Club level will offer a place to go inside to warm up if you need it as well as a lot higher quality food at the stations and occasionally autographs from former players. They also have a full bar (all drinks are the same price there so fireball is the same price as patron). The lower level seats will be closer to the field and have a more active crowd.  Looks like the teams that the Broncos play at home in November are Green Bay, Kansas City, and New England. Two of those are prime time, so expect higher than normal ticket prices as you will most likely be buying the tickets on the secondary market. Good luck with your search and have fun in Denver!"
DenverBroncos,37doq2,kthomaszed,1 point,Wed May 27 03:24:26 2015 UTC,"Wow thanks so much for all that info. I was guessing that I might have to buy secondary tickets. I've been browsing a bit but not sure where the best and most reliable place to purchase is. I'm not too worried about a high class bar or food. I'm guessing I'll eat and drink a little before the game. The game itself is what's most important to me. I want to be able to get a good view. Going inside would be nice, but I'm from Alaska. The elements get us all the time and I'd be damned if I allowed them to deter me from my game."
DenverBroncos,37doq2,melonman456,2,Wed May 27 19:20:56 2015 UTC,It doesn't sound like you need to spend the extra money for club seats. For the price range you are talking about you can probably find something close to the 50 and not too far back.   The two best places for the secondary market are stubhub and nfl ticket exchange. Stubhub guarantees you a seat even if the person selling the tickets doesn't pull through on their end and nfl ticket exchange is all leftover tickets from season ticket holders.

DenverBroncos,37bx0h,yonelway,4,Tue May 26 17:38:58 2015 UTC,"I know PFF isn't the end all, be all, football resource. But they are a pretty quality resource when it comes to individually gauging a player.   The thing I love most is seeing all that green and blue on defense.  And even with the below average players according to PFF, they are switching to a system more suited to their talent. Wolfe and Sly are built more for the 3-4 and that makes me even more excited."
DenverBroncos,37bx0h,dlevine09,4,Tue May 26 14:26:03 2015 UTC,"TIL Dominique Jones is our only TE.   This was posted in February and hasn't been updated. None of our FA signings (or retentions) after that point, or our draft picks are on this list."

DenverBroncos,373djm,mkmecon29,2,Sun May 24 17:43:46 2015 UTC,I'd actually do Welker at LT because you can shift Green over to that side to double team and have a RB to help. But you're screwed either way. Peyton at safety might as well be no safety at all. Hope that Shane Ray and McCray do work in his a absence. We actually could still get along alright but having a elite edge rusher does wonders for the defense. I live in AZ so I'd probably become a Cardinals fan and would have no memory of what I'm missing out on.   Edit: just saw that 2. was pertaining to vonbot. We'd hopefully get to have a raybot but he has to put up the highlights first. If not a CHJbot would be awesome.
DenverBroncos,373djm,Sienna_Crush,2,Sun May 24 15:34:31 2015 UTC,"Peyton at FS would be dope No more von bot, so I become an alcoholic If it is they no longer exist, probably the Packers, but if it is they never existed, probably the Raiders (fuck them btw)"

DenverBroncos,371fzx,ThreezusManning,16,Sun May 24 00:27:27 2015 UTC,"Roby was such a steal at pick 31. Made few mistakes as a rookie, and he gets to learn from CHJ and Talib. Can't wait to see what he does this season!"
DenverBroncos,371fzx,crueg,1 point,Sat May 23 23:51:04 2015 UTC,"He definitely held his own for the most part as a rookie. Not only does he have 3 secondary pro bowlers to help improve his play, but hopefully our new defensive scheme will create pressure on QBs and force throws into our DBs' hands. That's something I believe we lacked on the field; Qb pressure."
DenverBroncos,371fzx,skullyD,11,Sun May 24 18:23:43 2015 UTC,"His first big play of his career on Reggie Wayne near the end of the game that basically sealed the win was a thing of beauty. That's when I knew he was a steal.  On another note, I think this pick implicates that's Talib will be cut in the next couple of years. Give Roby another year or two to flourish and grow, I can see Elway easily cutting Talib from his huge contract.  No discredit to Talib of course, he's a great player."
DenverBroncos,371fzx,mysterious_pube,5,Sun May 24 03:31:47 2015 UTC,"I'm pretty sure cutting Talib was in mind before the pick. He's pretty easy to cut after 2015, and his biggest cap hits are in 2017 and 2018, with only 2 mil and 1 mil in dead money."
DenverBroncos,371fzx,skullyD,2,Sun May 24 04:24:45 2015 UTC,"Damn, didn't realize the details of his contract were like that. Thanks for the info."

DenverBroncos,372abk,crueg,7,Sun May 24 06:23:06 2015 UTC,More like Von Master of Sacks
DenverBroncos,372abk,von_bot,1 point,Sun May 24 06:23:46 2015 UTC,"Under the franchise tag, the team can't negotiate with DT after July 1 until the season ends.  That means the team will have the entire season to evaluate the WRs, which depending on the progress of that group (namely Sanders and Latimer), this could influence what happens with DT.  I'm not saying I think the team will let DT walk, Its just not a lock that he's in Denver after this year."
DenverBroncos,372abk,PMeist,10,Sun May 24 06:27:35 2015 UTC,"The Broncos are desperately trying to get a deal done with DT. While I personally value Dez more due to his attitude as a WR the production has been equal to or better for DT. DT doesn't want to get underpaid and I understand that. But DT will probably want out without PFM around.   I don't see the Broncos management wanting DT out at all. Sanders and Latimer are good talents but neither are DT. There are actually only a few 'elite' WR's in the NFL that consistently put up the numbers and DT is one of them. I definitely could see DT being re-franchise tagged next year which would cost even more money. We don't want to let him go, but it might come down to a 'have-to', in which case I could see us trying to trade him away."
DenverBroncos,372abk,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Sun May 24 06:10:41 2015 UTC,"We agree on a lot of points here, and I want DT in orange and blue until he retires.  I didn't mean to say that I think the front office doesn't want DT, I just think there are a variety of factors, that could end in a scenario where DT moves on.  Moving to Kubiak's offense will guarantee a more run based approach, and less 3 and 4 WR sets.  No question this offense is going to be better with Thomas in it, but (depending on how the rest of the WRs progress) if the dropoff from the WR position with and without Thomas is smaller than substantial, its within the realm of the possibility that the front office lets DT walk and uses that money for a playmaker at another position."
DenverBroncos,372abk,MasonL52,2,Sun May 24 06:23:20 2015 UTC,DT is on a hall of fame track right now. You don't let guys like that leave.

DenverBroncos,372abk,Mack1993,1 point,Sun May 24 15:48:10 2015 UTC,"AFIK a player can't be franchised 2 years in a row. Dez' attitude is basically the only reason I value DT more. Bryant throws fits and is a sideline distraction. Besides those points, I think you're right about Denver wanting to keep DT around. It seems like they're being responsible and are not going to just shovel cash at him, which makes me happy. I don't see the wisdom of paying a WR more than 10% of the team's total cap number. My expectation is that Thomas will be somewhere else in 2016 as long as Latimer shows any promise at all."
DenverBroncos,372abk,mack2nite,1 point,Tue May 26 14:23:34 2015 UTC,You can definitely franchise the same player as many years in a row as you want.  Only thing is is that the price goes way up each time you do.
DenverBroncos,372abk,PMeist,0,Wed May 27 07:18:55 2015 UTC,I stand corrected. This is surprising since I don't remember anyone ever being franchised 2 years in a row.
DenverBroncos,372abk,mack2nite,-2,Wed May 27 13:48:31 2015 UTC,"The thing that makes Bryant better than DT is his attitude. A lot of times his 'fits' are blown out of proportion by the media.   Bryant's toughness and tenacity to get after the ball is far greater than DT's. And this coming from a fan who loves DT and his skill set. But just the eye test will tell you that Dez is a meaner, tougher, more physical, fighter WR than DT. That's why I value Dez more.   And let's hope that DT can stay.. =/"
DenverBroncos,372abk,Dbash56,2,Tue May 26 14:28:20 2015 UTC,"Dez is definitely mean and intense, so much so that Jerry Jones had to get him an off-field nanny. He walked off the field in 2013 and almost came to blows with Witten before Ware stepped in and broke it off. I see some value in being fired up, but I just think it's a distraction at that level. DT has showed some heart too. Many people forget that he was a big reason why Tebow has a playoff win under his belt. DT was also one of very few players to show up for SB 48. He's got heart, but he's not a loud mouth. He also is suffering some self inflicted criticism for being one of the guys who decided not to even try against the Colts last game."

DenverBroncos,372abk,mysterious_pube,2,Sun May 24 18:26:20 2015 UTC,The patriots are a big passing team and they just won the super so i think that makes this point moot
DenverBroncos,372abk,mr_potroast,2,Sun May 24 20:54:12 2015 UTC,"I'm in the minority, but I don't see the loss of DT as huge, so long as Latimer turns into a good (doesn't need to be great) player. Everyone loves big time receivers, but their contracts do more harm than good. They don't have the impact their numbers would suggest. Whenever you pay big money to a player, you sacrifice depth and talent in other areas, which means that player must be capable of making up for the loss of depth and talent elsewhere on the team, and receivers can't do that.  I'd love for DT to stay, but not at 15+ mil a year. Receivers aren't worth that kind of money."
DenverBroncos,372abk,reddit2therescue,1 point,Sun May 24 17:24:09 2015 UTC,Is it possible DT gets tagged again? Or with all of those other top WR will the tag cost too much?
DenverBroncos,372abk,Sienna_Crush,3,Sun May 24 10:56:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, but the players salary will increase by 120%, third year 144%."
DenverBroncos,372abk,ktsmyth,1 point,Sun May 24 14:08:01 2015 UTC,It would be nice to keep him but at the same time I could see it hurting us more in the end to sign him to a huge top 5 receiver contract. We have a lot of defensive players to lock up in the future. It also will depend on if Peyton plays in 2016. If he does it may be good by to DT. Having Latimer step up would make it a much easier decision because we still would have 2 good receivers and it would be a lot cheaper to draft another receiving weapon or sign a decent free agent than fork out 13-15 million a year for DT. I love him and hope he stays but this could be his last year with us.

DenverBroncos,3717cv,locriology,12,Tue May 26 16:59:28 2015 UTC,Clady is a good one  I'm gonna throw out there Danny Trevathan as a nominee. Guy was great in 2013 but was riddled with injuries in 2014.
DenverBroncos,3717cv,BlindManBaldwin,5,Sat May 23 22:44:01 2015 UTC,"I hope it's Clady. When Clady plays well, the rest of the oline plays well. I hope he can come back from that foot injury."

DenverBroncos,3717cv,SuburbanHell,9,Sat May 23 22:54:27 2015 UTC,My vote will be for montee. He'll get some snaps to give CJ a break and prove he can handle a split roll or maybe take over. Either way those two are monsters and i love to have them.

He comes in and plays FS and does it at a pro bowl level. We win the superbowl. Manning and Champ ride off into the sunset. A man can dream.

DenverBroncos,3717cv,PMeist,3,Sun May 24 03:00:36 2015 UTC,I'm gonna go in a completely different direction: Derek Wolfe. After the craziness of two years ago with his seizures it seems as though he's finally really back. Plus he is made as a 3-4 DE. So my vote is him for sure  Danny is a great pick as well
DenverBroncos,3717cv,kgxv,1 point,Sun May 24 17:54:16 2015 UTC,"Nice sleeper pick, he was a great pass rusher his rookie year and got 6 sacks I believe?  I think the 3-4 benefits this team greatly."
DenverBroncos,3717cv,von_bot,2,Sun May 24 18:48:09 2015 UTC,"I agree it could be Clady or Trevathan.   But I'll throw out a nomination for Montee Ball. Dude looked like an amazing talent out of college, had an average rookie year behind Moreno's spectacular 2013 campaign. Then was the most punished RB behind our horrible run blocking disaster last year. Then was injured and played injured and eventually they overcame him, only to lose his job to CJ.   I LOVE CJ and he's one of my favorite Broncos. But could you imagine a 50/50 split between CJ and Montee if they both go off and perform at a very high standard. That would be like the best running back duo in the NFL. Huge potential for us at RB."

One girl right in front of me talked the whole game in an annoying voice until finally one Eagles fan told her to shut up and made a comment about how she probably couldn't name a single player on the Seahawks. She struggled but remembered she was wearing a Sherman jersey and proceeded to try to read it by turning around. She looked like a dog chasing its tail.

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,zbeg,2,Sat May 23 20:43:14 2015 UTC,Whats the context of this? I can't remember
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,vearson26,13,Mon May 25 03:09:13 2015 UTC,Which is why there were very few prouder moments than when Manning threw the 2 pt. conversion to DT with Sherman on him to send the game into OT. Sherman ain't got shit.

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,the_real_darkrock,25,Sat May 23 23:19:57 2015 UTC,Eddie Kennison.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Brico16,19,Sat May 23 15:47:10 2015 UTC,"For those who don't remember or aren't old enough, Kennison was a starting WR for the Broncos who, the day before a game against the Chargers, told coach Shanahan his heart wasn't in the game and he was retiring. So the Broncos released him.  Then two weeks later he ""unretired"" and signed with the Chiefs. Broncos linebacker John Mobley was pretty vocal about it.  *""I just think that was a cowardly thing to do,"" Mobley said of Kennison's decision. ""If he'd come to us prior to [quitting], it would have been a lot easier for everybody to handle.""  Mobley also suggested Kennison wouldn't play Sunday.  ""I don't think he'll suit up against us because I know him,"" Mobley said. ""He won't want to get out there and play against us--not our defense.  ""He'll find an excuse now or later in the week. We don't think Eddie's going to play. We know Eddie's mentality.""  Mobley even called Kennison ""Benedict Arnold"" and suggested the Broncos might be looking for some retribution on the field, a revelation the NFL took seriously enough to warn Mobley and the Broncos that they would be watched closely. *  Fuck Eddie Kennison. Gutless traitor."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,taotechill,18,Sat May 23 18:21:53 2015 UTC,I fucking loved John Mobley so much
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,AlpineSummit,3,Sat May 23 18:23:58 2015 UTC,"Had he not been hurt, people would be talking about him like they do Ray Lewis (on field accomplishments only, Mobley was a class act off the field too)."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Sun May 24 14:22:47 2015 UTC,Mobley is one of the reasons I'm a broncos fan.   Yeah that was because I had 15 sacks every game with him on madden 99 but still. That love translated to the real game :)
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,AlpineSummit,6,Tue May 26 07:21:00 2015 UTC,What he did to us was before I started watching football. I just looked up why he's so high on this list for some people. I get it now. Fuck that guy.

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Ravanas,15,Sat May 23 22:59:21 2015 UTC,Shawn fucking Merriman. You know why. You all know why.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Mister_Jay_Peg,8,Sat May 23 14:15:38 2015 UTC,I can't remember why after his career went down the toilet.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,epgenius,2,Sat May 23 14:35:33 2015 UTC,If you were a fan during his prime I don't see how you can forget. He was a fucking terror. It may be cold but I'm glad his career is over.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,jabraunlin,3,Sat May 23 19:09:30 2015 UTC,"Until now, it was any Bolt not named LT during there ""glory"" days. All I heard was how great Merrimen, Rivers, Gates, Castillo, etc.  Now it is Justin Houston. I work with some K.C. fans that are so blind, they can't even see how mediocre their team is. They don't just think the Chiefs have a chance, they think it's almost a forgone conclusion that K.C. will win the AFCW. And that Houston will kill Peyton."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,AlpineSummit,11,Sat May 23 15:25:39 2015 UTC,Chiefs fans are delusional. I think that Raiders fans at least truly understand that they're no good at this point. The Chiefs latch onto a tiny bit of success and take it to a whole different level. Similar to Cowboys fans.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,fliptrikster,8,Sat May 23 15:27:54 2015 UTC,Either Brady or some players who were on that 05-11 Steeler team.

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,BlindManBaldwin,10,Sat May 23 22:13:24 2015 UTC,Russell Wilson!   The fact that everyone loves him makes me hate him even more.  I don't think I will ever get over my hatred of the Seahawks after these past few years.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,coronad0,5,Sat May 23 17:12:01 2015 UTC,I used to feel that way until I came to terms with how awful we played against them. We just didn't show up and even give them a competition.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,fantasygod777,3,Sat May 23 18:14:26 2015 UTC,"You are misguided brother! Seahawks and Seahawks fans are aweful yes, and they kicked our ass in the SB, but the hatred for other teams/QBs like the Patriots/Brady and Raiders runs sooo much deeper..

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,corybyu,2,Sat May 23 18:21:24 2015 UTC,That asshat James Harrison. Ever since he stomped on that AZ player in the Super Bowl. He's a dirty stupid piece of shit and now he's ruined The Steelers for me (don't care that much but still)
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,fliptrikster,2,Sat May 23 19:04:42 2015 UTC,"Raiders, always Raiders. To the bone, Raiders. There are others I dislike, but watching the Raiders lose is almost as good as watching the Broncos win. The only piece of NFL gear I own that isn't Broncos is a Buccaneers t-shirt I bought for a Super Bowl 37 game against the Raiders. The hatred is in the blood, it will never be expunged."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,MTLBroncos,7,Sat May 23 21:45:12 2015 UTC,"Jay Cutler. I was so happy when he was gone, one of the few McDaniels decisions I supported.  What a shitty leader. Every time he pouted on the sidelines by himself I wanted to punch him."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,fliptrikster,7,Sun May 24 05:18:20 2015 UTC,"I %100 agree.. replacing The Snake, are you serious!? and only to move onto Orton... bad to worse, man the late 2000's were rough."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,taratorial,-15,Sat May 23 15:22:36 2015 UTC,"what about when Manning pouts on the sidelines? They have the exact same mannerisms. Either sad, or bitching at their teammates."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Greeney494,5,Sat May 23 19:23:54 2015 UTC,At least Peyton stays classy in press conferences and is an all around better quarterback than Cutler.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,aatencio91,-5,Sat May 23 18:15:23 2015 UTC,"Of course he's a better qb, but that's not what I was talking about. There's no way it's good for the team to see your leader and quarterback sulking by himself or reaming out others for stuff that's partially his fault."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,taratorial,2,Sat May 23 21:07:02 2015 UTC,"I can agree that I've seen Peyton have a pouting face on the sideline, but I would never question his leadership. He carried the Colts on his back for so long, and he's done so since he's gotten to Denver with much success. We win a Super Bowl once he doesn't HAVE to carry the team though. Hopefully that's this year."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Saint3Dx,-3,Sat May 23 21:11:23 2015 UTC,"It's not about carrying the team. We're plenty talented that we don't need Peyton to carry us on his back. I'm talking purely from a morale standpoint, it would be great for the guys to be able to look up when the team is in a shitty situation and see Manning firing everyone up and just acting like a competitor. Half the time he acts defeated and it's just so uninspiring to see."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,SkullCollector,2,Sat May 23 21:15:57 2015 UTC,I hear you. I get it. Don't fully agree because I feel like he's inspiring just being who he is. He gives everyone hope by just being on the team. But I've seen that frown face plenty of times. His inspiration is on the field. Remember his face when we were down 24-0 to San Diego? Remember how he rallied the team on the field starting with the first drive of the third quarter?
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,SuperBroMan,-2,Sat May 23 21:18:28 2015 UTC,"yeah I remember that, and I can remember about 10 other times where he was moping and we did absolutely nothing to come back. It's not all his fault, the team needs to be able to motivate themselves too. Fox was terrible for that, hopefully Kubes can instill that fire into our guys"
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,SkullCollector,0,Sat May 23 21:29:13 2015 UTC,"From what I understand, Gary Kubiak is quietly a very inspirational person. Fox was boring. I think Kubiak is going to do great things in Denver... again."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,SuperBroMan,6,Sat May 23 21:37:27 2015 UTC,"You are not good at reading people.  Manning gets frustrated with lack of excellence because he puts a ton of effort into everything he does.  He gets frustrated with himself when he makes mistakes and at others when they don't perform their roles.  Cutler is a whiny waste of potential who has never put in the work required to be great.  He has all the physical tools to be one of the best of all time, but doesn't have the work ethic or ability to lead that Peyton has.  I honestly can't believe how you could think they have the same mannerisms."

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,crueg,-4,Sun May 24 02:12:06 2015 UTC,"not hating, it's an indisputably true observation"
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,moeshapoppins,6,Sat May 23 19:19:59 2015 UTC,"Manning gets frustrated/disappointed same as any QB, but never to the level of tantrums Culter displays.."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,iseedoug,4,Sat May 23 19:58:43 2015 UTC,"Since Rivers was already mentioned, I'm gonna go with Jay ""Derpface"" Cutler. Because he threw a bitchfit and demanded to be traded because McDaniels was doing his due diligence as a new coach.  Diva."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,testreker,-1,Sat May 23 22:33:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah, we definitely got the better end of the bargain with McDaniels that year, while the Bears went to the NFC championship..."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,AdaAstra,5,Sat May 23 15:25:03 2015 UTC,"Of course, then we ended up with a future HOFer breaking every passing record there is and leading us to a Super Bowl..."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Greeney494,2,Sat May 23 16:29:59 2015 UTC,"The question was who we hate. I know Cutler is not a horrible player, but his sourpuss attitude overshadows his accomplishments. He has a ""my way or the highway"" attitude, pouts, points fingers, and is generally a whiney player. I'm glad he's gone and I will always take joy in watching him throw temper tantrums."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,AdaAstra,4,Sat May 23 16:44:18 2015 UTC,Suh. Idk why that piece of shit is still in the league.

DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Royusmaximus,11,Sun May 24 21:10:55 2015 UTC,Sure hope you mean the people who were all over Tebow's jockstrap and not those who were Tebow fans because he was the starting QB at one point. I was a Tebow fan when he was the starter. But I also understood how flawed his game was and wasn't upset when we sent him away.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,jabraunlin,14,Sat May 23 15:14:52 2015 UTC,"People can hate on Tebow all they want, you can't deny that guy made games more interesting than they should have been.  No way in hell I would take Tebow over Manning and I completely understand why we had to get him off the team that same season."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,Doomy22,7,Sat May 23 15:25:04 2015 UTC,"Tebow made the last five minutes more interesting than they should. Throwing 6-22 passing with one first down and no points in the first 55 minutes, is not making games more interesting."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,doublin23,2,Sat May 23 15:50:13 2015 UTC,Better a close game than a blowout. We never really were a team until recently to hand out the blowouts. Usually we got beat bad.
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,kgxv,0,Sat May 23 16:27:09 2015 UTC,"Buffalo, Detroit, New England weren't the closest of games...."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,PlansBandC,4,Sat May 23 16:51:09 2015 UTC,"And we were not very good then either.  We relied almost exclusively on our defense to get us into the game.  When we didn't, we got blown out.  Tebow just had the benefit of being on our team when we actually had a shot and he somehow kept us in the game.   Could someone else done the same? Sure.  But really didn't have alot of options then either.  I think you are getting the impression that I preferred Tebow.  I did not and thought it was a bad decision to put him in.  However, I can't deny that I hadn't seen Bronco fans cheer that much until after we got Manning.  When the Raiders were terrible, we should have dominated the league, but we still somehow managed to keep the Chargers and/or the Chiefs relevant.   Tebow gave our team a spark I had not seen a long time in the fans."
DenverBroncos,36zmk8,spankweasel,2,Sat May 23 21:03:38 2015 UTC,"I'm not saying you're a Tebowmaniac, but really, Kyle Orton had the same type of experience a year and half before, that season just ended on a sour note and people forgot the way we started 6-0 beating the Patriots, Cowboys, the tip drill in Cincinnati.  I'll never take the playoff win against the Steelers away because that was just a historic and memorable game, but to say the fans had been longing for a spark is something I don't agree with completely. They were done being a 4-12 team and having the second pick in the draft, but that had happened for one year and 5 games. Something happened in 2011 that was different, but if Marion Barber stays inbounds, we lose our last four games and don't make it to the playoffs.  But you're entitled to your thoughts, and I won't take that away from you, I just hastily offered my Tebow experience. I paid to sit through the Bears and Chiefs game that year, and both instances I remember saying out loud, ""I can't believe I spent $300 on this."" No fan should ever have to say that at their teams games."

DenverBroncos,36wto2,The_American_Viking,-24,Sat May 23 03:20:36 2015 UTC,"Because if Tim Tebow taught us anything, it's that muscularity is a key to quarterback play."
DenverBroncos,36wto2,NegativeGhostwriter,22,Fri May 22 20:38:26 2015 UTC,"Its not. But when that is considered one of your only weaknesses, and you're improving it, it means something."
DenverBroncos,36wto2,doughboi8813,-10,Fri May 22 20:59:57 2015 UTC,"One of Peyton's weaknesses was the bench press?  Yes, I get that people think he had a problem with his range, but I think that's an issue of perception rather than ability.  He's at least above-average in deep passing accuracy, though it's not his fort.  The only exception was toward the end of last year, but his problem wasn't lack of strength so much as having both legs injured.  And ultimately, I'm sure the goal is to prevent further injuries, rather than to extend range.  The only problem I see is that any additional upper-body bulk could interfere with Peyton's throwing motion.    When Von Miller bulked up, he became less effective, since agility is a major part of what makes him a special player.  Even though Peyton's deep passing is more than adequate, it's never been what makes him a special player."

DenverBroncos,36wto2,RedRiderJman,0,Sun May 31 07:11:25 2015 UTC,"Given that people are commenting on Peyton's upper body appearing bigger,  why do you think there is no chance that the added bulk could interfere with his mechanics?   He's had essentially the same body for his  entire career, but now he's changing it.     I think the reduced chance of injury will probably be a net benefit,  but to  blindly assume that there could be no repercussions to added muscle mass seems, we'll, not very bright to me."

And over the next few months, she found us a place to live, we moved a few car loads of stuff out, things like that.  I was going to move around mid school year, at the semester mark.  We hauled most of our stuff out a couple weeks beforehand in a u-Haul, and I was going to finish out the semester and then fly out to Nevada.    Well, the schedule worked out such that I had to fly out of DIA on Super Bowl Sunday, January 28, 1998.  Worse yet, my flight was scheduled to leave at halftime!  I wasn't going to be able to watch my Broncos play in the Super Bowl?!?!  Luckily, my dad understood, and he put me on a waiting list to catch an earlier flight.  Which I thankfully was able to board.  It was still a near thing though.  I walked into the new house, dumped my stuff in my room, and turned on the big screen TV, just as the Broncos took the field for opening kick off.  That day was so full of raw anxiousness, but I didn't miss a second of one of the greatest Super Bowls of all time.  I'll never forget how I wished my mother would drive just a little bit faster, the Mile High Salutes and John's helicopter, or the unbridled joy of actually being able to cheer my beloved team to their first championship, even if I did have to do it from 1,000 miles away."

DenverBroncos,36ulll,penance25,2,Fri May 22 14:32:07 2015 UTC,"This team at this point has a very high ceiling and very low floor, and it greatly depends on the health of Manning and the defense's adjustment to Wade. I hate our offensive line...hate it...But I trust Kubiak and Manning can overclock their performance if Manning stays healthy and comes back strong. The defense is an enigma. At no point last year did I feel like they were the top defense, yet PFF ranks them there. They are somewhere in between my intense scrutiny and PFF's results. Many people are putting the difference at Wade's much more aggressive style than Del Rio. Could that be the catalyst to opening up the turnovers that have been generally absent in Denver over the good part of two decades? Maybe. Hopefully. If Wade can get the defense to make more plays and the offense can maintain an advantage with Manning, the sky is the limit, but I find there are quite a few questions at this point in the offseason that I find it difficult to guarantee victories against the Packers, Patriots, Colts, and an improving division. Right now? 12-4, maybe 11-5. But 14-2 or 8-8 wouldn't surprise me if certain circumstances come to fruition."
DenverBroncos,36ulll,__KODY__,2,Fri May 22 15:49:08 2015 UTC,"Elway went out last year and brought in guys that he thought could help turn our defense into something resembling Seattle's, but Del Rio couldn't get them there, or refused to.  I think Wade will be able to light a fire under guys that already want to play tough, physical defense.  I can't wait to see our defense this season. I hope I'm right."
DenverBroncos,36ulll,penance25,3,Fri May 22 18:25:43 2015 UTC,"So many of the players on our defense play with a chip on their shoulder,  or talk like they do. I love Harris, Jackson, Marshall, and Trevathan attitude-wise, but there are health concerns with both of those linebackers, and it's weird that they didn't seem to reach their max potential under Del Rio as I respect his defensive mind. Everybody brings up the relatively low blitzing the Broncos do, and I wonder if that low percentage forced higher play on Miller and Ware that really wore them out. Every time we blitzed Ward it seemed to go well. You can't do that every time, but a more aggressive style should fit this defense better, especially considering that we have a great 1-on-1 secondary. The old saying is true, ""you can only cover a guy so long."" With this secondary and pass rush, we should be able to blitz more often and cause more turnovers."

DenverBroncos,36sour,Greeney494,14,Fri May 22 01:10:52 2015 UTC,And the New England Patriots scored -31.2 on offense?  These are some pretty sketchy numbers
DenverBroncos,36sour,locriology,2,Thu May 21 21:58:13 2015 UTC,Most of that is due to their atrocious O-Line play in the beginning of the year.
DenverBroncos,36sour,PaulTheOctopus,1 point,Thu May 21 22:18:42 2015 UTC,Just because there's a reason behind it doesn't mean that reasons solid.

DenverBroncos,36sour,NiceSasquatch,1 point,Thu May 21 21:09:21 2015 UTC,"agree.    pff had us not only best, but far and away the best. The D was good, but #1 in the nfl."
DenverBroncos,36sour,BoltingUpSince91,5,Thu May 21 21:08:56 2015 UTC,"I guess a good way to put it could be that on average, the Broncos have the best individual players at any given defensive position, but it isn't the best defensive unit as a whole"
DenverBroncos,36sour,NiceSasquatch,3,Thu May 21 22:14:05 2015 UTC,"that doesn't really jive with what PFF claims to do.    Positive plays are positive plays and that means the defense as a whole was successful on that play,  far more-so than the defense as a whole was unsuccessful.  This result goes to show how subjective and uncalibrated PFF ratings can be."

The players grew so much under him but it was definitely time to turn to someone who can harness that talent into a cohesive unit. I think that's why PFF rates us so high vs. traditional stats since PFF is about individual performance where traditional defensive stats mostly focus on the team as a whole. I'll always like JDR and value what he did for the franchise and wish him luck in the future (just not with the Raiders.)"

Even if we aren't the best team in the league, I want to be a respectable franchise.  It worries me though to see so many people urging to cut him (mostly in /r/NFL) before any verdict has been made though. I mean these days anyone can make an allegation and smear someone's name. In many countries around the world they blur out handcuffs on those under arrest so as to not imply guilt since they are innocent until proven otherwise.

I really like the lack of bravado from CHJ, but I'd like to see him get the respect he deserves... just like Champ.  Even if the fans don't acknowledge it, you know the players do.  In Champ's heyday, QBs knew that you do not throw to where ever Champ is on the field... you'll get burned.  I want to see CHJ have that same reputation and I'm excited about it."

DenverBroncos,36o35y,BroncosChurroWay,6,Wed May 20 20:10:57 2015 UTC,I would say dope for sure. Kubiak is a OL whisperer. He'll put a great O-line on the field.
DenverBroncos,36o35y,shindigg15,3,Wed May 20 22:40:15 2015 UTC,"+1 for this. I've been super nervous about our O-line, but Kubs knows what the fuck he's doing in that department. We had the best line ever when we won two in a row thanks to him. in '97 only one lineman was drafted above the 7th round (granted there were 13 rounds back then but still.)"
DenverBroncos,36o35y,theatretech37,10,Thu May 21 02:31:31 2015 UTC,"There's no telling. We have like 3 new starters on the line this year with LG, C,  and RT. We lost a really good lineman in Orlando Franklin, Shipped ManRam to Detroit, and signed/traded/drafted new o-linemen.   I think our new line will look like this:  Clady - Shelley - Gradkowski - Vasquez - Sambrailo/Clark (Still don't know who this will be, I think it'll be Sambrailo but I can see them starting Clark)  Elway and Kubiak believe in the o-line we have currently I would presume. I trust that Kubiak and Dennison can make something out of this group like they always seem to do.   Still confused on the Gradkowski trade..... But I'm no GM."
DenverBroncos,36o35y,skullyD,10,Wed May 20 20:22:19 2015 UTC,"I hope Garcia gets the start over him, a line of Clady/Shelley/Garcia/Vas/Samb sounds like it'd be good, at least from a speculation stand point"

Wouldn't Kubiak know if he sucked? That's why I don't buy that he's as bad as the Ravens subreddit says he is."
DenverBroncos,36o35y,Greeney494,1 point,Thu May 21 01:04:36 2015 UTC,"I'm not really confused on why we got him, considering the Kubiak connection and possible starting job.  More confused on why we traded a 4th rounder for him, considering how much is known about how badly he played I feel we could've snagged him for a 6th/5th rounder.   But who knows. I don't see why we would give up so much for him if we didn't expect him to start. I think we start him and sit Garcia probably, unless Garcia just flourishes in camp or something.

Some spots were sketch. But dont move the one all pro to a spot that hes never played before. Most lines have 3 solid guys and 2 that are little behind. They should have left the guys who were great stay were they were . Orlando should have never moved inside and they should have never made Vasquez play tackle. I think thats what really fucked them last year. Instead of 3 studs and couple so so guys. They turned that line into one stud and the others seemed lost.

DenverBroncos,36n18t,skullyD,18,Thu May 21 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"There was a story, more like a rumor, floating around a while ago about JDR and Elway about to get in a physical altercation in the locker room (I think it was after we blew that huge lead on the patriots a year ago), here's what I read a while ago.   Recently a story came across my desk and I was very hesitant to publish it but now that I have confirmed with key sources I can. Jack Del Rio came very close to beating up John Elway..Yes that's right Del Rio was going to smash up Elways face. Why? Because Elway was upset Del Rio did not beat The Patriots and Elway did like that Del Rio was ""pushing the guys too hard"" John Elway is never talked about in a bad way but I can assure you this guy  has a ego like many have never seen before. One afternoon in the locker room Elway came in confronted Del Rio for various reasons in front of some players (about 3) and coaching staff and ""Elways back up guys"" Elway started to yell in Del Rio's face but Elway did not know what he was getting himself into. Del Rio charged Elway and grabbed him by the throat and then Elways guys quickly separated the two but from what I hear Del Rio was man handling Elway.. Del Rio thought it was disrespectful to come at him and start telling him how he should coach and berate him in front of people like ""he was a 10 year old boy"" Elway threaten to fire Del Rio when the two were arguing and the low blow came when Elway said ""This is Not Jacksonville, This is Denver I don't accept this kind of play"" The two were quickly separated but sources tell me if it lasted 2 more seconds Elway would of been crying in the corner begging for forgiveness (Lol okay).To Elways credit though he did apologize to Del Rio but ever since that little scuffle the 2 basically hated each other and I can also confirm Elway did send Del Rio some sort of text saying along the lines of ""have fun in Oakland, can't wait to beat you twice a year""......This story has been around for awhile yet never really told, I do know guys like Greg Papa know about it..So to Raider Nation when Del Rio's Oakland Raiders line up against The Broncos in 2015 remember it was always a rivalry but now..It's personal   Source: http://theraidersdaily.sportsblog.com/posts/1768331/john_elway_vs_jack_del_rio.html  Note that this is from a raiders website, so if course there is bias to make Elway look like a pansy and Del Rio look like a god. Take it for what you will. Something happened I'm sure, Del Rio was on his way out a while ago."

DenverBroncos,36n18t,skullyD,20,Wed May 20 19:17:06 2015 UTC,"Yeah, well that drama was nothing compared to what happened in Oakland last year.   Darren McFadden walked in on Mark Davis and Derek Carr finger blasting each other's bungholes in the showers with several (5 or so) raiderettes watching. My sources tell me that Derek was squealing ""call me David, call me David you dirty dirty boy"" while stroking Mark's silky bowl-cut hair with his free hand. It was so awkward that McFadden couldn't look his own QB in the brown eye each snap anymore and had to leave for Dallas.   Sauce? Me on /r/denverbroncos"

I've never been terribly impressed with Jack Del Rio, and that second half against the Patriots was downright humiliating, especially after manhandling them in the first half. But on the other hand, Jack Del Rio was probably taking flak for a lot of shit that's ultimately Foxy's fault, and it was against Darth Hoodie in horrible conditions.  Not to mention it's bad karma to start tearing strips off a coach in front of the players - I remember Al Pacino's character in Any Given Sunday flipping shit too when Cameron Diaz's character pulled that.   TL;DR: JDR mostly deserved to get chewed out over that game and I don't blame Elway 1% for being furious. But I also don't blame JDR for losing his cool either."

DenverBroncos,36nxgi,baha24,15,Wed May 20 19:32:52 2015 UTC,"I will be absolutely pissed if the Raiders left. I know they haven't been competitive the past decade or so, but there's wayyyyyyy too much history and bad blood there for them to leave.  Historically, when they were good, we used to (and still do) have one of the biggest rivalries in the NFL.   The Chiefs will stay.  San Diego is the odd one out IMO. I think we do a switcheroo with the NFCW and we get either the Seahawks or the Cardinals in place of the Chargers. I don't think it'll be the Rams considering how close in proximity they are to the Chiefs, but who knows.  I think it'll be the Seahawks, of course since they used to be in the AFCW."
DenverBroncos,36nxgi,skullyD,5,Wed May 20 20:07:52 2015 UTC,"San Diego is the odd one out IMO.   Exactly, which is why I would like to see them leave, regardless of how close the games have been these past couple of years. If the Raiders can actually be a decent team again (I think moving away from Oakland is a massive step in the right direction) and the old rivalries are revived, it could be such an exciting division."

DenverBroncos,36nxgi,bcos4life,7,Wed May 20 21:20:59 2015 UTC,"Chargers have to go.  They are always the odd man in the division.   Broncos v. Raiders/Broncos v. Chiefs/Chiefs v. Raiders are all classic rivalry games.  I think the easiest thing is for SD to NFC West, STL to AFC West. It shortens the travel for the Rams, and it allows for TWO major state battles for Rams v. Chiefs."
DenverBroncos,36nxgi,yamaha2k11,2,Wed May 20 20:51:48 2015 UTC,"Maybe the Chargers switch with the Seacocks. I mean Seattle was in our division a couple years ago. I honestly don't want to see this division change, but the logistics of having 2 division opponents sharing a stadium makes it seem like there will have to be some sort of change."
DenverBroncos,36nxgi,WisconsinDane,1 point,Wed May 20 22:00:10 2015 UTC,"I think the raiders will stay. I know both teams are original AFL teams, but the raiders just have a stronger AFC history than the chargers.  Seahawks should move back, but their current rivalry with SF is probably too big to mess up, so probably Rams or Cardinals."
DenverBroncos,36nxgi,troubledhumans,-3,Thu May 21 09:17:40 2015 UTC,"Are you crazy ?? The Chargers have been our only real competition in the AFC West the last few seasons. I dont think the NFL is dumb enough to move the chargers which would basically leave us uncontested as Division champs(Rivers has had our number for years, its always a good game when we play them)"
DenverBroncos,36nxgi,lsjunior,8,Wed May 20 19:45:25 2015 UTC,"No, actually, I think I stated my case quite clearly. Moreover, teams can drastically change over the course of just a few years. We went from 4-12 to 13-3 in two seasons. The Chiefs went from 2-14 to 11-5. Just because the Chargers have played us closely recently could mean nothing five years from now, especially with Rivers and Manning both nearing the end of their careers.  That said, I think the NFL is more likely to use your line of reasoning, which is why I said I think it is the Raiders who will ultimately leave."

DenverBroncos,36lpyy,EyeAmmonia,1 point,Sun May 24 16:58:01 2015 UTC,"You can't say it was the wrong play just because the players didn't execute.   If the slot receiver pushes Browner back further, touchdown.   If Russell Wilson throws the ball to the right 12 inches, it's a touchdown or an incompletion.   If the defensive back doesn't make an excellent play on the ball without any hesitation, it's either a touchdown or incomplete.  Based on your logic, you can't say that a run to marshawn lynch was the right play call then, because you don't know how that would have turned out. He could have gotten stuffed, then they have to take their last timeout and they're forced to throw for their last 2 downs. You don't know. The pass play they called was intended to be a touchdown or incomplete so they would have 2 plays left and a timeout if it didn't work.  Bottom line, it wasn't a bad call. Just bad execution."

DenverBroncos,36j3e4,p-wing,12,Tue May 19 20:08:09 2015 UTC,That's not a knock on Brock this is a compliment on the progress he's made. Also those 20 teams do not have the non-QB talent this team does.
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,dalibkid,8,Tue May 19 20:15:45 2015 UTC,"Two of those teams from last year were San Diego and Kansas City. If Brock is already as good as Smith he's set. If he's already as good as Rivers, he'll be a good starter for years."
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,aatencio91,1 point,Tue May 19 21:35:59 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I remember when he came into the league and everybody said he was a raw product and would be a long-term project. I think that the coaches in Denver have done a good job working on his mechanics. He just needs to get more comfortable running the offense.  The times I've seen him in the game, he looked a little scared and not confidant, but then again, Peyton gets all the snaps and reps in practice with the starters, so it's not surprising. I'm just hoping he sticks around and if he does, those issues will subside once he gets more comfortable with the offense, which will happen when he gets to work with the starters."
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,yamaha2k11,6,Thu May 21 00:48:40 2015 UTC,"If he doesn't get to test his stuff under Kubiak's offense this year I'm going to be sad.

DenverBroncos,36j3e4,SonicSC,17,Tue May 19 20:53:50 2015 UTC,Jake was an ASU player and a Denver player.  Of course he's going to say good things about Osweiler.
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,gakbds,3,Tue May 19 21:20:37 2015 UTC,Osweiler is really tall.  He's not going to have great footwork.
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,gakbds,3,Tue May 19 21:55:19 2015 UTC,"Has he had the chance to see more of Brock than the rest of us, stopping by Dove Valley and seen him in practice maybe?"
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,Danserud,4,Tue May 19 22:43:43 2015 UTC,So by that logic he's already the 12th best QB in the league?  Plummer isn't an expert but I like his optimism I guess.
DenverBroncos,36j3e4,tnick771,1 point,Tue May 19 23:41:43 2015 UTC,"I'm a little late to the party, but yeah, he's probably pretty close to that. There's a lot of gray area once you get outside the top ten. If you like a big, young, athletic, but inexperienced, quarterback more than an older, less athletic guy who has a good résumé or a more athletic quarterback who's worse at passing, then Brock could easily move way up on your board.  If there were a redraft, he'd be one of the first 20 quarterbacks off the board easily. I don't think he would go much higher than 19 or 20 though, just because he doesn't have any regular season starts. He definitely has the talent and, if you watch his preseason last year, you'll see how much he's progressed mentally."

DenverBroncos,36icba,4NiK8,-11,Tue May 19 19:26:19 2015 UTC,"Compare the receivers that Revis/Sherman/Davis faced to the receivers CHJ faced. The quality of receivers that CHJ covered was very low compared to the other 3. Until Harris goes up against elite receivers, I can see why people aren't ranking Harris as the best CB in the league. He's still a great corner, but you can't be #1 without facing any top 10 receivers."
DenverBroncos,36icba,uckthejets,10,Tue May 19 21:49:38 2015 UTC,"What are you talking about?   CHJ played against similar receivers as Revis and Sherman. Play NFC west, which Sherman plays twice a year , and we played Buffalo, Miami, and the Jets this season which Revis went up against twice.  The only cornerback that can arguably be the number one cornerback, other than Chris Harris, is Vontae Davis."
DenverBroncos,36icba,skullyD,3,Tue May 19 22:54:44 2015 UTC,"I think there is some validity to this, but that it is often overstated in a way that makes it seem like everyone else exclusively covered all-pros all season while CHJ was covering middle schoolers.

DenverBroncos,36i3hl,andrrrew,11,Tue May 19 16:08:09 2015 UTC,"I fucking love Von. He's absolutely my favorite Bronco right now, and if he stays in Denver for his career, he'll rival Champ, Rod Smith, and Elway as my all time favorite.   I only worry about two things with Von: I worry he won't remain a Bronco for his whole career, and I worry that he will be overshadowed his whole career by how absolutely insane JJ Watt is."
DenverBroncos,36i3hl,aatencio91,5,Tue May 19 16:23:41 2015 UTC,"I thought he'd be higher, was hoping for him to fall in the 4-6 range"

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,autonomous2323,12,Tue May 19 17:35:26 2015 UTC,"No. It has been made clear for years Pat Bowlen wants his family to continue owning the team, and his children are already greatly involved. I don't see anyone else owning the team. I honestly have no idea why anyone would think that scenario would work, or would happen."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,CO_Boiler,-1,Tue May 19 17:39:47 2015 UTC,"It's good and well to say that, but the future is incredibly hazy right now.  Goodell has given us a  transitional phase but has expressed on behalf of the other owners they'd like to see stability in owner's chair by 2018. It could mean one of the kids stepping up. It could mean Kroenke. It could mean Mark Cuban purchases the franchise. But they have expressed a time table in which they want stability."

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,aatencio91,2,Tue May 19 19:28:06 2015 UTC,"I get people don't like Mark Cuban but for all intents and purposes he is an amazing owner. Incredibly passionate about his team, not afraid to spend and go hard after free agents, with all that being said he'd have to have a big group of investors to be able to get the Broncos.  Also, I can't see him splitting his time between the Mavs and the Broncos."

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,stillwaitingatx,5,Thu May 21 20:19:23 2015 UTC,"There is stability... His son is something like a 40% owner, with Ellis holding some as well. So you can say they want stability, but that is based on PB's will and the transition there, and that is a personal decision the league can't say much about. As of now Ellis is in charge, which is essentially where is he had been, and Elway is #2. It would create more instability for the league is Kroenke bought the team because then you have new owners of 2 teams, and that will certainly mean cleaning house in both teams if the old regime. So, it's an alright argument, but in reality more instability would be created if they interrupted the transition planning already in place."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,CO_Boiler,6,Tue May 19 19:05:48 2015 UTC,"It's always going to come up because of his Denver ties, but I highly highly doubt that the franchise will leave the Bowlen family.  All the ""but transition time"" and ""but the league wants"" talk is bollocks, to me. Many of Bowlen's children are involved in the operation of the team already, and as long as one of them is willing to do what Pat did and say, ""I trust football people to make football decisions, and business people to make business decisions"" then we'll be fine.  I see the Bowlen family becoming much like the Rooney and Mara family."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,Mister_Jay_Peg,4,Tue May 19 19:24:16 2015 UTC,"I believe the Bowlen family will continue to own the team. The only other person who I could see being owner, or part owner, is John Elway."

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,SuburbanHell,3,Tue May 19 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"I am not in favor of this, and I am not in favor of him owning more than one other sports team in Denver. It seems to me that when one Kroenke team in Denver is doing well, the others suffer. So they dump money into them until the team working well starts to suffer like the others. There will never be a year when the Nuggets AND Avalanche BOTH make a championship run in the same year. Especially if the Mammoth and Rapids are doing well. They use the success of one to support the others.  One of the sports stations was talking about Kroenke trying to go for the Broncos a while back. They made a very good point about how Kroenke isn't very good at creating championship teams but is good at selling regular season tickets. His teams are usually ""good enough"" to make money. If he were to buy the Broncos he would own everyone but the Rockies (Avalanche, Nuggets, Mammoth, and Rapids) That would be 5 of the 6 major teams in Denver. He would likely try to buy out Mile High from Sports Authority and then he would own 3 of the 4 major sports venues excluding Coors Field. He would have to sell off the Rams BUT he could return to being sole owner rather than KSE since they all exist in the same city."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,codfos,2,Tue May 19 22:33:39 2015 UTC,"I really hope it stays with the Bowlen family.  I dont know anything about his kids, but if they can be 80% as good as their dad - then I will be happy.  Plus, there are some other great people in the organization.  If they are smart, whomever gets the reins, will take their job and listen and learn from those around them in the organization."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,bullet_sponge,2,Tue May 19 19:41:49 2015 UTC,"This is not true at all. The Broncos have repeatedly stated that they are not for sale and that the NFL has no ""transition""time needed. The plan is for a Bowlen kid (a few work already with the team) to take over."

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,ragingavaholic,1 point,Tue May 19 20:57:49 2015 UTC,"I thought it was prohibited for owners to have more than one franchise in the NFL. If so, fuck him if he even thinks about selling the Rams for us, he is great at making his teams suck. I doubt this will happen though."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,The_American_Viking,1 point,Wed May 20 00:17:34 2015 UTC,"I feel like if he were to buy it we would just end up being a bottom tier team for many many seasons. Nuggets havent been good for a very long time, and the Avalanche were at the bottom of there division. Its great that one guy has all the money to do that but part of being in a very competitive league is scooping up free agents and spending money it would cost more than a billion dollars to buy this franchise ( Browns sold for ~$1.2 Billion). Right now we are building this team from the outside in picking up top free agents when we can and filling holes where we have them. But if this guy already has two franchise and the Rams, who have been the opposite of what any of us would want the franchise to look like, this guy cannot pay free agents to help us win. I mean yeah John as our VP does mean a lot but I bet he's doing a lot of what he does for this franchise because he loves Denver and his relationship with the Bowlen family. I hope it doesn't and I dont think the league would be cool with it... ""Okay so i have a franchise, they kinda suck and I own 2 different major league teams can I just you know trade my shitty one for the better model if someone buys my franchise..."" like however you word it, it will come out as stupid because this is the exchange of over 2 BILLION DOLLARS, do you know how much legal documentation there has to be? you think mortgage papers  are bad and require a lot that would be like the intro to this mega deal. Fuck Kroenke long live the Bowlen family's ownership!!"
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,welker_skelter,1 point,Wed May 20 19:00:56 2015 UTC,I would be pissed if Kronke bought the Broncos.  The only person I'd want to ever buy the team is Mark Cuban.

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,sgrace_wrk,2,Tue May 19 17:40:36 2015 UTC,Correct. Mr. B wants his children to run the franchise.

DenverBroncos,36ilfr,boulderboulderboulde,0,Tue May 19 19:20:31 2015 UTC,"I have never heard about this before, and it seems to be all speculation. I highly doubt the Broncos would be sold. And it would be a huge move for Kroenke to sell the Rams and then buy the Broncos, as I doubt the NFL would allow him to own two teams simultaneously and other owners would probably frown upon the move. Either way, I hope this will never be more than speculation from one reporter. I don't want an owner like Kroenke who seems more interested in having an LA team than anything."
DenverBroncos,36ilfr,bobybushia,0,Tue May 19 17:43:56 2015 UTC,"I kinda figured as much, especially with Mr. B's ROF announcement and HOF talk lately. I wonder why this guy thinks it's even possible. Maybe just desperate to keep his team, and grasping at straws. Kinda sad really..."
DenverBroncos,36e310,iseedoug,15,Mon May 18 17:38:09 2015 UTC,Does this not get you guys stoked for Kubes being back even more?
DenverBroncos,36e310,Formber,6,Mon May 18 17:38:57 2015 UTC,"2005 was magical. We were a legitimate threat and whatever happened in 2006 that started the downward spiral was certainly not helped by Kubes leaving. I think Lynch probably knows a thing or two about that locker room and what the glue was, so for him to say this definitely gets me excited!"
DenverBroncos,36e310,TheLegend18,4,Mon May 18 20:27:10 2015 UTC,I just felt like something has been holding us back. I really hope for some nasty to come out...I know teams respect the Broncos due to PFM. I just want teams to be scared of the entire team. Hold nothing back this year. Coaches need to be creative and agressive....put teams away early and often & let's get some wins.
DenverBroncos,36e310,h3isenburg,3,Tue May 19 01:04:32 2015 UTC,Amen! I want this season to be hyper aggressive from all angles.
DenverBroncos,36e310,troubledhumans,6,Tue May 19 01:32:23 2015 UTC,Fox and JDR have made so many bad calls it's not even funny. Hopefully this guy can get us back to the Super Bowl. We do have PFM.
DenverBroncos,36e310,aatencio91,6,Mon May 18 23:12:25 2015 UTC,It's rad to see that it isn't just fans that feel this is exactly what the Broncos needed. IMO this will define Elway's legacy in the front office.
DenverBroncos,36e310,crueg,7,Mon May 18 18:39:20 2015 UTC,"It'll certainly define Elway's legacy as GM/VP of Football Ops. If it works, it'll be a ""YAY they got the Broncos back in the family and everything is happy!"" If it fails, it'll be ""Dumb old Elway and his cronyism. The Broncos are just a good ol boys' club."""
DenverBroncos,36e310,mack2nite,5,Mon May 18 19:05:38 2015 UTC,My thoughts exactly. If we have a success with kubiak post-manning Elway is going to look like a mad genius. If not....well fuck
DenverBroncos,36e310,azbycx1234,7,Mon May 18 21:01:07 2015 UTC,"I like reading this stuff, but I can't just ignore Kubes disgusting final year in Houston and consequently being chased out of the state. Maybe I could look past that league worst performance, but we did the same thing when we hired Fox and had to finally admit that was a failed experiment."
DenverBroncos,36e310,aatencio91,28,Mon May 18 19:31:05 2015 UTC,I don't consider Fox a failure at all. He brought us out of the abyss and turned this franchise around. That assessment seems very shortsighted
DenverBroncos,36e310,BlindManBaldwin,5,Mon May 18 20:24:36 2015 UTC,"Yeah, while the Broncos didn't achieve the ultimate goal, it's important to remember that they did win the AFCW 4 times in a row, and one of those can't be passed off as ""Yeah but Peyton though."""
DenverBroncos,36e310,baha24,10,Mon May 18 21:03:49 2015 UTC,"tbh 2011 was all Fox somehow making a read-option offense work in the NFL. He gets too much credit for 2012-2014, but not enough for 2011."
DenverBroncos,36e310,vindawg08,6,Mon May 18 22:04:18 2015 UTC,"He gets too much credit for 2012-2014, but not enough for 2011.   I agree completely with this. ""Yeah but Peyton though"" is absolutely a fair argument for the team's success over the past three years, and when Peyton wasn't enough to carry the team, the head coach was nowhere to be found. I heard it summarized perfectly in this sub a while back, and I'm paraphrasing: ""Fox is a coach that can make a bad team good and a good team very good, but he can never take that last step to make a very good team great."""
DenverBroncos,36e310,BlindManBaldwin,2,Tue May 19 01:30:59 2015 UTC,Wasn't that more Mccoy than Fox?
DenverBroncos,36e310,mack2nite,1 point,Mon May 18 23:52:40 2015 UTC,"Fox likely had final say, and it was a very unorthodox move that could have hurt his future Hc chances."

Anything less than a super bowl championship when you're lucky to get PFM and a solid supporting cast is a failure to me. My views would be quite a bit different if Fox had Tebow for his entire tenure and had the same result."
DenverBroncos,36e310,vecchiobronco,2,Mon May 18 21:19:13 2015 UTC,"I think about that too, but what gets me through it is thinking how much he got out of Schaub before Schaub turned into the Schaub we know now."

Wolfe and Jackson have always been DE/DT tweeners who ought to play well at 3-4 end. Williams is a bit of a question as he hasn't show too much so far, but they drafted him highly and think highly of him, so he'll presumably get the first chance. Marvin Austin will probably get the second chance. They also have a couple of rookies to look at at nose."

DenverBroncos,36e5py,minimegacar,9,Mon May 18 18:00:29 2015 UTC,"PFF really focuses on a very direct way of grading. In terms of efficiency and performance, Sanders may have had the better year, but that may not account for DT possibly taking the defensive focus away from Sanders, or Sanders lining up against the second corner or in the slot.   I don't think anyone disagrees that pure wide out talent, DT is better. And you can see that DT's best performance graded higher than Sanders'. But the way PFF grades, that's just their system saying Sanders is just a mere 3 spots ahead of DT"

It's just some stupid fan site who uses an arbitrary point system. He also gave the Patriots 1 point for"

DenverBroncos,366xdu,aatencio91,1 point,Sun May 17 17:30:29 2015 UTC,I hope the contract for Heuerman doesn't become a problem or source of drama.  They really should hold players out of practice until their contracts are signed...
DenverBroncos,366xdu,indyxetan,4,Sat May 16 19:36:30 2015 UTC,"they shouldn't hold players out of practices, especially mini camps, considering how many udfa's are out there with them. It's also a big factor in who gets cut early on, so holding out of practice isn't doing them any real good."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,BlindManBaldwin,11,Sun May 17 03:08:15 2015 UTC,"Probably if a cornerstone player was the reason for multiple titles (3+) and Elway's tenure as a GM doesn't end the best way possible.   It's difficult, but I don't think it's impossible."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,bmsuperfly,3,Sun May 17 03:40:19 2015 UTC,The team would really have to tank after Manning. With Elway as Gm the team has never even not won the division. Improbable but like you said nothing is impossible in the nfl.
DenverBroncos,3688zo,lsjunior,8,Sun May 17 23:32:28 2015 UTC,"Idk... I honestly don't think anyone will ever think of the Broncos and not see Elway's big ole horse face.  He's taken us to 5 superbowls, 2 wins, HoF, RoF, Superbowl MVP, NFL MVP, etc. Now he nearly runs the team?   Honestly, I don't see anyone overtaking Elway. Maybe it's my irrational bias speaking, but I can't think of the Broncos without putting a picture of Elway in there somewhere.   It's gonna be reeeeeaaaaallllllyyyy difficult for someone else to come in here and do that, if the opportunity ever arises."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,skullyD,6,Sun May 17 04:38:18 2015 UTC,"I think the only way that could be a possibility is with new generations of fans, and even then it's only on a personal level. John Elway is THE Bronco, and we should build golden statues of his likeness and worship them. Thankfully, I was fortunate enough to catch the last few Elway season before I turned 10. I didn't really understand what was happening on the field in detail, but I rooted for the Broncos and Elway won those Super Bowls which is the greatest thing any single player has done for the franchise.  Conversely, Jake Plummer will never be in the discussion of all-time great Broncos. But he's sort of the face of the Broncos for me because when I started getting into football and really understood what was happening, he was the player I loved to watch the most. My Broncos' fan experience is defined by Jake Plummer and I hold him in very high regard because of that. He will never mean to the Broncos what John Elway dose/did, but Jake means a lot to me as a fan. If a fan can become attached to a player like that, they will mean a lot to them now and in the future."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,OpabiniaGlasses,3,Sun May 17 07:08:30 2015 UTC,"We're in the same boat. I was only like 5 and 6 when we won the Super Bowls though. I started watching for real during Jake Plummer's first season in Denver and I've been hooked ever since. Even during the 4-12 2010. Once you're a Broncos fan, it's for life."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,andrrrew,2,Sun May 17 12:48:10 2015 UTC,Same thing here lol. I was about 9 or 10 when Elway took us to glory.
DenverBroncos,3688zo,caesarfecit,5,Sun May 17 23:36:38 2015 UTC,"I mean he's our Jordan. I really don't see a Broncos team not having Elway seen as the face of the franchise. He will be in the discussion for ""top 5 best QBs all time"" for many many years to and will always be talked about as long as there is an NFL, his work as a VP in the league and doing well at it will only increase the talk.  I think it would take a Broncos player to surpass Elways accomplishments on the field to start the removal of Elway as THE Bronco. Manning will honestly be the closest for a while, mostly because he's a QB and that's the glamor position, but the fact that he  IS the Colts Elway and he hasn't been able to be on a Broncos  team that wins the chip  yet he won't be that to us."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,Twizzle-dizzle,3,Sun May 17 17:07:09 2015 UTC,"Yeah definitely, probably 25-30 years from now the new generation will have their own stars to remember."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,Occams_Lazor_,3,Sun May 17 12:08:08 2015 UTC,My cocker spaniel's name is Elway. The legacy is real.
DenverBroncos,3688zo,indyxetan,3,Sun May 17 13:54:05 2015 UTC,"Hopefully in the future (maybe even now) we will have players that will be so good (for us, for the league, for the fans) that he overtakes him. Like, say, and this is totally hypothetical, that Osweiler comes in after PFM and turns out to be the second coming of Elway with a little bit of Peyton, takes us to the playoffs for a decade straight, wins two super bowls, so on and so forth, makes a name for all the crustaceans out there... He could be this generation's Elway. He could be our face of the franchise."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,kgxv,2,Sun May 17 16:39:08 2015 UTC,Nope. You can't really have a better career than elway. Took us to 5 Super Bowls. Retired as the winningest quarterback in NFL history. He was the first to do it for us and he's still bringing success to this franchise. There's talks of him even being the owner in the coming years. Whatever success we have with him at the helm will just add to his legacy. He'll always be the face of the Denver Broncos and he'll always be godlike to fans.   He'll have to fail miserably as the GM and we'll have to have a coach/QB combo similar to Belichick and Brady and win 7 Super Bowls for us to forget about elway. I just don't see it happening.
DenverBroncos,3688zo,Drek49,2,Sun May 17 06:28:36 2015 UTC,"Probably.  Not for many many years though, and it will take an Elway-caliber star to replace him even then.   So fast forward 40-60 years when we are our grandparents' ages.  Their football stars are people we've never seen and truly can't appreciate the way they do, Elway will become that for our grand kids.  He'll just be a name linked as one of the greats, or some grainy-ass footage on an NFL Films documentary.  They won't have any true appreciation while we try to learn them a thing or two about a thing or two.  Especially if a new ""greatest bronco ever"" will be playing in their era."
DenverBroncos,3688zo,SuburbanHell,2,Sun May 17 13:08:12 2015 UTC,"Considering his national following, Tim Tebow could overtake Elway if he played for the Broncos for 12-15 years and won a couple Super Bowls.   I think it would have to take someone like that: college football superstar who is popular outside of football."

They show all the games now on national broadcast, but that season they hardly did. Would have been nice if he just accepted a FB or TE position in the team and stay around.   His upper body is too muscular I think for a quick release. He's not built to be a QB. Look at Manning. He's got very little muscle mass, tall and a giant brain (figuratively). Tebow just can't accept playing another position that fits his body."

DenverBroncos,364jf2,stoneyredneck,8,Sat May 16 03:58:16 2015 UTC,"Same. I still can't fathom how so many Broncos fans just straight up hate his guts. Like, not even indifference, but pure, seething hatred towards him. The guy was giving us everything he had, week in and week out, and sure, he didn't look like Elway out there, but that's no reason to hate the guy. Like, what do you want? Sorry he couldn't throw it like Manning? Sorry ESPN wouldn't shut up about him? Sorry he somehow wronged you on a personal level?   He was still responsible for one of the most entertaining Broncos seasons I've ever seen. The highs, the lows (oh god the lows), the improbable wins, the hilarious throws, the sheer ridiculousness of it all. It was truly something else.   Maybe the games weren't a full on offensive onslaught for 60 straight minutes, but that doesn't mean they weren't entertaining--at least with the way I watched them. I was laughing at the bad just as much as I was cheering for the good. It was just so unlike anything I'd ever seen, I couldn't help but to take a different viewpoint on it. And those nail-biting, sweaty palm moments in 4th quarters, and the elation when the Broncos somehow managed to pull off wins in those games--it was well worth sitting through those first 3 quarters. You don't get the peaks without the valleys.   And then that streak when Tebow took over and they went from 1-4 to 8-5. Amazing. That was also the last full Broncos season I got to watch with my dad, so it also holds a special place in my heart for that reason too. The pure, unfiltered joy and excitement I got to share with him after some of those ridiculous wins... The Jets, the Bears, the freaking Steelers overtime... Tim Tebow was a central part of all of that, and I remember the transition we had from skeptical, to straight up cheering for his crazy antics on the field. You guys can hate Tebow all you want, but I won't forget the joy that season brought me."
DenverBroncos,364jf2,WhiskeyWizerd,2,Sat May 16 19:36:07 2015 UTC,Misplaced hate for the media hype most likely.
DenverBroncos,364jf2,vecchiobronco,-2,Tue May 19 05:06:25 2015 UTC,"Its easy. He became bigger than the game itself. A win wasnt a great team effort, it was the amazing tebow pulling 1 play at a crucial point because his defense (and ""god"") put him there. A loss wasnt an acceptance of his inability to throw the football, it was something the defense did.   Every game was focused on how great a person Tebow was vs how the sport was being played."
DenverBroncos,364jf2,testreker,3,Sun May 17 04:09:59 2015 UTC,"yes i know he was bad for 3-3.5 quarters, but it was worth it for the exciting finishes. Most entertaining season for me and even though i love manning, i will miss tebow."
DenverBroncos,364jf2,Theingloriousak2,13,Mon May 18 04:59:47 2015 UTC,Where's the longer video of him from the first three quarters not making any plays which is how we had to come back from 10 points down in the first place??
DenverBroncos,364jf2,Greeney494,9,Sat May 16 02:03:54 2015 UTC,"So many people talk about what an exciting time that was to be a Broncos fan, and I always wonder if they're crazy or just have selective memory. Most games were 95% of the most boring, brutally bad offense I've ever seen in my life."
DenverBroncos,364jf2,BingBongtheArcher19,7,Sat May 16 05:09:37 2015 UTC,"3.5 quarters of shit offense, solid defense."

I was hoping the playoff's that year would allow for a Denver-NE Championship game.  I obviously would root for the Pats first but I also wanted Champ Bailey to get a ring.

DenverBroncos,364jf2,testreker,-8,Sat May 16 18:14:56 2015 UTC,I still hate tebow. I think his religious personality overshadowed the fact that he was carried by a defense and kicker.
DenverBroncos,3643i3,SaltLakeBronco,6,Fri May 15 23:16:07 2015 UTC,"Virgil Green is a blocker first and foremost. The o line is young, inexperienced or ineffective. Granted kubiak will bring a new system, but I think Virgil stays and helps whoever plays RT frequently. He will be crazy touchdown dependent and a fantasy bust. Coming from a Broncos fan, btw."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,wrigleyDPS,2,Sat May 16 08:48:05 2015 UTC,"This. I'd be surprised if Green is heavily used as a Julius Thomas-style TE. He will get used more often, but he'll be needed to block more unless the O-line performs dramatically better than expected."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,caesarfecit,3,Sat May 16 15:27:22 2015 UTC,"I think this is a pretty accurate assessment. Green has been a team player and blocked the way he was asked to, but he was known for catching touchdowns in college, he's a very dependable receiver when called upon, and I do think he's going to surprise a lot of people this year. I don't think he'll match JT's output, but it will be in the same ball park. Want proof that he's good enough and smart enough to do well in whatever he's called upon to do? From NFL.com's Combine profile: ""Green's an undersized, athletic, pass-catching tight end / H-back with big-play potential who doesn't bring much to the table as a blocker."""
DenverBroncos,3643i3,SonicSC,2,Sun May 17 10:56:13 2015 UTC,"Exactly. All through college, he was Kaepernick's safety valve AND best deep threat. Anyone who followed Nevada football then knows that all the receivers had hands of stone."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,bigrobwoot,6,Tue May 19 03:26:51 2015 UTC,This makes me want to reach for green in as early as the  4th-5th depending in the draft spot in fantasy this year.
DenverBroncos,3643i3,Colorado222,8,Sat May 16 02:44:03 2015 UTC,"He'll fall hard as people shouldn't be aware of him. Everyone thinks Daniels will be the starter. I'm gonna try to nab Green late and keep him on the bench. I usually limit myself to a few Broncos, and try to stay away from stars."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Sat May 16 02:57:54 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure I'd want to wait til late for him. Especially since he's still a TE. Even more so if you are playing in Bronco fan leagues like myself. He will be the lone guy I target this year as the hype of Anderson, Thomas, Sanders, and Manning is too overwhelming to even imagine. (Manning went 1st last year)"
DenverBroncos,3643i3,Colorado222,1 point,Sat May 16 03:26:49 2015 UTC,"Luckily, I don't tend to play in Bronco leagues. may this year though."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,BlindManBaldwin,2,Sat May 16 03:28:53 2015 UTC,Taking him in the 4th/5th round would be certifiably insane.
DenverBroncos,3643i3,OkAutopilot,1 point,Mon May 18 08:22:26 2015 UTC,"Not so much when Manning, CJ, and DT all going in the first. Everyone in my league are bronco fans and it isn't super competitive.  If there is a bronco you want you have to reach. Granted in my super competitive league I would certainly wait."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,Colorado222,2,Mon May 18 23:31:51 2015 UTC,"Isn't the point of fantasy football to win though? If people in your league are grabbing Broncos players abnormally high then why would you want to join in with that instead of just, you know, building the far superior team?   I get wanting to get Broncos players so you can watch them for two reasons, but I don't think I'd ever reach on a player just because they play for us."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,OkAutopilot,1 point,Mon May 18 23:35:00 2015 UTC,"I get it. Hence why I tend to wait it out. I try to bank on getting those vital early picks, then filling in. It's of my opinion that Green will be the beneficiary of our offense next year and will be a set and forget TE.   I could be wrong and end up having to find a new TE later in the season but that's ok. But I'll tell you, once Jimmy G. and Gronk are off the board, there are few other TEs that will be left that could have as good a chance at producing top numbers. I'd take him over Julius even. I'll concede, realistically the 4th or 5th is a major reach, but if he's there at that 5-6 or 6-7 wrap around I may pull the trigger.   Draft strategy is never set and in fact can be detrimental if viewed that way. Once draft day comes everything is out the door."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,Colorado222,2,Tue May 19 01:06:19 2015 UTC,"I think I'd take Gronk, Graham, Kelce, Olsen, Allen, Bennett, Witten, Eifert, Gates over Virgil at this point. He's really more of a blocking TE than a receiving TE, although hey it'd be great if he turns into more than that."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,OkAutopilot,1 point,Tue May 19 01:27:20 2015 UTC,"Eh the difference in scoring between that pool of players isn't that great. If Julius wasn't hurt last year he would have been up there with those guys and they all, outside of Gronk had their ups and downs... Golly I can't wait for football season."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,Colorado222,1 point,Tue May 19 01:43:39 2015 UTC,"No way. He'll likely be available on waivers in most leagues. And as good as he may look in this post, watching him shit on the Raiders is hardly a fair indicator."
DenverBroncos,3643i3,MurrayPloppins,1 point,Mon May 18 22:10:53 2015 UTC,I play in a league comprised of mostly bronco fans. No way he makes it waivers. TE has hardly any depth on top of this.
DenverBroncos,362ccu,SonicSC,10,Fri May 15 14:40:33 2015 UTC,Gotta love CJ.
DenverBroncos,362ccu,jigglewitit6,17,Fri May 15 15:29:07 2015 UTC,"This gif tells so much about Peyton's year last year.  The pocket was collapsing around him every fucking snap.  Eventually he got hurt, yes, but I think a big part of his second half lag can be given to the shit protection he got last year in that carousel of an offensive line.  It's the same thing that happened in the Super Bowl- despite his quick release, he was still getting hit too early and too often by the Hawks and that, ultimately more than their secondary, is what cost us the game.  In short, I think as long as Kubiak's scheme gives him a bit of a break this year, he'll be back to form.  I know everyone's counting him out, but I truly believe he wouldn't come back if he didn't think that he could be the same ol' Peyton.  Also, I DO realize this was all about CJ Manderson, so I'll add that I fucking love this kid and can't wait to watch him bloom in a Kubiak ZBS."
DenverBroncos,362ccu,indyxetan,8,Fri May 15 16:44:33 2015 UTC,"GREAT job by CJ and the hustle of downfield blockers, although I can't help but notice that it's probably not even a first down if #24 takes a proper angle."

DenverBroncos,3643kw,aatencio91,5,Fri May 15 23:16:53 2015 UTC,"With three ""designated"" pass rushers, what you'll likely find is they'll find ways to have all three on the field, and rush two with the third dropping into coverage, depending on the team of the week. Teams with weaker O-lines won't require that level of misdirection.   That was the main reason why you'd see Von occasionally drop into coverage, as teams would scheme against him expecting him to rush every play, thus exposing themselves to other pass rushers when he drops into coverage."
DenverBroncos,3643kw,caesarfecit,8,Sat May 16 15:26:03 2015 UTC,"I'm assuming he's going to just be a 2nd Von, where if he gets dropped into coverage, we'll be screaming ""WHAT THE FUCK WAS THAT CALL DEL RIO?!?!"", hopefully, HOPEFULLY we won't encounter that problem with Wade."

Denver doesn't need to bring the house every play.  Miller will play the strong side LB, which is hardly different from what he played last year. It requires the player to be in coverage in base formations. You can't rush 5 every play and leave a TE or RB wide open, he's gonna have to cover occasionally. Last year Miller had around 110 snaps in coverage, I expect a similar number this year."

Max Kellerman who doesn't like the Pats says they should change the rule. Go Broncos.  IMO all teams should be able to under inflate the balls if they want to. It's a preference for the QB not an advantage from what I heard guys like Eli Manning and Rogers explain it. The real advantage is better grip for RBs so leads to less fumbles and turnovers. The home games of NE support this claim. I'm all for it. I think the current  rule is limiting the game. I hate to see games decided by a defender punching a ball out and not even going for a tackle. Tackling is secondary now, they just go to punch the ball out. A slightly deflated ball will help (according to some pros I heard).

DenverBroncos,360tcw,Gurtang,8,Fri May 15 06:01:57 2015 UTC,I thought we were making a horrible decision in trading him. Back then he was this raw talent with a gunslinger arm and (to say the least) abrasive personality. But he appeared like he could become an elite QB.   At the time we were giving up so much potential for..... Kyle Orton.... And I am the biggest Orton basher there is. I hated him. And we got some draft picks but I didn't care at the time. Looking back I'm glad we got rid of him. He has been nothing but trouble for the Bears and years and years of one negative story line after another concerning Cutler.
DenverBroncos,360tcw,PMeist,2,Fri May 15 07:46:59 2015 UTC,I honestly think Shanahan could've made Jay into an elite quarterback.

DenverBroncos,360h0t,Raktoner,30,Fri May 15 05:08:35 2015 UTC,"I've heard so many people say that Julius is a product of Peyton Manning and I'm here to tell you my opinion.  Julius is a fantastic and athletic target who can make any quarterback shine.  Julius was everything you wanted in a receiving tight end. It's almost a cliche, but he truly was too big for corners and too fast for linebackers. He was big enough to line up on the inside and fight for yards after a short catch, and athletic enough to line up on the outside. His size and quickness made him absolutely dominant in the red zone. I remember a touchdown of his where he lined up one on one against a corner on the one and straight up dominated that corner. He broke away so easy any QB could have been able to hit him wide open in the end zone.  Julius, however, is not a field stretcher. That's not to say he didn't have the occasional deep pass, but those to me were definitely more products of Peyton as well as having other receivers to distract on the field. You might remember a 3rd and 17 against the Chargers in the 2013 season playoffs where Julius was wide open--that was a product of scheme, blown coverage, Peyton Manning, whatever.. it could have been any tight end there is what I'm saying. Or receiver for that matter.  Long story short, Julius is kind of overlooked as a product of Peyton but I think he's the real deal as far as a legitimate receiving tight end option. Just one thing of note..not a great blocker."

Will be interesting to see how his body holds up towards the end of his contract as his toughness was sometimes questioned in Denver. When he's on the field he's a stud, but if he gets dinged up even a little be prepared for him to sit."
DenverBroncos,360h0t,PMeist,13,Sat May 16 02:45:51 2015 UTC,"Mark Schlereth called him a 100% guy. Meaning if he was 100% he was awesome, if he was less than 100% you're going to get nothing."
DenverBroncos,360h0t,PMeist,2,Fri May 15 04:43:30 2015 UTC,That's a good way to put it as well. But that's probably due to the fact he actually hasn't played football very long. It's not like he's developed a football body over many years like most players do.
DenverBroncos,360h0t,Xelif,7,Fri May 15 04:45:30 2015 UTC,"Hey Casanova96, thanks for stopping by and engaging in a pleasant discussion.   Julius is a good talent. He's a very good talent. One of the more talented TE's in the NFL. He was so talented and showed so much promise that we kept him on the roster for two full seasons while he had serious injuries. It's rare that you take a chance on a 4th round TE 3 years after he's drafted but he became a star.  Now he was a huge help to our offense because he is a natural mismatch, especially in the redzone. He is a good talent and will be an immediate help to your offense. We've had great WR's as well to help shield JT from double teams and having defenses plan to take him out of the gameplan. We have had much better weapons than what Jacksonville currently has. Robinson and Hurns might be talented and up and coming WR's, but they aren't near the level of DT or Sanders.  The problem I have with Julius is that he was a product of Peyton Manning. Many great players are and that's not actually a problem. Julius was productive WITH Peyton, not because of Peyton. His numbers will never be as consistently good again. But that doesn't mean he won't be a huge help to Bortles and the Jags offense.   The reason I say he was a product of Peyton Manning is because many players are. If you look at Manning's time just in Denver you'll see a trend.   Peyton has absolutely inflated Decker's numbers. Decker was an elite WR with double digit TD's, but once he left and went to play with Geno Smith his production took a major hit. He had slightly fewer targets, slightly fewer catches, but significantly fewer yards and TD's.   Emmanuel Sanders while in Pittsburgh wasn't utilized very much. But his numbers have definitely become inflated by PFM and he is now considered a top WR, even as our #2 option. And once Sanders leaves Peyton or Peyton leaves Sanders his numbers will go back down.  Now it's an unfair comparison. There is only one PFM and he inflates everyones numbers, whether or not they would achieve the same on another team. I truly believe that guys like Marvin Harrison, Reggie Wayne, and Demaryius Thomas would all be elite WR's on any other team.   So now getting back to Julius. Him having inflated numbers by PFM doesn't mean he won't be good in Jacksonville. Objectively I still think he will be a - 700 yard, 8 TD kind of guy. That is excellent production from a TE and could be a productive safety valve for a young and growing QB. I really think he will have many good years in Jacksonville. But don't look to him being on pace to break the single season TD record like he was early last year.   It's not a horrible signing, it's a great signing for you guys. You need weapons around your young QB and he is a proven star. There will be some games he doesn't have more than a catch for a few yards, but there will be games he has monster stats. It's a great signing.   Now one thing I need to make mention of. His blocking is horrible. He is a clear and obvious weakness on the offensive line, and for his sake I hope he can improve that aspect of his game. It became a hindrance to our offense because wherever he lined up, the defense knew we would not be able to run behind him. They would stack the opposite side of the line and beat us in the run game. Just having him on the field meant it was usually a pass play.  His ability to get open and dominate in the redzone is a huge help. And that will be good for your offense, but it won't be all daises and sunshine. His blocking is actually a major issue and something he needs to improve.   In any event this is all my opinion, and I wish the Jags luck this coming season. Hopefully for you guys Bortles develops well and they have added some good talent around him. Good luck Jags!"

Just having him on the field meant it was usually a pass play.   A bit late, came here by link from /r/Jaguars.  Fortunately, the feeling is that Thomas won't be asked to block much. The Jaguars will likely run 2TE sets fairly often, with Marcedes Lewis (who is an excellent blocker and passable receiver) inline and Thomas off the LOS.  If he can develop as a blocker that would be awesome for both his career and the Jaguars, but we didn't sign him on the assumption that he will."
DenverBroncos,360h0t,indyxetan,1 point,Fri May 15 02:55:45 2015 UTC,"Fair enough. In fact I was going to make mention of what a mismatch he is when he's lined up in the slot or out wide. We did it sparingly but it always seemed to work out nicely.   Just know that if you do set up in 2TE formations the defense will already assume that you won't run it behind Jules. But I have no doubt he was brought in to catch, not to block."
DenverBroncos,360h0t,shindigg15,3,Sun May 17 20:45:32 2015 UTC,"He was over paid by... A lot, and he had the benefit of DT, Saunders/Decker and Welker taking pressure off him, but he was a good pick up. He'll be solid for Bortles, just don't expect comparable numbers from his last two years."

DenverBroncos,360h0t,Gurtang,1 point,Fri May 15 14:00:37 2015 UTC,"Thomas is one of the great tight ends, with or without PFM.  He has an issue with an ankle due to the fact he ruptured his Achilles and I think it bothers him a bit sometimes still.  It would seem that particular injury can flare up again at times.  It's probably easy to reinjure it a little.  That being said, he's another year out so its probably a little less prone to getting reinjured. I'm sure he will do great for the Jags.  Hopefully he can you guys burn Indy this year :)"

DenverBroncos,35xrkf,bgzlvsdmb,5,Thu May 14 19:19:05 2015 UTC,"That draft was actually a pretty good draft by the Broncos.  Everyone will remember the Tebow pick, and hey, was it good or bad? Well, we did make the playoffs the only year he started. He never had a chance to have a full offseason as the starter, so he was always going to be behind the 8 ball.  Rookie year = strike, so no offseason Sophmore year = Orton declared the starter, Quinn backup. So Tebow had no reps with starters, yet after 4 games, he goes in and leads Broncos to playoffs.  After that, Manning comes in, Tebow goes out. I truly do wonder what Tebow would have become had he been given an actual, legit chance to be a starter with the starter's share of reps in the offseason.  Lots of people hated the DT pick (Dez on board still). Lots loved the Walton pick (he's now out of league due to injury). Nobody thought much of the Decker pick until he took #87 and everyone started comparing him to Eddie Mac (white and wore #87. Similarities ended there though as Eddie Mac was tough as freaking nails and Decker only wanted to be a pretty boy tv star). And Cox had known issues off the field which is why he slid so far in the draft. But his talent was still pretty decent. He's still in the NFL and contributing.  So all in all, it really was a good draft. It's just that circumstances shaped and molded it into something that allows ample second guessing for everyone."
DenverBroncos,35xrkf,Big_Pete1999,3,Thu May 14 14:36:03 2015 UTC,"I am pretty superstitious in terms of ""changing the past"" even if hypothetically, because everything that occurred led us to now where we're pretty damned good.  That being said, in regards to that draft. Didn't we give up B Marsh? I know he had some drama, but was that a smart move at the time where we could have had DT and BMarsh on the same team? And probably still draft Decker for a three headed monster? True we'd still have Kyle Orton throwing, but he didn't fare too badly in the stats department."
DenverBroncos,35xrkf,sman2002,2,Thu May 14 14:58:47 2015 UTC,I'm only a little 'stitious.
DenverBroncos,35xrkf,justwingingit,2,Thu May 14 16:26:15 2015 UTC,"I think we gave up B-Marsh that offseason for two 2nd round picks. THEN the draft happened.  B-Marsh was gone no matter what. He was demanding a trade, threatening to sit out until a trade, etc. He was a petulant and disgruntled child. HAD HE BEEN OK IN THE HEAD, then yes, I would have LOVED seeing him and DT on the field together. Man, what sweet sweet music that would have made!  And like you, I hesitate to have these ""do overs"" because without our history, we aren't where we are today (as you state, pretty damn good).   Had we never drafted Tebow and stuck with Orton and finished 3-13, we probably don't have Manning, and we would have missed out on Andrew Luck anyways. So we'd be in perpetual hell right now with zero QB and zero winning seasons for the 8th straight year.   Instead of being talked about as super bowl contenders, we'd be talked about in the same breath as the Raiders and Buccaneers. Yikes!"

He's done well with the Avs (championship), okay with the Nuggets (10 years of competitiveness under Karl), and the Rams seem to be getting better year by year. However, during those 10 years of competitiveness under Karl the Avalanche were pretty lackluster, and after hiring Joe Sakic and Patrick Roy the Nuggets fell by the wayside. Meanwhile the Rams are getting better and better but it seems almost a foregone conclusion that they'll be in LA sooner than later."

The weak point off the offense is the OL... Which has two all pros on it and has a guru of a HC coaching it.  Please explain to me how that's not stacked  The only team that's been more talented was last year. Even thst is arguable depending on the growth of young players."
DenverBroncos,35wd8d,sman2002,1 point,Thu May 14 04:25:03 2015 UTC,"We are absolutely stacked. We have one of the most, if not the most talented rosters (still). The issue we had wasn't players it was coaching. And not we have a MUCH better coaching staff in place. Wade Phillips is one of the best defensive minds in the entire NFL. His scheme will fit our stacked defense better than JDR. Kubiak is a much better head coach than John Fox ever could be. Kubiak's an offensive guy and will coach up our Oline and get the most out of them. We are a stacked team roster wise and now we have the coaching to boot.  Only issue is we don't have Manning for much longer and it takes time to learn a new system and embrace it."
DenverBroncos,35wd8d,Joevahskank,1 point,Thu May 14 03:49:56 2015 UTC,"I actually liked how the end of last season we were forced to change the offense to run-heavy and we were pretty successful. Now we have a coach with a system who can capitalize on the run game, and hopefully keep Manning healthy. Every team has holes, but I would def say we are in the top 20% of teams this season. I wouldn't say ""we're #1"" for sure, but damn we look good. Can't wait for this season to start."

It should really be weighted the other way. Obviously the assistants should have said something to someone, or somehow found a way to disclose what was being requested of them, rather than continuing to break the rules. But indefinite suspension as the punishment? That's what fans should be up in arms about. Tom should be punished not only for the deflation, but coercion of the assistants, as well."

DenverBroncos,35vyvl,reddit2therescue,3,Thu May 14 00:03:58 2015 UTC,I think more thought is given to 'can I get away with it' vs 'what are the consequences'.
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,dragonbear,2,Thu May 14 16:57:41 2015 UTC,"Which is why I understand how Brady's initial suspension is longer than Ray Rice's. Not saying that what Rice did wasn't worse, because in terms of human actions, his was a million times worse. But what I am saying is that if a player, or team, gets off free from doing things to get a competitive edge then maybe it should come down hard on them when they get busted. Somebody has to be made an example of."
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,Big_Pete1999,4,Thu May 14 00:16:07 2015 UTC,"Here's my opinion on suspensions and the NFL pertaining to your question...  If it's a personal issue, it should be less severe than an ""integrity of the game"" issue.   The slippery slope is that the NFL loses ""integrity"" when it employes murderers, rapists, woman beaters, child molesters, etc. Does that not put into question the integrity of the NFL?   The slippery slope lies in this fundamental flaw: What's more important, human beings, or a game of football? Is hitting a woman a lesser crime than letting air out of a football? Is raping a woman in the bathroom of a bar a lesser crime than spraying silicone on a jersey? When you put it in that framework, you can easily say that personal issues should require stiffer punishment. Afterall, football is ""just a game.""  However, the flip side of that is that if you can't trust the game you are watching, then you'll stop watching. When you put it in that framework, then you can see that ""integrity of the game"" issues should require a stiffer punishment.  What is Big_Pete's solution you ask? Suspend them all. Word will get around. Suspend players for common sense stuff (murder, rape, violence). Stop suspending them for smoking weed or taking non-PED substances. They are safer than chemical drugs and have less dependency issues.   Bring down the Hammer of Thor (Mjolnir) on any ""integrity of the game"" issues (i.e. you can't appeal jack shit if it's from an ""integrity of the game"" suspension). Will this severely impact the NFL? Yep, but it will also clean the game up. If you make the punishment worse than the possible reward, then you'll stop needing to punish people after a while because nobody will be dumb enough to try to cheat.  Ban all communication devices from the stadium (for non-fans). This means that no radios or cell phones or anything is allowed into the stadium from all players, coaches, and on-field personnel. Put that stuff on lockdown for all I care. Make it impossible to cheat.   Caught deflating footballs? Season long ban AND you forfeit your super bowl. Sorry, but you cheated. Cheaters don't prosper. Circumvent the salary cap (cause that's what the moronic Pats fans love bringing up). You will be docked the money you circumvented from the next season's salary. Does that mean you can't sign your super star? Well, so be it. You shouldn't have cheated.   Things like that is what SHOULD happen. If anyone is serious about cleaning up the game, then they simply need to start making teams and players responsible for their actions.   Brady should be gone a minimum of this entire upcoming season. Bilichick should be banned from coaching for a minimum of 8 seasons (because he got busted for spygate 8 seasons ago and has apparently learned nothing). Robert Kraft should be fined a minimum of 1 season's worth of revenues. What does this mean? It means that 100% of all team related expenses comes out of his personal bank account. His team forfeits 100% of all revenues because he apparently thinks he's above the law.   Anyways, those are my idealistic world type punishments. Will all 32 teams be decimated with suspensions and fines? Probably. But word spreads that the commish isn't fucking around anymore. Once word spreads, players and teams will shape up real quick."
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,usmc35,2,Thu May 14 01:23:49 2015 UTC,"I would agree. Even though in all honesty the pats crushed, any ""cheat"" is a cheat and should be punished as such. Nobody truly knows how much the cheat helped or did not, and they shouldn't be in the game of deciding that. If you cheat AND you lie? Hammer hard. It is the same in any large organization which has competition.  The other difference with the outside stuff is that they also get civil and/or criminal charges from actual courts. The Brady/Pats thing falls solely into the lap of the NFL, and at the end of the day they exist solely as a business to earn a profit which thrives upon that notion of trust in the game you mentioned."
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,Big_Pete1999,3,Thu May 14 17:11:38 2015 UTC,"Plus, it's the whole Tebow and religion thing....  Tebow believed God helped him win. Whether or not God actually did is up for interpretation. But if Tebow believed he did, then he did (because the brain is a wonderful thing).  Whether or not over or under inflated footballs travel better, are easier to catch, etc isn't the point. If Brady believes he plays better with under inflated footballs, then he'll play better. Throw in the fact that he deliberately lied about it and refused to cooperate with the investigation, and you have a recipe for a fat suspension."
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,badcompany1981,1 point,Thu May 14 17:27:39 2015 UTC,"Very well put. I'd have to agree with you. I don't believe the NFL would follow the guidelines you've listed, but I think it's a pretty fair deal."
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,Fatandmean,-4,Fri May 15 01:08:02 2015 UTC,"As a Broncos fan I understand cheating happens and that most teams have or do cheat. When Denver cheated 15+ years ago I didn't or don't deny it Denver got caught and we took our punishment. I wish other fans and organizations did the same. Cheating is bad enough don't be a liar too. I say suspend cheaters but suspend the liars even longer. Everyone remembers the liars in baseball: McGuire, Sosa, Palmeiro, *Bonds, and Pete Rose (I like Rose). People tend to forget about some cheaters who cheated but admitted to cheating like Jason Giambi. Now to your question, personal life matters should have just as severe suspensions as liars because they represent the NFL shield and no one wants to be associated with criminals and liars. Cheating or trying to get an unfair advantage is one thing but criminals and liars are worse."
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,lojician,2,Thu May 14 00:37:00 2015 UTC,"Sorry for being ignorant here, but what did we do 15+ years ago?"
DenverBroncos,35vyvl,mysterious_pube,0,Thu May 14 02:53:36 2015 UTC,I'm not sure if this is what is being referred to but at some point the broncos were low on cash because they were building a new stadium and some of their players agreed to take delayed payments. My understanding is that the payments were comparable enough to what was in the contracts that it didn't result in an actual competitive advantage salary-cap-wise and was purely a cash flow thing. But honestly I don't know much about the details.
DenverBroncos,35uvoy,baha24,5,Wed May 13 18:32:44 2015 UTC,I really hope he can make the team if it means we get back down to 2 kickers.
DenverBroncos,35uvoy,SonicSC,3,Wed May 13 19:59:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, although I hope they don't rush to sign him to save a roster spot, like they rushed to sign McManus to save the cap hit of Prater's salary.  That was a bad move, IMO."
DenverBroncos,35uvoy,bigrobwoot,2,Wed May 13 21:42:00 2015 UTC,If he can average what Colquit did and do kick offs as well...Maybe McManus has improved I'm not sure. But he'd be real cheap when we have a lot of ppl to sign next season so I see Elway forcing this one like he did McManus. Will have to see

The field is named after him and he visited every once in a while. Espn did a home coming special (I forget the name of the show)  where Elway came and spoke infront of the high-school. I almost caught a little football he threw in to the stands but the bigger guy infront of me intercepted my moment of glory.

DenverBroncos,35rcmk,ninjaperch,50,Tue May 12 21:40:22 2015 UTC,The perfectly executed personal foul: following a touchdown immediately before the half so the penalty was applied to a meaningless kickoff.  PFM really is a pro.

DenverBroncos,35rcmk,BLT_with_extra_bacon,13,Wed May 13 01:00:35 2015 UTC,Gained respect for Peyton on that foul. It was an unnecessary hit. I personally won't miss him.
DenverBroncos,35rcmk,PowderedToastMann,6,Wed May 13 02:27:48 2015 UTC,I won't miss his crappy tackling.  He needs a team willing put up with giving up 5 additional yards on every play from him trying to strip the ball first from the same guy for the 15th time. Then tackle if it isn't working.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't Swearinger covering the TE? It's not like they straight up beat this guy on this pass. Someone fill me in."

It just doesn't seem fitting."
DenverBroncos,35rcmk,Royusmaximus,3,Wed May 13 03:24:24 2015 UTC,IIRC Swearinger was talking a lot of shit during the joint practices the Broncos and Texans had last offseason. There were a few fights that broke out with him involved in them
DenverBroncos,35rcmk,SteakFromJakeFarm,-10,Wed May 13 06:00:10 2015 UTC,"Pretty much already stated that above, doesn't really apply to the question.  It looks like Peyton came out of nowhere and gave him a big ""F you"", it's no wonder Swearinger was like, ""Why, bro?"" Cuz he had no idea where Peyton was coming from. You don't approach someone a few days later and say f you without context. That's just weird. Not sure how I feel about this situation.  Sorry for stating a fact..."
DenverBroncos,35rcmk,Royusmaximus,2,Wed May 13 06:57:42 2015 UTC,Dude...its all context. Swearinger was being a dick. He'd been a dick. He had just had a cheap shot on someone. Peyton burned them before the half so he went to let him know how he felt about it all. That's it. It all applies.
DenverBroncos,35rcmk,mneal228,-4,Wed May 13 17:08:19 2015 UTC,"If anyone read my actual comment, you would see that I already knew that.  It just seems that you would normally talk trash to someone who you just burned. Swearinger wasn't even the guy covering Sanders. If Peyton actually threw at Swearinger, it would make sense. When you score and talk trash to someone who wasn't even involved, it's just weird.  He should have just had a talk in private with Swearinger. If he really wanted to talk trash, it should have been to #35 or even #20 if I recall correctly. Is everyone completely oblivious to this? It seems like just because Peyton did it, everyone thinks it's ok. Perhaps he could have approached Swearinger right after he hit Welker?  I appreciate him standing up for his teammates, but it's like he chose to trash talk Swearinger at the wrong time. The right time by the game clock, but the wrong time in the sense that he might be lacking some social skills. Cool it."

DenverBroncos,35q5co,Seruphim5388,27,Wed May 13 21:48:31 2015 UTC,There's a grand total of one thing happening in the NFL right now.  It also happens to be the culmination of an overblown story from the regular season.  It ALSO happens to be the suspension of Tom Brady which not only is Schadenfreude but a huge deal in general.  Go find us some broncos news to talk about.  Until then we will continue to discuss the biggest football news of the off season.
DenverBroncos,35q5co,Seruphim5388,-4,Tue May 12 16:53:14 2015 UTC,Talk about our rookies. How can they fit into the team?   Talk about the schedule and how a mid season bye could be beneficial.  Hell if you wanna talk about deflate gate so much at least link to Peyton's words about it. At least that's somewhat relevant to the Broncos as a team.
DenverBroncos,35q5co,Seruphim5388,9,Tue May 12 17:08:45 2015 UTC,"Rookies. ""we'll see""  Schedule ""probably will help us, but at least it's not right at the beginning of the season this time""  Here's what Peyton says. “Like I said, I’ll speak it as clearly and slowly as I can. [Brady is] my friend, he’ll always be my friend. I don’t know what happened, I don’t have much more than that for you.”  yep, there's totally as much mileage in that stuff."
DenverBroncos,35q5co,wefr5927,-7,Tue May 12 17:13:32 2015 UTC,"At least it is relevant to the team as opposed to ""lol cheatriots"""

Well right now we have a team that cheats at every turn who go to the media and basically say ""fuck you, it's our business"" when asked about it, and during this whole admittedly overblown deflategate scandal, Brady has taken every chance to talk shit about it. and they got spanked for it.    This is our shermanface.gif just let the community get tired of it.  Besides we still have four months to go and we can only speculate about a season that hasn't happened yet for so long."
DenverBroncos,35q5co,igobychuck,2,Tue May 12 18:44:31 2015 UTC,Really? We can only talk so much about the rookies and the schedule.  Each of these topics have been talked about already.    Why can't y'all just create a megathread for Bronco fans?

DenverBroncos,35q5co,deadbolt629,57,Wed May 13 03:24:02 2015 UTC,I'm relishing in it. Fuck the Patriots. Mike Shanahan always said when they played the Patriots he had them under close watch by league officials and was especially cautious about team meetings and practices because he said they cheat at every turn and he would have none of it. That's why they never used to beat us. I'm hoping Kubes re-instills those preparation week precautions.   It's so refreshing to see them pay for once. It's well known around the league that the Pats are synonymous with cheating. Every former player has come out of the woodwork to say as much in the past 24 hours.   I'm personally going to enjoy the shit out of it for validating Shanny's concerns and proving he wasn't just overly paranoid.  So again I'll say it:   FUCK. THE. PATRIOTS.

DenverBroncos,35q5co,h3isenburg,5,Tue May 12 18:05:17 2015 UTC,There is such a thing as the vocal minority. People who are content with the state of the subreddit aren't going to be DM'ing the mods to make a change. The Brady thing is a big deal right now and it JUST happened. Give it a few days to blow over. Then the Patriot posts will be more out of place.
DenverBroncos,35q5co,s460,-3,Tue May 12 18:12:02 2015 UTC,It's not a vocal minority when the messages are frequent and coming from different users.
DenverBroncos,35q5co,p-wing,8,Tue May 12 18:27:06 2015 UTC,"And what percentage of the users of this subreddit does that make up? And now you've also said over the years? So what exactly is the rate of complaints coming in? If the complaints aren't matching up with the results of the arrows, I'd say its a safe bet that they are likely the vocal minority.   Upvotes and downvotes are actually pretty good at determining these sorts of things because you don't have to be vocal to cast your vote. You can monitor if anything slips through the cracks and try to rope troubling trends in, but a few Patriots-related posts in the days immediately following a huge story about a future HoF QB getting suspended in the middle of the offseason is not one of those trends.  The argument that some people use to go to /r/nfl for non-broncos discussions there is, frankly, bullshit. There have been multiple times that I've encountered people in this sub going on about exactly why they stay out of /r/nfl and come here instead. And the fact that there is a larger representation of Patriots and Seahawks fans than most other fan bases in that sub all tends to lead towards getting downvoted into oblivion if you don't go with the flow there. Especially considering the size of that sub.  Just because this is /r/denverbroncos doesn't mean that we are restricted to only speaking about the broncos. This is a place for broncos fans to gather and talk about the broncos and the nfl. If it's not, we'd better ban super bowl threads whenever the broncos aren't playing in it.  And the general trend seems to be that people agree more with /u/leechsucka and his approach. I doubt there's a trend of DMs to you that say otherwise.  Yes, we should be primarily Broncos topics, but not solely that. This sub gets dead enough during the offseason as it is.  Edit: You know would actually be better and garner a better response? As a mod, you could have mitigated this issue by making a mega-thread tied to this issue. That way, you'd at least contain all the non-Broncos related discussions to the one thread. It would also help if you had a more neutral thread topic. Rather than saying ""Is this /r/Denverbroncos or /r/fuckthepatriotscirclejerk?"", say ""Can we keep the Patriots posts to a minimum?"" or ""Here's a mega-thread for all your Brady suspension needs"". Problem solved and you don't have to end up arguing with a stick up your butt and verbally sparring with another mod of this sub."

This story is not just the biggest NFL story, but the biggest sports story in the past few days.  There is a reason it has front page links on ESPN and had a cover blurb on the front of the Seattle Times.  Regardless of the readers' feelings regarding Brady or the Patriots as a whole, it is a dramatic tale.  It really isn't surprising that the story would feature prominently on anything tangentially related to football.  At the risk of a flood of down votes, I wonder why a post lamenting the number of topics regarding this this story was stickied, potentially superseding actual Broncos news?"

I know he had like, 2 good seasons, but man, that last season of his in Houston with the, what was it, 7 straight games with a pick 6 in the first quarter? That was atrocious. Kubiak's offense excites me, and Wade's defense makes me feel all tingly inside."
DenverBroncos,35qe0h,crueg,7,Tue May 12 17:41:05 2015 UTC,"What a lot of people don't seem to realize is that Schaub was a really good quarterback. Really good. That all ended when he got his lisfranc broken in 2011. After that it was all down hill. He couldn't drive off his back foot and that sapped all the power from his throws. His game was limited severely. QB's get easy to pick off when they can't throw more than 15 yards.   That said, when the play action/zone blocking is working well it is a thing of beauty. When it doesn't though, it doesn't work at all and Kubes isn't big on deviating from the game plan.   I will enjoy the hell out of seeing what happens with y'all this year though.   edit: Good Schaub was worth at least 5 Daltons. Bad Schaub was about as bad as it gets"

DenverBroncos,35nxic,Abiv23,9,Tue May 12 15:16:54 2015 UTC,"I'll be the voice of opposition here. This suspension and the organizational fine are a load of horse-shit, and this actually makes Goodell look like a bigger asshat, and it has the power to make the Pats look sympathetic.  Follow me on this, now...  Brady was just suspended for the same amount of time as a guy who is caught taking PED's for ""probably"" telling guys to deflate the balls. There is no smoking gun here. Even the Wells Report uses that kind of language, and the Wells report is a horribly flawed logical document just to go THAT far. There was an infographic posted on the Pats sub that covers the leaps taken that is amazing.  But Goodell is going to come out and say it's something like 2 for the balls, and 2 for not turning over his phone.   But here is the issue with that...  If your boss or manager asked you to hand over your personal cell phone because there is speculation you may have taken home some office supplies because the supply closet came up short 2 boxes of pens? If you are a part of a union, do you think your union reps would be okay with that? Brady more than likely consulted the union extensively before declining to turn over his personal cell phone.  Now the organizational fines. I know Goodell said he would punish the team more harshly when the Spygate penalry was announced, but that was an action undertaken by the coaches of the team and utilized by all of the staff and many players (not just Brady). But in this case, people are quick to assume ""but OF COURSE Belichick and/or Kraft knew! How could they not?"" I ask, how could they? At multiple points the Wells Report says that the organization outside of those two equipment guys had no idea. And really, do you think Brady would have ever gone to Belichick and flat out told him? Or Kraft? Why? And to cap that, the organizational penalties can't be appealed like Brady's suspension. So that first rounder and $1M are fucking GONE unless Kraft sues.  And all of this over footballs that may or may not have been tampered with to put them marginally out of spec?  These are harsher punishments than were levied against a team (not coach, but team) in the bounty scandal where there was an organized effort from coaches and players to pay other players for injuries and vicious hits that could likely end in injury and then systematically tried to cover it up and lie about it, for God's sake.  This is more of an affront to the ""purity of the game"" than THAT???  I know I am in the minority  and I know my flair should have me on the other side of the fence, but holy shit people... Think about what this means if people start digging on Peyton, who was the other QB in 2006 who went to the other QB's and then the Competition Committee to get the ability to work the balls both home and away. What if this season in December they do measurements like this, and the balls come up a little light because it's cold as fuck?  This isn't the last we'll be hearing about this, and I doubt Kraft will forget about it when Goodell's next contract is considered with the league..."
DenverBroncos,35nxic,Mister_Jay_Peg,6,Tue May 12 12:02:20 2015 UTC,"I hate Brady and the Pats, but I think this whole thing was overblown. I simply don't believe it gave them a significant enough competitive advantage to warrant this kind of punishment even if there was real evidence, which there isn't. It's as bad as people acting like we were cheaters with the contracts we got fined over back in the SB runs."

DenverBroncos,35nxic,vecchiobronco,2,Tue May 12 18:30:16 2015 UTC,"But those are against the law, not just company policy.

Fact is Brady didn't turn over his phone because of the slim chance he'd be suspended for the Super Bowl, that is the truth.    It doesn't matter whether or not Kraft/BB knew, it is their responsibility, especially Kraft, to know.   Everyone needs to stop comparing this decision to previous ones, the NFL has been very clear since Ray Rice that they are going to be coming down a lot harder from now on. Not only that but the Patriots were warned explicitly after SpyGate that any future infractions would be met with increased severity.   I'm not worried about ""what this means for Manning"" at all.. If Peyton is cheating I'd want him caught and punished. Straight up.   The NFL will have much different policies/procedures for game balls this year, 100%."

The only angle I can see is that the Colts weren't afforded the same opportunity.  In the end I think it's a dumb rule, let them inflate or deflate to the QBs desire.   Edit: Good to see we don't down vote because of a conflicting opinion."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,Goliath0nline,19,Tue May 12 00:14:38 2015 UTC,It would not even be an issue if there was no taping scandal.  It would not be an issue if Brady cooperated with the investigation into the deflated balls.  The texts did not match Brady's statements.  Something was fishy.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,Juan_El_Way,-9,Tue May 12 00:18:41 2015 UTC,"Are you kidding?  It was an issue immediately, way before Brady was even asked to cooperate.  Yeah I agree they were shady, but it's still a stupid rule."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,Goliath0nline,16,Tue May 12 00:54:06 2015 UTC,it's still a stupid rule.   So teams should break rules that people think are dumb.  Would you like Denver to openly break dumb rules?
DenverBroncos,35n5so,ioncloud9,-5,Tue May 12 02:29:58 2015 UTC,If it got us a SB... maybe.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,sleepydogg,3,Tue May 12 04:36:27 2015 UTC,Why? People already try to discredit the two SB wins we do have. I'd rather not win a SB than have to deal with a third SB that's constantly being questioned.

DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,-10,Tue May 12 16:31:29 2015 UTC,You do know the taping scandal happened 9 years ago right?
DenverBroncos,35n5so,myshkingfh,7,Tue May 12 04:42:14 2015 UTC,But it is still absolutely relevant to this ruling. It's mentioned directly in the NFL's statement announcing the punishment.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,3,Tue May 12 04:50:27 2015 UTC,"It happened.    How many other teams have come under the gun so much in the last decade?   Don't want to be accused of cheating?  Follow the rules,  Even the dumb ones."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,myshkingfh,17,Tue May 12 10:43:27 2015 UTC,"They were altering the balls after the NFL process to ensure the balls we're altered. Then they withheld evidence from the investigation. This isn't about how much air was in the balls, this was about the Patriots' systematic effort to violate NFL rules and then frustrate the investigation."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,3,Tue May 12 00:35:00 2015 UTC,Valid points.  Sucks that they won't evaluate this rule now that they dropped a bomb on the Pats.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,myshkingfh,3,Tue May 12 00:46:35 2015 UTC,I would think they'd get rid of the dumb rule where everyone prepares their own balls and go back to the NFL just bringing neutral balls. It just stupidly invites problems.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,mothbitten,5,Tue May 12 00:53:20 2015 UTC,"That rule was put in place because of QB's including Brady and Manning.  Yeah, Manning."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,3,Tue May 12 00:58:27 2015 UTC,"I know, its still a stupid rule. I think Jake Plummer was involved too. At any rate, if I were running the NFL I'd get rid of this rule yesterday."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,mothbitten,1 point,Tue May 12 01:00:41 2015 UTC,I think it's okay for player preference.  Hockey doesn't make every player use the same exact stick.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,5,Tue May 12 01:05:09 2015 UTC,But the all use the same puck.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,tottenhamhotsauce,5,Tue May 12 02:42:47 2015 UTC,"So you'd be okay with a flat football? That would be great for running backs. Even a somewhat deflated football can provide a decent advantage on a cold winter day: easier to grip, easier to catch, harder to fumble.  There have to be standards, which is why there is a rule about the psi's that are allowed, else you'll have shenanigans.  Also, Tom Brady thought he didn't have to abide by the requirement to provide information to the NFL's investigator or tell the truth. This is a message to all the players that it doesn't matter who you are. You are not bigger than the NFL."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,-2,Tue May 12 02:32:40 2015 UTC,"You're really putting a lot of faith in the NFL.  As though they tell the truth cough Ray Rice cough they had the tape, even if they didn't they knew what happened cough.  Goodell gets to lie all day and night about that shit, but gets to make an example of Brady for lying?  A lie that can't really be proven is a lie? ( yeah I know it's generally more probable that it is a lie, but...)  A lot of things provide an advantage to teams.  They're aloud to ""break in"" the balls on the outside however they want.  Sure maybe there should be range, right now there's not much of one.  However in the end they should be consistent in punishment.  Chargers were caught rubbing balls in towels with an adhesive substance and initially declined to turn them over (obstruction?). They paid a whopping $20,000 fine on that infraction."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,shiboopi,3,Tue May 12 02:47:45 2015 UTC,"It's not about whether Goodell has the moral authority to punish the Pats, it's about whether he has the power, and clearly he does. I'll admit this is 75% about the Patriot's and Brady's obstructionism and lies, but at the heart of it is the act of cheating.   Tell me the truth: do you really believe that Brady did not know that he was outside the rules of the game by telling the equipment men to deflate the balls? Or do you actually believe these equipment men acted on their own? I can't imagine such a thing happening. Not to the Patriots, who flaunted their intricate knowledge of the rules with the ineligible receiver stuff they did.  Oh, and the charger towel thing was different. First, the NFL found no competitive violation. The fine was for being obstructionist when the ref tried to take the suspect towel from the equipment manager, and was overturned on appeal. It happened during a regular season game and not in 2 playoff games, and the rest of the organization cooperated fully after that initial snafu. At least, that's what I have gathered.   The pats cheated in a way that gave them a competitive advantage over a protracted period of time. It's easy to see that it could have helped them win the Baltimore playoff game. I remember the Pats receivers making some good catches late in that game. Skill sure, but a softer ball is easier to catch than a hard one, so I'd say it definitely had the potential to turn the game. One dropped pass, one flubbed throw could have cost them dearly.   And if you say there was no proof of deflation in the Ravens game, then why did the Ravens tip off the Colts about the balls?"
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,1 point,Tue May 12 05:20:10 2015 UTC,"I do believe Brady was in the know and probably the kingpin.  I'm just saying it's being blown way out of proportion by fans, the media and even the NFL.  I also don't think the punishment comes anywhere close to the crime.  If everyone really thinks a couple PSI's is the difference in a game then cool for them, enjoy 2-4 Bradyless weeks.  Don't forget we had a cheating scandal too. Yep Patriots receivers suck so bad they need soft balls to win, makes total sense.  It's not a QB preference, it's apparently a Running Back preference (others have said it causes less fumbles) and now the recievers like to catch soft balls.  So remind me why only Brady is getting suspended in what is now a whole team conspiracy?"
DenverBroncos,35n5so,leechsucka,2,Tue May 12 14:31:55 2015 UTC,"I mean if Brady cooperated they could have proven it to be a lie or not a lie. Brady was also assured his privacy outside of the relevant information would be leaked or violated. Brady flat out said he didn't do anything yet he was exchanging autographs to the equipment guys if I'm not mistaken.  The Chargers initially didn't turn of the towels but then THEY DID turn over the towels, Brady and Gostkowski refused to cooperate throughout the entire process.  So we have: 1.) Prior history of being guilty of cheating or bending the rules or taking advantage of vagueness in the rules which results in what is perceived in findings upon conclusion of an investigation to be conduct detrimental to the league. 2.) Brady straight up lied and said he didn't break any rules. The investigation concluded otherwise although the verbiage is disputed, however according to the CBA between the NFL and NFLPA the verbiage is legit. 3.) Brady failed to cooperate. This isnt the government its a business that he is contracted to and a part of a union therein. 4.) The entire franchise gets punished due to the actions of certain individuals that the management was unaware of but nevertheless the message is to the league clear: Follow the rules. Get your shit together, get your house in order because not knowing things cam still get you in trouble. Cooperate with the league.  Is it a shitty rule? Absolutely, but I agree with Jake the Snake on this... Doesnt matter if the rule sucks, don't break them. Bring up changing the rule in the offseason.  Did he break the rule? Honestly, and I hate saying this, but it doesnt matter because the investigation says it was more probable than not that he was complicit. Thats it plain and simple. Judgement delivered, appeal incoming. The appeal only applies to the suspension because the CBA is written the way it is written, and was —however unfair it may be, agreed upon by the owners and the players association. We can nitpick all we want but the proper channels to communicate this are already closed besides the appeal process which is limited by the cba.  I'm drinking and apologize for the tautological format of this response."

DenverBroncos,35n5so,leechsucka,6,Tue May 12 00:50:49 2015 UTC,"So Von got 6 games for weed, something completely external to the game of football.  Brady gets a smaller punishment for actually harming the integrity of the game."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,8,Tue May 12 01:05:29 2015 UTC,You're comparing two completely different issues.  Weed will get you fired at most jobs.  Von is kind of lucky it's only a suspension in the NFL (arguement of how bad a drug weed actually is aside).  I would agree the way they went about it is shady as fuck and they deserve punishment.  I feel this is highly disproportionate to the crime.  Lastly the inflation of the ball should be a wide enough range for player preference.  Imagine if all hockey players had to use the same exact stick.  Edit: Wasn't it 6 games because Von tried to fake the test?
DenverBroncos,35n5so,painaulevain,9,Tue May 12 01:11:28 2015 UTC,"It was 6 games because Von tried to fake the test. Von and Brady are/were both punished for what is basically the NFL's version of obstruction of justice because they either refused to cooperate with an investigation or they falsified an investigation, each act classified as ""conduct detrimental to the league.""  Von got more because he tested positive on top of it."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,-1,Tue May 12 01:51:53 2015 UTC,"Does anybody still have confidence in the leagues ""investigations""?  Remember Ray Rice?  Did Goodell forfeit any money on that one?  If you look at similar ball related cases the punishments do not match.  The Panthers and another team (can't remember sorry) were caught warming balls on heaters during a cold game.  Punished with a warning.  Chargers were caught rubbing balls with a towel that had an adhesive substance and didn't turn the towels over when asked (sounds like obstruction to me).  Punishment $20,000.  Not to mention the report cleared ownership and Bill of any wrong doing.  Which sounds weird when you hit said team with a 1 Million fine and take two draft picks on top of a 4 game suspension.  Edit:  I mean this is the same league that pretended to not know what happened in the elevator..."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,jussumman,0,Tue May 12 02:33:55 2015 UTC,"It was 6 games for a diluted sample.  You can get a diluted sample for drinking too much water, which is something athletes do.  So, ironically, the NFL has a policy that if the sample is diluted, it is ""more probable than not"" that they are trying to beat the test.  I still don't see how an event unrelated to football and harms no one, deserves a larger suspension than cheating at the game of football.  Your hockey analogy makes no sense, since the ball is something everyone plays with.  It is not player equipment.  That's like saying they can change the size of the puck based on player preference.  If the pressure in the ball weren't important, it wouldn't be in the rule book."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,2rio2,0,Tue May 12 14:19:37 2015 UTC,"I don't care about weed.  Smoke all you want.  Drug policy is another issue that is part of federal law. Personally I'd advocate no prison terms for it before I'd care about an NFL player missing some games, Bronco or not.    Bottom line, if this was anyone but Brady it wouldn't be this big of a deal.   Deny it all you want.  Before you argue the rest of the league are angels here's something to read, Broncos pop up on here twice at least by the way.  http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2015/02/04/if-the-patriots-cheated-theyre-hardly-alone/  Still a die hard Broncos fan, but people need to take a chill pill on this one.  Sorry my opinion differs from the screw Brady train.  Edit:  As for the hockey analogy, what touches the puck?  The sticks.  Are all QB's hands the same size?  Can we claim Aaron Rodgers gets an unfair advantage because his hands are bigger? In hindsight it's not a perfect analogy, but I stick by it.  The balls are not maintained at the same PSI through ought the game, they are checked before and that's it.  If it's a cold or hot game the ball changes on its own.  And a point I've made several times, if they can screw with the outside of the ball (which is allowed) whats the magical reason they can't screw with the inside? I have yet to hear a good reason for this beside ""it's a rule"".  Theres a yellow line outside the sideline that nobody is supposed to pass and every team ever does it and it's not a big deal, but it's a rule so let's start slapping some fines."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Tue May 12 16:18:41 2015 UTC,Deflating balls means no fumbles. Look at the 538 analysis. It's no secret the pats never fumbled
DenverBroncos,35n5so,TheClayroo,1 point,Tue May 12 04:11:59 2015 UTC,Then why didn't they suspend the runningbacks?
DenverBroncos,35n5so,TheGreatSpagett,0,Tue May 12 04:24:32 2015 UTC,"Agreed. Furthermore instead of punishment, I would suggest the NFL adapt the under inflated balls method (let any team do it) if it makes for better offense and less ""fumbles "". I would alter the stupid rule. There are a bunch of stupid NFL rules I would change and this is one."

DenverBroncos,35n5so,ezalbrozar,3,Tue May 12 01:09:05 2015 UTC,"Well from what I heard, he asked the equipment guy to deflate it from 16 PSI to around 12, the bottom threshold of the legal limit. I'm guessing he deflated a couple balls too much, but even then, there is no way that would have caused the Colts to lose as badly as they did.  I guess what I'm trying to say is that it might have had an effect on the game, but there is no way it would have been a big enough effect to swing the game the other game. The Pats could have won that game without resorting to cheating."

This is the narrative being thrown around lately, but there's not much to back it up.  People are taking the ""a couple balls were almost 16 psi"" from Jastremski's text as gospel, first of all.  Second of all, the balls were at 12.5 psi before McNally tampered with them in the game.  Why would he go and deflate them if they were exactly what Brady wanted?"

Either way, I'm glad the NFL stuck to their guns with this. People are bitching about Goodell and how Ray Rice was suspended less games, but they don't mention how the NFL changed their off the field conduct policy, and that this was an on the field matter which questions the legitimacy of the NFL. If Goodell did not lay the hammer down, it would further cement the narrative that the NFL is soft on the Patriots because Goodell and Kraft are good friends and that Brady is the poster boy of the NFL and is invincible, which is not an image the NFL wants to have if they want to promote their league as having the greatest parity of the three major sports."

DenverBroncos,35n5so,I_am_Mantis_Toboggan,2,Tue May 12 02:32:34 2015 UTC,I'm with you. I don't think a game saving interception or a blowout in the AFCCG are results of deflated balls. While I agree with the suspension and fine (2016 first rounder is a bit much) I don't think that Super Bowl 49 gets an asterisk.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,HyperMegaMuffin,2,Tue May 12 02:42:29 2015 UTC,"I actually agree with the entire punishment. But mostly because of the blatant cover up and the fact that my pats, are admittedly, repeat offenders. The ""cheating"" it self is equivalent to aderall or some pine tar at most. Spygate was worse in my opinion and I hope to God the recency bias of some fans fades. But hey, I an many other pats fans dealt with asterisks and you haven't won since cheating for 8 years now.

The deflating of footballs might not have mattered in the grand scheme of things, but if you want to end the culture of outright cheating within the organization, you have to lay the hammer down."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,travboy21,7,Mon May 11 22:11:03 2015 UTC,"Everyone is complaining about how steep it is, but I think the NFL is getting tired of these constant bountygate, deflategate, spygate and they're starting to enforce strict standards.  It's not about how what you did compares to what someone else did last year or the year before, its' about right now.  Teams are going to have to realize that doing these things to gain a competitive edge isn't going to be tolerated any more.  They have to weigh the risk with the reward and understand that the next team that does it might be the recipient of a larger punishment.  I worry the Broncos will do something just as stupid and get punished more severely."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,Hubnester42,2,Mon May 11 23:30:25 2015 UTC,Bountygate and Spygate were real reasons to get mad.  This is a dumb stupid rule that should be taken out.  Fans blew it up 😉 more than it needed to be.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,von_bot,3,Tue May 12 00:30:17 2015 UTC,Yes but I think they're trying to stop all of this by handing out larger and larger punishments.  Make the team think twice about how much they want to push the envelope.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,ThreezusManning,2,Tue May 12 00:45:45 2015 UTC,"That's why I don't like this one.  I feel like this is a player preference thing.  Yes they were shady as fuck doing it and sure punish them for that.  However take a look at the rule and how dumb it is, which they won't do now."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,mr_potroast,3,Tue May 12 00:49:33 2015 UTC,It seems to me that the Patriots could have gotten Brady to turn over his phone. I haven't heard about them particularly trying. That could have made a difference for them.

DenverBroncos,35n5so,Dude4445,12,Tue May 12 00:25:37 2015 UTC,"I understand plenty of the arguments that it's a harsh penalty for what was going on. It's true, a few PSI over or under isn't going to offer an advantage that would turn the tide of a game. But, that's not the point. The point is there was action taken outside of the rules in order to obtain a preference. That's cheating. But with the Patriots, it's just another symptom of the larger whole; the entire organization's attitude is to gain any edge, pompously, and they really haven't shown any regard for how they do it.   That being said, if we (and Manning, hell even Elway) were caught doing the same thing, I'd be disappointed in us/them. I'm not such a homer that I can't be objective to our players' actions. When Von screwed up the drug test, I was really peeved at him. I did NOT, however, push for a campaign to 'stand beside Von'. I didn't change my profile picture to Von's number as he struggled through his self-imposed troubles. I didn't go all #Vonisclean on social media. The general mentality of Pats fans is just abhorrent. If your guy is caught doing shady shit and your reaction is to blow it off, rationalize and support him, well...   ....Actually, that makes sense for the Boston sports crowd, now that I think about it. Maybe that's part of why I just really hate 'em."

DenverBroncos,35n5so,workaholicsbrah,11,Mon May 11 21:58:26 2015 UTC,The craziest part is that if the 4 game suspension stands they might end up out of the playoffs and lose a top 20 draft pick. That's crazy.   Most likely scenario without Brady is 1-3 in the first 4 (beat Jags). They have a brutal 6 game end to the season as well. I see them as 9-7/10-6 without Brady for 4 games.
DenverBroncos,35n5so,thekingearl,6,Mon May 11 21:56:14 2015 UTC,"They still won with Cassel, Don't know a lot about Garapolo (spelling?) but I bet they'll at least go 2-2 if the suspension holds at 4 which is unlikely in my opinion."

But, in three years Belichek will think it has all blown over again and feel that creeping voice telling him that he's the smartest guy in the room again.  He'll do something, get caught in a cover up and we will see the first lifetime ban in the NFL.

Surely the penalties are not harsh enough given that people from the Pats tried to give their team an unfair advantage to allow them to get to the Superbowl?  Being from the UK, and brought up with soccer, when teams cheat they are generally excluded from the competition. I've even seen a team thrown out of a major European Competition for fielding a player who was classed as not having served a ban, even though he missed the required number of matches but someone forgot to register him in the squad for the missed matches.   Is losing a first and fourth round draft pick really that huge of a penalty?"

(Nothing wrong with that, it's the same as Rodgers having his guy overinflating balls until the refs deflate it back to regulation.)  Now Brady said in a press conference that he didn't know McNally. Maybe he knew of him but he didn't know him personally. Maybe he knew JJ was giving the ball to some guy to inflate to a certain level before handing over to the refs.  Until it can be proven that Brady knew that this ""guy"" (McNally) was deflating balls AFTER inspection, i'm not convinced Brady did anything illegal.  I am open to changing my opinion of course if it can be proven with certainty."

I don't think you can say the nfl has an agenda or is unfairly targeting the Patriots. This is just the punishment that they think fits the crime after an exhaustive investigation. Complain about the severity of the punishment all you want but there is no anti-patriots conspiracy. And oh yeah LOL."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,AntaresDaha,-4,Mon May 11 22:22:07 2015 UTC,"Independent investigation, LOL."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,DrOddcat,2,Mon May 11 23:37:29 2015 UTC,"It'll be appealed down to two games I imagine, but losing the first rounder is great."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,indyxetan,2,Mon May 11 22:22:36 2015 UTC,"I really think the inflation itself is a non-issue. You throw in the past history, the non-cooperation by some people in the Pats organization and you end up with the league having to send a message. It is a stiff penalty, but they likely did that to send a message and will ultimately have it reduced.   I read that the NFL gave Brady numerous chances to 'safeguard his personal info' from his cell phone and he still declined to turn it over. That seems pretty bad, all things considered."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,njm1314,2,Tue May 12 01:14:27 2015 UTC,"Call me a party pooper, but I'm not really excited about this. Don't get me wrong, Brady deserved to be suspended for the ""obstruction of justice"" aspect of this case and I think 4 games is the right call.  But, I have a hard time celebrating the league office delivering karmic justice to the Patriots. I'd much rather see the Patriots be cut down on the field by another football team, than by Roger Goodell of all people.  And to the people saying this will cripple the Pats and they will not get a first-round bye or outright miss the playoffs, you seriously underestimate the power of the dark side and of Darth Belichick. Until I see otherwise, the Pats are the team to beat in the AFC if ANY team could handle losing their starting QB for 4 games (and I'm predicting it will be less than 4 by the time this is all said and done), it's the Patriots."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,breezyhamilton,1 point,Tue May 12 11:44:13 2015 UTC,"The picks are too much, and I hate the Pats. My guess they overeached so the appeal and arbitration end up being just the 4 games and lesser fine and maybe a few late round pics.   That being said I'm enjoying the schadenfreude on /r/NFL more than on the Pats. That sub really is showing how analytically poor it is once again."
DenverBroncos,35n5so,Hugo_Hackenbush,6,Mon May 11 22:20:52 2015 UTC,"I could be wrong but I'm I'm pretty sure the picks and fine aren't appealable, Brady can appeal the 4 games."

The league should have made a statement about what they consider a true (HoFworthy) sportsman, but ofc they can't risk losing golden boys PR impact.  I mean they either are convinced the Pats + Brady cheated + tried to hide it or they aren't, so you either punish so that it hurts/teaches or you clear them from the allegations, but this is just a jab against the organisation."

DenverBroncos,35hxym,bcos4life,43,Sun May 10 22:43:44 2015 UTC,"On the surface, John Fox looks like a good coach. I'll be the first one to say I did backflips when he came here.   I mean, he took the Panthers to the SB, and has a penchant for taking bad teams to good... but never great.  Last year made me lose all respect for him.  He went full retard on the RT situation, had no control on Peyton Manning's injury, mismanaged the Matt Prater situation, IMHO, and I think he mailed it in during the last few weeks of the season. I think he figured he was out, and his staff was gone, so they stopped giving their all. It was within HOURS of the Indy game, and his connection to Chicago was already being reported.   I think Kubiak is a major upgrade. He fits with the goal of our front office a lot more, I think. He also has that attitude that I think we need. Fox seemed to be afraid to upset people, I've heard that Kubiak is a rare mix. Players say he can be a real hardass, but they love him. Joel Dreessen, who played for both said that he liked Foxy, but would take a bullet for Kubes. Plus, our new Coordinators are head and shoulders better than what we had. Kubiak and Dennison won't screw around with Peyton. It will be professional, but not Adam Gase asking Peyton's permission on stuff. I love Peyton, but he needs to be reigned in occasionally, and Gase didn't have the pull for that. And if you think JDR is within 5 weight classes of Phillips, you are high. JDR didn't really blitz that much. He liked the idea of basic blitz packages and letting the coverage work. It did well, but mobile QB's with strong arms (Wilson and Luck) tore us up. They had too much time to develop routes and move in the pocked. The Son of Bum blitzes all GOD DAMN DAY!!!  I can see why people that aren't educated on the issue would see us losing those players would think they are big losses, but I see Pot Roast as the only loss that really hurt.  Julius wouldn't even make the field, except on obvious passing plays. Kubiak is old school, and won't fuck with a TE that doesn't want to block.  Orlando wasn't a good fit in a ZB scheme. He is mean enough, but agility is a lot more important in ZB.   Rahim is still untapped potential, IMHO. We are thin there, but he never lived up to what I thought he would be.  Nate Irving was the same way.   But the drafting of Shane Ray was huge. 3rd down is about to get hectic for opposing QB's."
DenverBroncos,35hxym,lsjunior,7,Sun May 10 16:06:05 2015 UTC,Not to mention Kubiak tailors the offense for each week and is creative. Seemed like Gase used all the tricks in his bag and ran out.  My biggest hate with Fox was lack of half time adjustments as well. The whole motto of itll work just execute better isn't always true.
DenverBroncos,35hxym,JamFlash,6,Sun May 10 16:37:43 2015 UTC,Also something worth noting is that Kubiak never had a roster as talented as ours. Look at his tenure in Houston. Even the year the texans went 12-4 (2012) he didn't have a roster as talented as ours. He was 61-64 with an expansion team. I have a lot of hope for this guy.

DenverBroncos,35hxym,Ezeran,4,Mon May 11 20:12:30 2015 UTC,I completely agree with Peyton needing to be reigned in. He's like an author who has got bigger than editors. Not necessarily a bad thing but could use someone who he's answerable too when he needs to pull in back in.
DenverBroncos,35hxym,peteisneat,2,Sun May 10 19:00:12 2015 UTC,"I also look at things like his clock management and his success rate for challenges. Fox had the worst challenge percentage until recently getting ""passed"" by Jeff Fisher. So Fox has more attempted challenges than anyone else and the second worst percentage. I think we all have our favorite Nonsensical John Fox Challenge at this point.  When someone is screwing up something as visible as that, it makes you wonder what kind of stuff is getting missed behind the scenes. I guess he was a good player's coach, but he just didn't come off as intelligent to me. (He's obviously an intelligent human being, but not when graded on the curve against other NFL head coaches)  Luckily, the Broncos hired a situational analytics guy this offseason. That might be our biggest signing!"

DenverBroncos,35hxym,Big_Pete1999,17,Wed May 13 19:06:32 2015 UTC,"The thing with the national media is this: They are very superficial on all teams not located on the East Coast (or Seattle and Dallas).  Ask these ESPN or SI ""experts"" any non-mainstream question about any team not mentioned above, and they'll struggle. They don't waste their time on getting in-depth on any team but the 6-8 that they know generate massive TV ratings (east coast/Dallas/Seattle).   So it's no surprise that they'd say the Broncos had the worst offseason (whether or not you agree). The point is that they simply don't pay any attention to us and a lot of teams, so unless there is a mega-blockbuster-HOF move happening, it will get ignored and swept under the rug and won't be included in their grades.   I remember a few months back when they had some free agent stuff going on and the needs of all 32 teams, they were talking about Broncos players that haven't played for the Broncos in 3-4 years as needing backups because they aren't getting younger. haha. I mean, C'MON. That's just lazy and embarrassing.  I said all of that to say this: If it's the national media, take 100% of what they say about Denver with a big 'ol grain of salt because they simply aren't paying attention to 3/4 of the NFL teams out there, so you simply can't expect them to know jack squat about our team or how it's going to operate."

DenverBroncos,35hxym,Big_Pete1999,16,Sun May 10 21:52:23 2015 UTC,"Wrong, they pay attention to Peyton Manning, NOT the Denver Broncos. Outside of Mark Schlereth, there's not a single person at ESPN or NFLN who could name each starter on offense and defense from last year. They couldn't name half of them actually.

More of the same.  The people writing these articles will be the same ones singing the praises of the head office if we have a good season.  Either their memory is short or they assume their readers' memories are.
DenverBroncos,35hxym,Puffy_Ghost,3,Mon May 11 13:57:50 2015 UTC,"Kubiak a downgrade? Lolwut? At least his staff has a pair between them collectively.    Our team for that past 3 seasons has been so safe and conservative, we'd end up losing games we should have won by 20 points.    Our off season losses are pretty replaceable, except for maybe Pot Roast.  He was a huge presence and is hard to replace, but I think if our linebackers can stay healthy we'll be just as good against the run.    Not to mention we'll be harassing QBs a lot more with Philips heading up our D.  Not seeing Von drop into coverage on 2nd and 15 or 3rd and 7 will be a good chance of pace."

There was a benefit to your muscles playing football in the fall, basketball in winter, and soccer in the spring because you moved differently in each and developed stronger as a result. But anymore if you excel at a sport you play that sport year round. Many well known doctors have came out against this, but I don't see it changing. It's a problem that's going to get worse."

A rookie is going to have a hard time getting down a peyton manning offense with all the adjustments you need to know. You saw it with Latimer last year who has insane ability but just didn't know what he was doing. Now the kid can focus on learning an offense without trying to break into a crowded position.

I don't think Heuerman was going to play this year and now his spot on the roster could go to a guy like Joe Don Duncan who has the potential to stick for 5 or 10 years as a fullback tight end hybrid who plays special teams.   If Duncan makes the team and can find a way to contribute we could have a solid group of tight ends for the future in Duncan, baby Gronk, and Virgil."

DenverBroncos,35gbhh,mysterious_pube,1 point,Sun May 10 02:13:10 2015 UTC,Any news or expectations on him this year?
DenverBroncos,35gbhh,CryBerry,3,Sun May 10 02:16:58 2015 UTC,He was in the position to be the return man last year.
DenverBroncos,35gbhh,NegativeGhostwriter,3,Sun May 10 02:18:48 2015 UTC,"We were all like, ""Damn, we got a punt returner..."" and then..."
DenverBroncos,35gbhh,mysterious_pube,3,Sun May 10 02:44:56 2015 UTC,"No news, but if Norwood has returned to form, I imagine he'll make the roster. There will be 2 or maybe 3 WR spots open, and one of them will almost certainly go to a punt returner. I'm not super familiar with all of Denver's receivers right now, but I think Burse, who was decidedly unimpressive last year, is the only other guy with significant experience returning punts. Unless Burse has made some big strides, he's probably not going to make it past Norwood."
DenverBroncos,35gbhh,Sienna_Crush,2,Sun May 10 02:35:21 2015 UTC,I expect him to actually be a decent WR/Returner contributer this year. It would be nice to have a guy with receiving ability (depth at least) and that can return balls for us effectively.

DenverBroncos,35db8f,PMeist,11,Sat May 9 06:54:08 2015 UTC,"Well, most of us have heard this one here, but what the hell it's an oldie but goodie:  On the first day of elementary school in San Diego a teacher decides to try and get the kids excited and build rapport by asking them, ""Who here is a Chargers fan?""  All the kids jump up and down and cheer, ""Yay,"" except for one boy in the back.  The teacher asks the boy, ""What's the matter? Do you not like football?""  The boy says, ""Oh no, I love football. It's just that my mom & dad moved here from Colorado so I'm a Broncos fan like them.""  The teacher says, ""Well you live in San Diego now. You don't have to be exactly like your parents. After all what would you do if your father was a drug dealer and your mother was a prostitute?""  Without missing a beat the boy says, ""Oh well then I'd be a Raiders fan."""

DenverBroncos,35bqzn,sev45day,63,Fri May 8 20:04:21 2015 UTC,I used to tell my coworkers this all the time. I accept that we lost to the seahawks but that ravens game i will never get over.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,TheLegendtaker,35,Fri May 8 20:38:49 2015 UTC,"How could they be so unprepared against the Seahawks though? I get they were the much better team, but damn if we didn't look like a bunch of lost boys since play #1. I also put a significant part of that on Fox."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,pham_nuwen_,10,Fri May 8 21:50:48 2015 UTC,"They said the Broncos practiced to hard leading up to the game. And didn't prepare for noise. Total management failure, maybe even from Elway down."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,detox101,6,Sat May 9 03:14:30 2015 UTC,That opening play safety killed our hype too and the Seahawks seemed to have the momentum for the rest of the game. If we would have scored something that first drive I think it would have been a different game
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Prez__Underwood,8,Fri May 8 23:25:05 2015 UTC,"I disagree. We were completely underprepared. Fox had piped in noise at his disposal for the week leading up to the game at practice and didn't use it because reasons. And it was a pattern, every single big game we failed in except for the Pats at home for the AFCCG but you just couldn't drop that one at Mile High."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,SmartToaster,5,Fri May 8 23:58:18 2015 UTC,"Fox just never had the killer instinct we needed from a coach. He coached like we were a team in the bottom 16 instead of coaching like we were the best team in the league. We were the team where the riskiest calls had the best chance but he always chose the safe road anyway. You don't stop betting with a royal flush in hand, ya know?"
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Coos-Coos,1 point,Sat May 9 03:16:20 2015 UTC,"This is usually what you get from conservative coaching. Safe decisions that usually lead to wins, no unecessary risks even when it could win you the game.  Rarely ever put our foot on our opponents throats, etc.  It was always disappointing to see us up by 30 midway through the third and watch both sides of the ball take the rest of the game off."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Puffy_Ghost,2,Sat May 9 19:20:49 2015 UTC,"You know, we actually should've lost regardless primarily due to the coaching. The only reason it was even close were those 2 return TDs. Those were gifts which kept us in the game, even the lead. It just saved Fox's job for another season"
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,clidetheglide22,11,Fri May 8 22:12:43 2015 UTC,Bullshit. We beat em 34-17 not long before that game...
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Corrupted_Engineer,4,Sat May 9 01:00:50 2015 UTC,"And we beat the Colts earlier last season & lost in the wildcard.  After those 2 return TDs which were unprecedented in the playoffs, we should've had all the momentum & killed them yet we didn't"
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,clidetheglide22,3,Sat May 9 01:29:31 2015 UTC,Also that obvious holding/pi missed call that ended up being a pick 6 for the Ravens. Ref sucked.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Royusmaximus,22,Sat May 9 02:33:19 2015 UTC,"I think Fox the guy is pretty cool, Fox the coach can get bent."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,flynryan692,6,Fri May 8 21:10:40 2015 UTC,"I think Fox a is pretty cool guy, eh loses super bowls and doesn't afraid of anything."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Crosshare,7,Fri May 8 21:26:32 2015 UTC,"Hindsight is if course 20/20. If he goes for it and we turn the ball over and they kick an easy FG to win, we are outraged. I know we will say now ""hey at least then we tried"" but we really would have been equally enraged."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,BroncoBuckeye,1 point,Sat May 9 01:02:09 2015 UTC,"No way.  Not at all.  I would not have been enraged in the slightest if he had gone for it and lost from a turnover.  No way would I have thought ""I wish we took a knee.""  It's a terrible decision.  It was a terrible decision when he did it.  We don't need hindsight to see that.  It was quite clear right when it was happening that he was blowing a really big opportunity.  Just statistically it's a foolish decision.  It's like you saying that we can't blame a coach for calling a QB sneak on 4th and 20.  It's objectively stupid."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Unrelated_Incident,1 point,Thu May 28 15:19:20 2015 UTC,"Hold on... not trying to score because you might make a turnover is asinine.   Manning had a interception percentage of 1.9% that season. You're looking at a maximum of 4-5 throws if you're freakishly quick. So, let's be devil's advocate and say that adds up to maybe a 10% chance of turning the ball over to the Ravens.  Field position might differ, but if you kneel, you are LITERALLY ACCEPTING a 50% chance that the coin toss will turn the ball over to the Ravens.   The most likely positive outcome? You win the coin toss and receive and get the ball right back at your own 20 (approx).  There was literally nothing to gain by kneeling, and an opportunity (we had f***ing Prater nailing long bomb field goals that year) was pointlessly lost.  It was inexcusable, but it was what Fox was going to do every time because he still coached like he had Jake Delhomme for a QB, and for the record, even if he did have Jake Delhomme for a QB, he should've been trying to score."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,YouAreSignedIn,27,Sat May 9 15:41:26 2015 UTC,"I think there's a general understanding, not just with the fans, but with the front office as well, that we could never win a Super Bowl with Fox. Elway built a hell of a team that could easily beat any team in the league if it was coached correctly. We had no excuses."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,natziel,9,Fri May 8 20:09:55 2015 UTC,Easily? Come on.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Doctor_Turtle,5,Fri May 8 23:48:03 2015 UTC,Easily. Obviously you have any given Sunday etc etc but the teams we have put together over the last few years have been absolutely ridiculous. You and I could have coached them to a winning season.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,SmartToaster,13,Fri May 8 23:59:27 2015 UTC,"No, the difference is I believe there are other really good football teams outside of Denver. To say we have the roster build to easily whoop all of them is silly."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Doctor_Turtle,2,Sat May 9 01:13:24 2015 UTC,"Not really. I mean, there are times when there are clear winners. '12 and '13 were definitely Denver years, especially '12."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,SmartToaster,15,Sat May 9 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"I gave Fox the benefit of the doubt a lot in his tenure with Denver, but this last season he just proved he doesn't have what it takes. The St. Louis game's play-calling was atrocious, I know Gase did the offensive play calling, but what kind of coach thinks ""Everything is going fine""? That play calling was worse than when the Vikings signed Josh Freeman, then a week later had him air it out 50+ times. JDR's fucking zone prevent obsession still pisses me off, the playoff game against the Colts was like going on a date with a girl who wouldn't stop talking about a certain ex. Yes, we get it, once the ex treated you right, and zone-prevent came up big to win a couple of games, but after a couple of mentions you've just got to say ENOUGH OF THE FUCKING ZONE/PREVENT HORSESHIT, TALIB IS GETTING BURNED BY HILTON EVERY DAMN PLAY AND THE ONE MAN COVERAGE YOU CALL WITH CHJ ON HIM, HE BATS DOWN 3 FUCKING PASSES. gah.

Then the Rahim play and the kneel down just about killed me
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Prez__Underwood,6,Fri May 8 23:27:26 2015 UTC,I totally agree that was our best chance to win another Super Bowl since 1998.  We had the best team and the rest of the league was way  softer than the years since.  Devastating.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Unfriedify,6,Fri May 8 21:07:14 2015 UTC,I put 2005 up there as well.  If our defense could've got off the field on third down in the AFCCG I don't think the Seahawks could've handled us.  Most balanced Bronco team I've ever seen.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Crosshare,7,Fri May 8 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"not only that,  but the same thing happened at halftime!!  Flacco launches some prayer to torrey smith to tie the game at 21.  There were two last minute TDs that never should have happened in that damn game.  aaarrrgghgh"
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,NiceSasquatch,4,Fri May 8 20:22:24 2015 UTC,"That's the weakness of a Fox led team.  That should've been a halftime adjustment.  When Flacco doesn't like the middle of the field he relies on his cannon ""Fuck it I'm going deep"" and it burned us twice in that game.  We never adjusted in game.  But then you look at the home opener the following season and the defense had that shit covered everytime.  We would apply pressure, or have everything short and medium buttoned up and he'd desperately launch the deep ball only this time they had two high safeties each time.    You have to adjust quickly in the NFL, not over an entire offseason."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Crosshare,1 point,Fri May 8 21:23:59 2015 UTC,He never adjusted period. There is onky ever one plan with Fox. Bend don't break what you see is what you get. We saw it in the Colts game when they didn't switch Harris onto Hylton.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,lsjunior,5,Fri May 8 22:08:21 2015 UTC,"The thing with Fox is this:  He's an AMAZING coach to take over a sinking ship of a team. He's the level headed presence that teams that are sinking need.  However, that's all he is. That's all he'll ever be.  Eventually, that team will stop sinking, and when it does, it will quickly outgrow the usefulness of a buoy.  That's Fox in a nutshell. He'll always be the bouy to stabilize a team, but never the coach to take that team any further than simply being competitive, and in a results based business like the NFL, that simply isn't going to cut it for long."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Fri May 8 22:05:48 2015 UTC,"I feel like he's probably really good at getting the team on the bus in a timely manner, running efficient practices, maintaining discipline without turning his players against him etc... but making in-game decisions, not so much."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,YouAreSignedIn,2,Sat May 9 15:46:05 2015 UTC,"If you asked him ""what in-game adjustments did you make?"", he's look at you with a confused look on his face and say ""in-game adjustments?""  On the outside, you'd think he's being snarky towards that question, but the brutal reality is that he has no clue what an adjustment is and he's trying to have it explained to him without sounding dumber than he really is.

DenverBroncos,35bqzn,pickup_sticks,2,Sat May 9 12:46:23 2015 UTC,"Compare it to the Seahawks in the NFC championship game last year. Green Bay was going to win that game, but the Seahawks never gave up and the momentum finally turned their way.   But even if they had ultimately lost, they turned in a gritty performance down the stretch. If they were going to go down, it was going to be kicking and screaming.   I never felt like Fox instilled that kind of attitude to the Broncos, and apparently Elway felt the same way."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,dragonbear,1 point,Sat May 9 15:11:39 2015 UTC,That was a strange game.  It's like the packers tossed the game in the 2nd half.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,caesarfecit,2,Sun May 10 04:44:20 2015 UTC,"Fox is the kind of coach you want when you have a mediocre/underachieving team and you want to them to make the playoffs. He's a player's coach and his schemes are simple but effective because they rely on raw ability rather than misdirection - he dares other teams to out-execute his.   Fox is not the coach you want when you have a contending team, a HoF QB who's on borrowed time, and management/fanbase that expect championships.. His teams aren't hard and hungry and they disintegrate when they hit their limits of ability or the team gets out-coached.   He's like an inverse William Bligh. Rather than expect too much out of his players, he doesn't push them hard enough or scheme aggressively enough to beat other contending teams. So they appear to be invincible against inferior teams and coaches and struggle against hard opponents. Unlike Bligh who lost his crew when they went soft, but saved his career by triumphing in extreme adversity."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,SirPhobos74,2,Fri May 8 23:28:42 2015 UTC,"Feel the same way.  The team that year was by far the best of the Manning era; plus, unlike the 2013-2014 team everyone was healthy.  That was also the coldest, longest, most miserable game I have ever been to.  There were also the shenanigans involving Ray Lewis doing more PED's than Barry Bonds to somehow miraculously recover from what should have been a season ending injury to play in that game.  I would have been perfectly happy if Fox had been fired immediately after that game."

He's not going to lead your team to a championship, but he'll never embarrass you and will help a struggling team get back to respectability. He's not the coach we need anymore. I appreciate all he did after the debacle known as the hoodie, but I'm glad he's gone."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,testreker,0,Sun May 10 15:08:54 2015 UTC,Why is one play more accountable than the next? Especially with the high level of risk (and the not so clean reputation of PFM in post season)

DenverBroncos,35bqzn,testreker,-1,Sun May 10 06:01:41 2015 UTC,"Where does that say anything about benching? I didnt forget what I said, youre just pulling out words that were never implied. PFM does have a rough past in post season, you cant argue that. Does that mean he should be benched? No, it means that both plays are accountable for their loss, hence the line previously stated that you over looked for the sake of an (poor) argument."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,YouAreSignedIn,1 point,Sun May 10 21:27:36 2015 UTC,"It was a mean-spirited jest, and let me explain how it works, since you are clearly not getting it.  You suggested something so absurd (that Peyton Manning's ""reputation"" implied some increased amount of risk) that I had to suggest something MORE absurd (benching him) in order to mock your statement.  We could debate what Peyton Manning's reputation really is and how it should affect in-game decisions another time, but only if you at least get which part of your statement I object to."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,testreker,-1,Sun May 10 21:43:30 2015 UTC,people that display sarcasm over the internet are so funny.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,YouAreSignedIn,0,Mon May 11 02:49:19 2015 UTC,"Not so clea... so, we're going to make the playoffs with him and then shut him down? Should they have benched him?   It doesn't matter if you have Tim Tebow in there. 30 seconds, 2 timeouts, possession and a big-time field goal kicker mean you try to win the game.   And what risk?!!?!? The risk of a turnover? Who cares? The odds of turning it over via coin flip are higher and guaranteed to happen if you kneel.   The Broncos scenario was so much more advantageous than a coin-flip and overtime, you try to score even if your quarterback is Norris Weese. You try to score if the score is zero to zero. You try to score if you can't even see the end zone through the snow. Because if you don't try to score, there's a 100% chance the other team gets a 50% shot at possession FOR FREE.  If you don't think you can set up a field goal with those conditions, why even show up to the stadium?"
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,testreker,-3,Sat May 9 15:54:57 2015 UTC,"Your over exaggerating the point. the OP asked why PM took a knee with 30 seconds left on the clock on the 20yrd line. No on ever said anything of benching anyone. Dont build a straw man.   All I am saying is its a reasonable decision. You want to play the hindsight game, be my guest but then why are you watching this sport?"
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,YouAreSignedIn,1 point,Sat May 9 19:55:54 2015 UTC,You're the one who suggested the Broncos pack it in based on Peyton Manning's reputation.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,testreker,-2,Sat May 9 21:12:53 2015 UTC,When did i say that? Never. I asked why one play was more accountable than the next.   Way to argue something that was never said.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,butthead_is_my_cat,0,Sun May 10 05:17:11 2015 UTC,Don't think I'll ever forgive Foxy for that one. The win streak had my hopes at a level I hadn't felt since '97. Such a letdown.
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,RPP_YeaYouKnowMe,0,Sat May 9 00:43:39 2015 UTC,"For me, that decision is the most painful Broncos memory in three decades as a devout fan. When it happened, I was totally confused. Taking a knee hadn't even crossed my mind as within the realm of possibilities. PFM had just driven down the crew for a crucial score on the last possession! With 2 TO's and Elam, I thought we had them right where we wanted them. This was the moment. This is when great players write their legacies...  The rest is history. It was apparent that Fox would never win a SB. And it stung even worse when the Falcons won their game under nearly identical circumstances. Because they didn't take a fucking knee."
DenverBroncos,35bqzn,YouAreSignedIn,3,Sat May 9 02:26:30 2015 UTC,Elam? Out of retirement? ;) Your decades are blending together.

You people are pathetic.  You want to down vote people when they have a valid point that isn't addressed, and needs to be considering the circumstances. Sorry it's not rainbows and lollipops people but that's not reality. So deal with it. Of the last 3 matchups with the Colts we are 1-2, they are in a cake ass division, with the second easiest schedule in the league, with every difficult game they have at home (Broncos, Patriots, Saints, and Bengals) and everybody thinks we will walk all over our schedule and walk all over the Colts. Unless you weren't paying attention the Colts STACKED that offense, and did a fair amount of work to fix their defense.   Odds are we won't have the 1 seed. New coaches, new schemes, combined with a top 10 difficulty schedule, along with how other teams are set up play against us. You can all say I'm not a real fan or whatever, but I'd disagree. A real fan doesn't become cocky, arrogant, and above all ignorant of facts and will address them."
DenverBroncos,35dw3m,Cynical_Doggie,2,Sat May 9 18:38:42 2015 UTC,"Hey man opinions are just opinions.  Personally I don't think Luck is consistent enough to post 13-14 wins (what i'm estimating it will take to beat us) and while they made some solid additions, I don't particularly think they're that good.  I'm not trying to smash on the Colts because I think they're an awesome team headed in the right direction, and there's no way they go beneath 10 wins. I just love what we've done with the team, last year we brought in the flashy talent, the skill we needed for a title. This year we brought in the grit, the hard-nosed, smash mouth players and system that almost any title team has had."

San Diego's most important position is played by a guy that has publicly said he doesn't know if he even wants to play for them next year. I think that could create a bigger issue than just with Rivers.  The Chiefs improved, but I think that we are still much better, and we got them early in the year, so it won't be cold.  Raiders."

He is still going to try to be as good as he can.  I also think the Raiders will be much improved, as in, like a 6 win season."

Our starting RT and top two receiving threats in Gronk and Edelman did not suit up. Our left guard was injured and we were trying out personnel in case Connolly would not be healthy for the post season. Also, half the starting defense sat out the 2nd half. Prior to that, the Pats dropped 40+ on them in Buffalo when both teams were healthy.  As for the week 1 game, I really don't know how that will go down if Brady is out. Big Ben and Antonio Brown will be tough to match."
DenverBroncos,35dw3m,JamFlash,4,Sat May 9 11:45:11 2015 UTC,"That's true, it seemed like by the end of the year Buffalo was a LOT better than what they were in the first matchup though.

DenverBroncos,35boj5,GamerTyke,5,Sat May 9 20:38:21 2015 UTC,"ENGLEWOOD – NFL rookies have to make sacrifices to get what they want. Even first-round draft picks.  For Denver Broncos linebacker Shane Ray, what he wanted was to wear No. 56 like he did as an All-American at Missouri. Problem was, a former undrafted free agent already owned it.  So he negotiated.  ""Shane gave me $2,000, nothing too big. Everyone else was talking about how he got first-round money, so I should charge him $20,000, but I'm not going to do something like that to him,"" said Broncos linebacker Shaquil Barrett, who wore No. 56 at CSU from 2011-13. ""If I wore 56 for a whole year and was actually playing, it would have been a little bit tougher.""  Barrett got his college number back two weeks ago when Reggie Walker offered to trade No. 50 with him, but after the NFL draft happened, he knew he'd likely have to give it up.  Barrett returns to wearing No. 48 like he did last season — fitting for a player out of Colorado State University. Legendary CSU athletic director Fum McGraw wore No. 48 as a player at Colorado A&M in the 1940s.  Broncos rookie minicamp, which Barrett is participating in, concludes Saturday.   He's wearing 56 like my boy Al Wilson, the greatest linebacker of all time."

DenverBroncos,35bk4u,thekingearl,4,Sat May 9 14:36:13 2015 UTC,"You may remember me from word clouds I made in every MLB, Soccer, NHL, NBA, and NFL team subreddit for their last respective seasons, or my Swears/Subscriber Breakdown by for states/cities/regional subreddits and my previous sports profanity breakdown. I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests, as the default /r/MUW bot does only a monthly breakdown, and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  To get at swearing frequencies, I took the raw data (including “the”, “and”, etc.), totaled all the words, and then added up all instances of swearing. Each category of swearing had several words that made it up, as the raw data does not differentiate between plural and singular forms. Common prefixes and suffixes were added. For instance, motherfuckers show up in the fuck category. The non-American category includes such words as twat, bugger, wanker, bastard, arse, arsehole, and shite. Genitalia includes cock, cunt, pussy, dickhead, tits, and cocksucker.  Words per subscriber were obviously obtained by dividing the number of words used by the number of subscribers to the sub and the subscriber counts were taken at the time my scan took place.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of other words, the top 500-1,000 words are included in the posts I made accompanying this year's word clouds."

DenverBroncos,35aegv,barnyardjohnny,3,Fri May 8 17:28:04 2015 UTC,Should be belichick IMO. He's the brains.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,von_bot,-1,Fri May 8 17:34:53 2015 UTC,Brady was the brains behind this. That's why we got caught.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,gakbds,0,Sat May 9 00:05:10 2015 UTC,I can picture BB spanking Brady with his belt for this failure.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,AdaAstra,2,Sat May 9 01:50:42 2015 UTC,"My qualm with it is that Von Miller got 6 games for weed and trying to pass his drug test for which we can all agree, weed is not a PED. Not saying his suspension wasn't warranted, but someone trying to knowingly cheat in a game (despite the outcome of it) deserves a less punishment than someone doing something that's legal in 2 of the states that the NFL has teams is asinine."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,gakbds,2,Sat May 9 06:22:07 2015 UTC,Looks like a Von Killer
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Afin12,6,Sat May 9 06:23:10 2015 UTC,Except the Patriots have been in trouble for cheating before.  Brady deserves suspension for this and it should be significant.  2 games is nothing.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Afin12,13,Fri May 8 16:44:18 2015 UTC,"Please, their cheating was about as much BS as our cheating. Hate the Patriots and Brady all you want, but this deflategate is probably the stupidest thing to call for someone's head over."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,gakbds,8,Fri May 8 16:58:00 2015 UTC,"They intentionally cheated.  No matter what the infraction was, cheating is cheating.  As for the Broncos cheating, there was punishment for it and it was significant.  If Brady is not punished significantly for directly cheating in a specific game, there is something wrong with the NFL.  The fact that Brady, specifically, was involved in the cheating, he should be punished greatly.  2 games is almost nothing.  Players get suspended for 1-3 games for a lot less.  He should not be suspended for any less than 5-6 games."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Malakiun,-2,Fri May 8 17:07:34 2015 UTC,"The rule book says the punishment for tampering with a game ball is $25,000.   So fine them $25,000 x 11 balls = $275,000."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Sect93,8,Fri May 8 17:53:01 2015 UTC,"But Brady with held info, and the Patriots denied multiple request for a follow up interview with McNally. To me it smells of a coverup on the patriots side. Plus all the shit he got signed by Brady is obviously a pay off"
DenverBroncos,35aegv,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,-15,Fri May 8 18:24:49 2015 UTC,"Obviously payoff, or a star player hooking up the team staff with sports memorabilia... which isn't that unusual."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Sect93,6,Fri May 8 18:34:03 2015 UTC,"Yea your right. ""That needel needs to be surrounded by cash and kick's"" sounds like hooking someone up."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,6,Fri May 8 19:21:14 2015 UTC,"Brady didn't tamper with any of the balls. He did, however, use the illegally tampered with balls in an official league game. That's cheating in itself. It has nothing to do with actually deflating the balls."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Sect93,2,Fri May 8 18:04:17 2015 UTC,"ROFL. Minimum of....  Also, second offense. Claiming ignorance by Belichick and Kraft should work though. Ignorance is a totally reasonable excuse, right Mr. Goodell?  Unless of course you play for a team that isn't the Patriots!"
DenverBroncos,35aegv,MyPasswordIs_Boogerz,-2,Fri May 8 18:01:15 2015 UTC,Lets talk about how Rodgers has admitted that he overinflates his balls? Why the fuck dont we have a inflate-gate with him too then? People hate Brady because he plays for the Patriots. Had he been a Texan or similar there would have come nothing out of this
DenverBroncos,35aegv,neuquino,3,Sun May 10 12:00:46 2015 UTC,"Rodgers inflates them, gives them to the refs to check, then leaves it alone.  The Patriots are accused of deflating the balls after the ref checked them.  I agree that this whole thing is kinda ridiculous, but how have you not realized the difference between what Rodgers admitted to and what the Patriots are accused of?"
DenverBroncos,35aegv,TheClayroo,-3,Sun May 10 12:41:13 2015 UTC,"Both are equal illegal no matter what. Either you strike down on both, or none"
DenverBroncos,35aegv,neuquino,7,Sun May 10 12:44:46 2015 UTC,"Situation 1:  Manipulating a ball beforehand then having a ref check to make sure it's legal.  Situation 2:  Having a ref check to make sure a ball is legal then manipulating it afterwards.  If you read closely, you may notice that those two situations are, in fact, not equal."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,TheClayroo,-4,Sun May 10 13:02:27 2015 UTC,"Rodgers OVER-inflates his balls. Thats still illegal, no matter what."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,TheClayroo,5,Sun May 10 13:10:10 2015 UTC,"He gets the ok from the game officials for each ball, then doesn't inflate, deflate, or do anything to them.  That means the balls are within the official standards when he's using them, which is not illegal.  Are you just messing with me, or are you really not understanding this?  Not sure if I can explain it any simpler."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,zpweeks,1 point,Sun May 10 13:49:13 2015 UTC,more than a 2-game suspension would be stupid as hell? Or Awesome as hell? I'd be ok with a 6 or 12 or 16 game suspension. Just to be sure everyone gets the point.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,zpweeks,9,Fri May 8 22:12:04 2015 UTC,"Meh, nothing will happen. We'll just get to call them cheats until Brady/Beli retire."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,neuquino,3,Fri May 8 14:13:55 2015 UTC,That's a pretty good perk to this whole thing. A nice cheap shot about them being cheats whenever I'm talking to a filthy patriots fan :D
DenverBroncos,35aegv,CapitalismIsGood,3,Fri May 8 22:10:36 2015 UTC,You're probably right about that. But I just have this feeling that with the fuck ups of late Goodell is going to do something stupid. I think he'll over punish Brady with a year suspension when it should be a couple of games.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,VGP_SC,7,Fri May 8 14:28:59 2015 UTC,"I could see him suspending for a year if it was Sam Bradford or another QB that wouldn't be missed but they could still set an example with, but I can't see the NFL's golden boy getting a year."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,ncmoreau514,0,Fri May 8 14:34:05 2015 UTC,No I agree with you. I'm just saying that Goodell has done some stupid shit with players suspensions before. Plus Goodell may also look at this as a way to try and win back some of the fan base if he does end up giving Brady a suspension for how ever long.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,shindigg15,1 point,Fri May 8 15:00:51 2015 UTC,That would be too sweet. Maybe just let the refs go easy on every NE opponent this year.

DenverBroncos,35aegv,shindigg15,0,Fri May 8 15:09:07 2015 UTC,OK I'll go with that. Let me just ask are you a Raiders fan? If so I'm OK with some fuck NE talk.

DenverBroncos,35aegv,YouAndMeToo,1 point,Fri May 8 19:39:58 2015 UTC,What I suggest is that if they can cheat then every team they play can cheat. I'm talking about 97 era NFL Blitz and guys on the sidelines listing to there play calls then sending them over. Also call all there penalties.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,0,Fri May 8 15:18:36 2015 UTC,I wouldn't mind a 1-year suspension for Brady. Honestly I think we should give the NFL sans-Tom Brady a try.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,6,Fri May 8 22:09:48 2015 UTC,"Surely spygate should be an aggravating factor when determining the punishment.  There is a history of organized cheating with that ""team."""
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,1 point,Fri May 8 17:23:42 2015 UTC,There is with many others. I don't think it should be taken into account with the punishment. Only the facts from the report should.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,3,Sat May 9 20:38:29 2015 UTC,"As a Broncos fan in New England, there is not much in this world that I hate more then the New England Patriots. They are cheaters and they are giant ass holes who I feel like everything goes there way all the time, on and off the field, when it seems like they dont deserve it. On top of that their fans are horrible, maybe some of the worst people I have the displeasure of talking to on a daily basis, calling me a ban-wagon ""Peyton follower"" because I like the Broncos, when I have been a fan since I was 5 (21 now). Also I feel like they should be punnished because they did cheat, altering the balls after the refs already set them to the legal pressure is clearly against the rules, and Brady obviously had a fairley large part in this scandle. That being said I dont think Brady DESERVES more then 2 games, but my severe hatred for that entire team and all of their fans still hopes to see more and I will be the happiest person in New England if that happens. Go Broncos and FUCK New England.  Please excuse any typos."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,0,Sat May 9 04:21:59 2015 UTC,"If the NFL just hands out a fine or a 1 game suspension, there will be a media shit storm calling the league racist for handing easy justice for white players or something like that. I just know there's going to be a media shit storm. If it's anything less than 8 games get your rain coats and umbrellas."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Malakiun,5,Fri May 8 17:20:19 2015 UTC,"Racist? I doubt it. It WILL call into question the personal relationship between Goodell and Kraft though, no doubt about that!"
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,1 point,Fri May 8 18:06:01 2015 UTC,well it would be something seriously stupid like that. The media is the pinnacle of stupid in america and they are probably going to twist it and turn it into something that stupid people will go nuts over. i would say that 75% of Americans are stupid enough to buy in.
DenverBroncos,35aegv,Malakiun,-15,Fri May 8 18:19:28 2015 UTC,"I mean....they have 6 SB appearances and 4 wins in Brady's time as a QB.  I'm not so sure they're all that sad about this little issue.  Go Broncos all day, e'r day, buuuuuuut Brady > Manning, and that's a fact."
DenverBroncos,35aegv,OldDirtyBuzzard,7,Fri May 8 19:47:19 2015 UTC,"I'll just keep rooting for my QB without wondering if he's cheated his entire career to look as good as he does.

DenverBroncos,359jbp,Occams_Lazor_,6,Fri May 8 19:22:41 2015 UTC,"Eh, I don't agree with some of his assessments on punishment. Don't think BB should be getting the fall for what Brady and the equipment guys probably did.  But as for his own experience with equipment guys and how they do everything the players tell them to...right on. I can't believe anyone out there can make themselves think that these guys did it on their own."
DenverBroncos,359jbp,ScipioAfricanvs,14,Fri May 8 16:44:10 2015 UTC,The NFL made it clear they will hold HCs responsible for the actions of their team when they punished Payton. Ignorance is no excuse to them because the HC should be in control of the team. Wouldn't be surprised if Bill got punished.
DenverBroncos,359jbp,detox101,3,Fri May 8 17:48:00 2015 UTC,"Ever watch the god father?  Keep friends close, keep enemies closer?  Never directly incriminate yourself.

DenverBroncos,359jbp,Sienna_Crush,2,Mon May 11 21:10:19 2015 UTC,"The only part of all this that I think BB should be held responsible to is that he sets the example to all his subordinates. All the way down to the the guys rubbing footballs for Sunday. When the Spygate incident came to light he sent a message to the team as a whole. ""I'm not above crossing lines to gain a competitive advantage."" And as for taking responsibility for that incident his explanation was ""I misinterpreted the rules."" Sending another message that excuses can justify the actions. He is arguably the man Brady looks up to the most and he did Brady no favors by setting a terrible example.   This may not warrant BB being punished a for ""sins of the father"" sort of thing. I just feel like his part in all this ties directly back to a mistake he made years ago in front of his team."
DenverBroncos,359jbp,Aremihc,2,Fri May 8 21:57:53 2015 UTC,"If they don't suspend Belichick, Then Sean Payton needs to sue them for lost revenue and defamation. They held him responsible."

DenverBroncos,359jbp,msipes,-4,Fri May 8 19:51:36 2015 UTC,"First off ..he needs to get that trash Ravens helmet off the bookshelf.  BRONCOS FOR LIFE!  Secondly, nobody cares about this BS TMZ-like news story... but the media & cowboy fans. Move along boys it's an irrelevant event. Every quarterback does things to the ball to give them better grip (ex: Brad Johnson in SB). They still have to throw the damn ball. That's like bitching about tackified gloves.  Let's suspend all the damn WRs why we are at it.  This shit is a none issue.  If Tom Brady gets suspended then they should suspend every NFL Quarterback in the NFL.  This is some bullshit witch hunt."
DenverBroncos,359jbp,Malakiun,5,Fri May 8 19:50:11 2015 UTC,"I don't think you watched the video. It's not the act, it is the intent. It is clear in the texts that they intentionally under inflated the ball for a reason. Just like Shannon said in the video, if it isn't a big deal then why is it in the rule book? They wanted to gain an edge to get to a Superbowl. The deflated ball did not make them win, they did that just fine, but they took steps intentionally to gain a small advantage. To top this off Brady did not cooperate with the investigation and he lied. If it isn't a big deal, why is he lying? Because it's a big deal."
DenverBroncos,359jbp,msipes,2,Fri May 8 21:14:58 2015 UTC,"Gotta love the ""Everyone else is doing it"" argument! It's been great to hear.  Let's say you're right. Everyone else didn't get their asses caught and try to lie their way out of it. In an NFL that's trying to keep as clean an image as possible, this can't just be forgotten about.  I guess, by your rationale, they should just send a press release to all teams and tell them to knock it off. Then they should slap another meaningless fine on the Patriots. You know, so everyone knows they mean business, right? That'll keep anyone else from trying to cheat their way to championships!"
DenverBroncos,359jbp,Fozibare,0,Fri May 8 20:23:25 2015 UTC,"I think that is an excellent argument.  Some people are calling it gaining an edge right?  If every QB in the league is doing it, then how is it an edge?    But regardless of that argument....I don't see anything wrong with giving the QB the ability to grip the ball better.  The real skill set is accurately throwing the ball to a WR while you have a 300 lb linemen running your ass down.    Why in the hell are we caring if its 1 psi off or if they scuffed marks into the leather so they can feel it with their fingers better?  This is no different as MLB taking new baseballs out of their boxes and rubbing dirt in them before a game.    What's next ...are we going to complain that LeSean McCoy has one extra spike on his shoe?  You still have to play the game ...and this type of non-sense has nothing to do with that."
DenverBroncos,359jbp,Aremihc,3,Fri May 8 20:40:30 2015 UTC,"I would be with Shannon Sharpe on this. If it's unimportant then take it out of the rule book.   As long as it's in the rule book, anyone trying to violate the rules for a competitive advantage should be dealt with very harshly."
DenverBroncos,359jbp,msipes,1 point,Fri May 8 21:20:31 2015 UTC,"Because everyone DOESN'T do it. Luck's footballs were properly inflated, and there has been no one else caught doing this. The league already gives about a 9% variance, taking another 20% is cheating.  Your baseball example is wrong. This would be like plucking the threads so they stand out more and give it more spin. Or putting pine tar on your fingers to get a better grip. The MLB would punish people for that."

DenverBroncos,3577vc,an_actual_potato,9,Thu May 7 18:33:50 2015 UTC,"He's a first rounder in any other situation (top ten by most mocks, even), the odds of him busting are not terrific, especially had we taken a cheap late round flier on him. What's pictured here is likely a motivational tool the coach used whenever a kid missed practice, I doubt he's actually a lazy POS."
DenverBroncos,3577vc,njm1314,3,Thu May 7 20:56:10 2015 UTC,"the odds of him busting are not terrific,    Are you nuts? First round draft picks bust all the time. Hell there have been a slew of them at O-line the last few years actually. Also let's not pretend that mocks really matter come draft day. TJ Clemmings was also mocked to be a first rounder. We can't really know where he would have been drafted. I'm guessing first round, but top ten, top twenty, etc... who knows?   Although I will point out that I never referenced this picture at all. It has nothing to do with what I'm saying. I'm amazed at how his maybe being a first rounder is treated as if the Cowboys had just gotten the best player ever, yet the Redskins also getting a first round OT isn't. That doesn't strike you as odd? The guy has gone from a potentially good player to a sure thing in a manner of weeks."
DenverBroncos,3577vc,an_actual_potato,7,Thu May 7 21:03:37 2015 UTC,"Sure they do, but the odds of them doing so are low enough that they justify the spending of a first round pick, a high one in this case. Thus is the nature of a draft pick, they are assessments of a players likelihood of success. Thus nabbing him for a 6th or 7th rounder (we had three of those, for God's sake) would have been a tremendous value. But oh well.  The way it's being treated is simply a matter of risk v. upside. They got a first round caliber player for essentially nothing, as a UDFA. Whether or not he pans out that's a terrific value. Sort of like if you get a super expensive raffle ticker for a flashy prize for free. Sure it may turn into nothing, but the value you gain by not having to pay the high price for the ticker is significant."
DenverBroncos,3577vc,njm1314,2,Thu May 7 21:11:45 2015 UTC,"I completely agree with you. He was a great value, of course that is true. None of that really addresses anything I was saying though. I never once questioned the value."

DenverBroncos,3577vc,Jake_53,0,Thu May 7 22:33:23 2015 UTC,"He's a right tackle only at the NFL level. He is shorter than the ideal tackle. He may need to move inside to guard. That would imply he's a bust.   This photo suggests that this kid doesn't have a great work ethic which implies that he could bust.   He is by no means a safe prospect, but this signing is by all means a great value for Dallas as it comes with what is basically no risk.   That being said, he would be a much better player for Dallas than he would be for us anyways. It's easier to play in between great players and Collins doesn't have great feet for a zone scheme."
DenverBroncos,3577vc,idgaf_neverreallydid,3,Thu May 7 23:36:51 2015 UTC,How does him moving inside to guard make him a bust?
DenverBroncos,3577vc,NiceSasquatch,-8,Fri May 8 01:27:47 2015 UTC,"he is being crowned as a first round pick,  that the cowboys got for free.  sure he could still bust.  he could still murder more pregnant chicks.  who knows."

Interesting thought."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Malakiun,3,Thu May 7 20:19:58 2015 UTC,I said this last night as well. It's unfortunate and I wish It wasn't going to be the case but I bet you're right.  Maybe a game or two?
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Jemma6,9,Thu May 7 18:46:13 2015 UTC,"I'm thinking at most 8 games, half the season, but more likely 4 games.  Kraft is too tight with Goodell for anything that would actually hurt the Patriots and their chances to make the playoffs.  I really want to see the ban-hammer thrown at Brady/Belichek, but I just can't believe at this point Goodell has it in him to actually do something meaningful.  Also, I think had the Patriots lost the Super Bowl we might actually have seen meaningful penalties, but with Kraft being so tight with Goodell, the Patriots being the defending champions, and Brady having 1-4 years left to play I just can't see Goodell doing something when he could, much more easily, just let it blow over and let Brady and Belichek retire in a few years.  But that track record though: Spygate, Hernandez, Deflategate, the whole offensive substitution thing with Baltimore, and other ""I'm smarter than you"" BS.... there has to be a tipping point where nonsense like this results in meaningful penalties for New England.  /endrant"
DenverBroncos,356jyl,DrOddcat,12,Thu May 7 15:24:13 2015 UTC,"I hope the league comes down hard on Brady and the Patriots for a second instance of cheating... That said, the way they've handled punishments for misconduct the last two years, I'll be surprised if the suspension is more than 2 games.  I personally think they are going to fine him, Goodell is too spineless to punish the golden boy."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Standgeblasen,13,Thu May 7 15:09:17 2015 UTC,"Yeah, 2 games (after appealing down from 4) sounds about right.    source: my ass"
DenverBroncos,356jyl,BornToulouse,18,Thu May 7 16:21:21 2015 UTC,Honestly the report has jack shit for proof. If he gets suspended I will actually be a bit annoyed that players can be suspended basically on assumptions
DenverBroncos,356jyl,AB444,13,Thu May 7 15:18:39 2015 UTC,"Circumstantial evidence is still evidence.   They don't have video or text proof that Brady told them too deflate the balls. But they have texts of the guys talking about Brady instructing them to make sure the balls are low like he likes it, the guy calls himself the ""deflator"", mentions that he's not going to ESPN ""yet"", Brady calls the guy for 40 minutes a day for like a week after not talking to him over he phone for 6 months, invites the guy into the QB room to talk with him for the first time ever after the allegation broke, texting him to see how he was holding up, to which the guy replied he was nervous but okay...the entire picture is very damning in my opinion. All they don't have in there is a text from Bray telling him to do it, and they don't need it."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Occams_Lazor_,3,Thu May 7 19:38:57 2015 UTC,"Big Ben, Greg Hardy. There's been others."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,drax117,6,Thu May 7 18:46:55 2015 UTC,Goodell has brought the hammer down with a lot less evidence than there is here in the past.
DenverBroncos,356jyl,AB444,0,Thu May 7 15:21:40 2015 UTC,"When exactly? All I can think of is the AP case and the Ray Rice case, but both definitely had concrete evidence before the suspension. And AP voluntarily went on the exempt list.   (I actually would like specific examples, not trying to be a smart ass)"
DenverBroncos,356jyl,AB444,10,Thu May 7 15:24:14 2015 UTC,Big Ben immediately comes to mind.
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Buggie111,2,Thu May 7 15:26:10 2015 UTC,"Not sure how I missed that one. Looking back though it seems odd how Ben and his representatives acted fine with the suspension and basically gave up trying to fight the suspension altogether, and settled for trying for only 3 games. It seems almost like an admission of guilt.  Brady almost certainly asked for air to be let out of the balls. But he could have only wanted them at the lower legal limit. There's nothing that proves or even directly implies that he wanted the balls to be illegally under inflated.   I hate the pats as much as the next guy, but I just think this is way overblown and overhyped and it kind of comes off as whiny and looking for excuses. That's just my opinion."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Buggie111,15,Thu May 7 15:39:44 2015 UTC,"The issue is that there is circumstantial evidence that they were fucking with balls after they had been cleared by refs (see page 76 of the report). Even if they were deflating to lower legal limits, you're no allowed to touch them after they've been cleared by officials."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Sienna_Crush,-8,Thu May 7 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"Even if they were deflating to lower legal limits, you're no allowed to touch them after they've been cleared by officials.   Ok, that's illegal, obviously. Brady deserves a 1-2 game suspension. But would you call that ""cheating""? If you are told to take a ten page test, and are handed a booklet with only 8 pages, is it cheating to walk up and grab a ten page booklet without doing anything else? Because that is analogous to what Brady knew about and ordered done in this situation."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,elcalrissian,5,Thu May 7 22:27:47 2015 UTC,"Why does nobody get this? Brady is not going to be punished for deflated footballs. He's going to be punished for obstructing a league sanctioned investigation, a major violation of the CBA."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,AB444,3,Fri May 8 07:19:47 2015 UTC,"Yes, correct (I thought I mentioned that).  He didn't cheat, but he is a lying asshole."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,elcalrissian,6,Fri May 8 14:32:52 2015 UTC,"Another major issue is that the guy doing the supposed deflating has no reason to ever be adjusting the ball pressure.  ""All of the Patriots witnesses interviewed stated that McNally has no role in the process of preparing footballs for use on game day."" p.47  So even lowering them to legal minimum by this guy is wrong in addition to tampering with them after the official's examination.  Brady clearly knew about this guys involvement in altering the footballs from the text conversation.  ""Talked to him last night. He actually brought you up and said you must have a lot of stress trying to get them done..."" Jastremski about Brady p.9  So yeah it doesn't prove he wanted them under the legal limit, it's just strange that the Official's Locker Room Attendant is talking about adjusting the ball pressure with the clear knowledge of the Patriot's Equipment Manager and likely knowledge of Brady (based on the text).   I don't have a problem with the deflating as much as I do the lying and the deception. That's what bothers me."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,AB444,4,Thu May 7 21:36:25 2015 UTC,All I can think of is the AP case and the Ray Rice case   You thought of 2 in 1 year.  That isnt enough evidence of what Godell will do I dont know what to tell you.
DenverBroncos,356jyl,elcalrissian,3,Thu May 7 15:33:05 2015 UTC,"The difference is Ray Rice admitted to it and there were pictures of the child in AP's case. Not to mention AP's punishment was self imposed, even if his understanding was that he wouldn't be ""suspended"" for the entire year.  I don't think the cases are even close to the same, but you are free to have your opinion too."

DenverBroncos,356jyl,Occams_Lazor_,2,Fri May 8 00:25:10 2015 UTC,"As a note - almost all things you mentioned are situations outside the NFL. They are infractions on conduct sure, but have nothing to do with the actual game. I think the NFL has to be harsh in whatever ruling it does to prevent other teams/players cheating. If Brady at all aided in deflating the balls, he cheated to gain an edge.   You have to come down harshly otherwise what's to stop everyone else from doing it? If they only fine Brady, then the message the NFL sends is it costs $X to cheat. If they suspend players, there is a much deeper ramification and risk/reward for attempting to cheat.   I am sure Pats fans, and other Brady fans will defend Brady til the end. The evidence is somewhat circumstantial, but it really makes it look bad for Brady. Based on the investigation, he deserves a punishment."
DenverBroncos,356jyl,-R3DF0X,3,Thu May 7 19:42:51 2015 UTC,I'll be surprised if he gets anything over a 2 game suspension.
DenverBroncos,356jyl,_swifty_,3,Thu May 7 16:39:41 2015 UTC,"Had this been a regular season game, and the Pats not won the Superbowl I'd say a fine and 1 game max.

DenverBroncos,356jyl,ogre13,5,Thu May 7 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"10 games is unbelievably absurd   Yeah, I doubt it would be 10.  Most likely 1 game at the most.  Probably will slap them on the wrists with all their precious 7th round picks next year.  Ouch Mr. Goodell.  That will show the Pats never to cheat again.  Not.    PS:  The Pats will cheat again at some point.  Why not?"
DenverBroncos,356jyl,Occams_Lazor_,3,Thu May 7 18:31:39 2015 UTC,"I would hope that's why the NFL is considering at least a moderate punishment for Brady/Organization.

To be honest, he did say several times that this was HIS opinion based on career, and seeing as Chris Harris (who btw is my favorite player in the league) has just begun flourishing he really can't be compared.  Can't blame people either as he is not covered as highly as those two and really gets no media push to help so its an unfair question for anyone who doesn't know many of the ins and outs of the league. Its almost like Vontae Davis, everyone knows he is good, but he gets forgotten in the crowd because he goes about his business."

DenverBroncos,356mr6,Big_Pete1999,8,Thu May 7 19:39:53 2015 UTC,"I think at this point, his agent screwed him.  From LSU coaches and teammates, La'el is a great teammate and hard worker. He struggles in the power scheme, but hey, the Broncos will run a zone scheme. He'd be a perfect fit, especially seeing we have 3 positions up for grabs with zero proven guys competing for them.  The problem, however, is that his agent totally screwed him when he said if he wasn't drafted day 2, to take him off the boards and he'll just re-enter the draft next year. That is a MAJOR RED FLAG. It wreaks of ""attitude problem"", ""authority problem"", and ""won't work hard because he's butt hurt"" problems. Whether or not any of that is true, that's what that statement makes people believe.  So now teams have to ask themselves a very real question, and that question is this, ""Will La'el Collins try to work hard, learn playbooks, and be a good teammate for undrafted college free agent money?""  That is the question, and that's why all 32 teams aren't in a huge race to sign him. It's why only 2 teams are pursuing him... 2 desperate teams mind you. Desperate times call for desperate measures, and signing a player who said to not even attempt to pick him up if you didn't do it in the 2nd round wreaks of desperation.  That's why Elway isn't pursuing him. Should Elway pursue him? I think so, but again, La'el's agent majorly fucked him. Now he'll be forever looked upon as being a player who is only in it for the money and a crybaby. No team wants a crybaby who will only try if he's one of the highest paid players (Haynesworth comes to mind)."
DenverBroncos,356mr6,Big_Pete1999,5,Thu May 7 15:46:23 2015 UTC,"The Cowboys are pursuing him, and they're definitely not desperate.  I believe this gives him incentive TO work hard, because regardless of what he does he's stuck at where he's at.  The only way to get the payday he wants is to prove he can play.  He knows that and he obviously wants the money."
DenverBroncos,356mr6,fthflyer,3,Thu May 7 15:50:51 2015 UTC,"if he wasn't drafted day 2, to take him off the boards and he'll just re-enter the draft next year.   This was a major screw up, because I'm pretty sure you can only re-enter the draft next year IF you're drafted. So theres a possibility that he won't be able to re-enter in 2016  http://mmqb.si.com/2015/05/02/lael-collins-2015-nfl-draft/"
DenverBroncos,356mr6,Big_Pete1999,2,Thu May 7 16:59:12 2015 UTC,"I've read in multiple places that he can't enter next year. It's a way of keeping players who weren't drafted where they wanted to be drafted (or not drafted at all) from holding out and re-entering next year and hoping for a better outcome.  So yeah, he's not eligible for the 2016 draft and he's not eligible for the supplemental draft this year. He royally screwed up by having his agent say that and him going along with it. Could be career suicide."

DenverBroncos,356mr6,lojician,3,Thu May 7 20:04:20 2015 UTC,"His choice seems totally reasonable to me. He knows what he's worth and he's unwilling to roll over and be forced into years of a sub-par contract for something he didn't do. There's a difference between having a problem with authority and having the balls to do what's best for yourself in a straightforward, honest way.  Telling teams not to draft him is actually doing them a favor. It would be easier for him to just refuse to sign and automatically reenter the draft next year as has happened before. Instead he let them know not to waste a pick on him. This is the best way he could have handled this given that he's not willing to risk his career playing for years below his market value.  I'm disappointed the broncos aren't attempting to go out and get him but can't win them all I suppose. I really hope this has nothing to do with the recent penny pinching."
DenverBroncos,356mr6,Big_Pete1999,2,Thu May 7 15:57:24 2015 UTC,"While I agree that he was trying to do what is best for him, it came off completely wrong.  I was all for drafting him in the 2nd round. I begged for the Broncos to draft him. They didn't.  Players re-entering the draft after taking a year off NEVER works out well. Maurice Clarette comes to mind.   Besides, the only reason he's now ""open"" to being signed is because he isn't eligible to re-enter next years draft. So he either signs with a team right now, or he never plays in the NFL and goes back to LSU to get his degree and use that education for a career outside of football.  Again, his agent screwed him."
DenverBroncos,356mr6,TheClayroo,2,Thu May 7 16:13:05 2015 UTC,The max he can sign for now is 400k at 3 years with 10k max guaranteed. The bonus for him over other rookies is he can renegotiate after two years instead of three. His best bet now is to get on a team that will make him look good for two years and work his ass off the the next big contract.

While we have a lot of competition for our offensive line, we still do not have any top tier talent outside of Clady and Vasquez which makes someone like La'el slip by even more annoying.

OL is not our problem anymore, Elway and Kubiak addressed it head on in the draft.   I urge you to look into La'el Collins some more, as everything about him is the opposite of an Elway player. He has extreme character questions, he does not work hard, and he does not have the desire to improve either of these issues. His talent is undeniable, but he will never play for Elway. Not to mention Peyton would eat the kid alive."
DenverBroncos,356mr6,Gtownbadass,6,Thu May 7 15:37:39 2015 UTC,"Point taken.  But I'll take my chance at ""character issues"" with top talent for 400k a year any day.  If he ends up not working out worst that happens is he ends up 3rd stringing it with minimal pay."

Haynesworth was a problem because he sucked up $120m in cap space. For the minimum, isn't anyone with talent worth a shot?

DenverBroncos,3570s2,aatencio91,5,Thu May 7 17:09:23 2015 UTC,"I'm telling you all right now, it has to be either Malik Jackson or Marvin Austin.   No QB wants pressure up the middle. They'd rather have pressure around the edges (Von, DeMarcus, Shane) which enables them to step up in the pocket and let the ball fly. It's when you collapse the pocket from the middle that you cause all of the mistakes by QB's because they can no longer step up in the pocket and typically, they can't move around in the pocket because the edges are crashing down on them anyways.  The key will be Malik and Marvin. They have to step up big.   I know it's popular to say Sly Williams, and hey, he might very well fit the role, but I've been overly disappointed with Sly and overly impressed with Malik and Marvin. That's why my money is on those two over Sly.  GO BRONCOS!"

DenverBroncos,354ok5,MuzzEmil,0,Thu May 7 20:44:02 2015 UTC,"Besides the fact that Sanders beats Edelman in every statistics category, Edelman is not more versatile as a receiver in the slightest. The only thing edelman is better than sanders at is punt returns. which isn't even true because Sander's took 1 punt return and got 11 yards. Edelman's average - 11.96   Sanders is 4th in yards per catch at 13.4 ; Edelman is 10th in ypc at 10.7,  Not to mention Sander's is 5th in total yards all while not being the  No.1 receiver."

Edelman isn't bad though i think he's was 10th in yards per return."
DenverBroncos,354ok5,shindigg15,2,Sat May 9 03:10:19 2015 UTC,I think Edelman is a pretty good punt returner.  I think he was the top rated on in 2013? I don't remember but hes solid.  And I don't think he should have cracked the top 100 but you can't say hes not a good receiver.  Hes really scrappy and has great hands and overall athleticism
DenverBroncos,354ok5,ktsmyth,1 point,Sat May 9 04:19:02 2015 UTC,"Nothing you said even disproved my statements, it was just some random cherry-picked stats. And even still, stats are NOT the end-all-be-all to determine what player is better.   Edelman is more versatile because he lines up everywhere and runs all kinds of routes. Sanders mostly lined up outside (on the right) and ran go's, posts, and outs. He did great at it, but thats all we really saw out of him.   Sanders doesnt return punts.. probably because he isnt that great at it (God knows we needed someone who is). Edelman does, because he is REALLY good at it.   So yeah, you are incredibly biased. I dont think Edelman is leaps and bounds better, but its closer than you are suggesting, and I would take Edelman purely for his return ability."

Let me put it this way: Patriot fans will claim Brady didn't cheat or even attempt to cheat with deflated footballs.... 31 other teams and their fans are screaming that they did cheat.  I'd like to think if I were a Patriot's fan, I'd say Brady cheated. Does that mean other Patriots fans would call me an asshole? Probably. Does it mean I'll get negative karma? Absolutely.

Pretty good clubbing to be had at Beta (next month they have Mat Zo, Savant, Paul Oakenfold, and A-Trak on the schedule if you're an EDM guy) or the Church (less big names but an interesting venue because it's a church that was repurposed into a nightclub).  Tooooons of good breweries around town.  Definitely have a stroll around 16th St. Mall, lots of cool shops and a very unique atmosphere.  You can watch a Rockies (baseball) or Rapids (soccer) game next month.  Looks like Taste of the Broncos is going on next month, as well as a Rugby 7's tournament.

Also there is a live bison herd on the way in, which is usually within sight.  Not quite as cool but still neat is the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Nature Preserve.  This gives you much more of a sense of the feel and wildlife of the Great Plains, there are some nice walks, and the museum there does a good job of displaying both the local wildlife and the history of the location as a massive arsenal for weapons of mass destruction during the Cold War.  Food:  ""wild food"" at the Buckhorn Exchange or The Fort; many good local Mexican, Ethiopian, Korean, and Thai places; Pete's Kitchen, Sam's, or Breakfast King for good ol' American style breakfast food; Capitol Grille if you're up for high end stuff with a Denver twist.    Day Out:  Just east of Downtown is City Park, within which are nice little walking paths and the Denver Museum of Science and Nature, which is like most museums of that genre, but has a few exhibits here and there that are pretty unique.  It's from this place that you can catch a view like this.  Like many here, I also recommend a jaunt to Boulder, for all the reasons listed."

Here are my recommendations:   Tour Mile High Stadium (I did one for Levi's Stadium a couple weeks ago and was worth it) Walking brewery tour of Boulder is always cool. Hiking is really good to do when you're out here. There's a lot of trails. Walking the 16th Street Mall is always a blast for out of towners.
DenverBroncos,353yl9,sgrace_wrk,1 point,Wed May 6 22:38:15 2015 UTC,I would love to tour mile high. It will be my wife and I and a few of our friends so if I can get all of them on board that would be great! We've already talked about 16th St mall which sounds like a blast and as far as hiking I think they want to head to Estes Park. Nothing is set in stone though so I appreciate the help! They've also talked about doing a tour of the coors brewery. Would it be worth it to do that?

DenverBroncos,353yl9,g-burn,2,Wed May 6 23:33:43 2015 UTC,The way it sounds we might be taking a day to go to Estes Park for some hiking. I will keep this in mind.  Thanks!

DenverBroncos,353yl9,NegativeGhostwriter,2,Wed May 6 23:46:04 2015 UTC,"Just a heads up about the Estes area. Lately, we've had a lot of rain here in Denver which means Estes Park and RMNP most likely got hit with a good amount of snow. If you're wanting to hike out there, plan accordingly."

DenverBroncos,353yl9,rckymtnclmbr,1 point,Thu May 7 18:44:54 2015 UTC,"Not so much the temp although it is a good idea to layer up. It might actually feel surprisingly warm in RMNP. The biggest obstacle is going to be the possibility of trails being covered under many feet of snow. Many trails may require snow shoes, gaiters, trekking poles, and MAYBE crampons or microspikes. Also keep an eye out for avalanche reports. Warm weather, followed by lots of snow, followed by another warmup can make certain areas dicey. I would really advise against high altitude hikes, like Chasm Lake, this time of year unless you are experienced."

You can get a good view of RMNP off in the distance and a good view of Indian Peaks Wilderness as well.  It should be real pretty right now. Eldorado Canyon State park is right up the road from Golden and its pretty amazing too. I am partial to it since I love to climb there, but just for hiking around its still pretty amazing."
DenverBroncos,353yl9,wefr5927,3,Thu May 7 14:42:34 2015 UTC,"Check out Lookout Mountain - it's pretty close to Golden, and there is great hiking up there.

Also I'm going to echo everyone's recommendation here - Estes Park is amazing, and the drive through Rocky Mountain National Park is not to be missed!    If you had more time I would recommend Garden of the Gods down in Colorado Springs, but it doesn't sound like you will have time to get down that way.  Maybe next time you can check it out.

DenverBroncos,353yl9,TwinMonkeys,2,Wed May 6 22:43:29 2015 UTC,The Dark Horse looks awesome and I'm always a sucker for beer and burgers. We may have to head to Boulder if there's that much to do. My wife is a tea fanatic so that may be the selling point.  Thanks for the help!
DenverBroncos,353yl9,NegativeGhostwriter,3,Wed May 6 23:05:20 2015 UTC,"No problem. You'll have a day's worth of stuff here:   Celestial Seasonings Pearl Street Mall (get lunch here somewhere- if you like Chipotle/Qdoba I recommend Illegal Pete's, but there's tons of variety elsewhere on Pearl Street, from Falafel to pizza) Chataqua Park/Flagstaff Mountain (Chataqua is right at the foot of Flagstaff so a quick drive up the mountain for the view of Boulder from the sunrise amphitheater is worth the it) do your hiking around Chataqua as it's fairly pretty and a bit lower than Flagstaff so it'll be easier on your body given the elevation change. An alternative to Chataqua is to hike around NCAR (ENCAR?). It's easily accessible and probably prettier than Chataqua, IMO. Dark Horse for dinner/beer"
DenverBroncos,354ncy,DaBears31,16,Thu May 7 01:53:15 2015 UTC,"You'll see an offense that plays it safe when it gets up by 3.  ...actually, I'm excited to see you guys play this year.  It'll help us see just how much of Gase and Fox' success was because of Peyton and how much of it was them being Head Coaching material.  That said, I still really like John Fox the person.  He's awesome, laid back, hilarious.  All around good dude.  Good luck this year!"
DenverBroncos,354ncy,indyxetan,3,Thu May 7 01:58:48 2015 UTC,"Huge fan of Cutler. Love him   I was really hoping Shanny would go to Da ChicÄgo Beers and get the gang back together.  Call Royal for a 3rd WR, already have DJ, see what Ian Gold and Nick Ferguson are doing.  Maybe Ashley Lelie and Ruben Draughns are dtc? Actually I'm not sure what I'm talking about anymore.."
DenverBroncos,354ncy,thereandbackagain7,2,Thu May 7 03:22:07 2015 UTC,hire Shanny?  Bears management isn't that smart
DenverBroncos,354ncy,waspocracy,3,Thu May 7 04:21:34 2015 UTC,"Conservative.  Honestly, you should be more happy about Fox's ability to find talented players. He has a strange ability of grabbing athletes no one has heard of and turning them into elite athletes. On the other hand, people who have a lot of potential don't really get playing time until the ""next man up"" philosophy comes into play. Expect players to impress you in the preseason and never see them again until a player gets injured (even then is questionable) or after they're sent to free agency.  Fox plays a conservative game. In some ways this is good. If it works as planned then the offense will stay on the field and the other team's defense will get tired. A lot of running and quick throws. The problem is he can't adjust games if it isn't going his way. You witnessed this in the last Broncos' Super Bowl, and their last playoff game against the Colts last year.   One thing you can expect is a good defense. You guys have a good coordinator already and Fox is a defensively-minded coach. But again, it will be conservative. If a team find a loophole during a game they will latch on and embarrass you.   As others have stated, don't expect huge ""HOLY SHIT"" plays at all."
DenverBroncos,354ncy,ThreezusManning,5,Thu May 7 22:59:28 2015 UTC,"It's not a popular opinion around here anymore, but I think Gase is awesome. He'll fit the offense to what you're best at, so probably more Forte than in the last couple years. Its kind of hard to say what it will look like since we were in a unique situation with Peyton, but he really showed last year with the emergence of CJ that he could adapt to the situation at hand. We ran a lot of screens and rub-routes and then would throw out the long ball once the defense was tired out. As for the run game, nothing too innovative. Between the tackles, and some counters and sweeps. As for Fox, he's mostly a defensive coach so his involvement in the offense is minimal."
DenverBroncos,354ncy,barnyardjohnny,2,Thu May 7 02:01:53 2015 UTC,Isn't Marshall on the Jets now? I'm intrigued to see how Gase and Cutler get along. Maybe the more interesting relationship to watch is Fox and Cutler. I'd like to see Jay do well but he's not a popular figure according to most Bears fans I know.
DenverBroncos,354ncy,SonicSC,1 point,Thu May 7 04:23:51 2015 UTC,"The Fox/Cutler thing is definitely what intrigues me most about the Bears this year. If Fox can settle Cutler down and they go to the playoffs, I'll be somewhat surprised but very impressed by Fox."
DenverBroncos,354ncy,sgrace_wrk,2,Thu May 7 10:43:09 2015 UTC,"You should really ask Panther fans about Fox...  Cause the way he coaches is:   Don't ever let rookies play if they're on offense Gase/QB will draft up some good plays, but put most of the pressure on the QB. Conservative play calling when up."
DenverBroncos,354ncy,MTLBroncos,2,Thu May 7 13:17:38 2015 UTC,Gase and Manning drew up good plays. I don't think Cutler will have too much of an impact on that
DenverBroncos,354ncy,sgrace_wrk,-1,Fri May 8 16:51:35 2015 UTC,Very true... I'd rather have the kicker be the QB over Cutler.
DenverBroncos,354ncy,crueg,2,Fri May 8 19:19:57 2015 UTC,"Fox gets a lot of shit around because he's ultra conservative as a coach. I think he'll improve the Bears, and maybe after a season keep you guys as playoff contenders, but nothing more than that. Oh, and get used to 488 screen plays each game."

DenverBroncos,3571o0,Greeney494,3,Thu May 7 17:37:15 2015 UTC,"That a player would risk millions and millions of guaranteed money just to fall in the draft and HOPEFULLY get drafted by the Broncos. 23 means there were 22 teams that still could have gotten him. And by thinking how you think, you believe the Broncos are that scummy of an organization to do this? I don't believe this was planned for a second."
DenverBroncos,3571o0,Greeney494,0,Thu May 7 17:54:22 2015 UTC,Millions and millions? We're talking a border top 10-15 pick here not top 5 the difference wouldn't be millions and millions of dollars the pay isn't that different by 10 picks in the first round. As far as the Broncos planning it why not? I'd HATE to hear they did something like this but it seems like teams today really will do anything to get an inch ahead of the competition. But you're telling me a team on empty for making a Super Bowl push wouldn't try anything to get ahead? That's as ignorant as this post may be
DenverBroncos,3571o0,Greeney494,2,Thu May 7 18:16:26 2015 UTC,"He would've probably been top 10. And Clowney got $22 mil last year as the 1st pick, and Eric Ebron got $12 mil as the tenth pick, and Dee Ford got $8 mil as the 23rd pick, so yes MILLIONS and MILLIONS of dollars. No way this was planned."
DenverBroncos,3571o0,Zweems,1 point,Thu May 7 18:30:00 2015 UTC,"That's one year, when joining a good team in the late first round will give him the best chance to develop as the best player he can be and not only have the best shot to make the Super Bowl but will likely make back those millions and much much more after his contract is done"
DenverBroncos,3571o0,BornToulouse,2,Thu May 7 19:04:56 2015 UTC,"No, it's every year now that the NFL has a cap on draft pick salary, those numbers are pretty substantial and regular now.  But OK, let me entertain your insane theory for a minute: Why this draft? Seriously, why Shane Ray and the Broncos? The draft has been around for quite awhile now, it's had the same worst-team-picks-first order of selection, so why does this pick in this draft make SO MUCH sense to you? Why has no other team or player done it before THIS draft. Did Marino do it with the Dolphins? There's a reason you've been downvoted so much to where this post isn't even on the subreddit's page anymore."

Not once have you given ANY reason for him to sacrifice millions of dollars in a risky scheme to become a Denver Bronco. Why? Why would he put up this elaborate ruse to become a Bronco. Was he a Broncos fan growing up? Hundreds of players play for a team that they didn't grow up adoring every single year. Sure, there's a possibility that there is some crazy elaborate ruse to get him to fall to 23. But for what reason exactly? How about this... dude just got busted with pot in his car, fell and we liked the value of the pick. End story."

He tested like a beast at the combine and seems to have the attitude we need.  I think the sky is the limit for this guy.  Edit: I think he will play safety"
DenverBroncos,352vfp,SonicSC,2,Wed May 6 17:24:28 2015 UTC,"Agree. IDK if we'll have a UDFA that sticks this year because of the 3 7th rd comp picks, but if you throw those last 3 guys into that group, I think Furman's the guy who'll stick. Very excited about him."

DenverBroncos,352vfp,njm1314,2,Wed May 6 17:42:06 2015 UTC,"Tom Nalen and Shannon Sharpe were 7th rounders. Not to mention how many UDFA's make it big. I'm just saying, since he didn't get much playing time, he may have been severely under-valued.   I can hope right?!"
DenverBroncos,352vfp,aljds,2,Wed May 6 18:02:36 2015 UTC,"Eh, every now and again a seventh rounder works out, but let's not pretend it is anything close to a good sign that a player has lasted that long. Let's look at our seventh round picks the last ten years:  2014 - Corey Nelson  2013 - Zac Dysert  2011 - Virgil Green; Jeremy Beal  2010 - Syd'Quan Thompson; Jammie Kirlew  2009 - Blake Schlueter  2008 - Josh Barrett; Peyton Hillis  2005 - Paul Ernster  2004 - Matt Mauck; Brandon Miree; Bradlee Van Pelt  Frankly if I had taken that another five years it would look even worse. As it is we have Hillis as the best seventh rounder? A guy who did his best work for other teams. We all have high hopes for Green and I don't think we can call Nelson yet of course, but point being Tom Nalen is a goddamn miracle and we can't expect that kind of guy all that often."
DenverBroncos,352vfp,rckymtnclmbr,2,Thu May 7 00:19:43 2015 UTC,"Here's a list of all Broncos 7th round draft choices since 1970. Sharpe and Nalen are by far the best, but some other good names in there too.   http://pfref.com/tiny/4UU7M"
DenverBroncos,352vfp,PMeist,2,Thu May 7 03:58:11 2015 UTC,"What's real fun is to look at who the Broncos picked before Nalen and Sharpe.  1994 Draft- -1st:No pick -2nd: Allen Aldridge -3rd: No pick -4th: Randy Fuller -5th/6th: No pick -7th (210): Keith Burns -7th (212): Butler By'not'e -7th (218): Tom Nalen UDFA- Rod Smith, Dwayne Carswell (that was a good year for UDFA's apparently)  1990 Draft- -1st: No Pick -2nd: Alton Montgomery -3rd: No Pick -4th: Jeroy Robinson -5th: Jeff Davidson -5th: Le-Lo Lang -6th: Ronnie Haliburton -7th: Shannon Sharpe -8th: Brad Legget -9th: Todd Ellis -10th: Jim Szymanski -10th: Anthony Thompson  Who are these people?! I recognize a couple of the names but most didn't stick around long at all. I think this list can also go to show that draft grades are  bunk an no one really has a clue how things are going to work out. Also, the draft must have used to take a week with 10 rounds."
DenverBroncos,352vfp,bmsuperfly,1 point,Wed May 6 18:46:47 2015 UTC,"I agree, however Ihenacho was a UFA signing, not a draft pick.

DenverBroncos,352vfp,89raikessj,5,Thu May 7 03:59:25 2015 UTC,"I think he was the best of the 7th round selections. He would be a very nice compliment to Phillip's defense. He is obviously an amazing athlete.   I'm not sure how he slipped to the 7th. He's more of a 5th round value guy. Maybe box safeties aren't valued that well anymore, but we have the system and talent to let him succeed. Only problem is with all that talent he probably rarely sees the field if he even makes the team at all."
DenverBroncos,352vfp,bmsuperfly,3,Wed May 6 18:15:09 2015 UTC,"If he's that good an athlete, he might get his chance on Special Teams perhaps? Would be nice to hit on a 7th rounder, I absolutely love a diamond in the rough."
DenverBroncos,352vfp,bmsuperfly,1 point,Wed May 6 21:33:21 2015 UTC,I think so. He's a nice versatile depth guy to keep around probably. I wouldn't be surprised if he takes Davis's spot on the roster.

But the common perception that ""Jay Cutler whined his way over the the Bears"" is factually incorrect as I recall. I am completely sure that Cook made sure that the Broncos understood that Cutler didn't want to play for McDaniels, but that was internal and Cutler didn't complain to the media or in public as I recall.  It was clear that McDaniels didn't want him, and why would a player who had options want to stay in an environment like that?"
DenverBroncos,3504zb,myshkingfh,0,Thu May 7 16:55:32 2015 UTC,"Jay also threw an absolute bitch fit and demanded and wanted out when he found out his name was being floated in a 3 way deal.  That's your GM's job, to evaluate all options to make the team better.  Was trading Jay to get Cassel the better move?  Hell no!  But it's not like Cutler was exempt from even being discussed in trade talks.    Your starting quarterback shouldn't be able to handcuff the front office.  The Broncos had deeper issues then as well, not having a true GM, then promoting Xanders who had no real experience to GM.  Letting McD run the house over the top of Xanders.  It was a mess, still didn't make Cutler's reaction acceptable IMO."

DenverBroncos,351png,flynryan692,3,Wed May 6 11:33:45 2015 UTC,"My favorite play was CJ's run in Oakland. That entire moment actually. It was my first time going to an NFL game, I was watching my favorite team play, and CJ scorched the one team I hate hate. It was a beautiful moment. I can't wait to do it again!"
DenverBroncos,351png,taotechill,2,Wed May 6 15:09:28 2015 UTC,I agree. We were looking embarrassingly stagnant in that game prior to that TD. IIRC Manning had like 2 early INTs before that and it was like 3rd & 8. CJ took what easily could have been a loss of a yard and the end of the drive and took it home 51 yards. Game changer...
DenverBroncos,351png,flynryan692,2,Wed May 6 16:26:23 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at that point I was a little worried that I showed up to O.co wearing orange and the game was a trap. But then CJ balls out and we start winning. Thank you CJ!"
DenverBroncos,351png,jbrsce,2,Wed May 6 17:18:20 2015 UTC,CJ's run on 4th & 1 against the Colts was one of my favourite moments. Seemed like DT and others had given up meanwhile CJ playing like his life depended on it.
DenverBroncos,351png,h3isenburg,-2,Sun May 10 13:26:54 2015 UTC,"Season was a disappoint to me. No excuses. We failed on multiple levels.

Seems like there are some good points on both sides, but the lack of hard evidence makes me lean to believe there will only be a fine, if even that. Though it really bothers me when someone says ""doesn't matter even if they did cheat, they would have won anyway."" So much for integrity eh?"
DenverBroncos,353js1,Bad_Advice_Cat,1 point,Wed May 6 23:29:57 2015 UTC,"exactly, and every team tries there best to get a winning edge but there's a line and i think the crossed it, however minor it may have been. The part that makes me think Brady could be suspended is the fact he lied to Roger Goodell and the league about it. That probably has him in deep water more than anything."
DenverBroncos,353js1,blahrx,6,Thu May 7 01:29:30 2015 UTC,"I really don't care about ""deflategate"". It's such a joke to pretend that it puts an asterisk on that Superbowl. Patriots played great the entire post-season and that was one of the most exciting Superbowl games I have seen."
DenverBroncos,353js1,thereandbackagain7,2,Wed May 6 21:23:03 2015 UTC,They should have lost to Balty and had a cake walk AFCC
DenverBroncos,353js1,blahrx,-4,Wed May 6 22:17:54 2015 UTC,"regardless, it may not have played a role in who won and loss but at the end of the day the cheated, they knew they where cheating and i believe they should be made an example out of. My opinion (and yes it's very biased) is that tom should be suspended for 8 games and Bill Belicheck 1yr. As for an asterisk? not really. Tom's reputation may be harmed more than it deserves to be for this."
DenverBroncos,353js1,Vesmic,8,Wed May 6 22:06:29 2015 UTC,"""Based on the evidence, it also is our view that it is more probable than not that Tom Brady ... was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities,"" That's some pretty weak language. I would be surprised if Tom Brady was suspended any games much less 8. As for Bill, the report said they believe he had no knowledge so he won't be getting suspended either."
DenverBroncos,353js1,Viking_Skald,3,Wed May 6 22:23:59 2015 UTC,"I gotta bring up Sean Payton on this one. It's Bill's job to know whats going on.  Also i'm not completely delusional. i do know there's a extreme difference between flat balls and bounties. And i agree that has been blown out of proportion, but what else are we going to do in the off-season if we don't argue about it?"
DenverBroncos,353js1,Viking_Skald,2,Wed May 6 22:37:04 2015 UTC,"also i just want to point out the ""more probable/likely than not"" is a legal term and it was carefully chosen. In the eyes of the law 9/10 that generally means you can remove it from the sentence. So it reality it reads. ""Based on the evidence, it also is our view that Tom Brady ... was at least generally aware of the inappropriate activities,"" it's called the Legal burden of proof or Preponderance of Evidence and i don't think they worded it like that by mistake. I could be wrong I've only done minimal investigation into the definitions but I heard 104.3 the fan talking about it a few hours ago."

Opposing quarterbacks cannot be happy with this acquisition. I predict much sacking and many terrible throws because of the crazy pressure we're gonna be putting on opposing offenses. Stoked on this pick big time.   PS- You are the shit senor Perna- keep up the good work. I look forward to TGB almost as much as I look forward to gameday.
DenverBroncos,350luz,shindigg15,4,Wed May 6 02:48:08 2015 UTC,"One thing I picked up from this that I hadn't really noticed before. Danny plays MUCH larger than he is. His ability to stonewall a fullback is almost incomprehensible. Very quick decision maker, so he gets downfield quick enough to get momentum before the FB hits him."

DenverBroncos,34zg6k,MountCRushmore,6,Tue May 5 22:06:56 2015 UTC,I honestly think Ty would be a great fit at LG and Schofield can be a great RT.  So my ideal line would be Clady - Sambrailo - Garcia - Vasquez - Schofield.

DenverBroncos,350a08,ljp3,1 point,Wed May 6 02:23:35 2015 UTC,And you shouldn't if you are a fan of DT. The front office has a hard line approach to everything; The have a value for each player and they won't over pay a dime. If they feel you can be replaced goodbye. This in and of itself is completely reasonable but they could do it in a way where the player does not feel disrespected.
DenverBroncos,350a08,rishiswaz,1 point,Wed May 6 18:27:17 2015 UTC,As do I. Hopefully we can keep him.
DenverBroncos,350a08,ThreezusManning,-7,Wed May 6 02:53:16 2015 UTC,If you don't can we have him?
DenverBroncos,350a08,rckymtnclmbr,3,Wed May 6 03:26:33 2015 UTC,'no'
DenverBroncos,350a08,rckymtnclmbr,3,Wed May 6 03:39:44 2015 UTC,Hey you guys have Amari now. Just let us keep DT.
DenverBroncos,350a08,cubay,2,Wed May 6 04:50:06 2015 UTC,"I would imagine DT signs a contract by mid season. If not he may very well be gone. It would suck for sure, and I don't want to see it happen. But IMO you can still win without a top 5 receiver. Ask Seattle (Kearse/Baldwin) and NE (Amendola, Edelman, LaFell). There are other positions that are more important I think. Namely QB, OL, and DL.  A good (say top 10) QB can make do with average to good receivers if your OL is really solid and you have a defense that can get the ball back to your offense.   Again, I love DT and I really hope we keep him. But losing him wouldn't make it impossible for this team to win."
DenverBroncos,350a08,flynryan692,1 point,Wed May 6 18:14:26 2015 UTC,It is just sad seeing all these fan favorites leave.   At least Harris is still here and Elway worked like a mad man to keep him.

DenverBroncos,350a08,Greeney494,15,Wed May 6 01:07:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Elway would let him walk. Don't kid yourself."
DenverBroncos,350a08,flynryan692,3,Wed May 6 01:34:19 2015 UTC,If he did then there would be something up that we don't know about.  You do not let a franchise WR walk away for nothing.
DenverBroncos,350a08,Greeney494,2,Wed May 6 01:38:33 2015 UTC,"Don't tell Alfred Williams that.  ""We're gonna have Brock Osweiler under center, so we don't need a Demaryius Thomas level receiver because we won't have a Peyton Manning level passer.""  It's the dumbest logic I've heard. Generally I like Alfred, but I just don't understand the logic that ""If you don't have a world class QB, you don't need a world class WR."""
DenverBroncos,350a08,flynryan692,1 point,Wed May 6 16:55:33 2015 UTC,"More along the lines of, we will have an average QB and we can't spend $$$ on an elite WR. He may also be thinking that Cody should get better and develop with Brock. I know he and D-Mac (lol) were high on him in training camp.  I don't agree, I think DT has done everything the Broncos have asked of him and I believe he is good for the Broncos on and off the field."
DenverBroncos,350a08,Greeney494,2,Wed May 6 18:18:54 2015 UTC,"Like Chris Harris walked right? If Elway wants a guy, the guy stays."
DenverBroncos,350a08,flynryan692,9,Wed May 6 02:00:11 2015 UTC,"Chris Harris took a team friendly deal, if he would have tried to hold out for bigger money he would not be a Bronco. Elway isn't going to sit around and pussy foot with DT and his agent, there is going to be a point at which he tells them cya. Enough of the games."
DenverBroncos,350a08,von_bot,-1,Wed May 6 02:10:29 2015 UTC,"They've been negotiating for nearly a year....how long until Elway doesn't ""sit around and pussy foot"" anymore?"
DenverBroncos,350a08,indyxetan,2,Wed May 6 02:54:38 2015 UTC,"They were negotiating for a few months and then stopped. They haven't been negotiating for a year, I'm not even sure if they started talking again this off season or if they just tagged him. I give him until  slightly after mid season, but no later than the play offs at the absolute max. I don't personally see him getting until next off season to come to an agreement, Elway has been generous enough so far. He offers what he offers, if you don't like it he'll sign somebody else. Just ask DRC."
DenverBroncos,350a08,gwalstad,0,Wed May 6 05:50:00 2015 UTC,"I think it's a mistake to compare DRC and DT considering DRC is no where near the best corners in the game. DT could easily be top 3 receiver talent, you don't just let that walk, especially with an old QB trying to win one more Super Bowl, and a young QB that will need all the talent he can get to help him develop."
DenverBroncos,350a08,rckymtnclmbr,2,Wed May 6 15:39:13 2015 UTC,"You do let him walk when he plays games and over plays his hand. I agree he could be a top 3 WR, but he isn't the only player on the team and Elway isn't going to mortgage the team on him. We have to sign Miller and Manning is saying he wants to play another year after this, we can't afford Manning, Miller and DT. I think the fact that he is top talent is why he got the tag and now has another full season to get a contract worked out, but I am confident that this is it, it is either sign the contract or cya later."

DenverBroncos,34z158,bmsuperfly,3,Tue May 5 20:54:32 2015 UTC,I think they could if there is a surprise cut and camp doesn't look as good as planned. We have the 3m from Manny we can throw at a vet.   I have to think we have our secondary covered now. Maybe bring in a vet for the O-line or another linebacker. Not sure where else we could really use someone. It's probably dependent on who gets released and camp performance of the young guys.

DenverBroncos,34wvr2,epgenius,3,Tue May 5 18:17:37 2015 UTC,"I don't get all the hate on the Shane Ray pickup... The guy was a top 10 talent who dropped down and, in addition to being an immediate threat, is clearly our plan for replacing Demarcus. The draft was stacked with OL talent (our glaring weak point) so what's so crazy about going straight BPA in the first round? There were 5 offensive linemen taken in the first 22 picks and the only one left potentially worth picking up at #23 was DJ Humphries. Since the Cardinals traded up to #58, what it comes down to is us sacrificing DJ Humphries and Markus Golden for Shane Ray and Ty Sambrailo.  While Humphries is likely the better starter right now, Sambrailo's a little bigger, arguably has more room to grow, and is better with his hands. The biggest difference between the two is Humphries' comparatively better skill in run blocking schemes which probably aren't as big of a priority for us given Peyton's age and CJ's monster ability to gain yards after first contact. The comparisons between Ray and Golden are clear as day seeing as they played opposite each other on the exact same defensive line, and Shane Ray was the superior player. If anything we sacrificed an A- tackle and a B defensive end for an A+ defensive end and a B+ tackle."
DenverBroncos,34wvr2,andrrrew,3,Tue May 5 18:20:16 2015 UTC,If I could give a small draft analysis grade I would give you an A+.
DenverBroncos,34v3by,oobydoob,17,Mon May 4 20:26:44 2015 UTC,Cornick kind of sucks to be honest. He was a better run blocker than Chris Clark but that says nothing. He was an absolute atrocious pass blocker that got Peyton Manning killed in 1.5 seconds.
DenverBroncos,34v3by,WeDENverBoyz24,9,Mon May 4 22:48:26 2015 UTC,If I remember correctly last year when he started at RT Mark Schlereth called him the worst RT (or perhaps tackle in general) to ever start for the Broncos. lol
DenverBroncos,34v3by,Fridden,3,Tue May 5 01:04:04 2015 UTC,Not at all sad to see Cornick go. I didn't see anything in his play that hinted at making up for his cringe-worthy pass blocking.
DenverBroncos,34v3by,deliciouslysaucy,4,Tue May 5 02:14:54 2015 UTC,"I don't know why, but I keep thinking our Oline is going to be something like:  Clady/Schofield/Gino or Garcia/Vasquez/Sambrailo     I think I'd prefer Garcia, but even then I'm not sure what to think about that line. There's some decent depth actually, but it just comes down to essentially 3 really young guys. If Schofield, Sambrailo, and Garcia can at least not get abused every play then it may work and if one or two of them actually turn out above average then we're completely okay and playoff bound.   Those are some big Ifs though."
DenverBroncos,34v3by,bmsuperfly,5,Mon May 4 21:17:25 2015 UTC,I see it as   LT: Clady  LG: Gradowski  C: Garcia  RG: Vasquez  RT: Sambrailo  kubes pls save the day
DenverBroncos,34v3by,BlindManBaldwin,4,Mon May 4 21:38:00 2015 UTC,"I suppose. I just figured Schofield would get the start considering most of his weaknesses at Tackle don't exist if he plays guard. His only weakness when playing guard was his lack of strength which I assume has gotten better in 2 years.  I don't think our O-line will be horrible, but it will probably be the weakest part of the team. (STs still looks pretty bad imo)"
DenverBroncos,34v3by,bmsuperfly,3,Mon May 4 22:06:56 2015 UTC,I agree I feel Schofield works better as a Guard. I can see a Clady/Schofield/Garcia/Vasquez/Sambrailo line working out okay.
DenverBroncos,34v3by,Bronc27,2,Tue May 5 00:35:13 2015 UTC,"Yeah and even if he doesn't maybe Gino at guard isn't horrible and there's still Smith for depth. Then there's Garland who I don't know what to expect from, not sure if the ZBS makes him better or not. Just a wildcard and depth.  I think we'll use Green and Heuerman a lot for 6 man fronts. Daniels is the receiver of that group.  I actually might talk myself into thinking there isn't a hole at O-line. Uh-o."
DenverBroncos,34v3by,bmsuperfly,1 point,Tue May 5 00:40:24 2015 UTC,"Gino is the one that worries me, I wonder if Schofield will step up, or maybe the FA we signed, Shelley Smith, will be a serviceable starter."

DenverBroncos,34s51q,WeDENverBoyz24,13,Mon May 4 02:25:23 2015 UTC,"Let's use this thread to grade based purely on how the Broncos filled their needs, and not grading the actual players. (Yes we get it, we have to wait 2-3 years before we can do that.)  I'd say the Shane Ray pick probably didn't make sense in terms of needs, BUT Demarcus Ware is 33, Von Miller is entering a contract year, and the Broncos really covered their own asses here by jumping up to get Shane Ray, a player they had ranked in their top ten (And no, 2 fifths and Manny Ramirez is not giving up a lot, be real with yourself) so I understand their motive. That's a B to an A- move.  Sambrailo was a necessity. The interior line needs help, which means Ty can move there, or since he was a tackle in college, Louis could move back inside. This move is an A because it immediately filled a need this year.  The Heuerman pick probably gets a C purely based on need filling. The Broncos signed 4 different tight ends in the offseason and went and drafted this guy. He's athletic, can block, and has potential, but this seemed like a draft pick they were banking on to grow into a starter down the road when Daniels leaves.  Max Garcia, again, was a necessity. He may not start day one, but he'll at least add fuel to the camp competition fire. B+ in my book.  Lorenzo Doss is not necessarily another need position, but I think the Broncos are done with the Tony Carter game and with the possibility of moving Roby or Webster to safety, the fact that this is a passing league, you can never have too much corner depth, and Doss is about as instinctive as they come, just not very physical. C to a B-  Darius Kilgo was purely a depth move, making sure if anything were to happen to Austin/Walker/Sly, they've got a big body ready to fill in. Don't expect him to compete for starter, just be a valuable backup (think an athletic Unrein replacement for all those that got way too upset Unrein wasn't resigned.) Solid C+  And the 7th round picks were all crapshoots so whatever, no need to grade.  Overall it's hard to see how this draft is any less than a C+ or any higher than a B+ in my book."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,Greeney494,25,Mon May 4 03:15:58 2015 UTC,Should be called Von Winner
DenverBroncos,34s51q,von_bot,2,Mon May 4 03:17:02 2015 UTC,"Just wasn't to point out that Vasquez absolutely is going back to guard no matter what. They've already announced it, and he has already talked about it.   But also I feel like everybody is really really keyed up on drafting starting linemen. Odds are it went happen. We've got Garland, Paradis, Schofield, Smith, Clark, Gradkowski already all on the team, all fighting for those spots. Odds are Ty and Max sit for a year because they both need to bulk up and get stronger. So honestly based on need they should be ranked lower since you ranked TE lower since there is a lot of competition there.  I think Kilgo will get playing time, the guy racked up 43 tackles last year alone against good B1G East competition. If he gets 1/4 of that he's a productive DT."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,CO_Boiler,2,Mon May 4 04:16:38 2015 UTC,"Paradis and Garland and Clark won't have much of a chance to start IMO. Garland is on the team because this team is loyal for his off-field services IMO. I don't think he is actually good enough to start. Clark is only a backup LT and nothing more, he has no reason to play RT.  Smith and Grad and Schofield are definitely competing for starting spots though. It seems like Schofield is being worked on the left side a lot though, so I could see him going to LG while Ty goes to RT."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,CO_Boiler,1 point,Mon May 4 04:21:18 2015 UTC,"Where have you seen or heard anything about Schofield working on the left side? Because absolutely everything Elway, Kubiak, and others have said is ""We drafted him to play right tackle, and that is where we expect him to play"" when asked if he would play LG."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,Greeney494,3,Mon May 4 04:56:16 2015 UTC,"Schofield is practicing on the left side manned by Ryan Clady but will receive looks on the right side after adding weight and strength this offseason. Sambrailo played left tackle at Colorado State, though he showed promise on the right side at the Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala.  Last year's third-round pick, Michael Schofield, has a background at right tackle and left guard -- and worked at left tackle during the recent voluntary veteran minicamp behind Clady, Head Coach Gary Kubiak noted.  ""Right now, he's on the left side. We're settling him down right there,"" Kubiak said. ""There will be days we'll flip him over to the right. Whoever wins the job on the right, somebody has to be the swing guy."""
DenverBroncos,34s51q,CO_Boiler,2,Mon May 4 04:58:23 2015 UTC,"And that could very well be true, but I think Ty getting drafted in the second shows they're at least considering him as a possible starter. I agree there will be tons of competition on the line, but I disagree with your thinking that there are more set-in-stone starters on the line than at the tight end position. That's where the higher grades come in for me."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,vecchiobronco,1 point,Mon May 4 04:54:48 2015 UTC,"Not set in stone but they have an obvious advantage in experience in the NFL. I fully expect Casey and/or Duncan to be cut, and Jones to remain on the practice squad so that takes a lot of the competition away. I think TE was the worse pick, but the way it's looked at there are 10 guys fighting for 3 spots versus 4 guys fighting for 2/3 spots. That's all I'm saying."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,rtillaree,5,Mon May 4 13:08:17 2015 UTC,"I'd give it a W, for wait and see."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,mack2nite,2,Mon May 4 16:14:16 2015 UTC,"Excluding the Shane Ray selection, I'm going to give them a strong B. I think Elway answered a few needs and grabbed some really solid prospects in the later rounds. Including Shane Ray, IF Shane Ray becomes what many think he's capable of, it's an A++ draft/ If not, it would be a B-\C which is just the nature of the high-risk\high-reward picks in the 1st round."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,rtillaree,2,Mon May 4 13:43:33 2015 UTC,"I'm right there with you. Ray could flourish or he could flame out. On top of the recent poor decision making, he is recovering from an injury. If he can't recover, he'll lose that explosive first step that made him dominant in college. If the football gods shine down on us and grant Shane a healthy foot and the nuts to kick his ghetto posse to the curb, the Broncos could be seriously dangerous."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,TormentedDoss,2,Mon May 4 17:01:45 2015 UTC,"I'm worried more about the injury than the possession stuff for sure. The thought of Miller, Ware and a healthy Ray on this team is pretty amazing."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,CO_Boiler,2,Mon May 4 17:06:29 2015 UTC,I'm concerned about his ability than his health. He seemed to rely on the snap count more than anything in college anyways.
DenverBroncos,34s51q,TormentedDoss,5,Mon May 4 22:47:13 2015 UTC,I give them an A just for picking up Lorenzo Doss - only because we share the same last name(no relation though I am sure as he is black I am white so it is pretty unlikely)

DenverBroncos,34s51q,Big_Pete1999,3,Tue May 5 13:50:57 2015 UTC,"I'd give the Broncos an A+ for Shane Ray and a D to maybe F for everyone else, but hope that they work out to be good players.   Shane Ray was a top 10 overall prospect. Had he gone to CU Boulder, he never gets in trouble for having weed in his car because it isn't illegal. It's an instance of simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Had he gone to college in Colorado, he's drafted too high for Denver to get him.   Do we need him? Yes. Yes we do. Ware is no spring chicken. Ray is the person who makes him expendable. Now, it won't be this year cause Elway stupidly guaranteed Ware too much money, but next year, Ray will be the full time starter.   This year, Ray will rotate with Ware to hopefully keep Ware (and Ray from hitting the rookie wall) fresh for the playoffs. So from those aspects alone, the Shane Ray pick is genius.   The rest of the draft went to hell though.   The holes the Broncos have (many) were replaced by scrap heap vets and poorly graded draft picks. I get it, you (Elway and Kubiak) had amazing players in Neal, Lepsis, Schlereth, Jones, etc, but just because those guys were amazing doesn't mean everyone with a C+ draft grade will make it.   There was REAL talent to be taken, and we chose the JV squad. Why move up a few spots for Ray if you aren't willing to do the same for Fisher (first round talent still there in the second round)?   Yes, you filled positions of need, but you filled those needs with scrubs. That in and of itself means you didn't adequately fill that needed position.   Ugh. So frustrated. But, as always, I'll try to trust in Elway and his scouts. They are a bit ""hit and miss"", but when they hit, they hit home runs, and when they miss, oh boy do they. That's why I give it a bad grade with the current knowledge we have. They simply plugged poor players into glaring holes that have hurt this team immensely the last 2 seasons.   Go Broncos."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,Big_Pete1999,0,Mon May 4 12:07:31 2015 UTC,"CU is not the school you want to use to talk about players and drugs or other off the field issues... Stabbing teammates in the leg for example? Or throwing a girlfriend down the stairs? If he went to CU he would have been a second round pick at best because of simply how bad that school has become.  And considering you were all over CU, I'm guessing you hate TY because he went to CSU, which has become the better football program as much as you hate it, so huge bias there.  I also don't see how we have plugged poor players into glaring holes the last 2 seasons. Where was our glaring hole 2 years ago because I can't think of one. As for last year I assume you mean the line; but again that's not correct because the only person that we plugged in that failed us was Chris Clark and I don't blame them because he did great at left tackle 2 years ago. Other than that, again where was the hole in the team? Kicker? We got that fixed mid season. Kick return? Found that in Bolden at the end, and blame that on the old coaching staff. In terms of drafting I don't see what you are talking about. I'm not attacking you, just pointing out some things, and asking what you saw that I didn't."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,CO_Boiler,0,Mon May 4 17:46:48 2015 UTC,"First, let me say ""thank you"" for actually replying to what I said with your downvote instead of just downvoting. If people downvote, please tell me why I'm wrong, ya know? So first and foremost, thank you. Major props to you. I appreciate it.  Second: I actually couldn't care less about CU (or CSU) and you are twisting what my point was. HAD HE GONE TO CU, possession of weed would have been LEGAL and he WOULD HAVE BEEN DRAFTED TOP 10. THAT was my point. The only reason he fell to #23 is because he had weed in his car when he was pulled over. So again, had he gone to CU (major school so he'd have a realistic shot at 1st round draft status), he would have been top 10. You could pick any Colorado school you want to insert instead of me saying CU if you'd like, but I picked CU simply because it's in a bigger conference.  And as far as CU vs CSU. I don't think anything about it. I'm not a fan of either school. I'm a fan of KU (Kansas), so I honestly have zero bias of one school and players over another. I was simply using it to make a point about Shane Ray.  Now, as far as how we drafted outside of Shane Ray, it was piss poor at best. We still had Jake Fisher 6 spots ahead of us. Fisher was a slam dunk 1st round graded talent. Ty ""however-you-pronounce-his-last-name"" from CSU was a 3rd to 4th round graded talent.... So we naturally take him a round too soon. You can basically say that about every pick we made outside of the first round.  We took 3rd round talent in the second round. We took 5th round talent in the third round, and so on and so forth.   That my man, is piss poor drafting. Hey, Ty might turn into the next Matt Lepsis or Dan Neil, and if he does, man, thank you John Elway. But when you take players at a minimum of 1 or 2 rounds too early, you are a bad drafter.   With this (hopefully) being Peyton's last year in Denver, he'll need all the help on that line that he can get. So what do we do? We let the only player who gave half a fuck in the playoffs go for a very reasonable $7million (reasonable meaning it wasn't a bloated amount. That was lower end of his market value, so we SHOULD HAVE KEPT HIM).   We have, what, Chris Clark (aka can't play RT to save his life) anchoring the right side? Yeah, he was so damn effective that we had to move Vasquez from guard to tackle because Clark sucked so bad.   So what are we gonna do? Plug rookies that are borderline middle of the pack (meaning mid round grades) to protect the most fragile QB outside of Michael Vick? Sorry, but that spells disaster.   And hey, I 100% fully acknowledge that this is ""immediate grading"" of a player before they have a shot at actually playing, so it's totally unfair. For all we know that QB we took in the 7th round will be the next John Elway. I get it, I really do, but until I see otherwise, I think that outside of the Shane Ray pick, Elway reached 1 or 2 rounds too soon for players and should have moved up for Fisher, who I know for a fact they were drooling over. Had they drafted Ray and Fisher, I'd have given this draft a B+ or A- simply because we'd have two legit starters. But we don't. We have 1 legit starter and 8 backup and/or practice squad players. Sorry, but when that's our draft strategy, I can't go any higher than a D.  But again, thank you for actually replying. If you want to hash this out here and sway me, please feel free to do so. Tell me how Ty was better than Fisher. Tell him how any of our other later round picks are brilliant and simply not camp bodies in a position of need. I'll gladly debate it with you. I love that type of stuff."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,moondoggle,0,Mon May 4 19:09:02 2015 UTC,"Did you not read my article last year on MHR about why Chris Clark was going to fail as a right tackle?  Last year we had exactly 1 hole on the offensive line. It was the hole left behind by Beadles. So what did Elway and Fox do? They blew up the entire line. They made 4 holes when only 1 existed.  They thought they could plug in a career disaster at RT (Clark) who played good at LT, back into RT. What did they expect? That he'd suddenly learn how to play RT? Sorry, but it doesn't work that way. Some players can play on the right and some on the left. Clark can play on the left. Period. He's never been good on the right. Like, ever. Never ever ever.   All we had to do was plug Clark into the LG spot and we'd have the same line that went to the damn super bowl, but with Ryan Clady back. Uh, WINNING!!!! haha  But instead, we blew it up and had a different line every few weeks. There was zero chemistry, zero players in their natural position outside of ManRam (who sucked at guard to begin with). We had our all pro guard playing tackle because he was the only person they could trust to get out of his stance. It was a disaster.  I love my team probably more than anyone on this planet, but like I have to give my kids the ""cold hard truth"", I feel like it's my duty to give Broncos fans the cold hard truth when it comes to this team because simply put, it isn't sunshine and rainbows. I wish I could have that child like innocence and believe that we will go 19-0 every year, but they've burned me too many times and I have too much info from them to know that's the case. I guess what they say is true. The more you know, the more skeptical you become.  The fact of the matter for this 2015 team is this: We have 2 out of 5 ""starters"" that I'm comfy with. Clady (all-pro in zone blocking) and Vasques (all-pro guard). The rest is a HUGE crap shoot. We will have mid round 2nd year players who had ZERO reps with the first team last year contending for starting positions. We're going to have rookies this year contending for starting positions. Again, they might pan out, but there's a better chance of them failing than working.   Add in the rules changes for zone blocking, and the ""we can find anyone from anywhere to play on our line and be successful"" mentality just isn't there anymore. There are no more fire drills (stop, drop, and roll) in the ZBS.   So we're going to rely on mid round (or should be mid round) rookies and 2nd year players who were HORRIBLE as rookies (again, I go to all practices and have contacts) to protect Peyton Manning and block for Montee Ball/CJ Anderson? Color me skeptical. I hope I'm wrong, but man, I'm really afraid that I'm right."
DenverBroncos,34s51q,JPost,1 point,Mon May 4 19:22:53 2015 UTC,"Well let's start this off simply. No I didn't read your article cuz for one I don't know who you are, for another I don't read every article on there because I have a life and work 16 hours a day all summer long when I'm not in college. Two good for you, you correctly predicted that they wouldn't use your opinion, color me shocked. (yes that's very sarcastic but it is simply to make a point that there was no need to bring up your article)  Let's look at why they didn't other than the obvious ""you're not a professional."" What is Franklin's main flaw? He can't handle speed rushers. What is Clark's main flaw? He struggles with power guys more than speed guys (in general). So what they did was put Franklin in a phone booth where he wouldn't get torched by speed, and Clark on the outside so he wouldn't be facing power. Makes sense to me. You bring up the Super Bowl line, you do realize they got their asses handed to them all night right? Franklin got beat a number of times, Manny was well... We know..., Clark got plowed over a number of times, Beadles got out muscled on the inside. The only one that actually did his job was Vasquez for the most part. The whole line needed blown up after that shit show.  Now onto the new guys, and just keep in mind the fact that you go to practices, and have ""contacts"" means nothing more to me than that you have a LOT of time on your hands because that isn't your job, so your opinion maybe means slightly more than mine, but, I can't say that because of some fundamental flaws in your argument. Yes Schofield and Paradis were mid round picks, and they didn't play well. But have you thought about why? Because we ran a power running scheme last year and we drafted 2 zone blocking linemen... The writing was on the wall last year that Fox and company probably wouldn't be around much longer. If you don't believe me go and look at Schofield game tape, because it was said at the time that Paradis was a ZBS center. So I think that alone will boost their performance, plus Schofield put on the weight he needed to hold his own. As for TY do I think we reached a bit? Yea maybe about a 1/3 to 1/2 of a round. Do I think we reached on Max? No I think we got him at a really good value actually, I thought he would go a round earlier.   Now let's move to your criticism of Elway. For starters you cannot blame last year's line on him. Blame that on Fox and Gase, there is a reason they are gone. Next you say he guaranteed too much money to Ware... Who do you think is better for Von and Ray to learn from than Ware? They planned on him playing 2 years and teaching what he knows and contributing at a fairly high level, and if not after he taught Von a lot he would be gone. That argument is pointless and you have nothing to back it up that it was stupid. Next you say why move up for Ray if you won't move up for Fischer. How do you know that they didn't try? How do you know that the price wasn't stupid high? How do you know anyone would even consider swapping picks with us? Your contacts? Please, don't give me that. The draft fell how it fell and they did what they could to make the team better and I would say that they did. They filled holes and brought in competition.  Are we going to be starting 3 new players? Yes. But we are also going back to a scheme that all of our players were drafted, or brought in, to play and that alone should significantly increase the production of those players. And honestly scheme had a huge part of why we couldn't run the ball last year. Gase refused to have someone cover the backside of the play and our backs got caught behind the line all the time because of it. Kubiak has a scheme that turns mediocre lines into good lines, look at Baltimore, that line was terrible two years ago, and look at how they did last year. So our running game should be better, and more committed, and Peyton still releases the ball faster than anybody in the league. Combine those two things and you give that line a huge advantage. I'm not looking through orange lenses, I'm saying there were huge fundamental flaws last year and they bit us in the ass and made us move linemen around, and there were reasons for each chest move and most importantly blame the correct people. I'm not an expert but I do know enough to know where the responsibility lies.  To respond to the Shane portion, there most likely would still be a note that he was in posession, and that would get to the league somehow, it always does. Since its illegal in the league it still hurts his draft stock a lot. But you also can't even use that argument since there are 48 states that say it is illegal, so the fact that it is legal in two is really pointless. We know why he dropped and we know we were able to capitalize. End of story.  For the rest of the draft, we reached in the 3rd but only because of an extremely thin TE class, and planning for the future, that's fine with me. Especially when you see him play uninjured... I have... It wasn't a fun day for me, he was over drafted for right now, but I think has good potential. The 4th was good I think it cancelled out the 3rd. 5th We are looking at a ballhawking free safety I about bet on that or a slot corner since he doesn't have the size or speed to be else where, alright pick if you look at him as a free safety and not a corner. 6th we scored. Kilgo went up against good B1G competition last year and racked up 43 tackles, 8(10?) For loss and 2 sacks... As a nose guard!!! That's productive, and you never saw him give up on a play, you'll see him cream someone 20 yards down field, he has good vision and patience too when he is engaged. He needs to turn some weight into pure muscle, and he could be very good. 7th eh whatever, not much left to grab, they wanted competition for Dysert to push Oz, and they wanted a true safety in the mix too, whatever.   Tried to respond to both replies in one shot and balance the discussion since one had a completely different tone than the other."

DenverBroncos,34qzi1,ApathyJacks,2,Sun May 3 22:13:49 2015 UTC,I live 45 minutes from Baltimore so I see plenty of Ravens fans so my hatred runs just as thick trust me!
DenverBroncos,34qzi1,lakecityjanedoe,2,Mon May 4 01:35:58 2015 UTC,I would recommend going through the official nfl Broncos site as that is where season ticket holders sell their tickets. If you want to sit near a scoreboard I would strongly suggest the south stands. The best fans and fireworks!
DenverBroncos,34qzi1,lakecityjanedoe,1 point,Sun May 3 21:23:19 2015 UTC,South stands is what I was referring to! Either that or on the Broncos sideline/behind an endzone. I wouldn't mind sitting up high because I've heard there's not a bad seat in the house but since this is a one time thing I can't exactly do very often living across the country I'm willing to splurge a little bit. I drove up to NY for the Jets game last year but decided this time around I need to see a home game.
DenverBroncos,34qzi1,CryBerry,2,Mon May 4 01:37:40 2015 UTC,"If you can get behind the Broncos bench, that would be cool. Sometimes it's a bit hard to see the other end zone, but the people are cool."

DenverBroncos,34r0o6,WeDENverBoyz24,2,Mon May 4 01:15:25 2015 UTC,"At inside linebacker at 5'11"" 220 lbs? That's going to be a big task for him. Just overcoming the size is going to be rough. He really needs to put on 30 lbs to have a shot at actual playing time other than special teams."
DenverBroncos,34r0o6,CO_Boiler,2,Mon May 4 01:50:18 2015 UTC,220 is the concerning part but the height isn't. London Fletcher was 5'10 and he had a wonderful career.
DenverBroncos,34r0o6,WeDENverBoyz24,2,Mon May 4 02:09:04 2015 UTC,"Yea height doesn't mean much, except that he is taller than Fletcher and weighs 22 lbs less so his frame is even less filled out."
DenverBroncos,34r0o6,CO_Boiler,1 point,Mon May 4 02:11:01 2015 UTC,I think they should put Zaire at SS. He's pretty athletic and tracks the ball really well. There were points last year where he was the only player on the defense who was where he was supposed to be.

DenverBroncos,34r0o6,jfoster15,3,Tue May 5 15:37:58 2015 UTC,Our O-Line has really enjoyed being injured as of late so I except a one of the OL guys to make it. Can never have too much depth to protect Peyton since he can't exactly scramble haha!

DenverBroncos,34r0o6,bmsuperfly,6,Sun May 3 20:46:12 2015 UTC,This is Kalon Davis telling the Broncos he is making the team or else.  http://mediaassets.independentmail.com/photo/2014/04/27/397937_4255628_ver1.0_640_480.JPG

DenverBroncos,34r0o6,YakPineapple,2,Sun May 3 22:49:38 2015 UTC,I think Dillon Day would make it. Dillon Day fits the size and mentality to succeed.

Peyton's quick release will make him look good in pass protection and we're a rare case of a team that's a super bowl contender where he can compete for a starting spot. He's fast and agile enough to fit as a zone blocker as well."
DenverBroncos,34r0o6,eme_pirrade,0,Mon May 4 04:10:18 2015 UTC,"It would be an absolute steal, but there's no way he does that. He'd rather waste 2 years and re-enter in 2017."

DenverBroncos,34r0o6,eme_pirrade,2,Mon May 4 04:19:29 2015 UTC,"He can't re enter for 2016, it's part of the cba. He also said he plans to sign when he's exonorated."

But fact of the matter remains he isn't on our team, and there will be 31 other teams with a shot at him. So fact of the matter is saying he will be the one to make our team when he's not even signed is pointless.  Edit: FYI I just spent a half hour trying to find any connection to the Broncos to confirm what you are saying, and I have found absolutely nothing. Nothing from Vic, Shefter, MHR, Twitter, McShay, any of the NFL analysts on ESPN or NFL Network. Nothing. Not even rumors that we will grab him."

On a side note, those Maryland uniforms are just hideous."
DenverBroncos,34qudf,TDenverFan,2,Sun May 3 22:36:13 2015 UTC,"Love his motor. Even after the ball was thrown or the ball carrier was downfield I saw him running after him. Not the best run defender, as others said, but good pass rushing and looks like he can absorb a double team or two. Good late round guy"
DenverBroncos,34qudf,SonicSC,2,Mon May 4 01:18:06 2015 UTC,I love his acceleration when he gets free of blockers. Big dude is surprisingly fast.
DenverBroncos,34qudf,bmsuperfly,2,Mon May 4 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"I don't know if this was his best college tape, but I really like this tape. The entire first half of the video he's forcing double teams and even on* a play or two he gets triple teamed. There's always a chip blocker used on him and if there isn't then he forces pressure on the QB every play.  The only reason I can see from this specific tape that he wasn't picked high is he struggles against defending the run. He forces a cutback on one play, but there's one or two plays where he should make the tackle on the runner and he doesn't.   Assuming this is what the majority of his tape looks like then I think he earns a roster spot. I think he may not see a lot of time this year just because there's a deep front 6 in front of him, but I could see him taking rotation snaps next year and maybe a starter one day if he polishes his game."

DenverBroncos,34qudf,dusting53,1 point,Mon May 4 02:03:12 2015 UTC,He uses his hands well and seems to be athletic enough to rush the passer and help on some outside runs. doesn't do a good job playing with a low pad level which hurts him on double teams and when they run at him. looks like he plays pretty hard and does a good job of crossing face instead of going around against the run.
DenverBroncos,34qudf,Fatandmean,1 point,Mon May 4 07:04:09 2015 UTC,"as an iowa fan, this was an awful game. watched it on a flight to denver for the SF/SD 2 game homestand (cool story bro)  anyway, loved the effort in this film. iowa's o-line was no slouch last year. but QBs will not hang on to the ball as long as dipshit Rudock did in this game either.  would like to see a more explosive first step. hope he pans out, or at least pushes Sly/Austin Jr"

DT isn't a real problem like some people think it is, same for LBs. I don't think we left the draft with any real holes that can't be filled, it's just a question of who now."

DenverBroncos,34ny5g,TheLegendtaker,5,Sun May 3 00:25:51 2015 UTC,Northwestern fan here.   He's not great but he had TERRIBLE protection the last two years and a terrible offensive coordinator to boot. He's got a good arm though and is a smart guy. Could be a solid backup
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,TelltaleHead,6,Sun May 3 00:14:32 2015 UTC,I don't expect him to ever see the field. Just competition for Brock's backup.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,bmsuperfly,4,Sat May 2 22:40:54 2015 UTC,Prob just a camp arm.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,Coos-Coos,2,Sun May 3 04:37:09 2015 UTC,Pretty much just competition between him Dysert.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,bmsuperfly,2,Sun May 3 04:43:00 2015 UTC,"Yep, and there for our only hope if the great Brock gets injured.  I expect the Broncos will draft a 3rd round or higher QB next year.  Either Manning retires so we need a very good backup and possible replacement for Brock, or Manning stays and we can't afford to keep Brock around, so we draft high for Manning's backup/future replacement."
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,AdaAstra,2,Sun May 3 18:49:16 2015 UTC,"Maybe, but I don't expect it. There's a lot of good QB options in that draft imo, but having a depth chart of Brock, Rookie, Dysert doesn't make the best sense to me.   You pretty much have to give Brock 2 years to start. The only way you don't is if he literally is the worst QB to ever play and I don't think we'd get to this point if he is.   Either Brock is the man or not, if he's the man you want depth incase of injury so you probably want a vet who isn't going to lose you games outright and hopefully the team can pull a win. I'm thinking the Fitzpatrick and Hoyers of the world. If he's not the man then you're not going to know until the year after and I think it's more likely we take a QB then.  This is all based on the assumption Peyton retires after this year and Brock stays a Bronco afterwards obviously."
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,bmsuperfly,1 point,Sun May 3 18:59:22 2015 UTC,"We also have to plan on Brock not being good.  A solid drafted QB to push him will make Brock better and also give us the added benefit of having a solid backup QB who can be traded if need be.  If Brock doesn't pan out, we can put in the backup and see how that goes.  As of right now, I don't think Dysert is ready to be our main backup for the starter.  Maybe in a few years learning from Manning/Brock he could be, but I personally feel an ""NFL ready"" draft pick might be a better backup.    I should point this is all dependent either Brock or Manning leaving next year.  If Manning stays and we somehow manage to keep Brock until Manning's retirement, then I agree that Dysert will be our first backup as he will have a few more years to learn now.  However, if Manning doesn't retire, it will be tough to keep Brock as some QB starved teams will likely pay more than we are willing too when, despite our faith in him, he really has limited experience.  I'm hoping this year they can give him some planned starts to get a sense if we need to gamble on him or not.  It is no secret that he wants to play, so we may have to pay him more if we still want him to sit behind Manning."
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,AdaAstra,1 point,Sun May 3 19:19:13 2015 UTC,I think I'd trust a 2 year Dysert behind Manning and Brock over a rookie even in the 3rd round. Just my opinion though. I agree with if Manning stays it's really hard to keep Brock.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,bmsuperfly,6,Sun May 3 19:22:02 2015 UTC,His highlight reel begins with a near interception.  Not a great start.

DenverBroncos,34ny5g,solsethop,1 point,Sat May 2 22:50:45 2015 UTC,Yea the first throw was crazy but they end up winning against a solid ranked team. He has some seriously nice accuracy and I wouldn't be surprised if he pans out better than Grayson

DenverBroncos,34ny5g,yslithal,2,Sun May 3 02:20:44 2015 UTC,Developmental prospects are always hit or miss. That is exactly what Siemian is for the Broncos. The guy is going to get some time to grow. He has great footwork for a young guy and a pretty good arm. He really needs to work on his vision. But that is one of the last things to come to a quarterback. People look at his numbers on the field but sometimes it's the coaching a player receives that maximizes his faults.  Give the guy a chance. He may end up being something someday. Not a lot of QBs possess the tools he has at such a young age.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,Neverethe,2,Sun May 3 04:46:18 2015 UTC,I like it. Played as good as it gets with a shit line. He was under pressure every single play. I think he's better than Weeden.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,waspocracy,1 point,Sun May 3 06:42:11 2015 UTC,7 TDs to 11 INTs last year. Sacked 31 times.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,1 point,Sat May 2 23:01:07 2015 UTC,"His stats are beyond troubling. Completion percentage the last three years: 58.7%, 59.7%, 58.2%. Ouch. Really bad sign to not see some improvement year to year for a QB in this category. Had 7 tds to 11 ints last year along with a 5.6 yards per pass. Woof. Played in a spread and has mediocre size (6'2"" 212).   It's seventh round so I know it's a crapshoot, but... Just seems like a place where you want a guy who at least has a shot in hell of competing in training camp. A project/athlete type guy. Stranger things have happened, but safe money says this guy is never heard from again."
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,njm1314,2,Sat May 2 22:56:56 2015 UTC,Being a northwestern fan I can give a little insight. Along with those picks he was sacked a lot. He was never really given enough time by our line to progress through his reads so a lot of times he just ended up throwing it up or a way. If he was given time he really showed he can play well. He's not great but could be a serviceable back up when given time.
DenverBroncos,34ny5g,Barnstormer2nd,0,Sat May 2 23:27:00 2015 UTC,"You guys are too critical. He is a 7th round QB that will be a practice squad player or 3rd string at best this year. In this game he showed some good awareness vs the #14 team at the time and won. Scanned the field, stepped into the pocket, able to roll out, had to make accurate throws, while getting pressured non stop. Nothing wrong with taking a late round QB and seeing what they can offer."

DenverBroncos,34n380,PMeist,2,Sat May 2 17:48:17 2015 UTC,I don't think Broncos fans were freaking out. Everyone else who thought we made a poor move did. At least as a general feeling I've gotten. I mostly saw a circlejerk of fans being stoked about Ray being able to rotate in and help right away (a circle jerk I DEFINITELY took part of). It was known that this draft would have decent lineman throughout.

DenverBroncos,34m8fe,WhiskeyWizerd,1 point,Sun May 3 22:43:38 2015 UTC,"I just want to point out that they could still do something like draft a QB in the first couple rounds next year and undo all of this. Or fail to re-sign him when his contract is up after this season, then so much for that. I mean you can try to spin it into a vote of confidence, and that's probably for the best anyway, but there's no way any of us could know that the Broncos didn't actually try to get a QB and just couldn't pull it off. But that's getting into tinfoil territory, so I'll back up a bit. I'm just saying that MHR's jumping the gun a little bit on this one. This draft doesn't cement anything for the QB position in the future. Hell, the draft isn't even over yet. Even a late rounder could get people riled up. I remember some people saying Dysert was the superior QB a couple years ago.   I should throw it out there that I'm rooting for Osweiler though. I don't want that to get lost in me saying the QB situation isn't completely crystal clear yet. They're two separate things. The Broncos made an investment in him, and I want to see how it pans out on the field. I really like his potential, and I hope to see him fulfill it with the Broncos. Maybe he'll get there, maybe he won't. We won't know until it actually happens. Which is why I'm not sure how some people have already written him off, or have decided he's terrible (or at least some people that I've come across personally). I just prefer to see the guy really play before I pass judgement. Plus seriously, who doesn't want to bring a bunch of matching towels to the games and wave them around in support of Brock?"
DenverBroncos,34m8fe,AdaAstra,1 point,Sat May 2 18:23:08 2015 UTC,"They will draft a QB next year.  If Manning retires, meaning we will need to look at depth if either Brock gets hurt or doesn't pan out.  If Manning doesn't retire next round, Broncos will likely have to let Brock go because we will have to pay him to keep him around.  Other QB starved teams will likely pay more than we are for him (as he likely won't have the experience to back up a big paycheck yet).  If that happens, then we will be drafting high up or trading for a back up/future replacement of Manning.  Edit: I should point out, I want Osweiler to work out as well and feel he is at least the short-mid term solution (1-2 seasons) after Manning goes.  But that is only if Manning goes next year."
DenverBroncos,34m8fe,WhiskeyWizerd,1 point,Sat May 2 18:38:34 2015 UTC,That's a fair point too! So many different way this thing can pan out.
DenverBroncos,34m8fe,AdaAstra,1 point,Sat May 2 18:41:16 2015 UTC,"It will depend on if Manning or Brock goes.  If Manning goes, we will draft a QB around the 3rd round as Brock has been around in the NFL long enough, that he still has a shot at being something great.  If Brock goes, we will need a replacement for him, so we will draft high.  As that QB will need to back up Manning and eventually be our starter when Manning retires."
DenverBroncos,34m8fe,aljds,1 point,Sat May 2 18:46:27 2015 UTC,"FWIW, from 1970 to 2009, there have been 41 QBs drafted in the 2nd round of the draft. Only 2 have won super bowls, only 4 have been named 1st team all pros, only 8 have been to the probowl, and only 10 were a starter for more than 3 years.  Roughly 75% were considered unsuccessful, about 10% successful, and the rest somewhere in between.  About half started fewer than 16 games. http://pfref.com/tiny/jCfDr  The odds are stacked against Osweiler (or any QB we draft).  Not saying he can't be successful, but throughout history, there have been many more busts than studs drafted in the second round (really the whole draft for that matter)."
DenverBroncos,34m8fe,WhiskeyWizerd,2,Sat May 2 20:09:38 2015 UTC,"I don't know how I feel about stats like that. None of those guys' successes or failures are going to have any effect on Osweiler's performance, at least as far as I can tell. He's in his own unique situation, with a unique team and coaching staff compared to any of those other players. The only relevance is that they all happened to be drafted in the same round.   Maybe it's that they're the leftovers after all the ""elite"" talent has been skimmed off the top, but plenty of those elites have been busts too. The fact of the matter is, in the grand scheme of things, there's probably only a small percentage of QBs that actually even turn out to be good, considering how many are churned out every single year. Plenty are average, even more are terrible, and lots of them just never get a chance to play. There's only 32 starting QB spots in the NFL total, and we can't even fill that number completely with good QBs at any given time.   Anyway, I get that you already recognize that. I'm not trying to disregard your point or anything either, because maybe there is a specific reason second rounders hardly ever pan out and I'm just not seeing it. At the very least, it's something interesting to consider, so thanks for bringing it up. But I'm looking through that list of guys, and I see Jake Plummer on there, and any list with that guy on it is okay with me! Brock's got some good company in that 2nd round."
DenverBroncos,34m8fe,aljds,1 point,Sat May 2 20:38:23 2015 UTC,"The fact of the matter is, in the grand scheme of things, there's probably only a small percentage of QBs that actually even turn out to be good, considering how many are churned out every single year.    Exactly.  That's why I have a hard time getting to excited about any QB who is drafted in the NFL (besides the top 5 pick guys). Guys drafted in the first 5 spots have historically been starters for 4 years or more about 75% of the time, rest of the first round is about 45%, second round was about about 25%, 3rd is about the same and then I imagine it drops off pretty quickly.    This compares to say, OL drafted in the first round, where about 75-80% have gone on to be starters for several years."

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,3,Sat May 2 16:29:52 2015 UTC,"Time to pass on the torch, may you be blessed with drunken stupor."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,crueg,9,Sat May 2 16:25:46 2015 UTC,"Alright, my predictions for the last 3 picks: WR from a D2 school, white QB you've never heard of, and a safety with 3 nipples."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,5,Sat May 2 21:39:01 2015 UTC,2 outta 3 aight bad

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,7,Sat May 2 16:38:33 2015 UTC,Update: ELWAY HAS ARRIVED
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,5,Sat May 2 17:40:41 2015 UTC,You mean God!??!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,crueg,2,Sat May 2 17:41:48 2015 UTC,YEAH BABY!  WHOO I'M ON THE EDGE OF MY SEAT!  WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW???
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,4,Sat May 2 17:41:29 2015 UTC,Holding up the jersey. BORING. Zoom back out camera guy! The press matters! THEY ARE THE REAL STARS
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,5,Sat May 2 17:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'm calling it now, with pick 164 we're taking Brett Hundley  well fuck, looks like /u/IComeUpWithBadIdeas isn't havin' lobster tonight"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,7,Sat May 2 18:10:27 2015 UTC,No way. I'll eat a Lobster whole if that happens.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,4,Sat May 2 18:11:22 2015 UTC,dead or alive?
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,6,Sat May 2 18:12:28 2015 UTC,Living.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,crueg,3,Sat May 2 18:16:20 2015 UTC,Pinchers and all?
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,6,Sat May 2 18:12:28 2015 UTC,Especially the pinchers
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,2,Sat May 2 18:16:37 2015 UTC,"well that's not much of a wager, lobsters are delicious!"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,3,Sat May 2 18:12:00 2015 UTC,Welp
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,3,Sat May 2 18:14:33 2015 UTC,"Welp, there goes that."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,crueg,6,Sat May 2 18:14:57 2015 UTC,"Well, C fills the need.  Not Dismukes, but if Elway likes him, I guess I do too."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,5,Sat May 2 17:34:53 2015 UTC,Update: The press did nothing. No reaction. Most started typing.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,6,Sat May 2 17:35:30 2015 UTC,Keep us updated!! I want your reactions to the press reactions!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,mdonoyan,4,Sat May 2 17:38:02 2015 UTC,This is riveting!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,6,Sat May 2 17:36:15 2015 UTC,"Garcia has experience at LG as well, at the very least he can compete for starting center or shore up that LG position now that Franklin is gone.  I really really really like this pick."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,6,Sat May 2 17:46:56 2015 UTC,"Alright. New prediction, with pick 164, the Broncos gamble on La'el Collins, and Elway personally visits his ass and says ""If you ass isn't at training camp, the cops are gonna be the least of your worries"""
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,2,Sat May 2 18:19:01 2015 UTC,Hahahaha I'd pay to see that.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,2,Sat May 2 18:19:29 2015 UTC,No kidding. Press reaction at that conference would be wild.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,5,Sat May 2 18:20:35 2015 UTC,"The ""Belldozer""?  HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA what an awful name."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,4,Sat May 2 17:00:37 2015 UTC,Wow way to stroke yourselves by showing off them trophies Steelers.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,2,Sat May 2 17:06:11 2015 UTC,HAHAHA right?  I was thinking the same thing.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,5,Sat May 2 17:07:45 2015 UTC,"Gonna randomly predict we take B.J. Finney, C from K-State"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,TheLegendtaker,5,Sat May 2 17:15:23 2015 UTC,So the Broncos website is supposed to be broadcasting Heuerman's press conference but they're running late so its just a live feed of like 15 people sitting in the press room. Pretty captivating stuff.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,2,Sat May 2 17:22:04 2015 UTC,Probably won't see them until they've got the pick in.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,CO_Boiler,3,Sat May 2 17:28:05 2015 UTC,Yeah they said a couple minutes ago its going to be after the pick. But they're playing the draft in the room so I'm going to keep watching and see how they react. I have no life...
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,2,Sat May 2 17:31:12 2015 UTC,"Broncos are love, Broncos are life"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,3,Sat May 2 17:32:50 2015 UTC,Hue hue hue
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,4,Sat May 2 17:26:12 2015 UTC,"From NFL.com:   Strengths  Team captain who is beloved by teammates, fans and his coaches. Considered a hard worker in weight room. Has upper-body power to torque and move defenders. Phone-booth mauler. Shoots his strong hands inside and fights to keep them there. Features power, body control and hand placement to win early in the snap. Usually recognizes twists, coming off initial block to pick up twister. Despite gentle demeanor off the field, is willing to mix it up and turn a snap into a fistfight if need be. Showed off natural power in reps against Washington's Danny Shelton and Iowa's Carl Davis at Senior Bowl practices.  Weaknesses  Heavy-legged player limited to primarily power-based schemes. Small radius of effectiveness as a blocker and unable to get hands on moving targets on second level. Plays with leg stiffness and is unable to gain consistent leverage through adequate bend. Rarely low man in short-yardage scrum. Feet stall at contact. Inconsistent footwork to secure and improve his positioning. High pad level forces him to give some ground against bull rushers. Might struggle with athletic penetrators. Unable to help much in screen game.  Draft Projection  Round 3 or 4 (Good value)  Bottom Line  Converted center who has taken reps at tackle and started an entire season at guard. Limited phone-booth mauler with above-average upper-body strength and toughness at the point of attack to play in the NFL. His physical limitations could hurt his draft standing, but his functional strength and potential to swing between center and guard give him a decent shot to make it in the league.   Sounds like a solid pick."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,3,Sat May 2 17:38:31 2015 UTC,ALL HAIL THE MIGHTY LOBSTER
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,5,Sat May 2 18:16:49 2015 UTC,Lorenzo Doss??  Small guy.. maybe a returns specialist??
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,4,Sat May 2 19:02:32 2015 UTC,"Just heard a phone interview with Doss, really soft spoken. When asked if he had something to prove being from Tulane he simply said I'll just let my play do the talkin."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,2,Sat May 2 19:29:28 2015 UTC,Safe choice of words. Guess we'll see what we end up with there.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,4,Sat May 2 19:34:44 2015 UTC,...so they compare Michael Bennett to... Michael Bennett.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,4,Sat May 2 19:42:16 2015 UTC,Im excited to get 3 new players at once!!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,2,Sat May 2 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that will be pretty cool, even if they are some of the last picks in the draft -- it's like getting some of our UDFAs early!"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,4,Sat May 2 21:20:15 2015 UTC,HERE WE GO THREE IN A ROW!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,vindawg08,5,Sat May 2 22:17:48 2015 UTC,Wooo! I Love my Broncbros!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,crueg,4,Sat May 2 22:18:18 2015 UTC,k
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,5,Sat May 2 22:23:19 2015 UTC,Well there's that QB no one's ever heard of.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,4,Sat May 2 22:23:31 2015 UTC,Watched him play... Don't care for this pick...
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,3,Sat May 2 22:24:39 2015 UTC,There went TJ
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,3,Sat May 2 16:37:24 2015 UTC,"Was highly unlikely he was going to last much longer, fell way, WAY down from where everyone had him figure out to be."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,3,Sat May 2 16:38:14 2015 UTC,"So of the Top 50, only La'El Collins remains.  I wonder if anyone will even draft him."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,5,Sat May 2 16:39:43 2015 UTC,maybe in the 7th? but then again he said he wouldnt sign sooo
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,5,Sat May 2 16:40:23 2015 UTC,He may have fucked up completely. Teams won't forget this next year either. He may have fucked himself out of a career.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,2,Sat May 2 16:44:03 2015 UTC,"Yep, maybe a UDFA next year if he's lucky and has proven a change in attitude, etc."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,crueg,3,Sat May 2 16:47:58 2015 UTC,"With his agent stating he will refuse to sign a contract even if drafted after day 2, I doubt it"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,BornToulouse,2,Sat May 2 16:41:01 2015 UTC,"Ohhhh I missed that.  Yeah, he's done then.  What a damned fool.  ""If I can't make 10 million I don't want 2 million!""???"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,Theingloriousak2,2,Sat May 2 16:44:08 2015 UTC,"Pretty arrogant if you ask me. But then again until he's completely cleared with this murder stuff he is gonna be avoided, so it wasn't a bad choice for him. Hes gonna declare for the draft next year. Maybe 2nd round? 3rd?"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sat May 2 16:47:16 2015 UTC,"Yep, definitely not a first anymore."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,TweetsInCommentsBot,2,Sat May 2 16:49:47 2015 UTC,I doubt it. Didn't he say he won't even sign a contract if he was drafted this late?
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,treqos,2,Sat May 2 16:40:58 2015 UTC,Yeah
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,3,Sat May 2 16:43:35 2015 UTC,"Ok, what is the ""who day?"" thing with Cincinnati?"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,3,Sat May 2 17:04:08 2015 UTC,Typical Bengals pick there
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,CO_Boiler,3,Sat May 2 17:04:30 2015 UTC,Alright time to get weird. Someone take a punter.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,3,Sat May 2 17:13:51 2015 UTC,im looking at you Raiders...
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,3,Sat May 2 17:15:10 2015 UTC,"I dunno, it seems like someone taught them how to draft this year."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,3,Sat May 2 17:15:59 2015 UTC,"There goes Shaq Mason, so we gotta go after Dismukes or a Safety, right?"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,2,Sat May 2 17:32:13 2015 UTC,Either one id be happy with
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,3,Sat May 2 17:33:06 2015 UTC,"Max Garcia, center"
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,3,Sat May 2 17:34:37 2015 UTC,"I'm already loving the look of this rebuilt line, just need a guard to round it out."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,3,Sat May 2 17:39:37 2015 UTC,"Max Garcia is a solid center. He wasn't anything amazing at UF like DJ or the murder bros, but under kubes he could really blossom into a good center."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,coronad0,3,Sat May 2 17:42:20 2015 UTC,There goes hundley!
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,3,Sat May 2 18:14:40 2015 UTC,Hmm.  Missed Chicago taking Adrian Amos off the board.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,treqos,3,Sat May 2 18:17:25 2015 UTC,DAMN YOU JOHN FOX AGAIN
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,2,Sat May 2 18:18:15 2015 UTC,"Yeah, at least Cody Prewitt and Derron Smith are still out there."

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,3,Sat May 2 18:39:44 2015 UTC,Bennett?  Harriss?  The pick is coming up!

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,3,Sat May 2 19:07:35 2015 UTC,So I've been watching the Sambrailo Press conference... apparently he can do a backflip.  Edit: Been looking around and it may be that they were talking about a skiing backflip.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,6,Sat May 2 19:14:24 2015 UTC,damn. he's gonna be one of those dudes like jeff saturday or matt birke that just lose 100 pounds months after retiring

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,2,Sat May 2 19:18:34 2015 UTC,Look up Tom Nalen before and after
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,mdonoyan,3,Sat May 2 23:34:35 2015 UTC,Who is he
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,ThreezusManning,5,Sat May 2 20:33:03 2015 UTC,"DT out of Maryland. 43 tackles, 8 for loss, 2 sacks last year. Like 315 lbs. First year in the B1G last year and was hugely successful against good competition so not mad at all."

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,CO_Boiler,3,Sat May 2 16:36:03 2015 UTC,Damn.  No matter who took him it was going to be great value even if that fracture is so bad he can't play this year.
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,YakPineapple,2,Sat May 2 16:36:21 2015 UTC,Might be a pretty slow thread today... I'm getting some Taco Bell breakfast currently but I love me some Day 3 of the draft.

DenverBroncos,34mtj9,skullyD,2,Sat May 2 17:34:58 2015 UTC,"Yep, not a bad choice, and according to Mayock he can play all 5 spots on the line so that'll give Kubes flexibilty to move him if required."
DenverBroncos,34mtj9,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,2,Sat May 2 17:35:55 2015 UTC,"Seems to be a good scheme fit, and he can play all 5 positions on the Line. Not terrible."

DenverBroncos,34ndw5,Denver80,0,Sun May 3 03:54:21 2015 UTC,Comes off as Tony Carter to me in an honest comparison. Corner depth and if he ends up to developing more then he may come off as a surprising rotational guy.

DenverBroncos,34kurt,solsethop,3,Sat May 2 01:34:39 2015 UTC,Sambrailo was the only returning starter from the 2013 line. He was the rock. The only reason they gelled as well as they did is because of his leadership.

DenverBroncos,34kurt,OpabiniaGlasses,5,Sat May 2 01:33:19 2015 UTC,His 40 time isn't the measure of being able to move around on the line. Did you watch his highlight reel? Moves really well actually.

DenverBroncos,34kurt,bzzltyr,7,Sat May 2 02:06:01 2015 UTC,Since when does a 40 time mean anything for a lineman?

He played most of this last season with a foot injury that mainly kept him in to block. When healthy he is a solid vertical threat in the middle of the field, a good redzone weapon and an above average run blocker from that TE spot."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,SaltineStealer4,16,Sat May 2 03:38:57 2015 UTC,What is the deal with broncos and drafting foot injuries.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,wuneternalround,3,Sat May 2 03:48:45 2015 UTC,If my Buckeyes would have just shut him down for the first 6 weeks this wouldn't have been an issue. He tried to play and just never got the rest he needed. Guy was durable for the better part of his career and in a different offense would have had the numbers to be a top 40 pick.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,SaltineStealer4,4,Sat May 2 03:55:23 2015 UTC,Which ones haven't worked out??

DenverBroncos,34l66y,mrspencerrecor,6,Sat May 2 04:37:22 2015 UTC,"5, I think. Green, Duncan, Daniels, Heueueueuerman, and some other dude who was on the roster last year."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,aatencio91,2,Sat May 2 05:51:02 2015 UTC,would that other dude be Dominique Jones?
DenverBroncos,34l66y,MTLBroncos,1 point,Sat May 2 14:47:20 2015 UTC,I think so? Also I forgot they signed James Casey like a week ago.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,aatencio91,3,Sat May 2 15:41:42 2015 UTC,"Bleh. I don't hate the pick, but I really really really wanted Henry Anderson instead"
DenverBroncos,34l66y,qergttj,5,Sat May 2 07:05:39 2015 UTC,Figured 3 TE's and Duncan as wild card was enough. I really expected someone else at that pick.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,bmsuperfly,6,Sat May 2 03:08:32 2015 UTC,"There's a reason Duncan hasn't played a down in the NFL and the Broncos keep getting other tight ends. He was purely a low risk signing, but mainly they were just taking a chance. I don't think anyone should be surprised if he's let go early."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,Greeney494,0,Sat May 2 04:43:51 2015 UTC,"I'm not I expect nothing from his signing tbh. It's Green, Daniels, and Casey I thought was enough depth. Having 4 TE's on a roster isn't super uncommon, but i'm not sure if it was needed as much as another couple positions that had steal potential available at that pick.  Obviously we could knock it out of the park tomorrow and everything is great, just an observation and a opinion for now. We'll see how tomorrow shakes up."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,bmsuperfly,2,Sat May 2 04:46:43 2015 UTC,I think they drafted Daniels replacement to spell and learn from Daniels.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,Greeney494,1 point,Sat May 2 04:52:13 2015 UTC,"Yea I don't think it's a horrible pick he actually looks really good for a 3rd round TE.   I just really don't like Smith or Geno in the starting 5 of the o-line, I really expected Tre' Jackson there or Prewitt. Hopefully Elway does really well tomorrow."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,bmsuperfly,1 point,Sat May 2 04:57:45 2015 UTC,Elway has done really well.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,Greeney494,0,Sat May 2 05:04:32 2015 UTC,"Meh, 2 picks with one being considered a decent steal and a 3rd one that people may go back to not liking if the rest of the draft doesn't work out.   I'll reserve judgement until the end of the draft, but he hasn't had a bad draft since taking over so we'll see."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,bmsuperfly,2,Sat May 2 05:07:56 2015 UTC,He looks and plays strikingly similar to Joel Dreessen...
DenverBroncos,34l66y,tisiot,5,Sat May 2 16:04:43 2015 UTC,"I'm here to say that I played football with him in high school, he's always been a pretty good run blocker and has really good hands. Sometimes I felt he had a bit of an ego but I'm sure that comes with any player from a huge program. Other than that he was a pretty laid back cool guy. I had no idea that he was good enough compared to all the other tight ends in the nation but I'm happy for him."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,gatorfan45,1 point,Sat May 2 04:23:13 2015 UTC,"Im not familiar with this guy but I'm getting mixed reports on his blocking, A few sources and sites say he's a weak blocker and others like MHR says he may be one of the best blocking TE's in the 2015 draft."
DenverBroncos,34l66y,troubledhumans,1 point,Sat May 2 13:19:05 2015 UTC,Dumb pick. Best case scenario this guy is 3rd string TE. Could've found a bigger contributor in a position of need
DenverBroncos,34l66y,peaceblaster68,2,Sat May 2 17:05:46 2015 UTC,He apparently was the highest guy on our draft board at the time so it definitely was a BPA pick.
DenverBroncos,34l66y,njm1314,3,Sat May 2 17:08:40 2015 UTC,I don't know about that one. Last time we drafted a TE who didn't do much catching it didn't end well.

DenverBroncos,34l66y,FNG_WolfKnight,1 point,Sat May 2 03:14:09 2015 UTC,I saw Heuerman in one game (vs Penn St I think) and he looked great. But that was only one game. Hes big brute-like. I like him. I'm a fan of te pick. I kind of expected a mid round TE
DenverBroncos,34l66y,yosterstrudle,1 point,Sat May 2 03:20:21 2015 UTC,I was hoping to see us pick a Safety but ad always in Elway we trust
DenverBroncos,34l66y,PMeist,1 point,Sat May 2 03:25:03 2015 UTC,Let's just hope the front office knows what they are doing. They haven't lead us astray yet and this has potential to be a pretty good pick. Let's hope in the final rounds we can pick up more quality players for both lines.
DenverBroncos,34kuvk,baha24,21,Sat May 2 01:10:09 2015 UTC,He's thinking about playing CHJ

DenverBroncos,34l5e5,Puffy_Ghost,5,Sat May 2 03:31:06 2015 UTC,I honest to god thought we were gonna take La'el or TJ. It seemed too good to be true that they'd fallen this far
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,bentoboxbarry,6,Sat May 2 03:03:39 2015 UTC,I did too. I had it in my head when TJ fell that he was all ours. Apparently your mind and my mind aren't anything like Elway's lol
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,Tlwofford,4,Sat May 2 03:05:59 2015 UTC,To everyone freaking out:  Relax for fuck's sake. How often does a late 3rd rounder make an immediate impact? We drafted Schofield last year in the 3rd. He could shine this year.  There's probably a reason we aren't picking TJ or Collins. Did you hear that apparently Collins is going to refuse to sign a contract with whoever picks him now and sit out a year to declare for next years draft? How does that make any sense? And apparently TJ has a stress fracture in his foot. I'm sure these guys know more about what's actually going on than we do.
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,AB444,3,Sat May 2 10:03:12 2015 UTC,...I don't understand this. Aren't we set at TE?

DenverBroncos,34l5e5,blarlan,2,Sat May 2 03:08:15 2015 UTC,ding ding ding. Everyone thinking Joe Don Duncan is some diamond in the rough that would blossom. The Broncos are just taking a chance.

TE is a definitely a need. I'm just not sure about taking one in the third round."
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,Tagov,2,Sat May 2 03:09:46 2015 UTC,I agree with you. TE is a need but why in the third? Why not take a chance on a OL and find another TE later than will probably be every bit as good/productive as this guy.
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,PMeist,1 point,Sat May 2 03:15:38 2015 UTC,"We now 5 TE's...how is TE a need? Sure Daniels is getting old, but we could address TE next year with the list of guys we already have. With the OL guys that were still on the board it doesn't make sense to get a TE here."

DenverBroncos,34l5e5,ncosta197,0,Sat May 2 03:30:40 2015 UTC,Or maybe ILB isn't a need and Paul Dawson interviewed very poorly?
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,troubledhumans,1 point,Sat May 2 14:57:28 2015 UTC,ugh.
DenverBroncos,34l5e5,FootballMan15,0,Sat May 2 04:51:18 2015 UTC,"Looks like we picked him up for his blocking since Kubiak is most likely gonna want to run the ball more. He's decent at blocking. He's gonna have to become a hell of a lot more aggressive if he's gonna be blocking in the NFL. When he engages with a defender his feet kind of go dead and he starts just trying to position block with his body. But we have a new member in the Broncos family and I'm excited about that. Hopefully he can have a nice, long productive career in Denver. Go Broncos!"
DenverBroncos,34kv3a,treqos,5,Sat May 2 01:12:21 2015 UTC,"I like the pick and really want it to work out, but portions of this video I thought I was watching highlights for the Utah DE."
DenverBroncos,34kv3a,gwalstad,4,Sat May 2 05:33:06 2015 UTC,"You have to realize though that most of these plays were against Nate Orchard who was picked in this draft 51st overall. And really his biggest knock was his run defense, not his pass rushing skills.  ""If you ask the linemen in the Pac-12 who they thought was the toughest guy to block, it was Nate Orchard."" -- Mike Mayock  Not to mention this showed I think every play he was on the field? So not too bad overall against an NFL level talent."

DenverBroncos,34kv3a,fernando_69,4,Tue May 5 14:51:22 2015 UTC,"Definitely see a lot of good things.  Great hustle, very mobile for his size and it seems like he doesn't take plays off. I like how he is always searching for contact.  Some cons in pass protection though, he like to bring his head down and looks a bit stiff in his hips.  Overall I would say this is a great pick just because of our system, we need a player like that for the ZBS, but we probably could've gotten him later."
DenverBroncos,34kv3a,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,1 point,Sat May 2 02:18:38 2015 UTC,Sambrailo has basically been a consensus 2nd rounder for months now. I don't know where all of this talk about him being a reach is coming from - it's very likely he wouldn't be there in the 3rd.

You can't teach that anger and that drive, and he has it in spades."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,codepoet2,1 point,Fri May 1 17:51:11 2015 UTC,"Yes.  I was excited to this pick due to this here. The last number of years I've felt the Broncos defense has had many highly skilled players, but always lacked that guy with the attitude that rallies everyone else during a game.  I am hoping that Ray will be that guy."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,gwalstad,12,Fri May 1 21:30:47 2015 UTC,Sometimes can get a bit to violent but doesn’t create penalties  Weakness?
DenverBroncos,34jc21,TDenverFan,9,Fri May 1 17:40:34 2015 UTC,"Shoulda worded that better, not creating penalties is a strength but when he gets a bit violent he's suspect to a bad penalty here or there."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,TDenverFan,2,Fri May 1 17:54:36 2015 UTC,Our D could use a little more toughness. Not sure an occasional penalty like that is awful

DenverBroncos,34jc21,solsethop,6,Fri May 1 18:48:50 2015 UTC,Thanks for all the work you put into this. This is the stuff I was trying to find last night when we made the pick. I really hope Von and Demarcus pull him in under their wing from the start and they become the Unholy Trinity.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,thiscouldbeben,10,Fri May 1 18:03:49 2015 UTC,Looks like a Von Killer
DenverBroncos,34jc21,Puffy_Ghost,5,Fri May 1 18:05:34 2015 UTC,I am watching his film and I can't get over how aggressively he attacks every play. Every play he looks like he literally wants to kill the quarterback. He flies off the line and tries to hit as hard as he fucking can every hit. I am pumped.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,tisiot,1 point,Fri May 1 20:24:53 2015 UTC,"He doesn't take plays off like other D-Lineman, I love this pick.  I'm also a Mizzou fan so I might be biased."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,FNG_WolfKnight,1 point,Sat May 2 00:02:13 2015 UTC,"My only concerns are that he has very little experience in coverage, and he's not great against the run.    We didn't really pick him for those things though, so they're areas that can be worked on in the long run.   I'm looking forward to a 3 headed QB rushing beast this year.  Should be epic."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,1 point,Sat May 2 00:32:58 2015 UTC,3T? Try 7 8 or 9T
DenverBroncos,34jc21,NorthHighBears,1 point,Sat May 2 01:46:23 2015 UTC,"Thinking about it, Wolfe will be moving back to DT, his drafted position, from DE. We lost Jackson, so that was another hole. I like the pick. Put him and Von as OLBs and keep Ware on the line as a true DE. Its going to get nasty out there. we just need a good ""centerfielding"" safety and we'll be golden.   But I am a bit curious as to why we didn't address out O-Line with this pick. Maybe Ray was a ""dream"" pick on Elway's big board and he fell in our favor. Im guessing the next 2 picks are O-Line and TE."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,2,Fri May 1 23:28:59 2015 UTC,"This isn't quite correct.  We are switching to a 3-4 front. Wolfe is moving to his natural position of 3-4 DE, which is essentially a DT but kind of a tweener. We didn't lose Jackson, he'll be the other DE. Sly Will or a rookie will be our NT. Ware and Von are our OLBs and I expect Ray to spell both of them at times, but mostly Ware."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,CO_Boiler,-4,Fri May 1 23:53:44 2015 UTC,"We came into the draft desperate for o-line help. We leave the first round with 1 less starting offensive lineman. I'm pissed, but I'm glad the team didn't give into the glaring need and suffer a case of tunnel vision. About Ray? He seems skinny and i'm not confident he'll have the size and strength to compete in the NFL. His dad was a pro and turned into a career fuckup. Ray Jr already proved he's lacking some basic intelligence pre-draft. He seems fiery on the highlight videos, but also seems to come in high on tackles. Pros will prob shake those hits off. I'm not feeling good about this. On a scale of 1-10, I'd give the pick about a 4. Roby would have been about an 8 last year due to the value at such a late pick. For reference, I would have given Tebow a 2 due to trading away picks to grab him in the 1st when every draftnik had hime going 3rd rd.  EDIT: Thanks for the write-up and indeed ... fuck the rest of the AFC West."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,4,Fri May 1 17:58:21 2015 UTC,"He received a 20 on his Wonderlic, which is above average at his position. By all accounts he plays with fire and rarely takes bad penalties. A slip up with weed is nothing worth stressing. You give Roby an 8, but his ""dwi"" issue was part of what made him slip."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,CO_Boiler,-5,Fri May 1 18:25:19 2015 UTC,"I don't put much weight on the weed thing alone. His family history, timing of the slip, and the fact that Denver traded away a starting caliber guard when our line was the worst unit last year are what makes it a bad move IMO. I felt lucky that Roby was there at 31 last year and Denver didn't give up anything to get him."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,4,Fri May 1 18:53:21 2015 UTC,"No. Ramirez was not a starting caliber guard for this scheme. Him not being on the team has been painted on the wall for weeks with the signing of Shelly, and Gradkowski, and the trumpet sounding of Garland, Paradis, and Schofield. And this issue that he had is no different than Roby. And relative quality of talent to where we drafted them is much the same. Meaning Roby did not have a top ten or even to 15 grade, and we took him 31, or roughly 10-13 picks below where he was graded. Meanwhile Ray was graded exactly #10 on the Broncos board according to Elway, and we took him 13 picks below that.   We gained 3 mil, we saved cap on the draft pick, we got a huge talent, and we got something out of someone who want going to be on the team, and we got a guy at an extreme value."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,Neverethe,0,Fri May 1 19:12:49 2015 UTC,"I hadn't considered the cap savings. That's at least one positive thing. I'm not buying the Manny being garbage thing though. He was banged up last year, partially thanks to how Ball liked to plow into linemen from behind, and was solid the year before. People were saying Lepsis was overrated last year and he ended up looking good for the Jags."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,aatencio91,3,Fri May 1 19:25:18 2015 UTC,"Well Ramirez never was on the injury list I believe. Vasquez and Clady were after Ball smoking them. But Ramirez was moved off of the center spot for a reason, he can't snap a good ball and still get to his blocks. He is a mauler that lacks the foot work for zone blocking. And if the signing of those two guys didn't paint on the wall what was happening I don't know what else would. We still have Garland, Shelly, Gradkowski, Paradis, and Vasquez as interior linemen plus the possibility of drafting somebody, that is not a thin line."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,3,Fri May 1 19:44:36 2015 UTC,"You're right, I was thinking about Vasquez' injury. Hmm ... maybe Manny did just suck balls because he sucked balls last year."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,aatencio91,2,Fri May 1 20:07:35 2015 UTC,Really? His family history? Lol.   You know people aren't guaranteed to follow in the footsteps of their father. Right? He's completely different than his father and is fiery BECAUSE of the shit his father did to him.  Get off of it.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,5,Fri May 1 20:44:21 2015 UTC,"Clemmings, Fisher, Collins (maybe), Grasu, Dismukes, Matias, and so many other guys are still available. The Broncos will have a studly offensive line under Kubes and Dennison, and the guys who will make up that line are on the roster or will be on the board when the Broncos pick."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,aatencio91,-1,Fri May 1 18:30:42 2015 UTC,I feel like I'm banking on Kubes/Dennison making a a miracle happen just like I was banking on the Clark/Franklin shift to pay off last year.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,crueg,3,Fri May 1 18:55:22 2015 UTC,But Kubes/Dennison have a track record of good/great offensive lines.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,vecchiobronco,-2,Fri May 1 18:58:22 2015 UTC,Can't argue with that. All I'm left with are last year's shitballs and a handful of hope though. A few sexy plump college linemen would help me get a little harder about a turnaround in 2015.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,3,Fri May 1 19:01:15 2015 UTC,"Like I said, there are plenty of guys who are still on the board (and who should be when Denver picks in the 2nd and 3rd). I'm hopeful. My thoughts heading into round one were that the Broncos could play around and do something sexy with the 1st rounder, then get down to serious business with rounds 2 and 3."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,vecchiobronco,5,Fri May 1 19:03:32 2015 UTC,"the downvoting in this sub is absurd, all of your concerns are completely valid. we still don't have a replacement for manny yet and i think oline was a much higher need than a rotational de/olb."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,7,Fri May 1 20:14:54 2015 UTC,"Some counter points:  According to almost everyone Manny was getting cut, he was not a starter anymore.  Shane Ray is 6'3"" 245, in what world is that skinny? That's huge. The same measurements as a certain Von Miller actually.   Shane Ray was an almost unanimous top-10 talent prior to his minor incident monday.   Starting O-Line talent is found outside the first round all the time. There were 6 OL pro-bowlers this year that were drafted outside the first round.   Shane Ray plays with a bigger chip on his shoulder than anyone in the draft this year. He knows better than anyone how big of a fuckup his father is, and he has dedicated his life to being both a better man and a better football player than his father. Don't let one small mistake cloud your vision, because it isn't clouding his.   TL;DR: Don't worry so much, Elway and Kubiak are smart and have a plan."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,vecchiobronco,-3,Fri May 1 19:15:25 2015 UTC,"6'3"" and 245 lb is not huge for a guy who's going to prob be used mostly as an edge rusher, more like a DE. He's lanky, but young. He could gain some size. I don't think he'll be a major factor for the team until he does. Seems just big enough to be a liability in coverage."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,bentoboxbarry,6,Fri May 1 19:28:36 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why you have concerns with his size, it makes zero sense. He has prototypical size for his position. His combine measurables size up almost exactly with elite players at his position... Justin Houston - 6'3 250, Von Miller 6'3"" 250, Cameron Wake 6'3"" 236 Clay Matthews 6'3"" 240, Brian Orakpo 6'3"" 255, Connor Barwin 6'4 255, Robert Mathis 6'2"" 245, Ahmad Brooks 6'4"" 250... The list keeps going but you get the point, size is not a problem for Shane Ray."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,mack2nite,1 point,Fri May 1 19:46:45 2015 UTC,"A few of those guys have put the work in and become bigger. TBH I had no idea Wake was that small. Looks can be deceiving because he appears like a monster on the field. As far as Ray goes, I haven't seen any video that makes me think he has the same set of talents as a Von or Houston. If he can cover and play the run well, then that's a good size. If he's going to predominantly line up and rush the QB, then I think it's fair to look at him as an undersized DE."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,bentoboxbarry,2,Fri May 1 20:04:04 2015 UTC,"No worries man, you are just trying to compare polished NFL players to a kid that just got drafted I'll just let you know that you are saying word for word what people said about Von.   And that's not fair because he's an OLB, not a DE..."
DenverBroncos,34jc21,crueg,1 point,Sat May 2 04:57:36 2015 UTC,already proved he's lacking some basic intelligence   What? Have you never made a mistake in your life? That warrants judging someone as lacking basic intelligence? Watching Broncos fans freak out after the first round after we got an absolute steal of pass rusher (top 10 for pick 23? That's AWESOME) is hilarious.
DenverBroncos,34jc21,CO_Boiler,1 point,Fri May 1 19:56:42 2015 UTC,"Or is it more hilarious that one Broncos fan who questions the move is downvoted by a hoard of orange and blue lemmings? I root for the team, but I should be able to voice some concerns."

DenverBroncos,34khef,skullyD,3,Sat May 2 01:29:40 2015 UTC,"@johnelway   2015-05-02 01:28 UTC  OT Ty Sambrailo, our 2nd rd pick from CSU, really fits our system. We expect him to come in and compete for a starting job at right tackle.     This message was created by a bot  [Contact creator][Source code]"
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,CO_Boiler,25,Fri May 1 19:38:44 2015 UTC,"It's so weird that last Friday, if you were to tell Broncos fans that there was a legitimate chance of the Broncos taking Ray and all they had to give was a 5th this year and next year and Ramirez, I don't know who wouldn't want that.  He fucked up with the weed possession. but once again, it wasn't in his system, he just had it in his possession. People forget Roby got a DUI two weeks before the draft last year.   I think this is an incredible pick up, and something tells me that if the Seahawks or Patriots pulled the same move and gave up the same thing, fans and media would be losing their shit at how ""Billichek/Carroll know how the draft works. They'll get this guy into a winning organization and he'll thrive."" Not in Denver for some reason."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,Greeney494,5,Fri May 1 20:15:33 2015 UTC,"You're absolutely right. Then again, only time will tell. If Ray becomes a drug policy problem and serves games under suspension, the ""I told you so"" team will come out in force. If nothing happens, they'll say it was a win-win for both sides, and the Broncos didn't really do anything great."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,strizzle_work,2,Fri May 1 21:03:21 2015 UTC,"I have a feeling with the new policies of the NFL, you are really going to see weed suspensions disappear completely. It is absurd and everyone knows it. Look at the NBA, weed isn't tested for at all and no one even notices or cares."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,gwalstad,1 point,Sat May 2 04:44:10 2015 UTC,"The Von thing was a way bigger deal and we still have him, and he's still destroying QBs for us. At least for now it seems like this kid learned his lesson at the right time."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,__KODY__,2,Sun May 3 03:58:23 2015 UTC,This Von Miller?
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,von_bot,1 point,Sun May 3 03:58:26 2015 UTC,"Hahaha yes,  that very one.  Amazing."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,__KODY__,1 point,Sun May 3 04:07:18 2015 UTC,Yeah but there were some people that straight up wanted to get rid of Von which was also way way sad.
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,Greeney494,1 point,Sun May 3 06:30:08 2015 UTC,"There will always be people like that. What confuses me is keeping Von but cutting Prater. I guess we just didn't want to pay him, mainly.   But the NFL is so bogus when it comes to players getting in trouble. One team cuts the guy only for another team to pick him up. They'll say some BS about wanting character guys and then go right out and pick up someone who just got caught doing something or other."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,__KODY__,1 point,Sun May 3 07:25:32 2015 UTC,"We all know teams will choose talent over basically everything else. And unfortunately for Prater, he was just a kicker."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,Greeney494,3,Sun May 3 16:24:39 2015 UTC,"I really like this pick! I've said something similar in other posts but I think we have to remember that all this is according to the Broncos draft board. They probably didn't have anyone on their board left that they felt was worth a 1st round pick, so at this they had three options at 28 reach for someone they considered a 2nd round player, try and find a trade partner and move down (not a given that they could find good value for their pick) or trade up and get a player they had high on their board and do so without it costing an arm and a leg. The problem with drafting need instead of BPA in my opinion is that you may still have a good chance of ending up with a bust and you are still no better off, now to be fair that can, and does happen when you draft BPA but your scouts say that this guy has the best chance to be an NFL quality player and that will always make your team better. Ray has a ton of potential, and if he lives up to it we will have one of the nastiest D-lines in the NFL. We hardly had to give up anything to move up and grab him, and there are still quality linemen out there to be had."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,Twizzle-dizzle,2,Fri May 1 20:33:25 2015 UTC,"Seriously, Leonard Williams and Devin Smith? Post-Idzik they aren't fucking around and need to be cooled."
DenverBroncos,34jtvk,Starbucks_Lovers,1 point,Sat May 2 03:04:50 2015 UTC,"You are right, we gave up almost nothing.  5 round picks and a 2nd/3rd stringer (on any team with a good line) who comes with a $3mil cap hit... Using Manny as trade bait instead of waiting to cut him in a month or two is a GREAT move.    Anyone not understanding how we were BIG winners last night is simply not taking the time to look at this objectively."
DenverBroncos,34jo28,Occams_Lazor_,12,Fri May 1 18:51:26 2015 UTC,The article is def pulling at some invisible strings but I didn't realize how similar their stats were
DenverBroncos,34jo28,green_orb,4,Fri May 1 19:00:36 2015 UTC,"Thing is though, Sam was mostly utilized in a Wide 9 that masked some of his athletic deficiencies. The combine measurements aren't really valid either, Ray was injured and still ran the 40."
DenverBroncos,34jo28,jfrayquo,2,Fri May 1 19:13:04 2015 UTC,There is a pretty huge gap that the author covered up by not mentioning those are Sam's stats after playing for 4 years compared to Ray's stats for 3.
DenverBroncos,34jo28,lsjunior,3,Fri May 1 22:39:45 2015 UTC,Ray also only started his last year.
DenverBroncos,34jo28,green_orb,3,Fri May 1 23:16:32 2015 UTC,Oh yeah that's a huge difference!
DenverBroncos,34jo28,CO_Boiler,5,Fri May 1 22:44:52 2015 UTC,"One thing that should have been mentioned was one of Sam's scores came because Ray smoked past the left tackle and crushed the QB, and the ball bounced right to Sam, who hadn't been able to get past the right tackle at all."
DenverBroncos,34jo28,YakPineapple,3,Fri May 1 19:49:36 2015 UTC,"I feel like this is really surface level stuff that they just picked because they were areas where the two were similar... Is there homophobia in the NFL? Most certainly.  There's homophobia in basically any work place still.  It sucks and I think it's changing over time, but this article is not good, just choosing a few stats that are similar when that's not all scouts look at.  I like that this community exists and hope that more gay athletes come out but I don't think this article is proving anything.   Just my two cents."
DenverBroncos,34jo28,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 22:06:27 2015 UTC,This article...
DenverBroncos,34jo28,Puffy_Ghost,2,Fri May 1 18:55:20 2015 UTC,"Ray is a better athlete, has a better first step, is a better rusher, is faster, and shows better awareness. Not to mention the all time sack leader at Mizz, and SEC defensive player of the year.   Sam was a good player, but if he were 1st or 2nd round good, he would have been taken then."
DenverBroncos,34j95n,xxbeanstaxx,6,Fri May 1 16:53:58 2015 UTC,"There's a spot ready, they'll get to it soon. In the meantime, /u/ThreezusManning made a table of each pick in the draft thread"
DenverBroncos,34j95n,crueg,2,Fri May 1 17:15:22 2015 UTC,cool thanks
DenverBroncos,34isww,rasnyder34,10,Fri May 1 14:47:56 2015 UTC,"For those of you who don't want to open the link,    ""A first-time offense lands the player in the substance abuse program without a suspension. The primary difference is the punishment for a second positive test: simply a two-game fine. Each additional violation receives the following progressive discipline: four-game fine, four-game suspension, 10-game suspension. A player can therefore test positive for marijuana three times without getting suspended."""
DenverBroncos,34isww,Greeney494,4,Fri May 1 15:40:39 2015 UTC,"It's also important to note that he did not have any in his system, rather just in his possession. I'm not saying he didn't have plans to smoke it, I'm just saying if it wasn't in his system, there could be other reasons for him having it."
DenverBroncos,34isww,bebaker,2,Fri May 1 15:26:13 2015 UTC,In his defense he was just holding it for a friend.

DenverBroncos,34h775,MurrayPloppins,21,Fri May 1 03:17:15 2015 UTC,"Dude, Gurley was the last guy we expected to grab in the first round... but I'm excited as hell about it.   Let the Rams and the Broncos meet in the Super Bowl this year. The Pass rush and run game vs. Manning and... the pass rush I guess.   Wait. Fuck."
DenverBroncos,34h775,PMeist,2,Fri May 1 04:08:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah the Gurley pick was a total surprise to me. No doubt he's talented, but between Stacy and Mason, it seemed like you guys would easily find a way to get functional production out of your running game. And with the WR depth in this class, picking up a weapon for Foles would have made much more sense. The Rams' FO must see something in Gurley that makes them think he's a generational talent. And hell, maybe he is."
DenverBroncos,34h775,hayclaylaybaymaysay,3,Fri May 1 06:14:08 2015 UTC,"What no one wants to recognize is that we ran the ball a shit ton last year because we didn't have a starting QB. Mason ran a few huge games against some straight shit teams.   The best kept secret about Stacy is that he has been totally irrelevant since 2013. Cunningham is currently our #2 guy and has been since early 2014. We really only have one perennial starter right now out RB in Tre Mason.   RB wasn't a ""need"", but we certainly weren't ""stacked"" at the position like many people have said."
DenverBroncos,34h775,epgenius,1 point,Fri May 1 06:17:13 2015 UTC,"Stacked, certainly not, but with great OTs and WRs on the board, it's a bold pick. Hell, maybe they're not sold on Mason."
DenverBroncos,34h775,Blacky31,1 point,Fri May 1 06:23:58 2015 UTC,They're not sold on Mason because he refuses to protect the QB. His pass protection is beyond atrocious. As in he doesn't he give it an honest effort.
DenverBroncos,34h775,anbujar,6,Fri May 1 06:25:38 2015 UTC,Definitely a fair reason to criticize a RB. It was an issue for us for sure. Peyton hates it when RBs can't pass protect.
DenverBroncos,34h775,vindawg08,1 point,Fri May 1 06:37:57 2015 UTC,We had a TE last season we let walk to Jacksonville because of atrocious blocking.
DenverBroncos,34h775,TheClayroo,-1,Fri May 1 08:54:26 2015 UTC,I actually hate it when we face NFC West teams in the super bowl. Typically we get smoked.
DenverBroncos,34h775,vindawg08,2,Fri May 1 04:24:43 2015 UTC,Well we will gladly smoke your ass if we can. But our secondary would turn to noodles against Manning.

DenverBroncos,34h775,painaulevain,8,Fri May 1 13:51:27 2015 UTC,According to douchebag Bryan Fischer at nfl.com the Broncos had the third worst pick of the first round.  This was a great pick in my opinion and I can't wait to watch our defense this year
DenverBroncos,34h775,aatencio91,5,Fri May 1 05:40:21 2015 UTC,Bryan Fisher has never witnessed a Mizzou 3rd down on D.

DenverBroncos,34h775,aatencio91,2,Fri May 1 09:00:09 2015 UTC,I hope you are right we had problems getting off the field on 3rd down.
DenverBroncos,34h775,undergrdvoices93,0,Fri May 1 14:40:02 2015 UTC,Who cares what the analysts say? I care about what the decision makers of organizations say and Elway made it clear this guy is the right decision. And really how could he not be (at this point)?
DenverBroncos,34h775,vindawg08,11,Fri May 1 08:59:19 2015 UTC,Thoughts on his injury status and legal issues? Has he ever been an issue on either ends in his time at Mizzou?
DenverBroncos,34h775,HES_A_RANGA,19,Fri May 1 03:09:01 2015 UTC,"Never. I don't think he missed a game at Mizzou. And his injury didn't even need surgery.   Legal issues... I don't know. I'm of the mind weed is less serious than alcohol, it's just illegal. It looks like he wasn't in trouble for intent to distribute. He or some friends (or both) had a small amount in the car at the time.   If your front office can make him understand how serious it is not to get into one of those situations, then you'll be fine."
DenverBroncos,34h775,skullyD,8,Fri May 1 03:12:16 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info!  That makes me happy to hear about not missing a game. He sounds like a good kid, he spoke well when he was interviewed. Maybe he was just in the wrong place at the wrong time, I don't think he'll make anymore mistakes like that.  John Elway is a very ""Don't Fuck around"" kinda guy, he doesn't take that shit. Plus, alongside Von who also had some drug issues and Ware who is a great player and character guy, maybe he'll grow into something special.  I have no doubts about his play ability, I don't think anyone does. It's just scaring some fans due to his recent legal issue, we've had our fair share of those here (Welker/Von)."

He's never tested positive before and he's never had known issues like this, so I'm not too concerned about it. Ware has kept Von in check, now I believe that becoming a mentor is the next step in Von's maturation process. My hopes are that Von and Ray are a nightmare tandem for a decade."

DenverBroncos,34l1gp,Greeney494,5,Sat May 2 04:32:01 2015 UTC,Saints took Grayson :'(
DenverBroncos,34l1gp,bentoboxbarry,4,Sat May 2 02:40:38 2015 UTC,"I really liked Grayson, would have liked to see him as a Bronco"
DenverBroncos,34l1gp,aatencio91,2,Sat May 2 02:43:33 2015 UTC,I'll still cheer for him. He's in a great position to be Brees' heir.
DenverBroncos,34l1gp,PMeist,2,Sat May 2 06:40:30 2015 UTC,"No thanks. Too many other areas of need and would rather see a offensive lineman, defensive lineman, or tight end before a QB. We already have 3 on the roster and too many question marks there as it is."
DenverBroncos,34jw3p,SonicSC,5,Fri May 1 19:56:48 2015 UTC,"Based on his statement of #10 on their board, I'd have to say he's the 10th best player in the draft for the Broncos.  Makes me wonder who they had at #1 and what the asking price to trade up for that guy was."
DenverBroncos,34jw3p,SuburbanHell,6,Fri May 1 19:58:02 2015 UTC,"It could well be that in #1-9 were guys they knew they weren't going to get but still had rated, like Winston, Mariota, Leonard Williams, and guys that were picked like Cam Erving, Brandon Scherff, etc."
DenverBroncos,34jw3p,aatencio91,5,Fri May 1 20:49:08 2015 UTC,Not a dumb question at all.
DenverBroncos,34jw3p,dlevine09,2,Fri May 1 23:01:15 2015 UTC,I wondered this today as well! Wish they would supply the top 10. Good Question.
DenverBroncos,34jw3p,Anteup21,4,Sat May 2 05:22:53 2015 UTC,"He was their 10th choice. So, yes, it does account for need. But Mariota or Winston was probably above Ray on their board."
DenverBroncos,34is15,baha24,3,Fri May 1 14:40:37 2015 UTC,"Damn, he's way more mature than his dad. If he stays motivated and dedicated and humble like he appears, I think we could have a scary good 3rd and long D this year and the next few years."
DenverBroncos,34gr01,Corrupted_Engineer,50,Fri May 1 00:36:37 2015 UTC,i hope the first pass to cooper in the broncos game is a pick 6 from CHJ

DenverBroncos,34gr01,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Fri May 1 12:10:08 2015 UTC,"This is why he's my favorite.  Well, one of several reasons.  I thought he'd be great when we snagged him undrafted after watching his first preseason.  Said the same thing about Anderson and Thompson.  Starting to get a knack for this."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,The_sweat,34,Fri May 1 02:36:58 2015 UTC,"I don't care about his off the field issues, Von was the same. Hopefully his desire to win will overwhelm his desire to get high (as with Von).   He seems like an excellent pass rusher and can replace Ware when he retires (as a Bronco, suck it Cowboys fans)."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Corrupted_Engineer,70,Fri May 1 02:44:45 2015 UTC,What a Vonster
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,von_bot,21,Fri May 1 02:46:22 2015 UTC,I will never not upvote you

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Von_Miller,75,Fri May 1 19:14:43 2015 UTC,"If you ask Shane Ray to pass rush, he will pass rush. Ray is gonna sack the quarterback for you, no doubt in my mind."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Vanscoten,29,Fri May 1 02:38:19 2015 UTC,"I will take any St. Louis fans perspective on pass rushing without a question, you guys have a DL factory out there."

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,hail_satan666,2,Fri May 1 15:50:58 2015 UTC,God I hope you guys don't get moved to our division. Playing you once every 4 years is enough
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Novh,21,Fri May 1 21:20:01 2015 UTC,Lions fan here. Is Ramirez any good?
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Bradyta,53,Fri May 1 02:38:23 2015 UTC,He's okay.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Novh,15,Fri May 1 02:39:09 2015 UTC,Ok that makes me happy that he's at least average. We currently only have like 2 guards on our roster right now so glad we got some more picks + a guard.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,bmsuperfly,17,Fri May 1 02:40:35 2015 UTC,"He's starter worthy, he might have been cut for salary later on after the draft. Works out for both teams we'll take it."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,BornToulouse,5,Fri May 1 02:41:42 2015 UTC,"Good in pass protection; big strong guy. Not too agile which hinders him in run blocking, perhaps that's why he was seen as expendable."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,bender0877,6,Fri May 1 02:55:22 2015 UTC,"Right, he's a good pass protector in a man blocking scheme, but with zone blocking, I don't think he is agile enough, as we saw in the run game last year."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Crosshare,1 point,Fri May 1 03:17:15 2015 UTC,"If you guys are running a power blocking scheme he can a solid starter at Center.  Like Mark Schlereth said, he doesn't have fast enough feet to play guard at a high level."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,bgzlvsdmb,22,Fri May 1 16:38:04 2015 UTC,He gets pissed off at kickers that miss field goals pretty easily
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,GotRiskyNewAccount,12,Fri May 1 02:52:35 2015 UTC,Who wasn't pissed after that miss?

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,WhiskeyWizerd,8,Fri May 1 17:06:49 2015 UTC,... Didn't Manny Ramirez play for the Lions before he came to Denver?
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Novh,2,Fri May 1 02:47:53 2015 UTC,For i think like half a season. I remember we drafted him though
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,WhiskeyWizerd,3,Fri May 1 02:50:09 2015 UTC,He played in 18 games.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Novh,1 point,Fri May 1 02:57:28 2015 UTC,ahh thought it was a lot less.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,asdechl,3,Fri May 1 02:59:20 2015 UTC,"I'd say he's a solid offensive lineman. Not super athletic, more of a strong mauler."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,isthatmyex,5,Fri May 1 02:43:45 2015 UTC,He's been great and he's been a liability. He can play C or G. Which to me makes him a quality backup. He's expendable to the Broncos due to the switch back to zone blocking. He does not have the required quick feet.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,fjord104,7,Fri May 1 02:55:56 2015 UTC,On the decline for sure.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,I_Drink_Piss,9,Fri May 1 02:39:47 2015 UTC,He snapped the safety.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,SmartToaster,12,Fri May 1 02:51:08 2015 UTC,What safety? I don't remember any safety. Do you guys know what he's talking about?

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,RifleTower,2,Fri May 1 02:58:03 2015 UTC,He snapped the ball that went over Mannings head the first play to start the night off right.

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,natziel,2,Fri May 1 19:40:39 2015 UTC,Y'all saw something you liked in him and that's what matters. He wasn't great for us but obviously your staff thinks they can get something out of him
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,YakPineapple,1 point,Fri May 1 02:40:37 2015 UTC,I'll miss him. I'll never forget how much Gruden loved him in the 13 season.

He gets to grow and mature under veteran leadership in Kubiak, Wade Phillips, and Demarcus Ware. Learning from Von, his idol, is a dream come true for him. He will play his heart out for us every down."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,greywolf2155,35,Fri May 1 02:45:38 2015 UTC,"Man I dunno . . . I love this guy, I think he can be a hell of a player. But we need OLine help, pretty much everyone had us taking OLine in the first round . . . and instead we gave up a solid OLine starter in order to draft a DE? I mean, wow, this makes me nervous"
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,s460,23,Fri May 1 02:38:53 2015 UTC,Maybe Schofield and Paradis really impressed Kubiak.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,greywolf2155,10,Fri May 1 02:41:44 2015 UTC,"Yup.  And presumably they think it's a deep draft on the line and they can pick up good linemen later  Although shit, lot of linemen going . . . Hrm"
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,ramblin_gamblin,6,Fri May 1 02:43:41 2015 UTC,Player with upside of Ray is hard to turn down. He gives it his all and we needed another pass rusher.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,greywolf2155,2,Fri May 1 02:47:12 2015 UTC,"Agreed, great player to grab and I'm not mad.  I'm just worried about giving up a starter at a position of need"
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,bmsuperfly,10,Fri May 1 02:52:19 2015 UTC,Manny free'd up 3m in salary. It's okay take Grasu and Collins late in the draft #believe.

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,greywolf2155,3,Fri May 1 02:53:20 2015 UTC,That's a pretty weak argument . . . just because we got lucky and had some great guys come to us for value doesn't mean it's easy to do
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Greeney494,10,Fri May 1 02:57:27 2015 UTC,"Zone blocking scheme doesn't call for great Olineman. Can't name a Houston or Baltimore OL but Arian Foster and Justin Forsett still had 1,000 yard seasons."

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,ir3flex,0,Fri May 1 04:43:38 2015 UTC,"I agree with your sentiment, but1000 yard seasons are not impressive. Thats only 62 ypg."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Crosshare,1 point,Fri May 1 03:49:19 2015 UTC,That argument goes beyond Denver's example though.  If you go back and look at draft history a ton of perennial pro bowl o-line talent is taken between rounds 3-6.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Djackso,5,Fri May 1 16:36:40 2015 UTC,"Kubs got this...him and shanahan were known for taking nobody o linemen and turning them into probowlers. Best player available...

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Uhtred_Uhtredson,2,Fri May 1 03:27:46 2015 UTC,Manny does not equal a solid starter.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,thekingearl,3,Fri May 1 03:21:49 2015 UTC,"I think this is solidly a opportunity gamble. Ray was a projected top ten on many boards, who started falling because of his weed issue situation this week. Take an o-lineman in a safe pick or roll the dice that you're getting a talent that shouldn't be there if we only look at football. More non-pans than hits picking anywhere in the draft so I like the dice roll."

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,cobras89,2,Fri May 1 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"Oh, I agree completely. We need new offensive lineman, particularly athletic ones. I'm just worried we won't be able to find 3 good ones before the start of the season"
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,cmspunk,8,Fri May 1 04:28:05 2015 UTC,"Huh. If this guy can play to his potential, our Dline is gonna be scary good. But I'm not sue we really needed to trade up for a DE when our Oline needs help."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,OpabiniaGlasses,8,Fri May 1 02:40:09 2015 UTC,"When Erving went I was just happy with BPA.  I was definitely more happy with Ray than Gregory, so I'm pretty delighted. I was scared we might go for Landon Collins...  Moving up wasn't too expensive either. Two third day selections (one this year) and a guard who didn't fit our system and saved us $3 million in cap room. We can look for O-line help later in the draft. We also should be fairly rich in compensatory picks next year so a 5th rounder means nothing in 2016."

That has zero importance?   Look, I like the pick but let's not pretend we haven't seen this shit before. He was dumb enough to be caught with weed three days before the draft.

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,bentoboxbarry,5,Fri May 1 02:37:33 2015 UTC,"I dig it. Miller/Ware/Ray should be killer this year, and looking ahead, if Ray does live up to expectations, it might give us at least the option of saving a lot of cap space by releasing Ware next season. At this point, I'm just trusting Kubiak to improve the OL with picks from the later rounds.  And if we were going to trade up, this was a good deal. We have two fifth rounders this year so giving up one isn't a big loss, with all the free agents we have next year we're likely to wind up with another compensatory pick in the fifth round then too, and Manny probably wasn't going to start for us anyway, so we free up $3 million by trading a likely back-up."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,jfoster15,5,Fri May 1 02:54:46 2015 UTC,"I like the pick. People need to take a step back from freaking out about the OL.  We still have plenty of picks and the one guy we were reportedly interested in for the first round OL-wise was gone at 19.  Plus change of scheme and putting Vasquez back at RG, potentially Garland at LG. Not in too bad of shape honestly.  Could have definitely been worse... like the Colts drafting a WR with their 1st rounder."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,kgxv,8,Fri May 1 03:17:46 2015 UTC,"I'm surprised how mad some people are. I'm trusting Kubes, Wade and Elway on this one. Go Shane!!"

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,AdaAstra,1 point,Fri May 1 07:53:47 2015 UTC,But that's the thing. I'm not high on this kid. When I watch him I don't see an NFL impact pass rusher. I see a rotational player who will come in on 3-8+ and get a hand full of sacks a year. In the 1st I want a guy who's a mainstay for our organization for years and I don't see Ray as that type of player.

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Favre-a-bean,6,Fri May 1 02:39:44 2015 UTC,"he was the best defensive player in the SEC last year. 14.5 sacks. He lined up against Ogbuehi this year and got 2 sacks. Turf toe not a factor. ""substance abuse program"" because he got cited, cited for possession of less than 35 grams of weed."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,SlaminSammons,2,Fri May 1 03:03:03 2015 UTC,I'm not denying his talent. But the pick was still a risk. Turf toe can be a bitch and keep a player out for weeks. He was cited for possession of a personal amount of pot. Other than it being a dumb move a few days before the draft it's not a big character flag. If he screws up again while in program it could hurt the team. The silly thing about it all is that he will be playing in a state where pot is legal. At some point the NFL is going to have to adjust policy to reflect changing views regarding pot. That's a fight/discussion for another day.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Twizzle-dizzle,3,Fri May 1 03:12:13 2015 UTC,Turf toe can be a bitch and keep a player out for weeks.    I guess we'll have to bench him until the end of the month.  Luckily we aren't facing any really tough matchups during that time.

That's four guys, five including Ray, I don't see why we traded up even. There was a lot of talent to be had at 28 also I'd like to note Randy Gregory was still on the board who may be just as good as Ray. 6 players, most of which would have been there at 28. Dumb trade, goodish pick."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,BornToulouse,1 point,Fri May 1 02:49:18 2015 UTC,"It all comes down to who was on Denver's board. They may have thought that there weren't any real first round players left, which is common when you get into the late 20's in the draft, so you have a chance to take a top 10 type player for very little, instead of (according to their board, not Mel's or the internets) reaching for someone with the pick. I like it."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,Gtownbadass,2,Fri May 1 03:01:46 2015 UTC,"I understand that he may have been their only 1st doing grade, I just hate trading up. I rarely see how its worth it."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,vecchiobronco,3,Fri May 1 03:16:02 2015 UTC,"We trade an O-lineman, when we already had O-line problems... and then don't draft for the O-line?

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,riperoni,1 point,Fri May 1 03:50:09 2015 UTC,"At first this made me pretty nervous but I think it's smart going after Best Player Available and not chasing needs. We have tons of picks left to grab some Offensive Linemen and we don't know what Kubiak thought of the guys we already have on the team. Manny used to be great, he was average now and definitely replaceable. We got top 10 talent at a bargain price. Great move."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,c0dy21,1 point,Fri May 1 03:08:54 2015 UTC,"Honestly love this pick. Back to back years Elway gets a steal at the back end of the first round. Shane Ray was arguably the best player available at the time. Im okay with trading the 2 5th rounders because we need quality over quantity. Manny was not a great fit for the zone blocking scheme, but will be missed for O-line depth. I think there is really good picks left. Maybe Jake Fisher, TJ Clemmings, or La'el Collins for O-line. And just a pipe dream because I am a Michigan fan but I think Devin Funchess would be a huge physical body on the outside with Sanders remaining in the slot because Sanders is a matchup nightmare. Not saying I don't believe in Latimer but Funch is an absolute stud."
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,PMeist,1 point,Fri May 1 03:17:56 2015 UTC,I think the only reason there is to worry about your o line situation is the time it takes to groom the rookies.  Later rounders usually are not as capable at being plugged in right a way as starters.  But it's not like rameriez was a pro bowler so perhaps not that big of a dropoff

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,SlaminSammons,2,Fri May 1 02:53:34 2015 UTC,I think you are thinking about Vasquez...
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,NorthHighBears,2,Fri May 1 02:37:38 2015 UTC,I thought Manny was one of our better Olineman. Not as good as Clady or Vasquez but better than the other Olineman by far. Could be wrong so please clarify.   I've read that we might sign a veteran guy to replace Manny who could be just as good and using the money we would have paid to Manny. If that's the case and he performs just as well or better then we didn't lose anything other than 2 picks.
DenverBroncos,34h4h9,OutlawJoseyWales,1 point,Fri May 1 02:49:11 2015 UTC,"Manny lost his job at center last year, and was moved to guard last season cuz he can't snap and block.

DenverBroncos,34h4h9,jfoster15,2,Fri May 1 03:00:10 2015 UTC,"So I'm a Nebraska fan who lives in Lincoln. I actually thought Shane Ray was the better pick at that point. I love Gregory and really enjoyed him while he was here, but his weight fluctuates a ton, and he had got caught for weed a few more times than Ray. Including failing the drug test at the combine. THE COMBINE. You've gotta question a guys smarts if he manages to fail the drug test at the combine. Tells me there's a good chance of he played for the Broncos he would be missing some time due to being a dumb ass and smoking weed. Whereas hopefully Ray will be able to get his head on straight and not get caught again."

DenverBroncos,34h5mh,SonicSC,1 point,Fri May 1 02:49:25 2015 UTC,I sure wish he had been able to finish the year strong for us last year like he did the year before. I was on his bandwagon as soon as they switched him to Center; I could just tell that Manning trusted him and he was earning that trust. But you just can't deny that he wasn't up to the level necessary last year. I think he's going to be good for the Lions and wish him the best of luck. I hope whoever replaces him is a step up in talent/ability but also has as much character and locker room chemistry.

DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Neverethe,14,Fri May 1 05:29:32 2015 UTC,I want to buy you a beer. I completely agree that we got one of the top 3 best pass rushers in the draft for VERY cheap.
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Greeney494,3,Fri May 1 05:36:37 2015 UTC,"5th rounders tend to fill out your roster with bit players, back-ups, and depth guys.  They have value in getting guys like 4th/5th corner, kick/punt returners, rotational linebackers.  Sometimes you'll get some big hits too like Sherman or Kenny Stills.  Overall these type of guys aren't sexy picks, but when The KR starts fumbling or you're on your 3rd/4th ILB because of injury, you'll wish you had those picks.  That being said, two 5ths is totally worth moving up for Ray.  Also it's not like Ramirez was looking like some one the Broncos had in their future plans.  Hell im hoping my team would sacrifice a couple picks to move up to get Landon Collins or Randy Gregory."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Ted_rube,2,Fri May 1 17:21:31 2015 UTC,"Outside of Malik Jackson, Elway's 5th round picks haven't been stellar....  No 5th round in 2011, Jackson in 2012, Tavarres King and Quanterus Smith in 2013 (Neither with the team), and Last year Lamin Barrow (reserved judgement).  I think the trade was amazingly beneficial to both teams."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,skullyD,3,Fri May 1 05:46:25 2015 UTC,"If you look at every teams draft the past few years (which I have done) there is very little value in ANY 5th round draft choice. Not that there aren't some starters there, and even a couple very good players. But mostly it's players that are on the bubble of making rosters and serve as backups/third stringers."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,PMeist,1 point,Fri May 1 08:38:39 2015 UTC,I still have hope for Barrow
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,vindawg08,1 point,Fri May 1 09:02:28 2015 UTC,I think Julius Thomas was a 5th
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,ktsmyth,3,Fri May 1 15:14:11 2015 UTC,He was a 4th I think.
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,aatencio91,9,Fri May 1 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"IMO it was a good trade for both sides. Lions get to move back and generally we have gotten some productive late round picks, so the fifths make sense. Laken wasn't going anywhere and was a bit of a reach, and you guys got who you guys wanted."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Stafford2CjAllDay,3,Fri May 1 06:16:17 2015 UTC,"Manny has had his good times and his bad times, but he's generally recognized as a great locker room presence and a dedicated player. I think he'll be good for you guys."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,SonicSC,2,Fri May 1 18:58:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure Manny was just a throw in because we literally had 1 guard on our roster and he's pretty versatile. He should provide some quality depth at the very least."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Stafford2CjAllDay,5,Fri May 1 19:41:37 2015 UTC,"My thoughts exactly. I think this was a great trade, and really don't get the comments that we overpaid. Especially since we still have another fifth rounder, a sixth rounder, and then three seventh rounders that we have to use, on top of the fact that we're a team that's always very active in picking up guys that go undrafted. What team realistically needs six third day picks and several more UDFAs competing for the limited amount of open roster spots that we have left?  And we'll most likely be getting the one we traded next year back in compensatory picks anyway, considering how many free agents we have coming up at the end of the season; clearly the same strategy Elway had in mind last year when he traded a fourth to get Cody, and then we wound up with a fourth round compensatory pick to replace it. And Manny was a bad fit for a ZBS, so freeing up $3 million there is a bonus to me."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,milehighthunder,2,Fri May 1 05:40:06 2015 UTC,"Price was very reasonable and due to the compensatory picks we have here in this draft and figure to get again in 2016, we have enough ammo to move around.  I like it when someone knows what he wants and sets out to get it and doesn´t fuck around."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Jens1893,2,Fri May 1 15:24:36 2015 UTC,"Not everyone is the Seattle Seahawks where you can just draft Pro Bowlers in the 5th round every year. I totally agree with you- If I were a GM, I'd trade those late round picks as often as possible to move up in the earlier rounds where talent is exponentially better.  Every pick after the 3rd round is basically a lotto ticket, IMO. I was so stoked last night when we used 5th rounders to move up."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Fri May 1 15:43:04 2015 UTC,"I don't know if it's so much that 5th round picks are so valuable as much as ALL picks are valuable commodities, so to give away what was essentially 3 picks and a player to move up 5 spots seems ""expensive"", until you factor in the following:  1)Manny Ramirez was not guaranteed to make the team, so why not get something for him instead of cutting him outright?  2)Over the last 10 years (I looked) the only noteworthy 5th round pick is Richard Sherman.  3)We still have a 5th round pick left.  4)We had 10 picks overall, it should be a surprise to no one that we tried to move up, and we moved up in the 1st without it costing us our 2nd or 3rd (probably thanks to Manny).  So, while at the time I was all like this, in retrospect, we didn't give up as much as it appears (IMO the Chargers gave up more value to move up 2 spots), I just wish we had taken someone on the O-Line rather than Ray, but we'll see if I eat my words on that over time."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 16:06:14 2015 UTC,"Two 5th rounders is basically a couple of scratch tickets.  Positives for both teams in this deal, everyone got what they wanted for a fair price."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,Hurry_Hurry,1 point,Fri May 1 14:29:58 2015 UTC,"No idea why you got down voted, people need to cut that shit out if you have a different opinion grow some nuts and say it. Especially when you are correct. I mean just try to name our 5th round pick from the last 3 years without looking it up, 99% won't know including me. Why? Cuz they aren't contributing in a big way. Have the Broncos been striking gold in the late rounds the last few years? Yea, but that's not the norm.  We created cap space on 2 ends, we got Manny a new job, we got rid of a guy who doesn't fit the scheme at all and struggles with snapping and blocking all in one motion, we got a top 10 talent at 23, and the picks we have up don't leave a hole since we still have one this year, and probably will next year with comp picks.   Lions got a veteran C/G that is a mauler and should do well in their scheme, and got 2 picks that they can either use for players, or use for leverage to move up themselves."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,CO_Boiler,1 point,Fri May 1 17:13:30 2015 UTC,"we got a top 10 talent at 23   Empirically, no you didn't. The 22 teams that picked before Denver passed on him, so by the actual draft he was not a top 10 talent. Denver's strategy didn't somehow make Ray fall to them.  You got a 23 pick at pick 23. And if you really rate based upon what other people might have picked without the trade, you might have gotten a 28 pick at 23, as there was no indication anyone after Denver's trade position was going that way. If you're going to read tea leaves, consider the possibility that the trade was entirely unnecessary to begin with (of course we can't know).  As to 5th rounder picks being worthless, the whole idea of the 7 rounds is that you then get a wide compliment of talents that you get the sift through during training camp, the preseason, possibly the practice squad. To use Seattle as the example, Richard Sherman and Cam Chancellor were 5th round picks. Walter Thurmond a 4th rounder. Malcolm Smith came from the 7th round. Better still for the teams, when they develop these late round picks into premiere options, they're super cheap and thus components of a killer team (versus paying big in FA)."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,1lIlI1lIIlIl1I,1 point,Fri May 1 20:40:20 2015 UTC,"Well if you were to redraft through the years knowing what you know now, would Brady still go in the 6th? No. Do your argument that just because other teams passed over him means that is their talent level is incorrect. Where talent level lies is not determined by other teams, it is determined by the players. Ray's talent level is top 15 at the very least, but his off the field issue earlier this week shoved him down the board, no different than Roby last year.   As for the value of picks you fail to see that it is a game of odds. And the odds of a 5th round pick being a Walter Thurmond is small, extremely small. You also fail to look at the fact that we still have 8 more picks this year, and we have been able to develop players from CFA effectively. More effectively than many teams, so that offsets a single draft pick. Also I didn't say they were worthless, your words, not mine. What you can say as a matter of fact is a 5th round pick is not worth the same as a 1st round pick."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,CO_Boiler,1 point,Fri May 1 22:32:13 2015 UTC,"Ray's talent level is top 15 at the very least,   You just compared him with Tom Brady's demonstrated talents. But Ray hasn't on the NFL field. Right now his only placement is courtesy of the draft. You will have an argument mid-season if he's blasting offensive lines, but otherwise it's premature.   As for the value of picks you fail to see that it is a game of odds.   I don't fail to see that at all. The odds of a fifth rounder turning into a starter is something like 1/5th a first rounder. But the thing about odds is that the more die you cast, the better the chance that you hit snake eyes (if that's good).  Yes, a fifth rounder is nowhere near the value of a 1st rounder. But a lot of team's really defensively protect those deep rounders now because playing those odds has really made teams."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,1lIlI1lIIlIl1I,1 point,Fri May 1 22:40:09 2015 UTC,"No I'm comparing how talent level does not correspond with draft position. Ray proved himself talent wise as much as any top pick, but his fault was in his off the field issues pulled him down.  The Broncos are able to play both sides of the game because of having so many picks they can trade a couple and still have a ton of picks to go after players with."
DenverBroncos,34hl6b,CO_Boiler,0,Fri May 1 23:58:09 2015 UTC,Absolutely.  There isn't much of a talent drop between the 5th round and the end of the draft.  I'd imagine half of the guys that the Broncos or any other team have high on their board during the 5th round don't get drafted.
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,PMeist,4,Fri May 1 09:28:39 2015 UTC,Marpet please
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,Blacky31,2,Fri May 1 09:43:10 2015 UTC,"Why Marpet? Tell me about him. I actually had to google Marpet just to see what that even was, turns out it's an NFL prospect. :D"
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,Blacky31,3,Fri May 1 09:48:20 2015 UTC,Underrated because he is a small school prospect  Perfect zone blocking fit  Excelled at the senior bowl and combine. Great technique and reportedly a hard worker
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,TDenverFan,2,Fri May 1 10:02:26 2015 UTC,Could imagine Elway picking him up in the late rounds for depth and him working his way into starting  knowing our luck with linemen health.
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,Blacky31,2,Fri May 1 14:56:37 2015 UTC,"Normally I like smaller school guys, but OL is one position where I'm wary of them. The DLs he faced aren't much better than a top high school team, he's far too unproven for my tastes. I'd rather Donovan Smith, TJ Clemmings or Hroniss Grasu in the second. If MArpet falls to the third maybe I'd be ok pulling the trigger if we didn't go OL in the second."
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 15:20:34 2015 UTC,I would prefer clemmings I just don't think it will happen  Marpet played well against much better competition in the Senior Bowl
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,badcompany1981,4,Fri May 1 22:29:53 2015 UTC,"Damn, I was hoping we would've traded the 28th pick in the 5th instead of the 7th last night.  I don't know how they'd do it since the can't trade their 4th rounder or any of the 7th rounders, but if they could somehow end up with two picks in the 2nd round I would be quite pleased, because we screwed the pooch with helping the OL last night and need to try and pick up some support at C, G, and OT ASAP before the ones who can help immediately are all gone.  Hopefully some subset of the following players end up on this team tonight:    O-Line:   Jake Fisher TJ Clemmings Hroniss Grasu Ty Sambraillo AJ Cann   Others I wouldn't mind:   Maxx Williams Landon Collins Mario Edwards Jr. (though, this one seems highly unlikely now that we've drafted Ray)   Players I don't want to see on this team:   Randy Gregory La'El Collins Dorial Green-Beckham"

DenverBroncos,34i0vm,TDenverFan,3,Fri May 1 09:59:37 2015 UTC,"You didn't, it was my fault. I should have added that because they are not trade-able, that we would have a tough time trading up to anything higher than a 4th rounder assuming we don't use future picks  Edit: This is also assuming we keep our 2nd and 3rd round picks and don't use them to trade"
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,MileHigh3oh3,1 point,Fri May 1 10:04:59 2015 UTC,"I can see the Broncos trading a 5th and/or 6th to move up in the 3rd.  I'd say that's likely, actually."
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,ilovetobet11,3,Fri May 1 16:49:22 2015 UTC,I personally would like to snag P Kyle Loomis in the 6th. He averaged ~46 yards/punt his senior year at Portland State.  And if he's still around in the 4th I think we should roll the dice and grab La'el Collins
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,TDenverFan,3,Fri May 1 15:21:21 2015 UTC,"loomis in 7th i'm ok with, 6th is pretty early"
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,CO_Boiler,3,Fri May 1 16:00:28 2015 UTC,"Hate to be a dick, but if any GM spends a draft pick on a Punter they might need to be fired. You can get nearly an identical player for much less and without using any draft pick."
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,TDenverFan,2,Fri May 1 16:13:22 2015 UTC,He's the best punter in this draft by a decent margin. Getting a starter in the 6th is always good value
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,ilovetobet11,2,Fri May 1 16:18:07 2015 UTC,"You said draft him in the 4th the first time, and 6th the second time. But you could also go and grab Cody Webster as a CFA and he averaged 45 yards 2 years ago in his last season, and was runner up for the Ray Guy award.  Edit: Read it wrong the first time my bad"
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,YakPineapple,2,Fri May 1 17:01:04 2015 UTC,I meant Collins in the 4th and Loomis in the 6th.
DenverBroncos,34i0vm,designated_shitter,2,Fri May 1 23:27:38 2015 UTC,"I understand and respect his game as well as understand your point that getting a great punter can be beneficial, but that would mean drafting a player who maybe has 3 or 4 plays in the entire game when you could get someone who can play special teams and their side of the ball, then get a punter as an UFA for far less $ and make him earn and retain his spot."

DenverBroncos,34h4cz,finivn,7,Fri May 1 02:40:23 2015 UTC,This guy is fast off the snap. Cannot wait to see how the Broncos use him with Von and Ware.
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,TooShortIsMyFather,5,Fri May 1 02:41:33 2015 UTC,"this pick might not give Peyton more time in the pocket, but if he plays to his potential, he can help give Peyton more time of possession"

DenverBroncos,34h4cz,sman2002,3,Fri May 1 03:30:02 2015 UTC,Wow. Surprised. Excited. Should be interesting.
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,johnny-86,3,Fri May 1 02:37:44 2015 UTC,"Our pass rush is gonna be mean!  When Ware comes out we no longer lose the pass rush.  Von, Ware, Wolfe and now Ray! Our D is legit!"

DenverBroncos,34h4cz,icangetyouatoedude,1 point,Fri May 1 17:23:46 2015 UTC,"Look how fast he gets off the line dude  From NFL.com's profile on him: ""Explosive athlete in every sense. Has elite power for his size and explodes off the line like a coiled spring. Rushes passer with extreme passion and purpose. Has fast, violent hands with advanced understanding of how to use them. Tough and plays with bad intentions on each snap. Uses rip to get under linemen and out-leverage them. Played 4-3 defensive right end in base but rushed from three-technique in some sub-packages. Once he gets to blocker's edge, they struggle to recover and redirect. Rare ability to post inside leg and get his body turned sharply and quickly around it toward quarterback. Excellent change-of-direction talent. Has natural coordination of head fakes, footwork and hand usage in pass rush. Works hard to stand his ground against power. Has power in upper body and hips to punch and dispatch with tight ends against run. Rarely runs past the arc as a rusher and will fight to come back underneath if he gets on the high side. Was able to drop into space with no issues when asked."""
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Xenokaos,7,Fri May 1 18:11:37 2015 UTC,"We gave up Manny Ramirez, our first rounder, a fifth this year, and a fifth next year. TOO much."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Ol_Geiser,11,Fri May 1 02:36:40 2015 UTC,Manny was on his way out anyways. There's always UDFA and supp draft to fill in the rest
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,myshkingfh,14,Fri May 1 02:38:14 2015 UTC,"I assumed they'd just cut him by now but if you can use him to move up, win-win!"
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Tasteofink410,12,Fri May 1 02:41:06 2015 UTC,"You can't say first rounder…..it's a swap, also this team is pretty loaded. What do you expect to get in the 5th this year? Its a pretty underwhelming draft class. Wit that said we need to be drafting players that will make an immediate impact like shane n roby, we wont find that in the 5th round this year so im very ok with this."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Xenokaos,1 point,Fri May 1 02:47:18 2015 UTC,"Shane may not make an immediate impact because of his toe and because he will be behind Ware and Miller. He will probably be a good player down the line, but right now? I am not so sure."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Tasteofink410,6,Fri May 1 02:48:50 2015 UTC,Why would elway move up on a guy he thought wouldn't play much this year. Dware is only gonna be here another year and is 33. Ic Shane getting plenty of playing time. Wade likes to bring that pressure so he will get his
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Xenokaos,6,Fri May 1 02:55:35 2015 UTC,We gotta shit ton of picks lol
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Twizzle-dizzle,1 point,Fri May 1 02:38:45 2015 UTC,"But a lack of a line. And it hinders us for next year--all for five spots. I don't love it, but in ELWAY I trust."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,myshkingfh,6,Fri May 1 02:40:59 2015 UTC,"BPA  It's a deep draft at OL, got a coach who will always get the best out of an OL, and two all pros already on it."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Xenokaos,5,Fri May 1 02:43:54 2015 UTC,"You can't really say that it's going to hinder us. There is still lot of drafting to do, OL is deep in this class, and Ray could really shine in this system. He is a top 10-15  or better player in this draft and (I'm assuming) that according to Denver's draft board there was no one on their board left worth a first round pick and there is Ray dropping down, and you don't have to surrender a lot in a draft where you have a ton of picks, you pull the trigger."

DenverBroncos,34h4cz,anunknind,6,Fri May 1 02:53:02 2015 UTC,Manny was gone to begin with. Not a fit for the scheme.
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Bradyta,2,Fri May 1 02:37:16 2015 UTC,Why does Matt Money Smith keep saying three 5th rounders. Thats not what they graphic said but he's said it like five times now.
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Xenokaos,2,Fri May 1 02:42:08 2015 UTC,"Vic Lombardi says that Ray will replace Demarcus Ware next year. Also that Manny was on his way out anyway, and that he was just trade bait.   So it really doesn't seem like that bad of a trade. Didn't we get that 5th round pick from Chicago?"
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Bradyta,3,Fri May 1 02:57:39 2015 UTC,"We can burn fifth rounders if we want, we got comp picks out the fucking ass man and not that much roster space."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Xenokaos,3,Fri May 1 02:47:27 2015 UTC,"I don't mind the idea of trading up, but I dont think we needed to for Ray. I think he would have been there when we drafted or another talented DE. Or even an OL to protect manning."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,bentoboxbarry,1 point,Fri May 1 02:49:30 2015 UTC,"Don't think Ray would've been there, he was a possible top 10 talent, I gotta catch up on draft stuff after finals but I saw that first step just now and it's dirty man. If John Elway thought he was a top 10 talent and there wasn't a good OL there for his value then it's fine. We'll get a good guard or center in the second round and go from there."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,PMeist,3,Fri May 1 02:53:45 2015 UTC,"His toe injury and his recent citation make me question where he was going to go. I think he would have been there, but who knows."

DenverBroncos,34h4cz,myshkingfh,1 point,Fri May 1 03:29:20 2015 UTC,"I've been convinced in recent hours that we haven't actually given up much for him at all.   Manny was gone one way or another. We will find another guy in FA who will be better anyway and use Manny's salary that way. Or draft someone who will replace him.   Plus the pick we traded away this season wasn't even ours, we still have another 5th round pick this year. We gave up a 5th round pick next year but so what? It's spread out. It's not like it's a terribly high pick anyway."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Corrupted_Engineer,2,Fri May 1 09:04:01 2015 UTC,"I'm just saying, he still would have been there."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,RedRiderJman,7,Fri May 1 02:37:23 2015 UTC,NFL network is saying that the ravens were gonna pick him.
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,PMeist,5,Fri May 1 02:38:18 2015 UTC,Would have been great for the cards too
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,nooberjuice,3,Fri May 1 02:39:52 2015 UTC,Do you guys remember the last game of 2014? We could not generate pressure with so many high quality players. We can't blame that all on JDR even though he was a big part of it. Here is to hoping our D-Line becomes Buffalo-esque in the future years.
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,skullyD,1 point,Fri May 1 02:46:24 2015 UTC,"Well technically the last game was in 2015 but I see what you are saying completely. We can't trust Von and Ware to be amazing every single snap, even though they usually are. We needed a third threat. This is going to cause an extra double team EVERY single snap that he is on the field. This will help guys like Malik and Sly with their occasional doubles. This is a great pick. Granted not the position we are thin at. Who knows, Ray may be another Von (not gonna happen but we can dream)."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,flynryan692,3,Fri May 1 08:10:34 2015 UTC,"This plus you can be more creative in blitzing in 3-4 compared to 4-3. Especially in Wade Phillip's 3-4. While the last game for us was abysmal on defense getting any rush going, a lot of it was that JDR was NOT calling any kind of blitzes at all. You can't expect guys to get pressure when you only send 4."
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,epgenius,3,Fri May 1 09:06:49 2015 UTC,I thought the trade was too much
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,PMeist,-1,Fri May 1 02:51:26 2015 UTC,"This made me lol, have an upvote."

DenverBroncos,34h4cz,bigearth64,0,Fri May 1 02:38:25 2015 UTC,"Haven't been a fan of Elway's trading yet. A 4th rounder for Gino Gradkowski, who we probably could have gotten for a 6th. Also Shane Ray most likely would have been on the board at 28  I'm not sure Ramirez really fit the ZBS scheme though, and this gives us some more cap room"
DenverBroncos,34h4cz,Malakiun,-5,Fri May 1 02:48:47 2015 UTC,Ironic that you are concerned about his weed in a state where its legal
DenverBroncos,34hhyg,Theingloriousak2,16,Fri May 1 04:50:26 2015 UTC,"""And now, for the Broncos, I'm gonna dominate everybody that we play.""   That was my favorite quote."
DenverBroncos,34hhyg,skullyD,5,Fri May 1 05:08:53 2015 UTC,"seems very happy that we traded up to get him, i think we got top ten  talent  hopefully sylvester can step up in the middle"
DenverBroncos,34hhyg,designated_shitter,3,Fri May 1 05:12:47 2015 UTC,"From his perspective, this is the best possible outcome:  he's still a first round draft pick, he stays hungry because of the teams that passed him up, he gets to be on the same team as his hero, he's with a winning franchise, and being paired with Miller and Ware means that there's a good chance his numbers are better than if he'd gone to another team, because he's not necessarily ""the man"" who teams have to game plan around (at least not yet).    And of course obviously we're biased, but it's a great fanbase, a great franchise, and he'll be playing multiple prime time games in his rookie season.  That's pretty damn cool."
DenverBroncos,34hhyg,bmsuperfly,9,Fri May 1 16:42:57 2015 UTC,I don't think I've ever seen a guy with such a huge chip on his shoulder.
DenverBroncos,34hhyg,flynryan692,2,Fri May 1 05:05:07 2015 UTC,Have you heard of CJ Anderson?
DenverBroncos,34hhyg,bmsuperfly,1 point,Fri May 1 15:16:17 2015 UTC,"I like C.J. a lot and he obviously does because he brings up when not* drafted, but Ray is just another level up imo. Both of his interviews after being drafted have been indebted gratefulness and he's going to dominate the entire league.   I like the pick more and more every time I hear him speak."

DenverBroncos,34hhyg,Tlwofford,6,Fri May 1 04:58:32 2015 UTC,Seems like a fiery guy with a passion for the game. I love that.

And the fact he knows he can learn how to be even better learning from Von and Ware shows the smarts necessary to augment his obvious raw ability. Other QBs in the AFCW should be terrified right now at what we're about to do to them.  Still a bit nervous about our OLine situation but if we were possibly going to cut Manny, then this is way better."

DenverBroncos,34hhyg,flynryan692,1 point,Fri May 1 16:20:36 2015 UTC,I love it when our players have a chip of their shoulder...see CJ Anderson for an example.
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,Tlwofford,12,Fri May 1 04:45:08 2015 UTC,"To be fair, they gave us a C+, which isn't bad. They also acknowledge the fact that Ware, Von, and Ray are going to be a great force. They gave us a C+ because they think we overpaid to move up, and we didn't fill a ""need"", both are valid points. I do agree we may have over paid, but the more I research him the more I am happy we did."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,flynryan692,6,Fri May 1 06:03:05 2015 UTC,"I know its already been brought up on here, and I'm guilty of thinking we might have overpaid as well, but it sounds like Manny was probably gone anyway. So, we basically gave up two 5th round picks. We did gain around $3 million in cap space by trading him though."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,rckymtnclmbr,5,Fri May 1 06:07:59 2015 UTC,"We had more picks in this Draft than we needed. There are only so many roster spots available on a team that has the talent level that the Broncos do. Over paying is all relative to a teams specific situation. If a team only has a few draft picks and start trading them away I could see that argument being valid. But the Broncos still have a 5th round pick this year, along with a pick in every other round (3 in the 7th).   Manny was good to have around I think, you could plug him in and he would mostly do a serviceable job. My thought is that Schofield must be looking somewhat descent if they traded Manny."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,ATLRockies,2,Fri May 1 15:14:18 2015 UTC,"We had two picks in the 5th, one from the bears. Lions get that pick and a player we were letting go of anyway plus we drop our cap number by 3M. All we really gave up was a 5th next year imo."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,Shooter79,9,Fri May 1 16:53:50 2015 UTC,"When looking at whether we overpaid, we might consider this: Shane Ray averaged 2.7 seconds before first contact on his sacks last season, fastest of any player in this draft"
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,ktsmyth,7,Fri May 1 06:10:28 2015 UTC,Worst pick of the first round?  Colts.

DenverBroncos,34hhhi,von_bot,7,Fri May 1 09:19:32 2015 UTC,"It seems like they don't realize filling a need is secondary to Elway. His philosophy is you draft the best player available, and in our case Elway wanted Shane Ray specifically. We took the best player for our team available."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,Crosshare,7,Fri May 1 07:04:30 2015 UTC,Last time Elway drafted a pass rusher and I doubted him it turned out it was Von fucking Miller. I'll reserve judgment here

DenverBroncos,34hhhi,waspocracy,3,Fri May 1 15:40:17 2015 UTC,Or Dareus/Fairley. So glad we got Von.
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,cult_member,2,Fri May 1 17:25:59 2015 UTC,"Oh yeah I had them on the ""please don't draft"" list.  I wanted defense and I wanted it to be Von or Peterson.  I'm quite happy with how it turned out."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,cult_member,2,Fri May 1 18:05:07 2015 UTC,"Good.   Even in this subreddit I've heard people talk about O-Line and LB's constantly. Elway has always said they don't draft to need, but they draft the best player available. Needs are filled in Free Agency. I think more NFL teams need to do this and it's worked for The Patriots. As much as we hate them, we can't deny a more dominant franchise in the past decade.   Plus, there are still good linemen and LB's in free agency."

DenverBroncos,34hhhi,SuburbanHell,0,Fri May 1 11:17:21 2015 UTC,"I'd say the problem is more the timing than the actual 'offense'. We'll have to keep an eye on Ray just to be safe (and let's face it being in Colorado does add some risk), but it's nothing we can't handle."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,8manjones,2,Sat May 2 23:27:30 2015 UTC,"My initial reaction, even still, I didn't think it was the worst pick of the draft at all.  Hell I don't even thing Washington or the G-Men did that bad for picking -- the potential draft ""losers"" from last night's round would be in my opinion, Carolina, Green Bay, or Indianapolis.  None of them filled a need last night, and all of them had a chance at a better BPA."
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,rckymtnclmbr,1 point,Fri May 1 15:42:32 2015 UTC,"Why the hell would you have reacted that way? We drafted an excellent athlete 13+ picks later than what was expected. We solidified the possibility that we could easily have the best pass rush in the league, as long as the coaching staff keeps their shit together.   How is any of this possibly a bad thing?!"
DenverBroncos,34hhhi,FartisticLicense,3,Fri May 1 21:37:44 2015 UTC,"So yeah, here's what happened to my brain last night:  1)Not an OL which is far and away our weakest spot on the team right now and in dire need of help. 2)Traded away another OL as part of the deal, weakening the line even further. 3)There is SO MANY OL choices we could've drafted. 4)If we were going to trade up, why wouldn't do it earlier in the round and go after Cam Erving? 5)Von Miller & the 800 pound gorilla.  I don't want him anywhere near someone who just days before the biggest night of his life gets caught in possession of weed.  I don't care what anyone does in their spare time but Miller's already at Level 3 and the last thing he needs is to be near someone who doesn't make good life choices.  So all that ran through my head in about a ...10 second span upon hearing the draft announcement.  I've obviously come down off the ledge since, while this guy still isn't a top-10 overall to me, if Elway had him at #10 on the Broncos big board (as reported earlier today), then I put my faith in that and see if this kid can stay straight and be this fucking monster on the field I've been watching on random videos all day.    Go Broncos.  Go America.  Fuck The Raiders."

Which is that Denver got a steal. I saw other people grade KC's pick as pretty bad, but NFL.com gave them an A. Bottom line though, no one really has any idea how these players will work out and post draft grades are dumb."

Your god is John Elway.  You have many lesser gods (we'll get to that shortly), but he will always be the One.  He currently runs our front office, extending his legacy off the field as well.

Speaking of the Greats, remember those ""lesser gods"" I spoke of?  While the NFL Hall of Fame is bereft of many a deserving Bronco player, we thoroughly remember and love them all.  A quick cliff notes version on who you love (for the purpose of this list, these will not be current players):  Mark Schlereth - John Elway's bodyguard essentially, and one of the greatest OG's we've ever known.

Tom Jackson - One of the many members of the Orange Crush defense, played a long, long career for us (something like 200 games), and is also an analyst on ESPN these days.  Karl Mecklenburg - #2 on the Broncos all-time Sacks list with 79.5 and a 6-time probowler.  Howard Griffith - One of the main men who made it possible for Terrell Davis to be Terrell Davis, and the key reason why Kubiak is pushing hard for us to get someone into the Fullback role again now.  Ed McCaffrey - The ultimate receiving threat, he and Rod Smith made each other better.  Is currently heard on KOA doing color commentary for our games with Dave Logan  Mike Shanahan - Some people hate him here, but he's the greatest coach in the history of our team, Two superbowls, the run scheme we know and love, the ability to draft guys in the late round like TD, Rod, Shannon, Schlereth, etc....finished his Broncos career on a down-note, but still with a record of 146-95, and might be the one guy who hates the Raiders more than the rest of us do.  Champ Bailey - A likely shoe-in for the Hall of Fame when his eligibility comes up, more pro-bowl appearances than I can remember any Cornerback having, made the first of his many interceptions in his first play ever as a Bronco and never looked back.  Jason Elam - The Kicker none of us would ever thought would get beaten with the longest field goal of all time at 63 yards until another former Bronco, Matt Prater beat it at 64.  Elam completed 99.5 percent of his extra points with the team and no kicker has more points than Elam in history.  Steve Atwater - The greatest Safety I have ever seen play the game.  He once killed a guy on the field.  Not really, but I still don't think Christian Okoye has gotten up from that hit.  I don't think we will ever see someone quite so talented at his position ever again, he's been out of the league for coming up on 15-20 years now and I still miss him terribly.  Gary Zimmerman - Another Elway bodyguard who protected John's blindside for many years in the 80s and 90s, much like Schlereth, gave his body up to protect our boy on a regular basis.  Once was quoted ""As long as No. 7 is on the field, I'll be there.""  Randy Gradishar - another Orange Crusher - 20 Interceptions, over 2000 tackles, and the measuring stick for what a linebacker should be.  Von will someday eclipse him, and that is an amazing thought.  Shannon Sharpe - Tight End extraordinaire who can talk, talk, talk, but on the field he always backed it up.  One of our few HoFers and if not for Tony Gonzalez he'd be known as the greatest TE in NFL history, in our hearts though, he truly is.  Rod Smith - Undrafted rookie free agent who joined the team and played his entire career with us, ending up in the top 25 in career receptions and receiving yards, and the only undrafted player to rack up more than 10,000 yards receiving.  Terrell Davis - Inventor of the Mile High Salute and an integral piece of our back-to-back superbowl championships.  One of only 5 RBs to ever hit the 2000 yard rushing mark in a season, if not for a career-ending knee injury he'd be in the Hall already, and hopefully we'll still get to see him there someday, because he truly deserves it, I can't even fathom the kind of numbers he would've put up under a full length career.  Finally, The One, The Only, John Elway - John can be viewed by many as a bit of an asshole, refused to play for the team who drafted him, we won him in a trade where we didn't even give up that much, and he stuck by the Broncos through some dark moments in our history only to go out on top after winning the Superbowl twice, probably the greatest QB of all time when it comes to come-back victories, in a time vacuum against all other QBs, you'll be hard pressed to find anyone better, except maybe our current QB, Peyton Manning.  This brings us to the ""Recent history"" portion of the team tour.  Post-Shanahan we had this dickface named Josh McDaniels at Head Coach, and watched him entirely dismantle a budding young group of players who had so much potential, eventually turning us into the 2nd worst team in the league.  This did get us Von Miller, but nothing good really came from McDaniels' tenure here.  Out he goes and in comes John Fox, as vanilla a coach as you can get, but something we sorely needed at the time, players love him and after an experiment with one of McDaniel's last picks, Tim Tebow took us through a media circus and a playoff win, our Horse Bros the Colts released future Hall of Famer Peyton Manning, and John Elway convinced him to come to the Broncos.  BOOM suddenly we're a championship caliber team, guys are lining up to be Broncos and the core we had in place plus a few additions made it almost possible, until we found out that John Fox, and his counterpart on Defense just didn't have that agressive ""stomp on their throats until they're dead"" attitude that one needs to win a championship.  We ran into the SuperBowl, completely unprepared, and got rekt.  The following year we ran into the Colts, completely unprepared as our DC and OC were off interviewing for other team's HC jobs the day s before heading into our game, and got rekt again, if ever there was evidence that a coaching staff not preparing a team for a game is detrimental to the team, that game was it.  Out goes Fox and company and in comes a familiar face from our Super Bowl glory days, Gary Kubiak.  Kubes was our OC back then and comes in with a bit of a shaky head coaching record, but with Elway and him working together and the ZBS coming back and Wade Phillips running the D, switching us to a 3-4, and actually allowing the boys to blitz, we're going to be that team that ""stomps on their throat until their dead"".  Amazing times to look forward to this year.  Edit:  Players to really keep an eye on this year:   QB - Peyton Manning RB - CJ Anderson WR - Demaryius Thomas, Emanuel Sanders, Cody Latimer TE - Virgil Green Linebackers - Von Miller, Demarcus Ware, Shane Ray (hopefully), Brandon Marshall, Danny Trevathan CB - Chris Harris Jr SS - TJ Ward   Fuck The Raiders!"

DenverBroncos,34hsds,capitlj,9,Fri May 1 22:40:17 2015 UTC,"Welcome to Broncos Country!  You hate the Chiefs, Chargers, Raiders (fuck the Raiders) as division rivals.  These rivalries are DEEP; the AFC West is a storied division. You also hate the Seahawks as former division foes, and for that joke of a Super Bowl (blame the coaching staff that is no longer here for that and last year's playoff embarrassment at home against the Colts).  You also hate the Patriots.    The GM is the GREAT John Elway.  The coaching staff is basically the family all getting back together.  Head Coach Gary Kubiak was a long time backup QB to John Elway.  When he retired from playing, he, after a few years, became the Broncos OC under Mike Shanahan, calling plays for the Super Bowl Championships.  Kubiak's coaching skills were eventually recognized by the Houston Texans, who made him HC until he was fired and spent last year as Baltimore's OC.  Now he's back home with Elway and the Broncos.  With him comes our new OC, Rick Dennison, a long time Bronco as both player and coach, much like Kubiak.  Dennison was Alex Gibbs' protege.  Alex Gibbs is the OL genius who coached elite Broncos teams in the Zone Run scheme.  Dennison's knowledge of the zone system will be in lock-step with Kubiak.    Our DC, Wade Philips, was a former Broncos DC in the 90's and former Broncos HC.  He was very unsuccessful as a HC here, though he's an EXCELLENT coordinator."

DenverBroncos,34h5ol,TheClayroo,3,Fri May 1 02:51:53 2015 UTC,"He'll be rotating with Ware is my guess. He's young so he won't get every snap, and Ware is getting up there in age, blitzing every other play is going to wear him down, so I think Ray will cycle in. He's listed as a DE but at 245, he's standing up as an LB."
DenverBroncos,34h5ol,TheClayroo,2,Fri May 1 03:20:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah CFB is getting weird with DEs and OLBs now and going side to side, I wonder if Wade Phillips will just put him in to blitz random plays and eventually replace Ware or if he's going to be in a base package playing most downs.

DenverBroncos,34h5ol,von_bot,2,Fri May 1 03:47:21 2015 UTC,I definitely thin it'll be a learning year. Von will be a good mentor for him because he's been through some trouble himself. He can convince Ray it'll all disappear in a blink.

Gregory could fill the role of a rushing linebacker like Von Miller and it'd be interesting to see them disguise coverage so you wouldn't know which side pressure is coming from.  Also a big believer in Abdullah. It just sucks that he has his size going against him - I definitely think he has big plays in him.

Watching his interview my first impression is that I like him. Of course that impression isn't worth much.  On the other hand, he's got to be coming into one of the best situations for someone in his position. He's got a legendary mentor and good influence in Ware, a guy like Von to model himself after and has been in the same boat he is in with the weed, and a great position coach in Kollar."

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,3,Fri May 1 00:22:44 2015 UTC,Judging by how fast that pick came in I'd guess Williams too.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,2,Fri May 1 00:24:01 2015 UTC,Damn they didn't waste any time taking whoever they did.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 00:23:13 2015 UTC,Oh shit no kidding. Looks like they were really banking on the QB's going 1-2.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,2,Fri May 1 00:24:04 2015 UTC,I think they need Fowler more but Williams is a better player. They should still take Williams so the Raiders don't get him

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,3,Fri May 1 01:24:10 2015 UTC,"Good choice, it really could go either way, though I figure they go with the WR first and take maybe an Eddie Goldman with their second pick this round.  Edit:  You win this round /u/crueg! :D"
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:25:37 2015 UTC,I'm going to go with Armstead just because why the hell not.

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,2,Fri May 1 01:29:35 2015 UTC,Who do we want tonight?  I need to root for someone to slide to us.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,jmj8778,2,Fri May 1 01:29:52 2015 UTC,"sara jean underwood.  oh nfl, right. ummm DJ humphries, TJ Clemmings, Cam Erving, 1st rights to peyton manning's son"
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,3,Fri May 1 01:31:11 2015 UTC,"I second this Sara Jean Underwood sliding to us thing.  Seriously though, I gotta keep the dream alive for Cam Erving at 28."
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:32:07 2015 UTC,"Miami....uhm, shit. Devante Parker, I guess?"
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,2,Fri May 1 01:36:28 2015 UTC,Chicago: 120  Milwaukee: 66  Holy. Shit.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,2,Fri May 1 01:36:48 2015 UTC,WOW!
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:37:08 2015 UTC,"Ok, Miami, this is Devante Parker."

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:42:31 2015 UTC,I just want a TRADE
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,2,Fri May 1 01:44:32 2015 UTC,WOOOO!
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,2,Fri May 1 01:45:15 2015 UTC,Gotta be Gordon for the Bolts.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:45:43 2015 UTC,"10/15, though I hate I was right about that one."
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:47:59 2015 UTC,Great now we have TWO Jamaal Charles' in the division?!?
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:48:51 2015 UTC,"houston, i have no clue. fuck it, let's say erick kendricks, why the hell not"
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,2,Fri May 1 01:50:15 2015 UTC,"Little bit of a reach, but definitely a need for them, I could see that as a possibility."
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:51:22 2015 UTC,"Ok, Houston, Randy Gregory .. or maybe Breshad Perriman.  I think they need WR help more with Johnson gone, so I'm gonna go with Perriman here."
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:50:17 2015 UTC,Chicken Parm you taste so good.  We need some new phrases for this song Peyton.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:52:47 2015 UTC,"So.... BPA after Armstead?  Sure, why not Houston..."
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:55:42 2015 UTC,"im gonna say erick kendricks or armstead for SF, they need help everywhere"
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,2,Fri May 1 01:57:01 2015 UTC,"Ok SF, Kendricks?"
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:57:48 2015 UTC,That was expensive just for 2 spots.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 01:59:32 2015 UTC,Both BPA and a need for them.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 02:00:12 2015 UTC,"7/17, thats like 5 more than i thought id get right!"

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 02:01:59 2015 UTC,"KC:  Breshad Perriman, or any WR who can actually score a touchdown this season for them."
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 02:01:34 2015 UTC,I have a gut feeling we trade up.... Don't know why.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,skullyD,2,Fri May 1 02:05:16 2015 UTC,Shane Ray and Randy Gregory are dropping like stones... a couple really good tackles on the board too.  This is setting up nicely for us.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,hayclaylaybaymaysay,2,Fri May 1 02:05:17 2015 UTC,Im just gonna say this:   Randy Gregory.  Let him learn to not be a jackass with DWare and unleash all 3 in passing situations. Then whens wares goe we have a dominant duo in Von and Gregory  OLine can be found later. BPA!!!!  EDIT: Well I was close..... RAY-VON

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,crueg,3,Fri May 1 02:22:42 2015 UTC,Probably gonna move Erving to guard.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,skullyD,3,Fri May 1 02:24:17 2015 UTC,I guess they want him as a guard. He'd be better at center though.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,2,Fri May 1 02:24:31 2015 UTC,OOGITYBOOGITY!
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,ThreezusManning,2,Fri May 1 02:26:17 2015 UTC,Im ok with cedric coming off the board.

DenverBroncos,34ggn5,fthflyer,2,Fri May 1 02:44:08 2015 UTC,Hey Broncos fans!  How has Manny Ramirez been the last few years?
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,droolingtortillas,4,Fri May 1 02:47:05 2015 UTC,Lots of speculation he was gonna get cut from the team this offseason.   2013-2014 he stepped in at Center and was great.  2014-2015 he sucked.....   Soooooo.....yeah.
DenverBroncos,34ggn5,skullyD,3,Fri May 1 02:53:11 2015 UTC,"He's been good around 2012-2013 season, but at least last year, he has been a bit poor.  However, he's probably worth at least a rookie offensive lineman."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,aatencio91,36,Thu Apr 30 20:44:20 2015 UTC,"Interesting, but justifiable. Ware isn't getting any younger, and the depth would be very useful considering Wade's blitz heavy scheme.  I smell Shane Ray (not the weed) becoming a possibility of he falls. Or we trade up to snag one."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,skullyD,8,Thu Apr 30 20:51:31 2015 UTC,Are you a wizard???
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,wc452,1 point,Fri May 1 03:15:59 2015 UTC,"""You're a Wizard, Harry."""
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,skullyD,4,Fri May 1 03:19:29 2015 UTC,"Not only is Ware not getting any younger, but Miller also isn't going to come on the cheap. Obviously they will do everything they can to keep Von around, but drafting a pass rusher like Ray (should he fall) could be just as much of a replacement as a supplement to Von."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,von_bot,12,Thu Apr 30 20:55:33 2015 UTC,Vonderful
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,flynryan692,3,Thu Apr 30 20:57:20 2015 UTC,"It just hit me, if we don't sign Von there will be no  more von_bot :("
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,BlindManBaldwin,13,Thu Apr 30 21:47:24 2015 UTC,"Luckily, I'm 99% confident Elway would sell the farm to keep Von in Denver, because of Elway's immense self-pride and Von was his first pick."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,BlindManBaldwin,6,Thu Apr 30 21:53:39 2015 UTC,Plus Von is fucking amazing. Also without Manning the Broncos will be able to afford to keep him.
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,BlindManBaldwin,2,Thu Apr 30 22:11:11 2015 UTC,"that is why I think if Peyton doesn't retire at the end of this year, we cut him. Elway will want to pay Von a lot of money, however I also think Von won't get much (relative to guys like Watt and Suh) guaranteed because he got high"
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,i_enjoy_lemonade,3,Thu Apr 30 22:16:14 2015 UTC,"If they keep Manning for 2016, they'll just franchise Von."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,B0RAT,2,Thu Apr 30 22:17:24 2015 UTC,"And then he will just be in line to make even more after that, and DT will be gone if we can't lock him up this year. It is very imperative that Elway gets DT (and maybe even Von?) locked up this year."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,Fatalmistake,2,Thu Apr 30 22:20:46 2015 UTC,"Since he was able to get CHJ locked up long-term, I think Von will get similar treatment this year, and I'm super hopeful that DT will, too."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,hayclaylaybaymaysay,11,Thu Apr 30 22:22:49 2015 UTC,Here I am hoping we draft Cameron Erving.
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,jfoster15,2,Thu Apr 30 21:43:45 2015 UTC,It's certainly still a possibility. We're simply not going to know until the pick is in.

DenverBroncos,34fyz5,d-lo_tha_boss,1 point,Fri May 1 04:21:14 2015 UTC,I want him so badly. I'd be fine if they moved up for him even.
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,CapnMalcolmReynolds,6,Thu Apr 30 22:37:01 2015 UTC,"I do think adding another edge rusher would be great. However, I see a more immediate need at interior o-line and drafting a guy like Erving, Clemmings or trading up for Scherff would be my draft day strategy."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,corybyu,5,Thu Apr 30 21:51:17 2015 UTC,"Hell yes. Say what you want about Elway's drafts sometimes leaving something to be desired, but I do love how committed he is to BPA."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,Randomlntegers,-6,Thu Apr 30 20:51:54 2015 UTC,"Really? Like Osweiler over Foles, Cousins, and Wilson? or maybe Ball over Eddie Lacy?  Elway hasn't proven to be able to take the best player at the position he drafts, much less the best player available."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,NUGGman,5,Thu Apr 30 23:12:43 2015 UTC,"Ehh I never said he picks the best player every time, I'm referring to his strategy of picking the best player available according to the board the front office has put together and not making picks solely based on team needs."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,vecchiobronco,5,Thu Apr 30 23:49:44 2015 UTC,I'm not lamenting the loss of Foles and Cousins lol.  Why did you throw those two guys out first?
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,SuburbanHell,4,Fri May 1 02:18:00 2015 UTC,"Dude, hindsight is 20/20, you could say that about any single team in any draft, nobody gets 100% right.  Did you see Montee in college?  He was a beast, and at the time I was stoked about that pick.  We don't even know how good Osweiler will be, Russell Wilson turned out to be special but he could end up way better than Foles/Cousins."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,SuburbanHell,2,Fri May 1 03:01:15 2015 UTC,"There was the concern over Eddie Lacy, his hamstring(s) and a turf toe surgery so it definitely wasn't as clear cut as we see it today"
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,SuburbanHell,1 point,Fri May 1 03:14:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but I don't say that many teams always get the best available player either. That said, we may have gotten the best available player."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,NUGGman,4,Fri May 1 03:47:25 2015 UTC,"Not surprising, edge rusher is probably the deepest group this year. Elway has said it's a cornerstone to defense, and it'll fit the BPA strategy they got by.  I'd like to see Owoogyboogy or maybe Eli Harold  Gotta be wary of smoke screens though, like the Erving thing. Not that it's unrealistic that the Broncos would pick Erving at 28, but you really think Klis knows?"
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,SuburbanHell,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:13:51 2015 UTC,"It's totally true that everything that comes out until the pick is in is totally up in the air. DE/OLB or OL are for sure going to be the positions in my mind, but goodness knows I don't have a good guess at which it'll be, much less who the player will be."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,bmsuperfly,3,Thu Apr 30 21:16:14 2015 UTC,"Makes a lot of sense, Ware looked tired at the end of the season and it'd be a perfect time to bring in someone young to learn from him and The Vonster (paging von_bot).   That said, I expect we take the best player available regardless of position - assuming we don't trade up to get someone we like."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,bmsuperfly,2,Thu Apr 30 21:07:42 2015 UTC,"Please excuse my ignorance, I've come across a name I'm not familiar with -- who is Sandy Clough?"
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,march20rulez,2,Thu Apr 30 23:00:53 2015 UTC,He's covered the Broncos and Denver sports for more than 30 years. He's a radio guy. He's on 104.3 The Fan from 12-3. He's a grumpy old no-nonsense curmudgeon.
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,bmsuperfly,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:02:38 2015 UTC,Ok thanks.  How reliable would you say his reports are?
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,march20rulez,2,Thu Apr 30 23:52:55 2015 UTC,"This really wasn't a ""report,"" just a ""hey I heard this rumor, there could be something to it.""  The dude doesn't put up with BS and wouldn't mention it if it was a ""rumor"" from someone down at the bar."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,bmsuperfly,1 point,Fri May 1 01:09:21 2015 UTC,"Well the way the O-Line picks are starting to fall, we may have to go D come 28."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,march20rulez,0,Fri May 1 01:10:21 2015 UTC,Much more an expert in Broncos past than Broncos future.
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,bmsuperfly,2,Thu Apr 30 23:22:11 2015 UTC,Pass Rusher -- maybe Mario Edwards Jr.?
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,march20rulez,3,Thu Apr 30 23:01:35 2015 UTC,"I was hoping for Erving, but if they think he's gone before he gets to them and someone like Ray drops I'd be okay with the pick and I may love it depending on day 2-3 picks."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,Anal_Explorer,2,Thu Apr 30 21:47:18 2015 UTC,"With Grasu, Sambrailo, Ogbuehi, Mathias, Dismukes, and other guys available in rounds 2-4, I think the Broncos can play around a little bit with their 1st rounder."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,Puffy_Ghost,3,Thu Apr 30 22:00:58 2015 UTC,"I agree there's a lot of depth there in rounds 2-4. I just really like Erving and think you can put him at C as a rookie and let him set for 5+ years. He keeps getting mocked in the 18-23 range though so I assume they just think he may not be there.   If they take a non o line guy in the first and then pick up some of the mid range guys I'd love the draft overall probably. Just fear those situations where you put off needs because of depth and then midway through day 2 people went quicker than thought. (I don't think it happens especially with Elway, just saying)."
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:12:15 2015 UTC,i feel like we should grab for more of that round2-4 depth if some of our more highly rated guys like erving doesn't fall to us. there really isn't a lot of depth at the top this year and i'd much rather trade back and grab more middle depth.
DenverBroncos,34fyz5,NUGGman,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:57:17 2015 UTC,"I sort of agree. I like a lot of the mid range guys like Tomlinson and Grasu, but passing up on Erving and maybe Humphries is hard if they are there.   I'm also picking La'el in the 6th round 100% of the time if he's available. The upside is too huge that late to not take. If he turned out perfectly fine we would make out like bandits in the draft."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,CryBerry,16,Fri May 1 02:57:23 2015 UTC,"Ware doesn't play every down.  You need a good rotation of rushers to maintain the type of pressure most think Wade will bring.  Quantareus (sp) was Dwares backup, with him gone we needed another pass rusher."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,BornToulouse,7,Fri May 1 03:00:38 2015 UTC,"So the consensus is he will replace Ware if he plays well? That makes sense to me. If so, good pick."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,vearson26,11,Fri May 1 03:03:50 2015 UTC,"OLB - spelling in Ware., rotating in nickel  You draft for the future. Not the next year. This guy is gonna be a book end rusher for years to come with Miller. Ware is old and only made it for half the season last year, need someone to replace him.  He's definitely not a DE in our defense. Wolfe is 6'5"" 290 ish, same with Malik, Ray is 6'4"" 240ish."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,freudianGrip,4,Fri May 1 03:08:41 2015 UTC,"My guess is he'll split time with Ware, but I'm honestly not sure. Maybe he could play some end too."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,qergttj,4,Fri May 1 03:00:31 2015 UTC,Rotation is important. Not every first rounder is going to start 90% of the snaps. It's a relatively weak draft but I think he's a good pick to keep ware fresh and eventually replace ware.
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,Talkingsoftball,3,Fri May 1 03:02:57 2015 UTC,He's too small to be a 3-4 DE. Definitely a rotational OLB
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,BlindManBaldwin,2,Fri May 1 03:31:16 2015 UTC,"They will find a way to get him on the field. Creates 1-on-1 match-ups across the board for the other players if he, miller, and ware are rushing."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,CO_Boiler,2,Fri May 1 03:11:49 2015 UTC,He and Ware will split time as the WOLB.
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,natziel,1 point,Fri May 1 03:24:16 2015 UTC,"Well one thing is, he will probably have surgery for turf toe so probably be out 5-6 weeks if that's the case. Then come in to backup Ware to keep him fresh down the stretch."
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,Spizard,-1,Fri May 1 03:07:35 2015 UTC,DE probably. Whether or not he backs anyone up is up to him
DenverBroncos,34h6l7,natziel,4,Fri May 1 03:00:06 2015 UTC,No.  He will be an OLB in the 3-4

DenverBroncos,34epkd,DirtySnakes,14,Thu Apr 30 15:13:33 2015 UTC,I like how he never gives up trying to live up to the hype his fans generate about him.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Quiggibub,16,Thu Apr 30 16:17:35 2015 UTC,I actually like Montee and was excited when we drafted him..but CJ isnt giving that #1 spot up and I dont expect anyone to take it from him.

DenverBroncos,34epkd,Colorado222,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:57:57 2015 UTC,I was so excited when the Broncos drafted Ball. I knew we had a special guy who is motivated to be the best. I hope the RB position is a constant battle.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,sgrace_wrk,5,Thu Apr 30 20:50:56 2015 UTC,"I can see him maybe getting the #2 spot, but I don't see him beating out CJ. I think CJ has the potential to be the leagues top RB this year."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,flynryan692,2,Thu Apr 30 17:18:02 2015 UTC,There definitely was something when I was watching him last season that screamed elite running back. Let's see what he can do with 16 games.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Alex_801,4,Fri May 1 02:02:07 2015 UTC,"Man, the short institutional memory around here is depressing. Anyone remember his rookie season? Save for his fumbling issues, it was pretty solid overall. He averaged 4.7 ypc on the season; in the second half alone, he averaged 5.23 ypc and, specifically, against KC, he had a whopping NINE YPC.  Last year, he faced the incredibly unlucky combination of injuries and, when he happened to be on the field, shitty o-line play. NONE of this is to detract from CJ -- I love the dude, and until anyone else proves otherwise, I want him to have the starting role forever. But give Ball a break and remember what he can do, as opposed to focusing on what is freshest in your mind."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,baha24,22,Thu Apr 30 22:43:48 2015 UTC,"He can envision it all he wants. It's not going to happen. He'll have to pry the starting job out of CJ's cold, dead hands. After watching both of them, it seems pretty clear that CJ is the superior player for that role."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,johninbigd,5,Thu Apr 30 15:53:26 2015 UTC,"I agree, but I welcome Ball to prove me wrong. I'd love to feel better about management skipping over Lacey."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,mack2nite,3,Thu Apr 30 17:30:38 2015 UTC,"Absolutely. If Ball overtakes CJ, that's still a win for all of us. I love CJ, but if Ball proves me wrong and takes the job, that's awesome for him and us."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,johninbigd,30,Thu Apr 30 17:48:40 2015 UTC,"I think it's way too early to make a call like that. Clearly CJ has the starting position, but I believe Montee can play at that level, and he has shown himself capable at times. Regardless of whether or not he get's the starting position at any point this season, this mentality will push both him and CJ to preform at the highest level possible for the whole season. Everybody wins!"
DenverBroncos,34epkd,johninbigd,10,Thu Apr 30 15:59:03 2015 UTC,"Purely my opinion based on limited data, but the ""eye test"" seems to indicate that CJ has some intangibles that Montee has not demonstrated yet. They're both good backs, though. Should be a fun competition to watch!"
DenverBroncos,34epkd,aatencio91,2,Thu Apr 30 16:02:55 2015 UTC,"They could be a hell of a two headed monster. Peyton should have such a reduced pressure on him this year, and should be fresh as fuck for the playoffs.  God dammit I told myself I wasn't going to see through orange tinted glasses this early in the year."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Alex_801,2,Thu Apr 30 18:04:48 2015 UTC,"I know what you mean. There aren't really stats you can point to, but CJ just runs more confident. He slips through those tight holes (giggity) without hesitation, and he fakes em out so hard sometimes I have to jump out of my chair."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Colorado222,3,Fri May 1 01:59:40 2015 UTC,"Vision I think is what makes the difference here. CJ was hitting holes that Ball wouldn't have tried for... at least that's what I remember seeing. That and CJ had no fear for a bit of trucking, where it would seem Ball would try to figure a way around the guy. If Juwan can get those short yard plays consistently, Ball could find himself on the fringe with Hillman."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,johninbigd,2,Thu Apr 30 18:56:24 2015 UTC,Yep. Exactly my thoughts.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Occams_Lazor_,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:05:18 2015 UTC,It could definitely happen.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Greeney494,-5,Thu Apr 30 19:09:46 2015 UTC,"Ha right, and if CJ Anderson said this last year you'd probably be drooling all over it because Montee Ball has done what to make you hate him as much as you?"
DenverBroncos,34epkd,johninbigd,6,Thu Apr 30 16:07:55 2015 UTC,"If you think I hate Montee Ball, perhaps you need to read more."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Greeney494,-6,Thu Apr 30 16:10:27 2015 UTC,"You pretty much implied that winning the starting job for Montee is a virtual impossibility, calling CJ far superior. Montee has a bad year last year, mainly because he wasn't healthy. They're running a different scheme that may benefit Montee more. So instead of saying Montee has to pry it from ""CJ's cold, dead hands"", I don't know, maybe enjoy that a player wants to win the job this badly and has a ton of motivation to do so? It only helps the Broncos.  Like I said, if CJ said this last year, something tells me you wouldn't be saying ""he has to pry it from Montee's cold dead hands."""
DenverBroncos,34epkd,johninbigd,4,Thu Apr 30 16:15:58 2015 UTC,"Yes, I said that. But you implied that I hated Montee, which is silly.  My point is that, in my fucking opinion, CJ Anderson is the superior back and I feel this is supported by the evidence at hand. Just watch them run the ball! Did you even watch the games? Are you honestly going to tell me that you think Montee is the better back?  I said in another reply that I think both are good backs and that it will be a great competition to watch. I don't hate Montee in any way. I just think CJ is superior. He's already shown us what he can do when it counts. Montee has rarely shown any flashes of anything special. He's another Knowshon Moreno. He runs well, generally, but isn't special. I think CJ has the potential to be special, but again, purely my opinion based on what we've seen so far.  My apologies for having an opinion that differs from yours.

DenverBroncos,34epkd,crueg,2,Thu Apr 30 15:14:40 2015 UTC,He can envision in one hand and shit in the other and see which one fills up faster. Prove it Montee. I'm rooting for you.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Puffy_Ghost,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:58:30 2015 UTC,"Exactly! I'd love if he overtook CJ, and I fucking love CJ. But if he's better? Damn we got one of the best backs in the league!"

DenverBroncos,34epkd,vecchiobronco,2,Thu Apr 30 19:05:50 2015 UTC,After what CJ did there's no way Ball is getting that spot unless CJ breaks both his legs.

DenverBroncos,34epkd,Corrupted_Engineer,1 point,Thu Apr 30 21:00:18 2015 UTC,I think Ball is primed for a breakout year. I have this crazy gut feeling that by the end of the season he will be getting the majority of the carries. I think both will get opportunities early but I just have a feeling Ball will have the bigger year this year.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,ampitupco,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:12:29 2015 UTC,"I have nothing against Montee Ball, but based on his performance with the team so far I really haven't seen anything that leads me to believe that he can improve the team at this time. I'd rather give the ball to Hillman, Thompson, or Anderson instead of him.  All this time with the Broncos, and all the money we've paid him, I don't feel he's really ever impressed. Yes, he's been injured. That doesn't matter."

DenverBroncos,34epkd,Occams_Lazor_,3,Thu Apr 30 18:25:54 2015 UTC,Not with that attitude it wont
DenverBroncos,34epkd,CO_Boiler,-1,Thu Apr 30 22:38:18 2015 UTC,"One of the things that made Ball look good at Whisky, besides their mammoth line, was that he is a very smooth runner, he doesn't make hard changes in direction or plow through contact. He will opt for a spin instead of a jump cut, or dropping his shoulder 9 times out of 10.   And to be honest with everybody about it, I loath that. Putting your back to the play for any amount of time, and putting your balance on such an edge is never good, and not only can be a source of fumbles, but also a source of injury.  But, to get back to Ball again, if our line can make fairly decent size lanes for him, his smoothness can be an asset in deception in a zone scheme since his line change won't be as obvious as CJs might be. But this only applies to Ball if he can get his vision back, and get over all of the hesitation that he had last year. Because sure he was smooth last year, but that was because he never committed to a hole.  I think, and hope, CJ wins out because he runs so angry and decisive, mixed with his elusiveness, but if all of the stars align and Ball actually puts in the work he could make it tight."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Occams_Lazor_,2,Thu Apr 30 18:09:00 2015 UTC,Bro...he is one of the best short yardage backs in college history. Had you watched him move piles? Hes good at it.
DenverBroncos,34epkd,CO_Boiler,-1,Thu Apr 30 19:11:46 2015 UTC,"Yea I have watched him... In person while he was at college. Moving a pile is different than anything that I said. I didn't say he was a weak legged scat back. So I don't know where you are getting that.  Edit: That is also one of the best college offensive lines as well which is huge for any yardage, and their raw size made them monstrous in short yardage anyway before you mention their skill."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,Occams_Lazor_,2,Thu Apr 30 19:27:03 2015 UTC,"He's done it in Denver. Off the top of my head, he did it a couple key times in the AFC Championship."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,chajimak,0,Thu Apr 30 19:43:49 2015 UTC,"As I said that's not what I'm talking about. Let me say it again short yardage moving the pile is not what I'm talking about. I'm talking about he's one on one with a guy in the hole or in the open field he will attempt to spin away from contact. Go look at CJ's highlight tape, and then go choose any of Ball's and then you should be able to see what I'm saying."
DenverBroncos,34epkd,CO_Boiler,2,Thu Apr 30 20:26:39 2015 UTC,"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KQVgEIMKr0U  There are more than a few instances of him running into contact instead of spinning it out. Look around 1:55, 2:55, 4:55, 5:50 and 5:12 for the more impressive ones.  He's not afraid of contact, which is shown by his short yardage ability, and even if he does spin a lot, so what? He's a running back, not a wrecking ball. If spinning can get you more yards than running into a tackle, and also keeping you fresher, go for it."

If that's where we're at, how on earth could we comment? Either he's an immensely valuable and innocent first round pick, or based on information we don't know, he's an undraftable security risk."
DenverBroncos,34frhg,myshkingfh,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:24:34 2015 UTC,"The question is less about us than Elway, but I agree.  Everyone says to take him with a sixth or a seventh - if he's Rae Carruth he still is at six or seven and we still drafted him.  If he's innocent and we take him in the second than he's still innocent.    The reason I ask though is Elway's attitude.  He took Roby last year in the first with some (mild and probably overblown) flags.  He shipped out Perrish Cox and he became an extremely valuable Niner.  It's tough to get a bead on what he thinks so I'm just spitballing.  I think if we draft La'El, wherever it is in the draft, we'll be thrilled if he isn't Carruth.  If we trade down to Mr. Irrelevant and take him there, and the pick blows up, that will smell like garbage for the franchise for a long time.  I just remember that quote, ""I was hired to win championships.""  I wonder if this has a place in the plan."
DenverBroncos,34frhg,ConanBryan,3,Thu Apr 30 20:39:16 2015 UTC,"I would say that Cox was cut because of the court case that involved raping a woman, not necessarily the issues before."
DenverBroncos,34frhg,Twizzle-dizzle,1 point,Thu Apr 30 23:00:59 2015 UTC,"Certainly.  He wasn't convicted though.  Some teams would have probably stood by him though, but Elway didn't.  In my calculus, a lot of it involved Cox not being great yet and dragging stats like DT through the mud by needing to testify at trial."
DenverBroncos,34frhg,mexicutioner23,5,Thu Apr 30 23:11:41 2015 UTC,"If this guy is around when we pick in the 3rd round I'd say take him. The police say he's not a suspect, and because of all the crazy shit that went down with Hernandez people are running away from this kid. Sure there is a risk taking someone with such negative publicity right out of the gate, but if Ray Lewis taught us anything is that you can find yourself in a load of trouble and the public will forget about it and adore you. So this first round talent could possibly plummet so far he may not get drafted (I don't see that happening) so why not take a ""risk"" on a guy and spend one of our second or third day picks on someone who could really change this team?"
DenverBroncos,34frhg,Theingloriousak2,5,Thu Apr 30 21:25:00 2015 UTC,I would be ecstatic if we took him in round 3. Perna had us trading up to 21 to take him just yesterday. He isn't even a suspect. This would be a great risk to take. I still defend the Maurice Clarett pick and this would be much less risky.

DenverBroncos,34frhg,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Thu Apr 30 22:43:38 2015 UTC,If he's still there late like 6th or 7th round sure.   Not sure on that one? Maybe depends how the rest of the draft goes? If they land a OT and Erving early or something might not risk it.

DenverBroncos,34ffia,bottlrcktcowboy,8,Thu Apr 30 18:19:54 2015 UTC,I think there are ways of acquiring a fullback not using a draft pick.
DenverBroncos,34ffia,Greeney494,5,Thu Apr 30 18:45:40 2015 UTC,"Joe Don Duncan and Juwan Thompson are already on the roster, for example."
DenverBroncos,34ffia,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:41:47 2015 UTC,Well trying to convert undrafted free agents into different positions can be tough. I'm saying there are FB's out there in free agency or just wait and give a contract to a FB after the draft.
DenverBroncos,34ffia,Greeney494,3,Thu Apr 30 21:07:26 2015 UTC,"I say we unleash Karl Schmitz as a FB. joking of course, but this dude is an animal"
DenverBroncos,34ffia,troubledhumans,3,Thu Apr 30 19:28:59 2015 UTC,Not that I know of? Maybe? I think most people assume FB is going to be either Thompson or Duncan. If we need to draft one maybe Fowler?
DenverBroncos,34ffia,bmsuperfly,2,Thu Apr 30 18:37:07 2015 UTC,"I gotcha, well whoever picks this dude up is going to have one hell of a player."
DenverBroncos,34ffia,bmsuperfly,3,Thu Apr 30 18:45:07 2015 UTC,I think he could be decent in the league. We just have 4 RBs who deserve time and Thompson makes sense at FB of the bunch and then Duncan is just a wild card at FB/TE.
DenverBroncos,34ffia,cheeseme123,1 point,Thu Apr 30 18:48:20 2015 UTC,"I'm a huge Nick O'Leary fan but I see him as a starting TE, not a converted H-back, plus he is going to go in the 3rd maybe early 4th"
DenverBroncos,34ffia,SuburbanHell,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:33:52 2015 UTC,In Mocks I've run he's all over the place between the 3rd and 5th rounds.
DenverBroncos,34ffia,MileHighPride30,1 point,Thu Apr 30 20:16:35 2015 UTC,I think the plan is to have Duncan and James Casey compete in camp for the FB role. Casey served the the role of H-Back/FB for Kubiak in HOU so I wouldn't be so sure that that isn't the main plan.   I honestly think Juwan would be better off staying at HB. We've seen him have great success as a zone blocking one cut and go guy (see all of his big runs in preseason last year...all were one cut and go stretch plays to the outside). He may be really really good in this new scheme
DenverBroncos,34ffia,bobybushia,1 point,Thu Apr 30 19:34:38 2015 UTC,I wish Unrine was still on the team. That would solve our FB problem.
DenverBroncos,34ffia,loltidderkcuf,1 point,Fri May 1 03:53:55 2015 UTC,Jalston Fowler is a beast. Great blocker who can also catch the ball. Juwan Thompson is already on the team.

DenverBroncos,34azhr,cheeseme123,3,Wed Apr 29 19:09:40 2015 UTC,"I wonder where he'd end up playing for the Broncos? With the coaching staff and Elway talking up Garland, Paradis, and Schofield, it'll be interesting to see where the Broncos decide to play Erving since he's so versatile all along the line."
DenverBroncos,34azhr,aatencio91,2,Wed Apr 29 18:39:12 2015 UTC,The value of his versatility means they can wait and see right?  Develop those guys you mentioned and have the weakest be replaced
DenverBroncos,34azhr,march20rulez,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:25:08 2015 UTC,Exactly. It'll be interesting to see which is the weakest link.
DenverBroncos,34azhr,aatencio91,2,Wed Apr 29 19:28:46 2015 UTC,Probably RT IMO. That seemed the biggest issue last year
DenverBroncos,34azhr,march20rulez,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:32:13 2015 UTC,"Depends on what they want to do with Manny I suppose.  If they want to move Manny back to Guard he'll play C, if they want to keep Manny at Center, I believe we have our new Right Tackle."
DenverBroncos,34azhr,SuburbanHell,1 point,Wed Apr 29 20:40:33 2015 UTC,Center for sure.
DenverBroncos,34azhr,Coos-Coos,7,Thu Apr 30 07:07:00 2015 UTC,"Vasquez (Right Guard) and Clady (Left Tackle) are the only two starters that are locked in right now. I consider C, LG, and RT question marks, so this pick would make sense.   I don't know much about Erving (or this draft class, for that matter), anyone care to share some highlights?"
DenverBroncos,34azhr,Rhinoceroses,16,Wed Apr 29 19:04:10 2015 UTC,"Cameron Erving is the most versatile OL in the draft. It's why Denver wants him so bad- because there are 3 possible positions we can improve upon, yet we have other unproven guys that excel in certain spots but don't have the on-field performance to show they can stick in 1 spot.  Erving can play all 5 spots at an NFL level and that allows Denver to try and use the Schofields and Paradises of the world with little risk"
DenverBroncos,34azhr,not_horatiocaine,8,Wed Apr 29 19:08:09 2015 UTC,"But he's best at center. He was a high recruit and played Left Tackle at Florida State until his year. Because he was struggling at tackle and some injuries, they moved him to center and he performed so well we went from a thirdish round prospect at tackle to a first round prospect at center.   I've been hoping we get him - he may not be there - and we put him at center and let him stay there for ten years. There are a lot of low-first-round right tackles in this draft so my ideal situation is lock down center with Erving in the first round and hope one of those RT guys falls to us in the second."
DenverBroncos,34azhr,myshkingfh,8,Wed Apr 29 19:47:28 2015 UTC,I'm gonna give the completely homer plug to Ty Sambrailo in the 2nd round!
DenverBroncos,34azhr,not_horatiocaine,3,Wed Apr 29 19:57:27 2015 UTC,"Seems like he might be the first guy who is actually likely to be there. I haven't watched him play, but the draft nerds seem to think he needs more functional strength?"
DenverBroncos,34azhr,myshkingfh,2,Wed Apr 29 21:31:12 2015 UTC,Called it!
DenverBroncos,34azhr,not_horatiocaine,3,Sat May 2 02:13:33 2015 UTC,"I might be wrong, but I'm hearing a whooole lot about the Broncos going OL in the draft...which usually means the Broncos won't be going OL in the draft"
DenverBroncos,34azhr,Samcrates,2,Wed Apr 29 23:30:37 2015 UTC,I don't think he will be. He's projected to go in the first 20. Would be a great pickup though!
DenverBroncos,34azhr,indyxetan,2,Thu Apr 30 01:28:08 2015 UTC,"I'm completely okay with this, perfect 1st round pick for us. Potential to be a Pro Bowl C as a rookie. The ability to play RT is nice, but I think he plays C. Unless they end up drafting Grasu later in the draft then who knows."

DenverBroncos,34azhr,TweetPoster,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:36:07 2015 UTC,"my guess if we get Erving, he will play RT and Gino would be starter at Center"
DenverBroncos,34azhr,troubledhumans,3,Wed Apr 29 19:43:03 2015 UTC,If we draft Erving and have him play RT that would be as bad as putting Vasquez at RT last year. Let Erving be the center he was born to be. Gino Gradkowski was the worst center in the league two years ago and barely played last year. I'd be pleasantly but super surprised if he's any good for us.
DenverBroncos,34azhr,myshkingfh,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:51:32 2015 UTC,It would be nice if we could get him in the first round and then maybe Fisher or Grassu in the second

At least there's a lot of good talent on the o-line in the first 3 rounds so if we miss out there's still others who can fill the void."
DenverBroncos,34bbxp,skullyD,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:36:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah I agree, it seems he's definitely the favorite in this sub. I bet we take a gamble since we have 10 picks to trade up and nab him.  If not however, there's plenty of talent left like you said, personal favorites are Reese Dismukes and Hroniss Grasu."
DenverBroncos,34bbxp,SuburbanHell,1 point,Wed Apr 29 22:40:03 2015 UTC,"Yeah I wouldn't be surprised if we move up a couple times in this draft, just to consolidate some of the picks, I know we can't trade away the compensatory ones but that still leaves us with 6 we can move.  My ideal Top 3 Top 3 picks if it could somehow occur would go:  1)Cameron Erving or Jake Fisher or DJ Humphries  2)Maxx Williams or Laken Tomlinson or Mario Edwards Jr.  3)Hroniss Grasu or Ty Sambraillo or AJ Cann"

DenverBroncos,349cwf,natziel,-2,Wed Apr 29 09:55:15 2015 UTC,"I sadly agree that you're probably right, but I do think he should at least get a shot if Osweiler is really being considered. Or at least some recognition from Elway and Media that he is in fact on the team"
DenverBroncos,349cwf,mysterious_pube,7,Wed Apr 29 10:23:43 2015 UTC,"Dysert gets his shot every year, and he was so impressive last year that he was cut and passed waivers.  I like Zac, but he hasn't done much at all to suggest he's NFL QB material."

DenverBroncos,349cwf,SuburbanHell,3,Wed Apr 29 21:43:38 2015 UTC,And he sees so little preseason time because he's not doing well enough in practice to earn more. It's not as if preseason is the only chance he has to show the coaches what he can do.
DenverBroncos,349cwf,Tall_Rassman,2,Wed Apr 29 22:19:20 2015 UTC,"My thoughts:  If he would've shown them that he could be better than Brock they might've kept him on as a 3rd QB instead of relegating him to the practice squad.  Add to that the recent report by Klis that we may be looking to draft a QB and it's clear his fate is probably sealed here.  I think he's got good potential, but I don't think you'll see it here, and I don't think he'll ever be more than a backup anywhere at this point, or he would've shown the team otherwise by now."
DenverBroncos,349cwf,MuzzEmil,3,Wed Apr 29 15:29:26 2015 UTC,"7I literally have never seen him play and know very little about his abilities.

DenverBroncos,349cwf,CO_Boiler,1 point,Wed Apr 29 17:32:21 2015 UTC,"It's not a great way to judge, but in the preseason games in which I saw him play, he looked underwhelming compared to Osweiler, and I've heard that Osweiler outplays him in practice, so I think he's just depth and nothing more.   He was on the practice squad all year last year, so if he had some hidden talent, one of 31 teams would have noticed it and signed him."

I've been to almost every single training camp practice since we picked him, and let me tell you, that dude is awful.  If Dysert were our backup QB, I'd be shitting myself because he would literally throw away (via INT, Fumble, Fumble handoff, Fumbled snap, something) a 4 touchdown lead with 5 minutes to go.  It's a known fact that the backup QB is typically the most popular fan person on the team, and the 3rd stringer only slightly behind. The reason for this is because they are ""unknown potential""... well, Dysert has no NFL potential. He makes Tebow look deadly accurate with the ball and makes Orton look like Mr. Clutch.   When it comes to Dysert, Just.Say.No."

DenverBroncos,348rrj,andrrrew,7,Wed Apr 29 09:10:34 2015 UTC,This Grayson shit is infecting this sub.
DenverBroncos,348rrj,drax117,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:05:25 2015 UTC,Yeah everyone has been bitching about it for months. It's like we shouldn't like the hometown guy who's good and/or hope that he'll stay in town and continue to be good
DenverBroncos,348rrj,aatencio91,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:14:05 2015 UTC,"Except the chances that he'll ever succeed in the NFL are like 3,720 to 1."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,drax117,1 point,Thu Apr 30 00:59:58 2015 UTC,Have you ever watched him? He looks like an NFL quarterback. His chances are no worse than Petty or Hundley.
DenverBroncos,348rrj,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:35:21 2015 UTC,"I've watched little to medium amounts of clips on him.   I'm too lazy to paraphrase, so I'll just ctrl v this, as I pretty much agree. Also should point out, its entirely retarded to go with some untested rookie over Brock. Brock has development, and if we let that go, especially for an untested un heralded rookie, I'm gonna be mad.   ""WEAKNESSES Has a small windup, which slows release. Catch-and-run touchdowns helped inflate his YPA and touchdowns this season. Tape work shows inconsistent decision-making and and a need for faster processing. Gets too locked in on his primary target. Rarely threatens defenses with feet. Lacks improvisation and ability to extend plays. Needs play to stay on schedule. Needs work on anticipation and trusting windows. Slow getting into his drops and scouts want quicker ball handling from him. Shows inconsistent accuracy on short throws into windows against zone. Will run his receivers into big collisions at times.""  What particularly stands out to me is the running and extending the play part. Now Brock isnt the best at this either, but it seems Grayson wants to be a true, statue type pocket passer. Who also reads defenses poorly. This NOT, NOT NOT, the type of QB you want in this day and age. I'm sorry."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,drax117,1 point,Thu Apr 30 05:00:31 2015 UTC,"His weaknesses are things that can be coached. You have to learn to go through reads and tons of guys undergo throwing motion tweaks. Grayson has said himself that he was a running QB coming out of college, and his college coach, Jim McElwain, said ""Garret is very athletic and we didn't take full advantage of that at CSU.""  I'm not advocating for an unproven rookie over Brock, but if Brock decides to go elsewhere once his contract is up after 2015, I'd rather have Grayson than any other QB the Broncos are going to have a shot at in this year's draft. Besides, it's not as though Brock is exactly a proven commodity. If they're both good/decent, how does it hurt the team to have them compete and allow the better of the two to play?  I'm not even saying ""the Broncos should draft Grayson."" I would love for the talented hometown kid to stay here, but there are more pressing needs and I think he'll be gone before the Broncos would want to take him."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Apr 30 06:03:52 2015 UTC,Just like the Maxx Williams thing was a month ago. I personally like Petty better.
DenverBroncos,348rrj,andrrrew,3,Wed Apr 29 21:03:58 2015 UTC,PFM will have to play for pennies or he will have to be cut. We have a more serious issue for the season following this upcoming one.  http://www.spotrac.com/nfl/free-agents/2016/denver-broncos/
DenverBroncos,348rrj,PMeist,0,Wed Apr 29 11:14:00 2015 UTC,"If true, Osweiler is gone.  I would really like to keep him, but he can't keep him around if he has to wait longer than this year. He is good enough that some QB desperate team will pay him more than we are willing to give him at this point.    Zac Dysert to be the immediate backup for Manning while we explore getting another QB.  Dysert might also be our solution, but I still feel he is a solid year or two away from being experienced enough to get a planned NFL start."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,AdaAstra,1 point,Wed Apr 29 16:56:45 2015 UTC,"Oh god no, Dysert is most certainly not going to be anywhere near our solution."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,enjoylol,1 point,Wed Apr 29 18:49:12 2015 UTC,"We haven't seen much of him, so never know.  I tend to agree though. At most, he might be our backup for Manning next year, but if Manning or Osweeler goes, we will definitely be shopping for their replacements.  We will likely just have a transition season where Dysert will be our main backup until we get something better.   I still think Osweiler is our future, but if Manning does come back next season, we are going to have a very difficult time keeping him."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,AdaAstra,1 point,Wed Apr 29 19:00:15 2015 UTC,"We've actually seen a pretty decent amount of him, and he's one of those players you can tell just doesn't have it. At least not yet. Is it possible he can get the right coaching and work on the things he lacks? Of course, but currently he has a very, very long way to go."
DenverBroncos,348rrj,enjoylol,-2,Wed Apr 29 19:02:40 2015 UTC,He should have been cut this year. We have too many guys to re-sign next year and we will NEVER win a superbowl with a qb who's broken and injured by the time the playoffs roll around. I'd like to be wrong but I think that's the truth

Von Miller - We'll sign him. CJ Anderson - Going to be up for a BIG raise.  Will be interesting to see how Montee Ball does this year and whether or not Elway wants to pay this man what a starting RB would cost. Manny Ramirez - Gone, there's a reason we're focusing on OL in the draft this year. Danny Trevathan - Probably signed unless injuries plague him again. Chris Clark - Gone Paul Cornick - Probably re-signed, think he'd only be an RFA at that point? Ronnie Hillman - Gone. Brock Osweiler - If we actually do sign Luck as I joked/suggested above he's gone.  If we don't, he's gotta be re-signed or we're drafting a new one. Zac Dysert - Gone. Brandon Marshall - Re-signed. Ben Garland - Re-signed at the minimum or gone. Derek Wolfe - Not quite sure on this one, could see him gone as easily as I could see him re-sign. Malik Jackson - Re-signed. Marvin Austin - Re-signed. Tony Carter - Gone. Omar Bolden - Re-signed."

Tony Carter is the first one I think needs to go, he makes too much money for being a backup who makes 1 decent play a year then just pure piss the rest of the year, dude needs to go. Manny I think will be gone too, depending on who we draft, we could let a guy like Paradis step into the role, or maybe we end up drafting Erving out of FSU. As much as most of us loved seeing Hillman step up this year and look a hell of a lot better than he did in his first couple of seasons, I think he's going to be trade bait, if he gets some looks this season and does decently, there's teams out there where he'd be an upgrade at rb for them. I don't think there's any way the FO let's Von walk, he's one of the best in the league and they know, I want to say the same for DT, but because we tried on multiple occasions to get a long-term deal done with him before tagging him makes me nervous, so I just hope to god he's around for many years to come."
DenverBroncos,349klg,crueg,1 point,Wed Apr 29 15:38:59 2015 UTC,"Our biggest question marks are Brock and DT.   Von ( I think is a lock), whether we break the bank on Brock is still in question, everyday DT isn't signed I get worse and worse feelings that he's not going to be."
DenverBroncos,349klg,skullyD,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:15:29 2015 UTC,"Eh, I'm not terribly worried. Nearly all of the guys on that list were drafted and developed in Denver, and only Miller and DT are truly critical players. The rest can be replaced (or upgraded) just as they replaced the guys who came before them. Circle of life or whatever. There may well be significant turnover, but the absence of half of those guys would largely go unnoticed. You won't find many people chewing their nails over the loss of Ramirez, Cornick, Clark, Hillman, Dysert, Garland, Austin, or Carter. I'd like to keep Bolden, who I've really come to like because of his ST work, but his loss wouldn't be a major blow, unless he really lights it up this year as a return man.  And Marshall and Anderson are both RFAs in 2016, so paying them is not an issue.   Don't forget that Ware can be released to save 10 mil, if need be. Personally, I think his deal was always intended to be 2 years and not the full 3. 44 mil would pay for Von, DT, and a handful of the better young guys set to be FAs."
DenverBroncos,349klg,mysterious_pube,1 point,Wed Apr 29 13:53:59 2015 UTC,"I guess my main concern would be that there is such a huge number of players on our roster that need re-signing. Like I previously stated I know a lot of these guys, or at the very least a few of them won't be here by this season, and even more will be gone by the end of the season.   But the fact is is we have an average cap space and need to sign several SUPERstars while signing everyone else too. I don't want to see Manny walk. It seems like the past few years we've had AMAZING offensive linemen and we had to let them walk due to lack of cap space. I think Manny can still be good for years to come. I definitely don't want to lose DT. He's going to be a great WR, a top 5 guy for many years and can only help a developing young QB in Brock or someone else.   Plus I've read news stories that in order to keep Brock we will need to sign him to a relatively healthy contract for him. Plus we have so many depth players that I would love to resign. And like I said I guess my main concern is the sheer volume of players that are free agents at the end of the year."
DenverBroncos,349klg,bmsuperfly,0,Wed Apr 29 21:41:19 2015 UTC,"I'm not worried because I think this is Manning's last ride. I also think 7 or so of the guys listed are keepers honestly unless they step up this year. DT, Von, CJ, Trevathan, Marshall, Brock, and one of either Jackson or Wolfe.   I don't see Brock and the pick at DE making that much tbh. Marshall and Trevathan deserve nice raises, but it's not going to break the bank. CJ is a wildcard some years they go like Murray and others go the Forsett route with contracts.   Manny might be worth keeping for depth if he steps back up this year, but for the most part the 2nd stringers are going to start being swapped out with former Kubiak players and rookies over the next 2 drafts."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,baha24,18,Tue Apr 28 14:29:12 2015 UTC,"Odd. Maybe the staff didn't like how he fit in as an end in Wade's defense?  He was a Del Rio project pick, and he showed skills in flashes in pre-season, but I will be completely honest, I forgot he played most of last season.  EDIT: Well there it is. Klis said he failed his physical."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Tue Apr 28 14:51:23 2015 UTC,"So did he fail his physical, or ""fail his physical""?"
DenverBroncos,345nq0,designated_shitter,2,Thu Apr 30 05:51:45 2015 UTC,Yes.  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
DenverBroncos,345nq0,Mister_Jay_Peg,14,Thu Apr 30 05:59:23 2015 UTC,Broncos veteran physicals were yesterday. Word is that it's unlikely to be related.   Edit: it is related.
DenverBroncos,345nq0,charlesbelmont,3,Tue Apr 28 15:04:10 2015 UTC,Seems odd to me to do it now. Can anyone explain the timing to me?
DenverBroncos,345nq0,Danserud,7,Tue Apr 28 14:39:03 2015 UTC,"He failed his physical. He was a pass rusher. I think it's indicative of their draft plans. They want a DE/Pass rusher to compliment Von and spell DeMarcus Ware, and to add depth to the DL."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,aatencio91,15,Tue Apr 28 16:23:01 2015 UTC,It's Miller time!
DenverBroncos,345nq0,von_bot,9,Tue Apr 28 16:24:30 2015 UTC,I love you.
DenverBroncos,345nq0,aatencio91,5,Tue Apr 28 16:34:29 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, von_bot only has eyes for Von."

DenverBroncos,345nq0,Danserud,2,Tue Apr 28 16:44:22 2015 UTC,"Hmm, this is odd. Maybe he did something bad and got himself cut"
DenverBroncos,345nq0,xamo,2,Tue Apr 28 14:42:53 2015 UTC,"Good thing is, is that we already have Anunike, and he seemed to be producing at a higher level than Smith anyway in preseason."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,CO_Boiler,1 point,Tue Apr 28 15:41:47 2015 UTC,"So now its def looking like Round 1 they will draft a tackle, 2 & 3 will be pass rushers"
DenverBroncos,345nq0,troubledhumans,3,Tue Apr 28 15:55:50 2015 UTC,"Why pass rushers? They are definitely not positions of need for this year. Ware and Von got it for this year, and probably next year.   IF we draft for BPA and not for need, I would hope Shane Ray or Vic Beasley would fall to us."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,bcos4life,2,Tue Apr 28 17:19:36 2015 UTC,Ware is getting older. He can't keep steady production through 16 games and a playoff run.
DenverBroncos,345nq0,DominizZzle,3,Tue Apr 28 19:52:17 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree at all. And I like the idea of having depth at an important position.  But I see MAJOR holes along the O Line. We have no clear LG, C, or RT and Clady didn't exactly play to form last year.   Our TE crew is either over the hill or a blocking TE.  Our starting NT is only that because he is a first round pick that has yet to live up to expectations.  Our ILB's are kind of small and moving to a scheme that they don't fit.   Our starting FS is made of glass.  One of the positions that we have two legit Pro Bowlers at is OLB. I would rather take a late round gamble on that position, than pass up positions that we desperately need."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,bcos4life,1 point,Tue Apr 28 20:10:42 2015 UTC,"Elway himself said You can never have too many pass rushers. With Ware having maybe a few seasons left (maybe not even that if injury comes up) I feel like Denver will want to solidify their defensive depth and become a lot more rotational than they have in the past. Obviously no one knows until the draft is over with, but I feel like Rounds 2-4, we have a good shot at getting some good talent on the defensive side of the ball."
DenverBroncos,345nq0,troubledhumans,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:31:39 2015 UTC,So I guess we're drafting a DE now.
DenverBroncos,345nq0,SuburbanHell,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:31:56 2015 UTC,Well didn't expect that I sort of expected big things from him this year. Looks like Edge depth is a priority now.

DenverBroncos,3464f0,dabroncosman,2,Fri May 1 02:46:51 2015 UTC,I'm pretty pumped. Von/Ray can be Mathis/Freeney
DenverBroncos,3464f0,dabroncosman,3,Fri May 1 02:58:37 2015 UTC,Von miller Shane Ray and Demarcus ware is a nasty pass rush trio
DenverBroncos,3464f0,bruski,3,Fri May 1 02:59:58 2015 UTC,Excellent call!!
DenverBroncos,3464f0,skullyD,4,Fri May 1 04:52:14 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't mind drafting Ray actually, I know he's got some Pot issues as of late but he and Von could pair up together and hopefully grow out of this issue.  IF he slipped to us, I wouldn't mind taking him.... In the first round? I'm honestly a little hesitant, maybe if he fell to the second if we traded up to get him?"
DenverBroncos,3464f0,von_bot,11,Tue Apr 28 16:41:27 2015 UTC,More like Von Master of Sacks
DenverBroncos,3464f0,SuburbanHell,2,Tue Apr 28 16:42:43 2015 UTC,"I wasn't remotely interested in picking him up, but now that we've cut Quanterus, it may make sense -- though I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with taking him in the 1st.    Sure, O-Linemen are not sexy picks but we totally need at least one of each position there so I still want to see us going offense first and then starting to fill in the defense and other gaps from the 3rd or 4th round on.  Edit:  In light of reading he's a gotten into trouble with pot, fuck him, he needs to stay as far away from Von Miller as he possibly can."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,SuburbanHell,-2,Tue Apr 28 16:40:40 2015 UTC,"Haha I just don't see his pot indictment citation yesterday becoming a long-time problem, especially when he's with Von. I think Von has it figured out, and I don't see Von saying ""ah, this rookie invited me over for a joint... I'll probably go."""
DenverBroncos,3464f0,CO_Boiler,2,Tue Apr 28 16:50:26 2015 UTC,"I just don't want to take the chance, Von's 1 slight in judgment away from level 3, I don't see him saying it either but hey let's say they win a huge game and they both had put up monster stats on the field that day, some of the team is out partying, someone in the new guy's entourage passes some shit around, unexpected drug test the day after, Von's fucked.  No thank you."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,CO_Boiler,0,Tue Apr 28 16:56:26 2015 UTC,"He got busted days before the draft, days before the biggest day in his life, where he knows his future is on a tight rope whee any little slip could completely change his life, and he went out and got high, and got busted... You don't see that as an issue? Do you really think this was the first time that he has smoked? If you don't question his commitment even slightly then that is being naive. I don't care that somehow you consider Missouri a stone throw away from where it is legal, considering it's actually over 700 miles away, that's one hell of a throw for one, and for another it's illegal there, and it's illegal in the league.   He won't drop that far to us, but to dismiss the issues completely, is irresponsible."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,TheoneandonlyTate,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:33:14 2015 UTC,"I don't care that somehow you consider Missouri a stone throw away from where it is legal, considering it's actually over 700 miles away, that's one hell of a throw for one, and for another it's illegal there, and it's illegal in the league.    It's legal within the city limits of Columbia, close to where he was caught. If he were caught in Columbia, no NFL team would ever know and no one would be freaking the fuck out about it.  You people are way overreacting about him being pulled over for speeding and slapped on the wrist for having marijuana in his possession. He wasn't even intoxicated. Having it =\= being high"
DenverBroncos,3464f0,CO_Boiler,2,Tue Apr 28 17:42:12 2015 UTC,"Ok that's fine, but did you just see what happened to Dion Jordan today? Suspended for the entire 2015 season, and his test wasn't even positive. That's the third stage of offenses, Von is at stage 2, if he gets caught with it, that will not be good. And you still have him in posession of a drug where it is illegal. Let's not make excuses for everybody for once. He screwed up, and now one of the consequences is that he will be scrutinized more closely, and I believe he will be on stage one of the program. So you want to have both of your future edge rushers to already have knocks against them for drugs...   Looking at this logically, even if he is there at 28, I doubt we would take him, due to the fact we never interviewed him, and then this happening. If this had happened a month ago and then we interviewed him I would give it a better chance, but without the interview there will be no first hand judgement on who he is, and thus a complete shot in the dark based on what you think he is. That lowers the odds a fair amount."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,CO_Boiler,3,Tue Apr 28 18:09:47 2015 UTC,"I just don't understand why everyone is so damn sure that bringing in a rookie will send Von into this huge downward spiral and get him back into drugs. Ray has no knocks against him for drugs in the NFL. He's not a player in the NFL so his ticket for possession means nothing other than he'll have a close eye on him. Von is two years clean, why would he fall off just because there's some new kid in town?  Ray won't fall much, if at all, because everyone in the league knows that his infraction is something that can be corrected and his talent level is high.   EDIT: Correction, I said it meant nothing for him since he's not yet an NFL player, but he is now enrolled in Phase 1 of the substance abuse program."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,CO_Boiler,3,Tue Apr 28 18:14:18 2015 UTC,"I love that some people seem to think that suddenly if we get this new guy, Von will be tempted to pick back up pot use. As if there isn't pot all over this city anyways. One guy who was caught with some in his car suddenly appearing won't really change things that much, I feel like."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,CO_Boiler,3,Wed Apr 29 21:13:32 2015 UTC,"Seriously, reading through these comments you'd think that drafting Shane Ray would be the equivalent of sending Von on a month long cannabis cruise with Bob Marley, The Grateful Dead, and Phish."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,BlindManBaldwin,2,Wed Apr 29 21:19:23 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure, but it is useful to put it in perspective. And also the two would be paying side by side, similar in a lot of ways and so they would probably bond pretty close, and that could lead to greater temptation. Like I say he went make it to us anyway. The fact is even if it didn't count as a strike against him, you have to question him and his thought process, and thus his commitment. You have to ask that, because of the consequences."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,SuburbanHell,-3,Tue Apr 28 18:26:07 2015 UTC,"Are you interested in facts whatsoever? He was not high, he was not drunk, he was not even detained. He was issued the equivalent of a traffic ticket for possession. That's it.  None of you would be having a meltdown if this was a speeding ticket instead. They are the same thing legally."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,BlindManBaldwin,3,Tue Apr 28 17:41:15 2015 UTC,"Are you interested in facts at all? It's illegal it is prohibited in the NFL. Dion Jordan was just suspended for an entire year today and his test was negative, but was diluted, that's how strict it is. And I could be wrong but I'm about 95% certain, him being in possession puts him in the first stage of the NFL drug program before he's even drafted. So no people wouldn't ""freak"" out about a speeding ticket, because that has no consequence in the league. Put it this way if that doesn't make sense, Von gets caught in possession, anywhere other than Colorado possibly but even then the league could come down in him, he's gone for a year because he already has 2 strikes.   It's not the legality of the ticket, it's the consequences in the league."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,SuburbanHell,-2,Tue Apr 28 18:16:55 2015 UTC,You don't understand league rules as well as you think you do.
DenverBroncos,3464f0,not_horatiocaine,2,Tue Apr 28 18:18:16 2015 UTC,Then enlighten me. Tell me what would happen if he got caught in possession after the draft. Because I'm pretty sure he gets suspended.  Edit: I also applaud you in avoiding the main point of the issue as well in the difference between being in possession and a speeding ticket. Should probably be glad he wasn't taken in and tested as well.
DenverBroncos,3464f0,SuburbanHell,-3,Tue Apr 28 18:27:50 2015 UTC,"I'm not avoiding it, I just don't consider it an issue. Learn the difference. He couldn't be taken in and tested, that would have been illegal given a lack of probable cause. The officer himself is quoted as smelling unburnt cannabis. There was no legal standing for the officer to either detain or test him. Learn your rights.   You have no clue what you are talking about.   Pre or post draft is irrelevant, the NFL could take action now if it wanted - however, NFL has already announced it isn't taking disciplinary action.  Please go away."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,mayorscurvy,2,Tue Apr 28 19:15:13 2015 UTC,"Except they have taken action... He is in stage one of the substance abuse program. So you are wrong there to start with. And second of all if the officer smells pot or anything like that, that gives him probable cause to search the vehicle... Which he did, because he wrote him a ticket. Now on top of that since he was in possession, he could have been taken in for a drug test to determine if he was driving while impaired. No different than an officer smelling booze, or seeing it sitting there, they can make you take a field sobriety test, and if you refuse, they take you for a blood test, because that is probable cause. The difference being there is no field sobriety test for pot, so he would have to be taken in and tested, but who knows how that charge goes because nobody has set a legal limit threshold for operating a motor vehicle while high, and could be argued that he wasn't impaired. But none the less it would be more severe. So, again wrong and simply wanting to make excuses for him. So don't tell me to go away when you attack me about not knowing facts when yours are wrong."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,qergttj,-3,Tue Apr 28 19:43:23 2015 UTC,"Didn't even read past your first sentence. You have no fucking clue what you are talking about. The Substance Abuse Program is controlled by doctors independent of the NFL or NFLPA. The NFL has announced it is not taking action.   I'm assuming the rest of your comment has something to do with you not understanding the law and your legal rights when you get stopped by a police officer.   Thanks for playing, come back when you have a clue."
DenverBroncos,3464f0,Bilyman,-4,Tue Apr 28 19:48:49 2015 UTC,"Indictment? He got a ticket. He was not detained, arrested, or indicted on criminal charges.   Are you people interested in facts at all?"

DenverBroncos,343zd2,vindawg08,3,Tue Apr 28 22:53:35 2015 UTC,He's intriguing if he were to fall and sometimes you take the BPA even if you're totally set at that position. We took Roby who fell because of off the field issues and it worked out well.   If he's there and Erving and Humphries are off the board I wouldn't be surprised if we took him. Then again maybe it's a prime way to trade down and get a free 4th. It's an interesting twist.
DenverBroncos,343zd2,bmsuperfly,1 point,Tue Apr 28 04:18:30 2015 UTC,"I said it once yesterday, but Roby fell mostly because his last season as OSU was awful. It wasn't really his fault, his coaches didn't use him how he was supposed to be used (Off vs Press), but nonetheless his last season turned a lot of teams off in a decent CB class."
DenverBroncos,343zd2,MasonL52,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:05:39 2015 UTC,"I agree it had a bit to do with both just as Ray;s will be some injury some off the field issues, but he was still projected top 15 even with a bad season and fell to us, some teams definitely take notice of off the field issues and don't touch people because of them."
DenverBroncos,343zd2,bmsuperfly,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:11:11 2015 UTC,"He was also in a very good CB class, Gilbert, Fuller, Verrett and Denard all went and were rated higher than him. Hadn't there been 4 CBs with 1st round grades I don't think he of fell to us."
DenverBroncos,343zd2,MasonL52,1 point,Tue Apr 28 16:15:00 2015 UTC,This is true and there's not that amount of depth with Ray this year. I just feel like he's been all over people boards even before the pot. Those are the people that tend to fall in the first and I'm not sure there is a in between with him. He either goes top 12 like projected before or he's falling a bit until the 20s Imo.
DenverBroncos,343zd2,bmsuperfly,2,Tue Apr 28 16:19:49 2015 UTC,Von can hook him up with the good shit.
DenverBroncos,343zd2,Fridden,2,Tue Apr 28 09:55:03 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't like this. It wouldn't be the worst use of pick but not one I'd be super happy about.  First off he gets busted for weed a few days before the draft. That's dumb. I dont care if you smoke weed, but Jesus if youre going to be a professional football player be more responsible than that. His off the field issues didn't concern me until that, and bringing him into a legal weed state while you can still get suspended for it doesn't appeal to me.  Second off, he's bad against the run. He has Top-10 pass rushing talent, but he can get abused in the run game. After having two Top-5 rushing defenses in a row I'd hate to see a big liability in there.  He can be coached, and he'd have the best mentors in Von/Ware to teach him, but it'd be a very risky pick."
DenverBroncos,343zd2,MasonL52,0,Tue Apr 28 16:10:24 2015 UTC,"You really have that much problem with someone getting busted for possession? He wasn't intoxicated at all and walked away with a citation. He wasn't even detained let alone arrested. This is the legal equivalent of a speeding ticket.   Would you be that against it if he got a ticket for speeding instead of possession?   Would you have passed on Roby last year too because of his minor off field issues?   I'm a fan of taking the best player available, and there's not a better organization in the NFL for him to find his way in either."
DenverBroncos,343zd2,MasonL52,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:11:08 2015 UTC,"He already had off the field issues, but getting caught with weed three days before the draft? Does that not raise any concerns for you? That says a lot, is he ready to be a professional? Look at what happened to Dion Jordon, would you of been happy if we picked him up?  I also personally believe we have too many other needs to draft a LB who can't play the run."
DenverBroncos,343zd2,ThreezusManning,0,Tue Apr 28 17:43:15 2015 UTC,"No it doesn't. He's not beating his girlfriend or kids, he's not murdering people,  he's not fixing games, he had some cannabis in the car... I really, really couldn't care less about something like a 100$ traffic ticket.   For every Dion Jordan there is a Von Miller and Bradley Roby.   And really, if GM's don't care, you shouldn't care.

DenverBroncos,343zd2,justwingingit,3,Tue Apr 28 17:58:11 2015 UTC,I'd honestly love the pick if he fell to 28. He has top 10 talent and I have faith in Von in Ware to be mentors to him.
DenverBroncos,343zd2,PMeist,1 point,Tue Apr 28 05:18:31 2015 UTC,It's interesting that he's slid this far and now will drop even further with this issue. It'd be a huge get for any team w/ his talent in the 2nd round or after since he was previously projected as a top 10 guy earlier this year.
DenverBroncos,343zd2,Beaudasious,1 point,Tue Apr 28 03:29:11 2015 UTC,First off I need to ask how good of a prospect is he? Before any kind of potential fall off how high of a prospect is/was he and why?  I am a firm believer in the BPA philosophy. You are taking risks no matter who you draft. Even Big Al on 104.3 last week made the point that if you take the BPA and he winds up being an NFL stud then you can build around that position of strength. Al then cited a few cases of teams passing on guys and went to other teams and became studs. One guy I remember him talking about was Dont'a Hightower.
DenverBroncos,343zd2,chordnine,1 point,Tue Apr 28 11:44:43 2015 UTC,Before the turf toe injury he was a top 5 pick. The best pass rusher in the draft (Gregory has more speed but no bulk or technique) he is only average against the run however. The injury has dropped hi as many fear he will require surgery to fix it and may not be able to fully contribute until mid season (about the time that Ware will need to start wearing down and will need more rest). For a broncos team that is likely to lose Ware next off-season it's a great pick to insure that we continue to be a top 5 D every season in terms of sacks.
DenverBroncos,344bva,DefenderCone97,6,Tue Apr 28 04:50:32 2015 UTC,"With that name, how could he not be good? I think he has potential. It'll be interesting to watch him in preseason."

DenverBroncos,344bva,CO_Boiler,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:45:42 2015 UTC,"I don't know where I read that but I guess it was wrong. Maybe it said only tight end draft prospect. Still though, being from a small school like that and being signed by a NFL team is rare. His versatility definitely helps his case to make the team. He has experience at fullback, tight end and long snapper."
DenverBroncos,344bva,WhippedCocaine,4,Wed Apr 29 01:09:20 2015 UTC,"It's a good low risk signing, I'd say. He's more fluid and athletic than you'd expect someone with his build would be, though he's definitely not what I'd call quick. Really rounds off his routes, doesn't sink his hips, heavy legs, though he does flash a decent stutter step now and then. Not enough to consistently get open in the NFL, but it's something to build on, at least. He's strong as an ox, though, with good hands. With his size, strength, and ability to catch the ball away from his body, he should still be capable of using his body to box out defenders for short completions now and then. He does need to clean up his blocking, but that seems like more of a technique issue than a willingness or ability issue. Oh, and he's an emergency long snapper. That's always nice to have.  He's never going to be Gronk, but if he can manage to stay healthy, he can be valuable TE/FB depth. Giving him some NFL quality medical care, training, and nutrition, three things I'd wager he didn't have at Dixie State, should help with his injury problems.   So, yeah, I like the signing. Cheap, lots of upside, and painless to release if he doesn't work out or suffers another injury. His Pro Day tape, if anyone is interested."
DenverBroncos,344bva,mysterious_pube,1 point,Tue Apr 28 13:14:19 2015 UTC,"I think he could be good, but there's no way he makes the team. With James Casey on the team, he's redundant. I think the best he (we) can hope for is that he looks good in preseason, stays with us on the practice squad until James Casey's contract is up and signs on as his replacement and does pretty well. I would honestly be shocked if he made the 53 man roster this season."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,SaltLakeBronco,29,Mon Apr 27 22:28:04 2015 UTC,"Serious question: Why is everybody so hyped about taking a QB this year? It's a bad draft for QBs and we have someone we have been developing for 3 years, and another guy who's been developing for 2 years. How many QBs do we need to compete for the #2 spot right now? Late round draft guy, or undrafted to try out? Sure, but I guess I just don't understand the purpose of having 4 QBs on the roster. Or let's say they draft Grayson in the second, and they cut Dysert, what are you going to do? Carry 3 guys on the 53 man roster?  Cuz you aren't going to get Grayson on the practice squad, somebody will scoop him up and you'll have wasted a 2nd rounder on they're QB.   Why not wait for next year? Yes we may not have Peyton to teach the new guy anything then, but logistically, and logically it makes way more sense. Next year should also be a stronger QB draft.  If we decide to take a QB early I'm not going to be pissed, but I'm going to raise an eyebrow a bit. I just feel like I must be missing something, so if somebody wants to help out that would be great."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,CO_Boiler,2,Mon Apr 27 23:43:11 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if we take one in the first 3 rounds I'm going to question it unless we made a trade or something and have extra picks and even then I may never get it."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,bmsuperfly,4,Tue Apr 28 00:03:06 2015 UTC,"Agreed. And just look at next year, the Big Ten alone will have up to 6, 1st to 2nd round QBs coming out next year, with some others in the 4-5th round area."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,CO_Boiler,2,Tue Apr 28 00:10:50 2015 UTC,"Yeah I don't really get it. I can maybe understand the year under Peyton worth it, but anything early in the draft doesn't make sense to me. Next year is definitely a better year for QB. I'd rather just go O-line to make sure we can keep Brock off the turf when he does get his chance."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,bmsuperfly,1 point,Tue Apr 28 00:13:33 2015 UTC,"it's mostly just fodder for stories on most websites. when most people talk about it around here, they're the people that can't remember peyton had a damn injured quad and are acting like he's done and we're screwed without him, because having a bunch of other pro bowlers on your roster means shit, apparently. personally, i wouldn't mind seeing a 3/4+ rounder drafted as competition for the lobster, it'd be good for him."

I'm all about the Rams, but I'm just thinking that this might be a reason some fans want us to draft a QB"
DenverBroncos,3431hh,Doomy22,1 point,Tue Apr 28 02:34:19 2015 UTC,"what are you going to do? Carry 3 guys on the 53 man roster?   This FO is fond of hiding players on IR. They carried 3 quarterbacks for bits of last year and the year before with Manning/Osweiler/Dysert. I wouldn't be stunned to see a QB taken in round 3 or later (personal order: Grayson, Petty, Mannion), and see Dysert put on IR while they carry Manning/Osweiler/Rookie, and then in camp next year the young guys battle it out."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,aatencio91,0,Tue Apr 28 16:43:08 2015 UTC,"They never carried 3 last year on the active roster, and two years ago they carried 3 but never did the squirrel one away on IR? So I'm really confused about what you are saying about that."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,CO_Boiler,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:03:52 2015 UTC,"I didn't say they squirreled away a QB. Larentee McCray and Quanterus Smith are two of the guys that the Broncos have put on IR to keep around while not taking up spaces on the 53. I thought that the Rams were interested in Dysert early last year and the Broncos had to promote him to the 53 to keep him, but I guess I'm mistaken on that one."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:09:25 2015 UTC,"No Dysert was on the practice squad the whole year. But those two you mentioned had legitimate injuries that kept them off of the 53 man... Smith was trying to rehab from knee injury, the same with McCray."

It's the most valuable position on a team and if you don't think you have the future solidified, then you should always be drafting more.  Since Brady was drafted I think we're in the top third of the league in drafting QB's. Just because you have the current answer, doesnt mean you should be looking to the future."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,hecticlorax,0,Wed Apr 29 02:25:26 2015 UTC,"FYI, Peyton and Tom Brady are not interested in teaching anything to the young guys, they consider that the qb coaches job. Their responsibility is to prepare as the starting qb."

It seems like Brock has been learning quite a bit from Peyton since he follows him around like a puppy."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,aatencio91,5,Tue Apr 28 16:45:16 2015 UTC,"If we wait until a later round to pick a QB, we can pick up Connor Halliday. Dude has an arm."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,gollfprodude,6,Mon Apr 27 23:02:41 2015 UTC,I'd rather this than take Grayson too early since we should be filling those holes at O-Line & Safety before taking something we don't need.

DenverBroncos,3431hh,crueg,3,Tue Apr 28 00:06:06 2015 UTC,I'm fine with bringing in competition later on after the few needs we have are addressed.
DenverBroncos,3431hh,bmsuperfly,3,Tue Apr 28 00:01:46 2015 UTC,"I don't get your downvotes at all, we need guys on the O line, we need a TE, we need a run stopping 0 technique NT, and we need guys in the secondary.  QB should be the last fucking thing they waste a draft pick on."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,CalmingCollection,4,Tue Apr 28 02:38:57 2015 UTC,"I don't know sometimes as far as votes go. I thought it was pretty obvious that we were bringing in probably 2 O line guys (maybe 3 depending on Kubiak's trust on Paradis/Schofield), a NT that can give competition to Sly if not just outright win the starting job, and a FS encase moving a corner over or Stewart doesn't pan out.   I could see us taking a TE easily, but I'm not sure if I label it a need, I feel the same way on LBs. I'm pretty high on Virgil and Daniels and Casey for depth. We don't really have that many needs outside of O-line. The FS and DT picks are for competition and depth. We have 10 picks and with 4-5 needs then we have plenty of room to do whatever we want.   I just think if they come out and take a QB in the 2nd round I'm going to be pretty upset when it's announced. If they grab one in the 5th round after addressing the needs then I'm completely okay with it."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,bmsuperfly,2,Tue Apr 28 02:45:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah if they take a bluechip QB in the later rounds I won't mind it, but there are, as you said, quite a few spots where competition is needed, and where new people are needed period.  I like Daniels and Casey too, and actually the signing of those two leads me to believe Maxx Williams isn't in Elway's plans unless he somehow falls to the 3rd or 4th round... not gonna happen though."
DenverBroncos,3431hh,CalmingCollection,3,Tue Apr 28 02:50:29 2015 UTC,I could see Erving 1st Maxx 2nd O line 3rd Prewitt 4th and then move up and grab a DT in the 4th. Then fill out the draft with a bluechip QB and a extra LB and Edge rusher for depth.   8 picks and we have 10. Man if only it went this way I would be so hyped. Especially if the O-line in the 3rd was someone who dropped. Dream draft probably if that happens.
DenverBroncos,3431hh,bmsuperfly,2,Tue Apr 28 02:55:12 2015 UTC,Sounds like a sound draft plan to me!  You should email Elway haha
DenverBroncos,3431hh,CalmingCollection,3,Tue Apr 28 02:57:04 2015 UTC,I have a feeling the other teams won't go by the script though. If they did though I could totally be a GM lol.

DenverBroncos,3431hh,CalmingCollection,3,Tue Apr 28 03:05:46 2015 UTC,"No faith in Osweiler? I didn't see the need to take Dysert either but I would rather have him than someone late in this years draft, I'd at least give Brock a chance and fill our holes now"
DenverBroncos,3431hh,The-Bigdeal,1 point,Mon Apr 27 23:42:38 2015 UTC,"Its nothing to do with Brock. Most teams take at least one QB in the draft, and probably every team has at least one new body for camp. Its a hard position to find talent in, teams are constantly on the hunt."

DenverBroncos,345d4z,SuburbanHell,-12,Tue Apr 28 13:01:04 2015 UTC,I think it happens pretty regularly. Teams will draft corners when other teams draft top wide receiver talent and so on.

DenverBroncos,345d4z,johanspot,3,Tue Apr 28 15:24:23 2015 UTC,Teams will also draft corners when other teams don't draft a top wide receiver. It would be incredibly shortsighted to base your draft strategy off of what 1 other team in the league does with their draft. Even more ridiculous given that drafting a rookie QB is about taking a step back short term in this situation.

DenverBroncos,345d4z,PMeist,4,Thu Apr 30 02:17:35 2015 UTC,The vast majority of drafting comes down to 'we have a plan to build a team that will win (against any team).' It's all about finding the right talent in the right places and building them up into one solid unit. It's not about what other teams have or draft.   Why would we worry about Mariota going to SD at all? Could he be good? Sure. Will he? Probably not. Bust rates are high among NFL QB's and if after two seasons he's busted out of the NFL and we've only drafted to stop him then we are fucking idiots.  You draft to build the best team you can to win as much as you can. And you take what talent and what positives you do have to SCHEME to beat other teams and players.

Mariota can have all the speed he wants, but he'll still be a rookie QB in a new system. Our defense would eat him alive.  Plus, as others have stated, changing our draft strategy because of another team is a little silly. We go for the best players available, based on our own needs, to build the best team we can."
DenverBroncos,345d4z,chingy1337,1 point,Tue Apr 28 17:02:34 2015 UTC,"Proven, veteran QB's like Tom Brady and Peyton Manning change draft strategies. First year, unproven QB's do not."
DenverBroncos,343i8p,RoxNboxdawgs,10,Tue Apr 28 00:36:52 2015 UTC,"I admire your confidence in our offensive line situation, but in my opinion, center and right tackle are still very iffy.   We've got options at center, but none of them are very inspiring. Gino Gradkowski has potential but fell flat in Baltimore, Manny Ramirez has experience but is probably better off as a backup center/guard, and Matt Paradis would have to be spectacular in training camp to win the job as a former 7th rounder.   Right now, there's only two realistic options at right tackle with Vasquez moving back inside. Paul Cornick is a quality backup, but I believe that's all he'll ever be. Michael Schofield has the potential to be a solid starter, but the most troubling thing in my mind is that he never even sniffed the field last year, despite all of the problems we had on that side of the line.  I agree with Elway that best player available is the way to go in the first round, but I really hope that player is someone like Cameron Erving (fingers crossed) or Ereck Flowers. And if we get an offensive lineman in the first, he'll almost certainly be a day 1 starter. Otherwise, if it's really any other position, I agree with you.  The front 7 looks solid, and all of the skill positions are pretty much set. The rest of the draft will likely be all depth moves."
DenverBroncos,343i8p,Bigred27,1 point,Tue Apr 28 01:23:37 2015 UTC,"I'm betting on Gradkowski to bounce back, sometimes second chances work out. Also I feel like with the nature of the league guys don't get enough of a shot, dude only played 2 yrs for Ravens. Definitely think he can do better with more experience. On Cornick and Schofield: scouted by John Elway's scouts and drafted by John Elway, a former quarterback who won super bowls with an athletic line running a zbs. I think they both will do fine. Also they both are more familiar with PFM than anyone else, so as long as they can outplay Manny, they will likely start due to system familiarity. I feel like they might have tried to retain Orlando Franklin if they weren't confident in the guys they had to replace him at RT/LG. Vasquez goes back to guard and the pro bowl."

Only rookie we let play last year was Roby a defensive player, who benefitted from Tony carter and Omar Bolden being on the roster, and he outplayed Kayvon. All after falling to us in the draft unexpectedly.   Edit: I don't mean to knock Roby he is good, but of we had a decent veteran Fox and Del Rio would have started him over Roby probably."

I'm willing to give any young player a few years to show what they've got before writing them off, regardless of their draft position. Hell, we've got a 5th rounder and a 7th rounder starting at inside linebacker next year, and a UDFA that went from the end of the roster to being a top 5 cornerback. Paradis has a mountain to climb to prove himself, but they're keeping him on the roster for a reason, and I won't count him out yet, especially considering who he's competing with for the job."

If Denver is really in a position to draft only depth guys this year they can spend a pick to get the standout punter in this draft and save serious cap space by cutting Britton.
DenverBroncos,343i8p,Bronc27,2,Tue Apr 28 03:23:14 2015 UTC,Punter in the first round... called it. /s

I think I have less confidence in the Oline than you do though. I'd be surprised if we do not have one rookie starting on that line."
DenverBroncos,343i8p,Fridden,2,Tue Apr 28 01:09:09 2015 UTC,If we don't have a rookie starting somewhere on the offensive line then something went terribly wrong. Either on draft night or in training camp.

DenverBroncos,34234k,aatencio91,5,Mon Apr 27 18:24:46 2015 UTC,"First choice: Cameron Erving  Hes versatile, he can play C or RT. His floor is high, some say that he could be an immediate pro bowler at C. While I'd prefer a G or T before a C, he'd be the best player we could take at a need.  Second choice: Dj Humphries  He can also play T or G, he also can play at a higher level immediately.   third choice Tj Clemmings  He'd need a little work, but if I trust anyone to make an OL work it's Kubiak. He'd fit in as our RT if he progresses enough.   Other choice Demourius Randall  Fuck if I know how to spell his first name on hand, but if somehow all of those guys are gone I don't believe there's another OL worth a 1st, Randell is the best FS prospect and is supposed to be a lot of teams emergency 1st, I suspect us to be one of those teams.  2nd Round: Laken Tomlinson  There's a good chance he'll fall to our spot, idk if we'll spend two picks in a row on OL as Kubes and co. Can pick OL out of late rounds. But if we do Tomlinson is a mighty run blocker and I'd love to see CJ run behind him."

If that's the case, I don't see how we don't draft him. A chance for that kid to learn from Von Miller and DeMarcus Ware would be incredibly valuable, not to mention Ray is the best pure pass rusher in the draft. Other than that, I'm a fan of Humphries, Clemmings, and Erving. I think there's a chance Maxx Williams could still be available in the 2nd round, may be a guy we trade up early 2nd round to get. Who knows. I just want to see us solidify the areas that we desperately need depth, and get a playmaker or two."

Somewhat unrealistic, Sexy Maxx Williams, he looks like he has the potential to be an elite TE, like a step under Gronk. Having a Gronk-esque TE on our roster would be fucking awesome, pair him up with DT, Emmanuel, Virgil/Owen, goddamn that'd be a scary receiving corps, and we're already scary there."
DenverBroncos,34234k,crueg,8,Mon Apr 27 21:09:01 2015 UTC,"Randy Gregory. In my opinion the best pass rusher/edge defender in the draft. I seriously hope we consider drafting an edge player early, cause at the end of last year Ware really started to slow down especially in the playoffs. This year we really need to give him some rest early on so he can bring it come playoff time. On top of the fact that I think we probably cut ties with him after the year so we might as well draft his replacement this year."

DenverBroncos,34234k,maytagem,0,Mon Apr 27 19:24:32 2015 UTC,Jameis Winston is a great comparison to Manning. Even if Manning sticks around for just 1 more year and we go into a temporary rebuilding phase for 2 or 3 years it would be sick to replace Manning with Black Manning. I honestly don't think we have a shot at winning the SB this year and if that's the case then it's kind of pointless to shore up our o-line when we should have a serviceable one.

That's not to say I don't agree with trading up, that part is fine, it's just should've taken a guard or a center with that spot (say Cann or Grasu).  I'm not sure I would've traded down in the 3rd since we don't quite need the extra picks, and we could've gotten someone of higher value there, and we probably could've traded our actual 6th instead of the one gained for the 3rd to the Giants for their two 7ths and then flipped that last 7th for the 2016 6th.  Overall, not the worst draft, but IMO a bit disappointing given what our immediate needs are right now which is Oline-Oline-Oline, then FS and BPA from there.     I'd grade B+ for the potential, but I wouldn't be surprised if this class got a C grade in post-season assessments."

Plus we have plenty of depth between Steven Johnson, Corey Nelson, Reggie Walker, Lamin Barrow, etc. We just had some crazy injuries happen last year that left us short staffed.

You've only had a winning record 3 out of the last 8 years. You're not hot shit just because you rented an aging bum of a QB for a few years only to have him choke away your season every year in the playoffs.  Every team goes through ups and downs but at least the Raiders currently have a promising future. Your tired old QB is on his last leg, ready to be put down out back behind the shed.

He even had a few game ending plays for us.   He's gonna be a boss for years to come.

DenverBroncos,33tp70,Beaudasious,15,Sat Apr 25 15:12:46 2015 UTC,"Im going to disagree.  Off the top of my head, here are some top tier WR's that have been a part of teams in a superbowl in the last 10-15 years or so, all of which made a significant impact.  Demaryius Thomas, Moss, Owens, Holt, Rice, Brown, Fitz, Nelson, Harrison, Wayne, Gronk.  DT is a top 5 talent in the NFL at his position.  He is a true difference maker and he produces top 5 numbers while commanding constant double coverage.  He is the only true red zone threat left on the team after the departure of Decker and JT.  Letting DT walk or trading him would be a big mistake.  Almost every year a receiver  goes in the top 5 of the draft and this year there will be 2 in the top 10, just like last year.  In fact, last year 5 WR's were selected in the 1st round and most of them (maybe Beckham) wont reach DT's level."
DenverBroncos,33tp70,jbulkheader,2,Sat Apr 25 15:36:06 2015 UTC,"I agree that WRs make an impact. My point is that they are not worth paying $10M+ per year. Gronk is the only one you listed who in the last 5 years has won a SB and he counted less than $5M against the cap last season.   I believe that the league is changing. Like you said, last year 5 WRs were drafted in the 1st round and made impacts as rookies. This year as many as 13 WRs could go in the first 2 rounds!  DT turned down $13M/year last off season. That means that he wants >10% of the salary cap each year. That is too much."
DenverBroncos,33tp70,jbulkheader,3,Sat Apr 25 15:55:39 2015 UTC,"His cap hit with the franchise tag is roughly 12.8 mil.  A long term deal would surely lower that #.  His contract wont count for 13 mil annualy against the cap on a long term deal.  Every team in the NFL knows that you don't let an elite level receiver walk.  Dez, Julio, Nelson, DT, Brown, Calvin...those guys are going nowhere.  I think you undervalue the position and what these guys provide."
DenverBroncos,33tp70,jbulkheader,7,Sat Apr 25 16:08:47 2015 UTC,The deal he turned down last summer had an anual cap hit of between $13-16M per year.   I think the media's emphasis on fantasy football has overvalued the position but I think that the position will be falling to earth soon. We shall see.   on a side note I love the actual discussion going on here. I dont see that too often!
DenverBroncos,33tp70,jbulkheader,3,Sat Apr 25 16:32:31 2015 UTC,"I really don't see the position losing value like the RB position because WR's have a longer shelf life and the running game is also very dependant on O-line play.  Its easier to plug in a rookie rb and be successful than it is to plug in a rookie wr, because of route running, chemistry with the qb and overall understanding of the offense.  An elite wr in his prime is very valuable.  So lets say Elway lets DT walk.  What do you replace that production with?  You only get so many cheap rookie contracts (some of which bust..even 1st rounders). So now I guess you have the extra space to spend in free agency right?  Well usually the free agent market is overvalued thats why Elway let Pot roast, JT, Franklin, and Moore all walk.  I think there is subsequent reason to think that Elway won't let DT walk based on what he provides.  A downfield threat, a chain mover, good blocker, good teammate.  If Im Elway I pay the man especially since hes been producing at an elite level on a discount for 5 years.  Do we really want to see this guy in a Raiders uni?  I think we better find a NT with a switch to a 3-4, and O-line help in the draft. Also excited to see if they move Roby to FS and how that works.  TLDR: In Elway we trust.  I agree!  Good discussion!"

DenverBroncos,33tp70,hecticlorax,1 point,Sat Apr 25 21:01:32 2015 UTC,"he's a better blocker than he is a receiver and he only counts 5 million against the cap. Moss only counted 6 million against the cap. The argument your buddy is making concerns the amount of money that receivers are getting paid. If you think 15 million + for a WR per year is good for a team then so be it. But the teams with contracts like that, miami, lion, cardinals, do not field competitive teams year in and year out.  If you can sign DT for 10million or less he is well worth it and i dont think anyone would argue with that. At 15+ million (which is what he is asking for, already turned down a 13 million deal from the broncos) he is not worth it."
DenverBroncos,33tp70,jbulkheader,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:20:01 2015 UTC,"Gronks contract escelates.  By the end of it he counts 12 mil/ yr against the cap.  He is a good blocker but hes the best pass catching TE in the league.  DT will get a market value contract thats structured uniquely for Denvers cap situation, and he is worth it.  He is likely the most valuable receiver in the league based on talent and age, right there with Julio.  Miami/Arizona have had other personel issues (QB) and Detroit well..They did pretty well this year (Stafford needs to take the next step)."
DenverBroncos,33tp70,boulderboulderboulde,1 point,Sun Apr 26 16:51:51 2015 UTC,"The last years of all contracts in the NFL get restructured as extensions, and the player and teams never see the money/cap hit. So the 12 million per year you are looking at is kind of fake money in a way.  The contract that the Broncos offered last off season would have placed a 13million+ cap hit each year except 2015. How would the broncos uniquely structure a deal with DT that guaranteed him less than they already offered him last summer, or delays the amount he gets in the first few years? I think that will be a tough sell.  I completely agree that the QB issues played big roles in miami/arizona. Won't that more than likely be the case in denver after peyton retires (when ever that is) if DT is being paid at the top of his position?"

DenverBroncos,33tp70,Hayduke_Abides,8,Sat Apr 25 23:58:41 2015 UTC,"The problem is that there is no position that can carry you to a championship, even QB.    Having a WR like Thomas fundamentally changes the way a defense plays you, because it forces them to commit at least two defenders to that one player most of the time.  That makes it hard for them to avoid one-on-one match-ups that favor you, from sending a safety up in run support, from running DB blitzes, etc.    Its exactly like what Von Miller does for the defense-forces the opponent to account for him or makes them pay.  And sometimes makes them pay anyway."

DenverBroncos,33tp70,axe_murdererer,2,Sat Apr 25 15:56:57 2015 UTC,This sums up my thoughts on the matter too. Without DT our offense changes drastically and the dynamic in which defenses play us.
DenverBroncos,33tp70,Twizzle-dizzle,2,Sat Apr 25 22:21:52 2015 UTC,"I agree with this completely. However, if you agree that no one player can carry you to a championship, that it takes a complete team, then do you conceed that spending 10% of the cap on a single player (especially a non-QB) is too much?"
DenverBroncos,33tp70,crueg,3,Sat Apr 25 16:02:26 2015 UTC,Not at all.  Just because one player can't carry you to a championship doesn't mean all players have an equal impact.    I will concede that there are times a player's market value means we can't keep them despite their impact.
DenverBroncos,33tp70,ThreezusManning,9,Sat Apr 25 16:27:00 2015 UTC,"I agree with you on the point that a WR will never carry a team. But as for being a difference maker, I gotta disagree. Maybe I'm being a one sided bronco fan but there's no way I want to trade him and have him end up facing us in season especially in the division. DT can change the way a defense will run opening up other options inside or for the run. He is a great blocker and is a deep threat. His presence causes defenses to have to mark him up letting others like sanders to break free. On top of that he has great chemistry with the team it seems and a pretty humble guy which I like. Sure others could have the same raw abilities and size but our offense would lose more than gain by trying to put a fresh cheaper face in there. DownTown is going to be here until a championship or major changes"
DenverBroncos,33tp70,BlindManBaldwin,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:37:16 2015 UTC,"I like DT as a person, and all things being equal would prefer for him to stay in Denver. But I think we are looking at the last crop of WRs to get big money and I dont want the Broncos to be one of the teams handcuffed by a stupid signing the way the Titans (CJ2K) and Vikings (AP) were hurt by being the last to sign big RB contracts."
DenverBroncos,33tp70,ScipioAfricanvs,4,Sat Apr 25 15:59:57 2015 UTC,"I think you are right in the thinking that the WR position is changing similar to the way the RB position has changed in the last 5 or so years. I think that's a product of how the game is changing as a whole, I mean college, and even some HS football programs, have started training and working out their players like an NFL staff. So it's no wonder that positions like WR, RB, DB, and even to some degree QB, positions that rely more on personal athletic ability and less on physical strength against another opponent (OL, DL, and LB) are coming out of college ready to make an impact. Does it lessen the value of these position? To a certain degree yes it does, but I think more so it changes the perspective and value of players like Sanders, Welker, and (as we have demonstrated by letting him walk) Decker. Those are the type of guys you can let go without a lot of damage being done to the team as a whole because of the quality of players being drafted and how the FA market will reflect these changes by being flooded with quality guys who wont command a large salary,   but having someone that is easily a top 5, and arguably a top 3 player at the WR position is not something that will come along as often. I would say look at how players like Peterson, McCoy, (even though they both had tough seasons last year) Foster, and Lynch have, in their careers, have been a definitive part of the team.

Neither was Montee Ball. I know there were some injury concerns about Eddie Lacy and hindsight is 20/20 but I was pretty upset when we took Ball and Lacy was still on the board.   So, in the past, we haven't really followed drafting the BPA.

We have no idea where Brock or Ball (or anyone for that matter) fell on the Broncos draft board, and we still don't have a real idea what type of player they may turn out to be. Brock hasn't had any sort of a chance to get real reps so his value is an unknown and Ball still has the potential to be an amazing back in this league.

DenverBroncos,33pz4l,Samcrates,3,Sat Apr 25 15:32:34 2015 UTC,"You don't have to go down that far to not take BPA. Especially when looking at non 'skill' positions, it's hard to rate a DL vs. OL. How do you determine a DL guy is going to be better than the OL guy or vice versa?

DenverBroncos,33pm17,edditorRay,17,Fri Apr 24 14:41:59 2015 UTC,Sshhh you're not causing ridiculous speculation even though the Broncos have said repeatedly they expect a big year from Cody.  They're obviously going to trade their second round pick from last year to Philly because he proved to both teams how good he is during his massive amount of playing time last year.
DenverBroncos,33pm17,Greeney494,5,Fri Apr 24 15:47:23 2015 UTC,here's your answer.   https://twitter.com/CodyLatimer14/status/591658601833492480
DenverBroncos,33pm17,alfshumway,0,Fri Apr 24 20:07:02 2015 UTC,Ew... that's worse news than him going to the Eagles.
DenverBroncos,33pm17,TheClayroo,4,Fri Apr 24 22:16:48 2015 UTC,The Eagles worked him out in 2014 before the draft. Chip really liked him. But they wouldn't send the player with his agent to Philly if they were trading him. Maybe an interview or sponsorship I'm hoping.
DenverBroncos,33pm17,BlindManBaldwin,2,Fri Apr 24 14:33:06 2015 UTC,Probably just for an advertisement deal
DenverBroncos,33pm17,detox101,2,Fri Apr 24 14:52:36 2015 UTC,He's under contract with no playing experience. Just a random trip by an NFL rookie meeting his agent.
DenverBroncos,33pm17,PMeist,2,Fri Apr 24 19:47:18 2015 UTC,The Broncos value Latimer too much to trade him without seeing him on the field. He hasn't hardly played or developed for us and we spent a high pick on him.
DenverBroncos,33pm17,Sirefly,-3,Fri Apr 24 21:31:46 2015 UTC,Cody Latimer for Lane Johnson?
DenverBroncos,33pm17,Abiv23,2,Fri Apr 24 14:20:19 2015 UTC,holy shit would that be an awful deal for the Eagles

DenverBroncos,33q5sy,bigstrat2003,3,Fri Apr 24 16:24:53 2015 UTC,"It's unfortunately pretty difficult to get tickets through the single game sales. The past few years I've seen a lot of our fans say they checked ticketmaster the second single game sales opened, and that the site still said there weren't any two seats available together for the more in demand games- I know that was my experience last year.  And also unfortunately, Packers tickets are most likely going to be super expensive on the resale sites. It's probably the biggest draw on our schedule this year, similar to our game against the 49ers last season with it being a prime time game against a quality opponent we don't get to play often, at a midseason point when the team should be firing on all cylinders, and with a chance to watch Peyton break a record, and IIRC, lower level 49ers tickets were going for at least 300 per ticket on StubHub last season. The higher levels will be cheaper, but still marked up to an outrageous degree. But you never know, some people do get lucky with the single game sales or in finding a good deal through resellers, so I hope something works out for you."
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,milehighthunder,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:07:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah, me too. I'm starting to doubt that it'll be possible (at least not without paying an arm and a leg for resold tickets), but I gotta try."
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,enjoylol,1 point,Fri Apr 24 19:47:33 2015 UTC,I think I heard that Broncos tickets have the third highest prices in the NFL. But could be wrong on that. My words of advice would be to get to looking sooner rather than later. Especially for the Packers game.
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,jonsconspiracy,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:53:59 2015 UTC,"Single game tickets will go on sale sometime late-June or early-July and you can expect them to sell out very quickly. Mile High has sold out every Broncos game for decades. If you miss the single game sale date, then StubHub is probably your best option. Don't buy anything now, those prices are surely inflated. The reseller has months to sell them, so they put crazy high prices hoping some sucker bites. As you get closer to the season and the game, prices will moderate... but you will still have to pay a lot to go."
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,DenverBronco,2,Fri Apr 24 16:54:17 2015 UTC,"Well that's good to know that I wouldn't have to pay quite that outrageous of a cost. When you say ""very quickly"", how quickly are we talking? I plan to be on the ball, but I'm curious if this is one of those deals where tickets sell out in seconds and even if you're right on time for the sale, you can miss out."
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,jonsconspiracy,2,Fri Apr 24 17:04:41 2015 UTC,in 2014 the biggest home game was San Francisco on Sunday night.  I got shut out from any 2 tickets together and I was there the second sales opened.  There were plenty of single seats a few minutes after they went on sale.  I imagine it will go through the same process this year too.
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,shindigg15,1 point,Fri Apr 24 20:00:51 2015 UTC,"I've never done it, but I believe it sells out within hours, if not minutes. Someone else will have to confirm."

DenverBroncos,33q5sy,ScipioAfricanvs,1 point,Sat Apr 25 16:53:17 2015 UTC,"Tickets are so stupid to get I fly to Kansas City, STL last year and even after airfare it's cheaper to go out of state than pay the 3rd party prices from stubhub/seatgeek."
DenverBroncos,33q5sy,cobhc333,1 point,Fri Apr 24 17:01:48 2015 UTC,"you have an okay chance of getting them for under 200. This is one of the most anticipated games of the season. I know i'm preparing to go, i'll take at least 250 for 1 ticket when trying to scalp."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,GotNugs,14,Fri Apr 24 15:20:22 2015 UTC,"I feel like they are hoping scheme will make up for losing some players.    Or the team is doing what virtually every team does every year and planning on young players stepping in and filling the vacated spots. That's kinda the point of the draft and player development. The guys Denver lost were once rookies, after all. The NFL isn't made exclusively of free agent veterans. I honestly do not know why fans (and Ed Salmons, apparently) seem unable to grasp this. This ridiculous fretting and hand wringing happens every damn year."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,mysterious_pube,13,Fri Apr 24 15:32:41 2015 UTC,"Patriots let Darelle Revis go after his 1 year they win a Super Bowl: ""That's just Billichek doing what he does.""   Broncos do the same thing: ""ABANDON FUCKING SHIP, ELWAY'S LOST CONTROL, THE TEAM IS NOTHING WITHOUT PEYTON MANNING, DENVER IS A DUMPSTER COVERED IN GASOLINE WITH A LIT MATCH BEING DANGLED 4 FEET ABOVE IT!!!!"""
DenverBroncos,33pxci,Greeney494,9,Fri Apr 24 15:53:48 2015 UTC,"This could not be any more accurate. Every /r/nfl post that says ""what team is going to be bad next year?"" all the top answers are (almost) always Denver. We still have people on this roster aside Peyton, and we made a huge upgrade at defensive coordinator. Pats lost their 2 starting corners and they're still being worshiped. It's a joke sometimes."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,crueg,1 point,Fri Apr 24 16:02:25 2015 UTC,"What about Wade Phillips coaching makes him a good fit for the Broncos and better than Del Rio? Is it the scheme that he runs, previous success with these types of players?"
DenverBroncos,33pxci,hecticlorax,8,Sun Apr 26 16:25:57 2015 UTC,"To be fair, BB has earned the benefit of the doubt.  Frankly, I'm kind of glad we are going into this season with folks saying we will be bad.  Being the favorite made me uncomfortable."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,Hayduke_Abides,5,Fri Apr 24 17:09:52 2015 UTC,"I know he's earned it. But last year the Broncos lost Moreno, Decker, Rodgers-Cromartie, Woodyard, Ayers, etc. and no one said anything, so I don't get why this year is so drastically different."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,Greeney494,5,Fri Apr 24 17:33:11 2015 UTC,"Because Peyton was hurt down the stretch so people think he is done, and a piss-poor showing in the playoffs.  Also /r nfl is dominated by Pats fans who desperately want Manning to fail so Brady looks better by comparison."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,Hayduke_Abides,5,Fri Apr 24 17:36:33 2015 UTC,"Especially since consistently good teams like the Pats and Packers use mostly homegrown talent, and rarely make splashy FA signings.  I couldn't be happier with the guys we picked up last year, they have been beasts, but building through the draft is the only viable long-term strategy."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,Hayduke_Abides,3,Fri Apr 24 15:53:17 2015 UTC,"He doesn't know what we're doing? Really? I guess Ed doesn't know what he's doing for his job either. Forget that there's still a shitload of talent on this roster, and I guess a new coaching doesn't count as ""rebuilding or reloading"". What a crock."
DenverBroncos,33pxci,crueg,5,Fri Apr 24 16:00:24 2015 UTC,"Ed Salmons has literally no clue what he's talking about. This roster has like 9 or 10 pro-bowlers on it, even after Peyton retires.   DT  Von Miller  TJ Ward  Chris Harris  Ryan Clady  CJ Anderson  Emmanuel Sanders  Aqib Talib  Louis Vasquez  DeMarcus Ware  Our GM knows a thing or two about QB play. I believe the transition will be seamless when Peyton leaves."

DenverBroncos,33pxci,licoriceallsorts,1 point,Sat Apr 25 05:47:51 2015 UTC,They've got one foot in rebuilding and one in reloading. The Manning factor is the biggest thing that precludes it from a rebuild.
DenverBroncos,33pxci,SaltLakeBronco,1 point,Sat Apr 25 15:49:06 2015 UTC,"I don't agree with what that guy is saying. First of all, I don't think we need to rebuild, if your definition of rebuilding is everything must go and start from scratch.  It's hard to see how we're not reloading, given our almost entirely new coaching staff and the almost forgone conclusion that Denver will cut its run/pass split to 50/50 or 60/40, switch the defense to a 3-4, and signed a bevy of cheap, good potential contracts.  This guy is a money  man. He knows we have to save money to pay for Von and Danny and Malik when their contracts pop up."
DenverBroncos,33q0sj,SonicSC,3,Fri Apr 24 15:46:47 2015 UTC,"I don't know if Manny has the outright speed and athleticism required to be a pulling guard, which I believe we will see more of with the ZBS.  Zane Beadles was a really good at pulling over to the the other side(maybe the only thing I really liked about him), we need another lean, quick footed guard to compliment the bigger Louis Vasquez.  I see Manny being best utilized at backup Center/Guard, but he may end up being forced into a starting spot somewhere depending on how the draft plays out."
DenverBroncos,33q0sj,Lynch47,2,Fri Apr 24 17:48:37 2015 UTC,"I would be very willing to bet Manny is the starting center come week 1. The guy has been working with Peyton all 3 years, I don't think he's missed a game at all, so they're very comfortable together and that's not an easy role to just plug someone in and expect them to learn Peyton's audibles right away."
DenverBroncos,33q0sj,sirnubnub,2,Fri Apr 24 18:15:30 2015 UTC,I see him winning the Center spot given that Gino is his competition. He was a decent Center I thought and he was certainly vocal at the LOS.
DenverBroncos,33q0sj,WeDENverBoyz24,2,Fri Apr 24 21:53:58 2015 UTC,"Sadly I don't think he fits ZBS very well, as far as I'm concerned he's a brute force OL guy who'll be you with his strength, what we need is a quicker guy with better footwork. I hope I'm wrong, I like him too."
DenverBroncos,33q0sj,MasonL52,2,Fri Apr 24 23:21:49 2015 UTC,"I think one of the biggest issues for him are his wild snaps that he sends to have at least 2 times a game because he either isn't on the same page as Manning, or he tries to get to his block too quickly and makes a poor snap because of it. And I think because of that, and the fact that he makes bad snaps because he isn't quick on his feet, means he is looking at the wrong side of the roster.   I tend to think Paradis will get the job."
DenverBroncos,33q0sj,CO_Boiler,2,Sat Apr 25 17:58:33 2015 UTC,"Ramirez isn't a good fit for the ZBS, at all.  He played good in 2013, played mostly bad in 2014. I think with his age and the new scheme he won't be anything more than depth."

Lots of Broncos fans have bitched every week about having to play in Foxborough two years straight. When you guys do the same exact thing they mock you for doing the same thing.
DenverBroncos,33mjn8,Fridden,1 point,Fri Apr 24 03:00:26 2015 UTC,I'm sorry you're being downvoted. We play each other every 4 years as a part of the schedule and those home/away match ups are staggered. In 2011 you guys came to Denver and whipped us. So last year's match up was in Foxborough as part of the rotation. What doesn't make sense to a lot of us is the 2 games (2012 & 2013) in between for being 1st in our divisions have both been in Foxborough. I'm not sure why that was but I think it's where the frustration comes from.
DenverBroncos,33mjn8,Sienna_Crush,9,Thu Apr 23 21:25:09 2015 UTC,"The ""1st afcw plays 1st afce"" games rotate home and away every TWO years.  This is because there are three other divisions besides your own so it's impossible to have a ""home away home away"" for every division.

Elway can be an ass sometimes, but he's throwing out some tough love here. He want's DT there working out, he want's him involved and participating. It's just frustrating to watch it happen I guess.

DenverBroncos,33meec,CO_Boiler,2,Thu Apr 23 22:30:25 2015 UTC,Do not piss off Lord Commander Elway
DenverBroncos,33meec,joycamp,-3,Fri Apr 24 06:02:22 2015 UTC,"You guys do realize that DT can't be with the team right? It has nothing to do with not wanting to get hurt, the CBA doesn't allow him to be with the team until he either has a deal done, or signs the franchise tag, and if he signs the tag, they can't get a long term deal done this off season... So Elway isn't pissed at DT, he's pissed at how the CBA works..."
DenverBroncos,33meec,CO_Boiler,3,Fri Apr 24 01:19:09 2015 UTC,That's entirely incorrect. He's pissed at DT for not signing the tag. Signing the tag doesn't hinder DT from signing a long term deal in any way. Remember 5 months ago when CHJ was under contract and signed a new deal? Or when Clady was franchised and worked out a new deal while under the tag? How about when Prater did the exact same thing? Or when Manning reworked his deal while under contract? DT is absolutely allowed to work out a new deal while under the franchise tag
DenverBroncos,33meec,MuzzEmil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:28:11 2015 UTC,"I think you missed the point. If he signed the tag, there would be no leverage, or control for DT, Elway can at a minimum understand that due to him being a business guy. What is frustrating is that he can't be with the team unless a deal is done or he signs. Is he frustrated with DT? Yea probably cuz of the way it works the Broncos get shafted on all sides. But pissed at him I would say is too far.  Edit: Prater and Clady did the same thing as what DT is doing btw, so those don't work for your argument, they actually work against it."

DenverBroncos,33meec,MuzzEmil,1 point,Fri Apr 24 01:19:08 2015 UTC,There is nothing to prevent a long term deal if he signs the tag.
DenverBroncos,33meec,CO_Boiler,0,Fri Apr 24 09:36:36 2015 UTC,"As I said before in another post if it would be read, is that it gives up a lot of leverage on DTs part if he signs it. At that point there is no extra motivation to get a deal done this off season.  Everybody has to look past what is exactly said and look at the reason for not signing it. If I did not make that coast on the first place I apologize, but why else would DT not sign? Now if he could work with the team, while still not signing the tag, he would be here because it would help his value."

Even if a few guys step up we'll still need an answer at one of those spots. I want Cam Erving because he's super versatile, he'd be able to step in at which ever of those positions don't get filled."
DenverBroncos,33lznq,MasonL52,5,Thu Apr 23 16:50:55 2015 UTC,"Well, of course Kubes is talking up the guys already on the roster, I think that's just right off the standard script. I think we do draft OL, because it is our biggest need. I still don't understand how we have a ""high need"" for LB's when we had 2 on IR last year, then a backup get injured too, if anything, a LB would be a depth pick. DT I really don't want to see, honestly. I know we lost Pot Roast, but I think it's Sly's time to step up and be a quality starter. I'd understand if we took a DT with our first pick, but I don't think it's as big as a necessity as every fudging ""analyst"" is making it out to be, ""BRONCOS LOST KNGHTON, THEY NEED A NEW DT"", I just don't think that's the case in the 1st round."
DenverBroncos,33lznq,crueg,0,Thu Apr 23 16:50:54 2015 UTC,"Every analyst I've seen has given the Broncos Cam Erving, DJ Humphries, or TJ Clemmings in the first. I haven't heard anyone say anything about replacing Pot Roast, at least in the first."

DenverBroncos,33lznq,Lough5280,2,Thu Apr 23 17:15:50 2015 UTC,"Actually I think our first pick will be somewhat unpredictable. Elway has a history of BPA (see Sly Williams and Bradley Roby), even when those positions weren't of great need for us. Wouldn't it be crazy if someone like Todd Gurley slipped to us and Elway snatched him up?"
DenverBroncos,33lznq,waspocracy,2,Thu Apr 23 19:16:49 2015 UTC,"I could see him doing a surprise pick, but a running back? Not a chance. We have plenty of RBs"
DenverBroncos,33lznq,goateguy,2,Thu Apr 23 22:11:49 2015 UTC,"Everyone is talking about holes (including this subreddit) and what not in the OL or LB positions. Elway has stated repeatedly that they take the best available player regardless of position. It makes sense. Where they are in the draft, they may or may not have the players they want when they're available. I think we have a strong team as it is, so it makes perfect sense to grab the best player available when our number is up.  These analysts just keep talking because it's their job."
DenverBroncos,33lznq,MasonL52,3,Thu Apr 23 21:29:59 2015 UTC,"Personally I think we should go LB with the first round pick, especially if OL is as deep as some are claiming. Maybe Kubiak can pull a Shannahan and make Pro Bowl OL out of 6th round picks."
DenverBroncos,33lznq,Greeney494,7,Thu Apr 23 16:41:25 2015 UTC,"I don't believe we need a 1st round LB. We have our two starting LBs already, if we're going to use a 1st round pick on something I would prefer them to be able to contribute immediately."

DenverBroncos,33lznq,von_bot,4,Thu Apr 23 16:54:38 2015 UTC,"We need depth behind both Von and Ware.  Good 3-4 teams have a LOT of depth at both spots at LB.  Baltimore last year had really good depth at OLB with Suggs, Doom, McPhee, and Upshaw, and the 49ers had crazy depth at ILB with Bowman, Willis, Borland, Skov"
DenverBroncos,33lznq,Greeney494,5,Thu Apr 23 18:31:39 2015 UTC,It's Miller time!
DenverBroncos,33lznq,CO_Boiler,3,Thu Apr 23 18:31:43 2015 UTC,But you don't draft depth in the first round of the draft. 1st rounders are normally expected to be playing or starting year one. A late round linebacker like Marshall and Trevathan can be molded into starters eventually.
DenverBroncos,33lznq,MasonL52,1 point,Thu Apr 23 18:34:42 2015 UTC,"We've got depth behind every one of our guys... We have McCray, Smith, Barrett, Anunike (depending on how you classify him), Davis, Johnson, Nelson, Barrow, and Walker as depth. And those are the guys I can just rattle off the top of my head. And if you want proof that we have quality rushing depth behind Von and Ware I'll go back and dig up a post where I found their pressure percentage and sack percentage, and we have 1 guy above league average, and another just a touch, and I mean a touch like you have to go to tenths of a percent, below league average.  Will we take a LB at some point? Yes, but only because they are the BPA, not because of need."
DenverBroncos,33lznq,WeDENverBoyz24,0,Thu Apr 23 19:10:08 2015 UTC,"We have our two starting LB's already, but one of them has a glass knee and both of them missed time last year. The Broncos need depth, for one, and Elway and Kubiak won't settle for ""good enough,"" so if, say, Kendericks is available, Elway won't hesitate to make Trevathan or Marshall the depth in favor of Kendericks, if he sees fit.  I am really starting to think that the Broncos are going to go pure BPA in the 1st round and they'll find steals in the 2nd and 3rd rounds at OL. Grasu, Dismukes, Sambrailo, Jackson, and so many others will be available later on, and if anyone can get later round OL to excel, it's Kubiak and Dennison."
DenverBroncos,33lznq,tjn23,1 point,Thu Apr 23 16:57:48 2015 UTC,Trev/Bmarsh won't become depth. While I agree we need depth at LB I wouldnt be willing to spend a 1st on depth with as much of a need at OL that we have.

I checked left, then right, and the left again and there were no cars. I start to pull out and I hear someone honking. I see this lady flying around the corner (on my right), at least 15 mph above the speed limit. I stop my car in the middle of the road to avoid getting hit and she slows down and starts yelling at me. My car has good sound barriers so I don't hear anything, but I'm just thinking to my self, ""well maybe you shouldn't be flying around blind corners like a fucking moron.""  I was behind her for a short while and she almost nailed two people crossing the street because she was still flying. The speed limit is 35 and she had to be at least going 50.   End of story. Glad you're okay."
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,tjn23,5,Thu Apr 23 18:42:52 2015 UTC,"petty is not worth a second  In fact, no QB this year is worth a second, maybe Hundley"
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,CO_Boiler,6,Fri Apr 24 00:44:26 2015 UTC,"Well for one I legitimately like Grayson much better than Petty, and I'm not a CSU homer, the school has in fact pissed me off lately. But I also am not sure about second round. It really depends at that point who is available, because while it may be nice to grab someone it is not a need by any means seeing that we have 3 QBs already, and this is a weak draft for QBs. If there is nobody in the second that is more valuable, then ok, but I would not go into the draft saying that ""if Grayson/Petty are there in the 2nd we are taking them""."
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,SuburbanHell,2,Thu Apr 23 18:57:55 2015 UTC,Honestly I think that's too early for us to be looking unless we really have no faith in Brock.  It will be telling for sure if they do look for a QB before say.. the 4th.
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,Hayduke_Abides,3,Fri Apr 24 01:15:20 2015 UTC,Agreed.  I feel like the whole Grayson thing is a smokescreen.  We'll see.
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,Greeney494,2,Fri Apr 24 19:40:01 2015 UTC,"We don't need a QB, and any pick before the seventh is a solid waste.  Manning is coming back this year.  The team has turned down trade offers for Brock, so I'm guessing they at least want to see him under center for a full year, maybe more.  This years quarterback crop really is not that good in terms of starting QB caliber guys.  So I don't see the Broncos drafting another QB of the future by wasting a second round pick in a bad QB year to have him wait 3 years to start.  But then again, I'm not in Dove Valley, so really who the hell knows."
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,Sienna_Crush,2,Fri Apr 24 02:11:03 2015 UTC,My first notion to drafting a QB this has been NO but after thinking about it I've been becoming more open to it. If management sees something in one of the QBs in the mid-rounds they like I'm okay with taking them. My thought is having multiple guys being groomed for the post-Manning era at the same time could be very beneficial. Essentially having options with someone familiar with the league and offense to try out in case Brock doesn't work would be smart.
DenverBroncos,33mgp7,licoriceallsorts,2,Fri Apr 24 03:24:07 2015 UTC,Well you'd take Grayson before Petty first of all

DenverBroncos,33few2,quadricoulus,2,Thu Apr 23 00:09:05 2015 UTC,I agree but they still have a good defense.

DenverBroncos,33few2,caesarfecit,3,Wed Apr 22 06:42:32 2015 UTC,"The Pats should be significantly weakened this season, especially on defense. That and the Oline does have deficiencies that were masked a lot last year. The Pats are still a 11-13 win team based on their horrible division that they seem to roll over easily every single year. Plus playing the NFC East should be pretty easy. They will be a playoff team but I don't expect them to be nearly as good next year."
DenverBroncos,33few2,PMeist,2,Wed Apr 22 08:17:26 2015 UTC,I think the Jets or Bills could give us an upset win over the Pats late in the season that secures our position ahead of them. But then there's the Colts...
DenverBroncos,33few2,baha24,5,Wed Apr 22 19:14:44 2015 UTC,The Colts have a cupcake schedule as well. I think we'll need to beat them at home or they'll have the number 1 seed.

It would stir up so much controversy and the off season would be heavily watched. For the following month everyone would ask will Peyton retire? Will he stay? should he come back for one more? Peyton retires, a month later he's thinking about coming back for one more year. To me I would love to see it but IF it happened it would be too coincidental for everyone to believe. IMHO though"

DenverBroncos,33h7db,rckymtnclmbr,2,Wed Apr 22 17:04:16 2015 UTC,"Single game tickets go on sale through Ticketmaster in July (if I remember right, you should double check that, might be late June). Any tickets not owned by season ticket holders go up for sale that day. Ticketmaster would be the only place to get these. That is, until they are all bought up, which will happen. The Broncos sell out every home game.   Once the single game tickets are sold out NFL ticket exchange (run by ticketmaster...ugh) allows you to buy directly from season ticket holders. It doesn't necessarily save you money, since season ticket holders can jack up prices for the tickets if they want. But at least you know its legit. I know you can use stubhub or seatgeek as well.   The Broncos do also put a select # of 1/2 price (nose bleed seat) tickets for sale for home games. They used to be somewhat easy to get if you hopped on it right away, but that was pre-Manning. I am not sure how/if you can get your hands on them now. But its worth a shot. Just keep an eye out for the date that single game tickets go on sale and log on first thing. There are only 2,000 of these per home game though.  Edit...Random question, but do you also post on the 14ers.com forum?"
DenverBroncos,33h7db,rckymtnclmbr,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:05:38 2015 UTC,"Thanks for the info. Any advantage to showing up in person to buy tickets as opposed to getting them online.

DenverBroncos,33h7db,I_Messed_With_Texas,1 point,Wed Apr 22 19:29:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, Ticketmaster blows the big one. When we sell our season tickets through ticket exchange they take a good chunk of of whatever we sell them for.  They also make a profit with their service fees when it comes to the person buying their tickets. So double profits for them every time a ticket gets sold.   I am on the 14ers forum fairly often as well, posting under metalmountain. If you end up with tickets to a game hit me up. There is a good chance I will be there. We can drink some beers and discuss mountain climbing and the Broncos."

DenverBroncos,33h7db,Bilyman,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:03:48 2015 UTC,"Buying when single season tickets are on sale is kind of a crap shoot, and everything but singles -- in my experience -- sells out in under 5-minutes (since Peyton). Fortunately, the Vikings are a relatively low-end team and there may not be as much demand. When you go to ""search"" for tickets on Ticketmaster.com, it will ask you to choose a price category; unfortunately you can't do $100 and under but there is a category in that range. The problem there is it will be very tough to get more than two tickets together searching one price category... You probably won't get four together anyhow, but your chances go up if you select ""best available."" The issue with this is you could very well end up paying more than you want to (club seats are $350+).  Finally, you can select available seats from the stadium chart, but as you can imagine, it's not likely that they'll be available by the time the chart loads, you pick your seats and go to check out."
DenverBroncos,33gxre,looktheresafox,4,Wed Apr 22 13:05:42 2015 UTC,"If possible, since I don't use StubHub, check to see if the user us selling for multiple locations in the same game. If so, scam. If not, and they're selling the same ticket location for multiple games, then it's probably a season ticket holder who knows their schedule, so they're putting them up before they've received their physical tickets."
DenverBroncos,33gxre,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Wed Apr 22 14:40:28 2015 UTC,"Yeah. My thoughts exactly. The legit tickets are going to be the season ticket holders knowing they can't make certain games, etc. The other thing is there's some companies, individuals, etc. that will buy season tickets specifically to sell them online."
DenverBroncos,33gxre,orthodoxrebel,1 point,Wed Apr 22 21:53:11 2015 UTC,"And those guys I honestly don't trust, because if those games get big and important, they can cancel your purchase and put them back up at inflated costs."
DenverBroncos,33gxre,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Wed Apr 22 22:10:37 2015 UTC,"Yeah, if legit, I do not see how it could be anything other than a season ticket holder doing a pre-sale. If you can search their listings, see if they have tickets for other games, the seats should match."
DenverBroncos,33gxre,ljp3,1 point,Wed Apr 22 16:27:23 2015 UTC,"Single game tickets don't go on sale until July (Crap, my memory is failing. Its around then though). Season tickets holders (me being one, so I somewhat know what I am talking about) don't get our tickets to the games until around that time either. So no season ticket holder actually has physical possession of any tickets yet. I would be wary of purchasing anything this far in advance."
DenverBroncos,33gxre,rckymtnclmbr,2,Wed Apr 22 19:01:30 2015 UTC,"To follow up on this, OP see if the listing give you a time when the tickets will be available.

DenverBroncos,33ezlv,TDenverFan,22,Tue Apr 21 23:57:24 2015 UTC,"All in all, I think the schedule worked out great for us this year, especially compared to last season. No early bye, only three away games in the second half of the season instead of being backloaded in that area, no three game roadtrip anywhere in the schedule, not getting the extra short turn around period by playing in prime time before our Thursday game. Man, last year's schedule really sucked.  I think getting the Thursday game out of the way as soon as possible will be beneficial, the team will be as close to 100% as possible for the short week. One of our two back to back away stretches consists of the two worst teams on our schedule. We get to spend the bye week preparing for the Packers. Have an early game the week before the Pats. Get to open and close at home. The more I look it over, the more I really, really like how this played out for us."
DenverBroncos,33ezlv,milehighthunder,4,Wed Apr 22 00:08:59 2015 UTC,"Seriously, I don't think this schedule could get any better (especially after the bye)"
DenverBroncos,33ezlv,Bilyman,2,Wed Apr 22 00:26:20 2015 UTC,"I can't think of many ways this could've been a better schedule.  We face teams at their respective worst performance points in the season (Brady before December, Ravens early, Bengals late...although that didn't work out great last time), and no incredibly hard road games."

DenverBroncos,33ezlv,skullyD,6,Wed Apr 22 00:03:57 2015 UTC,"Funny, we're also coming off a bye.   I'm so ridiculously, unbelievably stoked for this game. If everything goes according to plan, it'll be the first Packers game I've ever seen in person. And it's Rodgers vs. Peyton. fuck yes"

Getting rid of most of the gimme games before the bye is going to be the best thing to happen to the team this season. I'm so excited.

DenverBroncos,33elgt,ilovehdgamez,1 point,Wed Apr 22 05:48:17 2015 UTC,It worked quite well for Seattle and new England. I remember it worked well for Arizona early in the ggame as well. I can't find all the stats but i remember both of Manning's ints happening in the 1st half and our defense kept us in the game. You beat manning with pressure and messing up his delicate timing with his WRs. It just works better for the Seahawks and pats because they had the corners to shut down demaryius.

DenverBroncos,33fl14,Bilyman,6,Wed Apr 22 17:11:33 2015 UTC,"I think ""easily seeing"" and ""easily going"" are two different things. I can easily see the team playing their hearts out and getting some luck and winning some squeakers to reach, in a very difficult way, 16-0."
DenverBroncos,33fl14,wefr5927,1 point,Wed Apr 22 13:47:15 2015 UTC,I sure hope so because lord knows we didn't play our hearts out vs the Colts. I don't think Kubiak will stand for that shit though.
DenverBroncos,33fl14,Bilyman,4,Wed Apr 22 14:20:21 2015 UTC,"Later on there's an article on a game by game analysis, and it has the Broncos going 13-3, with losses against Indy, Pittsburgh, and San Diego. They have us losing against San Diego because the Broncos will have already clinched a bye and will be playing their second stringers. However, I think the only starter who will not play is Manning (who knows, he's stubborn as hell) and I think we will still win. Therefore, if we do manage to beat the Colts and the Steelers, I think we can go 16-0."
DenverBroncos,33fl14,travelagent007,2,Wed Apr 22 03:46:25 2015 UTC,Lol I like the confidence but we aren't going 16-0. I have us 12-4

DenverBroncos,33fl14,broncopower1,0,Wed Apr 22 14:04:05 2015 UTC,I want to think Manning will understand that he needs to go for the long haul and not burn out like he did last year. I mean you'd want to think that right?
DenverBroncos,33fl14,epgenius,5,Wed Apr 22 19:13:15 2015 UTC,Something worth noting... Many of these teams will be worse than these predictions. I added up the total wins and losses and combined the NFL would go 281-231 overall. So that doesn't add up.   I think we have a very good shot at 13-3. We've been fairly consistent over the past few seasons and as long as we don't have any trouble with the management shift we should be able to continue this trend.
DenverBroncos,33fl14,AdaAstra,4,Wed Apr 22 16:42:23 2015 UTC,"I think the packers, colts, steelers and pats will be the ones we have a true struggle with. Obviously it depends on if we show, but i'm feeling realistic at 11-5 or maybe 12-4. Any given sunday..."
DenverBroncos,33fl14,CaptClutch72,3,Wed Apr 22 06:29:17 2015 UTC,"Yea. 13-3 seems pretty good for us.  Like most people are saying. Packers, Pats, and Colts seem like our only threat but, i think it will matter a lot on how we open our season playing the ravens at home. If we can play a great game and win against their quick defense I feel like we can easily win most of our games this season. Our D took a hit losing Pot Roast and losing Orange Julius isnt good either but I can't shake this good feeling I have about everyone stepping up their game.  EDIT: I DEFINITELY want to see more of Brock Osweiler!  Here's to a great season!"

DenverBroncos,33erh9,Jens1893,2,Wed Apr 22 00:18:24 2015 UTC,Another Monday Night game against the Bengals? That is such a boring matchup. ESPN must not get very high priority when choosing their games.
DenverBroncos,33erh9,trevor28,2,Wed Apr 22 00:19:30 2015 UTC,"You're on the right track. ESPN gets to pick from games that Fox and CBS haven't protected for themselves. Look at MNF on a weekly basis, it's almost never the best matchup of the week. Combine that with ESPN's need to appeal to a national audience and MNF's appeal simply isn't what it once was. As for Denver/Cincinnati week 16, it could very well be Manning's last season, which gives ESPN a storyline, that Manning gets the last MNF of the season."

Where would you recommend purchasing tickets? Any time frame you'd recommend that I start shopping around for the best deals? I'm cheap and don't care where I sit/stand.
DenverBroncos,33f6a4,designated_shitter,3,Wed Apr 22 14:05:25 2015 UTC,"Nosebleeds can get as low as into the $60-ish range.  Not a bad seat, actually.  Do/see/go:  I recommend getting a hotel downtown, and walking from Pepsi Center to the stadium (about 15 mins, assuming average fitness—if you're obese or elderly, probably opt for a cab).  Alternatively, you can get a decent hotel anywhere along the light rail line, and get off at the station nearest the stadium.  If you do that, I recommend getting a hotel in Glendale, near the University of Denver, or in the Denver Tech Center.  Restaurants depend totally on what you're up for:  there's good Mexican and Ethiopian in town.  Indian is honestly so-so.  Korean and Vietnamese are good.  If you want top end, go to Capitol Grile.  If you want an ""experience"", do the Buckhorn Exchange.  If you want comfort food that's a ""slice of Denver"", go to one of the many brew pubs and/or Sam's/Pete's Kitchen (the latter two are local diner style places that are good).   What to do:  that depends a lot on whether you like sights, recreation, or cultural sites, and how far you're willing to travel.    PM or comment for more details about any of this, which I'm happy to provide.  :)  Have fun!"

DenverBroncos,33f5w5,caileangrey,3,Wed Apr 22 03:28:19 2015 UTC,"I see a lot of losses to Indianapolis, but how many of you are actually concerned about the Colts? I know so many people are lauding them, but let's take a step back. They've added Frank Gore and Andre Johnson, an RB who will be 32 and a WR who will be 34. Neither one of them were very productive last year, and Belichick handed us all the blueprint to stop Luck in the AFCCG last year. I don't understand all the hype surrounding Indy this year, especially with their unimproved defense."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,crueg,1 point,Wed Apr 22 04:36:00 2015 UTC,"We should be concerned about every team each week. No victory is guaranteed, and when you head into a game thinking you're guaranteed a win, then you end up with games like @st Louis or divisional vs indy."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,baha24,2,Wed Apr 22 18:38:53 2015 UTC,"I think we have a lot to be excited about this year, and I think we should have no problem winning the division, especially because none of the other three teams did enough in the off-season to convince me otherwise.  Having said that, I think 12-4 is realistic, maybe 13-3. It's just hard to tell, given how much some of our opponents have undergone such drastic changes over the last couple of months - e.g. Indy (adding Johnson and Gore and getting Mathis back), NE (losing Revis, Wilfork, Browner, Ayers, Vereen and Ridley), and Detroit (losing Suh and Fairley). I think we're going to have a pretty solid roster; it just depends on the quality of our opponents.  Anyway, after droning on, my initial prediction is we go 12-4, win the AFCW, and take the 2nd seed (behind Indy). Our losses are @KC, @Pit, @Indy, and vs. GB (although maybe I'm giving Indy too much credit -- I'll leave that open to debate).  Honestly, though, come back after the draft/maybe even after pre-season, and people might have a better idea."

DenverBroncos,33f5w5,milehighthunder,2,Thu Apr 23 00:39:37 2015 UTC,"Honestly, I'm thinking 14-2, with the losses being @Colts and @Steelers. I believe we go undefeated at home again. We have some tough match-ups there, no doubt, but in the last three years, we've only lost two regular season games at home, both of them by one score. That's just as good as Seattle's home record in that time IIRC- our home field advantage is no joke. Plus, the two hardest games at home are the Packers and Pats, right? Well we catch some nice breaks for those two: we have a bye before the Packers, and an early Sunday game before the Pats while they'll be coming off of a Monday night game, basically giving us an extra day of rest and prep.  Nothing about the last three seasons makes me feel inclined to predict a road loss against our division rivals. Of course I'm not saying it's impossible, but even though they're new teams to our coaching staff right now, Peyton is still very familiar with them all, and we still have a ton of other players who have at least 1 season of experience against them, so I'm not calling for a loss until I actually see one happen. We should beat the Browns and Bears. Lions are tougher, but we get an extra three days to prepare for them thanks to coming off of a Thursday game the week before, so I think that'll help push us to a W. Leaves the aforementioned Colts and Steelers games. Colts have just been a rough match-up for us the last couple of years and I could see us playing a little worn down after what I'm guessing will be a tough game against the Packers, and Ben/Bell/Brown are a formidable trio to play in their house late in the year.  We play a lot of good teams, can't deny that, and I can imagine a lot of ways our record could end up being 12-4 or 13-3, but for now I'm really leaning towards this 14-2 scenario."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,BlindManBaldwin,2,Wed Apr 22 01:53:42 2015 UTC,"Just remember though, the Steelers play @ Seattle, VS Colts, then VS Bengals in the 3 weeks before us."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,baha24,0,Wed Apr 22 02:20:33 2015 UTC,"I don't see it. Way too many tough games to come out under 3 losses.  The biggest threats IMO are as follows:  The Pats are worse this year(on paper) and we play them at home, I think we got that one, but it's the Pats.  Packers game is a huge toss up, coin flip  The Chiefs are so hit or miss. If they hit while we are playing them on the road shit gets tough. Never count Arrowhead as a free win.  A healthy Chargers team is no joke, and they have a solid history of winning in Denver(they won in 2012/13 season). Sweeping them is never a sure bet.  Colt's are my AFC #1 seed pick for this year, our most likely loss here.  If we come out of these 7 games with only 2 losses I'll be happy."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,mbear818,1 point,Wed Apr 22 03:19:26 2015 UTC,"Ravens- W  @Chiefs- L  @Lions- W  Vikings- W  @Raiders- W  @Browns- W  Packers- W  @Colts- L  Chiefs- W  @Bears- W  Patriots- W  @Chargers- W  Raiders- W  @Steelers- L  Bengals- W  Chargers- W  Now here is the why  I think we lose to @Chiefs as KC is always a tough game and it is early and all the kinks may not be worked out. I think @Colts it is just Lucas Oil will be too much for us to overcome. I also think @Steelers because of their high-flying offense and it being a road game.  I could see all of these going differently, however I could also see some other games (@Lions, Packers, Patriots @Chargers, Bengals) going differently as well, depending on injuries and coaching."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,milehighthunder,1 point,Wed Apr 22 01:34:08 2015 UTC,depending on injuries and coaching.   That's what makes predicting schedules so difficult.
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,SuburbanHell,1 point,Wed Apr 22 02:49:54 2015 UTC,"Looking at this thread, I see that literally everyone has the Ravens marked as a W and no one mentions the game. What's the deal there exactly, if you don't mind me asking? Just curious, no ill will."
DenverBroncos,33f5w5,DJKest,1 point,Wed Apr 22 20:30:40 2015 UTC,"The fact that it's a home game for us is probably the biggest factor- like I said in my predictions post, only two home losses in three seasons, so predicting a loss for us here is big. Also, Peyton led teams tend to come out of the gate strong in the first week; in his last ten season openers, his teams have won seven, and only one of those three losses was at home. I probably would have picked a season opener at home as a W for us no matter who the opponent was. I'm not an expert on the Ravens roster, so I'm not sure how accurate this is, but I get the impression that you guys are looking thin at WR and in the secondary coming into this season, but that's really the only knock I have against your team specifically in looking at that match-up."
DenverBroncos,33fx5j,Royusmaximus,6,Wed Apr 22 04:52:48 2015 UTC,"Non-divisional opponents who are relatively close in distance.   Just my guess, I'm not really for sure on it."

DenverBroncos,33dwhc,Manfrenjensenjen,11,Tue Apr 21 19:11:57 2015 UTC,Am I the only one who doesn't care for the flat bill?  It makes me think of Donald Duck for some reason.
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,TerpMB,7,Tue Apr 21 19:49:42 2015 UTC,I hate flat bills. I have a buddy who has a fancy bill curving tool thing that makes his flat bill hats curve well like a baseball cap should be.
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,Juan_El_Way,5,Tue Apr 21 19:55:42 2015 UTC,The fashion trend will come back around. Until then I guess those of us who stick to curved bills can consider ourselves hipsters.
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,irishsandman,3,Tue Apr 21 20:17:17 2015 UTC,You mean a rubber-band? In all seriousness I find that the flat bill design fits my head better. Curved bills tend to lead to headaches for me. I'm more disappointed that this one isn't orange than anything.
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,Hugo_Hackenbush,2,Tue Apr 21 20:25:00 2015 UTC,"No, my friend's tool thingy shapes the bill better than a rubber band would. I curl my hats up several times a day with my hands just to readjust the bill."
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,biglineman,3,Tue Apr 21 20:30:08 2015 UTC,"I have a wide face with high cheekbones. I only prefer flat bills because the curved bills make the part of my face below my eyes look HUGE. I'll wear curved bills, but I do prefer flat."

DenverBroncos,33dwhc,peaceblaster68,3,Tue Apr 21 19:34:50 2015 UTC,"If I wore hats, I would wear this one. Mainly because of under the brim though. Even though other people couldn't see it haha."
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,Juan_El_Way,2,Tue Apr 21 20:53:50 2015 UTC,"So our once-a-year special-time jerseys are our late 90's Navy Blue that we hardly ever use, and that's the featured color on the hat? Huh"
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,j_like,5,Tue Apr 21 19:45:12 2015 UTC,It's the featured color on the hat because of the Gold anniversary of the NFL. Gold and orange don't look great together. So they went blue for the whole hat just for the sake of the gold shield looking not awful.
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,Royusmaximus,5,Tue Apr 21 19:47:31 2015 UTC,Yeah the gold and orange would have been pretty heinous
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,Royusmaximus,2,Tue Apr 21 19:59:48 2015 UTC,I think hats with art under the bill look dumb
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,march20rulez,2,Tue Apr 21 20:28:26 2015 UTC,"Generally I do too, but these are kinda neat since they're the Denver skyline."
DenverBroncos,33dwhc,march20rulez,2,Tue Apr 21 20:30:42 2015 UTC,"I totally understand why most people don't like the hat. As I've stated in more detail in another comment, flat bills just look better on me. I also love the skyline under the bill. I really like the hat. It's the best draft hat they've put out in the past few years. I bought one this morning when I saw they were for sale."

DenverBroncos,33dsi7,XboxChunkyTaco,5,Tue Apr 21 21:26:11 2015 UTC,My biggest question is where is the bye week going to be?  Last year having the bye in week 4 hurt us.  No week off late in the season to rest up and heal the little things.
DenverBroncos,33dsi7,DrOddcat,2,Tue Apr 21 18:55:29 2015 UTC,"Of course, and that's always the question.  I'm just hoping we don't get boned with another early bye in back to back years."
DenverBroncos,33dsi7,taotechill,7,Tue Apr 21 19:08:21 2015 UTC,I heard a rumor that the NFL is going to have us start the season with a BYE to ignite the rivalry between the Broncos and having a week off.
DenverBroncos,33dsi7,taotechill,2,Tue Apr 21 19:15:47 2015 UTC,I'll take a crack at the schedule-   GB vs DEN (SNF) OAK vs DEN DEN @ PIT DEN @ IND SD vs DEN (TNF) DEN @ CLE  DEN @ CHI (MNF) MIN vs DEN BYE DEN @ KC CIN vs DEN DEN @ DET (Thanksgiving) DEN @ SD NE vs DEN (SNF) BAL vs DEN DEN @ OAK KC vs DEN

DenverBroncos,33dsi7,UberXLBK,2,Tue Apr 21 19:30:07 2015 UTC,"I don't think DEN at CHI is a compelling enough match up, even with the firing of Fox and company that the NFL and networks would want it as a MNF game.  I think DEN at IND instead, a SNF swap with either the GB or NE games, or only 4 prime-time games would be more likely."
DenverBroncos,33dsi7,Jens1893,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:00:39 2015 UTC,"I don't think you're wrong, but we must consider that CBS and FOX have rights to a certain number of games per season.  CBS has saved DEN/NE quite often over the years and I imagine they may try to save DEN/IND this year too.  It's not often that the MNF game is the best matchup of the week, and I imagine games like GB, NE and Indy could very well be protected from NBC and ESPN."

DenverBroncos,33atmm,ThreezusManning,5,Tue Apr 21 01:48:41 2015 UTC,"Phillips. Peyton would pretty much have to play prevent defense like on a Hail Mary play just so that way he doesn't give up a long touchdown. And even then, he'd still probably get beat 9/10 times."

DenverBroncos,33atmm,thegreatbellyflop55,13,Tue Apr 21 03:21:37 2015 UTC,Would you rather 5 more years of terrell Davis at the end of his career or Peyton arriving in denver 5 years earlier?
DenverBroncos,33atmm,not_horatiocaine,5,Tue Apr 21 02:49:51 2015 UTC,Terrell. 5 more years of a healthy TD probably gets him a HoF spot.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,IAMHab,2,Tue Apr 21 04:25:43 2015 UTC,He should be in the HoF as is.  Looking back at what he accomplished in such a short time is pretty crazy.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,Puffy_Ghost,4,Tue Apr 21 16:31:53 2015 UTC,Oh jesus that's a good one.  Depends on the coach I guess. Davis if it was Kubiak or Shanahan. Peyton for any other.  Edit: Spelling.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,DrOddcat,3,Tue Apr 21 03:13:12 2015 UTC,Ahhhh....this one hurts to think about.  I'm gonna go with TD for 5 more years.  Back then a dominant RB could carry a mediocre QB to a wild card or division title.  But 5 years too early Manning the front office wasn't ready to build a winner and McDaniels would have found a way to kill it/Manning.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,neonbible47,5,Tue Apr 21 03:14:30 2015 UTC,You're right... McDaniels seals it. He probably would have literally tried to kill Manning.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,aljds,5,Tue Apr 21 04:18:12 2015 UTC,"Manning arrived March of 2012.  5 years earlier would have been March 2007.  Shanahan was fired/McD was hired January of 2009.  Not only do we get 5 more years of manning, but we never have to deal with McD.    That said, 5 more years of TD means he plays through 2006.  Assuming he plays at a high level (if not, than Manning is clearly the better call), he might have been able to put the Broncos over the top in 2005.  He would have been 33 in 2005 though, which is old, and it's not like the run game was lacking from 2002-2006.  Tough call for sure.     Also, I feel that we had some bad QBs from 2007 to 2011, and Manning would have been a BIG step up over them.  We had some pretty good RBs from 2002-2007, and TD would have been less of a step up."
DenverBroncos,33atmm,Colorado222,2,Tue Apr 21 04:53:21 2015 UTC,Would we have ever gotten Champ though? I doubt it.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,not_horatiocaine,1 point,Tue Apr 21 18:19:15 2015 UTC,"This is a great answer! Peyton= no McSuck. We also had Clinton Portis during the years TD would have been here, so TD wouldn't have been a huge step up."

DenverBroncos,33atmm,GotRiskyNewAccount,3,Tue Apr 21 09:07:49 2015 UTC,Raiders because otherwise we would lose one of the AFC West teams.
DenverBroncos,33atmm,DrOddcat,3,Tue Apr 21 16:09:43 2015 UTC,"About time I answered my own question.  I would like the Raiders to return to relevance.  The Seahawks look good, but may not sustain it and honestly once they go through a downswing I can't see the emotions and hatred of Broncos fans towards them staying up.  However, the Raiders are a different story.  I can always hate them, and so can all other Broncos fans.  In recent years we have gotten cocky and swaggy about the Raiders.  It just loses its fun when your rival is a perennial door-mat.  Rivalries are so much more fun when both teams have something bigger to gain/lose as a result of these games.  I hate the Seahawks right now, but I love to hate the Raiders.  That's why I want to see them relevant again."

I’m sure you love money, I’m sure you love the attention, but you must not love having friends on the team, because he has none.  That is Denver fans.

This is my first attempt at posting on this sub, but I have had writing experience in the past for analysis like this ahah.    That's the thing - I absolutely love Kendricks.  We definitely need more ILB talent, but our need for an OL is better.  I'm hoping that our third-rounder from last year, Schofield, can pan out into a Bryan Bulaga-type, or that all the good 1st-round value OL are gone so that we can make this pick for the good value and look to the 2nd and 3rd round for OL."

DenverBroncos,338yzz,Greeney494,4,Mon Apr 20 19:56:07 2015 UTC,A reminder of what Tebow can do  We can play this game all day long and go both ways.
DenverBroncos,338yzz,flynryan692,7,Mon Apr 20 20:48:16 2015 UTC,"Yeah, that was an impressive 80-yard run by Tim."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,indyxetan,5,Mon Apr 20 21:09:24 2015 UTC,I'll win. He threw a lot more bad passes than good passes.
DenverBroncos,338yzz,Greeney494,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:03:00 2015 UTC,"So did John Elway. Using your logic, John Elway is a bad quarterback. We all know Tebow isn't the greatest QB, I don't know why you have to sit here and hate on him for going after his dream."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,flynryan692,3,Tue Apr 21 00:09:31 2015 UTC,"No one doubted Elway's talent. He's still the number 1 college prospect ever graded for a lot of NFL scouts. Elway was never 'if' but 'when'. Tebow has always been 'if'. Still is. I don't hate Tim Tebow, he's an amazing human being, and a fantastic talent for ESPN, but he ain't no quarterback. The NFL agreed. That's why he hasn't played for two years."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,Greeney494,0,Tue Apr 21 00:19:29 2015 UTC,"Why do Tebow supporters always think people who don't like him as a player have some sort of vendetta against him as a person? Tebow played horribly in the NFL, plain and simple. He threw some TD's, but not many, and won a few games. But so did a lot of other QB's that washed out of the league who put up even better stats than he did. The fact remains, if he could play QB and the PRO level, he would already be doing it.   My thought on the Eagles signing is that they are going to wait and see what happens with the possible new extra point rules. If they make it more enticing for teams to go for 2, then Kelly might try to keep Tebow around for just such a thing since:  A.) Kelly might be insane (like kind of a genius, but crazy...that sort of insane) B.) Goal line situations were the only thing Tebow was good at in the NFL it seemed."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,rckymtnclmbr,1 point,Tue Apr 21 20:51:15 2015 UTC,"heh, I am no Tebow supporter...well not the way you are thinking. I like him as a person, and I hope his has success in Philly simply because I love people lose their shit over it. He's obviously not a great NFL QB, but people get wayyy to worked up over him."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,flynryan692,0,Wed Apr 22 02:23:25 2015 UTC,This one is the best.  You should lead off with it in the future.  A terrible pass out of bounds or into the ground could easily be a qb just throwing the ball away.
DenverBroncos,338yzz,Unrelated_Incident,0,Tue Apr 21 18:53:14 2015 UTC,Wow... I actually never saw this game... how wretched.

DenverBroncos,338yzz,Greeney494,0,Tue Apr 21 04:40:54 2015 UTC,I actually saw every game except for the Patriots and Lions games that season... so it's too late for me.
DenverBroncos,338yzz,dgapinski,0,Tue Apr 21 03:30:27 2015 UTC,"Ugh I was at that game, with my friend who was a Lions fan. You can imagine how much fun that was...Just to make it worse there was a man sitting right behind me with a rather effeminate voice screaming TEBOWWWWWWWWW drunkenly over and over again every time he was on the field.  To this day my Lions loving friend still likes to just walk up behind me and give his best rendition of TEBOWWWWWW just because he knows the dark place it brings me back to."

DenverBroncos,338yzz,Designer_B,2,Mon Apr 20 22:08:58 2015 UTC,"If he was throwing it away, it wasn't inaccurate.     A lot of Tebow's bad throws weren't towards an open receiver, and that reveals what really makes him a bad QB: he can't read a defense."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,NegativeGhostwriter,2,Tue Apr 21 01:12:18 2015 UTC,A reminder of what Tebow can do
DenverBroncos,338yzz,codepoet2,0,Mon Apr 20 22:13:23 2015 UTC,"I think my favorite Tebow play might be from the preseason. He scrambled left and crossed the line of scrimmage by several yards, ran back across the line of scrimmage, scrambled right, and then threw the ball. The play probably took 15 seconds and ultimately ended in an illegal forward pass. The one where he had about 7 second of perfect protection but needlessly drifted so far back in the pocket that he ran into Clady's back and took a sack was pretty special, too."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,mysterious_pube,-1,Mon Apr 20 19:13:12 2015 UTC,Hate that we traded him to the Jets of all teams  :/ such a cluster fuck
DenverBroncos,338yzz,smada87,5,Mon Apr 20 17:22:02 2015 UTC,"Well, he chose the Jets. He could have chosen the Jags where he would have been adored, but he chose the Jets."
DenverBroncos,338yzz,Greeney494,5,Mon Apr 20 17:32:42 2015 UTC,I'll never forget how pumped I was that Thursday night. When Tebow scored that touchdown I was pretty much screaming.

DenverBroncos,338yzz,natziel,4,Mon Apr 20 17:55:22 2015 UTC,I was at that game!  Screamed my fucking lungs off.  I also got an Orton chant started cause Tebow played like shit the entire game until the last minute.
DenverBroncos,338yzz,leechsucka,2,Mon Apr 20 18:24:04 2015 UTC,A reminder that he can turn a locker room into a complete circus. Philly will love that.

DenverBroncos,338yzz,testreker,0,Mon Apr 20 18:09:25 2015 UTC,I thought it was just going to be a video of Tebow throwing the ball into the grass sporadically across the field...

I really liked him when he was our QB due to how entertaining the games were and how fun his style was. I don't like it when Broncos fans talk down about him. He wasn't the most skilled QB, but he is a great person and an amazing leader.  Denver needs a leader like him on this team right now."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,30,Sun Apr 19 22:55:55 2015 UTC,"I think we have a great leader, what we need is a guy with as much heart as Tim Tebow. That guy played every down like Elway did in Super Bowl 32."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,andrrrew,17,Sun Apr 19 23:19:00 2015 UTC,That guy played every down in the fourth quarter like Elway did in Super Bowl 32.   FTFY
DenverBroncos,3367rc,ReasonablyFree,5,Sun Apr 19 23:23:45 2015 UTC,"Who is our emotional leader?   That 2011 team had Dawkins (before he got hurt) and Tebow, that is something special. We don't have a vocal member on our team. I suppose Wesley Woodyard filled in that shoe for a few seasons but he is gone now."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,9,Sun Apr 19 23:23:57 2015 UTC,We need a Al Wilson more than anything. Guy who sets the tone defensively
DenverBroncos,3367rc,MrBulger,4,Sun Apr 19 23:33:07 2015 UTC,"God. Yes. If Danny or Marshall became our new Al, I'd be so damn turned on."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,crueg,2,Mon Apr 20 03:48:24 2015 UTC,Well a team doesn't necessarily need an 'emotional leader' if the team already has that innately or the coach can supply it (Fox definitely didn't). I don't feel like the Pats this year really had anyone like that. Brady can kind of be sometimes but it's not like he's especially known for it. But the team of the last few years (Fox era post-Tebow) has lacked any kind of drive IMO and I think it would definitely be a boon to our team if we did have someone like that.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,iSamurai,1 point,Mon Apr 20 02:16:33 2015 UTC,"Def Brady, he gets fucking amped at times."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Designer_B,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:37:44 2015 UTC,"I agree.  Remember all the talk about Brady sucking fat wieners the first few weeks of the season?  I even dropped him from my fantasy team.  He finally got pissed, ripped some ass, and started pillaging anus until he could stroke himself some Lombardi."

DenverBroncos,3367rc,tsegi,13,Mon Apr 20 05:29:17 2015 UTC,In what way did he divide the locker room? The whole team was behind him when he was playing. It wasn't until after he left when guys like Demaryius Thomas were saying negative things about him. I remember Champ Bailey and some Broncos players saying how his leadership was making the defense was playing better.  He was a great leader. People were polarizing of him because of the coverage he was getting but that is not his fault .
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,4,Mon Apr 20 02:48:35 2015 UTC,Pretty much traded Brandon Lloyd because of him
DenverBroncos,3367rc,HailElway,-1,Mon Apr 20 03:09:56 2015 UTC,Lloyd got traded cause his contract was expiring and that is why he went to New England the next season.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:27:56 2015 UTC,He was in St. Louis before he went to NE
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Punching_babies,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:31:34 2015 UTC,"Yes, but he traded to St. Louis in 2011 cause he was going to be free agent by the end of that season. He ended up signing with the Patriots that off-season."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,3,Mon Apr 20 05:12:34 2015 UTC,"He was traded because he wanted more money, but was expendable at that point. We had Eddie Royal, D.T., and Decker. The Broncos did offer him an extension."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Punching_babies,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:17:07 2015 UTC,The defensive players loved Tebow but the offensive players did not because they didn't want to change to adapt to Tebow.. also they were concerned about money because the NFL is first and foremost a business. Plus he was so polarizing and hated in college many players resented him just because half of football fans seem to love him or hate him.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,THE-1138,12,Mon Apr 20 05:37:56 2015 UTC,those among us in the stands who preferred the game management that Kyle Orton brought us.   i preferred making the playoffs.

DenverBroncos,3367rc,Roccos_modern_life,5,Mon Apr 20 03:39:01 2015 UTC,"Kyle Orton was a joke...only ""game manager"" I've seen who'd still pass into double coverage"
DenverBroncos,3367rc,somebuddysbuddy,5,Mon Apr 20 04:46:45 2015 UTC,Which team?
DenverBroncos,3367rc,somebuddysbuddy,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:55:08 2015 UTC,The Bills?
DenverBroncos,3367rc,njm1314,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:23:10 2015 UTC,I don't think the Patriots were serious about keeping him there. I think they just brought him into camp as a favor for Tebow and didn't keep him because they thought some other team would pick him up eventually and he would have a better chance there than behind Brady and Mallet.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,THE-1138,4,Mon Apr 20 06:59:37 2015 UTC,"Orton was the worst starting QB I have seen for the Denver Broncos. He was also losing games. Tebow went to the playoffs and beat the Steelers. Not comparable, I don't know how anyone can stand watching Jack Daniels play."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,AskMeAboutMySwag69,1 point,Mon Apr 20 04:57:38 2015 UTC,"Leadership is making your teammates want to play for the rest of your team and having them motivated. Tebow pretty clearly brought that and yes being a rah rah guy can do that. This team doesn't have that right now and that is why the past 3 seasons, Denver has lost due to being outclassed.   If Orton was playing that season and Tebow gets no chance, Broncos don't make the playoffs in 2011.   You can be as much of a spoiled brat as you want, but Tebow brought a lot of positives to this team."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,-2,Mon Apr 20 05:04:47 2015 UTC,You are funny.  Call People spoiled brat.  Weren't the spoiled brats the ones in the stands calling for an untested QB?  It was the same people who called for Cutler to replace Plummer.  Look how that turned out.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,unsainted,1 point,Mon Apr 20 05:08:40 2015 UTC,"Why would there be a reason to call for an untested QB if the starting QB who had such a talented defense and offense was performing like he should have been?  Orton was playing like garbage and appeared to regress from the previous season.  Fans wanted to see if our first round pick was worth it or not. I wouldn't call that being a spoiled brat.  Kyle Orton is a stop gap guy, he may suffice until you find his replacement but he isn't the plan or the future.  I was under the impression it was more of Shanny's doing for Plummer than the fans.  I could very well be wrong on that though."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Roccos_modern_life,4,Tue Apr 21 03:16:29 2015 UTC,"The fact that this team was 1-4 when Orton was starting? Tebow's offensive system got the team to the playoffs, plain and simple."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,0,Wed Apr 22 01:51:55 2015 UTC,"Yep that offense, and it got the team the 7-4 record that got this team to the playoffs. You just sound like a spoiled brat."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:27:52 2015 UTC,Again!  Spoiled Brat!  Yet years removed from Tebow you still clamor for him?  So odd.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,unsainted,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:25:13 2015 UTC,"1st year starter who everyone knew would be a work in progress.  I feel like you play to your guys strengths and not expect him to jump in and run something he is clearly going to struggle at.  Pete and Chip seem to install systems that play to the strengths of their players, not the other way around and they get praise for it.  Not speaking for the other guy but when you have PFM ready to sign on the dotted line you pull time aside and say ""Hey Tim, thanks for the work last season, if you want to take on a developmental role until 18 hangs it up we would be happy to have you....if that doesn't work, best of luck to you""."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Roccos_modern_life,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:57:51 2015 UTC,So true. People laughed when I said Tebow would get another shot. Wasn't the best QB by any means but he gave us everything and took our 0-4 team to a playoff win. I was always hoping we might take him back when peyton retires or if dysert went somewhere else.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,The-Bigdeal,2,Mon Apr 20 06:53:02 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I love how people discount his record.. ""oh, that was just a fluke"".. haha.. yet, every year we see ""good"" teams with a terrible quarter back that can't go .500   Bottom line.. you can make the playoffs and win a playoff game in the NFL with Tebow at QB.   It remains to be seen if a bums like Sam Bradford or Carson Palmer (for example) can do that ."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Bman409,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:37:03 2015 UTC,So true. And I'm not trying to argue he's going to start again one day but of he can take a winless team that far wouldn't you take him as a cheap backup?
DenverBroncos,3367rc,The-Bigdeal,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:38:46 2015 UTC,"I live in upstate NY. I always wondered why the Bills didn't sign Tebow as at the minimum salary. There's no possible way he could be worse than the guys that have come through Buffalo over the past 10 years.  People seem to forget that Tebow probably has the best college statistics of anyone of all time.. Period. That's at least argueable.  At the end of his college career, Tebow held 5 NCAA, 14 Southeastern Conference, and 28 University of Florida statistical records.[76] He was the SEC's all-time leader in career passing efficiency (170.8), completion percentage (67.1%), passing touchdown to interception ratio (5.5 to 1), rushing yards by a quarterback (2947), rushing touchdowns (any position) (57), and total touchdowns responsible for (145).[2][77] Among many mentions in the NCAA Division-I record book, Tebow is ranked second in career passing efficiency, third in career yards per attempt (9.33), 8th in career rushing touchdowns, and also owns the record for most consecutive games in which he both threw at least one touchdown pass and scored at least one rushing touchdown (14).[78]  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Tebow#College_statistics_and_records  If he's so bad, I really don't know how he put up those throwing numbers in college.  anyway, he's a winner.. the one thing you can't argue is that the guy has won more games than he's lost any time he's started...  probably for his entire life."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Bman409,19,Mon Apr 20 03:42:19 2015 UTC,"I'm going to get tired of hearing about him very quickly, but I'm glad to see he's getting another shot. 2011 was an awesome season"
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Guardax,25,Mon Apr 20 03:43:04 2015 UTC,One of the most fun seasons ever.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,14,Mon Apr 20 03:59:05 2015 UTC,Kind of....You're mainly remembering the last five minutes of like 4 games and the Steelers game and forgetting the games like the 7-3 loss to Orton and the Chiefs...
DenverBroncos,3367rc,milehighthunder,16,Mon Apr 20 06:57:54 2015 UTC,"Exactly. I understand why a lot of people do, but I can't say I actually remember that year particularly fondly, at least not to the extent of dubbing it the most fun season we've ever had outside of 97/98, like a lot of fans seem to. Sure, we had some lucky and/or exciting late game wins, but we also lost four different games by 18+ points, three of those by 26+, and we put up 3 points at home against a division rival. As fun as that team was to watch some weeks, it was truly brutal others."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,8,Mon Apr 20 07:43:10 2015 UTC,"Bingo. Don't get me wrong, I was left speechless by the amount of games we won with him, but mainly because during the first 55 minutes of every game he looked like absolute trash. It was more shocking amazement than pure joy."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,runevault,12,Mon Apr 20 17:08:10 2015 UTC,It also showed how crazy good our defense was that year. Can you imagine that D with Manning running the offense?
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,7,Mon Apr 20 17:51:25 2015 UTC,"That defense was sooooo good. And honestly, I don't know if we saw how truly good they could be, because they were on the field SO much with Tebow, I think they got worn out at the end of the year."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,runevault,6,Mon Apr 20 17:54:51 2015 UTC,Exactly. In spite of how much time they spent on the field they still made a ton of crazy plays. Probably one of the best defenses we've had in a LONG time talent wise. Also credit to Dennis Allen as he showed he was a pretty damned good DC that year.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,1 point,Sun Apr 19 22:54:30 2015 UTC,"Probably why he jumped ship to coach. ""Stick around and bail Tebow out for another year, or just go beat him?"" And then of course Manning happened."

DenverBroncos,3367rc,Von_Miller,0,Sun Apr 19 23:51:01 2015 UTC,Then I guess I was wrong. Carry on haha
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Unrelated_Incident,0,Mon Apr 20 00:05:32 2015 UTC,"Yea but no matter how much we were down, at the beginning of the fourth I always felt like we might come back.  Winning is better than losing, but that was one hell of a ride."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,njm1314,3,Mon Apr 20 00:16:18 2015 UTC,That game is like a Nam flashback for me. One of the most excruciatingly bad football games I've ever watched. I think people just remember the highlights and forget three and a half torturous quarters of three and outs.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,2,Mon Apr 20 00:19:58 2015 UTC,"If any doctor or psychiatrist wants to prove the brain subconsciously tries to erase traumatic experiences, then Broncos fans would be great test subjects.  I paid money to go to that Chiefs game. That's kind of when I was done with the Tebow experiment."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Von_Miller,2,Mon Apr 20 00:51:26 2015 UTC,"I think we're remembering his 6 game win streak and his winning recording with the Broncos, including the recording breaking wildcard game against the steelers where he broke the record for most passes over 50+ yards in a post season game and the shortest ever overtime win.   Go hate on Tebow in the Eagles sub. Or start a blog if you feel the need to vent about how much you hate the guy."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:56:48 2015 UTC,"Kyle Orton had a six game winning streak with the Broncos too. Tebow was bad, he was out of the league for a reason, and having me say he was bad is not only supported by facts, but in reality, an honest assessment."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Von_Miller,0,Mon Apr 20 12:49:09 2015 UTC,"I never considered Orton to be a bad QB and Tebow is a ""bad"" QB technically, but he did make plays. I'm not saying if want him back on the Broncos, but I think he could help a  team that needs a QB who can lead the team and make plays when they need it."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,iSamurai,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:49:31 2015 UTC,"IDK, it was more than just 4 games. We had 7 Wins (3 in OT) after the BYE and Tebow replaced Orton in the lineup. It's true that the last three games were kind of forgotten during that season though."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,2,Mon Apr 20 20:14:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah all of those wins were against BAD teams. The Dolphins were winless when we played them, the Raiders were the Raiders, the Jets were bad, the Chargers and Chiefs were bad, the Vikings and Bears were bad.   No team Timmy beat that year finished with a winning record.  Yet when we played the good teams, Patriots, Lions, etc., they would put up 40.  We made the playoffs despite being 8-8 and losing the last three games.   I know ""Tebow Time"" seemed special, but it was a farce. It was strokes of luck against bad teams.  Seriously, if Marion Barber stays inbounds, I doubt you remember 2011 the same way you do now. ANd don't forget about Prater. It's not like he was knocking in chip shots because Tebow drove the offense deep into the red zone; Prater was kicking in 50 yarders to keep the team alive.   It was a memorable season, but it really wasn't as fun or exciting as most fans are remembering it."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,2,Mon Apr 20 19:38:38 2015 UTC,Jets were bad? They finished 8-8 and were in the playoff hunt until Santonio Holmes decided to start acting out.   Bears were also a .500 team and made it to the NFC championship game the year before   We were competing with the Raiders for the AFC West division.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:36:37 2015 UTC,The Bears had Caleb Hanie at QB. The Jets only scored 13 points and we still needed to beat them on the final drive. We lost the last 3 games of the season and the Raiders still couldn't take over the top spot in the AFC West.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,1 point,Mon Apr 20 00:54:30 2015 UTC,"Apparently Tebow is the worst QB ever, so why are we using excuses of playing against a bad QB? Jets were never known for their offense. They put up 13 and a certain someone and co. put up 17 to win. Ok, Raiders were still .500 and the top competition of the division along with the Chargers."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Mmmmmmmbi,2,Mon Apr 20 12:46:40 2015 UTC,Didn't the defense have like 2 touchdowns against the jets that game?  Never mind just looked it up. They had one defensive td that game not 2
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,1 point,Mon Apr 20 13:51:12 2015 UTC,So what's the point you're making here?
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,0,Mon Apr 20 20:16:50 2015 UTC,I was just correcting you about the teams we were playing against were bad. Some of the teams were borderline playoff teams.

DenverBroncos,3367rc,iSamurai,4,Mon Apr 20 03:33:51 2015 UTC,That seemed like just a badly placed ball. Was that Sanchez throwing to him?
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,0,Mon Apr 20 03:37:32 2015 UTC,"Ah yes, those badly placed balls that hit their receivers. ""hey why didn't you catch that ball?"" ""It hit me in the helmet coach, how am I supposed to be able to catch it?"" /s"
DenverBroncos,3367rc,iSamurai,7,Mon Apr 20 04:59:01 2015 UTC,I'm just saying that ball should've been placed in front of him where only he could reach it especially considering he's not a receiver. He looked back at the right time and didn't have much time to react and try and reposition to catch a ball above him. Plenty of receivers would've had the same issue with that ball. Any way you look at it that ball is not where it was supposed to be with that route.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,-8,Mon Apr 20 03:44:26 2015 UTC,It's weird you're defending this.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Unrelated_Incident,1 point,Mon Apr 20 03:46:31 2015 UTC,That was a bad pass.  I don't know why you're trying to say it wasn't a bad pass.  There aren't a lot of quarterbacks that would have caught that.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,2,Mon Apr 20 01:07:08 2015 UTC,Yes but could a tight end or full back have caught it? Was the route he ran shitty to begin with? I know a lot of people say he's this great athlete that could play fullback or tight end and then I just watch this play and say nah.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Unrelated_Incident,1 point,Mon Apr 20 14:21:25 2015 UTC,Sure it's possible he ran the wrong route.  I think most fullbacks would not have caught that pass.  So my opinion is that if he ran the right route it's the QBs fault and if he ran the wrong route it's obviously his fault for running the wrong route.  I don't think not catching the pass was that big of a deal.  It looked like a tough pass to catch.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,painaulevain,-6,Sun Apr 19 23:35:55 2015 UTC,4 years later and we still have Tebow apologists.    You can't put this guy on your team without alienating half your fanbase.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,2,Mon Apr 20 02:13:34 2015 UTC,"I didn't like Tim as a quarterback, but in no way do I hate him as much as I hate Tebowmaniacs. There is a deep, deep raging disdain for his followers. Quiet for 55 minutes, and then when the other team screws up TEBOW TEBOW TEBOW TEBOW.   Despite having the choice between choosing a scholarship between Florida and Alabama, starting at Florida for multiple seasons, being drafted in the first round, somehow winning a playoff game, being able to choose where the Broncos would trade him, and not being able to beat out Mark Sanchez as a starter, Tebowmaniacs STILL think he wasn't given a fair shot. Get the hell out of here with that logic."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,iSamurai,-2,Mon Apr 20 03:25:10 2015 UTC,You're the one that's pretending like you know anything about me. You have no idea who I am or how deep my blood runs with blue and orange. My loyalties are with the Denver Broncos not anyone especially a guy like you who decides to make baseless assumptions about someone who has said nothing about whether he likes Tim Tebow or not. I do not have any respect for so-called 'fans' that decide to incite infighting of the fanbase over one player that was only with us for a few years. I guess 'United in Orange' doesn't mean anything to you.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Greeney494,2,Mon Apr 20 03:38:33 2015 UTC,"In no way did I refer to you as a Tebowmaniac. It obviously looked like that, but it wasn't meant towards you, it was supposed to be a response to the the guy I responded to. It was in my inbox and didn't see the context. Sorry if that statement offended you."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Bronc27,8,Mon Apr 20 03:42:15 2015 UTC,Good. I will be rooting for him.

DenverBroncos,3367rc,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,8,Mon Apr 20 19:55:28 2015 UTC,"Good for him. While he nearly gave me a heart attack every game that season, it was definitely one of the most memorable ones."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,Manfrenjensenjen,5,Mon Apr 20 20:11:25 2015 UTC,"Good for him! Now that he's 3 teams removed from Denver, maybe we'll stop hearing the mind numbingly stupid comments about Elway sabotaging him as a Bronco. Because, obviously a new GM is going to make his QB look bad because, you know, he's got a big ego and will get his feelings hurt if the team succeeds, or something like that."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,DominizZzle,5,Mon Apr 20 03:57:40 2015 UTC,My boy Tebow. I hope he does well. He's not a great QB by any stretch of the imagination but I hope he can tear it up a little bit.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,PlansBandC,6,Mon Apr 20 04:02:21 2015 UTC,"He seems to be a decent person, and that's cool.  But he is not and never will be an NFL caliber QB."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,bmsuperfly,4,Mon Apr 20 09:20:13 2015 UTC,"I wish him the best. I actually miss him on the team. I wish he was still a QB on this team albeit 3rd string competing with Brock, but his intangibles are amazing."

DenverBroncos,3367rc,bmsuperfly,4,Sun Apr 19 22:58:21 2015 UTC,Doesn't matter people hate when your opinions differ from theirs. I always have thought if it wasn't for the media circus Tebow would have been a backup in this league the entire time. Some people disagree with that. It is what it is.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,0,Sun Apr 19 22:57:11 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't want him on this team competing for a 3rd or 2nd string job. The media is very Tebow-loving which is why his career has been on hiatus. Teams are afraid of having a circus like that. If Tebow was still on the team, people would have been calling for Peyton's benching in the 2nd half of the season last year.   If our team just had Brock as the starting QB, I'd be ok with him being here though, but not with Peyton."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,bmsuperfly,1 point,Sun Apr 19 23:12:33 2015 UTC,"It would be the total different way. Peyton has the credentials to stay starting. Brock hasn't proved anything? How does it make sense people are going to complain to bench Peyton for him, but not Brock?  Fans complain all the time, doesn't mean they're right, and it's all apart of the media circus I mentioned."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,WeDENverBoyz24,2,Sun Apr 19 23:27:57 2015 UTC,"People right now are already calling for Peyton to be gone and replaced by Brock, not smart people obviously but you get my point.   In 2012, when this happened, we were taking a real risk with Peyton given his neck surgeries.   If Tebow had remained on the team, people would be calling for him every single week especially with how inconsistent Peyton was in the first 5 weeks. There is a reason why we REALLY tried to get rid of Tebow.   I'm a huge Tebow fan but in all honesty, every move he does will be followed even as a 3rd string QB. He would be better off competing for a potential starting job since it would also light a fire under the QBs ass. He would just be a pain in the ass here because as you said Peyton is a proven future HOFer."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,bmsuperfly,0,Mon Apr 20 02:43:54 2015 UTC,The only reason Tebow wasn't in the league before this is due to his crazy fans which I think spurred from the Media to begin with.   It's so stupid that fans would argue Peyton needs benched. Then again I forgot non smart people control everything due to being vocal. Man I hate sports sometimes.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,njm1314,3,Mon Apr 20 01:48:03 2015 UTC,The only reason Tebow wasn't in the league before   Really buddy? The only reason? Nothing to do with his inability to complete even half of his passes? Nothing to do with over 30% of the Bronco's drives ending in a three and out? Come on.
DenverBroncos,3367rc,bmsuperfly,2,Sun Apr 19 23:36:30 2015 UTC,"When guys like Ryan Lindley, and Charlie Whitehurst who hardly ever get to see the field are still in the league. Then yes I think it is. I'm not saying he's a starter I'm saying he should be in the league. Stop acting like Tebow was the worst player to ever play in the NFL he wasn't."
DenverBroncos,3367rc,p-wing,3,Sun Apr 19 23:54:14 2015 UTC,"Okay. Talk to me again in 4½ months.  He's going to be a much better broadcaster than he will ever be a quarterback. It's good he's not giving up on playing, but I don't think he's going to pan out for anyone...but Chip Kelly gives him the best chance, that's for sure."

I am not sure how he is an attention seeker either. He has hardly shown up in the media since his hiatus.   Tebow is considered to be one of the greatest college football players of all-time. He had a cult long before coming to the NFL. He didn't ask for this.    I can't stand people who are ungrateful of what he did when he was here. Yes, he got a lot more credit than he deserved thanks to idiots like Skip Bayless, but we were a fun ass team to watch and he was a great leader and turned it up in the clutch."

Why waste all those draft picks?"" Klis wrote.   That's just fucking retarded. First of all we are not all in to win. We've actually had a very low key off season and let good talent walk rather then over pay. Second, draft picks end up on the practice squad all the time or are simply cut. There's a reason successful teams rarely trade up in the first. Most guys drafted don't work out so more picks gives you a better chance at finding a solid contributer."
DenverBroncos,335y2p,powersty,0,Mon Apr 20 04:24:37 2015 UTC,"This post is entirely too harsh and absolute. Yes there is better chance of landing a quality guy if you have more numbers, but there is no point in loading up on draft picks just to cut them. Plus its just non-sensical to think there is no correlation between where you are selected in the draft and your chance of success. Yes there are busts, but generally speaking this holds true, so there is value in trading up. I don't think we really need to trade up to get a quality O lineman, but I would be ok with it to land a true starter. If it was simply a numbers game than scouting and creating your teams preferences would not be as big of a pre-draft exercise as it is. We don't have many available spots on the 53 man active roster (I count nearly 75 pre-draft players on the roster) and there are only 10 players on the practice squad total. So, just dumping them onto the practice squad can't be the only answer. I don't think all in to win now and building a team to win over the long term are mutually exclusive things. Just ask the patriots. Letting people go doesn't mean we gave up on a super bowl run this season, and it had more to do with schematic fit than anything. The point that was being made is that in the first few rounds we need to be looking to draft people that can start on the offensive line or be rotational players in the defensive front 7, if not, we are not giving manning or the rest of the team their best shot at winning this year. Finally, since you felt like being a dick, you might want to use the right then/than."
DenverBroncos,335y2p,MillerTime58,0,Mon Apr 20 16:04:01 2015 UTC,Calling it now. They trade the 28th pick to the Pats for the 31st to get 2 more picks in the 7th round.  This is pretty much what Elway has done every draft.

But the more I watch him, and the more I hear about him, I could see him being a steal.   He gets knocked for being a guy that doesn't come from a top conference, but the MWC isn't as much of a slouch as they get grief for. Besides, some of the best QB's didn't come from top programs or big conferences. Joe Flacco, Big Ben, Drew Brees all come from schools that aren't exactly challenging for the BCS playoffs.   He has seen the good and ugly parts of football. I think a lot of QB's from top programs struggle because they've never NOT been on a top tier team. How can A.J. McCarron be trusted to lead a fringe team when he's never felt like his team wasn't as talented? GG was at CSU when they were a JOKE, and he lead them to their current place in the MWC.  He is a good size, and has a decent arm. His ball security sucks, and he tends to hold onto the ball too long.   All that being said, I don't think the Broncos will take him. He isn't a can't miss prospect, and he isn't an improvement over Brock at this point. The ONLY way I'll be okay with the Broncos taking him is in the 5th or later. Considering I see him going to a team that doesn't need a starter, but isn't comfortable in their current QB place, he will go earlier than that. I can't see him making it past the Bears at 71."

He said he's been working on it, and I could tell from the snippets that I saw.  I'm a huge CSU homer and I would love nothing more than having Grayson in the orange and blue, but I think it would be a poor decision for the Broncos to invest a 2nd or 3rd round pick on him.  I'm trying to think of a comp of who Garrett Grayson could be in the NFL... I keep coming back to Marc Bulger. They're the same size, Grayson probably a better athlete though. Both have good enough arms to make all the throws, but neither have top-end arm strength. Both hold on to the ball a little too long and seem to be beat up all the time. Both are good leaders but not super charismatic.  Both have the smarts to run a complex offense. Both spent a large portion of their careers with Ram horns on their helmets."
DenverBroncos,335kr6,CO_Boiler,5,Sun Apr 19 19:35:24 2015 UTC,"This may be unpopular in this subreddit, but the Broncos really shouldn't draft any quarterback.

Not every season ticket holder can go to every single game so that might be your best bet.   http://www.ticketexchangebyticketmaster.com/NFL/denver-broncos-tickets/  That website also talks about other ways to get tickets. Ticketmaster and league ticket offices also supply them. They're probably going to cost well over face value, but I rarely see it any other way.  The last thing, and since you live out of town this should be the absolute last resort and might not even be worth the risk, is scalpers. I've never gone to a game without scalpers, but in 2013 the Jacksonville/Denver game upper level scalped tickets were around $200 for just one.   When the schedule comes out get the tickets ASAP so they 1) don't sell out (the resold ones, that is) and 2) they don't destroy your bank account."

Something to keep in mind is that Manning is a notorious snap hog.  Until Brock gets substantial meaningful snaps with the first team offense in practice, which he likely won't as long as Manning is here, he's not going to build the chemistry he needs to show his full potential."

DenverBroncos,334w36,tnick771,3,Sun Apr 19 16:57:02 2015 UTC,Osweiler is not a QB of a calibre suited to inherit this team. That's what a lot of people are weary about.  There are a TON of question marks around Osweiler's game and he really has not had a good shake in the NFL yet. Luckily Kubiak is wanting to see what Osweiler is made of before Manning rides off into the sunset.
DenverBroncos,334w36,johninbigd,3,Sun Apr 19 16:35:19 2015 UTC,See that my thing right there what makes you think he is not that calibur? I mean from what we have seen there is no evidence to say he can't be of that calibur and no evidence to say that he will. I just think as fans we shouldn't speculate so much. In the end it comes down to the player and his abilities why should we make their job harder with saying he can't do it before he even gets the chance.
DenverBroncos,334w36,TheClayroo,5,Sun Apr 19 16:41:11 2015 UTC,"No one knows what sort of player he is. The coaches, who see him regularly in practice and in meetings, like him.

DenverBroncos,334w36,Colorado222,5,Sun Apr 19 17:37:45 2015 UTC,"This is the same thing that happened with Aaron Rodgers. Nobody believed in him because who could follow up such a legend?

DenverBroncos,334w36,thekingearl,2,Sun Apr 19 19:02:02 2015 UTC,"I was comparing Osweiler to Flacco before we even got Kubiak, now it just firms my position.  He'll be a decent game manager just because of all the time he's spent with Peyton, and he has a massive arm for the long ball. We'll have more of a focus on running anyways, so Brock won't be the focal point of our offense. We're going to have a decent QB after Peyton. The mentoring alone will do wonders. It's not like we're drafting him and starting him day one. Those stupid rookie mistakes are gone. There will be some jitters, but not like it would be for someone out of college. He's ready, and I know he'll be fine."
DenverBroncos,334w36,WeDENverBoyz24,0,Sun Apr 19 19:11:33 2015 UTC,"I'm not sold just by playing the percentages. Not very many QBs turn out to be NFL starting caliber, let alone a starter that you're truly happy to have and not just the guy manning the ship until a better option comes along. Until he proves otherwise I'm assuming he's not going to be that good. I also have to assume that if he was lighting it up in practice and camp he'd be calling to be traded and/or other teams would be calling about him. I hope he turns out to be the next Aaron Rodgers off the bench, but that just doesn't happen that often."
DenverBroncos,334w36,AngerFork,1 point,Tue Apr 21 19:13:50 2015 UTC,"I do believe in Brock, but it is not like he is completely taking over games and dominating out there when he plays whether it is preseason or coming in for Peyton at end of games.   Fans are critical of him because they think the tiny sample size measures all. However, he hasn't played with 1st stringers yet and clearly doesn't practice with them very often outside of the Chargers game when Peyton went to the locker room early and he like threw away 3 plays.   If Peyton ever leaves a game due to an injury and Brock comes in, he needs to play well in order to earn the fans trust. It is how Aaron Rodgers earned the Packers trust. In 2007, Favre left the Cowboys game and Rodgers played exceptionally well. They believed in him after that and cut ties with Favre the next season."
DenverBroncos,334w36,Coos-Coos,1 point,Sun Apr 19 17:47:26 2015 UTC,"I try, but there's still a lot to get past with the Lobster.  Based on what we have seen in fill-in time as well as in pre-season, he has looked serviceable, but not super great.  And his play style is far different than what we are seeing from Peyton.  Coming off of 4 years of Peyton, our team is used to a far different plan of attack on offense than we have.  True, he does have Peyton, but look at Indy's backups when they had Peyton.  Jim Sorgi and Curtis Painter both generally looked awful when they got on the field, partially because Peyton hogged the snaps.  If Kubiak can truly get Brock in there more, Brock may have a chance...but without those snaps, he's really not getting NFL experience.  Finally, it also comes down to how much of a chance he'll get.  If he has issues (as many players do in their first year of action), people will be calling for the quick yank, warranted or no.  This goes doubly so as he is following one of the greatest QBs ever.  And Elway is anxious to get to a super bowl.    All of this leads me to the same conclusion: he won't be horrible, but with Denver being such a QB focused town (thanks to Elway), good just won't be good enough."
DenverBroncos,334w36,AngerFork,2,Sun Apr 19 16:27:01 2015 UTC,"I disagree with a lot of what you said. Your opinions seem very pessimistic. We haven't seen enough of him to know how he'll be.  IMHO even one full season of starting isn't enough to really get an idea of how a QB will perform, and he hasn't even started a full game yet."
DenverBroncos,334w36,Coos-Coos,1 point,Sun Apr 19 16:38:04 2015 UTC,"First of all, please do not mistake my view on this situation for pessimism towards Brock or the Broncos.  It's neither...rather, it's realistically (IMHO) looking at the challenges he will have to face.  You are correct that we haven't seen enough of him to know...but therein lies the problem.  This is his fourth season, and we've barely seen him out there.  Although there are examples of success stories this way (Aaron Rodgers), it's definitely not the norm.  I would love if he had a similar story to Aaron Rodgers...that would be nothing short of fantastic.  The problem comes from time in that case.  Aaron Rodgers went to a place willing to give him the time, and he did so much with it.  If he's given the time, he'll likely be at least serviceable, if not really good.  But that's only if he gets the time as a starter here.  If he doesn't, then we may well be looking at a journeyman."

DenverBroncos,3330zk,BewareDWare,13,Sun Apr 19 01:12:20 2015 UTC,A lot of people here have given up on Montee it seems. We drafted him in the second for a reason. I think he'll flourish in the ZBS and push CJ for the lead role.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,ThreezusManning,6,Sun Apr 19 01:21:54 2015 UTC,"I'm with you, there was really nothing to discourage us about Montee considering he admitted he forced his return too soon from his preseason injury so he was hurt ALL year. Zone blocking could see him get back to his old self."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,Greeney494,1 point,Sun Apr 19 01:30:14 2015 UTC,"I don't doubt that coming back early made it difficult for him, but that doesn't explain why he would run right into his own team mates. Nobody is really questioning his speed, it is his vision that has the questions marks."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,flynryan692,5,Sun Apr 19 02:30:33 2015 UTC,"It's really hard to tell based on his play last season for me. It seemed like every time he touched the ball he'd either get hit right away or one of our O-linemen would be directly in his way after getting knocked off the line. One of the things he was touted for out of college was his great vision and it showed in his rookie year. It's hard for me to believe that he suddenly just lost it. Don't get me wrong, he wasn't perfect or even good last year, but I'm hoping it was more of a sophomore slump than anything."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,ThreezusManning,-1,Sun Apr 19 02:37:47 2015 UTC,"I don't think he has ever demonstrated good vision. A lot of his runs last season also hurt his linemen a lot since he ran behind them instead of through the holes. He did a poor job finding the holes, not saying it is all on him because the OL was just bad last season but I feel like from what I've seen he has had issues.   He did well as a rookie cause the OL was better, the competition was easier, and most importantly because the coaching was better. I don't think it is a coincidence that this OL went to shit when Alex Gibbs left as the consultant."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,ThreezusManning,2,Sun Apr 19 02:44:19 2015 UTC,Those are fair points. I'm still hoping he can be a good back-up/emergency starter. He seems like a good dude and I am partial to Wisconsin guys.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,Greeney494,3,Sun Apr 19 02:49:52 2015 UTC,People also forget how terrible the OLine was at the beginning of the season.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,flynryan692,0,Sun Apr 19 02:53:58 2015 UTC,"CJ ran behind that same line before it got shifted and did fine. He didn't have a lot of snaps, but he still did fine. The oline excuse is weak. I'm not really sold on Montee being this great RB, but I'm not on the ""get rid of him he sucks"" bandwagon either. The jury is still out, we'll see."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,Occams_Lazor_,1 point,Sun Apr 19 05:11:04 2015 UTC,The snaps thing can't be trivialized like that. He wasn't injured and it's possible the line just had a better time blocking for a larger percent of the time he was in than Montees.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,rileysill32,-1,Sun Apr 19 11:58:54 2015 UTC,That's not true. The oline changed in the 2nd half of the Arizona game. I have access to the Broncos playbook and weekly playbook handouts.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,Neverethe,-5,Sun Apr 19 17:32:03 2015 UTC,"That is just one sample size, you could probably use a sample size where the OL was great and he failed to make something happen."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Apr 19 03:28:31 2015 UTC,I just think Thompson from what we saw this year was better. I don't know about pushing CJ for the lead role. There will be some competition but CJ has like a 95% chance of winning it.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,s460,-3,Sun Apr 19 01:51:57 2015 UTC,You do realize that Kubiak is one of the only coaches that still uses Fullbacks? Thompson will most likely be in THAT role.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,ThreezusManning,3,Sun Apr 19 02:25:01 2015 UTC,"Or James Casey, or this mammoth of Joe John Duncan at 6'3"" 270+ lb TE who we just signed after working him out at FB..."

DenverBroncos,3330zk,CO_Boiler,1 point,Mon Apr 20 20:02:14 2015 UTC,"Or this guy named James Casey, who has been playing fullback for years now. Why is Thompson going to be put at Fullback besides the fact that you want him to?"
DenverBroncos,3330zk,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:30:07 2015 UTC,I don't think he'll be used there a ton but he could actually carry the ball from the FB spot compared to Casey who will most likely just block and receive out of the backfield.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:40:30 2015 UTC,Just seems to fit. I am also a believer that Montee Ball has been used in a fashion completely opposite to what he would thrive in.
DenverBroncos,3330zk,crueg,1 point,Sun Apr 19 02:34:29 2015 UTC,"Also, what would you want Montee to be used as? He's an up the middle back idk how else you want him used..."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,ThreezusManning,1 point,Sun Apr 19 04:29:59 2015 UTC,"He shouldn't run out of shotgun so much to be honest. I think he would do better if he has had a fullback blocking for him. He is more of a downfield runner like a Stevan Ridley which was his NFL draft comparison, hopefully he can be as productive as him."
DenverBroncos,3330zk,ThreezusManning,0,Sun Apr 19 07:13:29 2015 UTC,"Every running back would be better with a fullback so that doesn't change much for him. If he can't run without a fullback he better hope he makes this team, otherwise his options are pretty limited. And I would compare Ridley closest to Hillman if Hillman was a little heavier because Ridley really didn't run up the middle much, he was more of a 3rd down back who could go outside and catch. That's not Ball's MO at all. He never caught it at Wisconsin, and remember his struggles his rookie year with catching? I think, and hope, ZB helps him but I don't know for sure."
DenverBroncos,332hif,YakPineapple,9,Sat Apr 18 22:03:50 2015 UTC,Anyone with a cool name. I'm still mourning the loss of Mister Cobble.  Edit: I found our guy.

DenverBroncos,332hif,CO_Boiler,5,Sun Apr 19 02:44:15 2015 UTC,"This is where I let my school bias come in done because I think they can be good value picks in the last round type deal.  1) Akeem Hunt, RB, Purdue. Extremely fast, and is small but fights hard and ran between the tackles a lot last year. If he got step he was gone. Also has very good hands and is tough as nails.  2) Landon Feichter, FS, Purdue. Hard nosed guy that plays with a chip on his shoulder, he wasn't ever supposed to make the team, except the coach thought he was someone else. Good tackler, and has a nose for the ball. To end last year's season (IIRC) he had 3 ints, 2 FF, 1 FR, and 4 PBs, in the last 4 games.  3) Ryan Russell, DE, Purdue. He has all of the tools, you can see the flashes of greatness. I think Bum, and Kolliar could open him up and he could be a good rotational end.  Like I say those are just my fantasy 7th round/UDFA picks."
DenverBroncos,332hif,Bilyman,2,Sat Apr 18 22:40:59 2015 UTC,Would be interested in Feichter we for sure need depth at FS.
DenverBroncos,332hif,CO_Boiler,3,Sat Apr 18 23:12:44 2015 UTC,"His only thing is he's not fast, but somehow he was always in the right spot. So that tells me he is good at diagnosing plays and reading the QB to get his jump."
DenverBroncos,332hif,moondoggle,2,Sun Apr 19 00:03:22 2015 UTC,"also as a CSU homer, I would want the Broncos to give Dee Hart, Kivon Cartwright, Jared Roberts a shot.  Roberts is actually a decent kicker. Also Max Morgan"

DenverBroncos,331ok3,Cynical_Doggie,8,Sat Apr 18 21:54:40 2015 UTC,"It will be similar to the post Elway years. We will be okay, mostly because of the names we signed while Manning was here.  As far as Brock, I'm on the fence about him. I really don't think we will know his full potential until he is thrown on the fire."

DenverBroncos,331ok3,dragonbear,2,Mon Apr 20 21:08:55 2015 UTC,I would be very happy if Brock comes out and kicks some ass. Even after a few growing years. But I couldn't put money on it either.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,Jbjs311,12,Mon Apr 20 21:15:46 2015 UTC,Brock Osweiler will be our starter unless he leaves in free agency.

DenverBroncos,331ok3,natziel,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:41:35 2015 UTC,He's already done a pretty good job of showing that he doesn't suck. Actually watch film on him.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,aatencio91,3,Sat Apr 18 20:46:36 2015 UTC,He hasn't shown much of anything... Where are you watching film?
DenverBroncos,331ok3,natziel,2,Mon Apr 20 16:09:50 2015 UTC,"Mile High Report did a good job analyzing his preseason last year. Not just ""how accurate is he throwing it"", but a good analysis on how he's developed mentally, which is something you can judge in preseason. His ability to read coverages, anticipate blitzes, direct the offense, and read defenders has increased dramatically since he was drafted. All that's left for him now is to keep getting experience and exposure to new defenses.  http://www.milehighreport.com/2014/8/11/5988405/denver-broncos-film-study-evaluating-brock-osweiler  http://www.milehighreport.com/2014/8/21/6052839/evaluating-brock-osweiler-part-2  http://www.milehighreport.com/2014/8/28/6078727/brock-osweiler-evaluating-his-performance-against-houston  http://www.milehighreport.com/mhr-film-study/2014/9/2/6096253/brock-osweiler-final-preseason-evaluation  His Houston game was the worst by far, so if you want to look at what he still has to learn, start there. The other games he only makes a handful of minor mistakes."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,Neverethe,2,Mon Apr 20 16:28:20 2015 UTC,Because we all know the true measure of a quarterback is how he plays in preseason.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,natziel,1 point,Mon Apr 20 21:00:11 2015 UTC,"Come on, really? Reading a defense is reading a defense, whether it's preseason or not. You know this. Figure out whatever is making you bitter and remove it from your life."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,Neverethe,1 point,Tue Apr 21 00:47:55 2015 UTC,Oh I am bitter because I doubt how good a BACKUP quarterback is at football. Brock is most likely never going to be a Pro-Bowl QB. Now figure out whatever is causing your delusions and remove them from your life.

DenverBroncos,331ok3,natziel,-2,Sat Apr 18 22:01:02 2015 UTC,"Or if this team manages to trade or acquire another superstar QB like Rivers or Brady. I think this team will not be targeting for any QB prospects in the draft, maybe undrafted guys though."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,idgafau5,5,Sat Apr 18 18:57:13 2015 UTC,"I'm convinced that we'll take Grayson in the 2nd if he's still available. He'll be a good insurance policy in case the browns or someone outbids us for Brock. We don't need any UDFA quarterbacks since we have Dysert.  I think we'll bring in a veteran QB, but it's a lot more likely to be Matt Schaub than Philip Rivers."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,gakbds,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:34:29 2015 UTC,"I really hope they can snag Grayson, I think he's got the stuff."

DenverBroncos,331ok3,gakbds,5,Sat Apr 18 22:01:48 2015 UTC,"What the fuck is your problem with Brock? You clearly have never watched him play, so shut the fuck up until you have."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,natziel,-1,Sat Apr 18 22:08:48 2015 UTC,I watched him play throughout all of his college career
DenverBroncos,331ok3,Neverethe,2,Sat Apr 18 22:32:13 2015 UTC,And his only major criticism going into the draft was that he needed time to develop. Guess what? It's been three years and he's developed.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,WeDENverBoyz24,1 point,Sat Apr 18 22:35:22 2015 UTC,Into what? A less awkward baby giraffe? I'm not sold on him one bit.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,Dbash56,2,Mon Apr 20 21:01:38 2015 UTC,"Brock is the perfect QB under Kubiak's offensive system given his skillset. There is no reason to go after any other QB unless something unexpected happens like him demanding a trade or another superstar QB hits the market.   The team will be different just because Brock's skillset is far different than Peyton. I don't think anyone should expect to see the typical Kubiak offense we all saw when he was the OC here or when he was coaching the Texans this upcoming season. He is going to mix it up with what Peyton likes to do too. When Brock takes over, I expect to see the Kubiak system in full store though."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,codepoet2,2,Sun Apr 19 00:22:03 2015 UTC,"I hope we get Hackenburg next year, he's looked great at PSU from the games I've seen, even just as a backup if Osweiler doesn't work out   But holy crap I want the Lobster to Rule the NFL"
DenverBroncos,331ok3,areallysmallusername,2,Sun Apr 19 23:13:47 2015 UTC,"It's tough to say. Osweiler just hasn't gotten enough play time for us to really know. One thing seems clear to me:  We'll know more after the draft. If they really like Brock and truly view him as the post-Peyton plan, then they keep him and he's our no.2 just like before. If they have doubts, they'll shop him in draft pick packages (to move up) and then draft another QB later in the draft (and maybe trade something else for a journeyman backup).  The reason I say this, is Osweiler has value right now.  He's unknown commodity, with high potential that's been watching Peyton Manning play.  Teams love to gamble on that potential franchise QB...  After Winston and Mariota, in this upcoming draft, who would you rather have?  Osweiler or Hundley or Petty or Grayson?  Osweiler has less risk than those guys.  So if Denver does not really love Osweiler, they should deal him on draft day."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,jlange94,3,Mon Apr 20 22:29:22 2015 UTC,I have high hopes for Brock Lobster. There will be a lot of eyes looking to see if he can carry the team after the big guy leaves for good. The team will either have a steep falling of bandwagoners and/or expectations or have everyone staring to see what we have left to offer. I think having Manning as Osweilers mentor/teacher for the last 2-3 years is going to give him a great chance of being awesome in the starting position. I believe in Brock Lobster and hope he can carry the weight that Manning will leave him.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,bgzlvsdmb,1 point,Sat Apr 18 18:01:12 2015 UTC,"No one really knows. Kubiak and Elway probably still don't. But the next logical player would be Brock.   From what I as a fan have seen from him is good arm strength, fair accuracy, decent mobility, and good command at the line of scrimmage. Speaking on that last bit, when he came in for Peyton late one game in Denver last season, what was particular was how well he could command the line much in the same way Peyton does it. Obviously not as well but you could see shades and that tells us he's definitely been doing his work in studying the playbook. Any QB with a high football IQ will do good even if they aren't the most talented, which is why I'm not too scared if Brock does take over."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,EtobicokeKing,1 point,Sat Apr 18 19:09:17 2015 UTC,He's studied under one of the greats.   Yep. So did Curtis Painter. And that worked out well for him. /s  That's honestly why I'm not convinced this entire time Brock's been on the bench has been good for him at all.
DenverBroncos,331ok3,PhillAholic,2,Sat Apr 18 19:49:29 2015 UTC,"I think the fans are trying to look at it from a more optimistic standpoint. Aaron Rodgers stood behind Favre for years and became who he is.   With that said, Painter is different than Brock. Painter was a 6th round pick so it was clear he wasn't even that talented. Brock was a 2nd round pick and was pretty good in college."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,EtobicokeKing,-4,Sat Apr 18 19:57:11 2015 UTC,"Being optimistic and sucking him off through the internet are two very different things, though."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,DamanArress,3,Sat Apr 18 20:42:18 2015 UTC,"This argument about Painter drives me crazy. Painter was drafted in the sixth round to purely be a back-up. Osweiler was taken in the second obviously intended to be a future starter one day. Whether or not he becomes one is yet to be seen but just because Painter, a sixth rounder, didn't work out doesn't mean Brock won't."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,DamanArress,2,Sat Apr 18 19:58:13 2015 UTC,"It's because it's unknown. No backup to Peyton Manning ever turned out to be anything. But as we saw in 2011 (The fact that Painter wasn't even given the chance to start right away and they signed Collins), The Colts didn't exactly fill the position with someone that was suppose to."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,SALTY_BALLZ,1 point,Sat Apr 18 20:45:12 2015 UTC,"Mannings two main backups in Indy were Painter and Sorgi (a seventh round choice), neither were expected to do anything but be a serviceable back up."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,SALTY_BALLZ,-3,Sat Apr 18 20:53:42 2015 UTC,"I honestly see a sharp decline. Not because Manning is our superstar, but because his name brings in people who normally might not play for us.  We need a palate cleansing couple of years. We got a lot of ""bandwagon"" fans with the Tebow years and they stayed for Manning."
DenverBroncos,331ok3,codepoet2,-1,Sat Apr 18 17:46:54 2015 UTC,"Sorry, missed the point of the topic. I think Brock is ready. He can absolutely be a Flacco type of QB...he's not changing the game every week, but he's absolutely a Starting QB in the league."

DenverBroncos,32xczv,sirnubnub,16,Sat Apr 18 01:52:03 2015 UTC,Ryan Clark has sickle-cell so it hits him a lot harder. He could literally die from playing here.
DenverBroncos,32xczv,HSChronic,4,Fri Apr 17 17:37:10 2015 UTC,Wow I didn't know people with sickle-cell were so affected by altitude. Some bright light in a shitty day on reddit.
DenverBroncos,32xczv,slabsquathrust,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:01:21 2015 UTC,"Sickle cell is caused by a single mutation in the hemoglobin protein.  The same mutation that causes the hemoglobin molecules to clump up and give the red blood cells their characteristic shape, also lowers the binding efficiency for oxygen.  At places where the oxygen is already more scarce, this can have a major deleterious impact."

DenverBroncos,32z13x,crueg,2,Fri Apr 17 22:24:10 2015 UTC,I can't see taking Ogbeuhi with the 28th pick.  As you mentioned he has lower than average build on his frame which is going to be compounded by coming off of a late season knee injury.  S&C can only do so much immediately.  If we trade back or he somehow drops to our 2nd round pick he would be a great pickup.
DenverBroncos,32z13x,therealdudditz,3,Sat Apr 18 01:46:19 2015 UTC,"He'd be a real risk at 28, agreed. I think Elway and company select elsewhere."
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,gordianus1,14,Fri Apr 17 19:09:26 2015 UTC,I get more excited every season. I'm just as confident in this team than the last four teams.
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,MasonL52,8,Fri Apr 17 20:02:54 2015 UTC,"Yes, because last year I was excited about what we did with the defense, but it can take a while for a unit to gel and know where the others will be at all times, now they've had that extra year without many changes. We've switched to a 3-4, which I love, and Von's pass rushing abilities should thrive in it.  On the offensive side of the ball, Kubiak said he will still run a Peyton Manning offense, but you know we'll put in a zone blocking scheme and roll with 2 or 3 rbs. I still think this is Montee Ball's breakout year, but he'll have to take it away from CJ. I'm excited to see Latimer get some real snaps.  Plus Kubiak isn't afraid to get risky, whereas Fox was timid.  It's like having a Nissan GTR body for an offense, but your coach wants to put a Nissan Versa engine under the hood."
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,TheClayroo,4,Fri Apr 17 20:17:11 2015 UTC,"Hell yes! I love John Fox, don't get me wrong, but I think he's better fit for a GM than a head coach. He has the ability to pick obscure players and turn them into dominating players. He's done it with every team.  But, he lacks emotion that Kubes has. Now that we have obscure players that are now league elites and we have an emotional coach that players are willing to bleed for, I can't wait! Plus, you got Wade Phillip's as DC! HOW COULD YOU NOT BE EXCITED!?"

DenverBroncos,32ye1p,i_am_not_sam,2,Fri Apr 17 23:38:55 2015 UTC,I'm with you. I'm having a hard time getting excited about this year. I guess we'll see how the first few games go. That will give us a better idea what the new Kubiak-style Broncos look like. It remains to be seen if this mix of coaches and players will work well.
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,johninbigd,2,Fri Apr 17 22:24:53 2015 UTC,First few games are probably going to be rough because of the adaptation of new systems all around.
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,CO_Boiler,1 point,Fri Apr 17 23:32:01 2015 UTC,"Yeah, true. Kind of the like the first three or four games in Manning's first year here. Those were not that great, but they rapidly improved after that."

So let's say my expectations have just been somewhat tempered."
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,NSA_Operative,2,Fri Apr 17 20:15:19 2015 UTC,I'm very excited only because there is less pressure to win it all this year. It's relaxing.

DenverBroncos,32ye1p,captainduck2,1 point,Sat Apr 18 16:33:39 2015 UTC,"I definitely am. Just got my #18 jersey last year so I'm really psyched that Peyton will be playing with us again. I was a little nervous about Kubiak at first but I think his history with Elway and the Broncos will be a huge factor in bringing the team together and getting us to a championship.  I think the new coaching staff was a necessary change - it felt like we were just going through the motions last year... Getting some fresh faces to fine tune the playbook and work with all of the talent we have on offense and defense is exciting in itself. It will keep our opponents guessing and hopefully reinvigorate and motivate our guys.  There's a chance we could see some growing pains early in the season, but overall I'm feeling pretty confident in our chances this year. Everyone seems to be expecting us to regress significantly, but I think we're going to prove them all wrong!"
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,unclever,1 point,Fri Apr 17 20:40:32 2015 UTC,"There's a hell of a lot of change, and it makes me very excited. Especially with the defense, I think Wade is really going to get the most out of our personnel and we'll see a much better D from last year, and that's saying a lot because our D wasn't bad last year either."

DenverBroncos,32ye1p,Lough5280,1 point,Fri Apr 17 22:16:05 2015 UTC,I was really excited last season given that defensive additions. I thought this team could get away with pure talent even if the coaching was just average. I was most certainly wrong.   I am excited with this new coaching stuff especially with Wade Phillips coming in as DC. Kubiak is an awesome OC but his track record as a head coach isn't really all that great. I hope his issue was having Matt Schaub at QB but we'll see.
DenverBroncos,32ye1p,Aldeberon,1 point,Sat Apr 18 00:00:42 2015 UTC,"Not yet.  I think I'll get more excited after the draft, and especially after we get to see the team play in preseason and the first few games.

I am still excited, don't get me wrong, but I was more excited the last few years.  I am pretty much resigned to winning the division and maybe 1 playoff win as our most likely outcome, with an outside chance of winning it all.  I ain't mad at that.  If CJ Anderson comes out like Terrell Davis 2.0, then I'll be more excited than those years and my expectations will adjust accordingly."

DenverBroncos,32vn88,ThreezusManning,5,Fri Apr 17 03:40:59 2015 UTC,"like i said in your last post, i love this stadium... its a welders dream. i was fortunate during one of my jobs there i got to watch them rip out the old field, sow it up and watch it grow.  its an amazing feat, one they do every three years.  the field is heated and covered with a plastic like sheet that really expedites the rate of growth, the grounds crew carry a lot of weight around there.  and they are serious about you not getting on the grass.    my favorite part, however, is far above the field.  climbing the ladder to the cat walks up top that hold the lighting and infrastructure (why i was up there) for the wifi/4g system, is an amazing experiance.  and getting to be up there, climbing on top of the lighting structure was intense.  seeing all of denver and the completely stadium is a view not many get, and i feel very fortunate to have been given the opportunity to weld all over sports authority/invesco/mile high.  now i need to get me some C-link hours logged."
DenverBroncos,32vn88,1summitash,3,Fri Apr 17 03:47:00 2015 UTC,Damn... that's awesome. Is that the coolest place you've ever worked on or have you worked on other stadiums and such?
DenverBroncos,32vn88,ThreezusManning,2,Fri Apr 17 04:27:39 2015 UTC,"i got to work at a number of high rise building around dever, a few up on the roof but mainly in boiler and machine rooms. all of those were cool in their own way.  but i definitely brag the most about the broncos stadium and logged the most hours (outside of the shop) there than anywhere else.  also, the job up on top of the catwalk where i climbed the ladder and ate lunch in the jumbotrons was my first official job as a welder so i am a bit nostalgic.  i didnt take many photos.  but one of my firsts post to reddit was the ones from that job."

DenverBroncos,32vn88,Mister_Jay_Peg,1 point,Fri Apr 17 05:17:48 2015 UTC,"i cant give you a definitive answer, i wasnt there to watch the grass grow.  but if i remember correctly.  the actual field of play was 100% ripped out and regrown while the outer perimeter was not redone.  as far as i could tell there was no artificial turf in sight."
DenverBroncos,32vn88,soundman1024,2,Fri Apr 17 05:25:51 2015 UTC,"I can help out a bit, I worked there when it opened and trained gameday security staff for the first two seasons.  The grass itself was real, but every 1/4 or 1/2 inch (forget the exact) fibers were woven into, under and through the surface, so that the more sandy soil didn't slide as much, and divots didn't happen. I don't think they ever did a wholesale rip/replace, but they did re-stitch a few times.  Problem with this system is you could never re-sod, since the entire field was stitched together, you could only re-seed, which is why the field looked so bad last season (it was actually in great shape, it just looked like shit).  With this new setup, they can rip, resod and root down new field sections in about 10 days."

Hopefully during the offseason we'll be able to sneak a peek. It's kind of weird the power/access dynamics in the stadium. Seems like it's Team Staff > NFL Staff > Away Team Staff > Contracted Staff (Concessions, Security, etc.)  Though I have seen other people who have had a don't care attitude and do whatever they want. I don't have the fortitude to push any boundaries, which is probably for the best."
DenverBroncos,32vn88,ThreezusManning,1 point,Fri Apr 24 18:40:32 2015 UTC,"That sounds about right, yeah. The daily contracted who worked out of the stadium for us with CSC, Epicurian and Aramark were allowed access to most areas, but field and any of the rooms in the southern half on ground level were strictly off-limits. For my company, I was allowed up in the stadium itself so I could make sure the turnstiles were charged and stuff like that, and in time I got to know stadiul staff well enough I could walk around up there pretty much whenever, as long as it was in the main bowls on 1 and 5.  One thing I did love that they let me do was eat lunch sitting in the stands. I would go up to the South Stands and hang out for the hour  just soaking it in.  But it has been over a decade since I left thay company, so I have no idea if they've tightened the screws on stuff like that."
DenverBroncos,32vn88,Mister_Jay_Peg,2,Fri Apr 24 19:11:43 2015 UTC,"Yea. Overall things are pretty tight, but either the security training or the communication is too strict and/or too poor. Because there are so many different types of passes, I have had minor issues, and have seen others stopped for periods dealing with different uninformed security. I realize it's probably for the best, but it can sometimes impede the job you're doing especially when you're loving from one side of the stadium to the other.   I don't have locker room access and so anything involved with that area I need a team escort which can be difficult because people have their own jobs to do. And most security personnel don't have locker room access either."

I'd walked past it's doors on Lev4 a ton on gamedays when I worked there, and I'd walked past the private elevator on ground level daily going between parking on southside and office on northside, but I'd never actually seen inside.  It was as close to nirvana as I could get without actually stepping on the field. (Three years, never set foot.)"
DenverBroncos,32vn88,sman2002,2,Fri Apr 17 06:48:44 2015 UTC,"I think I'd feel the same way. And to think, there's probably a another level of intensity when the stadium is full of people going wild. Having a birds eye view of everything going on would be amazing."

DenverBroncos,32urvr,PMeist,0,Fri Apr 17 11:24:42 2015 UTC,"First off, D-Ware aint a LB. And secondly, our LB core is one of our weakest links. We have three great players, but if even one of them goes down, our backups are shit. And none of our LB's can cover a fucking Tight End."
DenverBroncos,32urvr,drax117,1 point,Mon Apr 20 09:31:54 2015 UTC,"Yes D-Ware is.  -espn showing him in our depth charts as left outside linebacker. http://espn.go.com/nfl/team/depth/_/name/den/formation/3-4-defense  -his personal bio on his own site has himself listed as outside linebacker http://www.demarcusware94.com/bio.html  He's playing linebacker in our system, which for him will be nothing more than a standup pass rusher most of the plays he is on the field.  And I agree, if any of them go down we're kind of screwed. Our depth at LB is poor while our starters is actually one of our strengths and best qualities. If you add DWare to our LB core, which is where he will play, then we will no doubt have one of the best LB core's in the nfl.  Edit: Where I'm most worried is offensive and defensive line. I'm not sold on Wolfe and Malik like a lot of other Bronco redditors I've seen. I've just not seen them play well and I am very worried about us HAVING to rely on Sly playing well. That's a lot to ask of him for having not played much. And don't even get me started about how scared I am for our oline even considering we have one of the best oline coaches in the nfl in Kubes."
DenverBroncos,32vlz3,crueg,2,Fri Apr 17 02:06:04 2015 UTC,"We have a pretty brutal schedule this year, and our own division is improving.   For a while I was actually excited about the Raiders being above average, but they fucked up in FA, so fuck those fucks."
DenverBroncos,32vlz3,Puffy_Ghost,2,Fri Apr 17 18:04:26 2015 UTC,"As a chargers fan, I think anyone would be dumb not to rank you first with how you've dominated the division the last few years. That being said, I don't think it's a lock that you'll win it again this year, as I've seen this sentiment expressed quite a bit. Both us (assuming we keep Rivers) and the Chiefs are primed to overtake you should any aspect of your team falter. Not saying that you will, but just that it will be a tighter division this year for sure."
DenverBroncos,32vlz3,vandelays,2,Fri Apr 17 05:14:29 2015 UTC,"Oh absolutely, I don't think it'll be Denver going 15-1 while the rest of the division sits at 5-11. you guys and the chiefs will definitely make it competitive, but if you've been reading around /r/nfl there's a lot of ""broncos won't make the playoffs"" posts"

DenverBroncos,32u8ib,Quiggibub,1 point,Thu Apr 16 21:57:54 2015 UTC,I'd like to see Brock have to compete for the back up position just to give him something to do while Manning refuses to let him play any downs in games that are already determined.
DenverBroncos,32u8ib,Puffy_Ghost,2,Thu Apr 16 21:06:51 2015 UTC,"I'm guessing you got downvoted because everyone in this sub is really high on Lobster.  But you're right, he should have to earn that position of being #2. Not that I think he'd lose it, but completion is always good for keeping your talent on its toes."
DenverBroncos,32u8ib,skullyD,12,Fri Apr 17 03:58:32 2015 UTC,"LG/C/RT, Nose Tackle, and FS are the only ones I can really think of....  Probably PR and KR as well."
DenverBroncos,32u8ib,powersty,1 point,Thu Apr 16 19:36:25 2015 UTC,"I think this covers all of them. There will be battling for snaps at the 2nd spots on the depth chart in the linebacking corp I think, especially if we throw another viable rookie into the mix. I really hope we see more out of Johnson, McCray, and Barrow."
DenverBroncos,32u8ib,PoopLion,7,Fri Apr 17 20:16:10 2015 UTC,Our thirteen TEs will have to fight pretty hard to make the roster.
DenverBroncos,32u8ib,LaGoku,5,Thu Apr 16 21:43:07 2015 UTC,"Every OL position besides LT and RG  Possibly FS (if they move Webster there) if they move Roby there like they've talked about than he'll probably win it out right. Then there could be a battle for the safety spot for when Roby moves to nickel.  NT the snaps will probably be split a lot between Sly/Austin, unless Sly's conditioning gets better and he improves against the run. Probably Austin more in base and Sly more in nickel.  There will be a ""battle"" at RB but Anderson will probably win it. He's just too complete of a back (running, blocking, and receiving) to lose it."
DenverBroncos,32qzm8,ThreezusManning,11,Thu Apr 16 00:33:28 2015 UTC,"I think one of the most respectable things about Champ was how he ""celebrated."" He never got in the receiver's face or talked shit. When the play was over he just walked off the field and got ready for the next one."
DenverBroncos,32qzm8,fuck_those_raiders,6,Thu Apr 16 02:43:57 2015 UTC,That's one of the things I liked about Moreno. Just let their teammates congratulate them and focused on the next play. Pretty rare to see.

DenverBroncos,32qzm8,fliptrikster,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:39:53 2015 UTC,Haha true... but all of his highlight videos are surprisingly terrible. Either have the grainiest footage imaginable or just show him diving for interceptions.

DenverBroncos,32qzm8,JoshuaCain,3,Thu Apr 16 01:17:02 2015 UTC,Portis for Champ was an absolutely amazing trade. I was so sad at the time is happened. Then I saw Champ play and I completely forgot who Clinton Portis was.
DenverBroncos,32qzm8,Brostash,2,Thu Apr 16 17:02:33 2015 UTC,Man I miss Champ. Arguably the best corner of all time. Bummed he didnt get a ring. I always thoughy he would get a shot at safety before retiring.

DenverBroncos,32qach,skullyD,5,Wed Apr 15 22:03:37 2015 UTC,"Agreed, 2013 season was easily his worst season and that was because he bulked up for no reason."

DenverBroncos,32qach,thereandbackagain7,2,Thu Apr 16 01:15:50 2015 UTC,So true but Von still posted 5 sacks in 9 games that year (suspension + knee injury) Most guys make a career off that sack/game pace.
DenverBroncos,32qach,thereandbackagain7,2,Thu Apr 16 16:32:56 2015 UTC,"He wasn't getting nearly the same amount of pressure that he normally got per game. If I recall, our rush defense also got much worse when he came in and Nate Irving made it better.   He was a force in the Patriots and Redskins game, but for the most part that was a season he would like to forget."

DenverBroncos,32qach,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Fri Apr 17 01:01:51 2015 UTC,"This is the silver-lining I'm hoping for.  I think the only way this team wins a Superbowl is if the Defense shows up big time all season long.  In Wade, we trust!  PFM's offense has been ""figured out"", and Peyton doesn't like change.  If they are going to have any success, Offensively, PFM is gonna have to use the running game more and move away from hurry-hurry.  Or figure a way to combine hurry-hurry with a running game effectively.  There is a reason all of PFM's backups his whole career have never been good.  Because the only person who can run hurry-hurry is PFM.   Brock can't do it.  Curtis Painter couldn't do it.  Jim Sorgi, Karry Collins, etc.  I think Brock can be really good, just not in the hurry-hurry system."
DenverBroncos,32qach,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Fri Apr 17 18:47:14 2015 UTC,He said that last year too. Here's to hoping his prognostication is a bit better in 2015.

I basically made all of my money back in just a couple of cards. It was pretty obvious that the set hadn't been sorted through. Maybe someone died of an angry ex decided to get rid of the collection? Most of the cards are from the '88-'93 seasons, which were right before I was born, funnily enough. I could always go through and show off the rest of the Broncos cards I've found in my collection if there's any demand for that. I hope this post doesn't break any of this subreddit's rules.

DenverBroncos,32pg6g,Freyaka,14,Wed Apr 15 17:36:35 2015 UTC,"Curious, if you can't handle people not liking your redesign, why do it? I don't hate it but I don't love it either. I don't care for the white stripe on the helmet, nor the 5280 on the legs, and I don't think the blue and white shoulder stripes work the greatest. Sure I appreciate that you filled someone's request and it was a valid thought, but if people don't like it, they don't like it, and if you don't want people to share their opinion, don't post it. Sorry but that is kinda how reddit works."
DenverBroncos,32pg6g,Greeney494,-17,Wed Apr 15 18:29:00 2015 UTC,"Some one in your sub requested it. I was at 19% in 3 minutes for posting a concept jersey. Ya, I was little fucking pissed off."
DenverBroncos,32pg6g,CO_Boiler,4,Wed Apr 15 18:42:56 2015 UTC,"To be honest, it's the orange on orange that's the issue. You give it white pants and that's probably a decent jersey...With orange pants it's a traffic cone."
DenverBroncos,32pg6g,CO_Boiler,8,Wed Apr 15 22:31:43 2015 UTC,So one person requested it. Not the whole sub. There's why you're at 19%

DenverBroncos,32pg6g,Neverethe,-15,Wed Apr 15 18:55:36 2015 UTC,"I mean dude, the whole thing took north of an hour. I was pissed because it felt like an hour wasted because normally posts are deleted after a threshhold of downvotes is reached and I was like one away.  If you don't like it, more power to you, but why feel the need to downvote it and not let other people with different opinions than you see it?"
DenverBroncos,32pg6g,aatencio91,9,Wed Apr 15 19:01:27 2015 UTC,"You already had a Browns concept done, you changed the colors, and used a helmet design that's already been on here, and added 5280 on the legs. Idk what to tell you other than don't bother if you are going to get pissed when people don't like it.   In reality everything on here is a waste of time, it provides absolutely nothing productive for society. It's how it is and nobody should be upset about it. Sorry you are, but I don't know what to tell you..."

DenverBroncos,32pg6g,aatencio91,8,Wed Apr 15 19:44:29 2015 UTC,"Lol I think you are missing the point of votes. Up means you like it, down means you don't. You can't get one without the other. Get over it. I'm sorry you are mad but if your happiness is dependent upon votes on the internet I am really sorry. This make me sound like the dick but you're complaining about the time that you wasted anyway to get approval over the time wasted from people who are wasting time on the internet. Drop it."

Some people were even hesitant to go back to the orange.  There is a large contingency that wants to go back to the late 90's-early 2000's blue jerseys. I mean if you want to look like 3/4 of the league with your blue primary jerseys, fine. Just let me keep my orange."

DenverBroncos,32pg6g,Smaskifa,2,Wed Apr 15 19:05:34 2015 UTC,"Eh. Give me the all blues every day of the week and twice on Sundays. No one looks like that in the league, and Cleveland just made orange their primary so it's not like that's unique anymore either.   I still maintain the oranges are cursed. Brunell's TD pass, Flacco's TD pass, the Super Bowl ass whoopings, and the Colts this year.  Yes, I know curses aren't real. Maybe there is some sort of psychological effect with orange. Kind of like how pink is known to reduce aggression. Maybe orange subconsciously makes our boys soft.   Serious question: have we ever lost wearing the all midnight blues? My earliest recollection of them is MNF in 06 against Baltimore (win) and then when we wore them throughout the Tebow era (all wins IIRC) and as alts with Manning (all wins @ Dallas and vs SF)"

As much as FTR goes around in this sub, I think I hate the chargers more because they've been more of a thorn in our side over the past decade over the raiders, especially with the rivers v cutler rivalry that was going on, made me hate that fucker even more."
DenverBroncos,32pmfh,Smaskifa,8,Wed Apr 15 18:31:30 2015 UTC,"Chargers have been pretty consistently good for 10+ years it seems. They even beat Denver at Mile High in 2013. Raiders...remember when they had Bo Jackson and Marcus Allen? It's been so long since they were good, it's hard to maintain the hate."
DenverBroncos,32pmfh,AlpineSummit,7,Wed Apr 15 19:16:29 2015 UTC,"Completely agree about the sibling rivalry with the Chiefs. They are usually fun to compete with and they have a great atmosphere at that stadium. The california teams have no atmosphere at their stadiums and just seem to be fizzling out, in terms of a fan base.  That Broncos Chiefs play off game during the first superbowl is one of the games I remember most. Beating them in KC. In the playoffs was amazing. I love to hate KC."
DenverBroncos,32pmfh,leechsucka,3,Wed Apr 15 20:25:43 2015 UTC,"My sentiments exactly.    Hate the Chargers most because they've been good competition lately with a good QB who acts like a whiny bitch at times.    Hate the Raiders second due to their thuggish persona, third class franchise and fans who love them only to show how gangsta they are.    Cheifs are definitely more like a sibling rivalry.  I've had good times with Cheif fans at Mile High."
DenverBroncos,32pmfh,bcos4life,2,Thu Apr 16 03:11:09 2015 UTC,"Honestly, my hate for the Chargers is COMPLETELY on their fans.  During their run in the 2000's, they were horrifying to listen to. You would have thought they had won 3 straight SB's. So damn cocky...  I knew one that always said that Rivers was ALREADY better than Elway during that time. Whenever I brought up SB's, I got the ""THEN I GUESS DILFER IS BETTER THAN MARINO!!!"" No, Dilfer isn't, but to act like SB wins don't have any weight is silly. They aren't the only barometer, but they are a part of it.   I will always have hatred for the Raiders. It's ingrained in my soul. People keep saying ""I hope they get better, so the rivalry is fun agian.""... SCREW THAT! I hope they suck forever.   Chiefs are fine... I guess. Fans can be arrogant for some reason... not that we aren't."

That I can answer, I hate em all, but there are tiers.   Because while I generally wish bad things upon them, I would say my hatred of the Chiefs burns lowest of the three. It's a smoldering kind of hate. Those fucking Chargers on the other hand... White hot kind of hatred, a burning rage, blazing fire of hate. Fuck them, fuck them all to hell.   To continue the metaphor the Raider hate is a constant steady thing. A crackling fire on the hearth. Keeps the soul ever warm, never waning."

BUT  When the Raiders were last good (Rich Gannon/Jerry Rice/Tim Brown/The Woodsons etc.) they were easily our most hated rivals.  They had that one game where Gannon completed some ridiculous amount of consecutive completions and I just could not fucking stand them.  I would love for the Raiders to be competitive again to get back to that rivalry because it gets pretty emotional.  We've had our way with the Chiefs for the past few years but when they were running hot with Trent Green and Priest Holmes, that was also a pretty intense rivalry.  That game Clinton Portis put up 5 TDs and a championship belt on their asses :)"
DenverBroncos,32pmfh,rainbow_party,1 point,Thu Apr 16 05:42:30 2015 UTC,"I feel like the Broncos biggest intra-division rival is the Chiefs. That's probably because I watched a lot of 90s Broncos when going to Arrowhead was always an important game with an unexpected outcome.  For similar reasons, I feel like the Chargers are the least rivalrous team. However, they have been the best team of the three for the past ten years, so people who started watching in 2003/2004 probably feel like the biggest division games are with San Diego."

Also Philip Rivers is such a little whiny douche every time he plays against us.  Most: Definitely the Chiefs, most of my family are Chief fans so its fun for me to smack talk every year we win the division. Those games against Priest Holmes and Dante Hall we classics because Arrowhead was always rocking. Chiefs now have the most likable players on their team (i.e Charles, Berry, Houston, Maclin) plus how can you hate Andy Reid."

I probably don't know too much about the Raiders rivalry and hatred since I started watching in 1996 and 1997 time frame. Aside from the massive blowout loss to them in 2010, they have not done too much to us. They have been irrelevant for so long. A lot of their fans are annoying but I can't even blame them when they have sucked for so long.   I hate the Chargers the most. It is because they always choke in the post-season and I use to cheer for them in the post-season cause I liked their players like Tomlinson, Gates, and I actually like Rivers. They just always disappoint. Their fans are not even existent in actual games since they had to use a silent count in their own stadium against New England last season. Their fans on the internet are annoying though.   I like the Chiefs the most, since they don't do anything ridiculous. They have pretty classy fans from what I have seen. They have a pretty likeable team too. I am a fan of Houston, Charles, and Berry (Get well soon!)"

DenverBroncos,32ojdx,Blacky31,2,Wed Apr 15 13:32:21 2015 UTC,Why are Jackson and Wolfe better suited for the 3-4? I like Wolfe and I've seen him make some plays for us in the past. But I've only ever heard from Big Al on 104.3 that Jackson is a good player. I've never seen him make plays or really be on the field. What made him so good last year according to Big Al and what will make him better this year.
DenverBroncos,32ojdx,BlindManBaldwin,5,Wed Apr 15 22:41:11 2015 UTC,"Denver doesn't need a prototypical nose tackle because it isn't a prototypical 3-4  As for the rest of the line Wolfe and Jackson is as far from uncertain as it gets, and Smith and Walker are very good rotational players  which one is better largely depends on the health of Manning and how well the OL plays."

DenverBroncos,32ojdx,von_bot,4,Wed Apr 15 14:50:10 2015 UTC,"Honestly... BOTH will be better.  Offense - Because Kubiak and the ZBS.  The OL is shaky right now sure, but we'll draft up some studs there, and by let's say Game 4 of the regular season they should be gelled into a pretty damn solid unit to protect CJ and Peyton.  CJ's going to go for 2K this year.  Defense - Because NOT Del Rio, so more blitzing!  Von & Ware are gonna tear shit up this year.  TJ Ward is going to have freedom to do his thing.  The DT(NT) spot may be our weakness, that will live and die with Sly, but I believe he can do it."

DenverBroncos,32ojdx,Sienna_Crush,2,Wed Apr 15 21:57:38 2015 UTC,"The offense will be better than the defense but both will take a step back this year. Peyton is old and not mobile, which will cause problems early in the season given the switch to a zone blocking scheme. That however should get fixed in the first quarter of the season. Problem with the defense is we're weak up the middle we don't have a two gap DT and no thumper at LB. The FS spot is has nobody with range so T.J. can't come down into the box. I think other teams will be able to run on us this year. I think affects the pass rush which affects the secondary. I hope I'm wrong."
DenverBroncos,32ojdx,bmsuperfly,1 point,Wed Apr 15 15:38:03 2015 UTC,"Good analysis, even though I dont agree that both will be worse. You make good points and add to the discussion. I think the defense performed at or below their potential last. This year a few talented players are gone but if Wade can make good use of all the great players on that defense they could easily be better. This is the most talented defense he's ever had and the pieces are there for a 3-4. Offensively it all hinges on Manning. If he is anywhere near his early 2014 self we should have a much better offense. Like you said he's not mobile, so being that Kubiak isn't an idiot I doubt he will be asking him to do many if any rollouts. Manning is a master of playaction even though he isn't fast. The offensive line has work to do but it's a huge priority to the team and they have good peices to work with. Especially if we draft a OT in the 1st. Overall I think thinking of them being better or worse just depends on which side of the unknown you choose."
DenverBroncos,32ojdx,crueg,2,Fri Apr 17 18:19:41 2015 UTC,"Defense. Such a talented side of the ball there is a hole at FS, but it's not horrible and I think Sly could breakout a bit more. I feel like Jackson is going to have a big year in Wade's defense.   The offense will be more balanced and probably better suited for the post season, but the O line is in too many shambles right now to know."

DenverBroncos,32m48x,Bwardrop,2,Wed Apr 15 13:50:02 2015 UTC,"I'm in Washington. We use hueys for most water drops, they can hold a 250gal bucket.  The K-Max can hold a 500gal bucket, we have only a couple of those and if we need more we borrow them from the feds.    We also use AC-10s (I think)  and 737s for retardant drops, but the fire would have to be actively burning near houses to get those out as they cost more than 20k an hour.    Edit: we also have a few cobras, and they do have IR sensors mounted on the front.  They occasionally get buckets hooked up for water drops, but they're so narrow they tend to get blown around a lot while carrying weight."

She worked as a nurse for the Flight for Life helicopter fleet that rescued people from the Rockies. She arranged for a private flight for me. The pilot flew right into Mile High Stadium. My mind has since embellished the moment to include landing on the field, but I'm pretty sure that would not have been allowed, even then."

DenverBroncos,32piha,skullyD,2,Wed Apr 15 18:23:05 2015 UTC,He's going to get franchised tagged. Which is a 1 year deal that takes the average annual salaries of the top X amount of players in the NFL at that position and that's what you get for the year. Franchise tag sucks.
DenverBroncos,32piha,rileysill32,1 point,Thu Apr 16 00:33:34 2015 UTC,I know they already have that planned but that wasn't the issue there was some other discrepancy with the contract they had to work out.
DenverBroncos,32piha,rileysill32,2,Thu Apr 16 01:54:30 2015 UTC,I'll ask and find out for you then. :)
DenverBroncos,32piha,CO_Boiler,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:13:53 2015 UTC,"How does that tag suck other than it only being one year? It's the average of the top 5 salaries at that position, and that's pretty much where DT sits, so I'm just confused."
DenverBroncos,32piha,rileysill32,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:07:19 2015 UTC,It sucks because he deserves a 50 or 60 million dollar contract so he can go to work. What if he gets hurt on a franchise tag? He would be screwed. There are no payout clauses like in some contracts. In the NFL every players goal in the league is just make it to your second contract. Make a big second contract and that's truly when you have made it. When you don't have your second contract. You haven't made it yet and you're still fighting to get the big contract you deserve.
DenverBroncos,32piha,CO_Boiler,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:12:47 2015 UTC,"See I don't think athletes deserve 50-60 million or more, it's entertainment and provides nothing else for anybody. 12.8 million... He can live very comfortably for the rest of his life if he got hurt. And if he somehow couldn't, God forbid he use the free college education he got. And he was offered a contract worth that much and he turned it down. So no it doesn't suck for him because it's his choice and athletes are hugely overpaid anyway."
DenverBroncos,32piha,rileysill32,1 point,Fri Apr 17 00:40:12 2015 UTC,Everyone is entitled to their opinion.
DenverBroncos,32piha,sleepydogg,2,Fri Apr 17 00:54:33 2015 UTC,"My guess is he and Dez Bryant are both kind of waiting to see who will sign first and set the market. Also, they may have just tabled discussions until after the draft, or until OTAs/training camp.  I'm not overly worried about it."
DenverBroncos,32piha,SonicSC,1 point,Thu Apr 16 03:48:31 2015 UTC,"One thing I keep hearing is that the last 2 players the Broncos tagged went to the last day before signing, so we shouldn't be worried about DT. Presuming, of course, that there won't be a fax machine involved."

DenverBroncos,32klnq,jonsconspiracy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 16:49:02 2015 UTC,I'll post some more later today.
DenverBroncos,32klnq,codfos,2,Tue Apr 14 17:27:52 2015 UTC,I wish the Rapids were good enough and popular enough to fill it up. Like the Sounders do in Seattle.
DenverBroncos,32klnq,jonsconspiracy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:02:02 2015 UTC,They used to play there. I think the Kroenke empire wanted an outdoor facility of their own so they wouldn't have to pay rent or have scheduling conflicts come MLS playoffs.   I went to quite a few 4th of July games Mile High back before Dicks Park existed and they were always packed.
DenverBroncos,32klnq,CO_Boiler,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:08:23 2015 UTC,"Do they ever play there for big events, like the 4th of July?? I would think the ticket sales would offset the rent, if they really could fill it up.   I live in NYC these days, so I haven't been to a Rapids game, but I'm still loyal to all my hometown Colorado teams."
DenverBroncos,32klnq,jonsconspiracy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 22:46:34 2015 UTC,That would be a waste since they built that entire complex basically just for the Rapids. Even the national team played there instead of Sports Authority.
DenverBroncos,32klnq,CO_Boiler,1 point,Tue Apr 14 19:47:13 2015 UTC,Oh I know.  But they only really built that complex because it's embarrassing to play in a mostly empty stadium. If they could fill up Mile High then they never would have built that.
DenverBroncos,32klnq,jonsconspiracy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 20:57:11 2015 UTC,I don't think so really. I don't think any of the lacrosse teams fill the stadium do they? I think they just wanted their own. They were going to no matter what because of also being practice facilities
DenverBroncos,32klnq,CO_Boiler,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:01:17 2015 UTC,"The Rapids are a soccer team... and yes, many MLS teams fill up stadiums. Orlando sold out their home opener with 61k seats. Seattle regularly sells 30 to 40k seats. I think average attendance across MLS is in the 15 to 20k  range. Which is about half an NFL stadium."
DenverBroncos,32klnq,jonsconspiracy,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:05:30 2015 UTC,"I know the Rapids are a soccer team... The Outlaws are a lacrosse team that plays at mile high... See the connection I'm making between the two? Attendance is too low, they have to cut the grass shorter which is harder on the grass, and the Rapids needed practice facilities anyway."
DenverBroncos,32klnq,1summitash,1 point,Tue Apr 14 21:21:08 2015 UTC,Yep. All true. All I'm saying is that IF they could fill up Mile High... then that would make an awesome game environment and it would give that empty field we're looking at something to do in the offseason. Just a daydreaming soccer fan here.

There were only 16 teams teams in 1969 so a Super Bowl championship against 15 other teams should weigh less than one against 31 other.  I would have also included negative points for teams that finished seasons sub .500.  The Broncos consistency should be rewarded and the Raiders should be penalized.

DenverBroncos,32h4i1,TooShortIsMyFather,6,Mon Apr 13 21:04:41 2015 UTC,Yeah not sure some people realize just how much slot work Emmanuel had last season. I think this will work out just fine
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,troubledhumans,12,Mon Apr 13 21:57:54 2015 UTC,I loved him being on the Outside. His ability to stretch the Defense is one of his best attributes.
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,Greeney494,6,Mon Apr 13 19:31:22 2015 UTC,"At least now we will get to see Latimer on the outside where I think he [Latimer] can thrive, especially in run blocking.  Maybe in the Slot, Hemannuel could get some more favorable matchups."
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,s460,4,Mon Apr 13 19:36:02 2015 UTC,"Which is why him stretching the field on the inside is still incredibly valuable. Pushes safeties back, opens up crossing routes for the outside guys and of course opens inside running game too."

So when we do it is Hemanuel, DT, or Latimer in the slot. Hemanuel is the best fit since the other two are not as equipped for the slot. It's not a perfect fit but it will still be enough for any defense to struggle with."
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,SuburbanHell,7,Mon Apr 13 20:12:13 2015 UTC,"Honestly I kind of hate this.  He's going to get killed, and his speed made him killer on the outside for the deep ball... Silver lining, I guess at least this way we can finally see what we have in Latimer."
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,Coos-Coos,15,Mon Apr 13 19:53:24 2015 UTC,"playing slot doesn't mean you have to run slants and digs all game. Slot receivers can still be used to stretch the field vertically. He already played it a lot last year, putting him in the slot gives him a free release for those posts and flys. He's a better fit there than Latimer and Thomas."
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,yamaha2k11,4,Mon Apr 13 21:06:54 2015 UTC,"Ok good, I just didn't want to see him end up like Welker."
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,dragonbear,4,Mon Apr 13 21:13:29 2015 UTC,Welker's problem is his size. Most people are hitting him at head level.

DenverBroncos,32h4i1,CO_Boiler,2,Tue Apr 14 10:05:07 2015 UTC,"Well, on the plus side (I try to always look on the +) we likely won't be running 3 and 4 wide a lot and if he is in the slot, he likely won't be playing a Welker-type role in the slot."
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,CO_Boiler,2,Mon Apr 13 19:57:20 2015 UTC,"Gonna miss seeing scrawny little Wes Welker in the slot :(  However, he's the best fit for the slot, and I think Latimer and DT on the outside will work out fantastic.   God I'm just itching to see Latimer, he style of play is a lot more physical than DT (no knock against DT) and his aggressive nature will complement DT and Sanders across the slot so nicely."

DenverBroncos,32h4i1,CO_Boiler,1 point,Mon Apr 13 19:29:27 2015 UTC,What was the other option? Caldwell? I'll pass on that. Quick guys belong in the slot and nobody is quicker on this team than Sanders.
DenverBroncos,32h4i1,welker_skelter,1 point,Mon Apr 13 22:56:28 2015 UTC,"Other option is Latimer in the slot. And in a lot of ways it would make sense. Sanders showed he could get open on the outside so that's not a problem. Then you have Latimer who is bigger and stronger than ES and would be a matchup nightmare, since slot corners are usually not very big. Plus Latimer is supposed to be, and from everything I've seen is, a fantastic blocker, which would make running it out of 3 wide that much more deadly. He could pretty much be a second TE out there, but a TE that can run 4.3..."

DenverBroncos,32gfxy,SuburbanHell,14,Mon Apr 13 16:24:54 2015 UTC,"Roster needs  Biggest need: Right tackle -- Louis Vasquez moved from guard to right tackle last year, but he led the team in blown blocks according to Football Outsiders' charting. Michael Schofield, a 2014 third-round pick, should compete for the right tackle job, but drafting a rookie starter would allow the Broncos to return Vasquez to right guard and have Shelley Smith replace the departed Orlando Franklin (Chargers) at left guard.  Quiet need: Tight end -- While Denver added Owen Daniels and re-signed Virgil Green, there's not a long-term receiving option since Julius Thomas left for Jacksonville. Daniels is going on 33 and has not played a full season since 2008. He's missed 27 games due to injury in that time. He could be very active with Wes Welker gone from the slot, which means the Broncos will miss Daniels significantly if he gets injured again.  Not a need: Quarterback -- Whether or not this is Peyton Manning's last season, the Broncos still have 2012 second-round pick Brock Osweiler waiting his turn as the probable successor. Denver should avoid looking into a midround quarterback in the draft.  --Scott Kacsmar, Football Outsiders  Prospect targets  D.J. Humphries, OT, Florida (Day 1):  Humphries' slightly below-average arm length and difficulty staying healthy over the past two seasons are a concern, so I'm not as high on him as some other people. However, his quick feet, balance and upper-body strength make him a perfect fit for new head coach Gary Kubiak's offense, and Humphries can line up on the right side in this scheme.  Damarious Randall, S, Arizona State (Day 2):  Randall is arguably the best cover safety in this class. He has the fluid hips to match up with slot receivers and the range to play center field, so he would be an excellent complement to strong safety T.J. Ward. At 5-foot-11 and 196 pounds, Randall is undersized and thus will never be an in-the-box safety, but he's a tough run defender for his size.  MyCole Pruitt, TE, Southern Illinois (Day 3):  At 6-2 and 251 pounds, Pruitt has the speed to threaten vertically, the burst to produce after the catch, and the long arms and body control to compete for 50-50 balls. He's not a powerful in-line blocker, but he's athletic enough to get into position and wall off his assignment, making him a good fit for Kubiak's scheme.  --Steve Muench, Scouts Inc.  Predictions  1. They still have work to do on offensive line: The Broncos signed guard/center Shelley Smith in free agency and then traded a fourth-round pick in the 2016 draft for center Gino Gradkowski. The Broncos feel good about some of their younger prospects up front, such as tackle Michael Schofield, guard Ben Garland and center Matt Paradis. But the team will look at the big guys in the draft at tackle, guard and center. Three starting jobs are open on the offensive front.  2. There will be a tight end in the draft class: It will be a truly surprising turn of events if, with 10 picks in hand for the draft, the Broncos do not come away with at least one tight end they believe has the makings of a future starter. Also, with the depth of this wide receiver class, it's almost a given that the Broncos will look up and find that the best player left on the board is a wide receiver.  3. Linebacker is on the to-do list: The Broncos had two inside linebackers -- Brandon Marshall (foot) and Danny Trevathan (left leg) -- who were not full speed when the team opened its offseason program on April 13. Also, given the new 3-4 scheme -- plus the fact that DeMarcus Ware turns 33 in July and Von Miller is scheduled to be an unrestricted free agent after the 2015 season -- the edge-rushers on the board will be attractive, especially the first two days.  -- Jeff Legwold, NFL Nation Broncos reporter"

We have traded down though, so it's entirely possible.

DenverBroncos,328pse,HarryOttoman,23,Sat Apr 11 16:18:16 2015 UTC,"Seems like a good signing just for depth.   I suspect Green will play a more pure TE role, Daniels will be a TE/WR like Thomas/Tamme were and Casey will take over Green's role as a TE/FB player. Pure speculation on my part, but that's what seems to fit.   It would not surprise me to see a few sets where Daniels/Green are TE, Casey is in the backfield with a RB and we have a single WR. This would be a prime running situation, but would also work reasonably well for play action since the 3 TEs all can catch.  Edit: apparently he led the league in special team snaps last year. Given the state of our ST that's a good thing too."
DenverBroncos,328pse,nsfy33,1 point,Sat Apr 11 16:41:55 2015 UTC,He's a very solid presence on Special Teams. The Eagles are just stacked at TE (Celek and Ertz) so he never got the playing time as a TE that he could probably get in another system. Definitely a good pick up for you guys.

DenverBroncos,328pse,flynryan692,8,Sat Apr 11 16:27:02 2015 UTC,"Elway makes the final call on all personal decisions, so obviously it isn't just Kubiak who likes these players."

Take the time to look at the names already on our roster, its absolutely stacked, and you'll feel better. We need to build around that and fill holes, and I don't see anything wrong for a coach on a new team to bring in players hes familiar with to help that transition go smoother.   Also, the players he has brought in by no means ""suck"" either. So I don't see his loyalty being a negative thing at all."
DenverBroncos,328pse,bentoboxbarry,3,Sat Apr 11 18:22:10 2015 UTC,"Sure, you're absolutely right, however when the fans of teams he's previously coached comment on him being so loyal to other players that he let them start when they shouldn't be starting it is at the very least something we should pay attention to.   I'm sure we'll have a solid team next year, our roster is stacked and we have Peyton Manning and a Wade Phillips defense, but I'm questioning our talent level as I look at the post Manning era we are about to enter."
DenverBroncos,328pse,flynryan692,3,Sat Apr 11 18:33:15 2015 UTC,On top of that we are moving to a new scheme it wouldn't surprise me if we're picking up a lot of these guys because they can help with the transition to the newer scheme and because they already know it it means practice and such like can focus more on the starters than getting the depth up to speed.
DenverBroncos,328pse,Ezeran,3,Sat Apr 11 21:26:16 2015 UTC,"He is loyal and it does get him in trouble. But his greater failing is his need to control everything regarding play calling and the offense in general.  I am very curious how much head butting is going to happen with him and Peyton. He's already stated he knows he has to let Peyton run the offense, and that is a very large step for him.   So already you're in a good place cause you have a qb who can use that humongous playbook, and kubs is taking a step back from play calling.  I dreamed of that for the Texans for so long and y'all get it.   Seriously though I think Kub's is just picking up some good value players he's worked with prior."
DenverBroncos,328pse,Antilogic81,1 point,Sun Apr 12 05:08:10 2015 UTC,"Kubiak has said he will be calling plays from the sidelines as well. I think when they decide to pick up the tempo is when Peyton takes over, and when they are in grind it out mode, it will be Kubiak."

DenverBroncos,328pse,SuburbanHell,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:17:14 2015 UTC,We now have multiple players who can line up at both FB and TE. This could lead to some interesting looks on offense. I like it.
DenverBroncos,329wde,crueg,4,Sat Apr 11 22:26:00 2015 UTC,"I thought he also played Guard?  In either case, while I don't want to be the team that drafts nothing but Ducks, I'd love to see Grasu & Fisher on this line."
DenverBroncos,329wde,SuburbanHell,2,Sat Apr 11 22:28:43 2015 UTC,"Yes, he has also played guard, I'll edit that into the post. And don't worry, Chip Kelly is already doing that."
DenverBroncos,329wde,SuburbanHell,3,Sat Apr 11 22:30:07 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think his capability of switching between Guard & Tackle is definitely another selling point.  I'm so torn between taking Cameron Erving and Fisher in the first, with Grasu in the second (should we be lucky enough for it to fall like that)."
DenverBroncos,329wde,SuburbanHell,2,Sat Apr 11 22:31:31 2015 UTC,"I like Erving myself, but I don't think Fisher is a 1st rounder, there's just so much line talent in this year's draft class, I'd be surprised if he went in the first."
DenverBroncos,329wde,skullyD,3,Sat Apr 11 22:35:46 2015 UTC,Well now I have to hope we get all 3.  Hahaha.  I'm surprised since I've seen Fisher going as high as mid-20s.
DenverBroncos,329wde,BlindManBaldwin,3,Sat Apr 11 22:45:07 2015 UTC,He sounds like he could possibly take over the RT position which we certainly need help with.   He certainly won't be getting picked in the 1st round as described by your analysis though.
DenverBroncos,329wde,BlindManBaldwin,4,Sat Apr 11 23:06:32 2015 UTC,"Unfortunately, he never played basketball, so we wouldn't hear about him being a former basketball-tight end-lineman.   FUCK I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS :("

DenverBroncos,329wde,BlindManBaldwin,3,Sun Apr 12 15:02:02 2015 UTC,"Hey I know this guy! I went to high school with him and played football with him. He was or is 2 years older than me and was kind of my upperclassmen mentor.  He did actually play basketball just not at the varsity level. But he is damn good at it, played 21 with him and oh man. Anyway it makes sense with the penalties happen in high school all the time. Of course he's a big athletic guy and I'm rooting for him. Go big fish!"
DenverBroncos,329wde,BlindManBaldwin,2,Sun Apr 12 01:03:13 2015 UTC,"Early first at the highest, mid 2nd at the latest. He'd be worth the 28th IMO. The scheme fit is just too good, and he has the athleticism to switch to LT in the future if needed. His combine performance raised his stock a bit."
DenverBroncos,329wde,awolf97,1 point,Sun Apr 12 04:26:51 2015 UTC,Early first? How early are you talking?
DenverBroncos,329vhh,SuburbanHell,5,Sat Apr 11 22:18:06 2015 UTC,Gotta laugh at the idea of the Eagles passing on Amari Cooper at #20.  I live in PA so to see the reactions of their fans if that happened would be entertaining to see the least.
DenverBroncos,329vhh,AB444,4,Sat Apr 11 22:49:45 2015 UTC,Don't like Goldman in the first but there are some really good picks in there.
DenverBroncos,329vhh,zepender,0,Sat Apr 11 22:37:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I highly doubt he'd be available at that point anyway, but since he fell so far I figured I'd take a chance on him."
DenverBroncos,329vhh,zepender,2,Sat Apr 11 22:39:04 2015 UTC,"I just don't like the player or the fit, is all. edit: word"
DenverBroncos,329vhh,crueg,2,Sun Apr 12 01:42:18 2015 UTC,"DJ humphries in the 5th?? Wow. I don't think we need a DT in the 1st but with Sambrailo, Grasu and Humphries in the later rounds, that'd be a steal of a draft."
DenverBroncos,329vhh,pickels22,3,Sat Apr 11 22:54:23 2015 UTC,Right?  Fisher & Erving went earlier so I went BPA in the first and amazingly enough still got my OLine after the fact.  This would take a miracle to fall together like this.

DenverBroncos,3292fe,crueg,2,Sat Apr 11 19:00:28 2015 UTC,"I've seen him going around our spot in the 3rd, that would be a steal IMO.  Also this man quite clearly wins best name of the draft."
DenverBroncos,3292fe,SuburbanHell,1 point,Sat Apr 11 22:16:34 2015 UTC,"I can imagine Grassu still being up in the 3rd, so I think that would be a great value pick for us for a plug-and-play style center"
DenverBroncos,326oxs,crueg,4,Sat Apr 11 01:15:55 2015 UTC,"I may be biased because I attend CSU, but I want the Broncos to draft Sambrailo. He could end up being really good and the Broncos need a right tackle."
DenverBroncos,326oxs,howsitbeen,4,Sat Apr 11 01:19:29 2015 UTC,"I only went to CSU for a year before transferring to UF to finish(cheaper since my old man is alumni), but I like him and Grayson too, I think they'd both be good picks after the 1st round, if they're available, that is."
DenverBroncos,326oxs,BlindManBaldwin,5,Sat Apr 11 01:38:58 2015 UTC,If he fell to the mid-2nd I'd love to trade up to get him similar to what we did with Latimer last year.
DenverBroncos,326oxs,njm1314,3,Sat Apr 11 01:26:28 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't hate it if we got him at the end of the first. There are probably some better value picks out there though. I really doubt he lasts to mid second. He feels like on of those OTs that start going at the end of the first to me, happens every year."
DenverBroncos,326oxs,mexicutioner23,2,Sat Apr 11 01:47:46 2015 UTC,"Was interested in the ""hadn't spoken to his father"" thing and the only thing I found was him saying his dad still roots for CU except against CSU and his dad now owns more green and gold than black and gold which makes Ty ""happy""."

DenverBroncos,3207y5,aatencio91,7,Thu Apr 9 16:23:10 2015 UTC,Probably less.  They're already top 10-15 in attendance routinely.
DenverBroncos,3207y5,MisterKlaw,3,Thu Apr 9 16:40:26 2015 UTC,"If the city gave a shit about the team though, they could fill the stadium every day even if they upped ticket prices."
DenverBroncos,3207y5,aatencio91,6,Thu Apr 9 16:48:11 2015 UTC,It's true. Denver is a baseball town just waiting to happen.  Do you remember the feeling in the air in September/October 2007? it was fucking electric.
DenverBroncos,3207y5,SmartToaster,4,Thu Apr 9 20:55:32 2015 UTC,Electric is right. And the fact that the baseball season offsets the football season is just perfect. Denver can stay the Broncos' town and still get flooded with purple every spring.
DenverBroncos,3207y5,tartay745,2,Thu Apr 9 21:00:51 2015 UTC,It would cost them more to put a good team on the field. Hurts the bottom line.
DenverBroncos,3207y5,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Apr 9 17:33:42 2015 UTC,"Yep. Until the rockies get an owner that gives a shit about winning I will not be giving them any money.  The only way they will spend more on the team is if people stop showing up.  But since that doesn't look like it'll happen, we probably won't have a team that will compete for a deep playoff run.  I'm usually all for supporting your team through thick and thin but I've never heard of an owner who doesn't give a shit about winning with the resources they have to play with."
DenverBroncos,3207y5,StillJohnnyMox,2,Thu Apr 9 19:26:31 2015 UTC,"I felt that way too, but I'm cautiously optimistic with Bridich. Until he fucks up royally I have no reason not to be hopeful."

Get sloshed in nice weather and have an excuse to do it. That's why every one I know goes. Then you hit the bars and it's off to Beta or Chloe. Diamond if you're in that mood even. Rinse and repeat.  I try to say I won't give them any more money until they field a competitor, but here I am going tomorrow..."
DenverBroncos,3207y5,SmartToaster,4,Fri Apr 10 02:50:22 2015 UTC,"the monforts are just horrible owners and people, what kind of owners send letters to fans telling them not to come to games?"

DenverBroncos,3207y5,zbeg,8,Thu Apr 9 18:03:01 2015 UTC,I still think if they could have played the fucking Red Sox just a couple days after sweeping the D-Bags they would have won it and Toddfather would have a ring.  Still love watching Byrnes' dumb ass sliding head first into 1st and Todd pumping his arms in the air.  If there isn't a statue of that moment outside Coors Field eventually something is wrong.
DenverBroncos,3207y5,TheoneandonlyTate,2,Fri Apr 10 05:37:35 2015 UTC,"I was thinking about what the emotional highlights would be if you were a fan of all four Denver sports teams for different ages.  If you're in college, then it probably goes:  Broncos: 2013 AFCCG  Nuggets: 2009 WCF run  Avalanche: Last year's regular season? Help me out here.  Rockies: Rocktober 2007  I'm old, so I think I'm lucky enough to remember the all-time franchise highlights for each which are (IMO)  Broncos: SB XXXII  Nuggets: 1994 series over the Sonics. (Mutombo just got in the HOF!)  Avalanche: 2001 Stanley Cup  Rockies: 2007 pennant  I think it's interesting because SB XXXII and the 2001 Stanley Cup in particular played such a huge role in defining my experience as a sports fan, and it's hard to imagine rooting for the Broncos especially without that context. I'm curious what young people feel and what their emotional high and low points were."
DenverBroncos,3207y5,packagecheck,3,Fri Apr 10 06:20:38 2015 UTC,"All my highs are closely followed by lows. Losing championships sucks. Rocktober, to being swept. Manning's record breaking season to the Super Bowl Slaughter. I'm not as into basketball but it'd probably be 2013 having that great regular season to lose to the Warriors. Same for hockey, last year doing well then losing to the Wild. At least the Buffs have never done well enough in my lifetime to even get my hopes up, haha."

Last year his brother got in trouble and Talib was accused of doing something he wasn't involved in. My guess is same shit this year only this time he was with his brother. If I'm with my brother and he decides to punch a guy in the face I'm likely to be thrown in the same group and my brother because I was with him.

As far as the playoff thing, I think people make a lot of PFM's age and are concerned about our offensive line more than anything.  It concerns me, but given our division...I still don't see the playoffs as an issue.  Also, fuck the Raiders."
DenverBroncos,31zzj2,fearboner,8,Thu Apr 9 14:17:45 2015 UTC,"Cause of the way Peyton finished out the season, new coaching staff, new schemes for offense and defense, losing some good free agents, and not making big free agent splashes like usual.  Also, not trying to be cocky, but when you have a competitive team for a good period of time, other fans will eventually start wanting your team to lose (Patriots and Seahawks get similar thrashings).   It's just funny how I've seen multiple threads in /r/NFL predicting our record, with people saying we will ""be lucky to reach 10 wins next season."" or ""they will miss the playoffs.""   It's just pure ignorance and a bit of jealousy, again not trying to sound cocky."
DenverBroncos,31zzj2,skullyD,3,Thu Apr 9 16:15:49 2015 UTC,"If it's news media you're seeing that from, it's sensationalist bullshit in order to get people to click their headlines.

He'll do well with Matt Ryan, but don't expect Tony Gonzalez type numbers.  Maybe closer to Crumpler's last couple seasons there."
DenverBroncos,31zzj2,SuburbanHell,4,Thu Apr 9 16:20:43 2015 UTC,Cause we lost a few players in free agency. Although we still have one of the most talented defenses and an extremely talented offense. Also there are people questioning if Peyton is able to make it through a whole season without getting injured.
DenverBroncos,31zzj2,Bilyman,2,Thu Apr 9 14:14:38 2015 UTC,"Because its the time of year when people will only click on links that are provocative, and people need clicks. No one wants to read a story that says ""the AFCW will be the same as ever.""  Also, people look at Denver and only see Manning. I think we win the AFCW even if Manning gets injured and misses half the season.   Tamme is all right, but I wouldn't want to build an offense around him. I'd consider him just a guy, and not a solution to your Tony Gonzalez problem."
DenverBroncos,31zzj2,myshkingfh,2,Thu Apr 9 14:21:50 2015 UTC,"Everyone thinks Peyton is ""too old"" because they completely forgot he injured his damn quad last season, plus the new coach/system isn't helping the skeptics either. And losing a few players in free agency, while not going out and signing a bunch of big names, also means we're doomed apparently. Despite what they think, we're still a playoff team, maybe not a 13-3 team, but an 11-5/12-4 is realistic."

The whole thing is worth a read because there isn't a simple answer to be given without some context on the situation."
DenverBroncos,31umv3,ilyearer,2,Wed Apr 8 17:30:50 2015 UTC,"He's is asking why they don't simply repaint the helmet they are using, then paint it again when they go to their regular uniforms.   They mention in the article that when a helmet has damage they can't cover up they take everything out and put it into a new shell of the same type of helmet. So I don't see why they can't do that for throwbacks, that is the part we care about in a throw back - the outside shell. So if the same pads are inside and everything except the appearance is the same, why not? They get the ""broken in"" pads, we get the satisfaction of seeing a throw back uniform."
DenverBroncos,31umv3,flynryan692,2,Wed Apr 8 18:00:35 2015 UTC,"UW: Many fans and readers have asked me, ""Why can't they just paint their helmets to the throwback color and then paint them back to the regular color the week after that?""  EG: That might have worked in the past, with some of the old paints they used to use. When I first started here, we would go around on Sunday after a game, pick out the helmets that needed a new paint job, and then on Monday morning we'd send 'em to a local reconditioner who'd paint 'em and get 'em back to us by Tuesday afternoon, and they'd be ready to go. But the paint on today's helmets -- at least for our team -- takes four to five days to cure. The hardening agent in the paint takes longer to set up. And you need the helmets back by Wednesday, to practice in.   It's in the article. The article just also gives some additional insight into why the NFL's reasoning may be outdated and simply to cover their own asses in the event that something does happen.  edit: additionally, the NFL is worried about the liability for situations where a player is using a helmet type that may not be available anymore. So the situation of swapping out the outer shell wouldn't be possible without moving to another type of helmet. Then if the player gets injured, there would be liability concerns that could be directed towards being made to wear a different helmet than the player preferred and always wore. Easier for them to just say ""no""."

DenverBroncos,31saq8,8manjones,40,Tue Apr 7 19:49:21 2015 UTC,"The title is a bit misleading. He says he thinks he's one of the best in the league, but that when he steps on to the field, he feels like he is the best.  One is an objective statement about his ranking amongst his peers, the other is a subjective feeling that likely motivates his play on the field. I'm concerned that people are going to misinterpret that for trash talking other top CBs because of the title."

I'm really more criticizing the author of the article. Even if his intent was to right an article championing CHJ (in a way that a fair amount of us have been doing since early last season), it concerns me that other fans might take it as an invitation to start a flame war.

DenverBroncos,31saq8,Spizard,27,Tue Apr 7 21:01:00 2015 UTC,"Yes I would.  He allowed less yards, touchdowns, and a lower completion percentage/QB Rating then both of those guys last year.  Not to mention he has only ever allowed four touchdowns in his whole career."
DenverBroncos,31saq8,ilyearer,20,Tue Apr 7 21:03:06 2015 UTC,"I would pick him as well. Not just because of his stats, but because he doesn't make a name for himself by being loud as well as damn good at his job. Playing the game is more important to him than making headlines or talking shit."
DenverBroncos,31saq8,spndl1,15,Tue Apr 7 21:15:39 2015 UTC,"Plus, he's not a burden on our cap. Dollar for dollar, the Broncos are getting the best deal on a CB in the NFL."
DenverBroncos,31saq8,AB444,9,Tue Apr 7 22:53:15 2015 UTC,Also he's a hell of a tackler for a corner. Plays a lot like champ back in the day
DenverBroncos,31saq8,probablyreasonable,3,Tue Apr 7 21:34:02 2015 UTC,And he's the only corner who Champ has highly complemented.
DenverBroncos,31saq8,an0dize,5,Wed Apr 8 05:16:33 2015 UTC,"He also had Talib on the opposite side, often lining up against WR1's.  That's just something to think about, I'd still take him as the #1.  He's younger than the other ones too, so he probably hasn't even hit his ceiling yet."
DenverBroncos,31saq8,SHOUT-WoT,3,Tue Apr 7 23:25:50 2015 UTC,Which is a fair assessment when you compare him to Revis (although the way Revis and Harris JR. Handled their contract situations respectively I'll still pick Harris) But Sherman doesn't always get the #1 wide receiver. Teams scheme against that because he plays one side
DenverBroncos,31saq8,SuburbanHell,11,Wed Apr 8 03:56:36 2015 UTC,"Yep, no-brainer. He's fantastic stat-wise, he's got the biggest goddamned heart on the field, and holy shit did we get him at a hometown discount compared to those other names you mentioned."
DenverBroncos,31saq8,TDenverFan,3,Tue Apr 7 21:17:19 2015 UTC,"Depends on their contracts. At the price we have CHJ for (8m a year or so) vs 4 years 56 million for Sherm, I would take CHJ in a heart beat."

But then when a player succeeds or fails, those same people will often point to the fast 40 or the slow 40, the strength or lack of it, the big mitts or the fast splits, and factor it into why a player became what he did. Of course we all know the combine is about more than athletic measurements -- that's about No. 3 on the list behind accurate medicals and team interviews for league evaluators -- but I'll cite those more often now as we finally have the measurements and times to go with the tape. And so will everyone else as these guys' careers unfold.  As I often do at this point in the draft process, let me offer up a few reminders:  • I won't be projecting any trades and will add those to the draft board only once completed.  • I do expect free agency to shift the needs for many teams, but I haven't made any assumptions on who is signing where.

DenverBroncos,31ra9q,skullyD,26,Tue Apr 7 15:32:24 2015 UTC,"I assume we didn't use a ZBS last year under Fox and Gase,   Yeah, we used man-to-man blocking. Each offensive lineman was given a specific defensive man they had to block. If I recall correctly, we did have some zone-blocking too. My personal opinion is this what caused us our offensive line to flounder most of the season; we incorporated too much.   What exactly does the ZBS do?    Rather than giving a certain man you have to block, you are given an area, or a zone. If they're uncovered, they'll double-team someone. It's more than that, though. The technique of blocking is slightly different. Instead of relying on strength and power, zone-blocking relies on footwork and hand techniques.   Where it benefits most is the run game. So if the runner is going towards the side, each blocker's zone will move along with the runner. If it's a passing game, then the outside linemen will zone on the outside, while the two inside linemen will focus on the inside.   Also, what type of o-lineman typically fit the ZBS (athletic, hefty, smaller, etc.)?   Strong and fast. They're not as large as non-zone linemen because they need to have really good footwork and handwork.   Any upcoming prospects who would fit the ZBS?   There are a lot. The Broncos official blog posts some information on a few.   Any current players on the team who are good/bad fits?   They're all actually pretty good fits, thankfully! Shelley Smith is an underestimated pickup in Free Agency. Matt Paradis, Gradkowski, Schofield, and Garland are also good fits. Clady is good in any system, but he's built for zone.   Any current players on the team who are good/bad fits?   Manny Ramirez might be questionable.   How does the ZBS create superstar RBs like we've seen with Terrell Davis, Clinton Portis, (or I guess any RB of the Shanahan/Kubiak Era), Arian Foster under Kubiak in Houston, and Alfred Morris under Shanahan in Washington?   I think I answered this above. Basically, the zone is built to make holes."
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,waspocracy,9,Tue Apr 7 16:02:57 2015 UTC,"Praise Blucifer, thank you for the response."
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,HungryHungryCamel,5,Tue Apr 7 16:37:15 2015 UTC,"This is the best explanation. The double team is key. Zone blocking can slow a linebackers reactions by not entirely relying on pulling guards, which allows double teams at the LOS, and then a move up to backer after the line is secure. Its the best running scheme IMO"
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,Jake_53,5,Tue Apr 7 16:35:14 2015 UTC,"I'm a bit late, but I'll piggyback and add to your post.    If I recall correctly, we did have some zone-blocking too. My personal opinion is this what caused us our offensive line to flounder most of the season; we incorporated too much.   Fox runs a zone heavy multiple scheme, so we ran a majority of zone looks with man looks.   The best blocking scheme is the scheme that your players best fit, but scheme's like Fox's offer a certain unpredictability that is valuable over strictly man or zone blocking.    Where it benefits most is the run game. So if the runner is going towards the side, each blocker's zone will move along with the runner. If it's a passing game, then the outside linemen will zone on the outside, while the two inside linemen will focus on the inside.   The blocker's are moving laterally. This is important as defensive lineman want to get penetration, but they can't let blockers get position on them. This is where it helps weaker blockers as influence blocks can spring big gains in zone schemes.   The play action pass is also very potent in zone looks.    There are a lot. The Broncos official blog posts some information on a few.   The best prospects are guys who are scheme diverse: Cameron Erving, Brandon Scherff, La'el Collins, etc.   Some other guys to watch for: OT Jake Fisher, OT Ty Sambrailo, OT/OG/OC Mitch Morse, OC Hroniss Grasu, OC Reece Dismukes, etc.   Shelley Smith is an underestimated pickup in Free Agency.   Thank you for saying this. This guy has the ability to shock people. He just has to put it all together.    Manny Ramirez might be questionable.   IMO we have held onto him for 1 year too long.    I think I answered this above. Basically, the zone is built to make holes.   Another thing that's important to note is that not just any running back can succeed in a zone scheme, but guys who lack straight line speed can succeed. A great zone runner has to be decisive."

DenverBroncos,31ra9q,MountCRushmore,6,Wed Apr 8 16:03:49 2015 UTC,"My understanding is that in a typical zone blocked running play, all of the offensive linemen will occupy a zone, and then move together as a unit to either the left or the right. The blockers will seek to push the defender in their zone in the direction of the play. By pushing them to the side instead of back, the blockers rely on movement and momentum to move tacklers instead of trying to push the defender back or in a specific direction as in a man blocking play. The blockers don't try to create a specific hole, usually, but allow gaps to form between the defenders as they are moved left or right. One of the blockers typically cuts the last defender on the line to mitigate pursuit, which is why many people think that ZBS is cheap, or dangerous or should be illegal.   The running back is presented with a bunch of people moving one way or the other. He needs to survey the line and then decide which of the holes between his blockers is most promising. Then he needs to make his cut and get to the hole as quickly as possible.  So for blockers, you need players who have feet good enough to move a big defender sideways while staying in good blocking position while at the same time being big and strong enough to actually move the guy. The best version of this is probably Tom Nalen. Ryan Clady was drafted to perform in this system, and ought to thrive.  For the running back, you primarily need the vision to pick the right hole, and the decisiveness to get in it with no dancing when you see it. There's going to be a fair bit of inside running in a run game like this, so he can't seek to avoid contact too much. The best version of this is probably Terrell Davis. I have seen scouts say that CJ Anderson and Monte Ball ought to be pretty good at this, but Ronnie Hillman not so much."

Their offensive line was usually (if not nearly always) the lightest in the league. Zone Blocking linemen need to be athletic and are therefore usually not gigantic Jared Veldheer type guys.   Any upcoming prospects who would fit the ZBS?    Lots. A few include Hroniss Grasu (C), DJ Humphries (OG), Jake Fisher (OT), Reese Dismukes (C), Ty Sambrailo (OT), and many more.   Any current players on the team who are good/bad fits?   Well, Clady was drafted by Shanahan to play in Shanny's offense. He's good enough to play in just about any offense but he's a good fit for ZBS. Vasquez is good enough too."
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:09:32 2015 UTC,"Wasn't alot of what Shanny and Kubes were doing back in the day with ZBS involved chop blocking?  Chop blocking is now pretty much illegal in the NFL now a days, no?"
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,MillerTime58,4,Tue Apr 7 16:20:24 2015 UTC,Cut blocking and chop blocking are commonly confused. Chop blocking is when a defender is engaged and another OL throws his body at the defender's knees. It's dirty.  Cut blocking is when an OL dives at a defender's knees/legs to trip him up but the defender isn't preoccupied with someone else when it happens. It's slightly less dirty.
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,aatencio91,1 point,Tue Apr 7 16:32:42 2015 UTC,"Doh!  I was thinking the two were the same.  TIL.   It's slightly less dirty.   I remember defensive players not being cool with cut blocking either.  Shanny perfected it, but you still need a stud RB who can execute it like a Terrell Davis.    But then there was Mike Anderson, Olandis Gary, Clinton Portis, Tatum Bell......"
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,KimonoThief,2,Tue Apr 7 18:26:22 2015 UTC,"CJ Anderson should do great things running behind the Kubiak/Shanahan ZBS.

I believe Schofield also projects to be good in the new system as well."
DenverBroncos,31ra9q,Twizzle-dizzle,2,Tue Apr 7 16:04:58 2015 UTC,Yeah I remember when we first drafted him he was playing like a top 5 talent. Can't wait to put Clady back in the ZBS.  Edit: Clash? Really autocorrect? I meant Clady.

DenverBroncos,31s0t1,MountCRushmore,3,Tue Apr 7 22:10:50 2015 UTC,"Here is an example post.  This one is from our series earlier this year that focused on free agents. This current series is for incoming rookies that we would like to see the Broncos draft. The point of the post is to teach other /r/denverbroncos subscribers about these players since many don't watch college football or are eager to learn more about football in general. What we'd like to see is a brief summary of the player's college career and how the player would fit with the Broncos. If you'd like to read over some more posts, this is the hub post from the free agency series.  If you'd still like to do a writeup, you can sign up here. I'll then be in touch with you to work out a schedule for when you can put the post up.  If you have any other questions, feel free to ask away. I'm more than happy to answer whatever I'm able to answer. I've been involved with these since /u/cubedG first proposed the idea so I'll do my best to help out with what I can."

DenverBroncos,31tbe3,bmsuperfly,1 point,Wed Apr 8 00:25:39 2015 UTC,"You can switch what draft board it uses for the picks, maybe that would help? I used Eric Fisher's if I recall correctly."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,bmsuperfly,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:11:07 2015 UTC,"I used 3 different ones and it definitely makes a difference, but on all of them I felt like I came out way too far ahead. Collins dropping in one. Maxx in the 2nd in another. The third I came out with Fisher, Grasu, Humphries, and Tre' Jackson.   Such false hope because none of those are possible lol."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,powersty,1 point,Wed Apr 8 02:15:49 2015 UTC,"Heh, I only did it just the once. I wanted one of Humphries, Erving or Fisher and then Cann in the second. That seems reasonable, doesn't it?  Collins seems to have really had his stock rise recently among the dudes i listen to. I used to want him but he doesn't seem like he'll get to us. I'd take Williams in the second but I don't think he'll fall that far and I'm willing to roll with our TEs."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,bmsuperfly,2,Wed Apr 8 03:29:35 2015 UTC,I only took Maxx because he was available. I didn't even take a TE outside of that pick in 3 attempts. Just random times stuff happens there was one where Amari Cooper fell to 18 which I doubt happens.
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,powersty,1 point,Wed Apr 8 04:09:40 2015 UTC,"Does Tre' Jackson fit what we are trying to do? I read his scouting report, and it said he can stop his feet once engaged and only has short area quickness. Isn't that bad commentary for the zone blocking scheme? I noticed he was often available in the third if Grasu wasn't, so that is why I was looking into him. Also, I snagged Perryman in the third once, chances of that happening?"
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,bmsuperfly,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:19:41 2015 UTC,"He doesn't fit the system that well, but in the 3rd round I still go with the players with the most talent even if not quite a great system fit. He's not horrible in the scheme and has amazing upside.   My first 3 rounds tended to be an OT with 1st pick either Fisher, Humphries, or Clemmings. Cann in the 2nd and Grasu in the 3rd. That's probably the best we could hope for on actual draft day especially if we snag a good safety in the 4th or 5th like Prewitt.  Perryman, there's a chance he is he's projected early 3rd but players fall all the time so there's a chance, but I wouldn't say it's a huge one either maybe 10-20%?."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,powersty,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:13:12 2015 UTC,"You want to go O-line 1 2 and 3? I hope we do two of them and grab at least one DT or ILB with the first three picks. It all comes down to who falls where, but I would prefer grabbing someone just in case trevathan and or marshall can't start or the Sly and Austin experiment at the nose doesn't work. If opportunity presents, we should trade out of the first round to the early second and pick up an extra pick or two, grab the best remaining OT or DT. Then use the extra picks we grabbed to trade up into the middle of the second to secure whichever we didn't get at the start. I have been doing this in the mock drafts and I am usually able to get fisher and phillips or Clemmings and phillips. Somehow I ended up with Flowers and Eddie Goldman once, but that is a pipe dream."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,bmsuperfly,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:22:09 2015 UTC,"I wish I had kept the link and posted it I had a really good draft i wish would happen.  I went OL first 3 rounds then picked up a DT in the 4th, 5th was Kenny Bell and Prewitt from Ole Miss. 6th I picked up a ILB and 7th I took a OLB, DE, and BPA across the board which was usually another linemen.   While I didn't mention any names outside of Bell and Prewitt I think without accounting for trades because it's just too difficult to predict that an order of priority in that area would be very beneficial and we would hit a homerun with the draft class."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,powersty,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:28:22 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I was able to get Peat or Flowers in the first round on multiple occasions. At least twice, the other was still available in the second round. That certainly won't happen. However, I have went through the first three rounds quite a few times, and I have yet to miss on picking up one of the top Tackles in this draft. I was usually able to get two solid O-lineman, snagging Grasu in the third a few times. What this has shown me, is that if we commit our first round pick to an offensive tackle, we may miss out on top talent at D tackle. I know we have some options on the D Line, but I would really like to grab another big body in the center that can make an impact this year, especially with as many o lineman as we already have in play. Clady/Smith/Garland/Ramirez/Paradis/Gradkowski/Vasquez/Schoefield/Clark/Cornick - That is ten players already, and I may be missing one. So, for me, if Goldman is there, we should take him. If he isn't, we should consider phillips, because he won't make it to the end of the second. Or are other people out there higher on players like Cooper and Davis at D tackle? I just think there are at least 8 players in this draft that would be an upgrade at right tackle."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,bmsuperfly,1 point,Fri Apr 10 16:23:39 2015 UTC,"Very good chance Clark gets cut to save salary and the same with Cornick. So I would assume they're waiting till after the draft to see if they need him or not due to surprises.   I'm not entirely unhappy with Sly he hasn't lived up to his potential, but a think a scheme change may be nice for him and this needs to be his breakout year."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,powersty,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:18:36 2015 UTC,"I hope we keep clark as a back up for LT, although i don't know how he will transition to the new system, but he has NFL experience to put behind clady. Then bring in a rookie and him and schofield can battle for the RT spot. Vasquez is locked in at RG, but that means we have three people competing for C and two for LG before the draft already. Bring in one more via the draft, maybe two. These camp competitions are going to be crazy. I worry that searching for the best option and not allowing guys to get settled and familiar with one another hurt us last year."
DenverBroncos,31tbe3,Tlwofford,1 point,Fri Apr 10 20:44:04 2015 UTC,"Vasquez is a lock and so is Clady the other 3 spots are all up for contention.   Clark and Gino are almost guaranteed depth spots. Manny has easily cutable contract as well if he loses out on the C battle or the LG battle I could see him being gone very easily. Schofield and Paradis are too hard to know where they stand so it's easier to assume they're just depth.  Just draft the LT in the first to seal that spot with Schofield as competition. Then you have LG and C both which Manny can do, but you wouldn't want him to do either one ideally after last year, especially C.   Draft a LG to give that position competition with Manny and Garland.   Then the C position where Manny struggled last year. Gino is decent depth but far from starter quality. Paradis might never see the field as a Bronco at this rate. You also don't want a rookie like Grasu being the starter next year with no competition. It's not an ideal situation no matter what happens.   The D is pretty much set in stone, obviously you want a bit more from NT, but its not a huge issue with the depth signings of Austin and Smith along with the talent surrounded on that D. Draft another big man for the line and another linebacker for depth to compete with McCray, Barrow, and Nelson and call it a day.  BPA the rest of the way through the draft not too bad."

DenverBroncos,31nqbk,MFreak,17,Mon Apr 6 19:03:48 2015 UTC,"I think Talib gets seriously underrated by Broncos fans. We've seen how he can effectively wipe out a team's big receiver. Sure, he'll struggle against some smaller, shiftier guys, but he does as well as anyone man on man. JDR left him exposed last year.  Harris is just excellent all round. Broncos fans have watched go from covering the slot receiver in a rotation with Carter, to going outside this season (which I'll admit I was nervous about, even last year when he stepped in for Bailey) but he's excelled. His preparation and route recognition is tremendous. He's definitely more valuable to the Broncos overall.  Talib is terrific however, both compliment each other incredibly well."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,cmspunk,14,Mon Apr 6 19:33:24 2015 UTC,"CHJ's versatility is what makes him so great. He can cover left, right, and slot. Not every NFL CB can do that.  Talib is really really good, but he's not versatile like CHJ is. He's a physical CB who's better in press coverage and isn't as quick. So trying to pick the best between the two probably depends on what you're looking for for your team. It's not really a clear cut (a) is better than (b)."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,aatencio91,23,Mon Apr 6 19:18:35 2015 UTC,"Harris is better, but Talib gets more hype and recognition because he played for New England previously and also because of the contract.   I wouldn't say he is significantly better than Talib though. JDR is just an idiot at using Talib.   (Hey guys, lets have our slower and more physical CB play 12 yards off against one of the most explosive WRs in the NFL in TY Hilton, that'll work!)"
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,VonillaMilla,8,Mon Apr 6 19:13:11 2015 UTC,"1 WRs are usually big, Talib matches up on them, not because Harris can't, but because Talib can't handle the TY Hilton's who are quick twitch type guys. So that kinda sets the depth chart by the way that most people view it.  Edit: uh... Idk what I did this time wrong for that to happen... Lol my bad"

DenverBroncos,31nqbk,GotRiskyNewAccount,4,Mon Apr 6 19:08:38 2015 UTC,"People think of Talib as #1 because of the size and strength difference between him and CHJ, which leads to Talib usually covering a team's #1 WR.  CHJ is probably a better corner, and way more versatile, but if a team has a big #1 receiver, Talib will probably cover him."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,strizzle_work,2,Mon Apr 6 19:27:19 2015 UTC,Your Bronco friends sounds like casual fans or just watch too much ESPN. Harris is by far the better corner.
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,Fridden,2,Tue Apr 7 02:35:03 2015 UTC,"Harris isn't known by more casual fans, Talib is. That's probably why. Talib is a better press man corner (he's probably easily top 3 in that regard - Denver never pressed though for whatever reason last year). Whereas Harris is better in all the other areas, except zone coverage, where Talib and Harris are pretty close in.  Talib is still a pretty good corner in off coverage, that's what he played all of last year (with some zone) and he still had a top 10 type of year."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Tue Apr 7 02:49:05 2015 UTC,"Harris is the jack of all trades. He isn't the best at anything in the entire NFL, he is just exceptional at everything."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,aljds,2,Wed Apr 8 19:16:48 2015 UTC,"Harris is significantly more versatile. That can equate to mean ""better"" to most.  If I could only have one, it would be Harris.   The popular opinion about why the Broncos lost to the Colts in the playoffs is because Del Rio stupidly put Talib on Hilton instead of Harris, and Hilton abused Talib. He wouldn't have had much success against Harris.  So to answer your question, in my opinion, Harris is better, and it's a decent sized gap."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,VonillaMilla,1 point,Mon Apr 6 20:44:30 2015 UTC,"Chris Harris is in my opinion, the greatest CB in the NFL right now, and both the objective and subjective stats at Pro Football Reference Back me up.   He doesn't get the recognition or pay day as the other CBs because of his humility, the way he carries himself, and because he doesn't need to talk to prove himself.  This all makes me love him even more.    On top of that he came from the longest of odds, He was the 90th player signed, the year the rosters were expanded from 80 to 90.  He made the team his rookie year, started playing in the slot full time halfway through 2011, and was a full time starter 2012 onward.  He comes out a year earlier, and no team would have even given him a shot.   http://www.denverpost.com/ci_22248172/chris-harris-provides-big-bang-broncos-free-agent  He is a top 5 all time favorite Bronco, up there with PFM, Elway, Rod Smith, and Champ."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,CrazyPsychic,1 point,Tue Apr 7 04:37:38 2015 UTC,I wouldn't say his humility holds him back. Nnamdi was probably more quiet about his play than he was and he still got his recognition. Harris also talks a lot on twitter and talks about how he is the best CB.   I am not sure why he doesn't have notoriety but he doesn't.
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,VonillaMilla,1 point,Tue Apr 7 13:28:37 2015 UTC,"If I had to make a completely random guess it would be because of Richard Sherman. Talks trash, same position type of deal."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,CrazyPsychic,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:18:09 2015 UTC,"I don't understand why Nnamdi got his recognition though. He was probably in even worse position than Harris was. He was on a losing team, yet people still argued he was the best.   Revis got his hype because Rex Ryan kept tooting his horn and because he played for NY.   Harris plays for Denver and for some reason nobody cares still."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,aljds,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:21:20 2015 UTC,I suppose it could be said that Nnamdi was riding on the tail end of the champ bailey train. By that I mean that the primary Stat viewed was how few passing attempts were made his way. This is all purely my speculation still so take it with a grain of salt. :)
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,HippieHOP,1 point,Tue Apr 7 15:26:31 2015 UTC,"Tomorrow he could get into some twitter argument with Revis or Sherman or whoever, send some stupid tweets back and forth about who's better, and ESPN would pick it up as a story, show how great his numbers are, and then he would start to get a lot more attention.   I feel it's just the way he carries himself. He doesn't talk that much smack compared to most people and he stays out of the spotlight (in a good way, in contrast to Talib unfortunately).    On top of that, the fact that he was undrafted and wasn't a big name in college further reduces the attention he gets from the national media."
DenverBroncos,31nqbk,mg322,0,Thu Apr 9 04:10:10 2015 UTC,"CHJ is for sure the better technical player, Talib gets more recognition however because he is bigger and can cover the bigger receivers that are so coveted in the league today."

Basically he was kind of a reverse Batman. He was attracted to the light, not the darkness. That was really the only part that made any sense. I think his signature attack had something to do with flying right by peoples faces and just annoying them until they gave up on their crimes or something.

DenverBroncos,31mgj4,naked_short,2,Mon Apr 6 15:05:47 2015 UTC,Dunno why people hate Cutler. He was just smart enough to get off the McDisaster Express when the gettin' out was good. In a lot of ways I think I'd be happier if we had just found a way to work things out with Shanny with a better defense.
DenverBroncos,31mgj4,naked_short,2,Tue Apr 7 08:09:11 2015 UTC,That really wasn't his motivation.

DenverBroncos,31mgj4,naked_short,-1,Mon Apr 6 19:49:08 2015 UTC,"He had wanted to play for the bears since he was a kid. I think he told the broncos he would like to go to the bears or another team only. But he was looking for any excuse to get out of denver.   He's a weird dude. Anyone can see that.   I don't hate him fwiw, but he's had a very interesting pr strategy."
DenverBroncos,31mgj4,naked_short,2,Mon Apr 6 22:22:39 2015 UTC,"Yea, that was the media's line.   If I found out my boss was interviewing other candidates for my job then I'd probably start seeking other employment too. Seems like the only reasonable response."
DenverBroncos,31mgj4,lojician,-1,Mon Apr 6 22:49:38 2015 UTC,The thing is the media gets talk to him.  His friends and family get to talk to him.  Average people can't expect to get an honest answer from him. He could blow them off. He could lie to them without much guilt and he could tell the truth if he felt like it.  Now if you have any hard evidence that the media got this wrong. I'm happy to see it.

I'm passing along what I feel is a plausible argument based on the hard facts I do know for certain and logical thought that would lead to those actions.   People who do not want to leave their jobs, want to keep their jobs don't walk away like that. There are many examples in the history of the nfl of players who want to stay with the team.   Cutler did not behave like them.   And I don't hate Cutler. I think he's a weird guy and a bit of dissaster on the field like Brian Griese. And this story amuses me.   But the Cutler apoplogists are equally amusing. They have no reason to defend him based on play or character, they just don't like anyone making fun of him I guess."

DenverBroncos,31mt34,bentoboxbarry,4,Mon Apr 6 17:15:25 2015 UTC,"The idea, as I've read it, is he doesn't want to leave San Diego, but if the Chargers are moving to LA, he'd rather move back to the South where his family is from. So theoretically, if the Chargers are going to LA, they wouldn't be able to resign him, so get value for him now."
DenverBroncos,31mt34,myshkingfh,1 point,Mon Apr 6 17:12:37 2015 UTC,"That's interesting. Didn't know anything about him wanting to go to the south, but I did hear his LA concerns. I still seriously doubt that he's willing to go to a team like the Titans. I mean, the guy just broke his back for a decent team. I doubt he'll rush out on the field for a dumpster fire. From what I've read, Rivers seems like the kind of guy who'd be totally content walking away from the game if SD tries to screw him over."
DenverBroncos,31mt34,mack2nite,1 point,Mon Apr 6 21:39:04 2015 UTC,"Well I think he's from Alabama so the idea is he'd be going home. Or like vaguely near home. In any case, the theory is assuming a lot about Rivers that we don't know."

Love him or hate him, Philip is a great QB and if I had the opportunity to choose him or Peyton as my QB at this moment, I would take Rivers in a heartbeat.  I doubt he leaves SD, I doubt SD wants or gets Mariota, and all but a few teams would get on their knees for a shot to have Philip Rivers QB their team."

DenverBroncos,31keu3,Cube1916,1 point,Mon Apr 6 00:31:07 2015 UTC,"This would be cool.  I mean we already have CJ, Hillman, and Ball who are gonna be competing for touches. Might as well give Juwan the chance to contribute where he can."

DenverBroncos,31keu3,mg322,3,Tue Apr 7 01:36:30 2015 UTC,"Damn, wasn't it just a few days ago somebody mentioned Juwan was gonna play fullback?? Where do you guys here this stuff?"
DenverBroncos,31keu3,oobydoob,2,Mon Apr 6 02:10:59 2015 UTC,"I don't know about anybody else, but I don't hear it anywhere. I just think about who we have at the position who can do what. Thompson is our largest back, so it would make sense to have him out there as a fullback because you have to respect him as a ball carrier as well."

His major selling point coming out of college was versatility as a pass blocker, run blocker, and runner. He's not exceptional in any one role, but he can do a lot of things reliably."
DenverBroncos,31keu3,mysterious_pube,1 point,Mon Apr 6 07:36:38 2015 UTC,"I think it's true that having a solid running game is a big bonus but...   Over the past two seasons, 15 of the 24 playoff teams ranked in the top 12 in rushing attempts.   This is bullshit.  In many cases (if not most), winning causes running.  A team with a lead runs the ball to run out the clock.  Conversely, a team who is behind won't run nearly as often as they try to get back in the game."

DenverBroncos,31fhcq,VonillaMilla,39,Sat Apr 4 16:13:49 2015 UTC,"Montee Ball, because Thompson is going to be our next fullback.  Hillman will be brought in situationally."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,SuburbanHell,10,Sat Apr 4 16:18:45 2015 UTC,This is the answer.
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,CryBerry,-5,Sat Apr 4 16:45:21 2015 UTC,Okay...?
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Doctor_Turtle,5,Sun Apr 5 00:31:17 2015 UTC,"I'd rather have Hillman as the primary backup, but that's because I think he's shown more actual, real life potential than Ball."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Quiggibub,4,Sat Apr 4 16:47:24 2015 UTC,"It's possible -- it was Montee's job to lose, and lose he did, but it's a new season, so we'll see how things shake out, I have to think Montee is going to be striking back with a vengeance."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,SuburbanHell,3,Sat Apr 4 17:01:38 2015 UTC,"I don't remember reading anything about Thompson being our fullback. Plus, isn't blocking his weakness, right now?"
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,CO_Boiler,10,Sat Apr 4 16:51:28 2015 UTC,"Thompson's weakness was learning the play book. He actually is a very good blocker, that's what he did a lot of at Duke. But that being said I think he might stay at HB if Duncan can be the monster he should be at FB at 270+ lbs.  To answer OP though, I think the line play will determine who is the backup. I say this because if the holes are huge, Ball will probably be #2 with Hillman a close #3. If the line doesn't make huge holes Thompson, and Hillman should be the backups. Maybe Ball will get better, but everything I've seen is that his vision is horrendous, and that's one thing you need for a ZBS."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Anal_Explorer,6,Sat Apr 4 17:00:28 2015 UTC,"Montee has great vision. That's his main selling point and its what got him drafted.  People are just starting to use ""vision"" as a buzzword for when a back doesn't perform well. His problem wasn't vision, it was getting routinely hit at or behind the line and sporting a groin injury. And by the way, the ZBS can be a lot easier to run with than behind a man blocking line. Trent Richardson looked awesome behind Bama's ZBS but blew once he ran behind man blocking lines in Indy."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sat Apr 4 18:17:51 2015 UTC,"No I'm not using it as a buzz word. In Wisconsin he had pretty good vision, but it's hard not to see the holes behind that line. Here, how many times have you seen him run straight into the back of his blockers, multiple times, on the same run. Lots. He hurt two linemen this last year because of it. That may be because of it being man and the hole is supposed to open, but not twice on the same play.  Seriously go look at tape from Wisconsin, the holes are huge, literally impossible to miss. I understand that it was a selling point but he hasn't shown it here. Keep in mind the tunes when CJ would come in before Ball got hurt, you didn't see him do that, he would hit the hole, not the player."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Anal_Explorer,2,Sat Apr 4 19:49:24 2015 UTC,"I remember one such play like that, his TD run against the Colts in the season opener."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,flynryan692,1 point,Sat Apr 4 20:25:24 2015 UTC,"All of this. I think Ball could earn the number two spot, but I don't think it is a sure thing by any stretch and he needs to not run into his own teammates."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,SuburbanHell,2,Sat Apr 4 20:15:19 2015 UTC,"Pure speculation, the dude size-wise (edit:  and power-wise) reminds me a lot of Howard Griffith.  It's anyone's guess what the team will look like until after the last week of pre-season/cuts.  We might draft a FB, we might turn Jimmy Joe John Don Duncan into a FB, we might convert one of our existing backs into one."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,SuburbanHell,2,Sat Apr 4 17:00:15 2015 UTC,I don't think size equates to good blocking otherwise JT would have been halfway decent at it.
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,SuburbanHell,1 point,Sat Apr 4 17:02:08 2015 UTC,"I also have faith that if anyone can teach anyone how to be an blocking juggernaut, it's Kubiak.  I fully expect everyone on the line no matter what their role to get better at blocking this year."

DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Anal_Explorer,0,Sat Apr 4 17:09:54 2015 UTC,Not really.  JT is tall and slender.  That's the worst physical build for blocking.
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Formber,3,Sat Apr 4 19:27:02 2015 UTC,"Thompson is a monster, he deserves the back up spot IMO"
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Greeney494,7,Sat Apr 4 23:07:44 2015 UTC,"It's Ball. He didn't get drafted in the second round for no reason. He has great vision and his legs keep churning after contact, provided he is able to make it past the line of scrimmage. Everyone overreacted to him getting hit behind the line when the offensive line was soooo bad that it got reshuffled several times over the course of the season. Oh, and he was injured pretty badly."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Greeney494,5,Sat Apr 4 18:05:43 2015 UTC,"I think CJ is our guy for sure, but I wouldn't be entirely surprised to see Ball take the job either. We're lucky to have a stable of good backs."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Greeney494,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:30:55 2015 UTC,"I'm with you here, I think purely based on God-given skill set, Montee Ball is better. And if he was healthy, I think we could've seen the same numbers that CJ had against the same teams."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Greeney494,1 point,Sun Apr 5 02:15:42 2015 UTC,Based on what? I don't think there is a single thing Montee does better whether it is instinctive skills like vision or physical ability like speed or power.
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Chanma1,1 point,Sun Apr 5 06:45:38 2015 UTC,"What are you basing this off of? Montee had a far more decorated college career and I think there's a reason he was drafted and CJ was not, and that's because Montee has a better set of running back skills. I'm not saying that CJ is garbage but if he had the running back skills Montee had purely based on scouting, the entire league supports my theory. CJ earned the starting job with the effort he put forth last year, but as I said earlier, I think Montee has the tools to not only compete for the starting job, but to also win it back.   If you have watched the All 22 tape and decided CJ's instinct, speed and power were better than Montee's based off of CJ's six games and Montee's games he played he was hurt, than I'll take your word for it, because I haven't."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Anal_Explorer,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"Montee also played behind the Wisconsin O-Line that opened up massive holes that any RB could play in which is why no Wisconsin RB has had success in the NFL.   Wisconsin also ran the tires out of this guy just like the Cowboys did to DeMarco Murray.   If you watched Ball play without the homer goggles, you would see that he is our least physically gifted RB because if you saw something special in him you would have explained it besides using some lame argument that ""he was drafted earlier."""
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:20:03 2015 UTC,"His rookie year Montee was EIGHTH in the league in yards per carry, the coaching staff had so much confidence in him that they did not resign  Knowshon who was their leading rusher that year, he outright won the job in fall camp while CJ was actually leap frogged by Juwan Thompson and was fourth on the depth chart, and if it wasn't for Montee starting the season off injured, Ronnie Hillman getting injured and having Juwan and CJ split carries and given a huge amount more carries because of Peyton's injury, we may not be talking about CJ being the ""clear day one starter"". Also, your homer goggle comment makes no sense. I have no affiliation to Wisconsin and CJ and Montee are both on the team I root for.  And technically being drafted higher means that NFL souts believe that Montee had better vision, speed and physicality than CJ, which is why he was drafted higher."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,mrspencerrecor,1 point,Sun Apr 5 16:28:00 2015 UTC,"He didn't really start the season out injured as he came back at the end of preseason. I am not sure why the coaching and medical staff would let him play if he was still injured.   Not really, Montee had a better resume due to the records he broke in Wisconsin. The issue is that Wisconsin had to run the tires out of him in order to break those records. Having superior measurables does not mean you will be drafted earlier.   Plus, I am pretty sure if you look at their measurables, CJ actually had better ones.  40 time: Advantage CJ at 4.6 flat, Ball 4.66  Bench: Advantage CJ at 17, Ball 15  Vert: Tie at 32 inches  Broad Jump: Advantage Ball at 119, CJ at 118  3 cone drill: Advantage Ball at 6.88, CJ 7.15  20 yd shuttle: CJ by a landslide at 4.12, Ball 4.40   Even then the measurables mean nothing since RBs require a lot of instincts like vision and reaction time and CJ wins out in a landslide in that regard. I don't care if you think Montee will be the starter even though that is beyond delusional, you are just setting yourself up for disappointment."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,Sienna_Crush,0,Sun Apr 5 16:53:56 2015 UTC,"THe only delusional thought here is you thinking that I'm some Montee homer that said ""Montee would be the starter"". The comment I agreed with to begin was ""I wouldn't be surprised if Montee took the starting job back"". Then in my arguments I said the phrase ""CJ has absolutely earned the starter job."" SO my question is why do you hate Ball so much? I haven't been negative about CJ except for saying I thought Montee was more physically gifted. I think Brock is more physically gifted than Peyton, but I want Peyton as the starter. I was not trying to say CJ was garbage in anyway, you somehow thought that."
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,jlange94,1 point,Sun Apr 5 17:03:50 2015 UTC,Because there is nothing that backs up Montee being more physically gifted from watching them or from their combine scores or whatever.
DenverBroncos,31fhcq,United_In_Orange,5,Sun Apr 5 17:10:48 2015 UTC,Sometimes the line was reshuffled because ball would run into our linemen and injure them. That's not really what I would call good vision.

DenverBroncos,31dg78,Greeney494,8,Sat Apr 4 04:16:55 2015 UTC,You mean he's ONLY played meaningless snaps?
DenverBroncos,31dg78,MothaFukkinMack,2,Sat Apr 4 05:37:16 2015 UTC,I meant to say meaningful but said meaningless because who knows why.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Greeney494,40,Sat Apr 4 16:01:47 2015 UTC,There is no basis on which to form an opinion. I do agree with the other guy that at first glance he does seem quite tall though.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,myshkingfh,7,Sat Apr 4 01:09:17 2015 UTC,Yea it's too early to judge a quarterback even after 16 games of full play IMO. That's just not a lot of time to adjust to the NFL. I'll tell you what I think of him after some reps this season and his first full season. I feel it is safe though to consider him tall.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Coos-Coos,54,Sat Apr 4 03:11:15 2015 UTC,He seems like he's pretty tall.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,JZweibel,14,Sat Apr 4 01:08:25 2015 UTC,I can pretty well confirm that he appears tall.

DenverBroncos,31dg78,NegativeGhostwriter,4,Sun Apr 5 23:40:47 2015 UTC,I need to see him more in real game situations to make an adequate opinion.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,kobun253,10,Sat Apr 4 03:35:07 2015 UTC,"He has all the physical tools but he hasn't enough time and practice to play with the real team to make a valid opinion.  He hasn't exactly been lighting it up in preseason either, so a lot of fans seem to be frustrated with him and wanting to give up on him.  A lot of Packers fans felt the same for Aaron Rodgers in the beginning and were frustrated with him but when he came in for an injured Favre in 2007 against the Cowboys and played well, I think they realized he was ready.   I am not predicting Brock to be ARod, but I think he could be like a borderline top 10 QB and in the Joe Flacco range, assuming things go as plan."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,VonillaMilla,3,Sat Apr 4 02:00:36 2015 UTC,I am not predicting Brock to be ARod   Jesus can you imagine though if that's how it turns out?
DenverBroncos,31dg78,SuburbanHell,4,Sat Apr 4 14:44:42 2015 UTC,I feel like if he got to play more with the 1st string he'd be able to catch up to speed pretty quickly. I just wish we could see him in more situations where it matters. Imagine if he'd have been in on 3rd down last year with 5 yards to go. He can do the same roll out that Manning can do... just he can break up field with greater speed.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Colorado222,3,Sat Apr 4 02:21:45 2015 UTC,We have no idea how he's gonna be until he starts. The 3 raiders games he's been solid. The Chargers game he was awful in the couple series he played. He's got a great arm and from what I've seen he has good accuracy. He's too jumpy in the pocket. Tries to force passes when he doesn't need to. Tries to run when he doesn't need to. I feel like he's promising. the stuff I see wrong can be fixed. There's no definitive answer of whether he's good or bad we won't know really until he starts a couple games. But he deserves a chance

DenverBroncos,31dg78,drax117,4,Sun Apr 5 00:59:07 2015 UTC,"So far, the one thing I'd say is that he seems a bit slow making decisions in the pocket. To be expected."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,SuburbanHell,2,Sat Apr 4 01:39:36 2015 UTC,"That's the biggest issue with his lack of playing time, when he steps on the field as the starter next year he's essentially going to be a 26 year old rookie."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,smada87,1 point,Sat Apr 4 14:46:03 2015 UTC,Well he's had time to sit back and learn from the best. I think that made the learning curve less steep For him when he actually gets out there
DenverBroncos,31dg78,SuburbanHell,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:30:56 2015 UTC,I keep hoping that will be the case.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Fridden,2,Sat Apr 4 23:47:13 2015 UTC,I don't really have one. I don't expect much from him but I'll wait till he actually gets playing time to pass judgement.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,irishknots,5,Sat Apr 4 13:44:34 2015 UTC,He's the crustacean sensation  that's sweeping  the nation. What else do you want?
DenverBroncos,31dg78,broncosfighton,7,Sat Apr 4 01:56:15 2015 UTC,"After watching the half he played against Oakland a couple years ago I couldn't have a worse opinion. Terrible footwork, had the happy feet syndrome, couldn't complete a pass, bad vision, etc. He played well this year though, so its difficult to form an opinion."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,kgxv,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:30:37 2015 UTC,The happy feet were taught to him by PFM and were clearly intentional. Watch his college film and see how much his footwork has changed by watching the series he had against Oakland last season.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Colorado222,1 point,Sun Apr 5 18:08:00 2015 UTC,That was a couple of years ago though? He has continually gotten better.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,broncosfighton,6,Sat Apr 4 02:15:33 2015 UTC,That's exactly what I said.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Colorado222,2,Sat Apr 4 02:41:47 2015 UTC,"I apologize, I do think he played well this year as well. Hopefully he can get to the point where he can elevate the players around him as well as he can play up to the starters."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,aljds,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:45:59 2015 UTC,"It was week 17 of 2013. 90% of QBs drafted in the first two rounds of the draft would be in big trouble if they weren't looking good by the end of their sophomore year.    In his defense, he has had limited reps, both in games and in practice."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,DasRoach,4,Sat Apr 4 15:49:30 2015 UTC,"He's been learning under Manning for a few seasons so he can't be all that bad. He won't be elite right off the bat but should be a decent, serviceable QB to hold down the fort."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,NegativeGhostwriter,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:49:03 2015 UTC,"I think Peyton's vision is what really makes him special, and I don't think that's something you can teach.    I do hope some of Peyton's work ethic has brushed off on BrockO though."

DenverBroncos,31dg78,Quiggibub,3,Sat Apr 4 03:44:21 2015 UTC,"I have no opinion because Peyton won't let him play in any situation.  That annoys the hell out of me, and does nothing but hurt Osweiler's development."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,oooolala,2,Sat Apr 4 16:58:01 2015 UTC,I met him at the mall once. He was nice and also he looked pretty tall.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,FireDog911,1 point,Sat Apr 4 02:39:11 2015 UTC,"Now I'm not sure how people have noticed, Reddit here seems not to mention it...  But Brock Osweiler, is in fact... Ready for this? It might shock you. Tall.  I know, hard to believe. But that is the truth.  For real, he has potential. I am not sure if he'll be amazing, but I doubt he'll be terrible. If we can keep the team we have now and the skill we do, they can make him look better. Brock hasn't played enough to get a real grasp and the few snaps he has played, if I'm correct, have really been with second stringers rather DT or Hemanul."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sat Apr 4 21:27:33 2015 UTC,Huge potential if everything soaked in from Peyton and got his mechanics solid. At worst we bomb it for a year (I'd give him 2 because that's going to be a hellacious transition) and we get a high draft pick to take the next guy.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Colorado222,1 point,Sat Apr 4 01:22:00 2015 UTC,"Overall, he hasn't been given enough snaps to have a definitive opinion. Butt Fuck It, he has really improved on his technique since he's been a Bronco. His poise in the pocket has gotten better and has shown that he can gain like 8 yards with 5 steps. After his first TD pass to big motha fucka Green (on the second try?) he  made his first evolution into an NFL quarter back. This isn't Clip Board Jesus, or a Mallet, neither a Gabbert. This guy is our Bronco that we will rally behind. I wish I had a rewind of what is in my mind, but he really deserves to at least start in Denver after Manning retires next year.  Can't wait to see his final form... Hopefully as a Bronco."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Drek49,2,Sat Apr 4 02:13:56 2015 UTC,That's pretty much what I was thinking. The biggest issue I've had with him is when he's in the pocket. He's got a great arm. He's a decent scrambler. But he improved greatly last year in the pocket and Thats why he looked so good in the preseason. I feel like he's promising but you never really know till he starts a couple games.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Bronco30,1 point,Sat Apr 4 05:36:38 2015 UTC,I hope he never starts.

DenverBroncos,31dg78,sLyReLoadZz,0,Sat Apr 4 19:37:52 2015 UTC,He looks a little like Robert Pattinson.
DenverBroncos,31dg78,johninbigd,-2,Sat Apr 4 02:27:19 2015 UTC,"Tall. Mobile. Heck of an arm. From all reports, he sounds like a very hard worker who studies and practices a lot, and well. It remains to be seen if any of that works out when he's the starter, but I'm excited to see what he can do. I was sort of hoping Manning would retire so we could see Brock this year."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,Colorado222,3,Sat Apr 4 01:22:12 2015 UTC,"Considering how much regular season work he's had, every single snap he gets matters. I would also have liked to see him start this year. Perhaps if we can seal a playoff spot, he'll see a start or two."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,HippieHOP,0,Sat Apr 4 02:19:35 2015 UTC,"I like him, I think he loves to play and is very passionate about the game so I don't think he will disappoint when he finally gets his chance!"
DenverBroncos,31dg78,njm1314,0,Sat Apr 4 18:52:32 2015 UTC,"We'll see, but I was less then impressed with him coming out of college."
DenverBroncos,31dg78,sev45day,0,Sat Apr 4 06:01:53 2015 UTC,"My perception is not good. This is not based on any research at all, just on my feelings after seeing him play in the handful of pre-season and mop-up duty moments over the past couple of years. He did not impress me at all, I came away feeling very bervous about him taking over. And believe me, I wanted to be impressed very much.  Also of concern, is the fact that the coaches did not allow him to get any time at all last fall when Peyton was clearly hurting. This indicates a lack of confidence to me. I really hope he's benefiting from being Peyton's understudy and will come in and light up the league. But so far I haven't seen it.  Edited: meant ""pre-season"" not ""pre-game"""

DenverBroncos,31dg78,CO_Boiler,3,Sat Apr 4 22:32:21 2015 UTC,He's had 30 career passing attempts... That's less than a full game worth a lot of times. Preseason is terrible to judge because it's 2/3s against 2/3s. How can you say we've seen him?

DenverBroncos,31bkig,myshkingfh,3,Fri Apr 3 16:01:38 2015 UTC,"It seems like in retrospect some of our offensive coaching and personnel decisions last year were really suspect. Schlereth seems more judgey about Clady than seems necessary. It wasn't his best year, but he was coming off of injury and it seems like he wasn't put in a very good place to succeed. He's only 28 years old, and it seems to me more likely that 2014 was a dip rather than the beginning of a downhill slide. I think he could easily move back to elite in 2015.  I think I also recently heard someone (Cecil Lammey?) say that one of the rough spots between Fox and Elway was Fox's refusal to play young players. Maybe we're underestimating what Paradis and Schofield can do."
DenverBroncos,31bkig,lojician,2,Fri Apr 3 19:12:42 2015 UTC,As far as clady goes he hasn't really been elite since the beginning of his career. Yes there have been injuries that could very well be the reason for that but at some point you need him to prove that his first season wasn't the aberration instead of the rest of them.
DenverBroncos,31bkig,vearson26,6,Fri Apr 3 20:26:30 2015 UTC,"The beginning of his career is when he played in a zone blocking scheme, which we are going back to this season."
DenverBroncos,31bkig,Fridden,2,Fri Apr 3 22:14:14 2015 UTC,And he was drafted to play in a zone blocking scheme. After he gave up zero fucking sacks his rookie season. They were like lol nope we're switching to a power run scheme even though that's not what you were drafted for.
DenverBroncos,31bkig,Colorado222,1 point,Sat Apr 4 22:30:37 2015 UTC,Cereal. I remember last year he looked like he didn't know where he should go... well yeah he need the ZB scheme. Can't wait for the season.
DenverBroncos,31bkig,lojician,2,Sat Apr 4 02:43:42 2015 UTC,2012 he was a first team all pro....

DenverBroncos,31bkig,peaceblaster68,3,Fri Apr 3 20:29:41 2015 UTC,I'm curious what makes you say that. He was never an amazing run blocker but putting that aside it just seems like he gets beat relatively often by edge rushers for an elite tackle. I'm not calling him a terrible player or anything but he hasn't exactly been an impenetrable wall recently as a player who has pass protection as his strength.

There are so many people who anticipate us to just shit the bed because of a new coach and Peyton getting a year older. Unless Peyton has seriously declined in his play (which is still top 10 QB play IMO),  I can see us being just as dominant as we have been the past 4 years.  But others will put their blinders on and not want to see it that way, I guess they ignore how stacked we are underneath Peyton and other older vets, we are still a powerful team."

DenverBroncos,319lb0,SirFireHydrant,4,Fri Apr 3 04:25:36 2015 UTC,We are a talented team without manning but you are forgetting how hard it is to win the division without a HOF QB
DenverBroncos,319lb0,travelagent007,15,Fri Apr 3 04:55:28 2015 UTC,Precisely.  Which is why we can win the AFCW with the Lobster.

DenverBroncos,319lb0,flynryan692,-1,Fri Apr 3 15:42:46 2015 UTC,"I don't think I am, because we largely did it last year. Manning wasn't anywhere near a HOF QB last year, and I don't really expect he will be one this year either (but I hope he will!)  With a running game a great defense and a league average QB, it wouldn't be unexpected to with the AFCW. Its a recipe a lot of teams have followed - Baltimore, San Francisco, Detroit, Kansas City, Cincinnati etc."
DenverBroncos,319lb0,myshkingfh,0,Fri Apr 3 15:41:18 2015 UTC,"Seattle is an example of this. Although, I'd say Wilson might be a smidge above average."

DenverBroncos,317rwv,spndl1,12,Thu Apr 2 18:47:56 2015 UTC,"Welker's a free agent, which technically means he's not on the team. There's no reason he should be there. I hope he just retires. I know he wants to keep playing, but it seems like each season is taking more out of him than the last, to the point he's going to start seeing long term health effects, if he's not already at that point."
DenverBroncos,317rwv,IdRatherBeLurking,0,Thu Apr 2 18:58:23 2015 UTC,"Totally agreed. Even if they don't want Welker to start anymore, I think it's crazy that the FO would apparently rather roll with Bubba as our 4th option at WR than Wes. Considering that he wants to play two more years, desperately wants a ring, and has no other offers, I have a hard time believing Wes wouldn't accept a reduced role and about 1.3 million per year- Bubba's current contract, money that we could just give to Wes if we cut him."
DenverBroncos,317rwv,depressedcarguy,3,Thu Apr 2 18:53:27 2015 UTC,How is that crazy? Welker is almost worthless now- at least Caldwell has his health.
DenverBroncos,317rwv,IdRatherBeLurking,10,Thu Apr 2 19:02:23 2015 UTC,"I don't know why everyone hates Caldwell, not every receiver on the team is going to be a monster. He showed what he can do in the chargers game 2 seasons ago when he was the only one pulling in balls. That's all I need to see."
DenverBroncos,317rwv,Crosshare,6,Thu Apr 2 19:10:34 2015 UTC,Agreed. He's also a good player to have on special teams.
DenverBroncos,317rwv,depressedcarguy,2,Thu Apr 2 19:13:26 2015 UTC,It's more that the previous regime held Latimer down on the depth chart and played Caldwell in 4 and 5 WR sets when Latimer was obviously a much more dynamic option.

If you look at next seasons free agency we have like 35 rostered players in free agency. It's going to be a crazy high amount of guys we will need to resign, Von and DT among them.

DenverBroncos,319rf0,Fridden,3,Sun Apr 5 03:18:51 2015 UTC,"The Broncos were in the middle to upper half in terms of cap space this off season. Keep in mind their big free agent signings happened before the off season started (Demaryius Thomas, Von Miller, Chris Harris, arguably 3 of the best at their positions in the NFL).   It's always sexier to bring in a big name from another team, but we forget how stacked this team already is."
DenverBroncos,319rf0,drmeattornado,4,Fri Apr 3 13:17:20 2015 UTC,"Of those 3 only Harris is signed long term, we picked up Miller's fifth year option from his rookie deal and franchised DT. DT will probably command around what the tag is and Von might get a bit less since he can be franchised the next 2 years if the Broncos really want to keep him and he doesn't sign anything."
DenverBroncos,319rf0,meztastic,4,Fri Apr 3 13:40:50 2015 UTC,"Yes, those are the details, but they all go against the salary cap and they were potential free agents that stayed in Denver.  Imagine if another NFL team signed all three of those guys, that would be one heck of an off-season.  My point is, the Broncos had more cap space than what people realize and just because they didn't sign a Manning, Welker or Ware like in years' past, people are upset about it.  This is still a top 2-3 team in the AFC and top 5 in the NFL and they will be contending this year no matter what.  If anything, Denver learned that spending a lot on free agents can hurt you when you want to re-sign your drafted players to bigger deals after their rookie deals expire.  Eric Decker, Zane Beadles, Julius Thomas, Rahim Moore, Orlando Franklin are perfect examples of this.  I'm glad they haven't spent big money this year."
DenverBroncos,319rf0,drmeattornado,3,Fri Apr 3 14:16:29 2015 UTC,"Great points, I totally agree. The other reason that I'm fine with them not spending is that there really weren't that many players that could instantly improve the team (the only one that I had a faint hope for was McCourty, but that's a lot of money to put into the defense). Our main need IMO is O-line and spending a bunch of money in FA on O-line is a great way to have a crappy line on a big budget."
DenverBroncos,319rf0,meztastic,2,Fri Apr 3 15:01:49 2015 UTC,"DT wants closer to 4 million over the tag from everything that has come out, otherwise they would have probably signed him already."
DenverBroncos,319rf0,CO_Boiler,2,Fri Apr 3 14:11:26 2015 UTC,"There will be quite a bit of turnover in 2016, but most of those guys are easily replaced and might not even be on the roster this year. The current list includes future Hall of Famers Josh Bush, Jon Halapio, Ross Madison, and Kerry Taylor, among others. There will really only be 8 to 10 guys of real value, and a few of them are RFAs or ERFAs. Assuming DT gets his deal done this offseason, the only big free agent name to re-sign will be Miller."
DenverBroncos,319rf0,mysterious_pube,1 point,Fri Apr 3 07:22:40 2015 UTC,I think it is the combination of not signing big names along with the fact that we basically didn't re-sign anyone. I think if we re-signed a few more guys our fanbase would be happier.

DenverBroncos,317xwc,Jens1893,27,Thu Apr 2 19:01:16 2015 UTC,That´s 5 out of 7 offseason acquisitions who have previously worked with Kubiak. This is borderline ridiculous.
DenverBroncos,317xwc,bzzltyr,18,Thu Apr 2 18:48:42 2015 UTC,"Jack del rio brought in knighton and brandon Marshall from jacksonville when neither were that well thought of. I think that worked out alright. Sometimes coaches see something about a player that may not show if they aren't put in the right situation or system. I will reserve judgement until seeing how it works, it's not like we're breaking the bank on any of them."
DenverBroncos,317xwc,Jens1893,6,Thu Apr 2 19:11:47 2015 UTC,"I don't mind taking the odd flyer on a guy at all and I'm actually ok with the Smith signing as I trust Kollar, but when signing a guy who has ties to the coaches becomes the norm, I think it's fair to bring that point up and ask some questions. Especially when you look at the coaching staff also. Five of the seven outside hires have ties to Kubiak."
DenverBroncos,317xwc,Greeney494,8,Thu Apr 2 19:30:37 2015 UTC,"But why is familiarity such a bad thing for new coaches? Their first year at a new organization they probably want it to go as smooth as possible so they bring in guys that are on the same page as they are.  And don't forget, Elway is familiar with nearly all the new coaches as well. I don't think there's a problem with ""keeping it in the family"" because then you know you won't have arguments that Elway and Fox clearly started having at the end of the year."
DenverBroncos,317xwc,Jens1893,6,Thu Apr 2 20:01:11 2015 UTC,"It doesn´t necessarily have to be a bad thing, but it can be. I hope those guys were hired because they believe they are the best and most qualified guys for the job and not because they like those guys on a personal level.  And I think it´s fair to ask those questions and bring up those concerns when there´s a previous connection between Kubiak and 5 of the 7 new external coaches and 5 of the 7 new players. I think he might be going overboard and as a CU fan I´m a little cautious when it comes to these things after the failed Embree/Bieniemy experiment in Boulder."
DenverBroncos,317xwc,Greeney494,2,Thu Apr 2 20:21:53 2015 UTC,"Right, but unlike CU, Kubiak and staff are coming to a team that has won the division 4 years straight and is loaded with talent."
DenverBroncos,317xwc,MasonL52,4,Fri Apr 3 00:33:54 2015 UTC,"In a, good way?"
DenverBroncos,317xwc,da1hobo,15,Thu Apr 2 18:51:51 2015 UTC,Kubes loves his guys.  The only real problem is that he holds on too strong.  He won't let shitty coaches or players go because he's so strongly dedicated to them.  That mentality landed us with some pretty bad cap situations and starters that shouldn't have been on the field anymore.  And one truly awful special teams coach that was losing us games that we couldn't get rid of for half a decade.
DenverBroncos,317xwc,spndl1,17,Thu Apr 2 19:03:40 2015 UTC,I think Elway is the balance to that. He's shown loyalty when there's cause and shown the door to others when it's in the team's best interests.
DenverBroncos,317xwc,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Apr 2 19:07:13 2015 UTC,Might explain why we got Gino and why we also tried going after Tyrod Taylor.
DenverBroncos,317xwc,Jens1893,2,Thu Apr 2 19:11:37 2015 UTC,I'd drop the might ;)
DenverBroncos,317xwc,Jens1893,5,Thu Apr 2 19:35:34 2015 UTC,"5 of the 7 coaches he brought in from the outside have previously worked with him, too. There´s a fine line between familiarity and nepotism."
DenverBroncos,317xwc,march20rulez,12,Thu Apr 2 18:53:30 2015 UTC,Well that line is success. If we do well everyone will say how his familiarity with his coaches/players helped.  If we don't it'll be nepotism

DenverBroncos,317a4h,SuburbanHell,2,Fri Apr 3 09:40:12 2015 UTC,"Not sure - I know there was a stat about how well he drafts O-linemen, and I'm sure over time we will find that to continue to be true,  but for it to work this year, that would still rely on them being aces as rookies in our current situation."
DenverBroncos,317a4h,iSamurai,1 point,Fri Apr 3 09:52:04 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I'm nervous about our O-Line too. It really is the most important factor this season, and we are painfully depleted there.

Last year we were trying to move up for a linebacker and the guys there didn't want to trade but I think this year we will try to trade up and hopefully trade back into the first. I can hope at least.

So he's got the measurables and the college tape at least. He only got one year to prove himself with the Ravens, and it was an awful year where we changed schemes halfway through. Finally he knows Kubiak's system.  I think you could've gotten him for a 7th round pick and Baltimore would be celebrating. Swapping a 4th for a 5th is a bit of a steep price to pay. But if you can find a starting center in Gino Gradkowski to take advantage of the twilight years of Manning, then it was absolutely a good trade for  you."
DenverBroncos,313njh,spooky981,2,Wed Apr 1 20:32:53 2015 UTC,I can't tell. How sarcastic was that 'wizard of drafting'?

DenverBroncos,313njh,baron32191,7,Thu Apr 2 14:03:07 2015 UTC,"While this dude did not play well at center, he did play guard in college. It's possible the plan is to move him back to his natural position. We obviously don't know the thinking behind the deal, but Kubiak knows a hell of a lot more about linemen than we do. Replacing Manny, who is probably Denver's least athletic lineman right now, with Gradkowski would save 1.5 mil in cap space, too. Maybe that's the plan. I dunno. Just spitballing.  Still, I'm not fond of the move, but who knows. Manny originally sucked and was out of football for nearly a full year before he came to Denver, and he was a pretty good center for a year and a serviceable guard for a bit."
DenverBroncos,313njh,mysterious_pube,5,Thu Apr 2 00:15:32 2015 UTC,Kubiak is a terrific o-line coach remember that...
DenverBroncos,313njh,azbycx1234,0,Thu Apr 2 00:35:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, but Gradkowski was with Kubiak last year, and he still sucked donkey dick. Hopefully this pans out but I'm not too optimistic tbh."

Broncos get Gradkowski and 5th round pick.  Honestly, I know he's not a player to get excited about, but that's a pretty low price to pay.  Even if he ends up being a backup, most 4th/5th rounders end up being backups or cut anyway; at least we know he is capable of making an NFL roster."

DenverBroncos,313njh,StankFish,2,Wed Apr 1 21:46:10 2015 UTC,"Its all about who fits into the system. Gradkowski is an athletic, strong lineman who knows Kubiaks system.

I trust (maybe too much) that Elway and Kubiak know what they're doing, and even if he wasn't that great in Baltimore (though this is only what I've seen based off of PFF grades, which are far from the full story) I feel they can turn him around somehow."
DenverBroncos,313njh,IComeUpWithBadIdeas,5,Wed Apr 1 19:56:03 2015 UTC,Drafting/free agency under elway's regime has been overall fine but his trades leave something to be desired. And kubiak is continuing the trend of trying to bring in a bunch of 'his guys' with questionable talent. Bleh.
DenverBroncos,313njh,lojician,2,Wed Apr 1 21:30:13 2015 UTC,"We want our team to play with that fire, seems like lots of players play that way under kubiak and he's bringing in guys he knows so they will fight for him imo."

Quinn makes the Alphonso Smith pick look almost savy. We traded away two third round picks for the privilege of drafting this guy in the second round. He had 12 career catches in college. TWELVE!   You know how many he had with the Broncos? One. One fucking catch then he was gone. Josh McDaniels is a fucking moron.
DenverBroncos,3124bg,njm1314,2,Wed Apr 1 20:52:59 2015 UTC,"I remember reading my draft magazine, and he was graded out as a late 7th-UDFA.

McDaniels tried to say that it gives away the illusion that they might pass to him."

Was a decent MLB but this was one of the highest draft picks the Broncos ever had. Never made the Probowl. Alphonso Smith CB - 2009 2nd round #37 overall - This has to be the one of the worst draft moves of all time. McDaniels traded an unprotected 1st rounder for a 2nd round pick. The 1st rounder ended up being #15 (so we essentially moved down 22 spots) overall and gave the Seahawks Earl Thomas. This one still makes my teeth hurt.

That being said, this is a pretty feast or famine draft and even if Knowshon didn't live up to the hype of 12th overall, he has had a better career than guys like Aaron Maybin, Aaron Curry, Jason Smith, Peria Jerry, Beanie Wells and the aforementioned Alphonso Smith."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,OpabiniaGlasses,19,Wed Apr 1 15:31:54 2015 UTC,Wasn't worth the 12th overall frickin pick in a totally stacked draft
DenverBroncos,3124bg,MrBulger,6,Wed Apr 1 15:15:08 2015 UTC,I agree he wasn't worth the 12th pick but that draft was not stacked. It's generally thought of a one of the worst in the recent era

DenverBroncos,3124bg,calc32004,2,Wed Apr 1 15:50:05 2015 UTC,I mean I agree it wasn't a great pick especially considering the other players we passed up for him but at the same time I don't think it's up there with some of the worst draft picks either. The guy did put in work after all.
DenverBroncos,3124bg,Anon_Alcoholc,2,Wed Apr 1 16:14:42 2015 UTC,It's hard not to consider him a bust. His career has been plagued with injuries. His 2013 was good but that doesn't make up for all his years of suckiness. It pretty much took him 5 years to learn you run through the whole the offensive line provides for you not to just go outside every time. He's awful when it comes to yards after contact. If he gets hit he goes down. He's a one year wonder.
DenverBroncos,3124bg,Drek49,2,Wed Apr 1 17:56:49 2015 UTC,"Im actually pretty happy Ayers is tearing it up somewhere else , they drafts him to play a position he was never meant to play which fucked him over"
DenverBroncos,3124bg,RPDBF,1 point,Wed Apr 1 19:51:33 2015 UTC,EXACTLY!!!   Everyone always tore Ayers up because he didn't come in and be what Von is now... but he was never a speed QB rusher guy at TEN. He was a steady DE that dominates the running game.
DenverBroncos,3124bg,bcos4life,5,Wed Apr 1 21:58:41 2015 UTC,"I wish I had gotten drafted by the Broncos... So your April Fools joke is a bust, like the five guys that I'm about to name.  No specific order, and keep in mind this is since I started watching football in 2003:  -Tim Tebow (don't mind that we drafted him, it's how early we drafted him)  -Maurice Clarett (no explanation needed)  -Robert Ayers (instead of Clay Matthews? Fuck Josh McDaniels)  -Quinton Carter (I could cut him slack because he was a fourth round pick, but he never stayed healthy and it seemed like a total waste pick who did have serious potential)  -Jarvis Moss (if you're a first round guy who ends up doing nothing, you have to be on the list).  There's mine."

DenverBroncos,3124bg,sLyReLoadZz,3,Wed Apr 1 18:42:31 2015 UTC,"I will argue one point regarding yours for the rest of my life with anyone that brings it up.  Maurice Clarett was a GREAT draft pick. Everyone always goes captain hindsight on this and says ""BUT HE SUCKED FOR US!!! HE NEVER EVEN PLAYED!!!""  But put yourself in a GM's shoes in this scenario.  You are a team that built on running. Your starting RB's are Droughns, Tatum Bell, and Q Griffin... not a bad stable. But you KNOW that if you get a real work horse, it can be like when you won the SB just 6 years earlier. You NEED a workhorse.   You come up to the draft WITHOUT a 1st round pick. Your first pick is late in the 2nd, and no RB has graded out to be that pick. Plus, you got bitch slapped by Peyton Manning last year because your secondary kind of sucks. You KNOW you have to focus this draft on your secondary.   You draft your corners that you need. It's getting towards the end of the 3rd round. And one name is still up there... a controversial one.  A guy that was DOMINANT at the last level... a Freshman, he led his team to a National Title. He has some serious off the field concerns, but maybe he's grown up. He is a little slow in the 40, but all of his film says he isn't slow. I mean, Jerry Rice ran a 4.7.   You know that if you hit on this pick, you might have just gotten a top 3 talent at #101... steal of the century for the draft. How dumb everyone else looks for not taking a flyer earlier on this guy.   To me: It always broke down to one thing:   Either Clarett came in, ran like a mofo, dominated the league for the next decade... or left the way he did... as a HUGE disappointment. To me, that's worth the last pick the 3rd round."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,bcos4life,2,Wed Apr 1 22:11:56 2015 UTC,"I remember how dominate the guy was in college, I just think that we all expected something out of it and instead of him coming in and trying he made stupid decisions that never even allowed him to take the field in the regular season. It's just frustrating."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,andrrrew,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:15:32 2015 UTC,"I felt like Clarett was either going to be a huge steal or a horrible decision, guess we know where that one went."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,Anon_Alcoholc,1 point,Wed Apr 1 16:16:14 2015 UTC,"Any player that's not a 1st/early 2nd round pick isn't that big of a bust. Carter is hardly a top 5 all time bust, he was a 4th round pick."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,TDenverFan,1 point,Wed Apr 1 17:36:34 2015 UTC,"I get what you're saying, it's just that he couldn't stay healthy. Not a bust, just a wasted pick. Like you said, busts are early round picks."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,andrrrew,1 point,Wed Apr 1 22:18:20 2015 UTC,"I wouldn't call Robert Ayers a bust, more like disappointing. He was a beast in the run game. He wasn't much of a pass rusher though but he seems to be picking it up with the Giants, so it could have been our system that was hindering him if anything.   Also, if Quinton Carter can count then I would vote for either Kayvon Webster or Montee Ball before him."
DenverBroncos,3124bg,VonillaMilla,2,Wed Apr 1 15:38:20 2015 UTC,It's the injury thing. Ayers had a hard time staying healthy and for being a first round pick I feel as though he didn't produce the way he should have. But I do understand that not all first rounders turn into stars. He'll always be average at best.
DenverBroncos,3124bg,andrrrew,0,Wed Apr 1 22:16:58 2015 UTC,I'm glad we didn't draft Clay Matthews. I have never been a fan of his I think he is extremely overrated. Plus we would not have drafted Von.

DenverBroncos,3124bg,peteisneat,1 point,Thu Apr 2 04:52:45 2015 UTC,My main issue with the pick of Osweiler is that one of the most productive college linebackers who was a 2x All American and at the time fit our 4-3 scheme perfectly got selected the very next pick.... Lavonte David... So instead of the potential of the two best OLB in football we get an overpaid backup QB.   Obviously hind sight is 20/20 but IMO that was a wiff

DenverBroncos,314a88,eme_pirrade,3,Wed Apr 1 22:11:43 2015 UTC,"I think you did better in the 2nd draft, TJ Clemmings would have an instant impact with us, as he'd get thrown into the starting oline. Randy Gregory just wouldn't see much playtime, with our linebacker corps looking like Ware-Trev-Marshall-Von, using a 1st round pick on a depth player doesn't seem like the best choice."
DenverBroncos,314a88,crueg,2,Wed Apr 1 22:57:47 2015 UTC,"I prefer the second draft myself, but I think pass-rushers are like cornerbacks or wide receivers, in that you need more than just starters. I also think that it's possible for Miller, Ware and Gregory (or another pass-rusher) to play together. I also viewed Gregory as an elite talent in this draft, especially for 3-4 teams, so for a team like us who typically picks in the back end of the 1st round to land him without completely selling the farm was an opportunity I felt I had to jump at."
DenverBroncos,314a88,CO_Boiler,2,Wed Apr 1 23:27:20 2015 UTC,"In trouble for smoking pot before the combine and we bring him where it's legal... Well hmm...   Honestly, all joking aside, it's not the pot, it to me shows his commitment issues because if you can't get yourself clean knowing you have the biggest opportunity of your life coming what does that show? He also flip flopped on colleges, so I just question him right now... He can change and I hope he does.  I agree that pass rushers are important, but I think in this case I'd rather have O-Line."
DenverBroncos,314a88,qergttj,2,Wed Apr 1 23:35:58 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I probably should be more concerned with Gregory's character, but I'm just not as of right now. Another positive test would change that, because we definitely don't want a Josh Gordon situation.

DenverBroncos,30zfpk,Schottey,17,Tue Mar 31 22:59:23 2015 UTC,Ummm... Good article right up until the point where the author took a shot at Welker as a free agent bust... I guess they didn't watch the 2013 season that I did. Absolutely uncalled for as well.
DenverBroncos,30zfpk,CO_Boiler,5,Wed Apr 1 02:08:49 2015 UTC,"""Bust"" is going too far, but 12 mil for 1,242 yards and 12 TDs over two years is a bit steep. Sanders just put up 1,404 yards and 9 TDs for 5 mil."
DenverBroncos,30zfpk,mysterious_pube,11,Wed Apr 1 02:25:35 2015 UTC,"His 2014 stats were poor, yes, but mainly because he was never targeted. But look at his 2013 stats, holy cow. He was a machine two years ago."
DenverBroncos,30zfpk,CO_Boiler,6,Wed Apr 1 02:29:28 2015 UTC,"778 yards and 10 TDs is a machine? He was good, but that's going way too far. Individually, Decker, DT, Moreno, and JT all had more total yards and more TDs. Welker was the least productive of all of them in the statistically greatest offense of all time. If he was a machine, I think he would have been more than the 5th most productive offensive player.  And he wasn't targeted in 2014 because he wasn't very good. He just can't get separation the way he used to.  If you think he has been a 12 mil guy, all right, but I just can't find a way to justify his salary."
DenverBroncos,30zfpk,mysterious_pube,6,Wed Apr 1 03:06:45 2015 UTC,"No not 12 mil. But the difference in yards comes from his play style. And yea his clutch-ness, and 3rd down conversions were like clock work. And I disagree, he was open a lot this year, but Peyton never had him as his first read and so he never targeted him because our line was so shitty.   You can't compare Welker to DT, a better comparison is actually JT who had 788 yards and 12 touchdowns, and missed games like Welker. Puts it in perspective doesn't it?"
DenverBroncos,30zfpk,CO_Boiler,2,Wed Apr 1 03:43:28 2015 UTC,"We can go back and forth all day, and it really wouldn't amount to much. We both agree Welker wasn't a free agent bust, and we both agree he wasn't worth 12 mil. That pretty much resolves the original point, so we might as well move on. Anything else is just quibbling over precisely how valuable he actually was, which isn't terribly important.   You can't compare Welker to DT, a better comparison is actually JT who had 788 yards and 12 touchdowns, and missed games like Welker. Puts it in perspective doesn't it?   If you want to go that route, all that does is show the 3rd/4th receivers had comparable production for one season. It still doesn't justify 12 mil in two years."
DenverBroncos,30zfpk,mysterious_pube,-4,Wed Apr 1 05:24:35 2015 UTC,"Welker is not a good fit with Peyton. Peyton's arm is weak and Welker's separation is not for a long period of time like Dt and Sanders are. I still think he has the ability, but Peyton's arm hinders him.  Brady-Welker was unstoppable because Brady would just throw as hard as he could to him every time and Brady's arm is pretty good."

DenverBroncos,30ybnk,dgapinski,10,Wed Apr 1 01:34:42 2015 UTC,"I think on this sub at least, we're all sold on CJ. It's a ""what have you done for me lately?"" league and CJ has produced the most and most recently. I think Ball will be in the best place to take over if the coaches feel CJ isn't repeating his play from last year, but at this point it is certainly his job to lose."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,fearboner,2,Tue Mar 31 18:33:10 2015 UTC,"Definitely agree. In terms of Ball, he was actually the worst running back in every metric I measured. Never liked him, and now I have numbers to prove why haha."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,fearboner,4,Tue Mar 31 18:34:33 2015 UTC,"Well, you have some numbers, but not all of them. I'd have liked the article better as a whole if it included all of Ball and Hillman's work and not just the limited reps they saw in the first half of this past season.  But still, I can see the effort and I don't think anyone around here is really going to argue that CJ isn't the top back coming into the next season."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,Elway_Be_Thy_Name,2,Tue Mar 31 23:34:59 2015 UTC,"I thought of including it but people may have considered piling it on. Based on our advanced metrics both Ball and Hillman have been pretty below average in the run game. And in terms of pass protection, Ball was even worse his rookie year than his sophomore year (I guess you could call it progress? Haha)"
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,caesarfecit,4,Wed Apr 1 01:34:12 2015 UTC,"See, I actually DO like Ball, but he isn't as elusive or explosive as CJ at all.  I think in the right system he could be ok, but CJ just makes plays happen and that is what we desperately need."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,Hayduke_Abides,15,Tue Mar 31 18:49:29 2015 UTC,"Agree, 100%.  The kid just doesn't quit, and I wish we had more players like him in the last playoff game.

Breaks 2 more tackles to get the first down only for DT and Sanders to be standing there like they aint getting paid millions to do their job.  Them two blocking would have given us a TD there, and shortened their lead/giving us momentum with Peyton fucking Manning.  Sorry.  Still in my feels about that game."

DenverBroncos,30ybnk,CO_Boiler,1 point,Wed Apr 1 05:01:44 2015 UTC,I think this is the play that convinced Elway to nuke the coaching staff. It's bittersweet to see CJ fight and everyone else disheartened and going through the motions.

Kubiak's zone-blocking scheme should help a ton in run blocking also. He's going to have an amazing season.
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,CO_Boiler,5,Tue Mar 31 18:28:54 2015 UTC,He should go into camp on top of the depth chart-he earned that.  After that its an open competition in my mind.

DenverBroncos,30ybnk,AskMeAboutMySwag69,2,Wed Apr 1 00:22:03 2015 UTC,We have so many guys fighting for this one job and it will be fantastic this season having three or four running backs all trying to be the number one guy. Don't forget when Ball went down Hillman stepped up and did great and said he would fight for the starting job when he was healthy. Then Hillman goes down and CJ goes beast mode on the league. For once in a long time we are going to enjoy having this runnin game and as long as our line shows up and we don't need a sixth blocker on the line again we can probably lead the league in rushing yards ( by a whole not one individual).
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,AdaAstra,2,Wed Apr 1 15:09:52 2015 UTC,Also helps that Julius Thomas isn't on the line 'blocking' anymore hah
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,Kman2220,2,Thu Apr 2 00:02:59 2015 UTC,"I just wanted to say one thing. I've always disliked us picking Ball, I almost went berserk when Lacy was on the board and we took Ball. And one of the biggest reasons to me, is Ball very rarely showed the ability to run behind his pads in college. Go watch any of his highlight tapes and when he is in the hole he is standing straight up like he is in the open field. Now couple that with his love of a spin move and you have a recipe for disaster. Again watch any highlight tape and you will see him spin probably 5 times, I'd rather he break him down with a hard side step or drop the shoulder, because when you turn your back to the play, and put your balance in a delicate spot, you are asking to get wrecked from behind and get injured and fumble.  Didn't like him then don't like him now, hopefully he can prove me wrong, but CJ is exactly the type of runner I like to see. Square shoulders, behind his pads, head up, keeps his body in the same direction as the play."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,VonillaMilla,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:36:19 2015 UTC,"Right there with you. I still remember watching Ball's college clips and not being impressed. Seemed to just be a bunch of short easy TD's behind a monster line. Lacy was probably higher on the Broncos board with respect to talent, but I think he had a foot injury that made Elway and crew take a pass. Hindsight's a MF'er."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,skay,2,Thu Apr 2 18:35:47 2015 UTC,"He had a lot of long runs in college but when your life averages 6'7"" 321 lbs... Yea you have holes I could run through. I watched him in person, and he ran all over my team yes, but literally there were holes all game that were 7 yards wide. Like I say, hopefully he proves me wrong, but if a team wanted to trade for him I would not be great broken at all to watch him go."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,TheMcDudeBro,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:55:00 2015 UTC,"Yup, 100% agree with you! Ball and CJ are just night and day from each other"
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,CalmingCollection,2,Fri Apr 3 15:44:10 2015 UTC,"I don't think there was a debate.  CJ Anderson will get a majority of the snaps, but we are not just going to have Ball, Hillman, and Thompson just sit on the bench the entire time.  Rotating all four of them into plays keeps the ground game guessing.  I still see CJ getting most, but I think it is more like him getting 40% and the others getting 20% here and there.  Depends on the defense and the type of play we need."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,Quiggibub,2,Tue Mar 31 18:51:30 2015 UTC,"That doesn't make much sense though. CJ is better than all of them in almost every aspect of the game. Hillman may have a bit better speed, Thompson may hit a bit harder. That's it though.   Aside from keeping CJ fresh there's no reason to bring anyone else in."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,jlange94,6,Tue Mar 31 20:01:51 2015 UTC,"Hence why CJ will still get a majority of the snaps.  CJ is good, but he is still has to deal with injury and fatigue just like everyone else in the league.  Rotating backs is a great way to combat this, while also giving the defenses a hard time of whether they should expect a run up the middle, sweep to the outside, or any variation of pass.  Thompson is better for being our pounder, Hillman for the speed, and Ball for a weaker version of both.  They will play when we need to give CJ a breather after a few plays or to throw off the defense."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,VonillaMilla,1 point,Tue Mar 31 20:11:19 2015 UTC,"I like this idea. It gives not only the run game more versatility, but the offense as a  whole. When the opposing D expects a sweep on the outside with Hillman, play action that shit and throw for the first down. On down and short, fake to Thompson and pass for positive yards. Using what we have for our advantage was something the coaching staff lacked sometimes these last years. Hopefully we'll see more consistency while being unpredictable."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,DasRoach,4,Tue Mar 31 23:34:27 2015 UTC,Kubiak tends to ride a single back though. Even in Baltimore he gave Forsett all the work
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,VonillaMilla,2,Tue Mar 31 20:32:18 2015 UTC,"Our RB to replace CJ in case he goes down due to injury is Thompson or Ball. I would say Thompson. I don't think Ronnie Hillman can be a starting RB in this league. He is just too damn lanky and can't do anything after initial contact. He can be a change of pace RB and that is about it, so I can see him earning the spell role but that is it."
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,DasRoach,2,Wed Apr 1 15:36:01 2015 UTC,Agreed. When Ball went down last year I was torn between grabbing CJ or Thompson and chose to spend my FAAB on CJ. To my amazement Ronnie got the starts for awhile but it paid off in the long run
DenverBroncos,30ybnk,von_bot,2,Thu Apr 2 00:05:12 2015 UTC,"With a healthy Ball, it will be nice to have some depth in the backfield. Seems like Denver will have some options next season. Stoked"

DenverBroncos,30z3rp,Greeney494,3,Wed Apr 1 00:00:48 2015 UTC,"His mechanics need work. Too often it looks like he's not stepping into the throw enough, and the ball hangs or sails high. Tends to throw off his back foot or falling backwards when under pressure. If those things aren't corrected, he's a INT machine in the NFL. Good enough arm. Really nice accuracy and touch at times but also seems to rely on his receivers to make plays for him. Sees the field pretty well. That offensive line really didn't give him much help.  There's enough there to justify a 6th rounder, I think, but he's got a long way to go to be an NFL starter.  Not really related, but Storm Woods is a kickass name."
DenverBroncos,30z3rp,mysterious_pube,3,Wed Apr 1 02:19:36 2015 UTC,"I've watched a lot of Oregon state games the past 3 years (almost all of them), and he's very inconsistent, his mechanics are above average for college qbs, his qb style is similar to Peyton's in my opinion. but honestly, I would be surprised if he got drafted at all. there are too many question marks and concerns."
DenverBroncos,30z3rp,liberator17,2,Wed Apr 1 19:50:40 2015 UTC,"Too many question marks.  When he had talent at WR he was very capable of tearing a defense apart with a shoddy line and no running game to balance it out.  When the WR talent left, he didn't have much to work with this year."
DenverBroncos,30z3rp,bananaboatshoes,2,Tue Mar 31 22:51:55 2015 UTC,Went to my rival HS. Carved us up on the last game of my career. It would be hard to root for him.  (But he is very good)
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,VonillaMilla,33,Tue Mar 31 13:36:24 2015 UTC,Five. Behind all of the teams that you listed at this point.
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,andrrrew,3,Tue Mar 31 14:01:03 2015 UTC,"We most definitely could take out Green Bay. As ever, their defense is pretty suspect. I'm not convinced at all after that debacle of a NFCC.   We could beat them. Especially being as balanced as we are trying to be."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,drax117,13,Tue Mar 31 20:43:30 2015 UTC,I believe we could beat anybody. It just depends on which Denver Broncos team shows up.

DenverBroncos,30x9zh,mack2nite,1 point,Wed Apr 1 15:52:10 2015 UTC,"I agree. Mostly because Denver will be installing a brand new offense and defense. Talent is still there, but can't honestly put the team any higher until they perform under Kube's and Wade."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,aatencio91,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:38:50 2015 UTC,"I would consider 6th, possibly behind the Ravens/Steelers."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,buck3ts,3,Tue Mar 31 15:54:33 2015 UTC,I would say no to Balt/Pitt. The Ravens have some turnover on offense with the coaching staff and personnel. Same with the Steelers on D.
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Fridden,1 point,Tue Mar 31 18:31:48 2015 UTC,And we don't? We lost like half our team this off-season.
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,myshkingfh,10,Thu Apr 2 14:21:09 2015 UTC,"I thought I would have them lower but I can't find more than five or six teams I would rank ahead of Denver. I'm not as sold as some people on teams like Az, Pittsburgh, Baltimore, or Cincinnati.   I think the defense is going to be really good and I don't see why the offense should be much worse than last year. I think even Brock would have us winning the AFCW comfortably. I'm going to need to see some real improvement on the offensive line, but I think I will.   People want to concentrate on Manning's health and pay no attention to how good the rest of the team is."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,the_denver_nugs,7,Tue Mar 31 14:51:53 2015 UTC,I don't see why everybody is so down on us.  I personally only see us below the seahawks.  Yes we lost JT buthe wouldn't fit our new scheme anyways.  We are switching to a more run heavy scheme that is proven to be more effective in winning superbowls.  We lost Rahim but he was only above average and can be filled without to much loss to the defense.  We still have the draft to work on dline and linebacker depth.  we still have 2 top receivers and hopefully the emergence of a third.  Mannings decline was shown to have been from an injury.
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,crueg,5,Tue Mar 31 18:11:30 2015 UTC,"probably somewhere from the 4-9 range. I think the pack is still a better team than us, and the pats lost a lot of their big names too, but that hasn't stopped them in the past. right now i'd say the order is something like this: 1) packers 2) pats 3) seahawks 4) colts 5) us 6) cards 7) cowboys.  I think if we get someone like Humphries or Erving or another quality olineman in the draft we won't be in that bad of shape"
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Dbash56,4,Tue Mar 31 18:10:12 2015 UTC,"6, behind:   NE SEA GB IND BAL"

DenverBroncos,30x9zh,gooseyoustud,9,Tue Mar 31 14:47:22 2015 UTC,I'd say we are probably a top 10 team. Maybe 7th or 8th?
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,MurrayPloppins,5,Tue Mar 31 15:07:12 2015 UTC,"I think this is a much more accurate assessment. We lost pieces on defense and the o-line, really have yet to upgrade anything. People downvote anything but blind optimism in this sub, but an honest assessment would have us behind at least NE, SEA, GB, and Indy. I also put us behind Miami, and possibly AZ, PIT, and BAL."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,baha24,2,Tue Mar 31 18:28:34 2015 UTC,"Mmm...I would put us even with NE as of now, to be honest. They lost Revis, Browner, Ayers, and Wilfork on defense, as well as Ridley and Vereen on offense. Of course, they'll always be competitive with Brady/Belichick, but unless they draft well and/or find gems in FA that all 31 other teams have overlooked, they won't be anywhere near the level they were last season.  Also, Miami got Suh, but at the expense of their offense: they lost their two starting receivers and tight end, which will put a ton of pressure and attention on Kenny Stills to carry the load unless they draft another WR. Honestly, if Buffalo and NY Jets could get solid QBs, they could steamroll the AFC East this year."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,MurrayPloppins,2,Wed Apr 1 02:07:57 2015 UTC,"I actually think Miami's offense is now better than it was before. If Jordan Cameron stays healthy (big question mark, to be fair) he's a MONSTER, probably better than Clay (who the Bills way overpaid for). Jarvis Landry is gonna be great at WR, and I think Kenny Stills will fit nicely into the role Mike Wallace was playing. And then that defense is straight up terrifying.  NE I basically just give the benefit of the doubt as reigning champs, but it's worth noting that finding diamond-in-the-rough FA's has always been one of Belichik's neat tricks. And losing Ridley and Vereen means nothing in that offense, I think. Blount and Cadet will easily pick up that slack.  I agree Buffalo is basically just a solid QB away from contending, but it's been that way for years and I don't think Rex Ryan is the guy to fix it for them unfortunately. And the Jets are just kinda meh. I don't think Geno is consistent enough for that offense to work and the defense minus Rex Ryan will not do as well. Ironic that he's a weakness for both the team he left and the team he joined."

DenverBroncos,30x9zh,IMERMAIDMANonYT,4,Tue Mar 31 13:58:38 2015 UTC,"I know the colts have a lot of new weapons, but I'm just not sold they can use them to their full potential.

DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Fridden,2,Wed Apr 1 20:29:20 2015 UTC,Top 10. We lost so much this off-season. But not top 5 probably lower end of 10.
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Sherlod,2,Thu Apr 2 14:19:44 2015 UTC,"I've only really started to get into Football so from my point of view I would put us behind the seahawks, patriots, colts and possibly the packers leaving us in 4th/5th. Although that will soon change when the season kicks off! :D"
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,caesarfecit,1 point,Tue Mar 31 16:00:04 2015 UTC,"I'd put us in the top ten on the strength of what's still on the roster.  But we can't escape the fact that our QB is showing his age, our coaching staff got nuked, and we lost some key players with unproven replacements.   And there's still a lot of quality teams out there without the question marks we have.  We have a lot of upside, but we need to prove it before we can fairly call ourselves a top team. We're a contender, but we still have to earn respect after the disappointments of the Fox era. We have to be more than a team with a stacked roster and gaudy stats."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Big_Pete1999,-1,Thu Apr 2 21:28:22 2015 UTC,"Until further notice, I rank the Broncos middle of the NFL.  New Coach   New Scheme  Jettison of quality players  Not replacing quality players in FA  Unknown offensive line to protect a 39 year old QB  Having a 39 year old QB who shows to fizzle out as the season progresses.  Unknown draft picks.  Too many holes for this team to be ranked any higher than around 12-15 in the NFL. Yes, all teams have holes, but most are at least attempting to address them. Elway seems content to allow these holes to remain. smh"

DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Big_Pete1999,-1,Tue Mar 31 22:28:29 2015 UTC,"Spoiler, it didn't help the Broncos win a single playoff game (at home no less) last year. By my count that at a minimum puts them 8-12 range from a pure ""I love my team, but I also live in the real world"" view point."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Kman2220,6,Tue Mar 31 22:51:47 2015 UTC,"And  a ""real world"" standpoint, the broncos were simply out coached in that single playoff game. Talib on Hilton? Why wouldn't you go with what worked that first game of the 2014 season? Our Qb was off because the staff didn't take initiative to rest his injury. I believe with this new staff, balls out is what they'll bring to the team. We have talented players, if not the most on an NFL team. Show some deserved respect. Winning a superbowl isn't an often occasion. Hell patriots won because the other team's coaching staff fucked it up. Stop being skeptical."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Big_Pete1999,-1,Tue Mar 31 23:27:13 2015 UTC,"And how many playoff games as Kubiak won exactly? It's either zero or one. So don't assume we couldn't be out coached again.  Look, I have orange colored glasses too. I'm just seeing a major jettison in talent and that never sits well with me when we don't sign our home grown talent that played really well."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Kman2220,5,Wed Apr 1 00:24:21 2015 UTC,"Did Kubiak have a Peyton Manning and other talent on his other teams to compare? No. Any coach would be blessed to have this team. If you don't have anything positive to say, become a raiders fan you joke."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,myshkingfh,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:55:15 2015 UTC,Spoiler - all those pro bowl quality players may not have earned a championship but the question asked wasn't whether Denver just won the super bowl. That talent puts them a lot higher than middle of the pack.
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Big_Pete1999,2,Tue Mar 31 23:10:20 2015 UTC,"Pro Tip: paper offseason ranking mean jack squat ESPECIALLY after getting their asses handed to them by a team that shouldn't have even been able to compete.   Want to go by your ""pro bowl"" caliber player count to determine the best team? Troll the Eagles page from a few years ago. ""Dream Team"" remember? Or the 2004-5 ""Dream Team"" Redskins that had all the pro bowlers you could shake a stick at and still sucked.   Sorry, but here in the real world, results on the field matter more than the names listed on a piece of paper. The Broncos, the last time we saw them, played like a team that belongs in the 12-15 range AND THEY ONLY GOT WORSE THIS OFFSEASON!   If you want to be a blind homer and proclaim 19-0 in 2015, be my guest. I'll toast to that! But those pipe dreams hardly make it so. As painful as it is for you to hear me say they are a middle of the pack team is only slightly less painful than having to actually put it in words as I eat, sleep, and breath the Broncos."

DenverBroncos,30x9zh,CO_Boiler,1 point,Wed Apr 1 00:00:35 2015 UTC,"So exactly how many holes are there that we didn't replace our have replacements in the system for? And by the way you keep mentioning in the real world, in the real world the Broncos have to pay for players, and the cap room is low, and actual cash I believe is even lower because of cash flows of an NFL team. So when you spout off about the real world and Elway being content to sit with gaping holes, maybe you should hit a reality check too and realize they are doing pretty damn good this off season considering the restraints and the talent already on the team, combined with the guys we had in the pipe line to take these spots."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Thu Apr 2 17:44:53 2015 UTC,"Trust me, I have my finger on the pulse of every transaction they have going on. Just barely below the bat phone that Elway uses.  Anyway, I'm done arguing. If you want practice squad guys as starters for Manning, then hey, the Broncos have no holes. If you want that and think that, then there is zero point in arguing it with you because your idea of a quality starter is vastly different than mine.  No cap room and cash room? We had enough early on and we sat and watch marquis player after marquis player get signed for pennies on the dollar while Elway saved maybe $250k for a scrub player. Those are HORRIBLE choices."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,CO_Boiler,1 point,Thu Apr 2 18:07:52 2015 UTC,"We have just over 1 million in workable cap, if you have your finger on the pulse you would see they have done a damn good job at filling holes with what they have. If it was your scenario a) we would easier have 12 million sitting around somewhere, or b) we would have JT and nobody else with legitimate holes.  Also, idk if you know this or not but there are a lot of players that aren't first round guys that are starters in the NFL... Wild I know... It's almost like teams can't afford to have all of their players that way, and they choose what players they want to spend money on. As for practice players protecting manning? If they are good great, otherwise we have 9 draft picks coming, and I'm pretty sure they are going to go after some players who they think can contribute immediately."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Big_Pete1999,1 point,Thu Apr 2 19:51:47 2015 UTC,"Did I say we could NOW get guys? No.  Feb 10th was a LONG TIME AGO! We could have done multiple things then.

Packers run D is just crap, there is a reason why Kaepernick or anyone can run for that matter owns that defense. Patriots lost Browner and Revis who were the biggest reasons why the Patriots defense was good last season. We saw how their defense was in the 2013 AFC Championship game without any CBs, it was good for us."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,emonstar,1 point,Tue Mar 31 21:59:58 2015 UTC,"The Packers D actually came into its own towards the end of last season, and most importantly they're not losing anyone. When that team is on, they are the best team in the league. I have the Packers as #1 on my Power Rankings, if it weren't for Rodgers tweaking his hammy they probably would've been in the Super Bowl and could've easily won.  With respect to the Patriots....this is exactly what I meant by hopeless optimism. Every year I always think ""This is the year the Patriots regress"", but it never happens. I'd love to think losing those key acquisitions is going to set the Patriots back and make them look human, but I just can't believe it. I assume the Patriots will win the Super Bowl next year, because I have been so severely punished for optimism before. The Patriots have made 4 AFC Championship games in a row. I truly believe they will find a way to be the best team in the AFC next year."
DenverBroncos,30x9zh,Bilyman,1 point,Tue Mar 31 22:06:47 2015 UTC,"Their defense did get better, but it still sucks. There is a reason why Seattle came back and it is because they stopped being idiots and starting given Lynch the ball.   I don't think the hammy did anything in the Seattle game. He just can't do anything against Seattle, probably because of his mindset. He is always looking for the big play and Seattle is the best at not allowing it.   If you thought the Pats were going to regress in 2014 with the additions of Revis, Browner, and LaFell then you were delusional. With their CBs gone and having no above average CB, we saw what happened in the 2013 championship game when Talib went out for them."

He has overcome so much and has become one of the greatest QB's of all time. He worked his ass off like none other to get where he is, he has a super model wife to top it all off. He has effectively won life and any hate for him I see it as jealousy, I mean who is not jealous of him? So yea fuck your down votes fuck the Patriot hate circle jerk its old as fuck now."

This guy is simply a monster. You can move him inside on a guard or center or move him outside on the tackle and it won't matter he will dominate the play.

Then when he ""retired"" and flopped around on the decision he made those commercials with him buying a TV, ""Ok, I'll take it. Well, maybe not. Well, maybe, I don't know.

Player that I was actually alive to watch: Danny Woodhead.  I saw him play in college and he single handedly won that game.  Since then it has been fun to watch him bounce around the league and be that little wrecking ball.  He seems endlessly positive and genuinely thrilled to be where he is, makes it that much more fun to watch.  Even though he did play in New England for a while....grrrr."

DenverBroncos,30pi36,Greeney494,5,Sun Mar 29 16:09:28 2015 UTC,"Dude was a complete back, and without a doubt the best RB in 1998.

It's easy to pick TD after Elway, but the other greats just can't be forgotten; the Smiths (yes the guy from KC too), meklenberg, Atwater, Champ, Sharpe, crazy romanowski, Eddie Mac... Damn I guess I'm pretty much tossing the 97-98 rosters out there.  Well shit, I can't pick a greatest after Elway.  Damn you for toying with my emotional nostalgia OP."

But I think if Portis had stayed in Denver, he'd have ended up with better numbers, kid was a beast at Mile High.  That being said, I've gotta go with Rod Smith. In my opinion, probably the best Cinderella story in the past couple of decades and a real class act."

The fact that the man came out of nowhere and surprised everyone with his skills (much like CJ) was awesome enough, but the fact that he did that well was amazing.   I wish his career could have gone on for a longer period of time. Maybe everyone would have agreed to say he was the greatest RB of all time."

If we factor in longevity and multiple seasons, hard not to go with Champ Bailey though. It is just a shame because we only had 3 good teams surrounded by him, two of them were choke jobs (05 Steelers, 12 Ravens), and one was just a disaster and he was injured all season (13 Seahawks)."

DenverBroncos,30pi36,ilyearer,2,Mon Mar 30 17:42:28 2015 UTC,"It's different, Elway was our own he was homegrown, TD is a success story and is nothing but a Bronco. I love PFM as much as the next guy but the only way I see him retiring as a Bronco is if we wins back to back super bowls, and I don't see him coming back after this year so even if we get it done this year he will likely retire a Colt. So TLDR IMO Peyton will always be a Colt."

Plus some of the water bottles used by the SGK foundation have BPA in it, and they tried to downplay  the link between BPA and breast cancer despite the evidence that it does.  Plus SGK CEO Brinker let her personal politics interfere with funding Planned Parenthood. The funding that was cut provided funding for 170,000 breast exams.  Fuck the SGK foundation.

Just amazing what the Broncos could do when everyone was on the same page.  I thought this was funny though - Manning alternated salutations for everyone that he thanked after walking back to the bench:  Thank you buddy, thanks man,  thank you buddy, thanks a lot, thank you buddy, thanks brother..."
DenverBroncos,30mv4o,_Exaybachay_,3,Sat Mar 28 21:45:46 2015 UTC,I agree. I was so proud of the way we played that game. We were firing on all cylinders. If we can play like that on a consistent basis this year then I think it's safe to say we'll win another Super Bowl.
DenverBroncos,30mv4o,andrrrew,2,Sat Mar 28 23:37:21 2015 UTC,"I've got my fingers crossed, and I believe that Kubes and the rest of the new staff will be a breath of fresh air.  If he can manage keeping Peyton from playing too much (as he has stated he will be trying to do) then I really think we could make a deep run and maybe go all the way.  If you look at our roster, we still have tons of pro-bowlers, and I think the new coaches will be much better able to utilize their talent (and everyone else's)."
DenverBroncos,30mv4o,_Exaybachay_,3,Sun Mar 29 00:27:47 2015 UTC,"I have absolutely nothing to contribute, but I just wanted to say that I was at that game and the energy in the stadium was off the hook.  We didn't intentionally plan on being at that game for the record breaking TD pass, it just worked out like that. Our seats were right in the corner, it felt like DT was running towards us when he caught that pass.   So basically, thanks for bringing back a great memory. This gave me such a rush!"

It was really cool to see Plummer play even on TV, but it would have been something else to see it in person - not to mention seeing a living legend like Manning when he broke an all-time record!"
DenverBroncos,30mv4o,_Exaybachay_,2,Sun Mar 29 00:30:18 2015 UTC,"Yeah we felt super lucky to be there. If you ever get the chance to go to a home game, I highly recommend it!  I love in SoCal and I'm surrounded by Charger fans all the time. So to go to a game and be surrounded by Bronco Bros was amazing. It feels good to belong :)  I lived in Denver for The Elway Years, but was too young to really appreciate it. Wish I could've seen him play IRL!  You gotta put Denver home game on your bucket list!  Maybe this year?"
DenverBroncos,30mv4o,taratorial,1 point,Sun Mar 29 19:26:53 2015 UTC,"This would be the most ideal year to do it for sure!  I will see if it's something I could figure out - I do vacation for a week in Denver every year, but this year I'm going to DEFCON, which is likely going to cost me a good chunk of money in August...  Maybe I can do both though, and man it would be worth it to see PFM before he retires.    Not to mention the rest of the team, who I think are badasses in other ways - soooo much talent all around, and I really believe that Kubes and Phillips will be able to make it show this year.  PS: Sorry you are surrounded by Chargers fans - at least you don't have to deal with Raiders fans :)  Not to mention I'm sure the weather is amazing there.  BTW I live in Alaska, so it's going to be a challenge to get there - plane tickets alone are usually like 600 bucks or more..."

D line, Neil Smith, Rulon Jones, Rich Jackson all stand out. Punter, tom Rouen, kicker Jason Elam, that's an easy one. Throw in Rick Upchurch for KR/PR and you've got special teams pretty well locked down. Perhaps Louie Wright at the corner across from Champ, a highly underrated and freakishly athletic player.

Let me start off by throwing out some guys this sub probably are not familiar with:   DE: Rich ""Tombstone"" Jackson. If you do this list and he isn't one of your starting DE, you are wrong. I know, we have to respect all opinions and all that. But you are wrong. Tombstone was dominant and if he hadn't had his knee injury, he would have been the first Bronco in the hall of fame. Paul Zimmerman put Jackson as a starting defensive end on his ALL TIME team.   Punt Returner - Rick Upchurch - One of the top 10 return men in the history of the league. A truly special player.   Lionel Taylor - First man to ever catch 100 passes in a season? That would be Lionel Taylor. He did most of his damage in the AFL, but it doesn't diminish just how dominant of a player he was. He led the league in receptions for 6 consecutive years, catching 508 balls in the process. Like Broncos great Rod Smith, Taylor was an undrafted FA.   Goose Gonsoulan - His interception stats rank right up there with any hall of famer of his era. He was a six time AFL All Star and the career interceptions leader of the AFL. (43)   Obviously, the players of 97 and 98 are going to dominate this list for most people and rightly so. I'd just encourage everyone to remember some of the other all time greats of this franchise."

DenverBroncos,30o4ct,bcos4life,7,Mon Mar 30 18:28:17 2015 UTC,"QB:   PFM- Close, but PFM has been better later in his career.  John Elway- Anyone that doesn't realize that he is a top 3 NFL QB all time has no clue how great he was. You can't compare stats between him and Manning... Two different styles in two different era's.  Tebow- Fuck it   RB:   TD- Greatest playoff RB ever. Yeah, his window was short, but damn it was good. Floyd Little- The Franchise kept the Broncos in Denver. One of the most overlooked RB's ever. Mike Anderson- Not flashy, but a versatile guy that has no fear. You need that at this point for a RB3.   FB:   Howard Griffith- No Griffith = No 2,000 yard season.   WR:   Rod Smith- No the biggest, fastest, or strongest. But he outworked everybody. Dominant WR at times... and his best years came AFTER Elway.  Bay Bay Thomas- He's just hitting his stride, but he is so damn dominant. He needs to keep that ""Give-a-shit"" at max level, but when he is at his best, he is uncoverable.  Brandon Marshall- I know a lot of people want to see Eddie Mac here, but he doesn't make my team. I love Eddie, but a big bodied WR is covered by B-Marsha and D.T.  Lionel Taylor- #2 all time WR in Broncos history, and he did it in the running era.    TE:   Shannon Sharpe- Awesome. Dwayne Carswell- Loved ""House""  Riley Odoms- Nothing flashy, but consistent.    LT:   Clady- Everyone sees him as declining. I see him as someone returning from a tough injury. He'll be back to form next year. Matt Lepsis- Embodied what we needed at LT during the SB years.    LG:    STINK   C:    Tom Nalen- One mean S.O.B. Ben Hamilton- Don't forget this guy. He was so solid for so long. Plus, he can cover all three interior line jobs.    RG:    Louis Vasquez- I know he's only been here for a little while, but at RG, he is top tier. Dan Neil- Pretty much our SB winning OL. Neil was a great RG.   RT:   Gary Zimmerman- An NFL HOF'er at LT, and I can swing him to RT??? Hells yeah."

DenverBroncos,30o4ct,essee-bro,0,Sun Mar 29 20:02:26 2015 UTC,"I will use the same argument for this, as I've been using for every conversation regarding JT for the last 6 months.  JT is an amazing pass catcher... no doubt. But playing TE is a lot more than catching the ball. JT wasn't just incapable of blocking, he didn't care about it. I hear many people on this sub, and in /r/nfl say ""He's only been playing football for 5 years! Blocking takes a long time to learn!"" But with the exception of the cheap shot on the DE for the Cardinals, I've rarely see him give anything more than a solid first step in blocking. I'm not even bringing up his injury past.   Carswell was a DOMINANT blocker for us. He was so dominant that he was moved to tackle for a while, but got moved back when we injuries forced us to move a 330 lbs. guy to TE. What Carswell brought to the table isn't as easily measured.   If Shannon wasn't an option, I would take JT in a minute, but on this ""dream team"", I got to pick people I like. I don't like J.T. The guy did nothing wrong. He played like he wanted, put up great numbers, and got himself paid. He owes NO allegiance to Denver, just as Denver owes him no loyalty either. But that doesn't mean I have to like him.   In the end, it's personal preference. If you think JT is a top TE on this team's history, put him on your team. He just isn't what I want on mine."

I can't decide if it's more common to see people overhyping local guys around here or to see people shitting on someone every time they bring up a local player.

Maybe getting some bigger and thicker Linebackers could really help and  suit the 3-4 inside backer.   Not saying Trevathan and Marshall won't, however, but they do have some concerns with the punishment a 3-4 inside backer takes. They deal more with big ass offensive lineman and trying to stuff run gaps, so they do take a lot of punishment.  I would like to see Flowers or Erving with the first pick however."
DenverBroncos,30kk9s,skullyD,3,Sat Mar 28 05:26:59 2015 UTC,"With it being a deep OL draft, I'd be okay with an ILB in the first, I think. While I love Trevathan and Marshall, we can't ignore that Trevathan has had three injuries to the same knee in a short time and when he and Marshall were out @Cincinnati the Broncos were carved the fuck up right up the middle. Depth is never bad, especially at linebacker, and with Trevathan both coming off an injury and closing in the end of his contract, thinking about replacing him could be good."
DenverBroncos,30kk9s,aatencio91,2,Sat Mar 28 07:01:33 2015 UTC,This is sadly true. I love Trevathan but the Broncos are probably preparing for the worst in that he may never come back and meet his potential. Some guys just get hurt a lot.

Literally an Orlando Franklin clone, except better looking.  Erving is actually kind big for a Center, which I think is good. He can play any position on the line, and we all know how much the FO likes flexibility with positional changes on the O-line, however he is best suit at Center. Better suited for protection in the running game, pass pro is bad, but could use some tweaking. His footwork is a little slow, and he struggles with the bull rush, but those are things that can be easily fixed, especially with Kubiak and Dennison being offensive lineman gurus."

Considering the DL only needs 3 players, Wolfe-Jackson-Sylvester, the LB corps only needs depth at this point. Tbh in this system they don't need to draft a top tier prospect in the position so long as they find a guy they like and can fit the scheme."

DenverBroncos,30hsw6,VonillaMilla,17,Fri Mar 27 14:28:18 2015 UTC,It's good to see that the coaching staff is already fixing problems from last year. Can't wait to see what Kubiak + Manning do this year
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,Infinity_Phantom,12,Fri Mar 27 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"One other concession Kubiak will make for young man Manning: The coach will bend his offensive system to fit the quarterback's skill set rather than have the quarterback fit the coach's scheme.  ""I'm the one who has to adjust and find out how I'm going to mesh everything together,"" Kubiak said. ""That's what we've been doing, and I told Peyton that from the start. We are going to run his offense and do what he does best, but it's going to be the Broncos' offense.  ""Obviously, I love to run the ball, and I love the play pass. I love to do those things, so there is going to be a commitment there, but there is 17 years of investment in what he's done better than anybody, and we're not going to run away from that."""

DenverBroncos,30hsw6,autowikibot,1 point,Mon Mar 30 21:20:52 2015 UTC,"Play-action pass:       A play-action pass (also known as the play fake or simply play-action) is a type of American football play. The play action appears to be a running play, but is actually a pass play; in this way, it can be considered the opposite of a draw play. Play-action passes are often used against defenses that are focused on stopping the run. By initially simulating a running play, the offense attempts to deceive the defense into acting on the fake run and being out of position in their pass coverage, giving receivers more time and room to be free to receive passes behind the linebackers.

DenverBroncos,30hsw6,MillerTime58,9,Mon Mar 30 21:21:40 2015 UTC,"The key to this working is Manning needs be more of a game manager in this system, not throw 99% of the time.  Manning is only good when he gets in a rhythm so Kubes is gonna have to find a way balance run with pass so PFM doesn't get rusty out there."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,denverfan79,1 point,Fri Mar 27 15:39:16 2015 UTC,"I hate to be negative, but this is exactly why I have a tough time figuring out how this is going to work. This goes right back to the NE game in 2013, the one with the massive Brady comeback - because we ran, ran, ran, Manning couldn't find a rhythm in the second half. We had exactly the same problem in a lot of the big games in the second half of the season this year. I just don't see how Manning, age 39, is suddenly going to overcome this in a Kubiak-style offence. He either plays Peyton-ball amazingly well, or nothing. He isn't a good ""game manager"" and never will be."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,Zosoer,1 point,Sat Mar 28 11:09:28 2015 UTC,"Peyton played bad in that game because of the weather and also because we played a hurry up style on the run. We were snapping up with 20 seconds left in that game.   In the 2013 playoffs, we did run the ball and we managed the time much better and it got us to the Superbowl."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,irishsandman,6,Sat Mar 28 18:51:20 2015 UTC,Kubes and Manning together. Who would have thunk it?
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,LimpHarness,6,Fri Mar 27 14:42:40 2015 UTC,"I'm not sure how I feel about this. I guess it depends on whether or not that's what Fox/Gase did the last couple years. I sort of feel like it was.  I'd rather see us focus on a mixed run/pass offense to keep defenses guessing, rather than whiff on 3 and out passing passing attempts. I don't think Manning's trickery is as effective as it used to be.   We have some effective RBs that can take some of the pressure off Manning. I also don't mind seeing Brock go in from time to time to spell Manning or attempt deeper passes. I want to be unpredictable next year, because I feel like we've been too easy to scheme for going up against good D's in recent years."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,CO_Boiler,3,Fri Mar 27 17:41:31 2015 UTC,"I agree.  I know that everyone saw how the safety's and corners pretty much figured Manning out and knew he couldn't go over the top.  We need to take pressure off of him, and I just not sold on Kubiak to do that if we are running the same ol' Manning offense."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,lordcheeto,5,Fri Mar 27 18:18:13 2015 UTC,"... He said that he isn't going to run away from what manning does well but they are going to be committed to the run and the play action. If you listen to his interviews this week he tells about using the boot leg, and the pistol so that the back is behind the QB and less predictable. Not to mention how he has talked about blending them together. He isn't saying it's Peyton's offense, he's not saying it's the Kubiak offense, he's saying they are blending them together into the Broncos offense.  I just don't see how that comes out to ""the same ole Peyton offense"""
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,Midnight06,2,Fri Mar 27 19:10:03 2015 UTC,Bad title.
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,_SuperManning,2,Fri Mar 27 22:17:15 2015 UTC,"This is probably the last time anyone will ever get to see a Peyton offense.  I think Kubiak realizes that he needs to go with it and see how it works, if not, next year he can implement his offense if Peyton is gone.  Let the old guy have a run of the place and see what happens I say."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,h3isenburg,1 point,Fri Mar 27 21:21:22 2015 UTC,"Really good to hear that they are on good terms and won't be clashing over offensive ideologies like Manning, Gase and Fox supposedly were."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,Gurtang,-1,Fri Mar 27 22:46:38 2015 UTC,"Same problem, different year:   Can our o-line give PFM at least 2 seconds? Running game is still under Q D only plays well against garbage offenses.  special team? what special team?   let's see how this year goes."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,drax117,-1,Fri Mar 27 21:13:57 2015 UTC,Well I sure hope that doesn't mean an offense that comes un short in the playoffs.
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,Razaman56,-1,Fri Mar 27 15:02:21 2015 UTC,"I fully agree with everyone's concerns. We HAVE been running Peytons offense. Just look at the plays. Look at the plays he ran in Indy. We are running HIS offense.   The problem is, as others have touched on, is that Peyton's trickery does NOT work anymore, not against top 10 defenses. He can still shred bad defenses, with weak DB's, but anyone in the top 10 KNOWS how to shut him down. We've seen it. We saw it last year.   Its time Peyton tries something new."
DenverBroncos,30hsw6,TyranosaurusLex,1 point,Sat Mar 28 05:08:28 2015 UTC,You realize it was the same offense that broke all those records and got us to the Super Bowl just over a year ago right?

As /u/crueg mentioned, Talib should not have been on TY Hilton, Harris Jr should have been.  Talib for the big receivers he can more easily use his press coverage on, Harris Jr on the smaller, quicker receivers."
DenverBroncos,30hu3l,spndl1,2,Fri Mar 27 14:55:30 2015 UTC,"This. You can't ask for a better contrasting set of starting CBs. And they're both very good at what they do, provided they're not misused."
DenverBroncos,30hu3l,caesarfecit,14,Sat Mar 28 09:31:15 2015 UTC,Nah I think they'll both stay at CB :P  but that colts game was more of JDR's massive misuse of talent and personnel.
DenverBroncos,30hu3l,crueg,4,Fri Mar 27 14:42:42 2015 UTC,"Im not sure how son of Bum uses his CB's, but I think Harris should ALWAYS be on the guy with wheels rather than Talib. It was embarassing spending that much money on our stacked D and not utilizing the talent the correct way. I hope someone earns that other safety spot. EARNS IT, and not handed to the guy out of lack of better options."
DenverBroncos,30hu3l,troubledhumans,5,Fri Mar 27 15:01:54 2015 UTC,"There is no reason why Talib should have been playing off-coverage on TY Hilton. JDR is a joke.   Anyways, I imagine Harris and Talib will just stay on one side of the field and maybe Harris continues to be moved to the slot in nickel situations."
DenverBroncos,30hu3l,VonillaMilla,2,Fri Mar 27 15:06:40 2015 UTC,"Say what you will about the reasons we lost, but VonillaMilla is still correct in his comment.  It was UTTER stupidity to have Talib on Hilton, regardless if JDR's other decisions weren't as stupid.    Harris implied it himself, and just about every neutral observer--such as Football Outsiders, who dissected that game to look for the reasons we lost--said the exact same thing.  It was also how NE beat us in the regular season (JDR stubbornly kept Talib on Edleman)."
DenverBroncos,30hu3l,United_In_Orange,2,Fri Mar 27 16:40:11 2015 UTC,"When did I say otherwise? Defense was bad too and JDR continued to show how terrible of a DC he is. Putting Talib on Hilton, playing 12 yards deep is pretty dumb especially when Harris is faster and when Talib is a press corner. Luck having all day to throw because Ware and Miller were gassed and because the pass rush and playcall was predictable.   Colts scored 24 points for a reason. Take your Spanish elsewhere."

DenverBroncos,30hl9s,TheClayroo,18,Fri Mar 27 14:14:34 2015 UTC,"McCoy. He was able to rework his offense for Tebow during the middle of a season. Let's be honest, Peyton makes every offensive coordinator look good. Mike McCoy made Tim Tebow look average. Which is more than he will probably ever be as a QB in the NFL. And no disrespect to Tim, it was a fun ride."

DenverBroncos,30hl9s,lojician,2,Sun Mar 29 18:57:23 2015 UTC,"McCoy and its not all that close IMO  I should say that I'm basing this partly on his success as a HC. But to me, McCoy had better game plans.  With Gase, it seemed like if the screen pass to DT wasn't working, our whole game was fucked.   Gase also said previously that it hurt his soul to run the football, which is just... well I'll let you guys interpret that."
DenverBroncos,30hl9s,fthflyer,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:55:19 2015 UTC,"It depends, McCoy was definitely more versatile, but he definitely held the offense back in the beginning of 2012, before letting Peyton do what he really wanted to do.   Gase's aggression was better suited to the Broncos than McCoy but that doesn't necessarily mean that he is better in a vacuum."

DenverBroncos,30fgun,aatencio91,8,Fri Mar 27 16:28:18 2015 UTC,But why Eddie royal? Shouldn't he be practicing with whoever his starting qb is?
DenverBroncos,30fgun,CryBerry,15,Thu Mar 26 23:35:44 2015 UTC,By that logic Latimer shouldn't be practicing with Brock either. My guess is they're all just happy to be able to run some routes and get some passes in.

DenverBroncos,30fgun,i_enjoy_lemonade,1 point,Fri Mar 27 06:43:05 2015 UTC,"I think the lack of an extension for Brock so far proves the the team isn't sold on him yet.  They should have enough practice footage to make a decision.  If he sees a handful of starts this year and plays well, his price will go up considerably.  I find it difficult to believe Brock wouldnt except a 3yr deal at 4M annually if it were offered, and I find it even more difficult to believe the Broncos wouldnt offer it now if they thought he was the long-term solution.  It's still early, but if it doesnt happen by the draft.. look for us to take a qb."
DenverBroncos,30fgun,gsu95,2,Fri Mar 27 14:45:17 2015 UTC,"He has a year left on his rookie contract, why would they extend him now? Think about it, are they extending Von at this moment? No. He has another year and they will deal with that soon, and who do you think is the bigger name to get resigned?"

DenverBroncos,30fgun,gsu95,1 point,Sat Mar 28 01:10:04 2015 UTC,"I am thinking about it... We aren't offering cash to anybody right now, coincidence? You are assuming there have been no discussions, there's been no forward thinking by the front office, nothing. I'm pretty sure they have a plan in mind, it's a business, it has to be treated that way, so when you have a fire burning right beside you, you don't go looking for where one might start, you put the one out beside you first.  Besides I'm pretty sure we could throw the transition tag on him, if he isn't an exclusive rights free agent, which he might be because I think that goes by actual playing time but I'm not sure.  Cool the jets... There is 12 months before it actually even becomes a problem, and I'm pretty sure that they have a plan. I see no reason to jump to the conclusion we don't want him back just because we aren't offering him a contract right this minute, considering we haven't seen what he can do yet. Did you consider they might plan on starting him a couple games, or getting him in earlier in games to see what he has before they offer him a contract? Come on man, think about it."
DenverBroncos,30fgun,CO_Boiler,1 point,Sat Mar 28 03:16:47 2015 UTC,"If they wait for him to be a free agent they run the risk of having to overpay to keep him. By trying to extend him now before the market sets his value, they can get him for a year or two on the cheap. Some QB hungry team could end up paying him a bunch more than he deserves.  For Von, I wouldn't be surprised to see him extended before the season, and if he's not he'll get the franchise tag."
DenverBroncos,30fgun,aatencio91,1 point,Fri Mar 27 16:32:07 2015 UTC,"I'm saying they will get through this part of the off-season where there have infinitely tighter deadlines, and then before the season starts open discussions and work on it going into the season and probably end up like Harris.   Basically there is no need to draw drastic conclusions when there is 12 months before it should really even make it to the very front burner. There are a lot of steps that have to be made in order before you extend your backup QB. For all we know Elway might find ""the one"" this next college season even if he is planning on Oz being the man right now."

DenverBroncos,30epvs,DasRoach,4,Mon Mar 30 01:38:51 2015 UTC,Every pass play? He'll get one on every play period. He'll hit the QB so fast that he never gets to hand the ball off to the RB. Teams will sign FA quarterbacks just because they know the game is lost before it starts and they don't want their QBs to be beaten to a pulp.
DenverBroncos,30epvs,hde128,3,Fri Mar 27 02:07:44 2015 UTC,I think it's likely that opposing offenses will just drop linemen into their own backfield to prevent Von from scoring on all his sack/fumble recoveries.
DenverBroncos,30epvs,redditer1450,13,Fri Mar 27 02:36:41 2015 UTC,"I think he will help von quite a bit via the rest of the defense if that makes sense. Von rushed plenty last year, but I believe that almost hurt Von's potential. Every play, the offensive line knew he was coming and could account for him, and would often have a running back or tight end on his side to chip him. Under wade, the broncos will be blitzing more, so offenses cant afford risking someone running through unblocked because they doubled von, so he won't see as many doubles and chips. He also might be spending more time in coverage. If von is spending more time in coverage, the offense can't afford to pay him as much attention in the blocking scheme even more so. So, when he does rush, he will be more likely to have a 1v1 matchup against a tackle and will start getting more sacks.  Tl:dr- Wade's defense will be far less predictable, and will therefore help von be more successful  Ninja edit: redundancy and rewording"
DenverBroncos,30epvs,asdechl,15,Thu Mar 26 21:12:28 2015 UTC,Von-Tastic
DenverBroncos,30epvs,von_bot,8,Thu Mar 26 21:14:07 2015 UTC,To elaborate.  He will have a edge rusher in front of him so he will be able to pick which way he is going to go. The tackle isn't going to know if he has to get the edge guy or Von. Also sets up a lot more stunts where he goes up the middle or around the othet side.
DenverBroncos,30epvs,lsjunior,2,Thu Mar 26 23:20:44 2015 UTC,Excellent point. I have always thought that the 3-4 defense was more effective but I suppose it depends on your personnel. We are definitely a better fit for a 3-4 with Ware and Miller.

DenverBroncos,30epvs,asdechl,3,Fri Mar 27 02:43:29 2015 UTC,"I could see him making pass rush more instead of dropping back, but other than that not much. He was one of the few players that JDR utilized correctly."
DenverBroncos,30epvs,VonillaMilla,0,Thu Mar 26 19:46:15 2015 UTC,"Not really. Sure, he rushed a lot, but like asdechi pointed out, his rushing was wasted because he did it almost every play. Coupled with the lackluster blitz schemes we had, Von was not able to play to his potential."
DenverBroncos,30epvs,drax117,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:49:39 2015 UTC,Not much if I what I hear is correct. Von has been playing the role he will play in Phillips' defense for like 4 years. Of course he will definitely not hurt Von's play.
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,JamFlash,3,Thu Mar 26 18:51:08 2015 UTC,This thread attempts to look over a handful of draft prospects for the Broncos. Not all 1st rounders.
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,aatencio91,2,Thu Mar 26 19:31:31 2015 UTC,I think we'll probably draft a OL. Hopefully we can land a Zack Martin.  http://www.nfl.com/draft/2015/mock-drafts  TJ Clemmings is a popular pick in this mock.
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,VonillaMilla,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:05:43 2015 UTC,"in the first round for Denver I think the most likely pick would be a RT, edge rusher, or NT"
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,mr_potroast,2,Fri Mar 27 00:02:46 2015 UTC,Why would we need an edge rusher...
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,mr_potroast,0,Fri Mar 27 02:45:25 2015 UTC,1) BPA  2) Ware is 32  3) Shit ton of talented edge rushers this year  4) Most impactful position on defense
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,von_bot,1 point,Fri Mar 27 02:52:25 2015 UTC,"surely the holes in our O-line greatly outweigh the need for an edge rusher. Sure ware is 32 but he has a couple of good years left I'm sure (particularly since he won't be seeing so many double teams with Von out there). It's hard to argue that we won't have a top 5 edge rushing tandem for the next year or two. Meanwhile, if we want to win while we still have Peyton, the O-line needs to be fixed"
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,kackjelly,2,Fri Mar 27 03:08:01 2015 UTC,"Another Von, coming up"
DenverBroncos,30ehzy,aatencio91,1 point,Fri Mar 27 03:09:16 2015 UTC,"Again, BPA. If you got someone like Eli Harold, Bud Dupree, Owamagbe Odighizuwa, or even Randy Gregory there it wouldn't be bad to take them at all. Incase you haven't noticed, Elway is all about BPA. If a guy they got ranked highly on their board falls to them, they're gonna take them, even if it's not a huge position of need. Just look at last year.  They can find talent in the 2nd round at tackle, and even later than that for interior OL. And whether you agree or not it's evident they expect guys like Clark, Schofield, Paradis, and Garland to compete.   It's hard to argue that we won't have a top 5 edge rushing tandem for the next year or two.   Cool, you draft for the next 10 years, not the next one.   Meanwhile, if we want to win while we still have Peyton, the O-line needs to be fixed   Peyton got one year left. You ain't gonna fix and OL just by throwing some top picks at them. A rookie can't be relied on to fix an OL, first rounder or no. Good coaching and scheme fits will go much further to improving the OL."

DenverBroncos,30dxu1,anbujar,1 point,Fri Mar 27 17:48:31 2015 UTC,"This is inaccurate we signed Aaron Brewer for 4 mil on like 3-4 year contract, Tony carter was tendered. Julius Thomas was effective yet had no heart and has yet to complete a full nfl season. Yes we lost Moore but we arguably brought in a more talented DB to a very deep defensive backfield as a result I am sure someone can step up. Unrein played like 15 snaps. The most damaging loss was Orlando Franklin and as for Pot Roast I was sad to see him go but he is not favored in the type of defense that will be run next year.

DenverBroncos,30dxu1,bernie5690,1 point,Fri Mar 27 19:44:30 2015 UTC,I think our roster is still full of far better potential than him. But I suppose you're right. No use in looking when he's going to be around for pennies.

DenverBroncos,30dxu1,vindawg08,1 point,Fri Mar 27 14:31:07 2015 UTC,"My best guess is that since he is technically a free agent, ESPN just listed him as a loss. I hope he gets signed, we need some depth back there"

DenverBroncos,30dxu1,ktsmyth,0,Sat Mar 28 00:32:42 2015 UTC,"How is Tony Carter a key subtraction? Didn't we tender him?   Anyways, the biggest loss is probably Rahim Moore. I am not a huge fan of him but he was pretty good at his job."
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 17:02:50 2015 UTC,I think the biggest loss was Franklin
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,JamFlash,4,Thu Mar 26 18:02:12 2015 UTC,We should have kept Beadles in hindsight. Franklin was good but he was so undisciplined.
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,ktsmyth,2,Thu Mar 26 18:03:38 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I mean look at what happened when we lost our Center. The rest of the line fell apart…  EDIT: Beadles is a guard, I'm an idiot."
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 18:45:48 2015 UTC,I don't know If I agree with that. Beadles got abused in the superbowl
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,ktsmyth,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:38:10 2015 UTC,Franklin was the one that was dominated by Avril.
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,VonillaMilla,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:42:41 2015 UTC,"Yeah at Tackle, but he looked great at guard last season"
DenverBroncos,30dxu1,ktsmyth,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:43:33 2015 UTC,"He still remains undisciplined with his penalties. I honestly thought Beadles was the biggest loss that offseason, not DRC, Decker, or Moreno. It was mostly because he had no replacement especially when we didn't even bother to get a RT and we had to force Chris Clark to do that when he has no business being there. Paul Cornick is god awful in pass-pro and then we had to force everyone else out of position (Vasquez)."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,DefenderCone97,21,Thu Mar 26 03:09:15 2015 UTC,Can we start a Cody Latimer hype club or something? I'm so fucking amped about him.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,ThreezusManning,11,Thu Mar 26 03:39:16 2015 UTC,"IU fan here, been amped about Latimer for years.  Guy has size and tools, I just hope he shows Peyton he's ready carry a bigger load next year."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,typs,5,Thu Mar 26 04:11:39 2015 UTC,The thing that surprised me the most is just how huge he is. I think he benched more reps at the combine than a few linemen. The only thing that I think could hold him back is route running but I have no idea how good of a route runner he was in college.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,ThreezusManning,3,Thu Mar 26 04:23:16 2015 UTC,"The thing that surprised me the most is just how huge he is   Can you imagine the blocking that our RBs are going to have with Virgil, Latimer, and DT? Christ, I'm just ready for the season to start already."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,baha24,11,Thu Mar 26 20:53:31 2015 UTC,"So did Rahim Moore, Orlando Franklin, and Terrance Knighton.  If Denver signs DT long term and Cody does blow it up I hate to say it but Sanders is probably gone unless he wants to take quite the discount."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,an_actual_potato,6,Thu Mar 26 03:12:03 2015 UTC,":(  I think your statement is valid but I think they'll fight harder for Sanders who is a proven star (top 10 in PFF WRs)than a Safety who was pretty average, a member of our O-Line which had a lot of trouble for a good chunk of the year and a DT who does not really fit in to the new system.  If Latimer does blow up (I don't think he will at least not be as strong as DT or ES.) then I think you would be correct."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 03:20:23 2015 UTC,I mean if the Packers can have Cobb and Nelson I don't see why we can't try to have DT and Sanders. Cody Latimer = Davante Adams.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,an_actual_potato,-6,Thu Mar 26 07:37:27 2015 UTC,"Except Latimer has a shot at beating out Sanders at the #2 spot, Adams has a very slim chance at beating out Cobb."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 13:12:21 2015 UTC,"Except Latimer has a shot at beating out Sanders at the #2 spot, Adams has a very slim chance at beating out Cobb.   How so? They're both 2nd rounders taken out of the same draft, and Adams went first. I love Latimer but at this point he has proven less to the league than Adams has. I just see it as unlikely either way. Sanders has shown himself to be something truly special this year. After all Sanders and DT were the only wide receiver duo other than Cobbs & Nelson to both finish top ten. The way Sanders creates separation along the outsides and gives himself up for the ball would be a bit wasted playing in the slot and a smaller guy like him could get real fucked on catches in traffic. Latimer is a better fit for the midfield plays, he's big, can take a hit better, and will block well if needed."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,an_actual_potato,-3,Thu Mar 26 18:16:56 2015 UTC,"Adams going first means he is better? So is Montee Ball better than Eddie Lacy since we picked him first? Adams was probably the most likely one to bust and not perform that well among the top WRs of the draft.   Yeah, Latimer has proven less because he didn't even play last season. Sanders would be a slot guy, just like Cobb was when James Jones was on the Packers 2 years ago."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 18:19:09 2015 UTC,"Adams going first means he is better?   Not necessarily, but it's certainly possible considering Latimer has barely played a snap. Adams has proven he can ball out and I'm not going to say Latimer is better just because he's ours. I think he might be and I hope we will be, but it cannot be said as of yet.  Again, I just doubt Sanders goes to the slot. His performance on the outsides is proven as excellent and his skill-set and build favor it. Kubiak values blocking, especially towards the inside, and Latimer will offer that better in the slot than Sanders can. Sanders' elite speed and route-running is simply better put to use on the outside. Better to use a big guy like Latimer as an easy target midfield and a blocker."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,an_actual_potato,-4,Thu Mar 26 18:24:02 2015 UTC,"Yeah Adams proved he could put up 400 yards in 16 games, that is really balling alright. /s   You can doubt all you want, but it is more than likely going to happen given that slot guys are suppose to be elusive, quick, and basically what Sanders is. You can play your little Madden games all you want, but it is likely he will be moved as a slot.   Latimer will take Sanders job as the outside WR. He has things that you can't teach like size, physicality, jump ball skills, etc. Latimer is also a ferocious blocker while Sanders is a vag in that regard.   But you can keep dreaming because your little man crush is going to lose his job and hopefully doesn't stay."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,4,Thu Mar 26 18:27:21 2015 UTC,"You know you don't need to be a dick, right? We're just talkin'.  Your analysis of Adams season is extremely shallow. His usage picked up as the season went along (particularly in the postseason) and he's in an already loaded passing attack. That's kind of like saying Wes Welker can't ball out because he had a quite year last year. Adams made big plays when he needed to and, had it not been for his contributions, the Packcers would have losses to show against both Miami and NE.  Moving on, to the rest of your post and your needless aggressiveness, I just think your making far too much of a basic read on the situation. Kubiak has certain things he wants and Latimer fits those better mid-field. A fast, short receiver who creates separation with speed is not unknown to playing on the outside in this league. By your logic Antonio Brown (5'10'') should be replaced by Martavis Bryant (6'5'') on the outside in PIT, as well. That won't be happening though as Browns, like Sanders, has proven how effective he is in his current role. This is not to say that Sanders and Brown are of the same talent level, they are not, but they do have the same skill-sets. It's not madden thinking, whatever that means, to recognize that  a WR doesn't have to be of one precise build to play one role or another. Coaches have flexibility and will 9/10 choose the guy who will give them the best performance in a spot over these body fundamentals you're caught up on. Sanders has shown himself to be a top 10 WR on the outside, objectively, it would take a hell of a showing from Latimer to remove him from that role. If he's able to show that he can provide better value on the outside, again Sanders was top ten last year both in production and by PFF's grading, then more power to him.  Edit: You really had to downvote me for disagreeing with you? Dick. I had not intention of doing so, but I've returned the favor."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,IMERMAIDMANonYT,-3,Thu Mar 26 18:39:31 2015 UTC,"So two games means he had a dominant season? What a joke. He really isn't that good. He is average, possibly above average player and no more.   Antonio Brown is an elite WR and he does play in the slot many times. Is he primarily a slot WR? No, he is a versatile WR that can play the X, H, or the Z which is valuable because Demaryius Thomas can't play the H. Best case scenario for your man crush is that he only occasionally plays in the slot instead of full-time.   Lol at Sanders being top 10. The guy was an average player at best in Pittsburgh. He never topped over 750 yards in a season and this is playing with Big Ben, a borderline elite/HOF QB and as a #2.   If you want to talk about Kubiak's system, he prefers WRs that can block as he has a ZBS. Latimer is better than Sanders at it as Latimer was known to be physical and a great blocker.   I view Latimer nearly the same as Decker, even better actually. I think Latimer will be Decker without his stupid flaws like turf monster, being a diva, etc. If Decker and Sanders and DT were all on the same team, Decker would start on the outside, not Sanders."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Dukuz,3,Thu Mar 26 18:50:30 2015 UTC,"One thing to remember is that Sanders was one of like 4 players that actually wanted to be in the divisional game, a lot of the players we lost didn't have that attitude and they're gone."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,baha24,3,Thu Mar 26 16:57:12 2015 UTC,I hope not... Sanders has surprisingly been one of my favorite FA acquisitions. I thought we might be getting somewhat good WR2 but dammit if he isn't 1b.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Greeney494,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:16:33 2015 UTC,"TBH, if Latimer blows up, I could see us letting DT chase big bucks somewhere else after this year. I know it's hard to even imagine that at this point, but if we have a DT 2.0 who is cheaper to keep around, I could see us drafting a WR in 2016 and letting DT walk to give paydays to Von, CJ, Trevathan and Marshall next year. And believe me, I love DT as much as the next fan.  It could also signal the end of one offensive era to the next if Manning retires (losing Manning, Moreno, Julius, DT, and Welker, but gaining Anderson, Sanders, Latimer, Green, and Brock).  Obviously,though, this is all just speculation. The off-season is killing me."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,TheLegendtaker,10,Thu Mar 26 20:57:35 2015 UTC,"To be fair, it's not like he's going to tell a fan he doesn't want to end his career here.  ""Nah I'd much rather finish my career in Miami!"" Not good PR."

DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,-23,Fri Mar 27 18:23:42 2015 UTC,Emmanuel Sanders is even more of a product of Peyton than Julius Thomas is.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,12,Thu Mar 26 03:25:35 2015 UTC,We should just start calling DT a product too considering Sanders outplayed him most of the year and was a lot more consistent
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Sienna_Crush,-9,Thu Mar 26 04:19:28 2015 UTC,DT played better with Tebow/Orton than Sanders did with Ben. The difference was DT was injured a lot prior to Peyton.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 04:26:46 2015 UTC,"DT had one good month and a play off game with Tebow. I'd hardly call that ""proven"", injury or no."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Sienna_Crush,-7,Thu Mar 26 11:31:55 2015 UTC,"Yet if you look at the numbers, they were literally the same as Sanders best numbers in Pittsburgh. Not bad given that Demaryius only played 11 games and had Tebow/Orton as QB and not playing behind a borderline HOF/elite QB in Big Ben."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,4,Thu Mar 26 13:10:49 2015 UTC,"Hardly, receivers that can create space and catch every ball thrown their way are the opposite of a system product. Sanders does both extremely well. Every receiver playing for an elite QB owes a lot of their success to the QB."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Dirtymikeandtheboyz1,-11,Thu Mar 26 03:57:39 2015 UTC,"I'm not necessarily saying he is a product, but Julius got this label and I think Sanders is even worse at it.   Sanders didn't really do much playing with Big Ben, a borderline elite, top 5-7 QB in the league. He never racked up over 750 yards playing under him and also as a #2 option behind Antonio Brown.   In some ways, Sanders is more proven to be a product than Julius has. We will see if Julius can still be productive under Bortles. I think he can."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,6,Thu Mar 26 03:59:42 2015 UTC,"Part of it probably has to do with Pittsburgh's offense being much more run oriented and Sanders learning to be effect at the professional level. I'm if the opinion that Sanders would have broken 1000 yards this year even with Big Ben, which isn't much of a stretch given his improvement every year. Even by ES's own mouth though it is a lot better catching balls from Peyton."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Dukuz,-7,Thu Mar 26 04:27:49 2015 UTC,"Except that it isn't.  We ran the ball 443 times in 2014, Steelers ran the ball 394 times which also includes Big Ben's scrambles/rushes. Peyton threw only 13 more times than Ben did too.   You can make all the excuses you want but Antonio Brown had 1500 yards in 2013. Martavis Bryant only played 10 games last season and basically put up the best numbers that Sanders ever had with the Steelers."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 04:31:12 2015 UTC,"Have to disrespectfully disagree, watch sanders lay out for an insane catch while getting pumped by a safety and just getting back up to do it again. You can't teach that in a system, that's not a ""product"" he's a god damn talent."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Dukuz,-4,Thu Mar 26 13:47:30 2015 UTC,Yet he couldn't do the same thing in Pittsburgh? I'm just laying out facts. Sanders was no more than an average WR with Pittsburgh and the numbers back it up.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,2,Thu Mar 26 13:49:43 2015 UTC,May be that he just didn't have the right QB.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Dukuz,1 point,Thu Mar 26 17:03:51 2015 UTC,"Yeah, it's peyton giving him the speed to be corners deep routinely and hands like glue."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,-3,Thu Mar 26 19:17:42 2015 UTC,"So why couldn't he do that when he was in Pittsburgh? I like nobody ever answers this question at least honestly and just sticks to downvotes.   First excuse is, Steelers don't pass as much and run more - Myth Debunked, Broncos in 2014 ran more than the Steelers did in 2013 and threw like only 10 times more.   Second was, Steelers under-utilized him - Myth debunked as he got 113 targets in 2013.   What is the next one?"
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,Sienna_Crush,1 point,Thu Mar 26 19:21:57 2015 UTC,"Peyton demands perfection out of his WRs. Obviously having a legend at QB will up performance, but he also elevates their play through knowledge too. Kind of circlejerky but it's true.   There has been loads of times where sanders goes deep and makes a leaping catch because the ball was over thrown."
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,VonillaMilla,-2,Thu Mar 26 20:36:38 2015 UTC,So you would agree that he is a product of Peyton in that case.
DenverBroncos,30bzvy,CO_Boiler,1 point,Thu Mar 26 20:37:16 2015 UTC,That was a fast reply lol. Check the edit. But yes I do agree having Manning at QB will help his stats but it's going too far just to call him a product of manning. Not fair to sanders.

And no Von would make it a lot harder to pressure quarterbacks, especially without blitzing."
DenverBroncos,30dai7,8manjones,2,Thu Mar 26 13:47:26 2015 UTC,"Von is the man, no doubt. PFM's leadership tips my wildly subjective ranking in his favor, he's basically the OC"
DenverBroncos,30dai7,kunt_kicker,0,Thu Mar 26 15:12:54 2015 UTC,"I thought of putting Von at #2 for me, but I went with #3 because he disappeared at the end of the season. It is not like he was getting chipped, double teamed, or pressure but not sacks. He couldn't even get pressure on Luck in that playoff game.  Chris Harris was more consistent at his position than Von was."
DenverBroncos,30dai7,not_horatiocaine,4,Thu Mar 26 13:51:59 2015 UTC,"You mean was not? He was getting chipped constantly and was getting hurries and hits. When Ware slowed down they didn't have to worry about him and could just focus their protection on Von. And for whatever reason they continued to use Jackson on about half the snaps when he's the 2nd best pass rusher on the team. I don't value sacks too much more than hits/hurries, either.  And I don't let one game change my list. Even if they are play off games. IIRC Von spent like 14 snaps in coverage that game and never had much of a chance to settle and just rush."
DenverBroncos,30dai7,OpabiniaGlasses,1 point,Thu Mar 26 14:02:38 2015 UTC,"You must have watched a different playoff game cause Luck had a lot of time in that game. Von didn't show up too much more than Ware did.  In all honesty, I am worried about Von's conditioning. He usually dominates in mid-season, but wears off towards the end. It happened in 2012 too.   I agree about hurries and sacks being worth nearly equal which is why Jackson is #5 to me."
DenverBroncos,30dai7,mexpaintball,4,Thu Mar 26 14:04:59 2015 UTC,"Never said Luck didn't have time, I said I'm not gonna let one game change my list, especially when most of the team played bad. Doesn't help when you spend a third of your snaps against the pass in coverage.  I don't think in 2012 really slowed down, for the last stretch of 2012 Denver spent half the game in garbage time, and he had atleast one sack in 5 of the last 6 games."

DenverBroncos,30c4jz,89raikessj,3,Thu Mar 26 03:53:55 2015 UTC,"I can't really see from this distance, but I'd hazard a guess that it's because the NFL is outlining the sideline merch logos in gold as a ""Superbowl 50"" celebration (see the Patriots cap in the link below).  http://nesn.com/2015/03/nfl-unveils-gold-pro-bowl-uniforms-logos-and-more-for-super-bowl-50-photos/  Orange would clash with gold and perhaps take away from the effect and/or look bad. The Bengals hat being black is because of the same problem perhaps? (or is their merch normally black anyway?) I could, of course, be completely wrong and they've just decided to use blue. In which case, BOO.   Edit: I've just seen another thread that discusses this issue (http://www.reddit.com/r/DenverBroncos/comments/30b37y/as_part_of_the_league_wide_celebration_of_the/) and which uses the orange.

DenverBroncos,30a0kg,SuburbanHell,2,Wed Mar 25 22:35:35 2015 UTC,It actually might not be that bad. There are plenty of udfa's that are good enough to make a roster and Elway has been pretty good at finding talent there. Since everyone else has already picked we are essentially getting the first three guys from that entire pool.

He could totally dominate and become the starter, hype everyone up and then just flop as the full time starter, or vice versa.  However it's better than nothing, I'm a huge Brock supporter."
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,2,Wed Mar 25 16:23:50 2015 UTC,"I agree with the premise of the article- Peyton needs to settle down with this ""reps"" thing and concede some to Brock, both in practice and games. It's a win-win, but Peyton might not set as many records as a result. I believe that Brock should START every non-division road game except for the game in Indianapolis. That means Brock would start at Chicago, at Detroit, at Pittsburgh, and at Cleveland. Unless he's completely terrible what do we have to lose? a 1st round bye is not nearly enough incentive to wear Peyton down and expose him to hits an extra 200 times.   Let's be honest, the Colts are going to win 13 games because once again, they have an extremely soft schedule. the patsies are guaranteed 12 wins because of their shitty division (improving, yes. but the QB play alone makes it not competitive) too. So let's face facts and use them to our advantage. If we can't go on the road and win 1 playoff game, we don't deserve the SB in the first place."
DenverBroncos,30979x,drax117,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:28:45 2015 UTC,Getting a first round bye is huge.  I don't think Brock should start unless we have that guaranteed.  I'd like to see him go in anytime it's a blowout though.
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,3,Thu Mar 26 03:14:10 2015 UTC,"As a fan and season ticket holder, I would be nuclear pissed if we shelled out $15 million this year to put the guy on the bench for a non-injury reason.  We could have given Brock the reigns if that was the plan, and be financially better off for it.  I want PFM here, don't get me wrong...but if he is benched this season, my God.  And no, I don't accept ""but he is playing like shit!"" as a reason...if that happens we are mailing it in for the season unless Brosweiler tears shit up.  We could have done that and saved some coin.  Oh, and the Denver Post is awful. #rockymountainnews4lyfe"
DenverBroncos,30979x,drax117,2,Wed Mar 25 15:28:33 2015 UTC,"Youre not thinking long term, at all. After this season, Brocks contract is up. And Peyton is gone.   We ABSOLUTELY HAVE to see what we have in Brock, in a real game situation. I dont give a fuck what season ticket holders feel, this is the future of the franchise we are talking about here."
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,0,Wed Mar 25 21:13:27 2015 UTC,"I don't disagree with you here.  Again, my point is...spending that kind of money on a QB to sit him down will be ridiculous if we end up anywhere but the Super Bowl again.  My entire post IS about the future of the franchise."
DenverBroncos,30979x,MTLBroncos,2,Wed Mar 25 21:31:07 2015 UTC,"Well I do agree that the only way we should SIT Peyton, is if A: He's injured or B: Blow out and playoffs secured.   I fully agree that we should be going 150% for the SB again, but we do also have to balance in long term as well."
DenverBroncos,30979x,herbivore83,1 point,Wed Mar 25 22:01:22 2015 UTC,"Agreed, on all points."
DenverBroncos,30979x,Unrelated_Incident,-5,Wed Mar 25 23:48:48 2015 UTC,If Manning plays like shit he absolutely should be on the bench. I wish we cut him honestly
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,4,Wed Mar 25 15:53:19 2015 UTC,Man I hate to see someone's opinion downvoted. This sub is better than that.
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,1 point,Wed Mar 25 17:18:08 2015 UTC,But he said something that I disagree with!
DenverBroncos,30979x,herbivore83,1 point,Thu Mar 26 03:11:53 2015 UTC,"My point really is, if it comes to that I will be pissed because we kept him.  It is totally a hindsight situation I will admit, but it would have been a massive waste of money this season and time that could have been spent developing another QB."
DenverBroncos,30979x,herbivore83,-6,Wed Mar 25 16:15:45 2015 UTC,you guys are fucking morons
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,5,Wed Mar 25 16:21:43 2015 UTC,"Strong take, you're a real joy to have in this sub."
DenverBroncos,30979x,fearboner,3,Wed Mar 25 17:32:57 2015 UTC,"Yeah, how dare they have opinions different from yours!"
DenverBroncos,30979x,AdmiralAllahuAckbar,2,Wed Mar 25 17:17:43 2015 UTC,having the opinion this team has a better chance at winning the SB without Manning is moronic.
DenverBroncos,30979x,CO_Boiler,2,Wed Mar 25 17:43:38 2015 UTC,"That's just like, your opinion, man. So you're going to try to eliminate him from the discussion because of his opinion. And call him a moron. Very pleasant."
DenverBroncos,30979x,Greeney494,2,Wed Mar 25 17:49:50 2015 UTC,Reading is fundamental.
DenverBroncos,30979x,aatencio91,-1,Wed Mar 25 17:58:05 2015 UTC,I wish we cut him honestly
DenverBroncos,30akh6,Stanzilla28,2,Wed Mar 25 20:33:46 2015 UTC,"Navy Adm. James A.

Manning received the award for his support of the military through USO tours and visits with wounded, ill and injured service members."

DenverBroncos,30av4t,dlevine09,1 point,Wed Mar 25 21:49:53 2015 UTC,Kind of cool to see the transformation and how much work goes into actually having a pristine field! I dig that they're going back to 100% grass.
DenverBroncos,30av4t,PacSmalls,0,Thu Mar 26 00:11:27 2015 UTC,"Bold step, converting to a dirt field. Let's see if it pays off come winter though. Could have a lot of mud to deal with. This would be better suited for Miami or San Diego."
DenverBroncos,306aea,ziglotus7772,33,Tue Mar 24 20:47:17 2015 UTC,How is this news? Dude single handedly saved their season.
DenverBroncos,306aea,HappyGilOHMYGOD,1 point,Tue Mar 24 20:48:49 2015 UTC,"I can agree and I really like CJ. However...  I'm not the most knowledgeable with how everything works in football, but if I can recall correctly, we were using 6 linemen towards the end of the season, could that have inflated his stats?"
DenverBroncos,306aea,Royusmaximus,13,Wed Mar 25 00:29:43 2015 UTC,"We used 6 lineman a lot when Virgil was hurt to kind of fill his role. When he came back we started using a 6th a lot less. One thing to remember about Ball vs. CJ is that Ball took all his reps when Peyton was healthy, so the defense had to respect the pass a lot more than when CJ was in. Ball also took all his reps when the line was playing like absolute shit so its hard to really compare the two. I think Ball will really step it up this year in the Zone Blocking System though and be a great #2 back."
DenverBroncos,306aea,ThreezusManning,3,Wed Mar 25 00:41:13 2015 UTC,I hope so. I have high expectations for our running game this year :)  Thanks for filling me in on all that.
DenverBroncos,306aea,Royusmaximus,21,Wed Mar 25 00:59:52 2015 UTC,"""In other news, Kubiak hinted that QB Peyton Manning has a slight lead over Brock Osweiler for the starting role, and WR Demaryius Thomas likely to start rather than members of the practice team."""
DenverBroncos,306aea,AFKennedy,11,Wed Mar 25 03:30:44 2015 UTC,Obviously...
DenverBroncos,306aea,Danieltmv,6,Tue Mar 24 20:56:47 2015 UTC,"I'm really eager to see who the #2 back is. If a guy like Montee or Hillman has a good showing as the 2nd back, maybe we could get a bit of trade value for one of them."
DenverBroncos,306aea,crueg,10,Tue Mar 24 21:09:18 2015 UTC,"What would be the point of trading one? Aside from the fact they're both cheap, why would you want to thin the backfield? Denver had a deep backfield last year and for a long stretch still only had one healthy back."
DenverBroncos,306aea,mysterious_pube,4,Tue Mar 24 21:57:41 2015 UTC,"Especially because those guys would be worth peanuts in the trade market. All 3 backs can still have a role, and they're all on rookie deals."
DenverBroncos,306aea,peaceblaster68,4,Wed Mar 25 05:35:56 2015 UTC,Meanwhile Juwan has better potential than either of them.  Choo Choo!
DenverBroncos,306aea,United_In_Orange,2,Wed Mar 25 03:35:12 2015 UTC,"Do you think Bibbs could make improvement? He was great at CSU, although he ran behind a great line and is still immature (experience wise).   I really want him to do well."
DenverBroncos,306aea,depressedcarguy,1 point,Tue Mar 24 21:22:16 2015 UTC,"It is certainly Ball, no?"
DenverBroncos,306aea,pham_nuwen_,2,Tue Mar 24 21:47:00 2015 UTC,"No. Ball lost a lot of ground last year so there's nothing certain about him. I wouldn't be surprised if Montee ended up 3rd or 4th behind Juwan and or Ronnie. Not that I think Hillman is a better back, but he could see more action as a change of pace guy than Ball may as a backup."

DenverBroncos,306aea,typical_thatguy,5,Wed Mar 25 02:22:24 2015 UTC,He's gonna be amazing in this system.  What former Bronco back is he most similar to?
DenverBroncos,306aea,phatlever,14,Tue Mar 24 23:31:54 2015 UTC,"None, he's his own style and type of RB compared to anything we've had. But he's going to be a BEAST!"
DenverBroncos,306aea,PMeist,8,Tue Mar 24 23:57:22 2015 UTC,"Reminds me of MJD a little, bowling ball hard to take down type style."
DenverBroncos,306aea,Candyman4x,1 point,Wed Mar 25 02:44:18 2015 UTC,"I like that.  CJ's vision is so good too, he's gonna have lanes all over the place."
DenverBroncos,306aea,phatlever,2,Wed Mar 25 16:03:38 2015 UTC,"Is Olandis Gary the smallest back we had from the glory days?  No, wasn't there a little guy we had that came in and put up decent production?"
DenverBroncos,306aea,phatlever,2,Wed Mar 25 16:38:17 2015 UTC,Uh DURR!!  How the fuck is that newsworthy?
