Moustache,3dqvnz,bbbobbbieo,10,Sat Jul 18 16:10:39 2015 UTC,Say get rid of the chin and direct all attention to that moustache.
Moustache,3dqvnz,Muchachi,5,Sun Jul 19 00:30:07 2015 UTC,That is because you are handsome. I do agree though with getting rid of the chin.
Moustache,3dqvnz,JavAA,2,Sun Jul 19 02:35:10 2015 UTC,How could they not?
Moustache,3dqvnz,birdguy,2,Sat Jul 18 18:53:51 2015 UTC,I could see soul patch plus the stache.   But the wildness of the chin is currently distracting from the awesome of the stache. Less is more.
Moustache,3dkpfc,Eikbyrnir,2,Fri Jul 17 01:30:04 2015 UTC,Going almost two months.  First time I've ever tried growing one. Always wished a could grow a beard but can't due to work.  How's it looking?

Moustache,3dfseu,AlphaJustus,3,Wed Jul 15 22:47:26 2015 UTC,"2 weeks just looks like you've been too lazy to shave. Nothing personal, but that question seems to pop up all the time. Looks like you've got a good base, let it go for 2 months then check back.  BTW, I do handlebars but I doubt I'd get a respirator to seal around them if I had to..."
Moustache,3dfseu,rabblerouzr,1 point,Thu Jul 16 20:14:21 2015 UTC,Thanks friend. Just wanted to get an informed opinion on whether I had the good base. I've committed to at least 3 months. If I can get the handlebars going there's still some standards I need to stick to for work but a few gents have it in the department. It won't be anything too large but I've seen a few pics of some beautiful moustaches that would work here on this sub

Moustache,3daxo0,RobVegan,1 point,Tue Jul 14 21:27:04 2015 UTC,Not sure where the text went. I'm concerned about the center. It's too short to join up with the ends and too long to eat comfortably. It's been growing about 9 months and seems to have stayed at this length.

Moustache,3crpp1,joshthewaster,1 point,Fri Jul 10 06:53:38 2015 UTC,"Get some wax.   But seriously that's all there is to it. I use some Amish brand I got on amazon and like it well enough. Many people here seem to prefer a stronger hold and use ""got to be glued"" but I've never used that myself. Anyway just buy a tin of something and if you don't like it you are only out 5-15 bucks.   Edit: One more thing, probably avoid the cheap stuff in a tube. Generally haven't heard good things about that kind."

Moustache,3cc42d,strangelycutlemon,4,Mon Jul 6 19:27:19 2015 UTC,"Seeing a lot of responses, but some really strange advice...  The short answer is to stop twisting it.  It was second nature for me to twist it while shaping.  Now I just pinch and pull.  No more falling forward.  Couple things to keep in mind:   1) Heat causes damage.  It will likely look great for a while, but eventually it'll catch up to you.  It can cause breakage, split ends, and for the hair to grow back in poorly.  2) Trimming the middle is fine as long as you don't go crazy.  Mine is kept short because it's unmanageable. It also grows in VERY thick, so you can't tell it isn't the same length. Your mileage may vary.   3) Heavier products will drop your curls.  That one's just basic gravity.  Products made for your scalp won't always work on your stache.  If you aren't using wax, make sure the hair is dry and that your product is damn near dry before even putting it in. If it's wet, it'll fall."
Moustache,3cc42d,at_JR00K,5,Mon Jul 6 22:22:57 2015 UTC,"I've had this problem a few times. First handlebar I grew got shaved off because I was sick of that same problem. The one I have now is more manageable though. Don't trim it.... Ever. Comb it after the shower to get it moving in the right direction while it's wet. Work lots of wax into it. Don't twist it much, user the wax to curl it up with out twisting it if you can. Leave it set so the wax hardens a bit, then you can twist it a bit, but I find if I twist it I have to reverse the twist more often then not to keep it from falling over.  The thing that took me a few months to understand was that twisting wasn't what I was going for. You see people iconically twisting handlebars in movies etc... But the best way to curl it is to really work the wax into it then curl it up without twisting. I think the twist it's to work more was in and keep hairs from wandering, don't pinch hard when you work more wax in through the day. If you do twist it just gradually run the twist backwards while curling it the way you want it. It it's just not working, wash it out, re comb and try again. I might have to make a YouTube video showing what I'm talking about if it's tough to understand."
Moustache,3cc42d,AdverseTFV,1 point,Mon Jul 6 21:11:11 2015 UTC,"That actually makes sense, thanks."
Moustache,3cc42d,rabblerouzr,3,Mon Jul 6 21:18:13 2015 UTC,"I get precise styling with the help of heat. I've been using a small ~1/2"" wide flat iron to curl and control my loops. I apply warm wax, pull the sides out straight, then use the flat iron more like a curling iron to roll them up. If you try this, keep the iron from getting too hot. Only takes about 15 seconds of being turned on to get warm enough to melt the wax and curl the whiskers.  This is what it looks like today, after plenty of abuse by beard nets: http://i.imgur.com/mEt4h9P.jpg"

Moustache,3cc42d,Quincentopolis,3,Tue Jul 7 00:08:02 2015 UTC,"a)  Moustaches have a mind of their own.  w/o products and diligence in the crafting they'll do their own thing.  b)  If I'm doing a ""for show"" moustache, I will take upwards of 20 minutes in the bathroom, depending on my luck that night.  Sometimes the wax will hold just right.  other times i give it one twist too much and it wants to veer off cattywampus to it's partner.  Depending on the consistency of that particular batch of wax, I might ""set the hold"" for 3-5 minutes or maybe just 20 seconds.    The general rule here is that if you're going w/o product - you're at The Mercy of the Moustache.  If it's going to have wax/product - take your time and experiment, which is what you're about to get into."
Moustache,3cc42d,birdguy,2,Mon Jul 6 22:50:40 2015 UTC,"I feel like we might be in the same boat, I'm transitioning from twisting endlessly in one direction to twisting back and forth.  Really not creating a spiral with the wings just making all the hairs hang out with eachother, then I use my thumb to kind of wrap it around to get the handlebar swirl.  Feel like you might be just training it to become a spring and coil outward.  GL with the Stache!"
Moustache,3cc42d,TwiztedZero,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:27:28 2015 UTC,Good point; I hadn't thought of it that way.
Moustache,3cc42d,KazanTheMan,2,Mon Jul 6 20:44:52 2015 UTC,I like really symmetric and stiff curls on my handlebar. My regime involves an initial application of soft wax (Clubman's) or more recently glue stick. They I usually apply either gel (Got2Be extra spokes works okay) or extra hold hair spray. If I'm in a hurry I will dry it with a hair dryer. The hold lasts all day even in the most humid weather (I was in the rain forest last year). Sometimes it can even last multiple days.
Moustache,3cc42d,SharkBull,1 point,Tue Jul 7 07:27:10 2015 UTC,"Hah! I have the same problem, but I'm hoping it'll grow out of that stage later on too."
Moustache,3cc42d,SharkBull,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:37:42 2015 UTC,"The only way I've found to combat that forward bend is heat. Hot water, pat dry, and hit with a blow dryer on medium heat or higher while you shape it and add wax. Wait for the moisture to mostly evaporate before adding the wax, obviously."
Moustache,3cc42d,SNOne,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:12:02 2015 UTC,Thanks. I'll try that.
Moustache,3cc42d,5hawnking5,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:13:08 2015 UTC,"I get the same problem, worse when I use a gel than with a wax. I've assumed it's because shorter hairs from the middle of the stache are pulling forward the longer hairs from the ends. I haven't found a good way to combat this other than keeping it trimmed so that the edges dont overtake the middle hairs too much (and not using gels)"
Moustache,3cc42d,harrydog17093,1 point,Mon Jul 6 20:17:07 2015 UTC,Trying to refrain from trimming. I hear it's bad form. Although I probably couldn't look at someone and tell the difference!
