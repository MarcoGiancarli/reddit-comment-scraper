However, cameras in public areas is not an issue to me at all. First - it doesn't infringe on any constitutionally protected rights. We do not have any reasonable expectation to privacy in a public area. Second - it serves as a deterrent to crime. Criminals see a camera and think twice because they don't want to be caught. Third - if they do commit the crime we potentially have evidence than can help find the person.   I know people worry about a big brother society and I can respect that. Cameras in public don't intrude on your privacy though and the potential benefits in my opinion outweigh any harm."

There are some place/road names and terms that only appear in official documents, maps, and/or traffic reports, but are almost never heard in casual conversation. Case in point: State Route, and ""Tybouts Corner"". I've never heard ANYONE say the latter of these out loud, except in the morning traffic report. Almost every morning, as I drive to work, and I'm stuck in traffic, I hear ""Tybouts Corner"" mentioned in the list of places that are experiencing congestion. It took me a month of this to piece together that that was the jam I was sitting in! Why? Because no-one calls it that! Just like ""Talleyville"", or ""Holly Oak"", or ""The Blue Route."" I've lived here for 30 years, and I just today found out that ""the blue route"" is I-476. I learned years ago that the nickname came from how it was shown on print maps during it's very long period of construction (I overheard this in someone else's conversation), but I'd never heard the nickname (which I hear on every regional traffic report every day), and the official name (which happens to be what people I know actually call it) in the same statement til today.  Buuuut anywaaay, I've gotten off track.  Do you have to choose between those exact, whole phrases? They can't be mixed-and-matched?

""construction of the Mid-County Expressway through did not begin until 1967 and was not completed until 1991..."" ""...received its ""Blue Route"" nickname from the chosen route through Delaware County on planning maps on which it was differentiated from the other proposed routes by its color.""

Apparently you can also call part of it west of 13 Frenchtown Road West as well.  And part up by 95 is called the Christiana Bypass?  Who knew.  896 is New London Road north of Newark. And I believe it is South College Ave all the way down to 40. Business 896 is Glasgow Ave. At some point 896 (also numbered 301 at the north end starting at 40) becomes Summit Bridge Road.

Their descriptions about the dog and its behavior are really helpful.  They are evaluated by in-home foster volunteers.  You also need to pass a background check before adoption. They'll want references and to visible inspect your home for suitability.   But don't get me started on Pit Bulls.  I've volunteered at a shelter before and I know there are some nice Pit Bulls, but overall those things are bred to be mean.   And wonderfully beautiful and gentle dogs like the one I got are neutered before adoption.  Basically the only dogs being bred anymore are pit bulls and they fill the shelters. In fact the dog I got from Tree Top was imported from a shelter in South Carolina because there simply are just basically pit bulls or mixes around here :("

I've never tried listening to XPN, though they have presented some of the shows I've went to in Phily.  A relative who lives up there listens to them and likes them, though.  I mainly listen to my ipod, though I have recently started listening to Pandora because my new car's radio has it built in (though you need a cell phone that can stream it to the radio).

Get 3 waivers either on 3 different days or 3 different sets (For the record, I got 4 MONTHS of waivers for Airbender because of how long that shoot was) and you can get into SAG.  Or, if they like your face enough and need someone to go ""OH NO"" or otherwise say something, ANYTHING, you get bumped up to full Waiver and SAG eligible.  Also, folks in the Theatrical Union can go SAG if they have been in for at least a year and vice-versa.  Being Delaware as we are right now though,  Philadelphia was my big ""background area"" so hopefully if we can start getting some stuff rolling here, I can have some fun being in the background again.  Also I was in How Do You Know Watch background bright yellow shirt that is me walking by YAY!"

For online resources I always liked to use www.castingnetwork.com  I think it cost something like 25 bucks a year for the profile and such and has a pretty awesome wide range up and down East Coast for opportunities.  If you wanna stay local look up Heery Casting, they pretty much do anything and everything in PA and Diane, the lady who runs it, is amazing.  If you prove that you are competent and willing to show up they will remember you even for stuff you don't put in for.  I had pretty much 95% of the work  through them.  For print resources look for ""The Backstage Pass"" cool little quarterly book has pretty much every casting office in the U.S, talks about upcoming casting calls, and gives awesome breakdowns of most of the stuff happening in the U.S."

But for the most part it doesn't actually feel dangerous, i have walked though many parts of the city alone and at night, with zero problems. Basically the ghetto areas are mostly where people are killing each other, and those areas are fairly isolated.  There are very nice parts of the city that are really safe, Trolly Square in particular. But also a lot of union street is also totally safe.   What are you looking for in an area? Do you want to live in the city? Or do you want to live on the outskirts. Because its only in the city that the crime rate is so high. As another commenter noted, the actual area that is called Wilmington is very large, and you can easily live in quite suburbs on the outskirts of the city.

Delaware,3cxnh2,meditate42,3,Mon Jul 13 03:33:55 2015 UTC,"Well i'm not an expert on the issue, but my understanding is that it is mostly drugs causing the crime. We are in-between a lot of major cities, DC, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and a lot of drugs are trafficked through Wilmington.  But the other side of it is that the lists we make are usually based of percentages. Wilmington only has about 75,000 people technically living in the city, and like 1,000-2,000 of those people are apparently killing each other a lot. Which is fucking nuts statistically. More that 1 in 100 people in Wilmington are involved in violent crimes annually. Most parts of the city don't see shootings through. I will admit i have heard a gun fight once in my nice area, it was in the distance though, which can mean a lot in such a small city.  So its a weird thing, Wilmington feels meek and safe to a lot of us(my friend calls it ""the city that sleeps""), but at the same time we know murders are happening, and we knows its not ideal to go to certain areas late at night. But usually, it seems to be people involved in drug dealing or gangs killing each other. People do get robbed, but no one is running around pointlessly shooting people to take their wallet."

Naamans road near 95 can be a junkier area. if your job is in city limits, you should consider living in the actual city. if you like the experience of living in a rural area, I'm afraid there's not really a good place you can go without having a long commute"

Delaware,3ctkqo,TerraTF,6,Fri Jul 10 19:27:46 2015 UTC,"There isn't really a good ELI5 way to explain this case as it is really complicated by this is the best I could come up with:  Husband and Wife are married and have three daughters. Husband's mother and father move in with the family and things seem to be getting worse and eventually the couple get divorced, Husband's family blame the Wife for the marriage falling apart, she admitted to having postpartum depression after the birth of their third child.    Divorce is messy, but Wife consistently tried to do what was in the best interest of her children(she temporarily gave up custody to her husband while she was living with her maternal grandmother and her mother - an alcoholic.)    After Husband and Wife get joint custody of the children, the Husband's mother begins to make claims that the Wife has been sexually, physically and emotionally abusing her children, even going on the record and telling anyone that would listen that her granddaughters were being molested by her ex-daughter in law.  Husband and his mother kidnap the three girls by telling the Wife that they were going to go to Walt Disney World for two weeks and instead run away to Guatemala for a year and a half.    Husband and Mother are charged with kidnapping.  Husband's sister and mother were cyberstalking and harassing the Wife to the point where she feared for her safety and the safety for her daughters. Later at the custody hearing after the Husband gets released from prison, the Husband's father kills the Wife and her friend who accompanied her to the court house."

Rehoboth is great for the boardwalk and shops, but we prefer to swim at Cape Henlopen State Park as there is a bathhouse with showers. We tend to swim and play at Cape Henlopen State Park($7/car to enter I think) then clean up and hit Rehoboth in the later afternoon and evening(Be sure to check out the Sunshine Octupus shop). In addition to the main beach, Cape has a fishing pier and, if you time it with the low tide, go to the ""bay side"" where you can walk out nearly a quarter mile on the sand bars where you can find all kinds of marine ecology. There are also old WW2 observation towers(anti-submarine), some that you can still climb, and the bathhouse actually  sits on the base of the old shore battery.

With 50+ years to invest the cash, along with his business and real estate holdings (500 acre Granogue estate in the heart of Greenville's chateau country), I can't imagine his net worth being less than a billion. I suppose at his age it's possible, however, that he has turned a lot of his holdings over to his children to keep down estate taxes upon his eventual death.

For one, the Stars & Bars spent about five years as a symbol of the Confederate States, and about 150 as a banner for the Ku Klux Klan. It's a heritage that's pretty well tainted, and there's no use pretending you don't know what that flag has stood for during that time. For some Americans, that flag was the last thing they saw before being murdered. It's a pretty shitty symbol of heritage by now.  Teach the past. Teach the hell out of the past. But teach it all. Teach kids about slavery, and secession, and treason, and murder, and riots, and hate, and then show them the Confederate flag once they know everything it's stood for over the years. Teach the past. Go ahead and teach it, I dare you.  And then find a symbol that actually represents your heritage, because if your heritage is halfway decent that ain't it."

It's people who are not native to the region; I don't know if it's due to a lack of respect for the environment, poor education, or just not giving a fuck about the future, but there needs to be more done to stop.

You could always leave it on and contact your cell carrier or view your calls via online account if you have access. At least you'd know what numbers they're dialing, an call those to see who called them perhaps. If they get nasty just politely say you just want it back an offer a reward.

He cares more about the government admitting that he is right about the allegations outlined, rather than receiving an actual heart felt apology. The guy sounded a little out there IMO.  How something that happened so long ago that no one alive today had anything to do with, should be forced to apologize is absolutely absurd and I'm surprised it's getting the the circulation it already has. I'll be damned if a man ever breaths this in my direction. My family fought for the damn union and their freedom.  This is only my opinion, but when is the Black Community going to end all the excuses and pointing the finger and move on and progress in society? I don't believe in 2015 they are given any less of opportunity or chance to succeed and break away from traditional upbringings than any other underprivileged background.

As someone who has lived their entire life in Delaware, half of it being in Sussex County, there are plenty of areas that can suit your needs.  I find the Lewes area to be an extremely attractive area to live in.  There are some parts of the Millsboro area that seem to be right up your alley as well.  There are multiple communities in that area that could definitely suit your needs (Independence by Schell Brothers, Stonewater Creek, Baywood, etc.) and it falls within a nice school district which I was in from 5th grade until the end of high school.  The schools prepared me well enough to go out of state for engineering and be up to par at a large state school.  Of course these are my two plugs as I am extremely familiar with the Lewes, Millsboro and Rehoboth areas.  I really prefer these areas as they give you nice access to plenty of shopping, restaurants and the beaches as well of plenty of things to do with the kids. The Lewes and Rehoboth areas can be a little more pricey as they can often be places were people buy a seasonal/second home and are much closer to the beaches.  This being said, any area closer to the beaches tends to be a little nicer due to tourism but come summer, they will be impacted by heavy traffic from the many out of staters that visit.  If you have any other questions just ask!"
Delaware,3ci4j8,TheStork74,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:48:01 2015 UTC,"I agree with this approach.  I grew up up in Laurel and although I still like western Sussex, I would choose the Lewes area if I were you.

Delaware,3ci4j8,quantum_spintronic,2,Wed Jul 8 14:57:25 2015 UTC,"Also another vote for Lewes/Rehoboth. Lewes might be a little less crazy in the summer with traffic, but I live right in Rehoboth, and its not to bad to get around if you dont want to go far. Having lived in both Lewes and Rehoboth, I have to say I like living in Rehoboth better. They are close enough that it doesnt matter too much except the drive down RT. 1 in the summer. Rehoboth may be a bit more expensive, but you should easily be able to find something in your budget, especially since property tax here is almost non existent."
Delaware,3ci4j8,methodwriter85,1 point,Wed Jul 8 21:10:06 2015 UTC,I would say Middletown but I think it's a longer commute to Georgetown than 30 minutes.  I'm familiar with New Castle and Kent Co. but not too sure about Sussex.

Unfortunately im addicted to the ecig now. Im not positive its a better alternative yet as no real study has taken place by the fda to say either way whether or not its more or less harmful. But i do feel better, and i dont stink like smoke anymore. So for now, thats good enough for me.  But, i feel really annoyed when people start asking me about my vape. Like, hey man, whats that silly little thing youre sucking on there? How much does it cost? What type of flavors? Blah blah blah, to no end.....  So i tend to hide on my break in my car, or just generally leave it at home if im going out in public with my wife. I couldnt imagine using it anywhere i wasnt previously allowed to smoke. And even then when i smoked, i never really did it in front of public  entrance ways or anywhere it might offend someone.  I guess im just too considerate. I mean, for a law to have to be passed must mean that people were carelessly using vaporizers in places that it wasnt ok to smoke.   Why must people be assholes and ruin it for everyone?  Im glad to see that they at least are letting people still use them in the vape shops, considering a huge part of thier business lies on having customers try different flavors. This law couldve easily put the shops out of business if they didnt allow vaping indoors even there. I mean they dont allow smoking in  tobacco shops."
Delaware,3cf1wx,krauttastic,7,Tue Jul 7 13:42:15 2015 UTC,"I was the same way when I was a smoker, very considerate and aware of non-smokers. But I have seen people vaping in places that makes you wonder why they would think it's ok. Library, grocery store, retail clothing stores, Walmart, Target everywhere. I mean it's nowhere near as offensive as cigarette smoke, but still it does have an odor.It wasn't super common but I am glad they finally are making it officially banned so there is no question."

Have you ever been in a situation in a private property where someone was asked not to smoke and did not comply? I highly doubt it."
Delaware,3cf1wx,swefpelego,3,Tue Jul 7 21:12:39 2015 UTC,"Except these people who vape believe that since it's just water vapor that it's not harmful. So they put up even more of a stink about being asked not to do it.

Delaware,3cf1wx,katiecarbaholic,2,Wed Jul 8 01:09:06 2015 UTC,"Except that it's not just water vapor.  Even though the levels are much, much lower than a traditional cigarette, e-cigarettes do emit some toxins.  So there is at least some risk for health concerns.  But as the last round of articles talked about, it put restaurant owners/managers and others in a bad spot.  They could prohibit smoking, but couldn't do anything about e-cigs.  So this levels the playing field.  I think it is great that they put in the exemption for vape shops.  I personally wouldn't have a problem with allowing smoking in cigarette shops or cigar bars as long as they had the proper regulations in place - filtration systems and things like that.  Delaware has lead the way with their smoking bans, and our bars, restaurants, etc didn't all go out of business when the law went into effect.  If anything, it spurred the neighboring states to pass their own laws.  Until there is FDA regulation and more research done on vaping and e-cigs, I think there is nothing wrong with the state banning the use of them indoors.  I'd rather them err on the side of caution."

When I returned to school, I chose WilmU, and I'm glad I did.   I went for Education. It was a great experience because there were people of all ages in my classes. I also liked that you only went to class once a week, and most of the instructors did not take up the entire 4 hour block. The class sizes are also very small. The work load was not extreme, but that could just be because of my particular major.   If you are looking to go back for your Masters then you might not have to go to the main campus as often, which is a plus because of the ridiculous parking. That might be different now, but probably not. A lot of my coworkers have masters degrees from there, and they all enjoyed it."

Looking back, I wish I wasn't so stubborn to finish from there.  Thank you for your input. It sounds like you enjoyed it a lot more than UD, so I hope I share that experience. I'm going for a Masters in Management with a concentration in Health Care, and possibly the MBA program. Thank you for your response. Gave me some great insight."

(a) No rental agreement, unless in writing, shall be effective for a longer term than 1 year.  (b) Where no term is expressly provided, a rental agreement for premises shall be deemed and construed to be for a month-to-month term.  (c) The landlord may terminate any rental agreement, other than month-to-month agreements, by giving a minimum of 60 days' written notice to the tenant prior to the expiration of the term of the rental agreement. The notice shall indicate that the agreement shall terminate upon its expiration date. A tenant may terminate a rental agreement by giving a minimum of 60 days' written notice prior to the expiration of the term of the rental agreement that the agreement shall terminate upon its expiration date.  (d) Where the term of the rental agreement is month-to-month, the landlord or tenant may terminate the rental agreement by giving the other party a minimum of 60 days' written notice, which 60-day period shall begin on the first day of the month following the day of actual notice.  (e) With regard to a tenant occupying a federally-subsidized housing unit, in the event of any conflict between the terms of this Code and the terms of any federal law, regulations or guidelines, the terms of the federal law, regulations or guidelines shall control."

Delaware,3cfzz6,leprakhauns,2,Tue Jul 7 18:31:01 2015 UTC,"The contract should extend to the new owner until your lease ends, which for you would be the end of the month that the new owner takes effect. If the new owner wants you out they would need to give you at least 30 days notice I believe.  The current landlord cannot show the part of the house you are living in without your consent, just like he cannot enter your living quarters without your consent."
Delaware,3cfzz6,OhRealOriginal,2,Tue Jul 7 17:12:32 2015 UTC,As its a month to month I believe the landlord only has to give you 30 days or leave it up to the buyer if they want to keep renting the property to you.

Delaware,3cfzz6,ktdidit,2,Tue Jul 7 18:55:26 2015 UTC,It used to be 30 days years ago...now 60 days notice is required according to the Landlord-Tenant Code.
Delaware,3cfzz6,ktdidit,2,Tue Jul 7 21:25:02 2015 UTC,"I definitely recommend that you familiarize yourself with Delaware's Landlord-Tentant Code.  When I was in college, a few friends and I rented a house from a total Slumlord...he neglected to give us a list of damages in writing within 20 days of the termination of our rental agreement, but he tried to keep both our security and pet deposits, saying he had to replace the carpets and do other various repairs to the house. It was complete bull shit bc we left that house in better condition than how we got it (not to mention, we lived with a 3' hole in our living room ceiling which was leaking water from the bathroom tub for almost 6 months...we had to keep a huge bucket in the middle of the room, it was ridiculous!) So anyway, I had done my research and we took him to court and ended up winning DOUBLE our security and pet deposits back! Our Slumlord's argument in court was that we never provided him with our forwarding address (which we actually gave him in writing in person!). So he tried to say he didn't know where to send the list of damages. Luckily, the Judge sided in our favor, believing that we did give it to him in person! I would suggest that you send your landlord your forwarding address in a certified letter to the address he listed on your rental agreement...that way you are definitely covered!   Good luck to you!   Source:   State of Delaware Landlord-Tenant Code -Title 25  Chapter 55. Tenant Obligations and Landlord Remedies   § 5514. Security deposit.  (e) If the landlord is not entitled to all or any portion of the security deposit, the landlord shall remit the security deposit within 20 days of the expiration or termination of the rental agreement.   (f) Within 20 days after the termination or expiration of any rental agreement, the landlord shall provide the tenant with an itemized list of damages to the premises and the estimated costs of repair for each and shall tender payment for the difference between the security deposit and such costs of repair of damage to the premises. Failure to do so shall constitute an acknowledgment by the landlord that no payment for damages is due. Tenant's acceptance of a payment submitted with an itemized list of damages shall constitute agreement on the damages as specified by the landlord, unless the tenant, within 10 days of the tenant's receipt of such tender of payment, objects in writing to the amount withheld by the landlord.   (g) Penalties.   (1) Failure to remit the security deposit or the difference between the security deposit and the amount set forth in the list of damages within 20 days from the expiration or termination of the rental agreement shall entitle the tenant to DOUBLE the amount wrongfully withheld.   (2) Failure by a landlord to disclose the location of the security deposit account within 20 days of a written request by a tenant or failure by the landlord to deposit the security deposit in a federally-insured financial institution with an office that accepts deposits within the State, shall constitute forfeiture of the security deposit by the landlord to the tenant. Failure by the landlord to return the full security deposit to the tenant within 20 days from the effective date of forfeiture shall entitle the tenant to  DOUBLE the amount of the security deposit.

Delaware,3cfzz6,wingkingdom,2,Fri Jul 10 14:36:39 2015 UTC,"It's gonna take about 60 days from when someone says ""yes, I'll buy this"" to when the sale closes and you gots to go."
Delaware,3cfzz6,tisnolie,0,Wed Jul 8 01:28:18 2015 UTC,"No, I think that the new owner would legally take possession and then from that point you would have the customary 60 days from the first of the next month to vacate the premises.  They can't kick you out as soon as the sale closes.  You are legally a tenant and have established residency regardless of who owns the property.  It would be a month to month since you have not signed a lease with the new owner.  Obviously the landlord is going to have to notify potential buyers that it is a rental property.  As soon as an accepted offer is placed on the property, I think the right thing to do would be for the tenant to meet the new soon to be owner so they can establish a line of communication and an exit strategy.  The new owner may want to get into the property as soon as possible but may be ignorant of the law."
Delaware,3cfzz6,tisnolie,2,Wed Jul 8 02:09:37 2015 UTC,"As soon as it goes under contract they're gonna get a letter from their current landlord saying they have 60 days to kick rocks. That is unless the new owner wants to rent it as well. If not, they'll put it in the contract that settlement date will be like 65 days out. 60 days of notice, couple days clean up."
Delaware,3cf2ck,poncewattle,11,Tue Jul 7 12:21:06 2015 UTC,Wouldnt the better response be for de to reduce tolls for de residents in de instead?  I fail to see how raising tolls for md drivers in de is the proper response to md lowering tolls for thier residents.
Delaware,3cf2ck,krauttastic,2,Tue Jul 7 12:41:59 2015 UTC,"If we object to the practice of Maryland favoring their drivers, it would be hypocritical to do the same here. Raising taxes on MD drivers would even the scales."
Delaware,3cf2ck,psykulor,3,Tue Jul 7 13:38:16 2015 UTC,Why do we object to people saving a few bucks on tolls. Personally i think its a good thing. I like seeing people get a break from time to time.
Delaware,3cf2ck,krauttastic,3,Tue Jul 7 13:47:11 2015 UTC,"Because of petty jealousy.  I go through that $8 toll and the $4 one at the tunnel a few times a month.     ok, I'll compromise and settle for the police ticketing any MD driver who goes around the border toll to avoid it -- like they do for trucks."
Delaware,3cf2ck,wingkingdom,3,Tue Jul 7 14:31:16 2015 UTC,"Get a Maryland Ez-Pass with a Hatem Bridge option.  It's $20 a year for unlimited trips.  The drawback is you have to get off of 95 for a short distance and then cross the Route 40 bridge between Havre De Grace and Perryville, and then get back on 95.   I am from Delaware and I do this every day for work.  I see plates from a lot of other states using the Ez-Pass lanes, including states that don't even have Ez-Pass.  It used to be a decal you stuck on your car window that would get scanned.  I would see Washington plates all the time.  Here's what you do.  Get off on Route 22 in Aberdeen (Havre De Grace exit is pretty steep and they like to set up speed traps there).  Follow 22 east until you get to 40 East.  Take 40 East through Aberdeen and Havre De Grace.  Cross Susquehanna River, go through toll.  Make left onto Route 222 North in Perryville (right after toll).  Follow back to 95 North.  Watch your speed on the bridge and around the tolls.  MDTA cops are notorious for being jerks.  I think anyone with a Maryland Ez-Pass gets the discounts, not just those with Maryland addresses."
Delaware,3cf2ck,psykulor,1 point,Tue Jul 7 23:39:10 2015 UTC,"Oh, I don't object to the practice - but if anyone else does, raising MD tolls would be the logical rebuttal."

Delaware,3cf2ck,essenceofreddit,1 point,Tue Jul 7 13:58:31 2015 UTC,"Exactly.  They should offer a discount to all e-zpass holders. It helps them save money on toll takers and handling all that cash.   So we shouldn't do the same thing.    btw, the reason they lowered it was they had a surplus.

Delaware,3cblci,killcrew,1 point,Tue Jul 7 10:06:35 2015 UTC,"Yeah, I think it's way overblown.  Employees get let go all the time, employees quit all the time. It's not like they can say ""hey, come back.""    And next week reddit users won't give a shit.    The moderators, especially of AMA, have a legitimate concern. But really it's in reddit's best business interest to not ignore that because the celebrity ones are high profile.  Anyway, the Mongo story is interesting because /r/Delaware is certainly fairly intimate and it's not like mongo is a faceless stranger to us -- oh wait, he is.  :)"

It seems fairly capricious from the view of both moderators and users.   From your experience with their staff and capital resources, does it seem to you that the organization has the resources they need to administer the site and manage its growth effectively?  I understand that you cannot be completely frank here, but everything seems very flying-by-the-seat-of-your-pants when it comes to policymaking and administration."
Delaware,3cblci,killcrew,2,Mon Jul 6 18:45:36 2015 UTC,"SB, I don't know anything about how shadowbanning works. I'm a PR guy, after all.   But I'll try to answer your other questions --   As for the people being over their head, it's hard to say because back then, the staff was not located in one place. They were scattered at offices around the country, and many were working from home.   There was maybe 10 people in the NYC office.  For example, In one room, four senior executives were working from one room, about the size of two standard office cubicles.   In fact, Yishan, the CEO and Erik, the GM, worked on the same table. They sat across from each other.    Yep, I said 10. I was astounded. For one of the most visited and influential websites in the country, I expected they'd have their own floor in an office building, with dozens of people buzzing around, with different divisions, etc.   I asked about this lack of personnel during the interview and it was either Yishan or Erick who explained that it's one reason why Reddit is so successful - they have the right people and the right processes to do more with less."
Delaware,3cblci,Imightbeflirting,1 point,Mon Jul 6 19:21:11 2015 UTC,"do more with less.    Ah. Thanks.  Unsolicited opinion: This is a classic ""people don't matter"" blunder that a lot of immature private firms make. It's so easy to fall into this way of thinking with just a little bit of experience with what automation can do. It's what automation can't do that makes the big difference, and finding the balance between staffing levels and automation is the modern conundrum for so many organizations, both public and private."

It seems fairly capricious from the view of both moderators and users.    I'm not an admin but if you have specific examples I can tell you what the reasoning is known to be. The most recent batch of subreddit bannings was due to those places being hotbeds of global rules violations which moderators either didn't try to stop, or even participated in.

Delaware,3c8mmg,FalloutLoneWanderer,12,Sun Jul 5 22:44:19 2015 UTC,"Well you gotta wonder how many DON'T answer those polls/questionnaires. I'm originally from NJ, but after moving here to Delaware I've met far more gun owners and pro-gun individuals then I ever have before.   In their conclusion, the authors wrote that they found a ""strong association between social gun culture and gun ownership. Gun cultures may need to be considered for public health strategies that aim to change gun ownership in the USA.""   And this is why I say many folks most likely have not answered this poll. The people behind it are clearly against pro-gun culture and any questions they had about gun ownership would likely present criticism of the poll."
Delaware,3c8mmg,ronoverdrive,5,Mon Jul 6 00:54:43 2015 UTC,"Agreed. I'm a sometimes Hunter but an always shooter. I do a lot of precision rifle shooting and load my own rounds. I worked with a guy on a daily for almost a year before we both figured out that each other was into the shooting sports. Why? Because you don't talk about that shit. Ever.  As soon as you mention anything about guns or shooting, people's entire perception of you changes. You can literally watch it happen on someone's face. So unless you've known me for a long time, you're not going to know about it."
Delaware,3c8mmg,x888x,4,Mon Jul 6 11:00:26 2015 UTC,"Delaware doesn't have very friendly hunting laws for gun owners.  While gun laws themselves aren't bad in Delaware, you can't hunt deer with a rifle unless it's a muzzle loader so I could see it being lower in the regard that people don't need a gun to hunt here as opposed to other states, but I think this poll is way off.  Traditionally speaking,/u/x888x is correct.  To mention owning a gun, even if just for hunting, people really do look differently at you.  Given that Delaware is a more liberal state, your propensity to keeping your gun ownership to yourself is much more likely than if you lived in a more conservative state where gun ownership isn't frowned upon."
Delaware,3c8mmg,ODBrunizz,5,Mon Jul 6 13:11:47 2015 UTC,Delaware is relatively lax on gun laws. You don't have to register anything. There's no permit to own. You can open carry almost anywhere outside of Dover with zero paperwork.   There's a lot of guns floating around that aren't represented by this poll.

Delaware,3c0shz,borticus,3,Fri Jul 3 19:02:49 2015 UTC,"I only had the occasion to meet the Dover VFD once. My apartment building caught on fire and they were the guys who showed up. It happened early in the afternoon and I didn't know about it until I got home, so they were already there and for the most part the fire was out. I didn't get to interact with them. The only direct observation I could conclude is that they were very thorough in clearing out the building. Everyone's door was crashed open, requiring all residents - even those whose apartments weren't destroyed by fire or needed to be rebuilt because of water damage - to find another place to stay until the doors could be replaced. I was equally impressed that the Red Cross and the Mayor showed up."
Delaware,3c0shz,borticus,1 point,Fri Jul 3 21:15:07 2015 UTC,The local Red Cross is great.  Some people don't think they do enough to help people after a disaster/fire but I think it's enough to get people started on the road to recovery.  I'm glad you respected how thorough they were.  Most people would assume we break things for no reason but that's hardly the case.
Delaware,3c0shz,OurNewAntOverlords,2,Sat Jul 4 10:14:56 2015 UTC,"In our specific case they were offering hotel stays. I don't remember specifics mostly because of time, but I didn't accept the offer. We were fortunate in that we had local friends who would help us for a couple of days until we were clear to return. Our apartment wasn't effected by either fire or water.  I am equally grateful for building codes and regulations (and design improvements). Without a firebreak I'm sure the whole building would have gone up."
Delaware,3c0shz,OurNewAntOverlords,2,Sat Jul 4 19:53:35 2015 UTC,"The average stay they provide people with is usually around 3 days.  However, some of those affected by fire/disaster think the Red Cross takes care of them until they get back into their permanent home."

I always wanted to join the firehouse, Elsmere or another fire house in the county however their so incestuous in a way which makes that hard to do especially if you are not liked by one of those family members.

You would expect a firehouse to be professional, and not run like a high school. While I would love nothing more than to be a firefighter, it's just not worth it in New Castle County. It's not worth the drama, it's not worth the politics, it's not worth walking around on eggshells around certain members.

Delaware,3bvygs,chick-fil-atio,2,Thu Jul 2 18:35:41 2015 UTC,"It's not silly at all. Why do you think there is so much development  in PA right over the DE/PA state line? PA public schools are great. If you have a few kids it's far cheaper to move to PA, pay more in property taxes while sending them to a good public school than it is to put 2-3 kids into a cheap private school in DE. I know several people who lived in PA and worked in DE for that very reason."
Delaware,3bvygs,talley89,2,Thu Jul 2 18:46:56 2015 UTC,"Why would wealthy people put their children in a ""cheap"" private school? Tower Hill is not remotely cheap."
Delaware,3bvygs,chick-fil-atio,3,Thu Jul 2 18:49:23 2015 UTC,That's my point. The extra property taxes in PA is still cheaper than a cheap private school for multiple kids let alone tuition at someplace like Tower Hill.

Delaware,3bvygs,HarlanStone16,3,Thu Jul 2 19:10:17 2015 UTC,"Most estimates suggest this would raise less than $10 million. example  Even if you want to assume much higher traffic because the state is so small you are talking 10-15 million tops.  Decriminalization probably does most of what you suggest on the expenditure side anyway and those portions of the budget are relatively small. Corrections is the largest item you've mentioned, is trending downward thanks to a lot of efforts made by Markell (including decriminalization).  Pot isn't going to save anyone from a budget perspective, even if it would be nice to enjoy it freely."
Delaware,3bvygs,x888x,3,Thu Jul 2 19:58:35 2015 UTC,I'll take $10 million per year in perpetuity over one-time $30million lawsuit windfalls and volatile casino revenues.
Delaware,3bvygs,chick-fil-atio,2,Thu Jul 2 20:56:41 2015 UTC,"I should say I agree with your sentiment.    But perpetuity assumes that other states won't also legalize and then you face the same problem as was seen with casino revenues on a smaller scale.      If you are worried the State is too reliant on the casinos, the market is going to take care of that for us all sooner or later.    Preferring $10 million to the casino revenues (~200m this year?) or the 30 million in settlement money however still does not solve the problems those two sources pay for, so really you prefer $10 million more to go along with those revenue sources.    Again, pot just isn't the solution in terms of revenue, even if legal pot would be fun."

If they won't do it, you are allowed to chop every part that's hanging over your property, from top to bottom. They don't want that, and you probably don't either. Hopefully, they'll do the right thing and come out and trim their tree.  Responsive and responsible tree maintenance is cheap insurance for good park managers."

Delaware,3boekj,pixelguru,3,Tue Jun 30 23:10:02 2015 UTC,"It's true. The park maintenance people I work with are still swamped with weather-related clean up sites from last weekend. I just found a new one today that will require some specialized equipment and a decent number of man hours to make it safe for the public and relatively-healthy for the tree(s) involved.   If someone sees any existing storm-related damage in a public park, they should make sure the park's maintenance crew knows about it. Objective and concerned calls from the public are an important resource for parks."
Delaware,3boekj,TheShittyBeatles,2,Tue Jun 30 23:35:25 2015 UTC,"And a geo-tagged photo of the damage sent with the report helps a lot in pinpointing the location, and estimating the cleanup effort and equipment needed."

I gathered this data for this using a modified version of a script made by the folks over at /r/MUWs. If you want to create your own word cloud for another subreddit, you can post requests there. I have also done several requests and as I have several sports and city related dictionaries I use to filter out particularly common words that are not normally detected. If you would like one made for any subs, just say the word and I'll crank it out. The actual word maps were made through Wordle. My apologies if these are difficult to see. I suffer from monochromatic colorblindness, so I had to use hex codes I found online when putting this together. Common words such as ""city"", “the”, “and”, “I'm”, as well as numbers were removed from the clouds.  I will be using this data to update my state/city/regional subreddit profanity analysis. I will also be running the numbers to see which of the subs have the most active discussion. My city and international clouds should be coming out in a week or so.  If you have any questions about specific frequencies of the words, the top words are under the third image in the album. I typically removed the largest words on the second and third images, as they were so large they typically made the other words harder to see. Only two states had words larger than their state name/abbreviation as the largest word, Wisconsin with ""Walker"" (our governor) and California with ""Water"".

Delaware,3b74c0,appleseedmark,3,Fri Jun 26 14:39:55 2015 UTC,"And here's the article:   Delaware’s first medical marijuana dispensary opened Friday, four years after the state Legislature legalized its use.  The First State Compassion Center at 37 Germay Drive outside of Wilmington is open from 10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. Users must be registered medical marijuana cardholders with the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services.  The United States Drug Enforcement Administration still classifies marijuana for any purpose as an illegal Schedule 1 substance, along with heroin and methamphetamine.  Marijuana “has no accepted medical use in the United States,” according the 2014 National Drug Threat Assessment Summary from a D.E.A.  The U.S. Congress passed a bill in December directing federal law enforcement to not arrest medical marijuana sellers. House and Senate committees earlier this month passed amendments to spending bills that would prohibit the U.S. Department of Justice from using federal dollars to target medical marijuana operations.  Under state law, and with certification from a doctor, Delawareans can use marijuana to treat symptoms associated with cancer; Alzheimer's disease; post-traumatic stress disorder; and conditions that cause intractable nausea, severe pain or seizures, among other illnesses.  Gov. Jack Markell signed a bill last week that decriminalizes the possession of 1 ounce or less of marijuana for personal use. The law, which takes effect in six months, eliminates criminal penalties for possession. A violation will be considered a civil offense punishable by a $100 fine and would not become part of a person's criminal record."

This is just a reason to stop people who should be otherwise free to go about thier business and check and see if there are any warrants or other arrestable/ticketable offenses. They hide behind the farce that they need to do this to get awareness out there about drunken boating when people are being responsible on thier own anyway.

Those guys ticketed the shit out of people for DUI.  Lots of idiots got drunk, ran out of fuel and just floated down river.  Flagged for help and police arrested them and took both boating and drivers licence for like a year.  People are so stupid.    And I worked in a nuclear power plant doing perimeter security post 9/11, we had a federally protected air and water zone.  Anytime someone went into our marked are we drove up with sirens and told them to leave.  If they were drunk we would hold them at gun point with automatic rifles until police arrived.  It seriously freaked them out, but there are like a million signs leading up to the clearly marked area.  We took out jobs very seriously.  Fully armed and armored soldiers in uniform.  And we're not going to let a drunk boaters go when he could kill someone else by being stupid.  I mean, we once had a same color van visit all the nuclear power plants in new York state and take tons of pictures.  Every time we tried to just walk up all friendly and ask him what he was doing he would speed away.  Don't know what ever happened with that guy, but he was actually probing all the nuclear plant security positions.  So these drunk boaters, lol..... Shit out of luck if we caught them.  If delaware doesn't have many drunk boaters good for you.  But holy shit, in NY state it was a totally different story."

Delaware,3ayprc,qovneob,2,Wed Jun 24 16:13:32 2015 UTC,"Got the panels and posts from Lowes.  They give a pretty good discount if you order more than 25, plus i got another 5% off using my lowes card and had a friend get me his military discount.  We rented an augur from HD for one side of the yard, the rest was too close to my neighbor's fences to run it so those were all dug by hand.  Its really not complicated, just a lot of labor.  I put up 42 panels in a month of weekends and occasional evenings.  Did about 2/3 of that solo.  If you do go that route (and have a lot of panels to do) definitely look into getting an impact driver.   I had six 4"" screws per panel, tried one with the 18v drill and it struggled.  The impact driver saved me a ton of time."

I had to tie my dog for about a week till we closed the gap with the neighbor's fences so that wasnt too bad.  I could have done it quicker but I'm lazy and one weekend was Oktoberfest.  If I took off work I think I could've done it in a week.  On my own I could do one hole/post/panel in about an hour, with clever use of clamps and shims.  With an extra pair of hands we cut that time more than in half.  The biggest delays were hitting roots (which i had a ton of) and waiting for the quickrete to set, but you can always spend that time digging the next few holes.  At least look into the cost difference of supplies.  Cement and a post hole digger are cheap, panels/posts in bulk arent too bad even with a delivery fee.   Fence installs are super expensive and the time/labor I invested was well worth the few thousand dollars saved."

Delaware,3ayprc,donteatmysandwich,1 point,Wed Jun 24 18:45:58 2015 UTC,"BG Halko in New Castle builds panels and Bob from AC Fence uses their panels.  We had him come out, but ended up going with another contractor (wasn't my decision, so not sure why).  If you do decide to do it yourself, at least look around and compare the panels.  I think Halko makes some good panels for their prices. You can see the panels on Churchman's Road just up from the Airport Road intersection.  But their actual office is on Old Churchman's.  I think also off Airport Road.  Lowe's doesn't install their own fencing. If you call them, they will come out and estimate a very expensive stick built fence.  The Fence Authority installs for Lowe's (I saw some of their invoices on the dash of the truck).  This is who we went with.  They also build their own sections of fence. They are in West Chester and Smyrna. Overall it was a positive experience - the old fence practically fell down and the guys were late the first day because they were finishing up a job for another customer that took extra time.  Took three of them less than a day and a half to put up 20 or so panels plus a fence.  My gripe with them was that they initially installed them too close to the ground (they did one run that first day), but they corrected that after a phone call that night.  Overall very pleased with how it turned out in the end.  Takes about 6 months or so to season a fence, need to get around to finishing it.  Was thinking a waterproof stain/sealant combo."

Delaware,3atunm,methodwriter85,3,Tue Jun 23 19:29:06 2015 UTC,That's one heck of a commute.
Delaware,3atunm,lotsoluck,3,Tue Jun 23 16:51:27 2015 UTC,"If I could catch a cheap train from Newark and didn't have to drive all the way to Perryville to catch the one too-early train to DC, that's where I'd be working. For me, the extra money would more than pay for the commute time, which wouldn't be too bad, depending on how you use the time."
Delaware,3atunm,lotsoluck,2,Tue Jun 23 19:28:05 2015 UTC,"Fair point. At least you could use that 4+ hours on a train everyday to do something useful (like pursue an advanced degree, or learn how to paint with charcoal), which is something you can't really say about driving. Audio books and podcasts only go so far."
Delaware,3atunm,poncewattle,1 point,Tue Jun 23 21:04:13 2015 UTC,"Definitely. Another potential benefit is being permitted to be more flexible with daily/weekly work hours, especially if there's any job task(s) that can be done with decent-quality wi-fi/cell access and the appropriate remote network connection(s). It depends on the nature of the work, though. Lots of DC-area jobs are public safety- or healthcare-related and the information they deal with might not fit with remote work."

I'm not sure what the deal is, but it happens. My guess is that the regular carrier is on vacation and they couldn't get a (reliable) casual carrier to cover the route.

Delaware,3aqck9,TheShittyBeatles,14,Mon Jun 22 17:27:35 2015 UTC,Here's the video my buddy took after the driver got out- https://instagram.com/p/4N1GktS_FD/
Delaware,3aqck9,Grumpynachos,3,Mon Jun 22 18:02:23 2015 UTC,"Interesting.  I wonder what move he was trying to make, that he ended up there?  There's that short connector in front of Wonderland Records that's intended to accommodate a movement from eastbound Main Street onto northbound New London Road...but the article states he was moving westbound on Main Street.  Did he miss the turn onto NLR and try to use that connector to fix his mistake?  In any event, the connector is close to the tracks, and isn't signed.  I can see a motorist getting confused as to where the entry point is, exactly...particularly at night, if someone has poor night vision.  There's no signage nor lane markings there, and if you miss it, you're in deep doo-doo."
Delaware,3aqck9,pancakeonmyhead,3,Mon Jun 22 22:20:00 2015 UTC,"I think a lot of Newark signage is weak and assumes that drivers are really familiar with the area.  Maybe it's just me looking for excuses though for that one time when I was interviewing at UD, and in town for the very first time, and drove the wrong way on Delaware coming off Tyre because signage was so, so bad and the street really looks like there's a lane to turn right into.  I may have some bias about the signs so I can continue to think I'm a really solid driver despite that incident.  I also see people drive the wrong way on Main St at least once every two months."
Delaware,3aqck9,dumonsl,2,Tue Jun 23 00:25:26 2015 UTC,"I just took a look at the 2007 Google Street View of that intersection.  There's a ""No Right Turn"" sign, but if you're a bit beyond the stop line, it'd be even with the driver's seat of your car and thus impossible to read.  There are fairly small ""No Right Turn"" and ""One Way"" signs located across the intersection, but IMO they're easy to miss.  If you look to the right, you'll see that the curbside lane nearest you on Delaware Avenue is separated from the next-nearest lane using a yellow line, as if it were an opposing lane of traffic rather than a shoulder or parking lane.  You're right, the whole setup is very confusing.  O.o"
Delaware,3aqck9,pancakeonmyhead,2,Tue Jun 23 03:30:46 2015 UTC,That's exactly right.  And I was first there in Jan of 2007 when there was snow too.  It was terrifying.  Once you've made the mistake of being in the shoulder going the wrong way your first option to try to correct is to turn the wrong way into the bus station lane.  Not a good option.  It was certainly not my finest moment.
Delaware,3aqck9,dumonsl,1 point,Tue Jun 23 14:31:32 2015 UTC,"They could fix this fairly cheaply, too, for the cost of some lane restriping.  Option 1:  turn the last 200 or so feet of the left-hand shoulder into a left-turn lane.  Move the yellow line next to the curb, and put a large left-turn arrow on the pavement right at the intersection.  This would make it obvious that you're not turning right into some kind of westbound travel lane.  Option 2:  put yellow hash striping on the last 100 or so feet of the left-hand shoulder to indicate 'travel prohibited here'."
Delaware,3aqck9,pancakeonmyhead,2,Tue Jun 23 15:57:14 2015 UTC,"Yep!  I do think the sign across the street is a little clearer now, but I totally agree.  I have classes 4 nights a week right now but when I'm done working full time and going to school full time I'm planning to get involved in the Newark City Council in someway.  I will make this my first order of business!  Kidding, but only slightly."

That whole setup there is just a cluster-F. If you don't know intersection it is easy to do. They need to do something and should not be ignoring it.

Mug club members generally receive discounts and sometimes larger pours depending on the club. I'm a member of two clubs, Stewart's and Argilla (on Kirkwood Hwy) and I love going to both. Next, learn the difference between IPA, Belgians, Stouts, Porters, Pilsners, Abbey Dubbel, Trippel, and Quads, and taste as many as you can to find your favorite.  Finally, tour some breweries (e.g. Victory, Dogfish Head, Dominion) and get some education early as you can.

Delaware,3api3y,Wail_Bait,3,Mon Jun 22 15:34:11 2015 UTC,"I asked the guy at ComicMania how much it woudl cost to start playing MTG. He asked ""do you want to play or do you want to win"", and I responded with ""Well if I'm playing, it would be nice to win.""  At this point, he told me not to bother because it would just be so expensive to be competitive. I bought comic books instead."
Delaware,3api3y,Figitman,2,Mon Jun 22 15:39:04 2015 UTC,"He was wrong, I have a very expensive standard deck and I've won three tournaments in the last 3 week's with it, but he must have forgotten the winning deck at the biggest mtg tournament of the year. That deck costs less than $100 and is the expensive version of the deck. I have a cheap version of the deck $20-30 and it can (and does) regularly beat my $300-400 deck. If you ever want to learn I can teach you how to play."
Delaware,3api3y,louiscool,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:34:45 2015 UTC,"There are some inexpensive ways to play. I like doing booster draft games, which costs about $10 per person. Each person starts with three booster packs, and you pass them around taking one card at a time. When that's done each person takes the cards they drafted and any amount of land to build a 40 card deck. Since everyone starts off with booster packs there's some luck involved, but for the most part a skilled player will win most of their games."
Delaware,3api3y,sillyboy42,1 point,Mon Jun 22 14:41:23 2015 UTC,Sad thing is he's almost right. Unless you get lucky on your packs.
Delaware,3api3y,colefly,-1,Mon Jun 22 15:32:16 2015 UTC,"He's so wrong.  Don't play constructed, that is expensive as hell most of the time, but I used to play a few years ago and was able to compete with a 60 dollar investment in a white monster deck (mostly Kors, and removal).  Also, you can very easily and cheaply play Sealed Decks or Drafts.  They usually cost like 15 bucks on a Saturday and you get to keep the cards."
Delaware,3api3y,Immasillygoose,2,Mon Jun 22 14:39:31 2015 UTC,"I haven't touched my MTG cards in at least 15 years, maybe more. I still have them in a binder with my comic books.   Every once in a while I think about breaking them out and playing but I'm not sure if the old decks are even competative at this point."
Delaware,3api3y,colefly,1 point,Mon Jun 22 17:06:40 2015 UTC,"You don't have to be competitive at comic mania. On Saturday and monday a lot of people show up for casual day. It's where people bring all the random shit they have, all the random deck they have, and just have a fun time talking about shit and playing a card game. I think you'd enjoy it, and depending on what cards you have you could easily make a bit of money and buy some new cards for more current decks."

Delaware,3ajqcx,Phlying_nutz,1 point,Wed Jun 24 20:39:19 2015 UTC,What's up? How'd you make out with the storm? I was without laptop or PC power most of last night. Felt like I was going to revert back to the stone ages. Next time I'm planning ahead to have stuff charged so at least I can ride it out and binge watch stuff I've got on my external hard drive. Gotta move stuff to my laptop as a precaution for emergencies and keep it charged.
Delaware,3ajqcx,Kilifi,2,Wed Jun 24 20:47:22 2015 UTC,"The storm was pretty intense. We lost power but got it back last night around 8-9pm. My router (which was custom built) lost its hard drive to the outage, though, so I ended up spending a couple hours rebuilding it and reinstalling/reconfiguring pfSense.  I still don't have Comcast back up, though, so I don't actually know if it works. Using my cell phone right now.  I was glad we got power back relatively quickly, since we're on wellwater out here and having no power to run the well pump sucks."
Delaware,3ajqcx,bonersize,1 point,Wed Jun 24 19:07:19 2015 UTC,I have three external hard drives full of junk I wanna keep. I usually keep them unplugged unless I'm moving files to save or moving them to a PC or laptop to use. Everything else  would be an irritation and inconvenience if I lost it. But the back up ext HDs I'm very careful with since they have a lot of media files and stuff that would cost a bit to replace. I rewired some of the electrical in the house a while back.  Made dedicated lines for some of my primary electronics etc. but when I he's a storm is coming that's going to be bad my first line of defense is just to unplug stuff heh

Also, I guarantee you that if his child (if he has one) got caught with a small amount of ""weed"" he would not want that child going to jail over it..."

Delaware,3acdk2,TheShittyBeatles,7,Fri Jun 19 13:11:13 2015 UTC,"First, as an active Republican, it's pretty disappointing that not a single Republican legislator voted for this. Makes it tough for young Republicans to rally to the party when leadership makes a mockery of the whole limited government, personal freedom claim.  Hilariously, with this bill there's still a fine for private use. So personal possession is okay (wink wink), but not okay because we're still going to fine you a hundred bucks.  Unfortunately this change to the law ignores the entire distribution side of the equation. Where do lawmakers think pot comes from? Does it get magic'd into people's homes by the weed fairy once a fortnight? So while decriminalization is a step in the right direction, it leaves distribution in the hands of criminals, which I would argue is the most dangerous societal element created by drug prohibition. Decriminalization really is a poor shadow of full legalization, but on the upside people are a little freer and at least a small burden is lifted from the justice system by not prosecuting possession in small amounts.  Hopefully full legalization is in Delaware's future in the near term."

Good luck  Karl Baker, The News Journal 8:44 p.m. EDT June 17, 2015 RedLightTicket.edited2 (Photo: COURTESY OF JIM MURPHY) CONNECT  2 TWEET LINKEDIN COMMENT EMAIL MORE RedLightCameraBuy Photo A car turns onto North Van Buren Street in Wilmington, where a red-light camera monitors the junction with Delaware Avenue. Few challenges to these citations are ever successful. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL) Judge Susan Cline stepped into a small crowded courtroom in Prices Corner full of drivers hoping to contest red-light tickets.  It was a similar scene she repeats several times some days. And what she told the 20 or so people there was not what they wanted to hear.  She explained, basically, that they were wasting their time. The way the law is written, it is unlikely they will be able to successfully contest a ticket issued via a red-light camera.  ""The city does not have to prove intent, or even that you were the driver of the vehicle,"" said Cline.  Red-light tickets are only dismissed for a few select reasons, and as a result, not many drivers win challenges. The Justice of the Peace Court 10, in Prices Corner, reviewed 850 challenges in 2013, 724 of which originated in Wilmington, according to the most recent data provided by the court. Of those cases, the judge dismissed just 63, about 7 percent.  If a driver was moving out of the way of an emergency vehicle or a funeral procession, then their case could be dismissed, Cline said. Or if a police officer or construction worker directed their vehicle through a red light. Poor weather is not a defense, nor is failing to see a traffic light because of large vehicles that might be blocking their view, she said.  After listening to Cline, Jim Murphy, a project manager, who lives near New Castle, decided not to fight. On a snowy day in February, he had crept through a red light at 13 mph on Pennsylvania Avenue in Wilmington, he said, fearing that he would skid into another vehicle had he tried to stop.  ""I could have gone to trial with the judge, but she said she wouldn't accept these [weather] defenses,"" he said.  Murphy said the acceptable defenses should be listed on the citations that are mailed to drivers. Not only would he not have wasted his time at the courthouse, he said, but he would not have had to pay $35 in court costs.  Although Delaware's Justices of the Peace oversee red-light infractions across the state, most of the drivers at the Prices Corner courthouse were there because of tickets issued by Wilmington. In 2014, the city shortened the grace period granted to motorists after a signal switches from yellow to red, which has increased the number of citations.  That same year, Wilmington officials said that they expected to boost revenue from its 33 red-light cameras by a third to more than $4 million by dismissing fewer violations.  DELAWAREONLINE Delaware's top spots for red-light camera tickets  The city earned $3.1 million from its red-light cameras in the fiscal year 2014. Its total revenue during that year was $146 million.  The state of Delaware's red-light program, which manages most cameras in the state outside of Wilmington, took in $1.5 million in 2014. It also contended with far fewer in-court challenges than the city. In 2014, 260 drivers contested tickets, and 30 of them were dismissed, according to a report from the Delaware Department of Transportation.  The report also attributed a decrease in ""angle crashes"" to red-light cameras that had been implemented at 30 intersections around the state.  Researchers from the University of South Florida, in 2014, evaluated national data from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety and determined red-light cameras did not cause reductions in fatal crash rates.  WIL RED LIGHT CAMERABuy Photo Cars pass a red-light camera on Walnut Street at the intersection with A Street in Wilmington. (Photo: WILLIAM BRETZGER/THE NEWS JOURNAL) In February, Reps. Ed Perlmutter from Colorado and Albio Sires from New Jersey, sponsored a resolution to ban red-light cameras across the country, stating that the increased use in the United States had not reduced crashes.  ""Police officers are the only sure way to apprehend seriously impaired, reckless or other dangerous drivers,"" Perlmutter said in a statement.  Jim Prendergast, a construction worker from Virginia, thinks it's unjust that he has to pay court fees to contest his ticket, which occurred when he turned right onto North Scott Street from Fourth Street in Wilmington. He had driven all the way to Prices Corner from the Washington, D.C., area on Tuesday.  ""They charge you more if you want to have your fair day in court,"" he said.  DELAWAREONLINE Delaware traffic closures  Sitting across from Prendergast, when Judge Cline entered the room, was the city attorney, a retired police officer and a representative from the Xerox Corp., the company that oversees the camera systems in Delaware. Rather than a ticket issuing-officer, it's the video and images from the Xerox's red-light cameras that are the main witnesses against the motorists.  The company earned $2.7 million in 2014, from the red-light cameras that are overseen by the state of Delaware. Xerox's cut of the revenue from Wilmington was $1.5 million during the fiscal year 2014.  Xerox's government and transportation operations worldwide accounted for 17 percent of its services revenue, or about $ 1.8 billion in 2014, according to its annual report.  David Bowie, a Wilmington resident who works at the University of Pennsylvania, called Xerox after receiving a ticket for making a right-hand turn through a red light on Lancaster Avenue, near I-95. Perhaps surprisingly, the company recommended that Bowie contest the ticket, he said. Although he appears to have a case, Bowie knew when he passed through the light that a ticket would soon arrive in his mailbox.  ""I slowed down at the light, then the camera went 'flip, flip,' "" he said.  Just to save folks the paywall attempt."

I am thinking, especially, of families with small children.   A second point: I think you would be hard pressed to find someone who doesn't exceed the speed limit by 5 or more mphs on a regular basis, but the speed limit is the speed limit. It has been almost universally accepted that cops will not ticket minor violations of the limit, but maybe that's not right. And maybe the whole broken widows policing idea has something to it. Just some thoughts."
Delaware,3a34dw,katiecarbaholic,3,Wed Jun 17 02:43:40 2015 UTC,"I think for the most part that can be true, but not in those well known speed trap cities such as Elsmere and Newport. You drive through there going anything over and if a cop is sitting in wait they'll get you. The only time I've ever been pulled over was in Elsmere and the cop clocked me at the same speed as OP, 41 in a 35, but since it was my first time he dropped it to 40 so the ticket was only $60 instead of $100. So it sounds like these speed cameras may not give a shit if it's only 5 over."

Except for the Big U, the entire Newark area seems to be kind of struggling financially, and, as someone else noted, College2 is located adjacent to a fairly poor area.  Three of the businesses in College2 are a payday loan place, a dollar store, and a cigarette outlet.  None of those suggest that people in the neighborhood have a lot of discretionary income.  (Cigarette smoking has a fairly strong inverse correlation to educational attainment, which in turn has a fairly strong positive correlation with income.)  The internet has put a big dent in mid-level retail generally, so that's been hurting strip shopping center retail badly no matter where you are.  College2 is just the other side of too far to be readily walkable from the UDel campus.  Bikeable, maybe.  But what's there of interest to a student in College2, other than maybe the liquor store (of which there are probably half-a-dozen closer by) and the supermarket (not really all that useful if you're living in a residence hall and have a meal plan)?

Delaware,39pq48,Cdubyah,1 point,Sun Jun 14 03:56:02 2015 UTC,"While I am definitely sympathetic to the noise issue, I don't see how this is even remotely constitutional. You cannot tell people how they use their property. If you want to fine them for noise, then do that. But telling an owner who he is and is not permitted to let in his pool that's on his property? What next; am I no longer allowed to invite guests over to sit on my deck? Expect this to get challenged quickly and effectively in the courts if it is passed by Rehoboth."
Delaware,39pq48,ktappe,2,Sun Jun 14 03:10:25 2015 UTC,Zoning regulations exist for the purpose of telling peopld how they can use their property.  These areas are zoned as residential and many of these houses are run as hotels.

People moved to Rehoboth for year-round living, then their neighbor puts a pool in, disturbing their privacy late nights.  It's not so cut and dry.  Those renters used to cool off in the ocean.  And while people can call the police, it definitely creates an uncomfortable environment.  Better the city put down some laws to govern the situation.

Now if noise is took loud or too late, call the cops for a noise citation.  When my wife and I go on vacation we enjoy sitting in the pool late at night and drinking. Just the two of us. Not loudly. Relaxing.  You can't tell people what to do on private property. They can do whatever they want up to the extent that it affects others. Swimming in a pool does not do that. Loud noises? That does. This is logic and law 101 stuff.   If people are causing a problem, be an adult and call the cops."
Delaware,39pq48,x888x,2,Sun Jun 14 00:11:38 2015 UTC,"Noise complaints are notoriously one of the most difficult code violations to meaningfully enforce.  With respect to equipment, you have to furnish officers with top notch decibel readers, not just a phone app. that measures noise, because if/when the town is challenged the credibility of the evidence for the violation will largely hinge on the quality of the equipment that generated evidence of the alleged nuisance.  In terms of the complained-of noise, that noise may have temporarily abated by the time an officer arrives on the scene. This often happens either because the tenants observe a policeman arrive and turn down the noise until the officer leaves, and turn it back up when the officer's gone, or by the time the officer gets to the scene, the tenants have taken a temporary break from the noise-generating activity, only to later resume that activity. Moreover, police officers generally view enforcement of noise complaints as unimportant work involving ""Hatfield and McCoy""-type disputes, so it's also unlikely that noise complainants will be prioritized relative to other law enforcement needs.  Many local governments go much farther than this and have outright banned short-term rentals, and unlike private pools, government-owned property such as local parks observe strict hours governing when activity may lawfully occur there.  In sum, noise complaints consume inordinate resources and are notoriously difficult to meaningfully or practically enforce, and compared to many other local governments' prohibitions of short-term rentals altogether, this measure, if adopted, would hardly eclipse any private property rights based on the state or Federal constitutions.  To say ""just deal with it, it's a beach town,"" reflects a short-sighted view of local history. In the past, coastal Sussex County accommodated visitors to its beaches and each town simultaneously preserved a standing population of permanent residents.  Only very recently, has the influx of summer visitors resulted in more residences experiencing changes in use from permanent residential to seasonal short-term rental, in part because it's difficult to live and work in a community with few permanent residents, and in part because it's difficult to raise children during their summer breaks when the neighborhood's replete with drunk and/or raucous short-term tenants with little skin in the game."

It would be great to be able to take a very fast train (bus is too slow and sits in traffic) to Lewes, Rehoboth, and Dewey; then, I'd like the same quick way home at the middle and end of the day/night/late night.

It might not be a money maker but it'd be nice to be able to take a tram from even Dover or Milford to Rehoboth and not have to worry about traffic or parking.

There's a little construction on it right now, looks like they're fixing the road and building a development.  You can usually do a steady 45, up to 60+ when there's no traffic.  And there's no passing on most of it.  The Lewes area is awesome.  If it's too far of a drive, Millsboro seems very nice, I haven't heard anything negative about it, and have been there a bunch of times.  There are new townhomes there that start at 100k, so you could probably afford one of those if you don't want to rent.  Lewes is very safe.

The soil used to encapsulate the polluted ground was reused from a wetland restoration project, which saved the State about $3 million and made a blighted piece of land into something that's moderately-useful.

The owner seems nice enough to me - a bit talkative but nice. Can't say for certain.  I love food and coffee, so I can tell you my favorite places for those. The coffee is amazing at all Brew HaHa locations (I had a couple of bad experiences at the one on 202 though). My favorite coffee comes from Drip Cafe in Hockessin, but that may be a bit far from where you are - they also have my favorite breakfast and lunch food. If you like Mediterranean food, Ali Baba in Newark and Gyro King are really good (I come from a Lebanese family so I have to mention these places, lol). I'm not sure where in Wilmington you will be, but the Riverfront Market has a bakery and a Thai place that are really tasty (I haven't tried everything in there yet). The Iron Hill (Riverfront) is my favorite place around the area for dinner and beer. The IMAX theater (Riverfront)  is pretty cozy for movies."

Our mill rates in Christina District are stupidly low, and our tax assessments in NCCo are stuck in the 1980's. The first referendum failed because people didn't know about it. Given how much of a swing there was between the results of the first and the second, and the jump in turnout, it stands to reason (in my mind, at least) that if they had actually tried to get people to come out and vote for the first one AND the second (instead of just the second) they might have actually passed the second.

Delaware,39grjk,CxOrillion,2,Thu Jun 11 19:08:58 2015 UTC,"Not necessarily. Laws vary by state.  Assault in Delaware requires physical injury. That clearly didn't happen. So its not assault.  It could be construed as aggravated menacing, but its still unlikely:   ""A person is guilty of aggravated menacing when by displaying what appears to be a deadly weapon that person intentionally places another person in fear of imminent physical injury. Aggravated menacing is a class E felony.""  From what a law professor at UD told me, aggravated menacing requires you to point the deadly weapon (knife, gun, etc) at them. Pointing to the gun wouldn't be considered aggravated menacing.   Plus he didn't point to his gun, he pointed to his badge. If he were not a cop, he wouldn't have a badge to point to."

You have three different sections of the river you can raft on plus rafting on a separate river (the Cheat River - which is unfortunately closing at the end of this month due to the short season they have. It is actually in WV.)  I used to go to school out that way.  The scenery in western MD and in WV and PA is pretty amazing.  Never went rafting, though I did hear of trips being organized and such.
