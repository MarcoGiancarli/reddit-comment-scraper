webdev,3e2mff,wesbos,3,Tue Jul 21 15:59:25 2015 UTC,"Do not get sucked into the vortex of nerd insanity that is keeping up with the absolute latest and greatest in web development.  It's just exhausting, and as you rightly imply, it's overwhelming.  I'd even go so far as to say that it just isn't helpful for a lot of people in a lot of situations.  I don't mean to downplay the fantastic new technologies that are always coming out: they are super awesome, and to the extent that you can at least keep up with what sorts of problems they solve (i.e. why you would use something like grunt or gulp, not necessarily how to actually configure each in your sleep, why you would use a CSS preprocessor, not necessarily the intricacies of LESS vs SASS), you'll be a better advocate than probably 90% of the people who work as web developers today.  For every startup out there working on a really awesome adoption of the newest framework, I'd wager that you could find at least 8-9 companies that have a process that is several years old at least and that is going to be somewhat resistant to change, or that has been shaped by weird quirks that no online tutorial or documentation will prepare you for.  And there's a good reason for that: companies can't afford to switch their technology stack all the time.  They have to make relatively stable commitments to their procedures so that they can tell their HR departments who to bring in for interviews, and to keep working uninterrupted on their projects.  With that inertia comes a certain amount of atrophying of skills, and I'd argue that a great web developer should be able to help an organization adopt best practices, but you can't pick that fight for everything all the time.    Having good fundamental knowledge of what's out there means that you can pick up whatever specific quirks are going to be relevant for your job.  If you're in the early stages of deciding if this is a career you want to pursue, focus on really learning a language and broadly understanding trends and learn to trust in yourself that you can adopt and learn whatever new skills you'll need.  The skills you'll need to learn one language will be strongly transferable to another."

Don't rush out and learn the JS framework of the week just because it's getting raved about. You know it won't be around next year, so don't waste your time on it.   Also, pay attention to the cyclical nature of IT in general. For instance, we went from mainframes with centralized storage and services to the PC revolution, back to centralized storage and services (i.e.: the cloud).  So, we'll come back around at some point. Most things that seem new are just variations of what has been around for decades.  So, it is best to figure out what you like to do. And stay current on things that revolve around that. You can't know everything and you can't learn everything.

Sometimes you can just use these new things in your project at work and get paid to learn them.  Outside study does help but it's more likely you'll only have time at work.  In web dev there is lots of downtime to learn at work so don't worry about this stuff.  It's the same everywhere. You must know your basics of HTML, CSS  and JS to get in the door but after that you pick up the advanced stuff as you go."
webdev,3e2mff,sdawson26,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:20:43 2015 UTC,"From my experience, I spent a lot of time during my first few years in the field learning everything I could.  It wasn't exactly required, but I was anxious to prove myself and genuinely enjoyed learning everything.  At the very least, it helped me get rid of the 'imposter syndrome' that everybody experiences.  After that point, however, I can't say that I've ever had to spend any of my free time learning new things.  That's not to say that I don't ever learn new things for fun, but it's never been required for any of my jobs.  I've never run into any issues that I couldn't look up during my full time job on the fly.  I think a lot of people (like me) will spend their free time learning new things because they enjoy it, and not because the field demands it.  For example, I devoted time to learning iOS development last year.  I've never used this knowledge in any of my jobs, but it was fun to learn something new and throw myself into an unfamiliar environment."
webdev,3e2mff,itsmoosey,1 point,Tue Jul 21 17:38:27 2015 UTC,"Here's my two cents: Web dev is a fun and rewarding career if you enjoy constantly tinkering and improving things.  During your first few years, you need to treat the career path like you're in college. Don't ever skip over the reading material or tutorials, because you'll just slow yourself down from not allowing yourself to learn best practices.  You can still have a work/life balance. The trick is that you can't get away with a 40-hour-a-week job in order to be successful as well. If you want to make a six-figure salary, you need to be passionate enough to call it a career AND a hobby for a while."

Sometimes you can see not just meta tags declaring it outright but source code with class names or other artifacts that gives away how it was made. The filename extensions are another clue and artifacts to look for include directory names for images/css/js, whether src or href attributes are full paths or not, whether static resources appear to live on the same server or not, what types of features the site has, what url patterns forms are submitted to, etc. With a little detective work you might be able to determine or guess pretty closely what tools were used to create it. The size of the company is a clue, too. A small company isn't likely to have a java application but they could have classic ASP or even coldfusion."

webdev,3e2jpo,sbhikes,3,Tue Jul 21 15:22:19 2015 UTC,"No, look at the HTML source. For example, a drupal site will have a lot of class names like views-view-grid or not-front or page-node. It will put css and other things into directories with paths like sites/default/themes/... or sites/all/modules/.... Joomla and Wordpress will have their own little patterns like that. Look at the HTML source of something like the NY Times. They have static resources being served from a lot of different domains. This, plus the fact that the NY Times is a large organization, indicates a level of complexity that you probably wouldn't be comfortable with. If it's just one guy running a small business and you look under the hood and see similar complexity you know he's using some kind of service like wix or squarespace or something.

webdev,3e33gf,rakakaki,3,Tue Jul 21 16:14:48 2015 UTC,"On the issue of price, I'm a little surprised to hear that that was a deal breaker: Jira for 10 users would run you 10 bucks a month for cloud hosting, and it's one of the more popular issue trackers out there.  I've almost always used Jira, so I'm a bit biased in presenting it as an option, but certainly other companies offer similar setups that I'd imagine are in the same ballpark.  But since you're okay with finding a project to work on, I don't know why you wouldn't use a relational database for this.  Your data is inherently relational, and the benefits you would get from switching over to a NoSQL database (particularly if you're sticking with PHP) seem ... well questionable at best.  You have fixed schemas, low scaling needs, and would strongly benefit from ACID protection.  Stick with a SQL database: MySQL is totally fine, and frankly would probably be preferable so that you can add your project to the large list of really standard LAMP stack applications out there.  Indeed, a quick comparison of issue trackers shows that they're almost exclusively powered by relational databases, and likely for a really obvious reason: a good issue tracker needs to be able to enforce strict structured user defined rules as well as provide you a flexible environment in which you can build pretty much any query you can conceive.  That's where relational databases shine.  While you could certainly write this into a NoSQL database if you wanted to, I don't understand what you'ld be getting out of it.  Really question your underlying assumption that your data storage and querying needs: I'm struggling to think of a scenario where this is a problem for your application."

That was something that was considered, but we weren't sure if it would be worth it."

Emphasizing quantity can take people out of a creative state that we need to solve problems the best way possible.  I think you should look at: ""Hack Days"" - drop everything you are doing and spend a day building something new, in a new tech stack.  Do a ""practice week"" if you are a product based company, and spend an entire sprint doing something different!  Beyond that, get away from coding -  foosball, ping pong, video games.
