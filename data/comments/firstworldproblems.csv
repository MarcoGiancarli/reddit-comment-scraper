It's a nice blue, now, but the water hasn't completely cleared up, yet. Draining is, unfortunately, not an option as they are on a well system and it is expensive to get a water tanker in."
firstworldproblems,3e1s2y,acerbius,6,Tue Jul 21 13:36:24 2015 UTC,"Background: I recently became responsible for a 40,000 gallon pool which had turned dark green and went through a lot of effort and education on how to get it crystal clear. The easiest path is hire a pool guy to get it fixed. Maintenance is not that hard once a pool is clean.   Focus on the filter first. This is 95% of the issue. Make sure you have enough D.E. and that after every time you backwash, you add more D.E. If you mix into a slurry before adding to the skimmer it will disperse better. Ensure you are getting enough flow. If the water isn't circulating, it's not getting clear. Backwash the filter and if that doesn't work, take the top off the filter and without taking apart the filter assembly, lift it out and hose it off. Be careful reassembling, ensuring it's on tight since 20-30 psi can be enough force to lift a car. Get your water tested at a local pool supply company like Leslie's. Their chemicals cost a bit more but the free testing is a godsend. Your standard pool test kit isn't going to test for phosphates. A report telling you how much of what chemical to use when is going to help a lot. Test the chlorine / ph daily. High ph and not enough chlorine  is going to set you up for failure. Don't use phosfree right after you've shocked the pool. Make sure you have enough chlorine tabs. Run the filter 24x7 until the pool is clear. If you don't have a pool cleaning robot, get one. Debris is going to use up your free chlorine."

The chemical version stays in the water no matter what, unless water is splashed out of the pool. Naturally generated chlorine dissipates with sunlight, thus the salt system runs on a daily schedule, to regenerate the lost chlorine during the day. I've swam on both versions, salt water system chlorine you cannot tell you have been swimming in chemicals for three hours and it doesn't smell like a rental hot tub place.  In my personal opinion/experience, 10+ years using pools of different size/shapes, salt water system is the ""PC Master Race"" of swimming pools."
firstworldproblems,3e1s2y,IS2SPICY4U,14,Tue Jul 21 15:24:24 2015 UTC,"What? No. All chlorine dissipates in sunlight. People without salt water chlorine generators add stabilizer to reduce the impact of sunlight because we aren't continuously generating more chlorine and unstabilized chlorine has a shockingly rapid half-life in the presence of sunlight.  Your chlorine is just as ""chemical"" as ours.  You dissolve sodium chloride and through electrolysis produce hypochlorous acid and sodium hypochlorite. I just add sodium hypochlorite from a jug of high quality bleach. Sodium hypochlorite is still sodium hypochlorite.  And adding cyanuric acid does not make our chlorine last forever ""unless water is splashed out of the pool"" It makes it last just a little bit longer than the half life of roughly half an hour in a pool with a pH of 7.5. Half an hour. Of course we want our chlorine to last longer than that! Even well maintained, I lose 2 or 3 ppm per day in the summer. Sometimes more with a lot of use and really sunny days.  You can prefer salt water generator systems all you want. But it isn't somehow ""less chemical."" You just aren't actively involved in the replenishment of those chemicals as much since your salt generator is doing it for you."

If not, air is much easier for electromagnetic waves to travel through than solids and the receivers/transmitters they have are much stronger and efficient than what we have. And what they have is probably optimized for a certain type of data that is being sent in a specific manner, whereas wifi needs to connect to several devices, needs to comply with certain frequency laws, has a limited power source as well as it mustn't take up a large volume and must be somewhat durable."
firstworldproblems,3dide6,chrisd93,25,Thu Jul 16 18:54:19 2015 UTC,"the biggest difference would probably frequency.  New Horizons sends at a very low frequency, which can reach very long distances (you can send a signal to the other side of the world, with just a few mW, when the weather is right).  Wifi on the other hand uses frequencies in the GHz range. It results in higher bandwith, but lower tolerance for blocking objects and distance. NH has a very very low bandwidth. One of the reasons it takes so long for all the data it gathered to reach us."
firstworldproblems,3dide6,SkaveRat,4,Thu Jul 16 19:14:47 2015 UTC,"Baud rate is even more important in this case. It will take the next 16 months to transmit all the data from the flyby. It's much easier to pick out weak signals from the background when each symbol has a longer time duration. So they are transmitting at only 1kbps to make detection easier.   They are actually transmitting the data in the X band at 8-12GHz, which is pretty high frequency and much higher than most things in existence today use."

NASA's Deep Space Network consists of radiotelescope installations in the US, Spain, and Australia.   The atmosphere is relatively transparent to radio waves (and one presumes frequencies that don't penetrate the atmosphere are avoided), so there isn't much advantage to a satellite radiotelescope, and there's no comparing the cost-effectiveness of ground-based to space-based radio astronomy. All of the space telescopes are designed for observations at frequencies that are either significantly attenuated by the atmosphere, or (in the case of optical telescopes like the Hubble) affected by ""twinkle."""

Average density for air is 5×1019 atoms/cm³ (give or take).

The New Horizons signal strength was about 2.5 to 3.0 x 10-22 W when I checked it yesterday. It's not in view of the DSN as I'm posting, but it's expected that we'll be able to communicate with the probe into the 2030's (source), so I'm guessing a sofa won't diminish the signal as much as another 15 - 20 years of moving at bat-out-of-hell speeds away from us.  EDIT: A spa ce."
firstworldproblems,3dide6,elvendude,2,Thu Jul 16 22:54:56 2015 UTC,"We'd almost certainly not. This is right out of my ass, but I'm assuming that it communicates on a very carefully calculated tight beam transmission (possibly laser?) that is directed straight to the receiver at NASA. It would take a lot more power to do a general transmission.  Edit: I just re-read the post I replied to. It says ""right behind New Horizons"". So, we have two questions here: distance and mode of transmission. If we're using radio waves, probably doesn't matter, as that would go right through a couch. If we're using something else, like X-ray or laser, then it matters a whole lot. Essentially it becomes a question of ""how much of the beam does the couch intercept? Does enough of the beam miss the couch to get to Earth and be decoded?"""

It would take a lot more power to do a general transmission.   You don't have to guess how it communicates with Earth. It uses X-band radio with an antenna pretty similar to a big satellite antenna. There's not much of an advantage to a laser at these distances; at 0.5 degrees of dispersion over 4 billion miles, the laser beam would have a radius of 25 million miles. Admittedly, that would make it relatively easy to make sure the beam hits the Earth!"
firstworldproblems,3dide6,Bawlsinhand,1 point,Thu Jul 16 23:04:38 2015 UTC,"Except the intensity of light follows the inverse square law so even though photons might make it to earth you'd have a really hard time finding the one or two photons that were from NH. There's a really good YT video describing the process of bouncing a laser off the reflector on the moon, the number of photons coming back can be counted on your fingers."
firstworldproblems,3dide6,physicsteach,1 point,Fri Jul 17 03:36:19 2015 UTC,"The inverse-square law only applies to a non-directional source. The New Horizons probe uses very directional antennae to get as much of the signal to Earth as possible. Still, at 2.5 x 10-22 kW, an 8 GHz signal means n = E/(hf) ~ 47000 photos per second are collected by the receivers, unless I screwed up the arithmetic somewhere.   NASA reports that New Horizons is communicating at 8.44 GHz, with the signal strength varying from 2.56 to 2.86 x 10-22 kW at the Canberra station. So my numbers aren't completely bogus. Note that if you check my source, New Horizons isn't visible to the DSN all the time, and it won't be shown if the DSN can't see it."
firstworldproblems,3dide6,sportcardinal,3,Sun Jul 19 14:25:57 2015 UTC,"I don't think this is correct. The signal is no directed at exactly a point. The signal expands as it travels. The receivers on Earth can capture the signal and slowly decipher the message. But it's not like, we have pinpoint accuracy.  I would think of sort of a radio transmission. You can pick the signal up from many places in a city, even if the signal is coming from one specific source."
firstworldproblems,3dide6,elvendude,3,Thu Jul 16 17:27:47 2015 UTC,"Right, but think of the distances involved. A radio transmission from Pluto that hits a certain city on Earth is a pretty damn tight beam. Might be just a difference of definition on ""tight"".  I will admit, if it's ""hits a city"" level of tight, a couch sized object would probably not be a problem. If it's ""hit NASA"" tight, then it probably would."

Basically a L-shaped metal plate once again at about 1/4 wavelength around antenna, it turns the omnidirectional antenna into a bit directional Use software like Heatmapper and inSSIDer to check where the black spots are and what channels are in use. Try dropping your router to B/G only if you're using N speeds. I use 2.4GHz and have forced maximum of 11 Mbit. Not all routers can do this. 2.4 GHz will be killed by your microwave, wireless camcorders and whatever there is on the 2.4 GHz ISM band. Try using 5.2 GHz if you can (again, see your router).

With today's technologies like ultra-bright LEDs a modern DLP 4KTV would be a no-brainer, viewing angles and daytime contrast wouldn't be quite as good as IPS or OLED but they could probably sell 100""+ DLP sets for the cost of a 60"" LCD."

Please read this and get a better understanding of your Internet http://www.bredbandpriser.dk/en/broadband-mb-mbit/  Wireless N but not G is fine for your connection up to around 300megabits  Example if someone has  2 mega bits per second on speed test then it's    2 million bits per second, maximum, depending on your line quality, so it could be less. How much of that is used depends on your PC and the servers across the internet.  divide by 8 to get bytes, so 2,000,000 / 8 = 250,000 bytes per second, divide by 1000 for k (1024 realy) ,  so maximum download speed on a 2mbit line is 244kbps a second.

It's over extending the actual steak itself in mutliple places, as well as the fact that the steak is literally just placed over the side table. If it was an actual real steak in the picture, it wouldn't be so flat considering part of it should already have hit the side table thus it would be pressing against the side table...but it's not. It's perfectly flat even when on the corner. The steam/smoke which is obviously fake(coloring is off and no smoke is that concentrated). On top of that the grill isn't even on. Steak isn't actually touching the grill which it would be if it was real, even with it hanging off like that. Plus going off the width of the steak hanging off the side there is no way that steak would actual fit on the grill width wise.
