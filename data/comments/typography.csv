typography,3dqzyl,andreaslarsen,7,Sat Jul 18 16:49:35 2015 UTC,"I enjoyed reading this. I thought I might give my feedback, not as a typographer but as someone who has obsessively tested several hundred monospace fonts in various terms and editors in a tireless hunt for that elusive ""perfect coding font"".  I completely agree with your top priority. Legibility and unambiguity are paramount. Normally I use this shell function to discern at a glance whether the font is likely to cause any issues on this front.  The second one- I'm actually not a fan of condensed fonts. Your principle is sound, but personally I'm a fan of a nice medium-width. It just seems like a condensed fonts are a bit tiring to read, and it throws off my judgement of line length- not a super huge deal because I can always check the column in vim's statusline, but it's still nice to have an intuitive feel for it, if that makes any sense.  And that brings me to prettiness: Monoid looks great. The only complaint I have is the narrow width, which I have already issued and which I'm sure many others would not consider a valid complaint.  Another thing I wanted to mention: yes, there are a lot of coder Outline fonts available, but I don't think there are many Bitmap ones out there- at least not high-caliber ones, aside from the Terminus, Gohu, and Proggy families. I'll suppress the urge to rant about the limited console fonts available in Debian or how much slower Xft fonts are in urxvt, but I would love to see a bitmap version of Monoid.  Anyway, keep up the good work."
typography,3dqzyl,dbbo,3,Sat Jul 18 23:06:08 2015 UTC,"I too have the issue with the narrowness, but other than that the font is beautiful.  Also re: urxvt, unless you have a bunch of urxvt scripts that you're loathe to lose, you should check out st. I switched to it (with tmux, which I'd been using in urxvt) and have never been happier with my console setup. It's been significantly faster in my experience."
typography,3dqzyl,emallson,3,Sun Jul 19 01:04:13 2015 UTC,Thanks for the suggestion. I looked over the readme and now I'm about to clone and compile (although I'm scared I'll love it and then sink hours and hours into configuration.)
typography,3dqzyl,dbbo,3,Sun Jul 19 01:19:49 2015 UTC,Thanks for the thorough feedback:)  @ Unambiguity + shell function: My next article will be about this (you can see the video where I go in detail about this already) @ Condensed: I went for a fairly loose tracking and chose to condense the letters slightly to keep line-lenght down. It's a personal preference probably also influenced by what languages I code in. In e.g. Swift the lines can get fairly long. I'll go more into detail @Bitmap: Would be cool - I haven't really experimented with creating bitmap fonts but it should be a fairly quick job since monoid is sticking so much to the grid already. Feel free to look into it;)    PS: Raise these requests/suggestions as GitHub issues so I don't forget and so that I/others might take look into it one day.
typography,3dqzyl,illepic,2,Sun Jul 19 04:49:32 2015 UTC,Which font did you settle on? I'm highly interested!
typography,3dqzyl,dbbo,2,Sun Jul 19 05:44:00 2015 UTC,"Recently I've been using Fantasque in gvim and Gohu in urxvt, and of course terminus in the linux console (haven't really experiment much with that because terminus is more that good enough considering how little time I spend outside X).  Having said that- and I know I'm probably going to get crucified for this- if I had to use one for the rest of my life I'd pick DejaVu. Now, in my own defense:    It's packaged and readily available for (if not included with) virtually every *nix imaginable, meaning zero fiddling with fc-cache, mkfontdir, your X11 config, and other baggage that you sometimes find yourself stuck with. It's legible with little ambiguity, even on urxvt (which has admittedly crappy Xft support) at smaller sizes (also, this screenshot is on vanilla Debian stretch as I haven't gotten around to patching freetype or cairo on this install yet): http://i.imgur.com/Ql1dzqO.png It may not be breathtakingly beautiful, but you can bet it will at least look decent in any application with any hintstyle at (almost) any size. With the right tweaks, I think it actually looks pretty good. Apparently Apple did too since they used it as the basis for Menlo. Edit: forgot to mention UTF-8 coverage. You'd be hard pressed to find a special character unsupported by DejaVu that you actually need on a regular basis.   I guess my point is that it's just consistently reliable. It seems like many others don't have that. Maybe the bold weight appears uneven unless you turn the hinting down, or maybe it's only readable at one or two sizes, or maybe it looks great in your editor but terrible in your term. A lot of these problems aren't the typeface designer's fault (also going to suppress another rant about how X's font support is permanently stuck in 1997), but they are problems nonetheless and DejaVu seems to avoid them for the most part.  I can't list every mono I've fairly tested, but here are the families I currently have installed on this particular laptop which will hopefully give some indication (I need to delete 95% of these):  https://gist.github.com/dbb/5329c554654f0718697c#file-fc-list  https://gist.github.com/dbb/5329c554654f0718697c#file-fonts"
