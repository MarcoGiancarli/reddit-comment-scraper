Paleontology,3e2vz0,DinoDork54,16,Tue Jul 21 15:20:58 2015 UTC,"A paleontologist is a scientist who studies ancient life.   Do you have to have an advanced degree to call yourself a scientist?  There are many, many amateur paleontologists ranging from weekend hobbyists to devoted volunteers. Some amateurs do publish (usually in conjunction with professionals) in peer-reviewed journals. Some have made important discoveries. For most, paleontology is not their day job--they're retail clerks, firefighters, retirees, doctors, fast-food workers, students, et cetera who like to devote their free time to fossil prospecting or helping in a prep-lab.  A professional paleontologist is someone who has made the science their career. These folks are usually going to have, out of necessity, advanced degrees. Respect is earned through your research. Prove yourself to be a careful and ingenious researcher and you gain the respect of your peers. I've known professional paleontologists with faculty positions who are not well-respected in the field, and amateurs who professionals consult with because of their dedication to the science.  There are some folks who fall into a sort of blurry area. Folks who collect and sell fossils may call themselves a ""paleontologist,"" but I'd argue they've made the commercial their career, not the science. (And when it comes to selling vertebrate fossils, most ""professional paleontologists"" see that as a moral no-no).   What does a paleontologist need to know the most about? That depends on what they're studying. Fossils and fossilization, biology, anatomy, evolution, ecology, sedimentation, geology, statistics--those will be largely common across all paleontologists. Someone studying the phylogenetics of trilobites is going to need a different skillset than someone studying the physics of sediment deformation if dinosaur footprints, or paleoclimate of a region via ostracodes, or the ontogenetic morphometerics of antelope horns, or the relative abundances of different species of seed-ferns in a fluvial formation, though there will be overlap."
Paleontology,3e2vz0,Dashukta,2,Tue Jul 21 16:33:24 2015 UTC,"I think you have to have a degree/equivalency and experience to be considered a paleontologist. Just like you need a degree and a job to be considered a medical doctor. If you're a self-educated fossil hunter, then you can certainly be an amateur paleontologist, but I feel that years of formal education are a  prerequisite."
Paleontology,3e2vz0,sassybluewhale,-4,Tue Jul 21 16:35:59 2015 UTC,"And when you get the formal education, the field experience, and also go commercial, you become a Fossil Pirate, and everyone hates you. Well, except for the museums around the world who all need articulated specimen, and kids. So, I guess only the professors hate you. Fair trade, since most professors are dicks."
Paleontology,3e0fs6,Blackcassowary,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:21:18 2015 UTC,"I may be misremembering things, but didn't atmospheric oxygen rise closer to modern levels during Middle Jurassic? Since mammals lack the efficient air sac lungs of ornithodirans, maybe this increase in oxygen could have enabled mammals to become larger and more active, kickstarting the evolution of greater mammalian diversity?"
Paleontology,3e0ajl,vannah08510,3,Mon Jul 20 23:38:23 2015 UTC,"You're graduating in the Spring and you're just now looking into grad school? Be sure to keep an eye on application deadlines, many of them are about 6 months (or more) ahead of your desired start date. Go talk with your professors and your advisers. Get their input. You have a geology department at your school, go over there. Talk to Dr. Dennis Kolata, looks like he's adjunct from the ISGS, but he does work in stratigraphy and paleo.  Grad school is different from undergrad. For one, your GPA is of lesser importance. 3.4-3.5 is fine, but your GRE scores can make or break you. You'll also need letters of recommendation to get in, preferably from professors who know you and your skills.  In grad school, you are not only applying to a particular university, you're applying to work with a particular person. The subject is determined by the department. Most paleontologists/paleobiologists are in Geology/Geoscience departments, with a handful in Biology. You could get accepted to the graduate college, but if there's no one in the department to take you on, you won't be going. Look around at who's doing the type of research you want to be involved in. Talk with them. Make yourself known. Show them who you are, so that when you go to apply they 1) know you're applying and 2) already want to take you on.   I would strongly advise a Master's first. A Master's teaches you the skills and habits necessary to pursue a PhD. I have known people to skip the Master's, but I've never seen a situation where getting the Master's first wasn't a benefit. Most of the time, the extra work meant the PhD took extra time to the point they could have done a separate M.S. anyway. Especially since you're coming into the field with a strong Bio and Biochem background, you'll have some leveling work to do to excel in paleo (e.g. geology, stratigraphy)."
Paleontology,3e0ajl,Dashukta,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:57:51 2015 UTC,"Seconding getting a Master's first. The job market for new PhDs in paleontology is dreadful, it's not uncommon to do 3 or more Postdoc positions before landing a tenure track position. That's if you're lucky most new PhDs end up as adjuncts. A masters will give you more time to gain experience that will be vital in getting work after graduating. Since you have a biology background, if you want to go into academia I would recommend trying to TA for Anatomy in graduate school. Many vertebrate paleontologists work as anatomy instructors at medical colleges.  You may also decide that academia is not worth the headache and decide on a terminal Master's. There are probably many more jobs available per qualified applicant at museums hiring Masters-level positions than at the PhD/Curator level."

Paleontology,3cinfe,sassybluewhale,1 point,Wed Jul 8 05:25:08 2015 UTC,Well the problem with geological sciences is that it has no biology subjects at all (and I don't get many electives).

They can really help you to make sure you're taking the right classes and keep you on track for your degree.

Ask to volunteer in their lab. Honestly, letters of recommendation and research experience are more valuable than grades."
Paleontology,3cinfe,abbethesieyes,2,Wed Jul 8 07:11:33 2015 UTC,"I'd do geology (or geological sciences).  In most paleo programs, half the people have strong bio backgrounds and half the people have strong geoscience backgrounds.  Most people don't have any problem picking up the other in grad school.  Unless you want to do something that requires major biology knowledge (ancient DNA, functional morphology of Miocene apes, etc), you'll be fine learning the biological context later on.  Even great systematists and morphologists can come from geology backgrounds.  Also keep in mind that there are lots of field schools where you can learn the biology.  Having a working knowledge of stratigraphy may even let you attend those field schools free as a field assistant.    Now for the practical advice, which you are 100% free to ignore: Job prospects in paleontology are bleak.  Take it from someone applying to them with an undergraduate biology background, I envy those people with geoscience degrees.  There are a lot of practical jobs for those with degrees in geology (especially in Australia, where I hear you can get paid ridiculous amounts of money to work in mining).  You don't want to do those things now, I get it, and you may not ever have to do those things.  But having fallbacks are nice. Not having to take whatever terribly underpaid teaching job you can find is nice. Being able to provide for the hypothetical family you may want to have someday is nice.  Your priorities in life may change (maybe not), and it is nice to have flexibility to be able to adapt."

Different units will have different requirements. For example Monash requires all honour /postgrads to undertake a 3rd yr unit of sedimentolgy, volcanology and structural geology. That included those wanting to do paleontology. Long story short it didn't matter so much as long as your score is high and you can prove to your supervisor that you have a solid understanding.   My advice would be to do as much biology as you can but pick up geology units your strong in /interested in to get the best mark possible so you have a better chance of postgraduate and honours acceptance.

Paleontology,3c3jve,ephebic,3,Sat Jul 4 22:28:55 2015 UTC,"Degree in Vertebrate Paleontology, with several friends in the field, here.  For High School, you're on the right track. Lots of science and math--but don't skimp on other subjects (especially literature, history, extra curriculars, etc.).  If you can find some volunteer opportunities, definitely take advantage of them. Check with local museums and universities. Some may have dig sites they're working on, or need help in the prep labs. Universities sometimes have ""summer internships"" like the Clark Scholars program, which look good on a college/grad school application.  When you get to college, don't bother with the ""paleontology-focused"" schools. Go where you want and where you can afford. Major in either Biology or Geoscience, and take a minor in the other. Don't forget to take statistics classes. Most paleontologists are in the Geosciences department, so spend a lot of time there talking to professors and grad students. Show promise, be bold, and look into undergraduate research programs. Start visiting professional meetings (GSA for invert paleo, SVP for vert paleo) and schmoozing. Introduce yourself to people, talk to them about grad school. Getting your name in their head at this stage will help you later.  Graduate school is where you'll be neck-deep in paleo. This is where you'll really want to put thought and effort in to where you want to go. Look at who's doing the sort of research you want to be involved in. By this time, you should have a more solid idea of what aspect of paleo you want to focus on, or at least the clade. Do a Master's degree first--it will help you learn the skills and discipline necessary to pull off a PhD.  Remember there is more to paleontology than just dinosaurs (you haven't said dinosaurs, but from years of personal experience, I've found that the vast majority of aspiring paleontologists want to work on dinosaurs, so I'm making an assumption). I know successful paleontologists who made their entire career out of studying fossil corals, others who work on conodonts, crocodiles, turtles, plants. Still others who focus on extinct ecosystems and climate instead of directly on the organisms.   Success in paleontology, and really any science, takes dedication. A life of publish-or-perish research in the cut-throat world of academia is not for everyone. Realize that there are more job openings for state governor than for vertebrate paleontologists. To succeed, you have to make a name for yourself; you have to distinguish yourself; you have to be very, very good. If you are not dedicated to the field and dedicated to your research, you won't make it."

It looks like, whoever did the work, didn't do as good a job of mixing the binder and dust to replicate the rock.  Examine it closely under 20x or 30x magnification, and stick a hot needle into those areas and see if it gives off a plastic smell- if it does, it is an especially poor job as there are other binders that are non-organic and wouldn't smell. That's why you should view it under magnification.  I would assume that this piece is selling for a significant amount of money, so the seller shouldn't mind if you performed some non-destructive tests.   edit: it's kind of difficult to determine in the photographs, but some of those areas look like they have bubbles in them which is a clear indicator of some kind of glue, and the lighter areas, especially along the spines, look like restorations.

Paleontology,3c0a40,ItsStupendousMan,2,Fri Jul 3 16:29:28 2015 UTC,"Graphing is one. Paleontologists have to graph their finds as they find them for their records, and to tell what position the fossils are in and how extensive the sight is. You also will need to learn measurements of size and weight, as /u/sassybluewhale said. It helps you to learn how big/how old a dinosaur or fossilized animal was. Not to mention the distance between the bones can give clues about how it died and how long scavengers were able to get to it before it was covered and fossilized. I'm sure there's many other reasons, but those are just some I thought of."

Finite-element analysis is being used right now for everything from investigating the stresses and strains on Tyrannosaurus skulls during feeding to showing how Velociraptor claws were not-so-great at disemboweling strikes, to how sediment deforms when critter steps in it.  Phylogenetics is a massive part of paleo, and it is nothing but applied math and statistics, mixed with a heavy reliance on knowledge of evolution and anatomy."

Much of the rest of the brain is used for things like maneuvering the body in 3D, handling sensory input, etc. The thing is, no dinosaurs have a cerebral volume on the same scale as modern birds, e.g.:  http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v501/n7465/full/nature12424.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20130905  So, nonavian maniraptors, like Velociraptor, would have lacked some of that cognitive processing power necessary to be particularly ""smart.""

With a small stretch of the imagination, you could imagine them being as smart as, say, a macaw, which is pretty intelligent. About as smart as a two year old child. Modern birds can solve problems and recognize patterns, so for the sake of the movie, we can make a small leap and say that with a few million years of evolution, they got pretty smart, smarter than we knew with only bones to go off of."

Introducing extinct animals into an ecosystem that previously supported them is one thing - that's not too much of a step beyond modern reintroduction programs in my opinion.  This is so much more than that though. This is introducing genes into modern animals which allow them to survive in new ecosystems. The effect they could have is totally unpredictable and could end up endangering more species than they save. This effect would be even more pronounced in such an ecologically important species as the Asian elephant. In the article Beth Shapiro even acknowledges these dangers and dismisses them!  This species-first view of conservation really frightens me sometimes. If we fail to protect ecosystems as a whole - right down to the small and plain species - we'll cripple them and ultimately still fail to conserve the big, sexy animals like the elephants here.

Also, they would need to find an ecological niche that wasn't occupied by something better evolved. If anything survived, it'd probably be something small, like a Procompsognathus"

Paleontology,39to3t,dangerousdave2244,2,Mon Jun 15 16:03:51 2015 UTC,"If you haven't seen the most recent movie, and don't want it spoiled, stop reading now. But every Jurassic Park/ Jurassic World dinosaur is spliced with modern animals to some extent, and gene modified to some other unknown extent. The recent movie even suggested that this is why many of the animals look much different than current scientific projections of what the animals would look like. Raptors, for example, being larger and less-feathery than we might think. It's possible, likely, almost certain even, that Ingen, wanting not to invest in something that costs millions of dollars but can be killed by something as simple as low oxygen content and disease, have gene-treated these animals to be able to survive both situations. Of course the disease thing is a little bit trickier. Could be why one of the triceratops in the original movie was so sick. One or two fatalities is still bound to happen, but they probably take some measures to insure that the animals have an immune system capable of keeping them on their feet. Would they become an invasive species? I think a few of them would. The Mosasaur in the new movie is ridiculously huge. Like many times what I would expect from that animal. It seems like its own size would kill it. I know animals in the water can get bigger, but even a blue whale would be a few times smaller than that thing. But assuming that it is able to support its own weight, continue to pump blood, etc, it would need to eat large pray nearly constantly in order to keep up with the energy consumption of such a large body. I don't think our oceans are abundant enough, especially considering that speed is one of the reasons sharks outlasted mosasaurs in the first place if I'm not mistaken. But even saying that she does survive without being hand fed constantly, then what? There's only one that we know of, it dies off. Same goes for the Indominus. Same goes for the T. Rex. Of those that can possibly reproduce, many are too large and reproduce too slowly for their population to get out of control, assuming that they could make it off of the island in the first place. So I don't think you'd see sauropods or other large herbivores uprooting any native populations anywhere. You're right though, as you get smaller, chances of success grow. Raptors, especially as seen in these movies, would be particularly scary if they had a foothold on any mainland. But a lot of the problems of dealing with them in the movies have to do with being under-prepared. It's not as if they're going to be pose too much of a threat to properly armed forces. And it's not like Kudzu or stink bugs, wherein whatever you kill is replaced within a few days or weeks, these things still have a comparatively long life cycle, and whatever you kill will take years to replace. I think the best chance goes to the pterosaurs, although not really dinosaurs. Notably because they're distance fliers, and could end up anywhere, and would be difficult to track. Although that would probably ultimately lead to their downfall as well. Even if you continue to count the number of these animals that were killed or recaptured in the movie immediately following their release, the original number of these animals isn't sustainable. If they all disperse, their numbers won't be great enough for a next generation to be all that likely. Especially because of their likely solitary natures, and likely complicated breeding habits. It's suggested that they return to the same places year after year to challenge one another to mate, but these locations are unestablished, and these animals would probably die out after the first generation. Yet smaller animals would have a better chance, especially if they aren't too much of a nuisance to whatever human population they end up near. If they manage to end up in the Amazon, smaller predators like compsognathus could potentially be dangerous and hard to keep in check. Although speaking of the pterosaurs being difficult to track, that's actually not true of any of these animals, because they all have tracking implants. No matter where any of these animals end up in the wild, they could be half way across the world, even the shortest reproduction cycle isn't enough for ingen people to show up in their helicopters and take out all the would-be dino-parents. Although since one of the major metaphors of these movies is overconfidence in ourselves and our own technology, and mastery of the natural world. Something something, the trackers don't work, and the rainforest is filling up with swarms of turkey sized dinos."
Paleontology,39to3t,kentonj,2,Mon Jun 15 15:52:25 2015 UTC,"Thanks for this thought out analysis. Yes, the Dinos must have some genetic modifications to allow them to survive at all on today's Earth, but the first 2 books do talk about them getting sick and a lot of other unforeseen issues with them surviving, mostly the larger animals.   The books also talk about a population  of small dinos possibly living in the mainland Costa Rican jungle, because life finds a way. The jungle is definitely the place where a small dinosaur could survive. Youre totally right. I think we're in agreement on most points.   But, a pack of (movie sized) Velociraptors could wreak havoc, but not for long, there's not enough prey for them, since they are bigger than any pack of wolves and have much higher metabolism  And yeah, there's no way that Mosasaur would last long at that size, especially with our oceans nearly depleted of most of its large prey, like whales, large sharks, and large fish, which have been decimated by the whaling and fishing industries"
Paleontology,39to3t,dangerousdave2244,2,Mon Jun 15 16:11:03 2015 UTC,"Having read the books Grant finds that the Triceratops is ill particularly because of eating a berry. Also, in the end it is mentioned that the raptors and some other dinosaurs migrate to the mainland Costa Rico systematically by hiding on ferries. The compys also hide aboard the ferries and are initially shown to attack infants.   The point here being, once the dinos get off the island, they have to fend for themselves and manage too (hints have been constantly given that they're able to replicate). In this scenario, as they're spliced with modern day amphibians, reptiles, they would possess metabolic capacities to sustain themselves. For eg. Surplus hunting and raptor social hierarchy adopted by the raptors have always been one of the key features of the movies.  Thus, even though, these dinosaurs have tracking implants in the first generations, they keep breeding and without an appropriate system to check, they're populations are going to explode.  Which is mentioned in the first book, when Malcolm points out that the dino population shown a smooth Gaussian curve rather than a ridged curve implying controlled introductions into the wild. Finally, once the species start mingling, it has been assumed by Malcolm/Grant that Jurassic Equilibrium would be reached."
Paleontology,39to3t,fatboy93,1 point,Fri Jun 19 17:00:47 2015 UTC,"not sure I buy the unfamiliar diseases argument.  That really only plays out if you pull an already developed animal from one environment and drop it suddenly into another.  (i.e. dropping a spaniard in central America where the natives have no immunities).  In the case of the JP/JW dinos, they were genetically engineered in a lab yes but immediately upon hatching they began developing antibodies to the world around them.  This means that even though it is a scientific creation, the animal itself is born into and develops immunities to the modern world's ecosystems."

Paleontology,39to3t,islamicporkchop,2,Mon Jun 15 10:09:13 2015 UTC,"That is because of the ambiguous amphibian/reptilian DNA.

Heck even Clown Fish have shown to undergo hormonal changes that makes a grown male fish to develop into a female fish, if mature females are not around and the brood is dying."

Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,9,Sat Jun 13 12:58:38 2015 UTC,"Aside from all the obvious inaccuracies that are as old as the franchise, one scene that thoroughly bothered me was when Indominus was 'speaking' with the Velocraptors.  The first gripe is that they should not be able to communicate at all. Sure simple sounds like growls could be conveyed vaugely through species as 'threat' or 'fear', but it was obviously intended that they were communicating as if the sounds were words. They do NOT have the capacity for any sort of language, either of them.  That was minor compared to the idea that if we grant that they are capable of language in this world, how would they be speaking the same language? Indominus was raised in isolation, it never heard another dinosaur 'speak', didn't learn social skills (to reference an earlier point in the movie) and attacked everything on sight. Language is learnt from observing patterns in sound from others of the same species that already know it. Indominus had no other dinosaur to learn this language from. The velociraptors could have made a language up betweeen each-other, and even if Indominus is made partly from the same DNA as them there's no reason he would know their language. If a human who'd been raised in complete isolation from other humans met another human they would not be able to communicate. The writers have mixed up learnt behaviour with innate. It's stupid, alright.  /rant"
Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,2,Sun Jun 14 04:35:17 2015 UTC,"This was just so jarring. Could the writers not make up their mind about the I. rex?

Then they decided to ignore that for the ""talking dino"" scene. Then pick it back up again when the raptors flip sides back to Owen.

Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,4,Sun Jun 14 04:59:15 2015 UTC,"Ok, let's talk about shitty characters. Easy one first, the brothers. Their character development is that they pay more attention to each other at the end of the movie than earlier. Simple and boring. They really could have not been in the movie at all, contributing nothing interesting to the plot and only served to further Claire's ""character development."" The divorce had no place in the movie, and actually detracted from it. It's as if the writer didn't feel that A WEEK OF VIP ACCESS AT A FUCKING BITCHIN THEME PARK or maybe TRYING NOT TO DIE would effect the characters emotionally enough for them to bond.  Before I gripe about the BS they pulled on Claire's character, let's talk about facts. She has a very important career position, basically oversees the entire park and all it's problems. It is shown in the movie that she deals with guest problems like heat stroke and lost children on a daily basis. In performing her daily job duties, she traverses the park's pavement, gravel, and grass.  So why is she wearing high heels the entire movie? Even before the action starts, it's completely impractical for someone with her job. Even after another character comments on them being stupid, she still has them. It's just really messed up. It's just as distracting as if Owen was wearing one of those novelty umbrella-hats the whole movie.  The even deeper thing that made me really uneasy was that this career woman, who has an very important job that she is good at, and is trusted to make important billion-dollar decisions all the time, can't even be trusted by her own sister (or the script writers) that she wants to be child-free. If you aren't aware, folks who choose to be child free get flak all the time from family members, doctors, and complete strangers about this, and yes me too. It is truly rage inducing and completely inappropriate every time. The line when Claire and her sister are talking, and sis says ""When you have kids..."" and Claire responds ""IF I have kids"" has happened to me literally dozens of times. As someone whose struggle with other people trying to tell me how wrong I am has reached a climax in the past couple weeks for various reasons, it was just really shitty timing that it was a focus of this movie I was so looking forward to. Really touched a sore spot.  Basically the only character development aside from the brothers' was Claire going from ""important and skilled professional who can't be bothered to remember even an approximation of her nephew's ages"" to ""wibbling mommy wannabe, whose entire lesson she took away from the ordeal on the island is that she wants Owen's babies inside of her""  Pretty disappointed that what could have a been a really badass character was reduced to high heels and babies. The movie poster in particular with her on one side and I. rex on the other had me excited for cool plot stuff, like from the first movie with Malcolm in black and Hammond in white.   Bloxxsaur covered the animal behavior strangeness to a T, same for In_Medias_Res talking about... pretty much everything.  Oh and finally, while the gyrosphere concept is really great, how on earth are they supposed to stay clean? They are rolling around on dirt and dung all day, would take a mystical force field to keep that clean after five feet. Maybe if they stayed on an elevated track it'd work, like a futuristic glass-bottomed boat.  COOL STUFF THAT MADE ME GIDDY   The camouflage idea from book 2 and the arcade games was utilized, though poorly. Called it! But did the I. rex make itself white to match one of the only other creatures it saw often (Claire), in an attempt to fit in to a social group? That is a really cool thought! In the old arcade shooter games, there are points where a big bad carnivore has it's gaping mouth coming straight at you and you have to shoot it just right to avoid taking damage. There is a shot involving the ACU dudes and I. rex that reminded me of this. Probably not intentional, but was fun to see anyway. Outdated alpha/beta theory aside, it was neat to see a movie attempt to portray complex animal behavior. Control room guy being the voice of Ian Malcolm, dropping the line about chaos. He had Malcolm's book on his desk too :)"
Paleontology,39ovyz,In_Medias_Res,8,Mon Jun 15 21:49:58 2015 UTC,"Oh boy, we're gonna be here a while. After I saw Jurassic World, I summed up my thoughts on the movie with a gif from the original movie. Make no mistake, I'm a serious Jurassic Park fan and was very excited for this movie, but roughly halfway through I began to realize that it was just a dumb action movie.  SPOILERS AHEAD  Plot  This movie is so formulaically different from any other Jurassic Park title, it might as well be The Fast and the Furious. Every other Jurassic Park movie has the classic ""ooh, aah"" wonder of seeing dinosaurs right there in front of you in act one, followed by a sudden & total breakdown resulting in a loss of control over the situation that begins the second act, which itself is followed by an attempt to reach a point on the island where the characters can call for help or otherwise escape. Basically: wonder, collapse, survival.  Jurassic World did none of these things well. The wonder of seeing living, breathing dinosaurs was immediately offset because that's how the movie opens, with eggs hatching and everyone getting a good look at the dinosaurs. There's no build-up, it's just there. Then they even go on to say that the public is no longer interested in seeing just regular dinosaurs anymore (in 2014 people paid $126.5 million for Walking with Dinosaurs, so it's safe to say this isn't a commentary on CGI so much as it is an in-universe plot point). Everything that once made Jurassic Park beautiful is reduced to a theme park attraction, from Velociraptor being an almost-tamed beast of war to T. rex being brought up a total of once before the climax, and even then it's as something only kids are dying to see.  As for the breakdown, it might as well have not happened. In theory, it would have begun with the escape of the Indominus and everything would have fallen apart in the span of a few minutes. Instead, the I. rex escapes, ambushes a team of park staff trying to recapture it, attacks the kids, destroys the original visitor's centre, and then breaches the aviary, at which point all this starts to become a serious problem. Meanwhile, the park gets shut down so slowly, you'd think the producers had never been to an amusement park before (seriously, when they shut down the rides, there's no leniency). Instead, it's varying degrees of ""let's try to do this without people finding out/hurting the dinosaur/spending too much money"". Then, despite the fact that the collapse is slow and doesn't really fit the niche the other films would put it in, you have the problem of sheer progression to it. This entire film is pretty disjointed; events rarely lead to other events, it's just set piece after set piece.  Finally, we come to the survival stage of the film, where obviously the two kids are going to have to make their way back to the main park after enduring several encounters with the dinosaurs... or one encounter which strands them and then never again. Heck, by the time they reach the main park, the guards at the gate don't even realize the collapse has begun. After the pterosaurs escape the aviary, the kids stick with Claire and Owen, even though it's pretty clear there's a shelter or something nearby where literally everyone who is not them, staff, or eaten has gone. Worse yet, they take them to the raptors, where they then release said raptors. From the get-go, this movie is just taking the characters and putting them in situations with no real reason for them to be in each situation, and the best example of that is the part I just mentioned with the raptors. Finally, the end confrontation really begins with the raptors being sent out to fight the I. rex, at which point the real collapse happens, because to Hell with homages and basic sense, why not add in another useless ten angles to the story? After the series of various ridiculous events which follows, the gang gets safely off the island and... that's it. ""We'll stick together... for survival."" Fade to white. No post-credit scene. Might as well been a big, clawed middle finger to everyone expecting anything more than a two-hour monster mash from this movie.  Theme  Anybody familiar with Jurassic Park can tell you that there are three major themes in the series: nature cannot be controlled, creating things for the sake of creation ends terribly, and life will find a way (to survive). Jurassic World touched on all these themes, then tossed them out the window for the sake of dinosaur-on-dinosaur combat.  Owen makes the statement quite a few times about the Velociraptors being animals, and that they can be taught, not tamed. All well and good until the end, when they side with him against ""one of their own"", and then ignore him & the other Humans out of respect after fighting off the I. rex. Could be justified, but then the T. rex does the exact same thing in the final battle. They take the theme of 'nature cannot be controlled' and they add on 'unless you're using it to kill bad guys, in which case control away'. Seriously, releasing a Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptors into an area with lots and lots of people potentially around? That literally goes against the idea the first three movies spent beating into our heads.  Then there's the hubris of man, creating dinosaurs because they could not because they should. This was represented by Wu & Hammond in the original movie, Ludlow in the Lost World, and Billy in Jurassic Park III. In this movie, it's represented by... everyone at Jurassic World, including Dr. Wu. At first it seems like they're playing things straight, until the end when it's revealed (too subtly for the casual moviegoer to notice, in my experience) that Dr. Wu created the I. rex's traits (camouflage, raptor speak, etc.) to make it a tool for InGen's private military contractors. In other words, they created the I. rex and planned its escape & the park's collapse and everything worked out. Well, everything but Hoskins' death, but really, who expected anything else?  As for life finding a way, it doesn't. The only time nature ""finds a way"" is when the I. rex escapes, and even then it's a genetically-engineered monster raised in total isolation and captivity. In The Lost World novel, it was established that the only reason the Velociraptors were savage beasts killing for fun instead of just hunting for food & survival was because they lacked the upbringing that social, intelligent animals like them or people need. At first it seems like I. rex plays this straight, until it speaks to the raptors, completely abandoning that idea. Further, the release of the animals in the park? 100% the fault of Human tampering: Velociraptors released to hunt I. rex, pterosaurs released because a helicopter chased I. rex into the aviary, T. rex released to fight I. rex... life never finds a way in this movie, it just does whatever it gets asked to do.  Characters  Gray and Zach are simultaneously great and terrible. The acting from Robinson and Simpkins is good whenever they're running away from dinosaurs, but until then you have to deal with Zach eyeing girls & texting his girlfriend and Gray rattling off random facts that are occasionally significant & crying about their parents' divorce (could have been a good throwback to the original book, but it's not). They get better, but Gray's realization at the end that they ""need more teeth"" to fight the I. rex was a big spoiler for the Mosasaurus saving the day in the end, following his ""it has eighty teeth"" line when seeing it near the beginning.  Owen, Chris Pratt's character, is the best part of this movie, but as much as I like Pratt it's not a good character. His raptor-tamer persona never seemed real to me, and the way he treats Claire in their first on-screen interaction makes him seem like the kind of guy to frequent r/all. He's obviously the spokesman for the original themes of the series, but as the plot progresses and those themes become nil, he gradually loses significance until he's sitting there telling the kids to shut up and be quiet.  Claire, played by Bryce Dallas Howard, is the second-best thing about this movie. She obviously plays like the business side of John Hammond without the sympathetic side, but she becomes likeable the moment she remembers her nephews are in the park and must be found. Like Pratt, her acting was never 100% believable, but at least I could like her.  Hoskins, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, is just terrible. Seriously, he reeks of ""bad guy"" from the moment he shows up in the film. The revelation that he bought of Dr. Wu (who is more faithful to the book version of his character but that's not a good thing) is contrived and exists only to set up the sequel, which will presumably be titled The Lost Park: Jurassic World.  Vivian & Lowery, who work the control room, are incredibly forgettable. In the wake of Tim Hunt's ""girls cry in the lab"" comments Vivian seems like an awful stereotype, and their last scene together where Lowery is rejected by her would be perfect if they were in a spoof or deconstruction, not a dramatic movie.  The I. rex is the worst character in the movie. The entire premise of the past movies, as pertaining to dinosaurs, was to treat them like animals. Instead, the producers took one of the dinosaurs and made it into a serial killer-type villain, killing for sport. Seriously, the I. rex might as well have gone into a ""do you want to know how I got these scars?"" monologue. It's cartoon villainy is so anthropomorphic it hurts.  Science  I briefly went over my problems with the creatures & their designs here.  In short, Jurassic World was awful."
Paleontology,39ovyz,infidelappel,4,Sun Jun 14 05:50:47 2015 UTC,"Man, you summed up a lot of my thoughts quite well.  For me, I can't call it awful because it was highly entertaining. I enjoyed the monster mayhem, I can't deny it.  But it falls under the category of stupid blockbuster. It's the kind of movie that requires you not to evaluate it, because the writing is god awful. The characters are all one-dimensional garbage. Everyone who represents some kind of scientific interest is unbelievably short sighted, borderline incompetent in their ability to perform genetic modification with any reasonable degree of control, and insanely ambivalent toward any kind of ethics. The scientists in Jurassic Park seemed humble and well intentioned while still being highly intelligent, if mistaken. The scientists in Jurassic World are pretty much just stupid bad guys. ""Do you think we're doing mad science here?"" No, Dr. Wu, just bad 'science.'  It's a shame that there wasn't anybody in this film representing science that one could aspire to, like Grant or Sattler from the first film. They were heroes, intellectuals - and Sattler was an actual strong female character, unlike Dallas Bryce Howard's picture of impracticality - and they inspired people to want to be like them. I'd want nothing to do with any of the characters in this film, except maybe Chris Pratt, and even then he was a pretty stupid action hero.   The script is entirely formulaic, through and through. Seriously, I already had it pegged that the raptors and T-rex would fight the Indominus and figured the Mosasaurus would finish it off the moment they had the final battle take place even remotely near the tank.   So that's what kills me. Jurassic Park was a great film. It was well written, it was intelligent, it had characters who felt real. The movie had suspense, subtlety, and it didn't just land on trope after trope. Jurassic World was like a big cartoon, with flat characters, and just about every line of dialog in it was taken straight out of the blockbuster handbook.   It's just such a shame that a franchise with such intelligent beginnings now falls into the same category of Transformers. It was entertaining, downright thrilling at times, but it was just...stupid."
Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,3,Sat Jun 13 15:51:16 2015 UTC,"Agreed so hard with the part about no likable scientists to aspire to, it's truly a shame! Grant with his ""big turkey"" talk in the first movie was so enthralling. With this movie being back in the labs again and full of activity, certainly there could have been a awesome science moment somewhere."
Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,2,Sun Jun 14 03:35:28 2015 UTC,"I agree so much with almost all of your post, except that Claire was not really a great character... Guess I'll go ahead and write an essay up too! Thanks for yours."
Paleontology,39ovyz,In_Medias_Res,2,Sun Jun 14 06:03:09 2015 UTC,"Make no mistake, she wasn't great. Her character was sympathetic enough to make up for her sub-par actor and poor writing. All-in-all, mediocre character at best."
Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:25:00 2015 UTC,Oh man on my other post I didn't even mention the flying reptiles picking people and even the heavy petting zoo dinos up! What a wreck. Was way cool to see them dive in the water like pelicans though.
Paleontology,39ovyz,huseph,1 point,Sun Jun 14 04:31:51 2015 UTC,The spearfishing was maybe the only part of the movie that made the dinosaur lover in me get excited. That was awesome
Paleontology,39ovyz,TheGoldenFruit,1 point,Sun Jun 14 06:04:56 2015 UTC,Velociraptors are not that large. My friends hated my for telling them that lol.
Paleontology,39ovyz,KommandCBZhi,2,Wed Jun 17 06:52:20 2015 UTC,I believe it is explained during one scene why they are as large as they are.
Paleontology,39ovyz,TheGoldenFruit,1 point,Sat Jun 13 14:22:32 2015 UTC,"It was implied, but not explained lol"
Paleontology,39ovyz,GlimmerBeast,2,Sat Jun 13 15:40:22 2015 UTC,"The scene was where Wu was discussing all the bits of animal DNA that were made into the I. rex. He stated that none of the animals in the park are ""real"" or ""true"" dinos or something to that effect. This is because ALL the DNA recovered is flawed in some way and needs to be patched with assorted other animals. Implying that even the species they tried to get as correct as possible could go awry, let alone when someone wanted some crazy new species."
