Intelligence,3e3a3x,Takeme2yourleader,2,Tue Jul 21 17:07:19 2015 UTC,Extreme sports people are known for taking risks. Once I knew a climber who took his pregnant wife on a climb despite a blizzard warning. They very nearly died in the blizzard and then he came back acting glib about it. So whether these hikers are spies or adrenaline junkies is hard to say.   What happened to Mr. Levinson is beyond my knowledge. I worry about unfit people being hung out to dry though. Whether the CIA was even involved or whether they properly trained him is speculative. Institutions are imperfect in general though. I know with the US Military there were some allegations of medically unfit people being involved in combat duties during the recent occupations despite efforts to prevent that.

Espionage is always denied and if caught you're on your own. A lot of fake journalist credintials, passports, and other country's are not stupid. There is a reason we have stars on with no names on the CIA wall. It's a dirty dirty a game. And wars are started and ended due to it. So you don't like the fact you are hung out to dry? Too fucking bad. You signed up for it. You knew it. It's the nature of the business and the business is to manipulate and deceive without being officially traced back if caught. Don't get all liberal and human rights on me. You think the enemy does that shit?  That's the issue with the U.S.  We are totally unaware of the shit that goes on out there. One. We have no business knowing because if we did know we couldn't comprehend it. Two, national security. Three. The world is a dirty violent place. And if we let our foot off the gas for one second, the rest of the world will accelerate to catch up. WWI was a prime example of what happens when you don't keep up. So yea, do people get left to dry, alone. And dead. Yes. But don't think for a second that that's not the way the game is played. And for medically unfit? What does that even mean for field operatives. If they have a skill set that is needed asap, it outweighs. Now there is a difference between a CIA field op and an asset."

It is one thing to send in trained professionals and quite another to send in amateurs. If the CIA were using US national amateurs as a matter of practice I think there would be a lot more stars on that wall at Langley with no names on them. Ethically you try to protect your own people and limit your losses. I am a realist. I know you send people into the fray and you cannot get everyone out. I also know people die in car accidents each day. It is the world we live in. I see the bigger picture so to speak.   In terms of people volunteering that really depends on what you are volunteering for. I mean if you are homeless and join the military out of desperation as a supply orderly you probably are not expecting to be sent on a one way special forces mission.

Intelligence,3dx9ds,00000000000000000000,4,Mon Jul 20 08:05:37 2015 UTC,"Oh man, this video has so much misinformation that I don't even know where to start. But here we go:    0:04 - The Kurdish Worker's Party, or PKK, is a military group based in northern Syria, Turkey, and Iraq   Not even partway through the first sentence and already misleading. What makes this misleading is that the person appears to be using the term PKK to mean several different several different Kurdish factions operating in the region, such as the Peshmerga in Iraq and the YPG in Syria. It is the Peshmerga who is the military force. The PKK has never reached a point where it operated in a similar fashion to a conventional military. And the PKK are primarily based in southeastern Turkey, though they also based themselves out of northern Iraq since since the 1990s (to engage in attacks in Turkey) and have relocated their forces in Iraq as part of negotiations with the Turkish government. The PKK was only based in northern Syria for a time when Hafez al-Assad was providing the group safe haven between 1984-1988, which ended after Turkey threatened military action against Syria unless they kicked out the PKK. Some PKK members have joined the fight in Syria, but the number is only a fraction of the Kurdish forces in the conflict.    0:08 - and one of the U.S.'s biggest allies in the fight against ISIS   No. It's the Peshmerga in northern Iraq that is the U.S. ally. Additionally you could say that the YPG--the military wing of the PYD, which is the predominate Kurdish political party in Rojava (Kurdish Syria)--is also one, but I think that would be describing the relationship as something more than it really is. Although the PKK is likely coordinating, or at least cooperating, with the YPG and the Peshmerga (though probably not to the same extent since the Peshmerga is a far more powerful force) they are not a part of U.S. operations against ISIS.     0:23 - His name is Abdullah Ocalan   This is more of a nitpick: His name is pronounced oe-JA-lahn, because in Turkish the ""c"" is pronounced like an English ""j"". I know its not a big deal, but if you are doing a video on the guy you should at least pronounce his name right.    0:32 - ...he founded the PKK in the 1970s. It started as a protest group...   1978 to be exact. But while the group did start out as a protest group, its focus was on the Kurdish elite inside Turkey as much as against the Turkish government itself. The group was initially heavily influenced by Marxism and also against rightist groups that exist in Turkey at the time.    0:40 - ...in an attempt to win independence for the Kurdish people   Semi-true. The PKK's objectives have been very fluid over its existence and have adjusted the status of the Turkish and global political conditions. When the group was founded, they were actually seeking to establish a Kurdish state that would be founded on a Marxist-Leninist ideology. The nationalists goals only became more prominent after the downfall of the Soviet Union, but in reality the goal of independence was much less important than the passage of laws that allowed for greater Kurdish rights while remaining a part of the Turkish state.    0:44 - Today, many people would refer to these early PKK members as freedom fighters...   Again, that is true but also misleading. The PKK does have support from a sizable portion of the Kurdish population inside Turkey. However, for much of the PKK's existence the majority of Kurds in Turkey were not interested in independence, but more cultural rights. And many of the opponents against the PKK were other Kurds. The PKK was known for attacking and killing other Kurds who did not join or support their group or were seen as supporting the Turkish government. The organization was most notorious for assassinating teachers and firebombing schools, sometimes with the students still in them. This led to Ocalan's nickname, ""baby-killer.""   0:52 - So the PKK was added to the U.S. terrorist list   As well as those in the EU, the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Austria, Azerbaijan, Iraq, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Kazakhstan, Moldova, New Zealand, and the Philippines. This was the sentence that set off my bullshit alarms.   1:07 - According to a CIA report, ""By 1999, Abdullah Ocalan had become the world's most prominent Kurdish figure and a fugitive driven out of several countries.""   That's true, because he was the head of a widely recognized terrorist organization. Also he had not been in Turkey since 1980, prior to the start of the PKK's insurgency. Between 1980 and 1998 he his time moving between training camps in Lebanon and his residence in Damascus, where he ran the PKK's operations.   Also I'm not sure why the CIA had to be cited for this; this is literally common knowledge and can be found on Wikipedia.   1:11 - He had been forced out of Turkey, then Syria, then Russia.   She forgot Italy, where he was arrested and held for two months. Turkey requested his extradition to be tried on terrorism charges, but Italy's laws prevent extradition to countries with the death penalty (Turkey no longer has the death penalty since the early 2000s). Of course Ocalan left Italy of his own volition and then went to Greece.   1:14 - He eventually made his way to Greece, where many saw him as a fold hero   Ocalan was welcomed in Greece because he was an enemy of Turkey, not because the Greek government cared about his cause. In fact, the hatred for Turkey was so high at the time that the Greek foreign minister, interior minister, and the public-order minister were forced to resign because it was assumed that they assisted Turkey in the capture of Ocalan. The then Greek Prime Minister, Costas Simitis, tried to improve relations with Turkey but this was too much for many Greek leftists and nationalists.   EDIT: After sleeping on the scotch I was drinking when I wrote this last night, there are a few additional things that would like to add. First, the biggest issue for me is that this video seems to present the conflict with the PKK as very one-sided. They don't explain why the PKK was put on the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, or why it is considered to be a terrorist organization at all. More than 45,000 people were killed in Turkey during this conflict. Although most of the violence was contained to southeastern Turkey, the PKK engaged in attacks in other parts of Turkey and even against Turkish businesses and establishments in Western Europe. Similarly, the PKK killed family members of Kurds who worked with the Turkish government and for a short time engaged in a suicide-bombing campaign. The PKK has also targeted and killed Westerners in Turkey, although the number is small compare to the number of Turks and Kurds they have killed.  Don't get me wrong, Turkey's policies towards the Kurds have for decades been horrendous. And the forces associated with the Turkish government committed a number of crimes themselves, such as extrajudicial killings, during this conflict. Only recently has the status of Kurds in Turkey gotten better, but there is still a more to be done. But to classify the PKK as just an organization of freedom fighters is disingenuous at best and deliberately misleading at the worst. I think/hope that it stems from a lack of understanding. Americans generally view the Kurds as our allies because of our relationship with the Peshmerga during the Iraq War. However, Kurds are not a monolith; those that we consider our allies are not the same groups as those we consider terrorists.   The second thing that bothered me about this video was that information about how the CIA help capture Ocalan isn't really mentioned in this video, other then the presenter saying that the CIA did it. The CIA, Turkish intelligence (MIT), and the Greek Intelligence (EYP) are all suspected of playing a role in Ocalan's arrest. I feel like this is a missed opportunity to examine how intelligence agencies cooperate with each other, especially among countries that are not particularly found of each other.   Third, the link to the video at the end on whether or not the PKK is a terrorist organization is just as uninformative, false, and misleading as this one. I don't want to do another blow-by-blow of what they did wrong, but a few things are immediately obvious. 1) They again confuse the PKK with the numerous other Kurdish militant groups such as the Peshmerga. 2) They say that the Kurds are banned from forming party to be represented in parliament, which is not true anymore. This video was even made after the historic turnout for the predominately Kurdish HDP in the recent elections where they got 13% of the vote. 3) The video talks about the Kurds were displaced by Turkish government but don't describe the role that the PKK played as well. 4) The ruling to remove the PKK from the EU's terrorist list was made by the Luxembourg Court of First Instance. I don't know much about the EU's judicial system to know if this was a ruling that could be enforced on the EU at large. 5) The video downplays the PKK's role in the drug trade, though they do it by not really stating Turkey's role as a transit point in the drug trade instead of a producer or buyer of drugs. Additionally it also glosses over the PKK's other fundraising methods such as extortion of Kurdish businesses."

Intelligence,3dev8t,blackbutters,6,Thu Jul 16 15:48:46 2015 UTC,"No, I meant Syrian. It was in 2007, I think. The Israeli bombers went over the Mediterian, to the West of the Syrian coastline, then East over the Turkish-Syrian border, then used electronic warfare to convince the Syrian anti-air defense that their (Russian) radar was malfunctioning, turned South and bombed the reactor. The codeword for the successful bombing was ""ARIZONA"".  This was the second operation (the third was the assassination of the Syrian general mentioned above). The first operation was inserting commandos in Syria to take soil and water samples from the area where the suspected reactor was. Analyzing them determined that it was indeed a nuclear reactor but was not yet operational. A North Korean ship was supposed to reach a Syrian port soon; it was assumed that it brought critical equipment for the Syrian secret nuclear program and the decision was made to bomb the reactor.  The Syrians had managed to keep the program secret by not using any electronic media to say anything about it; messages were printed on typewriters and delivered by courier.  The Israelis did not advertise the successful airstrike, hoping that the Syrians would do the same. And, indeed, the Syrians announced that an Israeli airstrike has been ""successfully repulsed"" and didn't say a word about the bombed reactor.  Come on, folks, surely this isn't news? A considerable time must have passed for the information to be revealed to journalists, the TV documentary to be made, and it wasn't even a very new documentary, since it was dubbed in German.

Intelligence,3ckifc,Gray_Finder,12,Wed Jul 8 23:43:21 2015 UTC,"Well, the counter argument would be that while they prop up the media to raise awareness, behind the scenes, they are thwarting these attacks but not releasing the details of it in order to protect the economy and other political and social repercussions.  Or, at least, that's the best one I could think of.  At this point, it really does just look like ""the boy who cried wolf terrorism."" But a lot of that can be attributed to the 24 hour news cycle and the drama queens of main stream news broadcasts; Some official says we need to stay vigilant to prevent terrorist attacks, one reporter reports it as ""Government official urges public to be on the watch for possible terrorism"" and by the end of the hour it's ""AW MY GAD, OSAMA'S GHOST IS GOING TO RELEASE MUSTARD GAS ALL OVER THE SUBWAYS!"""

Seems that the DoD is the one that has all the data and surveillance with their NSA projects.  It's possible DHS and DoJ(FBI) were even right in their predictions, but perhaps DoD stopped the threats without telling anyone.  Alternatively, DHS may have mistakenly thought DoJ undercover operations were imminent threats, and DoJ may have through DHS operations were threats.  TL/DR: Too many top-level agencies spying on the US.  Perhaps they should consolidate DHS and DoJ, and move the NSA's domestic operations under that combined agency instead of DoD."

Got it. We're going to have to agree to disagree because I don't subscribe to your viewpoints, they are enemy combatants and will be dealt with as such.  EDIT: I'd just like to point out that there are smalls bits of information indicating Americans of a certain descent heeded the call of returning to the fatherland, aka Nazi Germany, in WW2, and we probably had no problem killing them in battle because they would have killed our people. This is no different.  Oh, and just to point out the obvious, but the Americans who have gone to join these militant organizations wouldn't give a second thought to cutting your head off with the same dull knives that they've killed our other American, British, and Japanese comrades with. This is torturous behavior that causes unbelievable pain in the last moments of a victims' life, and very intentional. It's Daesh policy to be as brutal as possible. Are these folks you really want coming back to North America to attack regular civilians and military members just going about their lives? It's not just here in the US, but Canada as well, and you already know about Europe. Once they made the decision to join the warped ""Army of Allah"" and wear the flag of jihad, they stopped being Americans. It's also interesting that it's Americans who put western hostages in the line of fire of drones, but you still seem to defend the ""rights"" of those who commit these acts. It's just not right and I can't find any logic in it, I'm sorry."

A source told Motherboard that the hackers appears to have gotten “everything,” likely more than what the hacker has posted online, perhaps more than one terabyte of data.  “The hacker seems to have downloaded everything that there was in the company’s servers,” the source, who could only speak on condition of anonymity, told Motherboard. “There’s pretty much everything here.”   Likely, the reason they are recommending that customers stop using the software is because it contains auto-update functionality and the private key used for code signing has been compromised. This means an attacker could upload malicious updates to the repository for distribution to customers.  One of the most concerning bits:   Hacking Team asked its customers to shut down operations, but according to one of the leaked files, as part of Hacking Team’s “crisis procedure,” it could have killed their operations remotely. The company, in fact, has “a backdoor” into every customer’s software, giving it ability to suspend it or shut it down—something that even customers aren’t told about."

As for the Army, cybercom could find use for this, we know China uses open market tools to some extent for their own cyber espionage operations.

Intelligence,3c543d,Trollsense,2,Sat Jul 4 22:07:21 2015 UTC,"There used to be a Department of Defense website that hosted responses and security clearance judge determinations but they removed it recently. I don't know of any other location that offers sample writs. There are a number of security clearance professionals who may be able to provide you some examples on the clearance forums at: https://forum.federalsoup.com/default.aspx?g=topics&f=22  Please note that SOR responses typically only work at DoD, as unfortunate as this is. If you were denied a security clearance by the Intelligence Community, they very rarely reconsider a clearance mainly because they've already likely passed another candidate forward to fill the billet. For instance, the Central Intelligence Agency may send a number of candidates through the security process for a single billet, or posting, because some may not make it through. If all make it through, some are actually wait listed until the next funding quarter when they can bring on more than one individual for the billet in question - it's an oversubscription model. Unless you were specifically told that you weren't eligible for any future clearances, you would probably have to go through the security clearance process again. Please note that the process is the same at NSA as well even though it falls under DoD, because they handle their clearance process much in the same way Langley does. If it's at DIA, NGO, or the DoD side of NRO, you have the opportunity to take it before the administrative judge, and this is where the lawyer comes in to play. Some will take your case pro-bono if you can't afford it because they are paid by the government if you case is won, in some cases.  I hope that helps, best of luck to you."

The birthday cake was fake, with a top that looked like a cake but concealed a device underneath, created by the CIA’s technical operations wizards, called the jack-in-the-box. The CIA knew that KGB surveillance teams almost always followed a car from behind and rarely pulled alongside. It was possible for a car carrying a CIA officer to slip around a corner or two, momentarily out of view. In that brief interval, the CIA case officer could jump out of the car and disappear. At the same time, the jack-in-the-box would spring erect, a pop-up that looked, in outline, like the head and torso of the case officer who had just jumped out.

They aren't linked, as the government officials mention - the method still requires a great deal of manual labor. It's similar to passing an unclassified document from NIPR to JWICS, it requires extensive vetting of the document in a way that there's no chance of malware or information ever being passed up. It's not uncommon for a document to be printed on unclassified, and then scanned in on SIPR or JWICS so that it's essentially a new document. Then the writers of both articles bring in some retired folks who worked counterintelligence, an ex-Green Beret, and CIA field operations to comment (some left service more than 5-10 years ago by a quick google search, others don't have names mentioned) - these people have no idea what takes place in security on a day to day basis. Obviously agencies such as State or DHS need to pass information from OPM FIS to JWICS so that adjudication of SCI can take place, and so that other agencies may view your information when approving visit. This is bad journalism all around IMO, something not entirely uncommon coming from The Daily Beast.  You can find this process listed on some of the open wikis on .gov sites and on FAS via their vast libraries of government documents on handling of classified material, so it's no big secret."

Since OPM was pwned for so long, any coordination between techs in the agencies was likely monitored. So things like passwords and configurations may have been leaked.  If the attackers knew data was going to be copied, it's quite likely that they would tamper with that data to exploit vulnerabilities in the receiving systems.  A data link between the agencies increases the risk greatly. Unless they printed and re-entered the data by hand, I'd be taking a very close look at egress from SC."

Intelligence,3bd29k,Mr_Knight13,10,Sun Jun 28 01:54:16 2015 UTC,"Reapply at other agencies, unless you were specifically told that you were unfit for any future security clearance requests. To be honest, there's a very good chance that the only reason you weren't moved to the next stage, is because another individual beat you to the punch (or they had some slight doubts about information brought up in the investigation). When IC hires for billets, they tend to have an ""oversubscription"" model where they actually send multiple individuals through the pre-employment security process for a single posting, they hold the logic that some will fail security along the way. I know it's not ideal, but it's true. I know folks who were found unfit by security the first go-around, but were approved later on when reapplying. My advice - don't give up, especially if it's your passion. I'd also make sure that your SF-86 is 100% accurate, because security is looking for any reason to toss your clearance request, especially if they find a mistake and you fail to fess up to it (and trust me, they just about always find it).  There are IO jobs at DHS HQ and State that will fit, and they don't typically require a polygraph."

Get on USAjobs.gov and anything that you qualify for in the 0100 (social science, includes intelligence analysis), will present an opportunity.  If the military interests you -- or if other careers out there that are listed among the critical skills the agencies you are interested in maintain -- then explore those options, too.  The military, law enforcement and intelligence community personnel demands change all the time, so you've got to be able to role with the supply/demand situation that creates.  Your first polygraph is always a shitty experience, don't let it slow you down.  Also, just because that was the stage you stopped at does not mean you were disqualified for not being truthful.

During the tests some armed bats were accidentally released and incinerated the test range and roosted under a fuel tank at Carlsbad Army Airfield. The project actually produced decent results according to the observers of successful tests. It was canceled by  Fleet Admiral Ernest J. King because he felt it would not be ready before the atomic bomb, which would (and did) render it useless. It is estimated to have cost $2 Million.  The cat wire mentioned below. Though I don't know if it was tested in Moscow. The project is estimated to have cost $20 million dollars and the first time it was tried on a soviet compound in Washington D.C. the can was hit and killed by a taxi right out of the gate. Other reasons for cancellation included ""difficulty of training the cat to behave as required"" and ""problems with distraction"".

Sadly, the best that we could come up with is Stability Operations doctrine and alot money, time and lives spent on teaching western military doctrine to thousands of foreign fighters who will never use it.  Why won't they use it? Because our conventional military doctrine is only effective against adversaries who are using similar doctrine. It provides a level playing field.  The problem is, there hasn't been a level playing field for almost 70 years.  The truth of the matter is that the world at large already KNOWS how to combat an insurgency. The Umayyad Caliphate comes to mind and provides a possible glimpse into where things may be headed if the world is unable to get its hands around the situation.  The motives of these extremists are nothing new...but yet, 80% of the population acts like it is. Perhaps its because they don't want to admit that outside the safety of developed countries, the world is more fucked up than they could ever imagine.  For instance - in America, if you resist arrest or threaten a cop, there's a good chance that you are going to get roughed up. If someone screams ""human rights violation"" though and tells a compelling story, the person who got scuffed up gets to sue the police force, whether the force was justified or not.  In many parts of the world, if you were to attempt the same thing, they kill you. If your loved ones speak up, they are killed. Its just that simple.  That's not to say that bad things do not happen in developed countries, but not to the same extent that it does in the counties where you have warlords instead of police officers.  Its a problem of perception, and its something that is being used against us.  Our leadership focuses so much on the public opinion regarding the moral pitfalls of combat. Opinions of people who never have, and most likely never will, be put into a situation where they must take the life of another in defense of their own or the people around them.  We have the most powerful military in the world, the smartest scientists and supposedly the the best strategists...and yet they get so wrapped up in making combat user friendly and publicly palatable that they make our military completely ineffective; instead of focusing on how to make the most out of our resources and learn to balance the use of soft power to mitigate the cultural instability which allows extremism to thrive, and hard-power to obliterate anyone or anything which would seek to disrupt the effort being made towards stability.  The Army War College teaches 4GW - but only as theory, and does so only in relation to what they call “Hybrid Warfare”; despite the fact that the threats that the world faces currently more or less meets that exact criteria of 4GW:  “Fourth generation warfare is defined as conflicts which involve the following elements:  Are complex and long term.  Terrorism (tactic).  A non-national or transnational base –highly decentralized.  A direct attack on the enemy's culture, including genocidal acts against civilians.  Highly sophisticated psychological warfare, especially through media manipulation and lawfare - *To convince the enemy’s political decision makers that their goals are either unachievable or too costly for the perceived benefit.  All available pressures are used – political, economic, social and military.  Occurs in low intensity conflict, involving actors from all networks.  Non-combatants are tactical dilemmas.  Lack of hierarchy.  Small in size, spread out network of communication and financial support.  Use of insurgency and guerrilla tactics.”  Simply put, the US military has historically operated under the planning assumption of “known threats”, as you cannot formulate a strategy against something unless you can define, contain and study it. What we have failed to realize is that this premise is most effective only when dealing directly with another sovereign nation that driven by something more than religious fanaticism. It is extremely difficult to apply it to an ideologically  driven organization because there are far too many variables involved - most of which are unique to the individual who prescribes to that particular ideology.  You cannot physically injure an ideology because it is not tangible, and you cannot wage a war against an intangible enemy… regardless of how we define it for the sake of planning or what a group chooses to calls itself.  ISIL, AQAP, Boko Haram, Daesh, etc.; at the end of the day, it is not the name that defines them; it is the beliefs that the individuals within these groups share and their willingness to do whatever needs to be done for the sake of those beliefs.  By defining these groups by what they are calling themselves and not by what they are as a whole, we are only throwing gas on the fire because we are acknowledging their made up sovereignty. We are giving them an individual identity which can be used to further their agenda.  When terrorism is used as a tactic by any organization, it relies on fear as a means to destabilize the environment. It does not matter if it is Hezbollah or the Earth Liberation Front. This fear is spread by reputation and notoriety, which is only achievable this if people know about it. If nobody cares though or there is no group to tweet: “it was us who did X, Y or Z”, then this tactic fails and nobody even blinks.    To put it into perspective, think about how many VBIED’s have gone off in Mosul, Tal Afar, Kabul or Kandahar City in the past 10 years. Out of all of those bombings, how many times do you remember hearing any reports of an extremist organization taking responsibility?  Once you strip away the catchy names and branding that these groups are known by, you are left with a group of individuals who simply do not give a shit about ROE, the Geneva conventions, or any of the other things that drives our own doctrine and they use that to their advantage.  For 14 years, the entire world, our adversaries included, have watched us in two different theaters of operation. They have seen our success and failures, and thanks to the media - all in HD sound and video. They know our TTP’s. They know our formations. They know what kind of equipment we use. Shit, they even know our patches.  Strategically speaking, we are now the “known threat”."

Of course that won't do much for the cheating spouses, pedophiles, and other crooks whom the Chinese catch redhanded with traditional blackmail schemes. I suspect we'll be seeing quite a few security clearance re-investigation denials in the coming months. Polygraphs to follow at especially paranoid agencies regardless of whether or not they were affected, aka NSA. Then again, coming in to work with mismatched colors is likely to get you polygraphed at NSA these days.  It would have been really disastrous if ScatteredCastles or JPAS was hacked, because OPM only services non-DoD/IC departments that require collateral clearances. Unfortunately, DHS and State still adjudicate SCI based on the OPM SSBI, so they can target just about anyone under ""cyber security"" and ""intelligence"" at State or DHS HQ and be reasonably positive that they have SCI. Honestly, this is rather ridiculous.  There are around four million security clearances in the US, last I read, but only one million SF-86 were stored on the OPM servers. I'm not sure how many of those one million with stolen SF-86 are TS, but I doubt it's the majority. It would have been a far different story if JPAS or SC was compromised, because those have overwhelming TS numbers."

All of the US professors I have known that have taught abroad in China have been approached directly in person with money mentioned. I guess it seems desperate to me to try so hard to recruit people with no access, government employment, or particular technical expertise of direct value.   I am sure the Chinese will go wild with with this OPM data, even though it could have been much worse. China won't even need to use blackmail, they can just go around offering money and money is very easy to hide these days."
Intelligence,3aobjy,Trollsense,3,Mon Jun 22 14:20:41 2015 UTC,"Oh, don't get me wrong, I totally agree. Polygraphs are effective at garnering largely useless and bland information, it's more of an interrogation tactic designed to intimidate newbies than anything. See how you act under pressure, and all that. FS polygraphs weed out quite a few newbies who would have potential security issues, such as past crimes, that they freely admit under the severe pressure. I've even heard some rumors that they had a guy confess to murder in the early 2000s because he was scared shitless, and if you go read some of the other boards on the net - that's a pretty common theme. The more aggressive the examiner in pushing your buttons, or saying ""I see that you're holding back - the machine can see it, I can see it plain as day. Tell me and you'll feel that a weight has been lifted."" They portray that the machine can actually determine that you're hiding information, when you are more likely to be extremely nervous and under stress from the more rude examiners. So, folks start to divulge things such as theft of candy as kids, to more serious crimes. Things start going really pear-shaped when folks use evasion tactics, they're often caught and ejected. The more likely you're to believe that the polygraph can actually detect lies, the more you'll cop to - that is, until you've been there six or seven times, and then you realize it's an over-glorified vitals and perspiration monitor.  The thing about the Chinese is that they always have the long term approach, something our idiot politicians seem to lack comprehension of. They may be recruiting an individual with no access or even a complete lack of security clearance, but if they are an industry leader or a professor, it wouldn't be very difficult for them to obtain employment working where they have access to the most sensitive programs. And they'll still pay you while you acquire that employment as if you were providing direct information.

The reorganization is part of a broader effort by director John Brennan to break down CIA “stove pipes” that have been in place for decades, which some felt isolated the agency’s secretive spy network from its internal religious experts, computer hackers, linguists, and others.  “As our analysts gain better insight into how ISIL is operating, that will inform the efforts of the people in the [spy division] who are charged with collecting additional information and intelligence about ISIL,” CIA Deputy Director David Cohen said in an interview, using another name for Islamic State. “It will help steer them into areas where we have gaps.”  The White House, Pentagon, and numerous intelligence agencies are re-evaluating how they combat Islamic State, which has expanded its reach and influence in the past year into more corners of Iraq and Syria, as well as North Africa, Europe, and Southeast Asia.  After Islamic State seized the Iraqi city of Ramadi in recent weeks and expanded into Anbar province, the Pentagon said it would send 450 additional U.S. troops to the area to accelerate the training of security forces. The State Department is pressing to keep an international coalition intact. But the CIA’s strategy largely has been secret.  Islamic State militants pose a much different terror threat than al Qaeda did in the early 2000s, using social media to win converts and a harder-to-stop financial strategy that uses extortion and war gains to fund operations, instead of tapping wealthy donors.  This model has made it a more difficult terror organization to stop, said current and former U.S. officials. The officials are hopeful that the CIA’s burgeoning structure will better prepare the agency to thwart the expanding terror group.  The CIA traditionally had dealt with organizations such as Islamic State through its Counterterrorism Center, a group of spies and analysts who worked to prevent imminent threats.  Mr. Brennan, however, wants to use the agency’s redesign to confront Islamic State through numerous new divisions, each of which has its own network of spies, analysts, linguists, computer and cultural experts.  For example, of the CIA’s 10 “mission centers”—it previously had just two—at least five will be tasked with combating Islamic State, including groups called “Near East,” “Europe and Eurasia,” “South and Central Asia,” and “Global Issues.”  CIA officials will be scrutinizing Islamic State’s foothold in Mosul, Iraq, its communication among fighters who return from Syria to Europe, as well as a group of religious experts who specialize in radical extremism.  A network of computer analysts will be assigned to each team to provide support, screen social media and develop spyware.  Such collaboration will help with “targeting our operations against the areas in ISIL where we think there are vulnerabilities,” Mr. Cohen said. As the agency’s spies “develop other information, [it] will feed back to our analysts.”  The restructuring so far is going well, he said, though the reviews from several former agency officials have been more mixed. Some said the changes were overdue, as the CIA largely had been operating under a personnel model put in place in the 1960s. But others said it would take much more time for the agency’s spies to feel comfortable working so closely with analysts and computer experts, as they tend to be more independent.  “I see it as a reflection of how the U.S. is reacting to the post-Arab spring world where the threats are multiplying and becoming more intractable,” said Bruce Hoffman, director of the security studies program at Georgetown University.  He said the various threats “aren’t so easily compartmentalized as they once were” and require more coordination among intelligence agencies.  Congress and the White House realigned intelligence agencies after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, pressing them to work more closely together and share information. But much of the focus was on preventing attacks and killing militant leaders.  CIA officials, however, believed more internal changes were necessary to maximize cooperation given the diverse threats, including Islamic State, but also Russia, China, and Iran.  These changes are unfolding as the CIA works to regain its footing after a series of scandals and setbacks.  Congressional Democrats blasted the agency last year over allegations that detainees had been abused while in CIA custody after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.  And in May, the White House revealed that U.S. officials errantly had killed two hostages, including a U.S. citizen, during a drone strike in Pakistan. The White House didn’t identify the drone strike as a CIA program, but officials familiar with the incident confirmed it was carried out by the agency.  Much of the agency’s operations still remain covert and secret. Two unnamed CIA officials were killed in the line of duty last year, the agency recently revealed, though it wouldn’t say what they were doing or where they were killed.  Mr. Cohen, who joined the agency in February after spending six years at the Treasury Department, has already visited CIA stations in Asia and Africa, in addition to one “domestic station” that he would not identify, talking to officials about the changes and checking on staff morale.  Mr. Brennan and Mr. Cohen have stressed that the CIA reorganization is about much more than combating Islamic State because it would impact the agency’s teams focused on China, North Korea, and even South and Central America.  Islamic State, however, could pose the biggest near-term test for the CIA realignment, particularly given congressional pressure on the Obama administration to rethink its approach to battling the militants."

We're already part of the way, because even most Iraqi Sunnis hate them, so winning hearts and minds isn't an issue. We can't do this without support from gulf nations, and TBH, they don't seem to be all that dedicated to destroying Daesh considering they were most likely the initial investors. There's something even more reprehensible to be said about Turkey - considering that they've willingly allowed fighters from Daesh and Jabhat al-Nusra to use their border to flank the Kurds in Syria, and probably still fronts what's left of Daesh crude oil production.  I suspect Israel has some fairly highly placed assets within the organization - because, when don't the Israelis? However, IMO of course, Israel enjoys a destabilized Middle East as it may provide an opportunity to seize more land from the Syrians if the Assad regime falls. I doubt they'll be as forthcoming with information - even to their biggest supporter."

All the terrorist groups in the region benefit from instability in terms of recruitment and operating under the radar. When terror groups do not get state support they can become even more radical and do even worse things for funding. A known evil can be better than unknown one. The situation now is a quagmire of instability that will stretch out decades. All the CIA can do is monitor and mitigate the situation some."

I study counter terrorism and Intelligence as part of my degree program, and have been doing an OSINT project for the last 2.5 years as a hobby/learning tool. No formal background, just a student.  But it doesn't take a background to know that anyone who goes around on the internet claiming to be some secret squirrel spook or commando is lying. There, I said it. Anybody who actually took the time to give a serious answer to this question would be lying, because anyone who was not lying would know better than to answer it. You might get somebody who worked low level IM or SIG for the US military, but that's really going to be about it. All of the people I've met or have worked with who have actually been a part of something or had background never talked about it openly, and would never under any circumstances label themselves that way to strangers. That's because, when you actually make a difference in the world, you have enough self esteem that you don't need to gloat about it or rest on your past deeds to make a present point.

We're in a society where it's not uncommon to see NSA employees on LinkedIn, although I think you'll be hardpressed to find anyone openly admitting to being an officer at Langley. It's true that most field officers and special forces operators remain pretty much secretive their whole lives, but if you're a computer nerd working at HQ, there are plenty of locations on the net where they openly admit to working for the IC. Look up many tech employees of Google on LinkedIn and you'll see quite a few claim to have some past affiliation with NSA, the Agency, NGA, NRO, DIA, NMEC, the list goes on. Working in the IC in a STEM field is a far cry from the highly secretive and rather paranoid nature I can only imagine that those in the field experience (this continues afterwards as well), so you'll find techy folks are more willing to admit to their affiliations mostly after they've departed from their respective agency."

As far as I can tell though, the people of major importance, even within things like SIGINT, don't like to bleed their hand. Low level guys from NSA etc. do it because they need jobs, and its a pretty good thing to have on the resume. On the traditional side of things, as far as I can tell none of these guys actually ever really lose the mindset of constant threat."

Definitely not a STEM thing, although you find most people with the intelligence level working in the IC stem fields tend to be pretty far ahead of the pack, so it's not uncommon to expect some perceived douche baggery. Most high level computer, math, and science geeks tend to be pretty introverted, and some times it can come across as being douchey, but it's not the case.  TBH, I think being douchey is a DC beltway snake pit ritual, but that's just me."

I appreciate your instinctive need to get the troll in. People I am referring to were not NSA, but worked in a similar area, so I count that as a confirmed hit.  I think you're right about the ahead of the pack thing, but that definitely rubs off on the lower echelons of competence too. Some people may be tech gurus, but that doesn't mean every SIGINT nerd with Palantir and a sound proof office is hot shit. I've only met one STEM guy who was really, massively ahead of the game who wasn't private sector, and I could tell right away that they were something special. The rest of the not so special guys seem much more willing to flaunt it, which gets hugely obnoxious very fast."
Intelligence,3a2xl8,ReclaimerSpirit,2,Wed Jun 17 05:17:14 2015 UTC,"See, it was the exact opposite for me. I worked with some of the most intelligent people I'd ever met in my field, and that includes working for several years at one of the major gaming studios, a defense contractor, and eventually the IC. I graduated at one of the highly esteemed UC system schools with my major filled to the brim with super smart folks from Asia, so that says a lot TBH. I think there are some typical government bureaucrats who drag down the IC, and don't get me started on politicians who regularly throw the IC under the bus for their own personal political gain. Folks wonder why DC transforms just about every individual into conducting a life of douchebaggery, and one need not look further than the hostile environment due to policies created by agency directors and middle management who rarely have work experience or technical knowledge of the fields they manage (or they were just really bad at it - but they were promoted because they have friends in high places). Politicians add to this by throwing agency directors under the bus, and it just goes down the line from there. At least that's what I witnessed, it might be different in other work fields within the IC.  I also saw some of the poor workers going crazy with classification to hide how poor their work was from others who may lack access.  I'll turn off my douchebag switch now and swap to a quick rant about China.  I have no problem admitting my past affiliation since I have a terminal illness and don't give a shit anymore (obviously I will take everything to the grave), China probably already got my SF86 anyways since my initial collateral clearance ran through OPM before I transferred to another agency. It's funny, you agree to keep their secrets for a lifetime but they can't seem to keep yours from foreign countries who are now going to use this information to identify good targets. Bad credit/debt? Yep. Criminal activities? Yep. Blackmail city, and China is just as good as we and the Israelis are at targeting prospective agents using pressuring methods. All I can say is, thank God that there is an entirely different system for SCI that is all but impossible for China to reach, because that's where the real ""goods"" are at. It's pretty bad losing investigation data on collateral up to TS, but not nearly as damaging as it would be to have lost the contents of what's on the IC's SCI database.  Okay, so maybe I went a bit off topic, but I really had to rant about that because it's the second time my information has been stolen from the government and one of their contractors who handles SSBI."

When someone hands you a document that has the right markings, everyone just assumes that every word written on it is gospel, and then policy decisions get made off of that shit.    Of course it probably doesn't help that the intelligence community has a ... uh ... low barrier to entry ..."
Intelligence,3a2xl8,masturbathon,2,Tue Jun 16 21:04:04 2015 UTC,"Since when hasn't intelligence collection often been a gamble? You can attempt to verify some information if it is within the realm of possibility, but it may not be. If the source of the information checks out on the standard dossier (if it exists) or through verification with other confirmed agents, then why would an intelligence officer not take the information into account in policy or operational decisions?  The bar for entry is hardly low, Langley has some of the strictest employment requirements. Tens of thousands of applications for intelligence analysis alone, yet only a very few make it through the process. Even over at agencies like NGA, you have to know more than just imagery analysis to be successful - you need a whole spectrum concept of GEOINT. DIA has some questionable hiring standards, I'll admit."

We know; we were there. We were witness to the many bureaucratic indignities that made NSA at least as culpable for pre-9/11 failures as are other U.S. intelligence agencies...  ...“My first day on the job at NSA was 9/11. I was immediately charged as the lead NSA executive to find and deploy the best technology at NSA for the fight against terrorism....  ...“That’s where I found the pre- and post-9/11 intelligence from NSA monitoring of some of the hijackers as they planned the attacks of 9/11 had not been shared outside NSA. This includes critical pre-9/11 intelligence on al-Qaeda, even though it had been worked on by NSA analysts. I learned, for example, that in early 2001 NSA had produced a critical long-term analytic report unraveling the entire heart of al-Qaeda and associated movements. That report also was not disseminated outside of NSA.  “Make no mistake. That data and the analytic report could have, should have prevented 9/11...  ...“In short, when confronted with the prospect of fessing up, NSA chose instead to obstruct the 9/11 congressional investigation, play dumb, and keep the truth buried, including the fact that it knew about all inbound and outbound calls to the safe house switchboard in Yemen. NSA’s senior leaders took me off the task because they realized – belatedly, for some reason – that I would not take part in covering up the truth about how much NSA knew but did not share.  “When the 9/11 Commission hearings began, Director Hayden chortled at executive staff meetings over the fact that the FBI and CIA were feeling the heat for not having prevented 9/11. This was particularly difficult for me to sit through, for I was aware that NSA had been able to cover up its own culpability by keeping investigators, committees, and commissions away from the truth."""

I have no idea if the Russian or Chinese successfully “decrypted” them – the use of this specific word tells me it’s probably more complex than that – but giving how long these documents have been in the wild, it wouldn’t be especially surprising. In fact, the NSA most likely assumed their main enemies would end up getting hold of them the very moment Snowden start talking out of Hong Kong. Assuming otherwise would have been strange giving the total value of the information and the resources these two actors would be willing to spend to get their hands on it.  Greenwald offended reaction is also weird, especially for a guy who have masterfully managed the slow but steady release of the Snowden files over the last few years. He above anyone else should have learned to be prudent regarding over-reaction to vague articles like the Sunday Times one. What if additional information ends up being published next week?

The only good news in all this is that several of our big spy services like CIA and NSA don’t rely on outside agencies for security clearances. They do their own background investigations, while ninety percent of the Federal government relies on OPM. But that’s cold comfort since the CIA uses other federal agencies as cover so often.   So, we have it confirmed that there was not a direct breach of CIA personnel files but with all the State and DOD employees being compromised it would not take much work to cross-reference foreign postings and figure out who the official covers are.

Also worth noting that this announcement occurred literally straight after a UK Government commissioned report (PDF) into terrorism legislation raised a lot of criticisms (""Undemocratic, unneccessary, intolerable..."") that the Home Secretary is immediately attempting to obfuscate and ignore.  Also, Snowden, who formerly trained the CIA's operatives in OpSec and InfoSec, has explicitly stated he did not leak CIA documents because ""they would hurt people"" - which is not true of the NSA documents which have been released as they could not contain agents names.  I'm saying this claim is utter bullshit.  We need intelligence services, people, but Christ - we need to use our intelligence too.

The cybersecurity intelligence includes domains that have to do with the security of digital constituents and information in an organizational unit. This could be a government office, a private corporation or a military installation.  Its tasks share a lot in common with rest of the digital security community and can be generally divided into :   analysis of the current security trends in terms of   publicly released security vulnerabilities (e.g. SecurityFocus, National Vulnerability Database (NVD)) public research (e.g. UC Berkeley Security, DEFCON, CCC) computer/network security software and hardware (e.g. firewalls, operating systems, anti-malware solutions, anti-spam, IDS) ongoing worldwide cyberattack monitoring and analysis (e.g. IPViking) underground/blackhat/inhouse security trends  computer security   security breach mitigation in terms of the software and the physical access to the machine malware analysis security analysis and auditing of the software of interest security analysis and auditing of the hardware platforms running the systems of interest design and implementation of security systems (at least in terms of providing of the real-world data and feedback)  network security   physical and digital security breach mitigation post-breach containment and damage control network traffic analysis (e.g. protocol analysis, monitoring suspicious traffic) enforcement of role-based access control  infrastructure and environment security (other than computer networks) (non-exclusive, could be only marginal)   enforcing the security regarding the (smart) power grid, wireless networks (EM radiation), passive eavesdropping, etc.  general digital assets security (e.g. removable storage security, mobile phones, hardware tokens, hardware dongles) social engineering (non-exclusive, could be only marginal)   informing employees/customers about the techniques and consequences in case of a breach enforcing proper discipline and protocols on how to handle different scenarios developing and testing of social engineering techniques  information processing   information gathering, storage, analysis and understanding in regards to the cybersecurity development of information gathering methods, e.g. automated chatbots that pursue the target to reveal information, social media campaigns, other means of data extraction studying long-term trends in the domains of interest and creating strategies to prevent future attacks from being successful    The tasks during a typical day depend on the particular domain. For example a malware analyst would get a sample of a previously unknown malware and start analyzing it. He would run the malware in a sandboxed environment and collect information about its runtime behaviour. Then he/she would analyze the disassembled code and do a partial reconstruction of the original code, dividing the code into individual components, e.g. payload, exploit, information gathering, detection avoidance, encryption, network communication etc. Depending on the data collected during this analysis further steps would be taken, such as trying to communicate with the C&C server pretending to be a legitimate infected client and figuring out the size of the infection in rest the world. Preferably a patch for the vulnerabilities would be developed and the malware control center would be shut down by the appropriate authorities.  In case of anti-malware vendors, after a successful operation, someone would often write a report about this process and publish it for others to spread the knowledge.

Then they took that remark, put it in the context of her more reasonable worries about chemical weapons, and made it appear that Australian intelligence thinks it's probable they'll make a dirty nuclear bomb. That's why there's so much irrelevant stuff in the article. It's shaping the mental associations the reader will make, so they don't notice Bishop herself never directly claimed a nuclear dirty bomb was a worry, that she only was quoted as saying ISIS has taken territories with hospitals that have access to some (slightly) radioactive materials."

He criticizes Snowden for not working within the system to change the system, then laments that too few people are willing to risk anything to stand up for what is right. My feeling is that the people in the system KNOW the costs of not toeing the line and are extremely afraid of any consequences being out of proportion to their whistle-blowing actions.

Here's a good paper on the subject  The US has to do something significant, but not show all it's hands at once. There doesn't have to be any damage done, but the US has to show it is capable of doing damage. The problem with this though, which you alluded to, is the possibility of starting a cyber war. The NSA could shut down China's internet for a day, flex it's muscles a bit. But China could come back and just shut down massive power grids in the US for a day (which they supposedly have the ability to do, says former NSA director). You can see how that could escalate pretty quickly."

The Saudis have recognised that they have trouble policing the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, when it is estimated that millions of dollars are raised for militants who send agents into the oil-rich kingdom under the cover of Muslim pilgrims.  The Saudi interior ministry co-operated when terrorist funding was brought to its attention, but remained ""almost completely dependent on the CIA to provide analytic support and direction for its counterterrorism operations"", said a cable from the US embassy in Riyadh. ""As such, our success against terrorist financing in the kingdom remains directly tied to our ability to provide actionable intelligence to our Saudi counterparts.""

The committee called for further investigations and the Saudi government again called for its release.  Senator Graham later noted that ""this material was developed by the joint inquiry"" and was ""not classified information that was made available to Congress by the executive.""  Some leaked information from CIA and FBI documents alleged that there was “incontrovertible evidence” that Saudi government officials, including from the Saudi embassy in Washington and consulate in Los Angeles, gave the hijackers both financial and logistical aid.

Categories of censorship include ""subversive communication"", ""materials harmful to minors"", and ""pornography and nudity"". Internet censorship has been expressed by the shutting down of anti-conscription and gay and lesbian websites,   the arrest of activists from North Korea-sympathetic parties. Censors particularly target anonymous forums; South Koreans who publish content on the Internet had been required by law to verify their identity with their citizen identity number during 2005 to 2012. The most common form of censorship at present involves ordering internet service providers to block the IP address of disfavored websites. A government agency announced the planning of new systems of pre-censorship of controversial material in the future.

In March 1963 Profumo denied any impropriety in a personal statement  to the House of Commons, but was forced to admit the truth a few weeks later. He resigned from the government and from Parliament. The repercussions of the affair severely damaged Macmillan's self-confidence, and he resigned as prime minister on health grounds in October 1963. His Conservative Party was marked by the scandal, which may have contributed to its defeat by Labour in the 1964 general election.

Intelligence,367zgb,Odwolda,2,Sun May 17 16:18:55 2015 UTC,"Of course it is, regardless of whether the filmmaker intended it to be. The original source material they had access to was incredibly lop-sided. That said, I think the issue of ""selling torture"" is an interesting one. There are two different issues: Does torture produce intelligence and is it ethical. Some people conflate the two issues into a single one, often hoping to end the debate by relying on the idea that ""it doesn't work, anyway.""   That's not really something that's got a lot of supporting documentation, though. Torture has obviously produced results, and can be effective to extract specific information (example: what's the password on your laptop?). When people have an ethical or moral problem with torture, they should make that argument. It will be much stronger in making their case.  The film was trying to sell a whole mythos and narrative, one part of which includes torture. I think it's interesting that the other more likely narrative (that a $25 million bounty shakes the right branches) isn't good film fodder. I'd be much more interested in a film about the inside of the ISI than an attempt at making a version of Homeland somehow based on actual events.  Edit: Meant to add the point ""when people have an ethical..."""
Intelligence,367zgb,drew3000,3,Sun May 17 19:12:08 2015 UTC,I think people take an unbalanced view of how the CIA operates in regards to torture. The CIA recommended prosecution for many cases of abuses in regards to deployed US troops and policed their own in a similar fashion. Egregious torture was not a CIA policy for their personnel as far as I can tell. If anything the CIA was trying to police the war effort for the administration to maintain high ethical standards. What may have happened in an edge case like long term CIA boxing of detainees is exceedingly unlikely to have been sanctioned. Individual crimes do not make CIA policy.

In terms of this case and the specific film on the case, the CIA was the agency, but whenever the subject of torture comes up, people often make the link to the agency, when often it's not the one doing it at all. Still, people fighting for their moral reasoning should steer clear of effectiveness, because one has nothing to do with the other. It's an argument based on morality vs. one based on efficacy."

Intelligence,367zgb,Hamilton5M,7,Sun May 17 05:11:25 2015 UTC,"How so? Maya is likely representative of the efforts of a number of CIA intelligence officers, but from what I have read there was a very passionate CIA targeting officer who led the effort and pushed against the CIA bureaucracy. I believe the movie showed the exhaustive, boring, and mundane aspects of working in intelligence quite well.   During the raid itself, the SEALs talked a lot more than they do during real raids. Hand signals and gestures are used to enforce noise discipline. But that would have made for a poor 30 minutes or so of a movie and moviegoers probably wouldn't have understood, much like how movies have noise in space.  But this wasn't a ""John Wayne"" movie by any means. The SEALs and other operators who participated in that raid probably did at least one every night for several weeks. The Abbotabad raid wasn't even the only raid in Af/Pak that occurred that night. A dozen other raids occurred by SEALs and other special operations forces. From what I have read, other than the talking during the raid, the SEALs were represented quite well. What may seem to you as John Wayne, I see cold, calculated, and highly talented professionals working together to achieve success. That's pretty much the antithesis of John Wayne. Would John Wayne ever ask about sources of intelligence?  What I would have liked to have seen however is the raid practice demonstration that occurred before Obama made the decision to use the SEALs instead of a drone.  The SEALs planned for weeks, maybe months in anticipation of the raid. McRaven planned the raid, and the demonstration combined with McRaven's confidence was the reason why the raid was approved. Yet he had a very marginal role in the movie."

Intelligence,367ajt,eightbic,10,Sat May 16 23:33:17 2015 UTC,"Hello, first, let me give you a quick rundown of my background and experience, I just got out of the Air Force this past fall after doing 8 years in the intelligence field. For the sake of OPSEC and such I can't and won't go into specifics but I got a chance to work both SIGINT and IMINT/GEOINT by cross training AFSCs. I do not have a degree (stupid, stupid, stupid) and I went in out of HS with no real work experience.  1.Based on the information about me that I’ve given you, which branch and MOS would you recommend? It doesn't necessarily have to be one of the three I mentioned above. Based on your desire to work ""outside the wire"" I would say Army, but during my time with the AF I got the opportunity to go out on plenty of ops by snagging special duty assignments and being selected for special deployments with units that were looking for augmentees.  2.Which MOSs allow for most time “outside the wire”? I know that in many respects this is a desk job, but I’d like to know which ones minimize the “desk job” aspect. Almost all of the MOSs and AFSCs regarding intelligence will be 99%-99.9% desk work. Unless you get into collections, even HUMINT will be report writing most of the time. SIGINT will almost always by desk work or sitting at a rack, but all of the opportunities I have had to go outside the wire have been SIGINT involved. Caveat to that, you will most likely need to snag one of those special duties or Gucci augmentee deployments though.   3.Once my contract is up, what would my options be? State Dept, FBI, CIA, counter-intel, grad school? Depending on what you were involved in there are countless alphabet agencies that will hire you after you get out to work all over the country. Many of my friends came back to work at the same units/bases they separated from as civilian contractors!  4.What is the difference between officer and enlisted in terms of actual day-to-day? I want to be out in the field talking to people, getting dirty, and using my skills. I’m under the impression that officers are the ones directing the people who are doing the dirty work, not out in the field themselves. Biased ex-NCO here, but enlisted is the way to go for you! Most officers will be in the rear with the gear making schedules, planning ops or working the radio during ops.    5.How does the Army actually work structurally? What I mean by this is so I sign my contract, get shipped off to basic, then begin AIT, then DLI, then what? Is the path I take up to me, or am I following a set program? I don't know too much about the Army, but from my understanding the initial process is pretty much the same across the board. You will sign your contract with the recruiter, go to MEPS for processing, go to basic, then AIT/tech school. From there you will be farmed out to your unit. I went to DLI straight after basic (studies Urdu there) and from there I went on to my unit. You will be following a set program. One thing about the military is there is not a whole lot, if any, choice in where you go and when. It's part of the adventure though!    6.What is the culture in the military like? In basic, I’m expecting to be surrounded by a bunch of younger kids who are very unlike me, but once I specialize in MI, what can I expect from the people there? Again, not Army but basic will be lots of yelling and fucking up and PT, and AIT/tech school will be less yelling and PT but about the same amount of people fucking up and acting like idiots. When you get done training things relax, nobody will really get in your face unless you fuck up and it will be more like a regular job but with a uniform. From my experience the Army is big on customs and courtesies and the stereotypical military image, where us AF guys tend to be on a first name basis with most people under the SNCO tier.   7.What should I look out for when signing my contract? The recruiter seems trustworthy enough, but he’s a salesman, and I’m naturally wary of salesmen. Am I eligible for any signing bonuses (high ASVAB, college education, languages spoken)? Don't sign a goddamn thing until you read everything and understand it completely. No matter what anybody tells you the recruiter WILL lie to you to make his numbers. signing bonuses are based on MOS/AFSC and how undermanned the career field is. If you mention an interest in or proficiency with a foreign language you better believe there going to try to get you to DLI and you are almost guaranteed to be sitting on a rack or transcribing reports. Don't give up hope completely, Monterey is very nice and there are always those special duties/deployments I mentioned.   8.Anything else I might have missed and should know? If you are looking for blood, guts, sex and danger your best bet is to go infantry, then go to SF selection and try to get into the Rangers/Army Special Forces, and if you are so inclined there are other spooky units that will not be named that conduct intelligence operations who farm from the more traditional SF units. I urge caution though, that shit is not all it is cracked up to be and it will get old FAST unless your one of those special guys who truly love it. Like I said, most of intel is paperwork (or if you get into IMINT/GEOINT, looking at pics and video) but you can scratch that itch if you do good work for your unit and pick up those Gucci taskings. Whatever you choose do what is right for you! Good luck!  One more thing...your SF-86 is going to be a bitch because of your foreign relatives and extensive travel outside the US, have fun with that!  Edit: I learned how to bold"
Intelligence,367ajt,hurrikaneDITKA,3,Sun May 17 00:37:01 2015 UTC,"I used to be military intel, so here's my take:  1) you'll more than likely be placed as a linguist as they are continuously understaffed.   2) linguists that speak Farsi will have no problem working outside the wire, if thats what you want.  3) all those options, plus NSA, will be available to you after 4+ years working with a clearance  4) yea, thats pretty spot on. Officers are more for big picture planing and supervision than nitty gritty in intel.  5) i was air force, but i worked and drank a ton with the army. you seem to have a good handle on the training. if you do well enough on your language test you MIGHT be able to skip DLI and go straight to MOS training (systems, SOPs, etc)  6) MI is a bit older, but still plenty young. linguists are generally older.  7) I dont know dick about army contracts. i do know that training, however long it may be, is generally NOT part of your contracted time, especially MI where training time is particularly long (6 months - 2 years) Linguists usually get a pretty nice signing bonus.  8) army MI is more fun (parties more) than the other services. MI is the nerds of the military, and other guys in the military wont be as accepting of you (if they havent worked with MI in the field, because we do work out there, and people are appreciative then)  Edit : for what it's worth, I was essentially a 35N and I loved it."

Intelligence,367ajt,streakin_rican_88,3,Sun May 17 06:18:14 2015 UTC,"as /u/hurrikaneDITKA stated:   Unless you get into collections, even HUMINT will be report writing most of the time.   You will usually spend MUCH more time writing reports about what you collected than the time you spent collecting in any intel field.  Understand that we are conducting a drawdown and the military has few current ""combat"" operations, so most jobs you would get (regardless of intel MOS) are going to be in garrison environments where there is more busy work and training than actual collection/analysis.   However, might I suggest looking into 35S?  In my experience, they are a small group and tend to have the most experience actually doing intel work.  The downside is that they are a strategic position that is mainly a deskjob, but the Army is also trying to put them into small teams to collect signals intelligence in forward areas (they often went on every patrol with the infantry).    HUMINT (35M) tends to require talking to locals, and so they often get picked for patrols as well.  These two jobs are the only ones I saw going outside the wire regularly.  Your post asks a lot of questions. This answers the heart of it. I would suggest you do your own research on the rest (military culture, bonuses, etc.). There are plenty of resources available."

Basically I'm aircrew onboard reconnaissance aircraft and collect SIGINT and transcribe in real-time. Or at least I would if I actually ever did my real job. I was given highly specialized aircrew and intel training, and while I do a decent amount of transcribing, I very rarely fly.  Don't let that turn you off from military intel though. We linguists work back to back with the NSA; most 1N3's (ground linguists) end up stationed at Fort Meade. If I wanted I could be at an NSA desk within a week of my contract ending. The other 3-letter's will take you but require a bit of convincing. If you want my honest opinion, because you're going into this as a prospective intelligence professional first, and not a prospective Airman or Soldier first, go Air Force. The other branches require a certain amount of ""buying into"" their culture, and while we're still military, the AF just conducts itself in a different manner. I've had Army guys tell me that we should call ourselves a corporation instead of a military branch. As far as commissioning goes, do it. It will delay your ship date a bunch, as you need to go in front of several boards to determine fitness for duty (it's quite competitive these days), but your quality of life will just be so much higher and you'll be taken more seriously once you leave the military. I came in enlisted with a degree and regret it regularly.  As far as the other stuff goes, the DLI will make you learn another language, doesn't matter if you're native Farsi. A buddy of mine was native Urdu, tested 3/3/3 in it and they made him learn MSA. I don't know about the officer side (you probably won't get anything special, but you'll make a higher salary), but enlisting will give you advanced rank to E-3, a linguist signing bonus (~$11,000, half when you graduate, half over your enlistment), language pay, flight pay for 1A8's, non-taxable deployment pay if you deploy, etc. We make pretty good money.  I know that was a lot, but just take these key things from it: - Officer will get you into a lot of doors. - Go linguist, no matter what branch. - You can go fed easy as long as you don't fuck up. - Don't forget this is still the military, prepare to get roasted in Basic, no matter the branch. Too many pampered Guard guys come through trying to get money to finish their Master's degree or some shit and can't finish Basic cuz they hyperventilate whenever a TI talks to them.

Intelligence,367ajt,DiscipleOfDrone,2,Sun May 17 00:53:23 2015 UTC,"Former 35D (Army All Source Into Officer) here. Keep in mind that in the military the vast majority of Intel collection and analysis is tactical. I.e. hope going to be analyzing where enemy units will be on a battlefield and spend a lot of time analyzing ""fake"" battles in exercises. There aren't a lot of strategic jobs (they exist but odds are you won't get one, especially in your first term). I had a lot of Soldiers in my time that ate always upset that they weren't doing ""rewarding"" real world work but just endless tactical exercises. I just point it out to you since you mentioned job satisfaction. Most Intel guys in the military don't write about political leaders, don't go do any sort of collecting outside combat operations, and often when not deployed find themselves doing additional duties that don't have anything to do with even tactical intel...let alone the Jack Ryan stuff they think they're going to do.   That said I did get to do some strategic Intel in my time so it's possible. And while tactical Intel in garrison is pretty boring, when deployed is the most rewarding job cause if you're good everyone wants your opinion. Just be realistic about what military Intel is and isn't going in, and keep in mind deployment pace isn't what it was several years ago and be prepared to spend time in garrison.

In the Army, there's always the chance that you'll end up in a bullshit MICO in a tactical unit doing nothing but counting down the hours until your ETS date. Do not fall for the high-speed propaganda they put in those recruitment videos. I know 35Ms who have actually never done their job except in training. I know linguists who spent years learning a language only to end up mowing grass and cleaning toilets only to be laughed at when they ask for language maintenance training. And trust me, it's even worse if you have a degree and worked in ""the real world"" prior to your enlistment. Because unless you're at a super chill strategic MI unit, you will not necessarily be surrounded by the ""MI professionals"" that you hold in such high esteem. You will become very, very jaded.   BUT everyone I know in Air Force MI loves it. When I ask my AF friends if they're reenlisting, they never hesitate to say yes. So that is my advice to you. AIR FORCE.

The broad unity of the country behind the agency’s activities was a strategic asset; the loss of collection was likely to be tactical and temporary; and sacrificing a strategic asset for tactical advantage was as foolish in politics as it is in military operations.”   Which is exactly what has happened.

You see this from IS in Syria, to the Farq guerrillas in Colombia, to the Tamil Tigers in Sri Lanka. Civilian hostage taking is a major source of income for these groups.

I don't have hard evidence one way or the other about the effectiveness of the strategy vs one similar to what the French do, for example.   Being willing to do prisoner of war exchanges is a different transaction all together, as codified by multiple international treaties. Not that terrorist groups adhere to such thing, but if the world at large sees a distinction between the two, maybe you should as well. Usually, American soldiers are taken injured and isolated, and the willingness to exchange them is what prevents them from just being killed on the spot.  And notice that I've never said I agree or disagree with either policy. I think the FBI ensuring that contacts on the other side being legitimate actors, and advising families to raise private funds, is them assisting families in the only way they can. However, my point stands that having a non-negotiation strategy in place only has a point if it's credible. Any credibility that our non-negotiation strategy had left, which it relied upon, is now gone as this is splashed all over the WSJ.   I'd also rather give money than convicted prisoners, although... If you have any hard sources about any returned suspected AQ members' activity post-exchange, I'd love to read it."
Intelligence,34f4ie,silverence,2,Fri May 1 01:10:19 2015 UTC,"I'll respond to your last comment first:  I don't have any hard sources.  But if they were captured in the first place, you think they'll just suddenly stop?  If you're looking for sources, it'll probably be classified information from terrorist tracking teams.  I want to clarify that I am not against prisoner of war exchanges, so I don't know where you got that from when you implied ""the world at large [...] maybe you should as well.""  I still believe this non-negotiation strategy is a PR tool.  Once captures become public, it's important for us to look tough.  If it was all done clandestinely, we would have zero problems negotiating.  Take for example all the bribes we pay to warlords.  It buys influence but also protection.  Are we really going to argue semantics between a bribe and a ransom?  They're both rackets.  The truth is we pay people off all the time.  It's not a secret."
Intelligence,34f4ie,iloveapplejuice,1 point,Fri May 1 01:33:05 2015 UTC,"The part about the rest of the world, was about recognizing the difference between a pow exchange and paying ransom. But yeah I certainly agree with what you've said, but exposing the US' willingness to pay for hostages only undermines the policy of stated non negotiation. It doesn't help anyone, prevent any kidnappings, and in fact might marginally increase them. My whole point is that the decision to publish is all negative, no positives, that's it."
Intelligence,34f4ie,silverence,2,Fri May 1 01:50:40 2015 UTC,"I think we just have to agree to disagree here.  I believe there should be a reversal of that policy.  Take this hypothetical.  Let's say they capture an American Red Cross worker.  They go through their list of demands.    Unfortunately for them, in this scenario, we do not hold any of their cadre in lockup, thus no chance of prisoner exchange.  Their only demand is money, but because we have a publicly stated policy of no negotiation, they decide to forgo all of that and just start beheading for propaganda videos.  That's why I think it's important to let everyone know, even irrational actors, of the possible options available.  Having options is never a negative.  As to address incentives, there is always a benefit for them to kidnap, money or not.  If we refuse to give them the money, they'll just find another group willing to pay for that hostage.  The prisoner can be trafficked for money at any rate.  I rather we deal with the kidnappers directly instead of risking the chance handing the victims off to a more dangerous group, a group that might not care about exchanges and just want a beheading video."
Intelligence,34f4ie,iloveapplejuice,1 point,Fri May 1 03:01:14 2015 UTC,"I don't personally disagree with any of that. In my own opinion, I likely lean more towards believing that a stated policy of being willing to negotiation is better in the long run. I'm playing devil's advocate for the non-negotiation policy to highlight why it's in place, and how this piece undermines it. I also think that your hypothetical scenario here is an excellent one to illustrate the problems with a non-negotiation policy.  Again, to be sure we're on the same page, the discrepancy of value here isn't the difference of asking for money or captives in exchange. The discrepancy between the two situations is whether a soldier or civilians are taken as hostages. That discrepancy also influences who hostage takers can expect to pay the ransom. Civilians taken have their families asked for ransom, as happens in Columbia, Mexico, Syria, Iraq, Sri Lanka etc, etc. When soldiers are taken, hostage takers demand ransom directly from the American government, whether it be money or prisoners. Please understand the point I'm trying to get at here: The difference between POW exchanges, and ransom payment, that the Obama administation has pointed to as justification for the exchange that returned bergdahl, does actually exist. There is an important distinction between Bergdahl, and say, Daniel Pearl.   But back to your comment. Consider this scenario: A cartel in Juarez is scoping out high wealth targets for kidnapping and ransom extraction. They know wealthy targets have body guards. Their options are a number of wealthy businessmen from a multitude of countries. In making a risk/reward assessment, they know that the American represents an equal risk, as he's just as well protected as the others, but their chances of getting the ransom is less since the American government itself won't pay it, but the family of the person might. The French businessman however, they know they'll get a ransom for, as the French government itself has a reputation for paying for the ransom of it's citizens. As a result, they avoid taking the American. That's the whole point of the non-negotiation policy. It's about more than just the situation in the Middle East. Again, notice that I'm not advocating this approach, I'm just pointing out that there are also scenario's the highlight the reasoning behind the policy as it stands.  Now that this article is out, however, everyone knows that the American government is involved in ransom payments. As much as the other, entirely uncivil, guy shouts it, even if it's understood by hostage taking groups that they'll get a ransom for their American hostages, now that they know the American government is directly involved and supporting paying those ransoms, suddenly theirs no disincentive at all to taking American hostages. This won't affect POW taking, as as you said, they do that as much as possible already, but it MAY increase the frequency of American civilians being taken, especially by less organized groups, outside of the ME.   And the article does that for no benefit. THAT'S my point. No one is better off, only worse, if the reasoning behind the non-negotiation policy is sound. And if it's not sound, nothing has changed for the better or for the worse. That's what I mean when I say the publishing this article can only have negative ramifications."
Intelligence,34f4ie,silverence,1 point,Fri May 1 15:26:00 2015 UTC,"Here's where I disagree with your cartel scenario.  For high wealth individuals, publicly financed ransom payments runs contrary to high payouts.  For the businessman worth say, 50M, the money paid by families/companies will be higher than what the government offers.  Per how government works, they will always try to low ball the bid, it is tax money after all.  It will not sit well with a democratically elected government if the government offer is equal to or greater than a private offer.    By having the government facilitate a negotiation, a government that is less influenced by emotions/family ties, will lower the amount of ransom paid.  The family can always pay back the government with less than what they could have originally offered the kidnappers.    As for disincentives, let's say we're kidnappers.  For the Frenchman, if their policy is that the government takes the lead in negotiating, I know that government offer is going to be slim.  For the American, the government is hands off, but the family is directly involved.  I know I can play on those emotions to get a larger check.  I think what you're trying to say is that Frenchmen are an easier score. However, if both have the same security, is there really a difference in which one you kidnap?    In the end, it's the size of the bank account that matters if security is the same.  The only disincentive is to be NOT rich, but the rich ALWAYS pay.  They always pay because they can afford to.  If you can find a rich American that is patriotic enough to say WE WILL NEVER PAY, maybe that would work.  But for the rich, why would they do that?  They can pay and be free.  They have no incentive to stay in danger.  Plus, the fact that there is ransom insurance nowadays, further guarantees that I will get paid as a kidnapper, regardless of government policy."

I asked you for an example of the state department shelling out money for wealthy businessman hostages, as opposed to average, non privileged citizens, exactly as you claimed.

I also never said I agree with the policy, just that this article undermines it.   And oh, in your other whining, bullshit comment, you were wrong about all countries ""saying the same thing."" Different countries have different expressed policies about their willingness to pay ransoms. This leads to different hostage taking and returning rate from country to country. France, for example, has let it be known they do negotiate and pay ransoms, and as a result, see both more kidnappings occur to its diaspora, but them returned home more often.

If you knew the first thing about the organizational structure of terrorist organizations, you'd know that making the assumption that all members operate with the same information set is absolutely false. For example, maybe there's some radicalized kid in America who thought that the policy of non-negotiation with hostage takers was hard and fast. Now, thanks to this article, he knows that it's not, and that taking a hostage is a viable strategy to strike at who he sees as the enemy. Maybe it's some poor guys in some favela in South America somewhere who now think taking a American hostage will be a good source of quick cash because America does negotiate. Who knows?

Intelligence,31r440,Arviragus,6,Tue Apr 7 16:22:26 2015 UTC,"Here's a copy/paste for you, if you don't feel like registering.   In the age of iris scans and facial recognition software, biometrics experts like to point out: The eyes don’t lie. And that has made tradecraft all the more difficult for U.S. spies.  After billions of dollars of investment — largely by the U.S. government — the routine collection and analysis of fingerprints, iris scans, and facial images are helping to ferret out terrorists and immigration fraudsters all over the world. But it has also made it harder for undercover agents to remain anonymous.  Gone are the days of entering a country with a false passport and wearing a wig and a mustache to hide your true identity. Once an iris scan is on record, it becomes nearly impossible to evade detection.  “In the 21st century, you can’t do any of that because of biometrics,” said retired Army Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, the former director of the Defense Intelligence Agency.  On top of that, ever-present closed-circuit TV surveillance and Internet-tracking tools combine to make life even more dangerous for undercover agents. As such, the erosion of anonymity is forcing the U.S. intelligence community to rethink how it does business.  “You have to take many more security measures to be able to prepare someone to operate in an environment in which you can no longer physically hide,” Flynn said in a recent interview with Foreign Policy.  A senior Defense Department official said the policies have changed decisions about who can travel where — and how often. “It limits your movement,” said the official, who was not authorized to be named in discussing tradecraft and spoke on condition of anonymity.  At the CIA, the concerns have prompted a new era of cyber-espionage to compensate for the emerging limits on clandestine operations.  “Our ability to carry out our responsibilities for human intelligence and national security responsibilities has become more challenging,” CIA Director John Brennan said in March in announcing a major internal reorganization of the agency. It includes the creation of the Directorate of Digital Innovation, and in a memo to staff, Brennan called on the CIA to “embrace and leverage the digital revolution.”  Brennan didn’t specifically mention the impact of biometrics on covert travel, but experts say it is one of the drivers behind this organizational change.  The CIA declined to comment for this story.  California Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, applauded Brennan’s new approach to the “digital domain.”  “Technology at times is a double-edged sword,” Schiff said in an email to FP. “On the one hand, advances like those in the field of biometrics make our ability to identify and track bad and dangerous actors much better.”  “On the other hand,” Schiff wrote, “these same technologies have the potential to help others track and identify us.”  Today, even criminal and terrorist organizations are using biometric systems to track their own members, Flynn said.  When it comes to counterterrorism and border security, collecting biometric data has become commonplace across the world. That wasn’t the case before the 9/11 terrorist attacks, when border agents didn’t bother with biometrics, said Terry Hartmann, vice president for security solutions and industry applications at Unisys, an information technology company.  “And now routinely, all countries are collecting as a minimum facial images of people crossing the border,” Hartmann said. “Many countries are collecting fingerprints as well. Some are collecting iris scans.”  During the war in Iraq and still in Afghanistan, the U.S. military collected biometric information from millions of people, from suspected insurgents to people applying to work on U.S. bases to everyday citizens. By lifting latent fingerprints off unexploded and sometimes even exploded handmade bombs, the military created a database of suspected insurgents and extremists in hopes of apprehending them at checkpoints and border crossings.  The United States also is collecting biometrics from Syrian rebels whom U.S. troops are training to fight the Islamic State, according to U.S. Central Command. The rebels’ information is being used in preliminary background checks and could be stored for future reference as well, should they ever be needed in terrorism investigations.  “All of the things that make it difficult to keep your identity from being disclosed also make it that much easier for us to discover others,” said Roger Mason, who served as assistant director of national intelligence for systems and resource analyses before joining Noblis, a nonprofit science and technology organization.  Among the FBI, the Defense Department, and the Department of Homeland Security, billions of dollars have been spent on biometric research and acquiring new biometric technology over the last several years.  ABI Research, a market intelligence firm, estimates that overall revenues for the global biometrics market will hit $13.8 billion this year. Recent terrorist attacks in Europe and elsewhere are expected to drive that spending even higher.  James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said biometric data collection is “irresistible to security agencies.”  Countries are realizing that “if you have a database of known terrorists and you have the ability to collect on a big population, you’re going to find people that you would otherwise not have found,” he said.  The influx of money has led to major advances in the field.  Facial recognition technology has vastly improved, with analysts now able to match images that are less than perfect. And with computer power increasing, the speed of analysis is much faster.  “Irises have gone from being a curiosity to being a mainstream biometric,” Hartmann said.  Another part of the field that is quickly growing is the collection and analysis of DNA swabs, which can come from the inside of one’s cheek, a hair follicle, or even a discarded cigarette. Because DNA matches take hours to develop, it currently is not a viable biometric for fast-moving border security checks.  DNA is used in law enforcement, and the Defense Department has collected samples on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan. And, Hartmann predicted, it won’t be too long before DNA technology catches up and can be more widely used.  “It’s a lot faster than it was 10 years ago,” Hartmann said. “It took days to weeks to get a result. Now, we’re talking hours. In 10 years’ time, we’ll be talking minutes.”  While the technology has been advancing rapidly, there have only been a few rare glimpses into how biometrics collection is changing the world of clandestine operations.  In December, WikiLeaks released a secret CIA document from 2012 that gave advice to U.S. government undercover operatives traveling in and out of the European Union. It specifically describes how biometric data is collected and used, and it shows that as Europe expands its collection and introduces more-sophisticated systems, the risk to U.S. individuals traveling undercover has increased.  But the best-known example of the new spy world is the 2010 assassination of Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, a leader of the Palestinian militant group Hamas. His killing was considered a fiasco for the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad because its spies’ covers were completely blown — thanks to biometrics and surveillance technology.  The Israeli agents made a handful of mistakes throughout the mission. But crucial to their exposure was new border security and surveillance technology.  Investigators ultimately identified 27 Israeli agents involved in the killing by piecing together photographs inside fraudulent passports, immigration records, credit card receipts, and high-resolution closed-circuit TV footage inside the airport and various hotels.  The Mossad agents had forged passports by copying the authentic ones of dual Israeli citizens from the United Kingdom, Ireland, France, Germany, and Australia, provoking widespread anger from those countries. In retaliation, Britain expelled a senior Mossad official at the Israeli Embassy in London.  As DNA and other biometric collection and analysis become more routine and more sophisticated, officials and experts said it is only going to become more dangerous for spies to operate.  “There is no simple solution to this,” Flynn said, “so we’re going to have to be far more creative than, I think, what we’re looking at right now.”"

So, when I was in the Army a bunch of us were assigned to augment the base security forces after 9/11. I had a guy ran the interior gate (much higher security than base perimeter gates) I was working at. I was perfectly authorized to shoot, I didn't. I didn't feel like this was a threat, there was also civilians in the line of fire. I called for help over the radio and our QRF (Quick reactionary forces) showed up not 30 seconds later.  The QRF guys ordered him out of the car, he froze up when 3 guys with MP5's were screaming at him. They were completely authorized to shoot him also, they didn't.  It turns out he was an authorized worker at the facility, he had tint on his passenger and driver side windows, he claims he showed his ID and I waved him through. I was nearly fucked by this because he almost died. Fortunately there was about a 100 cameras that caught this incident that clearly showed he didn't identify himself."

I'm aware of a situation that happened at a Guard/Reserve portion of Portland International Airport. In 2005 some civilian continually came to the gate to demand access to the military base (looking for evidence of UFOs/Illuminati, et al), and ironically they could have gotten on if only they gave a plausibly legitimate excuse like ""sight seeing"", ""meeting a friend for lunch"" or ""going to the BX"" and offered a driver's license or piece of ID. Apparently this person was so wacko they claimed that a FOIA request granted them access to the base and would argue with the guards until local PD showed up. This happened multiple times, the person was banned from coming within x-number of feet of the base by local police, kept violating the lawful prohibition and was eventually arrested. Upon getting out of jail they drove straight through the security checkpoint, the guards recognized the car and driver and decided not to shoot and instead pursue. The base is super small, but they ended up at the maintenance operations building I worked at, ran inside and hid into a closet. Person ended up in federal prison over it. How in the fuck did they think it was going to go down?  Guards apparently had a whole watch list of civilians who have caused trouble in the past. Nuts."

I actually loved it and seriously considered doing base police force when I got out.  We had a guy that would protest the base 18 hours a day, 6 days a week. It got really hot once and we went to check on him. He ended up in heat stroke and we called emergency services. He was treated at the base hospital and transfered to a civilian hospital.  He wasn't charged a cent by the military.  He never protested again. We kind of missed him."

I also saw the video footage after.  We had a Mexican family pull up to the gate. Not a single one spoke English. The officer attempted to tell them to turn around and go back. The dad blew the gate, he basically floored it and took off. At this point ever security officer was authorized to fire, no one did. It was announced over the radio that the car had 6-8 children. This doesn't make you immune from being shot to death, terrorists have a history of using children. They were stopped by the military police with guns drawn, one spoke Spanish thankfully, they complied with orders.  If they had attempted to run from MP's also, he was ordered to shoot (carefully) by the watch commander. Thankfully they complied.  It turns out they thought the military base was an amusement park. When they ""ran the gate"" they were looking for good parking.  They were stopped near a building that had the same level of security as where nuclear weapons are stored."

They had plenty to be nervous about and might have been on drugs of some sort.   Maybe her high heel got her to mix up the accelerator and brake pedals in the stolen car."

Intelligence,309hqr,pondiki,2,Wed Mar 25 15:53:43 2015 UTC,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation should expand its intelligence work at home as well as its global reach to meet the threats of transnational criminals and lone wolf terrorists, according to a report issued Wednesday examining how the agency has changed since the 2001 terror attacks.  “The FBI has made strides in the past decade but needs to accelerate its implementation of reforms to complete its transformation into a threat-based, intelligence-driven organization. The increasingly complex and dangerous threat environment it faces will require no less,’’ the 127-page report from the FBI 9/11 Review Commission concluded.  FBI Director James Comey welcomed the suggestions, saying: “Overwhelmingly, I agree with their findings and recommendations.”  The three-person commission was tasked with evaluating the progress of the agency since intelligence gaps leading up to the Sept. 11 attacks led to widespread changes at the FBI and other U.S. agencies. The commission was created by Congress in 2014 to study how well the FBI has adopted the recommendations of the commission that studied the 2001 terror attacks.  The commissioners—former attorney general Ed Meese, former 9/11 commission member Tim Roemer, and Georgetown professor Bruce Hoffman, who studies terrorism—said the FBI is poised to become a ""global intelligence and investigative agency,’’ but to do so needs to excel at criminal investigations, counterintelligence, intelligence collection and analysis, and technological know-how.  After the 2001 attacks, one of the chief findings of the 9/11 commission was that the FBI and other intelligence agencies like the Central Intelligence Agency didn't sufficiently share information that could have uncovered the plot and prevented the attack.  As a result, sweeping changes were made inside government agencies, but Wednesday’s report found the FBI still ""is not sufficiently integrated’’ into the network of U.S. intelligence agencies.  The commission recommended a greater emphasis be placed on the development of intelligence analysts within the bureau, and stronger relationships with other intelligence agencies.  The report adds to a debate that has continued inside the FBI over the proper balance between its traditional crime-fighting function and the pressing demands of preventing terrorism, from groups overseas and individuals inside the U.S. inspired by those groups.  “These threats are not just knocking at the door, they are in the room,’’ Mr. Roemer said.  The commission also found that the U.S. government’s broader mission to counter radicalization at home can’t be addressed solely by the FBI as a law enforcement organization. The panel recommended the social and prevention efforts for countering violent extremism should be transferred from the FBI to the Department of Homeland Security.  The panel also examined whether FBI agents had missed or mishandled key evidence in the years since the Sept. 11 attacks that would have helped them apprehend other alleged conspirators in the plot. Mr. Comey said that while the 9/11 case is still open, there is no credible evidence of additional plotters that haven't already been charged or identified.  While generally positive, the report wasn't all complimentary. It found the work of joint terrorism task forces in sniffing out terror plotters before they strike was ""uneven,’’ and suggested the reasons for that ranged from a lack of internal information sharing and a lack of analytical work on the clues available before an attack.  In computer hacking investigations, the commission found the FBI to be challenged ""by the continued lack of clarity regarding the respective roles and responsibilities of the various government actors. In particular, the FBI is challenged to rebuild constructive partnerships with the private sector and in the general public’’ in the wake of revelations about government surveillance by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden.

I think Russia has no plans to turn Snowden over on any condition. Snowden is too great of an asset to them, he will be worked over to reveal everything possible about the CIA and NSA. More or less Snowden has become a FSB employee while being threatened with harm if he holds anything back. Snowden is probably tasked with scheming on ways to exploit any new intelligence vulnerabilities the FSB discovers about the USA or its allies. More or less Snowden is an US traitor that has become a full fledged Russian intelligence agent. Snowden commits new acts of treason each day in my view. I often wonder how many US citizens will die due to treason Snowden committed. The fallout can occur in very complex ways that are hard to predict. In my view it is without question Snowden should be executed for many counts of high treason.   I believe that the FSB hopes that by keeping the NSA leaking story in the news Snowden will become more of an idol for some Americans and for people in other nations. I think the FSB thinks this will help them recruit foreign spies and traitors. More or less Snowden is just not a Russian spy, he is a major spy recruitment tool for Russia.

The idea to use ""cyberwarfare"" in a manner augmenting current doctrine is just asking to fail. Military doctrine is based on the physical realities and resources that a group can bring to bear. With the ability to almost endlessly proxy, magnify, and conceal attacks, it requires new combat doctrine. That's why there's USCYBERCOM.(1) What? A military unit tasked with cyberwarfare?

Intelligence,2ytafj,meximantx,10,Thu Mar 12 20:29:47 2015 UTC,"KIEV, Ukraine—When Moscow-backed separatists were starting their war in east Ukraine last spring, the country’s main security agency sent a covert team to capture a rebel leader.  But word of the classified mission leaked out, and three Ukrainian operatives were themselves captured and thrown into a separatist jail. Rebels stripped them to their underwear, bound their wrists and blindfolded them, then paraded them in front of Russian journalists.  Ukrainian counterintelligence officials now believe their capture was an inside job, the result of a betrayal by a high-ranking employee of the Security Service of Ukraine.  The agency, roughly equivalent to the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and known by its Ukrainian acronym SBU, has battled corruption, internal intrigue and treason for years. Ukrainian officials said in interviews that by the time the war began last year, the SBU was riddled with Russian spies, sympathizers and turncoats, and many of its files had been stolen and taken to Russia.  The SBU’s troubles come amid broader tension in Ukraine about whether the country should ally itself with Moscow or the West. As Russian and Western powers drift toward a new Cold War over the crisis, U.S. officials have grown concerned about special operations, spycraft, propaganda and other actions they claim Moscow has undertaken in Ukraine and could attempt elsewhere."

Intelligence,2ysdq5,LawJusticeOrder,-2,Thu Mar 12 19:31:53 2015 UTC,"Oh no, Americans and Israelis don't want a nuclear Iran, how strange and unreasonable! Especially since they can make reactors with 5% uranium, but currently have tons of 20% uranium (getting to 20% is the hardest part, getting from 20% to 90% is easier). They have meddled with IAEA access to their facilities. And 2 different facilities were hidden and exposed later and everyone was like ""shit how did we not notice that there?""   They already developed long-range ballistic missiles. The IAEA already acknowledged that before 2003 they were researching miniaturization of warheads. Sounds like such a peaceful nuclear program alright. Let's give them the benefit of the doubt.  Theocratic jihadist regimes like Iran run by the Ayatollah, a big fan of Qutb (Qutbism is the ideology behind AQ). They are simply the Shi'ite version of AQ/ISIS with their own state since 1979. The regime believes mainly in the afterlife and fund terrorists worldwide and they should not have access to any nuclear weapons or even enrichment facilities or ballistic missiles. The supreme leader even translated a book by Qutb and spread it in Iran. There will be apologists who try to argue that the theocracy in Iran is not interested in dominating by religious means or that they are kinda ""democratic"" but these are people who haven't studied much Iranian history and the current regimes' ideology.  Part of the reason why people want to deal/negotiate with Iran, because they realize if they don't try this hopeless method, that the alternative is war. But this is the same mentality Neville Chamberlain had when he tried hard to negotiate with Hitler.  Sometimes war is the only alternative or you can fire up your sanctions to max-level and hope they will change their ways. But if all those sanctions don't change their behavior completely into an unconditional surrender of their nuclear ambitions, then you cannot HOPE that offering them some things will make them change. If they are willing to allow their people to suffer under sanctions just to disobey your laws, then your sanctions are not working and you are not effective enforcer of international law. You cannot pretend that war is an unthinkable option. When international laws are violated, sanctions are used, when sanctions don't work, then the international community must band together and impose their will otherwise the laws are just ""suggestions"" instead of ""laws"". Some people would rather deal with a Nuclear-state of Iran in the future, rather than go to war with Iran, but the consequences and risks of a terrorist-sponsoring state using such technology and then pinning the blame on terrorists? That is an unacceptable risk.   The people who lose in intelligence and wars, are people who underestimate the enemy or trust them unnecessarily (or they pretend they are just like themselves, out looking for jobs and material-gains)."

Then, let's remember that Generals from all throughout history of been dumbasses who slept with foreign prostitutes and spilled the beans. At least the US has been intelligent enough to hook our generals up with hot lieutenants, and in this case, a Major in the Army Reserves. In my opinion, Jill Kelley was a threat to national security if she started fucking Petreaus, Broadwell just acted to stop that like a jealous asshole, but was really doing the proper thing. You can't stop military Generals from being horny fucking old men who will fuck any 20- or 30-something willing. At least she wasn't a Philippines prostitute hired by the Chinese government.   Really, I still continue to see this whole Petraeus affair as a political take down, likely the Obama administration after Petraeus was offered the presidential seat by Fox New's Roger Ailes.

I saw this routinely while I was in. Go to any chow hall or Officer's Club in the military and look at who the 50 year old Chief or Colonel is having lunch with. It isn't by accident that this happens, the military was once overt about bring around the US Women's Air Corps so that our soldiers weren't fucking foreign prostitutes and spilling national security secrets. This isn't a new problem, I'm sure some Roman General has his downfall this way too.  I bet that 80% of the US military generals have had an affair with another service member during their career.

She was a Major in the US Army Reserves who probably held Top Secret clearance.  If anything, the only problem is that she wasn't pushed through the bureaucratic chain to get specific authorization for the information. However, almost certainly Broadwell could have been authorized to view everything in those books if she sought authorization to do so.   So, we have here a procedure violation.

An intelligence service may give him a wide berth in exchange for him doing the odd beneficial return.  And in B, I'm not saying him being like a CIA asset. But he could have the Iranian Intelligence service, or Pakistan's ISI, etc, using their resources to protect him.  C) he could be fictitious. Not in a tinfoil conspiracy way, but he could just be a front man, the ""media face"" if you will, and the various agencies know this so they know if he's taken out he'll just be replaced.

Backgrounder here:   JTF-CND to JTF-CNO to JTF-GNO to Cybercom  Here's some research RAND analysts did for them sixteen years ago (!) in 1999 that's still worth reading:   Securing U.S. Defense Information Infrastructure: A Proposed Approach   by Robert H Anderson, Phillip M Feldman, Scott Gerwehr   It is widely believed, and increasingly documented, that the United States is vulnerable to various types of information warfare attacks. Threats range from nuisance attacks by hackers to those potentially putting national security at risk. The latter might include attacks on essential U.S. information systems in a major regional crisis or theater war. The purpose might be to deter (or coerce) a U.S. intervention, to degrade U.S. power projection capabilities, to punish the United States or its allies, or to undermine the support of the American public for the conflict. Critical command-and-control and intelligence systems are designed to be robust and secure under attack. However, their survivability cannot be taken for granted, and they depend on a diverse, primarily civilian and commercial, information infrastructure (consisting of the Internet and the public telephone network, among other elements). As the diversity and potential seriousness of threats to the U.S. information infrastructure have become apparent, national-security planners and analysts have begun to think of ways to counter such threats — to increase the infrastructure's availability for essential functions."

Iran has the fourth largest oil reserves and the world's largest natural gas reserves in the world.    Iran is an energy superpower.  Iran is in a constant battle to use its energy resources more effectively in the face of subsidization and the need for technological advances in energy exploration and production. Energy wastage in Iran amounts to six or seven billion dollars (2008). The energy consumption in the country is extraordinarily higher than international standards. Iran recycles 28 percent of its used oil and gas whereas the figure for certain countries stands at 60 percent.  Iran paid $84 billion in subsidies for oil, gas and electricity in 2008.  Iran is one of the most energy-intensive countries of the world, with per capita energy consumption 15 times that of Japan and 10 times that of European Union. Also due to huge energy subsidies, Iran is one of the most energy inefficient countries of the world, with the energy intensity three times higher than global average and 2.5 times the middle eastern average.  Half of the country’s energy is wasted in domestic sector, 3.4 of which is wasted through the vehicles moving with single person and 2/3 parts of power plants' energy are also wasted.   Iran is one of the leading members of OPEC (Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) and the Organization of Gas Exporting Countries (ch is well belGECF). Iran received $47 billion in oil export revenues, which accounts for about 50% of state revenues.  Natural gas and oil consumption both account for about half of Iran’s domestic energy consumption. With its heavy dependence on oil and gas revenues Iran continues to explore for new sources of natural gas and oil. Recently Iran has focused its energy sector on the exploration of the South Pars offshore natural gas fields in the Persian Gulf.     Image i - Iran holds 10% of the world's proven oil reserves and 15% of its gas. It is OPEC's second largest exporter and the world's fourth oil producer.

Encryption would prevent average hackers from getting at firmware though.  Manufacturers could encrypt and sign firmware updates though.

Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1 (2010), 130 S.Ct. 2705, was a case decided in June 2010 by the United States Supreme Court regarding the USA PATRIOT Act's prohibition on providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations (18 U.S.C. § 2339B). The case, petitioned by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder,  represents the only time in U.S. First Amendment jurisprudence that a restriction on political speech has passed the Brandenburg v. Ohio test.   The Supreme Court ruled against the Humanitarian Law Project, which sought to help the Kurdistan Workers’ Party in Turkey and Sri Lanka's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam learn how to peacefully resolve conflicts.  It concluded that Congress had intended to prevent aid to such groups, even if for the purpose of facilitating peace negotiations or United Nations processes, because that assistance did fit the law's definition of material aid as “training”, “expert advice or assistance”, “service”, and “personnel”. The finding was based on the principle that any assistance could help to ""legitimate"" the terrorist organization, and free up its resources for terrorist activities.  The court noted that the proposed fractions of the Humanitarian Law Project were general and ""entirely hypothetical"", implying that a post-enforcement challenge to the application of the ""material support"" provisions is not foreclosed.

The administration apparently believes that Israel and the U.S. now have a conflict of interests regarding the Iranian issue, the source said. While U.S. President Barack Obama wants to make every effort to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, Netanyahu is doing everything he can to block one.  One of the main reasons for the decision to limit the information the U.S. shares with Israel on the nuclear talks is a fear of leaks. The Americans fear that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will make use of the information given to Israel for his own political needs, and will try to undermine the talks between Iran and the big powers.   Also in WP: http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/wp/2015/02/16/a-perfect-storm-brews-in-the-middle-east/   In recent weeks the Americans felt that information given to Israel about the talks – like, for example, the new proposal Iran had submitted regarding the centrifuges it would be allowed to retain – is finding its way to the Israeli media as part of what looks like an effort by Netanyahu to scuttle the talks."

Aiding an enemy police state like Russia was traitorous. Eighteen year old soldiers jump on grenades for the nation, what Snowden did was cowardly. Snowden is going to be worked over by the FSB to reveal all sorts of NSA vulnerabilities in order to remain in Russia too. What is a Constitutional for the NSA to do and not do in terms of eavesdropping, is more a matter for courts to decide. I will say though that the public won't much care about these issues if there is a WMD attack on the homeland that could have been prevented by the NSA.

Aiding an enemy police state like Russia was traitorous.   He aided the American people in learning about constitutional violations that their government was committing against them. If the government's crimes make them look bad in the eyes of other nations, it only has itself to blame, not a whistleblower.   Eighteen year old soldiers jump on grenades for the nation, what Snowden did was cowardly.   You can't be a true scottsman unless you do x   Snowden is going to be worked over by the FSB to reveal all sorts of NSA vulnerabilities in order to remain in Russia too.   What vulnerabilities do you think he remembers that could be exploited? And are you saying it's more unethical for the Russians to interrogate him than it would be for the Americans to give him the Manning treatment and torture him for exposing their unconstitutional surveillance?   What is a Constitutional for the NSA to do and not do in terms of eavesdropping, is more a matter for courts to decide.    And Snowden et al. revealed that these matters are systematically prevented from rising into the courts by a secretive, extralegal system that starts with the NSA and ends with the rubber-stamp FISA court. Tell me, why do you place so much faith in the court system when the head of the NSA can perjure himself in front of Congress and face no legal ramifications whatsoever? What miracle of intervention do you expect to happen that would suddenly see the NSA on trial in front of the Supreme Court?   I will say though that the public won't much care about these issues if there is a WMD attack on the homeland that could have been prevented by the NSA.   You are either misinformed or deliberately misconstruing the nature of the material that was leaked. The NSA is spying on US citizens in violation of the US constitution, as well as using illegal parallel constructions, which denies citizens their constitutional rights to face their accusers in court. They are often doing this in collaboration with the IRS and sometimes even for sexual reasons (LOVEINT). To claim that you need to read every US citizen's personal, private emails, IMs, web requests, phone calls, metadata, SSL traffic, etc. for the purposes of stopping terrorists from setting off WMDs is a tactic of the most disingenuous and simplistic kind.    I think the key really here is having strong oversight and the proper checks and balances in place.    These checks and balances don't come from Unicorn farts and pixie dust. Even the unprecedented, leaked information that the US public now has access to is barely sufficient to even get legislators talking about this issue."

You should be willing to die for the country at the drop of a hat. If Snowden truly believed what he was doing was the right thing to protect the nation then why flee like a coward? I am not getting into a discussion of classified vulnerabilities, I will say anything almost could be of value to a foreign intelligence service. Snowden would have been in the civilian justice system, not the military justice system like Manning.  I am not a lawyer so it is hard to for me to comment on the legal issues. I know that the US Justice Department could bring these issues before Courts. I know there have been citizen filed class action cases as well.  The way the NSA works is they collect a lot of data and then use programs to search for things that might relate to terrorism or involve national security. Very little even gets looked at by live human eyes. Nor does the NSA have the resources to track down every little thing. I am aware the NSA was doing some really stupid things like trashing people's dates. There just was just not enough oversight and some NSA agents I guess had the wrong attitude. People are imperfect and institutions imperfect. What the exact frequency of misconduct was I am unsure.  There are many problems in the US and in the world.

As they saw it, their best hope was to salvage the situation. Offering a compromise, they tried to convince CIA lawyers to insert language that would retain a partial protection for journalists. Under the compromise, in order to obtain a conviction prosecutors would have to prove that journalists had ‘intent to harm’ intelligence operations. Theoretically, this would have barred prosecution of reporters who were just doing their job. In exchange, Halperin and Berman agreed to switch their position: the ACLU would refrain from opposing the Intelligence Identities Protection Act.

Al-Qaida, ISIS/ISIL, Boko Haram, Ansar al-Shariah, Jund al-Khilafan, al-Nusra are all  ideological offshoots of Wahabbi mission Saudi Arabia started in 50's.  Salafism/Wahabbism is in minority everywhere (including Saudi Arabia) but tens of billions of oil money has been spreading it over the world for several decades. Its not traditional Islam, It's 300 year old crazy reform movement that was confined into  Saudi Arabia until Saudis became rich.   For example, how do Chechen fighters turn up in the rank of ISIS? Saudi Wahabbi clerics entered dirt poor Chechnya with their pockets full of money and people turned to them for ideological support. After that Al-Queda and other groups gained followers. For sources, see for example The Chechen Wars by Evangelista http://www.brookings.edu/research/books/2002/chechenwars"

Within Wahabbism I imagine there are less radical offshoots. I think it would be more constructive to talk to the House of Saud about how they could promote those and help combat terrorism at the same time.  In a way ideology is a resource people compete over. Tailoring the right PSYOPS campaign can pay off many fold as a counterterrorism resource. Power and wealth in the house of Saud is roughly concentrated and distributed over two thousand people, they have had to make concessions to the Wahhabists just to stay in power. The Middle East is a very difficult region to manage. It is important to set realistic expectations and use a range of approaches to address specific problems."

People with traits of these disorders lack empathy for others, are impulsive, and have grandiose self-images. The purpose is to show examples of how these traits were manifested in the twenty subjects and find behaviors that predisposed them towards betrayal. Using the case study approach and available open source materials, it was found that all of the spies exhibited numerous traits of both disorders to varying degrees. Many spies engaged in espionage in part because their self-image of themselves was rarely confirmed by others, leading to ego-bruising and a desire redress the damage through revenge. The results lead to the conclusion that those with a significant number of narcissistic or psychopathic traits are more prone to betrayals such as treason."

There might be more to it- but Russia's economy is sliding into the toilet. http://www.theweek.co.uk/business/oil-price/60838/oil-price-slide-drives-russia-to-junk-status  Addition from page 608 from the 2015 World Factbook: Russia is one of the world's leading manufacturers of oil and natural gas. Russia's reliance on commodity exports makes it vulnerable to boom and bust cycles that follow the volatile swings in global prices.   In late 2013, the Russian Economic Development Ministry reduced its growth forecast to only 2.5% per year. In 2014, following their military intervention in the Ukraine, prospects declined even further, with GDP possibly dropping to zero.  They're hurting, and hurting badly. Its in their own interest to put feelers out in the US economic sector, and especially those in a position to exert global influence."

Unless someone with knowledge of the covert program had a motive to punish Sterling."
