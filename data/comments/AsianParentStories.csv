No. Really. She's so absorbed into Christianity, that she is so blind to everything else in life; especially even taking the time to get to know her one and only child.   I have borderline personality disorder. I was born emotionally sensitive from the start (all babies are born with different types of temperaments and such), and my emotions were constantly invalidated growing up. However, I know that invalidating emotions is just an ""Asian thing"" which is sad. It's especially damaging towards a child who is already very sensitive to their surroundings. A lot of neglect and invalidation kind of caused me to stay stuck emotionally as a child. I mean, I'm 28 but emotionally I feel like I'm still 5? I didn't start improving myself until I learned what BPD even was. Now, I am so much more aware and I'm even in a healthy, validating, nurturing relationship.   I noticed that a lot of Asian parents (especially in the East) are very proud. They want to be the best and project their pride onto their kids, perhaps? I mean this is what I've observed from meeting so many Korean families during my lifetime.   You're also not supposed to really talk about emotions or express them I think because it supposedly shows weakness. It really is a cultural thing to hide behind a mask and be more passive within Asia. I PERSONALLY don't think it's healthy because you should definitely be able to talk about inner conflicts and all that with at least the people closest to you AND your family. When you can't even be real with your family, I mean...it feels kind of like a lie..."

AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,hatgineer,5,Mon Jul 20 18:02:50 2015 UTC,"I'm a little leery about diagnosing entire populations with narcissism, though. As far as the diagnosis goes I would say most Asian parents have several co-morbid disorders, if any. But I do think that they take dysfunctional culture and bring it into the home. Having witnessed business practices in S. Korea (and the way their criminal justice system works), they certainly behave destructively pretty much...everywhere (by my reckoning, anyway). And a lot of that has to do with completely different value systems too. For example, did you know that in S. Korea you can be arrested for slander and/or libel even if what you've said is 100% true? The only exception is a public service clause, which would allow you to inform certain public channels as a public service. This only makes sense if you understand that the culture values saving face greatly, and that value has been enshrined into law.   tl;dr: way more complicated than can be explained by population-wide narcissism.  And I really think that if we ran them through a dark triad test, a lot of them would score significantly higher in Machiavellianism than Narcissism.   Edit: Borderline Personality Disorder makes a lot of sense too, especially in Asian females. I'm certain there are crazy high rates of sexual abuse and assault in East Asia that just don't get reported or talked about, and BPD is often closely associated with cases of childhood sexual interference (to my knowledge)."
AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,hatgineer,7,Mon Jul 20 18:49:58 2015 UTC,"I'm a little leery about diagnosing entire populations with narcissism, though.   Remember when that Korean pilot screwd up the jet liner landing? The one where he had seniority over his co-pilots but less experience flying that particular model of jet liner? Remember when the experts analyzed the situation and found that he was indeed flying wrong but the co-pilots were hesitant to say it until it was too late, because the pilot had seniority?  Here's my dad's take of it: the pilot was flying fine, he would have landed fine on his own, the junior pilots were wrong to correct him. The pilot's only mistake was listening to his juniors to abandon the landing, he listened, he pulled up, causing the tail to hit the ground.  My dad is not a pilot. He is just some old guy. He thinks he has more expertise in the situation than GROUPS of actual experts hired to investigate the accident, simply because he has existed for longer.  So no, IF the evidence points to that diagnosis, then it is totally fine to make that diagnosis. That is what it means to stay unbiased."
AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,hatgineer,1 point,Tue Jul 21 00:23:31 2015 UTC,"I'm not against following the evidence - quite the contrary. However, once you start going into diagnosing entire populations the number of variables you have to consider jumps, and things get significantly more complicated. Your framework is also pretty important. Getting rubbish data is incredibly easy, especially if you want to see something.   As for your dad, I'm not seeing the scenario as an obvious case of narcissism. It seems more like a classic Dunning-Kreuger effect to me, which I find to be extremely common in all populations. I often have white people lecture me on what racism against East Asians looks like, after all, and I apparently I should just learn to take comments like, ""You speak really good English"" as compliments.   P.S. Thank you so much for schooling me on what it ""means to remain unbiased."""
AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,QuietBearDuck,2,Tue Jul 21 00:50:59 2015 UTC,"Haha yeah he has a really bad case of Dunning-Kreuger but this particular example is more than that. He's a senior himself you see, and as far as I can tell it is some kind of weird attempt to protect his ego. He would make the most contorted excuses against reality to make seniors look good.  I suppose that ties into your original topic. Maybe that's the cause of him thinking irrationally, but he has been verbally abusive to me and the rest of the family my entire life, it has happened for so long, that I would rather he stays chronically frustratingly wrong about everything and take it out on us via more verbal abuse (because I'm used to it), than to help him get the emotional closure that eluded him his entire life.  Perhaps things would have been different if he didn't use me as some kind of emotional punching bag, but that was outside of my power to change."

You say it is outside of your power to change, but assuming you are in the age of majority in your country you can certainly make a change.

AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,QuietBearDuck,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:17:28 2015 UTC,"Look, just because white people are racist doesn't excuse them and it doesn't mean his dad is not a narcissist. His dad is projecting himself into that situation with the pilots, nothing less. He thinks the senior pilot should have completely ignored his juniors because that's what he would have done, because he's invested in himself being the Authority on everything.   You can't just say it's the ""Dunning-Kreuger"" effect because that doesn't pick up on how certain people think they are competent at CERTAIN THINGS than others. It also depends on WHY they overestimate themselves. When you see where they overestimate themselves, you also see where they are fearful of being exposed (the degree of their narcissism).  I for example would not overestimate myself on matters that have to do with whoever is the authority in the situation, or whether the person I'm talking to is a different race than me. That's because I'm not as invested in being the authority (narcissism), or as invested in my white guilt (not white). I would be more likely to overestimate myself in stuff like research, programming or video games because I'm more emotionally invested in being good at them. Of course I'm working to not overestimate myself in these domains because I have self awareness and empathy, unlike those pepople."
AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,QuietBearDuck,2,Tue Jul 21 01:05:29 2015 UTC,"Uh, wow. Okay, looks like I do have to go there, so I will.   1) The racism example was meant to serve as a counter-example to illustrate my point. There is no actual connection between racist white people and his dad, at least not one that I know of, and in no way was I insinuating that racism should be excused. Perhaps you should reread that portion of my post.    2) In the case of the example that was given, there was not enough data to assume anything OTHER than an instance of the Dunning-Kreuger effect in action. The poster stated that his father had assumed he had more expertise than the experts, but such stupidity is actually incredibly common, and it is neither known nor confirmed that most of the people who commit such fallacies are narcissists. Hilariously, the push back here (starting from that first response post I had) is because I stated that I was ""leery"" - in other words, cautious, of handing out a blanket diagnosis on entire populations, which is considered sensible and good practice everywhere else. But apparently I have to be careful of my bias here.  3) The punchy nature of my rebuttal in the post above was in response to an obviously biased response (the poster had already made up his or her mind on a forum that at the time, had a grand total of four responses) that was trying to teach me about bias. I thought the snark would be funny, and quite frankly, I still find it funny. But I admit it wasn't in the nicest of ways (I never claimed to be the nicest person on the internets)."
AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,energizer_tortoise,1 point,Tue Jul 21 01:51:28 2015 UTC,"1) Ok, you probably didn't mean to excuse racism. But were you excusing the father? It looked to me you were, and you were making it look like white people should be also excused for their racism because it's just another Dunning-Kreuger effect.  2) Actually there is a ton of data. You're taking all the data out except for the part where someone assumed he had more competence than he actually had. You're discounting the person's background tendency to paint people like himself as the saviors of the world.   And when it comes to Asian culture at large, of course we can make blanket diagnoses of entire populations, because that's the very thing we are studying: entire populations.  Your use of the word ""blanket"" doesn't mean you get to weasel out of it. Either you make a ""blanket"" diagnosis, or you agree that the concept of Asian culture doesn't exist at all and is ineffective for predicting anything whatsoever.   edit: and blanket diagnoses aren't necessarily bad or discrimination or stereotyping or racism. For example, if I say the population of a certain group of people is, say, 1.5 million, that is a blanket fucking statement.  3) You come in here with a post that says you want to diagnose entire cultures and populations, and then in another comment say you are leery of doing so. Come. On. What did you expect?"
AsianParentStories,3dyxmo,harchickgirl1,1 point,Tue Jul 21 02:01:57 2015 UTC,"1) I was actually being very specific with my diction. I stated that it looked like an instance of Dunning-Kruegar effect, because it does. And DK effect doesn't excuse anything; it is a description of a relationship between two specific variables, competence and perceived competence. In other words, I don't see why you are applying value-judgements on an observed effect. I am not ""excusing"" anything, I am labelling the behaviour with what I believe is the correct descriptor.   And since you did not appear to understand the example, I will explain it to you:  The DK-effect is illustrated at the two points in the example: the instance when the white person tells the minority they know what it's like, and then in the instance when they become offended (implied by my wording) that the minority is offended by the compliment. They are too ignorant to understand that perhaps the minority is the expert in the experience of being a minority and identifying racist compliments. That's it. So you do see racism in the example, as well as the DK Effect. I will elucidate on the case of the Idiot Father in a latter point.   2) Where is the ton of data? If you are speaking of data from studies or sources outside of this subreddit, I obviously do not know about them. If you are talking about hatgineer's post, I believe I have already outlined the contents, but I will rehash it for you.    Here's my dad's take of it: the pilot was flying fine, he would have landed fine on his own, the junior pilots were wrong to correct him. The pilot's only mistake was listening to his juniors to abandon the landing, he listened, he pulled up, causing the tail to hit the ground.   My dad is not a pilot. He is just some old guy. He thinks he has more expertise in the situation than GROUPS of actual experts hired to investigate the accident, simply because he has existed for longer.  I'm not see a ""ton"" of data here. The relevant points are: a) the father has no actual expertise in the subject; b) the father assumes his expertise outweighs that of the actual experts that were hired; c) the poster speculates it is because the father believes his age gives him more expertise than education or related experience (implied).   d) YOU speculate that the father has established himself as the Authority on everything:   he's invested in himself being the Authority on everything.    You also assert that:    When you see where they overestimate themselves, you also see where they are fearful of being exposed (the degree of their narcissism).   At what point in the scenario described was fear of exposure illustrated? If the poster had gone on to state that the father verbally or physically lashed out at an objection from the poster, you would be correct. However no such instance was described - you are extrapolating quite a lot, and I suspect you are doing so from your own personal experiences, rather than the text of the post.   Also, there are a lot of analogous DK effect-in-action scenarios (pulled fresh from the web) I can use, just replacing idiot father in the same way as the poster in question. People generally do not jump to ""narcissists, all of them!"" in these examples:   a) anti-vaxxers claiming to know more about the causes of autism than actual doctors - even after Wakefield was stripped of his MD.  b) a Cancer patient opting strictly for treatment with the Gerstein therapy against the advice of their oncologists, to tragic results c) Homeopaths who went into Ebola-stricken Africa with the conviction they can use homeopathy to cure ebola  3) I am going to combine your last two paragraphs for point 2 with point 3, as they are much more organically matched.  a) You either did not fully read my original post, or you did not understand it. You claim in #3:   You come in here with a post that says you want to diagnose entire cultures and populations, and then in another comment say you are leery of doing so. Come. On. What did you expect?    This is a disingenuous straw man. I quote from my original post:   I'd be interested to see what you all have to say about possible underlying causes.    Underlying causes can be cultural, social, tied to SES, or because of psychopathology. Narcissism is a psychopathology/personality disorder explanation, one of many possible causes. There are also more psychopathologies in the DSM to choose from than narcissism.   And if reddit posts are to be believed it seems that these problems permeate an entire culture or cultures (it may be helpful to differentiate by country).    In my original post I acknowledge that the problem may be the entire swath of Asia or differentiated by region. I do not make an affirmative stance on either speculation, as I leave that open to the posters. So no, I did not want to ""diagnose entire cultures and populations"", because diagnoses by definition refers to pathology. My approach was much more open than that.   And of course I am leery. There are cultural differences between different EA countries, and I have no idea if they are relevant, or if they will tip the scales towards one cultural disposition or another. There is no inherent contradictions in any of my statements, though I can see you are doing your best to see some.   b) You want to talk weasel words? Fine.    Either you make a ""blanket"" diagnosis, or you agree that the concept of Asian culture doesn't exist at all and is ineffective for predicting anything whatsoever.   False dichotomy, disingenuous straw-man alert. I allowed allowance for differences in Asian cultures in my initial post. Cultures certainly have room for core similarities and differences across countries while still being distinct from Western ones - it's a matter of degree in traits as well as the way value systems are shuffled. So no, I do NOT have to choose between making a blanket diagnoses or ""agree"" that the concept of Asian culture doesn't exist. That's utter nonsense.   As for your edit:   There is a difference between a blanket diagnosis and a ""blanket fucking statement."" Because guess what, a diagnosis is not the same thing as a statement, and whereas you can make general statements (""blanket fucking statement""), a blanket diagnosis of a country is another kettle of fish. First of all, a diagnosis of an entire country assumes that a core characteristic of the country is a psychopathology. This is not only difficult to prove it can also be mired in various complications such as colonialist history from the diagnosing party to the diagnosed as well as the obvious political implications therein. So actually, it is entirely sensible to be ""leery"" of making a ""blanket diagnoses"", especially in the form of a ""blanket fucking statement.""   If you want to see the correct usage of narcissism as applied to entire populations, you should read corathus69's post. The term ""incidence of"" is very relevant.   4) Seriously, what the fuck is your problem? Do you just see trigger words everywhere and just not bother reading everything?  5) I just realized how much time I spent responding to this post. I'm going to go bang my head against a wall and then go do something more productive than arguing on the interwebs."

It's bizarre how they're so willing to believe a system of ""medicine"" that is akin to some sort of witchcraft (qi gong: totally not curing cancer since ever). And you're right of course, TCM is largely unregulated and it's difficult to control the dosage of any active ingredients (if any) with herbs anyway.  I've generally thrown out hundreds of dollars worth of TCM soup, which my mother generally forces on me (which I naturally refuse to drink). It always bothers me because I'm perfectly aware that it's my dad's money (which by extension becomes her money) and he just keeps his head down to avoid marital strife, but I keep hoping that letting her know that this all went into the trash will one day force her to admit shoving this crap at me is just a waste of money and she'll give up.

Even if they believe doctors to be evil pharma shills/greedy capitalist scum, they can simultaneously believe that the job is high-tier, stable, and respectable (in the eyes of society). All ingredients that make it highly desirable. The only time cognitive dissonance would factor into it is if they wanted their child to be honest as well, but to my experience this is never really an issue. In fact my parents called me an idiot for refusing to cheat my way into 4.0s.   tl;dr: no cognitive dissonance required if the desired end game is a high-tier, stable, respectable job. If that requires you to be an evil pharma shill, I think most Asian parents would be totes okay with it.   edit: Not that I'm defending the stupidity of it in any way at all."

In their eyes, a good alternative is becoming a lawyer, after all :P  And yes, I was meaning more of the latter situation - ""You should be a doctor and get rich and help people, etc"" while also saying, ""I don't trust western medicine!""...so apparently as a doctor you can help everyone else but Asians with your western medical knowledge?"
AsianParentStories,3dyox7,KnickersInAKnit,2,Mon Jul 20 19:10:43 2015 UTC,"I'm not entirely clear on what you mean - why wouldn't you help Asians too? I'm totally lost xD. I was in pre-med (or ""pre-med"" I should say) and anecdotally, I can tell you my Asian peers didn't give a shit about patients - they said they did during interviews because that was expected, but in private conversations they were much more interested in health care from a career perspective, because it was stable, paid well, and gave good social currency.   To clarify and expand on my own points, I do think that Asians believe doctors are knowledgeable, however there is an added caveat with Western doctors and Western medicine: the perception that the West is arrogant in its international/cultural  hegemony and disrespectful to the medical traditions of other countries. For example, when I explain (using Western scientific studies) that acupuncture, for example, has no more effect than placebo, my mother counters that ""science doesn't know everything"" and that I just don't understand ancient wisdom. This is only a rational standpoint for someone who doesn't actually understand how the scientific method works - it doesn't care how old your wisdom is, it just cares about testing things in a carefully controlled way so as to collect relevant data. To put it simply, they often acknowledge that cutting edge medical technology is good, but they also insist that Western science is arrogant and passes judgement on things it doesn't quite understand. It's the old, ""You can't prove it's wrong without a doubt!"" gambit.   I think Asians who understand scientific method more are less likely to buy into TCM, because as you've said, THEN they get massive cognitive dissonance. However, I have met educated Asians who still buy into woo, and that's just a testament to how good humans are at compartmentalizing and rationalizing away the irrational."

My best stab would be, maybe it has to do with their immigrant status? Being a TCM practitioner in the west isn't as respected as being a full out MD, after all, so I would assume that they would want the best possible job.

AsianParentStories,3dyox7,squishyfu,3,Mon Jul 20 17:55:08 2015 UTC,"I don't think that experience is particularly uncommon in medicine.  Generally when patients go for a holistic cure they throw everything PLUS the kitchen sink at it; it is then impossible to discern which cures (or any combination thereof) was giving the desired effect.   I'm not a doctor myself, but if I had to guess I would say that his improved lifestyle was probably what slowed the liver cirrhosis (the damaged tissues are still around, I'd guess). In cases where the condition is caused by lifestyle (i.e. alcohol abuse), the first obvious line of treatment is to change the life style. In cases where you have a chronic disease causing the cirrhosis (i.e. hep C) things get tougher.  I'm also shocked the doctor recommended he get a chunk of his liver sawed off. I thought they usually did transplants for severe cases.   tl;dr: probably the healthier eating and lifestyle adjustment to slow the deleterious effects and progress of liver cirrhosis."

So a lot of times, I question her question and tell her that she doesn't really need to know (just wants to know).  Example: she wanted to know more and more about an SO's grandmother, who the grandmother lived with, an AH-HA, if Grandmother doesn't live with SO's parents, then that means that Grandmother and SO's mom (the daughter-in-law) don't get along, do they?

Growing up, they've never really gone to my performances unless my older brother went, or unless they had to. They didn't want to go see any of my dance performances because they didn't want to spend money on tickets, or watch the other performances. They occasionally went to a few orchestra concerts, only because either my brother wanted to go or because he also played in the same orchestra as I did.   My parents also lead very mundane, flavorless lives. It consists of them just going to work, gardening, occasionally going to the store, and watching TV. We've never really had good relations growing up, so I shielded them out and also got the ""why don't you talk to us"" speech. The more I speak to my parents, the more annoyed I get because of them forcing their bigoted beliefs, thoughts and values on me.

AsianParentStories,3dmpim,burnitwithx,8,Fri Jul 17 14:57:47 2015 UTC,"I didn't understand that being beaten by your parents was ""abuse"" until I was much older. I was told that it was a way to discipline and that it was essentially my fault because if I behaved well + did well in school, there was no reason to get disciplined. Even as I got older, though the physical abuse stopped, I never held it against my parents because I wrote it off as a cultural thing.   I only have one younger sibling and we are both past the age of getting beaten. If I hypothetically had a second sibling that was currently getting beaten, I don't think I would have it in me to call CPS. I would instead take quasi guardianship and get him/her away from my father.   Though I was beaten on occasion growing up, I never felt unsafe. I was fearful of my parents mostly because I didn't want to disappoint them. I was never fearful of my physical safety."

The message it sends to a scared, shy, introverted, abused child who waited until she was 16 to report her father is that I'm overreacting, this is not a big deal, this is normal so I just never went to her after that. I'm sure she enjoyed that because it's less work for her. As an adult, I totally feel let down but there's nothing I can do about it.

I think Asian parents who physically abuse their children should be publicly shamed and humiliated, and then sent to the prison cell they deserve.  I think those who constantly undermine their children emotionally and verbally should have the children taken from such violent homes, and given to people who will man up to the adult responsibilities of raising a child.  Asian parents who indulge infantile hostility and aggression towards their own children are the scum of the earth.  There is no family cohesion to maintain.  Such parents have already violated the family cohesion, and have brought total shame upon their ancestors."
AsianParentStories,3dmpim,corathus59,2,Fri Jul 17 17:14:36 2015 UTC,"My parents ""hit/disciplined"" me as a child. They stopped once I was able to self govern my actions and all they needed to do was say something like: ""hey, not now okay? It's not appropriate to play in a store."" This was maybe when I was...10?   I have never had any desire to call CPS on my family. I didn't know it was a thing until...I dunno, call me sheltered but, maybe not until I was already a legal adult.  I personally feel that I turned out fine? I suppose the only thing I find different about myself from my peers is that (oh boy this next wording sounds really snobbish but I don't mean it to be) I feel like I have a higher behavioural standard? Not necessarily positive or negative, it's a bit of both. For example, I don't scream/shout at anything, which is fine, but this also extends to stuff like going WOOO at concerts, which displays some sort of obvious mental restraint, like I don't allow myself to have fun.  There is a fine and blurred line between using corporal punishment as discipline and actually beating the snot out of your kid. My parents mainly used it to ""get my attention"" rather than to smack me around. Sticking fingers/hands where they're not supposed to? Quick slap on the wrist and a verbal explanation as to why what I was doing was wrong. Said something extremely inappropriate? Light pinch on the cheek followed by a verbal explanation once again. General running around and acting inappropriately (i.e. running and playing in a store/restaurant) quick smack on the bottom followed by, yup, verbal explanation.  Kids are not dumb animals, giving them a calm, proper explanation will usually suffice. I am strongly against people who just slap/hit/punch/throttle their kid for any reason, especially if it results in the child becoming fearful of the parent rather than knowing that they were misbehaving.  There is also a fine line between verbal abuse and verbal discipline. This one is a lot more difficult to figure out because a calm explanation can result in shouting if one has an especially difficult child. I'm not an expert but I tend to see this in parents who have a disparity in the level of discipline they want to keep (one harsh parent, one lax parent), or if both parents assume their child should be born a self-checking adult and just yell at it all the time. Just shouting out: ""HEY DON'T DO THAT!"" Is very confusing for a child. Don't do what? Don't talk? Don't breathe? Don't play? Why not? Why not? My parents would always explain to me: ""Hey, bahamut285, I know you like to play, but this is a restaurant. We come to a restaurant to eat, not to play. We can go home and play later, okay?"" (Note: Our home had a designated ""Play room"". There was no playing outside the ""play room"" with the exception of going outside to play. All our toys would be there and we could play as long as we like as long as we had eaten and finished any schoolwork)  It's really difficult to get children to self report this kind of stuff, Asian or not. As ibby_be pointed out, most people (even abused adults) are more fearful of the abuser rather than showing concern for their physical safety.  Not to mention, different people draw the line at different places, so it would be difficult to discern false reports and real ones. I've seen ""Super moms"" (the ones who have what I call ""free range children"") swoop in on random families just to tell them off about disciplining their kid even in the tamest of manners. There ARE people out there who believe that you should not even be allowed to give your kid the stink eye, and just let their kids be ""free range"". I mean yeah okay I guess they grow up stress free and happy but at what cost? They grow up to be potentially lawless adults?  I personally believe there needs to be a balance between positive and negative reinforcement. Too much positive or too much negative reinforcement are BOTH detrimental to the development of a child."

After learning what emotional abuse was in grade school, I did briefly entertain the thought of contacting CPS for that. But even at that age I knew enough to know that I'd rather take my chances with my shitty parents than open the Pandora's box of a CPS investigation, sketchy foster placements, blowback from my parents, etc. The devil you know vs. the devil you don't and all that.

You owe them nothing.  Consider getting therapy to work through your guilty feelings. Also, it's your life. You don't want to look back with regret because you allowed your parents to guilt you into not trying new things. Who knows? You might become incredibly successful in the new field (if you care about impressing them that way)! Or you may find that you don't like it as much as you thought you did. Or you may fail at it.  And that's OK!  Life is for living and trying new things! What's the worst that could happen if you tell your parents, ""I'm going to go pursue X as a career because I think it's what I really want to do.""? They disown you? Yell at you? Try to guilt you? It's not the end of the world.  There's a saying that is used to encourage women and girls that I think can be applied to Asian-American/Canadian/Australian kids/adults struggling with emotional blackmail. Just change 'women' to 'person':  ""Well behaved women rarely make history.""  Pursue your interests. You're a grown man who's got a good head on his shoulders. Break free from your parents' expectations and start living your life on your own terms.  I wish you all the best! I know you can do it!"

First of all, let's be clear that a ""contract"" of this nature is completely unenforceable, as someone else said that you were a minor (forgive me, I'm studying for the BAR exam and will be taking it soon). For multiple reasons, what they said about you being indebted is SOLELY of an emotional nature and legally non-binding nature.  That being said, as I mentioned I was studying for the BAR exam, I've been going through something very similar. My parents, God bless their intentions, have been inducing extreme stress on me. The moment I graduated from law school, my Dad would call every day (then demand to video chat because he wanted to make sure I wasn't ill or gaining weight) and ask me for a full report as to what I did ALL DAY.  My number of practice exams were low, my MBE scores were not passing (and now, not high enough!). I was losing my mind. I found my future husband at this point, and eventually I broke down crying after they told me that I was throwing it all away for him.  My mom went so far as to say that they keep me on a leash and it's about THEM getting a return on their investment. My dad would never openly admit this, but he thinks it, trust me.   My parents paid for my education through college and law school because it was a ""gift"" (this will later haunt my mother). My parents LOVE to point out how many chances i have and would I really want to throw it all away on some loser guy with a poor, white trash family (all incredibly incorrect).   I told them enough was enough and if they keep doing this, I will always be distant from them. No more daily phone calls, no more chatting into the night, I am definitely not coming home to visit, and holidays will now be spent with ANYONE else (my siblings have already done this, to note). My parents panicked.  Now they are backing off, but they are already trying to strong arm into visiting me on Sunday. Thankfully my balls of steel boyfriend refuses to avoid them and said he'll stand by me as they come to ""raise my spirits.""  You have your source of income. You can live independently (if you don't already). You don't need to see them again. They can't say you owe them anything. They have no hold or power over you, financially. All they can do is emotionally blackmail and guilt you.   Maybe I am hardhearted, but I've had enough of it. I guess the line was crossed when I joked I was an indentured servant, and my parents being very educated, paused and said, ""Well, yeah basically.""  I'm out.  EDIT: Also, it's an interesting story as to HOW I wound up in law school.... jeez.... how strange.... Oh yeah, they told me to go to law school or I'll become nothing. That's how."

AsianParentStories,3dly5z,ranko357,2,Sun Jul 19 23:58:50 2015 UTC,"First off, very few to no Korean people in Korea get nose jobs to look like white people. If you've watched any plastic surgery segment on Korean PS (originating from Korea, or else you'll get that ""trying to look white"" bullshit), you would know that Koreans go to their surgeons saying that they want X celebrity's nose, or Y celebrity's lips. The goal is to look like a good-looking Korean person, not an average white person. You don't change your face to look less ""ethnic,"" you change your face to look more like a ""beautiful"" Korean person. Big eyes, double eyelids, tall noses, etc. all occur naturally within the Korean population without surgery. It's not as common as what you are stereotyping (slanty eyes, wide flat nose), but uncommon appearances are considered beautiful in many countries (how many Americans look like American celebrities, for example?).  I'm going to have to agree with /u/squishyfu in saying that this post seems quite Eurocentric. It's a little bit obnoxious to assume that other ethnicities (within their original countries) want to look like you or people who look like you. This question/debate often comes up when people talk about fashion models as well (""Oh why do they only pick black models who look white?"" as if having a narrow and tall nose is a white-specific feature) and anime character designs (ignoring that Japan uses different physical signifiers to show that someone is Caucasian).

Other examples of plain offensive cultural appropriation include those Youtube makeup tutorials on how to look Asian (they exist) and the obvious blackface and yellowface (because they didn't want to actually hire blacks or Asians for black and Asian roles). It's like our cultures are just fun disposable costumes for white people (and sometimes Asians) to try for a day or two and have fun with our foreign/wacky/funny looks.

AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,ekdp,1 point,Sun Jul 19 23:48:47 2015 UTC,"(I love that song to this day but Stacey Dash in that video irks me).... Sadly, this is the type of mentality that exists in our communities. Like the lighter skinned house slaves, some Asians who have more Western looking features are often held in higher regard (it's also worthy to note that colorism also exists amongst Asians but not quite to the extent of black people). I've heard some elder Asian people talk about how pretty Asians look when they have higher noses and paler skin, etc..  And not to mention how a lot of Asians take the whole, ""are you mixed [with white]?"" as a compliment... Or how some Asians are kind of fetishizing mixed Asians like people specifically wanting [white] mixed children. I put white in square brackets because ""mixed"" in the Asian community is assumed to be mixed with white as a lot of people are not quite accepting of black/Asian or Hispanic/Asian mixes despite openly accepting and embracing white/Asians. It's like if we mix with white, it'll be an easier assimilation (instead of working so hard only to still be inferior to whites) for our white passing children who will obviously receive more opportunities in this predominantly white society. And it's the same thing with marrying ""down"" with having kids mixed with non-white ethnicities. Many Asians (including my parents) believe that in order to truly make it in America, we must conform to white expectations as it is a white society. As for the vision of Asians in white-dominated societies such as the States, I'm not too sure if there's really a common vision. A lot of Asians are content with being the model minority and being that token Asian in groups of whites that make jokes aimed to belittle and slander minorities. A lot of Asians are content with working equally or even harder than whites and still receiving less and receiving little to no representation in media. The mentality of Asians being superior to darker (blacks, Hispanics, etc.) peoples, but we must keep looking up to and following the white man is still very existent amongst both older and current generations of Asians. I honestly don't buy into the model minority and inferiority to whites/superiority to other minorities complex bullshit so I don't completely understand how these Asians justify their thinking. Sorry for the not so great response but this has been a good discussion."
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,Work-After,6,Wed Jul 22 03:21:13 2015 UTC,"Hey girl, same exact situation here. Got a black boyfriend who would be ideal marriage material...IF he were white. IF he were asian. The racism disgusts me. My mom refused to meet him or hear anything of him and my dad doesn't know about him. It hurts most because I'm not the kind to just say ""fuck it"" and abandon my family to be with him - I want both but they clearly don't."

AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,baitaozi,4,Thu Jul 16 14:31:08 2015 UTC,"Not sure. Things are difficult because we've just moved to being in an LDR and though I've moved out, my mom will have to live with me for a few months (6 to be exact) and that'll put a big strain on us. For now I'm just dating him and pretending my parents don't exist as I'm not sure what will happen. If we marry, we marry and they'll have to accept it, but we could also break up so I don't want to go through the terrible fights for something that I may not even end up having."
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,ironforger51,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:33:00 2015 UTC,"Ah, I totally understand. Not to mention the ""I told you so""-commentary if you ended up marrying someone of the same ethnicity as you.  I am not Asian but I am of immigrant descent and we have had a couple of similar scenarios in my family, although not as bad."
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,ironforger51,3,Thu Jul 16 14:57:05 2015 UTC,"I went out with a black guy that was 7 years older than me...  My parents found out I slept with him and DESPITE both working at the CDC, said all black people have HIV/AIDS (???) and that my future was now completely ruined. They stalked me, interrogated my friends about him, asked them to spy on me....the list goes on forever but you get my point.  ....and this was after I had broken up with him for unrelated reasons....well over a year ago.   I guess I learned that racism runs deeper than intellect. There is no reasoning this. I don't know your age or what your situation is, but I can tell you that financial independence is the fastest way to get them to respect you. Just know that if you decide to stay with him after all, you be prepared to put your foot down and stand up for him."
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,aek82,1 point,Thu Jul 16 14:32:54 2015 UTC,"I'm still young and in school right now but my parents expect me to move out only after marriage because premarital sex is baaaaaad. (LOL) I have about 7k in savings but it's literally all getting eaten up by school loans. I love my boyfriend and we've been together for four years so it's not some ""phase"" that my parents believe it to be. I'm prepared to even cut them off if absolutely necessary if they keep standing for racist/extremist values and it's not just for my boyfriend. Even though I love my family, being raised by narcissists did not give me (and many other Asian kids) healthy upbringings and transitions in adulthood."
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,ironforger51,3,Fri Jul 17 02:09:48 2015 UTC,"I totally understand this. My cousin, unfortunately, has been brainwashed by this! She was 26 (I'm 4 yrs older than her) and hadn't had a single boyfriend in her life. We signed her up for match and there was this really awesome guy -- he was wildly intelligent, interesting, musical, and fit. The only problem was he was black. She actually told me that she refuses to meet him because, and I quote, ""I have standards, you know."" UGH."

She talked to him over facebook and liked his personality but refused to meet with him because she didn't want Asian and white guys to see that she was ""like that"". LOL these people honestly lack critical thinking and stay holding the Asian mindset from evolving."
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,Ratatum,0,Fri Jul 17 02:15:33 2015 UTC,"Wow, that sounds judgemental. There is nothing wrong with not wanting to go out with a certain group of people. It maybe racist, but it isn't evil. Affirmative action is racist, but it isn't evil. . For many people,  only dating within there own race or ethnic group is fine. There are many good reasons people do it.  Some people only want to date people of their same religion, some people want their kids to look like them, some people want their kids to look like their parents, some people want the bonds between their parents and kids to be deep and strong as possible.  Being in inter race or inter ethnic relationship, is usually not easy. Differences in looks and culture exist and are real.  Most people's close friends are within their ethnic group, why is that?  How many black girls are you close with compared to Asian girls? If you don't have many black girl friends, why not? Are you racist?"
AsianParentStories,3dgyjn,marrowisyummy,2,Sat Jul 18 06:34:41 2015 UTC,"Maybe someday your parents will become more supportive of your choices, but until then, it's none of your parents business who you choose to date or love."

AsianParentStories,3dffxt,confuzzleds,2,Wed Jul 15 21:38:06 2015 UTC,"This!! x100. My mom initially told me to never date anyone until I finish grad school and establish a career, because everyone knows dating is the recipe for academic failure. I don't want children so for me pushing marriage later doesn't matter much, but EVERY WOMAN SHOULD WANT TO BECOME A MOTHER RIGHT, so I humoured myself by asking her what exactly she is expecting from me. Having a decent career by at least 28 and starting to date for the first time at 28-30? When I told her it would take me a couple relationships to find The One, and by then it might be ""too late"" for me (30s), she replied by saying she and my father were each other's firsts and that I don't need to try a couple relationships to get married..."

As I mentioned in my post, they tried to raised me with a parenting style they termed ""non-American."" It's always ""it's okay for them to do that because they're white Americans, but you are not allowed because you're Asian,"" regardless of whether it's smoking, drinking, premarital sex, or the ability to cook. Apparently I should learn to cook not because I need to be a functioning adult, but because I'm an Asian woman."
AsianParentStories,3dffxt,NikolaiXander,1 point,Wed Jul 15 21:51:26 2015 UTC,Thats ok. they can consider themself whatever they want but there is no way u will meet another american person raised the exact same 'non-american' way that u were raised. so the likelihood of finding a man who is non-american like u is slim.
AsianParentStories,3dffxt,ibby_be,3,Wed Jul 15 21:57:37 2015 UTC,"They are probably upset because you are not 'marrying up'. Your parents came from a tough place, and worked hard to position you to get to a better place than even they were able to reach. Imagine that you did that for your kid, and then see that she is dating an older, bum-looking, pot-smoking guy who does manual labor for not a lot of money? It's easy to understand your point of view because you are new to dating, but by your very own description it sounds like you could be with someone better. It's a normal thing to experiment with different types of people as you grow older, though! Eventually you will find that you have a strong preference for this type, or that one.   Good luck!"

AsianParentStories,3dbknh,elephantmoose,21,Wed Jul 15 00:37:59 2015 UTC,"He is extremely spoilt. Had everything handed to him when he was a kid. My mom would give him $10/day for pocket money (by comparison, I got $0.80), but he would still make either her or my grandpa bring him out for lunch. He never had to take a school bus as my grandpa and eventually mom (who was retired) had time to drive him around. We had a maid growing up and he had her tie his shoelaces as he had his breakfast until he was 12.   He lived 30 minutes from campus and had his own car (which my grandfather gave him $30,000 to buy), yet he still wanted to live in the dorms and make my parents pay an extra $15,000 per year for 4 years for food, lodging and a parking spot. When he hated living with 40+ guys, he made my parents rent him a condo, and eventually buy him a condo downtown. And yet he still brought laundry back every weekend which my dad did for him and folded his clothes. And my mom would make his favorite foods which he feasted on 'cos she only saw him every weekend. I lived in a garage for $50/week when I was in college and finished in 3 years 'cos I felt guilty for making my parents spend so much money.  He should not have made it to university because his high school grades were so bad. My parents moved to Canada, so that he could attend a private school and qualify for University. His spelling and grammar were so bad he couldn't write a paper to save his life. The only reason he made it through was because my parents guilt tripped me into writing his papers for him (""please help him, we don't want to pay another $3000 for him to repeat the class""). I did it begrudgingly because I was unemployed at that time but I told them it would not help him in the real world.   Since graduating from university 4 years ago he has lived with my aunt (who spoils him a ton too, as she is single with no kids) who cleans his room, cooks, and does his laundry for him. He has not held a job for more than a year and is currently unemployed, making money giving Uber rides.  My mom particularly spoils him because by the time she was retired, me and my sister had left for college overseas, my dad was also working overseas, and he was the only one with her - even though he was out all the time and she barely saw him. She also loves him because having him ""saved"" her status in the family since she finally had a boy, and gave my grandparents their first grandson after 2 girls (aka disappointments). I don't have a relationship with him as he was 6 when I left home."
AsianParentStories,3dbknh,baitaozi,8,Wed Jul 15 01:23:47 2015 UTC,I hope they paid you to write his papers. They don't want to spend $3000 for the class? You should have asked for a couple hundred per paper. You're saving them money!
