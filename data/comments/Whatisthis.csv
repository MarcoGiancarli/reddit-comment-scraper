I'm not familiar with the brands or the type as I'm more familiar with the process of making them.  Definitely awesome. Worth anything? I'd guess yes....but I honestly have no idea.
Whatisthis,3e4qkb,trackerbymoonlight,2,Wed Jul 22 01:26:30 2015 UTC,"Couldn't say what they are exactly, but in case it helps you/others track it down further:  The first sword looks like a small sword, a.k.a. a dress or court sword, and the design on it looks to be a crowned V.R., the royal glyph of Queen Victoria. I would guess it's a late-Victorian British officer's sword but I don't have any specific information to back that up. Here's one that looks quite a bit like yours.  All I can tell about the second one is it seems to be Spanish (I think?), with one side of the blade referring to its material (hierro = iron) and the other its origin - Solingen is a German city known for its swords and other blades.  So that's not much but hopefully it helps."

They generally come as either a single container for wine/grape juice for rituals that use wine-only, or with twin containers, for rituals using water mixed with wine.  The latter generally have a chalice or goblet included, for mixing the water and wine together.  You don't give everyone a splash of wine and a splash of water in their little individual cup, you mix them in the chalice and then distribute it.  The circle in the OP's kit is where the missing chalice or goblet would have stood.  And the box is for the wafers, yes.  It looks nothing at all like a portable liquor kit. Imgur.

Whatisthis,3dynz4,Martinez77,2,Mon Jul 20 17:58:32 2015 UTC,"Yes its ""the horsy (?) game"" as we call it in my family... My grandpops made a version of this game. You just need 2 die, a deck of cards and the board (and a good pile of change). Remove the jokers, aces and kings. have some one roll the dice...  First roll is a 5-So remove the four fives from the deck and Move horse number 5 back one slot. = later in the game if someone rolls a 5 they pay 10 cents to the cup.  Second roll is a 2- remove the 2 cards and move that one back 2 slots. if anyone rolls a 2 they pay 20 cents.   Repeat One and Two for 3 and 4, adding amounts respectively, 3= 30 cents and 4= 40 cents.   Shuffle up them cards!  Deal out the last of the deck to the players. Next player rolls the die and hope they roll a horse that's in their hand!!  So with 7 being the most probable roll, a game where horse 7 moves back 4 can be a big jackpot at the end! Ive won plenty of laundy money with this game, and its a blast to play with the family at any gathering.    But you will notice, horse number 2 (and queen) only has a few notches to move because rolling a two is only possible with a 1 and 1 roll..

Here is an uncropped version: http://www.delcampe.net/page/item/id,173647928,var,Aux-heros-Pantheon-de-la-guerre-1918,language,E.html  That post card was a picture of one section of a painting named the Pantheon De La Guerre it was the largest painting in the world at the time.

A portion of the panel depicted in your photo did survive and is on display at the National WW1 Museum in Kansas City.   As for the question as to whether it still exists, I don't think it ever did exist anywhere but in the painting. In other words I don't believe the artist painted an existing monument.

If the tree has any other visible symptoms of disease (dead leaves or cankers), then you could probably bet it's disease.  2) Sometimes the saw blade can chemically react with the tree, causing that oxidized copper type color.

Whatisthis,3dgplg,tacobelltuesdays,4,Thu Jul 16 03:22:33 2015 UTC,Unfortunately your house is between their TV and the TV station and they didnt want to put their antenna on the roof.   So they kludged a few antennas together to get better reception (since your house is blocking it) and pointed it to the station.   Or they're reading your minds. YMMV.
Whatisthis,3dgplg,kawfey,2,Thu Jul 16 23:42:13 2015 UTC,Looks like a pair or combination of HDTV antennae.   LINK   The second and third designs seem to match.
Whatisthis,3dgplg,FadeIntoReal,3,Thu Jul 16 15:17:03 2015 UTC,You're right. There is a four way splitter which is being used to combine four antennae and combine them into one feed. It will work if the antennae are phased correctly. It will make reception worse if not phased correctly. Unfortunately they have mounted the figure 8 antennae backwards. The wire screen is supposed to be behind the figure 8.

One of the dealers at my shop recently sold a sword as a WWII kai gunto for $2500 but did not know to check for a ricasso...turns out the blade was from 1648 and he sold it for 1/5 what it was worth. If there is a chance of age, always try to get it checked out by someone who knows his stuff. You could be leaving a LOT of money on the table."

It has a photovoltaic panel and doesn't look like it's wired to anything.  It looks like it could be a camera enclosure, but it's not at all like the rest of the PTZ dome security cameras on campus, and it's really hard to tell if it would be pointing at the red brick building in the album or if it's pointing at the rain garden or even parking lot next door. There are some departmentally run webcams on other buildings for stuff like a peregrine falcon cam, so maybe it has to do with monitoring the rain garden and cistern project next to the building it's on.  It's on is a steam heating plant for a university campus, and the building it's possibly pointing at would be mostly the Anthropology dept and some other office space.

Most home owners from way back when would dump there garbage in there back yards be it a slope or a hole that was dug; Its not uncommon that gardens where made upon old dumps.  I'd think too there would be a lot of ash mixed in as well....You may actually find some good stuff at the bottom where the ash layer ends if your interested.  The oldest of bottles would be at the bottom when they first started dumping there.

When machining these parts there would be a tendency for them to vibrate and the vibration would cause the machined surface to be damaged. Some of our part holding fixtures included jack screws that would be raised to touch the part and prevent it from vibrating (chattering). The jack screw wasn't there to lift anything it was just to provide support on an irregularly shaped object.

I used one for a while on a Nikon F2 with the 250 Exposure cassette. they were a REAL pain to load and to change in the camera. this is before they had SD cards that would store thousands of photos. also the other pain with the bulk film backs was you couldn't develop the film yourself without a film processor as the 750 exposure cassette was about 100 feet long.

Someone was there who has some mobility issues?  >If you have some arm mobility, but limited grasp, you may already know about wristbraces (or ""wrist splints"") with “palmar clips” to hold various objects such as a fork. They’re a great help for us 'higher injury' folks when it comes to eating, or for such things as brushing teeth. The photo with the fork gives some idea how it works, but I've found that it's cleaner and easier if your thumb is inside the plastic part of the brace, as shown in the picture, with my toothbrush holder. That way, when you're eating, your thumb doesn't get in the way, or drag through the food. Notice how the fork in the picture is bent? It’s a litte hard to see, but it just works better if the fork is bent so that the tines are lower than the handle, but also pointing the same relative direction as an un-bent fork. You'll also find that forks with wider or fatter handles stay in the palmar clip much better. That's important when you’re trying to stab some food (or a friend ... gently).  Or maybe someone found out the ring over a fire pit got hot enough to melt metal and they were REALLY drunk and decided to kill the silverware drawer."

The solid material (e.g., iron sulfide) is placed into the middle cylinder, the acid is put into the top cylinder. A tube extends from the top cylinder into the bottom cylinder. The middle cylinder has a tube with a stopcock attached, which is used to draw off the evolved gas. When the stopcock is closed, the pressure of the gas in the middle cylinder rises and expels the acid back into the top cylinder, until it is not in contact with the solid material anymore, and the chemical reaction stops."

If the room has a damp or musty smell then it warrants further investigation EG~ looking for mold spots near the base of your floor on the walls etc.  It could be just some food that had moisture  that was left behind.  If the room smells damp and you find more mold take it serious.

XD I'd probably freak out too if I didn't know what type of bug it was, especially due to their size (22-25 mm). :) That's a big beetle! Pretty scary looking, too; what with their pincers and all.   That's strange that it ended up in your house, though. :/ Do you live near a forested area, by any chance?  The Wiki page says that it "" in deciduous forests and adjacent areas""; and that they're ""attracted to lights at night"".  Its life also pretty much revolves around trees and wood.  Maybe one night it was hanging out high up in a tree, was able to look in through your window, and saw the light shining on your hardwood floor (I'm judging by the picture), and thought ""I wonder what it'd be like to crawl around on that!"", so it somehow ninja'd its way inside your house.

The left side of that character- the radical, in this case can be written two different ways. Both styles show up in different computer font, and in terms of handwriting, it's up to the writer which one they prefer.

I imagine it's probably something from the ESA, maybe the IXV, which was just sent up in February of this year.

It is not Egyptian (Hieroglyphic, Demotic or Hieratic), but the style lead me there first. I checked all the phonological symbols just to be sure. I didn't check determinitivies, because those symbols don't have sounds.   It's not Babylonian, Phoenician or anything related to Phoenician script (Aramaic, Chaldea, etc.).   It's not 'native american' that I can find; Only the Meso-americans had robust scripts. This isn't part of that.   It's not Asian. I dug into this a bit more, the first (and third) character looks similar to the Eye symbol in Chinese/Japanese (Kanji), but the fourth symbol looks extremely out of place for a Chinese character.   So. It looks constructed (Fantasy likely) to me. The second character looks more like a 'brush' character, where as the fourth character looks more like a stylus based character.

In the old days, plumbers used to build pipes and fixtures by bending sheets of lead into shape. They'd use a mallet to make the lead conform to the shape of a wooden mold. I once saw a craftsman give a demonstration of the technique at the Weald and Downland Open Air Museum.  Yours look remarkably clean and unused, though."

I think the shorter rope may have been cut but both ropes are a little long unless a tarp was put down so the kill would be more manageable for one man. Also to keep the legs spread out you place a stick in between the two ropes. You can also place smaller kills on both ropes separately (smaller deer, bunnies, and fowls)  Edit: Added more information."

There were two ways to do it - one way was to put your foot in the loop and swing really high up, but I preferred to hold onto the knot above the loop and hang on. I like to think that I live my life on the edge.    The reason that I think it is a swing is because there is a slope ahead, which gives you the thrill of, ""Holy shit, if I fall off of this I'm fucked.""    So much fun. I don't know of anyone who actually fell off the swing though."

From an art history view icons are part of tradition spanning roughly 1500 years. The whole point of orthodoxy was in remaining on that level that was reached during the early East roman empire. Monks painted icons that were near perfect reproductions of the famour icon in their monastery which was itself a reproduction of an icon from an older monastery. The only thing hindering OP's search is the fact during SSSR there was a decline in religion, and the possible problem with language barrier."

I am unfamiliar with other Christianity traditions, but in Russian Orthodox it is quite common for the churches to sell those inside them. Different icons with Saints may serve different purposes. Awhile ago, because I traveled extensively my grandmother purchased me a triple wooden board with copies of different icons. In the past those were done (understandably) by hand, currently some of the icons are still done by hand, others  however have a verse of decal put on the wooden boards, then lacquer applied over it.   Edit: Some of those icons purchased from churches were quite expensive and beautifully crafted. Such images were passed from generation to generation, somewhat similar to wedding rings passed on from say Grandmother to her daughter. My family for example still have one, which was purchased about 120 years ago. It is not in a very good state, but it is what some may call a ""family heirloom""."

It's a zinc engraving (not mechanically engraved, but chemically engraved) mounted to wood and brought up to  .918"" (blame the French).  Unlike a traditional engraving, in this case the raised portion is inked and printed (vs. inking the incised bits and pulling the ink from them, like an etching).  These are hardly made any more and fairly collectable, with the caveat that, just like vinyl records, there were millions of these things made.  Its real value is whatever you're willing to spend for the image that is on the block.

Whatisthis,3amki4,captain_joe6,1 point,Sun Jun 21 22:20:39 2015 UTC,"So, other responses to this in mind, you've got a couple of options:  1) lowbrow, just to see what it looks like: go out to the art supply store and buy yourself a Speedball brayer (roller) and some water-based block printing ink.  Roll out a tiny amount of ink, a half-teaspoon perhaps, into a nice even film on a sheet of glass or your marble countertop or a very clean cookie sheet, whatever.  Once the ink is even, make a few slow, even passes across the surface of the block.  You're goal is to evenly distribute ink across the raised surface without pressing any into the engraved areas.  Once it's inked, grab yourself a thin sheet of paper and a wooden spoon.  Paper goes on the block, and then you run the back of the spoon all over the back of the paper, using moderate pressure.  You'll get a halfway decent print.  Repeat and experiment with different amounts of ink and pressure and different papers.  Might get something nice.  2) Right: find yourself a letterpress machine.  If you don't want to pay much, look around for colleges with decently-funded art programs (you'll probably see a picture of their presses somewhere on their art program website) or printmaking studios around town.  Have someone there make you a print in exchange for some beer or something.  You'll get a much nicer print.    3) worst case scenario: find a letterpress printer on Etsy and strike up a conversation, then get ye to a post office."

I'm located in Pittsburgh, but just from working there I've heard of other similar places in New Orleans and Detroit.

Well I think the answer has already been given. It looks the most like a radiusbone, which is one of the two bones in the lower arm. It's the bone that ""radiates"" over the other bone (the ulna), making it possible to turn your hand. This bone is too thin to be of a human, even a child would have a thicker radius. So i really doubt it's human. The suggestion of it being of a pelican, made me search google, and birds do seem to have a similar looking radius in their wings. A pelican or possibly a seagol would have the proper size for this bone.   So yeah, a pelican's or seagol's equivalent of the human radius.  P.s.

Whatisthis,3a4p63,trumpeting_farts,2,Wed Jun 17 14:03:18 2015 UTC,"The swim bladder, gas bladder, fish maw or air bladder is an internal gas-filled organ that contributes to the ability of a fish to control its buoyancy, and thus to stay at its current water depth without having to waste energy in swimming. Also, the dorsal position of the swim bladder means the center of mass is below the center of volume, allowing it to act as a stabilizing agent. Additionally, the swim bladder functions as a resonating chamber, to produce or receive sound."

Lycogala epidendrum, commonly known as wolf's milk, groening's slime is a cosmopolitan species of plasmodial slime mould which is often mistaken for a fungus. The aethalia, or fruiting bodies, occur either scattered or in groups on damp rotten wood, especially on large logs, from June to November. These aethalia are small, pink to brown cushion-like globs. They may excrete a pink paste if the outer wall is broken before maturity. When mature, the colour tends to become more brownish. When not fruiting, single celled individuals move about as very small, red amoeba-like organisms called plasmodia, masses of protoplasm that engulf bacteria, fungal and plant spores, protozoa, and particles of non-living organic matter through phagocytosis."

Whatisthis,3a1rn9,Guygan,5,Tue Jun 16 15:39:58 2015 UTC,You should call the power company and have them look at it.
Whatisthis,3a1rn9,becausefrog,2,Tue Jun 16 15:44:32 2015 UTC,"Are you in Boston? Because between NSTAR and Comcast there's dead end wires hanging off of poles everywhere. I called them about several on my street in the past because they would come off of the poles and dangle (and even pile up) onto the sidewalk and I felt it was a hazard. Basically they told me they are dead wires that no one uses anymore, but they aren't 'owned' by the company currently using the poles, so they can't remove them, only coil or tie them up and leave them.   Not sure if that's what's going on here, but it could be similar."

Whatisthis,39wjc1,wmass,2,Mon Jun 15 19:09:47 2015 UTC,"Water heaters have a device called a temperature and pressure relief valve. The purpose of this valve is to release pressure if other controls fail and allow the water in the tank to overheat. It is always a serious problem if one of these valves releases hot water.   In one of my houses the valve was plumbed to release onto the concrete floor of the basement. (This, I guess, is considered better than allowing the tank to explode 8-).  In another house it is plumbed to release outdoors onto the lawn.   I don't know if your third faucet is temp and pressure release valve overflow but since it intermittently spills hot water, it seems likely. If I were you I would get a plumber to look at it immediately. If you are thinking of delaying, watch the Mythbusters episode about what happens when all of the safety devices on a water heater fail."

Whatisthis,39wjc1,captain_joe6,3,Tue Jun 16 20:41:17 2015 UTC,"Right, if this third faucet is connected to the t&p and it periodically releases lots of water, it isn't the t&p valve that's failed, it is something else that's failing and the t&p valve is doing its job of releasing pressure. Whatever is causing that pressure needs to be identified and fixed. OP says the faucet doesn't release hot water, which doesn't really sound like it is coming from the T&P valve but something is not right."

Let me explain--  We are American. We don't use them in America, but we see them whenever we visit Britain. Whenever you eat breakfast in a British B&B or café, they always serve you toast on one of these racks. (Yours is rather fancy; there is a simpler type that is more common.)  In America, when we eat toast for breakfast, we expect it to be served hot, so that butter melts when you spread it on. (But restaurants sometimes cheat by applying the butter in the kitchen, and sometimes they even apply melted butter with a brush.) Therefore toast is usually served stacked on a plate, because it retains its heat longer that way.  But Brits seem to prefer their toast cold. The only reason we can see for using a rack rather than a plate is to make absolutely sure the toast is cooled to room temperature before it is served, hence the name ""toast cooler."""

If the symbols truly mean something and are meant solely for her, maybe to remind her of something for example, and are not intended as beautification or to convey some sort of social message to others, you'd think she would have it done somewhere on her body that she'd see everyday but wouldn't be visible on a daily basis to avoid being asked about it constantly.

Whatisthis,39hjb0,Marlboro_Gold,2,Thu Jun 11 22:07:53 2015 UTC,"In the 1960s and 1970s, some people had telephones, such as the Princess Telephone that used power to illuminate the phone dial in the dark. SO when you ordered one, the telephone company would come to your place and add a power brick to an outlet near a phone jack, and the dial light power would travel through an unused pair of wires to any phone that needed the dial light. (There were usually four wires to every jack, but a single line phone only needs two.)  Back in the '80s someone realized the gazillion unused and forgotten transformers were a fire hazard, or some other hazard, and there was a campaign to get rid of them.  This thing looks MUCH newer than a Princess Phone transformer. Plus all of those had a manufacturer's label on them. HOWEVER I think I can see two wires below it. If it has a rounded wire and a flat wire it could be using telephone wiring to power something -- maybe some sort of a security system or a yard sprinkler system.   The lighter colored box nearer the outlet resembles a surge protector (with a light to indicate it hasn't failed yet). This makes sense, too, as the phone cord and the power line might be protected from surges, using the grounded outlet to shunt electrical surges to ground."

Whatisthis,3956ih,whocareswhatever,1 point,Tue Jun 9 16:37:34 2015 UTC,You might try a school and see if they have anything to play it.  I actually own an old player that could play it.
Whatisthis,3956ih,adudeguyman,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:24:57 2015 UTC,"It's a reel-to-reel magnetic tape. See if you can find anybody who'll convert it to something a bit less fragile (MP3, CD, etc.). My college had a media conversion lab, but I'm guessing a radio station might be able to point you in the right direction.  You don't want to get a shady reel-to-reel off Craigslist and have the thing seize up and snap the tape in the middle of listening to it."
Whatisthis,3956ih,ThetaGamma2,1 point,Tue Jun 9 13:30:10 2015 UTC,"Since you'll need it only once, maybe a local radio station or studio (library even?) might let you use it just for the listen/transfer."

I shadowed a guy at a local radio station and they had a reel to reel player. I wonder if you could go to a local station, a college radio station might be more inclined to do this for you. Good luck!"
Whatisthis,3956ih,Earth_Bug,0,Tue Jun 9 15:22:03 2015 UTC,"Seconding what others have said here: Your local school, library, or radio station will probably still have at least one reel-to-reel deck to play your tape.  Beware: older tapes may ""shed oxide"" when played. That means that the actual iron oxide (yep, rust) that is holding the data may flake off the plastic backing of the tape as you play it. You may only be able to play this one time before it disintegrates. There's a special baking process used for very valuable tapes before they are played. My guess would be that this tape is not unique, since VOA tapes were sent to hundreds of radio stations on a weekly basis, but this may have been re-used and could contain something interesting. Good luck!"

Whatisthis,38jtcu,FuzzytheSlothBear,3,Thu Jun 4 18:46:33 2015 UTC,"It is in fact a really long borosilicate Dewar flask (trade name which everyone knows - Thermos bottle). The outer layer is clear, and the inner layer is lined with a high-absorption coating which converts about 99% of the light which hits it directly into heat.  There is an aluminum heat conductor which transfers the absorbed energy into a copper heat pipe, much like the ones which are used in CPU coolers.  These can generate temperatures up to 400F.  The top bulb releases the heat contained in the superheated vapor into the working medium, usually domestic and commercial hot water applications, however there are adsorption chillers which use this technology as well.  Side note - NASA uses these solar adsorption chillers to cool their film footage storage building in the heat of the Florida summer.  These type of solar water heaters are ubiquitous in China, and if you look at Google Maps, you'll see that a significant percentage of their residential buildings are aligned East-West, as that's the best angle to collect the maximum amount of solar energy for water heating.  I wish the U.S. would adopt this technology wholeheartedly, as it would go a long ways towards energy independence."

We were talking about the English language and vanity was a word used to describe the many meanings one word can have.  There are better ones, but this is what came up. The definition of vanity tells us it is a dressing table. A dressing table is a table often fitted with drawers and a mirror in front of which one sits while dressing and grooming oneself. Now a dresser is  a chest of drawers or bureau with a mirror. With that being said, I would go with it being a vanity although technically it could be both."

Often, there are several in the same area, because the rock is similar in make-up, and they can be varying sizes, from tiny to very large (like big enough to stand in, or even bigger)."
Whatisthis,37x6xq,Rocquestar,2,Tue Jun 2 03:12:23 2015 UTC,"It really depends on where you found them  If this rock is from some sort of urban area, I'd say it's the result of construction or some other man-made grinding.  If this rock is found near a riverbed it could be an abrasion pothole as stated below.  And if you found this rock at the beach I would say that it's possible to have been engineered by an animal. A lot of mollusks secrete acids to make these perfect holes into rocks."

I asked him what they were and the were holes that he bore to stick blasting material to clear rock for his basement. Are they near any possible construction sites? like a house or walls? This is what it very well could be."
Whatisthis,37x6xq,Grasshof,2,Sun May 31 06:07:46 2015 UTC,"My bet is this. I grew up in a town with a quarry, and typically you see these as half-holes along the outside face of a big piece of granite. They are 6-10"" deep holes drilled in a line to hold blasting sticks. Sometimes, holes like this would be seen if they were drilled by mistake or as a test."

The mentor is long dead and my friend in the piano business has no clue what it might be...nor does any other piano business or piano expert I talk to about it from England or Europe or Australia so far. they all say they've never seen one before and suggest to check with other specialists...Nor does Lee valley tools, nor any antique shop, nor any old HVAC tech I work with, nor any second hand tool store I pester. I have begun quizzing anyone who looks like they might know a thing or two about tools. Electricians, Vido production staff etc......I just took it apart a bit further and its a dreadfully nondescript item, to the point where the bevels on the inside of the square tubes are SO subtle they might just be wear and tear...but who is to say for certain?  there is 3 Stamped letters on the tool it says DHS, so I figure those are the mentor's initials.  No brand name or marks or numbers of any kind exist except ...just DHS stamped on the back of one of the square rods. I was given the tool to try to figure out what it is.

It reads, from right to left, 中華民國五十年 (Zhong hua min guo wu shi nian). Translated 50th year (五十年) of the Republic (中華民國).   You see, Taiwan uses the Minguo calendar (aka Republic of China calendar). The first year in the Minguo calendar is 1912, the year of the founding of the Republic of China.  Taiwan does use the ""regular"" Gregorian Calendar, but on all official paperwork (including currency) the Minguo year is used. This is why you have to specify if you are referring to Gregorian or Minguo year in conversation sometimes.   This year (2015) is the 104th year of the Republic. To find the Minguo year equivalent of any year, subtract 1911 from the year in question. So, the 50th year of the Republic is 1961.   By the way, that is a single yuan note"

Whatisthis,36hxec,StochasticLife,8,Tue May 19 16:04:36 2015 UTC,"Many years a Mason here - the ""G"" circumscribed by the square and compasses is one of the most common symbols in Freemasonry.  In American lodges, the G is often replaced by the all-seeing-eye symbol as popularized by Hollywood and conspiracy theorists.  In Masonry, we say that the square (meaning the L-shaped tool) is ""to keep us within due bounds with all mankind"".  It's an abstraction - as with all things in Masonry - of a moral imperative and serves as a reminder the obligations we all enter into.  A common interpretation of this epitaph would be that the man buried there lived his life by the strict moral code prescribed by the order.  I find it a little odd that it would be written out so bluntly, as it would be considered braggardly and ""not very Masonic"" to state that about ones' self.

Whatisthis,36hxec,ImmediatePastBastard,5,Tue May 19 21:24:17 2015 UTC,"George Washington was born on Feb. 22, 1732, to parents who were of the prosperous gentry of Virginia, and of English descent.  His early education included mathematics, the classics, “rules of civility”, and surveying.  He was asked to survey and lay out the city of Bellhaven, which is now Alexandria, Virginia.  Some of his surveyor duties brought him as far South as Florida, and some of his marker stakes still can be found in Northern Florida.   Soldier, statesman, aristocrat, planter, owner of slaves, yes.  But almost nowhere, except in Masonic writings is he mentioned as a wise and accomplished Mason.  Raised a Master Mason on August 4, 1753, he maintained his membership in Fredericksburg Lodge until his death, 46 years later.  Twice during those years he was Master of the Lodge in Alexandria, Virginia, and was twice suggested as Grand Master.  While in his second term as Worshipful Master in Alexandria Lodge #22, he was elected and installed President of The U.S.   Never a “nominal” Mason, Washington lived until December 14, 1779; his body laid to rest in the family vault at Mt. Vernon.  No finer epitaph exists than the simple statement made by the great man himself: “I have lived upon the square.”"

The crook should be paired with a flail and it's not.  The headdress is too stylized and the cartouche doesn't seem to translate to anything.  If I had to take a wild guess I'd say he looks most like Ptolemy XV, the last ruler of Egypt before Rome took over, but that's definitely not his cartouche.

Depending upon it's orientation, the symbol has a multitude of meanings, and has been incorporated into shields and logos for centuries. Mostly though, the inverted pentacle or pentagram is known for it's association with horror movies.  These are probably just some bored kids, but Here is an article about the pentacle penned by some lunatic."
Whatisthis,36bepc,Baranov13,0,Mon May 18 06:57:47 2015 UTC,"This looks absolutely nothing like a pentacle.  There is no outside circle, but rather a tombstone shaped outer frame. Most of the sticks on the inside would be barely long enough to reach across the frame anyways.  Pentacles have been used as symbols before LaVey came along, and LaVeyan Satanism only incorporates a pentacle in the Sigil of Baphomet, which includes the head of Baphomet as well as some Hebrew lettering.  Without those two elements the inverted pentacle merely represents materialism and ""matter-over-mind"".  Also, the difference between a pentacle and pentagram does not lie within its orientation, but rather is dependent on whether or not a circle around the points of the star is present. A pentagram is a 5 pointed star on its own, without a circle."

Whatisthis,35ur06,CAPSLOCK44,13,Wed May 13 17:57:59 2015 UTC,"Someone else pointed out but it got deleted - so I won't take credit for this. What you have is an air gap.  Use the following diagram: http://i.imgur.com/iQe9EU9.jpg  It essentially ensures that water will only flow one way (from the drainage of the dishwasher to the sink's trap). Without this, if the sink were to overflow, a siphon effect would essentially cause all of the sink's water to back flow into the dishwasher.  Instead, the junction between the sink's trap and the drainage has been raised above the sink's surface - this helps make sure that an overflowing sink will never push water into the dishwasher. But that doesn't stop the siphon effect! To counteract that, there's a gap between the two pipe fittings (an air-gap) which prevents a siphon from forming.  It's actually a pretty clever system.  Edit: Also, as /u/jarecis has pointed out, it allows the sink to drain faster. In that respect, the idea is ""air behind water."" If you've ever filled a straw with water and then capped it with your finger on one end, you know what happens when you don't have air behind water. When you release your finger (thus allowing air into the system) it drains the straw."

Whatisthis,35ur06,kilamumster,0,Sat May 16 00:43:57 2015 UTC,"And, a little more trivia.  The reason most sinks don't have this is that sinks, dishwashers, and all drains are usually connected to a vent pipe that goes through the roof.  This allows any sewer gasses to vent outdoors if the trap loses its ""prime"" and goes dry.  You probably have this because the sink is in a island, so there is no way to connect the drain to a vent pipe without going below the level of the trap."
Whatisthis,35ur06,LazySprocket,1 point,Wed May 13 19:59:17 2015 UTC,"I am a plumber and you are wrong on so many levels it's hard to start. Vents aren't just for  gasses out they also admit air in (think vacuum of a finger on a straw) and a studor vent or air admittance valve works  perfectly fine without letting gasses  out. Residential dishwashers are never vented (a pump forces the water to a vented waste system typically) and an airgap is for health reasons  not functional ones. If a trap goes unprimed it will in almost every single case leak gasses into the building, that is the sole purpose of a trap, to put a barrier between gasses and your house/nose. You are confusing  a studor vent with an air gap. Also on an island non lazy plumbers or those not doing an island on a remodel will do a loop vent instead of a studor."

Damn you and your sexy talk!  TIL how my island sink is vented. Also, I hate island sinks. Also, OP should turn the air gap cover around so the little openings face the sink, because if the water ever backs up, you want it to drain into the sink and not all over your hardwood floors."

There's a LOT of history behind these, and because of that they can be highly collectable. The fancier ones tend to have ornaments on them.  This particular one is probably NOT very valuable (still really cool though!). As you can see, it's been very well used.

Whatisthis,35m9gt,Raijuu,1 point,Mon May 11 18:29:18 2015 UTC,"It certainly could be! Chestnuts work on that principal actually. The seeds grow inside a hard spiky ball which eventually splits open to let the seed (the chestnut) grow.   What you found here could definitely be one of those shells, or part of one."

Looks like it could be crabgrass (as someone else mentioned) but it's hard to tell from this distance.  The easiest way to get rid of it is to... prevent it in the first place :p You can buy pre-emergence herbicide which will stop it from growing - but you usually have to do this before it starts (though it will stop it from spreading).  I'm a bit more aggressive about it and just shovel it out and lay down new soil/grass seed.  If it's not crabgrass, it could just be a different variety of grass. Birds are constantly eating grass seeds in the spring and crapping it all over the place. Could just be some seed from your neighbour."

A single ""sucker"" cane will grow; you are supposed to prune it back and that will encourage new canes to sprout from the rootstock (if it is a desired type of rose).   All the nice pretty, multi-caned roses you see at the nursery and in peoples gardens are usually the result of grafting the desired type of hybrid rose canes to a healthy rootstock.

Whatisthis,354ai4,seththeneanderthal,19,Wed May 6 23:59:49 2015 UTC,"Very likely it is.  THIS particular type of bullet is lead, with a copper jacket, and a red plastic insert. It seems to match yours."

Whatisthis,354ai4,peteareenus,1 point,Thu May 7 00:20:01 2015 UTC,"I guess I third this. Definitely looks like a copper-jacketed lead bullet with a plastic cap. I've seen spent bullets like that before. The plastic cap allows for better aerodynamics at a range (as with full metal jacket bullets), while maintaining the impact characteristics of a hollow-point - that is, reduced penetration and increased energy transfer to the target. A kind of round often used for hunting large game like deer."
Whatisthis,354ai4,Discitus,2,Thu May 7 01:14:36 2015 UTC,"I found it right next to my mother's apartment building. It's next to some woods where people are allowed to hunt deer, but only by bow and arrow."
Whatisthis,354ai4,doomrabbit,2,Thu May 7 03:09:36 2015 UTC,"I'm going guess that it may have come from a long ways away. Guygan got the bullet type, but what's interesting is that the bullet was tumbling when it hit. A freshly fired round would travel and hit nose first, destroying the red plastic bit. It would also have a round cylindrical backside and a mushroom-ish front, instead of looking like a piece of clay thrown to the floor.  If you think of the bullet path as an arc, up until it's highest point, it  is powered flight. On the second half, it's powered by gravity dragging it back down, and as such it starts to tumble from turbulence, which got it turned sideways.  This is just me going off high school physics and what goes up must come down, others can feel free to critique or add more accurate ballistics analysis."
Whatisthis,354ai4,jonnichols,3,Thu May 7 15:23:46 2015 UTC,"Quite possibly fired into the air, perhaps?"
Whatisthis,354ai4,doomrabbit,1 point,Thu May 7 16:21:58 2015 UTC,"Hmm, hard to say since there are an insane number of factors. Looks like Mythbusters would say you are right, as they found that only a bullet fired straight up tumbled. However, they were shooting a rifle round if I remember correctly, and those are elongated. OP's bullet looks stubby, which is more likely a pistol round. Example. Pistols are lower powered, and the less streamlined shape might make it less likely to right itself while tumbling. As a long rifle round would naturally seek lower wind resistance, it would be more likely to eventually point down again."

The smell and the material could also be an indication of old, but repurposed material. The first thing that came to mind when I saw it was ""steampunk"" and I've seen old objects transformed into (semi)functional items with a touch of workmanship.  This is also backed by the lack of a filter or any other kind of protective barrier.  Finally, it may be helpful to do some research on the Great Dust Bowl - I am not sure what people back then used to protect themselves against particulates, but if it's from that time, it would make a hell of a lot of sense.

The gold is much richer and probably closer to 18k than the 10k, 12k or 14k that American manufacturers would use commercially and looks to have been cast from either found nugget or perhaps old ingot gold plus scrap old Euopean gold.   I'm not going to lie, that piece gave me a weird felling. As someone sensitive to metals to begin with:  Its very possible that some of the gold ""scrap"" in that piece might actually have come from reclaimed gold from the holocaust, for some reason it gave me a bad vibe when I saw it.  Vongola, by the way, is Italian for Clam, ie Spaghetti ala Vongola-Spaghetti with clam sauce.  Possible an older gent's pre world War or very just post World War 2; and then emigrated family ring or one someone tried to creat from a piece of Carnelian.  Off the Coast of South Western Sardinia is an entire Island, one of the Sole sources of Carnelian, that red car able stone, since antiquity.  Hope someone else has a better answer for you.

Whatisthis,349yjo,MattAmoroso,5,Wed Apr 29 16:09:11 2015 UTC,"It's for sewing thick things, like sails or leather, you use it to push the needle through."
Whatisthis,349yjo,FiskFisk33,17,Wed Apr 29 18:13:22 2015 UTC,"The correct term is ""dumpster diving"" BTW"
Whatisthis,349yjo,MyKarmaKilledURDogma,-4,Wed Apr 29 17:10:19 2015 UTC,Dumpster *driving

Whatisthis,349yjo,Marik_Bathory,3,Mon May 4 13:35:07 2015 UTC,It's like a giant thimble.
Whatisthis,349yjo,flaminggarlic,0,Wed Apr 29 16:53:10 2015 UTC,"Damn you all! This is one I actually know, because I found one 3 days ago."
Whatisthis,349yjo,TeeReks,-1,Wed Apr 29 16:45:53 2015 UTC,At first it looked like a seed cup the Nelumbonaceae family.  http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a4/Nelumbo_Nucifera_fruit_-_botanic_garden_Adelaide.jpg
Whatisthis,34cui5,znew,6,Thu Apr 30 03:06:45 2015 UTC,Daylilly.
Whatisthis,34cui5,Jibaro123,0,Thu Apr 30 03:17:10 2015 UTC,That's a clump of daylilies (a/k/a Hemerocallis).
Whatisthis,349g1a,Vortuka,15,Wed Apr 29 10:39:02 2015 UTC,it looks like an awl
Whatisthis,349g1a,tillandsia,13,Wed Apr 29 11:43:11 2015 UTC,"Definitely an awl.  Used for stitching or wood working.  Fact  of the day: An awl was the cause of blindness in Louis Braille, when he accidentally poked himself in the eye while working with an awl in his father's workshop.  A resulting infection spread to bothe eyes and blinded him.  He went on to invent the Braille reading system for the blind."
Whatisthis,349g1a,melonlollicholypop,4,Wed Apr 29 13:37:42 2015 UTC,Is the tip fully round or is it oval or flat? The shape isn't obvious from a single image. What is your guess regarding the material used to form the tip? Is it metal?
Whatisthis,349g1a,ebanobre,3,Wed Apr 29 13:29:09 2015 UTC,"Ok, the picture was sent to me, so I can't offer any more information about the object, but we now believe it to be an awl so thank you all very much for your help."
Whatisthis,349g1a,Ozymandale,2,Wed Apr 29 13:52:27 2015 UTC,It is an awl but the question is: for what? It is not a normal awl for work in wood or in leather. It is very refined. Seems to be a medical device or something for the use of rich persons.
Whatisthis,349g1a,Merkinempire,6,Fri May 1 10:17:06 2015 UTC,I'd say a letter opener
Whatisthis,349g1a,Steelersfan74,2,Wed Apr 29 10:39:50 2015 UTC,"If there look to be like tree rings on the white part, it's prob ivory, but it looks like bone to me.  It looks like a metal knife sharpener, but I'd say it looks too pointy for that.  It could be an antique stylus of some kind, perhaps for reading or whatnot, and it could also be some poking tool for a craft, perhaps an old icepick or awl.   I can't tell from the photo, but if it's sort of flat, it's prob a letter opener like the person said earlier.  Is the metal silver or steel?"
Whatisthis,349g1a,motherofkatana,2,Wed Apr 29 11:43:17 2015 UTC,Perhaps it is an ice pick.
Whatisthis,349g1a,patdashuri,1 point,Wed Apr 29 11:49:48 2015 UTC,I can't tell the size. Shoe horn?
Whatisthis,349g1a,bakinblack,1 point,Wed Apr 29 10:41:03 2015 UTC,"Looks like one of those 'hidden blade within an every day object"" things. Shoehorn?"
Whatisthis,34afeb,balduran0,7,Wed Apr 29 16:09:26 2015 UTC,That's a robot.
Whatisthis,34afeb,bollykat,2,Wed Apr 29 16:16:21 2015 UTC,We're finally at the point when robots can be mistaken for living things.
Whatisthis,34afeb,MudnuK,2,Wed Apr 29 16:54:53 2015 UTC,"Well, maybe in a shitty video..."
Whatisthis,34afeb,Guygan,6,Thu Apr 30 02:12:30 2015 UTC,Boston Dynamics robot.
Whatisthis,34bdn7,bli1182,7,Wed Apr 29 20:17:19 2015 UTC,I have several of those at home. It's a plastic stick for stirring drinks with.  http://i00.i.aliimg.com/photo/v3/1999429546/Plastic_high_five_hand_shaped_drink_stirrer.jpg

Whatisthis,34bdn7,Brutalos,1 point,Thu Apr 30 04:50:43 2015 UTC,Is it soft? Hard? Size? Context? Material?
Whatisthis,348hkn,Freeside1,9,Wed Apr 29 03:17:34 2015 UTC,Aerolux light bulb  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerolux_Light_Corporation  They use neon or argon depending on the colour desired  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neon_lamp
Whatisthis,348hkn,bweebar,1 point,Wed Apr 29 03:26:11 2015 UTC,No joke I have this exact same light bulb. I always wondered if I screwed it in if it would work. Cool to see it actually lit up.

Whatisthis,347dyv,ebanobre,-1,Tue Apr 28 22:05:54 2015 UTC,I think you mean from the game series Ultima.
Whatisthis,347dyv,HolyJuan,5,Wed Apr 29 02:15:29 2015 UTC,No. In elder and younger futhark was used this simbol. See page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Younger_Futhark
Whatisthis,347dyv,ebanobre,15,Wed Apr 29 05:37:51 2015 UTC,Gandalf's mark? In Runic it's F but in Tolkien's Cirth it's G.
Whatisthis,347dyv,Evil-Mike,3,Tue Apr 28 22:42:38 2015 UTC,Agreed; I don't know about real runes but I do recognize that sign from LotR.
Whatisthis,347dyv,nuez_jr,6,Wed Apr 29 02:00:30 2015 UTC,The Fe rune.
Whatisthis,347dyv,Norse_of_60,5,Tue Apr 28 23:30:52 2015 UTC,"It's a more stylized version of the rune that usually makes the ""F"" sound.  Probably not written by vikings, as they did most of their writing in rocks and wood, making something that curvy not very useful."
Whatisthis,347dyv,Baranov13,13,Tue Apr 28 23:32:40 2015 UTC,"A capital ""i"" that's trying to fight."
Whatisthis,347dyv,Feezed,2,Wed Apr 29 00:12:44 2015 UTC,I can never unsee that.
